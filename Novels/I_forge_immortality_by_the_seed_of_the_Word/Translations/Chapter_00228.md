# Chapter 226: Changes and Appearances

At the foot of Mount Lingshu, the numerous disciples and members of Three-Yuan City, Yu Shui Sect, and Dragonscent Sword Sect were glaring at each other. With their vital interests at stake, no one was willing to concede an inch.

They knew very well in their hearts that once the power behind them successfully claimed ownership of this spiritual land, they would gain immeasurable benefits. Putting aside other things for now, at the very least, the cultivation effects within the spiritual land were far beyond what could be compared to the outside world. It wasn't just about the abundance of immortal spiritual energy; it also concerned certain subtle immortal opportunities. This was also why, once news of a high-grade spiritual land appearing emerged, not only nearby powers but even distant powers that received the news would participate in the struggle without hesitation. In front of a spiritual land, what was a sect relocation compared to that?

And at this moment, in the central area surrounded by numerous cultivators, the high-ranking members of the three factions were quietly observing each other, their expressions varying. The atmosphere was somewhat subtle. Among them, several vice-city lords of Three-Yuan City, including various enshrined elders and deacons, occasionally looked at their young city lord, especially the three disciples from the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm—two men and one woman—standing beside him. Their hearts were clearly filled with confidence. Now, Three-Yuan City effectively had the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm from the immortal Dao tradition, the Grand Unity Limitless Dao Sect, as its backing. Roughly speaking, it was equivalent to them also becoming disciples of the Grand Unity Limitless Dao Sect. With such a massive advantage, the group truly couldn't imagine how they could lose this time.

On the other side, the high-ranking members of Yu Shui Sect and Dragonscent Sword Sect, especially the long-browed man and the gentle woman leading them, also swept their gazes over the young city lord of Three-Yuan City and his companions. A hint of envy and hope flashed in their eyes, but there was none of the frustrated expression that the other party expected.

Suddenly, a light chuckle broke the silence in the arena.

“Haha, Junior Brother Qilian, I didn't expect such a land of creation to exist near your Three-Yuan City. What a great opportunity! Once you move in, don't forget to save a cave abode for your Senior Brother.”

Among the two men and one woman from the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm, the man leading them spoke boldly, as if completely ignoring the other two factions present. His voice carried a hint of jest, but bolstered by his identity, it landed in the ears of everyone present, unmistakably filled with undeniable domineering intent.

In his words, he directly settled the ownership of the Mount Lingshu spiritual land.

“Junior Brother Qilian, please also save a cave abode for your Senior Brother.”

“Junior Brother, you can't forget your Senior Sister.”

The other two also spoke up one after another, seemingly having completely sealed the fate of Mount Lingshu's ownership. In an instant, the people of Three-Yuan City all beamed with joy, and a subtle sense of superiority crept into their gazes towards the disciples of the other two factions.

On the periphery, some rogue cultivators watching the spectacle couldn't help but whisper among themselves.

“Ah, what a coincidence. It just so happened that the young city lord entered the Dao Sect. Now, the ownership of the spiritual land is completely without suspense.”

“Isn't that right?”

“Tsk tsk, Yu Shui Sect and Dragonscent Sword Sect have fought in vain for so many years, with countless cultivators killed or injured. It's pitiful that all their hard work was completely destroyed by the unexpected event of Three-Yuan City's young city lord joining a Dao Sect. Otherwise, it might not have been impossible for the three factions to divide this spiritual land equally.”

“There's nothing we can do about it. After all, it involves the Grand Unity Limitless Dao Sect! Who could have foreseen this?”

“It's a matter of timing and fate. It seems this spiritual land is destined for Three-Yuan City.”

…

“Three esteemed seniors of Grand Unity, isn't it a bit hasty to simply assign the ownership of the spiritual land to Three-Yuan City like this?” The long-browed man slightly raised his eyelids, then looked at the three disciples from the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm and asked solemnly. In his words, there was no trace of disdain despite the three being merely at the Golden Core realm.

After speaking, he looked at Qilian Yang, who wore a smile. “And virtuous nephew Qilian, you also know that this spiritual land has always been our three—”

However, before he could finish, he was directly interrupted by the other party.

“Uncle Lin, logically speaking, this spiritual land certainly has a share for your Dragonscent Sword Sect, and also a share for Aunt Leng's Yu Shui Sect. However, this nephew was fortunate enough to enter a Dao Sect, and your two families are merely presenting it as a congratulatory gift to this nephew.” Qilian said with a smile, “I wonder if the two of you can accept this nephew's explanation?”

Hearing this, the Yu Shui Sect Master, the gentle woman called ‘Aunt Leng’, couldn't help but glare angrily at the City Lord of Three-Yuan City, her chest rising and falling rapidly. Her cultivation robe even seemed to be on the verge of splitting apart.

“Fellow Daoist Qilian, is this the meaning of your Three-Yuan City? Forcibly demanding a gift, how utterly shameless!”

City Lord Qilian gave a simple, honest smile: “Fellow Daoist Leng, times have changed. You and I are no longer three-year-old children. The immortal Dao is vast, and the strong reign supreme—this is the law of heaven.”

However, no sooner had his voice fallen than a grand and confident voice suddenly resounded throughout the area.

“Haha, well said, 'the strong reign supreme'! In that case, this spiritual land should rightfully belong to me, Huang!”

Accompanying the sound of this voice, a terrifying aura, seemingly of the Dharma Idol realm but far surpassing everyone's imagination, suddenly descended and enveloped the area. In the sky, a massive nine-headed flood dragon Dharma Idol, five to six hundred zhang tall, like a towering divine mountain, swiftly flew over, carrying boundless wind, rain, and lightning. In just an instant, all the unusual phenomena vanished without a trace, and a man clad in a cloud-patterned golden robe suddenly appeared in the arena.

“Huang Jiulong, a disciple of the Grand Unity Limitless Dao Sect's Dongming Blessed Land, greets you all.” The man slightly nodded.

Seeing this, the gentle woman from Yu Shui Sect's face lit up with joy. She quickly led the man from Dragonscent Sword Sect beside her forward, and respectfully asked: “Esteemed Senior, this is the spiritual land I spoke to you about. Are you satisfied with it?”

Hearing this, the golden-robed man's gaze swept over the Mount Lingshu spiritual land, then he nodded in satisfaction and praised: “What a superb spiritual land! Are you two certain you truly want to gift this spiritual land to me?” He turned his head and looked at the man and woman behind him again, asking in confirmation. In his actions, there was no sign of him putting the people of Three-Yuan City on the other side in his eyes. It was as if history was repeating itself.

“We naturally wouldn't dare to deceive an esteemed senior.” The two said in unison, their voices filled with respect.

“Good! Then let's proceed according to the conditions I promised before. After you two return, choose suitable individuals and come find me. Remember, the chosen individuals should ideally have excellent aptitude, otherwise it would be a wasted opportunity.”

“We understand, thank you for your guidance, Esteemed Senior.” The long-browed man and the gentle woman said with excited expressions. This was great. Their Dragonscent Sword Sect and Yu Shui Sect also had disciples entering a Dao Sect, and it was a higher-ranked, renowned place compared to the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm: the Dongming Blessed Land.

On the other side, “Junior Brothers and Sisters greet Senior Brother.” The three Yellow Sand Dharma Realm disciples, who had just been arrogant and conceited, now hastily jogged over to the golden-robed man, bringing with them a dazed Qilian Yang. They bowed and greeted him cautiously.

“Hmm, Junior Brothers and Sisters, please rise.” The golden-robed man's gaze flickered, and then he said with a faint smile.

At this moment, the situation was reversed. The expressions on the faces of the many members of Three-Yuan City present, including the city lord, vice-city lords, and various enshrined elders and deacons, suddenly froze. None of them had expected such a turn of events would actually occur. The spiritual land, which they had considered to be within their grasp just a moment ago, completely flew away in the next instant.

For a moment, under the huge psychological disparity between before and after, everyone felt a trace of unreality in their hearts. On the periphery, it was also completely silent at this moment. Many onlookers involuntarily looked at the golden-robed man who had suddenly appeared in the arena, a strange look flashing in their eyes. They hadn't expected the reversal to come so quickly!

And what's more—a thought simultaneously flashed through everyone's minds: the three factions had fought tooth and nail for nearly a hundred years, with secrecy and suspicion in between, yet in the end, not a single party obtained ownership of the spiritual land! What kind of situation was this? If they had known this, why would they have fought in the first place?

But at this moment, tap, tap—

In the midst of the profound silence, the originally faint footsteps suddenly became loud. On the periphery. Within the arena. Numerous rogue cultivators, members of the three major factions, and several Dao Sect disciples, including the golden-robed man, all looked in the direction of the sound. In an instant, thousands of gazes, some astonished, some puzzled, slowly fell upon Zhang Jing, who was walking towards Mount Lingshu.
