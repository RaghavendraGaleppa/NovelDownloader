# Author's Note: Seeking Subscriptions and Monthly Tickets!

I just received word from my editor that this book will be officially released tonight at 12:00 AM.  

Though it came as a surprise, I gladly accept it!  

Once again, I want to express my deepest gratitude to all fellow Daoists for accompanying me over the past forty-three days.  

Being able to write the stories I love, create the characters I adore, and receive recognition from so many readers is an incredibly joyous experience.  

And all of this is entirely thanks to your unwavering support and kindness!  

I will continue to learn, carefully consider reader feedback, restrain my self-indulgence, use fewer exclamation marks, and strive to craft stories that everyone enjoys.  

After the official release, the update schedule for this book will be as follows:  

1. **First Day:** 10,000-word update.  
2. **Weekdays:** Minimum 4,000 words, aiming for 6,000.  
3. **Weekends:** Minimum 6,000 words, aiming for 8,000.  
4. **If initial subscriptions reach 2,500,** an extra chapter will be added.  
5. **For significant donations,** a special thank-you chapter will be posted.  

Finally, my heartfelt thanks to all who have supported this book. Every subscription, every monthly ticket, and every donation is the greatest reward for me.  

As a final gesture, I hereby offer the **Great Sage of the Demon Race, the Golden Ao**, refining **5,000 Ao Yuan Pills**—a secret treasure that enhances longevity, fortifies the liver and spleen, and replenishes kidney essence.  

These are dedicated to the first 5,000 subscribers—first come, first served, until supplies last! (Please forgive this old chuunibyou’s last act of stubbornness!)
