# Chapter 37: Heavenly Mist Platform

After returning from exchanging items in the plaza, Han Li discovered that the pills in his possession were even more popular than he had imagined. Many stall owners he encountered along the way, upon seeing Han Li was trading with pills, were willing to do business with him even if it meant taking a slight loss on the price. This ended up saving him a lot of spirit stones; Han Li felt he had struck it rich.

Back in the small building, Han Li saw that the staircase leading to the second floor was sealed off by a formation. Guessing that Han Zhen was likely cultivating, he decided not to disturb him. Preparing all the materials he had bought, he began his grand endeavor of talisman crafting.

Half a day later.

Han Zhen opened the formation barrier. As soon as he reached the stairwell, he heard Han Li cursing loudly.

"Damn it, heaven, you're toying with me!"

"Two dozen, twenty-four talismans! And these are just the simplest low-grade communication talismans! I should have succeeded at least once!!"

It was rare to see Han Li so utterly frustrated. Han Zhen composed himself, stifling laughter as he watched quietly from the side. Only when Han Li noticed him observing with a strange, unusual gaze did Han Li's expression shift from dejection to embarrassment. Han Zhen then explained, "You're still just starting out. It's common for people to fail hundreds of times when first learning talisman crafting."

He then explained spirit talismans and talisman arts to Han Li, informing him that unless one possessed extraordinary talent or immense family wealth, one shouldn't bother trying to become a talisman master.

"I thought talisman crafting was too simple," Han Li admitted. After hearing this, his thoughts finally cleared up. Han Li put away the unused cinnabar and talisman brush, clearly looking as if he had given up on practicing talisman crafting.

"Oh, right, this is for you." Han Zhen took out a spirit talisman from his storage pouch, controlling it with spiritual power to fly towards Han Li, where it settled steadily in his hand.

The spirit energy on the talisman was astonishingly rich, unlike any spirit talisman Han Li had seen when purchasing crafting materials.

"This is...?" Han Li stared at the spirit talisman in his hand, asking with a hint of hesitation, seemingly weighing its value and considering whether he should accept it.

"A wood-attribute, high-grade elementary Thorn Talisman, just drawn." Han Zhen's tone was as casual as if he were tossing over a low-grade spirit stone. "I have a slight talent in talisman crafting. If you want to learn, I can teach you, but this matter must not be revealed to outsiders."

This was because there had been cases of rogue cultivators with minor talents in cultivation arts being coerced, lured, or forcibly exploited by small sects or forces. Compared to waiting for returns after nurturing, draining the pond to catch all the fish was often their preferred choice. And Myriad Treasure Pavilion only knew one aspect of Han Zhen, unaware that he had grown from a novice to being capable of drawing high-grade elementary talismans within two years.

Han Li naturally understood, and at the same time, his mind was racing with thoughts. This wasn't just "slight talent" anymore; Brother Zhen was truly too modest. He naturally wouldn't doubt what Han Zhen said about the difficulty of talisman crafting. At this moment, Han Li recalled the frustration he felt when Han Zhen's cultivation and spell talent utterly surpassed his own.

But at least he had the small green bottle, giving him an absolute advantage on the path of alchemy! One day, he too would casually toss a bottle of spirit pills to Brother Zhen, displaying such a nonchalant expression. And then say, "I have a slight talent in alchemy. If you want to learn, Brother Zhen, I can teach you!"

Thinking this, Han Li's thoughts cleared up once more.

Han Zhen, of course, had no idea about the elaborate internal drama Han Li was playing out in such a short time. His own purpose was very simple. At the Tai'nan Minor Gathering, talismans of this caliber were almost never seen, and he still had a stack of them in his storage pouch. It was merely to give Han Li, who had no talisman treasures, an additional means of self-preservation. If it could make Han Li trust him more and lead to mutual benefit in resources, that would naturally be even better.

"By the way, the Immortal Ascension Convention is about to begin. Han Li, what are your plans?"

The Tai'nan Minor Gathering was nearing its end, and the Immortal Ascension Convention would start in a few days.

"My spiritual power is shallow, and the only powerful talisman I have is the one Brother Zhen just gave me. So I won't join the commotion," Han Li said calmly, rubbing his nose and shaking his head thoughtfully.

"Alright then. You can stay in this pavilion until the Immortal Ascension Convention ends in over ten days. No matter the outcome of the convention, I'll return at least once." Han Zhen directly handed Han Li the spirit talisman that controlled the pavilion's formation, as he still had a key to enter. "Also, after the last few Tai'nan Minor Gatherings, rogue cultivators have mysteriously gone missing. Whether you act alone or someone invites you to partner up, remember to be careful!" Han Zhen reminded him before leaving.

Upon hearing Han Zhen's words about the missing rogue cultivators, Han Li's expression changed. His eyes darted around as if recalling something, and his face darkened.

Not long after Han Zhen left, Han Li activated the protective formation of the cultivation room, placed a dozen bottles of pills in front of him, and began cultivating the Evergreen Art.

...

...

The Heavenly Mist Platform is located on the summit of Heavenly Mist Peak, the tallest mountain within Lan Province. It takes a day's journey by wind-riding from Mount Tai'nan. Its terrain is treacherous, perpetually shrouded in clouds and mist. Only cultivators with decent cultivation levels can reach the summit by riding the wind. The Heavenly Mist Platform appears as if the mountain peak was leveled by an immortal, with a cluster of magnificent pavilions built on the summit, resembling a celestial realm.

The open space outside the pavilions served as the arena for past Immortal Ascension Conventions when it was Lan Province's turn to host. The mountaintop was protected by formations, and dried bloodstains from decades ago still lingered on the arena, showcasing the brutality of the competition. Even so, thousands of cultivators above Qi Condensation Level Seven were about to fight to the death here, solely for the allure of the Foundation Establishment Pill.

At this moment, the clouds and mist on the mountain's summit platform churned, and a handsome young man in white robes drifted forth from the sea of clouds, like a banished immortal.

"Another expert at the eleventh level. Who could this monstrous genius be at such a young age?"

"Hmph, clearly an expert among rogue cultivators. If they were from a cultivation family, why would someone so young need to compete with us?"

"But the Yan family also sent two participants. How do you explain that?"

On the plaza by the arena, quite a few people had already gathered, secretly sizing each other up, taking the opportunity to observe their opponents for the Immortal Ascension Convention, aiming to know themselves and their enemies.

Han Zhen paid no heed to these wary gazes, walking directly towards the grand hall for convention registration. Since Han Zhen had arrived quite late, it was his turn after only a brief wait. To protect the cultivators' privacy, the hall was also shielded by a formation, preventing outside prying. Han Zhen had previously learned that the registration was handled by the host of each convention, which was considered an invisible benefit: if they discovered exceptionally talented young cultivators, they could intercept them beforehand.

Upon entering the hall, the temperature was much cooler than outside. Inside the hall was only an old man dressed in extremely gaudy, colorful robes. A pile of pouches at his waist seemed to have living things wriggling inside, making one's skin crawl just by looking at them. The old man's aura was unfathomable. Han Zhen naturally wouldn't be foolish enough to use his Heavenly Eye technique to observe the old man's cultivation; for high-level cultivators, that was an extremely impolite act.

Han Zhen stepped forward, cupped his fist, and bowed.
