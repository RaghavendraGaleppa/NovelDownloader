# Chapter 182: World Origin

"However, this item is currently within the palm-sized world inside that Buddha's phantom. It's not yet time for it to open, so there's no need to go there for now," Saint Devil explained.

"Forbidden Treasure?" Zhou Tian murmured, remembering that the old monk named Puzhi had also mentioned this term. However, since Zhou Tian didn't know the old monk's purpose at the time, he hadn't delved deeper. Now that Saint Devil brought it up again, it piqued his curiosity. What kind of treasure could attract the covetousness of Border Prison, leading them to relentlessly pursue it at any cost?

"I'm not entirely sure what specific treasure it is. I only know that Wutian's immense power, to the point of being able to defeat the Fozu who bore the Mandate of Heaven in the Buddhist Realm, is inextricably linked to this exotic treasure." A flicker of eagerness appeared in Saint Devil's eyes as he spoke, for no one could ignore such a powerful exotic treasure.

"That's truly extraordinary," Zhou Tian nodded. If old monk Puzhi's evaluation of Wutian wasn't biased, then that exotic treasure was indeed terrifying. Someone like Wutian, who hadn't had much contact with the Star Realm, could rely on that exotic treasure to contend with a colossal entity like Border Prison for a long time, even causing it significant damage. This alone spoke volumes.

"Most crucially, Wutian relied on that exotic treasure to prevent conflicts between his two personalities, despite their divergent paths. Each personality even reached the Heavenly Venerate realm." Saint Devil felt a touch of regret. If it were possible, continuing to cultivate with that supreme treasure would have been the most suitable path for him, but he couldn't obtain it now. Even if he didn't merge with the lotus seed and waited for the palm-sized world to open, he, as merely a Heavenly King, would still struggle to acquire it. One could only say it was a twist of fate; heaven didn't want him to walk that path.

"What's the other treasure?" Zhou Tian asked. This was only one treasure, but Saint Devil had mentioned there were two true treasures here.

"The other treasure is the World Origin."

"World Origin?" Zhou Tian was startled, as he had never heard this term before. While its literal meaning, the origin of a world, was easy to understand, he didn't know what it specifically entailed.

"That's right, World Origin." Saint Devil nodded and continued, "World Origin should be among the most valuable items in the Star Realm. It's the most fundamental substance of a world. If a world lacks its World Origin, then its destruction is not far off."

"The most valuable thing? Really?" Zhou Tian was surprised. It was easy to understand that a world would be destroyed if it lacked its World Origin, as the name implied. But the Star Realm was vast, with countless worlds. How could any treasure be called "the most" valuable?

"It's true. To this day, no one can clearly explain the composition of World Origin. They only know that this substance is omnipotent." Saint Devil explained, "Whether for cultivation, crafting treasures, or even treating certain chronic illnesses, World Origin can be used, and it has miraculous effects. There's almost nothing it can't do, only things you can't imagine." He added that these were all records he had seen in various ancient texts, and he himself had never witnessed such a thing firsthand.

"So it's like a panacea," Zhou Tian realized. It was indeed impressive. After all, a substance applicable to any situation was in itself a symbol of power.

"You could say that. While this thing is omnipotent and has a wide range of uses in the Star Realm, there's always been a saying circulating in the Star Realm that the optimal use for World Origin has yet to be discovered."

"What do you mean?" Zhou Tian asked, confused about the "optimal use" still being undiscovered.

"You should know that some worlds possess innate supreme treasures. All the ancient Nine Realms had them. Although they are now shattered, their power was boundless," Saint Devil didn't directly answer Zhou Tian's question, instead posing one of his own.

Zhou Tian nodded and said, "I know." He had indeed read about this in the Zhou family's ancient texts. The Futian Realm once had a supreme treasure nurtured by heaven and earth, a Heavenly Blade named Great Dragon Blade, which was incredibly powerful.

"Those supreme treasures, nurtured by heaven and earth, were formed from World Origin. However, no one has yet figured out how they transformed. And currently, the efficiency of using World Origin in the Star Realm is less than one percent of how the world itself uses it." Saint Devil sighed with emotion. Every world was an incredibly magnificent work of art, and no one knew how they were created. Even Heavenly Venerates couldn't create a truly natural world.

"Then let's hurry! What if such a good thing gets stolen by someone else?" Zhou Tian's eyes lit up. Even if he didn't need such a good item himself, he couldn't let it fall into others' hands.

"No need to rush. That thing isn't ready to emerge yet." Saint Devil smiled calmly. "The true treasures in this place are only those two. They are protected by certain restrictions. After this place opens, it will still be some time before they fully emerge. As for this lotus, Wutian probably never anticipated its appearance at all."

Bringing up Wutian, Zhou Tian said, "That old monk who gave you the information, he wouldn't happen to be from Luo Tian Temple, would he? That would be too ridiculous."

Saint Devil was silent for a moment, then parted his lips to utter a few words: "That's right."

"I figured it was those people," Zhou Tian pouted. "What exactly do they want? Why did they trick you into coming here?"

"I have some theories, but I'm not certain," Saint Devil frowned, unwilling to say more.

Since Saint Devil was reluctant to speak, Zhou Tian didn't press further. The two prepared to head towards the location of the World Origin.

"I suspect the people from Abyss Tomb are here for this World Origin," Saint Devil speculated on the way.

"Aren't they known as the Tomb of All Realms? Do they still lack World Origin?" Zhou Tian asked, puzzled.

"What do you take World Origin for? World Origin is incredibly rare. Acquiring it isn't as simple as just destroying a world." Saint Devil explained, "I don't know the specifics too well, but it requires extremely complex and difficult steps. If you want to know, go back and ask your family. They should know."

"Then it seems there's going to be a big fight," Zhou Tian rubbed his fists, eager for action. *My self-destruction is beyond your imagination.* Anyway, Abyss Tomb was currently plotting against the Nine Provinces, so even if he killed them, it wouldn't have any impact. As for whether he *could* kill them, Zhou Tian glanced at Saint Devil, who was already a Dao Lord. That question didn't exist. Two Dao Lords, one of whom could even self-destruct—how could they not finish them off?

There was still a considerable distance from the giant lotus to the location of the World Origin, but Saint Devil was now a Dao Lord, and his speed had significantly increased. In just one day, the two of them had approached the place.
