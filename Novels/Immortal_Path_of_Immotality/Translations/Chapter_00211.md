# Chapter 209: The Unfathomable Unleashed

As night fell, the main hall of the northern city's cave dwelling was filled with members of the Dai family. 

The Melting Gold Ancestor sat at the head of the gathering, listening to Dai Budong's detailed report on their investigative progress in Moonview City over the past few days. Zhu Duiyou and other Dai family disciples stood respectfully to the side, silently hoping Dai Budong would impress their ancestor with his performance.

Dai Budong, however, didn't claim credit for himself. He truthfully recounted all the information they had gathered and made sure to credit Zhu Duiyou for his strategic contributions that had brought them this far.

The Melting Gold Ancestor nodded repeatedly, impressed by Dai Budong's ability to recognize talent and his broad-mindedness, as well as Zhu Duiyou's foresight and resourcefulness. The loyalty and diligence of the Dai family disciples who followed them only reinforced his favorable opinion.

"After capturing Mountain Bear, our interrogation revealed that the origin of this case—the white-robed young man—was actually an old enemy Mountain Bear had encountered in the Eastern Sea of the Great Song Dynasty," Dai Budong reported.

"This individual is also a Pure Altar Envoy of the Black Lotus Sect, a remnant of the demonic path. Fifteen years ago, during the great battle at the demonic sects' headquarters, he suddenly appeared on the battlefield, calling himself Bu Peiying of the Willow Academy, and fought against us juniors."

"Now, in Moonview City, he has established the Lin Trading Company, operating behind the scenes. Through unknown channels, he has amassed vast quantities of seafood, accumulating immense wealth. This attracted our former Golden Core elder, whom he then ambushed and killed."

By this point, Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou had pieced together about seventy to eighty percent of the truth. Their investigative skills were truly remarkable—had Lin Shan been present to hear this analysis, he would have been astounded.

Yet, the Melting Gold Ancestor merely nodded without comment and instead posed a question to Dai Budong: "Do you know why I emerged from seclusion and came here personally, without waiting for the family to complete their investigation?"

Dai Budong was momentarily stunned. This was something he truly didn't understand.

Conventionally, since the murderer was capable of killing a Golden Core elder, the Dai family would have deliberated carefully before taking action. It was highly unusual for the family's pillar—the Grand Elder—to intervene so abruptly.

What if the perpetrator had formidable backing? What if the Grand Elder provoked someone they couldn't handle, bringing calamity upon the family?

Not only was Dai Budong puzzled, but Zhu Duiyou and the other family disciples were equally confused. Even Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Monarch would never have guessed the reason.

The Melting Gold Ancestor chuckled, stood up, and patted Dai Budong's shoulder. "Since you aim to compete for the position of family head—a role that drives the family forward—you must learn to think from a broader perspective rather than being constrained by conventions and rigid rules."

---

The Melting Gold Ancestor continued, "I emerged from seclusion this time because I had sufficient confidence to act. Moreover, I had two objectives!"

Dai Budong bowed respectfully, sensing the ancestor's intent to mentor him, and asked with a mix of nervousness and excitement, "This junior is ignorant. May I ask what confidence you possess and what those two objectives are?"

The ancestor folded his sleeves and began his lesson by discussing the broader situation: "Years ago, a monumental battle erupted in the cultivation world of the Lu Kingdom. Numerous factions attacked the True Knowledge Academy and the Flowing Clouds Trading Company to seize the precious treasure, the Hyacinth. In the end, a rogue cultivator known as the Pure Lotus Scholar emerged victorious, escaping with the treasure."

"At that time, the remnants of the demonic sects still had several Nascent Soul cultivators. Working together, they managed to capture the inventor, Ma Wentong, but without the key sixth-grade spirit material, the Profound Ash Spirit Stone, they couldn't replicate the Hyacinth. Thus, they turned their attention back to pursuing the Pure Lotus Scholar."

"The Confucian sages, fearing that the Pure Lotus Scholar might be overpowered and the Hyacinth would fall into demonic hands, had no choice but to join the chase. With this media artifact, the demonic sects could spread their corrupting beliefs far and wide, potentially triggering a catastrophic calamity."

"The Pure Lotus Scholar fled the Lu Kingdom, with the demonic remnants in relentless pursuit. The Confucian sages, compelled to prevent the Hyacinth from falling into the wrong hands, had no choice but to continue the chase. Thus, the three parties remained locked in a stalemate for years, none able to break free."

"Meanwhile, with the Nascent Soul elders of the Lu Kingdom's top factions absent, their bases were left vulnerable. To ensure their safety, these factions recalled their disciples and sealed their gates, forbidding anyone from venturing out."

The Melting Gold Ancestor cast a meaningful glance at the assembled family members, particularly Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou, who shuddered as if struck by sudden insight.

"In such an environment, with the top factions inactive, it's the perfect opportunity for major powers like ours to rise. It's also a time for schemers to reshuffle the board. Thus, the death of our Golden Core elder might well have been instigated by other forces behind the scenes."

"However, no matter how strong they are, our Dai family has nothing to fear. With Nascent Soul cultivators absent, late-stage Golden Core cultivators are the pinnacle of power. In these extraordinary times, we must strike back decisively, annihilating the murderer with overwhelming force to serve as a warning to others."

"Had we waited for the family's internal investigations to conclude, the murderer would have long since fled. Not only would our family have lost a Golden Core elder in vain, but we would also have forfeited all our assets in Moonview City, becoming a laughingstock in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world—losing both face and substance."

"That is the consequence of hesitation!"

The Melting Gold Ancestor's eyes blazed with golden light. With centuries of experience and having elevated the Dai family to its current stature, he had a profound understanding of the broader trends and a foresight that surpassed others. His decisiveness was unwavering.

---

Thus, without waiting for the family's bureaucratic procedures to conclude, he had come to Moonview City alone, his ruthless and heroic demeanor on full display.

Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou finally understood why their ancestor had been so confident in coming alone—there had been deeper reasons behind his actions.

Seeing their comprehension, the Melting Gold Ancestor continued his guidance: "This trip has two additional objectives. First, to strike decisively and demonstrate the Dai family's might, quelling any restless ambitions among lesser powers, while avenging our Golden Core elder and reclaiming our lost treasures."

"Second, Mountain Bear is connected to another opportunity."

Here, the ancestor fell silent, waiting for the duo's response.

Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou, quick-witted, exclaimed simultaneously: "The Pure Lotus Scholar!"

"Correct!" The Melting Gold Ancestor laughed heartily. "After the Pure Lotus Scholar was publicly pursued, the major factions of the Lu Kingdom sent investigators to the distant Song Kingdom to uncover details about this Nascent Soul rogue cultivator. They discovered he had a personally ordained disciple—Mountain Bear."

"This disciple is likely the only vulnerability of this mysterious and powerful rogue cultivator. If we capture Mountain Bear and present him to the Confucian sages as leverage against the Pure Lotus Scholar, do you think our Dai family would earn substantial rewards?"

"Just days ago, Mountain Bear was spotted crossing the Lu Kingdom's borders, his appearance matching the portraits obtained from the Song Kingdom. Unexpectedly, he had come to the Lu Kingdom and entered Moonview City. The elders of major sects mobilized immediately to capture him for the Confucian Nascent Soul sages."

"Yet, not only did I arrive first, but our family's juniors had already captured him by sheer coincidence."

"Tell me, isn't this destiny?"

The Dai family disciples in the hall erupted in understanding, murmuring praises for their ancestor's wisdom.

Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou trembled with excitement. They had never imagined that Mountain Bear, whom they had captured by accident, would turn out to be such a valuable asset, inadvertently securing a major achievement for their ancestor!

In the future, presenting Mountain Bear to the Confucian sages would undoubtedly bring the Dai family immense rewards. The family might even ascend to greater heights or secure promises from several Nascent Soul elders—far outweighing the value of their assets in Moonview City.

However, Dai Budong hesitated and asked: "Ancestor, if we capture Mountain Bear and use him as leverage against the Pure Lotus Scholar, what if the Pure Lotus Scholar seeks revenge on our family afterward?"

The hall fell silent as everyone considered this possibility.

When they had initially captured Mountain Bear, they had pondered this question. At the time, Dai Budong had been backed into a corner—if he failed to solve the case and recover the losses, his future would have been ruined. Thus, he had acted without considering the consequences.

Now that capturing Mountain Bear had turned into a great merit, they began to worry about the family's future.

The Melting Gold Ancestor stroked his beard and reassured them: "After we present Mountain Bear, there are only two possible outcomes."

"First, the Pure Lotus Scholar might yield, handing over the Hyacinth or reaching a compromise with the Confucian sages. In that case, the Confucian elders would have no reason to harm Mountain Bear, and he would be safely returned to his master. Given the Nascent Soul cultivator's status, he likely wouldn't bother retaliating against our family over such a minor conflict."

"Second, the Pure Lotus Scholar might resist to the death, disregarding his disciple's safety. In that scenario, both the righteous and demonic factions would unite to eliminate him, leaving him no time or energy to target our family."

"Moreover, when we present Mountain Bear, we can include a condition: if the Pure Lotus Scholar ever seeks revenge, the Confucian Nascent Soul sages must protect us. They would hardly refuse."

The ancestor's reasoning was sound and thorough, earning the trust of all present. They marveled at his foresight and meticulous planning, eagerly anticipating the rewards they would receive for presenting Mountain Bear.

"If that's the case, that young man Lin Shan unwittingly helped us by shifting the blame. Setting aside his ambush on our Golden Core elder, he's practically a lucky star for us!"

"Indeed! If we can use this opportunity to gain the favor of a Confucian Nascent Soul elder, it would be an unparalleled advantage!"

"Tsk tsk tsk, that kid is probably still gloating, unaware we've already uncovered his secrets."

"Haha, not only have we solved the case, but we've also stumbled upon this opportunity. Truly marvelous!"

Had Lin Shan known someone called him a "lucky star," he might have jumped for joy, proclaiming how rare it was to find someone who understood him.

However, unbeknownst to the Dai family, in the prison cell beneath their feet, two guards had already met gruesome deaths—their bodies desiccated, their blood drained.

"Chirp chirp~"

A strange cry echoed through the cold dungeon. Mountain Bear weakly opened his eyes, sensing something amiss, and suddenly wore an expression of terror.

"Rip—squelch!"

A tearing sound accompanied the splitting of his lower garments as a purple tentacle emerged from his back.

Mountain Bear couldn't conceal his panic. For years, he had suppressed this entity, fearing its emergence would bring catastrophe upon him.

His master, the Pure Lotus Scholar, had warned him that this cursed purple tentacle was of extraordinary origin—sinister, terrifying, and utterly unnatural. It must never be released, lest it grow uncontrollably.

Otherwise, it might eventually consume its host, draining their lifeblood to emerge as an independent entity, wreaking havoc upon the world!

Hearing that the tentacle would treat him as nourishment, Mountain Bear had been terrified. He had dedicated at least thirty percent of his strength to suppressing it at all times, never daring to slacken.

But now, with his cultivation sealed by spirit-restricting talismans and his divine sense immobilized, he could no longer restrain the eerie tentacle. Sensing its opportunity, it had broken free.

"Chirp chirp~"

The purple tentacle writhed grotesquely in the air, as if celebrating its liberation, indulging in a macabre dance of freedom.

Its tip lightly tapped the void, sending ripples outward as though probing its surroundings.

Mountain Bear gaped, unsure what to do, his anxiety reaching a fever pitch.

The tentacle, sensing its host's distress, affectionately caressed his face with its slimy surface, nuzzling him like a lover—a sight that sent chills down the spine.

Mountain Bear's face paled. He knew this was the end. Once this monstrosity was unleashed, Moonview City would drown in blood.

The tentacle seemed to read his thoughts, dancing excitedly as if in agreement.

Then, it coiled slightly before shooting upward with explosive force!

"Boom!—"

"Crash—!"

Debris rained down as a gaping hole appeared in the dungeon's ceiling. The tentacle's root appeared connected to Mountain Bear's body, yet it seemed to extend from another dimension, its length limitless.

It stretched endlessly, bursting into the hall above.

"Chirp chirp chirp~"

The Dai family members, still deep in discussion, turned in shock to see a thick, grotesque purple tentacle covered in indescribable patterns emerge from below, writhing excitedly as if savoring the sight of fresh prey.

A foul stench filled the air, and the disciples felt dizzy, their blood stirring unnaturally.

"What is that?!"

The Melting Gold Ancestor reacted swiftly, flicking his finger to release a golden blade.

"Clang—!"

A metallic clang resounded—the tentacle remained unharmed, bearing only a faint white mark where the blade had struck.

The Dai family was stunned. Even a casual strike from a late-stage Golden Core cultivator was beyond what an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator could withstand. Yet, this tentacle was completely unscathed.

Unbeknownst to them, decades earlier, during the early days of the Great Song's demonic calamity, this very tentacle had clashed with the former leader of the Black Lotus Sect in the Bianliang military court. It had taken the combined efforts of multiple Golden Core cultivators to suppress it.

Later, during the great war between the righteous and demonic paths, Mountain Bear had fought on the frontlines, and the tentacle had secretly feasted on blood, growing stronger until the Pure Lotus Scholar discovered and re-sealed it.

After the demonic calamity subsided, Mountain Bear abandoned his demonic identity and journeyed millions of miles with the Pure Lotus Scholar to the Lu Kingdom.

Midway, however, the Pure Lotus Scholar received an urgent message and abruptly departed, leaving his disciple behind.

Mountain Bear had no choice but to continue alone.

Lost in unfamiliar and treacherous lands, he exhausted the protective artifacts his master had given him and repeatedly faced life-threatening dangers. During these trials, the purple tentacle had begun to stir, gradually regaining strength.

Over time, its growth became unstoppable. Mountain Bear, unsure when it would break free entirely, had hurried to find his master, hoping for help in resealing the abomination.

Yet, mere days after arriving in Moonview City, he had been captured by Dai Budong's group, leading to the current disaster.

Though the Melting Gold Ancestor didn't know the tentacle's origins, his experience told him it was a formidable foe. He ordered Dai Budong and the others to leave the cave dwelling while he remained, his expression grave.

The tentacle, sensing its prey escaping, shrieked in frustration and lashed out, only to be intercepted by the Melting Gold Ancestor.

The cave dwelling was soon engulfed in flying debris and swirling dust as the battle raged.

---

Meanwhile, in the western part of the city, Lin Shan, the Black Skeleton Demon Monarch, and Lü Xiuming listened to a subordinate's report.

"Three days ago, a group of Dai family cultivators did arrive in Moonview City, led by two Foundation Establishment cultivators. They settled in the northern cave dwellings. As for the arson at the fish ponds outside the city, there's no evidence yet linking it to the Dai family."

However, Lin Shan and the others were already convinced—the Dai family was almost certainly behind it. No one else had a motive.

Lin Shan's eyes flickered with contemplation. The Black Skeleton Demon Monarch guessed his plan—with Lin Shan's Heavenly Thunder technique, they could redirect blame once more, just as they had years ago when they framed the Li family's ancestor in Moonview City.

But before the demon could speak, a deafening explosion shook the city.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!—"

The entire city trembled as a fierce battle erupted in the north.

Lin Shan and the others rushed outside, gazing at the horizon.

"Chirp chirp chirp~"

A piercing shriek echoed through the moonlit night, rousing countless cultivators.

A massive purple tentacle, over thirty meters long, writhed in the sky, its dark purple blood splattering under the moonlight. Above it, a white-haired, youthful Golden Core elder manipulated three golden beams, locked in fierce combat with the monstrosity.

The two clashed violently, heedless of the city around them!
