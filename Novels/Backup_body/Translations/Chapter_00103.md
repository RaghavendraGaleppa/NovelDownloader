# Chapter 103: Beneath the Human Immortal Realm, All Are Ants!

Inside the imperial palace, upon the royal bed.

The aged emperor's eyes were already clouded, his energy exhausted.

He had once been at the peak of the True Qi realm, with perfected Heavenly Circuits, wielding the highest authority in the Central Continent. The national treasury held countless treasures, and though he could not achieve the Human Immortal realm, prolonging his life was not difficult.

Yet now, even that was beyond reach.

"I am about to die..."

This thought weighed heavily on the emperor's mind. He had already consumed two Hundred Refinements Life-Death Pills, yet they failed to ignite the faint remnants of vitality within him. They merely allowed him to cling to life a little longer, preventing his last breath from escaping at this very moment.

"Does Your Majesty wish to witness the new emperor of Great Zhou ascending to the Human Immortal realm before closing his eyes in peace?"

The State Preceptor sat by his side, his expression one of concern as he sighed. "The Crown Prince possesses great talent and vision. If he ascends the throne, Great Zhou will surely flourish under his rule. Yet his ambitions... are far too vast."

The emperor lifted his gaze, revealing a flash of killing intent.

The State Preceptor sighed again. "The Imperial Jade Seal has already been handed to the Crown Prince. You can no longer strip me of the national fortune I control with a mere thought. Your Majesty's gaze cannot kill. Only I, with my Eye Technique, can kill with a look."

He continued, "The Crown Prince is intelligent and ambitious. Yet even I did not anticipate that his aspirations would reach so high as to dominate the entire world."

"Six months ago, the Crown Prince cultivated poisonous insects to poison himself, then pinned the blame on the Venom King Xin Xuan. At the same time, he secretly dispatched men to ensure Xin Xuan was never captured..."

"His schemes were indeed well-hidden. To maintain secrecy, he even kept me in the dark. Over the past six months, he recalled the Mystic Mirror of the Hall to prevent me from uncovering the truth with a single glance."

"But as the State Preceptor, I am not entirely blind without the Mystic Mirror. I have pieced together some of the truth."

"Truth be told, as the current State Preceptor, would I not also wish to see Great Zhou produce a Human Immortal Emperor?"

The State Preceptor gathered his magical power, channeling a thread of vitality into the emperor before continuing, "Yet ever since the death of the Founding Emperor, every subsequent ruler who sought immortality has failed. The ensuing chaos, the prolonged turmoil, the collapse of order—all of it has brought suffering to the innocent people!"

After transferring a wisp of vitality, he withdrew his hand. "I believe... if the Crown Prince could maintain the status quo, ascending to the throne at the True Qi realm, preserving peace, and ruling with diligence and compassion as Your Majesty has done, that would be the best outcome."

"You are merely afraid!" The emperor's voice turned icy. "You are the strongest in Great Zhou, bolstered by the national fortune, a match for the sect leaders of the immortal sects. Though bound by imperial authority... as emperor, who would dare rashly remove the most crucial pillar of the Great Zhou Dynasty?"

He fixed his gaze on the State Preceptor. "But if the new emperor achieves the Human Immortal realm, reviving the glory of the Founding Emperor, he will be able to uphold the entire Great Zhou Dynasty! Then, the State Preceptor will forever remain a compliant dog—one that can be replaced at will if it disobeys, with no fear of consequences!"

"I am indeed somewhat afraid," the State Preceptor admitted with a nod. "But I also understand that the State Preceptor is, after all, the State Preceptor of Great Zhou. That is why, this time, I did not personally enter the battle within the grotto-heaven to stop the Crown Prince. If the Crown Prince succeeds, I will bow before him for all eternity..."

"He will not fail!" the emperor said firmly.

"I know the news of the 'Creditor' appearing in the Southern Wastelands was meant to draw the Human Immortals of various factions there, creating an opportunity for the Crown Prince to act with fewer obstacles," the State Preceptor sighed. "But five Human Immortals have appeared within the grotto-heaven. It seems the 'trap' in the Southern Wastelands only lured away some of the Human Immortals from the Central Continent."

"Do you think I did not anticipate this?" Though weak, the emperor's eyes held a mocking glint. "Luring away some of the Human Immortals was enough. The remaining ones are just right—any more would have been too much to handle."

"..." The State Preceptor fell silent for a long moment before realization dawned. "Truly, the combined schemes of two generations of emperors run deeper than even this State Preceptor could foresee."

"After today, Great Zhou will have a Human Immortal Emperor!" the emperor gasped. "From this day forth, the Great Zhou Dynasty will once again stand above the Three Great Immortal Sects and the Two Great Buddhist Schools. As the State Preceptor of this era, you should feel honored."

"Even if the new emperor strips me of the national fortune and seizes the legacy passed down by my master over three generations, I should feel honored?"

The State Preceptor sighed. "All these years, it is not that I refused to hand over this so-called 'legacy,' but because it was buried with my master beneath Fengdu Mountain... Yet no matter how I explained, the previous emperor did not believe me, nor did Your Majesty, nor does the Crown Prince..."

He looked at the emperor and said, "Today, the imperial family's grand scheme seems to have deceived the heavens and crossed the sea, on the verge of success. But I fear it will prove as fleeting as flowers in a mirror or the moon reflected in water—ultimately empty! Since I cannot dissuade you, I can only seek a path for the common people, lest both emperors perish and the Great Zhou Dynasty collapses, bringing suffering to all!"

---

Within the grotto-heaven, the five Human Immortals had been waiting. When the time came, they all appeared.

Previously, the Crown Prince had feigned death, hiding in the shadows.

Meanwhile, traces of the Creditor had appeared in the Southern Wastelands.

All the Human Immortals should have rushed there to join forces and slay the Creditor!

Yet five remained gathered here.

"It seems the Three Great Immortal Sects and the Two Great Buddhist Schools have never relaxed their vigilance against the Great Zhou Dynasty," Li Zhengjing remarked. "Even with the Creditor's appearance, each sect left behind a Human Immortal to keep watch over the capital."

"The immortal sects and Buddhist schools may not have known about the Crown Prince's feigned death," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "But they have never lowered their guard against the Great Zhou Dynasty. In the past, the Founding Emperor suppressed the world under his might, forcing even the immortal sects and Buddhist schools to submit. The Great Zhou Dynasty of later generations must never again produce such a figure!"

"So now that the Crown Prince, the mastermind behind this, has revealed himself, they will act," Li Zhengjing mused. "But why did they wait a full quarter-hour after his appearance before making their move?"

At that moment, Li Zhengjing had already realized the staircase in the sky was a trap.

He had considered warning the other cultivators in the grotto-heaven, but the golden threads of fortune showed that speaking up would instantly provoke the killing intent of the five Human Immortals. Thus, he held his tongue.

"This Crown Prince possesses a supreme treasure, his form shifting between real and illusory. He could escape the grotto-heaven at any moment!"

"Only when the formation activates, turning the grotto-heaven into a cauldron, will he stand atop the palace roof—the focal point of the formation—to consume the refined 'elixir'!"

"And it is precisely because of this that the Crown Prince is now anchored there, unable to flee!"

Yuan Zhengfeng's tone was tinged with complexity.

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "Isn't it also because these five Human Immortals wish to use the Crown Prince's hand to refine the elixir, then seize it for themselves?"

The infamy of refining such a pill would fall solely on Great Zhou!

After consuming the great elixir to enhance their cultivation, slaying the Crown Prince to eradicate evil and uphold righteousness would earn them the glory they deserved!

Yuan Zhengfeng remained silent, tacitly acknowledging this.

The Hanging Bird poked its head out and cursed, "How shameless! To feast on a pill of human blood—these old trash deserve to die!"

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its roots. "Master, what shall we do? This situation seems far worse than we imagined. Look at the edges of the grotto-heaven..."

Just as the five Human Immortals appeared, five divine lights rose from all directions at the grotto-heaven's periphery!

The five Human Immortals inside exchanged glances, their expressions grave.

Now, over a dozen beings at the Human Immortal level had gathered within this grotto-heaven!

"To win the trust of the Three Great Immortal Sects and the Two Great Buddhist Schools, I withdrew all Human Immortal-level experts from the capital!"

The Crown Prince stood atop the palace, his voice steady. "Only the State Preceptor and two Divine Generals remain in the capital. I knew the State Preceptor would not aid me, and the two Divine Generals would surely be barred from entering the grotto-heaven. But..."

He looked at the five Human Immortals, his tone dripping with scorn. "For centuries, the Three Great Immortal Sects and the Two Great Buddhist Schools have underestimated the foundation of the Great Zhou Dynasty! Over the years, Great Zhou has retreated step by step, even ceding the lands around your mountain gates to your own governance, turning them into states within a state. But after today... Great Zhou will redefine the Central Continent and subdue all factions!"

Five divine beings strode forth, surrounding the grotto-heaven from all sides!

The Human Immortals of the capital had been withdrawn!

But... the divine beings remained!

These were the officially recognized gods, sustained by centuries of imperial worship and sacrificial rites!

"Five divine beings hidden within the capital?"

"These five—we've never seen them before!"

"Wait, ancient records mention traces of these five. They..."

The faces of the Human Immortals darkened as their hearts sank.

The capital's Human Immortals had been withdrawn, yet divine beings remained... According to intelligence from various sects, none of the gods had come to the capital—only the Southern Domain's Divine Mother had perished!

"For centuries, the gods have guarded the realms. The Southern Domain alone had six divine beings. But none of the sects anticipated that today's events were part of a centuries-long scheme by Great Zhou!"

The Crown Prince stood atop the palace, his aura rising steadily as he declared coldly, "These five divine beings were obtained by the Founding Emperor during his conquests. It was proclaimed that they perished together, but in truth, their complete forms were preserved! All to secretly leave behind a foundation for future generations of Great Zhou!"

Boom!!!

The five Human Immortals sought to break the formation and slay the Crown Prince!

But the five divine beings joined forces to resist, activating the Dragon Pillars of the Hall to summon golden dragons that suppressed the five Human Immortals!

"I shall ascend as emperor and achieve immortality!"

The Crown Prince stood with his hands behind his back, boundless energy converging beneath his feet as he gazed down upon all living beings. "The immortal sects have shown Great Zhou due respect, for surely many Human Immortals remain in the capital now. But..."

He smiled at the five Human Immortals. "Most of the Central Continent's Human Immortals have gone to the Southern Wastelands to slay the Creditor, while some have come to the capital. Yet the Golden Ship of Salvation has dispatched five Helmsmen to hunt down the true disciples of the immortal sects and Buddhist schools..."

The five Human Immortals within the formation paled, exchanging shocked glances.

"After you entered the grotto-heaven, news spread through the capital that the Golden Ship was hunting true disciples."

"Before I revealed myself, you could only suspect Great Zhou's schemes—you could not be certain!"

"But the Golden Ship's hunt is undeniable. So, esteemed friends, consider this: Will your comrades remain in the capital, calmly awaiting your summons to break into the grotto-heaven and aid you?"

"Or will they rush to rescue the future pillars of your sects before you can even send word?"

The Crown Prince seemed to have foreseen everything. Confident, he swept his gaze over them. "Today, within this grotto-heaven, all beneath the Human Immortal realm are but the foundation I will use to gather the fortunes of the land and forge a new national fortune!"

His eyes burned with fervor as he declared, "And you five Human Immortals are the true great medicine that will allow me to shatter the bloodline curse and break free of my shackles!"

Within the formation, the nine staircases in the sky began retracting toward the palace!

The five Human Immortals roared in fury, striving to break the formation!

But they were already trapped inside!

The five divine beings stood outside, manipulating the twenty-four Dragon Pillars of the Hall to suppress the five Human Immortals completely!

The formation, now a cauldron, imprisoned the five Human Immortals and thousands of cultivators from across the land!

Once refined, the Crown Prince would use the Imperial Jade Seal to consolidate a new national fortune and ascend as the new emperor!

Once refined, the combined cultivation of five Human Immortals and thousands of cultivators would allow him to break the bloodline curse and achieve the Human Immortal realm!

"Crown Prince, have you forgotten about me?"

Li Zhengjing raised his hand, asserting his presence.

Countless eyes turned toward him.

Within the grotto-heaven, he was the only cultivator not trapped within the "Cauldron Formation."

Yet no one saw him as hope.

For the Crown Prince now wielded the Imperial Jade Seal, drawing boundless power into himself. Though he had not yet crossed the threshold into the Human Immortal realm, the might he now commanded... was beyond any being beneath that level!

Even if the Young Master of Kunlun were here, his Great Derivation Void-Transforming Sword Qi would be insufficient to break this deadlock!

As for Li Zhengjing, though he had not become one of the Crown Prince's "ingredients," how could the Crown Prince possibly let him live after today?

Refining living beings into medicine was the act of a demonic path!

The Crown Prince would become the new emperor—he must be virtuous, benevolent, and revered as a sage ruler who revitalized Great Zhou. How could he allow anyone to know the ugly truth of his deeds today?

Though Li Zhengjing stood outside the formation now, once the Crown Prince succeeded, his death would be certain!

"Your talent is unmatched in this era. Had you become an ingredient in my formation, I would have been delighted!"

The Crown Prince smiled. "But the formation does not need you... yet you should never have entered this grotto-heaven!"

With a flick of his finger, the nearest Dragon Pillar of the Hall transformed into a golden dragon, lunging to devour Li Zhengjing!

"Had you remained outside, ignorant of the truth, I would have valued you greatly after achieving the Human Immortal Emperor's throne. But alas... this is your fate!"

"Crown Prince, have you considered that this might also be your fate?"

Li Zhengjing swallowed a piece of broken jade, drew the Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber, and met the golden dragon with a thunderous slash.

His voice echoed through the grotto-heaven.

"If no power beneath the Human Immortal realm can break this deadlock..."

"Then what if I, Li Zhengjing, ascend to the Human Immortal realm today?"
