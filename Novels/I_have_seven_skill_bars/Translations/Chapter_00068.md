# Chapter 68: Five Elements Return to One

Half a month later. On this day.

Ding Rui woke up early in the morning. Instead of going straight to work in the spirit field, he first went to the edge of the field, sat down quietly, closed his eyes, and began to mobilize all the unassigned true essence within his body to cultivate. For this cultivation, he did not use his skill slots, relying entirely on himself to control the true essence!

The unassigned true essence rapidly flowed out from the major meridians of his body, then entered his chest, dividing into five different paths, flowing towards the meridians of his five internal organs. The speed was incredibly fast! Ding Rui couldn't slow down; he had to perfectly replicate the original speed used when employing the skill. Only then could the inertial memory he had cultivated over the past two months fully take effect. This was the conclusion Ding Rui had reached after countless attempts in recent days.

He wasn't 100% confident in success; he could only make the attempt, once each morning after waking up and once each evening after cultivating. If he got a little lucky one time and succeeded, then he would be completely successful. For other spirit farmers, they had to learn to manage five tasks simultaneously, controlling the operation of five cultivation techniques without any errors. Because for every cultivation session, they needed to do it themselves. But Ding Rui only needed to succeed once.

"Host has comprehended a skill. Please choose whether to add the skill to a skill slot and name the skill!"

The familiar message appeared in his mind. Ding Rui closed his eyes and looked at the dazzling skill interface in his mind, where a brand new skill icon was twinkling. Without hesitation, he directly deleted all five skills — [Dew Cultivation Art], [Verdant Wood Art], [Golden Radiance Art], [Earth Qi Art], and [Condensed Yang Art] — from his skill slots. Then, he placed the newly appeared skill into a slot and gave it a name he had long prepared: [Five Elements Return to One].

"Whoosh..."

Ding Rui opened his eyes and let out a long breath. Immediately after, he took out a few spirit grains from nearby, ate them, and refined them into unassigned true essence. Then, he lay back on his bed and gently used the [Five Elements Return to One] skill. The cluster of unassigned true essence simultaneously began to operate. It entered his chest, then split into five paths, perfectly replicating the scene of his self-cultivation just moments before. Finally, the five streams of true essence completed their transformation, quietly floating within their respective acupoints.

"Could it be that now that I've freed up a skill slot, I have nowhere to use it?"

Ding Rui fell into excited contemplation.

...

On the very day he merged the five-element cultivation arts, Ding Rui directly comprehended the [Loosening Soil] skill. For the next half month, he spent his time outside of cultivation integrating the [Loosening Soil] skill with the [Insecticide] skill. Thanks to his prior experience using the Earth Qi Hoe and [Insecticide] simultaneously, he quickly got the hang of it and, as usual, began to cultivate his inertial memory.

Time passed quickly. The first spirit field harvest day since Ding Rui became a spirit farmer finally arrived. That day, Ding Rui opened the array formation and the gate of his spirit field early, waiting. He was confident in his harvest. The entire spirit field was filled with spirit rice, not a single stalk lost. All the grains were plump and perfectly round.

Several outer disciples entered plot 520 on a floating boat, gazing at the golden, dense spirit rice in the field, swaying like waves in the wind. They couldn't help but gasp.

"So much?"
