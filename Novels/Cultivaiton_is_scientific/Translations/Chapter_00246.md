# Chapter 246: Reunion  

Arhat Zhiming's face was grim. Ever since the deaths of Buddha Jueyuan and Buddha Juetu, and the loss of the Jade Foot Relic, he had remained at the checkpoint, waiting for an opportunity to infiltrate the Hundred Thousand Mountains and retrieve the relic from Li Yuanba.  

The Thousand Leaves Temple had already confirmed that Li Yuanba was the one who killed Buddha Jueyuan. However, Li Yuanba had been in seclusion within the Sinister Demon Sect for the past year, preventing Zhiming from making a move. He had been patiently waiting for intelligence from the sect, never expecting Li Yuanba to leave the Hundred Thousand Mountains and appear within the territory of the righteous factions.  

When Buddha Jueneng spotted Li Yuanba, he immediately reported it to Arhat Zhiming. By the time Zhiming received the news, Li Yuanba had already vanished.  

Zhiming paid a price to obtain the tracking information embedded in Li Yuanba's wooden pass. Every wooden pass contained a tracking formation—a precautionary measure to ensure that demonic cultivators who caused trouble within righteous territory could be traced.  

The energy fluctuations of the tracking formation were masked by the pass's anti-counterfeiting and reinforcement formations, making its presence nearly undetectable. Activating the tracking function was a last resort, as it risked exposing the pass's hidden mechanism. However, for the sake of the Jade Foot Relic and the Divine Foot Technique inheritance, Zhiming requested its use.  

With his Golden Core-level strength, capturing a mere Foundation Establishment cultivator like Li Yuanba should have been effortless. Though Li Yuanba's sword escape technique was fast, Zhiming's speed was among the top tier of Golden Core cultivators. After obtaining the tracking information, it took him only three hours to catch up.  

From a distance, Zhiming spotted Li Yuanba's figure. Unable to suppress his excitement, his eyes gleamed with anticipation.  

"Amitabha!" he chanted, his speed increasing with each syllable of the mantra. By the time the chant ended, he expected to stand right before Li Yuanba.  

This was the confidence of an Arhat—absolute certainty in his superiority over a weaker opponent.  

Sword cultivators were indeed formidable, and their sword escape techniques were swift—but only when facing opponents of the same realm. Against a Golden Core cultivator, Li Yuanba's speed was nothing special.  

---  

Just as the final syllable of the mantra was about to leave his lips, Li Yuanba sighed helplessly. He knew that after today, his troubles would multiply.  

At the moment Zhiming was about to seize him, his expression suddenly twisted into one of shock.  

Before his eyes, a pure white lotus bloomed beneath Li Yuanba's feet, elevating him with an ethereal grace akin to an immortal Buddha.  

Two hundred meters ahead, a second white lotus appeared. Li Yuanba vanished from his original position and reappeared atop the second lotus.  

Thanks to the enhancement from "Purple Qi from the East" and the cultivation of divine sense, the range of his "Lotus Steps" technique had expanded to two hundred meters.  

His figure flickered through the void, disappearing from Zhiming's sight at an astonishing speed.  

Zhiming stood frozen in mid-air, mouth agape, his dignified monk's composure shattered.  

He didn't give chase because he knew it was futile.  

That was the Divine Foot Technique's "Lotus Steps"—even at its initial stage, it far surpassed the speed of a Golden Core cultivator.  

Zhiming had once sought the Divine Foot Technique's inheritance but failed the trial, losing his eligibility. Only once every few centuries did a disciple emerge capable of inheriting the technique, a testament to its difficulty.  

Even Buddha Jueyuan, who had mastered "Lotus Steps," took over a decade to achieve proficiency and decades more to reach a hundred meters per step.  

Yet Li Yuanba, who had only obtained the Jade Foot Relic a year ago, was already stepping two hundred meters at a time.  

"How did he pass the trial of Buddhist intent?" Zhiming muttered after a long silence, finally regaining his composure.  

To inherit the Divine Foot Technique, one needed profound understanding of Buddhist teachings and the mental fortitude to withstand the influence of Buddhist chants on the soul. Even within the Thousand Leaves Temple, which specialized in preparing disciples for the trial, only a select few could succeed—and only after extensive training.  

"Could he be the reincarnation of a Bodhisattva?" Zhiming murmured to himself.  

He abandoned any thought of capturing Li Yuanba. Instead, he needed to report this discovery to the temple.  

The only explanation for Li Yuanba's rapid mastery of "Lotus Steps" was that he was the reincarnation of a Bodhisattva—one who had already mastered the Divine Foot Technique in a past life, allowing him to effortlessly reach such heights in this one.  

This was no small matter. A reincarnated Bodhisattva falling into the hands of a demonic sect was unacceptable to the Buddhist sects. If they could bring him back, his past-life foundation would ensure his rise to Arhat status—or even the restoration of his Bodhisattva rank.  

With a Bodhisattva in their ranks, the Thousand Leaves Temple could ascend to become the strongest sect in the Northern Shu Continent.  

Overcome with excitement, Zhiming immediately contacted the temple to relay his findings.  

---  

Meanwhile, Li Yuanba, having shaken off Zhiming with "Lotus Steps," finally felt a measure of relief. This was the first time he had used the technique to escape a Golden Core-level opponent, proving its superiority in speed.  

On the other side, Li Shiming, sensing his clone's predicament, activated the "Phantom Concealment Art" and rushed toward Li Yuanba using "Lotus Steps."  

His approach was far more discreet. Under the concealment art, as long as he remained in shadows, he was effectively invisible. He no longer traveled through the sky but instead used the terrain's shadows to maintain stealth while teleporting.  

With a range of 260 meters per step and the computational assistance of IBMz15, he could maintain both maximum speed and invisibility.  

What would have taken days to reunite was accomplished in mere hours as both Li Shiming and Li Yuanba relentlessly employed "Lotus Steps."  

---  

The first thing Li Yuanba did upon reuniting with his original body was to hand over the wooden pass to Li Shiming's machine room space. They then relocated and set up isolation and concealment formations.  

"Fellow Daoist, we meet again," Li Shiming said with a smile.  

"Fellow Daoist, I'll need your help once more," Li Yuanba replied, equally amused.  

As the same person, formalities were unnecessary.  

Li Shiming produced a stockpile of top-grade elixirs for Foundation Establishment mid-to-late stage cultivation—enough to sustain Li Yuanba until peak Foundation Establishment.  

This abundance was thanks to the Northern Shu Trading Company. The sheer volume of alchemy tasks he undertook for them—many of which were covert orders from other major sects—allowed him to accumulate such resources.  

Li Yuanba, in turn, handed over a storage pouch containing a complete set of Golden Core breakthrough resources, along with the corpses of numerous slain Foundation Establishment cultivators—mostly Buddhist monks and demonic cultivators.  

Li Shiming planned to refine these corpses into peak Iron Corpses, enhancing their combat power with the "Three Heads, Six Arms" modification, inspired by the success of his previous experiment, Nezha.  

Among the items was also the "Eternal Bloom," which Li Shiming immediately placed in the machine room space. The Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Furnace, preheated with Crimson Brilliance Flame, was ready.  

Though it was his first time refining the Eternal Bloom, his micro-level perception and IBMz15's data analysis allowed him to quickly grasp its properties.  

An hour later, the furnace's medicinal energy surged as Li Shiming executed the "Hundred-One Division Art," splitting the forming elixir into ten. With the aid of a spirit-gathering formation fueled by mid-grade spirit stones, the refinement proceeded flawlessly.
