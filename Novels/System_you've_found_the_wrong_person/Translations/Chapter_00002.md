# Chapter 2: Innate Qi

Bliss.  
Absolute bliss.  

Turns out it wasn’t just the system that had mistaken its target.  

Even the tasks issued by the system didn’t require him to complete them personally.  

Dou Changsheng had only hesitated for a moment, stunned by the system’s appearance, when his sworn brother finished the task within a quarter of an hour.  

The crucial part? The rewards went to him.  

Just as Dou Changsheng was marveling at this, his door was violently pounded.  

**Bang! Bang! Bang!!!!!**  

The relentless knocking echoed through the room.  

Ironclad Mad Lion, with his massive palm the size of a cushion, hammered on the door while urging, "Just got word—the convoy transporting the official silver has moved up their schedule. They’ve arrived in Jun County a day early."  

"We don’t have time to prepare anymore. We have to act now."  

Seemingly sensing Dou Changsheng’s hesitation, Ironclad Mad Lion channeled his inner qi into his palm and unleashed it like a cannonball. The door exploded into splinters, fragments and wood chips scattering everywhere.  

Striding into the room, Ironclad Mad Lion grabbed Dou Changsheng by the arm and dragged him outside.  

The moment they stepped out of the courtyard, they could see scattered groups of people on the street.  

At the far end of the road stood a lone figure.  

Mounted on a tall steed, the man carried a bundle on his back and a curved saber at his waist, its blade shaped like a crescent moon. An aura of killing intent radiated from him.  

The curved saber and the warhorse—this was the unmistakable attire of a Northern Frontier blade master.  

A figure Dou Changsheng’s original self had once idolized.  

Jun County bordered the frontier, where the open plains stretched endlessly into the grasslands. It was the domain of blade masters, who rode like the wind, howling like wolves.  

Among them were countless bandits, but also many true heroes.  

Ironclad Mad Lion burst into laughter at the sight, his thick beard flaring like a lion’s mane. He charged forward eagerly, exclaiming, "With General Zhenbei imprisoned and his elite forces scrambling to rescue him, they’ve resorted to hiring wandering blade masters to escort military payroll?"  

"Seems the general’s camp doesn’t trust the imperial court!"  

"Then again, if they’d entrusted this silver to the court’s men, it would’ve vanished for sure. The border troops would riot, their resentment boiling over. A little provocation, and they’d mutiny—sealing General Zhenbei’s fate forever."  

"The Northern Jin court is unjust, suspecting its own generals. Why not join me in defecting to the Southern Chen Dynasty? We’ll train under the Heavenly Demon Sect!"  

The blade master’s eyes flashed with fury. "You were born in the north, raised on the general’s benevolence. Instead of repaying his kindness, you’d sabotage his cause for personal gain?"  

"Without General Zhenbei guarding the frontier, risking his life to hold back the barbarians, they’d have invaded long ago!"  

"You heartless beast!"  

With a metallic *shing*, his saber left its sheath, its momentum fierce enough to tear through the air with a thunderous crack.  

This strike carried extraordinary force.  

Ironclad Mad Lion charged like a storm, his massive frame resembling a battering ram. A single punch, backed by explosive post-natal qi, struck with the force of a hurricane.  

**CRACK!**  

The blade in the master’s hand chipped from the impact, while Ironclad Mad Lion’s knuckles bore only a shallow cut.  

Blood slowly welled up but quickly stopped.  

Bare-handed, Ironclad Mad Lion had clashed with a steel saber and emerged with nothing more than a scratch.  

The blade master’s face twisted in shock and rage. "Iron bones and steel flesh—you’re Ironclad Mad Lion, Wang Xiong!"  

"You’re a renowned martial artist in these lands. For the Demon Master’s empty promises, you’d rob official silver? Commit such treason? Don’t you realize you’ll be exiled from the north forever? You’ll lose everything—your home, your friends, all of it!"  

Wang Xiong took another step forward, sneering. "I, Wang Xiong, had great talent but no divine techniques or master to guide me. All I could train was this crude Iron Shirt skill. Even the lowest-tier martial art, and I mastered it, earning the name Ironclad Mad Lion. But beneath the glory—"  

"—I’ve suffered countless hidden injuries. While I’m still young, age will weaken my vitality. Then I’ll end up like my old friends—bedridden, writhing in pain whenever the weather turns damp."  

"Men like us, born with nothing, can’t afford medicine or physicians. We train our external arts through sheer endurance, day after day, before dawn till past midnight."  

"After all these years, how could I not have enemies? Even those who pretend to be friends are just waiting for me to collapse so they can strip me bare."  

"I’m taking this silver as my ticket—my way into the Heavenly Demon Sect. I refuse to stay at the bottom."  

"I’m done with poverty. Whether General Zhenbei lives or dies means nothing to me."  

"As long as I live in luxury, with fine wine and beautiful women, that’s enough."  

Wang Xiong threw his head back in laughter, his voice brimming with arrogance. "Did you really think I didn’t know? You’re just the decoy. The real escort is Black Eagle Venerable, lurking in the shadows."  

"Black Eagle Venerable—a renowned elder of the righteous path, his inner qi far surpassing mine, a mere external-to-internal cultivator."  

"But I, Wang Xiong, didn’t survive this long without connections. Don’t bother hoping—Black Eagle Venerable won’t be coming."  

With a grip like iron, Wang Xiong seized the horse’s neck, veins bulging like coiling serpents. He wrenched the steed to the ground with sheer brute force.  

The horse whinnied in agony, one leg twisted and useless.  

The blade master leaped away, not to engage Wang Xiong but to scale the nearby wall, intent on escape.  

Wang Xiong watched with disdain, standing tall like an iron tower. He tore away the cloth covering his back, revealing a long bow beneath.  

In one fluid motion, he drew the bow to full draw.  

Three arrows loosed in succession, slicing through the air with piercing shrieks.  

Even as the first volley flew, Wang Xiong nocked three more arrows, drawing again.  

This bow was no ordinary weapon—each release produced a unique twang.  

The second volley sealed off every escape route.  

**CLANG!**  

The blade master’s chipped saber deflected one arrow, the impact numbing his hand.  

"Three Stars Piercing the Sun—a military archery technique!" he gasped. "Only centurion-level officers master this!"  

"You’ve got iron bones, impenetrable skin, and unmatched archery. Had you joined the army, you’d have been a champion! With the barbarians pressing in, you could’ve earned a noble title!"  

"Why throw it all away for banditry?"  

Wang Xiong watched coldly as the blade master barely dodged, an arrow now embedded in his thigh, the tip protruding, blood dripping.  

Dropping the bow, Wang Xiong advanced, his voice low. "I enlisted young, fought battles, earned merits—but never saw a reward. Instead, I barely escaped death. So I deserted."  

"Reborn as Wang Xiong, I made a name across counties—yet still found no opportunity."  

"Glory? Nobility? I stopped believing in that long ago."  

"To rise, you need connections or a patron."  

"With this chance, entering the Southern Chen’s Heavenly Demon Sect, my skills will shine."  

"The demonic path—survival of the fittest—suits me best."  

"I’ve said enough to mark this day."  

"Farewell to my weakness."  

Looming over the blade master, Wang Xiong raised an arrow, aiming for his heart.  

The blade master resisted, but it was futile. Though he’d avoided fatal wounds, one leg and his sword arm were crippled.  

Without his weapon or mobility, he was a lamb to slaughter.  

Wang Xiong remained vigilant, scanning for hidden allies.  

The blade master’s eyes filled with despair. The gap between them was insurmountable.  

Yet, with his last ounce of strength, he hurled the bundle from his back.  

The arrow pierced his heart.  

As blood spilled from the blade master’s lips, Wang Xiong ignored him, tracking the bundle’s arc—  

—straight into the hands of a swordsman in a bamboo hat.  

Wang Xiong forced a smile. "Good brother."  

"Hand it over. Let me inspect it."  

Dou Changsheng held the bundle, his expression unreadable.  

The scene had unfolded quickly, yet not too fast.  

Ironclad Mad Lion Wang Xiong was even more formidable than he’d imagined—iron bones, impenetrable skin, master archer.  

A man like this, driven by ideals and justice, would only be trampled. But once he cast aside morality, his ruthlessness would propel him to greatness.  

Wang Xiong had all the makings of success—except opportunity.  

And now, that opportunity lay in Dou Changsheng’s hands.  

This bundle contained a portion of the border army’s payroll. Though it weighed only a dozen pounds, its value was immense.  

The full payroll was a fortune beyond most men’s wildest dreams.  

Seeing Dou Changsheng hesitate, Wang Xiong’s smile faded. His beard bristled, his murderous intent thickening like fog.  

His predatory gaze locked onto Dou Changsheng, as if ready to tear him apart.  

But as Wang Xiong took his first step, a sigh cut through the tension.  

Dou Changsheng adjusted his hat with a faint sigh, slung the bundle over his shoulder, and slowly drew his sword.  

The three-foot blade was rusted, its edge dulled by neglect.  

Yet as Dou Changsheng raised it, his inner qi surged through the steel, coalescing at the tip into a three-inch white glow.  

A soft chuckle escaped him.  

"You relied on crude external arts to cultivate post-natal qi, forging this iron body. Not bad."  

"Had you trained like me from childhood, you might’ve stood a chance."  

"Pity."  

"But ‘what ifs’ are just fantasies."  

"I wonder—against my innate qi, can you withstand one strike? Or two?"  

"Will you surprise me?"  

Dou Changsheng advanced, his posture relaxed, sword swaying lazily—every movement exuding confidence.  

Wang Xiong froze mid-step, disbelief flooding his eyes.  

**Innate qi.**  

At such a young age—barely twenty—this was unheard of.  

A prodigy like this, destined for the martial rankings, was either nobility or a disciple of a grandmaster.  

Without resources or heritage, no one could break through to the innate realm so young.  

Wang Xiong’s face darkened. "I thought I’d grabbed some nobody. Turns out you’re from a prestigious house."  

"My mistake for not recognizing you."  

"Will you spare me?"  

It was a test.  

Dou Changsheng knew playing the young master required arrogance. Mercy would reveal his bluff.  

With a light laugh, he replied, "The silver’s safe. Just one dead blade master—hardly a major incident."  

"Kneel. Sever your qi as proof of loyalty, and I’ll take you as my servant."  

"You wanted opportunity?"  

"Serve me, and opportunities will come."  

Wang Xiong’s head snapped up. "Martial power is my foundation."  

"I don’t trust nobles like you."  

"Besides, when I took you hostage, your hands showed labor marks. No noble has those."  

"Your innate qi—it’s fake!"  

In a flash, Wang Xiong yanked the arrow from the blade master’s chest and hurled it at Dou Changsheng.  

Then he fled, glancing back—  

—one final test.  

If Dou Changsheng’s power was a bluff, Wang Xiong would turn and kill him with the bow.
