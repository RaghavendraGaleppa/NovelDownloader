# Chapter 173: The Calamity Star Descends

Tonight was destined to be a sleepless night.

At the frontline of Luosong Mountain Range, Dongmen Pass.

The air was filled with deafening battle cries as countless streaks of light soared from the west, resembling a grand meteor shower in the night sky, unstoppable as they crashed toward the demonic faction's positions.

On the ground, strange beasts galloped wildly, clad in engraved iron armor, their heads adorned with magical blades, and their tails trailing signal flares. Fearlessly, they charged into enemy lines.

Behind them came rows of war chariots and flying boats carrying righteous cultivators who had been conserving their strength for this moment. They hailed from sects, aristocratic families, or remote mountain forests, with even reclusive sects emerging to lend aid—all had prepared extensively for this counterattack.

This was an era of great contention, a time for reshuffling the deck!

Invading the eastern territories of Great Song meant the redistribution of cultivation resources, inevitably tied to military achievements.

With sufficient contributions, rogue cultivator factions might ascend to become cultivation families, minor sects could grow into mid-sized ones overnight, and mid-sized sects might even claim spiritual mountains and blessed lands to become energy powerhouses in the cultivation world!

After suffering heavy losses in previous battles, the Violet Heaven Sect had promised immense post-war benefits to rebuild the central warzone's strength. Driven by these incentives, all righteous cultivators were roused with wolfish greed, their combat prowess soaring.

Meanwhile, the demonic faction seemed to have learned of the Dry Cloud Pavilion and Beast Taming Valley's involvement in the northern and southern warzones. Knowing their cause was lost, they put up a token resistance before collapsing into full retreat.

In an instant, the entire Luosong Mountain Range, stretching north to south across Great Song, was engulfed in warfare.

Dongmen Pass, Chaisang Harbor, Qixi Slope, Fulong Ford, and Zixia Road—strategic points fell one after another as the demonic faction's frontlines crumbled. Demonic cultivators fled desperately by land, sea, and air, wishing they had extra legs.

Countless righteous forces pursued them, confident in their advantage. With the demonic heartland already infiltrated by dozens of turned factions and teleportation arrays established by top righteous sects at great cost, reinforcements were pouring in since the night's assault began.

Once the frontline broke, battles erupted everywhere behind enemy lines—a starry sky of ambushes ensuring the demonic faction could never regroup, only to be annihilated piecemeal until Great Song's territory was fully reclaimed and all coastlines secured.

...

Shangdang County, Gongsun Family Estate.

Deep in the night, over twenty figures lurked furtively at the edge of a grand formation.

They surrounded a skeletal frame that trembled as it meticulously arranged materials for final preparations.

"Are you sure you can do this? The preparations are taking forever! If we delay further, their teleportation array might fully activate!" Lin Shan couldn't help but urge, glancing nervously into the distance where a towering cylindrical light distorted the void. Compared to the physical clan-protecting formation beside them, that teleportation array caused far greater disturbances in the world's spiritual energy.

The sky swirled with multicolored energy forming a massive funnel around the teleportation array, blotting out the moon and stars. No wonder the Gongsun Family had activated their defensive formation, sealing the estate—allowing entry but no exit.

Such a spectacle would undoubtedly attract unwanted attention if seen outside.

Though given the demonic faction's current disarray at the frontline, whether they could spare forces here remained uncertain.

The Gongsun Family's two Golden Core ancestors stood silently as Elder Mang completed his final checks. With a pointed finger, a white streak of light shot from his fingertip toward the array's core treasure—the Teleportation Stone.

"Hummm~"

The teleportation array began rotating automatically. The ground cracked radially as a circular trench three zhang deep formed around the formation, sending earth and debris spiraling skyward.

"Whoosh~ Whoosh~ Whoosh~"

As the array drew power from underground spiritual veins, its activation intensified. The scene within grew increasingly distorted while Elder Mang adjusted coordinates, seemingly communicating with the array's distant counterpart through secret techniques.

The Gongsun clansmen watched wide-eyed—this was their first time witnessing a teleportation array, previously only heard of in jade slips or elders' tales. Reality far surpassed imagination, giving them bragging rights henceforth.

After all, such advanced formations were typically hoarded by top sects. Ordinary families lacked both the heritage to inherit such designs and resources to collect Teleportation Stones. Only the current crisis, requiring widespread deployment behind enemy lines, had compelled the three great righteous sects to part with these strategic treasures.

The Gongsun cultivators were thoroughly mesmerized.

Just as Elder Mang completed quality checks, debugging, and final alignment—fully activating the array to summon allies from tens of thousands of miles west—

"Crack! Crack! Crack!"

The clan's protective formation shuddered. The sky darkened abruptly as the luminous barrier ceased rotating and halted entirely.

"Woo~ Woo~ Woo~"

Warning tones echoed throughout the estate as the formation's operation was forcibly disrupted.

"Elder Gongsun, what's happening?" Elder Mang, unable to leave his post, urgently transmitted his concern.

The family head and grand elder quickly reassured him that it was likely a minor malfunction, unrelated to the teleportation array's operation, and that they would handle it.

Turning to their second elder, Gongsun Lü, they ordered, "Immediately contact all sentry posts to investigate the formation's status!"

"Yes!"

Gongsun Lü produced a stack of message talismans, whispered into them, and scattered them outward. The slips flew like snowflakes to various district supervisors.

Soon, replies flooded back:

"Report! Scripture Pavilion normal."
"Report! Beast Garden undisturbed."
"Report! Herb Fields secure."
"Report! Forge operational."
"Report! Guest mansion... empty??"

"Eh???"

Elder Gongsun Lü immediately sensed trouble, urgently inquiring about the demonic delegation's whereabouts while dispatching a team with elder tokens to inspect the forbidden caves housing spiritual veins.

"Reconnoiter!"

Ten breaths later, just as the protective formation resumed operation and more reports arrived, an unsettling sound of tearing fabric began resonating through the estate.

"Zzzzt~ Zzzzt~"

Seasoned formation experts among the clan recognized it immediately—someone was forcibly breaching their defenses during the brief lapse!

This was the formation's death throes under devastating assault!

"A formation master is breaking our defenses!"

Now even the family head and grand elder couldn't remain composed. Their protective formation was the clan's lifeline! Moreover, with Elder Mang's critical teleportation underway, any disruption would bring catastrophic consequences.

"Find them! Now!"

Message talismans flew madly as clan members conducted frantic searches. Their efficiency proved remarkable—within five breaths, word came from the southeastern training grounds:

"Report! Demonic envoys spotted at southeast edge! Their leader is breaching the formation with alarming progress! And they seem to have—urk~ *thud*!"

The message ended abruptly, the talisman splattered with blood. The scout had been killed mid-report, but the warning was delivered.

Fifteen breaths had passed since the initial disturbance. Gongsun Lü, aghast, mobilized elders to investigate while the family leaders erupted in fury.

These demons dared kill on their turf?

Before they could retaliate, the invaders struck first?

"Stay here! We'll handle this!"

The two Golden Core ancestors soared skyward, streaking toward the southeast. At their full speed, crossing the estate took mere moments.

There, they spotted over twenty shadowy figures clustered around a skeleton that was—impossibly—prying open a man-sized gap in their formation!

"Audacious demons! Halt!"

Their thunderous roar shook the estate. The intruders startled like frightened rabbits.

Exactly twenty breaths had passed since the disturbance began.

Black Skeleton Monarch strained to maintain the gap, effectively wrestling against the entire clan formation and its spiritual vein. The pressure was unimaginable.

"Move! I can only hold this for five breaths!"

The underlings scrambled through the breach, stealing glances at Lin Shan and the skeleton.

Lin Shan couldn't flee—the approaching Golden Core experts had already unleashed attacks. Without someone covering their escape, none would survive.

Black Skeleton Monarch's timing proved eerily precise—the enemies arrived exactly as predicted.

Ignoring his panicking subordinates, Lin Shan activated his long-prepared trump card—the "Blazing Wildfire Talisman," a minor divine ability equivalent to a full-powered strike from a late Golden Core expert.

This talisman, obtained during his early Foundation Establishment days as insurance for joining the Black Lotus Sect, was his last resort in this life-or-death crisis.

With the demonic frontline collapsing and righteous forces encircling them, survival hinged on this moment.

The Gongsun ancestors' attacks—two streak-like magic treasures—streaked across the sky, aimed squarely at the breach. Having decided to eliminate rather than capture, they showed no mercy.

Golden Core veterans of centuries knew better than to hesitate.

As Lin Shan activated the crimson talisman, its intricate patterns connected without fanfare—only a hair-thin red line flashed out.

"Fizzle~"

The talisman spontaneously combusted, ashes slipping through his fingers.

Silence.

Nothing happened.

"???"

Time seemed frozen. The incoming attacks drew nearer while his men squeezed through the gap. Their ultimate defense had fizzled.

Even Black Skeleton Monarch was stunned—what kind of faulty talisman self-destructs before activation? In all its multiversal travels, it had never seen such garbage!

Lin Shan's mind blanked. Had the enhancement system scammed him?

Panicking, he fumbled for escape talismans while Black Skeleton Monarch, seeing the situation, abandoned all pretense and shoved aside scrambling underlings to flee first.

The subordinates, realizing their escape route was collapsing, turned on each other in desperation. Surprisingly, the usually meek Elder Zhong displayed shocking strength, slapping aside the skeletal monarch to escape first!

"!!!"

Everyone gaped. Even Lin Shan paused mid-action.

Black Skeleton Monarch lay dazed, its soul fire flickering unsteadily—how had a Qi Condensation elder overpowered it?

But survival took priority. The mob surged through the shrinking gap while Lin Shan activated a wind-escape talisman—he didn't need to crawl, able to flash through directly.

Just as chaos peaked—

A blazing light erupted in the sky, outshining all else. A crimson star rose, its radiance painting heaven and earth in fiery hues.

The entire Gongsun estate, regardless of protective or teleportation formations, paled before this brilliance. Within moments, dozens of miles became a sea of red and gold.

Every clansman looked up, faces glowing crimson under the oppressive heat. The very air simmered as fire灵气疯涌.

Flame threads wove through space, converging toward the central star. An immense firenet unfolded across the estate.

People's hair curled from heat, clothes ignited spontaneously, and sweat poured like rivers. Vegetation burst into flames; buildings burned uncontrollably. Spiritual beasts rampaged through breached enclosures, while precious herb gardens became infernos.

The two Golden Core ancestors watched helplessly as their estate became hellscape. Before they could react, their magic treasures—the Cloud-Piercing Shuttles—were repelled violently, damaging their spiritual connections and drawing blood.

Then the crimson star, having absorbed sufficient energy, began its final act.

"BOOM!!!!"

The cataclysmic explosion sent shockwaves rippling outward, followed by a meteor shower of flames. The Gongsun clansmen scattered like ants, their home collapsing around them.

Amidst the pandemonium, twenty-odd figures crawled from the southeastern breach, coughing smoke from scorched lungs. Behind them, their handiwork raged—a fiery apocalypse.

Outside, the moon shone serenely. The contrast was surreal.

"Who's left? Anyone?" Lin Shan's triumphant laughter broke the silence. His gamble had paid off—the enhancement system never failed!

His followers, recovering, showered him with praise while Black Skeleton Monarch, unusually diligent, modified the formation to lock the Gongsun inside and erased their traces.

With practiced ease, it dismantled skeleton soldiers from its banner, assembling a bone skiff engraved with flight arrays.

As they boarded, laughing recklessly, none spared a thought for the devastation left behind.

After all—why care about wildfires after escaping the blaze?
