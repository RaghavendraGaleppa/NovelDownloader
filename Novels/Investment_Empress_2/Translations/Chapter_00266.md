# Chapter 266: Throwing a Giant Whale, The Ice Cube’s Gaze (Part 1/2)

Before the docks.

The Whale Clan Princess, Guo Jing, and her clansmen were still blocking the way. A group of burly Whale Clan brothers stood in the middle of the road. If one didn’t know the truth, they would never guess this was a proposal team; it looked more like a highway robbery.

“Excuse me, thank you.”

Sky Flood Dragon Little Li took a step to the left.

The Whale Clan demons followed suit, shifting to the left.

Sky Flood Dragon Little Li took a step to the right.

The Whale Clan demons followed to the right.

“......”

Li Mo was a bit drunk on the situation.

It was clear the Whale Clan wasn’t going to let him go easily. What should he do?

Try to reason with them?

Look at the "wisdom" in the eyes of the Whale Clan; their brains were probably filled with nothing but muscle. Did they look like they could be reasoned with?

“What do you want? Let’s settle this!”

Li Mo abandoned the polite approach of the "polite first, violent later" strategy.

After all, Aunt Wu was here, and they were under the Suspended Temple, so there was no need to worry about safety.

“Simple!”

Princess Guo Jing raised her noodle-roller-like finger, pointing at Li Mo, then at herself.

“You and I, a contest of strength! The stronger one decides the outcome!”

“Alright!”

Li Mo didn’t want to get entangled here and nodded without hesitation.

The surrounding demons instinctively leaned back tactically.

Even the couple, Wu Qing and Murong Feng, were stunned for a moment.

Everyone knew what the Whale Clan’s strength meant among the Southern Border demons.

Legend has it that before the era of the Great Merchant Dynasty, there were several immortal islands outside the South Sea. Each island was about one-tenth the size of the Southern Border and could move freely.

Why?

Because they weren't islands at all; they were ancestors of the Whale Clan carrying land on their backs!

Although Guo Jing wasn’t old, her bloodline had reverted to its origins, making her a top talent among her peers in the Whale Clan.

However, our Sky Flood Dragon Little Li was no weakling either; he had the glorious record of smashing the head of the Xiangliu Clan’s young clan leader!

“You are the first peer of mine to dare compete with me in strength.”

Guo Jing was very serious.

Li Mo looked at her flexing biceps and said with a black line on his head, “How do we compete?”

“Naturally, the fairest and most just Whale Clan tradition: Tug-of-war!”

“Tradition?”

Speaking of the powerful seniors of her clan, Guo Jing’s face was filled with reverence and longing.

It was said that there was once a river where a very delicious fish would enter the sea, but the land where the river was located spanned the territories of two Fourth Grade Whale Demon Kings.

So, the two Demon Kings wrapped ropes around themselves and pulled on one side of the land each.

They agreed that whoever could pull the river's estuary into their territory would get the food in the future.

“Later, the land was split in two by them. This is the principle of the two whales having no fish to eat, telling us to懂得團結 (understand unity).”

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, feeling that the Whale Clan’s principles were too simple and unadorned.

It was a good thing he hadn't tried to reason with them.

“What do we use for the tug-of-war?”

“You don’t have to worry about that.”

Guo Jing waved her hand, and several clansmen carried out a deep-sea heavy copper rope, thick as an adult man's wrist.

“Come on!”

“Alright!”

Li Mo grabbed the copper rope and couldn't even hold it completely with both hands.

Immediately after, a force came, pulling the rope taut.

To be honest, Guo Jing didn't think Wu Mo’s strength could be greater than hers. After all, even if the Ming Flood Dragon bloodline was strong, it didn't focus on physique. So, when she tested him, she didn't use her full power from the start.

But what surprised her even more was that the Ming Flood Dragon youth opposite her didn't budge an inch.

She was already preparing to use her full power.

“Actually, with this strength of yours, we can decide things together in the future.”

“?... Didn't we agree that if I win, you take your clansmen and let me pass?”

“No, if I win, you come with me; if you win, I come with you! Our Whale Clan’s rules have always been like this, *sob*...”

“Sob your head!!”

*Boom——*

A vast force erupted like a volcano.

A dark Splitting Sea Dragon Whale phantom instantly appeared behind Guo Jing, helping her burst with full power. Even the deep-sea heavy copper rope emitted white smoke.

But... the thing pulling her felt like an entire world.

“???”

Guo Jing felt a strong sense of weightlessness.

Then she flew out like a shot put, quickly turning into a small black dot.

“Princess!”

The Whale Clan members all chased after her.

“Phew...”

Sky Flood Dragon Little Li shaded his eyes with his hand, confirming that the other party wouldn't be back for a while, before letting out a sigh.

*Hiss...*

Not just the aquatic demons, but the surrounding demons all sucked in a cold breath simultaneously, causing the temperature at the docks to drop sharply.

This power?

It wasn't just stronger than the Whale Princess; it was a complete crushing. She was actually thrown away!

They had long known this Sky Flood Dragon Wu Mo was extraordinary, but they all subconsciously thought it was due to his powerful bloodline.

But to have such strength as well...

The Ming Flood Dragon clansmen who came with Wu Qing and Murong Feng were a bit dazed, momentarily forgetting to stop the crowd of demons swarming around.

Well, they probably couldn't stop them even if they tried.

“I早就說 (I told you so), the True Dragon bloodline he possesses isn't just a trace!”

“A peerless Sky Flood Dragon, truly worthy of the name!”

“This is not just the future of the Ming Flood Dragon Clan, but the future of our Water Clan!”

“No wonder he dared to claim he could defeat the Green Luan Goddess!”

“We thought the Bird Clan had produced a Green Luan Goddess, and we had no hope left. Fate is truly wonderful. Wu Mo can definitely rival her!”

The aquatic demons became even more boiling with excitement.

They were even more excited. Wu Mo is so young and has such a presence. If he obtains the Heaven-External Divine Jade, wouldn't that be incredible?

Moreover, with his strength, the probability of him winning the Divine Jade was extremely high!

“True Dragon... How is that possible...”

“But if he doesn't have a True Dragon presence, how could he achieve such a degree?”

Vairochana’s emotionless golden eyes rippled with a strong fluctuation of greed.

He wasn't the only godson.

If he devoured Wu Mo...

He was almost driven by instinct to stand in front of Li Mo.

“?”

Seeing this scene, our peerless Sky Flood Dragon Little Li couldn't help but feel his scalp go numb, realizing the seriousness of the situation.

Let's just say.

Other water demons coming up to stop him and ask for marriage, that is somewhat understandable.

What are you, a bird, doing coming up? And it’s a male bird!

Does anything match, whether it's species or gender?

Now, not only are the females of the Water Clan surrounding him, but the males of the Bird Clan have started to participate too?

“Wait!”

“I solemnly declare that I already have someone in my heart. I am a traditional flood dragon!”

Li Mo shouted loudly.

The scene went silent instantly, so quiet you could hear a pin drop.

But it was probably, maybe, perhaps... not because of his words?

Because all the demons looked up at the sky, their expressions either solemn or stunned.

A shadow with wings covered someone.

Little Li suddenly felt a chill down his back. This familiar sense of oppression...

He looked back.

“Hmm?”

The girl’s black hair flowed like a waterfall, and her green feathers shone with brilliance, making her stand out from the surrounding Green Luan Clan.

She wore a long green feather skirt, standing in the sunlight. Her jade-like skin and bone structure made the dust and light seem cold, and her figure turned the phrase "graceful as a startled swan" into a concrete reality before his eyes.

Her jade-like face was cold, standing out even among the Green Luan Clan, who were known for their beauty. A faint green divine pattern between her eyebrows flickered, vaguely revealing a more noble and sacred aura.

The girl looked down with an expressionless face, her colorful eyes appearing quiet and cold.

The pressure was terrifying!

It was simply suffocating!

Yes, who was she staring at?

The eyes of the water demons converged.

Li Mo: “!”
