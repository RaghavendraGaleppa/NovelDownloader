# Chapter 228: The Tattered Cloth Gives Birth

"Uncertain. It's just a small earthen city, but legends say that city had walls of white jade and was massive!"

According to the records in "Kunling Divine Bestiary," the divine cicada and other near-immortal creatures all fled after seeing that city. Therefore, these patriarchs didn't want to get too involved. After discussion, they prepared to sever this passage.

Soon, they cut off the connection between the six divine coffins and the tattered cloth.

"Do even quasi-divine beings struggle against the ravages of time? They've all decayed."

At this moment, they opened one coffin. A creature with a human head and snake body, emitting a strong stench of decay, was almost completely rotted away.

"It's simply because these corpses have been constantly supplying power to the passage, almost draining themselves dry."

Once the connection between the six divine coffins and the tattered cloth was severed, the latter drifted down like a fallen leaf. Instantly, several large hands reached out to grab it. Cao Qianqiu even thrust out his long spear, inscribed with divine symbols.

However, four palms simultaneously struck him, causing him to let out a muffled groan, blood trickling from the corner of his mouth. His face darkened. Ever since his return from Black and White Mountain, he'd been plagued by misfortune. Even with this spear, suspected to be related to a deity, he had been wounded repeatedly.

Qin Ming was somewhat dissatisfied; this was already his second time entering the colossal palace. In fact, the other survivors also had strong feelings of resentment. Were they truly being treated as cannon fodder?

“For the third time, who is willing to go in? Additional compensation will be given,” an old man from the Great Yu Dynasty asked.

After Qin Ming had rested long enough, he thought about it and prepared to volunteer. His tattered cloth was still inside, and calculating the time, if he didn't retrieve it soon, Yao Ruoxian would personally make an appearance, and retrieving it then might be very troublesome. The most crucial point was that the overwhelming shadowy mist in the colossal palace was no longer as dense. He estimated that the tattered cloth had finished absorbing the essence.

“Three thousand Daygold coins, plus a unique cultivation art,” the Great Yu people readily offered Qin Ming.

Qin Ming smiled, finally feeling much more at ease. This time, he chose the "Wind Control Scripture." No matter what, this time he had reaped immense rewards, acquiring two unique cultivation arts in a single day. Even though he had recently stepped into the Outer Saint realm, he wouldn't have to worry about not having new unique cultivation arts to practice.

An old man generously declared, “Young man, your archery skills are divine. This time, we will give you thirty-six arrows forged from a blend of jade and iron!” Many people were satisfied with this divine archer, already knowing that his clearing work was the most efficient.

“Princess, it was him! He shaved my head bald, how detestable!” Beside Yao Ruoxian, the four-winged bird fumed, wearing a small red cap to cover its bald spot.

After Qin Ming charged in this time, continuously shooting down half-rotted fierce ghosts, he found an opportunity to travel through the black mist, leaving his companions behind. With buildings obstructing the view of the old experts outside, he approached the pond. Indeed, the inky-black pond water had become clear and transparent, like plain water, no longer impenetrable like ink.

Qin Ming could clearly feel that the tattered cloth had grown larger by a full circle, especially in the area with black mist, where the increase was obvious, resembling a world of night.

“Splash!”

As soon as he picked the tattered cloth out of the water, he saw it violently shake. Then, to his astonishment, he saw a second piece of tattered cloth leap out after it. He suspected he was seeing things. What kind of pond was this? Was the tattered cloth actually giving birth here?! Soon, Qin Ming confirmed that a second, smaller piece of tattered cloth had indeed appeared. He was dumbfounded. Was this pond connected to the Mother-Child River?

***

In a dangerous, overlapping space, Cao Qianqiu was enraged. Although he had been very unlucky recently, with various accidents occurring frequently, his luck had truly been good just now. When multiple patriarchs attacked together, the tattered cloth flew towards him, and he managed to snatch it, clenching it in his hand. He clearly felt that this item was far from simple; no matter how much power he infused, he couldn't damage the cloth in the slightest.

However, at a crucial moment, the seemingly still tattered cloth suddenly gave a violent shudder, broke free from his Pure Yang spiritual light, and plunged into the earth's ley lines. The very thing he had just acquired had flown away on its own! At the same time, several patriarchs had already attacked, jointly striking Cao Qianqiu, seeking to seize the mysterious tattered cloth.

Qin Ming confirmed that it wasn't that absurd; the tattered cloth couldn't reproduce. This was a new piece of cloth that had voluntarily come to him! In an instant, the two pieces of cloth connected, merging into a single entity. An additional palm-sized area appeared, revealing new scenery. He didn't look closely and quickly put it away.

Originally, he had been somewhat regretful about not resonating with any special scriptures here, but now his mind was completely at peace. Two unique cultivation arts plus the second piece of tattered cloth – his gains from this trip were enormous, more than enough!

As he continued to draw his bow and shoot down monsters, his hairs suddenly stood on end. He felt the surrounding yin energy thicken, indicating the appearance of even more powerful ancients. Qin Ming knew what was happening. Yao Ruoxian had personally arrived, rushing to the poolside, sweeping away and crushing the monsters that were previously there. And she had already discovered the black treasure seal entwined with characters in the pond.

Qin Ming turned and ran. It was clear that something big was about to happen here. Indeed, as soon as he rushed out, chaos erupted in the colossal palace. Yao Ruoxian took the black seal, thousands of black lights emanating from her palm, and she also uprooted the rare ghost medicine, incurring the wrath of all. Even the slumbering old ghosts were roused.

In an instant, this area was filled with the wails of ghosts and howls of spirits, malicious energy surged sky-high, and it completely erupted. Not only in the colossal palace, but even the ground of the original ruined temple cracked open, and shadowy figures of monsters burrowed out from the dark earth, rushing towards the crowd to attack.

Yao Ruoxian rushed out. She was definitely someone beyond the Second Realm, with profound cultivation and brilliant spiritual consciousness. Carrying her spoils, she fought her way outside and was immediately protected by a group of old experts. Everyone started to flee frantically! Because this was no ordinary area; with so many buildings, it was undoubtedly a vital stronghold for ghost cultivators.

Qin Ming felt that something was wrong. Some of the old ghosts were too terrifying, their yin energy soaring to the heavens, their cultivation realms frighteningly high. He certainly couldn't run as fast as Yao Ruoxian and that group of old experts; if he followed them, he would definitely become a scapegoat. He immediately did the opposite. Seeing several young ghost monsters, he actively went to meet them, and then very deliberately let them knock him to the ground. Qin Ming used his dim Heaven's Light to protect himself, allowing them to pounce and gnaw at him. Of course, separated by a layer of light barrier, these ghostly creatures couldn't actually harm him.

As expected, he was temporarily safe. When those old ghosts saw him pinned down, none of them paid him any mind, all rushing into the distance to pursue stronger enemies. Qin Ming couldn't just wait there. Carrying the six small ghosts clinging to him, he ran in the direction where no old ghosts were pursuing. He planned to take a detour to leave the boundless black mist of the Kunling domain. Along the way, sensing the surging malicious energy of an old ghost, he immediately threw himself to the ground, letting the six small ghosts pounce and bite him. Qin Ming, along his journey, alternated between running and stopping, carrying ghosts as he went.

During this time, he was astonished to discover a fellow traveler: an old man from the Great Yu Dynasty, covered in blood and heavily wounded, running with an old ghost clinging to his back. However, the old man was unlucky; another old ghost was still chasing him from behind, not giving up on him. Clearly, this person didn't have the strength to carry two ghosts while running. Such old ghosts were extremely formidable; it seemed they were at least in the Third Realm.

Seeing this, Qin Ming actively fell to the ground and stayed still. What made his heart turn cold was that the old man, acting completely inhumane, ran towards him with the two old ghosts, and upon getting close, even kicked several small ghosts to pieces. Qin Ming was shocked and enraged. He had already done his best for Great Yu, yet this old man was so sinister, trying to expose him to take the fall for him. Fortunately, the old ghosts didn't care for him and continued to pursue the old man from Great Yu, not stopping their steps.

Qin Ming gnashed his teeth. That old bastard was too malicious, acting like this for no reason, with no prior enmity. He quickly re-attached two small ghosts, whose bodies were half-torn but still alive, back onto himself. For the sake of survival, he couldn't be too picky. He chose a safe path again; he had to leave quickly. The inhumane old experts here were even more dangerous.

Not far away, deafening roars echoed. The old man and the two old ghosts were fighting desperately, a life-or-death struggle.

A moment later, Qin Ming felt something was off. The surroundings were quiet, yet his hairs stood on end. He suddenly looked back and discovered a blood-soaked figure silently approaching.

“Senior, congratulations on slaying two fierce ghosts consecutively, a glorious achievement!” Qin Ming spoke, but cursed inwardly. It was actually the same old man from before. Although this fellow didn't dare to carry two ghosts, he had fought desperately and emerged victorious.

The old man was covered in wounds, swaying precariously. His chest and abdomen had been split open, forcefully closed with secret arts, and there was even a bloody hole in his glabella. He had paid a terrible price. He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said, “Heh heh, young man, you truly have composure. Alright, hand over all the gold notes on you. Twice now, that's a total of five thousand Daygold coins. A truly tempting sum.”

Qin Ming said grimly, “Senior, I risked life and limb, exerting myself for Great Yu, and in the end, you want to treat me like this?” He was furious inwardly. This old man not only tried to harm him earlier, but now he wanted to seize his assets. It was clear that he wouldn't spare his life in the end; he would definitely silence him.

The old man chuckled faintly, “This is my own will, it has nothing to do with Great Yu. Oh, right, you still have two unique cultivation arts on you, don't you? Hand them over too. My good-for-nothing grandson is as useless as you; he can only take the path of a beginner, so I'll take them back for him to practice.”

Qin Ming wanted to cleave him in two. This old man not only wanted to murder him but also disparaged him like this. What kind of character was that?

The old man walked closer, saying, “What, are you still not convinced? Hand over the items, and I might consider sparing you.” Undoubtedly, he wouldn't let Qin Ming go. He was merely afraid Qin Ming would tear up the gold notes or destroy the unique cultivation arts, so he wanted to stabilize him first. “Don't even think about resisting. A mere Outer Saint like you is utterly incapable of fighting a Third Realm expert. You'll be instantly killed,” the old man said calmly. He knew Qin Ming's archery was astonishing, but at such close range, the other party wouldn't even have time to draw his bow and shoot an arrow. Most critically, he had witnessed the other party's Heaven's Light energy. Although extraordinary, it wasn't on par with the Tathagata or Jade Purity energies. Even with his severe injuries, this young man was nothing to worry about.

Qin Ming gripped his saber hilt, though he didn't draw it from its sheath for now. He said, “Senior, you're quite badly wounded. And in this state, you still want to intercept and kill me?”

“Heh, even if my cultivation is less than one-tenth of its peak, you are still far from my match. Don't dream of miracles or turning the tide.”

The old man felt the distance was sufficient. Suddenly, a spiritual light of consciousness, tinged with Pure Yang attributes, shot out from his glabella, slashing towards Qin Ming. In normal times, he wouldn't need to be this close. But now, he was severely wounded by two fierce ghosts and extremely weak. He wanted to erupt but couldn't, because his frontal bone was cracked, with a bloody hole. He groaned in pain, quickly retreating.

However, at such close range, the young man followed closely, his saber light like a rainbow, striking directly. The old man's spiritual light of consciousness was incinerated, throwing his mind into chaos.

With a 'thwack,' the old man was struck by the saber. Although he avoided a vital spot, one of his arms was severed and flew off.

“Is that all?” Qin Ming was stunned. Earlier, his heart had been pounding, and he had even prepared to fight to the death. After all, he had a very clear understanding of Third Realm experts; currently, he truly couldn't defeat them. Now, he immediately understood that the opponent's power was indeed less than one-tenth of its peak.

The old man was shocked and enraged. He was actually about to suffer an unexpected defeat, and turned to flee. Qin Ming sneered, drawing his bow and firing an arrow. The jade-iron arrow, carrying his strongest Heaven's Light, pierced the old man's leg with a 'thump,' instantly blasting a bloody hole in that area.

In an instant, Qin Ming rushed over. The old man was filled with remorse, wanting to say something, but the young man's momentum was like a rainbow, and the terrifying Heaven's Light energy, swinging with the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber, cut off his words. He hastily countered, using all his methods. In the end, he could only shriek. One of his ears fell off, and another arm was severed, blood gushing out.

Actually, Qin Ming had intended to cleave him straight down, but he had dodged it. If once wasn't enough, he would land another blow. Eight dazzling lights flowed around his body, as if he were covered in divine rings. Holding his saber, he charged past. With a 'thwack,' this time the old man's body was split in half, completely bisected.

Qin Ming stood at a distance, sheathing his saber.
