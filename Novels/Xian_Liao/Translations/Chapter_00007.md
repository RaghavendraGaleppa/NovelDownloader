# Chapter 7: The Courtyard Residence  

After his initial excitement subsided, Zhou Qing began to reflect.  

It had taken him just over ten days to master the Tiger Form of the Five Animal Frolics, increasing his lifespan by one year. While this seemed like rapid progress, the reality was more nuanced.  

For an average person with adequate nutrition and proper health practices, living to seventy was quite common. Zhou Qing's current body was not yet fifteen, yet his remaining lifespan was only thirty-one years—totaling less than forty-six. This was clearly abnormal, stemming from the body's inherent deficiencies and frailty.  

Practicing the Tiger Form, with its focus on strengthening the body, coupled with recent improvements in his diet, had begun to repair these deficiencies. This was essentially a process of restoration. Moreover, the faint, peculiar warmth generated during his practice seemed to have a transformative effect on his constitution.  

His rapid progress in both Black Tiger Fist and the Tiger Form was not solely due to the influence of his "Nourishing the Primordial" ability but also his deep understanding and imitation of tigers. With his exceptional memory, he could effortlessly recall the appearance, movements, and essence of real tigers.  

The Tiger Form itself was derived from observing tigers' habits and movements, but few practitioners had such firsthand knowledge. Cats being similar to tigers, some martial artists even studied feline behavior to refine their tiger-style techniques.  

"When I visualize a tiger's habits and movements, I seem to grasp its essence effortlessly," Zhou Qing mused. "It feels more like a meditative practice, almost like invoking a spirit—except instead of summoning a deity, I'm summoning a tiger. That's why, when practicing the full Five Animal Frolics, the other four forms lack the same depth as the Tiger Form."  

He recalled a line from martial arts literature: *"Intentional yet unintentional—the true intent lies between."* Now, Zhou Qing pondered this phrase with newfound understanding.  

It seemed his practice of the Tiger Form and Black Tiger Fist had inadvertently captured this "true intent." Grasping the core essence allowed him to progress smoothly under the guidance of "Nourishing the Primordial."  

Regardless, his current achievements were a testament to his efforts.  

However, his body was still not strong enough. Even with proper technique, the killing power of "Black Tiger Seizes the Heart" was considerable, but in a real fight, a single failed strike would leave him with no second chance. Moreover, the move's explosive force drained his stamina, making it unsuitable for prolonged combat.  

In actual combat, distance management was crucial—what boxers called "punching range." Controlling this distance depended largely on footwork.  

"While the Tiger Form and Black Tiger Fist include footwork, they're not as specialized as the Deer Form," Zhou Qing reasoned. "The Deer Form focuses on leg training. I should progress step by step—first fists, then legs."  

He recalled a movie that outlined martial arts training principles: *"First fists, then legs, followed by grappling, weapons, and internal cultivation."* This sequence seemed to align with the Five Animal Frolics.  

His university instructor had once explained: *"The Tiger Form gives rise to fist techniques, the Deer Form to legwork and lightness skills, the Bear Form to body conditioning, the Bird Form to swordsmanship, and the Ape Form to breath control."* This mirrored the movie's principles, suggesting a shared foundation in traditional martial arts.  

Though much of this ancient wisdom was outdated in modern society, its survival indicated inherent value.  

With limited resources, Zhou Qing could only rely on his memory to extract useful insights. Fortunately, his enhanced recall allowed him to connect keywords with past knowledge, preventing blind experimentation. His background in classical Chinese literature also granted him broad exposure to ancient texts, now amplified by his extraordinary memory.  

Knowledge was truly power.  

With his new goal set, Zhou Qing resolved to intensify his Deer Form training. However, leg exercises required more space, and his current dwelling was inadequate.  

The state examinations were scheduled for autumn, while spring was just ending. Examiner Lu Ya was overseeing the provincial exams for Jiangzhou Circuit—the "circuit" referring to the administrative division under the broader Tiannan Route, akin to a modern province.  

Jiangzhou Circuit governed four prefectures, including its namesake, while the Western Mountain Circuit, with its rugged terrain and tribal influences, lagged behind in scholarly achievement.  

During yesterday's banquet, Zhou Qing learned that Examiner Lu planned to inspect rural schools in the coming weeks before proceeding with the exams. By autumn, the results would determine admissions to Jiangzhou's state academy.  

As the top candidate personally selected by the examiner, Zhou Qing's presence at Hu Village's school would leave a strong impression. Local officials valued well-run village schools as proof of effective governance, potentially justifying tax relief.  

Thus, the village elders hoped Zhou Qing would retain his teaching position until after the inspection.  

For Zhou Qing, this was mutually beneficial. With his newfound status, his path forward had widened considerably.

The next morning, Zhou Qing sought out Butcher Hu.  

"Master Zhou!" The butcher's apprentices greeted him with deference—a scholar's status commanded respect among commoners.  

"Brother Hu, don't stand on ceremony," Zhou Qing said warmly. "I haven't forgotten your help. But I must impose on you again."  

Delighted, Butcher Hu assured him, "Name it!"  

Zhou Qing explained his plan to sell his cramped alleyway home and rent a larger property.  

After a moment's thought, Butcher Hu said, "I'll buy your old place—it'll house my apprentices and store goods. As for a rental, what size are you thinking?"  

"A courtyard residence," Zhou Qing replied. "My current home is stifling in summer, damp and noisy. I need quiet space for study."  

Butcher Hu nodded. "I know just the place. By evening, I'll have an answer."

That evening, Butcher Hu returned with news.  

"The courtyard fits your needs—spacious, quiet, near the west gate. Rent's cheap too: fifty coppers monthly."  

Zhou Qing frowned. "Why so low?"  

Butcher Hu lowered his voice. "It's near the outskirts, remote but close to Hu Village. The catch? They say it's haunted."  

As a butcher, unshaken by superstition, he added, "No deaths, just strange noises at night. The owner, Squire Lin, moved out years ago. Servants refuse to stay long. They've had exorcisms, but the sounds persist."  

Zhou Qing's interest piqued. The Lin family—the same who'd purchased his poem.  

"Let's see it tonight," he decided.  

Butcher Hu agreed. "I'll stay with you. If anything lurks there, my butcher's aura will scare it off."  

Confident in his tiger visualization and "Nourishing the Primordial," Zhou Qing was ready to face the unknown.  

They set off, arriving at a weathered gate. A towering mulberry tree dominated the courtyard, its canopy majestic.  

"This is it," Butcher Hu said, admiring the tree—a symbol of prosperity.  

If Zhou Qing thrived here, perhaps greatness awaited them both.
