# Chapter 513: This Is My Dao Path!

“How do you intend to compensate?”

True Monarch Pudu continued, his voice unhurried.

“This treasure tree of mine was cultivated by this Monarch using the essence of various Heavenly and Terrestrial Calamities. I nourished it with my Nascent Soul for nine thousand seven hundred years before finally obtaining this immortal root capable of bearing the Fruit of Origin. The rare treasures and the spiritual essence poured into it—how can it be compared to ordinary objects? It carries a trace of the Dao Rhyme of the Nine Heavens responding to thunder. Destroying this tree is like severing my Dao path and damaging the foundation of my Primordial Origin Sect!”

If he were still in the early stage of the Golden Core realm, he would indeed be as dependent on the fruit as True Monarch Pudu claimed. However, now that he had reached the mid-stage of the Golden Core realm, his stabilized Inner World made him less reliant on the status granted by a Fruit.

Although this treasure tree was precious, to him, it was merely so-so.

He looked at the increasingly solemn expression of Bodhisattva Miaodi, and his tone suddenly shifted.

“Bodhisattva Miaodi, since you speak of sincere apology... then this Monarch demands that you leave the Bodhi Zen Pure Land, come to my immortal mountain to serve as a Guardian General, and submit to my command for a thousand years!”

As soon as these words fell, Sanzang felt his vision go dark, while Sun Wukong was so shocked his monkey hair stood on end.

This was no longer compensation; this was an undisguised attempt to enslave a Great Bodhisattva of the Buddhist Sect. It was the ultimate trampling of the dignity of the Bodhi Zen Pure Land.

It was clear that the other party had no intention of settling this amicably.

“You!”

The dignified expression on Bodhisattva Miaodi’s face finally completely broke. A flush of shock and fury shot from her neck straight to her hairline.

“As expected of the Primordial Origin Sect. You have certainly opened this Seat’s eyes.”

Miaodi’s expression rapidly turned icy cold.

True Monarch Pudu laughed heartily at the sight. “Good, you no longer call yourself ‘monk’ but ‘this Seat’.”

A powerful pressure from the Bodhisattva’s Golden Body erupted uncontrollably from her body, crashing against the hazy immortal light surrounding True Monarch Pudu.

Invisible momentum exploded in mid-air, causing the ground of the entire courtyard to heave like waves.

The Zhenyuan Temple manifested layers of restrictions, yet they could not stop the rockery from crumbling or the pavilions from groaning.

He took a step forward, the hazy immortal light boiling like steam. “Since the Bodhisattva is unwilling to degrade herself to a slave to compensate... then I shall see what you have to offer to replace my Heavenly and Terrestrial Calamity Peach Tree. What will you use to wash away the blood injustice of my Dao Child? What will you use to堵 the mouths of the masses?”

The hazy immortal light surrounding True Monarch Pudu was no longer ethereal and otherworldly; it was now burning fiercely like the boiling magma of the Nine Nethers, emitting a terrifying hissing sound. Even the surrounding void seemed unable to bear this terrifying pressure, silently being burned through and twisted.

The entire Zhenyuan Temple, this solemn Dao Field supported by the magical restrictions of True Monarch Pudu, groaned under the unbearable burden. The profound runes covering the pavilions, rockeries, and ponds were like thin paper thrown into a raging fire, crying out inch by inch and crumbling away.

The remaining carved beams and exquisite stalagmites, under this overwhelming pressure, vanished instantly without even leaving a speck of dust.

Bodhisattva Miaodi, standing at the forefront, saw her protective golden Buddha halo fluctuate violently under the照射 of this hazy light, emitting a harsh “creaking” sound, as if it would be crushed completely by this terrifying force at any moment.

That dignified and compassionate Bodhisattva face could no longer maintain its detachment.

Bodhisattva Miaodi’s heart was tossed in a storm of waves. The speed and determination with which the other party tore off the mask of civility far exceeded her expectations, and the other party’s strength was beyond her imagination.

Seeing the other party’s arrogance surging with no intention of stopping or holding back, and even the hint of cold calculation that shouldn't belong to “anger” completely pierced her last hesitation.

This matter had perfectly fallen into the other party’s trap.

Bodhisattva Miaodi sneered, no longer caring about her face.

The Bodhi Zen Pure Land and the Primordial Origin Sect were inherently enemies. One is Buddhist, the other is demonic; who could tolerate whom?

“Good, True Monarch Pudu, good, the true lineage of the Xuan Sect. Even if you have changed your skin and received the title of the Nine Immortal Mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect, deep down you are still playing the Primordial Origin Sect’s tricks of ‘plucking the sky bare and stripping the hair from a passing goose,’ extorting and sucking the marrow. It is right and proper to destroy this demonic tree of yours. It saves you from using its sweet temptations of Heavenly and Terrestrial Calamities to bewitch the Eastern Wilderness and lure people to fall.”

These words completely tore through the window paper, exposing the deeds of the Primordial Origin Sect openly to the light of day.

This reprimand slapped the True Monarch’s face.

True Monarch Pudu’s face showed no anger upon hearing this; instead, his eyes revealed an emotionless indifference, like ten thousand years of ancient ice sinking to the bottom of the Nine Abyss. That gaze was no longer looking at an opponent, nor even an enemy, but like a deity from the Nine Heavens looking down upon an ant struggling in the dust.

His voice was terrifyingly calm.

“Ordinary grass and trees, what is there to say? Compensation? Hah...”

The corner of True Monarch Pudu’s mouth hooked into a faint, yet terrifyingly chilling, smile.

“Miaodi, do you really not know, or are you pretending to be confused?”

*What this Monarch truly wants is the Great Compassionate Radiant Lotus King Buddha Fruit behind you.*

True Monarch Pudu naturally wouldn't speak the latter sentence out loud. Doing something is one thing, but saying it out loud would be troublesome.

If he spoke that sentence, the next second, the World Honored One Tathagata might very well create a new account to come and cause trouble.

His sleeves fluttered without wind, snapping loudly, with surging magical power surging within.

However, he must obtain the Lotus King Buddha Fruit. Even if he cannot hold onto the Fruit itself, he must extract the origin Qi from it.

Anyone who steps onto the Golden Core Dao path knows that forming a Golden Core is merely peeking through the doorway.

To climb to the peak of the Dao, reaching the late stage of the Golden Core, one needs to find three origins that are mutually generated and have compatible Dao mechanisms, forcibly refine them into the Golden Core to forge a higher Dao foundation, and enter the late stage of the Golden Core.

And to go a step further, to seek the Nascent Soul Dao Lord, one must gather five mutually generating Dao Fruits to have a slim chance of peering into the realm of the Dao Lord who stands above all, grasping the true laws of a universe.

That Lotus King Buddha Fruit naturally contains three supreme origins: Samsara, Salvation, and the Pure Land of Ultimate Bliss.

These three origins are interlinked, making them the supreme foundation for refining more Dao Fruits. They are also the perfect key for True Monarch Pudu to break through the shackles of the late Golden Core stage and peer into a higher realm.

He had waited many years for this.

Now that the Bodhi Zen Pure Land has initiated a ritual, he naturally would not sit idly by.

“Miaodi, if you are sensible, you will voluntarily strip the origin of the Fruit and offer it to this Monarch.”

Bodhisattva Miaodi sneered, no longer pretending.

“Daydreaming?”

A cold light flashed in Pudu’s eyes, and the immortal light around him suddenly flared, like a hazy sun illuminating the world. “Today, I shall seize the root Qi of your Fruit to add fuel to this Monarch’s Dao path.”

“Whoosh!”

Before the last syllable had even faded, and before Bodhisattva Miaodi could reply, she felt her hand suddenly lighten.

The Buddhist treasure she had carried for many years, the Jade Pure Bottle, actually let out a cry of unbearable strain under the dual impact of True Monarch Pudu’s words moving the Dao rules and his immense pressure, and exploded with a bang.

The white and warm bottle fragments shattered like ice crystals, and the contained sweet dew scattered into the void, instantly evaporated by the violent storm of煞气.

“Under the Bodhi tree lies three thousand worlds. In this realm, there shall be the Vajra’s wrathful gaze!”
