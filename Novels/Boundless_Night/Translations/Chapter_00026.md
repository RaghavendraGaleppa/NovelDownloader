# Chapter 26: Faded Memories Resurface

Qin Ming noticed that his childhood self was poorly dressed, but he was soon drawn to the small book.

It was a very thin ancient book, and when opened, it revealed silk pages. Its beast-hide cover must have been added later; its color was dull, and its texture was rough and tough, used to resist the erosion of time and protect the true scriptures within.

The first page recorded the "unorthodox methods" Qin Ming had practiced, techniques he knew intimately. A low whisper sounded, reading those densely packed characters.

Then, the calloused hand turned to the second page. The script was still very small, continuing from the top. Some parts contained new characters and illustrations, which immediately captivated Qin Ming's attention, and he quickly memorized them.

Perhaps he didn't even need to memorize them; these were his faded childhood memories, and he was undergoing a second regeneration. His physical constitution had greatly improved, and his mental awareness had strengthened accordingly. He was brushing away the dust of time, allowing him to see past scenes again, re-remembering the silk scroll's contents he had already read.

Half-awake, half-dreaming, Qin Ming wanted to turn to the third page, but he couldn't. The large hand didn't help him open it.

At this point, he carefully examined the silk scroll, protected by the tough beast hide. Through the vicissitudes of time, it had long lost its original luster. Slightly yellowed, it exuded a sense of ancient beauty and accumulated the weighty aura of history.

It was indeed very thin, estimated to be only about ten to twenty pages.

Qin Ming tried to turn the page multiple times but consistently failed to open the third page.

He stopped, instead observing his younger self through the mottled flow of time, that small figure dressed in worn-out clothes. Even in his semi-conscious state, Qin Ming felt a pang. So his childhood self had lived a very poor life. His already faded small clothes had several patches, the cuffs were worn out, and looking down, his small shoes even had holes.

He sighed, thinking of his later self. In fact, his teenage years weren't much better; he had suffered from chilblains, hunger, and bore blood and injuries on his body. Two years ago, he had fallen ill outside Silver Vine Town and was brought back to Twin Tree Village.

"That year I was fourteen..." Qin Ming touched his head, near the back of his skull, where there had once been a wound that bled a lot. He realized he was awake; he wasn't touching his head in a dream. His fingers went through his black hair, touching the place that had once been bloody.

There was no scar there now; it must have disappeared during his first regeneration.

"My childhood self, my fourteen-year-old self, two special nodes, very fragmented memories. Those few faded faces often appear in my dreams." It was that year, at fourteen, that he had wandered and endured hardships, which was why he was now more mature than his peers.

Qin Ming looked outside; the heavy night was gradually receding. He walked into the courtyard, took a deep breath of the cold air, and recalled his childhood memories once more. The first two pages of the silk scroll's records were now clearly etched in his mind.

Then, he began to perform the movements he hadn't practiced before, along with the methods for regulating breathing and spirit, meticulously studying and experimenting. He stopped a long time later. His body was still hot, but it was no longer glowing, appearing relatively normal.

"That rough large hand..." Qin Ming recalled. The sleeve of the large hand was badly worn, and the hand was full of calluses, indicating that its owner lived a life as impoverished as his younger self, far from his current good circumstances. The so-called "large hand" was what his younger self perceived as large, powerful, and providing a sense of security.

He truly wished to see that small hand and large hand clasped together, to make up for the regret of not having seen his relatives for so many years.

"The second regeneration isn't over yet. Tonight, I'll continue to eat spiritual substances from the blood snakes. As my physical constitution improves, my spiritual power will also strengthen, and perhaps I can see more of the past in my subconscious, revealing more faded childhood memories."

Thinking of this, Qin Ming immediately became radiant and full of vigor. He picked up a stone grinding mill and weighed it in his hand, feeling it quite light! He roughly estimated that he could now lift a cauldron weighing fifteen hundred catties.

As the lighter hours of night arrived, Qin Ming washed his hot body. He didn't plan to hunt in the mountains today; he wanted to stay home and study the newly acquired silk scroll scriptures.

"Why was it said that it couldn't be mastered?" He hoped to see the reason in his dreams once night fell.

It was clear the silk scroll had an extraordinary origin; it had been carefully preserved, as if fearing damage.

The wind and snow stopped, and the night consequently became somewhat lighter—this was the "clear day" in an era without a sun.

Qin Ming meticulously studied the silk scroll. Although he had only seen two pages, the records on them were dense, with many small characters and illustrations. More than half of the content on the second page was new to him, a resurfaced memory that required careful contemplation, practice, and thorough comprehension.

"It's very ingenious, but unfortunately, I can't compare it with intermediate meditation techniques or advanced Yi Qi Gongs to determine its exact level."

In this remote area, Qin Ming lacked regeneration methods. Aside from the silk scroll, he had only read the widely circulated "Preliminary Explanations of Night Meditation."

The silk scroll mentioned "Heavenly Radiance," but only briefly, and it didn't explain how to cultivate "Heavenly Radiance energy," let alone the highly praised "Tathagata Force."

Qin Ming frowned. The silk scroll was undoubtedly extraordinary, but why didn't it elaborate on the very important Heavenly Radiance?

He read carefully, repeatedly practicing in the courtyard, and finally came up with some conjectures. The silk scroll aimed to convey more with the most concise strokes, suggesting that by persisting in practice, Heavenly Radiance would naturally be born within the body's flesh and blood, thereby strengthening one's essence, qi, and spirit.

However, it indeed didn't mention how to cultivate the Heavenly Radiance energy.

"The silk scroll seems to be about elevating one's life level, without specific Dao-protecting methods?" This conjecture puzzled Qin Ming a bit.

In the afternoon, when the dim light of the perpetual night was at its brightest, Qin Ming rubbed his temples. After half a day of studying, his mind was slightly fatigued, but he seemed to have thoroughly comprehended the new content on the silk scroll.

When he practiced again, he moved smoothly and without stagnation, integrating with the surrounding environment. His eyes were focused and clear, his hair swayed, and his entire being exuded a relaxed and natural demeanor.

Most importantly, the warm current within his body surged, and the silver ripples appearing on his body solidified slightly, as if transforming into "silver sludge."

The silk scroll didn't mention what level would be reached or what state would appear, so Qin Ming couldn't judge how well he was practicing.

He stopped to rest. Even standing there, he appeared spiritually natural, adding a touch of charisma.

"Little Qin, come out quickly, let's go into the mountains to admire the ruins." Xu Yueping came to call him.

Qin Ming had originally planned to contemplate the silk scroll at home, but since he had already thoroughly understood it, he could indeed go out now.

He asked, "What ruins?"

Xu Yueping laughed, "The Mountain Patrol Team's stronghold! Let's see what traces that wise mountain god – uh, no, I mean mountain monster – left there."

Then, he lowered his voice, "See if anything good was left behind."

This wasn't a sudden whim on his part; it was a decision made by the leaders of several villages who gathered secretly to discuss no longer planting "Black Moon," and together decided to visit that stronghold.

"Let's go!" Qin Ming nodded.

Recently, even the regenerators from various villages had to travel in groups of several people to dare to venture slightly deeper, otherwise, the current dense forest was extremely dangerous. Not everyone dared to roam the mountains alone like Qin Ming.

Ultimately, everything was due to strength.

"Here's a pile of fine wine!" Qin Ming called Xu Yueping. He was very familiar with this stronghold; the scene of the sword light in the snowy night still flashed before his eyes.

Xu Yueping and Yang Yongqing immediately ran over, overjoyed. The so-called "admiring the ruins" was fundamentally about seeing if anything useful was left behind. The men in the village were equally simple and unadorned.

Old Liu's wrinkled face blossomed with laughter, his legs no longer weak. He leaped half a *zhang* high and shot over with a whoosh.

Qin Ming laughed, "Grandpa Liu, how about it? Yesterday I said I'd honor you with ten jars of good wine, and today we found a whole pile. Let's quickly divide and take them!"

"Good, good, good!" Old Liu said "good" repeatedly, wishing he could break the mud seal and taste the wine right then.

"Coming to the Mountain Patrol Team's place to 'dig graves,' why does this feel so satisfying, hehe." Xu Yueping laughed continuously.

Newcomers from other villages were naturally alarmed. In the end, Twin Tree Village took over thirty jars, and the remaining smaller portion was distributed among the other villages.

Although Qin Ming discovered them, he couldn't hoard them all, to prevent trouble later. In fact, the Mountain Patrol Team's investigators had already been there and discovered these fine wines, but they had urgent duties and didn't value the wine, so they left them alone.

When the news spread that day, more people went, and the Mountain Patrol Team's stronghold was "looted" by all parties.

"Could it be this person who killed everyone in the Mountain Patrol Team?" Qin Ming was surprised when he returned from the mountains and saw a portrait. It was precisely that man with the greenish-black face. And indeed, the image of him holding a sword and slaying the blood snake was quite impressive.

Someone in Silver Vine Town sent out a stack of portraits, telling the villages to be vigilant and report any findings immediately.

The Mountain Patrol Team wasn't a soft organization; its highest-ranking member was a big figure from Crimson Cloud City.

"His name is Wang Nianzhu. He looked heroic, but I never expected him to be such a person." Qin Ming truly hadn't anticipated seeing the man's posthumous portrait and learning his name after killing him.

"You didn't die in obscurity after all. At least your portrait is being posted in every town; for a time, your name is known throughout this region, even if it's very remote." Qin Ming glanced a few times and then left. A man whose head he had already blown off wasn't worth his attention.

"However, I do hope the Mountain Patrol Team can find out which family or organization he came from." Afterward, he thought of Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect, which were also worth noting.

Late at night, after Qin Ming ate the blood snake meat, the medicinal meal's effects quickly set in. His whole body became hot and began to glow again, just like last time.

Finally, wearing his "golden-thread jade garment," he entered dreamland.

Qin Ming saw his childhood self again. Though poor, with even his small clothes and shoes tattered, he seemed to possess great perseverance, practicing the regeneration method from the silk scroll over and over again.

"Since it's of extraordinary origin, why can't it be mastered?" The young him was very stubborn and resolute, unwilling to give up.

"There was once an incredibly formidable person who practiced the method on this silk scroll and practiced himself to death, and he was even one of its creators." The large hand caressed the beast-hide cover of the silk scroll.

"Ah?" The young Qin Ming was still very naive, utterly perplexed.

"Some paths are too glorious. But for others, the prospects are unclear. A few old fellows were unwilling to accept this, so they researched together, hoping to rival those brilliant paths. The theory was sound, but in the end, they themselves abandoned their original achievements and, after changing to this method, either died, were injured, or, when their lifespan was short, traveled to the ends of the dark earth. They all couldn't master it, so how could those who came after?" The whisper echoed.

"If it can't be mastered, why leave it behind?" The child asked.

"The part that couldn't be mastered was torn off, leaving only a small portion. But even that requires assistance from someone who has practiced this method to get started. So, this silk scroll is just for looking at."

"What about the large portion that was torn off?" The young Qin Ming was still unwilling to give up, as this was the only remarkable method he could obtain.

"Burned."

The young Qin Ming fell silent, seemingly a little sad, looking down at his small shoes with toes peeking out.

As the lighter hours of night arrived, Qin Ming woke up.

He sighed lightly, having thought he had obtained a heavenly book. It seemed he had overthought it. In the future, he still needed to pay more attention to other advanced Yi Qi Gongs.

However, he then became somewhat distracted. No one had helped him, yet he had still successfully practiced the first two pages of the silk scroll.

"Even if I succeeded, what then? The rest of the silk scroll was burned. Moreover, the creators themselves failed; they personally verified it and practiced themselves to death. So many years have passed, and the other few people should also be long gone from this world."

Qin Ming got up and went into the courtyard, feeling the changes within himself. This second regeneration, aided by spiritual substances, was swift and intense; he had succeeded.

He felt that now, even a single arm possessed a thousand catties of strength.

***

Two days later, news came from Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing, stating that the high-ranking officials and the top-tier anomalous beings from the mountains were going to hold a final negotiation, at the entrance outside the mountain range.

At this moment, many people were already waiting.

In the snow, a donkey slowly trod through the snow.

"This must be the mount of some big figure from Crimson Cloud City, right?"

As the donkey approached, people noticed that its back wasn't empty; a creature was sitting cross-legged, but it wasn't human. It was a completely white weasel, very quiet, like an old monk in meditation.

The first being to appear was so peculiar that many people dared not speak.
