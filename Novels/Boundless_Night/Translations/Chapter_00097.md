# Chapter 97: Ascending the Peak

Qin Ming received three streaks of Outerworld Heavenly Light. Although his entire body was blackened, he wasn't injured; on the contrary, his vitality and spirit were more vigorous than before.

As he circulated the Li Fire Scripture, he felt a surging vitality coursing through his body, waves of heat rising as if baptizing and purifying his physique, nourishing his spirit.

Qin Ming was surprised; this truly was an extraordinary technique. It seemed capable of cleansing his marrow and transforming his physique, as his constitution had improved after just beginning to practice it.

"The Li Fire Scripture is extraordinary. Once comprehended, this cultivation method can slowly transform the body, eventually revealing its full wonders."

He felt that he was now stronger than he had been during the battle in the desert. This tangible change made him even more dedicated, wanting to persist in his arduous cultivation.

He went to wash up, removing all traces of the lightning fire. His black hair was beaded with water, his body lines were smooth, crystal clear, and lustrous, and his life vitality had noticeably increased.

Soon after, Qin Ming arrived at the City Lord's Mansion and said, "Uncle Meng, you were looking for me?"

Meng Xinghai replied, "We're about to go to the Outerworld. Don't mess around in the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall anymore; keep your body in optimal condition."

"I just urgently want to become stronger so I can achieve something in the Outerworld," Qin Ming said.

Meng Xinghai smiled and said, "Yes, I knew you've been particularly eager to improve lately. Don't busy yourself anymore; everything has been prepared for you."

He pointed to two boxes on the coffee table and said, "One extraordinary technique, and one rare spiritual substance, both of which can significantly boost your strength."

Qin Ming couldn't stop smiling. After cultivating the Li Fire Force and then hearing such good news, it was truly a double blessing, allowing his strength to ascend once more.

He eagerly opened the box containing the secret manual, a look of confusion on his face. "Golden Silkworm Technique? Is this a cultivation method related to other races/variants?"

Qin Ming had heard that some special ancient texts, though imitating higher beings, could ultimately manifest powers far exceeding the original variants.

"This book has little to do with the higher variant, the Golden Silkworm; it merely borrows the name," Meng Xinghai said, his expression becoming serious as he explained some details.

If he could fully master this extraordinary technique, he might even discover a more transcendent secret scripture.

Qin Ming showed surprise. "The name 'Golden Silkworm' is just a cover? There's an even more powerful scripture behind it?"

Meng Xinghai nodded. "When I prepared the Rebirth Method for you, I naturally had to consider the long term. Unfortunately, I don't have the ability to help you obtain that even rarer secret scripture. If you master this manual and eventually gain recognition, you might be able to see the other one."

Qin Ming immediately became energetic, studying it right there, eager to discover its wonders.

He finally understood why it was called the Golden Silkworm Technique. The cultivation method recorded in this text produced Heavenly Light Force like silkworm threads, which could form a light cocoon around the body, offering astonishing defense.

Furthermore, once cultivated to a profound level, it could absorb rare Golden Essence Qi, making the silkworm-thread-like Heavenly Light Force and the cocoon even tougher and indestructible.

"Mainly for body protection in the early stages?" Qin Ming showed a strange expression. He had recently obtained several defensive secret methods, such as the Golden Armor Technique and the Golden Light Shield, both of which were extraordinary.

Unfortunately, he had only initially cultivated the Vajra Force and Golden Light Force. Without consuming the Three-Colored Flower or entering the Thunderfire Alchemy Hall to receive Outerworld Heavenly Light, it would be difficult to further enhance them.

Meng Xinghai said, "Many hard-style techniques are indeed powerful, but excessive rigidity makes them prone to breaking. This Golden Silkworm Technique combines both flexibility and sturdiness, offering endless wonders. Moreover, if you look further, its offensive power is even more terrifying."

Qin Ming continued reading, his expression growing serious. It truly was an extraordinary technique. Not to mention the later chapters, just the application of the Heavenly Light Force alone was terrifying.

Those flexible golden silkworm threads, when cultivated to a profound level, could shoot outwards, rapidly piercing opponents.

Furthermore, at an even higher level, the golden silkworm threads formed by the Heavenly Light Force could dance chaotically, tearing apart others' Heavenly Light, weapons, and more, as if twisting space itself.

Qin Ming's spirit was invigorated. He exclaimed, "I wish I could master it immediately and go spar with some Outerworld disciples!"

Meng Xinghai reminded him, "In the Rebirth Realm, it will only significantly boost your defensive power. As for other aspects, consider them when you enter the Outer Saint realm."

"Uncle Meng, you're afraid something will happen to me in that spiritual cave, so you found me such a defensive cultivation method. But, in a short time, even if I can initially get started, how can I increase the total amount of Heavenly Light Force?" Qin Ming asked, knowing that such extraordinary techniques must consume a lot.

Meng Xinghai first finished adding calming incense to the purple bronze incense burner before saying, "You only need to initially cultivate the Golden Silkworm Force; I'll arrange the rest."

Qin Ming's eyes instantly gleamed, looking at him with immense anticipation.

Meng Xinghai didn't elaborate, only telling him that the great gift could increase his total Heavenly Light.

"Oh, right, after early spring arrives, the Esoteric Sects, Blessed Lands, and some special higher academies will begin selecting disciples. Yes, the annual grand examination is about to start, but you don't need to participate in the early stages. As a City Lord, I can certainly designate you as the top ranker of this city. Of course, if you want to be more ambitious, some confrontations will be unavoidable later, like striving to be number one in major regions, which offers many benefits."

"I'll focus on improving my strength first!" Qin Ming said. He would soon be heading to the Outerworld and couldn't truly rely on Li Qingyue for protection.

In fact, if the opportunity was right, he even wanted to spar with some Outerworld disciples.

Meng Xinghai nodded. "Yes, you're right, don't get distracted lately. In the coming period, the competition among Outerworld disciples will likely become the focus, attracting attention from all sides. You could say you're preparing for battle now."

"I'm a Reborn, not an Outerworld disciple. By the way, Uncle Meng, since the Outerworld Heavenly Light in that spiritual cave is so dense it can't be dissolved, did the spiritual substance it once contained not dissipate? If I undergo a baptism there, wouldn't I be able to undergo another rebirth?" Qin Ming asked.

"Don't be reckless, the Heavenly Light there is incredibly volatile. You wouldn't be unwilling to quickly raise your realm and fight Outerworld disciples, would you?" Meng Xinghai looked at him, teasing, "Fortunately, your realm isn't high enough, so it'd be hard for you to steal others' thunder."

"How could that be? I know who the main participants in that battlefield are; I'm just going to broaden my horizons." Qin Ming also chuckled, then bid farewell, preparing for his fifth rebirth.

That night, he opened the jade jar. Inside was a shimmering purple liquid, flowing with hazy light mist, its spiritual essence so rich it was almost tangible.

Qin Ming tilted his head back and drank it all. Afterward, he felt his entire body turn scalding hot, as if burning, with a vigorous life force surging through him.

This wasn't his first experience; he already had practice and paid it little mind. He first practiced the Rebirth Method from the silk manuscript, then proceeded to comprehend the Golden Silkworm Technique.

Qin Ming could clearly feel his physique continuously improving. This was an all-encompassing enhancement, with changes from strength to perception.

The fifth rebirth primarily manifested as increased physical resilience, making him, simply put, more resistant to attacks. The sixth rebirth would likely give rise to a special ability.

That night, after he fell asleep, the golden thread jade robe reappeared. However, he regretfully didn't dream of his grandfather, nor did he see his childhood self.

This was because, during his childhood, before entering the Cui family, all his experiences studying the silk manuscript had been fully recalled and integrated during his last rebirth.

In the morning, Qin Ming sighed, wondering if his grandfather was still alive. At that time, the old man had said he could live for another ten years, but now thirteen years had passed.

"I'm not strong enough. Otherwise, I would just go and ask the important members of the Cui family directly."

Qin Ming put aside those thoughts, allowing his body to undergo its rebirth, and began to delve into studying the Golden Silkworm Technique.

In the evening, he completely finished his fifth rebirth. His perception, speed, and physical resilience had all significantly increased, and his strength now exceeded six thousand catties.

Without a doubt, his strength had rapidly soared.

Qin Ming didn't go out. He knew this wasn't enough, so he diligently comprehended the Golden Silkworm Technique, continuously practicing in the courtyard.

On the fifth day, he cultivated the Golden Silkworm Force. Streaks of golden light emerged from his body surface, like sprouts breaking through the soil, carrying vigorous vitality. However, he couldn't yet weave them into a net; he had only just begun to grasp the technique.

But this was enough; Meng Xinghai had already prepared a great gift for him, which would allow for further improvement.

In recent days, news about the competition among Outerworld disciples indeed began to spread throughout various regions, drawing attention from all sides.

Later, even the topic of the grand examination was suppressed.

This was mainly because the path of those from the Outerworld was incredibly powerful. Any slight disturbance concerning them would attract public attention, let alone a competition involving a group of core disciples about to unfold.

Now, in various cities, in teahouses and restaurants, a large number of people were enthusiastically discussing it.

After Qin Ming entered the City Lord's Mansion, he found that Meng Xinghai had a guest: a seemingly familiar young man.

"Brother Chonghe, no, Brother Qin Ming, long time no see." The young man smiled, stood up to greet him, his lips red and teeth white, divine light flowing in his eyes, his strength seemingly considerable.

Qin Ming thought carefully and realized who he was. He had seen him before in Qinghe City; his name was Li Qingxiao, and he should be fourteen years old now. He was Li Qingxu's cousin.

"Indeed, it's been a long time," Qin Ming nodded.

"I originally wanted to come to Uncle Meng's place to 'gild myself' and have him personally appoint me as the city's number one. I didn't expect Brother Qin Ming to get there first, so I won't compete with you; I'll just switch to another city," Li Qingxiao chuckled.

Qin Ming smiled faintly. He didn't believe this scheming young man hadn't known he was here beforehand.

He figured that after he killed the black-clothed woman and an Outer Saint in the desert, his old acquaintances, not knowing who did it, had discussed it.

Qin Ming guessed that Li Qingxiao genuinely wanted to find a city to 'gild himself' and, while passing through, took the opportunity to inquire about news.

Li Qingxiao sighed, "I didn't expect Brother Qin to be so formidable, quietly becoming number one here. No wonder my cousin speaks so highly of you."

Qin Ming couldn't be bothered to respond to him. Everyone knew about his grievances with Li Qingxu, so this young man's mention of these matters naturally carried no goodwill.

"Go find another city," Meng Xinghai began to dismiss him.

Li Qingxiao lingered, unwilling to leave. "Uncle Meng, you're really biased. You're chasing me away even when I just sit here for a bit, yet you look after Brother Qin Ming so much."

He smiled and said, "Brother Qin, my cousin says you two will definitely meet again in the future. He highly regards you, and those past incidents were just minor misunderstandings."

"Mm." Qin Ming uttered only a single syllable.

Seeing Qin Ming didn't respond much, Li Qingxiao continued on his own, "My cousin says that in the future, Brother Qin will climb to the peak on the path of Rebirth and finally be able to enter the Outerworld."

Was this a high evaluation? To an ordinary Reborn outside, it might be very encouraging, a high recognition from someone of the Outerworld.

However, Li Qingxu's evaluation of Qin Ming like this wasn't exactly kind words.

The meaning was very clear: Qin Ming had to strive to rise, fight his way to the highest peak, before he could enter the Outerworld to meet Li Qingxu.

Of course, there was another underlying implication: what would a master on the path of Rebirth do upon entering the Outerworld? Become a Jade-Armored Guard, or perhaps a Divine-Armored Guard.

Meng Xinghai's expression turned displeased. He said, "Don't cause trouble. Also, tell your cousin to focus more on the competition among Outerworld disciples. He might not necessarily get that item in the spiritual cave."

"I also think he won't get it," Qin Ming said.

Li Qingxiao's face was full of smiles. "Let's wait and see. The competition among Outerworld disciples is about to begin."
