# Chapter 174: Mining Mastery Achieved

"You have an idea?"

The disciple from the Rongjin Hall shook his head vigorously like a rattle drum.

"I think my Little Red is already peerlessly beautiful... Besides, if I were to marry the Eldest Senior Sister and have children, the kids would probably starve to death..."

"..."

Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped in the branch tunnel, looking with some surprise at Yan Yuwei who had walked in with a solemn expression.

"Why are you here?"

Yan Yuwei's expression was solemn, and without a word, she drew the two iron pickaxes tied to her back and walked to Xu Yunfan's other side.

"Hah!"

With a sharp exhale, Yan Yuwei's arm muscles bulged, and the two meteor iron pickaxes in her hands crossed down, actually plowing a three-foot-deep cross-shaped groove into the hematite ore.

"Watch closely!"

Her latissimus dorsi spread like a hawk's wings, and the dozen or so crisscrossing scars on her body writhed like earthworms rolling under her muscle movement.

Her arms swung out in a full moon arc. The moment the pickaxe contacted the rock layer, it suddenly released thirty percent of its force, and her wrist bones twisted at an odd angle for half a rotation.

*Clang!*

The entire chunk of magnetite rock was shattered into honeycomb-like fragments.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised.

This was the seventh move of the "Rongjin Forging Iron Art," the "Earth Dragon's Roll," which required combining waist and horse stance to pour explosive force into the pickaxe tip, causing it to vibrate nine times.

"Skin Tempering perfection?!"

Watching the faint golden light shimmering on Yan Yuwei's body surface, and even seeing strands of hard-to-detect Gengjin aura slowly merging into her flesh and blood from the shattered ore.

"I didn't expect you to have reached Skin Tempering perfection!"

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised, and a hint of amusement naturally rose in his heart. Then, his spine suddenly arched into a reverse curve, his heel crushed three pieces of igneous rock, and the pickaxe turned into a meteor, thrusting into the fissure of the ore vein before him.

*Crack!*

The nearly ten-zhang-long hematite vein was actually dragged out by this single pickaxe strike and flung into the air.

Xu Yunfan's throat rumbled like rolling thunder, his biceps swelled by two circles, and the veins on his neck twisted like iron chains as he pulled his arm back with a sudden, violent force.

*Bang!*

A crisp sound rang out. The vein of rock pulled from the ore vein, under Xu Yunfan's property of digging earth as if it were mud, turned into a rain of stones falling from the sky.

Yan Yuwei's pupils trembled slightly; she truly hadn't expected Xu Yunfan's pickaxe strike to produce such a grand spectacle.

The falling pickaxe tip had precisely embedded itself into the concentrated point of the vein's structure, allowing him to forcibly pull out a hematite vein nearly ten zhang long.

Xu Yunfan lowered his pickaxe and turned to look. Yan Yuwei had stripped to the waist, leaving only a tight-fitting sharkskin short skirt, revealing legs as thick as water barrels. The corners of Xu Yunfan's eyes and forehead twitched slightly.

If not for Yan Yuwei's delicate face, this body was truly more masculine than a man's, showing no feminine features whatsoever.

Especially since Yan Yuwei loved to "explode" her clothes.

"Well?"

"Hmph, flashy moves!"

Yan Yuwei suddenly spun and swung her pickaxe. The two pickaxes collided in mid-air, sparking thunder and fire.

Using the rebound force, she pounced like a female leopard toward the depths of the ore vein. As the mechanism in the pickaxe clicked, the tip suddenly shimmered with a molten gold color.

"Eight hundred catties of red-patterned copper, get out here for your mother!"

The entire mine tunnel shook violently.

Xu Yunfan wiped the dust from the corner of his eye. Suddenly, he stepped forward with his foot, not falling behind in the slightest. The wind pressure generated by his swing tore a trench in the tunnel ahead.

With a deafening clang, the hematite and iron ore in the mine cave shattered one after another, revealing the molten rock drawn up from below. The two pickaxes collided above the boiling lava.

Mars rained down like a downpour.

Yan Yuwei's pickaxe suddenly softened like a snake, and dragon scale patterns appeared on the meteor iron pickaxe body. Her forearm muscles trembled at high frequency, and every muscle fiber emitted a sound of metal clashing: "The ore of the Rongjin Hall isn't dug up like this!"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly, but before he could speak, Yan Yuwei cut him off.

"Thirty years ago, the old Hall Master Chen split mountains and cracked stones..."

Yan Yuwei suddenly turned her fingers into a blade, carving a deep groove into the magnetite rock. "He relied on the skill of listening to the mountain to distinguish the vein."

Her earlobe's red copper ring suddenly hummed. The pickaxe tapped on an inconspicuous ore nodule, and the entire ore vein in the branch tunnel suddenly emitted a dragon-like tremor.

Xu Yunfan was slightly surprised. Such techniques indeed didn't exist in the skill of mining. Only the Heavenly Crafting Forging Art had the craft of finding gold and exploring ore, but compared to Yan Yuwei's nearly fifteen years of technique, they each had their own merits.

This woman, her mind was quite petty. She must have started surveying the location the moment she entered.

Sulfur smoke spewed from the ground fissures. Xu Yunfan silently shouldered his magnetite pickaxe.

"You've caused this branch vein to collapse. Just wait for your Hall Master to hold you accountable."

Yan Yuwei's eye twitched. Seeing the scene she had caused, she didn't dare to be negligent and began frantically mining to reinforce the tunnel.

Xu Yunfan laughed lightly. His pickaxe fell into the hard ore, the tip piercing through it as easily as a knife through tofu, making Yan Yuwei's heart skip a beat.

This kind of force control...

"What need is there for clever technique in mining? As long as you're hard enough, you can smash through the earth's core!"

Facing Yan Yuwei's provocation, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't sit idly by by.

The spot where their pickaxes had previously clashed exploded into a crimson storm.

The twelve Rongjin Hall disciples who had come to watch the excitement fled with their heads in their hands. One unlucky fellow was sent flying by the shockwave, his back slamming into the rock wall and leaving a human-shaped dent.

The copper hoop binding Yan Yuwei's hair shattered with a bang. Her disheveled hair danced like a lioness's mane. Seeing the molten rock behind her couldn't be stopped from pouring in, she didn't have time to say more to Xu Yunfan. She suddenly knelt on one knee, driving both pickaxes five feet into the rock layer.

"Rise!"

The ground within a three-zhang radius rose in response, forcefully blocking the molten rock surging toward her.

Xu Yunfan's pupils reflected the gushing lava pillar. Seeing Yan Yuwei's flustered appearance as she frantically dug to block the giant stones, a hint of schadenfreude flashed in his eyes.

He didn't hesitate any longer, ignoring the woman beside him trying to fix her mess. His pickaxe turned into a red dragon, thrusting into the earth's veins.

*As your pickaxe strikes the rock wall, a fine, electric current of numbness spreads from your tiger's mouth. When your fingertips touch the ore, you seem to feel the entire structure of the stone, able to easily dig out a large chunk. Your Mining skill proficiency has increased.*

*Using the Heavenly Crafting Forging Art, you distinguish the ore vein, seeking the dragon to divide the gold. Your Heavenly Crafting Forging Art proficiency has increased.*

*...*

Finally, after finishing the reinforcement of this tunnel, Yan Yuwei looked at Xu Yunfan, who was mining with utter concentration. She wanted to compete again, but helplessly realized she was still a step behind.

After a moment of silence, she stopped dwelling on it. Her hands swung the iron pickaxe like a windmill, trying to catch up to Xu Yunfan's speed.

Late into the night, Xu Yunfan's magnetite pickaxe suddenly stopped. As the tip dug into the egg-shaped rock before him, a hint of crimson color was revealed, illuminating the tunnel red.

The sound of an ore vein collapsing rumbled from the depths of the cave. Xu Yunfan wiped the iron slag from his face, looking at the fist-sized red-patterned copper essence he had dug out before him.
