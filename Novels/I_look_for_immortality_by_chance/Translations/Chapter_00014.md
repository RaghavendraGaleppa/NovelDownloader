# Chapter 14: Are You Questioning a Golden Core?

In an instant, he dismissed the thought from his mind. Elder Hu was as aloof and transcendent as an immortal—how could such a thing be possible? Yet, seeing Gu Yuan's vigorous demeanor, the scales in his heart began to sway uncertainly once more.

He had spent considerable effort investigating but still couldn't uncover the connection between Gu Yuan and Elder Hu. The only thing he knew was that Elder Hu had suddenly announced her seclusion three days before Gu Yuan arrived at the mountain, refusing to see outsiders. Coincidentally, that was around the same time Gu Yuan had obtained his token. Clearly, there was some karmic link between the two, though its nature remained a mystery. Because of this, he had never dared to slight Gu Yuan. If Elder Hu emerged from seclusion and took him as a disciple, it would be a tremendous boon for him.

However, the Lan family's influence couldn't be underestimated either. Their pillar of strength had already reached the late-stage Foundation Establishment realm, surpassing even his own master. Most importantly, Lan Tianlu was an undisputed direct descendant of the Lan family, unlike Gu Yuan, whose origins were unclear. On top of that, Lan Tianlu had presented him with generous gifts, making the decision all the more difficult.

"Senior Brother Qiu, who is this?" Lan Tianlu, standing nearby, narrowed his eyes slightly upon seeing Gu Yuan, immediately recognizing him as the source of Qiu Mingshan's hesitation. He first bowed to Gu Yuan before turning to Qiu Mingshan with his question.

"Come, come, Junior Brother Lan, let me introduce you. This is Gu Yuan, a talented individual personally recommended by the Golden Core Elder, Elder Hu, to join our sect. Junior Brother Gu, this is Junior Brother Lan Tianlu from the Isle of Ten Thousand Thunderbolts. His uncle, the Destiny Elder of the Lan family, has already reached the late-stage Foundation Establishment realm."

Both men were inwardly startled. Lan Tianlu hadn't expected a competitor with ties to a Golden Core Elder to appear out of nowhere. No wonder Qiu Mingshan had remained unmoved despite the lavish gifts—this explained everything. Dark clouds gathered in his heart, yet not a trace of it showed on his face.

Meanwhile, Gu Yuan was also surprised. A descendant of a prominent family at the late-stage Foundation Establishment realm—had they already learned the secret of the cave abode's opportunity? If so, would taking what they desired earn him their enmity? But the thought of that nearly pure silver opportunity quickly dispelled his unease. His connection to the Golden Core Elder would inevitably come to light sooner or later. Once that happened, without the Elder's protection, he would be nothing more than an ordinary disciple. Now, while the Golden Core's aura still shielded him, he had to seize every opportunity to strengthen himself. Fear of resentment would only leave him empty-handed. If he retreated now, the Lan family might appreciate it in the moment, but once they realized he lacked the Golden Core's backing, they would discard him without a second thought.

Ordinary people yielding the road to the wealthy only reinforces the latter's sense of entitlement—they forget such gestures immediately. Only when someone wealthier grants them passage do they feel gratitude. Gu Yuan understood this dynamic well, so his expression remained calm and indifferent, as though the Lan family was beneath his notice.

When Lan Tianlu first heard the words "Golden Core," his heart tightened. But he quickly composed himself and asked, "Senior Brother Gu, are you also here for the Spirit Water? With such connections, surely the Elder has made arrangements for you?"

His words carried two layers of meaning. First, he was probing whether Gu Yuan knew the true opportunity hidden within the cave abode—after all, the "Azure Crane Spirit Water" was merely a decoy; the real treasure was far more valuable. Second, he was testing the depth of Gu Yuan's relationship with the Golden Core Elder. If the Elder truly favored him, arrangements would have been made long ago, and Qiu Mingshan wouldn't be hesitating like this. Lan Tianlu had a faint suspicion that Gu Yuan's connection to the Elder wasn't particularly strong. Qiu Mingshan likely sensed this too, hence his indecision—especially since Gu Yuan only had a Five-Aperture physique.

As soon as Lan Tianlu spoke, Qiu Mingshan also turned to look at Gu Yuan. Both men awaited his response with keen interest.

Gu Yuan merely smiled faintly, his eyes carrying a hint of cold amusement. His winning strategy today boiled down to one word: pretense. The more convincingly he acted, the less his opponents would dare to act rashly.

"Junior Brother Lan, are you questioning the Elder's intentions?" Gu Yuan turned to him with a smile, baring his teeth slightly.

"I wouldn't dare!" Lan Tianlu hurriedly denied. Who would dare question a Golden Core Elder? Even if someone did, they certainly wouldn't say it aloud.

"Good, then you're not." Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve, his gaze deepening as he stared at Lan Tianlu, a cold glint in his eyes as though reflecting the Elder's displeasure. "The Elder's will is not something to be casually speculated upon. Not even the Lan family is exempt!"

Lan Tianlu, already uneasy, flinched under Gu Yuan's stare, unable to meet his eyes. Had the Golden Core Elder seen through his plans? But how could this matter have reached the Elder's attention? He hadn't told a soul!

Gu Yuan's act didn't stop there. He turned to Qiu Mingshan, his tone not overtly cold but carrying an unspoken weight as his voice lowered. "Senior Brother Qiu, do you know where this Jade Flood Dragon beneath me came from?" Without waiting for an answer, he continued, "When the Elder met me, a Foundation Establishment cultivator was present. That cultivator gifted me this magical artifact so I could traverse ten thousand miles of mountains in three days to join the sect."

As he spoke, Gu Yuan's gaze once again turned profound, drifting almost imperceptibly toward the storage pouch in Lan Tianlu's hand. A trace of mockery flickered in his eyes.

Qiu Mingshan's heart skipped a beat. Though Gu Yuan hadn't spelled it out, he understood perfectly. When Gu Yuan met the Golden Core Elder, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator had curried favor with him, offering gifts and seeing him off. Yet now, a mere Qi Refining cultivator like Lan Tianlu not only failed to offer gifts but even sought to obstruct him? What a joke! Did Lan Tianlu think he was stronger than a Foundation Establishment cultivator? Though Gu Yuan hadn't voiced these thoughts aloud, Qiu Mingshan could practically hear them in his mind.

Regret washed over him. He had been blinded. The Elder's presence was too distant, causing him to forget her authority. But when compared to the actions of a Foundation Establishment cultivator—or even his own superiors—his behavior was truly inexcusable. If he hadn't already promised Gu Yuan, that would be one thing. But to go back on his word now would be tantamount to slapping the Golden Core Elder in the face. Even if the Elder's favor toward Gu Yuan was minimal, failing to show preferential treatment was one thing—actively opposing him was another matter entirely.

"Junior Brother Lan, you've overstepped." Qiu Mingshan's voice turned stern as he recalled the Golden Core Elder's majesty, his resolve firming. "Junior Brother Gu has already paid two spirit stones and registered his name in my ledger. By the sect's laws, he has the right to choose a cave abode first. No one can override this—not even a Foundation Establishment cultivator!"

The thought of offending a Golden Core Elder over a mere two hundred spirit stones sent a chill down his spine. If his master found out, he might be expelled from the sect! With that in mind, he no longer hesitated. His voice rang with righteousness as he took out the jade ledger and vermilion brush, inscribing Gu Yuan's name without even collecting the two spirit stones.

"Junior Brother Gu, you may now select your cave abode." He produced a blank token, awaiting Gu Yuan's choice.

Gu Yuan showed no outward joy, merely nodding with an air of inevitability, as though this outcome was only natural. Then, he extended a finger, pointing toward the three cave abodes at the mountain's peak.

Lan Tianlu's eyes widened, fixed unblinkingly on Gu Yuan. Once Gu Yuan invoked the Golden Core Elder's authority, he knew the day was lost. Yet a sliver of hope remained. After all, he had told no one of this opportunity—not even his family elders. The Golden Core Elder likely didn't know of it either. Perhaps Gu Yuan was only here for the cave abode itself. If he chose wrongly, there might still be a chance.

"Then, this one—" Gu Yuan's finger hovered over the central cave abode, making Lan Tianlu's heart pound with anticipation. Gu Yuan didn't know! The opportunity was still his!

But then, Gu Yuan's finger shifted slightly. "No, this one instead. The view by the great marsh is more pleasing." He pointed to the cave abode at the very edge, nestled beside the riverbank.

Lan Tianlu's face froze.
