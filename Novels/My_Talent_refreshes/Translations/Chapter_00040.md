**Chapter 40: The Truth Revealed**  

"Yes!"  

After everyone responded in unison, Elder Chen swept his gaze across the group. His eyes lingered briefly on Yuan Guang and Chu Ning before finally settling on the latter.  

Under that scrutinizing gaze, Chu Ning felt a twinge of nervousness.  

His actual cultivation had already reached the fifth layer of Qi Refining, but he had deliberately used the innate ability of his Yin Wood Spiritual Body to display only the third layer. So far, no one had noticed.  

But Elder Chen was a genuine mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. If the elder was staring at him like this, had he detected something?  

"As disciples of the Spirit Plantation Division, it's commendable that both of you have reached the third layer of Qi Refining in less than a year," Elder Chen said slowly.  

Chu Ning exhaled slightly in relief, silently marveling at the power of his Yin Wood Spiritual Body's innate ability. Even a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator couldn't see through his disguise.  

Elder Chen continued to study Chu Ning, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes.  

"You cultivate the Evergreen Wood Technique, don't you? Your spiritual energy is remarkably pure—quite unexpected."  

Chu Ning quickly clasped his hands and replied, "Elder, I’ve heard from the sect’s instructors and duty disciples that I might have a natural affinity for wood-based techniques."  

"What about wood-based spells? Can you cast any of them instantaneously?" Elder Chen pressed.  

Chu Ning’s mind raced before answering cautiously, "I do have a good affinity for them as well. I can cast the Growth Spell and the Purification Spell instantly, but the Verdant Spring Technique still requires a bit more practice."  

His words were a mix of truth and deception. In reality, he could cast the Verdant Spring Technique instantaneously too.  

But considering he had only been in the sect for less than a year, displaying such proficiency might draw too much attention.  

He hadn’t forgotten Shang Zhaoxiang’s warning—that the sect had been sending out many outer disciples on mysterious missions, primarily those at the sixth layer of Qi Refining or higher.  

If he revealed his full capabilities in wood-based spells, he might be selected for such tasks. And until he knew what those missions entailed, he wasn’t keen on taking unnecessary risks.  

Still, Elder Chen nodded in approval.  

"Good. Focus on mastering the Verdant Spring Technique—it’s highly beneficial for spirit plant cultivation."  

"Yes, Elder," Chu Ning acknowledged.  

---  

With that, Elder Chen said no more. The other disciples in the spirit boat, however, looked at Chu Ning with complex expressions.  

Qiu Shunyi and Lü Xingyuan were visibly pleased.  

Meanwhile, those around Yuan Guang alternated their gazes between him and Chu Ning, their faces filled with disbelief.  

From Chu Ning’s exchange with Elder Chen, it was clear that his cultivation surpassed Yuan Guang’s.  

At the very least, none of them had ever seen Yuan Guang cast any spell instantaneously.  

And Elder Chen had even praised Chu Ning’s spiritual energy as "remarkably pure."  

This revelation left disciples like Chen Youdao—who had previously mocked Chu Ning for overestimating himself in cultivating Black Bamboo—utterly stunned.  

Yuan Guang’s expression was particularly awkward.  

Ever since he learned that Chu Ning had been recommended as a disciple for specialized training, he had suspected that Chu Ning’s cultivation surpassed his own.  

Now, Elder Chen’s public acknowledgment had stripped away any pretense.  

Of course, with the elder present, neither Qiu Shunyi nor Yuan Guang and his group dared to speak up.  

But for the rest of the journey, the way the others looked at Chu Ning had changed entirely.  

Even Chen Youdao and his companions no longer wore their usual mocking or teasing expressions.  

The spirit boat moved swiftly, reaching the sect’s entrance in no time.  

After disembarking, Elder Chen departed with the boat, vanishing into the sky.  

The moment he was gone, Qiu Shunyi immediately turned to Chu Ning in astonishment.  

"Chu Ning, you can cast spells instantaneously? And multiple ones at that?"  

"Two spells, no less!" Lü Xingyuan chimed in. "And you’ve already mastered the Verdant Spring Technique so well? I only just learned it recently."  

Chu Ning smiled faintly. "I just happen to have a natural affinity for wood-based techniques and spells."  

As the three conversed, Yuan Guang’s face twitched slightly.  

Chen Youdao, who had been standing beside Yuan Guang, hesitated as if he wanted to approach Chu Ning but was too embarrassed.  

Just then, another voice interrupted.  

"Chu Ning? Oh, all of you are here?"  

It was Zhuang Yunde, who happened to be passing by the sect’s entrance.  

Since everyone from the Spirit Plantation Division’s Ding District recognized him, they all greeted him politely.  

Zhuang Yunde, being good-natured, returned the greetings before turning to Chu Ning.  

"Did you just return from the market? By the way, Mu Ling mentioned she wanted to ask if you’ve bought everything she requested. She tried contacting you with a message talisman this morning, but you weren’t home."  

"I’ve got everything. I’ll deliver it to her now," Chu Ning replied.  

Zhuang Yunde nodded.  

"Good. She lives in Outer Sect Courtyard A-32. You can go straight there."  

Chu Ning immediately turned and headed into the sect toward the outer disciple quarters.  

Meanwhile, Zhuang Yunde walked with the others toward the spirit fields.  

After a few steps, Chen Youdao couldn’t resist asking, "Senior Brother Zhuang, can Chu… Senior Brother Chu enter the outer sect on his own?"  

"Of course," Zhuang Yunde replied matter-of-factly. "He’s been recommended for specialized training in the Hundred Arts Hall. He’s allowed to enter the outer sect two or three times a month."  

"He was recommended for specialized training?"  

"What’s he learning?"  

Apart from Yuan Guang, the others were hearing this for the first time and couldn’t hide their curiosity.  

"Paper talisman crafting," Zhuang Yunde answered casually, then glanced at them in surprise. "Wait, you didn’t know?"  

They all shook their heads. But upon hearing that Chu Ning was learning talisman crafting, they could roughly guess the reason.  

Only Chen Youdao pressed further, unwilling to let it go. "So… his Black Bamboo harvest must have been good too?"  

Zhuang Yunde finally caught on, giving Yuan Guang and Chen Youdao a meaningful look before smiling.  

"If Chu Ning has already mastered talisman crafting, what do you think his Black Bamboo harvest was like?"  

The implication was clear.  

Recalling how they had once dragged Chu Ning to admire Yuan Guang’s Purple Spirit Potatoes, the group was overcome with embarrassment.  

As for Yuan Guang, he was so mortified he could have dug a hole in the ground with his toes.  

Once Zhuang Yunde walked ahead, Yuan Guang didn’t linger, quickly excusing himself and leaving.  

Unaware of all this, Chu Ning had kept his recommendation for specialized training a secret, adhering to his principle of maintaining a low profile.  

After parting ways with the group, he hurried to the outer sect.  

He delivered the 1,000 talisman papers to Mu Ling, received 22 spirit stones for next month’s order, and then rushed back to his courtyard.  

Ever since learning how valuable the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was, he couldn’t rest easy.  

After all, the fruit was nearing full maturity and would soon be ready for harvest.  

When he was still some distance from his courtyard, he spotted a figure standing outside his gate.  

Quickening his pace, he approached.
