# Chapter 53: Li Xian Arrives, Every Arrow Pierces the Heart

Jiang Yun, prompted by her servant girl Qiuyue, began preparing for the winter hunt early. She purchased Beast-Attracting Incense and traps beforehand, and her harvest was quite substantial.

At the moment, she casually produced two wild "Plum-Spotted Deer." These were a rare breed, faster than ordinary deer.

"Tiger!"

Her seventh catch was a tiger. This was no "sick" or "injured" tiger, but a robust, young mountain tiger. To hunt such a beast was enough to be proud of.

She displayed all her catches together: four deer, two tigers, two wild boars, and one tree crocodile. The remaining items were not worth looking at.

Although she had one more tiger than Pang Long, the overall quality was inferior.

"Impressive, Xiao Yun," Pang Long praised without holding back.

"Thank you, Commander," Jiang Yun smiled, but couldn't help sighing inwardly. *To hunt three bear beasts is truly too difficult,* she thought. *This promotion has nothing to do with me.*

Recalling the scene in the mountains, a chill ran through her. With her strength, hunting bears would be asking for trouble, the risk was too great.

"Though you hunted two tigers, you won with tools," Madam Wen saw through the trick instantly. The two mountain tigers died the same way: caught in a beast-hunting net with barbs that dug into their bodies and couldn't be removed, bleeding to death.

"It seems the reward I set cannot be achieved by anyone," Madam Wen felt a hint of disappointment. She herself had a bountiful harvest, but it was uninteresting if no one else presented anything worthy of a glance.

"It's Master Ying."

"Master Ying has returned."

Just then, the highly anticipated Huan Hanying appeared in everyone's view.

Madam Wen raised an eyebrow slightly. "I remember you. You hunted a striped tiger last time. What did you hunt this time?"

Huan Hanying was overjoyed. *The Madam actually remembers me! My harvest is plentiful this time; I will surely impress her!* He said modestly, "This one's skills are shallow. My prey certainly cannot compare to Commander Pang's; I'm afraid I will be laughed at."

His words were barbed. In truth, while martial arts were important in hunting, they were not the most important thing. Engaging in close combat with prey was ultimately inferior. He was even confident that Pang Long's harvest might not be as rich as his.

This seemed like modesty, but it was actually a jab at Pang Long.

"Hahaha, whether it's a mule or a horse, let's see it first," Pang Long, not catching the implication, joked.

"Alas, my luck was average. I only hunted three mountain tigers," Huan Hanying sighed, and opened his flesh-retracting bag...

Three mountain tigers lay on the ground, all of large build.

The scene fell silent for a moment, then erupted in warm applause. Many laborers carrying prey stopped to watch. Luo Fang also stopped urging them on and subconsciously moved closer.

"Not bad," Madam Wen nodded gently. "You are the first to gather three tigers."

Huan Hanying's heart swelled with joy, deliberately not looking at Pang Long. He knew his prey had already surpassed Pang Long's, overshadowing him.

"It's a pity it rained on the third day; otherwise... I could have hunted another bear."

As he spoke, a black bear corpse fell to the ground.

The bear's body was even larger, its black needle-like fur and sharp tusks all showcasing its wildness. Now, it lay quietly on the ground, pierced by an arrow, becoming Huan Hanying's trophy and setting off his own tall and mighty figure.

Madam Wen raised her eyebrows slightly, her expression brightening. She had always enjoyed hunting—not only doing it herself but also watching others hunt. Seeing the second bear corpse, her mood was already quite good.

She said, "This black bear engaged you in close combat. You used the Fire Eagle Claw to wound its chest, then拉开 distance to shoot it dead."

"The Fire Eagle Claw has some skill, reaching the level of great success. But your clawing was sticky, and your internal Qi was not smooth when passing through the Tianque acupoint, lacking some fire."

"It's a pity your archery is average; only within fifteen steps do you have some accuracy. Therefore, for every beast, you must first engage in close combat before using the bow and arrow to finish it off."

Pang Long reminded him, "Why aren't you thanking the Madam?"

Huan Hanying belatedly realized that the few words just now were casual guidance from the Madam, and he immediately expressed his thanks repeatedly.

The subsequent prey was much more ordinary.

"Perhaps too many people entered the mountains, startling the beasts."

"If I could encounter more tigers and bears, I would surely have taken more," Huan Hanying lamented, not missing any chance to show off.

"The harvest is decent, but it still doesn't satisfy my heart," Madam Wen looked down at Huan Hanying, her eyes showing no ripples.

Hunting... the emphasis is on the word "shoot." But Pang Long, Huan Hanying, and the others focused on the word "fight." Entering the forest was not shooting, but fighting beasts. Although they all shot the wild beasts to death, the difference was like that between tea and plain water.

The Great Wu Dynasty revered the bow. Legend had it that the Great Wu's Grand Ancestor rose from an archer, shooting forth the grandeur of Great Wu, shooting through the cycles of the sun and moon.

"Is there anyone else?" Madam Wen asked.

Pang Long hurried to check and returned to report, "There are still a few C-rank guards."

"Let's wait another quarter of an hour. If they don't appear, they should have been eaten by beasts," Madam Wen's voice was pleasant to the ear, but her words透着骨子里的漠然. She didn't care about the life or death of the guards at all.

"It's him!"

"Ah, so he didn't die."

Just then, whispers spread through the crowd.

The newcomer was naturally Li Xian. He had gone deep into the inner area. Although he had intended to head back yesterday, the rain kept dripping, and he wanted to smoke-cure some dried meat. So he found a cave, made a fire to smoke the meat. Only this morning, after the rain completely stopped, did he start rushing back non-stop.

"How is he also..." Huan Hanying was startled, then sneered in his heart. *You are just a C-rank guard, what real skill could you have? You must have hidden deliberately, appearing last to catch the Madam's attention. In front of my harvest, you are just asking for humiliation. If it weren't for Pang Long helping you, how could the Madam have rewarded you with fine meat?*

Unconsciously, jealousy flared, and his gaze carried hostility.

Jiang Yun was also startled, and couldn't help frowning.

"You are late," Madam Wen said, seeing Li Xian's clothes were dry, feeling a bit curious.

"I took shelter from the rain last night and started rushing back first thing this morning," Li Xian explained.

Madam Wen said, "What did you hunt? Show me."

"Yes!" Li Xian took out the flesh-retracting bag, fished out a wild rabbit first. It had an arrow through its neck, blood still dripping. This rabbit was casually shot on his hurried journey. He had one remaining feathered arrow, no reason not to use it.

Madam Wen frowned, already too lazy to look further.

"I thought you were so late because you had a surprise," Jiang Yun muttered in her heart, her expression showing disdain, but she didn't dare speak out.

"Probably just wild rabbits, wild boars, and such," Huan Hanying thought, secretly observing the Madam's expression. Seeing her avert her gaze, he immediately said, "Alright, stop showing off, go stand aside quickly."

Li Xian ignored him, reached in and pulled out a deer corpse.

Huan Hanying thought, *Just a deer corpse.* He was about to mock him, but seeing the deer corpse appear and the Madam move her gaze back, he shut his mouth.

"One arrow through the heart," Madam Wen said softly.

This arrow was quite excellent, as if she could already see the arrow flying through the forest, tracing a path, and hitting the beast's heart directly. No extra movements, simple, clean, crisp.

Then...

He pulled out a second deer corpse.

"Another arrow through the heart," Madam Wen raised her eyebrows slightly, showing a bit of interest.

Many hunt deer, but few have every arrow pierce the heart.
