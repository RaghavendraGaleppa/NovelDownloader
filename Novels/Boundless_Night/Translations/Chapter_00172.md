# Chapter 172: Tightrope Walking in the Clouds

"Don't overdo it." Zhao Yaoting thought Qin Ming might be stubbornly enduring, having mistakenly ingested the Ethereal Heavenly Light Elixir and unwilling to lose face in front of everyone. Especially since there were two extremely famous celestial maidens from the Outland present, both possessing city-toppling beauty and recognized as Near-Immortal Seeds from their respective regions. It was normal for a young man to be attracted to beauty. However, if he persisted out of fear of making a fool of himself, it could lead to severe consequences.

Zhao Yaoting handed him a crystal containing a light golden liquid. "This is a medicinal liquid for strengthening the body and healing injuries." "I'm really fine," Qin Ming shook his head and said. "Stubborn as a dead duck," a youth in crimson-gold armor beside him interjected, his tone rather aggressive. His name was Sun Jingxiao, and he hailed from the Pure Land.

Qin Ming glanced at him. "Brother, why don't you... give me a bottle of Heavenly Light Liquid too, let me get even more 'stubborn'?" Sun Jingxiao said nothing, directly pulling out a thumb-sized vial filled with concentrated Heavenly Light Liquid from his embrace and handing it to him. "Don't be so hot-headed, it's not a big deal!" Cai Jingcheng tried to dissuade them.

However, Qin Ming immediately took it, wishing he could get a few more bottles. He had several types of Heavenly Light energy waiting to be fused, so the more, the better. Sun Jingxiao's expression instantly changed. "You all saw it. If something happens to him, don't blame me. He insisted on drinking it himself." "Stop it," Zhao Yaoting called out.

Nevertheless, Qin Ming gulped down the entire bottle of Heavenly Light Liquid. The intensity of this liquid ethereal heavenly light was indeed too high, stimulating him to open his mouth and exhale a beam of light. Finally, he let out a burp. Sun Jingxiao was dumbfounded. What was going on? This was absolutely bizarre! "Another bottle!" Qin Ming extended his hand towards him.

The eyes of the youths present all changed. Even the two highly renowned Near-Immortal Seeds revealed strange expressions. "Any more?" Qin Ming asked, eager for another heated exchange so the other party might give him two more bottles of Heavenly Light Liquid. Sun Jingxiao no longer wanted to bother with him. He was certain now that this guy could truly consume Heavenly Light Liquid without ill effect, his body completely unharmed. He must practice some divine and extraordinary cultivation method!

"We have important matters to attend to," Su Shiyun from the Immortal Land reminded them. She wore a bronze mask. This Near-Immortal Seed was indeed very special; even standing still, some heavenly essence would spill from her, and her green robes fluttered, giving her the aura of an airborne immortal. Qin Ming immediately realized that the so-called Near-Immortal Seed was not just an empty title; they were truly highly attuned to certain inexplicable "factors" between heaven and earth.

"Brother, what should I call you? Are you also here for..." Zhao Yaoting began. By rights, the premium cabin had been fully reserved, and everyone here should be directly involved in this mission. But this guy was a bit strange. He arrived so late, and seemed a little out of place. Moreover, he recklessly gulped down Outer World Heavenly Light Liquid at the drop of a hat. What kind of bizarre behavior was this? Thus, Zhao Yaoting felt somewhat uneasy about him.

Qin Ming didn't wait for him to finish, immediately nodding. He had sensed anticipation and excitement in the emotions of a certain youth, and though the fluctuations were weak, he had keenly caught them. This so-called "mission" wasn't a bad thing! Qin Ming generally knew that these youths came from different orthodoxies, didn't know each other well, and had temporarily formed a team. So, he had "acted rashly" along with them!

"Do you know where we're going?" Sun Jingxiao asked, clearly finding him disagreeable. The others also looked over, some even employing arcane arts and spiritual awareness to scrutinize him carefully.

"You're really nosy," Qin Ming said, looking impatient and somewhat disdainful. At the same time, he sensed the other party's strong emotional fluctuations, clearly infuriated. "Please answer," Su Shiyun, clad in green, asked. This Near-Immortal Seed was incredibly astute and felt something was slightly off.

"In the night sky," Qin Ming said calmly. As he spoke, he forcibly maintained a steady heartbeat, devoid of any ripples, relying on his newfound absolute control over his physical body. In truth, when he had resonated with Sun Jingxiao and realized the destination was a location within the night sky, he had been considerably startled.

Then, he added, "They call it a mission, but isn't it just going to 'harvest' something?" "Mind your words!" someone cautioned. "Don't be so blunt!" another person said. In truth, Qin Ming didn't know the specifics.

He had only perceived a few fragmented pieces of information from Sun Jingxiao, after which that guy's mind had become as firm as iron, showing no further emotional fluctuations. Qin Ming knew that this "insider information," which couldn't see the light of day, had made the others believe he was indeed one of them. As expected, it was a loosely organized team with little interaction among its members.

In the main cabin, their identities had mostly been revealed, and Qin Ming had a general understanding. Zhao Yaoting, Cai Jingcheng, and Tang Yutian were from three different Secret Sects. Su Shiyun was from the Immortal Land, Leng Feiyue from the Yang Land, Xue Yunzheng from the Calamity Land, and Sun Jingxiao from the Pure Land. Qin Ming realized that the people here were, in all likelihood, the cherished darlings of the old masters! Therefore, he was quite looking forward to this operation!

Silence fell. Each person carried an exotic treasure, from precious bottles to crystal cups and even nearly transparent small cauldrons, all incredibly mystical. Everyone was drawing in heavenly essence and strange substances. Qin Ming was quite interested in what one of them was drawing in, as his body felt a slight craving, and his Purple Palace Thunder Fire was stirring, wanting to activate on its own.

"Fairy Su, would you trade some of the purple mist in your jade cup?" he shamelessly asked, wanting to know what benefit it held for him. Su Shiyun held a jade cup in her hand, extraordinarily mystical, drawing in a type of purple mist that slowly settled into the cup, nearly condensing into liquid. "No trade!" she refused.

Qin Ming was at a loss. No matter how thick his skin, he couldn't force it when she was so direct. "I'll give you a wisp then." Su Shiyun, remembering they had to act together, flicked her jade hand. A streak of purple glow flew out from the jade cup, transforming into a ball of purple qi. "Many thanks." After Qin Ming absorbed this ball of purple qi, earth fire rose from his feet, and heavenly thunder spread downwards from his head. They met in his chest and abdomen with a loud boom.

Those present were astonished to find that lightning flashed and thunder roared within his chest and abdomen, followed by a faint medicinal fragrance. This was truly outrageous. Qin Ming sighed. Unfortunately, the Dragon-Tiger Great Elixir in his chest and abdomen still dissipated at the last moment. Nevertheless, his body felt very comfortable, as if nourished by a large amount of active substances.

The Vermilion Bird ship had stayed here for a long time before setting sail again. "Everyone, there are still some special zones ahead. We will hover there for you to capture heavenly essence," a female voice transmitted via spiritual awareness. "Alright!" Many youths cheered.

And so, they traveled, stopping and going. The ship had now journeyed nearly twenty thousand li, with only fifteen hundred li remaining until they reached Kunling Great City. Everyone was quite satisfied; they stopped roughly every thousand li, and everyone had tasted the benefits of the heavenly essence. When the Vermilion Bird ship stopped for the twentieth time, Su Shiyun, Zhao Yaoting, and the others rose. "It's time for us to act!"

Qin Ming felt they were acting a bit like thieves, moving furtively. The group exited through a secret passage from the premium cabin, arriving at the ship's edge where "small boats" were already arranged and waiting. No one spoke; they directly boarded the small boats, which were surprisingly piloted by the Vermilion Bird's captain herself, escorting them to their destination.

It wasn't far, only a few li away, and they quickly arrived. Black fog billowed, so thick that one couldn't see their hand in front of their face, yet everyone could sense something ahead, emitting a faint sense of oppression. Then, Qin Ming saw several spaceships, all broken and pierced by something, suspended within this dark cloud layer.

"I'll wait for you here." The captain said only this, neither asking nor saying more, simply doing as instructed. Qin Ming was the last to step off the small boat, and casually grabbed another parachute pack. The captain's eyes showed a strange look; this guy already had four hanging on him, and he still wasn't reassured?!

The other seven watched him, speechless for a moment. Qin Ming indeed felt uncertain. In the past, he had fought against anomalies in the mountains and never been afraid. This was his first time operating in the night sky. If he fell from these clouds, nine lives wouldn't be enough for the fall. Who could have imagined there would be "things" in the night sky?

They leaped onto the pierced and suspended remnants of the broken spaceships. Qin Ming finally saw clearly what had impaled the ships: faded "golden long thorns." Calling them thorns didn't quite capture it; they were truly too long, stretching beyond sight. Each was as thick as a water vat, originally golden in color, but now dull, as if covered in dust for many years.

There were many such dull long thorns, disappearing into the depths of the night sky, their thickness consistent, connected to unknown places. Leng Feiyue, the Near-Immortal Seed from the Yang Land, spoke, "Since there are so many paths, let's each proceed on our own, without interfering with each other." The spiritual awareness dormant within her body was as resplendent as a small sun, yet her words remained chillingly cold. She was a renowned Ice Mountain Fairy.

The original plan was to act together, but now everyone nodded, agreeing to separate. Qin Ming walked along the faded golden long thorn, which was as thick as a water vat. He employed his Clinging Force, so he wasn't worried about slipping off. However, he was completely in the dark about this place, knowing nothing. Where did this lead, and what kind of gains could be found here?

He was utterly baffled. This was clearly amidst dark clouds, so how could there be so many long thorns? And why weren't they falling? In the sky, it was as dark as an abyss. Gusts of aetheric gales swept through, and the thick fog churned like an ocean. Qin Ming felt increasingly uneasy the further he walked. He had already gone several hundred meters, but the long thorn showed no change, seeming endless.

He drew his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Saber and tried it on the faded golden thorn. Sparks flew, yet such a rare and precious saber couldn't cut it. Qin Ming took out his sword-shaped exotic gold pendant and tried to pierce it. It could penetrate, but caused no changes.

He moved through the pitch-black fog, murmuring to himself, "This truly feels like tightrope walking in the clouds. It's inconceivable. Who created these things in the sky?" The aetheric gale was fierce, blowing his hair into disarray. A strand fell across his eyes. As he reached to brush it away, his heart jolted.

He had conceived some absurd conjectures. If they were true, it would be utterly preposterous! "Can there truly be good fortune in a place like this?!" He found it hard to believe. Qin Ming brushed away his hair, looked at the unknown length of the "thorn" beneath his feet, and ultimately continued walking forward.

Several hundred meters later, he saw a dozen faded golden long thorns intersecting, bringing him to a chaotic area. "What kind of experience is this? Walking alone in the clouds. I hope nothing goes wrong. Kunling City is only fifteen hundred li away. Who knows, maybe directly below corresponds to a place of absolute peril."

Suddenly, Qin Ming's pupils contracted. In the black fog, he saw an even denser intersection of "long thorns," and there was... a nest! This was different from his earlier conjectures; there were actually creatures nesting in such a place. He felt a little panicked, because the nest was enormous!

However, he didn't sense any life energy, and he noticed that the nest was quite old, likely abandoned. Qin Ming approached, his heart far from calm. This nest had a diameter of three *zhang*. What kind of creature built a nest in the clouds? He climbed onto the old giant nest and found some shattered golden eggshells at its edge. "Where have I ended up?" Qin Ming's expression turned solemn.
