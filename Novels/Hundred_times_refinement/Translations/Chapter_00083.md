# Chapter 33: Heavenly Pillar Mountain  

The treasure exchange meeting would take place in nine days at the Heavenly Pillar Mountain, where the Lingyun Sect was located. After gathering this information, Lin Xuan chatted casually with the two cultivators for a while before discreetly taking his leave.  

Throughout the conversation, his expression remained indifferent, appearing merely curious without any ulterior motives. It wasn’t until he left the library and ensured no one was around that a faint smile of satisfaction appeared on his lips.  

He had found a lead on the Spiritual Control Technique!  

The two conditions for entering the second floor of the library were either beyond his reach or would arouse suspicion—neither was a viable option. However, the treasure exchange meeting was sure to have mid-tier techniques for sale. As an outsider, he could simply purchase what he needed and leave without worrying about repercussions.  

Footsteps approached from behind, and Lin Xuan’s smile vanished, replaced by his usual indifferent expression as he passed the newcomer. Without further delay, he returned to the abandoned pill refining room in his courtyard.  

Having decided to attend the exchange and acquire the technique, Lin Xuan now needed to prepare. He had learned that Heavenly Pillar Mountain was about 800 li (400 kilometers) away. For ordinary people, this distance might be daunting, but as a cultivator—though he couldn’t yet fly on spiritual artifacts—his mastery of the Wind Riding Technique allowed him to travel swiftly. He estimated the journey would take one to two days, leaving him with seven days to prepare.  

Unlike transactions in cultivation markets, this sect-sponsored exchange didn’t use spirit stones as currency but instead relied on pills. This was excellent news for Lin Xuan. Although he had inherited some wealth from Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu, leaving him with a few dozen low-grade spirit stones, he was reluctant to spend them frivolously. Spirit stones were valuable not just for trade but also for cultivation and artifact forging.  

Moreover, Lin Xuan’s unique situation meant he lacked many things—but not pills. Using pills as currency suited him perfectly. However, he was well aware of the dangers of flaunting wealth. As a mere Qi Refining cultivator, appearing too affluent could easily attract deadly trouble. Unlike the Lingyun Sect disciples, he had no sect protection to rely on.  

Thus, his approach had to be twofold: prepare thoroughly with enough pills while remaining cautious, only making moves when the timing was right. In short, he needed to stay low-key and avoid drawing attention.  

With his plan set, Lin Xuan got to work.  

For the next few days, his main task was refining more pills, even putting his cultivation practice on hold temporarily. Priorities had to be adjusted flexibly based on circumstances.  

After months of practice with the Azure Star Sea, Lin Xuan had become highly proficient at purifying Marrow Cleansing Pills. He shut himself in his room, working tirelessly day and night.

The group of young attendants led by Zhao Ming didn’t find it strange that their "Immortal Master" had secluded himself again upon returning. They assumed he was merely indulging in his usual laziness and napping.  

Five days passed.  

Lin Xuan rose from the ground, stretching his stiff body. The relentless pill refining had been exhausting, but the rewards were substantial: three bottles (300 low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills) and nine mid-grade pills.  

The quantity alone was staggering. Lin Xuan had refined so many as a precaution. After all, among the myriad elixirs of the cultivation world, Marrow Cleansing Pills—used only during the Qi Refining stage—were the lowest and least valuable. He wasn’t entirely sure how much they’d be worth as trade currency, so bringing extra was simply prudent.  

He couldn’t afford to fall short when the time came to purchase the technique!  

With the pills ready, Lin Xuan prepared to depart. First, he took stock of his possessions: 28 spirit stones, three spiritual artifacts, and several dozen elemental talismans (metal, wood, water, fire, earth).  

Along with the refined pills, he would carry all of these with him—both for security and to ensure he was well-equipped in case of danger. Though the items were numerous, the storage bracelet and belt he had acquired from Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu made transportation effortless.  

Additionally, Lin Xuan donned the protective vest he had taken from Zhang Yu. Though he didn’t know what material it was made of, its toughness was evident—clearly a defensive treasure. Such a valuable item couldn’t go to waste.  

Once everything was prepared, Lin Xuan set out. Of course, he first had to notify the sect’s administration office to obtain permission for his absence.  

For Foundation Establishment cultivators, this would require formal documentation, but for Qi Refining disciples like him, the process was far simpler. The sect paid them little attention, and a flimsy excuse was enough to secure approval.  

With the travel token in hand, Lin Xuan left Floating Cloud Valley—his first long journey in nearly four years since joining the sect. He couldn’t help but feel a sense of nostalgia.  

In truth, he was leaving early. The exchange meeting wouldn’t begin for another four days, but arriving ahead of time had its advantages. Being unfamiliar with the area, he wanted to scout the surroundings and gauge market prices, ensuring he was well-informed. This cautious, methodical approach was typical of Lin Xuan—he preferred planning over recklessness.  

---  

Two days later.  

Heavenly Pillar Mountain was located in the eastern part of Yan Province in the Zhao Kingdom, spanning dozens of li with lush, verdant vegetation. Its main peak, Heavenly Pillar Peak, was renowned for its steep and majestic terrain, towering over 5,000 meters with jagged, precipitous cliffs said to be impassable even for monkeys.  

Throughout history, many had come to explore the mountain, only to be thwarted by its sheer cliffs. No paths led up the peak, leaving visitors to sigh in frustration. Over time, the number of visitors dwindled.  

Yet on this day, a young man under twenty arrived at the base of Heavenly Pillar Peak. His appearance was unremarkable, dressed in coarse clothing—a deliberate choice. Lin Xuan wanted to avoid attention during his secret mission to acquire the technique. Wearing Floating Cloud Valley’s disciple robes would only make him conspicuous, so he had opted for the attire of an ordinary rogue cultivator. Combined with his plain features, he could easily blend into a crowd without being recognized.
