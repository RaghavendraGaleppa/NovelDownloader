# Chapter 36: Spirit Ginseng Fruit and Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees

"Opportunity?"

Hearing this, Qi Chuan was momentarily stunned before showing a hint of interest on his face.

"What kind of opportunity?"

If it was an opportunity, he was certainly interested. However, it depended on whether there was danger involved. If the risks were too great, it wouldn't be worth taking the chance, especially since his cultivation wasn't heavily dependent on resources. But if there was little to no danger, it would be worth trying.

"It's Spirit Ginseng Fruit," Qi Chan'er whispered.

"Spirit Ginseng Fruit?" Qi Chuan looked puzzled, clearly unfamiliar with the term.

Qi Chan'er explained, "Spirit Ginseng Fruit is the fruit of the Spirit Ginseng Tree, which only bears six fruits at a time. They are highly valuable—even consuming them directly can enhance cultivation speed. But more importantly, they serve as the main ingredient for Spirit Ginseng Pills, a type of pill specifically designed for late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators."

She continued, "Compared to this, the Black Mystic Grass I have is quite ordinary."

As the daughter of the Transmission Elder, Qi Chan'er naturally had far broader knowledge than Qi Chuan, who had been selected from among ordinary mortals.

"If that's the case, then the Spirit Ginseng Fruit is indeed a rare opportunity," Qi Chuan nodded. Given its value as a primary ingredient for late-stage Qi Refinement pills, the fruit was undoubtedly a significant find for the two of them, who were only at the fourth level of Qi Refinement.

Though it wasn't the kind of opportunity Qi Chuan had imagined, if it was easy to obtain, he wouldn't mind making the trip.

"Where did you find the Spirit Ginseng Fruit, and are there any risks?" he asked immediately.

There must be some danger—otherwise, Qi Chan'er would have already taken the fruit herself without waiting for him.

"It's also in the Cloudrise Mountains, but deeper inside, in a valley. I discovered it by chance while searching for a spiritual herb called Red Jade Snake Grass," Qi Chan'er replied. "However, there are demonic beasts guarding it, and I couldn't retrieve the fruit alone."

"You're really taking too many risks," Qi Chuan sighed, now understanding why Qi Chan'er had been surrounded by four Water Cloud Crocodiles earlier—this wasn't the first time she had acted recklessly.

Qi Chan'er blushed. "After this, I'll be more careful in the future." Her previous impulsiveness had stemmed from her eagerness to improve her strength quickly. But after nearly dying and being saved by Qi Chuan, she had learned that recklessness had no place in cultivation—life was the foundation of the immortal path.

This was the first lesson the cultivation world had taught her.

"Tell me more about the specifics," Qi Chuan said.

Qi Chan'er nodded. "The demonic beasts in the valley are a swarm of Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees—lower-tier first-grade demonic beasts, and among the weakest of their rank. However, their numbers are terrifying. If they attack en masse, even a high-tier first-grade demonic beast would be reduced to bones in an instant."

"That terrifying?" Qi Chuan was surprised. He had thought the Cloudrise Mountains were relatively safe, but such deadly bees existed here?

"With such a swarm guarding the valley, doesn't that mean the Spirit Ginseng Fruit is out of reach?" he asked.

"Normally, yes," Qi Chan'er admitted. "But the swarm there only numbers in the hundreds—not a massive colony—so their overall strength isn't overwhelming. Plus, I have a way to lure most of them away."

She produced a jade vial and opened it, revealing a dark, viscous liquid that emitted a strong, nauseating stench of decay mixed with blood.

"This is the blood of a lower-tier first-grade demonic beast, the Rotting Centipede. I bought it earlier. In my grandfather's collection, I read that this blood has an irresistible allure for Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees."

"I'll use this to lure away most of the bees, leaving only a few in the valley. You can then enter and retrieve the Spirit Ginseng Fruit," she explained, looking at Qi Chuan expectantly.

If her grandfather's book was correct, this method would work without issue. Even so, she couldn't do it alone—she needed someone to enter the valley while she distracted the bees. That was why she had hesitated to act before, not trusting other outer disciples or even the two Qi family members who had joined the sect with her—they were only at the peak of the third level of Qi Refinement.

But now, Qi Chuan was the perfect candidate—strong, trustworthy, and someone who had already saved her life. With his help, the plan would surely succeed. Moreover, if it worked, the Spirit Ginseng Fruit would partially repay her debt to him.

It was a win-win situation—if Qi Chuan agreed.

"It does sound a bit risky..." Qi Chuan mused. A swarm of hundreds of Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees was no joke. If the Rotting Centipede blood didn't work as well as expected, leaving too many bees behind, he'd be in serious danger entering the valley alone.

"How about this?" Qi Chan'er suggested, sensing his hesitation. "I'll test the Rotting Centipede blood first to see how many bees it lures away. If most of them leave, you can enter the valley. If too many remain, we'll call it off. Does that sound fair?"

She added, "The Spirit Ginseng Tree should have six fruits. No matter how many we get, you'll take three first. If there are more than six, the extras are yours too. And if there are other spiritual herbs in the valley, you can gather them as well—anything extra you find is yours to keep."

She stared at Qi Chuan intently, willing him to agree. She was making such generous concessions to repay him for saving her life—something she wouldn't do for just anyone.

"...Alright," Qi Chuan finally agreed after some thought. She had gone to great lengths to persuade him, and it seemed she genuinely wanted to repay him. Besides, he could assess the situation before deciding whether to enter the valley. If things looked too dangerous, he could always back out.

Even if something unexpected happened, as long as he wasn't facing a hundred or more Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees, he wasn't too worried. After all, he had more than just the Fireball Technique mastered—his Water Arrow, Golden Skin, Earth Wall, and Wood Vine Techniques had all reached the Great Completion stage. Any one of these would be a formidable skill even among late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.

And the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees were only lower-tier first-grade beasts—nothing to be overly concerned about. If things went smoothly, obtaining three Spirit Ginseng Fruits would be a nice bonus. And if there were other valuable herbs in the valley, he could gather those too.

With that settled, he could only hope for good luck.
