# Chapter 11: Life-Slaying Incantation

The next day, Lu Yang waited an entire day in his cave abode. No one came.

The three black-clad men seemed as if they weren't disciples of the Initial Saint Sect at all; their disappearance didn't cause the slightest ripple. No one even came to investigate the situation.

Lu Yang sighed once more. He didn't doubt that the Saint Sect, possessing the life lamps of all disciples, would be unaware of their deaths. Now, it seemed that "mutual slaughter among disciples" was likely an unwritten rule. As long as it wasn't blown out of proportion and became widely known, no one would bother with a detailed investigation.

After all, the Demonic Sect was treacherous and unpredictable. If someone died, perhaps it was to silence them, or for wealth, or perhaps they knew something they shouldn't. What if an investigation truly uncovered something? So, it was better not to investigate.

"As expected of the Saint Sect," Lu Yang mused, then relaxed and began collecting the spoils of war.

First were the disciple tokens. To Lu Yang's surprise, the tokens of the three black-clad men contained a whopping 400 contribution points, an amount far exceeding common sense.

"So they were habitual offenders," Lu Yang frowned deeply. He searched further, and apart from some miscellaneous items, only a secret manual titled *Qi Concealment Art* truly captivated him.

From Lu Yang's perspective, these three black-clad men were highly skilled at concealing their True Qi. If his own cultivation hadn't broken through, granting him a qualitative leap in both True Qi and spiritual sense, he likely wouldn't have even detected their infiltration. This demonstrated the power of the *Qi Concealment Art*, truly a trump card.

"More importantly, this has nothing to do with the Saint Sect!" Saint Sect cultivation techniques were only recorded on disciple tokens, yet the *Qi Concealment Art* was a physical manual. This implied it was likely a personal fortuitous encounter for the three black-clad men. Thus, there was no need to worry about the Saint Sect having counter-measures.

"When you're sleepy, a pillow appears—what a good death!" Thinking this, Lu Yang sincerely collected their corpses, dug a pit, and buried them, ensuring they rested in peace.

Then, a thought suddenly struck him: "This *Qi Concealment Art* is so profound, and it wasn't passed down by the Saint Sect. Where did they get it? Could there be an even greater fortuitous encounter behind this?" Instantly, Lu Yang's mind became active.

However, he quickly restrained his greed, his gaze returning to calm: "No rush, no rush. Perhaps I can befriend these three in their next lives." There would always be an opportunity!

After helping the three men rest in peace, Lu Yang took out his disciple token and began to check the materials needed for refining a sword pellet, as Yun Miaoqing had told him earlier.

"To refine a sword pellet, one needs to gather three liang of refined gold essence, three liang of jade marrow, two liang of cinnabar, and two liang of sword qi, totaling ten liang. Then, supplemented by True Fire and Divine Water, it must be calcined and cooled to remove impurities, before slowly refining it with sword art secrets until it merges with the essence, qi, and spirit of the refiner, only then can it truly be completed."

As Lu Yang recalled the method for refining a sword pellet, he flipped through the item catalog. The more he looked, the uglier his expression became.

"Refined gold essence, jade marrow, cinnabar, sword qi, a uniform price of 100 contribution points per liang. True Water, 500 contribution points per gourd. True Fire, 500 contribution points per wisp…"

"2000 contribution points!?"

Lu Yang gritted his teeth. He had heard Yun Miaoqing say that disciples of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion would receive a sword pellet bestowed by their master after breaking through to the Qi Refinement stage. Yet, in the Initial Saint Sect, it actually cost 2000 contribution points?

An ordinary disciple would have to work like a dog for the Saint Sect for twenty years, without eating or drinking, just to gather that many contribution points! Damn the Demonic Sect! Such an exorbitant price instantly extinguished Lu Yang's pride over his recent small fortune, making him realize anew the reality of being a pauper.

"In that case, 400 contribution points are somewhat useless."

According to Lu Yang's plan, he would choose to retain his cultivation in his next life after restarting, so anything he obtained in this life couldn't be carried over. Therefore, buying any good items with these 400 contribution points would be meaningless to him.

As for cultivation, the middle Qi Refinement stage was completely different from the early stage. Even if he used all 400 contribution points, it would be impossible for him to break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement.

"It seems I can only exchange them for cultivation techniques." After all, compared to treasures, cultivation techniques and divine abilities, as knowledge, could be carried over to the next life. Thinking this, Lu Yang immediately left his cave abode and headed to the Scripture Pavilion.

"Oh, it's you, kid?" The old man at the entrance of the Scripture Pavilion actually remembered Lu Yang, his face showing surprise. "Are you here to exchange for cultivation techniques again? Looks like you've struck it rich."

"As Senior Brother said, good fortune smiles on me." Lu Yang cupped his hands, then entered the Scripture Pavilion. This time, his intention was clear: he sought a powerful divine ability specifically for risking his life in battle.

Soon, Lu Yang locked onto his target. "*Life-Slaying Incantation*: 300 contribution points."

This divine ability was very peculiar, akin to a Buddhist "closed-mouth meditation." It required the cultivator to nurture a surge of killing intent within their chest, refining it day and night with True Qi, intertwining it with their very life. Normally unused, one could speak freely. But when activated, with a single opening of the mouth and a shout of "Kill!", the entire surge of killing intent, imbued with one's life force, would instantly erupt, shaking souls and shattering spirits, proving irresistible. However, once this surge of killing intent was fully unleashed, the user would also die, a true method of mutual destruction.

"Excellent, it can kill others and kill myself. It's perfect for me!"

Possessing the Book of Hundred Lives, Lu Yang's greatest fear wasn't death itself, but rather being unable to die, because the Book of Hundred Lives couldn't be activated voluntarily; it only worked upon his death. Therefore, he desperately needed a self-slaying divine ability.

After exchanging for the cultivation technique at the Scripture Pavilion, Lu Yang immediately sat cross-legged and began to comprehend the incantation.

"The Life-Slaying Incantation, storing qi in the chest, the most important aspect is this surge of killing intent. The higher the quality of the killing intent, the greater the power unleashed when the Life-Slaying Incantation erupts."

"As the saying goes: when Heaven unleashes killing intent, stars shift their positions; when Earth unleashes killing intent, dragons and serpents rise; when man unleashes killing intent, heaven and earth overturn. Therefore, killing intent in the world is divided into three types: Heavenly Slaughter, Earthly Slaughter, and Human Slaughter. Heavenly and Earthly Slaughter are rare, encountered only once in centuries, while Human Slaughter is ubiquitous, with the killing intent from weapons being the most supreme."

Within the Scripture Pavilion, Lu Yang began to refine the killing intent.

"Fortunately, the materials are readily available…" The so-called Human Slaughter qi was mostly extracted from weapons used by those with killing intent. Coincidentally, Lu Yang had kept the weapons of the three black-clad men. He directly drew out the killing intent from them, refining it into his body little by little.

In an instant, Lu Yang felt as if a thousand knives were scraping his bones and cutting his flesh within his chest, the pain unbearable. Yet, he clenched his lips tightly, not daring to open his mouth.

Because at this critical moment of refinement, if he opened his mouth and the qi leaked, he would undoubtedly die on the spot!

After a long while, Lu Yang finally felt the killing intent in his chest gradually stabilize, completely connecting with his True Qi. With a single thought, it would erupt.

"I wonder how powerful it is…" Thinking this, a trace of anticipation appeared on Lu Yang's face. He decided that before he died in this life, he absolutely had to use the Life-Slaying Incantation once to see its true power.

Returning to the entrance of the Scripture Pavilion, Lu Yang unexpectedly found the old man at the doorway cursing loudly.

"That son of a bitch, lucky bastard…" The old man held his disciple token, his wrinkled hands trembling uncontrollably, his old face contorted, making it impossible to discern his exact emotions.

Lu Yang stepped forward and asked curiously, "Senior Brother? What happened?"

"What happened?" The old man's eyes widened in fury upon hearing this. He fiercely slammed his disciple token onto the ground and sneered, "It's all over the place. See for yourself."

Before his words fully fell, the old man slumped back into his rocking chair, looking sullen.

Lu Yang was completely bewildered until he also opened his disciple token and saw the latest news, finally understanding what had transpired.

"Grand Prize in the Merit Pool Finally Has a Winner!"

"The Rainbow Merit Fish was drawn by the newly inducted disciple Xiao Shiye. A True Lord personally awarded him the billion-point grand prize in public. After receiving the prize, Xiao Shiye entered seclusion and his whereabouts are unknown!"
