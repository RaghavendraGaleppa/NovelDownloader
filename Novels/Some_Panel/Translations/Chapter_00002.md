## Chapter 2: Difficulty in Cultivation

Eighteen years.
A full eighteen years.
Yang Ji was finally free.
Without Luo Xiong's restraints and threats, the sky was now vast, the land wide; he could roam freely, go anywhere he pleased.
The repressed emotions of eighteen years were released in an instant. He had wanted to shout out loud, but the suffocating feeling that had risen to his chest was exhaled heavily through his nostrils.
With Luo Xiong dead, the karma was settled, and a sense of emptiness surprisingly welled up in his heart.
Shaking his head, Yang Ji reached out and pulled the flying sword from Luo Xiong's chest.
Then, he rummaged through Luo Xiong's body and soon found a palm-sized storage bag as he wished.
Yang Ji took a deep breath, his heart pounding with excitement, and quickly extended his divine sense to probe it.
In an instant, his eyes lit up with surprise.
"Indeed! My sword was as swift as wind and as fast as lightning; that nominal master of mine never expected it. One strike left him severely wounded and his spirit weak, unable even to self-destruct his storage bag. This was a free boon for me."
Yang Ji was overjoyed.
His divine sense immediately entered the storage bag. After a quick scan, his face quickly fell.
Inside, apart from a few old-fashioned robes and some silver, there was absolutely nothing else.
"It seems that my nominal master exhausted all his savings to nurture me. There isn't even a single spirit stone left, and all the pills are used up."
Yang Ji shook his head repeatedly, but still, acquiring a storage bag was a gain.
He immediately prepared to take out his nominal master's robes and cremate them together.
But just as he lifted a corner of a robe, his expression instantly froze.
"This is..."
"《Light Body Art》, 《Flowing Water Sword Art》, 《Spirit Water Art》?"
"Hahahaha, truly my good master! He always refused to teach me the complete Spirit Water Art. I never thought the latter five layers would be stored in his storage bag. It seems I must give him a grand funeral after all!"
Yang Ji looked at the three secret manuals under the robes, brimming with excitement. With these latter five layers of cultivation techniques, he could cultivate to the tenth layer of Qi Condensation.
In addition, obtaining the 《Flowing Water Sword Art》 and 《Light Body Art》 also increased his strength, giving him greater confidence to face this cultivation world he had not yet fully stepped into.
Yang Ji was in a great mood. He quickly dealt with Luo Xiong's body, burying it deep within the cave he was in.
This cave was warm in winter and cool in summer, with bluestone paving the ground and all sorts of daily necessities. Yang Ji planned to cultivate in seclusion here.
Outside the cave, he now turned his gaze to himself, and various information displays quickly appeared on his body.

【Name: Yang Ji】
【Root Bone: Low-grade】
【Lifespan: 18/100】
【Cultivation Realm: Qi Condensation 5th Layer (1/1600)】
【Cultivation Art: Spirit Water Art】
【Techniques: Flowing Water Sword Art (Uninitiated), Light Body Art (Uninitiated)】

Yang Ji sat cross-legged, his posture solemn and dignified, forming hand seals. He quickly entered a meditative state.

【You began to comprehend the Flowing Water Sword Art.】
【You misunderstood the direction.】
【You adjusted promptly and comprehended again.】
【You misunderstood the direction again.】
【After five attempts, you finally embarked on the correct path of comprehension.】
【One day passed. You continued to comprehend and finally grasped a trace of the True Intent of Flowing Water.】
【Flowing Water, meaning to follow the water; a sword thrust, in line with the great momentum of the water flow, swift and fierce, quick and rapid.】
【Your Flowing Water Sword Art has been initiated. You have comprehended the Following-the-Water Sword.】
【Flowing Water Sword Art (Initiated): 1/10】

Facing the information display, Yang Ji was calm.
It had been the same when he cultivated the 《Spirit Water Art》, with correction prompts.
This was the most satisfying aspect of his "Golden Finger."
Cultivating arts and techniques allowed him to avoid detours and maximize his limited time.
Back then, he had comprehended the first layer of the Spirit Water Art and cultivated a trace of spiritual power within a day. Luo Xiong had even exclaimed that he was a genius, a genius with extraordinary comprehension.
However, in Yang Ji's view, he merely applied his effort in the right place, achieving twice the result with half the effort.

After the 《Flowing Water Sword Art》 was initiated, Yang Ji immediately stood up, picked up a long sword forged from ordinary iron by a furnace nearby, and began to practice.

【You began to practice the Flowing Water Sword Art.】
【The sword energy was sharp, each strike like a radiant light. With over ten years of basic stabbing sword technique experience, you quickly got the hang of it, and your proficiency continuously increased.】
【You possess the True Intent of Flowing Water. Spiritual power flows through the sword body, transforming into a raging river. Drawing the sword along the water, the sword energy whistles, like a furious dragon leaping out of the vast ocean, astonishingly powerful.】
【Your sword strikes were like wind, each one swift and fierce. A white gleam appeared in the air—that was the ultimate speed and unmatched sharpness.】
【After three days of continuous diligent practice, Flowing Water Sword Art proficiency +6.】

*Bang!*
Suddenly, with a loud bang, the long sword Yang Ji had thrust out exploded, turning into countless fragments that shot in all directions.
"The sword exploded?"
Yang Ji stared blankly at the hilt remaining in his hand, shaking his head slightly. "A mortal sword is, after all, not a magic tool. Although I carefully controlled the amount of spiritual power I infused, it still exploded."
There were no usable magic tools in Luo Xiong's storage bag, which was a bit regrettable.
Now without a suitable flying sword, he gave up for the time being, sat cross-legged, and began to comprehend the 《Light Body Art》.

The 《Light Body Art》, like the 《Flowing Water Sword Art》, was easily initiated within a day.
After practicing for a while in the cave, Yang Ji quickly discovered that due to the cave's limited size, the Light Body Art could not be fully unleashed.
So, when his proficiency reached 2, he gave up on technique cultivation and began to circulate the Spirit Water Art to absorb spiritual energy and raise his cultivation.
Although the 《Flowing Water Sword Art》 and 《Light Body Art》 were temporarily put aside, Yang Ji placed extreme importance on practicing techniques.
Luo Xiong had once told him, "Cultivate immortality without cultivating techniques, and you'll be beaten by anyone you meet outside."
Cultivating immortality, in the eyes of mortals, seemed free and unconstrained. Little did they know that the path of cultivation was filled with strife. If one didn't possess the ability to kill an enemy with a single sword, how could one gain a foothold in this world of cultivators, fraught with blades and blood?
Luo Xiong's words and personal example served as the best warning.
He had once told Yang Ji about some past events.
The reason his foundation was damaged and his cultivation difficult to advance was because he had gotten into a dispute and fought with someone, who then destroyed his foundation.
This was the pain of his entire life.
One could say that Luo Xiong was also a tragic figure, a small microcosm of this cruel xianxia world.
In this vast xianxia world, hidden beneath the desire for "eternal life" were slaughter, competition, blades, and blood.
The stairway to pursue eternal life was destined to be piled high with withered bones!
Although he knew eternal life was difficult.
But ever since Yang Ji learned that he had transmigrated to a cultivation world, his goal had been eternal life.
He wanted to follow the path of Qin Shihuang and Han Wudi, to pursue the immortal path to longevity.
However, limited by his poor root bone, his cultivation was too slow.
For eighteen years, even with Luo Xiong providing many cultivation pills, Yang Ji's cultivation had only reached the fifth layer of Qi Condensation.
Yang Ji knew his root bone was poor, so he cultivated diligently, not wasting a single moment that could improve his cultivation.
At this moment, he sat on a meditation mat, hands forming a seal, one above and one below, placed at his dantian.
As the Spirit Water Art circulated, the surrounding spiritual energy slowly gathered, like wisps of green smoke, flowing into his palms.
The spiritual energy was quickly absorbed by his root bone, entering his meridians, and circulating through his body.
Finally, after being refined by the cultivation art, it transformed into pure spiritual power and converged into his dantian.
Half a day passed. After cultivating eighty-six cycles, Yang Ji slowly opened his eyes.
But as he inwardly observed the spiritual power in his dantian, which had barely changed, he couldn't help but frown.
"The spiritual energy freely wandering in the world is too impure; my low-grade root bone struggles to absorb it. The spiritual energy refined in one go is too little. Such simple cultivation is simply too slow."
"No wonder my nominal master used to inadvertently show [Disgust] above his head when he looked at me."
"Without pills to provide pure spiritual energy, my low-grade root bone's cultivation speed has been reverted to its original slow state."
Yang Ji sighed slightly, murmuring reluctantly,
"I never thought the period when my nominal master was 'feeding' me was my happiest time cultivating."
He was also incredibly fortunate that in all these years, his nominal master hadn't found anyone else with a root bone and no background, otherwise, he would have been killed off.
