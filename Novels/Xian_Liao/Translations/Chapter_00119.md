# Chapter 119: The Kill  

The small bronze cauldron was too damaged and completely devoid of spiritual energy. Zhou Qing kept it for Tang Jieyuan and the others to continue deciphering the ancient inscriptions.  

Additionally, to reward Tang Jieyuan for his contributions, Zhou Qing gave him Condensed Qi Pills and Marrow-Cleansing Pills, along with a Qi Refining cultivation manual. Tang Jieyuan already possessed considerable martial skills, and with the aid of these pills, becoming a Qi Refiner would be far easier for him than for Lin Wan'er or Butcher Hu.  

As for the great scholars, they were too advanced in age. Zhou Qing could only offer them some health-preserving pills and compensate them in other ways.
