# Chapter 371: Sweeping All Directions Clean

Sensing the hidden auras lurking about, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but curl his lips.

"Master Bi Yuan said that supreme grandmasters of the Ninth Realm were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns..."

His fingers crushed a wisp of dragon vein residual qi drifting from the Imperial Mauscle, while the Ten Extremities True Qi surged like rivers beneath his skin. "Now it seems, while they aren't as common as roadside cabbages, they're more like poisonous mushrooms sprouting after the rain."

At this moment, Yujing City was experiencing the most brutal street warfare in its eight hundred years since the founding of the dynasty.

Li Haomiao personally led one hundred thousand Black Armor Army troops through the Vermilion Bird Gate. The dark torrent of heavily armored soldiers crashed into the fire wall constructed by the Imperial Guard using the "Scorching Heaven Extermination Formation."

The elite Imperial Guards, clad in red scale armor, actually mixed their own essence blood with sulfur and saltpeter to spew forth. Wherever they passed, even the bluestone tiles melted into glass-like slag.

"Form the 'Iron Chain Crossing River Formation'!" Li Haomiao's roar pierced through the battlefield.

His gaze wasn't on the battle before him, but looked ahead toward the depths of the Great Zhou Imperial Palace.

Today was the battlefield for Xu Yunfan and the Empress.

Now that the Great Zhou's imperial authority had shifted, the Empress was naturally in grave danger. With decisive resolve, Li Haomiao would not let such a once-in-a-millennium opportunity slip by.

The front ranks of the Black Armor Army suddenly raised massive shields of black iron over a zhang high. Soldiers in the rear swung chains soaked in cold spring water. Three thousand chains twisted like black dragons, forcibly tearing open a gap in the fire wall.

Martial artists hidden within the formation seized this moment, stepping on the chains as if descending from clouds, nearly routing the Imperial Guard.

"Your Highness has quite the手段."

A sinister voice came from a pile of rubble.

The Imperial Guard commander suddenly tore off his human skin disguise. His face, covered in blue-black demonic patterns, twisted and distorted violently. Two curved bone horns pierced from his temples, his pupils shrank into two crimson vertical lines, and the corners of his mouth split all the way to his ears, revealing serrated, sinister fangs.

This made Li Haomiao's brow involuntarily twitch.

"Bloodline Reversion?! People from Great乾?"

The ultimate form of Great乾's True Blood was Bloodline Reversion, comparable to a supreme grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation in Great Zhou.

The newcomer let out a beast-like growl from his throat. Dark purple vein patterns appeared beneath his exposed skin, squirming like living things.

That was the Great乾 royal family's unique "Xuanming Demon Blood," rumored to originate from ancient demons beneath the northern glaciers.

As his bloodline boiled, frosty mist rose around him. His ten fingers turned into sharp claws, and the cold iron ground was actually corroded into honeycomb-like holes by the leaking demonic qi.

"Your Highness has good eyesight."

The half-demon commander's voice now carried dual tones, as if both human and demon were speaking simultaneously. "Unfortunately, Great Zhou's fate has run out. Today, I shall use the blood of you, the commander of the Black Armor Army, to sacrifice to Great乾's southern expedition banner..."

Although warning bells were ringing frantically in Li Haomiao's heart, if he retreated, the Black Armor Army behind him would surely collapse like a mountain.

He sneered: "Just a mongrel demon blood, making yourself neither human nor ghost."

"Seeking death."

The half-demon flew into a rage and instantly pounced toward Li Haomiao. His ten claws tore through the air, splitting the white turbid waves.

At the critical moment, a sonic boom-like sharp sound came from the sky.

Xu Yunfan descended like a falling meteor, his right palm carrying the chaotic vortex of Ten Extremities True Qi, and slapped it onto the top of this half-demon's head.

The sharp claw that had just touched the edge of Li Haomiao's three-inch radius began to convulse wildly, then shattered piece by piece like rice thrown into a millstone.

"Xu... Yun... Fan..."

The half-demon's pupils shrank to needle-points from terror.

Xu Yunfan's name had long been like thunder to his ears.

Now seeing Xu Yunfan arrive here, he naturally knew the battle in the deep palace had already been decided.

The demonic qi in his body flowed uncontrollably backward, surging along his meridians toward Xu Yunfan's palm.

His skin began to collapse, muscle fibers withered like dried fish maw. In just a few breaths, he turned into a dried corpse draped in a black robe.

Xu Yunfan looked at the cluster of demonic qi in his palm, frowned deeply, then breathed out a sigh and casually scattered the condensed demonic qi into the air.

Before figuring out how to refine it, forcibly absorbing it would likely make his true qi impure.

Now he could absorb the true qi of those five great sects precisely because he relied on the Ten Extremities Qi Cultivation's special effect of "All Methods Return to One," which allowed him to sort and purify it.

He looked at the stunned Li Haomiao and smiled slightly, somewhat teasingly: "Your Majesty, it seems you are about to ascend the throne."

Li Haomiao's expression relaxed slightly, then he laughed and cursed: "Seems you've become the world's number one too."

"As it should be."

In the next half hour, Yujing City became Xu Yunfan's hunting ground.

He shuttled through the marketplaces, the Ten Extremities True Qi spreading like a spider web.

The Xuanzhen Sect old Taoist hiding in the cellar of the Drunken Immortal Tower had his dragon-tiger pill qi drained from afar.

The Amitabha Temple's Ku character-level monk disguised as a peddler was refined into golden powder along with his staff.

Even a Nine Luminaries Sect elder who tried to use the "Turtle Breath Fake Death Technique" to fool him was pulled out from a pile of corpses by Xu Yunfan, his heavenly spirit cap crushed and his scorching sun true qi sucked dry.

When Xu Yunfan returned to the imperial palace square clutching the neck of the last Ninth Realm expert, Li Haomiao was directing the Black Armor Army to clean up the remaining stubborn Imperial Guard forces.

Seeing the dried corpse dangling in his hand, this usually composed prince couldn't help but twitch at the corners of his eyes: "You've actually turned the 'Ten Extremities Martial Path' into a sickle for harvesting crops."

"So many Ninth Realm experts in Great Zhou, in three days they'd just become nourishment for those outer realm demons anyway. Better to let me take them. I am, after all, a person of this world, so this counts as contributing my part."

Xu Yunfan kicked the dried corpse at his feet, then suddenly sensed a fluctuation in the aura. He narrowed his eyes and looked toward the direction of the Imperial Observatory. "Wait... there's still a big fish hiding there!"

Before his words fell, the observatory's pavilion exploded with a bang.

A hunched figure wearing a star-patterned ritual robe shot up into the sky—it was actually Guo Lang, the director who should have died yesterday!

In his hand, he held not the Dragon Suppression Seal, but a pulsating紫-black heart!

"So heavy demonic qi."

Xu Yunfan's heart paused slightly. The Ten Extremities True Qi exploded in a无形 ripple at the soles of his feet, and his figure instantly vanished as a residual shadow.

"Using the Heart of the Demon as sacrifice, I request the Nine Nethers..."

Guo Lang's thin fingers had just formed the third seal when a crisp sound of a spine breaking came from his throat.

Xu Yunfan appeared behind him like a ghost. His left hand formed a blade and shattered his cervical vertebrae, while his right palm pierced through his hunched chest cavity. The紫-black Heart of the Demon was still convulsing when it was crushed by his five fingers into a cloud of poisonous mist.

"Assisting the tyrant's evil..."

Xu Yunfan甩去 the bloodstains on his palm, coldly watching the twisted faces emerging from the purple mist. "The Empress is already dead, and you still want to summon outer realm demons in advance?"

He stepped down and crushed Guo Lang's rolling head. "Such loyalty—you might as well continue serving your master in the Nine Nethers."

Xu Yunfan slowly withdrew his hand, then his brow moved slightly. His Martial Path Heavenly Eye suddenly opened wide, and in his pupils flowing with golden light, the entire outline of Yujing City was reflected.

The streets and alleys where smoke had yet to disperse, the routed残兵, the scattered hostility lurking in the shadows—all were as clear as palm lines.

"Quite thoroughly cleaned."

His gaze suddenly turned to the southeast, the Ten Extremities True Qi surging through his spine like a dragon.

That was the direction of the Sword Pavilion in Jiangnan Dao.

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. The debt for the Sword Pavilion's Celestial Pivot Sword Master's sneak attack yesterday should be paid with the entire pavilion's sword canon true qi.
