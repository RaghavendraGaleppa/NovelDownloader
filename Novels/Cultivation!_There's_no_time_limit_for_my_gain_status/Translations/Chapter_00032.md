# Chapter 32: The Coffin  

After gathering together, the group headed toward the mission area.  

"Do you already have a target for the outbound mission?"  

Within their circle, Yu Banxia, Qu Qianfan, Wang Liuliang, Lu Qianqian, and the others were relatively close. Jiang Li and Yan Hong hadn't spent as much time with them, so their relationship was naturally a bit more distant.  

Outbound missions required comprehensive consideration of factors like distance, direction, difficulty, potential enemies, and necessary preparations. They couldn’t be decided on a whim.  

They must have discussed it beforehand—Jiang Li was the only one left in the dark.  

"Last time’s gathering mission yielded decent rewards, but staying in the jungle for so long was tough. We were constantly short on supplies and had to stay alert for danger at all times. It was exhausting."  

Yu Banxia’s words earned nods of agreement from the others, especially Lu Qianqian, who had been driven nearly mad by the experience of going weeks without a proper bath.  

"So this time, we’re planning to take a mission in a mortal city."  

Jiang Li turned his gaze to the second mission board in the task area—the one designated for mid-stage Qi Refinement disciples.  

Compared to the missions for early-stage disciples, the rewards here were noticeably higher, but so were the difficulties. Simple combat tasks, such as hunting or eliminating low-level demonic beasts, were now listed.  

"Wait, mortal kingdoms can also issue missions to immortal sects?"  

Jiang Li searched carefully and was surprised to find quite a few commissions posted by mortal kingdoms.  

"After all, the immortal world is still built upon the foundation of the mortal world. The new disciples who join the sect every year, the food and supplies we use—aren’t they all tributes from mortal nations?"  

"In return, immortal sects have some obligation to protect mortal kingdoms."  

"Of course, the price they pay for each mission is enough to make any kingdom wince in pain."  

Yu Banxia, who came from a background with ties to the immortal world, knew much more about this than Jiang Li.  

But it made sense. No matter what kind of development was sought, a solid population base was essential. If mortals were all devoured by demons and monsters, wouldn’t cultivation be a pointless endeavor?  

"The mission we’re taking is this one—the case of mass child comas in the Kingdom of Yinnan."  

"The details aren’t specified in the mission, but there have been no casualties. It’s just a simple investigation."  

"We can take it easy. Even if we fail, there shouldn’t be any danger."  

Yu Banxia handed over a few pages of notes containing brief intelligence on the mission.  

Jiang Li skimmed through them. Just as Yu Banxia had said, it was indeed a straightforward inspection task.  

"Alright, I have no objections. When do we leave?"  

**Appraisal Technique!**  

**[Name: Yu Banxia, Gender: Male, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Mid-Stage Qi Refinement, Threat Level: Medium]**  

**[Name: Qu Qianfan, Gender: Male, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Early-Stage Qi Refinement, Threat Level: Low]**  

**[Name: Wang Liuliang, Gender: Male, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Early-Stage Qi Refinement, Threat Level: Low]**  

**[Name: Lu Qianqian, Gender: Female, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Early-Stage Qi Refinement, Threat Level: Low]**  

...  

Jiang Li swiftly scanned all seven of them with his Appraisal Technique.  

Since joining the immortal sect, he hadn’t used the technique on others much. He was afraid that if he carelessly appraised a powerful cultivator and was discovered, he’d be in trouble.  

But with these people, Jiang Li had a good grasp of their backgrounds. Their strength was definitely inferior to his, so appraising them wouldn’t cause any issues.  

Among them, Yu Banxia, at mid-stage Qi Refinement, was undoubtedly the strongest. A medium threat level meant he could actually inflict some harm on Jiang Li.  

After agreeing to set out the next day, the group dispersed to make their final preparations.  

Jiang Li headed to the outer sect’s burial grounds. The closer he got to the center, the colder the environment became.  

By the time he reached the heart of the graveyard, he could see tiny ice crystals mixed into the dark soil.  

This was where he had been cultivating all along. Fifteen locust wood stakes were buried beneath the ground here.  

Suddenly feeling inspired, Jiang Li crouched down, slapped the ground with one hand, and uttered a low command:  

"**Impure World Reincarnation! Rise!**"  

As his voice fell, a pitch-black coffin slowly emerged from the ground at the center of the circle formed by the fifteen locust wood stakes.  

A thick, heavy chain was coiled around the coffin, rattling as the sarcophagus rose.  

Alright, this wasn’t actually the Impure World Reincarnation. The coffin merely contained a single zombie.  

Jiang Li hadn’t been idly meditating all this time in the inner sect’s burial grounds. He had spent considerable effort selecting a complete corpse on the verge of turning into a zombie.  

According to the tombstone, it had once been a late-stage Qi Refinement disciple who died seventy years ago. Due to an accident, his path of cultivation had been cut short, leaving him buried in this forgotten place.  

Thanks to some special arrangements made by the sect during burial, the corpse’s yin energy and corpse energy had been suppressed, preventing it from truly transforming into a zombie.  

Only after Jiang Li dug it up and used the **Seed Puppet Corpse Technique** to implant a puppet seed did the restraints finally break.  

Once the suppression was removed, the decades of accumulated yin and corpse energy caused the corpse to undergo zombification right before Jiang Li’s eyes, transforming into a bloodthirsty white-haired zombie.  

However, the puppet seed had already taken deep root in the corpse before the transformation. Even after becoming a zombie, the white-haired corpse had no ability to resist Jiang Li’s control.  

After some modifications and guidance, Jiang Li placed the zombie and a large number of yin-attributed objects into a coffin made of locust wood.  

He then bound the coffin with an executioner’s chain—one that had restrained a thousand condemned prisoners—before burying it in the eye of the feng shui array formed by the fifteen locust wood stakes.  

Nourished by the dense yin and corpse energy of the outer sect’s mass graves for several months, it was finally ready for use.  

Grasping the chain with one hand, Jiang Li lifted the coffin and slung it over his shoulder with ease before walking away.  

With his current strength, a mere two or three hundred pounds was nothing.  

"Jiang Li, what is this...?"  

The next day, when the group gathered at the entrance of the Hidden Scripture Valley, everyone—including the gatekeepers—was stunned by Jiang Li’s "luggage."  

It was hard to say whether he was being morbidly prepared or just plain foolish.  

Who brought a coffin along on a mission?  

Was he that worried about not having a bed to sleep in after death?
