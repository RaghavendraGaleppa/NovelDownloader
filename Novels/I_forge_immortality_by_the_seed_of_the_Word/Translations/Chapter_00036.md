# Chapter 36: The Birth of Talisman Origins  

Luo Du Island, Spirit Crane Garden.  

Zhang Jing gently guided his spirit crane to land beside the senior disciple who had lent it to him earlier.  

"Senior Brother, I'm returning the spirit crane unharmed. I'll take my leave now," he said, handing over the bracelet.  

"Take care, Junior Brother," the senior replied with a smile.  

Watching Zhang Jing's retreating figure, the senior muttered under his breath, "A new junior in the Luo Du squad? Only a little over a month into cultivation, yet his Qi Refinement second-layer foundation is already so refined?"  

---  

After leaving the Spirit Crane Garden, Zhang Jing headed straight for the Merit Hall. He remembered he hadn't collected this month's batch of Purple Spirit Pills, and the bottle Senior Zhang Yangchu had given him was nearly empty.  

Earlier, he had considered taking advantage of the spirit crane to visit the market—not to buy talisman-making materials or spirit brushes, but to purchase some Spirit Nourishing Pills. With the various skill bonuses at his disposal, Zhang Jing had noticed his pill consumption rate during cultivation was alarmingly fast. A single bottle of Purple Spirit Pills only lasted him about ten days of intensive training.  

However, after some thought, he dismissed the idea. His cave abode was already saturated with abundant spiritual energy. Using Spirit Nourishing Pills now would only introduce impurities that might hinder his progress.  

Of course, Zhang Jing had also contemplated buying talisman materials at the market. But the problem was simple: he didn’t have enough spirit stones.  

Moreover, based on his last visit, the market shops primarily sold low-grade magical artifacts of inconsistent quality—half of them worn or outdated. Spirit brushes were even harder to come by. While spirit ink and paper were available, they suffered from similar issues.  

After careful consideration, Zhang Jing decided to purchase all his talisman-making tools and materials from the Thousand Techniques Pavilion instead.  

Lost in thought, he soon arrived at his cave abode.  

He took out his jade key, and the spiritual light enveloping the entrance rippled in response.  

---  

Inside the cave, Zhang Jing spent the better part of the day clearing out a chamber deep within, transforming it into a makeshift talisman workshop.  

The *Nine Evolutions Spirit Star Talisman Scripture* emphasized the importance of a tranquil, undisturbed environment for talisman crafting. Given how crucial this was to his path of cultivation, he couldn’t afford to be careless.  

Once everything was prepared, Zhang Jing took a deep breath and carefully laid out a sheet of spirit paper on the table. He then placed a large bottle of spirit ink to his right.  

Unlike the paper, the ink emitted a strong surge of spiritual energy the moment it was opened, accompanied by a faint metallic scent.  

"Does the spirit ink contain demon beast blood? No wonder it's so expensive," Zhang Jing mused.  

A spirit brush, pre-refined on his way back, appeared in his hand.  

He focused his mind, channeling spiritual energy and consciousness into the brush. Instantly, a sensation of effortless fluidity coursed through him, as if there were no resistance at all.  

Compared to manipulating his flying sword or the Water Cloud Shield, this brush was in a league of its own.  

Talisman crafting was delicate work, demanding precise control over both spiritual energy and consciousness. A high-quality brush could significantly improve success rates—this wasn’t just empty talk.  

That was why Zhang Jing had gritted his teeth and splurged on a premium mid-grade talisman brush.  

*"A craftsman must first sharpen his tools."* Besides, the investment would pay for itself soon enough. He’d earn back every bit of merit from his senior brothers and sisters in the sect.  

With that thought, Zhang Jing closed his eyes, immersing himself in the intricate teachings of the *Nine Evolutions Spirit Star Talisman Scripture*.  

The method recorded in the scripture was called *Spirit Star Nine Evolutions*.  

Its creator had observed the profound mysteries of the celestial bodies, mimicking the movement of the Nine Stars of the Northern Dipper. The brushwork involved seven overt strokes and two hidden ones—hence the name *Nine Evolutions*.  

This method purportedly enhanced the quality of talismans to an extraordinary degree.  

As time passed, Zhang Jing committed every nuance of the *Spirit Star Nine Evolutions* to memory.  

He then turned his attention to the talismans listed in the scripture: twelve low-grade, seven mid-grade, and four high-grade. They covered everything—offense, defense, long-range tracking, confinement, and spell-breaking.  

After careful consideration, Zhang Jing settled on the *Starlight Attraction Talisman*, one of the low-grade options.  

Once completed, this talisman would autonomously draw in starlight, storing it within. When activated, the starlight would shield the user, rendering them nearly impervious to spells and magical artifacts. It was hailed as one of the strongest defensive talismans among the low-grade tier.  

At least, that’s what the description claimed.  

Zhang Jing wasn’t overly concerned with the specifics. All he knew was that defensive talismans were the most expensive in the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

*Might as well start with this one.*  

Having made his choice, Zhang Jing focused entirely on the complex runes of the Starlight Attraction Talisman, engraving them into the depths of his mind.  

Then, in a single moment—  

His eyes snapped open, his expression serene.  

The spirit brush dipped lightly into the ink before descending onto the paper with flawless precision.  

In the next instant, his spiritual consciousness guided his energy to the brush tip, tracing the talisman’s intricate patterns.  

---  

**Failure.**  

The moment Zhang Jing lifted the brush slightly, the spiritual energy fluctuated wildly, ruining the talisman.  

His hand froze.  

A blank expression crossed his face before it twisted into exasperation.  

*Failed at the very first stroke?*  

*Is talisman-making deliberately mocking me?*  

A translucent jade talisman materialized before him, displaying a line of text:  

**[Nine Evolutions Spirit Star Talisman Scripture · Uninitiated (1/70)]**  

"Sixty-nine more experience points to go. That means sixty-nine more failures? No way—spirit paper and ink aren’t cheap!"  

Zhang Jing frowned.  

A phantom *Heart’s Eye* slowly opened.  

Originally, he had wanted to see how far he could get without relying on the *Heart’s Eye Seed*. Clearly, he had overestimated his financial resilience.  

When it came to learning talisman-making, the *Heart’s Eye Seed* was far more economical.  

He took out another sheet of spirit paper.  

Bolstered by the *Heart’s Eye* state, he began his second attempt with renewed confidence.  

A dozen breaths later—  

Zhang Jing stared at the ruined talisman before him, his expression complicated. He was beginning to understand Senior Liu’s earlier warnings.  

Talisman-making *was* notoriously difficult to master.  

This time, he had managed to complete half of the Starlight Attraction Talisman’s runes before failing.  

The progress was staggering, but failing even under the *Heart’s Eye* state was unexpected.  

Still—  

**[Nine Evolutions Spirit Star Talisman Scripture · Uninitiated (7/70)]**  

Despite another failure, the experience gain had jumped by six points.  

At this rate, Zhang Jing could potentially level up his talisman-making skill today and unlock a new ability.  

After steadying his breath, he dove back in.  

---  

Outside, the night was deep, but the cave remained as bright as day.  

Now, Zhang Jing slumped in his chair, staring excitedly at the completed Starlight Attraction Talisman on the table. It pulsed with intense spiritual energy.  

On his eleventh attempt—just as his spiritual energy and consciousness were on the verge of depletion—he had finally succeeded in perfectly inscribing the talisman’s runes.  

Every stroke was precise, every infusion of energy flawless. The entire process had been executed without a single misstep.  

True to the scripture’s claims, the *Spirit Star Nine Evolutions* method had produced a *superior-grade* low-level talisman.  

Zhang Jing was certain.  

The talisman before him was undoubtedly a top-tier product—the kind that would sell for two merit points in the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

His gaze shifted to the phantom jade talisman.
