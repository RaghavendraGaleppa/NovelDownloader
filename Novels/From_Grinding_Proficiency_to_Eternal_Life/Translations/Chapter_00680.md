# Chapter 680: So You Dare to Chase Me Here

As soon as True Lord Chiyang and True Lord Tongxuan stepped into the Aetelia World, their Golden Core aura, unrestrained and fully exposed, triggered a sudden, immense force from the world's will, binding them like invisible shackles.

The Heavenly Dao of this world awakened with a thunderous roar. Its cold and vast will instantly locked onto the two unwelcome guests who had crossed realms.

"This is bad!"

True Lord Tongxuan inwardly cursed. He instantly realized that they had likely been briefly misled by Xu Yunfan's karmic secret art, failing to conceal their auras in time.

After all, the Taihua Lingxu World was extremely proficient in invading other major realms; every sect had its own established system. Yet, they had been blinded by greed.

It must have been the karmic secret art Xu Yunfan covertly deployed earlier that had subtly influenced their perception, causing them to overlook this matter.

*Hum!*

Space trembled. Three gazes, each carrying a different kind of majesty, pierced through the void and focused on the two True Lords.

Directly ahead, the Lord of the Firmament, Lord Orion, materialized as if merging with the entire sky. His aura was as boundless as the atmosphere itself, wielding the power of the sky and air. The authority governing the birth and growth of all things flowed ceaselessly around him, with phantom images of flora breathing, withering, and perishing in the blink of an eye.

To the left, the God of Light, Orion, blazed with immeasurable holy radiance. His light was pure and overbearing, scattering all gloom like a walking sun. This was the manifestation of his Great Light and Immeasurable Authority; wherever the light reached, that was his divine kingdom.

To the right, the God of Darkness, Ymir, was shrouded behind surging curtains of eternal night. Only a pair of cold, merciless eyes shone through, a gaze that seemed capable of freezing souls and drowning will. The Eternal Night and Submergence Authority he wielded exuded a chilling, heart-palpitating aura of decay.

The three main gods of Aetelia had gathered here, summoned by the Heavenly Dao to face the invaders head-on.

At that very moment, Xu Yunfan's voice, laced with mockery and coldness, drifted into the ears of Chiyang and Tongxuan.

"So you dare to chase me here?"

Before the words had fully faded, his aura had completely vanished into the Aetelia World, as if he had never been there at all.

"Junior!"

True Lord Chiyang roared in fury, and the Fenji Sword hummed, eager to strike. However...

The suppression of this world's Heavenly Dao descended!

Although Aetelia's plane level was not as high as the Taihua Lingxu World, it had still nurtured three Dao Fruits, creating three main gods. Thus, it was still capable of suppressing the two True Lords, who were only at the initial Golden Core stage.

An invisible net of laws tightened instantly. True Lord Chiyang was horrified to find that the free-floating energy in his surroundings had become incredibly viscous, as if he were trapped in a swamp, and it was becoming extremely difficult and obscure to manipulate his spiritual sense.

The blazing flames on the Fenji Sword suddenly dimmed, showing signs of exhaustion.

Simultaneously, an extremely awkward sensation lingered in his heart, as if he might trip over an unseen stone at any moment while walking, and his spiritual sense probes were being inexplicably twisted and disrupted. It was a sign of misfortune缠身 (chán shēn - clinging misfortune).

True Lord Tongxuan's expression also changed drastically. His intangible sword spirit, controlled by his spiritual sense, felt as if it had been灌入 (guàn rù - poured into) heavy mercury, its movements becoming incredibly sluggish. The ripples stirred when cutting through space were violent, and his consumption increased several times over.

A sudden wave of frustration rushed into his soul, causing an untimely distracting thought to arise in this life-and-death moment.

This was the手段 (shǒuduàn - method/tactic) of the Aetelia Heavenly Dao.

To prohibit external forces and invoke misfortune.

"Outland fiends, you deserve to be slain!"

Lord Orion, the Lord of the Firmament, struck first. He pressed his hands down, and the entire sky seemed to transform into a heavy lead block, crashing down with immense force.

An infinite atmospheric pressure instantly twisted space, forming a terrifying force field visible to the naked eye. Accompanied by the piercing howl of fierce winds, it hammered toward the two of them like millions of invisible heavy hammers.

Within the force field, life and decay cycled endlessly, attempting to erode the very origin of their Dao bodies directly.

"The sin of defiling Light demands the tempering of your souls by divine fire!"

The God of Light, Orion, condensed a spear formed purely of holy light in his hand. The tip of the spear erupted with a point of ultimate brilliance, instantly transforming into a pillar of destructive light capable of burning all things to ash. Carrying an overbearing will to purify all creation, it tore through space and shot directly at True Lord Chiyang.

Where the spear of light passed, space was left with scorched black trails.

"Submerge... decay in eternal silence..."

The God of Darkness, Ymir, vanished from his original position like a phantom, reappearing right beside True Lord Tongxuan.

His form seemed to be composed of pure darkness. Wherever he passed, light was extinguished. A giant claw, covered in deep, icy crystals, reached out silently. The tips of the claws were entwined with the chilling寒息 (hánxī - cold breath) of eternal night, capable of freezing souls and corroding the foundation of the Dao, and it clawed directly at True Lord Tongxuan's back.

The attack was insidious, fatal, and cunningly angled.

The three main gods unleashed their full power from the very first strike. Relying on the加持 (jiāchí - blessing/boost) of their native Heavenly Dao, their Authorities were amplified to the extreme.

The entire space trembled violently from the collision of such terrifying forces.

"Scorching Flames of Departing Light, Burn the Sky and Boil the Sea!"

Although suppressed by the Heavenly Dao, True Lord Chiyang's ferocity was completely ignited.

He knew well that if he didn't fight with his life on the line now, he probably wouldn't be able to escape at all.

True Lord Chiyang roared, his Scorching Flames of Departing Light Dao Fruit operating frantically, forcibly squeezing energy from the viscous space. Furthermore, a torrent of immense magical power surged forth from his personal grotto-heaven.

After attaining a Dao Fruit, a grotto-heaven formed its own cycle, its magical power endless, capable of forming a small world without relying on the outside.

The Fenji Sword let out a heaven-shaking sword cry, its crimson blade instantly becoming as scorching and translucent as molten lava.

With a single slash, it was no longer mere flame, but a raging tsunami of lava.

The scarlet high-temperature magma, carrying the sword intent to burn all things to ash, surged upward and violently crashed into the crushing sky of Lord Orion and the judgment spear of the God of Light.

*BOOM RUMBLE!!!*

The lava tsunami and the gravity field, the spear of holy light, collided violently. The terrifying explosion tore countless black fissures into space.

True Lord Chiyang's Dao robes fluttered wildly, his hair and beard bristling. Each swing of the Fenji Sword brought forth a sea of fire, forcefully holding open a domain amidst the combined assault of the two main gods.

But the Heavenly Dao suppression followed him like a shadow. Each time he drew energy, it was exceptionally difficult. The very heavens and earth were suppressing him, making the manipulation of his magical power slightly sluggish.

The ferocity of the Fenji Sword was also subtly weakened by the laws of the Heavenly Dao; even stray bits of lava were purified by holy light or scattered by the fierce winds.

What was even more vexing was that a wave of holy light he should have perfectly dodged inexplicably twisted and delayed the space beneath his feet, causing him to be half a step too slow. It grazed his left shoulder, leaving a patch of scorched flesh.

On the other side, True Lord Tongxuan faced Ymir's sinister claw strike, his eyes as cold as ten-thousand-year-old ice.

"Xuan Shu Return to the Void, Sword Spirit Cuts the虚 (Xū - Void/Emptiness)."

The power of his Tianji Xuan Shu Sword Spirit Dao Fruit erupted. Nine intangible sword spirits instantly coalesced, forming an almost transparent, twisted greatsword. Where the sword's edge pointed, space was easily sliced open like thin paper.

He did not choose to clash head-on with the claw containing the power of Eternal Night and Submergence. Instead, he used a point to break a surface, his sword tip precisely striking the core node where the claw影's (yǐng - shadow/phantom) power flowed.

*Sssk!*

A piercing, sharp cry, as if ice crystals were striking an invisible divine iron.
