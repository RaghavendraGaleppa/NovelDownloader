# Chapter 54: Sudden Incident

The young man laughed. "Uncle Jin, stop setting such a gloomy atmosphere. There are so many mountain goods here in Beiye City, I can't wait any longer. If I could buy a Qinglian from Jiyun Mountain and ask the Old Ancestor to refine it into a great medicine, I might be able to break through my shackles and reach the Great Completion of Muscle Tempering."

Uncle Jin was speechless for a moment, then smiled. "If that really happens, becoming a Muscle Tempering Warrior before twenty-five means you have a good chance of reaching the Three External Unions by forty."

"More than just the Three External Unions, my goal is to become a Blood Transformation expert. Then, I'll have a name for myself in the Jianghu!"

Watching the young man's confident expression, Uncle Jin wanted to say something, but in the end, he just patted the young man's shoulder.

"Fengzi, having ideals is good, but the most important thing in life is to be down-to-earth. We need to take one step at a time, don't be too ambitious. The ancients said, 'A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step...'"

Fengzi heard Uncle Jin starting to nag again and quickly waved his hand. "Uncle Jin, I'll go check if the team left anything behind. I'm heading off first."

Watching Fengzi leave as if escaping, Uncle Jin shook his head helplessly.

He turned his head and saw a small, delicate face peeking out from behind the carriage curtain, curiously observing everything.

He said, "Miss Chi, the city gates are already closed. We'll have to wait until dawn for them to open."

Miss Chi nodded, her voice soft. "Uncle Jin, just make the arrangements."

Uncle Jin nodded. "There happens to be a deadwood forest next to the city gate. It's sheltered from the wind. We can set up a simple barrier to block the wind if we arrange it a bit. How about we go there?"

Miss Chi nodded slightly. "Then let's go."

She paused, then added, seemingly worried, "Uncle Jin, this batch of goods is for business with the Wu Family Fort. We must take good care of it."

Uncle Jin smiled. "Don't worry, Miss. There won't be a single slip-up."

With Miss Chi's approval, Uncle Jin began to direct the team to make camp in the nearby deadwood forest, setting up stoves to cook a hearty meal before entering the city for resupply.

Fengzi's steps were light, each stride covering a great distance. His movements were agile as he jumped back and forth, busy directing the pushing of goods into the deadwood forest.

They arrived at the foot of Beiye City late at night. The city gates were already closed, and they could only enter the next morning.

Xu Yunfan didn't mind. He casually found a spot in the deadwood forest, a sheltered area, to make do. He took off his black clothes and tore them into shreds.

Just as he was about to find some firewood to burn them, his footsteps suddenly froze. The relaxed muscles in his body tensed instantly, and the great sinews inside felt like bowstrings pulled taut to a full moon.

His gaze sharpened instantly, looking coldly at the thin, young man in grey tight-fitting clothes in front of him.

Fengzi's back broke out in a cold sweat, soaking his clothes in an instant.

Although Xu Yunfan hadn't made any movement, his presence was like a crouching tiger, its four limbs filled with strength, waiting for the right moment to unleash earth-shattering power.

The aura coming from the opponent made his heart pound wildly, not daring to make the slightest move.

Fengzi could guarantee that if he made any move, the opponent would burst forth with terrifying speed, reaching him in an instant.

No, there was no way to escape!

He constantly revised his escape routes in his mind, only to find in despair that no matter what he did, the opponent could catch up and kill him on the spot.

Most importantly, it seemed he had stumbled upon something that shouldn't be seen.

The opponent was destroying something that couldn't be seen by others.

If it shouldn't be seen, and he has seen it, what then?

He forced a smile onto his face.

"T-this brother, we are also here to prepare for the night, planning to gather firewood. I didn't expect to find a fellow traveler in this snowstorm. Well, the Northern Border is truly freezing. Although the snow is deep, the dead branches aren't damp at all. I've often heard people from all over say that in winter, if you're not careful, you can easily start a mountain fire..."

As he spoke, Fengzi slowly moved his feet backward, trying to distance himself.

"Take one more step."

Xu Yunfan said.

Fengzi's whole body tightened. He naturally knew what Xu Yunfan meant. If he dared to move back any further, the opponent wouldn't let him off.

He would strike, and it would be a fatal blow.

He couldn't help but look at the long, rod-like object wrapped in black cloth behind Xu Yunfan.

A heavy weapon. Based on his years of experience traveling the land, it was most likely a heavy weapon like a long-handled heavy hammer. If it was forged from fine steel all over, its weight would probably be over two hundred pounds.

To use a weapon like this, which he would be afraid of hurting himself just by lifting, one must either be a fool or an incredibly fierce person.

Obviously, the person before him was the latter.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a bit helpless. He really didn't expect that the opponent specialized in light footwork, landing without a sound, and could get within thirty meters of him without making any noise.

If he had been alone destroying the items, or even started a fire, and the opponent had seen him, Xu Yunfan wouldn't have cared.

But of all things, the opponent saw him tearing up his black clothes.

The black market thirty miles west of Beiye City was bustling tonight. The peddlers selling fake manuals had teamed up to set a trap, but he turned the tables and killed them. This was sure to cause quite a stir.

If someone with ill intentions investigated...

"Troublesome."

Hearing Xu Yunfan mutter to himself, Fengzi didn't catch it clearly and couldn't help but ask subconsciously.

"What did you say?"

"I said..."

*Boom!*

A large patch of snow exploded, scattering into the air.

Fengzi's pupils shrank. Before he could react, the fierce man before him was like a sudden storm, bringing with it a sharp whistling sound, and charged at him with a fierce and brutal demeanor.

"Troublesome!"

The two words entered his ears, accompanied by a large hand reaching out, instantly covering his face.

So fast!

Under the straight-line burst, the opponent's speed and instantaneous explosive power were simply unbelievable.

Only then did Fengzi react.

His face changed drastically, his hands forming a shape like a bird's beak.

"Falcon!"

Fengzi roared, the vital energy and blood in his body instantly boiling like water. The rising heat scalded his body's moisture into steaming white vapor that seeped out from his pores.

His arms stretched out, the great sinews in his arms snapping.

*Hiss! Hiss hiss!*

Fengzi's fists flew out at an astonishing frequency. In the end, every punch tore through the air, emitting a sharp howl, continuously striking Xu Yunfan's body.

Such a high-frequency attack speed brought with it terrifying destructive power, enough to turn a person's flesh into pulp.

What made him despair was that this was the most ferocious attack of his life, yet the opponent seemed completely unaffected.

Too weak!

Xu Yunfan sighed. The opponent's attack speed was good, but each blow was like rain beating against a rock, unable to stir even a single ripple.

In the next instant, Xu Yunfan's muscles bulged like steel.

"Ah!!!"

As his next punch landed on Xu Yunfan, Fengzi felt an excruciating pain in his fingers. He retracted his arm and looked at his hand. Four of his five fingers were broken, one of them even showing the bone.
