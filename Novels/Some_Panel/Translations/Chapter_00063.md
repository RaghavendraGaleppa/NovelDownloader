## Chapter 63: The Five Heaven-Shaking Styles

“Junior Brother Mankui is actually at a disadvantage? How strong is this person's Sword Dao?”

Everyone was astonished, looking at the calm-faced Yang Ji, then at Mankui, whose breathing was slightly ragged. They were secretly shocked. In battles of the same realm, Mankui's strength had never feared anyone. Now, with the Abyssal Heavy Axe in hand, even under his Heaven-Shattering Style, he was actually suppressed. Moreover, the opponent was a Middle Stage Foundation Establishment cultivator counterattacking a Peak Foundation Establishment cultivator. This was incredibly unbelievable.

“This person's sword qi is so sharp, and his Sword Intent is so potent!” Mankui gazed at Yang Ji, outwardly composed, but internally, he was truly shaken. Losing the first move made his face burn with embarrassment.

He appeared crude but was surprisingly meticulous in thought. Suppressing his anger, he suddenly burst into laughter. “Hahahaha, I forgot about an old injury on my arm from a few days ago when I went to the Fiend-Scented Sea to slay a peak demon general. You're quite strong, kid, to actually take one of my moves. Now, I'm going to get serious!”

Mankui's smile vanished. He gripped his heavy axe tightly, leaping into the air with a furious glint in his eyes, hovering above Yang Ji's head. He roared, “Overhead Press Style!”

Vast azure spiritual energy surged madly into the heavy axe, unleashing an unparalleled axe radiance. With immense might, he swung it down fiercely. A sharp whistling cut through the air, and the attack locked onto an area eight zhang in radius, leaving no escape. Cracking sounds continuously echoed from the ground, and the spot where Yang Ji stood abruptly collapsed, stirring up endless dust.

Facing this powerful axe, Yang Ji remained unmoving, seemingly unaffected. He looked up. His robes fluttered in the wind. He made no moves, simply watching the azure heavy axe descend.

Just as the heavy axe closed within three zhang above his head, a sharp Sword Intent rapidly emanated from within him. *Clack, clack, clack!* All the swirling dust motes instantly hovered in the air, trembling softly. Soon, they converged into countless tiny flying swords, circling and whistling around his body.

Suddenly, with a point of his sword, all the dust-swords shot out, meeting Mankui's descending heavy axe. This seemingly light move, like a strong gust of wind, stirred up endless ripples in the air, as if space itself was folding and pressing upwards. The single sword strike contained boundless sharp sword qi and immense power. This was because this sword was precisely the Xun Sword Dao, gentle yet containing infinite ferocity, with roaring gales that could shatter anything.

Mankui clearly had a counter, for his descending axe clashed evenly with Yang Ji's move, which utilized fifty percent of Xun Wind Sword Intent. Both men retreated a step.

Yang Ji had only used fifty percent of his Sword Intent for this strike. This wasn't a life-and-death struggle; he only needed to use his "Golden Finger" to discern the opponent's move strength and react accordingly. He couldn't show too much of his hand, as it wouldn't benefit him, but rather harm him.

Because at this moment, above Granny Tianshang's head, the following words had appeared: [Astonished], [Fifty Percent Sword Intent], [Gloomy], [This kid's comprehension is quite outstanding. At such a young age, he has successively used Zhen Sword Dao containing thirty percent Sword Intent and Xun Sword Dao with fifty percent Sword Intent], [The Canglan Sect has another talented young genius with good comprehension], [Displeased], [Hostility!].

Just revealing fifty percent of his Sword Intent had already provoked Granny Tianshang's displeasure and hostility. If he revealed more than one hundred percent, she might literally devour him, Yang Ji secretly shook his head.

After these two exchanges, he had roughly gauged Mankui's strength. Although the opponent was at Peak Foundation Establishment, the disparity in their techniques was too great. One was a Grand Supernatural Technique, while the other was merely a top-tier technique. He could contend with Mankui by merely employing fifty percent of his Sword Intent. If this were a life-and-death battle with no one else present, he would certainly fuse all four Sword Intents and cleave Mankui in one strike.

This exchange boosted his confidence greatly. A Grand Supernatural Technique was indeed extraordinary, enough for him to fight across minor stages against the outstanding genius disciples of the three major sects. This was simply an asymmetric battle.

From this, he couldn't help but think about the fierce competition within the Dao Sect. There were countless geniuses there, whose comprehension and root bones were exceptional, whose cultivation was higher than his, and whose techniques might not be inferior to his. Facing them with such ease would probably be very difficult.

As he pondered, Mankui leaped up again, separating his hands. The giant axe automatically flew to his head, spinning rapidly. All around him, countless air currents began to converge, enveloping him. As the air currents gathered, the entire space formed a specific spatial energy field, isolating him from the outside world. Mankui's body burst forth with azure light. The giant axe, radiating strong azure light, spun incessantly above his head. With each rotation, the surrounding air currents intensified, and the azure light grew even more dazzling.

Powerful air currents and countless axe glows, carrying destructive force capable of tearing everything apart, converged from all four directions towards the center, aiming directly at Yang Ji. A colossal axe shadow, shaped like a mountain, thunderously formed.

“Mountain Embrace Style!” Mankui roared, bringing the axe down.

Yang Ji's eyes read: [This move is quite powerful. It can only be defended by using sixty percent Sword Intent or a fusion of two thirty percent Sword Intents.]

He immediately unleashed a fusion of thirty percent Zhen Sword Intent and thirty percent Xun Wind Sword Intent in one strike.

*Boom!*

With another loud crash, Yang Ji and Mankui both retreated once more. Just as Yang Ji found his footing, Mankui reappeared before him, his axe spinning. The heavy axe swung, countless axe shadows manifesting and overlapping in the air. The rapidly shaking heavy axe agitated the surrounding air currents, creating an unusually ear-piercing shriek that vibrated the soul.

“You can't escape this axe!”

As Yang Ji flew backward, Mankui rapidly closed in, his axe cutting horizontally as if it would cleave the heavens and earth. Azure light erupted, and crisscrossing axe glows filled the sky, tearing through space and earth. Accompanied by the soul-shaking shriek and formidable power, they instantly engulfed Yang Ji.

“The Five Heaven-Shaking Styles!”

These three awe-inspiring words suddenly roared from Mankui's mouth. He had skipped the "Earth-Covering Style" and "Heaven-Shaking Style" and unleashed a fusion of all five styles in one move. His body suddenly split into five, and five Mankuis simultaneously appeared around him. One was above, and four stood in the four cardinal directions, enveloping Yang Ji in a beautiful yet incredibly dangerous halo of light.

Mankui's heavy axes shrieked, shaking the heavens. Countless axe shadows chopped horizontally and vertically, and five formidable axe radiances emerged from the five directions. From the outside, it appeared that five Mankuis were attacking simultaneously, their five potent axe shadows merging into one continuous sheet, forming a sealed space.

Watching the five Mankuis attack simultaneously, Yang Ji already felt the surrounding air currents forming a closed space, firmly locking him in the center. [A fused move of the Five Heaven-Shaking Styles. Can be broken by a single eighty percent Sword Intent or a sword strike fusing two forty percent Sword Intents.]

Yang Ji looked at the fierce offensive. The flying sword in his hand burst with brilliant light, as forty percent Zhen Sword Intent and forty percent Xun Wind Sword Intent explosively fused. Both Sword Daos excelled in speed, and in that instant, he unleashed dozens of sword qi strikes, cleaving towards Mankui.
