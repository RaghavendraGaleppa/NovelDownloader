# Chapter 11: Family Development Plan

After storing the spirit stones in his storage pouch, Chen Daoxuan and Chen Xianhe exited the secret chamber.

In the reception hall of the cave abode, the uncle and nephew sat facing each other. A tea set was arranged on the table between them as Chen Xianhe prepared tea for Chen Daoxuan.

The clear tea flowed from the spout into the cup, releasing a rich aroma. Just smelling it made Chen Daoxuan feel his spiritual sense becoming more active—this was clearly no ordinary tea but a spiritual variety.

Noticing Chen Daoxuan's eager expression, Chen Xianhe smiled and handed him the cup. "Try it. This Mind-Nourishing Tea is one of the few good things your thirteenth uncle possesses."

"Then this nephew will gratefully accept," Chen Daoxuan replied, taking the cup and gulping it down like a cow chewing peonies before smacking his lips.

"Well?" Chen Xianhe asked while sipping his own tea.

"Fragrant!" Seeing his uncle's glare, Chen Daoxuan quickly added sheepishly, "It feels like my spiritual sense is soaking in warm water—very comfortable."

"Exactly right. Mind-Nourishing Tea greatly benefits a cultivator's spiritual sense. Regular consumption can enhance it." Chen Xianhe chuckled self-deprecatingly. "Mortals think we cultivators live ascetic lives, fasting and consuming only qi. Little do they know we do eat—we're just too poor to afford it." He glanced at the teapot. "This small pot of tea costs fifty spirit stones."

"Pfft—" Chen Daoxuan choked on his second cup. "Fifty spirit stones? That's outrageous!"

"Indeed," Chen Xianhe continued calmly. "Not just tea—cultivators from major families regularly consume spirit rice. You should know that long-term consumption of spirit rice nourishes the physical body. Here in Guang'an Prefecture, even the lowest-grade Jade Crystal Rice costs five spirit stones per hundred jin. How could ordinary cultivators afford to eat it regularly? That's not even mentioning spirit pills, fruits, wines, and other rare treasures that aid cultivation—all requiring spirit stones!"

Chen Daoxuan fell silent. He understood his uncle was emphasizing the importance of nurturing a spirit vein first once they had sufficient funds, as it would allow them to gradually obtain all these cultivation resources.

"Uncle, I understand. Once the refining workshop is operational and generating profit, my first priority will be developing the spirit vein," Chen Daoxuan vowed solemnly.

Satisfied with his attitude, Chen Xianhe changed topics. "Daoxuan, what are your thoughts on the family's future development?"

This was the first time Chen Xianhe had actively discussed family planning with him. Previously, the elder had shielded Chen Daoxuan from such matters, insisting his sole focus should be mastering artifact refinement. Now that Chen Daoxuan had become a first-grade refiner, the aging Chen Xianhe needed to groom a successor.

Recognizing this as a test, Chen Daoxuan organized his thoughts. "Patriarch, I believe our immediate priority is establishing the refining workshop. This requires three preparatory steps."

"Which are?"

"First, investigate the artifact market in Guang'an Prefecture. Second, procure materials for building the workshop and crafting artifacts. Third, lease a shop in Guang'an to sell our products."

As Chen Daoxuan elaborated his years of consideration about family development, Chen Xianhe alternated between applauding his insights and offering corrections. Through their discussion, a rough five-year development plan gradually took shape—centered around the refining workshop, with Chen Daoxuan as its key executor since he alone could craft artifacts, including their unique Spirit-Melting Furnace.

Unnoticed, the teapot had emptied. Chen Daoxuan shook it disappointedly before setting it down, privately vowing to bathe in Mind-Nourishing Tea once the family prospered.

"Very well," Chen Xianhe concluded. "I'll announce this plan officially at tomorrow's clan assembly using my authority as patriarch."

Noticing Chen Daoxuan's hesitation, he paused. "Something else?"

"Patriarch," Chen Daoxuan said earnestly, "while developing the workshop, we must also cultivate our younger generation. The Chen family can't forever rely solely on us two."

He understood Chen Xianhe's singular focus on accumulating 100,000 spirit stones to awaken the spirit vein, but believed nurturing talents and developing the vein weren't mutually exclusive—provided the workshop generated sufficient profit. Otherwise, both goals would remain pipe dreams.

Chen Xianhe pondered before shaking his head. "We'll table this for now. But I promise once workshop profits reach a certain threshold, we'll implement both plans simultaneously—with spirit vein development taking precedence."

"Agreed!" Chen Daoxuan nodded, then hesitated. "But..."

"But what?" Chen Xianhe glared, realizing his nephew's usual deference masked a mind teeming with ideas.

"Well..." Chen Daoxuan scratched his head. "You should specify exactly how much profit qualifies as 'sufficient.'"

Chen Xianhe snorted. "Since you're so insistent—if annual net profits exceed three thousand spirit stones, I'll approve your proposal."

Delighted, Chen Daoxuan jumped up. "Deal! Let's seal it with a handshake!"

"Get out! I'll box your ears!" Chen Xianhe feigned anger, raising a hand threateningly.

Laughing, Chen Daoxuan dashed from the cave in a flash. Watching his retreating figure, the elder's stern expression melted into a smile.

"That rascal... ha!"
