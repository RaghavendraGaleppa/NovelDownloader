# Chapter 295: Stunning the Crowd

The disciples from the thirty-six peaks below wore varied expressions, with dread visible in many of their eyes.

"To possess such combat prowess even after just entering the Marrow Cleansing Realm... No wonder the Sect Master made an exception to accept him as a disciple."

"That heavy mace is a divine weapon, and he's wearing divine armor as well! How can anyone fight against that!"

Some whispered among themselves, while more secretly calculated that if this winning streak continued, the qualification for the Sword Burial Abyss might truly fall into Xu Yunfan's hands.

But if they stepped onto the stage now, they might not gain any advantage...

The opponent's strength was genuine; he could easily contend with the disciples from the top peaks of the Dao Sect. Those from the subsequent peaks would likely just be sending themselves to their deaths.

After all, the final qualification to enter the Sword Burial Abyss only required one to be the last person standing on the arena. The later one went up, the greater their chance of victory.

On the high platform, the heads of the twelve peaks who had arrived wore different expressions.

Li Zhi's knuckles tapped against his wooden sword, the cracks on the scabbard deepening by another three points. He sneered, "This kid from the Tiangong Cave has some strength."

Chu Cangmeng still stood with his sword hugged against his chest, but his eyes were already open. His gaze was like a cold pool reflecting snow, mirroring the figure holding the mace on the arena.

Bi Yuan had a smile at the corner of his mouth, his fingertips gently stroking his teacup. The jade-colored liquid within rippled slightly without any wind.

Cui Yu's withered palm pressed down on the Zhenyue Stone. In a hoarse voice, he said, "On the third arena, continue. If the time limit is reached and no one challenges him, we will announce Xu Yunfan's victory."

"Qingming Peak's Chen Xuan, here to ask for guidance from Senior Brother Xu!"

A disciple carrying an ancient bronze sword could no longer hold back. He leaped onto the stage. Before the sword was even drawn, green sword qi already swirled around him.

Sword qi?!

Xu Yunfan was slightly surprised. This was the first time he had seen someone transform sword intent into sword qi. It seemed they were also following the path of the Tian Shu Gate, finding ways to nurture a sword body and accumulating a wisp of sword qi within their body through secret martial arts methods.

However, the Dao Sect's methods appeared to be more sophisticated. All of Chen Xuan's sword qi was gathered on that ancient bronze sword, so he didn't have to endure the wear and tear of true qi himself.

It seemed he had to take this seriously.

The sword qi looked sharp, and its寒芒 flickered with a certain imposing aura. But in Xu Yunfan's eyes, it was like thin paper meeting an iron rod—only possessing form, and不堪一击 (unable to withstand a single blow)!

The Pure Yang One Qi Technique within him had long since reached perfection. At this moment, with a thought, the pure yang true qi, which was as condensed as mercury at the intersection of flesh and blood in his Dantian, suddenly surged. It flowed through his flesh, skin, and hair and into the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace.

The dark red patterns on the mace instantly lit up, and a scorching golden light flowed like molten lava. The surrounding air was twisted and evaporated by the heat.

The mace swept out, and the pure yang true qi exploded like a furnace. The golden light pierced through the air, actually tearing a blazing trail through the snow curtain.

Wherever the mace wind passed, the strong winds on the arena roared like thunder, and the rising heat waves instantly vaporized the falling snowflakes, turning them into billowing white mist!

"Sss!"

The sword qi was like snow meeting the scorching sun, melting away in an instant!

Xu Yunfan's scarlet mace swept through the air, the pure yang true qi exploding like a furnace. Within three moves, he shattered the opponent's sword qi. The heavy mace hung in the air and blasted Chen Xuan and his sword off the arena.

"Fourth arena, Xu Yunfan's victory."

"..."

Hearing Cui Yu's emotionless announcement of the result, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but grind his teeth.

On the high platform, Li Zhi's pupils constricted sharply.

As a ninth-level Qi Refining Grandmaster, he could see the essence of Xu Yunfan's attack at a glance. His heart was greatly shaken: "The Pure Yang One Qi Technique is perfected? And he has even condensed Pure Yang True Qi?!"

要知道 (He knew that), even among the true disciples of the Dao Sect, there were very few who could cultivate the Pure Yang One Qi Technique to great success, let alone reach perfection and condense Pure Yang True Qi, a qualitative transformation.

And how long had Xu Yunfan been practicing? It had only been a little over two years since he received the Pure Yang One Qi Technique from Bi Sheng, yet he had already quietly reached this realm!

Li Zhi's gaze was deep, and his fingertips unconsciously stroked his teacup.

The spiritual tea in the cup had long gone cold, but it reflected the sharp light flickering in his eyes. This boy's talent was恐怕 (probably) even more astonishing than he had estimated!

"Pure Yang True Qi is released externally... Although it's only a few wisps, it has already reached the stage of 'mercury slurry condensing into form'?"

He was secretly shocked. His fingers subconsciously pressed down on the armrest of his chair, making it creak and groan. He finally came back to his senses.

Bi Yuan on the side was both shocked and delighted. He had truly found a treasure!

Li Zhi's stern face twitched slightly.

He had practiced the sword his entire life and naturally saw the terrifying aspect of Xu Yunfan's mace strike. He had thought it was the power unleashed by the divine weapon, the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace. Now, seeing the golden light traverse the sky, he realized that the other party had actually condensed a mouthful of Pure Yang True Qi!

Li Zhi couldn't help but glance at Bi Yuan, who had a calm expression, lowered eyelids, and no emotion on his face.

This old fox, no wonder he went against all objections to accept him as a disciple.

His knuckles turned white, and his sword intent uncontrollably diffused, actually condensing three inches of frost around him. He was clearly a bit out of sorts. After realizing it, he quickly retracted his aura and remained silent.

Chu Cangmeng still stood with his sword hugged against his chest, but his eyes were already open, staring fixedly at Xu Yunfan on the arena. His eyes had unknowingly become somewhat bloodshot.

"Wushuang Peak's Wu Shuang, please grant me your guidance!"

The black-robed disciple sent nine specially made玄冰刺 (ice thorns) flying from his sleeves. Wherever they passed, frost formed three feet deep.

However, Xu Yunfan left no footprints in the snow. His scarlet mace spun around him like a fire dragon, the scorching gang wind vaporizing all the ice. He backhandedly struck Wu Shuang's shoulder with his mace, the sound of bone cracking was clear and audible.

"Fifth arena, Xu Yunfan's victory."

Five consecutive battles, five consecutive victories!

And he won with ease and joy, extremely cleanly, without even a strenuous entanglement.

The disciples on the stage finally stirred.

"Senior Brother Wu, who is about to reach the great success of the Marrow Cleansing Realm, couldn't even take three moves?!"

"That mace technique... is clearly the 'Eight Wastes Dragon Fall Mace' from the ninth floor of the Langhuan Book Tower!"

A deathly silence fell.

Most of the thirty-six peak disciples looked at each other, and not a single person dared to step onto the stage.

Xu Yunfan had successively defeated several Marrow Cleansing Realm experts like Zhao Wujiu and Zhou Ziling. The锋芒 (edge) of the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace was fully displayed, and the Pure Yang True Qi he revealed was even more domineering and unmatched, shocking everyone's hearts.

The disciples of the Dao Sect naturally understood that after the Pure Yang One Qi Technique was cultivated to perfection, one could condense Pure Yang True Qi.

But the Pure Yang One Qi Technique became more difficult to practice the further one went.除了 (Except for) the current Sect Master Bi Yuan, who had achieved it in his youth, not a single disciple of this generation had done so.

Now, standing on the arena, his momentum was like a rainbow, actually intimidating everyone into hesitating for a moment.

"What, the mighty thirty-six peaks of the Dao Sect, have no one willing to fight?"

Xu Yunfan's voice was calm as he surveyed his surroundings, but it carried an无形的压迫感 (invisible sense of pressure).

He was getting impatient. If they fought for a while and then paused for a while, it might not end until late at night.

Finally, a disciple from Qingming Peak could no longer hold back. He turned his head to look at the white-robed man standing behind him with his hands behind his back and whispered, "Senior Brother Lu, you have already reached the Viscera Refining Realm. If you make a move, you will surely挫其锋芒 (break his momentum)! Senior Brother Chen Xuan mostly immerses himself in martial arts research and lacks combat experience. He probably came up this time just to test his sword. You..."

The white-robed man was the true disciple of Qingming Peak, Lu Wuchen. He had already reached the early stage of the Viscera Refining Realm. His aura was restrained, but a sharp sword intent faintly透出 (emanated).

Upon hearing this, he smiled faintly, his gaze still fixed on the distance, as if appreciating the flying snow. He said leisurely, "It's not the right time yet."
