# Chapter 234: Dipei Mountain

"Senior Brother, why today—"

Inside the palace.

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged, his gaze unconsciously falling upon Feng Wuyu, a look of hesitation on his face.

After the True Disciple Grand Assembly concluded, he and Feng Wuyu had gone directly to his Immortal Isle. On one hand, it was for old times' sake. On the other, Zhang Jing had many questions in his heart that he wished to ask his senior.

Across from him, Feng Wuyu seemed to have anticipated this, a faint smile flashing across his face. "Junior Brother, are you wondering why, despite Senior Sister Kong clearly promising to give you every bit of the luck you were due, I still pressed to secure the administrative rights to the Secret Realm for you, even against pressure?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

Feng Wuyu pondered for a moment, then sighed, patiently explaining, "Junior Brother, let me put it this way. Once one possesses the administrative rights to a Secret Realm, it means we gain priority access to various heavenly materials and earthly treasures, as well as other rare resources nurtured within that Secret Realm. This even includes Primordial Divine Objects. Even if we don't need them ourselves, we can exchange them among our many fellow disciples in the Nine Regions Lineage. Compared to Primordial Divine Objects, what's a mere bit of luck?"

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing instantly understood. "Primordial Divine Objects! So that's how it is." No wonder his senior brothers and sisters had such ambiguous attitudes when Senior Brother Feng Wuyu fought for the administrative rights to the Mirror Realm for him during the True Disciple Grand Assembly. There was this crucial underlying interest at play.

The number of Secret Realms under the jurisdiction of the Crimson Bright Grand Clear Grotto-Heaven was ultimately limited. If he were to participate in the allocation of Secret Realm administrative rights, it would mean that the number of Secret Realms controlled by those senior brothers and sisters would decrease, and the resources they would acquire in the future would naturally plummet. Don't forget, behind each of these True Disciples was a Dao Abode, intricate and complex forces intertwined. Since it concerned their own interests, it was no surprise that they would take advantage of Senior Sister Kong's initiative to push their own agenda.

Then, a look of confusion appeared on Zhang Jing's face: "Senior Brother, what about Master's side...?"

"Master's meaning is simple: everything depends on one's own capability." Feng Wuyu smiled, then continued, "In His Elder's eyes, our competitions are merely children playing house. How could an adult personally step in for a children's dispute?" As he spoke, a hint of expectation entered his gaze as he looked at Zhang Jing. "Junior Brother, cultivate to the Dao Unification Realm as quickly as possible. Only when you reach this stage can you truly take hold of the resources and authority that a True Disciple should possess. Instead of merely watching helplessly, as you are now."

"Though I wish to help, Junior Brother, as you've seen, I'm truly a lone tree, hard to support!"

"Junior Brother understands." Zhang Jing nodded emphatically. This True Disciple Grand Assembly had deeply impacted him. Though everyone was usually polite, and even sent congratulatory gifts after he officially became a True Disciple, in a situation where vital personal interests were at stake, no one would yield even half a step. At such times, the disadvantage of insufficient cultivation became glaringly obvious.

*Whoosh*

Zhang Jing let out a light breath of turbid air. Then, as if realizing something, he quickly looked at his Senior Brother again and tentatively asked, "Senior Brother, there's something I'd like to ask you about."

"Junior Brother, feel free to speak," Feng Wuyu said with a smile.

"May I ask Senior Brother if you know of any Senior Brothers in the Daoist Sect who are skilled in the art of magic treasure forging? And could you introduce me to them?"

"Magic treasure forging?" Feng Wuyu let out a soft sound of surprise, then looked at Zhang Jing as if he understood something. "Junior Brother, you wish to forge that piece of Primordial Blood Gold Essence into a magic treasure? But Junior Brother, this Primordial Blood Gold Essence is incredibly precious. Isn't it a bit hasty to forge it into a magic treasure now?"

"Senior Brother, I just want to ask someone to forge it into a magic saber spirit embryo first, without adding any Dao Restraints," Zhang Jing chuckled, then explained.

Upon hearing this, Feng Wuyu suddenly reacted, exclaiming in surprise, "Is it that Divine Lord's legacy?"

Zhang Jing smiled and nodded.

"Senior Brother understands, but that Primordial Blood Gold Essence is, after all, a Primordial Divine Object. Ordinary cultivators truly can't do anything to it." Feng Wuyu's eyes flashed with a thoughtful expression. Not long after, his gaze shifted. "Junior Brother, the most suitable person I can think of is Lou Buyi from the Nine Luminaries Blazing Fire Grotto-Heaven. This person, like me, is a Daoist Sect Sequence True Disciple, ranked tenth, and cultivates the Great Dao of Blazing Fire. However—"

"However what?" Zhang Jing's eyes brightened.

Meeting his Junior Brother's eager gaze, Feng Wuyu said with some difficulty, "That fellow Lou Buyi is a scoundrel; he's usually very arrogant. Ordinary prices won't move him, so Junior Brother, be prepared. As for an introduction, if Junior Brother doesn't have anything urgent, I can take you there now. His Dao Abode happens to be in the Eastern Extremity Immortal Continent."

"Then I'll trouble Senior Brother."

Zhang Jing calculated the time. There was still more than a month until the date of the Dao lecture, so there was still time to go and see.

"You're too kind, Junior Brother."

...

Eastern Extremity Immortal Continent.

In the south, there was a majestic, crimson divine mountain, tens of thousands of feet tall. This mountain was called Dipei Mountain. It constantly spewed divine flames, making it extremely hot. Centered around Dipei Mountain, for hundreds of thousands of miles, no vegetation grew, and the yellow-brown earth was cracked everywhere. The closer one got to Dipei Mountain, the more exaggerated the scenery became. Only a few scattered mortal kingdoms and some fire-attributed demonic beast tribes struggled to survive there.

On this day, a brilliant bronze divine light suddenly streaked across the sky, breaking the tranquility of the place.

...

Dipei Mountain Dao Abode's Main Hall.

"Haha, Senior Brother had a feeling today that a distinguished guest would arrive, but I didn't expect it to be Junior Brother Feng. Please, have a seat." A tall man dressed in a red dragon dharma robe enthusiastically led Feng Wuyu and Zhang Jing to their seats, then turned and sat on the main seat, smiling. "Oh, by the way, who is this Junior Brother?" After greeting Feng Wuyu, he turned to Zhang Jing, his gaze carrying a hint of inquiry.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother Lou." Zhang Jing rose and cupped his hands, speaking politely.

"Senior Brother Lou, let me introduce you. This is Junior Brother Zhang Jing, a new personal disciple recently taken in by our Master." Feng Wuyu's voice sounded at the right time.

"Oh? So the Eight Desolate Bells that rang earlier were because of Junior Brother Zhang?" Lou Buyi's eyes flashed, then he said as if suddenly enlightened.

After a round of pleasantries, Lou Buyi's expression turned serious, and he went straight to the point. "Have the two Junior Brothers come this time because you have a magic treasure to forge?"

Below, Zhang Jing didn't hesitate for a moment, rising and saying, "To be frank with Senior Brother, I have come this time to ask for your help in forging a magic saber spirit embryo using Primordial Blood Gold Essence."

As his voice fell, Lou Buyi looked at Zhang Jing in surprise. "Primordial Blood Gold Essence?"

"Junior Brother Zhang, I assume Junior Brother Feng Wuyu told you about my rules before you came. This is a Primordial Divine Gold, and forging it requires a significant cost, so..." He stared at Zhang Jing with a half-smile, saying nothing more.

Seeing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but take a deep breath, forcing a smile, and said with some trepidation, "Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."

"That depends on what price Junior Brother can pay! If it's just a bit of luck, then Junior Brother should just go back." The other party said pointedly.

The hall suddenly fell silent.

For a long while.

"Senior Brother, you want... Primordial Blood Gold Essence?" Zhang Jing guessed.

As soon as his words fell, the other party's face immediately showed an expression of "this child can be taught."

Zhang Jing's heart sank abruptly. This guy really dared to open his mouth so wide, wasn't he afraid of bursting his stomach?

But at this moment, "Senior Brother Lou, you and I both know the preciousness of Primordial Blood Gold Essence. The price is a bit too high." Feng Wuyu, who was beside him, instantly stood up and said indignantly.

"Haha, two Junior Brothers, you also know that this Primordial Blood Gold Essence is extraordinary; it contains extremely terrifying karmic sin power within it. I would be undertaking a risk helping Junior Brother Zhang forge it. If something unexpected were to happen and the karmic sin power surged out and polluted the Primordial Fire Earth's Lung in my Dao Abode, that would be a real problem." Meeting Zhang Jing and Feng Wuyu's gazes, Lou Buyi explained with a normal expression.

"Senior Brother Lou, can't we negotiate further? Junior Brother can use Post-natal Violet Qi as remuneration for this forging." Zhang Jing was a bit unwilling.

"Haha, Junior Brother, please don't joke. How much Post-natal Violet Qi could you have? A trace, or a wisp? That's far from enough!" Lou Buyi laughed heartily and waved his hand.

However, to his surprise, "How much Post-natal Violet Qi does Senior Brother want? Just name it." Zhang Jing said in a deep voice, his voice full of confidence.
