Chapter 136: I'm Going to Hammer You All to Death!

Han Zhen, currently fighting Ying Bing, had a main body anchored by the bones of a Profound Realm expert. He was far stronger than his younger self.

However, he never imagined that the Blood Phoenix Essence he had painstakingly accumulated would be used by someone else.

Nor did he expect Ying Bing to be so terrifying.

Normally, if one’s cultivation base were suddenly raised by a major realm, they would be able to发挥 only thirty to forty percent of their true strength.

Yet Ying Bing... was stronger than any观神 (Viewing God) realm expert he had ever seen.

Including himself.

That was why he had asked Yin Huaxuan to join him in dealing with Ying Bing first.

That Li Mo was also surprisingly strong. With the Dragon Tiger Golden Pill, he possessed immense power, but he ultimately posed no real threat to him.

No matter how great one's strength, it wasn't enough to overpower all techniques.

Once he reclaimed the Blood Phoenix Essence, the situation would be settled.

"Ying Bing!"

"Given the situation, do you still intend to resist stubbornly?"

Yin Huaxuan's voice shook the clouds.

Within his domain, he seemed to command the wind and rain.

A gale surged, and behind him, distorted roars of beasts overlapped, exuding a bloodthirsty intent. A wild, violent power accumulated.

Eighth level of the Internal Landscape.

He truly possessed the power to change the color of the heavens.

The four bronze palaces almost fell apart because of his appearance.

"That's... Elder Yin Huaxuan?"

Ouyang, the senior brother of Ruyi Peak, changed his expression drastically.

How could he be inside the secret realm?

And moreover, attacking Junior Sister Ying Bing?

Everyone present was stunned, including Bai Jinghong. No one had expected that this Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, which supposedly only allowed Viewing God realm experts to enter, would actually have an Internal Landscape eighth level expert.

His identity was surprising—he was an elder of the Clear Abyss Sect.

What was even more surprising was that he was an enemy, not a friend.

In the blink of an eye, the semi-human, semi-dragon shadow, like a volcanic eruption, charged down with a ferocious and wild momentum.

"Yin Huaxuan..."

Ying Bing seemed to have figured something out.

With the power accumulated in the Blood Phoenix Essence, she wasn't afraid of an Internal Landscape expert in a one-on-one fight.

But dealing with two联手 (joining forces) was troublesome.

Han Zhen, as a former Profound Realm expert, had uncanny methods and likely held many hidden trump cards.

Furthermore, those Profound Realm bones were difficult to damage. With Yin Huaxuan interfering, she couldn't spare the time to use that "Selfless Sword" again.

More importantly, the Blood Phoenix Essence didn't fully belong to her yet.

Li Mo...

Even if he used a Divine Weapon, he probably couldn't deliver the final blow.

Yin Huaxuan was several times stronger than the Earth Killer from the Drizzle Building.

Every time Li Mo used the "Panjian Falling Star Hammer," he would be drained and fall into a state of weakness, which would undoubtedly put him in danger.

She was the one who wanted the Blood Phoenix Essence.

In her past life, when she ascended to the Nine Heavens, she had encountered countless difficulties and obstacles along the way. She had faced more critical situations and killed stronger enemies.

But...

She had never stood behind anyone.

*Hum—*

Endless moonlight surged upstream, temporarily freezing the middle-aged Han Zhen.

Countless sword intents condensed, shrouded in a glow, forming a wave of beautiful sword light.

She stepped on the light, moving against the current.

*Tink, tink, tink—*

The sword intent was like a wash, blades piercing the air, a storm battering the semi-human, semi-dragon Yin Huaxuan, momentarily extinguishing countless beast shadows.

However, it still failed to injure Yin Huaxuan's true body.

The eighth level of the Internal Landscape was simply too high a realm.

Han Zhen was only immobilized for an instant.

Ying Bing stood her ground, a sickly flush appearing on her jade-like face.

Let alone the Viewing God realm.

If any other Internal Landscape expert faced these two, they would rarely be able to put up a fight.

Even though Ying Bing had done everything possible within the Viewing God realm and possessed the experience of her past life, she still found it taxing.

"It's over."

"You refuse a toast only to drink a forfeit. Hmph."

Han Zhen took a step, his figure flickering as if teleporting.

This palm strike of his carried the charm of a Profound Realm expert holding the Dao, locking down all the space around Ying Bing.

Yin Huaxuan lay in wait. The moment Ying Bing made a move, he would strike with thunderous force.

He was also filled with shock.

Facing this genius he had never seen before, he was on full alert.

The geniuses watching from afar...

---

At this moment, their hearts were in their throats.

Even a fool could see by now that the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm was problematic; it had been a trap from start to finish!

If Ying Bing and Li Mo were taken down, could they survive?

Ying Bing did not look as panicked as Han Zhen and Yin Huaxuan imagined.

The girl's figure was shrouded in burning phoenix feather clothes, making her look even more peerless and mysterious.

She had to use that move.

True Phoenix Transformation.

No matter how profound the martial arts or how mysterious the secret techniques, there is always a corresponding price.

For example, the True Phoenix Blood Burning Method.

If Han Zhen hadn't been used as a tool to kill countless people to accumulate the essence blood of living beings, she wouldn't have been able to借助 (leverage) the Blood Phoenix Essence to raise herself to the ninth level of the Viewing God realm, nor could she have maintained it for so long.

True Phoenix Transformation also had a price.

After using it, the True Phoenix Feathers would temporarily lose their spiritual energy and need time to recover.

In the next system ranking comparison, they would no longer count as her combat power.

This meant...

She might have to be ranked second again, which also meant she had to...

But things had come to this point.

A divine light surged from Ying Bing's brows, and an supremely dignified aura began to emerge...

Han Zhen's expression changed abruptly.

He quickly turned back.

A pitch-black meteor, carrying boundless karma fire, arrived in the blink of an eye, like a star that had just fallen from the heavens.

Anything and everything was as fragile as nothingness in the face of this meteor-like destruction.

This boundless power exceeded the realm of human resistance.

*Clang—*

The palm that locked the space collided with the pitch-black meteor.

Thunder struck.

The sharp killing intent of the weapon swept past, the bronze ground rising and falling like waves, and the intense air pressure ravaged everything.

This hammer didn't hit anyone else.

But everyone watching felt a surge of fear and insignificance rising from the bottom of their hearts.

"Divine Weapon?"

Han Zhen was shaken, his soul trembling, and he was gouged into the ground, leaving a deep trail.

Even his Profound Realm bones felt like they were about to crack.

He looked closely.

He and Yin Huaxuan finally saw a peculiar, unadorned short hammer there, the center of the previous power, where the sharp killing intent of the weapon was born and died, distorting the surrounding space.

"Panjian Falling Star Hammer!"

Han Zhen actually recognized it.

"Impossible, even an Internal Landscape expert can't activate a Divine Weapon. Is Shangguan Wencang here?!"

This thought was quickly rejected.

But a more unbelievable idea quickly arose.

Because just now, the information that the young Han Zhen had been defeated had already reached the middle-aged Han Zhen.

Was it him?

"Oi."

A figure walked out, stepping through the river of blood. He was shirtless, his body not bulky but filled with explosive power, as if cast from iron and steel.

Behind him, a battle god bathing in blood rose, its fighting intent growing even more fierce!

The desire to fight was surging!

Ying Bing was stunned.

He... didn't he usually only have enough energy to use a Divine Weapon once?

Using the Divine Weapon consecutively... was it because of that battle soul behind him?

"I'm quite enduring today."

Li Mo grinned and slowly pulled the Panjian Falling Star Hammer up.

The effect of "growing stronger the more one fights" was probably similar to a rage bar.

"So it was you who killed Cheng'er!"

Yin Huaxuan exploded with rage.

"You, deserve to die!"

The middle-aged Han Zhen, sensing the disappearance of the young Han Zhen's aura, also stared fixedly at the youth.

"I originally wanted to get along with you guys as a swordsman."

"Because of you guys, my forty and eighty have been seen. How am I supposed to make a living in the Jianghu in the future? How do I introduce myself, huh?"

"I'm going to hammer you all to death!!!"

Little Li was furious.

The rage bar was full.

The people below the stairs swallowed their saliva.

Who is challenging whom?

This isn't right.

If they had played games, they would know.

This kind of oppressive feeling was the feeling of a boss entering its final stage and going berserk.
