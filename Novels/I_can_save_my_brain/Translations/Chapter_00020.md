# Chapter 20: The One That Got Away  

A piercing shriek tore through the sky.  

On the distant horizon, demonic beasts surged toward Guang'an Prefecture like a frenzied tide. The sheer number of them was so overwhelming that it triggered a tsunami. Witnessing this terrifying display of nature's wrath, the cultivators on the scene paled.  

At the frontlines, the Zhou Clan cultivators stood firm, their expressions grim. The Zhou family had never expected that what should have been a routine mermaid hunt would escalate into such chaos.  

But there was no turning back now. If the Zhou Clan retreated, the prestige they had built over a thousand years across the surrounding hundred-thousand-mile sea would crumble.  

"Zhou Clan disciples, hear my command—form the formation and defend!" bellowed a Foundation Establishment cultivator at the forefront.  

Within moments, a massive defensive array materialized along the coastline. Every member of the Zhou Clan held their breath, bracing for the incoming onslaught.  

"Activate the Sword Formation!"  

At the command, countless flying swords shot into the sky, weaving together into a dazzling sword formation that slashed toward the charging demonic beasts.  

For an instant, the world seemed to hold its breath—nothing existed but the surging tide of beasts and the radiant sword formation rising from the earth.  

**BOOM!!!**  

The sword formation collided with the tsunami in a deafening explosion. In the blink of an eye, the seawater turned crimson, littered with the corpses of demonic beasts.  

The sight brought relief to the rogue cultivators watching from behind.  

"Low-tier demonic beasts are still just low-tier beasts," remarked Chen Xianhe, floating midair. "No matter how many there are, they can't cause real trouble."  

"The Zhou Clan’s strength is truly formidable," Chen Daoxuan observed. What impressed him wasn’t just the individual prowess of the Zhou cultivators, but their disciplined coordination—a stark contrast to the disorganized rogue cultivators who relied solely on individual skill.  

With the strongest wave of the beast tide shattered by the Zhou Clan, all that remained was mopping up the scattered remnants. The terrified beasts fled in every direction, ignoring the desperate shrieks of the mermaids trying to rally them.  

"It's over," Chen Xianhe declared, seasoned enough to read the battlefield at a glance.  

Indeed, the seemingly endless horde had been crushed in a single clash. Now, the Zhou cultivators and Guang'an Prefecture’s rogue cultivators turned to hunting down the stragglers.  

Ironically, this cleanup proved more tedious than the initial battle. The beasts scattered wildly, forcing the Zhou Clan to ensure none slipped through—lest they infiltrate Guang'an’s riverways and threaten the mortal populace.  

Unlike cultivators, mortals stood no chance against even the weakest demonic beasts. Even a peak Innate Realm martial artist could fall to these creatures, let alone ordinary civilians.  

Fortunately, Guang'an’s harbor was packed with ships, forming a natural barricade against the fleeing beasts. Breaking through to the inner waterways was nearly impossible.  

Aboard the *Canglong*, Chen Daoxuan and Chen Xianhe stood side by side.  

Chen Daoxuan had hoped to test his skills against a beast, but it seemed they were only spectators this time. While the exact number of beasts was impossible to tally, one thing was certain—there were far fewer than the gathered cultivators.  

With most already slain by the Zhou Clan, the rogue cultivators would be lucky to find any leftovers.  

Noticing Chen Daoxuan’s eager expression, Chen Xianhe chuckled. "Most of these are trash-tier beasts. Even if you kill them, their corpses are practically useless. Why waste the effort?"  

Chen Daoxuan grinned. "I know, but I just want to try my hand at it."  

Chen Xianhe sighed. Cultivators spent years in seclusion, honing power they rarely had a chance to use. It was no wonder conflicts erupted so easily—pent-up energy demanded release.  

Just as Chen Xianhe was about to respond, the *Canglong* shuddered violently.  

"Damn it—a Four-Eyed Tigerfish!"  

With a sweep of his divine sense, Chen Xianhe spotted a monstrous fish, over ten feet long with four blood-red eyes, gnawing at the ship’s hull.  

"You wretched beast!"  

Enraged at the damage to the clan’s only cargo ship, Chen Xianhe summoned a flying sword and slashed downward.  

**SWOOSH!**  

The sword gleamed as it sliced through the water, emerging moments later. The assault on the *Canglong* ceased. Soon, blood bubbled to the surface, followed by the corpse of the Four-Eyed Tigerfish.  

Chen Daoxuan examined the beast closely—it had been cleanly bisected.  

Using his qi, he lifted the carcass for inspection. This was his first real look at a demonic beast. During the last beast tide in Changping County a decade ago, he’d been too terrified to notice details.  

"So this is a demonic beast? Pathetic," he muttered.  

Chen Xianhe’s expression turned serious. "Don’t underestimate them. This thing is barely a beast—just a mutated creature tainted by demonic energy. A true first-tier demonic beast wouldn’t go down so easily."  

He added sternly, "If you ever face a beast of equal cultivation alone, don’t engage recklessly. Most cultivators can’t win one-on-one against them."  

Chen Daoxuan nodded solemnly. He trusted his elder’s experience far more than his own limited knowledge.  

Noticing his nephew’s disappointment, Chen Xianhe relented. "Fine, stop sulking. The next one’s yours—I’ll back you up."  

Before Chen Daoxuan could respond, a powerful demonic aura surged toward the *Canglong*.  

"A first-tier beast!" someone nearby shouted in alarm.  

"How did the Zhou Clan let this slip through?!" others cursed.  

Drawn by the blood of the Four-Eyed Tigerfish, the massive beast lingered near the ship, feasting on the carcass.  

The *Canglong* was no small vessel—over 160 meters long—yet compared to this creature, it seemed insignificant. The beast’s exposed spine alone surpassed the ship’s mast in height. Its full length had to exceed sixty meters!  

Even with his reincarnated soul, Chen Daoxuan had never seen anything so colossal. A chill ran down his spine.  

For now, the beast seemed content with its meal, showing no immediate interest in attacking.
