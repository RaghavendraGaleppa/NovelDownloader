# Chapter 484: The Body of Amitabha in the World

He was actually able to shatter his Great Bodhisattva's Golden Body Dharma Form?!

Even if a Great True Person were to come, they might not be able to achieve such a clean and complete erosion.

Sanzang's brows furrowed deeply as he carefully observed the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi that was disintegrating his own Dharma Form's Golden Body. Then, his expression shifted slightly, as if he had recalled something.

At that moment, a low shout came from Xu Yunfan.

"Break for me...!"

Xu Yunfan pressed his advantage without mercy, suppressing the churning in his organs with great effort as he let out a low roar.

Under the催动 of his will, the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi erupted with its final, brilliant light.

*BOOM RUMBLE RUMBLE!!!*

The thirty-foot-tall, majestic, immeasurable Golden Body Dharma Form of the Nondual Radiance Illuminating the Ten Directions and Eight Divisions of World-Protectors, which was comparable to the methods of a Great True Person, finally let out a world-shaking悲鸣. It was as if billions of explosives had been set off inside it, or as if billions of invisible venomous snakes were gnawing and destroying it from within. Under the final onslaught of the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi, it shattered inch by inch, turning into a sky full of collapsing golden light and轰然 disintegrating.

The vast Buddhist power went completely out of control, forming a terrifying explosion shockwave that plowed another huge crater into the ground.

The dust settled, the Buddhist light faded, and all that remained on the spot was the figure of Sanzang's true body, his face as pale as paper.

There was no trace of his former calm and detachment.

His aura was萎靡 to the extreme, his kasaya stained with blood, and his figure swayed as if on the verge of collapse. It was clear that the destruction of his Golden Body had inflicted an unimaginable heavy injury upon him.

He stared fixedly at Xu Yunfan, his eyes no longer containing any compassion, only a torrential rage, disbelief, and a sliver of deeply hidden terror.

He could not for the life of him understand how a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator, even if he had cultivated the True Warrior Subduing Demons Dharma Form, could掌握 a power capable of反噬 and melting down his Arhat-level Golden Body's Buddhist power.

However, at the very moment Sanzang's mind was violently shaken, his foundation was injured, and his aura fell to its lowest point, his expression instead calmed down in an instant.

That was not the weakness and calm after an injury, but a kind of...

Absolute stillness, as if in the eye of a storm.

The rage and terror churning in his eyes receded like the tide, replaced by an indescribable clarity, as if it was the non-joy, non-sorrow of eons of time settling down.

Xu Yunfan's heart sounded a frantic alarm.

This calm was more unsettling than any roar. A sense of crisis from the depths of his bloodline was frantically warning him, and his martial artist's intuition was pounding straight into his skull.

The next second, a sudden change occurred.

The faint Buddhist light on Sanzang, which was almost extinguished, lit up again without any warning.

But this time, the nature of the light was completely different.

It was no longer a bright golden yellow, but a pure, ultimate, and eternally gentle light of lapis lazuli.

This light was not dazzling, but it carried a great power that pierced through the soul and soothed all things.

It spread out gently, silently smoothing the residual energy storms raging across the battlefield, and smoothing the ugly gullies and scorch marks on the earth.

The space around, twisted and fluctuating from the intense battle, was as if gently smoothed by an invisible giant hand, returning to stability and tranquility.

The wind stopped, the dust settled, and even the sound of rolling broken stones seemed to cease.

An unprecedentedly vast, profound, inclusive, and awe-inspiring aura of compassion, like a giant sleeping for ten thousand years awakening, slowly spread out, filling the heavens and earth.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted violently.

He raised his head abruptly, looking behind Sanzang.

There, it was not a giant Dharma Form manifesting.

It was...

A phantom so clear it seemed to be projected from an infinitely distant shore.

It was the figure of one seated in the void.

His face was serene and tranquil, his eyes lowered, and the corners of his mouth held a compassionate smile that understood the suffering of all sentient beings.

His form was neither male nor female, neither old nor young, seeming to be right before one's eyes, yet also as if separated by countless worlds.

He wore a simple monk's robe, yet it emitted a more majestic aura than any emperor's coronation robes.

His hands formed an extremely simple meditation seal, the tips of his fingers seeming to牵引 the threads of all causes and conditions in the world.

Behind Him, there was no wheel of Buddhist light, no guardian celestial dragons, only a circle of purest, cleanest light halo that seemed to be able to contain the boundless star sea and purify all afflictions.

This phantom was not tall, but it was as if the entire heavens and earth were within His embrace, and all things were born and destroyed within His lowered gaze.

An indescribable pressure descended. This pressure did not come from a crushing of power, but from a transcendence of level, an absolute sublimity of status.

The Body of Amitabha in the World!

Xu Yunfan's soul trembled violently.

In his mind, fragmented records about the highest Buddha in the Buddhist legends flashed by. The descriptions perfectly matched the boundless compassion, immeasurable inclusiveness, and the eternal feeling of penetrating past, present, and future brought by the phantom before him.

This was not a Dharma Form; this was a higher-level existence...

A projection that had descended, an incarnation formed through enlightenment.

It was using Sanzang's damaged vessel and status channel to temporarily reside here. Perhaps the Lord of the Pure Land of Bliss did not pay much attention, merely casting down a sliver of His will.

However, the calm before him was the absolute control at the moment of this existence's descent.

What the hell, he was just going out for a trip, how did it end up attracting the attention of the Buddha Master of the Bodhi Pure Land, who actually enlightened Sanzang on the spot, turning him into the Body of Amitabha in the World?

The only thing worth celebrating was that the other party was merely an enlightenment. Although the aura was magnificent and vast, with the state of immeasurable light illuminating the ten directions, it had ultimately not exceeded the Foundation Establishment level.

But its power and realm had definitely reached the absolute limit of what Foundation Establishment could achieve.

Xu Yunfan's expression was extremely solemn. His thoughts raced as he hesitated whether he needed to switch souls with his deity.

This opponent was just too damn despicable and shameless.

It was like the final boss standing at the entrance of the新手村 (newbie village) to slaughter players.

It was so blatant it wasn't even trying to hide it.

The Eight Scenery Cloud Qi around him was still instinctively evolving and flowing, colorful and ever-changing, containing the ability to refine and transform creation.

However, at this moment, the power that could refine all things and melt down everything seemed incredibly sluggish and insignificant before the purest and cleanest halo of immeasurable lapis lazuli.

It was like a raging tidal wave crashing against the shore boat that carried the heavens and earth, unable to stir even the slightest ripple.

The cloud qi was still spreading, turning into a sky full of gorgeous multicolored clouds, but it could not touch the phantom in the slightest, let alone harm it.

The True Warrior Foundation behind him, which had been temporarily retracted after being replaced by the Xuan Du Eight Scenery Heavenly Transformation Cloud Scripture, was...
