# Chapter 56: Spiritual Eyes Achieved, Third-Grade Formation  

The eyeballs are critically important—any mistake could lead to significant damage.  

Thus, before truly cultivating the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*, Qi Chuan meticulously studied the manual again and again.  

**[You diligently read the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*, attempting to grasp its fundamentals. Triggered a 17x critical hit, gaining 17x rewards. Your understanding of *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* has slightly improved.]**  

**[You diligently read the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*, attempting to grasp its fundamentals. Triggered a 22x critical hit, gaining 22x rewards. Your understanding of *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* has slightly improved.]**  

...  

As lines of text continuously appeared before his eyes, Qi Chuan's comprehension of the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* deepened.  

Eventually, even the gains from reading the manual diminished.  

"It should be about time."  

Noticing this, Qi Chuan smiled faintly, realizing it was time to begin cultivating the technique.  

He returned to the only stone chamber in his residence, which housed a first-grade upper-tier spiritual vein, and sat cross-legged on the bed. Closing his eyes, he began circulating the cultivation method of the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*.  

Strands of spiritual energy from his dantian were carefully guided through his meridians toward his eyes, where they split into finer threads and circulated in a unique pattern.  

This process was highly dangerous—any mistake could have severe consequences.  

However, Qi Chuan's profound understanding of the technique allowed him to proceed cautiously and smoothly.  

As time passed, the spiritual energy continued to flow through his eyes, and gradually, a faint cooling sensation spread across his eyeballs.  

He paused his cultivation and opened his eyes, immediately seeing a line of text appear:  

**[You cultivated the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*, circulating spiritual energy in a unique pattern within your eyes for an extended period. Triggered a 49x critical hit, gaining 49x rewards. Your *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* has improved slightly.]**  

As the text appeared, Qi Chuan felt the cooling sensation in his eyes intensify.  

When he looked around the stone chamber, everything appeared sharper. Even without focusing, the fine details of objects became clearer.  

Though he was already a fifth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator with senses far surpassing those of mortals, the improvement still felt akin to a reduction in nearsightedness from his past life.  

"Is this the power of an ocular technique?" Qi Chuan murmured in amazement.  

This was only the initial stage—he hadn't even fully mastered it yet. If he succeeded, the effects would likely be even more astonishing, allowing him to easily see through ordinary concealment techniques.  

"Continue cultivating."  

After a brief moment of wonder, Qi Chuan closed his eyes again and resumed the unique cultivation method.  

**[You cultivated the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*, circulating spiritual energy in a unique pattern within your eyes for an extended period. Triggered a 36x critical hit, gaining 36x rewards. Your *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* has improved slightly.]**  

...  

Eight days later.  

Qi Chuan, still seated in meditation, slowly opened his eyes. In that instant, a clear, transparent spiritual light flickered within his dark pupils.  

The light did not immediately fade but instead lingered like an invisible film, covering his irises and even the whites of his eyes.  

His eyes widened slightly in astonishment—his vision had completely transformed.  

"Is this the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* at the entry level?" he muttered in awe.  

It felt as though he had undergone another leap—akin to his transition from mortal to Qi Refinement cultivator, but this time solely in terms of vision.  

Five years ago, when he first reached the first layer of Qi Refinement, his eyes had been enhanced by spiritual energy, granting him the sharp vision of a cultivator.  

But since then, he had never experienced such a dramatic improvement again.  

Though his eyesight had naturally improved as his cultivation advanced, the change had never been as pronounced as this.  

"Truly worthy of an ocular technique..."  

Even at the entry level, the effects were astounding.  

If he mastered it completely, he suspected that no concealment technique within the Qi Refinement realm would escape his sight.  

"However, inside this stone chamber, the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* can't fully demonstrate its power. I should test it outside where the view is broader."  

Inside the chamber, everything was already close and unobstructed. The technique merely enhanced details, making little practical difference.  

Outside, however, would be different.  

With this thought, Qi Chuan left the chamber and exited the cave residence, arriving at the entrance.  

From there, he could see the vast expanse of Fengyue Lake, its surface shrouded in dense white mist that obscured much of the view, making the numerous islands difficult to discern.  

Even the two towering mountains at the lake's center—Fengling Mountain and Yueying Mountain—were barely visible as faint outlines.  

The reason for this wasn't just distance or the thick mist—there was likely something else at play.  

Qi Chuan activated the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes*, his pupils now coated in a transparent spiritual film. Instantly, his vision transformed.  

The mist over the lake seemed to thin significantly, though it remained present. The distant islands became slightly clearer, though still indistinct.  

As for Fengling and Yueying Mountains, they remained unchanged—still veiled in deep mist, their outlines just as vague as before.  

"This..."  

Qi Chuan was momentarily stunned.  

He had expected the *Dongqing Spiritual Eyes* to allow him to see the mountains clearly.  

Yet, not only were the mountains still obscured, but even the farther islands remained unclear.  

This was unexpected.  

"Could it be... that the entire Fengyue Lake is covered by an enormous formation?"  

A startling thought struck him, and the more he considered it, the more plausible it seemed.  

In fact, he suspected that Fengling Mountain, Yueying Mountain, the islands on the lake, and even the inner sect spiritual peak he stood upon were all part of the formation.  

Fengling and Yueying Mountains might even serve as its core anchors.  

If his conjecture was correct, this colossal protective formation would have to be at least third-grade—far beyond even second-grade peak formations.  

"If it's a third-grade formation, even a Golden Core cultivator wouldn't be able to breach it, right?"  

The realization filled Qi Chuan with immense reassurance.  

He had truly chosen the right sect—Fengyue Sect was perfect for someone with lofty ambitions like him.
