# Chapter 38: The Vessel of Enlightenment

From Little Luo, Han Yue learned that the first third-grade magical artifact a cultivator refines is often called the "Vessel of Enlightenment."

Most promising cultivators with proper backgrounds obtain their first third-grade artifact during their second-stage Divine Ability cultivation. 

Since third-grade artifacts are overwhelmingly powerful and most second-stage cultivators can only wield one at a time, cultivators typically adjust their cultivation path and combat system based on the artifact they acquire.

If the first third-grade artifact is defensive in nature, the cultivator would focus more on offensive techniques in their training. Conversely, if it's an offensive artifact, they could safely devote their efforts to defensive spells.

One could say the first third-grade artifact has the greatest influence on a cultivator's path—it's the vessel that carries them forward in their Dao journey, hence the name "Vessel of Enlightenment."

The opportunity and financial means to obtain a third-grade artifact is often seen as a crucial turning point in a cultivator's path. This was precisely why Little Luo abandoned her lucrative partnership with Han Yue without hesitation—she had finally saved enough to return to her sect and exchange for suitable third-grade materials to craft her own Vessel of Enlightenment.

As a true disciple of a top-tier sect, Little Luo had only just reached the stage where she could obtain her Vessel of Enlightenment, highlighting how rare such opportunities were.

Before leaving, Little Luo had given Han Yue specific advice regarding third-grade artifacts: he should forgo pre-forged runic artifacts and instead seek unrefined third-grade materials. 

This was because a cultivator's self-refined Vessel of Enlightenment would naturally be most compatible with them, providing the greatest assistance in their cultivation. Conversely, forcibly refining an incompatible artifact might grant temporary power but would ultimately hinder one's Dao path in the long run.

Moreover, if a cultivator chose a pre-forged third-grade artifact as their Vessel of Enlightenment, they would inevitably be influenced by the original creator's imprint during use, requiring tedious purification through subsequent refinements.

Thus, among elite disciples of major sects, there was a consensus regarding the Vessel of Enlightenment: to truly achieve longevity, one must select the most compatible third-grade materials during the second-stage Divine Ability realm and personally refine their Vessel of Enlightenment. All other choices were merely compromises born of necessity.

Of course, such high standards only applied to those with true longevity potential. The vast majority of cultivators simply had to make do with whatever they could obtain. Many cultivation lineages didn't even include methods for refining a Vessel of Enlightenment—in such cases, one had to use whatever came to hand and make the best of it.

Little Luo had mentioned that all top-tier sects' longevity-oriented advanced legacies contained multiple methods for refining Vessels of Enlightenment. Many such vessels had become iconic symbols of their respective sects due to their fame. 

For example, the Beast Taming Sect's "Great Dragon Subduing Demons True Scripture" recorded the renowned "Demon Driving Whip." This fame stemmed from a Beast Taming Sect longevity elder who had refined his Vessel of Enlightenment—the "Demon Driving Whip"—into a fourth-grade "God-Smiting Whip," transforming it into a mighty treasure that safeguarded the sect for generations.

Unfortunately, Han Yue's own legacy remained undetermined, making discussion of a Vessel of Enlightenment premature. At least he hadn't even reached the second stage yet—merely touching upon third-grade materials already placed him far ahead of his peers. 

Thus, Han Yue absolutely wouldn't pass up this opportunity to obtain third-grade materials through the merchant association's artifact conference. Even if he couldn't use them immediately, possessing third-grade artifacts would facilitate future exchanges. 

Accordingly, during this conference, Han Yue would prioritize materials with broader applications and higher compatibility with spellcasters. 

The materials catalog in Han Yue's hands listed seven confirmed third-grade artifacts for the conference, each with a name and brief description. Han Yue analyzed them one by one.

The first item was a magical lamp:
[Pure Sun Lamp]
[Description: A heavy offensive treasure forged from Pure Sun Divine Fire and third-grade mountain copper.]
[Base price: 5,000 mid-grade spirit stones]

The description was concise and unembellished. This pre-forged offensive artifact wasn't Han Yue's target.

The second item was a rune:
[Great Mystic Light Divine Rune]
[Description: A third-grade divine rune from the Great Mystic Sect, containing the power of a single strike from a third-stage cultivator's Mystic Light divine ability.]
[Base price: 1,000 mid-grade spirit stones]

The third item was a rare flame:
[Stoneheart Flame]
[Description: A rare third-grade flame.]
[Base price: 2,000 mid-grade spirit stones]

The fourth and fifth items were rare metals:
[Hour of the Hare Gold], [Hour of the Tiger Silver]
[Description: Rare third-grade metals.]
[Base price: 2,000 mid-grade spirit stones each]

These three were all unrefined third-grade materials.

The sixth and seventh items were materials with special effects:
[Elixir-Dissolving Water]
[Description: Dispels elixir impurities, improving core formation quality for second-stage cultivators.]
[Base price: 2,000 mid-grade spirit stones]

[Emperor's Sap]
[Description: Purifies flesh and mana while enhancing spiritual sense.]
[Base price: 2,000 mid-grade spirit stones]

After careful analysis, Han Yue reached a conclusion: he had enough money, wanted them all, and wasn't willing to let a single one slip away!

Of course, he knew this was wishful thinking. Third-grade treasures were rare, and the listed base prices certainly wouldn't be the final bids. The seven items' combined base price was 14,000 mid-grade spirit stones, while Han Yue possessed over 43,000.

If possible, Han Yue would invest all his spirit stones in competing for these third-grade items. However, as this was his first conference, he could only formulate a bidding strategy based on his best guesses.

He categorized the items into tiers based on initial impressions and set maximum bid limits accordingly:

Lowest priority were the [Pure Sun Lamp] and [Emperor's Sap] with base prices of 5,000 and 2,000 stones respectively. Han Yue planned only symbolic bids—adding just 200 stones to the base price—hoping to snag a bargain if possible.

Medium priority were the [Great Mystic Light Divine Rune] and [Elixir-Dissolving Water] with base prices of 1,000 and 2,000 stones. His maximum bids would be triple the base prices.

Highest priority were the remaining three items—[Stoneheart Flame], [Hour of the Hare Gold], and [Hour of the Tiger Silver], each with a 2,000-stone base price. His maximum bids would be quadruple the base prices.

The total maximum bids for all seven items came to exactly 43,400 mid-grade spirit stones—precisely exhausting Han Yue's current resources.
