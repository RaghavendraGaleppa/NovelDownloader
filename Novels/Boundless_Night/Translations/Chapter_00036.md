# Chapter 36: Matters Resolved, He Dusts His Robes and Departs

Qin Ming did not peel the stone skin further. The environment in the mountain forest did not allow him to act impulsively. If a beam of light were to erupt here, his life would be in danger.

After the stone shrunk by two sizes, it could barely fit into the sleeve of his beast hide robe, but he didn't put it there. Qin Ming walked out of the mountain, leaving the stone in the dense forest.

He noticed that someone was watching the exit from the mountain. For the sake of the special resources within the nodes, major organizations were keeping a very close eye.

Not long after, he saw the woman in the fur cloak again. She was tall and stood in the wind and snow, her dark hair fluttering in the wind, but her true face remained hidden.

"He's unharmed, indeed." The raven was also there, having already spotted Qin Ming. Symbols flickered in its pair of purple eyes as it gave him a few extra glances.

Qin Ming's expression was calm, but a ripple stirred in his heart. Along the way, he wondered how many pairs of eyes had swept over those leaving the mountain. If he were to travel with the stone, he would certainly expose himself.

The purple-eyed raven circled in the sky, wishing it could also charge into the great mountain. It said, "This place is already incomprehensible. How can a ten-colored node appear? And it's merged with a five-colored mist-haze land! I'm practically drooling. I should have had your master come personally and invited old Raven Lord out of the Black Mist World. Let's see who dares to stop us then!"

The woman in the black cloak said, "Don't act recklessly. All the high-level beings are in a frenzy now. We'll wait for the right moment."

Qin Ming found Mu Qing, Cao Long, and the others outside the great mountain. He noticed that this group of noble direct descendants was quite cautious, none of them acting rashly.

"Where did you run off to, kid? It's too dangerous in the mountains now," the Black Sheep Knight, Yang Yongqing, asked him.

"Chasing that speaking sparrow, but I lost it," Qin Ming replied with a smile.

Upon hearing this, Cao Long immediately asked where he lost it. That speaking sparrow had offended him deeply, and he still hadn't cooled down.

On this day, the commotion in the depths of the great mountain was simply too immense. Even the ordinary villagers nearby were gazing, never having seen such a dazzling, day-bright spectacle in their lives.

Dawn was almost breaking, yet there was still no outcome in the great mountain.

After dutifully asking his employers and confirming they wouldn't enter the mountain, Qin Ming called out, "Uncle Xu, Old Man Liu, we should head back."

"Huh? Why go back so early?" Old Man Liu hadn't had enough of watching.

"To go back and eat! We've been hungry all day!" Qin Ming said.

Wei Zhirou, Cao Long, Mu Qing, and the others couldn't help but glance at him, thinking that this young man was truly pure-hearted and simple. Such a grand event in the mountains, attracting attention from all directions, couldn't sway his desire to go back and eat.

"True, even if we watched for three days and three nights, it wouldn't concern us. Let's go, time to eat," Old Man Liu said.

The Black Sheep Knight Yang Yongqing and Xu Yueping also left. Although the mountain was ablaze with color, it was not their world.

At night, Qin Ming arrived at the village entrance, sitting beneath the Black and White Twin Trees, gazing towards the great mountain. It was as bright as day there, all the dazzling colors undiminished, so fresh and inviting that one couldn't help but yearn to approach.

"So this is Black and White Mountain. It's a shame that after its collapse five hundred years ago, it no longer has its former black and white landscape."

Qin Ming was surprised. He saw two women in the snow and heard these words.

He was a local, yet he didn't know the old name "Black and White Mountain." Normally, when entering the mountains, he'd just refer to different areas as "East Ridge" or "West Gully." These two foreign women, however, knew more than he did.

In the wind and snow, the two women stood gracefully, their robes fluttering. They were dressed very lightly, yet it was far from the high-temperature summer when the fire spring was most active.

After approaching the village entrance, the two observed the Black and White Twin Trees in the fire spring.

"It's surprising that this village actually has Black and White Twin Trees. They must have sprouted from seeds left behind by Black and White Mountain back then," the woman who had spoken earlier said.

She wore a white dress, which stood out even more in the night lit by fire-like glow. She was surrounded by a faint white mist, but one could clearly see her pretty face, slightly plump like a baby's. She was clearly not old, perhaps only fifteen or sixteen, with arched eyebrows and sparkling, clear eyes, very beautiful.

If it were Qin Ming, he certainly wouldn't choose to wear white clothes; it was too conspicuous for hunting in the mountains and unsuitable for survival there.

He soon noticed that the white-clothed girl treated the other woman as her principal, always following her.

Qin Ming realized something was off. The white-clothed girl was clearly two steps behind, so how could he have overlooked the woman in front of her? It was a bit strange.

The woman in front wore a simple, unadorned green dress. She stood silently in the wind and snow, carefully observing the two old trees in the fire spring.

Thick mist surrounded her, making her appear hazy, her face indistinct. She had a very ethereal aura, like an immortal about to ride the wind away.

Qin Ming stood up, feeling it was inappropriate to sit by the fire spring any longer, and greeted the two women.

They nodded in response. The green-clothed woman spoke for the first time: "What is the name of this village?"

"Twin Trees Village," Qin Ming informed them, taking the opportunity to ask, "Is there any lore about the former Black and White Mountain?"

The green-clothed woman's voice was soft and pleasant to listen to. She said, "Half of the land was pitch black, and the other half was as bright as day. The middle was obstructed by thick mist. It was once a forbidden zone, which later collapsed."

"Young man, it's quite rare for my young lady to speak so much with you," the white-clothed girl, clearly of a lively disposition, said. Their relationship didn't seem like a pure master-servant one, given she dared to make such a joke.

The green-clothed woman said nothing more, finally taking a deep look at the Black and White Twin Trees before turning and walking towards the great mountain. Though her steps were light and graceful, her conviction seemed very firm.

"How should I address the two young ladies?" Qin Ming asked from behind.

The white-clothed girl chuckled lightly: "Young man, don't overthink things. We will disappear soon. We are separated from you by boundless mountains and seas."

"I just asked for your names. How far is 'boundless'? Do you not usually reside among mortals?" Qin Ming said.

The white-clothed girl laughed: "Oh, you truly are simple and lovely. Judging by the path you walk, when you stand at the peak of a mountain, there might be a tiny chance you'll see us from afar on certain occasions."

"Talkative, loose-tongued," the green-clothed woman reprimanded.

Qin Ming watched their retreating figures, speechless. Who were these people? For a moment, he really wanted to punch the white-clothed girl until she cried and ask her what nonsense she was spouting.

"You go back. Summon the Golden Roc. I'm going into the mountain," the green-clothed woman said.

"Alright!" The white-clothed girl turned and walked in another direction.

Qin Ming's pupils contracted. The white-clothed girl's departure speed was too fast, even a bit outrageous. A misty white fog flowed before her, isolating all wind and snow, and gradually enveloped her entire body. In just a blink of an eye, she vanished into the horizon.

The next day, Qin Ming responsibly led the group as a guide, because Mu Qing, Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and the others finally couldn't sit still and began exploring the nodes in the outer areas of the great mountain.

Previously, four organizations had successively harvested mysterious resources, albeit at the cost of some members being severely corroded by the light mist.

All the new cultivators were restless, meticulously searching. Figures were everywhere in the mountains, intending to break into dangerous underground node spaces.

As for the deepest part of the great mountain, it remained as bright as day. The high-ranking members of major organizations and those high-level aberrant beings had been tormented for a day and a night, their eyes red.

They had originally come to capture the mysterious resources, at first patiently fishing, but now they had been outsmarted by the "fish."

Those two wonders, having merged into one, were constantly shifting. Sometimes they would sink deep underground for a long time before emerging, bringing dazzling light and thick mist. Up until now, no one had been able to get close enough to see clearly what it actually was.

Finally, everyone went all out, enduring the terrible corrosion, delving deep underground from the node spaces, preparing to cut off its path within the spiritual ley lines created by the celestial light.

Even those who had set up the traps, like Ling Xu and Old Weasel, no longer had the mood to "fish." Instead, they had "baited themselves," all plunging headfirst into the nodes and entering the underground world.

They had a feeling that after the two mysterious resources merged, they might have completed their final transformation and were about to emerge. They had to go all out.

Such competition grew fiercer, with some high-level beings dying directly underground, never to surface again.

As they vanished from the surface, those outside the great mountain breathed a sigh of relief.

"Old Wang, don't be excessive! This spiritual sapling is already mine! Are you trying to openly snatch it?!" In the distance, an old man, covered in blood, escaped from a node, clutching a foot-tall sapling swirling with purple mist.

"Stop him! That old geezer from the Cao family dug up a Life-Extending Tree that can extend one's life by ten years!" the pursuing Old Man Wang shouted.

"Seventh Uncle, come this way! Let's see who dares to stop you!" Cao Long roared, sitting atop a giant, wholly crimson ox taller than an adult man, wielding a gleaming great spear.

"Good nephew, quickly bring people to help me block them."

An old man, his black armor shattered, ran over. As he did, he grunted and directly ate the sapling, not even sparing the roots still clinging to a bit of soil, chewing them all up and swallowing them.

"Old geezer Wang, it's already in my belly! What can you do to me?" The old man from the Cao family laughed loudly.

"Everyone, cut open his belly! The medicinal effects are still there!" Old Man Wang shouted.

Nearby, six or seven old men approached, their eyes terrifying. To them, extending their lives was more precious than any mysterious resource.

"Old geezer Wang, you truly are rotten from head to toe! No wonder your young son, Wang Nianzhu, committed so many evil deeds and became a wanted criminal, because you yourself are no good!" Cao Long's Seventh Uncle was very agitated. Looking at the approaching old men, he said, "If you truly mean to kill me, don't blame me for sickening you to death!"

He looked at the big yellow dog Old Man Liu was sitting on, then glanced at Yang Yongqing's black goat, and said, "If you really force my hand, I'll immediately cut open the goat's belly right now and drink its urine! Then you can eat that kind of life-extending medicine!"

Old Man Liu and the others were stunned. This truly was a ruthless individual. But why was he staring at the big yellow dog?

Next to him, Yang Yongqing's black goat immediately peed with a splash. Clearly, it was already spiritual and sensed that things were going badly.

And the big yellow dog Old Man Liu was sitting on also reacted, directly defecating.

"I... why are you reacting so strongly?" Old Cao Seven was thoroughly exasperated.

"Alright, Old Cao Seven, if you're truly that ruthless, we'll turn and leave. We'll just watch here now. Do you dare to do it?!"

"Enough!" Cao Long moved, urging his giant ox forward, holding his great spear and directly cleaving down towards Old Man Wang.

"Young man, I know you're powerful, but... Aah!" The long saber in Old Man Wang's hand was sent flying. His hands were covered in blood, and he himself was sent tumbling sideways.

"Good nephew, you're actually this powerful! You didn't waste your time studying in that great city!" Old Cao Seven was both shocked and delighted.

Immediately, several old men retreated.

Cao Long's act of toppling an elder made all sides wary and dare not approach, making their area quite safe.

During this period, Qin Ming inquired with members of the Mu, Cao, and Wei families about the types and characteristics of mysterious resources.

For the people of Crimson Mist City, this was already public knowledge, no secret at all. A few casual words would greatly broaden the horizons of Qin Ming, Xu Yueping, and others.

"Spiritual resources like plants and ground liquids are easy to pick and collect. The troublesome ones are the special resources wrapped in stone skin, which are often overlooked and easily missed if one isn't careful."

Qin Ming learned a lot of useful knowledge, and some of his doubts were resolved.

Unless a special resource was inherently dazzling and illuminated the world, once peeled, the brief celestial light would dissipate, and it would return to a calm state.

Qin Ming pondered that the stone he picked up could be cut open and examined; there shouldn't be any major problems.

As dawn was about to break, he hid in a snowdrift and peeled off the stone skin. Sure enough, wisps of celestial light emanated, entering his body.

Beneath the stone skin, a pure white jade-like glow was revealed, crystalline and translucent.

"Could this be the Mutton-Fat Jade Iron they spoke of?" Qin Ming had only heard a few simple mentions, knowing it was a rare material that could be refined into weapons imbued with mysterious properties.

Of course, while Mutton-Fat Jade Iron was rare, it wasn't priceless. Each time the celestial light descended, some materials of similar quality could be collected. Even in the same location, multiple pieces of Mutton-Fat Jade Iron might be collected.

He reburied the stone with a peeled corner. After confirming that it wasn't some spiritual substance meant for direct consumption, he wasn't in a hurry and decided to retrieve it later.

It was already late, and Qin Ming had long since finished his guide duties, preparing to leave the great mountain.

Boom!

The earth trembled and the mountains shook. In the distance, immeasurable light surged forth, even more brilliant than before, stinging people's eyes and making them involuntarily shed tears after gazing at it.

"What happened?" Everyone was shocked.

In the depths of the great mountain, with five colors and ten lights, a mysterious resource emerged, was snatched, and then burst out from an underground fissure.

A woman moved at extreme speed through the mountain forest, but she couldn't conceal her figure at all. Although the special resource she had obtained was sealed by stone skin, intense fluctuations still spread in all directions, and it continuously emitted light. It seemed it would take some time before it completely extinguished.

During this time, she summoned a golden giant bird, immediately leaped onto it, and the giant bird carried her soaring into the sky, about to flee to the horizon.

However, Moon Worm, a winged human-shaped being, and the Feathered Robe Woman standing on the back of a green bird, among others—a total of six high-level beings—blocked her path.

"It's her?" Qin Ming was surprised. It was indeed the green-clothed woman he had seen at the village entrance last night. So young, yet so powerful, daring to snatch food from the mouths of a group of high-level beings.

The green-clothed woman was suppressed by the six masters, forced back towards the mountain forest.

Qin Ming turned and ran, simultaneously exhibiting "blending light with dust" to its utmost, as they were not far from him.

"Whoosh!" The green-clothed woman, in mid-air, forcefully broke the foot-long stone in her hand, directly extracting the mysterious resource from within.

The light in her hand became even more intense, five colors and ten lights intertwining in the void, tearing apart the night sky.

The outermost layer of the object was a light mist, concealing an unknown dazzling item, which she astonishingly pressed towards a crystalline red mole between her eyebrows.

The brilliant light mass actually merged directly into it. And she, standing on the back of the golden great bird, was not suppressed and forced to the ground, but sped away towards the distance, skimming over the forest.

"Chase!" All the strong experts from major organizations and high-level aberrant beings gave chase.

It was unknown how much time passed before Qin Ming finally breathed a sigh of relief, emerging from the dense forest. He moved through the heavy night, successively finding the two broken pieces of stone.

"Hm?!" He was startled. After experiencing, being cleansed by, and adapting to the celestial light corrosion in the earth fissures, he had gained a special perception. The stone in his left hand seemed to emit a faint fluctuation.
