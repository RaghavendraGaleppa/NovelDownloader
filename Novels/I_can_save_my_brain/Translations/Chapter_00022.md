# Chapter 22: Flying Snow Slays the Demon

"Give it a try?"

"How exactly?"

Chen Xianhe was already astonished by his nephew's mastery of the "Gale Sword Technique." Now, the boy was talking about slaying a late-stage first-rank demonic serpent. How could Chen Xianhe possibly believe it?

Just as he was about to dissuade him, the black-robed elder's roar echoed in everyone's ears once more: "Be careful, everyone! This beast is about to break free!"

No sooner had the words left his mouth than the ice encasing the blood-spotted sea serpent's towering body began to crack. Shards of ice scattered across the sea, sending massive splashes into the air.

"Hiss!!!"

The serpent let out a deafening shriek. A chill ran down everyone's spines. Chen Xianhe noticed that the weakest among them, a cultivator at the second level of Qi Refinement, was trembling uncontrollably in fear.

"We're done for!" the black-robed elder lamented inwardly.

No matter how unwilling he was, the only option now was to flee for their lives. The blood-spotted sea serpent shook its massive body, sending ice shards raining down—some into the water, others onto the frozen sea surface with loud thuds.

As the serpent was on the verge of breaking free, just when despair had taken hold of everyone, a streak of sword light pierced through the sky.

The sword was pure white, its radiance extending nearly ten feet. Even from hundreds of feet away, the onlookers could feel the chilling aura and terrifying power emanating from it.

"Nine-foot sword radiance! A top-grade first-rank flying sword!"

"Is this the power of a top-grade first-rank magical artifact?"

"It's over! The serpent is done for! Die! Die! Hahaha!"

"..."

When the black-robed elder saw this sword, a surge of fear welled up within him. Clearly, this strike was powerful enough to threaten his life.

At that moment, Chen Daoxuan felt as though the air in front of his flying sword had turned viscous, as if something was hindering him from unleashing its full power. However, this sensation vanished in an instant.

To the spectators, the Flying Snow Sword was not only terrifying in power but also swift as a rainbow. Compared to their own flying swords, Chen Daoxuan's was at least twice as fast.

This was the result of mastering the "Gale Sword Technique"—not only did the flying sword's speed double, but its power also increased by nearly seventy percent. The combination of the top-grade first-rank Flying Snow Sword and the seventy percent power boost from the "Gale Sword Technique" resulted in this astonishing strike!

"Hiss!!!"

Faced with this attack, the towering blood-spotted sea serpent sensed the lethal threat. It twisted its body frantically, trying to evade the Flying Snow Sword's edge. But having just broken free from the black-robed elder's ice-binding spell, its movements were still sluggish. Moreover, the sword was simply too fast—there was no time to dodge.

"Shick!"

A sound like a hot knife slicing through butter rang out.

The blood-spotted sea serpent, over sixty feet long and roughly ten feet in diameter, was beheaded with a single stroke from Chen Daoxuan.

Witnessing this, the black-robed elder was stunned for a moment before bursting into elation. Having recovered a breath of his dantian's true qi, he immediately cast the ice-binding spell again, freezing the serpent's headless, thrashing corpse.

Half a cup of tea later, as the last traces of the serpent's life force were extinguished by the chilling power of the ice-binding spell, the sea finally fell silent.

"Is it dead?" the weakest cultivator, at the second level of Qi Refinement, asked cautiously.

"It's dead," Chen Xianhe nodded, then turned to look at Chen Daoxuan, whose face was pale, his expression a mix of emotions.

"Wonderful! It's finally dead!"

"Dead at last!"

"Haha, we did it!"

"..."

In the air, aside from the cultivator whose cargo ship had been destroyed—who wore a sullen expression—the others were all celebrating heartily.

After all, slaying the blood-spotted sea serpent not only meant their cargo ships were safe but also promised an unexpected windfall.

As a late-stage first-rank demonic beast, the serpent was a treasure trove. Beyond its most valuable parts—the demon core and venom sac—its flesh could be consumed, its fangs crafted into special magical artifacts, and its hide tailored into form-fitting defensive armor.

The reason their earlier concentrated attacks had barely harmed the serpent was largely due to its tough hide, which accounted for at least eighty percent of its resilience. Though the hide had suffered significant damage during the battle, it could still be used to make several sets of armor.

After moving the serpent's corpse onto his ship, the black-robed elder invited everyone aboard.

Knowing it was time to divide the spoils, they all perked up.

The elder's cargo ship was three times the size of the Chen family's Canglong, with far more intricate formation patterns etched into its hull. No wonder he had been so protective of it, the others thought.

"Everyone," the black-robed elder began, unaware of their musings. Normally reticent, he now looked flushed with satisfaction over their haul. "According to the Qian Yuan Sword Sect's rules for dividing spoils, the one who delivers the killing blow takes the lion's share—sixty percent. The primary supporter gets thirty percent, and the remaining ten percent is split equally among the five of you. Any objections?"

He scanned the group, his gaze finally settling on Chen Daoxuan. His question was directed less at the others and more at the young man, for in this world of cultivation, strength commanded respect.

After exchanging glances, the others shook their heads. "We defer to your judgment, Elder."

"This division is fair."

"..."

Seeing no dissent, the black-robed elder took out one hundred spirit stones from his storage pouch, distributing twenty to each of the five—Chen Xianhe and the others.

"The serpent's corpse is roughly worth a thousand spirit stones. Your share of ten percent amounts to twenty stones each. Please verify the count." He clasped his hands in courtesy.

Apart from the cultivator who had lost his ship, the others—especially the one at the second level of Qi Refinement—were beaming. Twenty spirit stones were a considerable windfall for a wandering cultivator at his level.

After storing their shares, the group bid the elder farewell one by one.

Once they had all left, the black-robed elder turned to Chen Daoxuan. "Young friend, we meet again."

"It seems fate has brought us together once more," Chen Daoxuan replied with a smile, pretending not to notice how the elder had upgraded his address from "young friend" to "fellow Daoist."

The elder chuckled. "To be honest, I have a favor to ask."

"Please, go ahead."

"I'd like to exchange spirit stones for the serpent's demon core and venom sac. Would you agree?"

After a moment's thought, Chen Daoxuan nodded. "That's acceptable. However, I don't want spirit stones. Do you still have any of the Water Spirit Pearls you sold me earlier?"

The elder had anticipated this. Though Chen Daoxuan's strength was formidable, his cultivation was only at the third level of Qi Refinement. For him, Water Spirit Pearls, which accelerated cultivation, were far more appealing than other resources. For the elder, however, they were nearly useless—at the ninth level of Qi Refinement, only a breakthrough to Foundation Establishment would benefit him, making cultivation-boosting treasures irrelevant.

"Here are five Water Spirit Pearls, valued at five hundred spirit stones. For the remaining hundred, how about I give you the serpent's meat?" The elder produced five marble-sized pearls.

"Agreed," Chen Daoxuan said.

With the division settled, they proceeded to process the serpent's remains. As cultivators, they worked swiftly with their magical artifacts. In the time it took an incense stick to burn, the serpent had been skinned and butchered.

The meat and five Water Spirit Pearls went to Chen Daoxuan, while the hide, fangs, venom sac, and demon core were claimed by the black-robed elder.
