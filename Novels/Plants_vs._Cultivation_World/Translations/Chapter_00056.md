# Chapter 56: The Divine Wine Spirit Tempering Method

"Elder Zhao, this disciple wishes to exchange for Water Spirit Rice!"

As Gu Mo left, Mai Yunfa took out his outer sect disciple token, preparing to use his sect contribution points to exchange for the Water Spirit Rice. This grade of spirit rice would be snapped up the moment it appeared, so if Mai Yunfa wanted to obtain it, now was his only chance.

"Very well."

Zhao Qiancheng nodded. After all, Mai Yunfa was somewhat related to him, and Zhao had no qualms about showing him some favor.

After leaving the Spiritual Plant Hall, Gu Mo headed for the market district.

His purpose this time was simple—to exchange a portion of his Water Spirit Rice for spirit stones. In truth, even if he sold this grade of spirit rice to the sect, the price wouldn't be lower than what he could get in the market. 

But Gu Mo had previously promised Shopkeeper Gou from the wine store that he would sell him high-grade spiritual plants. He couldn't go back on his word now. Moreover, as Gu Mo's only external connection, Gou Youyu served as his window to information outside the sect—a connection he wasn't willing to discard lightly.

"Young Brother Gu Mo!"

Gu Mo's appearance sent Gou Youyu into a state of excitement. Not seeing Gu Mo for an entire year had filled Gou with worry that this hard-won channel for spirit rice might be severed. But with Gu Mo's return, his anxious heart could finally settle.

"Shopkeeper Gou, do you have enough spirit stones on hand?" Gu Mo asked with a smile. Now a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator himself, Gu Mo faced Gou Youyu—also at mid-stage Qi Refining—with much more ease. Though Gou was at the sixth layer of Qi Refining, Gu Mo's physique and spiritual power, six times that of his peers, made him more than a match.

Gu Mo's direct question about whether he had enough spirit stones gave Gou pause, but then realization dawned, and his face lit up with excitement.

Last time, Gu Mo had hinted that the important figure behind him planned to cultivate high-grade spiritual plants. Now Gu Mo was asking about his funds—the implication couldn't be clearer.

"To be honest with you, brother, after decades of business here, I've accumulated some wealth," Gou Youyu declared confidently. He believed he could easily handle a hundred or so catties of mid-grade spiritual plants. As for more than that, he didn't think Gu Mo could provide it anyway.

"Good!"

Reassured by Gou's financial stability, Gu Mo immediately produced fifty catties of Water Spirit Rice. The remainder, aside from his own consumption, he had promised to give a few catties to Chu Feifei.

"About fifty catties, give or take."

At the sight of the bag Gu Mo produced, Gou instantly estimated its weight—just about a hundred catties, as he'd expected.

He reached out to open the bag, eager to see what spiritual plant lay within.

As the bag opened, a surge of rich spiritual energy washed over Gou Youyu, carrying with it a unique spiritual quality.

"Water spiritual energy!"

With years of experience in the market district, Gou's discernment was sharp. He immediately recognized the nature of this special energy, and his expression grew solemn as he realized the contents must be extraordinary.

"Water Spirit Rice!"

When Gou's eyes fell upon the crystalline grains within the bag, even his prepared mind was stunned.

He never imagined Gu Mo would produce top-grade Water Spirit Rice. For a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator like himself, this rice was absolutely ideal for cultivation advancement—especially since Gou's elemental affinity leaned toward water, though not enough to qualify as a Water Spirit Root.

This didn't diminish the rice's enhancing effects on him; in fact, they would be greater than with other spiritual foods of the same grade. Moreover, as a brewer, he could ferment this rice into top-grade spirit wine, maximizing its potential.

Top-grade spirit wine—this quality could give Gou the confidence to attempt a breakthrough to late-stage Qi Refining.

"Young Brother Gu Mo, I spoke too boldly earlier. I don't have enough spirit stones for all this Water Spirit Rice." Struggling to calm his surging emotions, Gou wore a bitter expression. His current liquid assets simply couldn't cover fifty catties.

Gu Mo had indeed brought about a hundred catties of spirit rice, but who could have guessed it would be first-grade top-quality Water Spirit Rice? In the market district, this was the kind of treasure that had price but no market. Common spirit rice like Jade Dew Rice might occasionally appear as old stock from the Green Dew Sect, but Water Spirit Rice of this grade never made it outside.

Under these circumstances, the fact that the important figure behind Gu Mo could produce fifty catties of Water Spirit Rice elevated that person's status several notches in Gou's estimation. Only inner sect disciples could likely manage such a feat.

Of course, Gou's immediate concern wasn't this, but how to secure these fifty catties. If he missed out on them due to insufficient funds, he feared it might even create a demon in his heart.

"What?"

Hearing Gou lacked sufficient funds left Gu Mo momentarily stunned. The market price for Water Spirit Rice was thirty spirit stones per catty—fifty catties would be fifteen hundred. Surely a man who could operate a wine shop in the market district could muster fifteen hundred spirit stones?

Here Gu Mo was mistaken. While the nominal market price was thirty spirit stones per catty, Water Spirit Rice simply wasn't available in the market, making its actual value far exceed that price.

If Gou truly bought Gu Mo's rice at thirty spirit stones per catty, he'd be failing at basic human decency.

"Young Brother Gu Mo, might we barter instead?" Gou seemed to reach a decision and ventured the question.

"What would Shopkeeper Gou offer in exchange?" Gu Mo was open to barter, provided the goods were useful to him.

"I possess a soul cultivation method. Would you exchange it for this Water Spirit Rice?" Gou produced a manual.

"A soul cultivation method!"

Gu Mo's eyes widened. Techniques for cultivating the soul were exceedingly rare—aside from that evil Soul Refining Art he'd obtained long ago. What Gou offered clearly wasn't some malevolent technique.

"Indeed. This is the Divine Wine Spirit Tempering Method, which I obtained from an ancient cultivator's cave. It requires spirit wine for cultivation." Gou explained the method's particulars and frankly expressed his desire to collaborate with the important figure behind Gu Mo.

The Divine Wine Spirit Tempering Method needed spirit wine. Gu Mo would supply high-grade spirit rice, while Gou would brew the wine. Both could then use the wine to practice the method.

This was a win-win scenario. Moreover, Gou held a trump card—the special spirit wine recipe tailored for this method, known only to him.

While other spirit wines could be used with the method, their effects paled in comparison to the matched recipe.

Faced with such a mutually beneficial arrangement, Gu Mo had no reason to refuse. His spiritual power and physique already far surpassed his peers, but his soul strength was merely average. With the Divine Wine Spirit Tempering Method, he could complete his transformation into an all-around powerhouse.
