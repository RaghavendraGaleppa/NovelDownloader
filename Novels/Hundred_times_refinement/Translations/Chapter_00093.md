# Chapter 43: Narrow Roads for Enemies

After completing his preparations, Lin Xuan entered deep meditation to restore his spiritual energy. For cultivators, sitting in meditation for three hours was a common practice.

During this time, several groups of cultivators passed through the valley. None of them had good intentions—each coveted the treasures Lin Xuan carried. However, the invisibility talisman he used contained a high-level spell, making it difficult even for Foundation Establishment cultivators to detect him, let alone these lesser practitioners.

Confusion spread among them. They had clearly seen the young man enter the valley, yet he had vanished without a trace. Some stubbornly searched the area and even resorted to tracking spells, but their efforts yielded nothing. Frustrated, they eventually left.

Three hours later, a strange white mist began to rise in the empty valley. At first, it was scattered, but gradually, it coalesced before dissipating once more, revealing Lin Xuan's figure.

His expression was unreadable as he stood and surveyed his surroundings. The other cultivators were gone. Though he had successfully shaken off those with ill intentions, he had expended a high-level invisibility talisman in the process.

Nevertheless, his trip to the Lingyun Sect had been fruitful. Not only had he acquired the Spirit Control Technique, but he had also obtained the *Lingyun Manual*. 

Even among low-level cultivation techniques for the Qi Refining stage, there were vast differences in quality. The techniques he had learned in the Piaoyun Valley were mediocre, which explained why—despite his abundant spiritual herbs and diligent practice—he had struggled to break through to the fifth layer. The *Lingyun Manual*, however, was a rare gem. With it, his cultivation speed would undoubtedly improve significantly.

Additionally, he had procured two water-attribute spirit stones and 108 talismans. Though they were all low-level, their sheer number made them valuable. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would find it difficult to defend against such an overwhelming barrage.

While he had spent a considerable amount of pills, it was a negligible loss for Lin Xuan. With his purification ability, he could simply refine more pills from discarded ones in a few days of hard work.

After organizing the items in his storage bracelet, Lin Xuan ate some rations and resumed his journey.

This time, no one followed him. Without delay, he headed straight back to the Piaoyun Valley. 

As dusk approached, he stopped in a small forest. The area was desolate for miles around, meaning he would have to spend the night in the wilderness.

He caught a wild rabbit and was halfway through roasting it when his expression suddenly shifted. With a wave of his sleeve, a cold wind extinguished the fire. He then covered the traces of his cooking with dirt and branches, making it appear as though no one had been there.

Lin Xuan tapped the ground lightly with his toes, activating the Wind Riding Technique to effortlessly leap over ten meters into the air. He landed on the thick branches of a towering tree, concealing himself among the leaves. He remained perfectly still, suppressing his aura, slowing his heartbeat and pulse until he resembled nothing more than a dead branch.

This was the Wood Attribute Concealment Technique.

No sooner had he hidden himself than a yellow light descended into the forest. As the glow faded, two figures emerged.

Lin Xuan remained expressionless, but inwardly, he was startled. Though he was a low-ranking disciple of the Piaoyun Valley, his four years there had sharpened his discernment. 

The yellow light wasn’t from a spiritual artifact—it was a rare Flying Talisman, a high-level talisman akin to the Invisibility Talisman. Those who possessed such treasures were no ordinary cultivators.

"Father, let’s rest here for tonight."

"Hmm."

Lin Xuan froze. That voice was familiar. After a moment’s thought, he recognized it—the young noble from a cultivation family who had competed with him for the intermediate-level technique. If he recalled correctly, the family name was Yan.

*Are they here to hunt me down?* His heart raced, but he quickly calmed himself and analyzed the situation. No, he had used the Invisibility Talisman to shake off all pursuers. Besides, if they had wanted to act, they wouldn’t have waited until now.

They couldn’t have known he was returning to the Piaoyun Valley, so it was unlikely they had deliberately followed this path. The most plausible explanation was sheer coincidence—they had simply crossed paths.

Once he understood, Lin Xuan cursed his rotten luck while meticulously suppressing his presence, not daring to move a muscle.

*Just leave quickly!* He silently prayed to the heavens, hoping the two had urgent business and would only stop briefly to eat before moving on.

But fate had other plans. The pair intended to spend the night here. They lit a fire and began roasting their provisions.

"Father, do you think our ambush of the Wang family’s disciples will be discovered?"

Yan Ming’s voice was uneasy. Beside him sat a man in his fifties, whose expression darkened at the question. After a long pause, he replied coldly, "Hmph, if you hadn’t failed to secure that intermediate-level technique, I wouldn’t have had to take such a risk."

"Father, that wasn’t my fault," Yan Ming protested. "Who would’ve guessed that rogue cultivator had hundreds of pills, even rare mid-grade ones?"

"Are you telling the truth?"

"Father, how could I lie to you? Many cultivators witnessed it."

The elder fell silent. The matter was indeed perplexing. Two hundred low-grade pills were one thing, but mid-grade pills? Even sects like the Piaoyun Valley, the Dao Talisman Mountain, or the Fire Spirit Sect wouldn’t be so extravagant. And yet, a rogue cultivator had them…

As the patriarch of the Yan family, Yan Tianheng was well-traveled and knowledgeable, but this situation left him utterly baffled.

"Enough. There’s no point dwelling on it. We’ve already killed those Wang family juniors and taken their intermediate-level technique and other treasures." A smug smile crept onto Yan Tianheng’s face. "It’s their own fault for being in seclusion at such a critical moment, leaving only their juniors to attend the event. As for being discovered, don’t worry, Ming’er. I’ve already disposed of the evidence."
