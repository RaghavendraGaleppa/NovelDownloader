# Chapter 99: Dragon Elephant Fruit, A Great Opportunity!

Before Gu Yuan could react, a streak of golden light flashed into his dantian in an instant.

"Whoosh!"

Without any conscious effort from Gu Yuan, his mana surged uncontrollably toward the golden seal, desperately attempting to refine it.

Everything fell into place effortlessly.

The golden seal possessed its own mystical properties. By dripping blood onto it and reciting the incantation, Gu Yuan had already claimed it as his own. Unless he died, no one could take it from him.

A refreshing energy circulated through his body, and Gu Yuan felt an indescribable sensation. Though the world before him remained unchanged, it now appeared clearer in his eyes. A profound, almost ineffable sense of enlightenment seemed to wash over him.

Closing his eyes to inspect himself internally, Gu Yuan realized that the seals he had previously crafted were crude, their inscribed patterns lacking refinement. If given another chance, he could succeed in a single attempt even without the Shadow Wall Stone.

What difficulty could a mere Qi Refinement-level seal pose to him now?

"Three Minds, One Thought—Pierce Delusion, Attain Clarity!"

"With this golden seal, from this day forth, I, Gu Yuan, shall stand among the ranks of geniuses..."

Feeling the seal's peculiar power continuously enhancing his innate talents, Gu Yuan couldn't help but open his eyes, revealing a look of delight.

Innate aptitude and comprehension were the most crucial assets on the path of cultivation. Though he had previously bridged the gap in talent through abundant resources, progressing swiftly in his cultivation, the later stages demanded ever-greater comprehension. Those lacking in natural talent would find themselves at a standstill.

But now, today, he had successfully altered his fate!

"Though I didn't obtain any powerful techniques, this body seal is more precious than a thousand spells. The Three Methods Sect likely left this golden seal behind to nurture future generations, ensuring an unbroken lineage of prodigies. Yet in the end, it has fallen into my hands..."

Gu Yuan marveled at the golden seal in his dantian, his joy growing with each passing moment. Only after taking several deep breaths did he manage to suppress his excitement.

Then, he shifted his gaze to the storage pouch on the stone table.

Gu Yuan knew this pouch couldn't compare in value to the golden seal. However, the Three Methods Daoist had been a peak Foundation Establishment expert at the time of his death. His final legacy was certainly no ordinary treasure.

Extending his spiritual sense, Gu Yuan effortlessly refined the storage pouch.

Inside, the items were few—only seven jade slips, two or three jade boxes, and a letter covered in small characters. There were no magical artifacts or spirit stones.

The handwriting on the letter was elegant and unrestrained, brimming with a free-spirited aura.

"Kid, I've sold off all my treasures to bolster my strength for an ambush on Shao Xiayang. The pouch contains only seven secret techniques—four for Qi Refinement and three for Foundation Establishment. These were the foundation of my dominance in the Eastern Mountain Domain. Since you've obtained the Three Minds Seal, you'll surely master them. Rejoice in your fortune!"

"However, I've made countless enemies in my lifetime and ambushed many cultivators. Heh, if these techniques are recognized, you'd best be cautious!"

"Additionally, there are a few rare spiritual materials of mysterious origin. Consider them a gift."

"The Three Methods Sect has fallen, but its legacy should not fade into silence. If you die, ensure the Three Minds Seal finds a worthy successor..."

"Alas, without reaching the Golden Core, how can the sect be restored?"

"Written by Zhong Gaohan, an unworthy disciple of the Three Methods Sect."

The final words were the Three Methods Daoist's last testament, filled with regret.

Gu Yuan sighed softly before briefly skimming through the jade slips. Then, he turned his attention to the three jade boxes.

The jade slips contained methods for crafting seals. Even with the Three Minds Seal, Gu Yuan couldn't instantly create them without the necessary spiritual materials. Since they wouldn't immediately enhance his combat prowess, he decided to examine the materials first.

The first jade box held a peculiar jade grass adorned with golden speckles, resembling scattered stars. Yet Gu Yuan couldn't identify its origin.

The second box contained a translucent, agate-like fruit. Within its crystalline form, two faint shadows seemed to flow, emitting a soft glow.

"This is..."

A thought struck Gu Yuan—he felt he had seen this fruit somewhere before.

"Oooh! Oooh!"

Before he could recall, his spirit beast pouch trembled violently. A small figure inside hammered against the pouch, desperate to emerge.

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan loosened the pouch.

"Oooh! Oooh!"

Instantly, a tiny, ice-blue miniature elephant burst forth, landing joyfully on the jade fruit and devouring it with loud, voracious bites.

"This is... Dragon Elephant Fruit!"

Watching the Star Spirit's ravenous excitement, Gu Yuan immediately recognized it.

Dragon Elephant Fruit—a rare treasure that could accelerate the growth of the Frost Rhino Dragon Elephant Star Spirit.

He had searched for this fruit and Frost Soul Jade for years, but both seemed exceedingly rare. Having found no trace of them, he had nearly given up. Yet here it was, appearing before him today.

"Chomp! Chomp!"

By now, the Star Spirit was feasting with delight. In the blink of an eye, it had devoured the fruit, which was larger than its own body.

Then, as if drunk, its tiny body swayed unsteadily before collapsing into the jade box.

Loud snores followed as it fell into a deep slumber. Yet its small form radiated an eerie glow, gradually expanding, and the patterns on its body grew increasingly luminous.

"Excellent! At this rate, it'll take only half a day to fully digest. By then..."

Gu Yuan gently stroked the Star Spirit's belly, sensing its absorption rate, and smiled with satisfaction.

After carefully storing it back in the spirit beast pouch, he opened the final jade box.

Inside was neither Dragon Elephant Fruit nor the Frost Soul Jade he had hoped for, but a single emerald-green seed.

The seed shimmered with a radiant halo, exuding an otherworldly beauty.

Unfamiliar with it, Gu Yuan stored it away for later examination.

Sitting cross-legged, he fell into contemplation.

He had avoided Bian Chuyao and come to this cliff alone not only to claim the Three Minds Seal but for another crucial reason.

He intended to use the Stone Liquid in this secluded place.

Within the Dao Academy, he had used the Stone Liquid multiple times but found no significant opportunities—it seemed he had exhausted its potential. Only in secret realms like this could he hope for rare treasures.

"The Three Methods Daoist's legacy is already immensely valuable. Even if no further opportunities arise, it's no loss."

"But since I'm here, I might as well check."

"Should I seek Foundation Establishment spiritual energy or secret technique golden seals?"

At present, these were the two things weighing on Gu Yuan's mind, both aligned with his current needs. They were the most critical for enhancing his strength.

Yet in an instant, he made his decision.

"Foundation Establishment spiritual energy is paramount to me, but without comprehending the corresponding methods, even if it appeared before me, I couldn't perceive or collect it. It would be useless. Seeking secret technique golden seals is far more practical. Given the battles fought here, many techniques must have been scattered. If any hidden golden seals remain, I'd strike it rich..."

With this thought, Gu Yuan wasted no time. He dripped the Stone Liquid and turned his gaze toward Mount Yunlan.

The starry river inverted, and all things became visible as points and lines of light before his eyes.

Countless white dots flickered across the spiritual mountain, interspersed with many green ones as well.

But Gu Yuan's eyes locked onto the very center.

Within the ancient, secluded valley, a silver dot tinged with gold blazed brilliantly, reflecting in his pupils.

Silver with hints of gold—this was an opportunity comparable to the one in the Demon Star Stone Cave!

A chance to alter destiny itself!

What kind of place was the Central Mountain Secret Ruins, to harbor such bountiful opportunities?

Gu Yuan's heart pounded wildly. Without hesitation, he rose and rushed toward Bian Chuyao's location.

"Junior Sister Bian, I'm coming! Let's head to the Yunlan Valley at once!"
