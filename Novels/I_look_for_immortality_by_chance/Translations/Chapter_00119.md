# Chapter 119: Bifeng Peak and Spiritual Energy Allocation  

"Elder Huo!"  

Gu Yuan bowed respectfully.  

The elderly man seated to the left of the chessboard was none other than Elder Huo, who had presided over the Flowing Clouds Banquet. He had previously arranged with Gu Yuan to meet at Guyue Peak once Gu Yuan successfully achieved Foundation Establishment. Initially, Gu Yuan hadn’t planned to come so soon, but the top-grade Primordial Yang Jade had been of immense help to him. Moreover, shortly after his breakthrough, he received a secret message from Elder Huo, prompting him to immediately fly here on his escape light.  

"Junior Brother Gu, there’s no need for such formality. Now that you’ve successfully established your foundation, we are equals—you may simply address me as senior brother!"  

Elder Huo laughed heartily, speaking to Gu Yuan in a warm tone.  

"Understood, Senior Brother Huo!"  

Gu Yuan didn’t stand on ceremony and promptly adjusted his address.  

Wasn’t the pursuit of the Great Dao all about standing above the masses and sitting as equals with the most formidable geniuses?  

"Come, come, don’t just stand there—take a seat!"  

After exchanging pleasantries, Elder Huo waved his sleeve, causing the chessboard before them to vanish, replaced by a white jade tea set and an additional white jade meditation cushion.  

"Many thanks, Senior Brother Huo!"  

Gu Yuan expressed his gratitude before gracefully taking his seat.  

Perhaps due to his elevated cultivation or their close proximity, Gu Yuan now noticed something entirely different about Elder Huo.  

Faint golden light flickered intermittently along Elder Huo’s hair and skin, carrying an indestructible aura that was dazzling and awe-inspiring.  

Yet, beneath this golden radiance, an unmistakable sense of exhaustion and aging permeated Elder Huo’s body. The two forces intertwined, creating an ambiguous state between life and death that was difficult to articulate.  

Beside Elder Huo sat another elder, clad in a white Daoist robe embroidered with a yin-yang symbol on the chest. His features were stern, and his hair and brows were snow-white.  

This elder was also at the late Foundation Establishment stage, though no golden light emanated from him. However, his aura of aging and weariness was even more pronounced than Elder Huo’s, with deeper wrinkles lining his face.  

"Junior Brother Gu, allow me to introduce you. This is Senior Brother Lu Guan, the Peak Master of Biluo Peak."  

Noticing Gu Yuan’s gaze lingering on them, Elder Huo understood but chose not to comment, instead introducing the elder beside him.  

"So it’s Senior Brother Lu!"  

Gu Yuan smiled and bowed in greeting.  

"Merely a decrepit old man, unlike Junior Brother Gu, who is full of vigor and youthful vitality!"  

Elder Lu Guan sighed deeply as he took in Gu Yuan’s exuberant energy and youthful appearance, returning the courtesy.  

"You flatter me, Senior Brother."  

Gu Yuan chuckled lightly before taking a sip of tea and falling silent.  

Had Elder Huo been alone, Gu Yuan might not have discerned his intentions. But with the Peak Master of Biluo Peak present, he immediately understood the urgency behind this meeting.  

Biluo Peak had left the Flowing Clouds Banquet empty-handed, failing to secure even a single strand of spiritual energy.  

However, as the orchestrator of the event, Gu Yuan was in no rush.  

Noticing his composure, the two elders exchanged glances before Elder Lu Guan of Biluo Peak spoke again.  

"Junior Brother Gu, you are astute, so I won’t mince words. Today’s meeting wasn’t initiated by Senior Brother Huo but by me—I have a request to make of you."  

"Spiritual energy only arises within secret realms and treasured lands. It is exceedingly rare, a truly top-tier resource. Even after centuries of cultivation, obtaining it is no easy feat. That is why I’ve come to seek your assistance."  

"I’m aware that my disciples have shown you disrespect in the past—this is a grave failing on Biluo Peak’s part. But today, with Senior Brother Huo as our mediator, I hope to resolve this misunderstanding."  

With that, Elder Lu Guan bowed slightly before producing a lengthy list of gifts from his sleeve.  

"Junior Brother, having just ascended to Foundation Establishment, you must have many pressing needs. Though I’m unsure what exactly you require, anything on this list that Biluo Peak possesses is yours to choose from."  

The list was extensive, detailing an array of rare treasures, Foundation Establishment elixirs, and other invaluable items—truly a dazzling assortment.  

A single glance was enough to stir even Gu Yuan’s typically unshakable composure.  

It wasn’t that Gu Yuan lacked restraint—it was simply that the offer was too generous to ignore.  

"Three Revolutions Azure Cloud Pill—consumption grants a Foundation Establishment cultivator thirty years’ worth of cultivation in one go, a supreme-grade elixir…"  

"Nine Flames True Fire Shield—an early-stage Foundation Establishment spiritual artifact capable of unleashing nine streams of true fire, capable of slaying Foundation Establishment cultivators with immense destructive power."  

"Hundred Mists Illusory Light Spirit Water—a high-grade spirit water for refining divine sense during the Foundation Establishment stage. Consumption imbues divine sense with illusory properties, rendering it impervious to all techniques unless the opponent’s divine sense far surpasses one’s own."  

"…"  

Perhaps aware that Gu Yuan, having broken through to Foundation Establishment, would no longer be tempted by Qi Refinement treasures, Elder Lu Guan had come personally to negotiate, appealing to his interests.  

Gu Yuan’s gaze swept across the list, scrutinizing each item carefully before finally settling on the last entry.  

"Golden Bamboo Sword—an early-stage Foundation Establishment spiritual sword forged from five-hundred-year-old Golden Yi Spirit Bamboo, inscribed with sword Dao seals. Can be refined into the body, capable of severing spirits and cutting through metal with unparalleled sharpness. As the sword is crafted from spirit bamboo, it can be upgraded by obtaining thousand-year or three-thousand-year Golden Yi Spirit Bamboo."  

After Foundation Establishment, sword Dao seals were no longer mere seals.  

All sword seals required a vessel—a spiritual sword.  

By imprinting the sword seal onto the spiritual sword and refining it into the body, every sword strike would embody both the sword’s sharpness and the technique’s profundity, merging blade and art into one.  

Sword light could transform endlessly, wielding unimaginable power.  

Having established a Three Methods Foundation and possessing the Golden Rainbow Sword Base, Gu Yuan was naturally suited for the path of a sword cultivator, mastering sword techniques with ease. His sword light would be swift as a rainbow and radiant as the sun.  

This Golden Bamboo Sword perfectly suited his needs.  

Yet, after a brief pause on the sword’s description, his gaze shifted away.  

"A single strand of spiritual energy can create a Foundation Establishment cultivator—a great cultivator with a lifespan of four hundred and fifty years. How could I sleep soundly with such a threat looming over me?"  

Gu Yuan sighed softly and shook his head.  

Though the treasures were tempting, he couldn’t afford to cultivate a Foundation Establishment enemy for himself.  

With a lifespan of four hundred and fifty years, who could predict what might happen in the future?  

His spiritual energy was meant to nurture his own faction.  

Releasing a single strand would mean creating a living Foundation Establishment cultivator—one who could bring him immense benefits.  

Hearing this, Elder Huo and Elder Lu Guan exchanged knowing smiles.  

"Junior Brother, since I’ve invited you here today, I naturally have no intention of making an enemy of you."  

"Fifty years!"  

"If you’re willing to share a strand of spiritual energy, I can guarantee that the Foundation Establishment cultivator who receives it will obey your commands for fifty years, deferring to you in all matters. Should a true disciple conflict arise, they will never oppose you and will instead withdraw respectfully."  

"Moreover, all Qi Refinement disciples under Biluo Peak will heed your orders, ready to campaign in the Scarlet Water Great River on your behalf!"  

Elder Lu Guan’s expression turned solemn as he made this solemn pledge.  

Scarlet Water Great River?  

Gu Yuan’s expression sharpened.
