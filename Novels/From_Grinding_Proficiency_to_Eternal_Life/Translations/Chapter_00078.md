# Chapter 78: Half-Collapsed Divine Weapon Ridge

The moment the system notification sounded, a ringing buzz erupted in Xu Yunfan’s ears, followed by a series of crisp cracks echoing through his bones.

A scorching torrent of blood energy exploded from his flesh, surging through his four limbs and washing over his entire body. His spine crackled segment by segment like firecrackers. A tremor erupted from his tailbone, shooting up his lumbar vertebrae and rushing toward the crown of his head. The Great Dragon of his spine actually revealed a jade-like luster beneath his skin.

*Chime—*

The twelve pairs of ribs trembled simultaneously, and a sound like the clashing of metal and iron rang out from his chest cavity. The outline of his bones undulated beneath his skin like swimming dragons, with jade-like textures appearing and disappearing under the moonlight. If one were to peel open his skin right now, they would see his entire skeleton radiating a warm, ivory-like glow, yet exuding the cold, hard质感 of cold iron.

"Success!"

Xu Yunfan’s eyes snapped open, a sharp glint flashing deep within his pupils. His heaving chest suddenly sank, and a white mist spewing from between his teeth condensed into a three-foot-long arrow of air. It tore through the void with a sound like ripping silk, shattering a celadon cup on a stone table a *zhang* away.

Before the shards could hit the ground, blood-colored steam erupted from every pore of his body.

He glanced at the skill information appearing in his vision.

**[Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Tempering Chapter 0/5000 (Great Perfection)]**

**[Special Effects: Bones as Hard as Iron, Trembling Bone Penetrating Force, Hard Bone Deflection, Iron Bone Clang, Bone Force Penetration]**

Immediately after, a massive influx of memories regarding the cultivation of the Iron Bridge Suppressing Pass: Bone Tempering Chapter flooded his mind.

In these memories, it seemed as if bone-tempering secret medicines were applied to his body, swallowed by his mouth, and soaked in barrels as if they cost nothing. The process went on from morning to night without pause.

Tides of memories regarding bone tempering poured into his Sea of Consciousness.

He saw himself soaking in boiling medicinal soup, dark red liquid seeping into cracked skin; his throat swallowing bitter pills, his stomach burning as if swallowing burning charcoal; his ten fingers gripping玄 iron sand to grind against his bones, with sparks flying and mixed fragments of flesh and blood...

Third-Rank Martial Master realm!

Flesh, muscle, skin, and bone have all reached Great Perfection. By now, he could be considered to have cultivated the human body to an extreme level. To take another step forward would be to temper flesh, blood, and marrow, continuously digging into the human body's potential and broadening his own treasure trove.

This is why those geniuses pursue the perfect level of flesh, muscle, and skin.

"Brother Xu!"

A clear voice came from the threshold.

Xu Yunfan, bare-chested and radiating intense heat, turned around to look at Su Shiyu, who stood at the threshold with a bundle on her back, still dressed as a man.

Su Shiyu’s black tight-fitting clothes were damp with night dew, but she stopped dead in her tracks the moment she met his deep, profound eyes. The courtyard was filled with rising heat waves. Xu Yunfan’s knotted back muscles, like red-hot branding irons, caused sweat to bead at her temples.

As his blood energy churned, the muscles around his body writhed like living pythons, actually bulging into ridged patterns on the surface of his skin, forcing her to stop at the doorway.

Su Shiyu looked at Xu Yunfan’s muscular body, and the muscles that were bulging and充血 due to the churning of his blood energy, her face flushing slightly.

"Brother Xu, thank you for taking care of me these past few days. I found a merchant caravan heading to Yujing a few days ago and will set off this afternoon."

Xu Yunfan nodded. "In that case, I wish Brother Su a smooth journey and success in avenging your仇!"

Hearing Xu Yunfan call her "Brother Su," a rare smile appeared on Su Shiyu's face. She said loudly, "I will practice martial arts seriously from now on to avenge my father's death. Brother Xu, let's meet again in the Jianghu!"

Watching Su Shiyu’s back as she walked away without looking back, disappearing into the dim light, Xu Yunfan slowly retracted his gaze.

It was time for him to prepare for his journey as well.

Since Su Shiyu had left and Liu Tianyun had returned to Beiye, Xu Yunfan had no intention of lingering. Now that his flesh, muscle, and bone had reached Great Perfection, the rest was just a matter of grinding, constantly accumulating proficiency to bring his flesh, muscle, and bone to a state of perfection.

Even if he practiced tirelessly without a moment's relaxation, with the support of the [Lin Character Mantra], it would still take him a small half-year. At the very least, for the [Red Refining Copper Body: Cloak Hammer] technique, he had already walked nearly sixty percent of the path to true perfection.

"External Three Unions..."

When Xu Yunfan exerted force through his flesh, muscle, and bone, the air within three inches of his body even seemed to buzz and vibrate. Yet he always felt that the integration of the Three Postures wasn't quite perfect.

Only now did he finally understand why there is a realm of External Three Unions.

After packing his belongings, Xu Yunfan’s five fingers brushed over the cowhide lining. Twelve hidden pockets were arranged like a chessboard. The remaining ten thousand or so taels of silver notes, which he had used up, were folded into thin slices and hidden in the lining of his collar and the secret compartment of his sash.

He wrapped the Extreme Path Remnant Skin around his body like a vest. This skin was impervious to blades and could even withstand Divine Weapons, its defensive capabilities not to be underestimated.

The gilded mace case felt cold to the touch. The iron case locks were firm when咬合. The two-hundred-plus catty瓮金锤 pressed on his shoulder, actually cracking the blue bricks beneath his feet into a spiderweb pattern.

He went to the stable, paid the boarding fee, and led out the red horse that had accompanied him on his travels. Standing at 1.9 meters tall, Xu Yunfan was only level with the horse's neck. This horse contained a trace of Flood Dragon horse bloodline, possessing extreme endurance and load-bearing capacity. He had spent nearly a thousand taels of silver to buy it back then.

Man and horse charged out of the North Gate of Changyi.

The city gate guards were about to shout a reprimand, but they were forced back three steps by the intense, scorching blood energy rushing at them.

"Third-Rank Martial Master!"

The guard officer quickly stopped a guard who wanted to level a spear. Watching the figure riding away, his expression turned grave.

"Who knows which family's expert that is. Better to avoid trouble."

Seven days later, twilight like blood, Divine Weapon Ridge.

Xu Yunfan reined in his horse on the cliff, and the scene before him made his pupils contract sharply.

The thirty-zhang-high Suppressing Mountain Stele was snapped in half, and the cross-section of the rock still glowed with a glassy luster. The entire ridge stretching for dozens of *li* ahead seemed to have been split open by a god's giant axe. The eastern peak had turned to dust, and the remaining western mountain body was densely插满 with hundreds of broken blades.

*Hum—*

The gilded mace suddenly trembled on its own, and a dragon-and-tiger roar erupted from the case.

Xu Yunfan quickly reached out to press the iron case, preventing this Divine Weapon from vibrating.

Xu Yunfan dismounted. The moment his boots touched the ground, they sank three inches. The soil and stone here had actually been crushed into fine sand by Gang Qi. He bent down and picked up half of a rusted sword blade. The hilt was made of excellent material; when intact, it was definitely a sharp weapon.

"What a formidable sword."

He looked at the sword mark on the mountain wall that贯穿 for a hundred *zhang*. The outline was as clear as if carved, and as smooth as a mirror.

The lowest凹陷处 was coagulated with紫黑 blood scabs. Even years of wind and rain could not erode them. It was likely that the expert holding the Divine Weapon in Divine Weapon Ridge back then had met his end here.

He finally felt the despair Lu Yihe expressed when he was drunk in Beiye City, saying that Divine Weapon Ridge had been smashed and collapsed.

Thirty years ago, a supreme Grandmaster of Qi Refining, carrying a top-tier Divine Weapon, crossed the sea and arrived. One sword severed the mountain, one sword斩人.

With just two swords, he broke the spine of Divine Weapon Ridge, which was at its peak in Yanbei Dao, and severed its lineage.

Looking up, he could see several huge blast furnaces in the mountains still belching smoke, forging iron with urgent intensity.

There were still people in Divine Weapon Ridge, but only a handful remained.

Xu Yunfan hesitated for a moment, but ultimately still led his horse down the mountain, approaching the foot of Divine Weapon Ridge.

At the foot of Divine Weapon Ridge, Xu Yunfan looked up at the three characters "Divine Weapon Valley" written above and immediately fell silent. Just as he was about to turn and leave, a slightly aged voice sounded from behind him.

"这位兄台, are you here to seek a weapon?"
