# Chapter 136: Night of Chaos! The Fall of Gods and Arhats!

Night had fallen.

The stars and moon were hidden, the sky a pitch-black curtain. Dark clouds loomed, bringing rain and flashes of lightning.

Outside Mount Yanguan, the atmosphere appeared calm, but the auras of human immortals, divine beings, and arhats—transcendent figures—were already clashing, stirring the heavens. Thunder rumbled, and heavy rain fell, sending chills down the spines of onlookers.

"The Great Zhou garrison is making a move."

The voice of the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official emerged from the Parasol Wood Box.

At the same time, a brilliant light erupted from where the six loose immortal ancestors stood, surging toward the imperial army's position.

A tense silence fell, the atmosphere growing heavy in an instant.

Soon, a voice echoed from that direction.

"Disciples of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, why are you assaulting our formation?"

It was the voice of Yuanjin, the Divine General, cold and sharp as he bellowed, "Those who dare trespass shall die!"

"Who dares harm my Feather Transformation disciples?"

At that moment, the Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect soared into the sky. Though he did not yet know the full truth, he had to protect his sect's disciples—he could not stand by while they were slaughtered without cause.

Previously, the sect might have negotiated with the imperial court regarding the old soldier's fate, reaching a compromise that satisfied all parties.

But tonight, chaos erupted without warning!

"Bai Zishu disguised himself as a Feather Transformation disciple and charged the military formation," the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official murmured. "It's not a sophisticated ploy. If both sides had remained calm and investigated, they would have realized something was amiss with that disciple. But..."

Li Zhengjing chuckled. "Unfortunately, Yuanjin the Divine General is also under the Golden Ship of Salvation. He wants nothing more than to escalate this conflict—he won't let it end peacefully."

Sure enough, as soon as the Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect arrived, Yuanjin the Divine General wasted no time in attacking!

The battle erupted instantly, sending shockwaves through the battlefield.

Meanwhile, the six loose immortal ancestors unleashed their might.

"The sole survivor from Mount Yanguan's secret realm holds the key to what lies within. Does the Great Zhou court intend to monopolize this heaven-sent opportunity?"

"We loose cultivators come from humble origins, relying only on ourselves for every step forward. The treasures within Mount Yanguan could change our fates—how can we allow the Great Zhou Dynasty to swallow it all?"

"Opportunities bestowed by heaven belong to those destined to claim them!"

Three of the human immortals among the loose cultivators roared, inciting the crowd.

But then, a voice rang out from the Great Zhou army—the voice of a divine being, one of the six great deities of the Southern Domain, a founding general of the Great Zhou: the Divine Venerable Taiyue.

"Mount Yanguan is Great Zhou territory, and all of you are its subjects. The situation within the secret realm remains unclear. The sole survivor, Guan Sheng, is a soldier who narrowly escaped death. It is only right that the court questions him!"

"If there truly is an opportunity within, and a way to explore it, the court will allocate slots, granting you all a chance!"

"This matter can be discussed later. Stirring chaos now is premature!"

The Great Zhou court had clearly anticipated tonight's unrest and prepared a scripted response.

But whether this speech could persuade the thousands of loose cultivators present was irrelevant—what mattered was that the six human immortals were the ones guiding them.

As long as these six refused to submit, the Great Zhou Dynasty could not pacify the crowd!

And what these six sought was not eligibility for the loose cultivators—it was the opportunity they desired for themselves.

Just as the situation seemed to stabilize slightly, multiple human immortals soared into the sky from the Great Zhou military formation.

The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, the Luofu Immortal Sect, the Kunlun Immortal Sect, the Vajra Temple, the Cloud-Sky Temple, the Profound Sun Sword Sect, the Purple Mist Dao Sect—all had joined the fray!

The six human immortals wasted no more words and plunged straight into battle.

Amid the chaos, Zhang Quan, a disciple of the Venerable Jingxu, raised his voice.

"Our six ancestors fight for our sake, seeking opportunities for us loose cultivators. How can we stand idly by?"

"Though we cannot intervene in the battle of immortals and gods, we cannot watch as the imperial army forms ranks to slaughter our ancestors!"

"Let us break their formation and carve a path for ourselves!"

Among the thousands of loose cultivators, some were straightforward and righteous, while others sought to exploit the chaos. Under Zhang Quan's guidance, a portion of them charged the military formation.

The formation wavered under the assault, and Yuanjin the Divine General's aura faltered. Struck by the Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, he plummeted from the sky and crashed into the mountains.

But the scattered formation quickly regained its footing, counterattacking the loose cultivators. The flames of war spread—drawing ever closer.

Now, no one could remain uninvolved!

Li Zhengjing scanned the battlefield and spotted a commander leading troops toward them—none other than the Ghost Valley Spiritual Official's disciple, the Guide of the Golden Ship of Salvation.

At this moment, the Guide was charging with his troops!

Most of the loose cultivators who remained here were the more cautious ones, unwilling to provoke conflict with the Great Zhou court. But with soldiers bearing down on them, they had no choice but to fight back!

"The Golden Ship of Salvation is truly a master of stirring chaos," the Wall-Climbing Bird couldn't help but remark.

"Split up and act separately," Li Zhengjing said. "Stay safe—don't throw your lives away."

"Understood." The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official emerged from the Parasol Wood Box, gripping the Luofu Banner of Heaven Summoning, and headed toward where Yuanjin the Divine General had fallen.

"I'll handle the corpse collection!" The Five Elements Creation Tree crawled out, bringing along the Wave-Severing Gu and the Wall-Climbing Bird, hiding at the fringes.

"Kuojian, come play dead with us!" the Wall-Climbing Bird called out.

But before Kuojian could join them, a little girl climbed out of the Parasol Wood Box. Smiling, she skipped over to the Five Elements Creation Tree, lay down, stuck out her tongue, and feigned a ghastly death.

"I'll scout ahead for opportunities," Li Zhengjing said, slinging the Parasol Wood Box onto his back and heading toward the heart of the battle.

The Ghost Valley Spiritual Official was a cunning old fox, and with the Luofu Banner of Heaven Summoning in hand, he was unlikely to perish unless facing a sect leader-level opponent.

As for the others, with the Dragon Girl present, they were safe. The Wall-Climbing Bird wielded the Dragon Pillar of the Hall, and the Five Elements Creation Tree had the Mirror of Profound Insight—both could protect themselves.

Li Zhengjing skirted the imperial troops, approaching the battlefield when a golden light flashed—a radiance of Buddha's light!

"Arhat Jingchen?"

Li Zhengjing remembered this arhat from their encounter in Hongshan Town, where he had fled after being injured.

He hadn't expected the arhat to recover so quickly—and his aura and strength had grown even stronger!

Now, Arhat Jingchen fought with terrifying ferocity. His indomitable golden body repelled two divine generals of the court and forced back a human immortal of the Luofu Immortal Sect. He landed directly within the military formation!

"Compassion of the Buddha!"

With a single chant, Arhat Jingchen unleashed a wave of Buddha's light, hurling the surrounding elite soldiers away.

He did not kill, sparing their lives.

With a wave of his hand, the prison cage shattered, and he seized the old soldier, Guan Sheng.

Human immortals and divine beings closed in, but Arhat Jingchen lifted Guan Sheng and vanished in an instant.

The speed of this arhat's growth surpassed even Li Zhengjing's expectations!

At this moment, though Arhat Jingchen had not yet reached the level of a sect leader, he was no weaker than the Flame God King had been!

His overwhelming strength shocked not only Li Zhengjing but also the human immortals, divine beings, and other powerful figures present.

But just as Arhat Jingchen seemed poised to escape with Guan Sheng, the seemingly frail old soldier's eyes blazed with sudden intensity. His hands pressed against the arhat's chest and abdomen.

The indestructible golden body dimmed in an instant!

Arhat Jingchen was sent flying, blood spraying from his mouth, his face a mask of disbelief.

Everyone was stunned. Upon closer inspection, the old soldier who had survived Mount Yanguan was an imposter!

"Divine General Fangyin, weren't you stationed at Jiangshang Prefecture, keeping watch on Li Zhengjing?"

"Li Zhengjing has already left Jiangshang Prefecture. Naturally, I came here to assist."

Divine General Fangyin tore away his tattered disguise and faced the crowd. "I knew you wouldn't stay idle—you were bound to come for him. I've been waiting..."

He raised his hand, and a spear flew into his grip. Together with the other divine generals of the court, he advanced.

"You're not Guan Sheng! Then where is he?"

Shock and fury rippled through the crowd, but the battle raged on.

Hidden in the shadows, Li Zhengjing saw that the old soldier was a fake and felt a pang of disappointment. He retreated.

Amid the clash of human immortals, divine beings, and arhats, he could have seized the chance to slay a transcendent figure. But he chose not to act, instead circling the battlefield to infiltrate the camps of the various factions.

For some, this battle had been long anticipated.

For others, it had erupted suddenly, the situation deteriorating too rapidly to avoid chaos.

Thus, when they departed, some treasures might have been left behind in their camps.

But as Li Zhengjing crept closer, he realized he wasn't the only one with this idea.

"Are these thieves also from the Golden Ship of Salvation?" he mused, impressed. "They're just as clever as I am."

Among the thousands of loose cultivators, some were bold enough to sneak into the camps of the major factions, risking everything for potential gains.

But at that moment, a sword light shot up from the Kunlun Immortal Sect's camp, sweeping through the tents in an instant.

Blood sprayed, and bodies thudded to the ground.

The Young Master of Kunlun had struck—with a single sword stroke, he had slain twenty or thirty opportunistic loose cultivators.

"Come out," the Young Master said coolly.

"Here I am."

Li Zhengjing stepped out of the shadows, glancing at the corpses with a sigh.

Loose cultivators had no sect resources to rely on—every step of their cultivation was hard-won. Often, they had to risk their lives for a sliver of opportunity.

Those who had infiltrated the camps knew the risks. Death was always a possibility.

"Follow me."

The Young Master of Kunlun approached, his gaze fixed to the left. "I knew the old soldier in the cage wasn't the real one, so I didn't join the battle."

He continued, "The Golden Ship of Salvation is fanning the flames, and the Great Xuan Dynasty is eager to see chaos. Though we had already reached an agreement with the Great Zhou army, tonight's upheaval was inevitable."

Li Zhengjing followed his gaze. "You think the real Guan Sheng is being held in that direction?"

"After the battle began, chaos spread everywhere—except there. That's what makes it suspicious."

The Young Master of Kunlun added, "If I could deduce this, so could others."

With that, he transformed into a streak of sword light, shooting toward the left.

Li Zhengjing followed, understanding the Young Master's goal.

The Kunlun heir wanted to enter Mount Yanguan, and the old soldier who had survived its depths was the guide he needed.

Thirty li passed in moments.

But Li Zhengjing caught the scent of blood.

The Young Master of Kunlun's expression darkened as he descended to the mountain path.

Li Zhengjing landed beside him, surveying the scene ahead. "This doesn't look like the aftermath of a battle between human immortals."

The Young Master said grimly, "But a human immortal has fallen here."

They exchanged a glance and pressed forward.

What they found was a field of carnage—not a single intact corpse.

Shattered armor, broken blades, blood, and gore—the stench was overwhelming.

At least a thousand elite soldiers had died here.

The Young Master picked up a command token. "This belongs to Divine General Feiwei of the Great Zhou army."

Li Zhengjing's gaze fell on a kneeling figure. "A senior monk from the Vajra Temple?"

The Young Master stepped closer. "The Abbot of the Third Meditation Hall."

The monk knelt, his golden body dull, a gaping hole in his back—his organs ripped out.

"Brutal," Li Zhengjing muttered. "What do you make of this?"

The Young Master pondered. "Even if they came to seize the old soldier, and the fighting turned vicious, it shouldn't have ended like this. This looks more like... raw, overwhelming physical force—trampling and tearing through them."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "None of the dead here were killed by spells or divine weapons. It's as if they were shredded by claws or fangs."

The prison cage that should have held Guan Sheng lay in ruins.

Beyond it, the scene was hellish.

"No sign of the old soldier. He wasn't killed here—he was taken," the Young Master said. "We should leave. If others discover this, it'll be hard to explain."

Li Zhengjing agreed, casting one last glance at the shattered cage.

Then both vanished in streaks of light.

Moments later, human immortals from the Luofu Immortal Sect, the Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Sect, and divine generals of the court arrived.

They stared at the carnage in silence.

"What happened here?"

"Where is the old soldier?"

"Who could have done this? Divine General Feiwei torn in half, the Abbot of the Third Meditation Hall gutted..."

A chill settled over them as the mountain wind howled, carrying an eerie dread.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing and the Young Master of Kunlun headed toward Mount Yanguan's secret realm.

After a pause, Li Zhengjing spoke.

"The cage was broken from the inside."
