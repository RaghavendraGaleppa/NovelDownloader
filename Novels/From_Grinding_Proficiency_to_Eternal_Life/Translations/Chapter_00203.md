Chapter 203: Let Them Come If They Dare

The ninth slash struck the hammer handle, and Xu Yunfan's profound steel body suddenly emitted a sound like a great bell or tripod roaring.

"Your strength seems to have weakened considerably."

Tuoba Lie's eyes widened in fury, the corners even tearing open as he let out a heart-wrenching howl from his throat.

"You bastard, this general..."

Before he could finish, the rebound force surged back along the Red Python Strength. The surface of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer seemed to transform into a living python writhing, with arcs of lightning flickering around it.

The protective vital energy condensed from Tuoba Lie's true blood was swept by the python's tail, instantly blasting a bowl-sized hole in his chest.

The hammer shadows transformed into a crimson meteor, striking upward.

When the first hammer struck the axe face, all the shattered stones within a fifty-meter radius floated into the air.

When the second hammer smashed into Tuoba Lie's gauntlet, the fine steel armor crumpled like thin paper.

As the third hammer, shrouded in the phantom of a red python, thundered toward his chest, the蛮汉's true blood suddenly surged with activity. The flesh around the bowl-sized wound writhed frantically, attempting to regenerate.

"Roar!"

The roaring Tuoba Lie bled from every pore, his knotted muscles swelling once more. Fragments of iron armor shot out like locusts, embedding deeply into the surrounding rock walls.

"Break for me!"

The Xuanhua巨斧 swung out in a full moon arc. Before the axe edge even arrived, the rock ground beneath Xu Yunfan's feet had already cracked open into a meter-wide fissure.

His expression was cold and stern, his sword-like brows raised, his muscles bulging as they strained against his armor. The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength circulated wildly through his flesh and blood, while the Hundred-Refined Profound Steel Body emitted a hissing sound like forging iron quenched in water.

The Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique, Earth Dragon's Turn, met the blow with thunder and fire.

The moment the two forces of vital energy collided, the grass, trees, earth, and stones within a hundred meters churned like waves, leaving一片狼藉 (a scene of devastation).

Yet, Xu Yunfan's feet sank into the rock layer up to his knees, the profound steel war boots grinding against the stone and sending up great sparks.

The iron chains on Tuoba Lie's axe handle snapped one by one, and the chain fragments, shrouded in blood mist, shot toward Xu Yunfan's face like venomous snakes.

Xu Yunfan's neck suddenly revealed patterns of a coiling red python, and he spat out a scorching arrow of qi.

The blood-colored chains ignited upon contact with the fire. Amidst the foul, burning smoke, Xu Yunfan spun the heavy hammer in his hand.

When the profound steel hammer head thrust in from under his arm, Tuoba Lie's true blood emitted a sound akin to a mournful cry.

The instant Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and spun his body, the Red Python Strength poured through the hammer handle and into the enemy's body. The bones beneath his knotted muscles emitted a crisp sound like ice cracking.

The蛮汉 opened his mouth to roar, but what spewed out was burning blood flame.

"You make so much noise while fighting."

Xu Yunfan's five fingers clamped onto the axe back, the profound steel finger guards grinding against the tungsten steel axe face to produce dazzling sparks.

When the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength erupted for the third time, a whirlwind of烈焰 suddenly swept within a thirty-meter radius.

Tuoba Lie tried to mobilize his last reserves of true blood, only to find his heart had been entangled by the Red Python's qi. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer had already heavily pressed against his chest.

When the Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique descended, the entire cliff trembled.

The hammer shadows transformed into nine layers of mountain phantoms, stacking upon one another. The first hammer shattered the muscles, the second hammer broke the arm bones, and when the seventh hammer smashed onto his天灵盖 (crown of the head), Tuoba Lie's swollen body suddenly stiffened, and spiderweb-like cracks appeared on his skin.

The last of his true blood gushed from his seven orifices, but turned to ash the moment it touched the hammer wind.

As Xu Yunfan withdrew his hammer, the残躯 of the kneeling蛮汉 exploded violently. Amidst the rain of blood, only the Xuanhua巨斧 remained deeply embedded in the ground, its handle still trembling.

The red python patterns slowly receded back into his spine. Xu Yunfan wiped the bloodstain from the corner of his mouth. The burns on his profound steel skin were healing at a visible rate, as his Pure Yang Internal Qi continuously transformed and rapidly restored his depleted strength.

Tuoba Lie, whose body had been destroyed by more than half, was not yet dead. He let out a strange laugh.

"You're dead. The forces behind you will also die because you killed me. My name is... Tuoba Lie."

He roared with all his might: "I am the third son of the Tuoba family of Great Qian, the Tiger Marquis Tuoba Lie!!"

Thud!

The heavy hammer fell again, shattering Tuoba Lie's head into碎骨. Confirming that the enemy was truly dead, Xu Yunfan slowly gripped the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, pulled it back, and looked up at the terrified Great Qian Luo网军 soldiers.

He glanced at the interface, where more than a dozen notifications had popped up. During his life-and-death struggle with Tuoba Lie, the proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique had increased by a full eight points.

Xu Yunfan said nothing. He pushed off with the balls of his feet, like a tiger leaping from its lair, and pounced forward.

After a few breaths, after hammering the last Great Qian soldier to death and shaking the flesh fragments from his hammer head, Fu Jin limped over.

His expression was grave. "Now, both Qingzhou and Cangzhou have Great Qian troops patrolling. The only path to survival is to head for Yanbei Prefecture, specifically the provincial capital, Yanbei City."

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look at the group of women and children not far away, who were still in shock. He tore off the shattered armor on his body and shook his head. "Senior Brother, human strength is limited. This is not something we can save. In this world, those who are too kind-hearted die first."

Fu Jin's lips moved slightly; he understood in his heart that what Xu Yunfan said was true.

He turned back to look at the women and children whose eyes were filled with hope, and his heart suddenly tightened.

Soon, Fu Jin's hesitant gaze turned firm as he looked at Xu Yunfan.

"Junior Brother, this is the path I have chosen to practice. If I do not escort these commoners to Yanbei City, I will never be at peace for the rest of my life."

He raised his head. "We set out with eighteen martial brothers, and now only eight remain. If we give up halfway, the sacrifices of those righteous brothers would be in vain."

Xu Yunfan tore off the last piece of残甲 hanging from his chest, the shattered profound iron pieces scraping against his collarbone with a grating sound. He casually threw the dark red armor into the mud, staring at the bloodstains mixed in the mire.

"The lives of eighteen men were spent to cover a mere thirty miles of road."

A sudden surge of blood rushed to Xu Yunfan's throat, making his voice deeper. "Senior Brother, you should calculate clearly how many more thirty-mile stretches are needed to reach Yanbei City. That Tuoba Lie's status in the Great Qian army was definitely not low. Now that he has been killed by me, Great Qian will inevitably seek revenge. The people on this road won't make it."

With a clang, the scar-faced man with the chain spear suddenly snapped the arrow in his hand.

The half of a travel permit pierced by the arrowhead unfolded in the wind; it was the unsent letter from the young master of the horse gang who had died in battle last night.

"He Lao Liu used to often say..."

He插ed the broken, bloodied arrow into his hair. "A ragtag bunch of wild foxes like us, forming a ragged path, yet wanting to live like a greedy wolf swallowing the moon. His blade twisted through three ribs just to carve out a way to live for me."

The scar-faced man turned his head to look at the commoners with their bitter expressions.

"I must fulfill his final wish."

The wandering martial artists beside him echoed his sentiment. Though each was exhausted to the bone, without exception, they gripped their weapons tightly.

Xu Yunfan remained silent. He looked deeply at Fu Jin.

"Senior Brother, I cannot help you with this matter."

Fu Jin reached out and patted his shoulder.

"You shouldn't have come. The Heavenly Work Cave should not be implicated. Great Qian's army has recruited many experts. Once they find out you killed Tuoba Lie, they will definitely retaliate."

A hint of a smile appeared on Xu Yunfan's face. "Then let them come. On that point, I do not fear them at all."
