## Chapter 145: From the Abyss to the Clouds

The Black Roc, its entire body seemingly forged from black gold, stood atop a massive mountain, gazing down at the plains under the night sky. It was recuperating, emitting astonishing energy fluctuations.

"Third Brother, you're truly ruthless, directly luring demons into our territory?!" The Black Roc grumbled, relieved that it had recovered quickly enough to defend itself. Otherwise, powerful outsiders might have challenged it.

The Old Donkey hastily explained, "Big Brother, I was scared. He's refining Fourth Brother's silver blood; he's bound to advance further."

The Fire-Scaled Lion, even more imposing than an elephant, its crimson scales glowing, was also healing. Its entire body was enveloped in firelight, and it occasionally let out low roars. Any other Outer Saint would have died if their forehead bone was pierced. Though it was in immense pain and had briefly gone mad, it was gradually recovering, and the blood hole on its forehead was slowly mending. Within its body, a small amount of strange True Blood glowed, its lineage traceable to the Fire Kirin, a top-tier species from the deepest parts of the Night Mist World.

The Black Roc declared, "Since you've already summoned demons, then issue a hunt order in my name. Invite more comrades to surround and annihilate him. He must not be allowed to leave the Divine Remnant Plains!"

"Understood!" The Old Donkey immediately nodded.

Under the night sky, on the Divine Remnant Plains, beast roars echoed one after another. Large numbers of fierce birds spread their wings, tearing through the thick night mist, circling above the dense forests. After the hunt order was issued, within the territories ruled by the four ancient monsters, monsters ran rampant. Powerful anomalous beings were everywhere, including a small group of humans.

The silver light shrouding Qin Ming's body was fully absorbed by him. The rich medicinal fragrance permeated his form as his seventh rebirth began! He clearly felt the changes: scabs formed over his wounds, broken bones reconnected, his entire body grew hot, and his flesh seemed to be purifying. Auspicious mists swirled around him, and his essence, qi, and spirit became increasingly vibrant.

Within his five organs and six viscera, auspicious mists billowed and rosy clouds glowed, immortal mist permeated, and a vigorous vitality emerged, as if early spring had arrived and all things were flourishing. His broken bones reconnected and grew at the fastest speed. At this rate, his bones would fully mend even before his rebirth was complete.

Without the fragrant silver heart, Qin Ming's situation was much better than before. He circulated the Blending Light with Dust technique, merging into the dense forest under the night. He had stood still for a quarter of an hour.

But the tranquility was eventually broken. This territory had too many demons and monsters, and a creature soon discovered him. It was a sheep, black as ink, ten meters tall. Its physique was even more massive than that Fire-Scaled Lion's. Its two horns looked rough and not particularly sharp. However, Qin Ming keenly sensed danger.

Indeed, this black sheep was very special. It didn't unleash demonic qi; its pure physical strength was devastating. It charged forward, knocking down large trees. Qin Ming suspected this black sheep had practiced an Iron Shirt technique; a layer of black light surrounded its body, making it indestructible and incredibly ferocious.

He was currently undergoing his rebirth, his bones had just reconnected, and he did not want to confront any powerful creatures, fearing his mended bones might dislocate again. He turned and fled.

*Boom!*

A huge boulder blocking the path on the plains was shattered by a single kick from the black sheep. Where its rough horns passed, towering ancient trees disintegrated in swaths, as if it intended to pierce the heavens.

"I am Yang Dingtian. I heard you possess a silver heart; I've come to take it. Hand it over, and I shall spare you," it boomed.

"I ate it!" Qin Ming replied.

Yang Dingtian pursued him, saying, "Refining you will be the same; the medicinal effects are still present for a short time."

*Plop!* Qin Ming leaped into a large river. However, after swimming only a few miles, he was forced ashore by a ten-meter-long fish in the water.

Soon after, a mountain ape appeared, also a giant, standing fifteen meters tall. Even without considering its Heavenly Radiance Force, its inherent racial divine power was more than any ordinary Outer Saint could handle. Qin Ming made a mental note of this mountain ape!

He was being chased by the mountain ape, its colossal feet stomping down repeatedly, nearly grazing Qin Ming's body several times. The ground cracked, trees snapped. The mountain ape wielded a bone blade, ground from the ribs of a giant beast, and when it hacked down, the earth truly shook and mountains swayed. Qin Ming didn't want to fight; he needed to ensure his bones fully healed. Finally, he leaped into a large lake.

Soon, he grimaced as he rushed to the opposite bank of the lake. The lake actually contained a large number of electric eels, though thankfully their cultivation was not too profound. Qin Ming spent the entire day on the run.

Late into the night, he finally settled down, enduring the stench as he hid inside the mouth of a giant crocodile. He had never imagined he would be reduced to such a miserable state just to survive. He had been chased by all sorts of colossal creatures, hidden in swamps, and smeared mud on himself to lie low, only to encounter Outer Saint-level crocodiles. This time, he could no longer bear it. He proactively charged into the giant crocodile's mouth, using his Heavenly Radiance Force to erupt internally, obliterating its vitality, but leaving no external injuries.

Qin Ming lay inside the crocodile's mouth, finally able to relax his entire body. "The Six Imperial Ancestral Court's assessment for core disciples..." he murmured softly. This time, the elder had divided the assessment areas based on their strength. He was in the Rebirth Realm and ultimately encountered terrifying ancient monsters like the Black Roc, Fire-Scaled Lion, and Yang Dingtian, whose strength far surpassed ordinary Outer Saints. If he were to step into the Outer Saint realm, would this assessment place him in an area guarded by Spirit Domain Realm creatures, forcing him to confront beings of the third major realm?

That night, Qin Ming slept soundly, and astonishing changes occurred in his body. On his skin, golden needles threaded through, mending him; silver mud, like a potent medicine, covered his entire body. All of Qin Ming's injured areas, including his broken bones, made faint sounds. After being "mended" and then nourished by the potent medicine, they rapidly healed.

The next day, he woke up early, feeling full of energy and in unprecedentedly good spirits! Aside from the poor environment of the crocodile's mouth, he had no complaints. All his injuries were healed, his strength had increased, his five senses were acute, his Heavenly Radiance Force was denser, and his spiritual awareness and divine wisdom had accumulated even more.

"At this rate, my seventh rebirth will be complete in just over half a day!"

Now Qin Ming felt very confident. His broken bones had finally healed, and it no longer affected his ability to fight! He emerged from the giant crocodile's mouth and washed himself many times in a clear pool. In truth, with his Heavenly Radiance Force protecting him, he hadn't actually picked up any foul smell. Qin Ming roasted an electric eel and ate some wild fruits, a cold gleam in his eyes. He was already contemplating revenge; yesterday had been truly miserable. Thinking of those ancient monsters, he suspected the Fire-Scaled Lion possessed special "Wondrous Blood," which might further strengthen his foundation.

Overnight, the demons' enthusiasm for chasing him had waned, as they believed he had already fully absorbed the medicinal properties of the silver blood and was no longer of much value. At noon, when the night's influence was weakest, a thick fog blanketed the Divine Remnant Plains. Qin Ming felt cheerful; his seventh rebirth was completely finished. He instinctively realized that his foundation had once again slightly surpassed its limit! However, even though he had successively obtained two types of "Wondrous Blood" and deepened his foundation, it wasn't as exaggerated as he had imagined; it had only slightly broken the limit.

"It seems that the foundation of having fifteen hundred jin of strength in both arms during the first rebirth is very difficult to surpass." This was because even previous ancestral figures seemed not to have reached it. After seven rebirths, Qin Ming's body surpassed the limit of ten thousand five hundred jin, but it was still less than eleven thousand jin. Of course, this was just his intuition, a rough estimate.

"To break the limit and strengthen my foundation, I need to find more Wondrous Blood!" Qin Ming realized that the Divine Remnant Plains seemed somewhat special; creatures with unique bloodlines were not very rare. At the very least, he had already found three such creatures! Besides the significant increase in physical fitness and power, the wondrous light within his flesh became even more concentrated. Furthermore, a golden glow appeared beside it, like sunlight shattering and mixing with mist. This was a new ability he gained from his seventh rebirth!

Qin Ming took a deep breath, calming himself. His strength had not finished improving; to be precise, the true qualitative change had only just begun! He glanced at the vast plains covered in trees and said, "What a good place, perfect for practicing the Verdant Wood Scripture!"

He sat cross-legged and circulated the cultivation method. Instantly, a fresh aura flowed through the area, the plants rustled, and a faint green essence flowed towards him. Qin Ming had long since cultivated the Verdant Wood Force, and now he began to consume "Enlightenment Fruits" to enhance this force. Within the Enlightenment Fruits, the rich extraterrestrial light was almost liquid. As it entered his mouth, it was incredibly vibrant, and it vigorously surged within his body. An ordinary person simply couldn't withstand it; their flesh would be cooked through.

But Qin Ming could endure it. As he ate one Enlightenment Fruit after another, his Verdant Wood Force continuously improved. By the end, his entire body was covered in green light. What was more, the forest resonated with him, providing him with vitality. This truly was a miraculous cultivation method; through it, one could extend their lifespan and elevate the essence of their life! Green mist swirled, light fog permeated, and dense vitality converged upon Qin Ming. The entire forest rustled, as if conversing and communicating with Qin Ming.

Ultimately, Qin Ming's skin became as white as jade, and his hair turned emerald green, each strand crystalline, as if he had transformed into a mountain spirit. He used the Enlightenment Fruits and resonated with the forest, cultivating the Verdant Wood Scripture to a profound level, reaching the current limit of his body.

"The Verdant Wood Scripture not only nourishes life, but its power is also immense!" Qin Ming's palm glowed green. With a light pat on the ground, *boom*, the surface shattered, and the force penetrated deep underground. He lightly waved his hand, and green Heavenly Radiance Force flowed, brushing against a nearby giant rock, causing it to crumble into dust. When he stopped circulating the Verdant Wood Scripture, his hair returned to its original dark black color.

Next, he began to practice the Wind-Thunder Force, a martial art from the Wind-Thunder Blade Manual he obtained from the weasel demon. He highly valued it, always wanting to master the power of lightning. Although it wasn't pure lightning, but accompanied by wind, Qin Ming was already very satisfied. This Wind-Thunder Blade Manual was suspected to be a supreme art of a major sect, and its force was equally astounding. Lightning light wrapped around Qin Ming's body, accompanied by wind force. With a light swing of his fist, the rolling sound of wind and thunder roared! Most crucially, its power was immense! Afterwards, he fused the Electrical Force, which originated from the Five Elements Palace. Though not a profound lightning cultivation method, it was still extraordinary.

Next, Qin Ming proceeded to enhance each of his Heavenly Radiance Forces: Lesser Yang Force, Wind-Fire Force, Metal Severing Force, Dragon Claw Force, Bright Light Force, and Jade Splendor Force. He wielded them with the Silk Scroll Method, fusing them all into one! Yesterday, he had faced a mortal tribulation, chased by all sorts of demons and monsters, as if he had fallen into an abyss. Now, after his seventh rebirth and the fusion of various forces, he had returned to the clouds. Qin Ming had merged nine types of force, so many at once, an unprecedented feat! Most of these were obtained from Mount Luofu Immortal when he helped Li Qingyue retrieve near-immortal artifacts.

In fact, he still had three types of Heavenly Radiance Force that he hadn't yet improved or fused, primarily because all the Enlightenment Fruits were gone. Meng Xinghai had prepared many bags of Enlightenment Fruits for him, yet even those were used up, mainly because the forces he cultivated this time were all very powerful, consuming an enormous amount. Moreover, Qin Ming genuinely couldn't eat any more Enlightenment Fruits now. For the first time, he felt that he also had a limit, that he was temporarily "full." If he ate any more, he felt he would explode on the spot.

By now, he had merged four great wondrous arts, totaling twenty-seven types of Heavenly Radiance Force! When Qin Ming stood up, the unified Heavenly Radiance Force surged out from his body, clearly undergoing a qualitative change, becoming significantly stronger than before! This Heavenly Radiance Force was exceptionally brilliant, making him seem as if he was bathed in extraterrestrial light, cloaked in a layer of sacred battle armor, like a young deity emerging from the radiant sun. Every move exuded transcendence, and he also possessed a powerful aura.

"It's time to set off!" Qin Ming moved, clutching his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, and walked alone across the Divine Remnant Plains.
