**Chapter 52: The Cultivation Pot**  

**Talisman Peak**  

"Senior Brother Yao, this is a great opportunity! With your skills, you definitely have a chance to become the personal attendant of the sect master's direct disciple," a group of outer sect disciples excitedly urged Yao Shifeng.  

They had all witnessed Yao Shifeng's competence firsthand. Moreover, his achievement of reaching the second level of Qi Refinement within two years surpassed most outer sect disciples. Everyone believed he stood a strong chance.  

If Yao Shifeng could become the personal attendant of the sect master's direct disciple, they might even benefit from his success.  

"I'm still far from qualified," Yao Shifeng shook his head, though their words stirred ripples in his heart. If he wanted to break free from the constraints of being an outer sect disciple, becoming an attendant to an inner sect disciple—especially the sect master's direct disciple—was undoubtedly a viable path.  

Yet, a lingering sense of pride made him reluctant to serve another.  

However, what happened next struck a heavy blow to that pride—the sect master's direct disciple had sent him an invitation.  

Staring at the invitation in front of him, Yao Shifeng felt his hands trembling. All he had to do was accept, and he could shed his identity as an outer sect disciple and become the personal attendant of the sect master's direct disciple.  

But a deep doubt gnawed at him—why had the sect master's direct disciple extended this invitation to him? There were many in the sect stronger than him, and even outer sect disciples would jump at the chance to serve such a prestigious figure.  

"Junior Brother's abilities are limited, and I fear I would be unworthy of serving Senior Brother He," Yao Shifeng finally declined to the outer sect disciple who had delivered the invitation.  

As the words left his lips, Yao Shifeng felt his entire body quivering. He knew he was passing up a tremendous opportunity, but serving under someone else—even the sect master's direct disciple—was not what he wanted.  

His goal was to become an inner sect disciple through his own efforts. Even if the odds were slim, he was willing to fight for it.

**Gu Mo's Side**  

"Who's looking for me at this time?"  

Gu Mo, who had been studying the new discovery within the black mist portal, sensed the barrier around his spirit field being disturbed. He promptly exited the black mist space.  

Outside, he found an outer sect disciple waiting for him. Gu Mo was even more puzzled—he didn’t recognize the man and had never interacted with any outer sect disciples before.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, this is an invitation from Senior Brother He. He wishes for you to become his personal attendant," the outer sect disciple said, handing over the invitation.  

"Senior Brother He? Personal attendant?"  

Gu Mo accepted the invitation in confusion. After learning the details, he raised an eyebrow. This "Senior Brother He" was the sect master's newly accepted direct disciple. While it wasn’t unusual for such a figure to recruit attendants, why would he choose Gu Mo? They had never even met.  

Moreover, Gu Mo had no intention of becoming anyone's attendant. He politely declined the invitation.  

The outer sect disciple couldn’t hide his disappointment. This was an opportunity countless outer sect disciples dreamed of, yet Gu Mo had turned it down without hesitation.  

"How bizarre," Gu Mo muttered, scratching his head as he watched the outer sect disciple leave.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, it’s rare to see you leave your hideout."  

Just as Gu Mo was about to return to studying his new discovery, Yuan Niya appeared, sneaking around as usual to avoid being noticed.  

"Senior Sister Yuan, do you know anything about the sect master's new direct disciple?" Gu Mo asked, figuring that as an inner sect disciple, she might have more information.  

"Of course."  

Yuan Niya nodded. This junior brother, who had joined the sect a few months after her, was now a rising star. But Gu Mo shouldn’t have any connection with someone like that.  

"What?! He Shaogang invited you to be his attendant?!" Yuan Niya’s fur practically stood on end when she learned about the invitation.  

Gu Mo was her discovery first! She was counting on his perfected Cleaning Technique to help her become a true disciple. If He Shaogang snatched him away, she’d be furious.  

Thankfully, Gu Mo had refused. Yuan Niya sighed in relief. "Gu Mo, why don’t you become my attendant instead? I can give you plenty of cultivation resources," she offered, trying to secure him for herself.  

Gu Mo was too important to her now. Keeping him tied to her was the safest option. Besides, if he became her attendant, she wouldn’t have to sneak around anymore.  

"No!"  

Unlike his polite refusal to the sect master’s disciple, Gu Mo was blunt with Yuan Niya. She needed him, so he wasn’t afraid of offending her. Besides, as an inner sect disciple, she probably couldn’t beat him in a fight.  

"Hmph!"  

Yuan Niya snorted at his rejection, but as Gu Mo had guessed, she couldn’t do anything about it.  

After following Gu Mo into his hut, Yuan Niya eventually left his spirit field, trembling slightly. Watching her go, Gu Mo also felt uneasy. More and more people were gathering outside his valley—if anyone saw them together, he’d never be able to explain himself.

**The Cultivation Pot**  

Once he confirmed Yuan Niya was truly gone, Gu Mo returned to his hut to continue studying the new discovery inside the black mist portal.  

After days of using solar essence to disperse the mist, a section of the black fog had cleared, revealing a shelf. The shelf itself was unremarkable, but the pot placed on it immediately caught Gu Mo’s attention.  

When he focused on it, a translucent screen appeared above the pot with a single line of text: **Cultivation Pot**.  

"A cultivation pot? Is this for growing plants?" Gu Mo’s interest was piqued.  

He quickly left the black mist space, dug up a Sunflower from his spirit field, and transplanted it into the pot.  

The moment the Sunflower took root in the pot, the text on the screen changed. It now displayed the Sunflower’s attributes, and next to its grade, a small upward arrow appeared.  

Seeing this, Gu Mo realized he had found a way to upgrade his plants.  

However, the arrow was currently grayed out, meaning the conditions for the Sunflower’s advancement hadn’t been met. So, what did it need?  

Gu Mo’s first thought was solar essence. He immediately placed several portions into the pot. As the essence vanished, the base of the gray arrow turned faintly green.  

"Whew..."  

Gu Mo exhaled deeply in relief. If the Sunflower required rare spiritual materials to upgrade, he’d have been in trouble. But since it still needed solar essence, this was fantastic news.
