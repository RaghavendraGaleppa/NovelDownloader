# Chapter 8: Imperial Capital Arena

Zhou Tian himself probably didn't realize it, but the implication of his words right now was extremely firm, as if he had already made up his decision and was merely here to inform them, even though that wasn't his intention. The fragmented memories from his original body still somewhat influenced him. After all, the original owner had been noble from birth; even though he couldn't cultivate, everyone around him treated him with utmost reverence, capable of dictating life and death with a single word. These scattered memories subtly affected the current Zhou Tian.

Elder Li frowned slightly, displeased with Zhou Tian's tone. However, feeling the countless powerful divine sense fluctuations in the void, he secretly sighed, then smoothed his brow and asked Tian Ling, who was beside him: "Ling'er, what do you think?"

"I..." Tian Ling seemed lost in thought, somewhat distracted. Hearing Elder Li call her, she snapped back, her large eyes filled with a bewildered expression, making her look exceptionally cute.

"His Highness is asking if you'd like to go out and explore the Imperial City with him." Elder Li repeated Zhou Tian's intention, emphasizing the word "asking."

Zhou Tian paused for a moment, then quickly understood, shaking his head with a chuckle. "The older one gets, the more they value face," he thought, but he didn't dwell on it.

Tian Ling heard Elder Li's words, turned to look at Zhou Tian, and nodded softly, saying, "Okay, I'd also like to see the Imperial Capital of the Great Qin Empire."

"Then... very well, Your Highness, please take good care of Ling'er." Elder Li turned to Zhou Tian and said.

"Don't worry, Elder Li, Tian Ling won't be wronged. In this Imperial Capital, no one can ignore my Qin King's Manor!" Zhou Tian said indifferently.

"Then... farewell, Your Highness..." Elder Li sighed. Not just in the Imperial Capital, but throughout the entire Nine Provinces, no one dared to disregard the words "Qin King."

Zhou Tian and Tian Ling stood up and walked out. Stepping out the door, Zhou Tian called out to the air, "Someone!"

Instantly, a person dressed in grey servant attire appeared beside him, bowing low and whispering, "Young Master, what are your orders!"

"Prepare a carriage at the main gate. I'm going out." Zhou Tian said. He didn't want to walk; it was too tiring.

"Yes!" The grey-clothed servant responded and vanished on the spot.

"Let's go!" Zhou Tian said to Tian Ling.

"Mm." Tian Ling replied and walked by Zhou Tian's side.

On the way to the main gate, Zhou Tian asked Tian Ling beside him, "Where do you want to go?"

"I don't know. You grew up here, so it's up to you." Tian Ling's waist-length black hair swayed, her eyes sparkling. Zhou Tian could only see her profile, which was bathed in a layer of shimmering golden light under the sun.

"What do you usually like?" Zhou Tian asked. Since she didn't know where to go, he figured he'd find out what she liked to decide their destination.

"Usually... I don't really have anything I like... I suppose fighting counts." Tian Ling pondered for a moment before replying.

"Fighting!" Zhou Tian exclaimed in surprise, scanning the little girl up and down... "Hmm... her chest is still small... No, wait... I didn't expect this girl to be so wild at heart."

"What's wrong?" Feeling Zhou Tian's intense gaze, Tian Ling forced herself to ask, trying not to show her discomfort. In this world, strength was revered, so liking to fight wasn't strange, even for a girl.

"Nothing. Well, I think I know where we should go." Zhou Tian sifted through his fragmented memories and indeed found a good place. "You should like that place." Zhou Tian kept them in suspense, not explicitly stating it.

As they spoke, they arrived at the main gate of the Qin Manor, where a magnificent carriage was waiting. Two three-meter-tall, horse-like exotic beasts stood there, their bodies covered in blood-red scales, each the size of a palm. Upon closer inspection, profound runes were carved onto them. Their muscles were as robust as coiling dragons, and a single purple horn grew from their heads, occasionally sparking with thunderous electricity. From time to time, they snorted, red flames shooting from their nostrils.

They pulled a wine-red carriage, its body adorned with golden cloud patterns along the edges, and on its right side, a purple divine dragon was emblazoned.

"Please." Zhou Tian walked to the carriage and said to Tian Ling.

The carriage frame was a full two meters high. Tian Ling's body shimmered with azure runes as she stepped on air, as if ascending an invisible staircase, and boarded the carriage. Zhou Tian watched, filled with envy. How good it was to have cultivation! He glanced at the grey-clothed servant beside him, who was ready to help him up, then at the beautiful girl already in the carriage. He decisively said, "Come, Tian Ling, pull me up."

Tian Ling was momentarily stunned, then extended a jade-like hand, smooth as mutton fat jade. Zhou Tian didn't hesitate, grabbing it firmly. "Mmm... incredibly smooth... comfortable..." With a pull, Zhou Tian climbed aboard. Both of them, with unspoken understanding, didn't mention why Tian Ling, as a master of the Tri-Treasures Realm, hadn't simply conjured energy to lift him up.

"Let's go." Zhou Tian led Tian Ling by the hand into the carriage and said to the grey-clothed servant by the side of the carriage.

"Yes!" The grey-clothed servant boarded the carriage, took out a golden soft whip, and cracked it in the air with a crisp sound. The two exotic beasts pulling the carriage let out a long neigh.

The Qin King's Manor's red, dragon-emblazoned sandalwood gates slowly opened. The exotic beasts' hooves left fiery footprints on the azure stone bricks, but with a flash of azure runes on the bricks, the flames vanished, leaving no trace of burning. Although the Qin King's Manor didn't hold a special status like the Central Imperial City within the capital, its unique nature meant that there were few people nearby.

The interior of the carriage was much larger than it appeared, likely due to a spatial expansion array. There was even a large bed, and in the center, a small table with fruits and drinks in abundance. Although the carriage was moving, there was no sensation of bumping. The water in the glass cups on the table didn't even ripple.

"To the Imperial Capital Arena!"

"Yes!" The grey-clothed servant's low voice came from outside.

"What kind of place is the Imperial Capital Arena?" Tian Ling asked, a little curious.

"The Imperial Capital Arena is a meat grinder, secretly controlled by the Imperial Family. As long as you can survive battle after battle, the rewards are astonishingly high. It's also a place where many people of humble origins can soar to prominence, because many nobles from the capital frequently recruit talents, guards, and even Imperial Family members make appearances there."
