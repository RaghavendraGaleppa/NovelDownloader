# Chapter 10: The Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer

Time passed,不知过了多久, perhaps days turning into years. The iron hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand went from being unbearably heavy to feeling perfectly natural and at home in his grasp.

One day, as dawn broke and the first rays of light had yet to fully illuminate the earth, Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, adjusting his state to its peak. Immediately after, he raised the hammer high with both hands, his muscles tensing, blue veins bulging like winding snakes coiling along his arms.

With a furious roar, the hammer, whistling through the air, slammed down viciously upon the human-sized ore block before him.

*Clang!*

A thunderous crash echoed as the ore split apart on cue, fragments flying everywhere.

Yet Xu Yunfan did not pause for a moment. His figure spun swiftly, the motion of swinging the hammer flowing seamlessly, like an tireless machine. Each swing was accompanied by a violent surge of Qi and Blood within him. The abundant Qi and Blood, like a galloping river, continuously supplied power to his body, keeping his arms filled with explosive strength.

At this moment, the Copper Body Art's frame was no longer stiff and stagnant, merely following set routines. Instead, it carried a flavor of spontaneity and ease.

His moves had come alive.

Dead strength faded, vitality gradually appeared.

Copper Body Art, Minor Accomplishment.

Digesting the memories surfacing in his mind, Xu Yunfan felt waves of warm currents reappearing within his body, constantly flowing through his muscles and skin.

His originally somewhat slender physique, under the specific effect of 'Muscle Bulging Ridges,' now displayed extremely pronounced muscular lines. His skin, nourished by the warm currents inside, kept swelling and tightening, giving him a sensation as if his entire body was being braced up.

The originally slightly weak Qi and Blood within him now erupted, carrying a feeling of rolling abundance. As he adopted the stance of the Copper Body Art, it slowly dispersed throughout his limbs, continuously nourishing his flesh and skin.

Only then did Xu Yunfan realize that the Copper Body Art was actually a type of External Cultivation technique. Its offense was like a cannon hammer, containing a set of fierce and explosive hammer techniques within it.

Li Haomiao, who had been pondering quietly by the side, heard the commotion and turned his head to see Xu Yunfan chisel off the final piece of ore, revealing the true face of the Source Ancient Jade Wall.

"I feel like your strength has become heavier."

Listening to the sound of the previous swing, Li Haomiao stared at the Source Ancient Jade Wall, unable to look away, though he spoke somewhat uncertainly.

From the clear sound of the hammer striking the ore, he could distinctly hear that Xu Yunfan's power had increased.

Xu Yunfan said, "I can use some hammer techniques now."

"...You truly have exceptional martial arts talent."

Li Haomiao sighed. The Copper Body Art incorporates a fierce hammer technique, possessing an unstoppable force. He hadn't expected Xu Yunfan to understand it was a hammer technique just by manipulating his energy flow.

He slowly shuffled over, looking at the Source Ancient Jade Wall, which was overall an irregular diamond shape. Looking from the inside, one could vaguely see a dark shadow.

Li Haomiao thought for a moment and said, "There's a person lying inside."

Xu Yunfan, who was still sensing the explosive increase in his physical fitness, was full of surprise upon hearing Li Haomiao's words.

"There really is a person?"

He leaned forward, looking up and down, left and right, carefully. Finally, he spotted that human-shaped shadow within the roughly three-meter irregular diamond-shaped ancient jade wall.

"What do we do next?"

Li Haomiao's eyes flickered with a hint of excitement. "Break this jade wall open and dig it out to see."

"This jade wall is very hard; I have no way to deal with it."

Li Haomiao fell into thought, then raised his head to look at Xu Yunfan and his pupils constricted.

"Why have you gotten burlier?"

"I've been training diligently all these days, plus I've had the Cereal Elixir as nourishment. If I didn't get stronger but instead got thinner, wouldn't that mean I've injured myself through training?"

Li Haomiao harbored doubts in his heart. It was a good while before he said softly, "You possess True Blood?"

Only those with True Blood could achieve such rapid cultivation progress and have such drastic changes in their body.

Xu Yunfan shook his head to indicate he didn't know, remaining silent. *Imagination makes one powerful.*

Having an identity like a True Blood bearer could serve as a cover for his extraordinary cultivation speed, which also resolved his concerns.

*True Immortal Bloodline—just thinking about it sounds grand and lofty; it's natural for it to defy common sense.*

Seeing Xu Yunfan's reaction, Li Haomiao looked as if he had confirmed it. He didn't seem surprised either. Just hesitating slightly, his abdomen churned, and he spat out from his mouth a golden awl no larger than a thumb.

Xu Yunfan felt a bit disgusted.

"What is that?"

Li Haomiao looked somewhat reluctantly at the golden awl on the ground and said in a low voice, "This is a fragment of the Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer. Using it as a pickaxe should be able to break this Source Ancient Jade Wall. Since you possess True Blood, you might be able to unleash a fraction of its power."

"The Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer?"

"Just a fragment of a divine weapon. Its spirituality is completely gone now. Just treat it as a very sharp piece of metal and give it a try."

Seeing Xu Yunfan hesitate to move, Li Haomiao frowned.

"Rest assured, there's nothing unusual on it. The timing isn't right now. Even if we dig out the Source Ancient Jade Wall, the person inside definitely cannot wake up. The Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer is also broken, its spirituality dissipated, losing its divine mystery."

"...No, it's just... there's your saliva on it. I find it a bit disgusting."

Li Haomiao: "..."

After fixing the fragment of the Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer onto the tip of the pickaxe and confirming it was stable, Xu Yunfan walked to the Source Ancient Jade Wall. He turned his head to look at Li Haomiao and asked.

"Since we have to break the Source Ancient Jade Wall eventually, why do we have to dig it out first?"

"To see if there's anything ominous inside."

"Did you see?"

Li Haomiao shook his head. "At present, we can only dig it open to see."

"..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to retort. He held his breath, focused his mind, raised the pickaxe, and fixed his gaze on the jade wall before him.

"Eh?!"

Just as he was about to bring the pickaxe down, Xu Yunfan, staring at the Source Ancient Jade Wall, couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

Hearing this, Li Haomiao asked, "What's wrong?"

"It's nothing."

Xu Yunfan shook his head. Just now, when he was staring intently at the Source Ancient Jade Wall, he could see faint, indistinct patterns.

He had a feeling that if he swung the pickaxe along these patterns, it would be much easier.

This must be the effect derived from his Mining reaching Minor Accomplishment—'Digging through Earth like Mud.'

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He raised the pickaxe, gathering all his strength. His calm Qi and Blood began to churn, the muscles and sinews all over his body swelled, and blue veins bulged on his surface, twisting and gnarled, extremely ferocious. The pickaxe fell heavily, bringing with it a sharp whistling sound.

*Ting!*

A clear sound, like a jade bead falling to the ground, resonated melodiously, echoing endlessly within the narrow, winding mine tunnel.

At first, it sounded ethereal, but upon closer listening, it carried a hint of the bizarre. Strands of chilling intent shot up Xu Yunfan's spine.

The notes of the collision seemed to be pulled by an invisible hand, colliding and spreading within the damp stone walls, as if carrying an evil, uncanny aura.

It seemed that something was slowly awakening in the darkness.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan had already retreated behind Li Haomiao.

Li Haomiao: "..."

He coughed dryly: "Rest assured, this Source Ancient Jade Wall is extremely hard. Just one time, it's impossible to..."
