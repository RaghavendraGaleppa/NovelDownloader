# Chapter 148: Displaying One's Prowess

The thunderous sound of nine layers of gear sets meshing echoed from underground, and the gate of the Heavenly Palace Fortress slammed down, transforming into a bridge.

What was most shocking was that Mount Guniu was separating from its foundation. Sixteen arachnid-like mechanical legs, each a hundred yards long, were revealed. Heat dissipation slots at the joints spewed sulfuric steam, dyeing the night sky within a radius of ten miles a blood-red color!

Supported by these spider legs, the entire Heavenly Craft City rose thirty zhang. The steam turbines originally buried deep in the foundation were now fully visible. At the bottom, sixteen groups of ring-shaped boilers forged from Xuan Steel formed the power core, each connected to Xuan Steel drive chains large enough to pull a city gate tower.

The camp of the Incense Fire Sect, which had been stationed outside, suddenly erupted into chaos.

The night patrol disciples looked up in terror at the mechanical city that had been squatting there for nearly a thousand years. Now, it was like a giant steel spider shaking the dirt from its body.

"What... what is that?!!"

The Incense Fire Sect's Grand Protector, a Xisui Master, stared blankly at the mobile fortress approaching them.

Those stinking blacksmiths, those who dabbled in crooked ways, had actually built such a terrifying mobile city.

The eight spider legs did not simply move forward alternately but followed the walking patterns of the Wooden Ox Flowing Horse passed down by the Mo family. Each step landed precisely, avoiding underground rivers. When the composite shock absorbers at the tips of the steel legs unfurled, they converted downward pressure into propulsive force, creating eighteen ring-shaped shockwaves behind them.

Xu Yunfan, filled with awe, lay prone against the observation port, watching the majestic, mountain-like steel fortress crush its way across the wilderness and rivers.

The pavilions and towers that were once considered mere scenery had now retracted into combat modules. The Xuan Gang fortress extended honeycomb-like crossbow plates, and between the interlocking gaps, deep炮口 (cannon muzzles) emerged.

"Fire the Red Scale Fire!"

The roar of the Incense Fire Sect's Red-browed Protector was swallowed by the deafening sound of grinding gears.

Several hundred trembling Incense Fire Sect soldiers had just raised the Red Phosphorus Cannons that had just been delivered from Yujing Prefecture.

They saw the wall of the Heavenly Craft City suddenly flip out three thousand six hundred blade-wheels. The Xuan Steel wall bricks, driven by steam, reassembled into a thousand-petaled iron lotus.

Scorching quenching liquid gushed from the lotus core, drenching the Incense Fire Sect's vanguard camp and turning them into a field of red-hot iron slag.

Cries of pain and wails of agony erupted into chaos, yet they were all drowned out by the tremendous rumble of the moving Heavenly Palace Fortress.

A sharp clang of snapping chains echoed from deep within the earth's veins. Sixteen Xuan Steel spider legs, as thick as mountain-supporting pillars, pierced into the bedrock.

The entire Mount Guniu completely collapsed amidst steam and sparks. As magma shot up from the ground, what accompanied it was a mobile Xuan Steel fortress stretching for three li.

"How does it feel?"

Zhan Yan stood with his arms crossed, looking at everything before him with shock.

"When I first came to the Heavenly Craft Cave and learned that the entire city could move, I thought it was an absurd fantasy. The ancestors and disciples of the Heavenly Craft Cave have exhausted their ingenuity for generations to build this, all for this very moment."

After a long while, Xu Yunfan withdrew his gaze. His emotions had yet to calm down even now.

It was simply too exaggerated!

"The Heavenly Craft Cave also possesses Divine Weapons," Zhan Yan said casually.

This sparked a thought in Xu Yunfan's mind, reminding him of the shadow beneath the Thunderfire Pool when he was forging the Xuan Steel mechanism box a few days ago.

He subconsciously looked down at the Heavenly Craft Fortress beneath his feet. To move such a massive city, was it perhaps forged with a Divine Weapon at its core?

There are relevant records in the Heavenly Craft Forging Record within the Heavenly Craft Forging Art. Once, a Grandmaster of the Mo family personally built a mobile fortress, though it was not as massive as this one.

Back then, it was still an era when the Primordial Spirits were fading but not yet gone, and secret powers were waning but not yet extinguished. There was still a considerable amount of extraordinary secret power in the world.

The Heavenly Craft Fortress before them, so enormous, was almost entirely composed of 99.9% mechanical transmission structures, plus the painstaking work of the civil engineering brothers.

One night, the entire Heavenly Craft Cave fell into a state of insomnia. The Heavenly Craft Fortress, built over a thousand years to achieve success, naturally had an extremely complex multitude of problems.

"Wind pressure anomaly in the Xun position!"

"The impellers in the furnace can't withstand the Earthfire Stones. Have the Heavenly Craft Department quickly replace the impellers in the furnace!"

"Transmission shaft in the Xu area is overloaded!" Han Qiushan, an elder from the Mechanism Hall, was shirtless and covered in oil. His roar carried a metallic friction sound. "Immerse the spare bearings in the Weakwater coolant!"

"..."

A mobile fortress of this size requires far too much maintenance. Once it started moving, thousands of problems were exposed. Almost all the disciples of the Heavenly Craft Cave were on duty, even those from the Forging Hall who usually forged weapons were there to assist.

Xu Yunfan, of course, was eager to try his hand. With his knowledge of the Heavenly Craft Forging Art, after reaching a certain level of proficiency, his expertise naturally far surpassed that of ordinary Mechanism Hall disciples.

Xu Yunfan passed through the steam-filled corridors, the sound of grinding gears and the shouts of disciples filling his ears. He stopped before the transmission shaft in the Xu area. The three-zhang-wide Xuan Steel shaft rod was emitting a piercing friction sound, its surface turning red from the overload.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh. Given the quality of the Xuan Steel, if paired with a skilled weaponsmith, it would be entirely possible to forge a weapon of the Low-grade Sharp Blade level.

The Heavenly Craft Cave had occupied Mount Guniu for a thousand years. In the three-hundred-zhang-deep mine, there was nothing particularly abundant except that Xuan Steel was almost as common as dirt.

Before leaving, the disciples of the Melting Gold Hall had specifically sealed off the mine, hoping to have a chance to return in the future.

Several Mechanism Hall disciples were frantically immersing the spare bearings in the Weakwater coolant, but the cracks in the shaft core were still spreading. This caused Han Qiushan to break out in cold sweat, the size of beans, and the clothes on his back were soaked through.

"Weakwater can only delay metal fatigue. It treats the symptoms, not the root cause," Xu Yunfan suddenly said, his fingertips tracing the surface of the shaft rod.

The Thousand Mechanisms Deconstruction ability of the Heavenly Craft Forging Art activated. The internal transmission structure of the shaft core flowed before his eyes. He frowned slightly. The internal shaft core structure had been jumbled by the impact of the overload, like a tangle of snakes.

If this continued, one of the spider leg segments might temporarily lose function.

"Senior Brother Xu, this shaft rod was left by the Grandmaster. It has a 'Four Symbols Suppressing the Mountain' structure. We dare not tamper with it!" a disciple said in a panic.

Just then, in the disciple's terrified gaze, Xu Yunfan had already grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. The head of the hammer ignited with the Shattered Jade Strength of the Melting Gold Forging Technique, and he slammed it down on the离位 (Li position) mortise and tenon joint where the shaft rod connects.

"Are you crazy?!" Han Qiushan roared, rushing forward to stop him.

But where the hammer fell, sparks flew. The shaft rod, which had been on the verge of collapse, actually emitted a clear dragon's chant. The cracks were forcibly sealed by this single hammer blow, leaving Han Qiushan stunned, his steps slowing involuntarily.

Xu Yunfan pressed both palms against the shaft rod. The muscles in his arms swelled, tightening his sleeves. Under the explosion of his blood and qi, the Mountain Carrying Strength of the Black Tortoise spread from his palm in a unique layered armor pattern, channeling the wild vibrations into the ground of the corridor bridge.

As the Wolf Spear creaked, the heat rising from below the shaft rod rapidly faded.
