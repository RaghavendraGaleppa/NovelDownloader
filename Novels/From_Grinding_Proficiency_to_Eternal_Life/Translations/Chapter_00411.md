# Chapter 411: The Might of Foundation Establishment

Before Hua Ling's words had even faded, Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered, and he distinctly caught the barely perceptible tremor in her pinky finger.

*This woman...*

A silver needle suddenly shot from the tip of her fair finger. The needle's tip glowed with a sinister blue toxin, stabbing toward Zhao Ti's throat like a scorpion's tail.

This "Heart-Eating Needle" was a low-grade magic treasure she had painstakingly gathered materials for and commissioned someone to forge. The needle was as fine as a cow's hair yet concealed seven layers of potent poison. Now, driven by Hua Ling's true essence, the needle's tail trailed a faint green light that spread into the surroundings, making the air reek of blood.

"What courage!"

Xu Yunfan secretly praised.

This demonic sect disciple had been pitiable and charming just a moment ago, yet in the next, she dared to strike a killing blow against the direct grandson of a Foundation Establishment elder. No wonder she could survive within the Primordial Origin Sect; after all, her cultivation was steady and solid.

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, low-level disciples struggled. Within the sect's boundaries, it was manageable, but outside, once pushed to the brink, they would fight desperately.

Even if a Foundation Establishment cultivator could calculate and deduce events, that would only be afterward. They might even find ways to obscure the heavenly secrets, making them impossible to deduce.

When the toxic gleam was just half an inch from Zhao Ti's throat, the Soul-Chaining Chains of the three black-robed Xuanyuan Guards shot forth like black dragons emerging from an abyss.

The bone-etching inscriptions on the chains lit up with a scarlet blood light, arriving after the needle but reaching Hua Ling first, wrapping around her wrist.

A crisp *crack* of bone fracturing rang out, her entire right arm twisting into a bizarre angle in an instant.

"Slut!"

Zhao Ti hastily retreated three steps, touching his neck. The black blood seeping from his fingertips made his face contort; he had been poisoned.

Hua Ling, however, showed no fear. Instead, she became even more arrogant, her scheme having succeeded.

A bewitching arc curled at the corner of her lips, and her eyes flickered with almost manic delight.

"This poison is Desire Poison..." she gently stroked her hair, her voice laced with the sweetness of a viper's hiss. "Refined by extracting a hundred types of desire from the mortal world. Aside from this young lady..." She suddenly lowered her voice, tinged with mockery, "Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator would have to put in some effort to deal with it."

This was the essence of desire qi she had extracted over many years.

Zhao Ti's expression turned ferocious upon hearing this. As a disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak, he knew well that in the Qi Condensation realm, this Desire Poison could only be cured by the practitioner. Heaven knows what kind of stacking she has done with the Hundred Desires.

If it were a Foundation Establishment cultivator, they could naturally dispel it with a wave of their hand. But he was only at the mid-stage of Qi Condensation.

"Capture her..."

*Boom!*

A sword chant that shook the nine heavens suddenly erupted from the northern horizon.

Xu Yunfan felt his spine go numb, the True Martial Subduing Demon Qi within him automatically circulating as if facing a great enemy.

He looked to the side and saw a thousand-mile sea of clouds rapidly appearing at the horizon, only to be instantly split in two by a jade-green sword light. Where the sword intent passed, it manifested the strange phenomenon of "Purple Mansion Flying Rosy Clouds," as if countless rays of light connected the sky and the ground.

"It's a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect!"

Li Ergou exclaimed in shock.

Everyone looked up. Faintly visible at the horizon, the figure standing on a jade Ruyi within the sword light was no larger than a mustard seed. Yet, with a sweep of his sleeve, boundless sword energy surged forth.

The sword light was like a Milky Way hanging upside down, drawing out all the cold evil qi accumulated in the North Pole Ice Abyss for ten thousand years, transforming it into a three-thousand-zhang-long ice dragon that charged straight toward the depths of the earth's veins.

"It's the Dragon-Slaying Sword Stance!"

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted.

As the blood纹 between his brows slightly opened and closed, his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye clearly saw a transparent sword-shaped Dao Foundation suspended at the core of the sword energy.

"It's the Supreme Azure Celestial Dao Foundation of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect."

Yu Congling, who hadn't appeared for a long time, spoke up again at this moment, her voice carrying a hint of emotion.

"Li Qingling of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect. This Dao Foundation requires gathering the clear spiritual qi of the nine heavens to refine for three hundred years. The sword light it points to can pierce the Nine Netherworlds. No wonder even the North Pole's earth veins were shaken."

Hearing Yu Congling's voice transmission, the awestruck Xu Yunfan slightly regained his composure.

"You know her?"

Yu Congling said, "My good junior sister... I didn't expect she would establish her foundation before me..."

She couldn't help but sigh softly. "One wrong step, and every step follows in error. Had I known this, I would not have chosen the Divine Martial World to face my tribulation."

At this moment, the ice layer let out a mournful cry like a primordial beast under the sword pressure.

Countless dark black earth vein dragon qi were forced to manifest, actually condensing into nine struggling black dragons within the sword energy.

The swordsman formed a sword with his fingers and slashed downward, his sharp cry sounding like a heavenly decree: "Cut!"

In an instant, it was as if the star river reversed.

Xu Yunfan had to close his eyes to avoid its锋芒.

When he opened his eyes again, the thousand-mile ice plain had already split into a chasm-like gorge, the nine dragon qi severed at the neck.

The residual sword energy wave swept over everyone's head. Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted, and his blood seemed to freeze at that moment.

The sword energy wave swept past like the descent of heavenly might. Zhao Ti's jade talisman instantly turned to dust, and Hua Ling's mouth and nose bled, looking utterly wretched.

And this... was merely the lingering might of a casual sword strike from a Foundation Establishment cultivator, from a thousand miles away no less!

His heart pounded violently, a unprecedented tremor and desire surging within his chest.

*The Foundation Establishment realm... has such power?*

*If just the shockwaves can crush magic treasures and injure cultivators, what earth-shattering spectacle would a true Foundation Establishment cultivator fighting with all their might at the center of the battlefield be?*

He clenched his fists tightly, his fingertips turning white.

He had originally thought that he was already at the peak of Qi Condensation, just a step away from Foundation Establishment.

But witnessing this gap with his own eyes, he finally knew that this step was like a chasm!

Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment were two completely different worlds!

"Foundation Establishment..." he murmured in a low voice, his eyes burning with a blazing flame.

*If one does not enter Foundation Establishment, one is ultimately just an ant!*

"Young Master, quickly leave!" one of the Xuanyuan Guards suddenly grabbed Zhao Ti. "It's Qingming of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect! Three years ago at Cold Crow Pass, this person slaughtered our Primordial Origin Sect's cultivators ruthlessly. One of our Foundation Establishment elders died by her sword! How could she appear here?!"

Zhao Ti glared resentfully at Li Ergou, but saw that this coward had already钻进 a crack in the ice.

Seeing the sword light in the sky rise again, he had no choice but to grit his teeth and crush a teleportation talisman. "You got lucky this time!"

A purple flash passed, and Zhao Ti's group vanished instantly. However, Xu Yunfan suddenly turned his head.

Li Ergou had somehow appeared behind Hua Ling, and in his palm was a gray-white pill spinning rapidly.

"Soul-Slaying Yin Pill?!"

Hua Ling's expression changed in horror.

This was an evil object refined from resentful souls. Once detonated, it could pollute a cultivator's true essence.

She desperately tried to muster her remaining true essence to dodge, but saw a bizarre smile appear on Li Ergou's simple and honest round face. "I'm sorry, Senior Sister. I'm borrowing your body for a moment. If I achieve the Dao in the future, I will surely guide you out of the sea of suffering in Samsara and continue our immortal path together."

She subconsciously looked at Xu Yunfan, a hint of pleading in her eyes.

Xu Yunfan, ten zhang away, watched this scene, his eyes flickering before returning to calm. He watched indifferently as the expression in Hua Ling's eyes shifted from pleading to resentment, and then to despair.

These demonic sect disciples, one by one, deserved to die. Their deaths were not worth pitying.

The moment the pill exploded, Xu Yunfan clearly saw regret flash in Hua Ling's eyes.

This disciple from the Hundred Desires Peak had ultimately underestimated the ruthlessness of her fellow disciple.

She had thought Li Ergou was just a "medicine dregs" in Zhao Ti's mouth, but she didn't know that for him to have survived until now, he naturally possessed his own vicious methods.

As the gray mist swallowed her delicate body, the sight of her flesh melting like wax even made Xu Yunfan's heart turn cold.
