# Chapter 315: Something Interesting

The dark patterns on the head of the Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer suddenly lit up, intertwining with the formidable energy to form a crimson-black aura. The air along the path was squeezed into visible ring-like ripples.

"Boom!"

The moment the hammer fell, the entire tavern's beams trembled, and the copper bells on the eaves rang out sharply like startled crows scattering.

The carved screen in the third-floor private room was overturned by the shockwave, bowls, plates, and wine pots clattering to the ground. From the adjacent "Heavenly Bing" room came a woman's shriek: "The beams are going to collapse!"

A servant in the corridor dropped his tray, a steaming bowl of snow clam soup splashing onto the blue bricks, sending up a cloud of white mist.

Before the hammer's edge even arrived, the violent pressure had already shredded the scholar's table into dust. Wood shavings mixed with the torn pages of poetry books flew everywhere.

The scholar's companion beside him leaned back sharply, his hair crown swept away by the strong wind and flying to the second-floor courtyard. This made a martial artist who was raising his chopsticks angrily stand up: "Who is fighting up there?!"

It even startled a wealthy merchant at the next table, who ducked under the table, overturning a whole table of sliced perch.

As the scholar慌乱ly raised his sword to block, the hammer's head spontaneously hummed. With the flow of the earth's veins' power, it once again unleashed a ripple of air visible to the naked eye.

A round-faced disciple's shout came from outside the hole: "Senior Brother Xu, don't dirty your hands! Let this junior brother handle it!"

These disciples of the Dao Sect could see clearly that whoever fought the hardest right now would surely catch Xu Yunfan's eye.

The moment the hammer and sword met, the sword's body shattered inch by inch as if struck by lightning. Fragments shot out and embedded themselves in the beams and pillars, startling a cat crouching on the railing, which puffed up its fur and leaped into the back courtyard.

The scholar's sleeves on both arms exploded into a flurry of butterflies, revealing the Sword Pavilion's protective energy beneath his skin, covered in bloodstains. This made the martial artists peeking from outside gasp in shock.

"The Sword Pavilion's 'Gold and Jade Sword Body' can't even block a single hammer?!"

The shockwave swept through the room. The blue brick walls of the adjacent private room were covered in spiderweb-like cracks. The copper bells on the eaves rang chaotically before shattering into powder.

The hammer's force was not yet spent. The wind from the hammer, carrying wood shavings, formed a three-zhang wide vortex above the scholar's head. The entire third floor of the Changfeng Tavern collapsed with a deafening crash.

Amidst the muffled sound of beams and pillars breaking, rubble rained down, sending the diners below scrambling for cover.

The screen in the second-floor private room was blasted away by the shockwave, revealing a table of delicacies inside. The sliced perch was still trembling on the plate, but the wine pot had already rolled to the ground. Amber-colored wine seeped into the cracks, mixing with wood shavings to form murky foam.

Xu Yunfan stood alone, holding the hammer. The hammer's head was still humming, and the residual shockwaves from the earth's veins caused the wooden planks under his feet to crack and shatter.

He lowered his eyes and glanced at the pair of hammers in his hands. The dark patterns on the hammerheads surged like tides, and a faint hum from the earth's veins could be heard.

The move "Five Mountains Collapse" he had just executed was not his full power, but due to the mountain spirit inherent in the Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer, it had tilted the beams and pillars of the third-floor private room and cracked the blue bricks.

Wood shavings and porcelain fragments fell in a rustling cascade. From below came the heart-wrenching wail of the tavern owner: "My century-old purple sandalwood screen..."

"..."

He lightly stroked the still-lingering ripples on the hammer handle with his fingertips, thinking to himself: *The starting stance should be as light as a feather skimming the water, and the hammer fall should display the power of thunder... But with this current commotion, it's more like a brute swinging a firewood axe.*

Suddenly, the round-faced disciple's stuttering exclamation came from below: "S-Senior Brother Xu! The Sword Pavilion's scabbard is still stuck in the floor tiles..."

Before he could finish, the scabbard shattered into dust with a "crack."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but shake his head. This divine weapon had yet to fully recognize its master. During the clash, it had spontaneously drawn upon the earth's veins, turning a mere three-tenths of his strength into a twelve-tenths display of power.

Heaven is my witness, on his first day in Jade Capital City, he had no intention of causing trouble, so he had used very little force.

In the dust, the scholar sat amidst the ruins. His hair crown had long since been pulverized, his long, disordered hair covered in wood shavings. The fragments of his sword were deeply embedded in the elm pillar beside him, and the protective jade pendant hanging from the sword tassel had already been blown to dust.

The martial artists peeking from outside were utterly silent. Many observant individuals, seeing the Dao Sect waist tokens hanging from Xu Yunfan's group, remained seated on the ground.

Xu Yunfan did not press his attack.

Xu Yunfan sighed softly. The moment his five fingers released the hammer's handle, the pair of Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammers slid into their slots along the steel mechanism at his waist with a "click."

The hammer heads pointed diagonally toward the ground. The dark green bodies of the hammers formed two cold gleams in the twilight, like the fangs of a lurking beast.

The steel belt at his waist sagged slightly, but not a single tremor could be seen. These three-hundred-jin weapons seemed to have grown onto his waist.

This belt mechanism was crafted using his Heavenly Forging Technique. Each part inside could have been made by the disciples of the Heavenly Forging Department back in the Heavenly Forging Cave, but unfortunately, in the Dao Sect, he had to craft each one by hand, which took him a full half-day to complete.

"Who gave you the courage to say these things?"

The scholar grinned, a trail of bright red blood overflowing from the corner of his mouth. Yet, an undisguised, pleasurable smile appeared on his face, and there was no trace of fear in his eyes.

"I am Jiang Jingguo, a true disciple of the Sword Pavilion. Do you dare to kill me?"

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged upon hearing this.

This trip was an impulsive decision of his, and his movements were unpredictable.

He had chosen the Changfeng Tavern simply because this chain restaurant, with branches in every state of the Great Zhou, was the most conspicuous. It reminded him of the events in North Ye City of Qingzhou, which was why he had come up.

The round-faced disciple, hearing Jiang Jingguo's arrogant words, was instantly furious, a cold light flashing in his eyes.

His right hand shot to his sword hilt. The Green Edge sword unsheathed three inches, its blade reflecting the tavern's lamplight with a chilling gleam. The wooden plank under his foot was already cracked like a spiderweb from the hidden force he exerted.

Just as he was about to lunge forward, Xu Yunfan's left hand, like an iron pincer, clamped down on his shoulder and neck. With immense strength, it forcibly halted his explosive movement.

"No need to be hasty."

Xu Yunfan's voice was not loud, but it made the round-faced disciple's ears ring.

The force flowing through his five fingers formed a chain within the disciple's body.

The round-faced disciple felt as if his entire right arm was immersed in molten rock. The long sword that was humming in its sheath immediately fell silent. Cold sweat at his temples rolled down. This chief disciple's seemingly casual suppression had actually rendered this disciple, who had reached the Marrow Cleansing realm, completely powerless.

Although Xu Yunfan appeared to have two lackeys by his side, one must know that within the Jade Capital City and the Dao Sect's驻地, he was considered the third-in-command.

The third floor was instantly so quiet that the creaking sound of the beams bearing weight could be heard.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips lightly tapped the round-faced disciple's shoulder twice, using a hidden force to push him back to his original position. The footprints left on the blue bricks, however, were already half an inch deep.

This display of effortless suppression was more intimidating than a direct attack.

Xu Yunfan's eyelids drooped slightly, his gaze sweeping indifferently over the round-faced disciple's smiling face.

This disciple of the Dao Sect, named Chen Hong, had been running errands for him ever since he set foot in the驻地, his flattery almost deliberate. When handing him a handkerchief, his fingertips would casually probe his physique. When leading the way, he would always slow down by half a step at corners to observe his footing.

At this moment, that seemingly casual gaze made the hair on the back of Chen Hong's neck stand on end.

The smile plastered on his face instantly stiffened, the muscles at the corners of his mouth twitching uncontrollably twice as he hurriedly lowered his head to hide the panic flashing in his eyes.

"X-Xu, Senior Brother Xu..."

Chen Hong's Adam's apple bobbed as he squeezed out a few words, his voice as dry as if it had been scraped by sandpaper.
