## Author's Note on Going Premium

The novel will be going premium tomorrow!

I originally planned to write until the Foundation Establishment stage before going premium, but I received the premium notification today, and it feels a bit rushed.

Overall, this book's performance has been quite good. Although the early stages were a bit rocky, it steadily improved later on and completed four rounds of recommendations. Transitioning from fanfiction to original work was a significant hurdle, and this step was very difficult, but no matter what, I had to take it. I'm quite satisfied with the current data.

I want to thank every reader for collecting the novel and consistently following along! Also, a big thank you to my editor, Haoyun, for their continuous support!

The novel will go premium tomorrow at noon (12 PM). As per usual, I'll release five chapters in a burst, and thereafter, I'll update with ten thousand words daily. I hope both new and old friends can offer strong support and give your first subscription!

Many thanks to everyone!
