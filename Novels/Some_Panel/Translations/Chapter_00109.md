# Chapter 108: Aftermath

“All of you got benefits, but I got none. That's too unfair to me,” the Buddha Child complained, feeling wronged.

“Opportunities aren't something you can force. Don't be envious,” Yang Ji glanced at him, chuckling.

“In truth, opportunities are tied to karma. Some karmic connections bring benefits, while others you simply cannot bear, leading to a deadly disaster,” Grand Venerable Muyuan said with a laugh.

Upon hearing this, the Buddha Child immediately shivered and obediently shut his mouth. Such words came from a Red Dust Immortal; he dared not take them lightly.

Now that the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison had been eradicated, the deathly mist outside had also vanished, leaving only a fragmented continent floating in the air. Grand Venerable Muyuan waved a hand, showering endless immortal light across the land. The fragmented world beneath his feet rapidly shrank, eventually transforming into a streak of immortal light that vanished into his lower abdomen.

“Little friend, you can release them now,” Grand Venerable Muyuan said to Yang Ji.

“Alright.” Yang Ji understood, opening his Mountain and Sea World. The Immortal-Beating Stone and the five Integration Realm cultivators immediately flew out as streams of light.

As soon as they emerged, everyone sensed a different aura of the world. An elderly Integration Realm cultivator looked around, noticing that the ground beneath his feet was no longer the familiar land but an boundless ocean with surging waves. Above their heads, there was no longer gray mist, but a clear, azure sky. The morning sun was just rising in the east, and a warm breeze caressed their faces. The world had completely transformed.

What kind of figures were these people? Integration Realm Grand Sages! After a moment of stunned silence, they instantly reacted: they had come out; this was the Great World outside. They exchanged glances, inexplicably excited.

At this moment, they also heard the Immortal-Beating Stone beside them cry out tremblingly, “Ma-Master? Is that you?”

“It's me. You've worked hard all these years,” Grand Venerable Muyuan smiled and said.

“Master, what happened?” The Immortal-Beating Stone looked around, also noticing the change in their surroundings, asking with excitement and surprise, “Master, where is that Celestial Demon?”

“Master?” The five Integration Realm cultivators looked over upon hearing this, seeing a black-robed elder they had never met, yet whose aura felt incredibly familiar. Their hearts trembled slightly. Combining this with the Immortal-Beating Stone's words, they instantly guessed the elder's identity. They immediately stepped forward and respectfully bowed, “Greetings, Grand Venerable Muyuan.”

“There's no need for such courtesy, everyone. Thank you for blocking the surging blood qi from outside for me all these years; otherwise, it would have been difficult for me to completely eradicate the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison,” Grand Venerable Muyuan smiled faintly, lifting a hand to release a gentle force that supported the five individuals.

“Master, you've eradicated the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison?” The Immortal-Beating Stone asked in surprise.

Grand Venerable Muyuan smiled enigmatically, “Yes, the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison has been completely eradicated by me. The Pure Yang Violet Lightning has bombarded him for so many years. Even with the demonic blade protecting him, he had long been severely weakened. I intentionally diverted my attention to converse with you, revealing a flaw, showing him my weakness. The Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison thought he seized an opportunity and actually burned his origin, attempting to break out of the formation to leak his aura and attract his kin. Alas, he miscalculated. Everything was within my control. He was already weak, and after burning his origin, he became even weaker. I seized the chance and utterly eradicated him.”

After Grand Venerable Muyuan finished speaking, a faint smile on his face, he also let out a long sigh of relief. For a Red Dust Immortal to be so, anyone could hear the thrilling and endless danger involved; one wrong step would lead to eternal perdition.

However, at their cultivation level, having experienced too much, they wouldn't blindly believe someone's words, even if he were a Red Dust Immortal. Everyone's gazes subtly swept over Yang Ji, quietly revealing thoughtful expressions. After this young man arrived, Grand Venerable Muyuan eradicated his opponent. Was there a significant connection between these events? However, they were all intelligent people and knew this was not something they could delve into deeply. The karma involved was too vast, and the implications too great for them to bear. The thought of further inquiry was self-extinguished, but their gazes towards Yang Ji still held a peculiar light, seemingly hinting at a desire for good relations.

The five cultivators were quite seasoned. With thoughts flashing through their minds, they immediately offered their congratulations, “Congratulations, Senior, on successfully eradicating the demon and severing ten thousand years of karma.”

Grand Venerable Muyuan's gaze swept over the five, nodding faintly with a smile. By announcing the death of the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison in front of them, he affirmed their contributions, effectively bringing them onto the same side. It was as if he was saying, everyone had a part in slaying the demon, and they should be cautious with their words and actions to outsiders; they should know what should or shouldn't be said. Of course, if it were before, with the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison not yet eradicated, he would have worried about everyone colluding with the Outer Realm Celestial Demons. Now, the Demonic Lord of the Imperial Prison was dead, and his millions of disciples were gone, leaving him alone and desolate. From now on, there would be no more restraints or concerns. With his Red Dust Immortal cultivation, he could roam freely across all worlds. The Outer Realm Celestial Demons would ultimately face the ultimate revenge of a Red Dust Immortal. The wheel of karma turned thus.

Everyone's hearts were clear, and being of the same human race, they had already made an initial decision the moment they helped Grand Venerable Muyuan. Now that Grand Venerable Muyuan was free, they also let out a collective sigh of relief. At least Grand Venerable Muyuan had won; otherwise, the consequences would have been unpredictable.

At this moment, standing before them was a Red Dust Immortal, a powerful existence they had previously been utterly unable to reach. Such a figure was even more mysterious and powerful than a Nine Tribulations Immortal. They absolutely could not miss this opportunity to forge closer ties.

Immediately, a worldly-wise elder from the Integration Realm respectfully smiled, “Senior, today, with the demon vanquished and you freed, is truly a great day. We've all been cooped up for a millennium. Why don't we find an inn, have a good drink, and relax?”

Grand Venerable Muyuan naturally knew what they were thinking. He was also grateful, nodding with a smile, “Good, let's drink to our heart's content.”

“I recognize this sea area; it should be the Sunset Glow Sea Region. I know a good inn there. Senior, little friend, let's go,” the Integration Realm elder said, specifically smiling and gesturing towards Yang Ji.

Yang Ji nodded with a smile, ascending into the sky with them, flying in the direction of the rising sun. During their flight, they chatted and learned that the old man with silver-white eyes was named Ming Hai, an elder from the Canghai Sect. The Canghai Sect, located in the Canghai region, was a powerful sect second only to the Ten Great Daoist Sects and Ten Great Demonic Sects, belonging to the second tier. The old man in Daoist robes, who appeared ethereal and immortal-like, was named Daoist Xuan Ling, from the Hidden Immortal Daoist Temple, a sect that was one of the Ten Great Daoist Sects. The middle-aged man resembling a scholar was named Feng Ran, from the Myriad Sword Sect, also a powerful sect second only to the Ten Great Daoist Sects and Ten Great Demonic Sects. As for the gaunt-faced, white-haired old cultivator named Hong Bo, he was surprisingly a rogue cultivator. Yang Ji gave him a second glance. It was extremely difficult for rogue cultivators to reach the Integration Realm; this elder must have obtained some legacy from a ruin, or such fortune would be hard to come by. The last old man, with white robes and white eyebrows, was named Gao Shi, from the Pure Yang Dao Sect, which was one of the Ten Great Daoist Sects.

Everyone chatted briefly, sighing with emotion. They all belonged to different sects, yet they had formed a connection due to the deathly mist. Meeting under such circumstances was truly fate.

“By the way, we still don't know your name, little friend,” Hong Bo said with a smile.

“My junior name is Yang Ji, from the Boundless Dao Sect,” Yang Ji said with a slight smile.

“So it's a disciple of a Daoist Sect, no wonder your temperament is extraordinary,” Hong Bo praised, nodding.

“Senior, you flatter me,” Yang Ji said with a laugh.
