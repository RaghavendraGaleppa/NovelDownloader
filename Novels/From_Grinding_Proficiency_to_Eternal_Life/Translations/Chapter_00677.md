Chapter 677: As Expected of You

"Senior Sister Dongming!"

Her voice no longer carried its usual lazy charm but was tinged with gravity.

Xu Yunfan maintained his composure, feigning ignorance as he cupped his fists in greeting. "Senior Sister Dongming."

"The three natives of the Aetila World are simply, simply the most shameless beings in existence!"

Xu Yunfan feigned surprise. "Has Senior Sister already gone to Aetila? What did you gain from it?"

Upon hearing Xu Yunfan ask about her gains, she recalled the ordeal she had suffered in Aetila. Her chest heaved with suppressed rage.

"The God of Light cowers in his divine kingdom, relying on the faith of billions of believers to bolster his defenses, making it as tough as a tortoise shell. The God of Darkness hides in the shadows, using every dirty trick for sneak attacks and ambushes. But most hateful of all is the God of Nature. He has countless avatars that merge with the mountains, rivers, flora, and fauna. He is impossible to kill and impossible to shake off—extremely troublesome, especially since he is fighting on his own turf."

"I exhausted all my methods, destroyed three of his natural divine kingdoms, and severely wounded the God of Darkness's origin. Yet, I still fell into their trap. The power of nature infected my foundation, and the three of them working together drew upon the backlash of the world's origin. I had no choice but to retreat."

As she spoke, her anger grew. Her delicate hands gripped the armrests of her throne so tightly her knuckles turned white.

"If not for the fact that my Nine Nether Netherforce Dao Fruit is adept at perception and evasion, allowing me to escape in time, I would have likely fallen in that primitive land!"

Xu Yunfan listened with a perfectly calm expression. Although the Aetila Great World's rank wasn't as high as the Taihua Lingxu World, it had managed to孕育出 three Dao Fruits. If a Golden Core initial-stage True Lord went there and was detected by the world's will, they would learn the hard way what it means to be a hero far from home.

She lifted her eyes, her gaze burning as she fixed it on Xu Yunfan.

"Junior Brother Xu, you are now a core disciple of our Primordial Origin Sect and have been acknowledged by the Dao Lord. We are family. Since we are family, we shouldn't speak like outsiders. You have personally experienced this world and surely know its intricacies. Can you help me? I need you to help me break this deadlock!"

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, his expression indifferent. His purple-gold Dao Robe flowed with a faint light in the gloomy great hall, standing in stark contrast to the surrounding Netherforce.

He didn't respond immediately, simply watching Dongming True Lord in silence, his face showing a hint of difficulty.

"Please see the situation clearly, Senior Sister. I have only just entered the Golden Core Realm. Although I have attained the title of True Lord, my foundation is not yet solid. Furthermore, I must contemplate my future path and practice my new method. I truly cannot spare the time!"

Dongming True Lord saw that he was impossible to persuade and cursed inwardly. *As expected of a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect.*

*If you don't take out benefits, there is no way to move them.*

She took a deep breath to suppress her churning Qi and blood, softening her voice with unprecedented sincerity and temptation.

"Senior Sister understands your ways. Disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect never act without profit. State your conditions!"

Xu Yunfan's face still held a look of difficulty.

"Senior Sister, I am not the type to take advantage of a crisis. You have misjudged me."

Hearing this, Dongming True Lord grew even angrier inside. She paused, then said through gritted teeth, "I can imprint all my cultivation insights from the Golden Core initial stage to the mid-stage, including my understanding of bottlenecks, directly into you. Without reservation! This is the foundation of the Dao path. You know its value!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan still beating around the bush, her red lips parted slightly.

"If you agree, Senior Sister can practice the Yin-Yang dual cultivation method with you. My Nine Nether Netherforce is extreme Yin and extreme Cold, while your Divine Thunder is extreme Yang and extreme Yang. The union of Yin and Yang is the supreme Dao. It would be of immense benefit to both of us in stabilizing our Golden Cores and comprehending the cycle of Yin and Yang! This is the primordial Yin of my Dao Body, the essence of ten thousand years of cultivation!"

A strange flush crept up her cheeks, whether from shame and anger or the agitation of her injuries.

Xu Yunfan's eyelids twitched almost imperceptibly.

"Senior Sister, didn't we cultivate together last time? How can you still have primordial Yin?"

Dongming True Lord chuckled. "Cultivation is cultivation, but the primordial Yin wasn't released."

*There's such a说法?* Xu Yunfan was immediately intrigued. If he could obtain the primordial Yin of a veteran Golden Core True Lord, his cultivation would definitely skyrocket.

Seeing Xu Yunfan waver, Dongming True Lord pressed her advantage.

"Furthermore, the three main gods of the Aetila World all possess Dao Fruits. In particular, the God of Darkness's 'Eternal Night Abyss' Dao Fruit is perfectly compatible with my Nine Nether Netherforce Dao. If I can seize and refine it, I have a thirty percent chance of breaking into the Golden Core mid-stage. As for the God of Light's 'Great Light Infinite' Dao Fruit and the God of Nature's 'All Things Vitality' Dao Fruit, they would be supreme nourishment for the阴阳调和 of your Divine Thunder Dao Fruit and the evolution of your cave heaven!"

"届时, you and I join forces, each taking one. How about it?"

She stared intently at Xu Yunfan.

"Junior Brother Xu, I have shown such sincerity. The Aetila World is a masterless great world with a雄厚 origin. This is a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity. If we miss this, once those three main gods recover their strength, or if other True Lords take notice, it will be as difficult as reaching the heavens to plot against them again."

Xu Yunfan was genuinely tempted, but he knew he had to go through the motions. He revealed a look of hesitation and temptation on his face.

The great hall fell into silence, leaving only Dongming True Lord's slightly hurried breathing. The Nine Nether Netherforce mist churned restlessly around her, betraying her inner anxiety.

Xu Yunfan remained silent for a moment, then the stoic, unchanging expression on his face finally broke into a brilliant, incredibly sincere smile. It was as if a frozen river had thawed and spring had returned to the earth.

"Dongming Senior Sister,"

His voice was clear and bright, carrying a hint of just the right amount of enthusiasm.

"You should have said so earlier! We are fellow sect disciples; supporting each other is our duty. Senior Sister is so generous, offering to teach me the Dao and...咳, providing your full support, even willing to share the opportunity of the Dao Fruits. If I, Xu, were to refuse again, wouldn't that be showing a lack of appreciation?"

He took a step forward and cupped his fists.

"The Aetila World, I do know a thing or two. The origins of the three main gods, the weaknesses of their divine kingdoms, and even the flaws in their joint attacks are all in my chest. Moreover, I have an insider within Aetila who should be able to set up some traps. When does Senior Sister plan to set out? I am willing to offer my humble services!"

Dongming True Lord watched the utterly sincere smile on his face, and the corners of her eyes twitched violently. *You little rascal! You won't lift a finger without seeing the reward!*

But on the surface, she looked relieved and forced a smile. "Good! Good! As expected of Junior Brother Xu, straightforward and efficient! There's no time to lose. Once I recover a bit, in three days, we shall enter Aetila again!"

Seeing that Xu Yunfan didn't answer and just stood there waiting, Dongming True Lord didn't delay any further. She raised her hand and tossed out a black jade slip, within which a dark light flowed.

"This is my Golden Core cultivation insight, a true path of practice. Junior Brother Xu can take a look first. As for the dual cultivation matter..."

Her eyes rippled with a difficult-to-describe meaning.

"Let's wait until I have recovered in three days to discuss it in detail."

Xu Yunfan caught the jade slip. A sweep of his divine sense confirmed the content was vast and profound, truly the insights of a True Lord. His smile grew even wider.

"Senior Sister is absolutely right! I shall return to the mountain to make preparations. In three days, I will await your arrival!"

With a flash of purple-gold thunder light, Xu Yunfan's figure vanished from the great hall.

Dongming True Lord looked in the direction he had disappeared. The forced smile on her face instantly vanished, replaced by deep exhaustion and a hint of heartache.

"That kid, his appetite is truly enormous!"

She muttered to herself, gently touching a deep wound on her chest—one that revealed bone and was entwined with the phantom of a green vine. A cold light flashed in her eyes.
