# Chapter 15: The Third Princess  

The next day dawned gloomy and overcast.  

Zhao Jiuzhou was preparing to return to the Black Iron Sect with Physician Xue's head in tow. He told Xiao Ji that he wanted to rebuild the sect, ensuring its continued existence in the cultivation world—this would at least give some closure to the master who had guided him onto the path of cultivation.  

After their brief acquaintance, Xiao Ji had come to understand that, aside from Zhao Jiuzhou's penchant for disguise techniques and a somewhat stubborn temperament, he was a man of loyalty and principle. So, Xiao Ji saw him off sincerely, accompanying him all the way to the city gates before finally waving goodbye.  

Zhao Jiuzhou was the first cultivator Xiao Ji had befriended since stepping into the murky waters of the martial world.  

Outside the city gates, a light snow began to fall.  

Watching Zhao Jiuzhou's retreating figure, Xiao Ji suddenly remembered something: "I should have gotten him a carriage."  

Ordinary cultivators couldn't ride spiritual tools until they formed their golden core, so most of their travels were done on foot or with the help of horses and oxen.  

Returning to the city, Xiao Ji had originally planned to visit the Fragrant Tea House to observe the storyteller, Master Wan, up close. Unfortunately, the man had been away from Willow Town for days, with no telling when he might return.  

Left with little else to do, Xiao Ji wandered the streets, gathering hidden information as he went.  

He had no ulterior motives—he simply wanted to reach the sixth level of Qi Refinement as quickly as possible so he could head to the Ancient City of Tai and seize opportunities before others did. The fear of arriving too late gnawed at him.  

Strolling through the bustling market street, Xiao Ji moved among the crowds, harvesting cultivation points at regular intervals.  

**[I must marry Widow Niu, no one can stop me… I desperately want a wife.]**  

**[I really want to visit the brothel, but my pockets are empty. When will I strike it rich?]**  

**[It's so cold today. I should go home and drink a couple of jars of wine.]**  

**[This Taoist is quite handsome, too bad he's from the Primordial Spirit Temple… Deep perception, +1 cultivation point.]**  

The thoughts and murmurs of passersby flowed into Xiao Ji's awareness.  

"What's wrong with the Primordial Spirit Temple? Did we eat your rice or force you to burn incense?" Xiao Ji shot a glance at the unpleasant-looking woman and quickened his pace.  

The Primordial Spirit Temple was located within Willow Town, so many locals were familiar with it—and with Xiao Ji as one of its resident Taoists.  

His mood soured slightly. The temple had long been a local landmark, and while people had always known its incense wasn't particularly effective, they had never openly disparaged it before.  

*I should look into this issue when I have time.*  

For now, his priority was reaching the sixth level of Qi Refinement and making his way to the Ancient City of Tai.  

As he walked, the sound of an argument reached his ears.  

"You ate without paying? Don't even think about leaving!" A candied hawthorn vendor blocked the path of a young woman.  

"But I don't have any money—it was stolen," the woman retorted, though her tone carried more embarrassment than defiance. "I'll pay you back when I get some."  

"Look at how well-dressed she is, yet she's pulling this kind of stunt," muttered a bystander, pointing fingers.  

*So greedy for sweets, yet so broke…* Xiao Ji moved closer to observe the commotion and quickly grasped the situation.  

The woman had eaten the candied hawthorn without money to pay, angering the vendor. By all accounts, she was in the wrong.  

"Come with me to see the magistrate!" The vendor refused to let her off the hook.  

"No! I absolutely cannot go to the magistrate!" Panic flickered across the woman's face.  

"You must have a criminal record if you're this afraid of officials," the vendor said suspiciously.  

Xiao Ji studied the woman carefully and realized she looked familiar. After a moment, he recognized her—she had been present at the Lu residence.  

Back then, she had lingered at the periphery, just beyond the range of his perception, so he hadn't been able to discern her background.  

During the childbirth incident at the Lu household, this woman had been jotting things down in a small notebook… Though she hadn't been of much help in the end, she had eaten plenty of the Lu family's food—and hadn't held back.  

"Not just greedy, but also afraid of the law—definitely suspicious," Xiao Ji mused, stepping closer. "Lu Jinyin was generous that day and gave her a share of silver. She shouldn't be so broke she can't even afford candied hawthorn."  

As he neared her, new information surfaced in his mind.  

**[Ying Xiao, the Third Princess of the Great Li Kingdom, the current ruler's most beloved daughter. After her father mentioned arranging a political marriage for her with the River Valley Kingdom, she argued with him in a fit of anger and fled the palace… Hence her reluctance to face officials, fearing her father would find her.]**  

**[She left home without bringing any silver. Along the way, she pawned her hairpins, bracelets, jade pendants, and other valuables at low prices. Recently, having run out of money, she sneaked into the Lu residence to mooch a meal and ten taels of silver. Unfortunately, lacking life experience, the remaining three taels were stolen while she was eating candied hawthorn.]**  

**[She only realized she couldn't pay after finishing the treat.]**  

**[Deep perception, +3 cultivation points.]**  

Xiao Ji stared at the woman named Ying Xiao, astonished by her noble status. *If only I'd met her sooner—all those pawned valuables could have been mine.*  

"It's just a stick of candied hawthorn. I'll cover it," Xiao Ji said, fishing out two copper coins for the vendor. "She already told you her money was stolen. No need to press the matter."  

Just then, patrolling constables approached, drawn by the gathering crowd.  

Among the onlookers, a thin man paled at the sight of the officers and tried to slip away.  

Xiao Ji locked onto him.  

**[This man stole Ying Xiao's three taels and nineteen copper coins. He's trying to flee.]**  

"What's the commotion here?" The two constables strode forward, ready to disperse the crowd.  

"Perfect timing," Xiao Ji said, stepping forward and gripping the thin man's shoulder. "This man stole this lady's money… I saw it with my own eyes."  

After some investigation, the constables confirmed the theft and hauled the culprit away to the magistrate's office.  

With the minor dispute resolved, Ying Xiao thanked Xiao Ji and offered him two taels of silver as a reward.  

"You're already this broke—keep the money for food," Xiao Ji declined. "I can see you're not from around here, and you're clearly inexperienced in the ways of the world, losing money like that… Why are you traveling alone?"  

"I had a fight with my family," Ying Xiao admitted.  

*Not entirely a lie.*  

"If you really have nowhere to stay, the Primordial Spirit Temple has empty rooms. They're not luxurious, but they're clean enough. You can stay there temporarily," Xiao Ji offered, then added, "If you need anything, just ask."  

Building a good relationship with this woman could prove useful—having connections in the imperial court never hurt.  

Once this pampered Third Princess of Great Li had her stubbornness worn down by hardship and inevitably missed her life of luxury, she would return to the capital. And when she did, she would surely remember the kindness of the Primordial Spirit Temple.  

Then, when the time came to renovate the temple, asking her for support would be a simple matter.  

"Do you provide meals?" Ying Xiao asked.  

"Three meals a day, served on time, and you can eat your fill," Xiao Ji replied seriously.  

After a brief exchange, Ying Xiao decided to take up residence at the Primordial Spirit Temple.  

Since running away from home, securing three meals a day had been a constant struggle. Now that she had a place to stay, even temporarily, it was too good to pass up.  

"Just a heads-up—I have a master who loves telling stories. If he starts rambling, just humor him," Xiao Ji warned her about the temple's conditions.  

Ying Xiao pondered for a moment before solemnly promising she wouldn't argue with the old man.  

"I never quarrel with my elders," she declared firmly.  

She seemed to have forgotten that she had fled home precisely because of an argument with her elders.
