# Chapter 2: Refreshing Talent, Yin Wood Spirit Body

After leaving the temple, Chu Ning jogged to a cave he had spotted earlier that day. It would serve as a temporary shelter for the night.

**[Nine Yin Body Forging Technique (0/100)]**

With just a thought, Chu Ning could still see this display in his mind. 

"This seems like a proficiency panel. I wonder if it has other functions," he muttered to himself. He tried various methods like adding points, but nothing worked.

With sleep eluding him, Chu Ning gathered some dry branches and lit them with a fire starter. By the flickering light, he carefully studied the Nine Yin Body Forging Technique manual. 

The book contained nine sets of movement diagrams with accompanying explanations, claiming that persistent practice of these sequences would yield body-forging results. After reading, Chu Ning began practicing the first set.

"Ah!" 

The moment he assumed the posture, Chu Ning gasped in pain, feeling as though his tendons were being torn. Gritting his teeth, he continued. 

By the time he finished the first round—albeit clumsily—his body felt as if it had been thoroughly beaten. 

**[Nine Yin Body Forging Technique (0/100)]**

No change. The proficiency remained at zero. 

Undeterred, Chu Ning believed that since the panel existed, it must serve a purpose. More practice would surely yield results. However, the excruciating soreness deterred him from another attempt. 

Ironically, the exhaustion from the day's events, which he thought would keep him awake, now lulled him into sleep.

The next morning, Chu Ning woke to find the soreness surprisingly mild. He practiced again, noticing slight improvements in his movements. Yet, the proficiency still hadn't changed. 

Baffled but unwilling to dwell on it, he packed his belongings and set off toward Qingxi City, guided by a map he'd found on Cai Fu. 

During his journey, Chu Ning practiced the technique morning and night. It wasn't for lack of diligence—he simply felt that twice daily was his body's limit. Though the proficiency didn't increase, the fatigue lessened noticeably. 

After four days and nine practice sessions, something finally changed.

**[Nine Yin Body Forging Technique (1/100)]**

"Ah! The proficiency increased to 1! So, ten sessions equal one point." 

Encouraged, Chu Ning felt reinvigorated. Previously, two daily sessions left him exhausted, but now he had energy to spare. Perhaps he could manage three or even four sessions a day. 

With renewed determination, he continued his journey, practicing along the way. By the time he reached Qingxi City ten days later, his proficiency had risen to 3. 

Upon inquiry, he learned that Qingxi Sect's recruitment trials were six months away. With the money taken from the master-servant duo, he had enough to live comfortably until then. 

Renting a modest house in a quiet part of the city, Chu Ning settled into a routine: practicing the technique three times daily and occasionally exploring the city for more information about this world. 

Though Qingxi City was a mortal settlement, its proximity to the sect meant more knowledge about cultivation circulated there. Chu Ning learned that Qingxi Sect was located nearly a hundred li away in the Qingxia Mountains. 

The sect recruited every three years. Those with exceptional talent entered as inner disciples, the proficient as outer disciples, and those with average aptitude as servant disciples. 

Aptitude was determined by spiritual root testing. Uncertain about his own roots, Chu Ning focused on waiting and practicing. 

Time flew, and soon, half a year had passed.

**[Nine Yin Body Forging Technique (99/100)]**

Seeing this, Chu Ning's eyes gleamed with anticipation. 

"After reaching 99, I've done nine more sessions over two days. One more, and it'll hit 100." 

Though eager to complete the final session immediately, he had already practiced four times that day—his current limit. 

Initially, two daily sessions were his max. Now, he could manage four. 

"Tomorrow morning is the recruitment trial. I'll do one last session then." 

Suppressing his excitement, Chu Ning bathed and slept. 

At dawn, he rose and began practicing. The movements, once daunting, now flowed effortlessly. As he completed the ninth set—

**Boom!**

A barrier within him seemed to shatter. 

His clothes, freshly changed the day before, were now drenched and covered in grime. He felt reborn—light and revitalized. 

Simultaneously, his mind raced to check the panel.

**[Nine Yin Body Forging Technique (100/100)]**  
**[Talent Refreshed: Reward—Yin Wood Spirit Body]**  
1. Greatly enhances affinity with wood-attribute spiritual energy, accelerating cultivation of wood-based techniques and spells.  
2. Wood-attribute spiritual power can conceal itself from detection or reveal strength at will.  

"Talent refresh! Yin Wood Spirit Body!" 

Chu Ning's heart swelled with joy. This must be the reward for maxing out proficiency. 

"With a spirit body, I must have a spiritual root, right?" 

He hurried out, heading for the city gates. Today was the recruitment day—testing would confirm his roots. As for the spirit body's effects, he'd discover those after joining a sect. 

"People here only talk about spiritual roots, never spirit bodies," he mused, wondering what to do if the test didn't detect his. 

The streets were already crowded with young aspirants. Over the past weeks, many had arrived from afar. Chu Ning blended into the throng. 

At the east gate, Qingxi Sect disciples distributed test tokens. A young woman handed him one without looking up. 

"Group D, Number 19." 

Outside the gates, a vast testing ground awaited. Chu Ning joined his designated line as others filed in. Nearby, Groups A, B, and C had already begun testing. 

"Ah, no spiritual root!"  
"Quadruple spiritual roots—a false root, but enough to become a servant disciple."  
"Wow, triple roots! Eligible for the outer sect!"  

Gasps and murmurs rippled through the crowd. 

Soon, a voice called out:  
"Group D, begin testing!"
