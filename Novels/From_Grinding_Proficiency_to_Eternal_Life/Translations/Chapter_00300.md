# Chapter 300: Victory

Chu Cangming retreated ten zhang, wiping the bloodstain from his forehead. His composure from before had completely vanished, his eyes fixed intently on the Dragon Scale Armor, an eighth-grade divine weapon, worn by Xu Yunfan.

"So that's how it is..."

Chu Cangming's expression darkened, his former grace entirely gone. The current Xu Yunfan felt like a porcupine covered in barbs, leaving him with no way to strike.

His gaze shifted, moving from Xu Yunfan's neck to his head. His eyes narrowed dangerously as his twisted fingers crackled, the muscles and tendons adjusting as the suppressed qi gradually returned to its proper flow.

Although he couldn't accept engaging in another high-intensity battle, his body had already recovered to the point of being no different from normal.

Chu Cangming suddenly took a deep breath, and a faint golden mist seeped from the pores all over his body.

This was the phenomenon of the ninth stage of the *Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock*.

His twisted knuckles crackled like popping beans, flowing like water.

Bi Yuan, watching from the sidelines, had his pupils contract, a look of seriousness appearing in his eyes.

"Flowing Water Sword..."

*Clang!*

The faint golden mist seeping from Chu Cangming's pores suddenly solidified, transforming into nine golden threads that entwined his long sword.

As the blade trembled, it actually emitted the sound of a surging river, and the originally fierce and unchivalrous sword intent suddenly turned gentle and continuous!

His fingers now stretched out like agile snakes, moving in tandem with the long sword. The trajectories it drew left winding water trails in the air.

These water trails were not afterimages, but the supreme realm of the Dao Sect's secret martial art, "Condensing Qi to Form Shape." Each trail concealed seven layers of sword force.

The moment Xu Yunfan's Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel touched the water trail, the dragon patterns on the cudgel seemed to sink into a quagmire, and the force it emitted was being dissolved layer by layer.

*Swoosh!*

Chu Cangming's wrist lightly spun, and the sword's edge suddenly split into three streamer-like sword energies.

One entangled the cudgel, one locked his feet, and the last one went straight for his brow. It was the killing move of the Flowing Water Sword Technique, "Triple Waves."

Bi Yuan, watching the fight, had his fingers unconsciously twitching slightly, his eyelids lowered so that his expression was unreadable.

On the擂台, Xu Yunfan instantly retreated explosively. The Dragon Scale Armor emitted a harsh grating sound, and fine beads of blood seeped from the gaps between the scales.

That seemingly soft stream of sword energy was, in reality, as heavy as a thousand jun!

*Roar!!*

At the critical moment, the sound of a dragon's chant and a tiger's roar suddenly echoed from within Xu Yunfan's body.

The strand of pure yang true qi, refined after the perfection of the *Pure Yang One Qi Technique*, now flowed through his four limbs and eight meridians like the sun melting snow.

He actively released the disguise of the *Dragon and Tiger Breathing Technique*. The auras of the *Muscle and Marrow Cleansing Technique*, pure yang true qi, *Nine曜 Swallowing Qi Technique*, and *Three Jiao Sword Nurturing Technique* erupted like a volcanic eruption.

The dragon patterns on the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel came completely to life. The temperature of the cudgel soared to a terrifying degree, and the snow within three zhang instantly vaporized.

Xu Yunfan's heart paused for a moment, but his gaze immediately became resolute.

He could take this hit. He had to hide the Life-Death Seal if possible!

Moreover...

When Chu Cangming's sword energy pressed down upon him, Xu Yunfan made a move that caused the entire audience to gasp in surprise.

He abandoned defense for offense, throwing the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel like a javelin towards the most concentrated point of the sword energy.

This seemingly suicidal move concealed a profound mystery.

The hidden force from the *Nine Profound Flood Dragon Cudgel Technique*, wrapped around the cudgel's tail, erupted the moment it touched the vortex. Nine dragon-shaped qi forces tore a crack in the structure of the sword force.

Xu Yunfan seized the opportunity to charge forward, facing Chu Cangming, who was slightly surprised, never having expected Xu Yunfan to spot the weakness in his concealed qi at a glance.

Before him, Xu Yunfan's hands formed a hammer shape, executing the most basic starting stance of the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique, "Milky Way Falling to the Earth."

*Thud!*

This straightforward punch slammed into Chu Cangming's chest, yet it produced the sound of metal clashing.

As Xu Yunfan's finger bones trembled, the light of the Sky Silkworm Silver Silk Armor appeared from under Chu Cangming's Daoist robe.

He couldn't help but raise an eyebrow, but he wasn't surprised.

As the chief direct disciple of the Dao Sect's Sect Master lineage, it was normal for Chu Cangming to have a divine weapon and precious armor protecting his body.

But the true killing intent of this punch lay in the sword force nurtured by the *Three Jiao Sword Nurturing Technique* for a long time. Although the silver silk armor blocked most of it, a small portion still penetrated his internal organs along the undefended points through the punch's force, exploding into thirty-six tiny sword glows within Chu Cangming's body.

*Pfft!*

As Chu Cangming spewed a mist of blood, he stumbled backward and suddenly changed his move. His body shifted like a phantom, and his long sword shot straight for Xu Yunfan's back.

This move, Earth Dragon's Roll, was originally a hidden weapon technique. Now, wielded by Chu Cangming with his personal sword, its speed was so fast it left an afterimage in the air.

At the moment of life and death, Xu Yunfan displayed an incredibly terrifying fighting instinct.

Though startled, he was not panicked. Under the resonance of his qi and blood, his golden marrow stirred, and his force erupted, drawing the Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel back from mid-air. The great tendons on his neck tightened like bowstrings, and the wall-running specialty from his perfected Flying Scissor Legs allowed him to perform a miraculous鹞子翻 (鹞子翻 - a type of acrobatic flip, often translated as 'sparrow hawk flip' or similar, but 'aerobatic flip' or 'mid-air flip' works here) in the air.

At the same time, Xu Yunfan, in mid-air,顺势借着翻转之力 (shùnshì jièzhe fānzhuǎn zhī lì - using the momentum of the flip), swung his heavy cudgel.

The sparks from the second collision of cudgel and sword scattered like blacksmith's sparks.

This time, the two were actually evenly matched.

Just as Chu Cangming prepared to gather his qi and attack again, Xu Yunfan suddenly let out a long cry.

The mixed and varied techniques within his body now reached a subtle balance. The *Life-Death Seal* cultivation made his mind and body one; the true qi of the *Pure Yang One Qi Technique*; the blood and qi of the *Nine曜 Swallowing Qi Technique*; and the golden marrow force of the *Muscle and Marrow Cleansing Technique* achieved the resounding of jade bones.

The Flaming Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel in Xu Yunfan's hand suddenly burst forth with mountain-shaking power. This move, which combined the "Mountain Shattering Stance" of the *Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique* and the "Dragon Raising Its Head" variation of the *Eight荒 Dragon Fall Cudgel Technique*, completely broke through the conventional boundaries of Dao Sect martial arts.

*Clang!*

In the final collision, the long sword spun out ten zhang, deeply embedding itself in the boundary stele of the Xuanxiao Peak training grounds.

Chu Cangming stumbled back seven steps before stabilizing his figure. He looked down to see the breastplate of his armor shattered like a spider's web, with scorch marks from the pure yang true qi emitting a pungent green smoke.

This divine weapon and precious armor had actually been damaged by this single cudgel strike.

And the tip of Xu Yunfan's cudgel rested steadily on Chu Cangming's shoulder. The dragon patterns on the cudgel writhed on its body like living creatures, ready to deliver a fatal blow at any moment.

"Senior Brother Chu, I have won."

Xu Yunfan's calm voice rang out on the擂台.

The two had exchanged no more than ten moves, yet each move was an all-out effort, fraught with danger.

In the dead silence of the entire arena, the sound of falling snow could be heard clearly.

Cui Yu couldn't help but widen his eyes.

Bi Yuan sat in the main seat, the hem of his Daoist robe moving without wind. This ninth-realm Grandmaster had unconsciously released his aura during the duel.

The disciples of the thirty-six peaks were collectively speechless. They finally understood why the Sect Master had said this boy could "inherit the ancients and succeed the sages."

Chu Cangming suddenly laughed, his laughter shaking the snow from the pine branches.

He reached up to wipe the blood from the corner of his mouth and solemnly cupped his fist. "This one cudgel of yours, Senior Brother, deserves the words 'All Laws Return to the Source'."

When Xu Yunfan retracted his cudgel and returned the salute, he realized his right arm had taken on an unnatural curve. The rebound force from that combined technique just now had actually caused cracks in his arm bone, which had already reached the marrow-cleansing stage.

He kept his expression unchanged, his muscles tightening slightly, and with a *snap*, the bone instantly returned to its place.

(I'm too tired today, I'll work hard tomorrow, thank you all!)
