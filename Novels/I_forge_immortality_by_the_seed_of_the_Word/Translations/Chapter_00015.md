# Chapter 15: Inheritance Compatibility and the Five Viscera Water Origin Guide (Combined)

In just three to five breaths, the emerald-green spirit boat expanded to over two zhang in length, emitting a powerful spiritual fluctuation.

Zhang Jing watched this scene with amazement. It was his first time seeing a legendary magical artifact.

"Junior brothers, come aboard quickly," Senior Brother Lu said as he stepped onto the spirit boat, smiling at Zhang Jing and Deng Yuan.

"Yes, Senior Brother Lu!"

The two cautiously boarded the vessel. Once aboard, Zhang Jing realized that while the boat appeared large, its interior was quite cramped. The three of them barely fit standing together.

"Junior Brother Wang, we'll be off now."

"Safe travels."

Below, Instructor Wang waved goodbye. The spirit boat slowly ascended as a transparent spiritual light spread outward from beneath Senior Brother Lu's feet, swiftly enveloping the entire vessel.

After a slight adjustment in direction, the boat soared directly over the Seventh Temporary Courtyard.

Below, the little fatty remained motionless by the window, still immersed in melancholy. Suddenly, something passed before his eyes. He quickly looked up, his gaze fixed on the departing spirit boat above, his mouth falling open in surprise.

One of the figures looked familiar—wasn't that the guy carrying the luggage? And the other... could that be Deng An, one of the Four Great Prodigies?

The little fatty gasped in realization. It seemed he had misunderstood—this wasn't someone giving up on the assessment at all, but someone who had already passed it!

"No wonder he was so close to Ji Bochang. As they say, dragons don't mingle with snakes. The ancients didn't lie," the little fatty muttered, suddenly enlightened.

Wait a minute!

Did that mean that during Instructor Wang's lecture the other day, someone on par with the Four Great Prodigies had been sitting right beside him, and he hadn't even realized it?

"Good heavens, what have I missed?!" the little fatty wailed, his face crumpling in despair.

Meanwhile, aboard the spirit boat...

"Senior Brother Lu, does this... ahem... spirit boat always fly this slowly?" Zhang Jing couldn't help but ask, watching the painfully sluggish pace of their vessel. It was far from the swift, agile flying artifact he had imagined.

"Junior Brother, we can't go full speed within the Temporary Courtyard's boundaries. The spiritual fluctuations would disrupt the cultivation of those below," Senior Brother Lu explained with a gentle smile.

"I see. Thank you for clarifying, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said, understanding dawning on him.

As they spoke, the spirit boat finally exited the Temporary Courtyard's airspace.

"Junior brothers, hold on tight," Senior Brother Lu suddenly warned.

Before they could react, the boat shuddered and accelerated instantly, transforming into a streak of emerald light as it shot toward the Inheritance Pavilion.

"Wait, Senior Brother!" Zhang Jing and Deng An cried out in unison.

Hearing their voices, Senior Brother Lu turned with a mischievous glint in his eyes. "Yes, junior brothers?"

"Isn't this... a bit too fast?"

Before a magnificent nine-story pavilion, the spirit boat finally landed. Zhang Jing was the first to disembark, his face pale. Even now, his legs trembled uncontrollably.

It wasn't that Zhang Jing was afraid of heights—it was just that Senior Brother Lu's piloting had been downright reckless. The boat had darted across lakes, shot into the clouds, and zigzagged wildly like an untamed beast. If not for the protective spiritual barrier, they would have been flung off long ago.

"Junior Brothers Zhang and Deng, how was that? Exciting, wasn't it? Want to go for another ride?" Senior Brother Lu asked eagerly.

At those words, Zhang Jing and the still-shaken Deng An recoiled, hastily declining, "No, thank you, Senior Brother!"

Senior Brother Lu sighed in disappointment. "My boat is actually very safe..."

Then, as if remembering their purpose, he gestured to the towering pavilion before them. "Junior brothers, this is the Inheritance Pavilion. Let me take you inside."

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

As they approached, an inexplicable pressure settled over Zhang Jing. He looked up at the pavilion—dozens of zhang tall, its entire structure seemed forged from green-gold, adorned with countless intricate carvings of dragons, phoenixes, serpents, divine apes, and whales, all exuding an ancient, awe-inspiring aura.

Turning back, Zhang Jing noticed the pavilion stood in the center of an immense plaza, stretching beyond sight. In the distance, rows of buildings shimmered under the sunlight.

"Junior Brother Lu, you've finally arrived," greeted a white-haired young man in green robes, his sharp eyebrows resembling swords.

"Lu Yuan pays respects to Senior Brother Liu. I've safely delivered the two junior brothers from the Seventh Temporary Courtyard. I'll take my leave now," Senior Brother Lu said with a respectful bow, a hint of nervousness in his tone.

"Mm, thank you for your efforts, Junior Brother Lu."

The man addressed as 'Senior Brother Liu' nodded with a smile.

"Junior brothers, this is Senior Brother Liu Lizhi. He will oversee your selection of inheritances and arrangements during this period," Senior Brother Lu explained before quickly departing.

"Take care, Senior Brother Lu!" Zhang Jing and Deng An chorused.

Turning back to Senior Brother Liu, they bowed respectfully. "Zhang Jing (Deng An) greets Senior Brother Liu."

"No need for formalities. By the way, did Junior Brother Lu Yuan go crazy while piloting the spirit boat?" Senior Brother Liu asked with a peculiar expression.

"Are you referring to Senior Brother Lu's... spirited flying style?" Zhang Jing ventured cautiously.

"I knew it!" Senior Brother Liu's expression turned stern before softening into resignation. "I'll deal with him later."

With a sigh, he produced two white jade keys, which floated toward Zhang Jing and Deng An. "Junior brothers, these are keys to mid-grade inheritances. Once inside the secret repository, use them to unlock your chosen inheritance."

"Let me remind you—the Inheritance Pavilion houses 3,827 mid-grade inheritances, covering formations, alchemy, artifacts, talismans, medicine, divination, beast taming, puppetry, demons, ghosts, and deities. Each is incredibly precious, sought after by many outside these walls."

"But if you wish to enter the Inner Court and obtain the Dragon Lake Dao Academy's true core inheritances to pursue the Dao of Longevity, choose a cultivation method with high compatibility. Only then will you have a chance!"

"Otherwise, you'll remain stuck in the Outer Court, wasting your life until you return to dust after 120 years."

His tone grew solemn by the end.

"Senior Brother, what exactly is compatibility?" Deng An asked curiously before Zhang Jing could speak.

Zhang Jing glanced at Deng An in surprise. As a scion of a cultivation family, shouldn't he already know about compatibility?

"Excellent question!" Senior Brother Liu's gaze swept over them. "Since you've both mastered the basic visualization method, you should understand that cultivation begins with mortals using their innate spiritual wisdom to visualize the myriad spirits of heaven and earth, borrowing their power to transcend mundanity."

"Each person's innate spiritual wisdom differs, so different cultivation methods correspond to different spirits, yielding vastly different results."

"High compatibility means half the effort for double the results. Low compatibility means the opposite!"

Zhang Jing nodded thoughtfully. "Senior Brother, how do we determine our compatibility with a cultivation method? Surely not just by feeling?"

Senior Brother Liu laughed heartily. "If it were that simple, what would be the point of the Inheritance Pavilion?"

"Once inside, if you can approach within ten chi of a jade pillar containing a cultivation method, it means your compatibility is sufficient to practice it."

"Every additional chi signifies higher compatibility. Five chi indicates superior compatibility, making cultivation smooth and efficient. Three chi signifies exceptional compatibility—one in ten thousand!"

"Understood?"

Both nodded.

"Good. Follow me to the secret repository."

"Senior Brother, may I leave my luggage here? It might be inappropriate to bring it inside," Zhang Jing asked awkwardly.

"Give it to me."

Senior Brother Liu took the luggage, his hand brushing against a storage pouch at his waist.

"Here we are."

Before a bronze door, Senior Brother Liu said solemnly, "Go in. Remember, mid-grade cultivation methods are in the left-hand rows seven through nineteen. Junior Brother Deng, you'll enter first. Junior Brother Zhang, wait here."

"Understood."

"Yes, Senior Brother."

With a rumble, the bronze door opened. Deng An strode in confidently.

Outside, Senior Brother Liu turned to Zhang Jing. "Does your family have any cultivators?"

"No, my parents are ordinary people," Zhang Jing answered honestly.

"Oh?" Senior Brother Liu's eyes flashed with surprise. "Then your talent is truly remarkable—to earn a Grade B evaluation purely through your own aptitude!"

"Tsk, your batch has quite a few geniuses. The next month should be interesting."

"Senior Brother, what do you mean?" Zhang Jing asked, wide-eyed.

Senior Brother Liu merely smiled cryptically. "I can't say for sure, but it involves Dao merits. Focus on your cultivation after selecting your method today. Strive to officially guide qi into your body and reach the Qi Refining Realm before the 30-day assessment ends."

"The higher your cultivation, the more Dao merits you'll earn."

"This is the academy's welcome gift—a one-time opportunity. Normally, earning Dao merits is far more difficult."

"Dao merits?" Zhang Jing looked puzzled.

"Indeed. In the Outer Court, you'll need Dao merits for everything—resources, inheritances, and more."

"Even the instructors and Junior Brother Lu Yuan work hard to earn them."

Understanding dawned on Zhang Jing. So Dao merits were the academy's currency!

Just then, Deng An emerged.

"You've chosen already?" Zhang Jing asked in surprise.

"I was fortunate to find the right one quickly," Deng An replied, unable to hide his excitement.

"Which method did you choose? The pavilion needs to record it—though your compatibility remains private," Senior Brother Liu asked.

"Mid-grade cultivation method—'Upper Origin Feather Transformation Secret Art.'"

"Ah, that one. Junior Brother Zhang, you may enter now."

Clutching his jade key, Zhang Jing took a deep breath and stepped inside.

The sight that greeted him was breathtaking—countless translucent white jade pillars, each taller than a man, stretched endlessly in orderly rows.

Focusing, he headed left toward rows seven through nineteen.

Methodically, he examined each pillar's inscription and tested his compatibility.

"Three Radiances Transforming Yin True Explanation"—eight and a half chi. Passable.

"Mysterious Origin Five Grains Dao Divinity Method"—five and a half chi. Nearly superior compatibility.

But Zhang Jing pressed on. With his [Gathering Origin Spiritual Light] enhancing his cultivation speed, finding a method with even higher compatibility would be ideal.

Finally, at the second pillar of the eighteenth row:

"Five Viscera Water Origin Guide"—three and a half chi. Exceptional compatibility.

He'd found it.

Zhang Jing quickly retrieved his jade key.
