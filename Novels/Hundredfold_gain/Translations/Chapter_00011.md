# Chapter 11: Beast Infiltration  

Gazing at the words floating before his eyes, Qi Chuan's expression grew even more relaxed.  

Compared to the dull and tedious cultivation, although he didn't spend much time tending to the spiritual plants, he found it quite stress-relieving. After each session of labor, his mood improved, allowing him to immerse himself more deeply in his cultivation. Whether it was related to his mood or not, the critical multipliers that appeared afterward also seemed to increase slightly.  

"If this continues, I might even master the skills of a spiritual farmer without formal training and become a true one," Qi Chuan chuckled to himself.  

However, since he didn't devote much time to it, his progress was limited. He still couldn't be considered a qualified spiritual farmer—his skills remained rudimentary.  

Glancing at the sky, he noticed the clouds above had darkened from a dusky yellow to an even deeper hue, signaling the approach of night.  

"I wonder when the turmoil outside will finally settle?" Qi Chuan muttered helplessly as he took in the scene.  

Over the past year, although he had remained secluded on this mountain, news from the outside world occasionally reached him through his family, particularly via his second uncle.  

According to the rumors, the outside world had been in chaos lately, with some families even being completely wiped out. Among them was the Xiao Family—a powerful clan with a Foundation Establishment cultivator!  

To be fair, the Xiao Family had brought this upon themselves. They had dared to secretly covet the secret realm within the fifty-li forbidden zone, only to be discovered by the Fengyue Sect, which swiftly eradicated them.  

The "Mystic Sword True Lord" didn't even need to intervene personally. A few Foundation Establishment cultivators and several war vessels were enough to encircle and annihilate nearly two hundred members of the Xiao Family, including their Foundation Establishment ancestor. Only those who happened to be outside the clan at the time survived.  

This incident alone was a testament to the terrifying might of the Fengyue Sect.  

Looking back, the decision of the Qi Family's ancestor to consolidate their forces and restrict their members from venturing outside was undoubtedly the right move.  

Several smaller and weaker families had also been destroyed, though these weren't the work of the Fengyue Sect. These minor clans lacked the audacity to covet the forbidden zone's secret realm, so the sect didn't see them as threats.  

Qi Chuan suspected that these weaker families had fallen victim to opportunistic attacks by stronger clans, aiming to plunder their resources.  

If he were to entertain darker thoughts, even the Qi Family might have had a hand in it. After all, the Qi Family's Foundation Establishment ancestor and the late-stage Qi Refinement elders had no disciples monitoring their movements.  

Who could say for sure whether they had secretly acted? There was simply no way to verify it.  

Another notable development was the disappearance of several mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators from the Qi Family. According to the family's higher-ups, they had been killed by bandits or rogue cultivators while overseeing family businesses outside.  

The exact details remained unknown to Qi Chuan.  

Regardless, until the chaos outside subsided, Qi Chuan had no intention of leaving. Staying put on this mountain to cultivate was the only way to ensure his safety.  

"Though these past few days, Second Uncle has been away on a family mission—fortunately, it's an internal task, not an external one. For now, I'm the only one on the mountain. I need to be careful."  

Qi Chuan scanned the surroundings warily.  

This mountain had been bestowed upon his second uncle by the family. Given that his uncle was only at the third level of Qi Refinement, the spiritual energy here was relatively weak, located on the periphery of the Red Maple Valley's spiritual vein.  

There were no protective formations here.  

In fact, within the entire Red Maple Valley, only the main peak and its immediate vicinity were shielded by formations—likely a first-tier or perhaps a second-tier low-grade formation.  

Thus, even though the Qi Family had consolidated their forces and fortified the valley, unexpected incidents could still occur.  

Even as a Foundation Establishment clan, the Qi Family couldn't guarantee that no one would dare provoke them.  

After surveying the mountain and finding nothing amiss—even the distant peaks and the outer mortal settlements appeared peaceful—Qi Chuan returned to his room and closed the door.  

He ran the Evergreen Art a few times before preparing to sleep. As a second-level Qi Refinement cultivator, he still couldn't completely forgo sleep, though two hours were enough to restore his energy.  

"Rustle…"  

Just as Qi Chuan closed his eyes, a faint, almost imperceptible sound reached his ears.  

"Hmm?"  

At first, it resembled the rustling of leaves in the wind, but upon closer listening, subtle differences emerged.  

Had he not remained vigilant, he might have missed it entirely.  

"An intruder on the mountain? A thief? Or…"  

Qi Chuan narrowed his eyes but made no move. His breathing remained steady, feigning sleep as he listened intently.  

He was well aware of his limitations. At the second level of Qi Refinement, even with minor mastery over the basic elemental spells, his strength was still lacking in the grand scheme of Qi Refinement cultivators.  

If the intruder was powerful, a direct confrontation would be unwise.  

Besides, aside from a few low-value spiritual herbs, there was nothing of worth on the mountain. Losing a few herbs wouldn’t be a big deal.  

For all he knew, the intruder might leave upon finding nothing valuable, moving on to another peak.  

Yet, after waiting for a while, Qi Chuan sensed something amiss.  

"This… they aren’t leaving. And that sound—it almost sounds like…"  

*Snap!*  

Qi Chuan's eyes narrowed as he retrieved a Lightness Talisman from his robes. Activating it, a faint glow enveloped him before fading, leaving his body feeling weightless.  

Silently, he moved toward the door.  

---  

"Rustle…"  

In a spiritual herb field, a massive, scaly lizard paw pressed into the soil, producing only the faintest of sounds—easily mistaken for the wind.  

"Gulp…"  

The beast's grotesque maw chewed lazily on a mouthful of spiritual herbs before swallowing. Its bulbous, protruding lizard eyes darted warily toward the direction of the cottage. Detecting no movement, the first-tier lower-grade lizard demon beast took another step, ready to ravage the next patch of herbs.  

"Drip."  

As it moved, droplets of blue-green blood seeped from a vicious wound beneath its spiked back, near its right forelimb, staining the ground beneath.  

The lizard demon beast was injured.  

*Whoosh!*  

Just as it took another step, a sharp whistling sound cut through the air.  

Above its head, a fireball the size of half a fist materialized, its flickering flames scorching the surrounding air as it descended rapidly toward the beast's skull.  

The sudden attack froze the lizard demon in place, a chill shooting through its spine.
