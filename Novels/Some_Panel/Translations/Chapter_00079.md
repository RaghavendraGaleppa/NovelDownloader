# Chapter 78: Luo Xiong, the Killer, Willing to Be At Your Command

A single sword stroke determined both superiority and death.

Yang Ji held nothing back. The sword wings on his back transformed into a flying sword extending from his palm. Four types of Guizang Sword Intent poured out wildly, merging into the strongest sword he could currently unleash.

A sky-shattering sword intent explosively formed, sword qi piercing the heavens. Yang Ji's aura instantly rose dozens of times compared to before.

Rolling pressure, like a deep abyss merging into the sea, mixed with sword intent, surged in all directions, causing the air to instantly transform into countless tiny flying swords, boiling.

Yang Ji's strength, unleashed without reservation, caused the ashen faces of the white-haired elder and the others to change dramatically. This change was the joy of unexpectedly encountering a glimmer of hope from desperation.

"Such powerful sword intent! I didn't expect him to be this strong; he was hiding his true strength all along!" The white-haired elder and the others were overjoyed. With this sword unleashed, they instantly saw hope of survival.

"To think that among us, who came for the assessment, there's a genius of this caliber! This is truly a blessing from fate; perhaps our lives are not meant to end!" The refined middle-aged man stared at Yang Ji, his eyes sparkling with light, ecstatic.

"This guy is actually this strong..." The strong-suited girl's expression slightly changed. However, remembering that Yang Ji had awakened from the Dao Essence before her, she felt a slight sense of relief and didn't have as strong emotional fluctuations as the white-haired elder and the others. Yet, her eyes still flickered with surprise. At this moment, she truly realized Yang Ji's power.

Facing this sword, Di Xuan Sha was also moved. His speed was even faster, intending to instantly kill Yang Ji, who was frantically building up his momentum.

Yang Ji suddenly looked up. In this flash of lightning, he surprisingly also split into eight figures, arrayed in eight directions, forming a counter-encirclement against Di Xuan Sha.

Clang, clang, clang!

The two opponents' swords clashed thousands of times in an instant, erupting in a dazzling white sword light. When the sword light completely filled the entire secret chamber, the sounds of collision abruptly ceased, falling silent.

"What happened?" Everyone's expressions were grave, their hearts in their throats. They all looked at the dazzling sword light, wanting to discern the situation inside.

Soon, the sword light dispersed, revealing two figures standing in place, but with their backs turned.

Both remained silent. The white-haired elder and the others also held their breath, their hearts pounding, unsure of who had won.

But suddenly, *pfft!* Di Xuan Sha staggered. His robes exploded, torn by sword qi, countless streaks of blood light burst forth, and he coughed up large mouthfuls of blood. His essence, qi, and spirit instantly withered.

"He won?"

"Haha, he won!"

Everyone exchanged glances, overjoyed.

Di Xuan Sha wiped the blood from his mouth, slowly turned around, looked at Yang Ji, and said in a deep voice, "My clone's killing intent was strong, but unfortunately, the technique's mastery was still lacking. I didn't expect your Zhou Tian Displacement to reach the perfected stage, instantly shifting your body to unleash eight sword strikes, turning passivity into initiative. Your four forms of Guizang Sword Art have also reached a perfected fusion, making your sword techniques incisive."

"At such a young age, your mastery of techniques has already reached this level; your comprehension is very strong. Moreover, you showed no fear of my strong killing intent, your expression unchanged, calm and composed; your mental fortitude is also excellent. You are very good. The Boundless Dao Sect has gained another genius worthy of my attention."

"You killed my clone. I'll remember you. But I still don't know your name." Di Xuan Sha calmly looked at Yang Ji, his eyes surprisingly devoid of hostility, only showing appreciation.

"The killer, Luo Xiong!" Yang Ji turned and said.

"Luo Xiong? I'll remember you. Strong cultivators meet strong cultivators on the path, we are all fellow travelers; we will meet again." Di Xuan Sha gave Yang Ji a deep look. After saying this, the hidden sword qi on his body erupted again, his body instantly split into several pieces, scattering on the ground.

Immediately after, they transformed into eight wisps of black smoke, which then reverted back into the corpses of the eight city lords.

Seeing this scene, everyone was surprised.

"Who exactly is this Di Xuan Sha? Such a method is too inconceivable." The white-haired elder struggled to stand, stumbling to the corpses, his expression one of shock.

"This cultivation technique is too similar to the 'Heavenly Demon Divergent Heart Divine Art.' Rumor has it that this technique originated from the Heavenly Demon race. It can split one's mind into eight parts, all interconnected yet existing independently. Each part of the mind can control eight suitable individuals, and this isn't mere control, but rather preserving their independent thoughts and personalities. When the eight individuals merge, terrifying strength will erupt." The refined middle-aged man also approached, staring intently.

"Di Xuan Sha? Why do I feel like I've heard that name somewhere before?" The gloomy youth frowned, slowly approaching.

"Di Xuan Sha? Could he be Di Xuan Sha, the Dao Child of the Slaughtering Demonic Sect?" The white-haired elder's expression suddenly changed dramatically.

"Slaughtering Demonic Sect's Dao Child? How could someone of that stature appear here?" The smiling youth's faint smile froze, and cold sweat involuntarily broke out on his back.

"If the cultivation technique he used truly was the 'Heavenly Demon Divergent Heart Divine Art,' then this person calling himself Di Xuan Sha is likely the Slaughtering Demonic Sect's Dao Child, 'Di Xuan Sha'!" The black-haired elder took a deep breath.

"It must be so. Otherwise, how could a mere clone be so powerful? We actually encountered a clone of such a figure in our first assessment, and this fellow Daoist actually killed him with his formidable strength. We truly are fortunate despite our misfortune!"

Everyone still felt lingering fear. This ordeal was simply too perilous. How could they have imagined that a small place like Eight Profundities City harbored such a figure?

Even more astonishing to them was that among the people who came for the assessment with them, there was someone capable of killing a Dao Child's clone at the same cultivation level.

Everyone secretly scrutinized Yang Ji, their eyes flashing, wondering what they were thinking.

"Regardless of whether he was a Demonic Sect Dao Child's clone, he is dead now. The corpses of the eight city lords of Eight Profundities City are all here; please each take one." Yang Ji said calmly.

"Thank you, fellow Daoist." Everyone was overjoyed upon hearing this and bowed in thanks.

The strong-suited girl was the first to collect the corpse of the seductive woman, then flicked a ball of spiritual light towards Yang Ji: "This contains a lower-grade spiritual treasure. This Demonic Sect Dao Child was killed by you, so I can't just take this for nothing."

Seeing her serious expression, Yang Ji pondered for a moment, nodded, and then accepted it with a backhand motion.

"Hehe, I don't have a spiritual treasure on me, but I am willing to be at your command." The white-haired elder collected a corpse and bowed deeply to Yang Ji.

"I am also willing to be at your command." The black-haired elder glanced at Yang Ji, didn't hesitate, and like the white-haired elder, bowed deeply.

"I have no possessions of value, only this physical strength." The burly man chuckled, collected a corpse, and also bowed to Yang Ji.

"I am also willing." The gloomy youth hesitated for two breaths, then likewise said.

"I am also willing." The refined middle-aged man smiled gently and also bowed.

"Hmph! You guys are quite clever. Such a good opportunity, I don't want to miss it either. Honored Master, I am also willing to be at your command." The smiling youth chuckled softly.

"You wish to follow me?" Yang Ji was slightly startled.

"A genius like you, capable of contending with a Dao Child's clone, has boundless potential and limitless prospects. In the future, there's an eighty percent chance you'll achieve the True Disciple rank. If they miss this opportunity, they'll likely regret it immensely. It would be difficult to encounter a genius like you again in the future." The strong-suited girl slowly said.

"But I'm used to my freedom and don't want to be tied down by miscellaneous matters. You can take the corpses; I don't need any recompense from you." Yang Ji calmly shook his head.

"No, no, no. In the future, if you become a True Disciple, if the eight-hundred-mile Heavenly Domain is empty of people, that wouldn't be the aura of a True Disciple."

"In the future, if you become a Dao Child, with no one capable to use under you, and you have to do everything yourself, that would be the greatest failure for a Dao Child."

"Such an appearance would also make you unfit to compete for the Sect Master position, let alone wield the power of life and death and command a million disciples."

"In fact, building up your own influence has immense benefits for you. Both inside and outside the sect, it can solve many troubles and trivial matters for you."

"If you are willing to open your doors and welcome others, even the sect elders might flock to you in the future. If you are solitary and independent, even if others have the intention to follow, they probably wouldn't approach."

"The path of cultivation emphasizes human relationships and social connections. If one could cultivate to immortality alone through bitter cultivation, then you wouldn't have joined a Dao Sect in the first place. Building your own force, helping each other on the path to longevity, having people share your worries and solve your problems, will make things much easier for you."

The strong-suited girl laughed.
