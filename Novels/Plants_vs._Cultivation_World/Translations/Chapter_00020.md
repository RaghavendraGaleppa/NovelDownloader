# Chapter 20: Enhancement of Solar Essence Quality  

Gu Mo had initially estimated that the seeds he planted would take at least three to five days to sprout. However, to his surprise, the seeds sown in the spiritual field began breaking through the soil within a single day.  

This unexpected result puzzled Gu Mo at first, but he quickly realized the reason. His earlier estimate had been based on the assumption of a low-grade first-tier spiritual field. In reality, his field was a mid-grade first-tier one. The higher the grade of the spiritual field, the greater its influence on the growth of spiritual plants.  

Moreover, meticulous management of the spiritual field could further accelerate plant growth. The best way to manage the field was through the five exclusive spells of spiritual farmers—techniques refined over countless generations and proven to benefit plant development.  

"If that's the case, the Spirit Jade Rice won't take six months to mature—it'll be ready in five," Gu Mo recalculated, using the mid-grade first-tier field and his mastery of the spiritual farming spells as the new benchmark. The result showed that the rice could mature a full month earlier.  

Harvesting every five months would significantly ease Gu Mo's financial strain. Additionally, with a three-year rent-free period, all the field's yields during that time would belong solely to him. The thought filled Gu Mo with motivation.  

In the following days, Gu Mo split his time between managing the field and studying the remaining spiritual farming spells, aiming to master all five.  

As for cultivation, he had no immediate plans to begin. First, he needed to grow the Sunspirit Flowers in the field to ensure a steady supply of Solar Essence. He wouldn't use this essence for cultivation either—instead, he would save it to purchase a second Sunspirit Flower from the vending machine in the Black Mist Space.  

Once he accumulated five Sunspirit Flowers, his cultivation speed would rival that of a cultivator with a superior spiritual root. Thus, the slight delay in his progress now was inconsequential.  

"Junior Brother Gu Mo! A letter for you."  

One day, as Gu Mo inspected his field, a servant disciple from the Spiritual Plant Hall approached and handed him a letter.  

"Thank you!"  

Gu Mo accepted it. Within the Qinglu Sect, the only people who would write to him were Yao Shifeng and a few others. Sure enough, the letter was from Yao Shifeng.  

The distances between the sect's various peaks were vast, making ordinary messenger paper cranes ineffective. Higher-grade communication talismans were prohibitively expensive for newly enrolled servant disciples, so traditional letters became the most practical method.  

This method wasn't slow, either. Some servant disciples with flying swords took on letter-delivery side jobs, earning extra income. With their speed, letters could reach any peak within a day.  

"The gathering has been postponed."  

Gu Mo opened the letter and nodded slightly. Yao Shifeng explained that their reunion would be delayed, as each of them was swamped with tasks after joining their respective peaks. With all five scattered across different mountains and lacking flying swords, travel alone would consume too much time.  

Glancing at his field, Gu Mo agreed that now wasn't the time for socializing. The field required daily irrigation through the Minor Cloud-Rain Technique. Unless he could make a round trip within a day, leaving would disrupt the field's maintenance.  

As time passed, Gu Mo tended to the field day after day, and the plants rewarded his diligence with robust growth.  

Most importantly, after three months, the hundreds of Sunspirit Flowers finally bloomed with golden disks. But this was only the beginning—the flowers now needed a prolonged period to mature their seeds.  

For Gu Mo, however, this didn't matter. With the Sunspirit Flowers serving as cover, he could finally plant the Sunflower.  

By the next day, the Sunflower had already grown to match the surrounding Sunspirit Flowers in size. Their appearances were nearly identical, with the only difference lying in their disks—the Sunspirit Flowers had traditional sunflower-like disks, while the Sunflower's disk resembled a miniature sun.  

Hidden among hundreds of Sunspirit Flowers, this subtle distinction was easy to overlook.  

At sunset the following day, Gu Mo harvested another portion of Solar Essence. This batch appeared more condensed than the one from the potted plant.  

This trend continued in the following days. Each day, the ethereal miniature sun formed by the Solar Essence grew slightly more solid, until it reached a certain threshold and stabilized.  

The change intrigued Gu Mo. To understand the cause, he refined a portion of the Solar Essence and was astonished to find that it equaled three days of his usual cultivation.  

Previously, one portion had been worth two days of cultivation. Now, from the same Sunflower, the yield had increased to three days. The only difference was the environment—the first batch came from a pot enhanced with three low-grade spirit stones, while the second grew in a mid-grade first-tier spiritual field.  

Clearly, the enhancement in Solar Essence quality stemmed from the field's superior spiritual energy. If planted in an even higher-grade field, would the Solar Essence become even more refined?  

For now, Gu Mo dismissed thoughts of seeking a higher-grade field. Securing this mid-grade first-tier field had already made him the envy of many servant disciples. A high-grade first-tier field was beyond his reach at this stage.  

The improved Solar Essence meant that with just three Sunflowers, Gu Mo could harvest three portions daily, granting him nine times his normal cultivation speed—equivalent to that of a superior spiritual root.  

Additionally, this enhanced Solar Essence was more effective at dispersing the black mist in the Black Mist Space. The only downside was that the vending machine still counted the threefold Solar Essence as a single portion, just like the previous twofold version.  

"Less than a month, and I'll have fifty portions of Solar Essence." Gu Mo tallied his current stock. In twenty more days, he could purchase a second Sunflower.  

With two Sunflowers producing two portions daily, he would only need twenty-five more days to buy a third. At that point, his cultivation speed would match that of a genius with a superior spiritual root.  

If he held out and followed his original plan to gather five Sunflowers, his cultivation speed would reach fifteen times the norm—surpassing even the limits of a superior spiritual root. He wondered how such a speed would be classified in the cultivation world.
