# Chapter 2: The Old Han Family is About to Prosper!

Not only that, but his bones and muscles also began to feel hot and itchy, and his appetite grew significantly. This physical condition persisted for seven days before subsiding. Han Zhen could feel that his Tiger Roar Fist had improved considerably, and his body had undergone inexplicable changes.

Without harming his body, Han Zhen continued to train to the maximum extent possible. As Fatty Han's nephew, Han Zhen wasn't treated to a lavish meal of meat and fish every day, but he was always well-fed. Each time he finished a set of punches, the Heaven Rewards Diligence providence would glow, and Han Zhen could feel his fist arts rapidly improving. Regarding the Seven Mysteries Sect's inner disciple examination a few days later, Han Zhen felt no pressure at all. In fact, he was ready to emerge victorious and secure a direct recommendation to the Seven Absolutes Hall.

Children his age, even those from wealthy families, at most only practiced some basic martial arts, capable only of bullying country children like Han Li who came from the mountains.

Green Ox Town wasn't large, boasting only one main road running east-west. The Spring Fragrance Tavern was located at the easternmost end of this street. A carriage sped into Green Ox Town, eventually stopping in front of the Spring Fragrance Tavern. Hearing the playful chatter of old customers outside, Han Zhen knew that Third Uncle had returned. Wiping away his sweat, he quickly ran out from the backyard. Standing beside the carriage, apart from the smiling Third Uncle, was a dark-skinned child who looked to be about ten years old. Han Zhen quickly came to the front of the hall and saw Third Uncle with Han Li beside him. Han Li's gaze held clear envy as he looked at Han Zhen.

Fatty Han pointed at Han Zhen and said to Han Li, "Little Li, do you remember your Brother Zhen?"

"Yes, I remember, Brother Zhen-er," Han Li replied, sounding very obedient.

"You two go inside with Brother Zhen and get some good rest to refresh yourselves. When the inner sect steward arrives, I'll call you out. Third Uncle needs to attend to the customers first." He then added with a stern tone, "Don't let Little Li wander off! There are too many dubious characters in town. If he gets lost, I won't be able to explain it to your Second Uncle!" Fatty Han emphasized his warning to Han Zhen. Only after escorting them to the backyard did he feel relieved enough to return to the tavern's main hall.

Han Li, having been on horseback for several days, was clearly exhausted. However, upon seeing the wooden dummy in the backyard, his spirits instantly lifted. Watching Han Li, who was curious about everything since coming from the mountains into the city, Han Zhen couldn't help but demonstrate a few moves in front of him.

"This is my wooden dummy for practicing martial arts. Little Li, do you want to give it a try?"

Han Li showed no shyness at all, nodding eagerly like a chick pecking at rice.

"Watch closely!"

With a *thwack*, Han Zhen snapped a towel onto the smaller wooden dummy like a whip, then performed a set of Tiger Roar Fist moves, flowing smoothly and whistling through the air.

After watching, Han Li tried to mimic the moves, but he applied too much force and almost broke a finger. Han Zhen quickly stopped him. He grabbed Han Li's hand and saw it was only a minor scrape, which made him sigh in relief. He certainly couldn't let Han Li get injured because of him and affect the examination in a few days. Doctor Mo was Han Li's life mentor, and this period was a very important experience for him.

Han Zhen didn't let Han Li touch the wooden dummy again. Instead, he started telling him the Jianghu stories Third Uncle had recounted many times. The Seven Mysteries Sect, also known as the Seven Absolutes Sect, once dominated Jing Province for decades. After its Sect Master, Venerable Seven Absolutes, passed away, its strength plummeted. A century ago, it eventually relocated to Cloudmist Mountain, the most secluded part of Jing Province. Nevertheless, with three to four thousand disciples, it remained one of the two true hegemons of the region.

The only local power capable of contending with the Seven Mysteries Sect was the Wild Wolf Gang, a group of bandits who had refused amnesty. They frequently clashed with the Seven Mysteries Sect, which was far wealthier than them. The Wild Wolf Gang greatly coveted several of the Seven Mysteries Sect's affluent territories, which was a constant headache for the Seven Mysteries Sect Master. This was also a major reason why the Seven Mysteries Sect had been expanding its recruitment in recent years. Interspersed with these tales were plots adapted from martial arts novels from Han Zhen's previous life, making Han Li yearn for the Jianghu world.

As the stories continued, dusk quickly fell. Han Zhen took Han Li to dinner and then settled him in his own room. After watching Han Zhen go out to continue his training, Han Li finally succumbed to fatigue and collapsed onto Han Zhen's bed, falling into a deep sleep. That night, the two squeezed onto the same bed. In the middle of the night, Han Zhen was even punched twice by Han Li, only to realize that Han Li was merely dreaming. In his dream, Han Li imagined himself in splendid robes, his fists like cast iron, beating up the blacksmith's son from the village—the one he could never defeat—who cried out in misery, utterly devoid of dignity. He continued to relish the memory even after waking up the next day.

From that day on, Han Li became Han Zhen's shadow. He was extremely envious and admiring of Han Zhen, his older brother who possessed both martial arts skills and extensive knowledge. That day, Han Zhen explained to Han Li the important points to remember for the inner sect examination.

"Little Li, you must remember, no matter what, you have to persevere until the very end during the examination. Even if you use every last ounce of strength, you must let them see your tenacity."

Han Li firmly committed Han Zhen's advice to memory.

On the third day, a carriage from the Seven Mysteries Sect pulled up in front of the tavern. Inside the tavern's main hall, a scrawny man in his forties was guzzling tea from a teapot and bowl. Fatty Han, along with Han Zhen and Han Li, respectfully went forward to greet him.

"Protector Wang, why have you personally led the team this time?"

"Hmph, the roads haven't been peaceful lately, so we needed to strengthen our escort. Enough chatter, are these two the children you're recommending?"

Having been fatigued by days of continuous travel, Protector Wang was quite irritable. Unlike three days prior when he first arrived, Han Li had also changed into a set of satin clothes. These were Han Zhen's old clothes, discarded when he outgrew them, and they fit Han Li quite well.

"Yes, yes, they are both my nephews from the family. The older one is twelve, and the younger one is ten. I hope Protector Wang will look after them on the journey."

As he spoke, Fatty Han deftly took out a weighty pouch from his person and discreetly handed it over. Protector Wang accepted it without batting an eyelid, his expression only then softening as he carefully scrutinized the two children. The younger one was dark-skinned, scrawny, and unremarkable. The slightly older one, however, appeared valiant and extraordinary, with broad shoulders, long arms, and calluses on his hands from martial arts training. Protector Wang had no doubts about Han Zhen's age; he knew Fatty Han wouldn't dare to lie.

Protector Wang walked up to Han Zhen. The boy showed not a hint of timidity. He pressed his large, thick palm firmly onto Han Zhen's shoulder, and Han Zhen didn't budge an inch. Protector Wang felt Han Zhen's bones, then gripped his arm and examined his fists.

"Ape arms, tiger back, wolf waist! Top-grade bone structure! Minor accomplishment in fist arts!" he exclaimed. "Good! Good! Good! Fatty Han, you're blessed! Barring any unforeseen circumstances, your nephew here can be directly recommended to the Seven Absolutes Hall."

As he spoke, he handed the money pouch back. Discovering such a promising talent and safely bringing him to the sect was a convenient favor, and the monetary reward from the sect for this discovery would make this small sum utterly insignificant. Han Zhen's face also showed a look of pleasant surprise. So, the strange changes in his body these past few days were actually due to bone structure transformation, not some mishap in his training. Although Fatty Han didn't understand what "tiger back, wolf waist" implied, he had certainly heard of the Seven Absolutes Hall. Every single person who emerged from there was a distinguished individual.

"Protector Wang, please take it. The children are still young, and I hope you'll look after them in the future."

Protector Wang no longer refused. After calling out to Han Zhen and saying a few words, Han Li also followed Han Zhen into the carriage. Fatty Han watched the departing carriage, eager to immediately share the good news with his brothers.
