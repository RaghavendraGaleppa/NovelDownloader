**Chapter 16: A Tiger Stranded in the Plains**

Three days later, Han Zhen emerged from the Seven Fiends Hall, carrying a bag containing several books. The old man, feigning sleep in a chair, merely glanced at Han Zhen before closing his eyes to continue resting, paying him no mind. He allowed Han Zhen to openly carry the Seven Fiends Hall's unique secret manuals out.

Descending from the mountain peak where the Seven Fiends Hall was located, Han Zhen walked leisurely along a small path through the forest, heading towards the Divine Hand Valley. Han Zhen had never been inside the Divine Hand Valley before. Firstly, he had never suffered an injury or illness since he began martial arts training. Secondly, Han Zhen didn't want Dr. Mo to know about his close relationship with Han Li. He wished to avoid giving the inherently suspicious Dr. Mo even a shred of doubt, which might expose the secret that Han Zhen could also cultivate the Everspring Arts. At that time, his strength was insufficient, so he had to be cautious at every turn.

Therefore, every time Han Zhen met Han Li, they would arrange it in advance, doing their best to avoid Dr. Mo's eyes and ears. This time, Han Zhen had asked someone to deliver a message to Han Li to arrange a meeting, but he hadn't received a reply from Han Li even after waiting two days. Moreover, calculating the time, Zhang Tie's Elephant Armor Art should be on the verge of a breakthrough. Aside from his arrangement with Zhang Tie, Han Zhen also didn't want Zhang Tie to be refined into a puppet, which would obstruct his plans.

Han Zhen decided to personally go to Divine Hand Valley to see Han Li and Zhang Tie, to see if anything unexpected had happened. He would also scout the location in advance, preparing for any preemptive actions. Today was different from the past; now, Han Zhen's status and strength were no longer something Dr. Mo could casually manipulate. Naturally, he no longer needed to appear overly cautious.

The Divine Hand Valley was not only remote, but there was also only one path leading into it. After several twists and turns, Han Zhen didn't see the valley itself. Instead, he saw a clearing carved out by human hands, with several newly constructed bamboo houses. On a rocking chair by the entrance of one of the bamboo houses, a gaunt, sallow-faced old man with white hair fastened by a hairpin lay comfortably. He held a book in his hand, reading with relish, seemingly oblivious to Han Zhen's approaching footsteps.

However, as Han Zhen passed the path in front of the main house and continued towards Divine Hand Valley, a vibrant green bamboo branch suddenly flew past him and impaled itself into a nearby tree trunk. In the instant Han Zhen's attention was drawn, the old man appeared before him with ghostly steps.

"Which hall's disciple are you? Didn't your master or elders tell you that Divine Hand Valley is temporarily sealed off?!" He said with a cold tone, his body hunched, one hand holding the book while the other was clasped behind his back.

Even though he had never seen him, looking at the old man who seemed as if he could collapse at any moment, Han Zhen was certain that the one blocking his path was Dr. Mo, Mo Juren.

But why would Dr. Mo suddenly appear here? Han Zhen recalled that Dr. Mo had sealed off Divine Hand Valley for a full two years to allow Han Li to cultivate diligently without external disturbances. Even treating patients was done outside the valley, so it seemed this bamboo house was built for that purpose. In that case, Dr. Mo would definitely not let him meet Han Li. A plan suddenly formed in Han Zhen's mind.

Seeing Han Zhen frozen in place, seemingly with no intention of leaving, Dr. Mo's expression darkened. "What? Do you need me to invite you to leave?" His words were filled with an unquestionable tone.

"I wouldn't dare." Han Zhen cupped his fists, yet showed no sign of leaving. "It's just that I had an prior arrangement with Han Li, a reason I must see him. I implore Dr. Mo to make an exception."

Hearing that Han Zhen had come to find Han Li, Dr. Mo's impatience grew. He had finally managed to make that brat Han Li settle down and return to a desperate state of cultivation; how could he allow outside matters to interfere with him?

"Hmph!" Dr. Mo flicked his sleeve and turned away. "Did you not understand my words? If you don't leave now, don't blame this old man for being ruthless." He circulated his true qi, stirring up a gust of air, intending to make this junior retreat in the face of difficulty. After all, he was on someone else's territory; injuring a disciple without reason would require a lot of explanation.

If it were an ordinary disciple, they truly would have been intimidated by Dr. Mo's move. However, for the current Han Zhen, this slight force was nothing more than a gentle breeze. Instead, it allowed Han Zhen to discern a bit of Dr. Mo's true condition: his strength had been greatly diminished because he had been afflicted by the Yin Soul Curse.

Dr. Mo turned his head back to see Han Zhen standing rooted to the spot, his eyes showing no intention of backing down. Dr. Mo felt a loss of face. Just as he was about to strike heavily to punish him, the young man suddenly spoke: "Han Li is this junior's younger brother. We agreed to meet once a month. This time Han Li hasn't come, and Elder Mo is still preventing this junior from seeking him. Has something happened to my brother Han Li?"

"If Elder Mo doesn't provide a reasonable explanation and let this junior see my brother, even if I report this to the Sect Master, this junior will be in the right!" Han Zhen's tone also grew heavier, displaying a deep concern for Han Li's current situation.

Dr. Mo recalled the reports from the Cloud-Winged Bird; Han Li did indeed leave Divine Hand Valley once a month. However, as long as Han Li remained within the Seven Mysteries Sect's territory, Dr. Mo paid little attention, nor did he care who Han Li met. All that mattered was that Han Li's progress in the Everspring Arts didn't fall behind.

Although Han Zhen spoke eloquently, Dr. Mo was truly enraged. He thought back to his past, when he dominated both the righteous and unrighteous paths across Lanzhou — who dared speak to him like this? To think that a tiger stranded on the plains would be bullied by a junior who came right to his door. Mo Juren decided to teach Han Zhen what was meant by seniority and hierarchy.

"Hmph, are you threatening this old man?" A powerful aura surged from Mo Juren. "Forget reporting me; even if this old man kills an impudent junior like you, Wang Juechu wouldn't be able to say anything!"

This played right into Han Zhen's hands. He could use this opportunity to probe Mo Juren's methods, and if the chance arose, even strike lethally.

"Then Elder Mo, please feel free to try. This junior, Han Zhen, has heard that Elder Mo possesses considerable strength." Han Zhen said, "Since things have come to this, even if this junior accidentally kills Elder Mo, the Sect Master probably wouldn't be able to say much. I hope Elder Mo can give this junior a satisfying fight."

Han Zhen abandoned his previous respectful and humble demeanor. Under the activation of the "Mad Python Strength" secret technique, his arrogance bared its fangs.

"You are Han Zhen?!" Hearing Han Zhen reveal his identity and show no fear, Mo Juren finally recognized him. In the past few days, several severely injured disciples had suddenly been sent over, and even the Hall Master had been gravely wounded. The rumors of Han Zhen being a young hero and being appointed as the Young Sect Master had naturally reached his ears.

At this point, Mo Juren found himself in a difficult position. Han Zhen was no longer an ordinary disciple he could casually bully; both his strength and status allowed him to converse with Mo Juren as an equal. Should he use his true strength to show him that "beyond this heaven, there are other heavens"?

Mo Juren dismissed this thought. A fight out of pique would only cause his physical condition to rapidly deteriorate, leading him to die of exhaustion before that day even arrived.

Patience! He had to endure!

"Since the brothers are so close," Mo Juren thought, "then in the future, you can become a puppet and accompany Han Li forever!"
