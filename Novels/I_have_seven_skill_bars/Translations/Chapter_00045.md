**Chapter 45: Concern for the Horse-folk**

The Horse-folk are different from Human Cultivators. Almost all Horse-folk have never formally joined any sect, instead maintaining a cooperative relationship with various sects. Every sect within the Sect Domain possesses large tracts of spirit fields, and can rely on these fields to produce vast amounts of cultivation resources. While cultivation resources do grow naturally in the wilderness, they are ultimately not as stable or safe as those within a sect. Therefore, many non-evil cultivation races have flocked to the Sect Domain, banding together for warmth, mutual cooperation, better survival and cultivation, and to fight against evil cultivators. The Horse-folk are among them, but Human Cultivators, who created all this, naturally remain the dominant group in the Sect Domain.

In the Sect Domain, once the Horse-folk reach adulthood and pass through the rapid growth period of their cultivation and physical development, they head to the front lines to participate in battles against evil cultivators. With the speed of the Horse-folk, cultivators in the Sect Domain gain a significant advantage when facing evil cultivators. Whether acting as messengers to relay information or carrying sect cultivators into battle, they are extremely important and useful. However, underage Horse-folk like Ma Wen must remain within the sects, selling their "foot-power" to earn spirit rice, allowing themselves to grow faster. But the Horse-folk are inherently fewer in number than human cultivators, and underage Horse-folk are naturally even scarcer. Undertaking the transportation for the entire Sect Domain naturally presents difficulties.

Ding Rui and Ma Wen, along with three other Horse-folk, went into the forest. With practiced ease, they crafted two more sets of equipment. As they parted ways, Ding Rui told Ma Wen that if possible, he was willing to craft these for all Horse-folk. Ma Wen immediately stated that he would ask for the opinions of all underage Horse-folk. Ding Rui wasn't worried that the Horse-folk wouldn't give him a share, as the sect managed such transactions quite strictly. Nor was he concerned that others would imitate his creation of these items, because he had already planned to hand over the information about the saddles and stirrups to the logistics department in a few days. Such inventions could also earn him certain resource rewards, and a considerable amount at that, possibly even exchanging them for other, better items. Although resources are the most fundamental things on the path of cultivation, there are also many treasures that are no worse, or even stronger, than ordinary resources! This was also the greatest source of extra income for cultivators in the miscellaneous hall. Once handed over to the sect, the sect would be able to produce and improve these items themselves, distributing them to all Horse-folk who needed them.

It was only then that Ding Rui realized he still didn't know why Mu Tian and Ma Wen had come to find him. He quickly asked, "Oh right, I forgot to ask, Senior Brother Mu, why have you come today?"

Mu Tian smiled, "Junior Brother, you must have guessed it already, haven't you?"

Ding Rui looked at Mu Tian's smile, then at the mysterious and excited Ma Wen. He indeed had a guess in his heart and couldn't help but probe, "Is it... for the saddles and stirrups?"

Mu Tian nodded, "Exactly. This time, we came precisely for these implements you created, Junior Brother. Are they called saddles and stirrups? Hmm... indeed, those are fitting names."

Although he was mentally prepared, Ding Rui still found it somewhat incredible after hearing Mu Tian's words.
