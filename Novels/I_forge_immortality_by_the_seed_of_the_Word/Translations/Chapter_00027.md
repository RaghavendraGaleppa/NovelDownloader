# Chapter 27: The Battle for Top Ten, First Display of Fangs (Bonus Chapter)

"Begin the third stage!"

A thunderous voice echoed across the skies.

For the first time, this voice carried a rare trace of excitement!

The entire crowd instantly fell silent as countless gazes surged like tidal waves toward the ten demonstration platforms.

At the periphery.

The figures seated on the foremost ten stone platforms all raised their heads simultaneously. Their intense spiritual energies pressed against each other, faint sparks of lightning crackling between them.

It's time!

Without hesitation, Zhang Jing took a decisive step forward.

At this moment.

The sixteen who had been waiting all this time moved with uncanny synchronization. Their expressions varied—some profound, some excited, some expectant—but not a single one showed fear or apprehension.

The air was so still that only the heavy footsteps could be heard.

With each step closer to the demonstration platform.

Zhang Jing felt his emotions gradually rising in excitement.

Just then.

Two sharp whistles of wind sounded, and Zhang Jing felt as if two dark shadows had flashed past his eyes.

What was that—?

He stopped in his tracks and followed the sound with his gaze.

Now, standing on the first demonstration platform's east and west sides were two figures—one male, one female—their bodies flickering with spiritual light.

"Chen Xiandao, Shen Qingqing."

Zhang Jing murmured these two names that were both familiar and strange, his gaze nearly solidifying on them.

The other thirteen also chose to stop where they were, wanting to see just how formidable these two truly were.

Senior Brother Liu watching from above didn't interrupt, merely observing quietly.

Boom—

As if they'd fought countless times before.

Without exchanging a single word, the two on the platform immediately attacked.

In an instant, Chen Xiandao—his body wreathed in crimson dao patterns, every movement carrying tremendous force and scorching spiritual light—closed in on Shen Qingqing.

But then Shen Qingqing swiftly formed a hand seal.

A flash of light, and she vanished from her original position.

The next moment, an eerie green wind suddenly arose on the platform. This wind rapidly coalesced into blades that shot toward Chen Xiandao with lightning speed.

The two exchanged blows.

The commotion grew increasingly terrifying.

Finally.

After a muffled grunt, Chen Xiandao calmly stepped off the first demonstration platform and walked straight to the center of the second platform, where he sat cross-legged and closed his eyes as if no one else existed.

Apparently confident no one would dare challenge him.

And indeed.

After the battle on the first platform concluded, the remaining participants began moving toward other platforms, with some eager individuals already mounting them.

But—

The third demonstration platform stood empty.

At this moment, a smile suddenly appeared on Zhang Jing's face as he slowly straightened his back.

His gaze fixed on the third demonstration platform.

Zhang Jing hadn't forgotten—aside from securing a top ten ranking and earning merit points, he also needed to use this opportunity to see if he could join one of the top-ranked mission teams.

What were those people looking at? What was the Dao Academy evaluating?

Naturally, it was their performance in this assessment.

With this in mind,

Zhang Jing strode directly toward the empty third demonstration platform.

If no one else dared, then he, Zhang, would not stand on ceremony.

The sound of footsteps echoed.

With Zhang Jing's movement, everyone's eyes instantly froze. Whether those currently engaged in combat on platforms or those observing below, the same thought simultaneously occurred to them:

Who is this guy?

Below the platform.

Ji Bochang watched Zhang Jing's movement and couldn't help rubbing his eyes.

He seemed to be verifying whether today's Brother Zhang was the same person as the Brother Zhang he'd known before.

Before long.

Zhang Jing stood at the center of the demonstration platform, quietly waiting.

Bewildered and skeptical gazes from all directions threatened to drown him.

Zhang Jing naturally understood why.

Although ranked third, because of the two A-grade prodigies, this third platform actually represented the top position among the numerous B-grade talents.

No one had stepped up earlier because everyone was eyeing this spot, unwilling to break the delicate balance.

Not far away.

Five pairs of eyes watched Zhang Jing intently.

A woman emerged from the group, her face brimming with confidence as she slowly ascended the third platform to stand opposite Zhang Jing.

Zhang Jing looked up.

The woman before him smiled gracefully, saluting with a heroic air as she said:

"I am Xu Wan."

"I am Zhang Jing."

Zhang Jing responded with equal courtesy.

"Daring to be the first to step here shows remarkable courage, Brother Zhang. I wonder if your strength matches it? My magic sword is exceptionally sharp—you'd best be careful."

As she spoke.

A delicate magic sword suddenly appeared in the woman's hand, its blade radiating an intensely concentrated sharpness that chilled the heart just to behold.

A dazzling flash.

The sword vanished from her hand, only to reappear right before Zhang Jing's eyes, its razor edge nearly piercing his throat.

Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened as his illusory mind's eye opened.

The flying sword's trajectory was instantly captured.

Hum—

Spiritual energy surged wildly in his dantian before flooding into the Water Cloud Shield.

The shield flickered faintly, materializing directly before the flying sword.

Clang!

The woman's flying sword was blocked by the Water Cloud Shield.

But the shield's dark spiritual light nearly shattered under the sword's terrifying sharpness.

First strike failed.

The woman controlled her sword like a swimming serpent, continuously darting around above Zhang Jing, searching for an opening.

The sword's emitted sharpness made every hair on Zhang Jing's body stand on end.

"Qi Refining second layer! What a sharp flying sword."

A glint of admiration flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

He'd known that anyone daring to compete for top ten wouldn't be ordinary.

With a thought.

The worn flying sword from his storage bag was summoned, black spiritual energy coiling around it. The sword transformed into a black streak, instantly appearing beside the woman's sword to deliver a fierce slash.

"What?"

Seeing Zhang Jing produce another flying sword besides the shield, the woman's eyes widened in shock, momentarily stunned.

Opportunity!

Zhang Jing used his magic tool sword to block the woman's sword while channeling more spiritual energy into the Water Cloud Shield.

The shield instantly transformed into a black streak, slamming toward the woman's delicate face like a heavy hammer.

A vicious wind arose!

The woman startled, frantically producing a talisman and activating it instantly.

A white protective glow enveloped her body.

Thud!

The Water Cloud Shield struck her protective light, only managing to make it waver.

A talisman as her trump card? Pity it's useless against me.

The Frostblade Technique enhanced with Sharpness is perfect for this.

A hint of smile appeared at Zhang Jing's eyes.

From the Five Techniques Spiritual River, a swimming spell-fish suddenly leaped, transforming into an intensely concentrated sharpness that coiled around Zhang Jing's right index finger.

A light tap of his finger.

The Frostblade Technique arrived in a flash, effortlessly shredding the woman's protective glow under her horrified gaze.

Next moment.

The Water Cloud Shield loomed ever larger in her vision.

Clang—

With an extraordinarily crisp sound, the woman was sent flying stiffly backward, a lump the size of half a fist instantly swelling on her pale forehead as her eyes rolled back—a truly pitiful sight.

Her flying sword immediately lost control, clattering onto the platform.

Hiss—

Witnessing this, both on and off the platforms, continuous sounds of sharply drawn breaths arose.

Whether due to his Frostblade Technique or not, Zhang Jing felt the surrounding temperature had noticeably dropped.

Wave after wave of complicated gazes were directed at Zhang Jing.

On the first platform, Shen Qingqing watched Zhang Jing's brutal method, her small mouth unconsciously falling open with shock in her eyes.

On the second platform.

Chen Xiandao's previously calm expression could no longer be maintained.

His face twisted as he struggled not to laugh, giving Zhang Jing a thumbs-up with one hand.

Below, Ji Bochang could only sigh deeply, feeling that while his friend's cultivation and combat strength were indeed outrageously strong, he might truly be beyond saving.

"Zhang Jing, do you need to rest?" Senior Brother Liu's voice, barely containing laughter, sounded in his ear.

"No need, Senior Brother."

Zhang Jing felt this battle hadn't consumed much spiritual energy, so he declined.

Just then.

Footsteps sounded.

Zhang Jing looked to see it was the tall, slender man who had nodded at him earlier.

The man gazed coldly at Zhang Jing and said icily:

"I am Xia Fangming. Brother Zhang must have heard of me."

"Xia Fangming?"

Realization dawned on Zhang Jing's face.

This guy was the first B-grade genius to master the Visualization Technique, his talent second only to those two A-grade monsters. Zhang Jing had also heard he'd already joined one of the top ten mission teams in the outer court.

No wonder he'd looked so calm when hearing the rules earlier.

He must be supremely confident in his strength.

And that Xu Wan challenging him just now—was it because he'd taken her predetermined spot?

"Brother Xia's reputation is such that among this year's new disciples in the Dao Academy, surely none are unaware?"

Zhang Jing's smile didn't diminish in the slightest.

"Brother Zhang, you never should have treated Xu Wan so harshly. If I don't act, what could I say when she awakens? I hope you'll understand."

Xia Fangming said expressionlessly.

"Let's exchange pointers."

Zhang Jing said seriously.

As the words fell.

The illusory mind's eye opened again, the entire platform now within its perception.

This Xia Fangming might be his strongest opponent in this assessment—Zhang Jing couldn't afford the slightest relaxation of vigilance.

"Good!"

Xia Fangming roared.

Spiritual energy nearing the second layer's limit instantly boiled forth.

A bronze mirror slowly floated before him, emitting layers of spiritual light that enveloped Xia Fangming.

Then a golden hammer was thrown out, its surface shimmering with spiritual light and emanating a mountain-like heaviness.

The moment it appeared, the hammer shot straight toward Zhang Jing.

Not particularly fast, but the crushing aura radiating from the golden hammer continuously hindered Zhang Jing's movements, making evasion difficult.

Boom!

The hammer smashed down violently, making the entire platform seem to tremble.

Not far away, Zhang Jing—having barely dodged—wiped cold sweat from his brow.

Being hit by that thing wouldn't be pleasant.

His flying sword was summoned again, under Zhang Jing's control transforming into a near-invisible streak that abruptly appeared before Xia Fangming for a vicious slash.

Under attack.

Xia Fangming's protective light distorted, while the sword seemed mired in quicksand, unable to advance.

Seeing this, Xia Fangming exhaled lightly.

Watching Zhang Jing simultaneously control the shield to desperately entangle with his hammer—yet never letting it make contact—while nearly breaking through his mirror's protective light with the flying sword, Xia Fangming couldn't help feeling admiration.

This guy's artifact control is ridiculously strong.

And that powerful spell that shredded Xu Wan's protection earlier.

No wonder he dared mount the third platform!

But unfortunately—

Xia Fangming's spiritual sense began tracing spell patterns. Within moments, three earthen puppets emerged at his feet, charging ferociously straight at Zhang Jing.

Meanwhile.

Seeing his flying sword's full-power strike couldn't breach the opponent's protection, while the Water Cloud Shield—after prolonged struggle with the massive hammer—was beginning to falter.

Zhang Jing sighed inwardly.

Such artifacts were rather useless against formidable opponents.

As expected, it all comes down to skills.

The Five Techniques Spiritual River surged violently as five Frostlight Curse spell-fish leaped from its surface, transforming into icy-blue light that enveloped Zhang Jing.

Boom!

The massive hammer struck Zhang Jing's protective glow directly.

But then, to Xia Fangming's utter astonishment, Zhang Jing's protective light didn't even flicker—the hammer's attack might as well have been a gentle tap.

How—how was this possible!

Simultaneously.

The remaining two spell-fish in the Five Techniques Spiritual River landed in Zhang Jing's hands, transforming into two Frostblade Techniques enhanced with [Sharpness], then soaring forth like swimming dragons.

This time Zhang Jing didn't prepare the double-enhanced Frostblade—mainly worried the inner court disciples might notice and find it hard to explain.

But after advancing to Qi Refining second layer, even the Sharpness-enhanced Frostblade's power approached third-layer levels.

More than sufficient!

Wherever the sharp blades passed, the earthen puppets were cleaved in half.

Without pause, the spells continued straight toward Xia Fangming's layered protective light.

Crack—

A crisp sound.

The protective light shattered completely.

Faced with the terrifying sharpness hovering before him, Xia Fangming—his face frosted over—couldn't suppress a look of terror as he shouted:

"I concede!"

The moment his voice sounded, silence fell.

Xia Fangming, still shaken, clutched his dimmed bronze mirror as he slowly descended from the third platform.

At this moment.

The crowd first observed Xia Fangming's pitiful state, then fixed their gazes on Zhang Jing enveloped in icy-blue protective light, inwardly lamenting.

Why had there been no news of this person before?

Strong artifact control was one thing, but how could his spells reach such absurd levels?

This is disastrous!

With only eight spots already tight, now there's one fewer.

With Xia Fangming's example before them, the crowd shifted their attention to the remaining seven platforms.

After all, they only had three challenge attempts.

To attempt knowing failure awaited was pure foolishness.

"Third demonstration platform—are there any further challengers?"

Senior Brother Liu's voice rang out.

But no response came for a long time.
