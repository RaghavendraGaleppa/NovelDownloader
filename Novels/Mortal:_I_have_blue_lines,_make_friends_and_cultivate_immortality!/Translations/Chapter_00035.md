# Chapter 35: In Cultivation, What Matters Is Power and Backing!

Trapped within the restriction barrier, Ye Ming turned deathly pale upon hearing these words, his body trembling as he took a step back.

"Senior Brother Chen, why do such icy words come from beneath your benevolent expression?"

"Senior Brother Chen! What do you intend to do?!"

"This is a restricted area of the sect!"

"If you attack this barrier, it would be no different from betraying the Yellow Maple Valley!"

Ye Ming, terrified, issued his threats with false bravado.

He cast pleading eyes toward Chen Yan. "Senior Brother Chen, I, Ye, am a Foundation Establishment cultivator—a pillar and cornerstone of the sect! I've fought and bled for the Yellow Maple Valley!"

"Would the sect truly abandon me for the sake of a mere Qi Condensation cultivator?!" The fact that Zhong Lingdao hadn't sent anyone after all this time told Ye Ming everything he needed to know, but he refused to accept it!

"Ah—Junior Brother Ye, don't make this difficult for me. Don't you understand? Even the Sect Leader hasn't sent anyone. Your fate was decided long ago." Chen Yan's expression remained impassive.

This wasn't even a hint—Chen Yan was spelling it out for him outright!

"Senior Brother Chen, how can you expect the other Foundation Establishment brothers in the sect to accept such actions in broad daylight? How will you explain this to the tens of thousands of Yellow Maple Valley disciples? What will they think of your Chen Family from now on?" Ye Ming threatened. "I refuse to accept this! I'll report this to the Core Formation Elders!"

"I'll accuse your Chen Family of framing a loyal servant!"

"Explain?" Chen Yan gestured to the furious crowd of disciples around them. "Is this explanation satisfactory enough for you, Junior Brother?"

"Kill that old dog Ye Ming!"

"Kill that old dog Ye Ming!"

"Kill that old dog Ye Ming!"

The surrounding Qi Condensation disciples raised their arms and shouted with fervor.

"You damned wretches! Shut your mouths!" Ye Ming roared, his furious gaze landing on Lin Yun.

"Young man, so you're the one who wants me dead, eh?!"

Ye Ming pointed at Lin Yun.

"Come out and fight me one-on-one if you dare!"

"You think you're tough?"

"What good is your high cultivation?!"

"In the world of cultivation, what matters is power and backing!"

"Get him!" Lin Yun waved his hand.

A dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators instantly moved into action, with Chen Yan himself standing by to oversee the operation. Ye Ming had hoped to rely on the Hundred Machinery Hall's restrictions to buy time for him and Ye Long to escape the Yellow Maple Valley. But to his shock, the restrictions were dispelled in an instant.

From afar, Elder Fu arrived, a token in his hand shooting out a beam of spiritual light.

Ye Ming was immediately swarmed by the dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators, then restrained by a magical artifact conjured by Chen Yan.

"Nephew Lin! I was wrong! This uncle admits his mistake! I'll return the Foundation Establishment Pill! Please spare my life!"

"Nephew Lin!"

"Good—!" Seeing the old dog Ye Ming captured, the gathered Qi Condensation disciples roared in approval, their resentment finally vented.

"Ye Ming, you old dog, I could eat your flesh and drink your blood!"

"Return my spirit stones!"

"And my Blood Spirit Grass!"

Chen Yan handed Ye Ming's storage pouch to Lin Yun, who retrieved the Foundation Establishment Pill and tossed it to Han Li before passing the pouch back to Chen Yan.

*[Ding, the Vajra Art Pill and Spiritual Items Gift Pack has been distributed.]*

"Everyone worked hard. Divide the contents among yourselves." Lin Yun then pulled out a stack of talismans. "Consider these extra compensation for your efforts."

"This kid really knows how to handle things." Chen Yan gave Lin Yun an approving look. "As expected of someone chosen by the Chen Family."

"Young Friend Lin, how do you wish to deal with Ye Ming?" Chen Yan asked.

Glancing at the Qi Condensation disciples present, Lin Yun waved dismissively. "Leave him to them."

"Your decision is most satisfying, Young Friend!"

With that, Chen Yan formed a hand seal and cast a spell into Ye Ming's body, sealing his spiritual power before tossing him to the waiting disciples.

Soon, Ye Ming's agonized screams filled the air.

As for Ye Long, with his backing gone, his fate was no better.

Ignoring the fate of those two, Lin Yun left with Han Li.

"Brother Lin, I can't thank you enough for this. You should take this Foundation Establishment Pill. With my inferior spiritual roots, one pill probably won't do much for me anyway." Han Li offered the pill to Lin Yun.

"Whether it works or not, you won't know until you try. Keep it for yourself. You know I already have two bottles of these—one more won't make a difference." Lin Yun waved him off.

Han Li was deeply moved. Brother Lin had been so good to him!

He truly didn't know how to repay him. *"Should I tell Brother Lin a little about the small green bottle's secret?"*

*"No—absolutely not! Han Li, that small green bottle defies the heavens. What if he turns on you after learning about it? Wouldn't you be destroying this friendship with your own hands?"*

Han Li was torn.

"Junior Brother Lin, wait a moment!" Just as the two were about to part, a female cultivator's voice called out from behind.

Han Li turned to see a woman with skin like polished jade and radiant beauty, dressed in blue robes, flying toward them.

Her slender waist, graceful neck, and the lofty hairstyle of her blue court attire gave her an ethereal, untouchable aura.

"And you are?" Lin Yun looked at the newcomer in confusion.

"I'm Nie Ying. I witnessed everything you did earlier. Your righteousness and courage are truly exemplary. I was wondering if this senior sister could befriend you." Nie Ying smoothed a stray lock of hair that had been disturbed by her swift flight, then extended her delicate hand toward Lin Yun with hopeful eyes.

*[Ding, Nie Ying has sent you a friend request.]*

*[Ding, Nie Ying has been successfully added as a friend.]*

*[Nie Ying is now your friend. You may draw a reward from her.]*

*[Ding, congratulations, Host, for obtaining: Flame Essence Stone.]*

*[Treasure Description: A special material condensed by a Core Formation cultivator after cultivating fire-attribute techniques to a certain level. Rich in fire-attribute spiritual energy, it can be used as a material for forging fire-attribute magical treasures.]*

"Flame Essence Stone?" Lin Yun glanced at the system and shook his head. He hadn't heard of it before—this was likely something only Core Formation cultivators could use. At his current Qi Condensation stage, forging magical treasures was still far beyond him.

"Haha—Senior Sister Nie, I, Lin, am always happy to make friends." Lin Yun chuckled, shaking her hand briefly before letting go.

"Brother Lin's charm with women is really..." Han Li couldn't help but feel envious watching from the side.

Why did female cultivators always approach Lin Yun, while no one ever came to him?

Was being handsome really such an advantage?

After exchanging a few polite words, Lin Yun and Nie Ying parted ways—there wasn't much to say for a first meeting. Han Li, ever the tactful one, had already slipped away earlier.

After this separation from Lin Yun, Han Li realized how difficult it was to remain inconspicuous in the Yellow Maple Valley. Moreover, his cultivation was still too low.

Though Lin Yun had helped him reclaim the Foundation Establishment Pill, the incident had also thrust him into the spotlight, making him and Lin Yun the talk of the sect.

This was a headache Han Li could do without.

But he didn't dwell on it for long. Soon after, he accepted a "Hundred Herb Garden" mission from the Hundred Machinery Hall and began a disciplined cultivation routine, keeping to himself within the garden.

During the day, he quickly finished his tasks before rushing to the Scripture Transmission Hall, where he learned practical incantations for basic spells. He then returned to the garden to study and practice them.

Occasionally, he would visit Lin Yun, often bringing blank talisman paper—crafted from Seven Star Grass and other herbs accelerated by the small green bottle—and sometimes medicinal herbs.

Lin Yun never questioned the origins of these gifts, which eased Han Li's worries. If Lin Yun had asked, Han Li would have had to come up with excuses.

Half a year passed, and the Yellow Maple Valley finally held its once-a-decade grand recruitment of new disciples.

By then, Lin Yun had prepared his first batch of high-grade beginner talismans for making new friends.

The Yellow Maple Valley Friendship Expansion Plan had begun!
