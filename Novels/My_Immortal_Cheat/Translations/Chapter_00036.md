# Chapter 36: Grand Luo Academy

"How ignorant!"

Liu Yan, standing by, rolled her eyes so hard the flames in them extinguished. Although she didn't know what a Shar Pei dog was, she understood the word "dog" and mocked, "This is an Ink Jade Qilin, your second brother's mount! It's a psychic divine beast and holds grudges!"

"My second brother's mount?" Zhou Tian stared blankly at the Shar Pei—no, the Ink Jade Qilin—in Tian Ling's arms, which was snorting and rolling its eyes at him. He seemed to recall a nearly thousand-zhang-tall Ink Jade Qilin leaping out of the formation earlier. So, this was that thing.

He turned to look at the nine-dragon chariot ahead. Zhou Yu and Zhou Ying nodded at him. Zhou Tian, however, saw nothing. The distance was too great, and the nine-dragon battle chariot had its own special effects. As a mere mortal, Zhou Tian could only see a cluster of black dots; he had no idea who was who, let alone discern a subtle gesture like a nod.

"This little Qilin is so cute!" Tian Ling's eyes shone with maternal radiance as she hugged the Ink Jade Qilin, rubbing against it vigorously. The Qilin let out a contented whimper, shaking its head playfully. This reminded Zhou Tian of an animal from his previous life, one capable of tearing tigers and leopards apart but living off cuteness. Equally shameless!

Knowing it was his second brother's mount, Zhou Tian stopped asking questions. He could only watch with envy, jealousy, and hatred, imagining that dark Qilin as his own head, letting out bursts of inexplicable laughter.

Over there, Zhou Ying stretched, clasping her hands behind her head. Her green robe fluttered, and her casual elegance drew infatuated screams from the young girls in the crowd. She said lazily, "We can probably rest assured now. Not many people can get that close to an Ink Jade Qilin. The Saintess of the South Sea is one."

"Mhm," Zhou Yu nodded, saying no more.

The journey continued like this, and soon they arrived at the imperial palace, where the banquet was to be held. The banquet was held in Shaole Palace, a place Emperor Qin used for hosting guests and holding banquets. Shaole Palace was located in the inner palace. It didn't look very large from the outside, but inside, a spatial expansion array had been used, making the decor incredibly luxurious and resplendent. There were dragon-patterned jade pillars and glazed wine goblets. Moreover, it wasn't a seated banquet but rather resembled a modern-day cocktail party.

Food and drinks were already laid out. All were made from various rare ingredients—genuinely glowing ingredients, brimming with energy. The wine, like jade grease, contained specks of light and was incredibly fragrant. None of it was ordinary!

And when they arrived, someone was already waiting there.

"Zhou Zui!" Liu Yan exclaimed. Although Zhou Zui was squatting in a very secluded corner, she spotted him at a glance...

With her startled cry, everyone's gaze shifted. Facing the eyes of Emperor Qin, King Qin, his father the Carefree King, several other kings and marquises, the Imperial Advisor, the Prime Minister, and the Censor General, Zhou Zui's scalp tingled as he walked out, awkwardly saying, "Greetings, Your Majesty."

"Haha..." Emperor Qin chuckled, teasing, "Young man, show some restraint!" He had heard about the deeds of this nephew of his; he was far more impressive than the Carefree King in his youth!

"Ha... ha..." Zhou Zui laughed awkwardly, looking at his father's grim face and wondering where he could take refuge tonight.

Emperor Qin didn't say much more. It wasn't a matter of critical importance, so there was no need to pursue it. He waved his hand, signaling Zhou Zui to go play elsewhere.

Zhou Zui felt as if he'd received a great pardon. He scurried over to Zhou Tian, smiling wryly, "My dear brother, you've really gotten me into trouble!"

Zhou Tian looked blank, feigning innocence as he said, "I didn't call you. Why are you looking for me? Go find Liu Yan!"

"Big Brother, you know I'm not talking about that!" Zhou Zui looked helpless but dared not speak plainly. He didn't know if Zhou Tian was willing to expose his supernatural abilities. What if Zhou Tian wasn't, and he blurted it out? What if Zhou Tian then cursed him with three pronouncements of "impotence"? He'd have nowhere to cry.

"Oh, Young Master Zui finally managed to tear himself away from his gentle haven!" Liu Yan chimed in, leaning closer.

Zhou Zui now had a splitting headache, suffering unspeakable bitterness and immense grievance.

Just then, a voice announced from outside the palace doors, "Grand Luo Academy... has arrived~~~"

Everyone instinctively looked towards the palace entrance, which temporarily saved Zhou Zui from his predicament.

A group of people walked in from outside the palace. Leading them was an old man with white hair and beard, his face full of wrinkles. Despite that, he exuded an aura of righteousness. Behind him followed a group of young people, vibrant and radiating arrogance. Both male and female, they all wore white robes with white crowns on their heads. On their chests, a complex pattern was embroidered with light gold cloud patterns, likely their school uniform, and the chest emblem would be their school badge.

"Scholar Li, it's been a long time!" Chancellor Liu stepped forward to greet him. Emperor Qin's status was too high, and Chancellor Liu's own status was perfectly suitable. Moreover, he was an old acquaintance of Scholar Li, making him the ideal greeter.

"Chancellor Liu, your cultivation has advanced again!" Scholar Li flattered Chancellor Liu, showing he wasn't a rigid or pedantic person. He then bowed to Emperor Qin, saying, "Greetings, Emperor Qin!" His manner was neither humble nor arrogant, fitting his status.

"Mhm," Emperor Qin nodded, saying little. This was not a formal diplomatic mission, and Scholar Li's status wasn't high enough to warrant more words from him.

Scholar Li showed no dissatisfaction, understanding the reason perfectly. However, a few individuals in the group behind him were slightly displeased, feeling looked down upon.

"Do these people feel... a bit foolish?" Zhou Tian said, observing this scene. "Don't they know their own standing? What's there to be dissatisfied about?"

Although his voice was quiet, most of those present were cultivators and turned to look at him. The students of Grand Luo Academy frowned deeply, their expressions grim.

Zhou Zui casually cast a sound-proofing array, saying, "Grand Luo Academy believes in education without discrimination. In Grand Luo Province, the Grand Luo Academy holds supreme status. There are no other major powers there, at most some local magnates. When people like that are suddenly chosen by Grand Luo Academy one day, becoming one in ten thousand, it's inevitable for their egos to swell. They'll feel like Grand Luo Academy is number one, and they themselves are number two. Few can restrain themselves, and those who can are generally top-tier prodigies who mostly haven't come."

Zhou Tian showed a look of understanding. "So that's how it is. They've gotten carried away."

Zhou Zui and Zhou Tian whispered inside the sound-proofing array. The group of students frequently glanced at them. Although they didn't know what was being said, it certainly wasn't anything good. Zhou Tian, however, didn't care. Let them look; he wouldn't lose a limb.

Scholar Li and Chancellor Liu exchanged more flattery, easing the awkward atmosphere. Grand Luo Academy had arrived relatively early because they had matters to discuss with Emperor Qin. The other major forces hadn't arrived so soon.
