# Chapter 372: The Great Ice Cube Awakens (1/2)

Everything outside the ancestral hall seemed to freeze the moment the 'Nian Beast' stepped out from the night, even the steam from the boiling dumplings pausing in mid-air.

As it 'squeezed' through the doorway, it was as if the night itself flowed into the hall.

In an instant, the Ying family's ancestral hall darkened, falling into a silence so profound one could hear a needle drop. Everyone was frightened into submission, trembling as if sensing a terror from the ancient past.

"So this is... that Disaster Beast?"

A realization dawned on Li Mo, yet it felt absurd.

Legends all say the Qilin is an auspicious omen.

Yet, the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands once existed with true Dragons, true Phoenixes, Golden Crows, and other miraculous clans, but there was never a Qilin clan. This is because within the Jade Phoenix God, the true spirits of all races are preserved, yet the Qilin is absent.

How could there be a 'Nian Beast' resembling a Qilin?

Moreover, when it said, "You have returned," was it speaking to Little Ice Cube?

Suddenly, Li Mo shivered.

It was Little Ice Cube.

Little Ying Bing was biting her lip hard, the depths of her dark, clear eyes fluctuating violently, an uncontrollable chill radiating from her body.

*!*

Li Mo's expression changed. Was this the first time her bloodline was completely erupting?

The Nian Beast's gaze grew increasingly dark and gloomy as it looked over. An invisible darkness dyed the ground like a deep lake. As the lake surface churned, many bizarre and ferocious beasts rushed out from it.

They were the size of calves, with all sorts of strange appearances, and they shared one common characteristic.

They looked starving.

"Grave Guardian Beasts?!" the Ying family elder cried out in horror, only to be pounced on and knocked to the ground before he could finish.

The grayish dream world rippled with its first splash of blood color.

"Run!"

"The Disaster Beast is here, get out and report it!"

"All who have practiced martial arts, stop these beasts together!"

Some fled, some fought back, and some sat瘫坐在地, their faces devoid of color.

Cries of terror, roars of fury, and the sound of tearing flesh were everywhere. The scene instantly descended into chaos.

The Nian Beast, however, walked forward slowly, its deep eyes seeming to hold a hint of mockery.

Grave Guardian Beasts?

Little Li Mo's brow furrowed even deeper.

He had heard that for fear of their tombs being robbed after death, powerful experts would place beasts in their graves. Since there was no food in the tomb, the beasts would devour each other.

They would end up unrecognizable and extremely ferocious.

This was the Nian Beast's 'Domain'!

But he had no time to think too much.

Little Ice Cube's body was getting colder and colder.

The Nian Beast was getting closer, and it also made one's tailbone chill, sending waves of coldness surging from the depths of one's soul.

Normally, the Divine Hammer Tyrant would have pulled out his hammer and struck first, but now, he couldn't use any of his strength; he was just an ordinary child.

"Follow me!"

Ying Xuliang scooped up his daughter and ran with his wife toward the ancestor's statue.

Li Mo followed them without hesitation.

He had seen it.

In the now-darkened ancestral hall, only that exquisitely crafted statue seemed to emit a faint light!

Several Grave Guardian Beasts behind them had already bitten to death many slower Ying family members and were chasing them like shadows.

"Wuu wuu..."

But as soon as they rushed into the area illuminated by the statue's light, black smoke began to rise from their bodies, as if hot oil had been poured onto a fire. They had to stop, wary.

The Nian Beast walked out from the pack of beasts, its large eyes examining the statue.

Deep hatred could not hide the caution within.

Indeed, after years of continuous worship by the Ying family, her statue had already developed a trace of spirituality, not to mention the statue's material itself was extraordinary.

"It's just a dead object in the end."

"Go!"

And so.

Before everyone could even sigh in relief, the Nian Beast gave an order. The Grave Guardian Beasts, fearing no death, charged into the area bathed in light.

Even as black smoke billowed from their bodies, or they melted into pools of blood on the spot.

But compared to the ancestor's statue, they were clearly more afraid of the Nian Beast.

The light began to waver!

Those squeezed at the edge already let out screams as they were bitten to death by the Grave Guardian Beasts!

"Hubby... what do we do?"

Ying's mother was terrified, her voice trembling.

"Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. We need to protect Bing'er first."

Ying Xuliang forced himself to be calm. Suddenly, he seemed to remember something.

"Bing'er, Xiao Mo, come here!"

---

"Uncle Ying?"

Seeing that Li Mo wasn't afraid, Ying Xuliang spoke: "The middle of the ancestor's statue is hollow. When I was little, I played inside with your father."

"Later, the elder moved the statue and blocked the opening at the back."

"My wife and I will move the opening out in a bit. You take Bing'er and crawl inside. No matter what happens outside, don't come out! Not even if you hear our voices. Not until your father comes, understood?"

"You're a little man. If we're not around, you have to take care of her..."

With that said, the couple hurriedly ran to the statue and pushed together.

The statue was very heavy. The couple hadn't practiced martial arts, so it was extremely strenuous to even move it a little.

And obviously.

Adults couldn't fit inside.

"Uncle Ying..."

Li Mo clenched his fists. He finally understood how Ice Cube had survived that night.

She had been stuffed into the ancestor's statue by her parents.

A wave of powerlessness suddenly surged within him.

Even if it was a dream, even if this was something that had already happened, he wanted to change it all.

"Oi! Old thing!"

Little Li Mo suddenly stepped forward, his clear voice particularly distinct.

The Nian Beast: "?"

"I'll screw your mom!"

Li Mo's voice was firm and resonant.

"???"

The Nian Beast was silenced.

Everyone present was stunned.

Seriously? You're provoking it at a time like this?

You're really something else.

The Nian Beast narrowed its eyes, not wanting to pay attention to this little thing. After all, everyone here was going to die anyway, leaving no survivors, it was just a matter of time.

"You foul-mouthed little..."

"It's pitch black in the tomb, and there's no food. You must have eaten your own poop."

"?"

"Other auspicious beasts are revered as gods, yet you've fallen to the point of eating poop. Aren't you ashamed enough to kill yourself? I'm asking you."

"I'm gonna fucking kill you!"

Whether it was because he hit a nerve, the Black Nian Beast became extremely furious, its killing intent surging. It seemed it was preparing to eat Little Li Mo first.

But what it didn't expect was.

That kid didn't hide in the light, but instead ran toward the window on the side.

That's right!

Li Mo's plan was to go for the 'emptiness' that had been erased!

He was going to lead the Nian Beast to crash into the invisible wall!

And that invisible wall was the back door of the Ying family's ancestral hall. Only the clan elders could enter, and Ying Bing clearly had never been inside!

There was no light from the ancestor's statue there. He had to be fast...

"Roar!"

A roar suddenly sounded by his ear, followed by a fierce gust of wind. Just as Li Mo was about to reach the back door, a massive figure had already blocked his path.

It perfectly sealed the back door.

Li Mo had to stop his short legs.

Foul-smelling drool dripped from the Black Nian Beast's mouth, falling from its ferocious teeth and hitting the ground, raising green smoke.

Its eyes held not only burning malice but also a thick, greedy desire!

The dark tide surrounding it swept in, ready to drown Li Mo's small figure.

Li Mo clenched his fists, still staring fearlessly at the other party.

It was just a little bit more...

It's so cold, I haven't felt this cold in a long time... This is clearly a dream, why does it feel so real?

Wait.

Li Mo realized the chill was coming from his shoulder, accompanied by a very familiar, faint fragrance.

This touch was no stranger to him, soft jade, warm fragrance...

He looked up and saw the Immortal Cold Fairy's 360-degree flawless immortal aura, her frost-covered jade face.

It wasn't Little Ice Cube.

It was the Immortal Cold Fairy.

She looked down at Little Li Mo:

"So... small... and also quite cute?"
