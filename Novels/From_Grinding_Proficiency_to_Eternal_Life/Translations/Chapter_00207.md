# Chapter 207: Just a Mace

Xu Yunfan was crouched atop a grain cart, wiping down the handle of his hammer, when he casually slipped two bags of hemostatic powder into the satchel of a passing youth. The boy was timidly gathering scattered grain, his shoulders raw from carrying arrow crates. It reminded Xu Yunfan of the refugees who had died from the Dan poison of the Incense Fire Sect in front of Dingbei City in Wuzhou.

He had been the one to crush that person to death with his own hammer.

Suddenly, amidst the still-burning smoke of the distant grain carts, came the sharp sound of heavy armor scales grinding.

Xu Yunfan wiped the rain from his face. The downpour was getting heavier, showing no signs of stopping.

He slowly stood up. The gilded handle of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer grew warm in his palm.

Half a broken halberd was submerged in the mud beneath his feet. The dark red patterns on the shaft were identical to the Tiger-head Swallowing Mouth Heavy Halberd cut down three days ago. The markings were no different from the belt engravings found on Tuoba Lie when he was killed.

He had encountered this several times over the past few days and knew exactly what it meant.

A specific faction was tracking his movements.

"The hounds of the Tuoba family really are cast from the same mold."

Before the words had fully faded, the mud suddenly exploded, sending up seven splashes of water.

The sound of something tearing through the air, accompanied by the heavy rain, came crashing down. Xu Yunfan dug his heels into the ground and retreated. The unique cracking sound of the Steel Tempered Body’s joints echoed along his spine.

As the heavy halberd grazed the tip of his nose, he saw the inverted wolf on the blade—three additional blood grooves compared to Tuoba Lie’s fierce halberd.

"You killed my younger brother and destroyed my supply route."

The heavy halberd dragged a fan-shaped curtain of water. A general in black armor stepped out from the rain, his body surrounded by steaming blood mist. The sound of his heart beating like a war drum was faintly audible. His iron boots crushed the arrows on the ground as he moved.

"Xu Yunfan, I will hang your head on the flagpole of the Divine Weapon Ridge to dry."

Looking at the cold, murderous figure before him, Xu Yunfan instantly judged that the opponent was a True Blood expert comparable to the late stage of Blood Transformation.

He felt a chill in his heart. Finally, a real character had arrived.

On the surface, Xu Yunfan frowned and said, "I am Su Zhenhe of the Xuanzhen Sect. Who is this Xu Yunfan?"

"Hmph, a clown."

A cold sneer crossed the general's face. "My name is Tuoba Li, Chief General of the Greedy Wolf Camp of Great Qian. I am here to take your life."

The Thunderfire Hammer suddenly swung sideways. The sound of Xu Yunfan's shoulder blades cracking like bedrock echoed.

The hammer head scraped against the crescent blade of the halberd, sending sparks flying. The Red Python Mountain Crushing Strength spun from his waist and hips into the air.

Tuoba Li’s heavy halberd was deflected by three degrees, the tip deeply embedding itself into the bluestone by the roadside.

"The废话 from your Tuoba family..." Xu Yunfan, who had struck first, flexed his arches like a full moon, the fascia undulating to shake off the mud on his pants. "...is always so long?"

A trace of disdain flashed across Tuoba Li's face. He dared to swing a hammer at him despite only being comparable to the fourth step of True Blood, Transformation.

The heavy halberd suddenly lifted the entire slab of bluestone. Weighing over ten thousand pounds, he lifted it with ease.

Xu Yunfan took half a step back. The heavy hammer roared, swinging from bottom to top. The crisp sound of the Steel Tempered Body卸力 (unloading force) mixed with flying stone fragments. In an instant, the force exploded, shattering the incoming boulder into pieces.

Tuoba Li's muscles beneath his armor twisted like old tree roots. When he swung the heavy halberd, he actually cleaved a vacuum in the torrential rain.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted. The opponent's True Blood seemed to have been developed and condensed to a new stage.

Over these days, Xu Yunfan had naturally learned about the Great Qian True Blood system. It sought to develop the bloodline power within the body, nurture True Blood, and finally seek to return to the source, rivaling the power of the original True Ancestor.

The Great Zhou called them Human Immortals; Great Qian called them True Ancestors.

But a True Ancestor of Great Qian is not necessarily human.

When the two fierce weapons collided for the third time, the muddy ground suddenly collapsed.

Xu Yunfan's right knee slightly bent. The Red Python Strength drilled into the earth veins along his tibia. The accumulated water within a radius of three zhang suddenly boiled.

Tuoba Li's heavy halberd sank half an inch into the mud. In that split-second of delay, the Thunderfire Hammer, carrying the sound of breaking armor, smashed toward his face.

"Earth Dragon Turnover?" Tuoba Li roared like thunder, actually leaping into the air.

His war boots shattered the airwaves of the hammer. His knee strike aimed straight for Xu Yunfan's throat. "Trickery!"

Xu Yunfan's neck instantly took on a steel luster, but he was still sent stumbling by the immense force.

As the metallic taste of blood surged in his throat, he violently twisted his waist and spun the hammer. The qilin mouth at the end of the hammer handle accurately struck the shaft of the heavy halberd.

Tuoba Li's right hand, which had just grabbed his weapon, had its palm split open. The heavy halberd nearly flew from his grasp.

*This opponent isn't just a simple Muscle Refining Realm!*

Tuoba Li's heart grew heavy immediately.

"No wonder you've been jumping around in the rear for so long."

Ordinary martial artists, faced with a formation of a hundred Great Qian elites and a deputy general charging the line, couldn't withstand it.

But Xu Yunfan was different. He had charged in and out of the Great Qian army seven times without even gasping for breath.

A curtain of rain formed between the two men.

Xu Yunfan suddenly noticed blood seeping from the gaps in the opponent's armor—three fragments of the stone he had卸力 (unloaded) earlier had embedded themselves in the seams of Tuoba Li's shoulder armor.

*As expected, the physique forged by True Blood isn't as good as a martial artist who specializes in tempering the body. Even with the Steel Tempered Body's counter-shock, he still bleeds.*

"Your younger brother before he died..." Xu Yunfan suddenly spoke, his twin hammers drawing crossing arcs to block the retreat path. "...his right arm trembled just like this."

The heavy halberd suddenly surged with a thousand layers of waves.

"Seeking death."

Tuoba Li's eyes turned bloodshot. His halberd technique was no longer the open and grand style. The crescent blade moved like a viper along the hammer handle.

Xu Yunfan retreated seven steps in a row. The cracking of his Steel Tempered Body joints sounded like firecrackers. Each step left spiderweb cracks in the bluestone slabs.

At the ninth step, his back hit a cliff face.

Tuoba Li's heavy halberd had already thrust to within half a foot of his chest. Xu Yunfan suddenly let go of his hammer.

The distinct sound of joints dislocating from the Steel Tempered Body technique rang out. He actually used his collarbone to clamp the halberd shaft. The Red Python Strength rushed along the steel bone straight to the opponent's wrist pulse.

"Plate Ribs and虬 Muscles?!"

Tuoba Li was stunned for a moment.

In the instant the heavy halberd was released, Xu Yunfan caught the falling Thunderfire Hammer.

As the hammer head swept upward from below, the heavy rain was scorched into white mist.

The moment Tuoba Li's chest armor caved in, thirty-seven strands of Red Python Strength poured into his internal organs along the hammer's纹路 (patterns).

The bluestone at the edge of the cliff collapsed with a roar.

Xu Yunfan watched the black-armored figure fall into the clouds, shaking his cracked palm.

Blood dripping from the tip of the Thunderfire Hammer spread in the mud pool, quickly washed away by the rain into a faint red stream.

*He actually managed to break my skin. Blood Transformation is still somewhat too strong.*

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan's expression shifted.

From the bottom of the cliff came the sound of bones cracking. Seventeen blood lines pierced through the mist from the bottom, tearing through the rain curtain and embedding into the rock wall.

When Tuoba Li climbed up the cliff, a three-inch blood-colored bone blade protruded from his left shoulder blade. The sound of his heart beating actually suppressed the thunder.

"The fifth step of the True Blood Realm, Blood Burning?!"

Xu Yunfan took half a step back. The steel mechanism box behind him sprang open, revealing the dragon-swallowing mouth of the *Liu Jin Jian* (Gilded Mace). The nine sections of the mace body didn't emit a metallic cold light, but rather a dark golden pattern similar to flowing magma.

At this moment, Tuoba Lie's cheeks grew scales, and his eyes turned into vertical pupils, staring fixedly at Xu Yunfan.

"You..."

"Lin!"

Xu Yunfan formed the Lin seal with his left hand and grasped the *Liu Jin Jian* with his right, pulling it out in an instant.

Emotions receded like a tide within him, leaving him like a stagnant pool. The bulging muscles of his body calmed down. When he moved, his body only slightly swelled, and the bulging blue veins under his skin turned into meridian threads, stretching out beneath the surface.

But Tuoba Li, who had just leaped up from the bottom of the cliff, suddenly felt a terrifying sensation.

He felt as if Xu Yunfan's body was a powder keg that had just been ignited.

*How is this possible?!*

*He is merely in the Muscle Refining Realm of Great Zhou, while I am clearly a whole major realm above him!*

What shook his mind even more was that the opponent had actually pulled a divine weapon from behind him.

The next instant, the trajectory of the *Liu Jin Jian* was woven with blazing fire. Xu Yunfan's wrist bones exploded with seven high-frequency tremors.

This bursting force penetrated the chest cavity through the cracks in the bones. Nine methods of force application rotated in the blink of an eye: *Tendon Picking, Marrow Shattering, Vein Severing, Bone Crushing, Qi Burning, Acupoint Locking, Blood Intercepting, Force Dissolving, and Void Returning.*

Under Tuoba Li's horrified gaze, the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace Technique, perfectly utilized in the Lin state, exploded inside the enemy's skull with a hundredfold intensity.

*You have successfully killed a powerful enemy. Your proficiency in the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace Technique has greatly increased.*

*The Nine Profound亢 Dragon Mace has reached Great Perfection.*

*...*
