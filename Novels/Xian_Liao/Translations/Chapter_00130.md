# Chapter 130: Profound Nether Qi

Having accepted the gifts, Zhou Qing naturally proceeded to treat Ye Chong's injuries next.

Jin Guang intended to excuse himself. Having decided to establish good relations, he wanted to be mindful of details—observing someone else's healing methods would be somewhat inappropriate.

However, Zhou Qing stopped him, "Brother Jin, there's no need to leave. I'll need your assistance in treating Brother Ye."

Jin Guang was somewhat puzzled and asked, "What do you mean by that, Brother?"

Zhou Qing explained, "Brother Ye's cultivation method leans towards the Water element. In the Five Elements, Metal generates Water. As a perfected Foundation Establishment cultivator, your true essence has already refined the Metal nature to perfection. This makes it perfect for using Metal to generate Water, stimulating the operation of Brother Ye's cultivation method."

Upon hearing this, Jin Guang understood. Zhou Qing further elaborated on the principles of Metal generating Water, incorporating some profound insights from the Primordial Divine Light of Taiyi. Even a perfected Foundation Establishment cultivator like Jin Guang gained some enlightenment from it.

Ye Chong, standing nearby, also benefited.

Meanwhile, Zhou Qing subtly employed his Bewitching Divine Art. This demonic technique was particularly effective in fostering goodwill.

After gaining insights from Zhou Qing's words, the two couldn't help but engage in an exchange of cultivation experiences.

Ye Chong's cultivation method leaned towards Water, and Zhou Qing had already mastered the Kidney Water Thunder. Additionally, having observed Ye Chong's Profound Yin Ghostly Miasma and using his Insightful Eye to perceive Ye Chong's qi mechanisms, Zhou Qing smoothly healed Ye Chong's injuries.

By the time Zhou Qing concluded the session and the exchange of insights ended, Ye Chong's goodwill towards Zhou Qing had significantly increased.

As for Jin Guang, Zhou Qing didn't deliberately focus the effects of the Bewitching Divine Art on him, letting things develop naturally. Combined with Jin Guang's own intention to befriend Zhou Qing, their relationship naturally became more harmonious.

When Zhou Qing saw Jin Guang and Ye Chong off, the two actually felt somewhat reluctant to leave.

After leaving the market, as Foundation Establishment cultivators, their reluctance gradually faded. However, Zhou Qing's Bewitching Divine Art had reached great mastery, and his spiritual sense was at the perfected Foundation Establishment level, no weaker than Jin Guang's. Thus, Jin Guang didn't notice anything amiss, only sighing, "I suspect Qinglingzi not only possesses an immortal physique but also one of the rarest types. Otherwise, how could someone so young have such profound insights into cultivation?"

Ye Chong replied, "Thanks to this exchange, my breakthrough to late Foundation Establishment will come naturally. This time, it was a case of 'no discord, no concord.' Befriending such a prodigy is a great boon for both of us."

Jin Guang nodded, "In the end, those with talent among us cultivators can go further and more easily." There was a hint of envy in his words.

But Jin Guang, having reached perfected Foundation Establishment, was no ordinary man.

---

After the beast tide, there would be ten years of peace—a perfect opportunity for him to attempt Core Formation. To stand firm in the cultivation world and advance further, one's own strength was ultimately what mattered.

---

After seeing them off, Zhou Qing breathed a sigh of relief. Earlier, when using the Bewitching Divine Art, there had been a slight risk of Jin Guang noticing. Fortunately, he had been extremely cautious, and the process went smoothly.

Under the influence of the Bewitching Divine Art, the exchange of cultivation insights had gone exceptionally well. Zhou Qing also gained some understanding of Metal-element cultivation from Jin Guang.

Jin Guang primarily cultivated Metal-element techniques, which had much in common with the Lung Metal Thunder Zhou Qing was currently practicing. Through their exchange, Zhou Qing benefited in his cultivation of Lung Metal Thunder.

Similarly, through his exchange with Ye Chong and treating his injuries, Zhou Qing gained deeper insights into Profound Yin Ghostly Miasma and the Water element.

After all, Fu Shan and Zhang Jingxiu were body cultivators. Compared to qi cultivators, their comprehension of the laws of heaven and earth was somewhat lacking. This was the advantage of qi cultivators.

Of course, Zhou Qing possessed the advantages of both qi and body cultivation.

His thoughts then turned to the ancient pill formula Jin Guang had given him.

"Jade Marrow Reversion Pill" could increase the chances of Core Formation by thirty percent. For Zhou Qing's cultivation, it would undoubtedly be highly beneficial. The three main ingredients in the formula were "Longevity Jade Marrow," "Blood Dragon Mushroom," and the spiritual dew of a Wood-element spirit creature at the Foundation Establishment level.

He had obtained Longevity Jade Marrow from the Divine Water Palace, while Jin Guang had gifted him the Blood Dragon Mushroom. As for the spiritual dew, the mulberry dew from the Great Mulberry Tree would certainly suffice.

From Jin Guang, Zhou Qing also learned that Wood-element spirit creatures at the Foundation Establishment level were extremely rare. Most such creatures tended to demonize and attract heavenly thunder before reaching the Foundation Establishment level.

This was why they had been so interested in the Great Pine Tree in the market.

Zhou Qing deduced that Jin Guang's interest in the Great Pine Tree likely included obtaining its spiritual dew for the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill.

However, Zhou Qing also had the Great Mulberry Tree, which was even more formidable than the Great Pine Tree.

"It seems the rarity of the Great Pine Tree and Great Mulberry Tree in the Jingyang Dao Domain exceeds my expectations. Since the Great Pine Tree has been refined by Brother Zhang, there's no fear of it being stolen."

If the Great Pine Tree could stir Jin Guang's desire, the Great Mulberry Tree would likely attract the covetous eyes of Core Formation elders.

Zhou Qing decided that before he achieved Core Formation, he should not attempt to transplant the Great Mulberry Tree to the Jingyang Dao Domain.

After all, the Great Mulberry Tree was already dominant in the mortal realm, currently suppressing its own vitality and essence to avoid attracting heavenly thunder.

From the Great Mulberry Tree's emotions, Zhou Qing could sense its profound fear of heavenly thunder.

It seemed he would need to help his "pet" when the time came.

Moreover, the heavenly thunder the Great Mulberry Tree would face was a true tribulation, different from spring thunder.

Zhou Qing would need to research relevant materials later.

For now, his main focus would be on refining the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill.

At Qingfu Palace, while Zhou Qing and Fu Shan were studying the pill formula, they suddenly received a message via a communication talisman.

"Junior Brother, what happened?" Fu Shan asked gravely. In the mortal realm, anything urgent enough to summon Zhou Qing must be serious.

Zhou Qing replied, "Mingyue has fallen ill."

"Let's go see her immediately."

Fu Shan's face showed anxiety. Yuan Mingyue was Zhou Qing's only personal disciple and, in Fu Shan's traditional view, the undisputed true inheritor of the Dao Court's legacy.

It was just a pity she wasn't male.

---

"Master, I'm cold."

Yuan Mingyue's face was deathly pale, her entire body covered in frost.

Zhou Qing took her hand, channeling pure yang qi into her body, turning the surroundings into a furnace. Although her external appearance returned to normal, her bones remained permeated with a pure yin qi that had long since fused with her, becoming her innate qi and impossible to expel.

"Profound Nether Physique," Fu Shan said with extreme gravity.

"Profound Nether Physique?"

Zhou Qing had always thought Yuan Mingyue had a Pure Yin Physique, never expecting Fu Shan to identify it as the Profound Nether Physique—something he had never heard of.

Fu Shan explained that this was a legend from the medical texts of Qingfu Palace, not even recorded in the standard medical books. He had always believed such a physique didn't exist in the world.

The Profound Nether Physique could be considered a type of Pure Yin Physique but was far more terrifying. Those with this physique not only possessed pure yin qi but also the Nine Nether Terminating Meridians, making it impossible to live past fifteen.

"Legend says the root of the Profound Nether Physique lies in that single breath of Profound Nether Qi."

After careful discussion, Zhou Qing and Fu Shan decided to use golden needles to draw out the Profound Nether Qi from Yuan Mingyue's body.

Their attempts, however, failed.

As soon as Zhou Qing touched the Profound Nether Qi deep within Yuan Mingyue's bones, he felt it was on the verge of erupting. If provoked, Yuan Mingyue would certainly die.

"Let's seal it for now."

After further discussion, they decided on a temporary solution. Zhou Qing used Azure Sun Spirit Fire to create a seal, suppressing the Profound Nether Qi within Yuan Mingyue.

Fortunately, Zhou Qing's spiritual sense was at the perfected Foundation Establishment level, and his control over fire was exquisitely precise.

After some effort, they managed to stabilize the raging Profound Nether Qi in Yuan Mingyue's body.

"Master, thank you," Yuan Mingyue said, still shaken from her brush with death.

Zhou Qing smiled, "With Elder Brother and me here, dying isn't that easy. Don't worry."

Fu Shan also smiled, "Indeed, this ordeal has also brought you benefits, forging jade-like bones and skin. Not only will your appearance remain youthful, but your cultivation aptitude will also improve."

Though the Profound Nether Qi was life-threatening, it was also of the purest yin nature, reputed as "ghost immortal qi." During Yuan Mingyue's episode, the Profound Nether Qi had transformed her physique.

"Fortune and misfortune are intertwined. Mingyue, without trials, there can be no great achievements. This tribulation will surely bring you great fortune in the future," Zhou Qing said with a carefree smile.

Fu Shan's mood lightened as well. He chuckled, "Facing life and death with calm is the mark of a true cultivator. Since Mingyue is fine now, let's return to studying the pill formula."

Zhou Qing nodded.

Back at Qingfu Palace, Fu Shan's expression turned solemn again. "Junior Brother, although we've temporarily sealed it, when the Profound Nether Qi erupts again and the Nine Nether Terminating Meridians fully activate, I fear Mingyue won't survive."

Zhou Qing replied, "That won't happen anytime soon. Once I reach Core Formation, I should be able to resolve this. Moreover, the Profound Nether Qi will likely be useful to me as well."

He thought of the Primordial Heavy Water and Profound Yin Ghostly Miasma. Using the Profound Nether Qi as a medium, after mastering the second layer of Primordial Heavy Water and combining it with Profound Yin Ghostly Miasma, it would greatly benefit him.

The pure yin nature of the Profound Nether Qi also reminded him of the Yin-Yang Divine Light cultivation method left behind by Jingyang Zhenren. Perhaps he would have a chance to cultivate it.

The Primordial Divine Light of Taiyi could break all Five Elements techniques. Combined with Yin-Yang Divine Light, it might be capable of breaking all techniques in the world.

Moreover, Taiyi represented the "Dao," and combined with Yin-Yang, it symbolized the "Three Giving Rise to All Things," touching upon profound cultivation mysteries.

However, Zhou Qing cultivated the Eight Trigrams Dao Furnace, not the Yin-Yang Treasure Vase. Even if he mastered Yin-Yang Divine Light, it wouldn't compare to Jingyang Zhenren's, but its power would still be formidable—undoubtedly a major trump card among Core Formation-level divine abilities.

Zhou Qing and Fu Shan focused their efforts on refining the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill.

In fact, the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill formula could also be considered the essence of a cultivation method—the Jade Marrow Reversion Scripture. First, jade marrow; then, reversion to the pill.

This subtly revealed the mysteries of Core Formation.

From the formula alone, Zhou Qing gained many insights. However, applying the principles of the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill to oneself was nearly impossible for ordinary cultivators, as it placed extreme demands on the physical body.

"Using oneself as a pill furnace, first forming jade marrow, then using the interaction of water and fire to create the reverted pill. The pill undergoes nine transformations, hence the name Nine Revolutions Golden Pill."

Zhou Qing's comprehension of these ancient cultivation mysteries revealed that their difficulty far exceeded the standard Core Formation methods of the Jingyang Dao Domain's qi cultivators.

Yet, they seemed to align with his path of the Dao Furnace.

"Could the Dao Furnace path be inherited from ancient times?"

Zhou Qing's journey along the Dao Furnace path had been serendipitous, guided by Jingyang Zhenren's legacy in the mortal realm. Even so, it had been arduous.

Without the Longevity Scroll's ability to show progress from the start, he might not have persevered.

Even now, cultivating Lung Metal Thunder was not only slow but excruciating.

This path was simply not feasible for ordinary cultivators.

The current cultivation methods, though inferior to the Dao Furnace path, were far less demanding. Had Jingyang Zhenren not mysteriously disappeared, three hundred years might have seen dozens of human cities in the Jingyang Dao Domain each guarded by a Core Formation cultivator.

In fact, before Patriarch Xuan Tian reached late Core Formation, several Core Formation cultivators had perished.

These cultivators had been staunch followers of Jingyang Zhenren, exhausting their vitality to defend human cities that had been breached.

Had Patriarch Xuan Tian not achieved late Core Formation during the most dire beast tide assault on Xuan Tian City, even that city would have fallen.

Moreover, Patriarch Xuan Tian was no ordinary late Core Formation cultivator.

Furthermore, had Jingyang Zhenren not purged the demonic creatures of the Jingyang Dao Domain before establishing human cities, humanity would never have survived the beast tides after his disappearance.

At the same time, Jingyang Zhenren's decision not to exterminate all demonic creatures suggested an intention to use them as training targets for human cultivators.

Unbeknownst to them, forty-nine days had passed since Zhou Qing and Fu Shan began refining the pill.

Above Qingfu Palace's mountaintop, auspicious clouds gathered.

Fu Shan was utterly exhausted, and Zhou Qing also showed signs of fatigue.

Yet, both felt relieved.

As the auspicious clouds swirled, faint rays of light emanated from the pill furnace.

"Fortunately, Junior Brother has mastered the Azure Sun Spirit Fire and Primordial Heavy Water. Otherwise, the Jade Marrow Reversion Pill would have been impossible to refine."

At the critical moment of water and fire interaction, Zhou Qing employed the Azure Sun Spirit Fire and Primordial Heavy Water.

Even so, they had failed three times.

Fortunately, the "Longevity Jade Marrow" and other medicinal ingredients Zhou Qing had brought from the Divine Water Palace were abundant, and the Blood Dragon Mushroom was ample, allowing for these failures.

The Jade Marrow Reversion Pill required a sufficient quantity of raw materials to form the unique pill qi, making small-scale experimentation impossible.

However, the failed batches weren't wasted—some were given to Morning Sun, the little snake, and the Great Mulberry Tree, while a portion was sent to Zhang Jingxiu.

The remainder was used as fertilizer for the premium Dragon-Patterned Rice in the spirit fields.

According to Xiao Ruowang's observations, the upcoming harvest of premium Dragon-Patterned Rice would be exceptionally potent.

"Elder Brother, I'll test one first."

Zhou Qing placed a fragrant Jade Marrow Reversion Pill into his mouth.

[Author's Note: Severe diarrhea today, had to get an IV. Will make up the missing word count in the next couple of days. My apologies.]
