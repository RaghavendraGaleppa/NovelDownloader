# Chapter 430: Cold on the Outside, Warm on the Inside; A Man of Integrity, Xiao Li (1/2)

“Let the ice lump cool me down…”

Stepping over the threshold, Xiao Li suddenly snapped back to reality, realizing his thoughts were incredibly dangerous.

Is this a thought that a proper gentleman should have?

The Ice Lump is aloof and intelligent, orchestrating everything from behind the scenes. Just a glance from her makes one feel guilty. Occasionally, she switches to being the “bad Ice Lump,” and even in her幼崽 (cub) days in his dreams, she was already making him defenseless.

Such an icy, aloof Ice Lump—giving her a foot massage is just professional conduct. But now craving her body? How can that be the same?

If she knew the lewd thoughts in his mind, she would surely furrow her delicate brows, look at him with scrutinizing eyes, and might even say, “So this is what kind of gentleman you are.”

Hmm?

Wait, why does that sound a bit familiar? As if I’ve heard it somewhere…

Li Yao shook his head, walking into the kitchen while muttering to himself:

“It’s normal for me to have such thoughts.”

“Just like after playing basketball in the summer, wanting to drink an ice-cold Sprite. After forging iron in the Fire Vein, wanting to cool myself to the heart and feel refreshed is also quite reasonable.”

“What could possibly be better than the cooling effect of the Ice Lump?”

“How can you call it craving her body…”

“Craving… what?”

A clear and melodious voice, tinged with confusion, suddenly came from behind.

Ying Bing stood at the doorway, with the snowy mountains behind her. Her gaze was slightly puzzled as she looked over.

She wore a long, water-blue dress with a fur collar. With her hands clasped behind her, her figure appeared even more slender and curvaceous. Her waist, with its visible abs, was as slim as a grasp. Her short boots were dusted with snow, though she probably couldn’t see it even if she looked down.

She had arrived in the evening, stepping through the snow. Her beauty, set against the last rays of sunset that refused to yield to the earth, made one momentarily mistake her for a goddess ruling over ice, snow, and night.

It was unclear whether she had only heard his last sentence…

Li Yao straightened his expression and said, “Hmm, I said I’m craving the ‘ginseng’ (shen).”

He casually pulled out a thousand-year-old Snow Spirit Ginseng.

This was something he had “plucked” from the Ice Lump during their last meal.

Ice Lump: “?”

“I’m exhausted from forging iron, so I’m eating a Snow Ginseng to replenish myself.”

“But your Yang energy is very strong right now,” Ying Bing said, her delicate brows slightly furrowed.

“It’s fine. It’s normal for young people to have a lot of fire. The stronger it is, the more you need to nourish it. Let it see who the real master of the body is.”

Li Yao grabbed the apron next to him and skillfully tied it around his waist, concealing its “arrogance.”

“…”

Ying Bing was stunned. Her red lips parted slightly as if to speak, but she stopped. The small hands behind her back unconsciously curled up and entangled.

Images from the dream surged into her mind.

She withdrew her gaze as if electrocuted, as if her eyes had been burned.

In the end, she said nothing. She just nodded expressionlessly and sat down at the table in the courtyard, lowering her eyes to pick up a book.

Qin Yuzhi and Tian Miao had also gotten used to waiting for dinner these past two days. Every mealtime, they would come to the table and sit down without needing to be called.

Hmm, here we need to criticize the beautiful master. She sleeps during the day and comes out at night, often sneaking into the kitchen late at night to find food.

Ying Bing seemed not to have heard the two of them arrive. She stared blankly at the pages of the book, like a beautifully crafted jade statue—beautiful but seemingly without a soul.

“I smell the fragrance of spiritual energy. What are we eating today?” Qin Yuzhi wiped the corner of her mouth. She couldn’t even dream of such delicious food made by Chef Li.

“It smells like Snow Spirit Ginseng, and the age is quite high,” Tian Miao, who had some knowledge of herbs, added.

“Snow Spirit Ginseng?”

Tian Miao rubbed her eyes and began to enumerate knowledgeably:

“This kind of heavenly treasure has very strict growth requirements. It needs an extremely high and cold environment to grow, such as Tianshan Mountain. So this ‘ginseng’ is very aloof.”

Ice Lump: “…”

Her deep, clear eyes widened slightly, suspecting she had misheard something.

“In such cold weather, eating something so cold isn’t very good, is it?”

---

“Sister Yuzhi, that’s where you’re wrong. In pharmacology, it’s about ‘reversal upon reaching extremes’ and ‘things will reverse when they reach an extreme.’ Therefore, medicinal herbs that are extremely Yang usually grow in cold, gloomy places.”

Tian Miao raised a finger and explained with a smile:

“So this Snow Spirit Ginseng, though it looks crystal clear like jade and has a texture like ice, has a fiery inner nature…”

“Then how does this ‘ginseng’ taste?” Qin Yuzhi asked curiously.

Tian Miao said with a serious expression: “To put it this way, this thing exists only in Tianshan, and it’s hard to smell it in the mortal world!”

*Clatter—*

The book fell to the ground.

Qin Yuzhi and Tian Miao turned their heads, only to find Ying Bing still expressionless, but her neck had turned rose-red in the twilight.

“Little Bing’er, why did your book fall?”

“My hands are frozen stiff.”

“?”

The two were a bit puzzled, but just then, they suddenly felt heat from behind. It was Li Yao walking out with a tray of dishes.

It’s a bit fiery, Xiao Li.

Did you set yourself on fire while cooking?

Qin Yuzhi raised an eyebrow: “Did you just secretly eat some ‘ginseng’ yourself?”

Li Yao’s hand trembled, almost spilling the freshly made dish all over himself.

“What body this, body that. Under the bright sun and clear sky, I, a man of integrity and a gentleman, can’t stand hearing these things…”

“Bright sun and clear sky?”

Qin Yuzhi and Tian Miao were stunned. They looked at the sun that had already completely set and the moon climbing above the clouds, their faces full of doubt.

“A man of integrity?”

Ying Bing pursed her lips, her eyes deep as she rubbed the big-headed doll’s head.

What integrity.

It’s more like a body full of Yang energy.

“I went to the Fire Vein on the Divine Weapon Peak today. While forging iron, due to a martial art, I absorbed a lot of fire energy. But it’s not a big deal,” Li Yao said as he sat down nonchalantly.

Ying Bing glanced at him. It seemed that even in her breath, she could feel a wave of heat emanating from him, giving her the illusion of feeling his body temperature.

She silently gripped the big-headed doll even tighter.

Qin Yuzhi was taken aback: “This Snow Spirit Ginseng is born from extreme Yin creating Yang, right? Then why did you make this for dinner?”

“I’m using poison to counter poison. Two negatives make a positive,” Xiao Li explained logically.

Qin Yuzhi was baffled. She could only look at Tian Miao with a questioning gaze, but the latter looked confused, not understanding which school of pharmacology Li Yao had studied.

“Where is this pharmacology…”

“That’s right, this is mathematics. Master math and science, and you can travel the world without fear.”

“Even according to mathematics, two negatives make a positive, but two positives can’t make a negative.”

“Who says so?”

Li Yao fished a piece of jade-colored spirit ginseng from the soup and crunched it loudly.

A wave of blood and Qi surged.

Hmph, fortunately, he had extremely strong control over his body, and his nosebleed stubbornly refused to flow out. It was just that his face was swelling from the heat.

“It’s a bit hot today…”

“…” Tian Miao was speechless for a moment.

Qin Yuzhi looked at the flushed Xiao Li, and then at the Frost Immortal who had just claimed to be frozen stiff.

She suddenly had a flash of inspiration, illuminating a long-lost fragment of memory.

“Hey, I have a method!”
