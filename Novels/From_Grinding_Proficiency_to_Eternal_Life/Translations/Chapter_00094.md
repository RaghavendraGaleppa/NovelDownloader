# Chapter 94: The Killing Arrives

Xu Yunfan’s shoulder blades crackled with dense bone sounds. He held the heavy瓮金锤 (Weng Jin Hammer) horizontally across his chest, twisted his waist, and channeled the combined force of his waist and horse stance. With the hammer weighing over two hundred catties, he swept it out and smashed it heavily toward his opponent.

As the wind from the hammer tore open Chen Tiangang’s center gate, Xu Yunfan’s throat rumbled like thunder, letting out a deafening roar.

"You haven't even gathered the strength within your muscles, bones, and skin. You haven't even achieved the External Three Harmonies, yet you dare swing your hammer at your master?"

Chen Tiangang acted as if he hadn't heard Xu Yunfan’s roar. The moment his shin bone scraped against the Weng Jin Hammer, a sound like metal striking metal rang out.

*Clang!*

The sound of metal clashing exploded, shaking the surrounding air into a buzz.

*What terrifying strength.*

Xu Yunfan’s expression changed slightly. His tiger's mouth went numb, but he used the rebound force to slide back seven steps. The blue brick ground was plowed into two deep trenches by his cloth shoes.

*It seems I have the Fei Mao Tui (Flying Hair Leg) movement technique to thank; otherwise, I probably couldn't have dissipated such an astonishing force.*

"Hmm?"

Chen Tiangang was somewhat surprised.

"I didn't expect the martial arts you cultivated from training your muscles and bones to be so extraordinary, allowing you to reach such a level."

Just as Chen Tiangang stepped forward, the sound of mechanical triggers suddenly rang out from outside the Thunder Tower.

Eight three-edged armor-piercing arrows shot out violently from outside the tower. Xu Yunfan’s heart shook, his eyes widened, and his hand instinctively formed the Seal of the Word 'Lin' (Immovable).

In an instant, the intense emotions dancing in his eyes quickly calmed down. Watching the few armor-piercing arrows rushing toward him, the muscles all over his body trembled, and his body twisted into a strange posture: one hand long, the other short, his spine contorted.

The eight armor-piercing arrows passed through the gaps in his body by a hair's breadth.

Three of them, however, were aimed directly at Chen Tiangang’s body.

Chen Tiangang’s shoulder muscles suddenly knotted into balls. The three three-edged armor-piercing arrows were actually clamped by his raised trapezius muscles.

Xu Yunfan’s neck hairs stood on end. Relying on the blood energy boiling to the extreme inside him, he used his residual momentum to roll along the ground. The War Drum Weng Jin Hammer scraped a series of sparks against the bronze pillars. The ninth crossbow bolt chasing him from behind钉 (nailed) into the blue brick where he had been standing just a moment ago.

Xu Yunfan, quickly breaking out of the 'Lin' state, took the opportunity to roll behind a beam column.

Xu Yunfan gasped for breath, his heart pounding like a pump. The various hormones within his internal organs soared to an unimaginable level at this moment.

*Just now, I almost died.*

He stared fixedly outside the Thunder Tower at the burly, armored figure sitting on a tall horse, holding a broad-bladed crescent moon saber.

General Cui Yan. Although he was only a deputy general, his strength was not trivial.配合 (Cooperating) with his horse's charge, his "Dragging the Saber" technique was ferocious and unparalleled.

He was a高手 (expert) of the Blood Transformation Realm.

"If these armor-piercing arrows were mixed with Star Sand of Black Iron, I would retreat three paces. But these scrap metals? They are just an embarrassment."

Chen Tiangang crushed the arrow shafts with two fingers. Dark purple blood slid down his iron-gray skin. The muscle fibers at the wound writhed like earthworms and closed up. The wound actually vanished at a speed visible to the naked eye.

He stepped his right foot back half a step, shattering the floor tile. The great dragon of his spine arched suddenly. His spine trembled, making a faint cicada sound. This was clearly the starting stance of the "Heaven Cicada Cloak" killing method.

His demeanor had long since lost the urgency he had when he first encountered Cui Yan.

"Cui Yan, I remember you. You are also from Wuzhou. Back when Wuzhou's state city was defending itself, you were a City Guard Commander. I didn't expect that after all these years, you have become a deputy general of the Tiger Ben Black Armor. This is quite a surprise to me."

Hearing Chen Tiangang call out his identity, Cui Yan thought back carefully, his expression clearing up as he laughed loudly.

"I remember you. Among the Five Ridges and Seven Sects, it's just your Tian Chan Sect that I couldn't quite remember. I still remember you coming to toast me back then."

"Hmph."

Chen Tiangang snorted coldly. He glanced at Xu Yunfan behind the beam column and took the lead, walking out of the Thunder Tower.

Cui Yan’s scaled horse charged forward. Using the momentum of the horse, it suddenly reared up. The seven-foot long meteor iron crescent moon saber slashed down diagonally with the horse's charge.

The sound of the blade tearing through the air was like a tiger's roar, and the blade actually carried a scorching heat.

Chen Tiangang didn't dodge or avoid, crossing his arms to硬架 (hard block). His muscles bulged like diamonds, and his sleeves exploded, revealing a dark golden skin membrane. His arms were densely covered with blood-colored cicada wing patterns.

Chen Tiangang’s blood patterns surged. When he硬接 (hardly received) Cui Yan’s dragging saber slash, it actually emitted a metal clang.

The meteor iron blade劈入 (chopped into) the skin membrane half an inch but could go no further. Instead, Chen Tiangang反手 (backhandedly) grabbed the blade tightly.

Cui Yan roared and exerted force. The scaled horse’s front hooves rose three meters high. But Chen Tiangang’s waist and horse stance sank. The blue bricks under his feet exploded, and he used the "Thousand Catty Drop" to生生 (forcefully) stop the horse's forward momentum.

The moment the horse lost its balance, Chen Tiangang’s left palm turned into a claw and扣住 (clamped) the back of the blade.

Blood patterns spread from his arm to his fingertips. Five blood grooves immediately犁出 (plowed out) sparks on this precious artifact crescent moon saber. His figure rapidly closed in on Cui Yan.

Seeing this, Cui Yan decisively pulled the saber and leaned back. The crescent moon saber drew a half-arc in the air and swept horizontally toward him. But Chen Tiangang’s right leg swept out like a steel whip. The iron sheet on his boot tip精准 (precisely) hit the chest armor's护心镜 (heart-protecting mirror).

With a crisp sound, spiderweb cracks appeared on the mirror surface. Chen Tiangang’s finger joints, covered in blood patterns, were already pressing against Cui Yan’s throat.

The long saber arrived late at this moment, but Chen Tiangang twisted his head and bit it. The meteor iron clashed between his teeth, and he actually shattered half his teeth.

Chen Tiangang死咬着 (bit hard on) the long saber and let out a嘎嘎 (grating) strange laugh.

The next instant, he exerted force within the size of his finger joints.

*Crack!*

A series of bone-cracking sounds. Cui Yan’s neck was broken, his head drooping to one side, devoid of any life.

"General!"

The twelve Tiger Ben Black Armor guards roared and charged with their sabers. But Chen Tiangang stamped his foot and exerted force. The blue bricks within a zhang radius surged like waves, sending the remaining Tiger Ben Black Armor guards flying ten meters away. It was clear they wouldn't survive.

"A mere first-level training achievement dares to挥刀 (swing a saber) against Blood Transformation? How laughable."

Chen Tiangang turned his head to look, but the Thunder Tower was already empty. Xu Yunfan had already fled while Chen Tiangang was fighting with Cui Yan.

The veins on Chen Tiangang’s temples writhed like living snakes. The blood patterns all over his body actually moved under his skin, tracing out cicada wing patterns.

He suddenly turned direction and raced toward the方位 (direction) Xu Yunfan had left. Every time his foot arch exerted force, it left spiderweb cracks on the ground. With one step, the wind whistled, and he bounded thirty meters in the blink of an eye.

All the way down the mountain, chasing to an abandoned ferry crossing, Chen Tiangang suddenly spurted two streams of blood from his nose, forcing him to stop, his eyes filled with suspicion and uncertainty.

It seemed that after transplanting the true blood extracted from Ning Wuque into his body, a rejection reaction had occurred. His muscles writhed incessantly, and the muscles under his skin felt like a bunch of small bugs crawling.

His face turned red, then purple, then black, before finally slowly returning to normal.

*No, I must find him!*

He had to accelerate his pace, his tracking speed increasing by several points.

Xu Yunfan was currently leaning against a century-old locust tree, gasping for breath.

He had rushed down from the top of the Accumulated Thunder Mountain in one breath, having long since left the boundaries of the Tian Chan Sect. He was considered temporarily safe for now.

He looked up. Night had fallen. The cold air at the edge of this ferry crossing had formed a mist, making it impossible to see clearly dozens of meters away.

Resting slightly, Xu Yunfan got up and was about to leave when he saw Chen Tiangang breaking through the mist and arriving.
