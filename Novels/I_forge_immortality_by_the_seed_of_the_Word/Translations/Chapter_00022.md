# Chapter 22: The Five Elements Spirit River – My First Battle (Combined)

Whoosh—  

The quiet cultivation chamber was filled with the continuous roar of surging waves.  

A vast amount of spiritual energy erupted from the Spirit Nourishing Pill in Zhang Jing’s abdomen, instantly engulfing the illusory great river connecting his five viscera and six bowels. It transformed into strands of ink-black spiritual power, converging into his dantian.  

At the same time, the dense spiritual energy permeating the cultivation chamber was also greedily absorbed by Zhang Jing.  

His cultivation level began to rise at an astonishing speed.  

Time passed slowly.  

“No wonder that senior from the Lianshan team said that without resources, I might not even make it into the top twenty in this assessment,” Zhang Jing murmured as he opened his eyes, a glimmer of realization flashing in his pitch-black pupils.  

Having experienced it firsthand, he now understood what the senior meant.  

In cultivation, having spirit pills and not having them were two entirely different matters—the gap between them was vast.  

However, what the senior didn’t know was that Zhang Jing could barely keep up with this gap thanks to the incomplete Profound Serpent Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme and the highly compatible Five Organs Water Elemental Guidance Technique.  

Not to mention now.  

With a smile, Zhang Jing stood up from the meditation mat, stretched his limbs slightly, and walked out.  

His purpose for renting the advanced cultivation chamber today wasn’t just this.  

Time was of the essence!  

As he took a light step forward, following his thoughts, the jade talisman slowly materialized.  

His gaze swept over it.  

**[Low-grade Spell: Ice Edge Formation – Level 1 (2/40)]**  
**Skill Trait: Sharpness (Low-grade)**  

Early this morning, Zhang Jing had discovered that the only spell he knew, Ice Edge Formation, had quietly appeared on the jade talisman’s skill list.  

Moreover, it had skipped the ‘Uninitiated’ stage entirely, directly reaching Level 1 and manifesting the **[Sharpness]** trait.  

Zhang Jing speculated that this might be because he had practiced it with his spiritual sense before.  

He wasn’t sure if it was an illusion, but it might also be due to the jade talisman’s skill proficiency effect.  

In any case, when he recalled the spell’s Dao patterns now, his familiarity was significantly higher than yesterday.  

Taking a deep breath—  

Zhang Jing raised his head and looked at the bronze humanoid target not far ahead.  

His spiritual sense deftly began outlining the complex Dao patterns of Ice Edge Formation, while the abundant spiritual power in his dantian was mobilized to fill the patterns.  

Four or five breaths later.  

A familiar crescent-shaped edge appeared at Zhang Jing’s fingertip—solid and gleaming with a chilling light.  

Compared to his first use of Ice Edge Formation yesterday, the current version, enhanced by the **[Sharpness]** trait, carried a sharp, icy aura that was at least twice as potent.  

Just looking at it was enough to make one’s hair stand on end.  

This reminded Zhang Jing of last night’s Ice Edge Formation, infused with the Profound Serpent Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme, which had nearly demolished his courtyard.  

Shaking his head, Zhang Jing focused his attention entirely on the bronze target.  

With a light tap of his finger in the air, the Ice Edge Formation transformed into a streak of light, shooting out seven or eight zhang in an instant before slashing fiercely into the bronze target.  

Bang!  

A low, resonant impact erupted, echoing repeatedly in the chamber.  

Tap, tap—  

Zhang Jing hurried forward to inspect the damage.  

The bronze target bore a long, narrow gash filled with white frost. But then, to his surprise, the target began to slowly heal.  

At the same time.  

A beam of spiritual light rose from the base of the bronze target, climbing upward.  

Eventually, the light stopped slightly above the middle of the second graduation mark. Having familiarized himself with the target beforehand, Zhang Jing immediately understood what this meant.  

“The spell’s attack power actually matches the full-force strike of an ordinary second-level Qi Refining cultivator? And it’s even above average among second-level practitioners.”  

Zhang Jing felt a surge of joy.  

This result exceeded his expectations. After all, he had only broken through to the first level of Qi Refinement yesterday, officially becoming a cultivator.  

Before long.  

Seeing the fully restored bronze target, Zhang Jing was tempted to test how powerful Ice Edge Formation would be under the combined effects of the **[Sharpness]** trait and the Profound Serpent Devours Emptiness Dao Rhyme.  

But after a moment’s thought, he dismissed the idea.  

Who knew if this bronze target had a recording function?  

Better to play it safe.  

In any case, Zhang Jing had a rough estimate—the dual-enhanced Ice Edge Formation’s power should reach the third level of Qi Refinement.  

As for where exactly it fell within that level, he wasn’t sure.  

“Now then—”  

Zhang Jing’s gaze involuntarily shifted to the jade talisman.  

**[Five Organs Water Elemental Guidance Technique – Level 1 (16/150)]**  
**Skill Trait: Five Elements Spirit River (Intermediate)**  

“Five Elements Spirit River?”  

Zhang Jing muttered the peculiar name softly while recalling the information about this skill trait.  

The Five Elements referred to the five phases—metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The term ‘Spirit’ denoted both the river’s name and the concept of spells.  

Spells transformed into fish, swimming freely in the great river that enveloped his body.  

As for which river this was—  

As if guided by divine inspiration, Zhang Jing’s thoughts stirred, and the sound of flowing water instantly surrounded him.  

A great river, like a projection, appeared around Zhang Jing.  

This was a river only he could see—the Spirit River.  

Zhang Jing’s expression turned solemn.  

He deftly cast the only spell he currently knew, Ice Edge Formation, and slowly guided it into the Spirit River.  

In an instant.  

The Ice Edge Formation flashed and transformed into a small, blade-like fish, swimming happily in the Spirit River.  

A strange connection formed between Zhang Jing and this little fish.  

It was as if, with a mere thought, the fish could leap out of the Spirit River at any moment, transforming into a deadly, chilling edge.  

“Currently, the Spirit River’s capacity is limited by my cultivation level—it can only hold five spell fish,” Zhang Jing mused, his eyes gleaming.  

“This is equivalent to having five additional spells I can deploy at any time. It might not sound like much, but in practice—it’s terrifying. And as my cultivation improves, the number of spell fish the Spirit River can hold will increase.”  

Perhaps in the near future.  

He, Zhang Jing, could casually flick his wrist and gift his enemies a deluge of ten thousand spells, then ask them how they felt about it.  

The thought brought a faint smile to his lips, but he quickly lowered his head in contemplation.  

Since the Spirit River could currently only hold five spells, he couldn’t afford to be careless in his selection.  

First, he would store two dual-enhanced Ice Edge Formation spells in the Spirit River as trump cards for emergencies.  

Next, he’d keep one ordinary Ice Edge Formation with the **[Sharpness]** trait as a basic option.  

As for the remaining two slots, Zhang Jing immediately thought of a low-grade defensive spell from the Five Organs Water Elemental Guidance Technique inheritance—Frostlight Mantra.  

Of course, the prerequisite was mastering the Frostlight Mantra first.  

After estimating the time required, he concluded it might still be feasible.  

With this in mind, Zhang Jing returned to the inner cultivation chamber.  

---  

The next day.  

Zhang Jing stepped out of the Miraculous Pill Pavilion with an impassive expression, quickly disappearing into the bustling crowd.  

This time, he had purchased five Spirit Nourishing Pills in one go.  

Given the speed at which the Gathering Yuan Spirit Light purified impurities in his dantian, these five pills would suffice for his cultivation needs during the Dao Academy’s assessment period—without compromising the purity of his spiritual power.  

With nearly twenty days left, if he made the most of it, he might even have a chance to break through to the second level of Qi Refinement.  

The thought quickened his pace.  

He needed to return and cultivate immediately.  

Not a single moment could be wasted.  

Yet the next instant, Zhang Jing suddenly remembered that his top priority upon returning wasn’t cultivation—it was repairing the wall!  

---  

On a shaded path at the outskirts of the Dragon Marsh Market.  

Two groups stood in a tense standoff, a murderous atmosphere thick in the air.  

To be precise, four men in black robes were confronting an elderly man in his seventies.  

One of the black-robed men held a young boy, slowly retreating, while the other three advanced menacingly toward the old man.  

“Old Shi, where’s the inheritance? Hand it over, or your grandson dies,” the black-robed man gripping the boy said coldly.  

The old man’s eyes burned with fury as he gritted his teeth and spat, “Xu Da, for the sake of an inheritance, you four have chased us for three thousand li, and now you dare to sneak into the Dragon Marsh Market to attack us? Have you lost your minds? If the Dao Academy investigates, how many lives will your Xu family have to offer in recompense?”  

“Enough nonsense. You know better than anyone how valuable this inheritance is. As for the Dao Academy’s investigation—what’s it to you? I’ll ask one last time: hand it over or not?”  

“Hmph,” the old man sneered. “Do you think I don’t know your kind? Let me be clear—I’ve hidden the inheritance somewhere in the market. Xu Da, if you so much as harm a hair on my grandson’s head, I swear you’ll never find that inheritance in this lifetime.”  

As soon as the words left his mouth.  

The man called ‘Xu Da’ flashed a cold smile and tightened his grip on the boy.  

A piercing scream tore through the air: “Grandfather—!”  

“Old Shi, I’ve just harmed your grandson. What are you going to do about it? And don’t give me any nonsense about the inheritance being lost—you know how fragile I am. I can’t handle such a devastating blow.”  

The boy’s agonized cries continued without pause.  

“Xu, you—”  

The old man trembled violently as he stared at his suffering grandson. Finally, as if all strength had left him, he collapsed to the ground and begged, “Stop! I’ll give you the inheritance. But I have one condition—”  

His gaze locked onto Xu Da with desperate resolve.  

“Let’s hear it.”  

Xu Da released his grip, and the boy thudded to the ground.  

“I won’t live through today, but Ming’er is still young—he can’t die here. Swear you won’t kill him and that you’ll find someone to take him in.”  

“I swear!” Xu Da nodded.  

“And the three of you!”  

The old man turned to the other three black-robed men.  

Finally.  

Under the expectant gazes of the four men, the old man, his pupils dilating, struggled to reach into his chest pocket. His voice was barely a whisper: “Remember… you swore…”  

“Damn it! So you really were carrying it all along, Old Shi. I swore too soon,” one of the black-robed men grumbled as he snatched the inheritance from the old man’s hand.  

Just then.  

A youthful figure radiating spiritual energy suddenly appeared in the four men’s line of sight, moving at incredible speed.  

Their eyes met.  

The four black-robed men’s expressions darkened simultaneously.  

“Boss, what do we do? Should we run?”  

“Run? Our spiritual signatures are already here. If the market’s enforcers track us, do you think we’ll get far?”  

“They have flying artifacts!”  

“Then what’s your plan, boss?”  

“This guy seems to be only at the first level of Qi Refinement, while we’re all at the second level. What’s there to fear? Kill him quickly, clean up the scene, and make sure the enforcers find no trace!”  

“Got it!”  

In the blink of an eye, Xu Da had formulated a flawless plan.  

“Third Brother, when the fight starts, stay hidden. Wait for his attention to be on us, then strike with your needle artifact—make sure it’s a one-hit kill!”  

“Second Brother, Fourth Brother, I’ll take the lead with my flying sword. You two flank him and attack from the sides.”  

“Remember, finish him as fast as possible!”  

“Understood, boss!”  

“Gentlemen, what if I told you I’m just an innocent passerby? Would you believe me?”  

Zhang Jing halted, his gaze sweeping over the three black-robed men closing in on him as he smiled faintly.  

“My apologies, fellow Daoist,” Xu Da said, his flying sword rising with a dangerous glint.  

“So no room for negotiation, then.”  

Zhang Jing’s smile vanished.  

A Spirit River, visible only to him, materialized in the air. The five peculiar little fish swimming within it suddenly grew restless.  

Two of the fish resembled blades, their bodies faintly shimmering with an eerie darkness.  

The remaining three were crystalline, their forms solid like ice sculptures.  

**[Low-grade Spell: Frostlight Mantra – Level 1 (3/40)]**  
**Skill Trait: Layered Light (Low-grade)**  

In the next moment.  

The three ice-like fish leaped from the water, transforming into three layers of icy-blue protective light that tightly encased Zhang Jing.  

These three layers of light subtly overlapped, merging into a single, formidable barrier.  

Since this was his first real battle, Zhang Jing didn’t think this was enough.  

He also activated the low-grade artifact, Cloudwater Shield, positioning it in front of him.  

Oh, and the Mind’s Eye Dao Seed!  

The Mind’s Eye slowly opened.  

Instantly, every movement in the surroundings was reflected in Zhang Jing’s consciousness.  

“There you are.”  

His gaze snapped toward a black-robed man who had stealthily positioned himself behind a nearby tree.  

At that very moment.  

A shrill whistling pierced the air.  

Zhang Jing turned his head.  

A flying sword, brimming with lethal intent, was hurtling straight toward him.  

His brow arched slightly as the Cloudwater Shield flashed into place, intercepting the sword just before impact.  

Clang!  

The sword was deflected.  

On the other side, Xu Da showed no surprise, merely controlling his flying sword to launch a relentless barrage of attacks.  

Meanwhile, the other two black-robed men had closed in from the sides.  

Their blades rose high before slashing down with brutal force.  

Yet, to their shock, the violent strikes landed on Zhang Jing’s protective light without so much as causing a ripple.  

Instead, the recoil sent numbing tremors up their arms.  

The men’s faces twisted in horror.  

How was this possible?!  

How could a mere first-level Qi Refining cultivator’s defensive spell be this impenetrable?  

“Second Brother, Fourth Brother, retreat!” Xu Da screamed in desperation.  

Realizing that their combined assault couldn’t even scratch Zhang Jing’s defenses—let alone break through—Xu Da instantly understood.  

They had stumbled upon an expert who enjoyed playing the fool.  

This man was definitely not just at the first level of Qi Refinement!  

Regret flooded his heart, but it was too late for second thoughts.  

Xu Da could only glance at Third Brother, pinning his hopes on the latter’s needle artifact landing a fatal sneak attack.  

When he looked back—  

A chilling, ink-black edge surged into his vision, growing larger and larger like a ferocious, coiling serpent.  

So cold… So cold he couldn’t feel his body anymore.  

Everything before him darkened.  

The last thing Xu Da saw was Third Brother’s needle artifact, after barely piercing the outermost layer of Zhang Jing’s protective light, falling powerlessly to the ground.  

Third Brother’s done for! We’re all done for!  

In his final moment of consciousness, a thought flashed through Xu Da’s mind:  

“Maybe… we never should have come to the Dragon Marsh Market. Then we wouldn’t have met this monster. Just how many layers of protective light did he stack on himself?”
