# Chapter 243: Xiao Li's Strange Affliction

"......"

Xiao Li watched the brocade clouds dance lightly in the wind, his scalp tingling.

He had once thought that plagiarizing poetry to show off was a thrilling experience.

But when it was his turn, he felt as if he were sitting on pins and needles.

Having the plagiarized poem mounted for all to see gave him a sense of public humiliation.

To be honest, he hadn't deeply understood the poem himself. It wasn't a masterpiece destined for immortality; it just felt appropriate for the scene...

"......"

Bai Jinghong and Cao Mu were stunned.

A good poem can evoke wonderful imagery, but this one...

*Is the bright moon my former self?*

*A single smile repays the cold of a thousand springs?*

They subconsciously looked at the young girl beside them.

You might as well use her name as the title!

Oh, it's called *Immortal by the River*. Then it all makes sense...

"If someone wrote something like this for me, I'd marry him on the spot," Miss She said, a bit tipsy from the emotion.

"How the hell am I supposed to learn this?" Wu Chushu's hands trembled.

He couldn't learn it. This was a skill he simply couldn't acquire.

This was the end of the road.

Li Mo had only taught him the method, not the process! How was he supposed to master this?

In the arena of showing off in public, he had lost by a huge margin...

"Brother Li, was that on purpose or an accident?"

"You said you weren't versed in literary arts!"

"Explain to me, what does 'the bright moon is my former self' mean? What does 'don't let down the person in the mirror' mean?"

The group couldn't hold it together anymore.

"Ah... it wasn't an accident."

His original intention was just to win a prize.

If he purely wanted to make a name for himself, he remembered plenty of famous moon poems from his nine years of compulsory education. Why would he use this one?

Meanwhile, the person at the center of it all, Ying Bing, had been lost in thought for a long time.

She didn't have a special interest in this field.

Yet, seeing these words before her felt like an unexpected encounter, yet also like a destined meeting. It was the thrill of a first meeting and the heart-fluttering feeling of long-term companionship.

No wonder he always wanted her to smile more.

"Li Mo."

"Hm?"

Hearing Ying Bing's voice, Xiao Li, who was in the middle of being roasted by his friends, turned around and froze.

The night breeze was slightly cool, and the autumn air made the girl's skirt sway gently.

In her gaze, a quiet moonlight seemed to flow.

She reached up and untied the red string from her hair, letting her three thousand black locks paint the shimmering night.

"The jade hairpin... I really like it."

Ying Bing gently gathered her hair, her lips pressed together.

At that moment, an impulse surged through Li Mo to step forward.

The poem was plagiarized.

The hairpin was an unexpected gift.

But the desire to put the hairpin in her hair for her was entirely genuine.

Xiao Li felt that no one could withstand such a test.

A frosty girl like her had obediently gathered her hair. How could he not put the hairpin in? How could he ignore her gaze?

"Come a little closer."

Li Mo's reaching hand was steadied by her. Her small hand was cool to the touch, but her palm was warm.

"Oh my god, isn't that the Empress and Jiang Chen?"

"Is it real or fake? Damn, we've bumped into the real deal? How much did the Number One Scholar Tower pay for this?"

"This is definitely the real deal, the Cold Fairy and Young Master Li!"

"Young Master Li won the top spot at the Number One Scholar Tower! His name is written up there!"

"I didn't know Young Master Li had such literary talent."

Indeed.

The brocade not only contained the poem, but Elder Zeng had even thoughtfully signed the name.

The already bustling area in front of the Number One Scholar Tower instantly boiled, much like frenzied fans meeting a celebrity in his previous life.

A prodigy on the Hidden Dragon List, and the real-life inspiration for *The Overbearing Empress Fell in Love with Me*—in terms of fame, he even surpassed a celebrity...

"......"

Li Mo leaned back slightly.

Discussing a plagiarized poem with others made him feel utterly ashamed.

Besides, if he got surrounded by everyone, how could he go on a date?

---

"Li Mo."

"Hm?"

Xiao Li suddenly felt the soft, warm jade in his palm tighten slightly. The coolness of her small hand was reassuring.

He glanced to the side and saw Ying Bing looking up at him, a hint of a smile in her eyes.

The girl who refused to be outdone by anyone in her life whispered:

"Let's run away."

Could those words really come from the mouth of an ice cube?

Li Mo nodded, and then, holding her hand, he took a step forward under the watchful eyes of the crowd.

The two of them ran away, draped in the lights of Yunzhou's sleepless night.

It felt... thrilling?

"......"

The three heroes of Hengyun were petrified on the spot. What were they here for again?

So?

What about us?

Wu Chushu actually had things to do, but the originally planned date location would have to be changed.

"Brother, are we still going to Magpie Bridge?"

"Not a chance!"

......

As they ran out of the market, the lights gradually dim.

Magpie Bridge was also lively, but the lights were surprisingly few. This wasn't because the place wasn't prosperous, but because those who came here for trysts were mostly lovers and couples.

Aside from someone like Ouyang, who had a massive appetite and wasn't afraid of being full, no one in their right mind would come here alone.

Quiet and dark... it was more convenient...

From the bustling crowd to sudden quiet, the transition from noise to tranquility gave a feeling of a lifetime passing.

By the shimmering riverbank.

Li Mo led Ying Bing to a bamboo grove, where the red Magpie Bridge was faintly visible.

Strange.

Why was his heartbeat so loud?

A proper Observation Realm martial artist who often trains his physique shouldn't be out of breath after just running a bit.

It must be because it's too quiet here.

"We should be able to see the fireworks from here in a bit," Li Mo said, sitting down.

However, before he could catch his breath, he glanced to the side and his heart skipped a beat again.

"Did you get a rock in your shoe?"

Ying Bing sat by the small river and took off her shoes. The fatal part was that today, she was wearing a pair of white silk socks. How had he not noticed this before...

She gently peeled off the silk socks with her fingers.

Her jade-like, smooth foot dipped into the small river, gently shattering the moonlight, before curling back.

*Drip—*

A water droplet fell from her toes, hitting the green stone and shattering into crystal.

"No."

"Then..."

"I didn't find an Autumn Festival gift earlier, and I don't know what you'd like from the market," Ying Bing said, looking down, her gaze calm.

Xiao Li felt the scenery here was truly beautiful.

The bright moon, the night breeze, the stream, the jade...

"So you think I'd like this? Ice cube, last time I was just being professional, it was a service requirement..." Li Mo took a sharp breath.

What a misunderstanding!

As everyone knows, Xiao Li is known outside as a gentle, jade-like, and modest gentleman.

How could a gentleman...

"So... what kind of service is this now?"

"!"

Li Mo looked down.

At some point, he had grabbed the fair, soft jade, and was even rubbing it quite vigorously, making the girl's foot turn a slight red.

"Ice cube."

"Hm?"

"Do you think there's a disease that makes you unable to control your hands... I'm an Observation Realm martial artist, this illness is truly formidable!"

"I haven't heard of it. Maybe."

"So, for the sake of my early recovery, could the other one also come over here?"

"?"

...
