# Chapter 106: Perfecting Qi Refinement

After returning to Yichuan, Lin Shan first visited the auction house. He appraised some treasures that had accumulated beyond the capabilities of the regular evaluators, then rented a cultivation cave in the city center for thirty spirit stones per month—securing it for two full years.

With the thousand spirit stones obtained from Zen Master Xingtai now in his possession, Lin Shan spent without hesitation. Such was the privilege of wealth.

Having made a two-year pact with the proprietress of Yanchun Pavilion, he knew he must seize every moment to cultivate. Breaking through to Foundation Establishment before heading to the Black Lotus Sect was his only chance to avoid becoming mere cannon fodder.

Thus began Lin Shan's year-long seclusion.

...

"This truly lives up to being Yichuan's most expensive cave—the spiritual energy concentration is thirty times that of the outside world!" 

"Logically, reaching the peak of late-stage Qi Refinement would take thirty years in normal conditions. Here, it only took one."

"Is this the allure of cultivating with wealth?"

Dust scattered as Lin Shan opened his long-sealed cave. Sensing his cultivation had reached its absolute limit, he realized he had truly completed the entire path of Qi Refinement and now touched the bottleneck to Foundation Establishment.

Ninth level Qi Refinement—perfection!

However, the bottleneck to Foundation Establishment was fundamentally different from previous hurdles in Qi Refinement. 

Breaking through the early and mid-stage Qi Refinement bottlenecks merely required accumulating sufficient spiritual power to expand the dantian's capacity. But the Foundation Establishment bottleneck demanded not only breaking through the mysterious acupoints but also achieving a qualitative transformation of divine sense.

The initial spiritual awareness gained during Qi Refinement only enhanced one's senses and allowed perception and absorption of ambient spiritual energy. 

The divine sense transformation at Foundation Establishment involved the initial "harmonization of qi and spirit," laying the foundation for the true "refining qi into spirit" in later stages.

Why could Foundation Establishment cultivators traverse the skies and wield flying swords? Why could they perform soul attacks and mental communication?

Because their divine sense had reached a level of flexible control—complete mastery over release and retraction.

Thus, after perfecting the ninth level of Qi Refinement, the challenges to stepping into Foundation Establishment were immense. It would be no exaggeration to say that ninety-nine percent of cultivators in the cultivation world were stuck at this stage.

Achieving "harmonization of qi and spirit" solely through personal effort or with elders' guidance was unreliable. The cultivation world universally acknowledged that the most effective method was the "Foundation Establishment Pill."

The Foundation Establishment Pill offered three major benefits:

First, it provided vast amounts of breakthrough energy to assist in overcoming the barrier.

Second, it increased the success rate of achieving the harmonization of qi and spirit.

Third—and most crucially—even if the breakthrough attempt failed after consuming the pill, it would not leave behind "Dao Scars."

...

"Dao Scars" was a general term in the cultivation world, present at every major realm. 

Typically, when a cultivator failed a breakthrough, "Dao Scars" would manifest, subtly making subsequent attempts more difficult and the bottleneck more formidable.

Foundation Establishment was the first true hurdle on the path of cultivation, so the "Dao Scars" at this stage were not yet overwhelmingly insurmountable—they could still be erased by the Foundation Establishment Pill.

However, for later bottlenecks like Golden Core or even Nascent Soul, "Dao Scars" would become virtually irreversible.

Many centuries-old monsters found their cultivation permanently stagnant precisely because accumulated "Dao Scars" had completely severed their path forward!

But the thought of the Foundation Establishment Pill gave Lin Shan a headache.

Not for any profound reason—he simply lacked the funds.

At last year's grand auction, most Foundation Establishment Pills had been claimed by major sects and cultivation clans, leaving only ten for rogue cultivators to fight over.

The problem? Each of those ten pills had a minimum price of five thousand spirit stones!

After deducting rent and adding his annual salary from the Yichuan Auction House, Lin Shan only had fifteen hundred spirit stones—not even half of what he needed.

An ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator's liquid assets typically amounted to around two thousand spirit stones, excluding personal belongings. By that measure, Lin Shan was already wealthy among Qi Refinement peers.

But this world always had someone richer, someone more privileged.

Wealthy prodigies emerged every year, and they were never in short supply. Hoping for the Foundation Establishment Pill's price to drop? Impossible!

The ingredients required to refine the pill were centuries-old spiritual herbs, only cultivable by ancient sects or within rare natural secret realms.

Thus, beyond what major sects consumed internally, the number of Foundation Establishment Pills circulating each year was pitifully small—far from enough to satisfy the cultivation world's factions.

If you couldn't afford it, countless others would scramble to pay, all for that increased chance at breaking through to Foundation Establishment.

After all, becoming a Foundation Establishment cultivator was akin to ascending to heaven in a single step.

...

Lin Shan scratched his head in frustration and stepped out of his cave to check for any messages left during his year-long seclusion.

To his surprise, numerous message talismans had accumulated in his absence, fluttering about the main chamber, unread.

He gathered them one by one. Most were from the auction house appraisers—with the annual auction approaching in two days, they had accumulated many unidentified consignments and urgently needed their chief appraiser to take charge.

Others were from old acquaintances. For instance, Lin Fan had sent a letter—since the Purple Heaven Sect was too distant for message talismans to reach, he had employed "messengers," the cultivation world's equivalent of couriers, to deliver it.

Lin Fan's letter was mostly complaints: feeling stifled, yearning to travel and seek treasures, being "overstuffed" to the point of discomfort...

Lin Shan pondered but couldn't quite grasp what exactly was "overstuffed." Could it be "fortune"? Did the "Child of Fortune" need to expend his accumulated luck?

So even the "chosen one" had his troubles?

This thought somewhat comforted Lin Shan. Though Lin Fan lacked for nothing in opportunities, he missed out on many experiences.

For example, though wealthy, he never knew the taste of poverty;

Though treasures fell into his lap effortlessly, he lost the joy of struggle;

Though rewards came without labor... well...

Lin Shan gave up on this line of self-comfort—the more he thought, the more bitter he felt—and moved on to other letters.

Some were from the talisman and spell stall owners he'd met in the market district—those "pseudo-immortal second generations" from cultivation clans.

These two had likely spammed their entire contact lists with mass messages: "The cultivation world is restless lately," "The demonic path is stirring," "Everyone stay safe," "Special discounts on talismans/spells at my stall," and so on.

Lin Shan skimmed without interest. He never replied to spam in his past life, let alone now when messenger fees were exorbitant. With his spirit stones insufficient even for a Foundation Establishment Pill, why waste them on replies?

After a quick review, he headed straight to the auction house to check this year's offerings. 

Though short on funds, what if a Foundation Establishment Pill appeared? There might still be a chance...

...

The moment he stepped through the auction house doors, a maidservant who seemed to have been waiting for him approached with a bow.

"Master Lin, Patriarch Zuo is currently taking tea in the fifth-floor reception hall. He instructed this humble servant to escort you there immediately upon your arrival."
