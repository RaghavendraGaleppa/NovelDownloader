Chapter 73: Rebirth After Death

“Foundation Establishment cultivators build the immortal foundation of the Grand Dao, tempering their physical body to refine mortal essence. With their six sense organs tranquil, they refine form into qi, gathering the five qi to the origin. The three yang converge at the crown, and when merit is complete and form forgotten, the immortal embryo forms naturally. With yin exhausted and yang purified, a body beyond the body emerges. Only then can one transcend substance and ascend to immortality, surpassing the mortal and entering the saintly,从此位列仙班谢绝凡俗, from then on joining the ranks of immortals and parting ways with the mundane.”

Inside the cave dwelling, Lu Yang sat cross-legged on a meditation mat, silently contemplating.

“This step of Foundation Establishment, different cultivation techniques describe it differently, but no matter which one, when it comes down to practice, the steps are actually not very different.”

It is to use one's own true qi as a foundation, uplift the Sea of Consciousness, and refine the form to ascend.

For example, the *Nine Transformations of the Dragon Art* he cultivated, upon completion, allows one to forge the third-grade true qi, 'True Dragon Malice'.

The more advanced Foundation Establishment technique, the *Myriad Chariot Dragon Ascension Scroll*, explicitly describes how to complete the form-refining ascension through True Dragon Malice.

Here, the importance of true qi grade becomes clear.

If the true qi grade is insufficient, one might either fail to lift the Sea of Consciousness, or exhaust their strength and qi midway through the ascension, plummeting down to a gruesome death.

The entire process of Foundation Establishment is such a path of ascension.

And the end of this path of ascension is the 'Foundation Establishment Realm'.

Upon reading this, Lu Yang couldn't help but exclaim, “The Foundation Establishment Realm, the Foundation Establishment Realm! So it doesn't refer to a cultivation stage, but a physical place!”

That being said, ascension is only the first step.

After a cultivator uplifts their Sea of Consciousness and completely ascends into the Foundation Establishment Realm, they must begin to forge their own immortal foundation to ensure they can remain in the Foundation Establishment Realm.

This is another major hurdle.

Even ordinary cultivators who complete the ascension step usually exhaust their inner reserves, resulting in only being able to barely construct a tottering immortal foundation.

The result is an unstable immortal foundation, unable to withstand the pressure of the Foundation Establishment Realm, and collapsing with a thunderous roar.

While failing ascension might still offer a slim chance of survival, the collapse of one's immortal foundation means certain death for the cultivator. Luo Wuya likely fell at this stage.

One must know that when a cultivator ascends to the Foundation Establishment Realm and begins forging their immortal foundation, besides requiring a solid cultivation base, infinite demonic thoughts will also spontaneously arise within them. If one's Dao Heart is not firm and their mind is restless, they will inevitably be influenced by these demonic thoughts. In such a case, no matter how profound their foundation, it would be futile.

"Every step is truly fraught with difficulty."

After Lu Yang thoroughly reviewed the process of breaking through to Foundation Establishment, he committed all the content, secrets, and crucial points of the *Myriad Chariot Dragon Ascension Scroll* to memory.

Immediately after, he took out the Ascension Token and began circulating energy within it in his palm.

The next second, the Ascension Token transformed into a stream of light and flew into his Sea of Consciousness, illuminating his mind with clarity, and making his entire body feel as if it were floating in immortal bliss.

With eyes closed, Lu Yang immediately entered a state of meditative absorption.

Within his Dantian, a wisp of true qi materialized, growing scales, claws, teeth, and whiskers, finally transforming into a vivid, lifelike true dragon.

Boom!

With a colossal roar, this true dragon left his Dantian, ascended through the Ren and Du meridians, passed through the Jiang Palace, entered the Purple Mansion, and went straight into the depths of his Sea of Consciousness!

Immediately after, Lu Yang felt the heavens brighten before his eyes. His originally boundless true qi, which seemed inexhaustible, now gushed out like water released from a floodgate, transforming into an indescribable immense force that pushed his Sea of Consciousness, gradually ascending higher!

"Fortunately, I have this Ascension Token..."

Lu Yang's mind was clear. Uplifting the Sea of Consciousness into the void was no easy feat. Originally, there should have been nine layers of Heaven and Earth barriers obstructing him, and breaking through each would inevitably consume a vast amount of primordial qi.

However, with the blessing of the Ascension Token bestowed by True Lord Yinshan, all nine layers of Heaven and Earth barriers opened wide, making his path of ascension unobstructed.

More importantly, he wasn't ascending from the very bottom.

"Because I cultivated the 'Saint's Steal', I inherently possess a certain celestial rank, so strictly speaking, I actually began my ascension from mid-air."

The journey of ascension was thus shortened by a small segment.

Though it seemed like a small segment, it could very well have been the straw that broke the camel's back, saving Lu Yang an immeasurable amount of effort and mental energy.

The Saint's Steal and the Ascension Token each resolved a tribulation on Lu Yang's path of ascension, while the third-grade 'True Dragon Malice' provided Lu Yang with a sufficiently profound foundation, ensuring he wouldn't have to worry about running out of true qi midway through his flight, allowing him to steadily ascend into the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Thus, an unknown amount of time passed.

Lu Yang felt the brilliant celestial light before his eyes gradually dim, as if he had passed through a region, and an boundless expanse of land appeared in his vision.

Lowering his head, Lu Yang was astonished to see himself.

Besides that, he also saw Yinshan Mountain, the Primordial Saint Sect, the mountains, rivers, sun, and moon, and the myriad beings busily going about their lives.

Or rather—the mortal realm.

He had witnessed this scene once before, on Skull Mountain, when True Lord Yinshan showed him a great battle between Foundation Establishment cultivators. It was precisely this sight.

However, at that time, his true spirit was obscured, and he couldn't clearly discern the forms of the Foundation Establishment True Lords, only their released magical light. If he had a chance to see it again, he should be able to see more clearly. In fact, at this very moment, he could see a figure sitting calmly in the nearest northwest direction.

It was True Lord Yinshan.

The immortal foundation beneath him was a colossal black mountain; though it stretched for ten thousand *li*, it appeared minuscule in the boundless Foundation Establishment Realm.

At the same time, True Lord Yinshan seemed to have noticed him.

The next second, a voice slowly drifted over:

"Focus your mind, do not get distracted."

The voice, like the tinkling of a clear spring, poured down and instantly washed away Lu Yang's emotions. He then startlingly realized, "Demonic thoughts invaded, triggering my distracting thoughts!?"

Thinking this, Lu Yang dared not delay further. He immediately focused his attention on the Foundation Establishment Realm. The effects of the Saint's Steal, the Ascension Token, and the third-grade true qi had all been utilized to their maximum. From this point on, he would have to rely on himself. Lu Yang gradually gathered his true qi and began to construct his immortal foundation.

However, he soon discovered a problem.

"Not enough true qi..."

That momentary distraction just now caused him to inexplicably lose thirty percent of his true qi, exacerbating his already dwindling supply, making it difficult to continue.

Helpless, Lu Yang had no choice but to reduce the scale of his immortal foundation.

The size of an immortal foundation often corresponds to a Foundation Establishment True Lord's potential, cultivation, and magical power. By reducing its scale, he was sacrificing his future potential for the sake of achieving a breakthrough.

He continued to cut it down until it was half its original size, and only then was his true qi barely sufficient.

But the next second, Lu Yang saw True Lord Yinshan, who was beside him, suddenly rise and stride towards him, letting out a chilling cackle: "Heheheh."

"Good, good, the immortal foundation is built."

"It wasn't in vain for me to put in the effort to help you. My spiritual treasure is currently lacking an immortal foundation to complete it. Junior Brother Lu, you truly did not disappoint my expectations; you are excellent material!"

Before his words finished, True Lord Yinshan stretched out a hand!

A familiar sensation, a familiar terror. Lu Yang had personally witnessed True Lord Yinshan make a move before. The power displayed by the other party at this moment was identical to what he remembered...

Wait, identical?

"No!"

Lu Yang suddenly awoke. The True Lord Yinshan in his memory was dealing with the Old Ancestor of the Yun family. Why would he need such a grand display to deal with him? A single glance would have been enough.

This is fake!

The next second, Lu Yang's vision blurred. When he looked again, the demonic thoughts had receded. True Lord Yinshan was still sitting calmly in his original spot, merely letting out a regretful sigh:

"Junior Brother, what a pity."

Lu Yang lowered his head in response, only to see that the immortal foundation he had just painstakingly constructed was already riddled with holes, due to being influenced by demonic thoughts for just an instant.

Seeing this, Lu Yang could only give a helpless smile: "What misery..."

Rumble!

Before his words faded, the sound of his immortal foundation shattering reverberated throughout the Foundation Establishment Realm, even triggering changes in the external heavenly phenomena. The wind howled mournfully, like the wails of the heavens.

As Lu Yang committed this experience to memory, he silently chanted in his heart:

"Hundred-Life Scroll!"
