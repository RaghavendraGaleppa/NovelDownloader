# Chapter 3: Entering the City and Living Together

The morning bustle began early at the post station.

Many of the young men and women traveling together were either practicing their martial arts outside or eating breakfast heartily.

Various morning dishes were laid out on the tables in the center.

Li Mo casually picked up a meat bun and glanced sideways with his peripheral vision.

The girl before him had only a bowl of plain rice porridge, as light and plain as her appearance.

"Eating just this for breakfast, how can that be enough?"

Li Mo pushed the plate of eggs toward her.

Ying Bing said nothing, merely lifting her eyes to look at him.

The girl seemed somewhat weak, her lips lacking any color, her sickly appearance adding a touch of fragility to her beauty.

But anyone stared at by those beautiful eyes would likely feel a sense of guilt unconsciously.

"Ahem."

Li Mo felt a bit embarrassed.

Thinking back on his past actions, even he found them cringeworthy.

It was only right to apologize to her.

"About what happened before, I'm sorry. I don't expect to resolve our differences with just a few words. If you have anger in your heart, then..."

"It's fine."

Ying Bing peeled the eggshell and said lightly.

Li Mo was taken aback.

He saw no insincerity on the girl's face.

It was less about forgiveness and more about indifference.

Those matters didn't seem worth holding onto at all.

Since she never cared, there was no need for forgiveness.

"Alright."

Li Mo苦笑 (wry smile).

He had read too many novels and was being naive.

It had to be said, Ying Bing's reaction was more in line with the evaluation of the Heaven's Eye of Destiny.

Those who remain unmoved by favor or disgrace often go further.

And so it was.

Ying Bing's cheeks moved slightly as she ate, and she gave Li Mo no further attention.

She had seen countless magnificent and splendid scenes.

Besides her family, memories from her humble beginnings didn't even count as a page in her life, having long been swept into some unknown corner.

In distant memories, Li Mo had average talent and barely managed to enter the Qingyuan Sect.

He languished in the outer sect for a year before being eliminated from the sect.

And at that time, she had already become the most dazzling existence among her peers.

Li Mo seemed to have changed somewhat.

But, it didn't matter.

His name would probably not even be found on the rankings of the Eastern Wilderness Domain in the future.

They might not even be passers-by in each other's lives.

She never wasted her thoughts on irrelevant people.

Across from him, Li Mo's eating movements paused slightly.

[Investment Successful. Investment: One Egg, One Bowl of Plain Porridge.]
[Reward Calculation in Progress...]
[Congratulations, Host. Reward: One Thousand Taels of Silver Bills.]

[One Thousand Taels of Silver Bills]: "Issued by Hengtong Bank, valid at all major money houses."

Li Mo couldn't help but sigh with emotion.

If only she could eat a little more.

Three meals a day could eat him into a fortune.

Supper—tonight, he must prepare supper!

......

Two days later.

A magnificent city appeared in the distance, like a giant beast lying beneath the vast sky.

Ziyang Prefecture was one of the Twelve Prefectures of the Eastern Wilderness, governing nine commanderies and thirty-six counties. Legend has it that before the founding of the Great Yu Dynasty, this place was the ancient capital of the previous dynasty. It once enjoyed a period of outstanding talent and extreme prosperity.

Later, an unprecedented disaster beast tide lasted for hundreds of years in the Eastern Wilderness, turning its glory into a fading afterglow.

It wasn't until Emperor Wu ascended the throne, pacified the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, and greatly rewarded those who had contributed, that the First Ancestor of the Qingyuan Sect, having followed the dragon's path to success, was granted the title of Lord of Ziyang.

After thousands of years of governance, the area recovered its vitality and prosperity once again.

The Ziyang Prefecture City at the foot of Qingyuan Mountain was rebuilt upon the ruins of the ancient capital. A glimpse of it reveals its extraordinary grandeur.

Fifty miles past the city lies the famous Qingyuan Mountain Range.

"We've finally arrived."

"This is the Prefecture City? It's huge. Standing under the city gate, I feel like an ant."

"It's so lively. As the seat of a prefecture, it's truly bustling with people."

"The Qingyuan Sect is about to open its gates to recruit disciples, so of course, there are many people."

......

There were many convoys coming and going. The massive city gate was like a floodgate opening, with the noise of carriages and horses continuing incessantly.

Looking at the Qingyuan Mountain from afar, many people showed expressions of longing.

The Great Yu Dynasty was founded on martial prowess and ruled alongside sects!

In the sky above Ziyang Prefecture, there was only one cloud, and that was the Qingyuan Sect!

The young men and women who came from various counties and commanderies were already extremely excited, shouting and yelling.

Passersby showed no surprise,显然 (obviously) long accustomed to this.

"It is indeed an extraordinary sight."

Li Mo couldn't help but sigh.

Having seen various international metropolises in his previous life, he was still deeply moved upon arriving here.

Compared to the steel and concrete skyscrapers, this magnificent ancient city with carved beams and painted rafters was显然 (obviously) more spectacular.

A city capable of accommodating five million people and an ancient city capable of accommodating five million people are not the same concept at all.

"Travel permit."

The city guards were clad in armor, their silver armor gleaming in the sunlight, standing like iron towers.

The steward quickly presented an iron plate and paid a string of coins as the entry fee.

Thus, the carriage was allowed into the city, as if stepping into another world.

Li Mo looked at everything with novelty, like a country bumpkin entering the city.

His pockets had grown quite full over the past two days.

The three daily meals of the ice lump girl had actually earned him over ten thousand silver bills and even a thousand taels of gold.

But upon entering the寸土寸金 (land is as valuable as gold) Prefecture City, Li Mo didn't feel so wealthy anymore.

"Young Master, now that we've come to Ziyang Prefecture City, it's not like being in the county."

The steward drove the carriage, reminding him in a low voice.

"I won't be staying in the city for more than a couple of days anyway," Li Mo smiled.

Going on a long journey, his father had to have the steward who watched him grow up accompany him, showing just how much of a troublemaker Li Mo used to be.

This was to prevent him from acting willfully and causing trouble.

"Young Master is right," the steward sighed in relief, nodding repeatedly.

This young master who loved to cause trouble had changed a lot recently.

---

He could relax a bit.

The carriage crossed a vermilion-painted bridge, passing over the dense ships below.

Not only was the city larger, but the residents' demeanor was also vastly different. There were明显 (obviously) more people wearing silk and satin, and various luxurious carriages could be seen.

For example, the one coming from the opposite side was pulled by four red, scaled foals.

The carriage compartment was several times larger than the one Li Mo was riding in, inlaid with gold and jade, simple and elegant.

"Cousin!"

Suddenly, someone shouted from behind.

It was Wang Hu. He dismounted his horse with a face full of joy and ran to the front of the carriage.

A young man got off the carriage, tall and wearing a white brocade robe.

His arms were long, his stance stable and powerful, and his walk had a certain dragon-like stride and tiger-like pace.

He also hung a waist token from his belt, on which were written two powerful characters: 'Inner Sect'.

Inner Sect of the Qingyuan Sect!

Everyone's gaze toward Wang Hu suddenly became more cautious.

Don't look at how many people were traveling together; it was a minority who could enter the Outer Sect, let alone the Inner Sect.

A single word of difference between Inner and Outer Sect meant a world of difference. An Inner Sect disciple could be respectfully invited by a county magistrate if they visited a county.

"Xiao Hu, I figured you were almost here," the young man smiled, sweeping his gaze over the crowd, his eyes lingering on Li Mo for a moment.

"You're new here, I suppose you don't know where to stay."

"There's an inn owner I'm familiar with, why don't you go there?"

The young man smiled leisurely and got back into the carriage.

"My cousin is Wang Hao. In his early thirties, he's already an Inner Sect disciple."

"Following him, we definitely won't suffer any losses."

Wang Hu raised his head, a look of arrogance flashing across his face, as if it were he who had entered the Inner Sect.

Naturally, the crowd offered a round of flattery.

Being in an unfamiliar place, being able to follow an Inner Sect disciple from the Fulong Valley could save them a lot of trouble.

"What's he looking at?"

Li Mo was stunned for a moment, then reacted.

The other party wasn't looking at him, but at the cold girl beside him.

That's right.

Even in the Prefecture City, Ying Bing's stunning beauty had not diminished in the slightest.

Her simple clothing made the city women dressed in silk and satin pale in comparison.

Over these past few days of feeding, their relationship had... surely made some progress?

At least they shouldn't be strangers anymore.

As thoughts churned, a restaurant appeared ahead by the canal.

It was seven stories high, an aura of luxury rushing toward them. The customs of this ancient city reached their peak here.

The waiter had sharp eyes. Seeing Wang Hao, he immediately went to call the innkeeper.

The innkeeper respectfully served tea and negotiated with Wang Hao. The others felt a bit awkward.

They had just looked.

The most ordinary room here cost twenty taels of silver, and the superior rooms were even more expensive. Moreover, because the Qingyuan Sect was about to open its gates, there were many guests, and the prices had gone up.

"A hundred taels for a superior room?"

Li Mo glanced at it and walked straight to the counter.

There was no need to save this bit of money.

"Excuse me, two superior rooms."

One for him, one for Ying Bing.

The steward and the accompanying people had already put down their luggage and left with the escort agency.

"Sorry, sir, we don't have many rooms left. People traveling together can only get one room," the clerk at the counter said apologetically.

"Alright."

Li Mo thought for a moment and nodded.

"Green Plum Room on the second floor, please keep this."

Just as the money was paid and the clerk was about to hand over the sandalwood room key, Wang Hu's mocking voice came:

"Be happy just to have a place to stay安排 (arranged) for you. A hundred taels of silver in Ziyang Prefecture doesn't make you a big shot. Having money doesn't necessarily mean you can do whatever you want here."

Li Mo: "?"

He remembered now.

This guy was the son of the boss of the Liuhe Gang in the county.

His own father was the County Lieutenant, in charge of the county's public security.

Their fathers were like cat and mouse, so naturally, the two sons didn't see eye to eye.

At the same time.

Not far away.

Wang Hao also walked back to the nervous young men and women, pretending to be apologetic:

"There are only thirteen superior rooms left. Since you're all my cousin's fellow townsmen, you'll have to make do."

"It's fine, it's fine. We can squeeze in."

"Thank you, Brother Wang. You're really a good person."

The group was overjoyed and thanked him repeatedly.

Li Mo couldn't help but laugh.

How can someone apologize to others while carrying their hands behind their back and holding their chin high?

The three things men think about most in their lives are nothing more than:

One: Find a way to show off.
Two: That girl is so beautiful.
Three: That girl is so beautiful, I must find a way to show off in front of her.

As expected, Wang Hao looked at Ying Bing again and said:

"Miss, there are no rooms left. Fortunately, I have a private room here. No one usually lives there, and it's kept quite clean."

"If you don't mind, why don't you stay there?"

His tone was very confident.

This trick wasn't used for the first time. For girls from small places like this, it was a hundred times effective.

Look at the envy and jealousy in the eyes of the few rural women next door?

A person with a higher status who offers kindness and can help with one's future—very few people can resist this.

"No rooms left?"

Ying Bing glanced at the innkeeper with her peripheral vision.

"That's right... uh, yes."

The innkeeper's back chilled, wiping his sweat as he nodded repeatedly.

Wang Hao opened his mouth to say something with a smile, but the next moment, his smile froze on his face.

The girl took the sandalwood room key from in front of Li Mo and walked straight up to the second floor, to the Green Plum Room.

*Slam.*

The wooden door closed.

"Sigh."

Looking at Wang Hao, whose face turned from green to white, Li Mo subconsciously found it amusing, but couldn't quite laugh.

Looking for entertainment?

Look in the mirror!

Shaking his head, he also went up to the second floor.
