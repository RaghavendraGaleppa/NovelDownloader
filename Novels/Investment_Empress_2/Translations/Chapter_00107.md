Chapter 107: Li Mo: "I'm Coming In"

Lingerie.

These four characters, when separated, were all recognizable.

But put together, Ying Bing tilted her head slightly, unable to comprehend them.

Was it some kind of clothing?

"Take it out and let me see..."

Ying Bing thought for a moment. Perhaps it was some rare item she had never seen before.

【This item does not belong to this world. The host may be unaware of its purpose or how to wear it.】

【Yes/No?】

Not a product of this world?

Ying Bing's cold, clear eyes brightened as she noticed those four characters.

No wonder the System's existence was something even she couldn't understand.

Could the world the System comes from be... the legendary final destination of immortals who ascend within the mortal realm?

Then could this... be an immortal's garment?

If so, perhaps this clothing has some special use...

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and pondered for a moment.

"Yes."

The next second.

A hazy white light suddenly emanated from her body.

Ah.

It was the despicable holy light.

Even Ying Bing herself could not see exactly what the clothing looked like for the time being.

But she could feel it.

Very light, very cool, very close-fitting.

It was just a bit tight around the chest...

It clung to her body, feeling somewhat like a spiderweb structure?

Ying Bing grew increasingly curious about what this clothing actually looked like.

Suddenly.

A pair of furry cat ears appeared on her head.

"Hm?"

Ying Bing was stunned.

Then.

The holy light dissipated.

"......"

Ying Bing turned her head and saw her reflection in the mirror.

Cat ears. A cat tail.

This clothing...

If you say she was wearing it, not a single place that should be covered was covered.

If you say she wasn't wearing it, there was indeed fabric draped over her body...

It was like wearing nothing.

The material did resemble something like black cloud gauze...

If Little Li were here right now, he would surely shout out loud:

"Holy crap, a succubus cat-girl!"

"This... is clothing?"

Ying Bing's jade-like face froze, her ice-mirror-like eyes trembling slightly.

【Reply, Host, yes.】

【It is clothing with a special purpose.】

Ying Bing: "?"

【Using a term from this world to understand it, this special purpose is...】

【Dual Cultivation.】

Ying Bing: "??"

If it were the past, she would have ignored it, expressionlessly changing back into her original clothes, acting as if nothing had happened.

A mere embarrassing piece of clothing could not affect her state of mind in the slightest.

But, she had just finished 'Dual Cultivation'.

The final layer of the Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh...

"呼....." (Haa...)

Ying Bing let out a soft breath, calming the anomaly in her heart.

"Change my clothes back."

Change back, and this matter will be treated as if it never happened, never happened...

【Reminder: The outfit change cooldown is fifteen minutes.】

【Countdown: 12:52... 12:21...】

Ying Bing: "....."

She was returning to the Clear Abyss Sect today, and the carriage was probably arriving soon.

Anyway, she would never wear this clothing again no matter what.

So she pulled hard.

The seemingly fragile spiderweb-like structure went taut, yet it didn't suffer a single bit of damage.

【Considering the Host's powerful strength, to prevent easy damage during use, this set of clothing has undergone special reinforcement.】

【Like the System's own existence, it cannot be destroyed.】

To some extent.

The System was quite thoughtful.

But why in such aspects?

Ying Bing could only turn her head away, no longer looking at the mirror.

She calmed her mind, and a golden feather appeared in her palm. It looked like colored glaze, radiating infinite divine light, and was extraordinarily miraculous.

The many phenomena of this feather were all bound within a tiny space by the System's inexplicable power; otherwise, it would stir the clouds in all directions in an instant.

"It is indeed a True Phoenix Plume."

"With it, I can begin to condense the second type of Inner Breath..."

In her previous life, she did not have her current martial arts experience.

But she could still fight above her level and be invincible among her peers. Her reliance was the dual Inner Breaths.

---

One was condensed from Taiyin Qi.

The other was condensed from the Phoenix Qi of the Xia Soul.

Further steps would allow her to condense two Xuan Dan, complementing each other.

This was not unprecedented. Before her, a few famous strong individuals had walked this path, and later they all shook the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Later, countless people tried, but successful ones were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

Not everyone has two main meridians.

The wonders of the True Phoenix Plume do not end there.

With it, she could also perform special martial arts, such as 'True Phoenix Blood Burning Art' and 'True Phoenix Transformation'.

In her previous life, she had also seen a True Phoenix Plume, but it was much dimmer than this one, and it was broken...

The value of the True Phoenix Plume is absolutely not inferior to a divine weapon, and its rarity is even greater.

Ying Bing's emotions calmed down.

【The Host has completed this punishment.】

【The next ranking will begin in one month.】

【Do you wish to开启 the Loser's Punishment? If开启, the rewards will be more generous.】

Ying Bing's gaze was as clear as a jade spring, reflecting two options.

【Yes/No?】

These two characters seemed to carry some kind of magic.

The True Phoenix Plume was slightly tightened in that slender hand.

【Loser's Punishment,开启 successfully.】

In every era, only the number one person can become an immortal.

But the higher the realm, the more one can feel that this is not a rumor.

There is an eighty percent chance, it is true.

In the vast and boundless Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, only one person can become an immortal.

"How could I not strive for the top spot?"

Ying Bing murmured to herself, while the sunny smiling face of a youth involuntarily surfaced in her mind.

He, who left little impression on her in her previous life.

In this life, in such a short time, such a dramatic change had occurred.

Everything about him seemed vivid in her mind, lingering, hard to forget.

If I become an immortal, what about him...

There is an old saying that is very true.

People tend to get what they think of.

踏—— (Ta—)

Footsteps suddenly came from outside.

As is well known, Little Li never liked knocking on doors in the past.

Now, entering Ying Bing's room is like returning to his own.

"Bing Duozi."

"I'm coming in哈 (ha)."

A familiar voice.

Ying Bing's expression remained unmoved, but the fur on her ears and tail trembled as if shocked.

She turned her head to look.

The door had already been opened a crack...

砰—— (Bang—)

"Ah, this."

Outside, Li Mo took two steps back, completely confused.

He clearly felt the door was slammed shut.

Having been together for so long, he should have gotten used to it by now. What was going on today?

"Are you okay?" Little Li asked in confusion.

"Don't... casually enter my... room."

Li Mo: "....."

If he hadn't recognized Bing Duozi's voice, he would have thought it was Little Princess Jiang inside.

It was just... so sudden.

Although she was never there when he woke up every time.

After all, they slept together just yesterday.

Acting so distant today, not even letting him enter the room.

Little Li was momentarily stunned. Had he done something to offend her?

Thinking it through left and right, he couldn't figure it out, and Li Mo couldn't help but smile bitterly in his heart.

A woman's heart is as hard to find as a needle in the sea...

Well, she had been quite approachable这段时间 (during this period), not like the Heavenly Empress Phoenix Empress described by the Destiny Divine Eye.

Even an ordinary woman wouldn't let a man enter her boudoir casually...

It was he who lacked a sense of boundaries.

"The carriage has been waiting downstairs for half an hour."

"If you're packed, come down哈 (ha)."

"I know."

Li Mo heard the response and turned to go downstairs.

Inside the door.

The cat ears twitched.

Listening to the footsteps fade away.

Ying Bing, leaning against the door, silently let out a breath.

Her outfit change countdown still had three minutes.

If he had just come in and seen...

She wouldn't know how to face Li Mo in the future.

Ying Bing herself didn't notice.

Her bean-sized, jade-like toes were lightly curling against the floor...
