## Chapter 11: Front Mountain

As the vast plain came into view, the initial excitement soon gave way to a long and anxious wait. However, the journey was much smoother compared to before, and the bumpy ride that had nearly shattered their bones was now a thing of the past.

Lying down in the carriage, sleep seemed like a chore. Along the way, Li Zhi Ming found himself curiously observing the world outside the mountains. The scenery and customs here were vastly different from those in the mountains.

Even the dirty official robes worn by the magistrate of Dongxiang County seemed rustic in comparison. The carriage team passed through villages and did not enter the city, and along the way, more children were added to the group. Eventually, all three carriages were filled with children. Li Zhi Ming's carriage also welcomed some unfamiliar faces, making the atmosphere stiffen once again.

It wasn't until half a month later, when the ice began to melt, that a majestic green mountain appeared on the horizon. The road, though winding and rugged, eventually led to the foot of the mountain. Here, Li Zhi Ming noticed that many of the passersby were familiar faces among the martial artists.

Li Zhi Ming's eyes were wide with wonder as he gazed at the people by the roadside. In the plain, he had watched the people passing by, and now, he was watching those agile individuals who moved like tigers and leopards.

However, his curiosity was met with disappointment. All he saw were black and white attire, and even near the mountain, the desperate world he witnessed showed little change. The only difference was that there were more white-clad individuals.

As for the light blue attire, he saw not a single one. It seemed that the dull-witted young boy named Han Li was indeed a rare find.

The carriage arrived at the mountain gate, and the children were herded out like little pigs. They curiously looked around at the gate, while the passing youths moved swiftly. Some people nearby were practicing their martial arts, drawing the attention of the children.

"Song Zhi Shi, thank you for your trouble," Yang Jing Shan said, handing over the children. "Let them rest for a few days and wait for the others."

A man with a brown robe and a few strands of beard walked forward, his eyes scanning the children before fixing on them with a cold and sinister gaze.

"Arrange for them to stay, and have them assessed in seven days," he said.

The young disciples walked over, bowed, and coldly gazed at the children. "Follow us, and don't get lost."

The children began to feel uneasy, aimlessly following the group. Only a few children from wealthy families walked with pride. Li Zhi Ming's eyes locked onto Han Li, and he pulled Da Niu along.

As they climbed the mountain for half a day, they finally arrived at a bamboo forest. The wooden fence of the courtyard was pushed open, revealing several dozen empty houses.

"Stay here for now, and don't wander off. We'll come for you after a while," the tall and lanky disciple said before turning to leave.

As soon as he left, the remaining children scattered, competing for the houses. Li Zhi Ming quickly pulled Da Niu along, and they rushed into a four-person room.

"This is fine, right?" Li Zhi Ming asked, noticing the simple bedding on the bed. He threw Xiao Xu onto the bed and lay down on the other bed, exhausted from the journey.

Li Zhi Ming began to miss home and his father, his eyes welling up with tears.

"I'll sleep here," Da Niu said, his voice trembling with fear. He squeezed onto Li Zhi Ming's bed, forcing Li Zhi Ming to press himself against the cold mud wall.

Li Zhi Ming refrained from scolding him, instead choosing to rest.

Han Li eventually chose the innermost bed, curling up in the corner. Another unfamiliar child entered, exchanged greetings, and occupied the remaining bed. The room fell silent.

It wasn't until near dusk that everyone woke up, and a tall disciple arrived with a bucket of wild vegetable soup and eggs. Each child received a white steamed bun, which made Li Zhi Ming's eyes widen.

The pure white, fragrant buns were a luxury he had only seen when his father sent gifts to the village elder. Li Zhi Ming had never tasted one before.

The children cheered, especially the rural kids, who swarmed forward.

"Line up and take one bun each!" the tall disciple shouted.

Li Zhi Ming swallowed his saliva and rushed back to the room, slapping Da Niu awake. "Wake up, it's time for the buns!"

However, they were too late, and the buns were all gone. That's when Li Zhi Ming saw Han Li walking towards him with three buns.

"Here, I got these for you," Han Li said.

Li Zhi Ming gratefully accepted, sharing the buns with Da Niu. They also received a bowl of wild vegetable soup. As they sat under a large tree, eating, Li Zhi Ming, Han Li, and Da Niu savored the delicious food.

Their hunger sated, Li Zhi Ming glanced around and noticed another group of children, the ones from wealthy families, forming a circle.

Seven days passed, and another batch of children arrived. The tall disciple reappeared at the courtyard entrance.

"Everyone, come out!" His voice boomed, echoing through the rooms like a wake-up call.
