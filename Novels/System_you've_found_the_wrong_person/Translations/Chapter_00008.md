# Chapter 8: Old Senior, I Won't Kill You  

The journey from Jun County to Jianmen Pass would normally take only ten days. If one rode at full speed without rest, it could be even shorter. But that was clearly impossible—even if a person were made of iron, horses would still tire.  

With enemies lying in ambush, it was essential to maintain full stamina, which meant adequate rest was necessary.  

Dou Changsheng sat on the ground, watching the horse graze as he took a sip of cold water from his waterskin and bit into a coarse pancake. The texture was far from pleasant, filled with rough wheat bran that made every bite uncomfortable.  

Someone accustomed to fine grains would never tolerate such fare—even dogs wouldn’t eat it.  

But that was the perspective of his past life. After experiencing true hunger, he understood. When starving, one would do anything for a bite to eat.  

Back then, he had been picky, afraid of this and that. But in those early days after transmigrating, he would have gladly taken a pork knuckle and dared to stab the emperor twice if given the chance.  

He took another sip of water to wash it down, then untied another waterskin to water the horse.  

Transmigration truly changed a person. He had been a village boy, a stable hand, and now, a wandering swordsman.  

After the simple meal, he felt somewhat better, but exhaustion soon crept in.  

He had taken a longer detour, adding about five extra days to the journey, while Black Eagle Venerable and the others had chosen the main road—a ten-day trip.  

They had already wasted seven days in Jun County. Subtracting the fifteen days of travel, only eight days remained.  

Time was tight, especially since the journey was unlikely to be smooth.  

But Dou Changsheng wasn’t in a hurry. He didn’t actually need to reach Jianmen Pass.  

This trip was just a diversion.  

Once the horse had eaten its fill, he tied its reins to a tree and began searching for a place to rest.  

He deliberately kept his distance from the horse—its large size made it an easy target, likely to attract pursuers.  

Losing the horse was a minor concern compared to losing his life.  

He walked about three or four miles away. Even if enemies found the horse and assumed he was nearby, their careful search would ultimately be in vain.  

Dou Changsheng spotted a sturdy tree with thick roots. After some adjustments and a layer of wild grass for cover, it would perfectly conceal him.  

Lying down, sleep didn’t come easily.  

Too much had happened today—most notably, killing someone.  

Suddenly, he felt a pang of regret.  

He had forgotten to loot the corpse.  

---  

He was broke, with barely three taels of silver to his name. Even if Wang Xiong didn’t carry martial arts manuals, he must have had some money.  

Acting cool in the moment, suffering the consequences later.  

The wisdom of the old seniors truly held weight.  

As his thoughts wandered, Dou Changsheng suddenly heard the clanging of metal.  

His senses sharpened.  

The sound of weapons clashing—someone was fighting nearby.  

His heart pounded. He had taken such precautions precisely because he didn’t trust his luck. He had assumed staying with the horse would invite trouble, yet now, the horse was fine, and his carefully chosen hiding spot was the one compromised.  

*Please just be passersby,* he prayed silently.  

"You, Ai Haike, were once a renowned hero of the north. Who would have thought you’d kneel before the treacherous chancellor, becoming his lapdog?"  

"These military funds concern the survival of the north. How dare you steal them?"  

"There will be no place for you in this world!"  

An aged voice retorted, "What do you know?"  

"Since Yu Yun became the Northern Garrison General, he’s waged war every year, demanding money and men from us."  

"In over a decade, I’ve lost two of my three sons."  

"My family’s wealth is nearly exhausted."  

"I sacrificed everything to support his so-called glorious victories."  

"Now, the chancellor seeks peace. With just a yearly tribute, the barbarians won’t invade. Isn’t that better?"  

"But Yu Yun refuses."  

"He even petitions for war!"  

"Giving money to Yu Yun or the barbarians is the same."  

"Paying the barbarians means no more bloodshed. I won’t have to fear for my last son’s life, leaving my family line extinct."  

"Zhao Manren, you’re still young. You don’t understand the chancellor’s wisdom."  

"The north has suffered too long. The chancellor isn’t blindly advocating peace—he’s enduring humiliation to rebuild. Three years of recovery, three years of preparation, and our Great Jin will unite to cleanse this land, securing a century of peace."  

"Yu Yun is just a military thug. What does he know of governance? Only the chancellor can bring true peace and prosperity to the north."  

"Zhao Manren, hand over the funds. As your elder, I won’t make this difficult."  

Zhao Manren retorted urgently, "Old Senior, you’ve been deceived! The barbarian khan is young and ambitious, undefeated in battle, a once-in-a-millennium conqueror. Yet at the height of his power, he halted his advance, not invading but instead infiltrating our lands—bribing our warriors, supporting bandits."  

"After years of preparation, if Jianmen Pass falls, their hundreds of thousands of cavalry will sweep south. Who could stop them?"  

"Peace talks are a lie!"  

Ai Haike roared, "Nonsense!"  

"This year, the khan welcomed the Western Region’s Living Buddha, embracing Buddhism. His desire for peace is known to all!"  

"He even sent envoys to the capital, proposing an eternal brotherhood between our nations."  

"And how do you respond?"  

"You slander the chancellor!"  

"Because if peace is achieved, there will be no more war—no more glory, no more titles, no more wealth!"  

"Cutting off a man’s path to riches is like killing his parents!"  

Zhao Manren sighed. "Old Senior, you’ve been misled too deeply."  

"The chancellor rose to power by sending his daughter to the emperor’s harem. How could such a man care for the people?"  

"His push for peace is just a ploy—taking barbarian gold, recalling the general, weakening our defenses to pave their invasion."  

"Old Senior, you’ve lost your way."  

---  

Watching the two men fight while trading barbs, Dou Changsheng felt his scalp tingle and his stomach churn.  

His luck was truly cursed.  

The military funds for Jianmen Pass weren’t transported in a single shipment. Each route was supposed to be secret—yet he had stumbled upon two.  

As for the political debate, Dou Changsheng paid no mind. As a transmigrator, he had no patriotic fervor. His loyalty was purely pragmatic—Yu Yun’s faction paid his wages.  

Shifting slightly, he peered through the grass toward the source of the voices.  

Though the night was dark, the bright moonlight revealed Ai Haike—an elderly man with silver hair, wielding a broadsword with powerful, sweeping strikes.  

Zhao Manren, in his thirties, carried a bundle on his back and fought with a lighter, more agile swordplay.  

Dou Changsheng could tell at a glance that Zhao Manren was outmatched. His tattered clothes and numerous wounds spoke of exhaustion, while Ai Haike remained unharmed, his blade strikes fierce and unrelenting.  

*Help him? Or not?*  

The question flashed through his mind, but the answer came swiftly.  

*Wait and see.*  

No moral dilemma—just cold calculation. Both were innate-level martial artists, far beyond his skill.  

If the opportunity didn’t present itself, intervening would only make him a liability.  

No one liked deadweight teammates.  

Silently, Dou Changsheng drew his sword and waited.  

Like a viper in the grass, he bided his time, watching for the moment his prey faltered.  

Wang Xiong had fallen to this very tactic.  

Time passed. Zhao Manren’s true strength matched Ai Haike’s, but exhaustion and injuries had taken their toll. His breathing grew ragged, his movements sluggish.  

Ai Haike’s scarred face twisted with exertion, his lean frame belying his immense strength.  

Then—the opening came.  

A sweeping slash, moonlight glinting off the blade.  

Dou Changsheng struck.  

Innate qi surged through his sword, the tip glowing with a three-inch aura.  

Like a shooting star, it shot toward Ai Haike’s back—a lethal thrust.  

But at the last moment, Ai Haike abandoned his stance, twisting mid-air like a soaring bird.  

The blade passed harmlessly beneath him.  

Dou Changsheng blinked.  

His perfect ambush had failed.  

But the gambit had cost Ai Haike his weapon.  

Calmly, Dou Changsheng sheathed his sword and clasped his hands.  

"Old Senior, you’ve sacrificed two sons to war, your family’s wealth spent in service to the north. Your loyalty is beyond question."  

"I respect you too much to strike in earnest."  

"This was but a warning."  

"Please, leave now."  

If he didn’t feel awkward, the awkwardness would shift to his opponent.  

Ai Haike glared. "Meddlesome brat."  

"Men like you ruin the chancellor’s century-long plans."  

Zhao Manren stepped forward. "Enough talk. The old man is lost."  

"With your profound innate qi, if he stays, we’ll capture him."  

Ai Haike scoffed. "How quickly the dog barks when it gains a master’s backing."  

Then his eyes narrowed in recognition.  

"Word came today of a Wang clansman from Xiangzhou infiltrating our ranks. To think I’d meet you so soon."  

"Others might doubt your ‘warning strike,’ but from a Wang, I believe it."  

"Your fundamentals are flawless, but your qi circulation is crude, weakening the blow. Had you used your clan’s techniques, I’d be dead."  

"I owe you this mercy."  

"But hear me: Yu Yun is a warmonger. His campaigns have bled the north dry. The court can’t sustain it."  

"Peace is the only path to lasting stability."  

Without waiting for a reply, Ai Haike turned and left.  

Zhao Manren exhaled in relief, then eyed Dou Changsheng warily.  

Before he could speak, Dou Changsheng raised a hand.  

"Brother Zhao, no need for suspicion."  

"I’m also transporting funds to Jianmen Pass—under Black Eagle Venerable’s command."  

He took a deliberate step back.  

"We’ll go our separate ways. No need to travel together."  

"Don’t ask about me, and I won’t ask about you."  

"No need to waste energy guarding against each other. Stay safe—we’ll meet at Jianmen Pass."  

Sticking with Zhao Manren meant trouble.  

One group of pursuers was bad enough. Two would be a nightmare.  

Zhao Manren hesitated, then nodded.  

Watching Dou Changsheng leave, he murmured, "Such chivalry is rare indeed."
