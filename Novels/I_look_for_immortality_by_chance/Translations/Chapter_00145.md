# Chapter 145: Refining Demon Cores, an Unorthodox Method!

"Hmm?"

The same golden tome, opened a second time, revealed entirely different contents, leaving Gu Yuan utterly astonished.

Had he not been at the Foundation Establishment stage, with heightened senses and spiritual awareness, he might have doubted whether he had misread it earlier. Unable to resist, he extended his divine sense to inspect the golden tome once more. Yet, the pages shimmered with light, each character glowing steadily, showing no further changes. Only the six large characters—**"Six Ren Magical Core Golden Scripture"**—remained.

Gu Yuan suppressed his confusion for the moment and skimmed through the text.

*"Human innate talents are predetermined by heaven, difficult to alter."*  
*"Though some body seals exist in the world, they are all exclusive techniques of top-tier sects. For ordinary people to obtain them is virtually impossible!"*  
*"While innate aptitude cannot be changed, alternative paths exist to enhance cultivation."*  
*"Humans absorb spiritual energy through their meridians to refine mana, while demons devour the essence of the sun and moon through their inner cores. Though their cultivation methods differ, they are not incompatible. Combining both paths may lead to the Great Dao."*  
*"By refining the inner core of an extraordinary demonic beast with secret techniques and spiritual materials, one can forge a Ren Magical Core within the dantian. This core functions like a demonic inner core, capable of converting the essence of the sun and moon into mana, accelerating cultivation."*  
*"In battle, the core can also be used as a weapon, capable of shattering mountains and severing rivers."*  
*"One Ren Core doubles cultivation speed, two Ren Cores triple it..."*  
*"At the peak of six Ren Cores, one may form a True Core, even reaching the Golden Core stage!"*  

The opening passage of the golden tome did not directly explain the cultivation method but instead described its profound yet eerie nature, leaving Gu Yuan frowning.

"Refining a demon core into the body… Six Ren cultivation?" Gu Yuan murmured to himself.

This was a path he had never considered—using a demon core as a magical core. It was bizarre and seemed far removed from orthodox Daoist methods. Yet, as he read further with his divine sense, he found the explanation clear and free of bloodthirsty undertones. Instead, it emphasized the mystical process of absorbing celestial energies and refining them into one's cultivation.

But how does one obtain a demon core?

Not all demonic creatures possessed inner cores. Most relied on physical cultivation, devouring flesh and refining it through meditation. Only rare, extraordinary demons developed inner cores after breaking through to the Earth Demon stage, allowing them to absorb the essence of the sun and moon.

Wouldn’t obtaining such cores require slaughtering these unique demons? The golden tome omitted this bloody step, only cautioning:  
*"Only the cores of naturally gifted, pure and enlightened demons may be refined. Otherwise, the practitioner risks demonic corruption, leading to stagnation or regression in cultivation."*

### **An Unsettling Method**

"The technique is profound, yet its premise is unsettling..." Gu Yuan pondered, unable to immediately decide whether its benefits outweighed the risks.

"Enough, I’ll return for now." After a brief contemplation, he set aside his doubts, stored the golden tome, and thoroughly searched the underwater palace. Then, using the Azure Python spirit to guard the site, he left and returned to Skywolf Island.

### **Silent Waters**

On Skywolf Island, Ma Wu and the others remained immersed in their cultivation, unaware that Gu Yuan had already secured two great opportunities.

Meanwhile, the rest of the Southern Marsh Demon Realm, fearing an invasion from Qingfeng Dao Academy, had sealed their formations and retreated into isolation. The entire realm had fallen into an eerie silence—a perfect cover for Gu Yuan’s activities.

Upon his return, he didn’t idle. After a brief rest, he retrieved two storage pouches—left behind by the old tortoise and the snake-tailed youth.

Neither demon was particularly wealthy. Though each had possessed a unique opportunity—with the snake-tailed youth even holding the palace seal and mastering the **"Chain Dao Seal"**—they lacked even a single spiritual artifact. After a thorough search, Gu Yuan realized why.

These two Earth Demons were not native to the Southern Marsh. They had come specifically for the **"Spiritual Azure Water Palace."** In their battle against the Azure Python spirit to seize the palace, their artifacts were destroyed, and the old tortoise suffered severe injuries, damaging his foundation. Though the two had a pact preventing mutual slaughter, the tortoise still lost the contest for the palace seal, settling only for a damaged **"Azure Roaming Sky Seal."**

Having claimed the palace, the snake-tailed youth had no intention of leaving. The old tortoise, for reasons unknown, lingered as well—nurturing **"Azure Heart Fruits"** to recover his foundation while biding his time.

Their conflicting motives trapped them in the Southern Marsh, caught in the academy’s siege. Though they attempted to flee when the situation turned dire, it was too late—Gu Yuan had already seized their opportunities.

"It seems the golden tome’s content varies by race. What I saw was the **Six Ren Magical Core Golden Scripture**, while the snake demon likely saw the **Celestial Bone-Seizing Demon Manual**..."  

With the snake demon dead, any stolen bones had dissipated. Yet, traces of human cultivator energy lingered in its remains, suggesting it had already claimed victims. Gu Yuan wondered what the demonic manual contained but decided to investigate later—preferably by capturing another demon for interrogation.

For now, the golden tome’s origins remained mysterious, and he preferred to keep it hidden.

### **A Dilemma**

What troubled him most was whether he should practice the **Six Ren Magical Core Golden Scripture**. The method felt undeniably unorthodox, raising concerns about hidden dangers.

"But since it’s a fated opportunity, shouldn’t it be safe? Otherwise, how could it alter destiny?" Gu Yuan wavered. "Perhaps I should consult the Sword Fox Sage? Maybe even receive a few demon cores as gifts?"  

The Sword Fox Sage was famously generous. His treatment of his late disciple proved he wasn’t like the nominal Golden Core elders of the academy—once he took a disciple under his wing, they gained an immense backer.

However, the academy’s campaign was still ongoing, making it unwise to return abruptly. Worse, Gu Yuan didn’t even know whether the sage was at Jade Gourd Peak or aboard the Celestial Net Dharma Ship.

"Enough overthinking. Cultivation must proceed step by step..."  

Shaking his head, Gu Yuan set the matter aside and retrieved a dull, stone-like seal—the **"Azure Roaming Sky Seal."**  

Of all his recent gains, this damaged golden seal was the only one that could quickly enhance his combat prowess. The snake demon’s **"Chain Dao Seal"** required demonic blood to cultivate, making it unusable for him.  

But the **Azure Roaming Sky Seal**—though damaged—boasted formidable teleportation abilities. Had the old tortoise not been obsessed with the Azure Heart Fruits, and had Gu Yuan not possessed the **"Three Hearts Golden Seal"** to sharpen his perception and anticipate the tortoise’s moves, the demon might have escaped.  

**"Buzz—"**  

As Gu Yuan channeled his mana, the seal’s spiritual energy gradually awakened. The refinement process lasted three days.

### **Gathering Storm**

During those three days, the entire marsh remained eerily quiet. Yet deep in the northern reaches, within a luxurious underwater palace, three figures of immense power gathered, their expressions grave.  

"Fellow Daoists, Qingfeng Dao Academy presses us relentlessly. Our forces have suffered heavy casualties these past few days. What should we do?"
