# Chapter 33: Stealing the Egg

It was Huang Fei and Liu Hao!

Seeing these two, Qin Chong felt a sudden clarity—no wonder their auras had seemed vaguely familiar. The other two men were complete strangers, but judging by their attire, they were undoubtedly Qingxuan Sect cultivators.

Who would have thought these four would join forces here to battle a second-tier demonic beast?

Just days ago, Qin Chong had witnessed a life-and-death struggle between cultivators of rival sects. The current scene was truly astonishing.

Huang Fei seemed to cultivate a fire-attribute technique, effortlessly manipulating a crimson streak of light. Under his control, the sword struck from unpredictable angles, each attack aimed precisely at the Crimson-Eyed Silver Python's vital points.

Liu Hao wielded what appeared to be a top-grade magical artifact—a massive, heavy broadsword. Though slightly slower, each strike elicited a pained hiss from the python, indicating tremendous force behind the blows.

The two Qingxuan Sect cultivators each had their own methods. One summoned an ancient bronze bell that emitted strange, unsettling chimes. Even from dozens of feet away, the sound caused discomfort in Qin Chong's consciousness. The python clearly loathed the bell, directing half its counterattacks toward it.

The other Qingxuan cultivator controlled an emerald flying sword, also exuding the aura of a top-grade artifact. His strength seemed on par with Huang Fei's, making these two the main forces in the battle.

Among the group, only Liu Hao was at the eighth level of Qi Refining, while the other three had reached the ninth level. For Qi Refining cultivators, this was a formidable lineup.

Yet against a powerful second-tier demonic beast, their strength should have been insufficient. Surprisingly, they held a clear advantage.

The python's five-zhang-long body coiled around a stone platform, attacking with its head and tail while occasionally spewing venom and demonic flames. But outnumbered, its lethal strikes rarely found their mark.

Watching from the shadows, Qin Chong felt his nerves tighten. He even considered retreating and returning after the battle concluded.

Just then, the python seemed to enter a frenzy. After Liu Hao struck near its vitals, the beast reared up violently, venom and demonic flames erupting from its maw simultaneously.

At that moment, Qin Chong spotted something that banished all thoughts of leaving—a black egg, about a foot tall, standing upright on the stone platform. The python's coiled position was protecting it.

Everything became clear. The beast must have recently laid the egg and was still weakened while guarding it, allowing the four cultivators to gain the upper hand.

Even an ordinary demonic beast's egg could fetch a high price, let alone one from a second-tier Crimson-Eyed Silver Python—a creature whose entire body was practically treasure. For Qi Refining cultivators, this represented immense wealth.

No wonder the rivals had temporarily allied. They'd either agreed on dividing the spoils beforehand or planned to fight over them later—those were the only possibilities.

"Fellow Daoist Wang, you two restrain its head while Junior Brother Liu holds it off alone. I'll activate my talisman treasure to finish it," Huang Fei said urgently, recalling his flying sword.

"Proceed without worry, Fellow Daoist Huang. The beast is weakening—now is the perfect time," came the reply.

Qin Chong's heart skipped a beat. Huang Fei must have an extraordinary background to possess a talisman treasure—the pinnacle of defensive artifacts for Qi Refining cultivators. A high-quality talisman treasure activated swiftly could even intimidate Foundation Establishment experts.

As Huang Fei withdrew his artifact, he flung an object into the air, forming hand seals while channeling spiritual energy into the talisman. It gradually took shape—a ruler-like form Qin Chong didn't recognize.

Within moments, the talisman expanded to over a zhang long, its aura filling the cavern. Even outside, Qin Chong felt a chill of fear.

The python sensed imminent danger. Abandoning defense of its egg, it launched desperate counterattacks.

This was Qin Chong's chance.

He silently commanded his Spirit-Devouring Flying Ant Queen while retreating cautiously. He couldn't go far—remaining within the queen's control range, which exceeded even his own spiritual sense coverage by hundreds of zhang, likely surpassing even early Foundation Establishment cultivators' detection range.

His target was the egg.

In this chaos, stealing the python's egg seemed feasible. The tiny flying ants carried no demonic beast aura, and with the talisman's overwhelming presence, no one would notice them.

This was a heaven-sent opportunity worth the risk.

Qin Chong's only concern was timing—whether the ants could retrieve the egg before the talisman struck. But having made his decision, he could only trust his luck.

"Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!"

As gale-force winds howled through the cavern, Huang Fei's talisman reached its peak power, poised to strike.

The python reared up defiantly against the impending doom.

"BOOM!"

The two-zhang-long talisman came crashing down.

In that instant, a barely noticeable black streak darted away with the egg. All four cultivators had been watching the precious prize closely.

"No!" Huang Fei's roar was drowned by the talisman's impact.

"Who's there?!" bellowed a Qingxuan cultivator.

Too late. The shockwave from the strike sent them all crashing against the walls, preventing pursuit.

The python's fate was sealed—its head and two zhang of body flattened lifelessly.

As the energy settled, the four rushed to the corpse.

"Fellow Daoist Huang, who stole the egg?" demanded the Qingxuan cultivator.

"I don't know," Huang Fei replied grimly. "They concealed their aura, hid in shadows, and took it without revealing themselves."

"Damn it! After fighting for over an hour, someone just waltzes in and steals the most valuable prize? This is infuriating!"
