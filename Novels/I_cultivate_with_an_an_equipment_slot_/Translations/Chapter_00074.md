# Chapter 74: Lei Kunhai: This Boy Resembles Me

"Ding! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!"

Zhang Yan wielded a large hammer, continuously striking the spirit iron. It had to be said, working with spirit iron was far more exhausting than he had imagined. After just a short while of hammering, he felt completely drained. In contrast, Lei Kunhai, who was forging a magical artifact, remained vigorous and full of energy despite his age.

"I must cultivate my body," Zhang Yan gritted his teeth and persisted, swinging the hammer once more with all his remaining strength. This time, he completely exhausted his energy and slumped to the ground, panting heavily.

"Senior Brother Lei, what's wrong with you?" It was only then that Zhang Yan noticed Lei Wanbao's strange expression. Hadn't he been fine just a moment ago? Why did he now look so upset, as if he had just been betrayed?

"Me? I'm fine." Lei Wanbao forced a smile. "You're quite skilled at purifying impurities. Have you learned this before?"

"No, not at all. It's all thanks to Senior Lei's guidance," Zhang Yan quickly shook his head. He had never worked with metal before. His current proficiency was entirely due to the effects of the forging manual.

After resting for a while and regaining some strength, Zhang Yan wasted no time and got back to work.

This man is a prodigy in forging! He could definitely revitalize Qianbao Peak! Lei Wanbao screamed inwardly. He even wanted to make the decision for his ancestor and take Zhang Yan as a disciple.

Though reluctant to admit it, Lei Kunhai had to concede that Zhang Yan seemed genuinely talented. He carefully examined the spirit iron ingot inside and out, swallowing the words he had intended to use to discourage Zhang Yan.

"Cultivating spiritual plants?"

"As expected..."

"Not bad, but there are still impurities here. You need to keep working," Lei Kunhai said, calming his emotions as he looked at the ingot.

The gap was too vast—he could hardly accept it! Especially with the latest spirit iron ingot, which Zhang Yan had forged to near perfection, almost entirely free of impurities.

At first, Lei Wanbao had been smug, but as time passed, his expression grew increasingly grim. Now, he looked on the verge of tears.

However, I must inform Peak Master Lei that I have spiritual plant cultivation duties tomorrow and may not be able to come to Qianbao Peak. Zhang Yan, who had little understanding of forging, assumed that all magical artifacts required the complete removal of impurities.

"N-no, it's fine. Your ingots are excellent!" Hearing Zhang Yan's words, Lei Wanbao's heart sank further. So his ancestor had been teaching Zhang Yan outside after all!

"What do you mean, 'as expected'?" Zhang Yan found Lei Wanbao somewhat odd. Was there something wrong with this man's head?

"Keep hammering," Lei Kunhai tossed another spirit iron ingot to Zhang Yan, urging him to continue. His gaze at Zhang Yan was filled with a mix of admiration and resentment.

"Clang!" At that moment, Lei Kunhai set down his own hammer. He had finished forging the flower-shaped artifact, which now gleamed with spiritual light—it was a spiritual artifact.

Because Zhang Yan could produce the same.

This led to a situation where Lei Wanbao, despite having started learning earlier, still lagged behind in skill and needed further refinement.

"Senior Lei, how did I do?" Zhang Yan asked excitedly.

Lei Wanbao thought of himself—he had been learning forging since childhood, for forty-seven years now. Yet, during this time, he had stayed put, inexplicably picking up a hammer to forge alongside Zhang Yan.

What was truly terrifying was that Zhang Yan had gone from a complete novice to producing flawless spirit iron in just ten days!

Lei Kunhai pinched the spirit iron ingot, crushing it into a lump, then snapped it in half with his bare hands.

He was troubled and doubtful. Initially, he had joined in the forging to prove that Zhang Yan, though talented, still needed refinement. But in just a few days...

Removing impurities wasn't something that could be done casually—it required specific techniques and skills.

No, now there were two of them.

And ingots with almost no impurities? Only Lei Kunhai himself had been capable of producing such quality on Qianbao Peak.

Though purifying spirit iron was a basic forging skill, generally, ingots with minor impurities were considered acceptable.

Zhang Yan swung his hammer tirelessly, striking the spirit iron ingot for ten straight days! In that time, he had produced over a hundred ingots.

Though not yet perfect, it was clear that the impurities in the ingots had been significantly reduced.

Forty years of effort, yet surpassed in just ten days!

"This spirit iron ingot..."

"Hmm?"

"Kid, why did you stop? Giving up?" Lei Kunhai set down his hammer and turned to examine the ingot Zhang Yan had been working on.

"You've done... quite well," Lei Kunhai said, though his tone was indifferent. He then turned away, muttering, "Let's see how you fare in the future."

Seeing the ingot, Lei Kunhai paused, then channeled his spiritual energy to lift it into his hand.

What a waste of my life!

Hearing Zhang Yan's words, Lei Kunhai clenched the ingot in his hand, crushing it into a ball. "You have talent in forging. I suggest you focus on this path."

"I understand," Zhang Yan didn't argue. Forging held extraordinary significance for him. However, he couldn't neglect spiritual plant cultivation either. As a landowner, even if he didn't personally tend to the plants, he needed to understand the basics.

After Zhang Yan left, Lei Kunhai stared at the spirit iron ingot, a glint of admiration in his eyes.

"Ancestor, you just let him leave like that? Aren't you going to take him as a disciple?" Lei Wanbao approached, curious.

"He already has a master. My skills are the treasure of Qianbao Peak—they cannot be passed to outsiders. The ways of our ancestors are hard to change." Lei Kunhai's face twisted slightly with bitterness as he considered whether to poach Zhang Yan from Zhuge Wan.

"Besides, this is just purifying spirit iron. We don't know yet if he can actually forge magical artifacts. Let's observe him a bit longer." Lei Kunhai decided not to make a hasty decision. He would wait until Zhang Yan could independently forge at least a low-grade magical artifact.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan had returned to the spiritual plant garden. His cultivation efforts there hadn't been going smoothly. Since he wanted to use grafting techniques on spiritual fruit trees, he needed rootstocks—stumps with robust root systems, disease resistance, and cold resistance. Finding suitable rootstocks with genetic affinity for grafting wasn't easy.

After searching unsuccessfully in Muling Peak, Zhang Yan had sent Mu Sen to scout for suitable rootstocks. Mu Sen soon returned with news—there were suitable ones right in the sect's spiritual plant garden. Zhang Yan exchanged contribution points to purchase several dozen rootstocks and resumed his efforts to cultivate second-grade spiritual plants.

He also tended to the Clearheart Lotus. To ensure its survival, he applied perfected Wood Element Techniques and Spirit Rain Techniques each time he visited. Despite this, the lotus grew painfully slowly. But Zhang Yan remained undiscouraged—as long as it lived, he could nurture it. If it died, he still had a backup seed. Worst case, he could always "relocate" the one in the sect leader's garden.

After resolving some cultivation issues, Zhang Yan returned to Qianbao Peak—he still wanted to learn forging from Lei Kunhai.

The next day, Lei Kunhai paced restlessly in the forging cave, while Lei Wanbao sported fresh bruises on his face.

"You've been at this for so long after reaching Foundation Establishment, yet you're still worse than a novice! What have you been doing all these years?" Lei Kunhai roared.

"I didn't mean to..." Lei Wanbao looked utterly dejected. He couldn't help it—it was as if Zhang Yan was somehow his nemesis. Every time his ancestor saw Zhang Yan, he ended up beaten!

"Disciple Zhang Yan greets Peak Master Lei." Zhang Yan's voice came from outside.

"Come in!" Hearing Zhang Yan, Lei Kunhai's temper immediately cooled.

When Zhang Yan entered the cave's central plaza, Lei Kunhai was already seated at a table, sipping tea with an air of composure.

"A good forging hammer is essential for any blacksmith. Today, you'll forge one for yourself." Lei Kunhai didn't even look up as he spoke, his tone indifferent.

"As you command!" Recognizing this as a test, Zhang Yan nodded. He approached the forge, took a deep breath, and picked up two of the spirit iron ingots he had previously purified. After melting them in the earthfire, he grabbed a hammer and began striking relentlessly, sparks flying everywhere.

This was Zhang Yan's first attempt at forging a magical artifact, so his movements were somewhat clumsy. But Lei Kunhai had already looked up, his gaze fixed intently on Zhang Yan. Watching the familiar rhythm in Zhang Yan's strikes, Lei Kunhai murmured to himself, "This boy... resembles me!"
