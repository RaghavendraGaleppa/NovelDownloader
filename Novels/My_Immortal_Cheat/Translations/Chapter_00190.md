## Chapter 190: Metamorphosis!

There, the last golden rune chain burst open, and the World Origin completely broke free from its restraints, revealing the grand radiance of the Great Dao.

Boom!

At this moment, everyone felt it. The aura of the Great Dao washed over them, making them almost want to prostrate themselves in submission, unable to resist bowing down and worshipping.

This was the World Origin, which once bore the rise, fall, glory, and shame of a world. Although it eventually perished, this World Origin left behind too much information, too many mysteries, and unimaginable profound opportunities.

Now, it flowed with endless light, from which various creatures formed by order flew out. Dragon roars and tiger growls immediately echoed through the air; True Dragons and White Tigers were locked in fierce combat, roaring.

Subsequently, Vermilion Birds danced, Phoenixes soared with boundless fire, and Qilins threatened to rip apart the sky, while Golden-winged Great Pengs spread their wings to sever the starry heavens. These were all phenomena, manifestations of rules.

In addition, there were countless densely packed symbols, like a mysterious scripture, waiting for people to comprehend.

Before long, myriad spirits emerged, vibrating here, their pressure making people feel suffocated.

It was flowing with the primordial energy of the world, Great Dao fragments intertwining, manifesting the illusory forms of myriad spirits. The entire mass of matter was resplendent with light and color, accompanied by terrifying thunder, and the deafening sound of the Great Dao.

Such scenes and phenomena made everyone tremble. While resonating with it, they also felt a sense of dread and reverence. The World Origin, the very essence that sustained a world, was formidable even in its destruction, possessing an inexplicable pressure that made people involuntarily shiver.

"An immense, heaven-sent opportunity!"

Instantly, all the Heavenly Kings who were fighting the Saint Devil retreated, casting forbidden techniques to boost their speed and rushing towards the World Origin. They had originally come to prevent Zhou Tian's side from gaining an imbalance of power, intending to stop the Saint Devil. As long as they held out until the World Origin emerged, they would have a chance to fish in troubled waters. They planned to grab a bit and then leave; who could relentlessly pursue them then, with such a massive mass of energy just sitting there?

Zhou Tian and Yuan Chi also stopped, transforming into two streaks of light, rushing towards the World Origin at full speed.

"Brat, your death is imminent!"

Yuan Chi's eyes burned with fervor, fixed on the World Origin. The stone stele emitted an eerie dark light, runes swirled around it, and he smashed it fiercely towards Zhou Tian. Their Yuan Tomb clan was inherently the burial ground of all realms, and their race was particularly special, possessing their own method for utilizing the World Origin. One could say they stood proudly above all other forces in the Star Realm. Once they secured the World Origin, they were confident they could kill both Zhou Tian and the Saint Devil.

"It's not certain who will live and who will die!"

Zhou Tian's fists were wreathed in Yin and Yang energy, like two great dragons, smashing the stone stele away. He spoke with disdain, thinking, *anyone can talk big.* Although his skill duration was about to end, he believed the upgraded Undying System would not disappoint him.

"Hmph hmph..."

Yuan Chi sneered. He had strong confidence in himself, or more accurately, in his race.

"Saint Devil, help me stop him!" Zhou Tian said to the Saint Devil. He didn't know what the Undying System's upgrade would entail, but it was best to avoid any interference.

The Saint Devil nodded, joining two fingers, spewing forth chaotic sword energy, and fiercely slashing it towards Yuan Chi. The sword energy tore through the sky, like an uncrossable chasm.

Yuan Chi raised his stele to resist. Dazzling sparks surged, and runes flickered erratically. Although he blocked the sword energy, he was still obstructed for an instant.

"Get lost!" Yuan Chi roared. Seeing Zhou Tian about to approach the World Origin, he gritted his teeth. A finger on his right hand actually detached, emitting a mesmerizing light. "World Fire, rise!"

Boom!

Flames surged to the sky, incinerating space, and simultaneously blocking the Saint Devil. The Saint Devil's expression changed. He formed profound hand seals, and a Buddhist wheel appeared behind him, enveloped in Buddha's light, temporarily blocking the World Fire.

And Huang Qi's gaze flickered. For countless years, the Yuan Tomb clan had been almost the most mysterious race in the entire Star Realm, their origin unknown, their true form unknown. All that was known was that they possessed various strange and terrifying divine abilities. The World Fire was originally fueled by the destruction energy of worlds, yet Yuan Chi could wield it using his own flesh as fuel, which was truly incredibly miraculous.

Zhou Tian was getting closer to the World Origin, but he didn't feel any stirring within himself. The Undying System remained completely silent.

However, those Heavenly Kings reached it a step faster than Zhou Tian. As they swept past the World Origin, fist-sized chunks of seven-colored matter were snatched away, and then they all simultaneously changed direction and quickly fled. Although the World Origin had just forcibly broken free from the suppressing power of that Buddha palm, it actually had no destructive power. Instead, it was extremely malleable and could merge with any object.

Zhou Tian's heart ached from watching, unsure if the loss of these pieces would affect the World Origin. However, Yuan Chi was only one step behind him, so he didn't dare to chase those Heavenly Kings. His sole target was the World Origin.

Finally, his palm also plunged into the mass of seven-colored matter. It was a strange sensation; his palm felt as if it didn't belong to him. Mysterious information appeared in his mind, but he couldn't comprehend it, like a fleeting glimpse of passing scenes.

Then, Zhou Tian's entire body began to glow, as if enveloped by a brilliant great sun. The World Origin surged into his body like a tide. Somewhere within him, it was as if a Taotie had awakened, like a bottomless pit, devouring the World Origin.

Yuan Chi, who was only a step behind Zhou Tian, arrived. Just as he approached the World Origin and before he could make any move, he felt a chill run through his body, as if he had been targeted by some extremely ominous entity. A golden light shot out from Zhou Tian's body, piercing directly through Yuan Chi's left shoulder and sending him flying several li away.

Yuan Chi's face was grim. He clutched his left shoulder, blood gushing out uncontrollably. It was a strange energy that even with his formidable racial physique, he could not dispel. If he hadn't reacted quickly, that golden light would have pierced his heart. Looking at Zhou Tian, who was absorbing the World Origin, he felt a bit bewildered.

Directly absorbing the World Origin with one's physical body was not unprecedented, but without exception, all such attempts had failed. While there was no immediate danger of death, the human body was like a sieve, fundamentally unable to contain it. The World Origin would leak out; it could only be absorbed by converting and filtering out some of its components through special methods. This was because the World Origin contained not only creation energy but also remnants of world information and rules, which an individual could not bear.

But he was unwilling to give up and pressed closer. However, moments later, he was sent flying back again, smashing a mountain and spitting out mouthfuls of blood. Another large hole appeared on his right shoulder.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian was completely unaware of the outside world. He only felt warm all over, bathed in countless rays of shimmering light, flowing ceaselessly and wonderfully comforting. His body was like a vortex, continuously absorbing the World Origin, which made his body glow. This experience was too marvelous. This was pure, high-level energy, along with astonishing runic profound mysteries, all being absorbed into his body.
