# Chapter 20: If Dou Changsheng Comes, He Dies  

Chen Family Fort.  

Once an obscure place, like countless other villages and towns named after families—Li Family Village, Wang Family Town—such names were commonplace across the land.  

But now, Chen Family Fort had become the focus of attention for countless people in the northern region. Even the slightest disturbance here would be known by the great figures watching closely.  

The reason? This was the chosen residence of Fire Cloud True Master, a guest of the Grand Chancellor of the Great Jin Dynasty.  

Fire Cloud True Master, a grandmaster ranked on the Earth List, had come to the northern region to oversee all affairs. The Western Qin, Eastern Qi, Southern Chen, and even the Hu tribes—all were watching his every move.  

Clad in a thin robe and draped in a heavy coat, Fire Cloud True Master sat cross-legged on a stone platform, holding a large porcelain bowl the size of two palms. With chopsticks in hand, he ate a bowl of fried noodles while his gaze followed the street ahead, settling on a lone figure standing outside Chen Family Fort.  

The man stood like a spear, his spine straight as a dragon, eyes closed, motionless as a statue.  

This "door god" had appeared the moment Fire Cloud True Master arrived at Chen Family Fort.  

General Yu Yun had nine sons, and this was the eighth—known as the Northern Spear King.  

But this man did not bear the Yu surname. His name was Wang, and his given name was as plain as they came: Iron Spear.  

Fire Cloud True Master naturally had his information. Wang Tiespear's parents had died at the hands of the Hu tribes when he was young. Raised by his clan, he trained relentlessly in spear techniques before joining the military as an adult. Step by step, he rose through the ranks, his martial prowess growing ever stronger.  

His true breakthrough came when he caught the eye of Yu Yun, who adopted him as a foster son.  

From then on, his rise was unstoppable. With the backing of the military command, he repeatedly broke through bottlenecks, earning the title of Northern Spear King.  

Fire Cloud True Master snorted coldly as he observed the unyielding, fiercely loyal Wang Tiespear.  

The military command had sent this man to Chen Family Fort with one clear purpose: to ensure Fire Cloud True Master never left, forcing him to direct affairs from afar rather than taking to the battlefield himself.  

A military general who served not the court but the Yu family's private army—a disgrace without loyalty to emperor or father.  

The Grand Chancellor, far-sighted and devoted to the nation, understood that if Yu Yun remained in control of the north, the region would soon bear the Yu name.  

Taking another bite of noodles, Fire Cloud True Master turned his gaze to a one-armed martial artist approaching him. His expression darkened.  

"Dragonfly, you failed in your mission, yet you dare come to Chen Family Fort to see me?"  

"A few fires scared you so much you fled without a fight?"  

"Do you have no shame before me—before the Grand Chancellor?"  

Dragonfly hurriedly explained, "It wasn't incompetence, Master. Dou Changsheng is simply too strong."

**Chapter 20: If Dou Changsheng Comes, He Dies**  

"Since leaving Jun County, Dou Changsheng has slain Wang Xiong with a single swordstroke, broken through a hundred cavalrymen head-on, killed Earthwalker, repelled Windwing, and stormed Sword Pass—his momentum unstoppable."  

"That very night, without resting, he immediately left Sword Pass to rescue Black Eagle Venerable and Zhao Manren."  

"Such loyalty and righteousness are rare in this world."  

Fire Cloud True Master sneered. "And now you admire him?"  

"Have you forgotten what you are?"  

"Outlaws like you would never have a chance at redemption if not for the Grand Chancellor's lack of manpower."  

"Now you want to play the hero? Should I let you take the military payroll and deliver it to Sword Pass?"  

"Tell me—what matters more? Martial arts manuals, high office, riches, and beauties? Or being a 'good man'?"  

"How much is a 'good man' worth?"  

Suddenly, Fire Cloud True Master's expression darkened. He stood abruptly, tossing his bowl aside. Noodles scattered across the ground as he demanded coldly,  

"Given the time, you've already escaped back here alive."  

"So why hasn't the payroll arrived yet?"  

Dragonfly wiped sweat from his brow, relieved at the sudden change of topic. He seized the opportunity to explain, "The payroll taken from Zhao Manren was sent to Chen Family Fort immediately."  

"By distance, they should have arrived before me."  

"It seems the military command interfered, delaying them along the way."  

"I am willing to atone for my failure by leading reinforcements immediately."  

Fire Cloud True Master waved a hand. "Go. Take men and leave at once."  

His gaze turned icy as he stared at Wang Tiespear in the distance. The military command had played dirty—they must have deployed a Pure Yin grandmaster to create confusion. Otherwise, the delay made no sense.  

Both sides were restraining each other. Direct action was impossible, but small maneuvers were fair game.  

There was no point complaining. Fire Cloud True Master himself had been pulling strings behind the scenes, ensuring the payroll convoy would never make it unscathed. Now, the military command was simply returning the favor.  

As Fire Cloud True Master took a step forward, a hand suddenly clamped onto his shoulder.  

The smiling face of Wang Tianhe appeared inches from his own, so close their noses nearly touched.  

Wang Tianhe chuckled. "Well, if it isn't Little Yun!"  

"Just arrived in the north and already running into an old friend."  

"What a delightful coincidence."  

Fire Cloud True Master stepped back warily. "The Wang clan made an agreement with the Grand Chancellor to stay out of northern affairs."  

"Why are you here?"  

"Does no one enforce the rules anymore?"  

Wang Tianhe cheerfully tugged at Fire Cloud True Master's sleeve. "That's precisely why I'm here!"  

"My Wang clan of Xiangzhou is a noble lineage spanning a thousand years. Countless upstarts try to claim ties to us."  

"Every year, impostors appear—it's exhausting."  

"But this time is different. Someone is using the *Threefold Qi Reversion Art* to make a name for himself, deliberately meddling in northern affairs. His intentions are malicious, a deliberate scheme."  

"He seeks to break the agreement between me and the Grand Chancellor, forcing the Wang clan to violate our word—so the Grand Chancellor can retaliate and ruin our reputation."  

"With the thousand-year honor of the Xiangzhou Wang clan at stake, how could I not act? I came personally to uncover Dou Changsheng's true origins."  

"Once I confirm his background, I'll drag him back to Xiangzhou for punishment."  

"Locked in the dungeon, he'll suffer daily torment—a lesson for anyone daring to impersonate a Wang."  

"Every move I make is justified. Would the Grand Chancellor or His Majesty dare oppose me?"  

"Ah, on my way here, I had an epiphany during cultivation. Accidentally, I released a bit of my aura, disrupting the earth's energy and trapping some commoners in place."  

"Though I tried to correct it immediately, the damage was done. I meant to compensate them with silver, but alas—in my haste to serve the Grand Chancellor, I forgot to bring money."  

"Little Yun, you're quite wealthy. Lend me some for now?"  

Fire Cloud True Master replied coldly, "Dragonfly has already gone to reinforce the convoy. The military command has no True Realm experts nearby—no one can stop him."  

"Your efforts are wasted."  

"And if Dou Changsheng dares come here?"  

"You won't need to capture him."  

"He will die."
