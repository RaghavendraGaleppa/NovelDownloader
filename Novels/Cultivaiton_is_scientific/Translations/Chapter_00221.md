# Chapter 221: The Relic  

"Venerable Jueyuan has returned to the embrace of the Buddha!" As Jueyuan's forehead was pierced by a sword, an elderly monk on a mountain peak in the righteous faction's territory took out a shattered Buddhist plaque from his robe and said calmly.  

"Senior Brother Zhikong, Jueyuan had inherited the 'Lotus Steps' of the Divine Foot Technique. How could he have been killed in the first battle?" Monk Zhiming's eyes flickered with sorrow. His mental cultivation was far inferior to Zhikong's, and he was deeply grieved by Jueyuan's death.  

Among the many venerables nurtured by the Thousand Leaves Temple, Jueyuan was one of the most promising seeds. Especially since he had come into contact with the Divine Foot Technique during the Foundation Establishment stage—even if it was only the foundational inheritance—it indicated a high likelihood of him becoming a Venerable Master in the future.  

In the cultivation world, a Venerable Master was equivalent to a Nascent Soul Ancestor. Only the most powerful among Nascent Soul Ancestors could touch the realm of divine abilities. Yet, Jueyuan had gained recognition for the Divine Foot Technique inheritance during the mid-Foundation Establishment stage. His death was a significant loss for the Thousand Leaves Temple.  

"Let us wait a little longer. Did we not anticipate sacrifices in the early stages? Jueyuan died for the Thousand Leaves Temple—his death will not be without meaning!" Zhikong waved his hand dismissively.  

Zhiming couldn't help but glance behind him, where a formation pulsed with a chilling, murderous aura, as if it contained a god of slaughter.  

This was the Thousand Leaves Temple's most closely guarded secret—a venerable who had comprehended the path of "Slaughter to Become Buddha," a half-step Golden Core venerable.  

Venerable Juetu had never been seen in public. It wasn't that he hadn't ventured outside, but rather, every cultivator who had witnessed him in action had perished.  

He had grown through slaughter. The Thousand Leaves Temple's intelligence network gathered information on the most heinous factions for him to "liberate," eliminating evil while simultaneously strengthening himself through killing.  

The number of lives Juetu had taken to reach the half-step Golden Core stage through his path of slaughter was beyond even the Thousand Leaves Temple's reckoning.  

Over the past century, most of the most wicked factions targeted by the Thousand Leaves Temple had been eradicated by Juetu.  

"Slaughter to Become Buddha" was an exceedingly rare and dangerous path for a Buddhist cultivator. The demonic thoughts induced by excessive killing were particularly prone to afflict Buddhist practitioners.  

Every time Juetu returned to the Thousand Leaves Temple, a group of over ten senior monks specializing in Buddhist doctrine had to chant scriptures continuously to suppress the murderous intent in his heart.  

In truth, the so-called "heinous factions" were merely excuses fabricated by the Thousand Leaves Temple—justifications to ease Juetu's conscience. Once Juetu took action, all life within a certain radius would be extinguished.  

At this stage, Juetu was invincible among Foundation Establishment cultivators. Moreover, due to the nature of his path, his efficiency in slaughter was unparalleled.  

This battle against the Netherworld Sect was deliberately initiated by the Thousand Leaves Temple to exploit Juetu's abilities—to annihilate the Netherworld Sect's elite Foundation Establishment cultivators and, by killing nearly a thousand of them, complete the final step for Juetu to ascend to the Arhat stage.  

"Slaughter to Become Buddha" was an incredibly difficult path. Controlling the murderous intent was one challenge, but preventing the practitioner from losing themselves in the slaughter was another. They could not kill indiscriminately—they had to believe every life they took was justified, lest they lose themselves.  

This kind of slaughter had to persist for a century, claiming tens of thousands of lives, most of whom had to be sufficiently powerful cultivators. Even with the complete inheritance of "Slaughter to Become Buddha," the Thousand Leaves Temple could not sustain such cultivation indefinitely.  

Over the past four to five hundred years, Juetu was the only disciple capable of walking this path, a testament to its difficulty.  

"The Divine Foot Technique inheritance must be recovered," Zhiming reminded gravely.  

"Do not worry. The demonic cultivator who obtained the relic containing the Divine Foot Technique has not left. I can sense the relic's presence—Juetu will retrieve it when the time comes. Besides, the Divine Foot Technique is not something just anyone can comprehend. Any demonic cultivator who dares to pry into it is seeking their own death," Zhikong said calmly, his gaze fixed on the battlefield.  

On the battlefield, Jueyuan was undeniably dead. Li Yuanba's spiritual sense swept over the corpse, finding nothing but a storage bracelet.  

Li Yuanba stored the body away. The contribution points for killing Jueyuan—a true disciple—would surely be substantial.  

He then retrieved the bronze bell. Without an owner, the bell was now his to inspect. He discovered that it likely contained traces of third-grade materials, elevating its quality to the pinnacle of magical artifacts.  

The inclusion of third-grade materials allowed for additional enchantments, granting the artifact multiple functions—offensive, defensive, and even sonic wave attacks.  

Using only second-grade materials, it would have been impossible to support so many enchantments.  

"Better give this to my main body," he thought, transmitting the bell's details to Li Shiming through their shared consciousness.  

This bronze bell was likely the most powerful magical artifact in the Foundation Establishment stage. Only Li Shiming, who cultivated the "Sword Demon Secret Code," or Li Yuanba's third-grade sword foundation could surpass it.  

But the "Sword Demon Secret Code" was preparation for the Golden Core stage—a far cry from a magical artifact merely mixed with third-grade materials.  

Using third-grade materials in a Foundation Establishment artifact was practically wasteful. No Golden Core cultivator would condone such extravagance—they barely had enough for themselves.  

Even if a Golden Core cultivator had spare third-grade materials, they would trade them for resources more suited to their needs.  

Li Yuanba returned to the formation he had set up earlier. The thirty-six formation flags were still in place. Sitting cross-legged, he began inspecting the storage bracelet.  

The bracelet's contents were meager—some high-grade second-grade pills, around three thousand spirit stones, and little else. The poverty of the items shocked him—this was supposed to be a true disciple's storage!  

The only item of note was a relic shaped like a jade infant's foot.  

Taking it out, he sensed that this relic was at least at the Nascent Soul (Venerable Master) level. The vast Buddhist aura within was unmistakable.  

Overcome by curiosity, he extended his spiritual sense into the relic.  

With a *boom*, his consciousness was sucked into the relic, leaving his body sitting motionless, as if lifeless.  

Li Yuanba found himself in an endless void, devoid of sky or earth, filled only with countless Buddhas—serene, compassionate, and chanting scriptures in unison.  

He didn't recognize the scripture, but he felt himself gradually succumbing to its influence, sinking deeper into the sea of Buddhist chants.  

He had no means of resistance. His consciousness was pitifully weak in this realm.  

A sliver of clarity warned him—if he continued like this, his consciousness would dissolve into this world, becoming its nourishment.  

This was the trial of the jade foot relic. Even in the Thousand Leaves Temple, undergoing this trial required the protection of dozens of senior monks, lifelong study of Buddhist doctrine, and specialized cultivation techniques—all to pass the trial and receive the inheritance.  

Yet, even then, few venerables in the Thousand Leaves Temple ever succeeded in inheriting the Divine Foot Technique.  

This was common among major sects. Many possessed unique inheritances—some left behind by predecessors, others brought back by sect members.  

These inheritances required specific conditions to receive, ensuring that unqualified cultivators either failed to cultivate them, suffered mental damage, or died from backlash.  

The Divine Foot Technique within the jade foot relic was of an exceptionally high level. Jueyuan had spent over a century preparing before gaining the relic's recognition and receiving a portion of the inheritance.  

After obtaining the inheritance, Jueyuan became the relic's custodian. Only upon his death or when he could no longer glean further insights would the relic be returned to the temple to seek a new inheritor.  

Carrying such relics was a necessity—having them nearby accelerated cultivation of the inherited techniques.  

This was a common practice in Buddhism. Senior monks who could condense relics often imbued them with their most prized techniques for future generations.  

This was one of the main reasons Buddhism boasted so many powerful figures.  

Just as Li Yuanba was on the verge of succumbing, Li Shiming—aboard a flying boat—sensed his plight through their shared consciousness and sent a warning.  

Their connection transcended space and time. Even though Li Yuanba's consciousness was trapped, he could still receive Li Shiming's message.  

The warning jolted Li Yuanba back to clarity. He tried to withdraw from the relic, but escape was not so simple. The surrounding Buddhas noticed his resistance, and their chanting grew louder.  

Li Shiming connected to IBMz15 and transmitted "The Soul-Reaping Buddhist Chant" to Li Yuanba's consciousness.  

Outside, the Buddhist chants were filled with temptation, lulling him into submission. But within his mind, a seemingly righteous yet eerily discordant chant clashed against them.  

Using Buddhism against Buddhism—this was the only solution Li Shiming could devise.  

Though "The Soul-Reaping Buddhist Chant" was a mundane tune, its psychological impact was profound. Its ambiguous nature—both righteous and sinister—countered the overwhelming purity of the external chants.  

Li Yuanba felt the influence of the external chants weaken. He had no idea how long this would last, so he maintained this precarious balance.  

His situation was still perilous. His body was defenseless on the battlefield, vulnerable to any passing cultivator.  

Fortunately, his formation was still active, and his body's faint aura—coupled with his absent consciousness—kept him unnoticed by the many demonic cultivators and venerables passing by.  

Time crawled. Li Shiming grew increasingly anxious. He was too far from the battlefield to intervene directly, and breaching the righteous faction's defenses would be troublesome.  

All he could do was repeat "The Soul-Reaping Buddhist Chant," hoping its sinister tones would continue to shield Li Yuanba.  

This chant, emanating from the soul, mimicked the effects of Buddhist study, creating an artificial Buddhist aura—a method Li Shiming had tested when learning the "Diamond Body Protection Divine Art."  

One hour passed, then two, then three. Before dawn, Li Shiming found a mountaintop, set up a formation, and arranged fifteen hundred Fresnel reflectors to cultivate "Purple Qi from the East."  

Only in the direst circumstances would he interrupt this practice.  

A single missed session would drastically reduce its efficacy. His physical and mental enhancements were the result of relentless daily accumulation. If he stopped, he didn't know how long it would take to regain his current progress.  

Thankfully, "Purple Qi from the East" required no spiritual energy—just a secluded mountaintop, abundant in the cultivation world.  

By the time he finished, Li Yuanba remained trapped in the relic.  

Li Shiming packed up and continued toward the battlefield.  

Six hours had passed. Li Yuanba had grown numb to the external chants, his consciousness sustained by the relentless "Soul-Reaping Buddhist Chant" in his mind.  

He didn't realize how extraordinary it was to have music playing directly in his soul. This wasn't his doing, nor Li Shiming's—it was IBMz15's.  

Due to its unique nature, IBMz15 treated Li Shiming as an external device, with Li Yuanba connected via a metaphysical link.  

IBMz15's playback was unaffected by external factors, directly influencing the soul—a connection unparalleled in the cultivation world.  

Had Li Shiming tried to transmit the chant through ordinary spiritual means, it would have been far less effective.  

Moreover, "The Soul-Reaping Buddhist Chant" was uniquely suited—a tune that cloaked sinister intent in righteous tones.  

Just as Li Yuanba wondered how this would end, the external chants ceased, and the Buddhas vanished.  

A flood of information poured from the relic into his soul. Simultaneously, Li Shiming received it through their connection and stored it in IBMz15.  

"The Divine Foot Technique... What kind of technique is this?" Li Shiming and Li Yuanba murmured in unison, miles apart.  

They had received the complete inheritance of the Divine Foot Technique—unlike Jueyuan, who had only obtained the "Lotus Steps."  

Li Yuanba had cheated his way through the relic's trial.  

Jueyuan had lasted only an hour, earning a partial inheritance and the relic's recognition. Given time, he might have received the rest.  

But Jueyuan would never get that chance. His corpse lay in Li Yuanba's storage space.
