# Chapter 137: Master, Take Me With You

On the ground.

Countless gazes filled with curiosity and reverence turned toward the distant figure enveloped in bronze divine light, whose face remained indistinct.

Yet.

The moment their eyes made contact—

Including the Academy Head and the five Pavilion Masters—

Every single person's eyes flashed with instant terror.

In their perception,

The True Immortal before them had transformed into a terrifying bronze realm spanning tens of thousands of miles.

The sky, earth, mountains, rivers, and even the countless lives within—all seemed forged from some mysterious bronze, radiating immeasurable divine bronze light.

Majestic and boundless!

"So this is an Upper Realm True Immortal!"

Their hearts trembled before they swiftly averted their gazes, all eyes converging on Zhang Jing instead.

The thought that such a terrifying Upper Realm True Immortal had come specifically to receive him made envy rise unbidden in their hearts.

How highly the Upper Realm must value him!

Before long.

On Zhang Jing's immortal island.

Within the jade-green pavilion's reception hall.

Zhang Jing sat facing Feng Wuyu, whose body was wreathed in bronze divine light.

At this moment.

The terrifying aura that had surrounded the other party had completely withdrawn inward, like a bottomless black hole.

When he first arrived at the academy,

Feng Wuyu had unhesitatingly declined the Academy Head's invitation to a welcoming banquet, coming directly to Zhang Jing's residence instead.

Of course,

This reaction was something the Academy Head had anticipated.

Even knowing the invitation would be refused, proper preparations and courtesies had to be extended.

After all, they were dealing with an Upper Realm True Immortal.

For minor cultivators of the Lower Realm like themselves, no amount of caution was excessive.

Across from him.

A profound gaze penetrated the dense bronze radiance to rest gently on Zhang Jing's youthful face.

Then a gentle voice broke the silence of the room.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, is there anything left unresolved here?"

"If there is, this senior brother can wait a while. If not, we should depart for the Upper Realm promptly."

Hearing this,

Zhang Jing raised his head to look at Feng Wuyu.

Thanks to his comprehension of the Taishi Dao Intent, he could clearly sense that this person also cultivated the Taishi Origin World legacy.

With a smile, he replied:

"Reporting to Senior Brother, this junior has already settled all matters."

Then after a pause,

He cautiously added:

"Though there is one thing this junior doesn't understand—might Senior Brother Feng enlighten me?"

"Ask freely."

"Might this junior inquire—after entering the Upper Realm, will there be opportunity to return? Or what conditions would be required for such return?"

As his words fell,

A light laugh echoed through the chamber.

"Haha, junior brother, do you know why this senior brother still maintains this divine radiance around his body?"

Feng Wuyu asked.

What connection did this have with returning?

Doubt arose in Zhang Jing's heart, but he remained silent, simply shaking his head to indicate his ignorance.

After a moment's thought,

Feng Wuyu explained softly:

"When you established your Taishi Dao Foundation, you must have sensed it—the Dao principles of the Lower Realm are incomplete. All beings here, including yourselves, embody fragmented Dao principles."

"Thus after ascending to the Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven, your first task will be entering the Molting Immortal Pool to complete your Dao principles. Otherwise, you could only achieve a flawed Golden Core, forever trapped at that realm."

"And once your Dao principles are complete, returning to the Lower Realm would cause this world to drain those perfected principles from you. At best, you'd lose all cultivation and linger on in weakness; at worst, immediate death!"

"Only those at the Unity Realm can somewhat resist this world's demands."

"So the radiance around Senior Brother is..."

"Exactly as you suspect," Feng Wuyu nodded.

Zhang Jing's throat felt dry.

So the Dao of this world was incomplete.

"No wonder..."

Previously he'd wondered—

Why in such a vast land with such abundant cultivation resources, the pinnacle beings like Academy Heads only reached Golden Core realm.

Not that he looked down on Golden Core,

But that among so many Academy Heads, not one had broken through to realms beyond.

It had seemed inconceivable.

Now it was clear—

This anomaly was directly related to the world's incomplete Dao principles.

Coming back to the present,

"Might this junior ask—how long does it typically take to cultivate from Foundation Establishment to Unity Realm?"

Zhang Jing's voice held a thread of hope.

"That varies by individual—as short as several centuries, as long as ten millennia possible."

Feng Wuyu answered without hesitation.

Hearing this,

A shadow passed through Zhang Jing's eyes.

Several centuries...

What meaning would returning hold after so long?

Then suddenly—

"However," Feng Wuyu's tone shifted abruptly, carrying a hint of amusement, "while your true self cannot descend, a projection can. It merely requires... a modest price."

Zhang Jing exhaled in relief.

"Many thanks for Senior Brother's guidance."

As for what a "projection" entailed—while curious, Zhang Jing refrained from asking.

Such things would become clear after ascending—no need to trouble his senior brother now.

Wait...

Only now did Zhang Jing realize—

Senior Brother Feng Wuyu had been teasing him all along!

A wry smile touched his lips.

"Very well, junior brother. With no unfinished business here, let us depart for Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven."

"As you command, Senior Brother!"

Shortly after,

Zhang Jing and Feng Wuyu emerged from the jade pavilion.

Immediately,

The long-waiting Deer Thirty-Eight threw himself before Zhang Jing with a thud, wailing:

"Wuuu—Master, they say you're leaving?"

"Without you, what will become of me? I don't want to serve some Academy Head—I only wish to attend you, to tend your spirit herbs!"

"Master, won't you take me with you?"

This—

Zhang Jing's face showed hesitation.

Unexpectedly,

"Hmm? This white deer's bloodline seems unusual."

Feng Wuyu remarked curiously.

A penetrating gaze pierced through the bronze radiance to scrutinize Deer Thirty-Eight,

Seeing past flesh directly into the depths of his bloodline.

"Junior Brother Zhang, has this mount of yours always produced only single offspring per generation? An unbroken lineage?"

Feng Wuyu's voice held scholarly interest.

Facing him,

Deer Thirty-Eight turned his head in surprise:

"Eh? How'd you know our deer family's had thirty-eight generations of only children?"
