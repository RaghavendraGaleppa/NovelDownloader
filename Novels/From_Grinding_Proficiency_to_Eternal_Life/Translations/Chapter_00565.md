# Chapter 565: You Shall Be the Vanguard

“The burden of the chief commander is heavy on this journey to the Heavenly Realm. Have you inquired about the world beyond its boundaries?”

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred. He knew the serious discussion was beginning. Lu Chuan had stayed behind, intending to reveal the inside story to him. He immediately straightened his posture.

“I was just about to ask. Senior Brother mentioned in front of the Sect Master that the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect is eyeing us covetously. Junior Brother understands the risks but is unaware of the origins of this Heavenly Realm or the secrets of the world beyond. I would like to hear the details.”

Lu Chuan set down his teacup and began to speak leisurely.

“In the sect’s records, this realm is designated as the ‘Spirit Ruin Realm,’ but we usually call it the Heavenly Realm. As for its origins, it is not a newly emerged world. As early as sixty years ago, our sect’s patrolling forces in the void detected fluctuations from this realm.

“Back then, this realm had only recently intersected with our Great Ruin Realm of Taihua. The boundary membranes had just dissolved, and it had obtained our coordinates. Surprisingly, the other side sent many scouts to probe us, mostly minor fish at the Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment stages.”

He snorted coldly, a look of disdain appearing in his eyes.

“With the profound heritage of our Primordial Origin Sect, how could those people escape? We captured them all, performed soul searches and soul refinement. Within a few months, we extracted the coordinates of their realm and the nature of their Heavenly Dao. True Lord Pudu observed for many years until he had a thorough understanding. Only then did he issue the order to attack on a recent date. We have spent sixty years laying out this layout; how can we allow others to meddle?”

At this point, Lu Chuan suddenly sighed, a hint of regret flashing between his brows.

“Unfortunately! The ways of the world are unpredictable. Thirty years ago, for some unknown reason, the secret leaked. The sword cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect somehow caught wind of it. Those sword cultivators are as extreme and frenzied as rabid dogs. They came rushing at the scent, and since then, they have been like maggots in a bone, impossible to shake off. We can no longer enjoy the spoils alone. Now, the sect can only swallow its pride and accept the situation, advancing the schedule of the attack. If this blows up... Hmph, it’s possible that the bald donkeys of the Bodhisattva Pure Land will stick their noses in as well. A three-way melee would be the real trouble.”

If a great war between the three sects were to erupt, it would no longer be a matter of dead Qi Condensation disciples. It would be common for Foundation Establishment cultivators to perish, and even Golden Core True Lords might fall.

Xu Yunfan’s heart chilled. The implication in Lu Chuan’s words was exactly what he had been worried about.

On this trip to the Heavenly Realm, he would not only face the local Heavenly Emperor but also the sword cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect as his greatest opponents. Although his Array Dao was strong, he still had to plan carefully when facing sword cultivators, who are renowned as the number one killing force in the Immortal Path.

“Senior Brother’s words are reasonable,” Xu Yunfan said solemnly. “If the Pure Land gets involved, that would be truly dangerous. May I ask what the specific situation in this Heavenly Realm is? Is there really a local True Lord holding down the fort?”

Lu Chuan waved his hand with a smile, his expression relaxing. “There’s no need to worry too much! One of the Heavenly Emperors did obtain the Dao Fruit of this realm and self-proclaimed himself its Ruler, acting with great arrogance. But what is there to fear?” He spoke with utter disdain. “In the eyes of our sect’s True Lords, he is nothing but a bumpkin. As for the other beings, they are just a bunch of rotten fish and broken shrimp, earthen chickens and clay dogs—not worth mentioning!”

He spoke with absolute conviction, showing extreme confidence in the sect’s strength.

Xu Yunfan did not dare to be negligent and asked for several details. “I wonder what the Heavenly Dao is like there? If a Dao Fruit exists, will the will of the heavens and earth be vigorous?”

Lu Chuan answered each question one by one, his tone calm yet clear.

“The Heavenly Dao is vigorous, and there are indeed traces of it. However, since you hold the authority of the vanguard, you can naturally set up formations to draw in primordial energy to neutralize it. Rest assured, the True Lord will secretly intervene and suppress the Heavenly Dao of that realm. We have already made contact with the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect regarding this matter. In matters of dividing other realms, there is a tacit understanding.”

A hint of mockery couldn’t help but appear in Lu Chuan’s eyes. Even though the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect is called a group of sword maniacs, they are selective about their targets.

“As for the local beings, most are at the Qi Condensation level. Those at the early Foundation Establishment stage are already as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. If we deal with them seriously, there will be no problem.”

Xu Yunfan carefully memorized this and asked about the spiritual lands and common locations of treasures within the realm. Lu Chuan simply gave the three-word advice: “Go with fate.”

A realm that has fully nurtured a Dao Fruit, unlike the barren land of the Divine Martial Realm, naturally has countless treasures within it. As the chief commander of the vanguard, Xu Yunfan’s contribution will be significant, and he can freely take what he wants as long as he survives. Of course, if a True Lord takes a fancy to something, he would have to swallow his pride and accept it.

Through this Q&A session, Xu Yunfan now had a general grasp of the situation. Although this trip involves the covetous gaze of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, it was not particularly dangerous.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan’s expression had gradually settled, Lu Chuan suddenly changed the topic.

“Forget it, there is no benefit in saying more about the affairs of the Heavenly Realm. With your abilities, you can handle it yourself. However, there is another urgent matter that Senior Brother must mention. The movements of the bald donkeys of the Bodhisattva Pure Land in the Eastern Wasteland are likely to trigger a great change in the heavens and earth.”

Xu Yunfan was taken aback. “The Eastern Wasteland?”

Lu Chuan nodded, his expression turning grave. “Do you know that the ‘Ceremony of the King Buddha’ set down by the World Honored One Tathagata of the Bodhisattva Pure Land is nearing completion? The Tripitaka group has been traveling through the Eastern Wasteland for decades, sorting out the earth veins, slaying demons and eliminating evils, cleansing filth, and accumulating boundless merit, which is now like rivers converging into the sea. The True Lord made a special divination; the ceremony will be completed in about twenty years. At that time, the Buddhist sect intends to establish the ‘Position of the Self-World King Buddha’ and descend, turning the Eastern Wasteland into a Buddhist kingdom on earth. That World Honored One Tathagata truly has no shame, secretly intervening himself to add momentum, attempting to invade and seize the foundations of the Primordial Origin Sect and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. This matter... is truly despicable.”

At this point, Lu Chuan felt a bit guilty, his eyes darting around as if afraid the World Honored One Tathagata would hear and personally descend to teach him a lesson. But soon, his confidence returned. His Primordial Origin Sect wasn’t without a Dao Lord.

Xu Yunfan was secretly shocked. He had always known the Buddhist sect’s methods were secretive, but he never imagined that the lofty World Honored One would deign to personally step into the fray.

“Are the Primordial Origin Sect and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect just going to stand by and watch?” His tone was urgent, clearly worried about the sect’s great cause. If the Eastern Wasteland fell and became a Buddhist kingdom, the Bodhisattva Pure Land would likely gain several Bodhisattvas. The balance of power among the three parties would be lost, and the Great Ruin Realm of Taihua would surely face a great calamity.

Upon hearing the question, the corner of Lu Chuan’s mouth suddenly curled into a cold sneer.

“We will interfere, of course we will. Otherwise, wouldn’t our reputation as a Demonic Sect be in vain?”

“Junior Brother, the fact that the True Lords are not making a show of themselves is not due to a lack of strategy, but rather because they are waiting. When the Buddhist ceremony nears completion, the sword maniacs of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect and the True Lords of our sect will surely引天外群魔降世引动天外群魔降世 (yǐn tiān wài qún mó jiàng shì) - this phrase was cut off in the original text, but the meaning is clear: they will summon a horde of demons from beyond the heavens to descend. At that time, it will be their turn to suffer the ‘Human Calamity.’ What merit, what Buddhist kingdom? In that storm of slaughter, it will be nothing but a fleeting dream. Hah, let the bald donkeys of the Bodhisattva Pure Land taste what true demonic power is!”

Three days later.

Above the vast sea of clouds, the massive floating platform of the Primordial Origin Sect hovered outside a relatively weak node in the void.

On the platform, figures swarmed, and a killing intent permeated the air.

Xu Yunfan stood at the very front of the platform. Behind him was a dark, sprawling mass of nearly ten thousand Qi Condensation disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect.

These disciples came from various peaks and lineages, their expressions varied: excited, nervous, bewildered, fierce. But the vast majority possessed the quality of the Primordial Origin Sect—the tenacity characteristic of a Demonic Sect. Those who had been selected naturally had some skill.

These personnel would be the cannon fodder on the front lines of the Heavenly Realm. How many could survive this cruel vanguard operation depended entirely on their own fate, strength, and a little bit of luck.

In front of them, seven figures stood slightly behind Xu Yunfan on either side, radiating spiritual pressure far surpassing that of Qi Condensation.
