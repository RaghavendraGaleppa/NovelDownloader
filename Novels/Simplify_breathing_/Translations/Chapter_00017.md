# Chapter 17: The Portrait

"What exquisite footwork!"

Jian Liang's eyes lit up slightly. Just as he was about to speak further, he saw Chen Fei already desperately running out of the alley. Jian Liang sneered. He was about to give chase and finish the person off when suddenly a sound came from the courtyard. Jian Liang frowned slightly, hesitated for a moment, then turned and rushed back into the courtyard.

A moment later, Jian Liang stood on the courtyard wall again, his sleeve cuff now stained with blood. Jian Liang looked around, but Chen Fei was nowhere to be seen. Jian Liang's face was expressionless. He felt as if he had seen that person before, but with such footwork, if he had truly seen it, he would likely have a deep impression and wouldn't forget. Jian Liang frowned slightly. The night wind blew, and he vanished from his spot.

A li away, Chen Fei hid in a corner, only slightly relaxing after confirming that no one was pursuing him. This luck was truly terrible; to actually encounter this group of mountain bandits within the city. That household just now was likely doomed. Facing those mountain bandits, Chen Fei could barely protect himself, let alone save anyone else.

"I got a bit carried away," Chen Fei muttered to himself. If it weren't for his movement technique reaching Grand Completion, almost becoming an instinct, Chen Fei would have had no way to dodge Jian Liang's blade. "My cultivation is still too low after all." Chen Fei looked up in the direction of the courtyard. "My movement technique still needs to be stacked further. The two don't conflict; in fact, they complement each other!"

After encouraging Liu Jun for a few words, Chen Fei went to the alchemy room and began refining Blood Qi Pills. Refining a few more batches today, Chen Fei could raise the experience value of the Spirit Return Pill to the Proficient level, allowing him to officially begin refining Spirit Return Pills.

A quarter of an hour later, the alchemy furnace opened. Five Blood Qi Pills lay inside, and on the panel, the Spirit Return Pill's experience value increased by 5. The experience value was calculated based on the number of Blood Qi Pills produced. If it weren't for this, Chen Fei wouldn't have been able to raise the Spirit Return Pill's experience value to its current level within a few days.

After putting the Blood Qi Pills into a medicine bottle and simply cleaning the furnace, Chen Fei focused wholeheartedly on refining the second batch of Blood Qi Pills. The third, fourth, and fifth batches followed. After completing five full batches of Blood Qi Pills, Chen Fei couldn't help but exhale a turbid breath. Although his Blood Qi Pill technique was at Grand Completion, refining continuously like this was still quite taxing on his mind. Chen Fei glanced at his panel, a smile appearing on his face.

[Alchemy: Spirit Return Pill (Proficient 2/1000)]

"I can refine Spirit Return Pills now!"

Valuing Chen Fei's alchemy skills, and also to support his refining, the medical hall specifically provided Chen Fei with one free set of Spirit Return Pill ingredients every day.

After an unknown period, Chen Fei awoke. The fatigue from refining pills earlier had completely vanished, and he felt refreshed and energetic. His gaze fell upon the panel, and Chen Fei couldn't help but smile.

[Realm: Skin Refinement (593/1000)]

The Spirit Return Pill had increased his cultivation by a full 15 points. Previously, with the Grand Completion Wind Suspension Breathing Technique and Blood Qi Pills, Chen Fei would have needed almost a month to break through to the Muscle Refinement realm. Now, switching to Spirit Return Pills, although he could only take one a day, the time required was only half a month, cutting it down by half.

Perhaps to other martial artists, this reduction in time held little meaning, as the price of a Spirit Return Pill was dozens of times that of a Blood Qi Pill. One Spirit Return Pill, ten taels of silver. No deception, no bargaining! This shortened half-month was entirely bought with silver, far too extravagant. But as an alchemist, Chen Fei understood that the value of the ingredients used for both pills differed by at most double; the rest was purely the value of the technique.
