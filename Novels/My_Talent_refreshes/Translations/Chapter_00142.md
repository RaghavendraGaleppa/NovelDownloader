# Chapter 142: Awe-Inspiring, Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands

The place was too bloody, with corpses strewn everywhere, naturally making it unsuitable to linger. So, the group advanced about a *li*.

By this time, Cheng Jinhe had roughly learned what had transpired and profusely thanked and praised everyone. His enthusiasm for Chu Ning, in particular, grew threefold. The few hired guards had no complaints about this. Strength was paramount, a truth as valid in the cultivation world as it was in the mortal realm.

The group settled down, but after the recent events, most people had lost all desire to sleep. The middle-aged grey-clothed man, Yu Zhengchun, surprisingly initiated a conversation with Chu Ning.

"Young Hero Chu, what sword art was that? I saw your moves just now, seemingly plain, yet every strike was incredibly practical and exquisite. Such a sword art is truly unheard of."

Hearing this, Chu Ning glanced at Yu Zhengchun. This man was usually a man of few words; in the past month, their combined conversation had not exceeded ten sentences. Seeing that not only Yu Zhengchun but also the others were looking at him with great curiosity, Chu Ning smiled and said, "I'm afraid Brother Yu and the others haven't heard of this sword art of mine. It's called the Nine Swords of Dugu."

"Nine Swords of Dugu?"
"Nine Swords of Dugu?"

No sooner had Chu Ning spoken than several gasps echoed. Yu Zhengchun and the others even showed expressions of deep thought, seemingly pondering which sect's martial art it could be. Chu Ning chuckled inwardly and, seizing the opportunity, continued:

"This sword art emphasizes striking later to arrive first, and formless overcomes form. That's why, Brother Yu, you see no specific moves in my sword art."

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, all the martial artists present exchanged glances, many with expressions of shock. Chu Ning, however, said no more, maintaining a profound and enigmatic demeanor. Despite being filled with questions, the others found it inappropriate to ask further, as it might infringe upon others' cultivation secrets. Yu Zhengchun also stood up from beside Chu Ning, his face serious. Subtly, he exchanged glances with Shen Shaohai, who was not far away. The two then casually walked a bit apart, one after the other, and found a spot to sit down.

Shen Shaohai continued carving a wooden root, while Yu Zhengchun leaned in, seemingly interested in watching, but his gaze remained fixed on the crowd. They spoke in hushed tones, quiet enough for only those nearby to hear.

"Fifth Brother, do you think we should still go through with it tomorrow?" Yu Zhengchun asked Shen Shaohai in a low voice.

Shen Shaohai's face was grim. "Big Brother, are you backing out?"

"This guy, Chu, who knows what his background is, his strength is simply too formidable," Yu Zhengchun said, his eyes filled with worry. "Today, we deliberately spread rumors to lure these horse bandits, but it didn't cause much damage to him. I'm worried..." Yu Zhengchun stopped there, not finishing his sentence.

Shen Shaohai's eyes flashed with ruthlessness upon hearing this. "Big Brother, no matter how powerful he is, he's still just one person. If overt means don't work, can't we resort to covert ones? Tomorrow, we'll find an opportunity to ambush him directly. As long as we take care of this guy Chu, the others like Li Song will be at our mercy."

Yu Zhengchun's expression subtly shifted when he heard Shen Shaohai's words. "Fifth Brother, how confident are you?"

"Eighty percent!" Shen Shaohai said confidently. "Don't you trust my hidden weapons? Besides, we'll have Third Brother and Fourth Sister assisting."

Yu Zhengchun hesitated for a long while before finally gritting his teeth. "Alright, we'll proceed as planned. We'll do this job. We've been following for over a month; we can't let that brat ruin it for us."

A faint smile appeared on Shen Shaohai's face. "That's more like it. As for the others, just give them a signal when the time comes."

After they had agreed, Yu Zhengchun feigned boredom, stood up, and started moving around. Shen Shaohai continued carving. Their actions and expressions were perfectly natural, making it impossible for anyone to detect anything amiss.

However, they had no idea that every single word they spoke, which they believed even the sharpest ears couldn't catch, was clearly heard by Chu Ning.

"Just as I suspected. These few really do know each other, and they definitely have ulterior motives," Chu Ning muttered to himself. His spiritual sense was keen, and he had already suspected something. Although the few had pretended not to know each other, Chu Ning had long observed their unconscious subtle interactions and exchanges in their words and deeds.

Chu Ning continued to feign ignorance, his eyes closed, resuming his cultivation of the Spirit Refining Art.

The night passed without incident. The next morning, the group, feeling a bit fatigued, continued their journey forward.

"Everyone, cheer up! If we pick up the pace, we'll cross the North Dry Gully by noon and reach the town ahead by afternoon. Once there, we can have a good night's rest." Li Song shouted in a deep voice. Despite a night of commotion, he was still full of vigor. At his call, everyone resumed their journey, steeling their spirits as they pressed on.

However, by midday, when they reached North Dry Gully, the entire team's morale was low, and everyone looked sluggish. After all, they hadn't rested all night and had been traveling continuously. They weren't made of iron.

At this moment, Shen Shaohai, who was walking at the front of the group, was also yawning and looking dispirited. Even the grip of his hand on the horse's reins had weakened. Consequently, he naturally fell back a position from Chu Ning, with whom he had been riding alongside.

He exchanged a look with Han Wangang and Du Huarong. The next moment, a sharp glint flashed in Shen Shaohai's eyes. With a flick of his hand, his iron fan opened, and several black streaks of light shot towards Chu Ning's back. At the same time, several short arrows also shot out from Shen Shaohai's sleeve, following closely behind the black streaks. These short arrows were not aimed at Chu Ning's back but cleverly blocked Chu Ning's evasion routes. At this point, whether Chu Ning remained still or moved left or right, he would undoubtedly be hit by one of the hidden weapons.

Seeing this, a hint of triumph appeared on Shen Shaohai's face. However, the next moment, he was slightly taken aback. Chu Ning seemed to have eyes on his back. He raised his massive sword and casually swung it backward.

"Clang! Clang!"

After a few clanging sounds, he had directly blocked all the black streaks of light. At the same time, Chu Ning remained steadily seated, and the short arrows that had originally blocked his evasion simply flew past his side.

"Attack!" Shen Shaohai's face changed drastically, and he roared. However, even before his shout, Han Wangang and Du Huarong had already moved. The two flew directly from their horses, one wielding a bronze hammer and the other a long sword, both attacking Chu Ning simultaneously.

Immediately following them, Shen Shaohai also soared into the air. His iron fan, with some mechanism he pressed, extruded a short sword. Holding the short sword, he thrust it directly at Chu Ning's heart. The three moved incredibly fast; even Li Song and the others at the back of the group hadn't reacted before the three had already closed in on Chu Ning.

Just as their weapons were about to strike Chu Ning simultaneously, Chu Ning raised his right hand, casually swung his massive sword.

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

Several more sounds rang out. The three discovered, as if seeing a ghost, that with just that single swing, all three of their weapons had been blocked, one after another. At the same time, the three felt a tremendous force assault them. Their tiger's mouths buzzed, and their weapons all flew out of their hands. Their bodies, too, were shaken by this impact, causing them to plummet to the ground.

"How is this possible?"

Looking at Chu Ning, who was still calmly seated on his horse, then slowly turned around, his face serene. The faces of the few on the ground turned pale, their eyes filled with terror.

"What's going on?"

Behind them, Li Song and the others finally noticed the abnormality and immediately spurred their horses forward. Seeing the three people on the ground, Li Song's face was as dark as ink.

"Brother Li, haven't you figured it out yet? These five are not so simple," Chu Ning said slowly, his tone relaxed. Meanwhile, on the surrounding hillsides, figures emerged from their hiding places, brandishing weapons and charging down.

Li Song's face immediately changed drastically. Suddenly realizing something, he shouted, "The Black Mountain Five!" As he uttered those five words, Li Song's heart turned cold. The Black Mountain Five were not ordinary bandits of this road, but were infamous in the surrounding several nations. Many merchants met their end at the hands of these five each year. It was said that these five were all highly skilled in martial arts, appearing and disappearing without a trace. People in the martial world only knew they were exceptionally skilled, but no one could truly describe their appearances. It was precisely because of this that Li Song hadn't made the connection when the five had arrived one after another. Thinking of their superb martial arts, Li Song felt a hint of despair, knowing he would likely be hard-pressed to defeat even one of them, even if he fought with all his might.

Li Song's face changed dramatically. Yu Zhengchun and the skinny, monkey-like Dai Zuen behind him also blanched. They had never imagined that the combined sneak attack of Shen Shaohai and the others would be so easily repelled by Chu Ning.

The next moment, they almost simultaneously leapt up, aiming for the carriage where Cheng Jinhe was seated.

"Master!" Li Song and the other guards behind him were shocked and furious.

But just then, a ghostly figure appeared beside the carriage.

"Bang!" "Bang!"

The next moment, accompanied by two dull thuds, two figures were sent directly flying into the air. They then crashed heavily about five *zhang* away. After spitting out a mouthful of blood, they breathed their last.

"Big Brother!"
"Second Brother!"

The three who had just had their weapons knocked away at the front now cried out. At this moment, as they watched Chu Ning slowly approaching from behind, their eyes held nothing but terror.

"You... who exactly are you?" Shen Shaohai's face had lost its usual carefree demeanor. He looked at Chu Ning as if he had seen a ghost.

"You don't need to know." As the voice faded, Chu Ning's figure flickered and vanished. The next moment, three more figures flew up and then fell, devoid of any life.

And those bandits who had just charged down, seeing this sight, also stopped in their tracks, at a loss.

"The leaders are dead!" Someone shouted. Instantly, hundreds of people scattered like startled birds.

All of this happened in a flash of lightning. From Shen Shaohai's attack to Chu Ning's two swift counterattacks, by the time Li Song and the others reacted, there were only five more corpses on the ground, with no other changes.

For a moment, everyone couldn't help but be awe-inspired by Chu Ning.

"Young Hero Chu is too amazing!"
"Yeah, five people, yet no one could even withstand one move from him!" A group of guards exclaimed in amazement.

The deputy leader, Yao Song, murmured, his eyes filled with wonder. "Such martial arts actually exist in this world!"

"Young Hero Chu..." Li Song now roughly understood what had happened. Greatly relieved, he quickly approached Chu Ning, cupped his fists, and started to say something.

"No need for formalities. I accepted your master's silver and promised to complete the escort. As for what just happened, it's merely because my senses are sharp; I happened to overhear their conversation a couple of days ago. Let's hurry on our way."

Hearing Chu Ning say this, Li Song naturally said no more and gestured to the others to continue the journey. Now, Chu Ning was the only one leading the way. However, no one felt anything was amiss. After all, Chu Ning had already demonstrated absolute strength in two consecutive battles.

Behind him, Li Song looked at Chu Ning's back with complicated emotions. When Chu Ning first appeared, he had been somewhat wary. When Cheng Jinhe strongly invited Chu Ning to join, Li Song was very concerned. After a brief skirmish between the two, he knew that he was absolutely no match for this person. So, throughout the journey, he had been carefully observing Chu Ning, guarding against any potential trouble from him. This caution, ironically, made him overlook the other individuals. He had never expected that the Black Mountain Five, legendary martial artists and ruthless killers, would be hidden within their own ranks. Yet, in front of Chu Ning, they were utterly defenseless. A true master! He had truly encountered a master!

For the rest of the journey, everyone in the group became increasingly respectful of Chu Ning. At this point, Li Song naturally no longer mentioned recruiting others to supplement the team; with Chu Ning alone, it was more than enough.

Over the next nearly two months, the journey was still not entirely peaceful, encountering bandits several times along the way. However, under the protection of Chu Ning, this "peerless expert," no accidents occurred.

There was one incident midway that left Chu Ning somewhat amused and exasperated. The deputy leader, Yao Song, actually came to him wanting to become his disciple, and without a word, was ready to perform the discipleship ritual. Of course, Chu Ning directly refused. But the man was persistent, attempting to pay homage for several consecutive days. Finally, only after Chu Ning grew annoyed and angry did the man give up.

Traveling northward, with Chu Ning clearing the path, the carriage group felt much safer and moved faster. They even arrived at their destination five days ahead of schedule. Chu Ning declined Cheng Jinhe and Li Song's enthusiastic invitations to stay. As soon as they reached their destination, he departed directly. As for Cheng Jinhe offering him six times the agreed remuneration, Chu Ning did not refuse, but he didn't take gold or silver; instead, he requested several pieces of high-quality jade.

Leaving the group, Chu Ning continued his journey north, arriving at a place called Hushan Lake.

"Young Hero, it's not that I don't want to go, but any other direction is fine. But heading continuously east, that's the Land of Immortals. If you don't tell me the exact location, I wouldn't dare go." At a ferry crossing at Hushan Lake, a boatman in front of Chu Ning shook his head like a rattle drum.

Chu Ning didn't press. He directly took out a silver ingot. "Then, boatman, how about I buy this boat from you?"

"Yes! Yes!" The boatman happily accepted the silver. Watching Chu Ning's departing back, the boatman shook his head and murmured, "Looks like another person dreaming of seeking immortality. Every year, I don't know how many young people go, but I've never heard of anyone actually achieving their wish."

Chu Ning heard the murmur from afar and couldn't help but smile faintly. According to the information he had obtained from the Qingxi Sect, the area where Hushan Lake was located was known as the Thousand Lakes, Thousand Islands. This vast region, spanning tens of thousands of *li*, was filled with lakes and islands. However, only one or two tenths of these islands had spiritual energy, and their spiritual veins were of low grade. Most were only first or second-tier spiritual veins, their spiritual energy density far inferior to a third-tier spiritual vein like the Qingxia Mountain Range. In terms of spiritual energy, it was only comparable to the Qingxia Mountain Range near Yanji Market.

Furthermore, this area was vast and truly difficult to manage. Therefore, there wasn't a single large sect in the Thousand Lakes, Thousand Islands. However, because there were indeed many spiritual veins nearby, numerous rogue cultivators gradually gathered here, mostly dividing their influence by islands. Later, Foundation Establishment stage rogue cultivators appeared among the islands. These Foundation Establishment cultivators united to form the Thousand Island Alliance. Thus, the Thousand Lakes, Thousand Islands finally had a nominal governing organization.

Although such governance was undoubtedly extremely loose, they could unite to resist external cultivators. However, internal minor disputes were unavoidable. Fortunately, Golden Core stage cultivators usually looked down upon the spiritual veins in this area, so overall, there hadn't been any major upheavals.

Chu Ning chose to come here for several reasons. Firstly, there were many rogue cultivators here, a mixed bag of people, making it easy to conceal his identity. Secondly, the highest cultivation level in the Thousand Island Alliance was only Foundation Establishment, which gave him a greater sense of security. And a very crucial point was that he heard that here, as long as one was willing to pay a certain amount of spirit stones to the Thousand Island Alliance, one could choose a spiritual vein location within the Thousand Lakes, Thousand Islands to settle down.

With all these conditions aligning perfectly, Chu Ning had already designated this place as his destination before leaving the sect. And now, after more than three months of travel, he had finally arrived.

"If the information I saw from the Qingxi Sect is accurate, then 800 *li* east of Hushan Lake, I should reach the first spiritual island in the Thousand Lakes, Thousand Islands: Rainbow Mist Island. If I fly on my artifact now, I could sustain myself for 800 *li*, but first, I'm worried about any taboos in this vicinity. Secondly, it would consume a lot of my magic power, which wouldn't be safe."

As this thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind, he slowly paddled the boat towards Rainbow Mist Island. Upon reaching this vicinity, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was more abundant than in the mortal world. After moving a short distance deeper, he looked out to see green mountains, clear waters, and mist-shrouded white clouds, truly giving off an ethereal, almost immortal, otherworldly feel.

Chu Ning was overjoyed. He simply tossed a Clear Wind Talisman, letting it propel the small boat forward, while he lay down. Immersed in this landscape, with his mind at peace, he felt quite free and at ease.

A few days later, a small island enveloped in a faint colorful mist appeared not far in front of Chu Ning. It was Rainbow Mist Island.
