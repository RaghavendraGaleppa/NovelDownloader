"I have the seeds!"

As Gu Xiaoqing spoke, she immediately pulled a small cloth bag from her storage pouch. From it, she poured out several small, yellow, rice-sized seeds.

Chu Ning took them and, with a quick glance, confirmed they were indeed Golden Yuan Fruit seeds, and of good quality too.

"Alright, then I'll use ten acres to plant these Golden Yuan Fruits," Chu Ning decided on the spot.

"Senior Sister, lend me the seeds for now; I'll return them later."

At this, a hint of a smile flashed in Gu Xiaoqing's eyes as she handed the small bag of seeds to Chu Ning. "Consider these seeds a gift from me to Junior Brother Chu. I only hope that when your Golden Yuan Fruits mature, you can sell them to me at a slightly cheaper price."

Listening to Gu Xiaoqing's gentle voice, Chu Ning didn't let himself get carried away. He took the seeds from her slender hand, gave a noncommittal laugh, and vaguely replied, "I'll have to wait until these Golden Yuan Fruits are successfully grown. I haven't planted this type of spirit fruit before, so I'm not sure if I'll end up wasting Senior Sister's seeds."

Naturally, Chu Ning couldn't immediately promise a significant discount just because the other party provided the seeds. After all, if Chu Ning applied to the sect, Golden Yuan Fruit seeds could be obtained for free. If nothing unexpected happened, Gu Xiaoqing likely acquired them through the same method.

"Oh, right, Senior Sister Gu, even if I use spell arts to ripen these Golden Yuan Fruits, it'll take at least several months for them to mature and be suitable for medicinal use. I won't be able to provide them to you during this period." Chu Ning quickly changed the subject.

Hearing Chu Ning deflect, Gu Xiaoqing couldn't help but glance at him, then replied, "Junior Brother Chu, don't worry. I've already brought some Golden Yuan Fruits with me, and during this time, Steward Lin will regularly bring more to my residence."

Chu Ning nodded. "That's good then."

As they weren't very familiar with each other, once the important matters were discussed, there wasn't much more to say. Gu Xiaoqing then bid farewell and left. Before stepping out, she paused slightly, turning back to say, "Junior Brother Chu, Junior Brother Luo didn't achieve his goal, so he might make things difficult for you later. And the talisman-making art of Fengxia Valley is quite unique, so your pressure won't be small in the future. If there's anything you need my help with, don't hesitate to ask."

Chu Ning gave a slight cupped-hand salute. "Thank you, Senior Sister."

Gu Xiaoqing smiled, said nothing more, and gracefully departed.

It wasn't until Gu Xiaoqing's silhouette disappeared that Chu Ning, with a calm expression, walked towards the back courtyard. Leaving the sect and coming to the market, his situation didn't seem to have improved much.

However, Chu Ning didn't dwell on it too much. It was just planting spirit plants and making talismans; these things wouldn't trouble him. As for having ill-intentioned people around, Chu Ning had long grown accustomed to it. Before, Cao Dongxin and Qi Chongmao—which of them was easy to get along with? Since he was arranged to be here and had the backing of two halls, he didn't believe Luo Yiping would openly target him. As for some sarcasm and cold remarks, Chu Ning wouldn't take them to heart.

First, he took out some spirit rice from his storage pouch, cooked a pot of spirit rice, and then casually prepared two dishes for lunch.

In the afternoon, Chu Ning continued to the spirit field to plant Purple Crystal Bamboo. The next day was market day, so if he didn't plant them today, he'd have to wait another day. It took him over two hours to plant all the remaining seven acres of Purple Crystal Bamboo before he left the spirit field. There wasn't enough time to plant the Golden Yuan Fruits; that would have to wait for later.

Back at the market, Chu Ning saw the shop door of the adjacent Spirit Beast House wide open. He could faintly hear Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan conversing inside, discussing the market opening tomorrow. Chu Ning had no interest in getting involved and simply returned to his own courtyard, closing the door.

After dinner, Chu Ning strolled around his two courtyards, pondering how best to utilize the space. Before coming here, he had brought some Iron Thread Vines from his old courtyard, but Chu Ning felt that planting Iron Thread Vines here would be too low-grade. After all, he still needed to cultivate with the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art, and the higher the quality of the spirit plant, the better the auxiliary cultivation effect.

Without any good ideas for now, Chu Ning set the matter aside and began to think about market affairs. There was nothing much to sell in terms of spirit plants for the time being. Chu Ning casually picked up a wooden board, wrote down "Purchasing Spirit Rice, Spirit Plants," and prepared to hang it outside the shop.

As for talismans, he had plenty. Chu Ning had been diligently making talismans for a while, and now he had a considerable number of various types. Except for the low-grade high-tier talisman Liao Yunming gave him for self-preservation and the Geng Metal Sword Talisman he learned from Mu Ling, which he wouldn't sell, all other talismans could be put up for sale.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning began to inventory his talismans. Although he had given a small portion to Zhuang Yunde and Qiu Shunyi, it was a very limited amount.

Wood Escape Talismans were the most numerous. Chu Ning had previously drawn nearly 40 Wood Escape Talismans a day, and now he had a total of 260.

Next were the low-grade low-tier talismans from the basic talisman-making manual. Chu Ning had 220 Flame Talismans, Profound Ice Talismans, and Earth Armor Talismans.

For healing, Chu Ning had 200 Rejuvenation Talismans.

Evergreen Talismans were fewer, with only 150 in his possession.

After inventorying these talismans, Chu Ning closed the board and began to write down the talisman sales information. With so many talismans, it would be too troublesome to explain each type to every customer who came to buy or sell. Having visited Qinghe Market a few times, Chu Ning had a rough idea of talisman prices.

Flame Talismans, Profound Ice Talismans, Evergreen Talismans, and Rejuvenation Talismans should be sold at two low-grade spirit stones each. Earth Armor Talismans and Wood Escape Talismans would be three low-grade spirit stones each.

With this initial calculation, Chu Ning was instantly startled by the value of his own assets. If all these talismans were sold...

Immediately, Chu Ning shook his head. Although Yanji Market had many rogue cultivators and a good sales volume for talismans and pills, it wouldn't be quick to sell off such a large quantity of talismans.

At the same time, Chu Ning's mind flashed with the contents of the Spirit Talisman Arts. Unlike the previous basic talisman jade slip, the Spirit Talisman Arts didn't delve into as much fundamental knowledge. This jade slip contained the production methods for only eight types of talismans. Five of them were low-grade mid-tier talismans, and the other three were surprisingly low-grade high-tier talismans!

However, according to the talisman knowledge introduced in the previous basic talisman-making jade slip, these low-grade high-tier talismans could only be produced by cultivators in the late-stage Qi Condensation realm. Therefore, despite coveting them, Chu Ning had to set them aside for now.

During this period, though he hadn't had time to practice, he had generally familiarized himself with the five low-grade mid-tier talismans in the Spirit Talisman Arts. There was the offensive Dark Lightning Talisman, the defensive Vajra Talisman, the Qi Concealment Talisman used for concealing one's aura, the Earth Escape Talisman for遁術, and finally, the Clear Wind Talisman, used to resist and resolve various poisons.

These types of talismans were all very commonly used among low-grade mid-tier talismans. Chu Ning wasn't in a hurry to draw these talismans; he would naturally have the time and energy to practice them here in Yanji Market.

"I heard that Fengxia Valley is also known for its talismans. I wonder what their talisman sales are like in the market," Chu Ning pondered for a moment, deciding to first observe the situation tomorrow.
