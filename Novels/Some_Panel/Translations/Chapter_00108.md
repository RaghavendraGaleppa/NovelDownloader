# Chapter 107: Exterminating the Demon, Wings of Time and Space, Quasi-Immortal Artifact Thunder Blade

"What? You can summon the Primordial Divine Lightning?" Yang Ji was startled and quickly transmitted his voice, asking.

"Yes, I am the Primordial Divine Tree, a divine seedling of heaven and earth. I used to frequently summon the Primordial Divine Lightning to play with. That Ancient Demonic Venerable fellow was blasted away by my divine lightning back then," Shen Yin said proudly.

"Back then, that was your true form, capable of withstanding the Primordial Divine Lightning. But now, you're just a fragment of your true form, so weak. I estimate even an ordinary lightning bolt would split you apart," Yang Ji shook his head and said.

"No, you're wrong. Actually, I am naturally close to lightning. I was born from the Primordial Divine Lightning itself. Lightning tribulations bring destruction, but they also harbor new life. I am a divine seedling of heaven and earth born from lightning. No matter how weak I am, no lightning can harm me," Shen Yin said, looking up.

"There's such a thing?"

Yang Ji paused, musing, and then said gravely, "But below is a mighty figure whose name is tied to 'Immortal.' If you act and draw the Primordial Divine Lightning, with their knowledge, it shouldn't be hard for them to guess that you are a seedling of the Primordial Divine Tree. This is a matter of great importance. Once you are exposed, it might lead to significant karmic repercussions in the future."

"Your true form was taken by an Immortal King. If your current identity were to become known to the world, I estimate that Tribulation Immortals from the Three Thousand Great Realms and countless minor realms would go mad, and even the Immortals from the heavens would descend to seize you. By then, the consequences would be unpredictable."

"That's true. I don't want to be imprisoned like my true form. It's more comfortable and free to stay by Big Brother's side," Shen Yin tilted her head, wrinkling her small nose, and said, "Then I won't help him. Anyway, he has already suppressed the Sky Demon. This Sky Demon is probably doomed."

But just as Yang Ji was about to speak, an ancient voice suddenly echoed in his ear: "Young friend, do you possess the Primordial Divine Tree? I sensed its aura."

Yang Ji was shocked and looked around, his gaze sweeping over the Immortal-Beating Stone and the five Integration stage cultivators, finally settling on the Demonic Well.

"It's me, my name is Mu Yuan. Young friend, do you possess the Primordial Divine Tree? I sensed its aura," the ancient voice, clearly tinged with a hint of excitement, came again.

"Shen Yin is hidden within the Mountain and Sea Pearl. This person actually sensed her aura through the world barrier?" Yang Ji was greatly astonished, his expression instantly turning solemn.

"Young friend, don't be nervous. I bear no ill will. The reason I could sense the Primordial Divine Tree is that my Taiyuan Dao Sect also cultivated a Primordial Divine Tree seedling in the past," the voice offered reassurance and goodwill.

Yang Ji's gaze probed into the Demonic Well, seeing [Excitement] and [Hope].

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan's words truly surprised him. Following the sound waves, he transmitted his voice: "Senior's sect also had a Primordial Divine Tree seedling in the past?"

"Yes, I'm not lying to you. Our Taiyuan Dao Sect faced this tribulation precisely because of that Primordial Divine Tree seedling," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan said, his words astonishing, each one like a clap of thunder in Yang Ji's ears.

He hadn't expected that the Taiyuan Dao Sect's tribulation originated from the Primordial Divine Tree.

Soon, Grand Venerable Mu Yuan's voice came again.

"A complete Primordial Divine Tree is a treasure that guards realms, comparable to an Immortal King's artifact. In some aspects, its wondrous uses are millions of times better than an Immortal King's artifact. Just holding a realm-guarding treasure during a tribulation, where the lightning tribulation is halved, is enough to make everyone in the world go mad, let alone its other wondrous uses."

"Even a replica of a realm-guarding treasure is enough to make Tribulation Immortals fight to the death, let alone a seedling of the Primordial Divine Tree. It's enough to make all forces under heaven covet it."

"With the Primordial Divine Tree in hand, the number of Tribulation Immortals in a sect will multiply. This is an immense benefit, and all sects would be envious."

"Our Taiyuan Dao Sect produced three Tribulation Immortals within a century, and two of them safely passed their lightning tribulations again. This drew the attention of the Sky Demons, leading to the disaster that wiped out our sect. Now, that Primordial Divine Seedling has fallen into the hands of the Sky Demons. Over two hundred thousand years have passed; the strength of the extraterrestrial Sky Demons must have increased far too much. Truly a calamity," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan lamented.

"Young friend, since you possess the Primordial Divine Tree and have coincidentally arrived here, this is our fated connection. I implore you, young friend, to use the Primordial Divine Tree to draw forth the Primordial Divine Lightning and help me slay this demon. Afterward, I, Mu Yuan, will surely repay you handsomely."

"Furthermore, regarding your possession of the Primordial Divine Tree, I, Mu Yuan, swear by my divine soul never to mention it to outsiders. Afterward, I will absolutely not harm you, young friend, nor damage any of your related interests."

"Should I violate this oath, I, Mu Yuan, shall be struck by lightning on that very day, my divine soul eternally imprisoned in the Underworld, suffering for ten thousand generations, never to reincarnate."

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan let out a low roar, invoking the Dao of Heaven and Earth, engraving mysterious runes into his divine soul.

Yang Ji looked over and immediately saw an information display: [Heavenly Dao Soul Oath, bound by Heaven, supervised by Heaven. If violated, the soul will be annihilated, never to reincarnate.]

"Grand Venerable Mu Yuan actually made such an oath," Yang Ji was startled. He then looked at the Immortal-Beating Stone and, seeing no unusual information display above its head, he murmured inwardly, "Grand Venerable Mu Yuan didn't transmit a message to the Immortal-Beating Stone before making the Heavenly Dao Oath. It seems he's being sincere."

"Damn it!" Just then, Grand Venerable Mu Yuan suddenly let out a muffled roar of anger.

Inside the Demonic Well, a rumbling vibration suddenly erupted. Demonic energy surged forth, breaking out of the well, causing the rune light shield to hum and tremble non-stop.

Waves of tragic and terrifying aura fiercely crashed against the light shield. A peerless demon king seemed intent on breaking out of the formation.

At this moment, the Pure Yang Purple Lightning descending from the sky blasted into the Demonic Well along the iron pillar. Although it obliterated a large amount of demonic energy, its effect was greatly diminished.

"What's going on? Why did the demonic energy suddenly surge? Has this Sky Demon's power increased?" Everyone exclaimed in shock, their expressions changing drastically upon seeing this scene.

Yang Ji's expression slightly darkened. He probed with his gaze and saw [Distracted Conversation], [Sky Demon Counter-Suppression], and [Sorrow].

Not good!

This Sky Demon actually counter-suppressed Grand Venerable Mu Yuan?

"Big Brother, let me summon the Primordial Divine Lightning. Since this matter originated because of me, then I shall be the one to end this tribulation. Although I have never met the other Primordial Divine Tree seedling, we are karmically connected. This senior's fated connection is not with you, but with me."

Shen Yin suddenly became solemn and spoke to Yang Ji in a deep voice.

"This? You truly intend to do this?" Yang Ji said gravely.

Shen Yin nodded resolutely: "Although this tribulation was caused by another Primordial Divine Tree seedling, she is me; we are karmically linked. Coming here might truly be destined. Let me be the one to end this tribulation."

"Alright, since you've made your decision, I have no right to interfere. This is your karma, so you shall resolve it. The extraterrestrial Sky Demons coveted you; now you kill the demon, which can be considered a rotation of karma," Yang Ji said.

"Senior, please transmit a message to Senior Immortal-Beating Stone and the other five Integration stage cultivators to enter my Mountain and Sea World. Next, I will summon the Primordial Divine Lightning, and I don't wish for them to see it," Yang Ji transmitted.

"Alright, young friend, thank you for your righteous assistance," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan said with gritted teeth, clearly struggling.

The next moment, the Immortal-Beating Stone and the other five Integration stage cultivators all frowned and looked at Yang Ji, curiously examining him, but none spoke.

Yang Ji said nothing more. He took out the Mountain and Sea Pearl and opened a portal to enter.

They had been trapped in this secret realm for a thousand years. Grand Venerable Mu Yuan had never communicated with them before. Though they hesitated at his sudden message today, they exchanged glances and then transformed into streaks of light, entering Yang Ji's Mountain and Sea World.

The Immortal-Beating Stone, confused, stroked its beard, stared at Yang Ji for a moment with wide eyes, and finally flew in as well.

With no one else around, Shen Yin and the Buddha Child took the opportunity to fly out.

"Holy cow, this Sky Demon is so powerful! Such demonic might is truly rare in the world," the Buddha Child exclaimed in surprise, seeing the surging demonic energy crash against the rune light shield.

"Today, we exterminate the demon," Shen Yin gazed at the Demonic Well, bits and pieces of her past encounters with Sky Demons flooding her mind. Her innocent gaze suddenly turned sharp.

She leaped and flew onto the iron pillar, which was over a hundred zhang tall, startling the Buddha Child, who cried out repeatedly: "Sister Shen Yin, what are you doing? That iron pillar draws Pure Yang Purple Lightning! You can't stay there, hurry and leave!"

Just as his voice fell, a thunderous roar erupted from the dark mist in the sky. Crackle! Endless Pure Yang Purple Lightning surged down the iron pillar, directly striking the top of Shen Yin's head.

Instantly, a dazzling purple light flared, and electrical arcs spread everywhere. A thick, eight-zhang wide lightning bolt, connecting heaven and earth, completely engulfed Shen Yin.

The Buddha Child's expression changed, and Yang Ji's expression also grew tense.

Only when the Pure Yang Purple Lightning poured into the Demonic Well, revealing that small, unharmed figure, did Yang Ji quietly let out a sigh of relief.

"Holy cow, Sister Shen Yin is that amazing? That's Pure Yang Purple Lightning! It blasted down and annihilated a whole section of demonic energy, yet she's completely fine!" the Buddha Child exclaimed, his eyes wide with astonishment.

At this moment, Shen Yin was solemn and lost in thought, gazing at the sky. Countless purple electrical arcs darted back and forth within the dark mist of death, crackling, clearly brewing the next wave of Pure Yang Purple Lightning.

It was also at this moment that a layer of green light suddenly emerged from her body, then twisted into a fist-sized beam, shooting straight into the sky, piercing through the mist, and delving deep into the firmament.

Immediately after, a heaven-and-earth pressure that shook the soul suddenly appeared in the firmament. An indescribable terrifying power was brewing, and an ancient, vast aura spread.

At this moment, Yang Ji felt as if his heart was about to stop beating, and his soul trembled.

He quickly pulled the startled Buddha Child and retreated rapidly. It was just as they flew a hundred zhang away.

"Roar!" A low roar of anger came from within the Demonic Well. The earth trembled, the Demonic Well violently shook, and the iron pillar extending deep into it instantly shattered into dust, collapsing section by section. Even the Nine Heavens Ten Earth Sealing Array showed signs of crumbling.

The very next moment, *Boom!* The rune light shield suppressing the Demonic Well exploded, announcing the destruction of the Nine Heavens Ten Earth Sealing Array.

A jet-black demonic blade, wreathed in endless malevolent aura, burst out of the well. The terrifying murderous intent it exuded was sharp and dreadful.

It tried to rush towards the firmament, but the Demon-Subduing Array was still active. Eight iron chains firmly locked its blade, and a majestic divine dragon coiled around it, its dragon claws tightly gripping the demonic blade, binding its power.

Yang Ji's expression subtly changed. He quickly looked over and found that the divine dragon was actually [Grand Venerable Mu Yuan] transformed.

As for the demonic blade emanating chilling demonic energy, it was actually a top-grade Dao Artifact, and its artifact spirit was none other than [Emperor Prison Demon Lord].

In order to save his life and avoid being suppressed and annihilated, he had actually transformed into the artifact spirit of the demonic blade.

"Roar! Mu Yuan, you can't kill me! You actually got distracted while contending with me! Now I've broken free from your suppression, destroyed your Myriad Annihilation Lightning-Guiding Array, and even the Nine Heavens Ten Earth Sealing Array that suppressed this Demonic Well has been ruined by me. Now, if I just release my primordial aura, all the demon lords in the sky will come to my aid! How can you fight me?" The demonic blade let out an arrogant, furious laugh.

Even from hundreds of zhang away, and despite Grand Venerable Mu Yuan's suppression, the unparalleled malevolent aura emanating from the demonic blade made Yang Ji feel as if he had fallen into an ice cave, his entire body chilling.

This Sky Demon's demonic might was too immense; merely looking at it sent chills down one's spine.

But at this very moment, at the peak of the firmament, unnoticed by the Emperor Prison Demon Lord, *Whoosh whoosh whoosh!* Streaks of deep purple lightning crackled as they tore through space, like intertwined flood dragons, roaring down along the green light that shot up from Shen Yin's head.

The dazzling purple lightning surged violently, its purple glow eclipsing all creation.

Wherever the purple electrical arcs passed, hideous cracks appeared everywhere. In just a short moment, the space tearing downwards began to crumble and collapse, turning into the primordial earth, fire, wind, water, and misty haze, then vanishing into chaos.

The primordial demonic energy that Emperor Prison Demon Lord had just released touched the lightning, instantly annihilating and being similarly submerged in the chaotic mist.

"What?" Emperor Prison Demon Lord only now became aware of this world-destroying aura. He looked up in horror, crying out with boundless fear, "This aura... is the Primordial Divine Lightning? How is this possible? How could you summon the Primordial Divine Lightning?"

At this moment, he clearly saw Shen Yin suspended above his head. The response he received was a deep purple lightning bolt, which violently struck the demonic blade, instantly annihilating more than half of the demonic energy wreathed around it.

Simultaneously, the demonic blade violently trembled, and Emperor Prison Demon Lord also let out a terrifying shriek.

This wasn't the end. What terrified him even more was that the Primordial Thunder Gods in the sky seemed endless, continuously blasting down.

Unlike Pure Yang Purple Lightning, which needed to gather strength again after one strike.

Constantly bombarded by the thunder gods, his primordial demonic energy was largely worn away, instantly causing him severe vitality damage.

Emperor Prison Demon Lord felt the aura of death and paled greatly in shock.

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan, seeing the thunder gods blast down, quickly pulled back his divine dragon form, which was spiraling in the air.

"Ah! Damn it!" Emperor Prison Demon Lord let out an enraged roar, actually burning his primordial essence in a desperate struggle to break free from his predicament.

As the endless primordial demonic energy burned, the demonic blade instantly exuded unparalleled deathly blade qi, as terrifying as if it could reverse heaven and earth.

The blade qi tore through heaven and earth. Wherever it passed, black cracks appeared, extending straight towards the sky, charging against the Primordial Divine Lightning, attempting to strike down Shen Yin, who was controlling everything, with its blade qi.

But he still underestimated the terror and power of the Primordial Divine Lightning.

Even if his demonic flames raged and his fierce might was boundless, under the Primordial Divine Lightning, everything had to be annihilated, everything would turn into misty chaos.

"Roar!" Emperor Prison Demon Lord let out an unwilling roar. The Primordial Divine Lightning wore away his blade qi and struck the demonic blade again, severely injuring him.

Endless lightning engulfed him, endless purple light enveloped him.

Inside the ball of lightning, the demonic blade violently trembled. Emperor Prison Demon Lord, as if disregarding his life, frantically burned his primordial essence, only wishing for a trace of primordial demonic energy to leak out and be discovered by the extraterrestrial Sky Demons, bringing about a turning point.

But it was to no avail. Under the Primordial Divine Lightning, everything would be obliterated, everything would return to chaos.

In just a dozen breaths, there was no more movement within the purple lightning ball. Not a trace of demonic energy remained; everything seemed to have ended.

Yang Ji looked at the lightning ball, discerning everything, and said calmly, "Shen Xiaoyin, he's dead."

"Dead?" Shen Yin lowered her gaze slightly, glancing at the lightning ball below. Seeing Yang Ji nod, she then withdrew the green light, and the ancient aura filling the firmament finally dissipated.

"The Primordial Divine Lightning is indeed powerful!" In the sky not far away, the one-zhang divine dragon transformed, turning into an old man with a pale face, dressed in a black robe.

At this moment, his vitality, spirit, and essence were greatly diminished. Aside from his extraordinary attire, he seemed no different from an ordinary old man, his face showing exhaustion, appearing even sickly ordinary.

But upon closer inspection, one would find him truly extraordinary. A spiritual light flickered faintly on his forehead, profound Dao insights were hidden in his brows, and his eyes were deep, as if containing two brilliant star-filled skies.

This person had fought with Emperor Prison Demon Lord for over two hundred thousand years and still possessed such an imposing aura. Truly extraordinary, worthy of being called an Immortal in the mortal world.

"Greetings, Senior Mu Yuan," Yang Ji said, bowing.

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan stepped forward two paces, gently lifting Yang Ji with a soft power. With a smile, he instead bowed to Yang Ji and Shen Yin, who had flown down: "Many thanks to both of you for your righteous rescue. I, Mu Yuan, will remember this great kindness and will surely repay you handsomely in the future."

"Senior, our Master doesn't even have a Natal Artifact yet. Since you're the sect master, why not give him two Dao Artifacts?" the Buddha Child said, chuckling.

"Buddha Child!" Yang Ji cast a side glance, giving him a look, then said to Grand Venerable Mu Yuan, "The child is ignorant, please don't take offense, Senior."

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan wasn't angry. Instead, he smiled slightly: "I've fought with Emperor Prison Demon Lord for two hundred thousand years; my foundation is depleted, and I possess nothing. At this moment, I can't even take out a single pill, let alone a Dao Artifact."

"Senior, I think the Immortal-Beating Stone is pretty good," the Buddha Child interrupted, chuckling again.

Yang Ji's brows twitched. He couldn't help but glare at him twice.

"The Immortal-Beating Stone has accompanied me for many years and holds deep significance to me. I'm afraid I cannot part with it," Grand Venerous Mu Yuan said with a hint of apology.

"Then what about immortal arts?" the Buddha Child brazenly asked again.

Yang Ji's face darkened, and he directly brought him into the Mountain and Sea Pearl.

"The extraterrestrial Sky Demons have a blood feud with my sect; it's an endless struggle. If I were to give you, young friend, my sect's immortal arts, it would only bring you a calamity that could lead to your demise, and it might even implicate the sect behind you," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan shook his head and said.

"Senior, the child speaks without thinking; please don't take him seriously," Yang Ji replied with a smile.

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan suddenly fell silent, then looked at Yang Ji's eyes and mused, "How about this: Since you, young friend, don't have a Natal Artifact yet, I'll give you the method for forging the 'Wings of Time and Space'."

"These Wings of Time and Space were once a realm-guarding treasure of the Primordial Cultivation World, capable of controlling partial time and space Dao principles."

"With a flap of the wings, time can be paused, space can be confined, life and death controlled, allowing you to dominate as you please. They can also travel the long river of time, rewind time, and briefly investigate past events. Furthermore, they can traverse endless space, moving between various great worlds, including the Immortal Realm, making them the number one flying artifact under heaven."

"If you, young friend, can forge them, then you will possess endless good fortune."

"Additionally, young friend, you possess the Primordial Divine Tree, which allows you to use the Primordial Divine Lightning to temper your Natal Artifact, greatly shortening the forging time. This is a superior forging method that only great figures in the Immortal Realm are capable of using. Young friend, you truly are a person of great destiny!"

Mu Yuan couldn't help but exclaim.

As he spoke, he pointed a finger, and a spiritual light entered Yang Ji's glabella, imparting the entire forging method for the "Wings of Time and Space" to him.

He added: "Of course, even with the forging method, to possess the abilities of the Wings of Time and Space, you, young friend, must also comprehend the Dao of Time and Space."

Grand Venerable Mu Yuan said with a smile.

"Many thanks, Senior," Yang Ji bowed. The forging method for such a realm-guarding treasure was immensely significant; if it were to spread, it would surely cause a great stir.

"No need to thank me. I truly don't have anything good to offer right now. I hope you, young friend, won't mind," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan laughed.

"Look, why is this blade still here? Is that Sky Demon not dead yet?" Shen Yin suddenly pointed to one side.

Following her gaze, Grand Venerable Mu Yuan and Yang Ji saw a thunder blade. Yes, a thunder blade shimmering with spiritual light and covered in lightning.

"A Quasi-Immortal Artifact! Emperor Prison Demon Lord was obliterated by the Primordial Divine Lightning, but this demonic blade actually became stronger under the tempering of the divine lightning. It even transformed into a Quasi-Immortal Artifact! If it were to give birth to an artifact spirit, it would instantly become an Immortal Artifact," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan exclaimed.

"Wow, a Quasi-Immortal Artifact," the Buddha Child jumped out from the Mountain and Sea World and pounced towards the thunder blade. But just as he stepped within ten zhang, a bolt of lightning shot out from the thunder blade, instantly knocking him back.

"Ouch, this blade is so fierce and arrogant! It actually looks down on me," the Buddha Child grumbled indignantly. "Venerable Master, you go try."

A Quasi-Immortal Artifact! Yang Ji was naturally incredibly envious. He stepped forward, but just like the Buddha Child, as he entered within ten zhang, he was struck by a purple lightning bolt and knocked back.

"It's not your fated opportunity," Grand Venerable Mu Yuan shook his head. Suddenly, everyone looked at Shen Yin.

Shen Yin was startled, then sweetly called out, "Little blade, little blade, come into my hand."

*Hum!*

Instantly, the thunder blade trembled, transformed into a streak of light, and flew into Shen Yin's hand.

Shen Yin, holding a thunder blade dozens of times larger than herself, looked somewhat comical and struggled slightly. She tapped the blade and said, "It's too big, shrink a little."

*Hum!* With a flash of spiritual light, though the thunder blade hadn't given birth to an artifact spirit, it already possessed a trace of sentience. It immediately transformed into a small thunder blade, quietly resting in Shen Yin's palm.

"Hehe, you're quite obedient. I'll take you," Shen Yin said with a happy smile.

Seeing this scene, Yang Ji and the others exchanged glances, able only to cast envious looks.
