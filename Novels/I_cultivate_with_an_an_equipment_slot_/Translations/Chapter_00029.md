# Chapter 29: The Market and the Purple

Entering the market required paying spirit stones. However, as Zhang Yan was a disciple of the Qingheng Sect, he was exempt from this fee. The other members of the Liu family weren't so fortunate, though the price wasn't steep—just one spirit stone per person per day.  

Upon entry, they were also warned: no unauthorized cultivation within the market. Violators risked permanent expulsion at best, or having their cultivation crippled at worst. The reason for this rule was simple—the market sat atop a second-grade spirit vein, which primarily powered the market's grand formation. Without this restriction, the sheer number of cultivators absorbing its energy would overwhelm the vein.  

That said, those who rented inn rooms or caves within the market could tap into the spirit vein for cultivation—though the cost was exorbitant, far beyond the means of most.  

Once inside, the lively clamor of the market enveloped them.  

"Fresh spirit rice! Just harvested, cheap prices, come get yours now!"  

"Wild tier-one late-stage beast spotted! Hunters wanted, sign up here!"  

"Magic tools for sale! Family heirlooms!"  

The Qingheng Market was a world apart from the sect's own marketplace. The most obvious difference was the noise—while the sect's market was quiet, with sellers passively waiting at their stalls, the Qingheng Market was alive with the shouts of vendors and the haggling of customers.  

The reason for the contrast was straightforward. In the sect, most cultivators focused on their training, only occasionally visiting the market to sell their wares or trade for necessities. But the Qingheng Market was filled with merchants dispatched by various families from the Tianmu Mountain Range, or rogue cultivators hoping to strike it rich with their hard-earned savings.  

"We have one day here. You're free to explore, but return by afternoon for regrouping," the Liu family's Foundation Establishment elder announced, noting the eager glint in his juniors' eyes. "And don't cause trouble. If the Qingheng enforcers catch you, even I won't be able to help."  

"Yes, Elder!"  

The Liu cultivators scattered immediately, especially the younger ones, who had been itching to explore. Soon, only Zhang Yan and the elder remained. After a brief exchange, Zhang Yan set off on his own.  

---  

Merging into the crowd, Zhang Yan pulled a bamboo hat from his storage pouch and donned it. Then, he equipped the Veiled Mask in his gear slot.  

Now, no one would recognize him.  

Not that it was strictly necessary. This was the Qingheng Market, after all—not only was there a Golden Core elder overseeing it, but patrols of Qingheng disciples constantly roamed the streets. Danger was unlikely.  

In fact, given his status as a Qingheng disciple, others would be lucky if he didn't bully them.  

As he wandered through the bustling streets, Zhang Yan couldn't help but marvel at the sheer size of the Qingheng Market—the only one in the Tianmu Mountain Range. The crowds were massive, and with them came an endless variety of exotic goods.  

Even the Qingheng Sect had set up a procurement station here, a testament to the market's daily yield of rare treasures.  

Along the way, he saw all manner of magic tools, talismans, formations, pills, and even live or slain demonic beasts.  

Unfortunately, none of the magic tools had particularly impressive attributes. He did, however, pick up a few rare spirit herbs to transplant and cultivate later.  

*If only I could open a second-hand magic tool shop here...*  

The thought was tempting, but unrealistic. Every shop in the Qingheng Market was a golden goose—all owned by the Qingheng Sect. Only major families had the privilege of purchasing storefronts from the sect. The rest had to pay exorbitant rents, ranging from several thousand to tens of thousands of spirit stones per year.  

Far beyond his means.  

Besides, the second-hand magic tool trade was treacherous. While he could safely scavenge for gear with useful attributes for personal use, running a dedicated shop would leave him vulnerable to scams and schemes.  

And then there was the matter of the bizarre attributes he kept encountering.  

Some were downright unusable.  

Take **[Fragile]**, for example—equipping this attribute significantly increased the chance of the tool breaking during use. Or **[Prodigious Miner]**, found on a mining pick, which turned the wielder into an unparalleled expert at digging ore.  

Zhang Yan could only sigh. These attributes weren't entirely useless... just useless *to him*.  

After more browsing, he finally spotted something promising—a ring.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Flame Ring  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Green  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Flame Imbuement**: Attacks gain an additional layer of fire damage.  
- **Flame Surge**: Releases a burst of fire in all directions upon activation.  

"Not bad at all."  

The Flame Ring was a mid-grade magic tool, typically worth three to five hundred spirit stones. But since it was second-hand, Zhang Yan managed to haggle it down to 103 spirit stones.  

Fortunately, his time working at the stone-cutting yard had earned him enough contribution points to exchange for over three hundred spirit stones before this trip. The purchase was well within his budget.  

The Flame Ring's base function allowed the instantaneous casting of a **Flame Serpent** spell, with power equivalent to a mid-stage Qi Refining strike—a solid find.  

Pleased with his acquisition, Zhang Yan turned to leave—only for his gaze to lock onto something at a nearby stall.  

A small, unassuming metal fragment.  

But in his eyes, it shimmered with a radiant purple glow.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Tome of Water (Fragment)  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Purple  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Mastery of Water Arts**  
- **Knowledge Inheritance**
