# Chapter 3: Entering the Sect, the Path Between Immortal and Mortal  

Chu Ning peeked ahead in the line and saw a middle-aged man in the robes of the Qingxi Sect standing at the front. His demeanor was gentle, but his deep, ancient eyes seemed to pierce through one’s soul. Despite his warm smile, there was an unspoken authority that made it hard to meet his gaze.  

Holding a testing jade pillar, the man addressed the first person in line:  

"Place your hand here."  

The person complied, but the jade pillar remained unchanged.  

"No spiritual root," the man declared.  

The hopeful candidate walked away, crestfallen.  

"No spiritual root."  

"No spiritual root."  

...  

Nearly ten people were tested in succession, all with the same result.  

*It seems those with spiritual roots are truly rare,* Chu Ning mused. The number of people gathered in Qingxi City for the test was already a tiny fraction of the population, and now, not even one in ten had shown any aptitude.  

This meant that those capable of cultivation were truly one in ten thousand.  

The eleventh candidate stepped forward. When their hand touched the jade pillar, five colors shimmered to life.  

"Five-element pseudo-spiritual root. Barely passable for cultivation," the middle-aged man remarked indifferently.  

The candidate, however, was overjoyed. Most of the onlookers, aside from a few, gazed at them with envy.  

Chu Ning had learned much during his time here. In this world of cultivation, single-attribute spiritual roots were called "Heavenly Spiritual Roots," dual-attribute ones "Earthly Spiritual Roots," and triple-attribute ones "True Spiritual Roots."  

All three types allowed for rapid cultivation, with Heavenly Spiritual Roots being the fastest.  

Four- and five-attribute spiritual roots, however, were labeled "pseudo-spiritual roots," resulting in sluggish progress.  

Sects typically focused their resources on nurturing those with three or fewer spiritual roots, while pseudo-spiritual root holders were often relegated to menial tasks—farming, tending spirit beasts, mining—as outer disciples.  

Of course, major sects had even stricter requirements.  

Yet, even as outer disciples, these individuals had already transcended the mortal realm. With enough effort, they might one day advance to inner disciple status.  

Occasionally, some even ascended further through sheer luck or perseverance.  

Thus, despite the label of "pseudo-spiritual root," envy still burned in the eyes of many.  

The testing continued. Seven more candidates were rejected before it was finally Chu Ning’s turn.  

Standing before the jade pillar, he studied it curiously.  

"Place your hand here," the middle-aged man instructed.  

Chu Ning complied, pressing his palm into the indentation.  

The pillar soon glowed with four distinct hues—azure, white, red, and yellow.  

"Wood, water, fire, earth—four-element pseudo-spiritual root," the man announced flatly.  

Whispers and envious stares followed. Among the nineteen tested so far, Chu Ning had the highest aptitude, even if it was still a pseudo-spiritual root.  

Internally, however, Chu Ning was unsettled.  

*Four colors mean four spiritual roots. The azure must represent wood. But why does it seem brighter than the others? Could it be because of my Yin Wood Spirit Body?*  

Though the thought crossed his mind, he kept it to himself. After thanking the examiner, he joined the group of successful candidates.  

Over the past days, he had heard much about spiritual roots but nothing about spirit bodies.  

*Spirit bodies must be incredibly rare. Whether mine is unique or not, it’s best not to reveal it prematurely.*  

Caution was paramount in a world where trust was scarce. Survival meant staying low-key and vigilant.  

Testing dragged on well into noon. The biggest stir came when someone was revealed to possess a dual-attribute Earthly Spiritual Root—an exceedingly rare occurrence. True Spiritual Roots numbered only a dozen or so, while pseudo-spiritual roots like Chu Ning’s made up the rest.  

"The Qingxi Sect’s selection has concluded. The next will be held in three years."  

The announcement echoed across the square.  

Under the envious gazes of the crowd, Chu Ning and the other successful candidates boarded several spirit boats, which then soared into the sky, vanishing in the blink of an eye.  

Those left behind stared longingly at the heavens, knowing that from this day forth, their paths had diverged—immortal and mortal, never to cross again.  

...  

*This must be a magical artifact. Cultivation truly is wondrous!*  

Chu Ning marveled at the experience, so different from flying in his past life. The robed elder standing at the bow of the spirit boat filled him with excitement and anticipation.  

The other youths shared his exhilaration.  

A journey of a hundred miles passed in an instant.  

The middle-aged examiner guided the spirit boat to a cluster of buildings at the foot of a mountain range.  

A short, bearded man in his forties emerged and approached with deference.  

"Elder Chen!"  

Elder Chen nodded. "Steward He, these are the pseudo-spiritual root disciples. They’ll start in the Hundred Arts Hall. Nurture any promising ones."  

Without waiting for a response, he turned to the newcomers.  

"This is Steward He Changyou of the Hundred Arts Hall. He will assign you tasks as outer disciples. The sect will provide basic cultivation techniques. Do not belittle yourselves or slack off. Work hard, and one day, you may join the sect properly and tread the great path."  

"Yes!" Chu Ning and the others chorused.  

Elder Chen handed a jade slip to He Changyou, then departed on the wind, vanishing swiftly.  

Once he was gone, He Changyou straightened, his demeanor shifting to one of authority.  

"Now, you’ll be assigned to different divisions—kitchens, spirit beast care, spirit plant cultivation, and so on. Each has its own duties and cultivation methods."  

Chu Ning perked up. For him, a division focusing on wood-attribute techniques would be ideal.  

But he wondered—how would the assignments be decided?
