# Chapter 55: Mulberries (Seeking Monthly Tickets)

Early morning, beneath the mulberry tree.

Zhou Qing gazed at a mulberry fruit the size of a pigeon's egg hanging from a drooping branch before his eyes. This must be the crystallization formed after the ghostly creature that broke into the courtyard last night was dealt with by the great mulberry tree?

Since he had moved into this courtyard, the mulberry tree had never borne fruit again. This was the first time.

Truth be told, it was his own lack of knowledge. Only after chatting with the village elder Hu Youtian during a visit to Zhou Village did he learn that mulberry trees have male and female distinctions. The fruit-bearing ones are female, while the non-fruit-bearing ones are male.

But he had grown accustomed to calling it "Brother Mulberry" and couldn't be bothered to change. After all, why bother with gender distinctions for a tree? Even if this particular tree was a bit... unusual.

So far, he had killed quite a few people, but only Squire Zhang had turned into a ghost. There must be some reason behind this. Excluding that fool Zhang Shen, people like the Chen Hu brothers, the monk, and the two martial bandits—all stronger than ordinary folk—hadn't turned into ghosts after death or caused him any trouble.

Only Squire Zhang, whom he had indirectly caused the death of, had returned as a ghost seeking revenge. Though he hadn't feared the man in life, let alone as a ghostly nuisance. Still, he was curious about the reason. But this was truly beyond his current knowledge, and he couldn't figure it out for now.

Last night's ghost was the second. From its shape, it appeared to be a fox—but was it the same one he and Fu Song had just killed, or a companion? Moreover, Fu Song had been the one to strike the deadliest blows and dismember the corpse. Why had the ghost come for him instead? Did it think a mere scholar would be easier to bully than a Daoist priest like Fu Song? Or was it after the white fox pelt in the courtyard?

Fu Song had done an excellent job skinning the fox, leaving the pelt intact. Zhou Qing planned to prepare it properly as a gift for Xiao Ruowang's ordination ceremony at Mount Taihe—a token of friendship.

As he pondered, his hand unconsciously touched the newly formed mulberry fruit. Something strange happened: the pigeon-egg-sized fruit suddenly dissolved into a cool, shadowy energy that seeped into his body.

"Is the mulberry tree harming me?"

"No—it's the Nourishing Life Master."

The Nourishing Life Master absorbed the mulberry fruit, undergoing subtle changes. For instance, the faint, transparent script indicating "Literary Fortitude (Beginner)"—which had helped him break through to "Ape Play (Proficient)"—now appeared fuller and more solid. At the same time, he could perceive finer details about his progress from the Nourishing Life Master's evaluations.

Previously, he had relied on experience and the richness of the script to gauge his progress. Now, focusing on the evaluation itself, he could sense even more nuanced details.

In short, his perception had become more refined. Concentrating on the evaluation provided more detailed feedback.

Had the Nourishing Life Master absorbed the ghost's spiritual energy? Its soul force?

Zhou Qing made this judgment as fragmented memories flooded his mind. He sifted through them like flipping through pages of a book.

From this, he learned the backstory of the fox ghost and gleaned some information about the deep mountains.

The ghost fox had originally been a powerful creature—almost a full-fledged demon beast—that absorbed the essence of the sun and moon in the remote mountains, nearly forming an inner core. But one day, deep in the forest, it encountered a deranged Daoist priest who beat it to death. Its spirit escaped, possessing another white fox that had just awakened its intelligence.

It absorbed most of the white fox's vital energy, which was why the meat Zhou Qing had eaten wasn't as potent as expected. The ghost fox had also commanded the white fox to capture hunters venturing into the mountains, using them to replenish its own demonic soul with their flesh and blood.

Humans, as the pinnacle of all living beings, seemed to possess something special in the eyes of the ghost fox.

Later, as hunters avoided the white fox's territory, the ghost fox grew increasingly agitated from lack of prey. It sent the white fox down the mountain to hunt, leading to the disappearance of the night watchman in the earthen hut.

But this time, the white fox had run into an immovable obstacle.

After sensing the white fox's demise, the ghost fox came at night to retrieve the pelt and seek revenge. The pelt was useful—it could temporarily manifest a physical form and slow the dissipation of its demonic soul...

However, having been without a physical body for so long, the ghost fox's mind had deteriorated, growing more violent. Had Zhou Qing and the others not intervened, it would have soon caused greater havoc.

From the ghost fox's fragmented memories, Zhou Qing learned about other demonic creatures. But the ghost fox itself had cultivated purely on instinct, knowing little about the deeper aspects of cultivation. Based on the memories, Zhou Qing deduced that the deranged Daoist priest was likely the missing Fu Shan.

That had happened over two years ago.

Additionally, Zhou Qing discovered something thrilling: "A seven-leaf ginseng, on the verge of sprouting an eighth leaf, guarded by a giant serpent."

This news excited him. However, since the serpent hadn't eaten the ginseng yet, it was likely waiting for the eighth leaf to emerge. Zhou Qing wondered if it was too late to seek it out now. What if the serpent had already consumed it?

Then again, eating the serpent might be an excellent alternative.

The ghost fox had never dared provoke the serpent in life. But in its memories, the deranged priest had been far more terrifying. The priest's attacks always struck its weak points while evading its counterattacks, leaving it deeply traumatized.

"This seven-leaf ginseng requires careful planning," Zhou Qing resolved.

Without resources, progress in cultivation was painfully slow. His "Ape Play" technique had encountered five major hurdles when advancing from "Skilled" to "Proficient." Two of these he overcame through sheer willpower and effort, while the remaining three relied on Heart-Nourishing Pills.

These pills worked primarily because they were specially formulated for the heart and contained some unique energy from Xiao Ruowang's cultivation. Such luck was rare. With greater challenges ahead, the pills would likely be far less effective.

He couldn't very well resort to some demonic absorption technique.

As he pondered, Zhou Qing considered the mulberries the great tree had borne. Were they, like the rooster's offerings, tributes to him?

Most likely. After all, the tree lived on his property, and he often gave it full-body massages. It was only right for the tree to offer tribute.

The mulberries must have been refined from soul energy before being absorbed by the Nourishing Life Master, which in turn underwent changes and replenished the spiritual essence needed for his Literary Fortitude.

From the evaluation, Zhou Qing also learned that while Literary Fortitude required spiritual or purified soul energy to sustain itself, advancing from Beginner to Intermediate demanded his own efforts—it wasn't as simple as absorbing energy.

This incident had brought him significant gains. First, he discovered the mulberry tree's ability to refine soul energy into fruit, benefiting him greatly. Second, he gained clarity on many matters and learned about the seven-leaf ginseng.

He needed to retrieve the ginseng as soon as possible. If the serpent consumed it, who knew what terrifying changes might follow?

With winter approaching, the mountains would grow colder. Serpents typically hibernate, gorging themselves beforehand and becoming sluggish. Ginseng growth would also slow in the cold, so if the seven-leaf ginseng still existed, the eighth leaf would likely emerge in spring.

If, unfortunately, the eighth leaf had already sprouted and the serpent had eaten it, Zhou Qing would have to hunt the serpent down. But a serpent that had consumed an eight-leaf ginseng might be beyond his capabilities.

Fortunately, winter would weaken the serpent's mobility. For this venture, he would need Fu Song—and the rooster.

The rooster should have a natural advantage against serpents, but its effectiveness against a giant one was uncertain. Additionally, his "Bird Play" technique, applied to swordsmanship, might offer some edge.

This would be a serpent-hunting expedition, requiring meticulous planning—consulting seasoned hunters about serpent weaknesses and preparing thoroughly.

This opportunity, including the ghost fox, was indirectly linked to the missing Fu Shan. If Fu Shan hadn't killed the ghost fox, Zhou Qing wouldn't have reaped these benefits or learned of the ginseng.

The best outcome would be retrieving the seven-leaf ginseng without confronting the serpent. After all, the creature was the mountain's undisputed ruler—not to be trifled with.

After organizing his thoughts, Zhou Qing thanked the mulberry tree and went up the mountain to see Fu Song.

"Junior Brother, you're saying you have news about Senior Brother Fu Shan?" Fu Song's eyes widened in excitement. "Where is his body?"

Zhou Qing rolled his eyes before recounting the general details—omitting the source—about the sighting two years ago and the seven-leaf ginseng.

Fu Song was slightly disappointed but visibly downcast. It wasn't that he stood to gain nothing if Fu Shan were dead—quite the opposite. Zhou Qing knew Fu Song was all bark, greedy but harmless. Otherwise, he wouldn't have accompanied Zhou Qing to Jiangzhou, turned a blind eye to Zhang Shen's assassination, or genuinely celebrated Zhou Qing's success—even ripping off the inn's back door in excitement.

When it came to night watch duty, Fu Song had grumbled but stayed vigilant, striking the white fox faster than Zhou Qing.

"Junior Brother, you plan to harvest the seven-leaf ginseng?"

"Exactly."

"Seven-leaf ginseng is legendary—I never thought it truly existed. But such spiritual herbs are always guarded by beasts, especially if it's nearing eight leaves. The creature wouldn't devour it prematurely."

"Senior Brother is absolutely right."

Zhou Qing briefly mentioned the giant serpent, though his knowledge was limited.

Fu Song couldn't help but marvel at Zhou Qing's luck. In his decades, Fu Shan had never encountered such a treasure, yet Zhou Qing now had the chance.

"Junior Brother, you're still planning to refine it into Blood Qi Pills, right? Save one for me. The last batch from the six-leaf ginseng was so small I barely tasted it."

"Senior Brother, I didn't skimp. Don't think I didn't notice you pocketed one meant for Abbot Xiao."

Fu Song's face reddened. This brat was too sharp. Had Xiao Ruowang told him?

He wanted the pill not just out of curiosity but to attempt the final stance of the Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm—"Leaderless Dragons." This move, meant to fend off multiple foes, demanded immense blood qi. Without a stronger pill, he couldn't execute it properly.

Forcing it through secret techniques would severely damage his vitality—a last resort.

After discussing plans with Fu Song, Zhou Qing consulted a snake-hunting expert provided by Butcher Hu, studying serpent behavior and weaknesses. He even practiced on ordinary snakes.

The venom from the green snake the rooster had caught earlier was unusually potent and long-lasting—Zhou Qing planned to use it. He had also tasked some alchemy-inclined disciples at Qingfu Temple with extracting toxins from minerals, providing antidote methods from the Herbalism Manual as safeguards.

These disciples, in their late teens or twenties, were mature enough for such tasks. Nurturing such talents was essential—alchemy was tedious, and having assistants for groundwork would save him effort. Qingfu Temple didn't just teach civil exams; it fostered diverse skills, producing well-rounded adepts to strengthen the temple's influence.

After all, in this era, priests and monks needed expertise to spread their teachings effectively.

Teahouse.

"What? You're going herb-gathering in the mountains?" Miss Lin was shocked. To her, it seemed perilous.

"Senior Brother Fu Song will accompany me, and I've made preparations. But..." Zhou Qing trailed off. There was always some risk. Yet seven-leaf ginseng was nearly mythical—missing this chance might mean never finding another. Even then, success wasn't guaranteed.

But not trying meant no chance at all.

Miss Lin sighed. "I know you're cautious—you wouldn't go unless necessary. Ordinary herbs wouldn't require your personal involvement, so this must be significant. How can I help?"

Worried as she was, she trusted Zhou Qing's judgment. If he deemed it essential,劝阻 was pointless. The question was how she could assist.

Zhou Qing was the Lin family's pillar now. For both practical and personal reasons, she couldn't afford to lose him.

"The herb gathering is manageable. But I need you to handle household matters—I trust no one else."

At "household matters," Miss Lin blushed.

Zhou Qing smiled. "I'm unmarried, and given our relationship, you managing my affairs is natural. I'm not ready for marriage yet—there are unresolved matters, concerns for both of us. Once settled, we can be together. And I won't allow you to marry anyone else."

Their bond, whether by interest or affection, was inevitable. Miss Lin was the right match for now.

He couldn't let her marry another—Lin Tai understood this. How else would their alliance hold? How could Zhou Qing rest easy? Emotionally, he couldn't accept it either.

But before thirty, his martial cultivation took priority. Fu Shan's notes mentioned that a pure yang body enhanced training—unless paired with a suitable dual-cultivation technique.

Qingfu Temple lacked such methods. Thus, Zhou Qing intended to find one before marriage. It might even aid his breakthroughs.

At seventeen, with Miss Lin at nineteen, they could wait. In this world, nineteen was considered old for a woman, but Zhou Qing's past self had just started university at that age.

Early childbirth was risky in ancient times, but Miss Lin's martial training mitigated that. The key was securing a dual-cultivation method.

Additionally, the "Evergreen Manual" mentioned a rare Elixir of Eternal Beauty—difficult to refine but coveted by women. Zhou Qing saw its potential: a perfect courtship gift and lucrative trade item. Unlike Blood Qi Pills, which could empower enemies, beauty elixirs were harmless profit.

But the key ingredient had to be freshly picked, lasting only a day. He'd need luck to find it in the mountains.

Touched, Miss Lin replied, "I don't need marriage—just a child with you. I don't want to give up my business."

As a merchant's daughter, being a scholar's wife would constrain her. As a concubine, she'd face oppression. Zhou Qing's offer moved her, but she cherished her independence.

Surprised, Zhou Qing accepted her terms. Besides her, he had no intention of marrying anyone else—trust and affection were hard-won.

Thus settled, they agreed to delay consummation until finding a dual-cultivation method. For now, Zhou Qing tasked Miss Lin with guarding the courtyard during his absence. The mulberry tree, having absorbed the ghost fox's essence, might manifest strange phenomena without him around.

Though harmless to him, the tree could be terrifying to others.

Over the next twenty days, Zhou Qing finalized preparations. Though eager, he couldn't rush. The eighth ginseng leaf would've emerged by spring if not already.

At Qingfu Temple, he met Fu Song as the first winter snow began—light as willow catkins, then heavy as goose feathers.

Zhou Qing smiled. The timing was perfect.

Time to depart!
