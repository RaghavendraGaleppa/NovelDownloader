# Chapter 91: Gains and Aftermath

"Four Grandmasters?" The streets and alleys of the capital buzzed with discussion.

In a single night, the imperial family and imperial guards were nearly wiped out. The surviving palace maids and eunuchs spread the news, shaking the entire capital to its core.

With spring thunder, heavy rain, and the pitch-black night as cover, coupled with the palace's complex terrain, its defenses were like weeds in the eyes of Grandmaster-level experts.

Most importantly, it wasn't two but four Grandmasters.

This shattered everyone's understanding in the capital.

Previously, the presence of a single Grandmaster Ancestor in the palace had already made them realize how terrifying existence beyond mortal limits could be. Now, four such beings had appeared simultaneously.

Four Grandmasters, moving unseen and unheard, killing without restraint—this was something no ordinary mortal force could stop.

Some survivors claimed they saw the young Grandmaster from Jiangzhou executing heavenly punishment, striking the emperor dead with five thunderbolts.

Like a god descended to earth.

In any case, the near-total annihilation of the imperial family and imperial guards marked the complete downfall of this decaying dynasty.

"The Great Zhou has fallen." Teahouses and taverns were filled with confusion and sorrow. Many didn't know where to go, but even more felt a sense of relief.

The Great Zhou had been beyond saving for a long time.

It had only been kept alive by the forced efforts of the Profound Yin Ancestor.

With the event so fresh, most people were still in shock. The remaining nobles and officials didn't dare enter the imperial city.

After killing the emperor, Zhou Qing rescued Lu Fengxian's only son and entrusted him to Zhishan's care. He then ordered the palace maids and eunuchs to bury the imperial guards' bodies where they fell before eventually dismissing all palace servants.

The rain continued relentlessly, occasionally punctuated by thunder.

The four gathered in the great hall.

Fushan and Fusong had temporarily fallen into slumber, with the old eunuch's corpse nearby.

"I never imagined we'd actually succeed—completely piercing the heart of the Great Zhou and ushering in a new era, the Mythic Era!" Despite years of tempering his spirit with sun and moon energy, Zhang Jingxiu couldn't help but feel excited.

He clearly understood they were witnessing the dawn of a new age.

Like myths coming to life.

Previously, calling themselves "martial myths" had been somewhat joking.

Now, the Mythic Era had truly arrived.

"The outcome was inevitable with the four of us working together." Zhou Qing recited the Heart-Cleansing Mantra. After the emperor and old eunuch died, both had transformed into malevolent ghosts, which Zhou Qing dispersed with palm thunder, annihilating their souls!

Having absorbed the demon tree's yin energy and baleful aura the previous day, followed by a bout of violent slaughter, Zhou Qing had actually shown signs of demonic possession.

Fortunately, after handling the aftermath, he promptly recited the Heart-Cleansing Mantra using ventriloquism.

The Daoist tones of purity and non-action echoed through the hall, reminiscent of the Salvation Deity redeeming the netherworld.

"What should we do next? If you want to overthrow the heavens and replace the earth, become emperor—I'll support you," Zhang Jingxiu said.

Zhou Qing shook his head. "Human hearts cannot be controlled. We can spread martial arts throughout the land, but we cannot make everyone sincerely submit. Moreover, seeking the Dao isn't about enslaving others but liberating oneself."

"Using the ninth line: Seeing dragons without heads, auspicious," Fusong opened his eyes. His cultivation was lower, so even after stimulating his qi and blood to temporarily boost his spirit, the toll wasn't severe.

"Junior Brother, I don't support you becoming emperor," he said after quoting the hexagram, addressing Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing nodded: "Exactly, that was my intention all along. Our greatest enemies were never the emperor or the old eunuch, but..." He paused, pointing toward the demon tree, "them."

Zhou Qing had long since mentioned the matter of demons.

Now that they'd seen the demon tree, they were even more convinced of his judgment.

Zhang Jingxiu: "This is indeed the greatest scourge in the world. If such a demon were allowed to grow unchecked, even the four of us working together might not be able to stop it eventually."

"Not might—we definitely wouldn't be able to."

Zhou Qing understood clearly. Though he had means like palm thunder to counter demons, if a demon grew to an unimaginably powerful level, these methods would become meaningless.

Most terrifying was that demons could continuously grow by devouring flesh and blood, with no visible limit to their growth.

"In that case, isn't the great pine tree at Taihe Mountain very dangerous? Should I return and cut it down?"

Zhou Qing shook his head. "As long as we're careful to prevent it from coming into contact with flesh and blood, it's fine. There are demons elsewhere in the world. With you guarding it, we can eliminate it anytime. Later, I'll send Mingyue to Taihe Mountain to set up a spirit-gathering array centered on the great pine tree. If you hunt a demon beast and obtain its inner core as the array's eye, we can establish a medicinal garden and allow disciples to cultivate there."

Zhang Jingxiu already knew the benefits of spirit-gathering arrays and was naturally pleased with this arrangement.

Activating the array required true qi, and an inner core would enhance its effects. Spirit stones would be best, but they hadn't found any yet.

"Junior Brother, your magnanimity is a great blessing for all under heaven," Fushan said, having woken at some point. After this brief adjustment, he would need to enter a prolonged state of madness to slowly recover.

Then he could attempt to cultivate the Formless Mind Technique obtained from the old eunuch.

However, the Formless Mind Technique was extremely abstruse and required Zhou Qing to decipher it first before they could truly comprehend it.

Using thunderous momentum to shatter the heart of the decaying Great Zhou imperial family was an act of霹雳手段 (violent means), but violent means alone couldn't truly win hearts.

---

Of course, if Zhou Qing wanted to become emperor, they wouldn't stop him.

Zhou Qing concluded that the demon tree's yin and baleful energy were far more severe than the great pine tree's, making it completely unsuitable for cultivation. Moreover, its demonic nature was hard to eliminate.

Even after repeatedly "persuading" it with palm thunder, its demonic nature remained untamed.

However, using the demon tree as a target had made Zhou Qing increasingly adept at controlling palm thunder, reaching a proficient level.

Further improvement was now limited by his true qi.

Zhou Qing also sensed that palm thunder could advance further.

After discussing palm thunder's intricacies with Zhang Jingxiu, Fushan, and Fusong, they unanimously concluded that higher-level cultivation methods for palm thunder should be found in Master Jingyang's cave dwelling.

After all, palm thunder originally derived from the Six-Word Health Preservation Technique and Zhou Qing's own Five Animal Exercises.

"Since its demonic nature can't be eliminated, we'll liberate it."

The four made their decision—demons truly couldn't be reasoned with or persuaded.

"The Great Zhou has fallen?" The leader of the Anping Dao received the news with mixed feelings.

Zhou Qing smiled slightly: "Fellow Daoist Tang, first tell me where that beast hide is."

"In the hands of the Grassland Martial Sage."

"I see. Thank you for telling me. Actually, since the Great Zhou has fallen, you could start over completely. No matter how good the outside world is, with your current strength, I don't think you could establish yourself there."

During their conversation, Zhou Qing recognized Tang Feng's great talent in deciphering ancient texts and wanted to recruit such a capable person.

His energy was limited, and having someone like Tang Feng to help decode many mysterious ancient texts would benefit both him and the entire Daoist court.

Talents like Tang Feng were rare.

Translating cultivation-related ancient texts required extensive knowledge and some cultivation insight to correctly interpret deeper meanings.

Tang Feng seemed hesitant.

"Fellow Daoist Tang dared to come see me in the imperial city, proving you've already disregarded life and death. What else worries you?"

"I'm not afraid of death, but I know too little about you, Grandmaster Zhou. If you permit, please give me some time to consider."

"Of course. You can come find me anytime you decide. However, merely knowing the location of one beast hide isn't enough for me to take you beyond this realm in search of immortal fates. But even if you don't join us, there will be other opportunities to gain our assistance in the future."

Zhou Qing saw Tang Feng off with great courtesy.

The imperial city was under constant scrutiny day and night. Tang Feng, as the first to "eat the crab," caused quite a stir.

This served as a signal, demonstrating the goodwill of the four Grandmasters in the imperial city.

Now dubbed the Four Great Dao Lords by enthusiasts, debates raged about who ranked first. Some said Zhou Qing, having slain the emperor, was indisputably number one.

Others claimed the Profound Yin Ancestor might have been killed by Zhang Jingxiu, making him the world's foremost.

Some insisted the Ancestor fell to the combined efforts of all four.

A few even said Zhou Qing alone beat the Ancestor to death—the least credible claim that failed to convince many.

Regarding Zhou Qing executing the emperor, many eunuchs and maids swore he acted as heaven's agent, appearing like the Thunder Deity incarnate.

Many of these servants had received Zhou Qing's kindness—he distributed treasures and food to them.

Otherwise, he couldn't have so quickly uncovered the palace's many hidden secrets.

But when they asked to stay and serve him, Zhou Qing firmly refused. He didn't want the imperial city's situation to become complicated. With only their small group present, any outsider could be easily identified without expending effort to distinguish friend from foe.

Thus, time passed until late February, when spring gradually arrived.

"Junior Brother, without your help deciphering the Formless Mind Technique, who knows how long it would've taken us to cross this threshold." Fushan bowed to Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing sidestepped the gesture, smiling: "Eldest Brother, you're too kind. This was my duty. Although you've started learning the technique, having begun so late, you'll mostly need to remain in a void-like state to replenish your soul's losses. So Zhishan will still need to care for you regularly."

Fushan said: "It's both care and restraint. Otherwise, in that state, instinctive actions might cause damage."

"Exactly. The Formless Mind Technique includes a Heart-Cleansing Tune. Unless you brothers wake voluntarily, if I need to consult you, I'll play it on a flute to rouse you."

The tune was a method from the technique to awaken consciousness and resist inner demons.

It required spirit sense at least at the fifth layer of qi refinement—which Zhou Qing happened to possess.

After completing the Evergreen Immortality Technique, it became a comprehensive qi refinement method. The ancient Formless Mind Technique scripture also contained content about refining and controlling magical instruments with spirit sense.

Without someone as erudite and among the world's top cultivators as Zhou Qing, fully deciphering its contents would've been extremely difficult.

Moreover, without pairing it with the Evergreen Immortality Technique, the Formless Mind Technique yielded half the results for double the effort—especially before achieving spirit sense, its effects were inferior to the Daoist Heart-Cleansing Mantra.

However, the technique had a subtle influence. Practicing it before the mantra induced a serene, ethereal sensation, aligning one's spirit more closely with Daoist principles.

This naturally led to detachment from worldly fame and wealth.

It was meant to strengthen Daoist resolve.

The great Dao was hard to attain. Obsession with worldly gains and power could easily lead one astray.

This was the original intent behind the technique's creator.

Zhou Qing maintained a natural mindset, understanding that for cultivators, power fundamentally stemmed from personal strength and cultivation.

True might resided within, requiring no external validation.

Had Zhou Qing taken the imperial exams normally, becoming a top scholar and wielding great influence would've taken at least twenty years. But achieving Grandmaster status with three elder brothers' help allowed him to decapitate the Great Zhou imperial family directly.

Simple, straightforward, effective.

The most direct way to seize power was often the simplest.

With Fushan's issues largely resolved, the four gathered by the demon tree.

Lately, Zhou Qing had frequently used the tree as target practice for palm thunder while studying how its yin and baleful energy differed from the great mulberry's.

He concluded the demon tree's energies were far more severe and unsuitable for cultivation, its demonic nature unyielding.

Even after repeated "persuasion" via palm thunder, it remained untamed.

However, using it as a target had honed Zhou Qing's palm thunder control to proficiency.

Further improvement was now limited by his true qi.

He also sensed palm thunder could advance further.

After discussions, they agreed higher-level methods likely existed in Master Jingyang's cave.

After all, palm thunder originated from the Six-Word Technique and Zhou Qing's Five Animal Exercises.

"Since its demonic nature can't be eliminated, we'll liberate it."

The four decided—demons truly couldn't be reasoned with.
