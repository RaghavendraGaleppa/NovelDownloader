# Chapter 377: Invincible Under Heaven

That was the island protection formation "Upper Goodness Like Water Realm," condensed from water-attribute true qi. The spiritual energy within this realm was exceptionally abundant, far surpassing that of the mainland, more than enough to sustain a grand array.

Xu Yunfan rode the waves, the Weak Water parting automatically beneath his feet. When the toxic mist touched the dragon scale armor around his body, it let out hissing sounds, then melted away like snow meeting the blazing sun.

The beautiful matron in charge of the Penglai Pavilion stood atop the highest Tide Listening Pavilion. With a casual lift of her fair hand, the entire sea region suddenly boiled.

"Must Young Hero Xu be so merciless?"

The matron raised her fair hand, a blue halo shimmering around her body, her voice rising and falling like the tides. "Young Hero Xu, my Penglai Pavilion is willing to offer three斛 of Weak Water Essence, ten cubic feet of Thousand Year Black Ice Jade Marrow, and additionally present our sect founder's遗留 Eight Rank Divine Weapon, the Abyssal Water-Splitting Thorn. This is a supreme treasure once wielded by a Land Immortal Realm senior to roam the four seas, taken from an Outer Realm Demon, with marvelous effects."

Her eyes shimmered with water light, her sleeves drooping low. "Can today's matter be resolved peacefully?"

Her words had yet to fade when the entire Penglai Island violently trembled.

Seventy-two Black Iron Array Pillars rose from the seabed. The Zhou Tian Water Element Grand Array operated at full power, and immediately wind and thunder stirred between the sea and sky.

A hundred-zhang tall dark blue tsunami, like the collapse of a sky curtain, appeared. Within the wave peaks, vast water-attribute true qi was faintly visible.

The towering waves suddenly split in mid-air, transforming into nine fierce, scaled Black Water Dragons. Each dragon scale was condensed from water-attribute true qi compressed to the extreme. Dragon claws entwined with Weak Water toxic mist. This was the supreme realm of the sect-defining ultimate technique, "Nine Dragons Stirring the Sea."

Xu Yunfan saw it clearly. No wonder the Penglai Pavilion had been willing to hide on this island for a thousand years. The spiritual energy on Penglai Island was so abundant that even the ancient array布置 was operating normally.

"It's a pity. If your Penglai Pavilion's founder were controlling this array, I would turn around and leave without a word," Xu Yunfan sneered, saying no more. The Ten Extremities True Qi exploded beneath his feet, creating a circle of golden ripples. Instantly, the Weak Water reversed, revealing the bottom of the sea and the layers of white bones deposited over a thousand years.

These were the remains of martial artists who had trespassed on Penglai over the past century.

The matron's pupils constricted upon seeing this. The talismans in her hand all shattered. The nine dragons roared in unison and dove to kill!

Xu Yunfan swung his hammer toward the sea surface. The thousand-jun force of the blow stirred up a hundred-zhang tsunami, and the water dragon vortex was forcibly scattered.

The matron spat blood and flew backward, the island's foundation beginning to collapse.

The sea surface exploded with a roar, and a colossal creature broke through the waves. It was the Sea-Calming Beast raised by the Penglai Pavilion, now completely revealing its true demonic form.

This deep-sea demon stood three zhang tall, its entire body covered in blue-black scales, each gleaming with a cold luster and edges sharp as blades. Its head resembled a dragon but not a dragon, with three twisted bone horns on its forehead. Six gill slits split open at its jaw, spraying foul toxic mist with every breath.

Below its thick neck, four deformed claws opened ferociously, webbing connecting the fingers, and the claw tips dripping corrosive, dark green liquid.

Most terrifying was its giant tail covered in barbs, which stirred up foul waves with every sweep.

"Roar!"

The demon let out an earth-shaking roar, charging to kill amidst a storm of foul wind and blood.

Xu Yunfan didn't even lift an eyelid. His right hand shot out like lightning, precisely grabbing the thick throat covered in scales.

"Splat!"

The Ten Extremities True Qi poured into the demon's seven orifices through his five fingers, and the demon's scales instantly cracked.

Its massive body rapidly inflated like an air-filled leather bag. Under the blue-black skin, the frantic flow of golden true qi was clearly visible. The demon's eyes bulged, its bone horns snapped...

"Boom!"

A mist of blood exploded, mixing shattered flesh and bone with toxic blood that splashed onto the sea surface, dyeing the surrounding hundred-zhang of sea a dark green.

Xu Yunfan shook the sticky demon blood from his hand, looking coldly as the half-severed, still twitching giant tail sank into the seabed.

The Pavilion Head let out a sharp cry. Nine pitch-black, icy Black Iron chains shot out from her sleeves. This was the Penglai Pavilion's sect-defining divine weapon, the Nine Nether Cold Iron Chains.

The chains, like venomous dragons emerging from their den, instantly wrapped around Xu Yunfan's feet. The piercing cold actually froze the surrounding seawater into solid ice.

"Crack!"

Xu Yunfan's toes trembled. The Ten Extremities True Qi erupted like a volcano, and the Cold Iron Chains snapped with a sound.

The fragments flew back like rain, instantly piercing the Pavilion Head's chest, blood spurting three zhang high.

As the Pavilion Head stumbled to her knees, coughing blood, five withered figures suddenly lunged from the shadows of the shattered palace pillars. They were the Penglai Pavilion's Supreme Elders, who had been in seclusion for many years.

They had lain in wait for a long time. The water-attribute true qi and Weak Water toxic mist around their bodies blended perfectly, even their breathing and heartbeats reduced to the state of turtle breathing. Now, like venomous snakes leaving their holes, five Water-Splitting Thorns coated in Weak Water poison aimed for the vital points of Xu Yunfan's back.

"Sss!"

When the cold light was only three inches from Xu Yunfan's back, the Ten Extremities True Qi behind him suddenly boiled, condensing into a solid form like molten gold.

A golden qi wall appeared out of thin air, forcibly blocking the fatal edge of the five Water-Splitting Thorns. The poison blades collided with the qi wall, letting out a harsh metal scraping sound, and sparks flew.

The five elders were greatly shocked. Their "Turtle Breathing Concealment Technique," which they had cultivated for a hundred years, had been seen through at a glance!

What was even more terrifying was that the golden qi wall not only blocked the attack but also transmitted a counter-suction force. The Weak Water poison refined on the Water-Splitting Thorns was being assimilated and absorbed by the Ten Extremities True Qi at a visible speed.

"This... this is definitely not the手段 of the Nine Martial Dao Realms!"

The leading elder's throat moved. His withered wrist had already been cracked by the rebounding force.

The Way of "Upper Goodness Like Water, Using Soft to Overcome Hard," which they had devoted their lives to believing in, seemed so ridiculous in the face of such absolute power.

Xu Yunfan suddenly turned his head and grinned. "A bunch of old turtles, finally willing to show your heads?"

The Martial Dao Sky Eye at his brow suddenly cracked open a sliver. The attack trajectories of the five elders became crystal clear.

Xu Yunfan's body didn't move. Behind him, a Martial Dao Avatar took shape, and five golden arms condensed from true qi suddenly reached out.

"Martial Dao Avatar?!"

The Supreme Elders were shaken. They naturally recognized that it was similar to the Dragon-Tiger Heavenly尊 once condensed by the Xuanzhen Sect, but compared to its solidity, it was simply incomparable to what Xu Yunfan could achieve.

Five arms, like hunting dragons, precisely grabbed their throats.

Five fingers, like hooks, clamped down on their crowns. The Ten Extremities True Qi transformed into a Gluttonous giant mouth.

"Argh!"

The five Grandmasters of the Ninth Realm hadn't even made their move before their entire true qi, like a bursting dam, was pulled away.

In the blink of an eye, five dried corpses fell with a thud. A sea breeze blew, and they actually turned to dust and drifted away.

Xu Yunfan lowered his hand, stepped over the dust on the ground, and slowly walked toward the dying Pavilion Head of Penglai.

The Pavilion Head collapsed beside the shattered Black Iron chains. The wound piercing her chest cavity oozed blood continuously, her originally dignified face now as withered as paper.

Seeing Xu Yunfan approach, she tremblingly raised her blood-stained fingers. Through parted lips and teeth, she squeezed out a pleading voice as thin as a thread of silk. "Spare... spare my life... Penglai Pavilion's thousand years..."

Her words were yet to finish when Xu Yunfan reached out and grabbed her crown.

The Ten Extremities True Qi, like a venomous serpent,钻入 her seven orifices. The Pavilion Head's entire body trembled violently. In her pupils was reflected Xu Yunfan's cold face, a face without a shred of pity, only a Gluttonous greed.

Xu Yunfan said, "Strong enemies from the Outer Realm are coming. I am borrowing your true qi to resist them. It can be considered a merit on your part. The strength of ten people divided is not as good as combining into one. I think you will understand."
