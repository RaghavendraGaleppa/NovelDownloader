Chapter 70: Duel!

Heavenly Capital City, the moment Lu Yang appeared and spoke, instantly turned black and white. An indescribable ripple expanded in all directions. Wherever the ripple passed, all things vanished. Buildings disappeared, pedestrians vanished; everything seemed as if it had never existed. Whether you were a street beggar or a Martial Dao Celestial, all were treated equally!

"How can this be!?" A Martial Dao Celestial shrieked in terror, unable to accept it. Yet, no matter their reaction—whether fleeing, bewildered, or hysterical—they could only silently dissipate within that ripple.

The only exception was Wang Boyuan, the 'Sageheart Scholar.' This peerless genius, who had founded the fourth step of Martial Dao, was unexpectedly calm at this moment. He merely looked up at the sky, a hint of relief on his face: "Gazing at Fate, Observing Heaven... Heh, how can a frog at the bottom of a well speak of gazing at fate, let alone observing heaven?"

As early as when he broke through to the Celestial realm, Wang Boyuan had sensed something was amiss. He had pioneered the "Three Talents Fate-Gazing Art," using human calculation to divine the heavens. Yet, when he exhausted all his lifelong learning to peer into the cosmos, a massive anomaly occurred. He had discerned that Heaven and Earth were incomplete! Though exquisitely crafted, they were not self-consistent, like a meticulously fashioned fake!

For a time, he thought he had miscalculated, that the Fate-Gazing Art was incomplete. Yet, no matter how many times he recalculated, the result remained unchanged. Was Heaven and Earth truly incomplete? Was the mortal world merely an illusionary dream? From then on, the 'Sageheart Scholar,' who once wore a feather fan and silk scarf and was renowned for his elegant demeanor, became a slovenly man who spent his days drinking and idling.

Now, he saw the truth. Only at this moment did Wang Boyuan finally regain some of his former 'Sageheart Scholar's' heroic spirit. He gazed at the sky, relief mixed with regret. "What a pity... if only I could behold the true Heaven and Earth, that would truly be a joy..." The next second, his form dissolved.

The entire Heavenly Capital City thus vanished from the earth. All its inhabitants were gone, leaving behind only the residence of Old Ancestor Yun and Lu Yang suspended in mid-air. In just a blink, Lu Yang used the Secret Realm's authority to erase the entire Heavenly Capital City. All living beings were absorbed into the deepest part of the Dharma Refining Secret Realm, awaiting the next disciple to reactivate them. Meanwhile, the secret realm space where Heavenly Capital City had been was compressed around Old Ancestor Yun. With the space highly condensed, Old Ancestor Yun could no longer escape by fleeing through the void.

"Lu Yang..." Old Ancestor Yun's voice carried both apprehension and indignation. Apprehension because Lu Yang's current strength was no longer something he could underestimate; indignation because all of this was, in fact, his own doing! Without him, Lu Yang, even if he cultivated the Saint Plundering Art, could not have perfected it to this extent! How could he not feel aggrieved?

However, Old Ancestor Yun quickly suppressed all negative emotions and said in a deep voice, "By erasing Heavenly Capital City, are you not afraid that the Saint Plundering Art will lose its karmic support?"

"Senior worries too much," Lu Yang replied with a faint smile. "Since the Saint Plundering Art has reached great accomplishment, the world's karmic fortune is no longer important to me. After all, since it is 'plundering,' how could it ever be returned? In comparison, Senior should pay more attention to your current predicament."

"...Are you threatening me?" Old Ancestor Yun's face grew increasingly grim. His previously contained aura gradually unfurled, radiating chilling killing intent. "You, alone, dare to speak so boldly to me?" "Merely a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator, what's so great about that?" Lu Yang countered sharply, refusing to yield an inch. "I happen to be in need of a reincarnated Foundation Establishment soul to research secret arts. Senior, you've arrived at just the right time to aid my cultivation."

"You seek death, junior!" Amidst his fury, Old Ancestor Yun also clarified the current situation. He even felt a touch of relief that Lu Yang had not left the secret realm but had chosen to confront him. If Lu Yang had left the secret realm to report him, he would surely die. But with Lu Yang coming alone now, there might still be hope for a turnaround!

Old Ancestor Yun frantically urged his magic power. Instantly, a brilliant golden light rose above his head, radiating in three colors: gold, silver, and jade, illuminating the sky in an instant! The Grand Unity Golden Splendor! Unlike Yun Miaozhen's half-baked version, Old Ancestor Yun's Grand Unity Golden Splendor was a complete version, successfully refined long ago—a true Grand Divine Ability! In a flash, the golden light surged forth mightily. Wherever it passed, Heaven and Earth obeyed, sweeping up the spiritual energy of the world into towering waves that crashed directly towards Lu Yang.

Immediately afterward, Lu Yang felt nothing but a flash of golden light before his eyes, as if he had suddenly been isolated into another world. Then, his essence began to drain, his body withered, his True Qi depleted, his magic power gradually weakened, his spiritual will scattered, and his spiritual sense dulled. His essence, qi, and spirit were all swept away by the golden light!

However, the next second, Lu Yang stomped his foot. *Boom!* In an instant, the entire secret realm seemed to tremble violently, like the unavoidable shock caused when a person jumps from a height to a lower ground. Almost simultaneously, Old Ancestor Yun's spiritual sense reeled. The previously condensed Grand Unity Golden Splendor, at the very moment Lu Yang stomped his foot, shattered and dispersed. The essence, qi, and spirit that had been swept away earlier rapidly returned to Lu Yang's body.

The next second, Lu Yang moved. He smirked coldly, then unfurled his sleeves. Innumerable sparks and smoke rose around him, swirling and coiling, finally erupting with a thunderous roar that sent sharp pains through Old Ancestor Yun's ears and eyes. He looked up to see a magnificent golden form rise from the ground, shaped like a mountain, wreathed in smoke and fire.

"Plunder the world's karmic fortune, forge a Saint's Golden Body!" Only now did Lu Yang truly display the full power of the perfected Saint Plundering Art. His 'Dharma Principle' borrowed qi to manifest, actually forming a 'Saint's Aspect'! Seeing this, Old Ancestor Yun frantically urged his Grand Unity Golden Splendor. Instantly, golden splendor filled the sky, splitting into three lights of essence, qi, and spirit, resembling the sun, moon, and stars. Weighing more than mountains, they crashed down towards Lu Yang.

But before the Grand Unity Golden Splendor could descend, the sky-supporting 'Saint's Aspect' stretched out a magnificent hand. The palm was full and round, as clear as jade. It simply descended, covering the sky, and with a closure of its five fingers, it captured the majestic Grand Unity Golden Splendor, along with Old Ancestor Yun, in its palm!

"How dare you!" Old Ancestor Yun grunted. The Grand Unity Golden Splendor continuously expanded, becoming increasingly fiery, almost transforming into a golden sun, threatening to force open the 'Saint's Aspect''s palm. However, on the other side, Lu Yang also formed hand seals upon seeing this. His true body gradually became illusory, while the 'Saint's Aspect' behind him grew increasingly real, solemn, and unmoving against external forces. The Grand Unity Golden Splendor unleashed by Old Ancestor Yun, when it fell upon the Saint's Aspect, at most only scraped off a layer of its skin and flesh. But as soon as it was scraped off, Lu Yang would regenerate it. The result was a prolonged battle where one side consumed magic power and the other consumed vital essence, and Old Ancestor Yun simply couldn't gain any advantage.

"Delays lead to complications... I must subdue this person quickly!" Old Ancestor Yun's thoughts raced. He knew that Lu Yang had gained a great fortune through him, and the Saint Plundering Art was near its peak, already comparable to a Grand Divine Ability. To subdue him, he could only resort to more powerful means. With this thought, Old Ancestor Yun immediately took out a spherical magic treasure. It was precisely the 'Heavens-Searching Orb' bestowed upon him by the Sword Pavilion Sect Master before his reincarnation. Old Ancestor Yun offered this spiritual treasure into the air, then bowed reverently: "I beg Heaven Lord to act."

As his words fell, the Heavens-Searching Orb immediately began to spin, dragging the surrounding space along with it. Up, down, left, right, front, and back were instantly inverted! Within the range enveloped by the 'Heavens-Searching Orb,' all positional changes were distorted: forward became backward, left became upward, upward became forward... All governed by the wielder's will. Now, with it activated, the 'Saint's Aspect' immediately lost its focus and power, allowing Old Ancestor Yun to seize the opportunity to escape. Immediately afterward, he held the 'Heavens-Searching Orb' and covered Lu Yang with it. In an instant, Lu Yang felt his entire body convulse. The 'Saint's Aspect' seemed to be fixed by an immense magic power, unable to move, forced to remain rooted to the spot. It was Old Ancestor Yun who had distorted the direction of all of Lu Yang's movements into 'standing still'. After fixing the 'Saint's Aspect,' Old Ancestor Yun did not stop. The Grand Unity Golden Splendor continuously swept down, clearly intending to break it apart with this slow, torturous method.

"So strong, truly too strong..." Lu Yang commented with an admiring smile upon seeing this. Old Ancestor Yun's strength was unquestionable; after all, he was a reincarnated Foundation Establishment cultivator and held a supreme treasure like the Heavens-Searching Orb. In terms of pure strength, if they dueled a hundred times, Lu Yang would likely lose a hundred times. However, duels are not solely decided by strength. Just as a chess player can defeat an opponent on the board, there are also ways to win off the board.

Meanwhile, outside the Dharma Refining Secret Realm, Lu Yang's Innate Primordial Qi Incarnation traveled tirelessly, arriving directly at the entrance of Immortal Yinshan's cultivation cave. "Immortal! I want to report something!" "There are bad people inside the secret realm!"
