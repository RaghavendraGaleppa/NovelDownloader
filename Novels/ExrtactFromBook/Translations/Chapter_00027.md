# Chapter 27: The Dharma Assembly  

That night, Han Yue spent his money to reserve a large private room on the seventh floor of the trading house, hosting a grand feast for everyone in Celestial District Courtyard No. 9 to celebrate their beloved group mascot, Yan Xiao Liu, breaking through to the Renshen Realm!  

Han Yue sold the various second-rank demon beast organs he had previously reserved for Xiao Liu back to the trading house, earning a considerable amount of trading coins. Some of those materials were even transformed into dishes served at the feast. Prepared by the trading house's master chefs, the demon beast meat became exceptionally delicious, and everyone enjoyed the meal immensely.  

Xiao Qing was present throughout, providing impeccable service. After several transactions involving second-rank demon beasts, Han Yue's service level at the trading house had risen significantly.  

After the feast, everyone escorted Fang Yi and Xiao Liu back first, while Han Yue stayed behind to consult with Xiao Qing about a few matters.  

The two found a tea room, brewed a pot of tea, and chatted as they drank. Han Yue spoke first:  

"Xiao Qing, I’ve accumulated over forty thousand trading coins in the trading house by now."  

"I don’t really need any second-rank materials at the moment. Does the trading house have any third-rank items or materials?"  

Since Han Yue began hunting second-rank demon beasts, his accumulation of trading coins had accelerated dramatically. He was no longer satisfied with purchasing second-rank items—ordinary objects offered little help to him now, and he sought higher-tier materials.  

Xiao Qing thought for a moment before replying:  

"Master Han, you are one of our trading house's most important clients. In principle, we should do everything we can to meet your requests."  

"However, third-rank materials are exceedingly rare!"  

"Every third-rank item is either a top-tier natural treasure, materials produced by third-rank great demonic beasts, or talismans and artifacts meticulously crafted by high-level cultivators!"  

"Any single third-rank item can be a core asset that influences a cultivator’s path! They rarely appear in the open!"  

"While our trading house does possess third-rank items, their transactions differ vastly from lower-tier goods."  

"Every trade involving a third-rank item entails the exchange of information, resources, and personal connections intrinsically linked to the item itself."  

"For our trading house, each such transaction is an opportunity to enhance our influence, reputation, and prestige."  

"Thus, we choose to conduct these trades through organized Dharma Assemblies."  

"Master Han, you haven’t been at Flesh-Cutting Market for long, so you may not know this yet."  

"Our trading house organizes a grand Dharma Assembly every five years."  

"This assembly attracts many cultivation factions from the surrounding regions. After years of careful management, it has become one of the most influential Dharma Assemblies in the entire Gui Province."  

"Each Dharma Assembly serves as a trading platform for third-rank items. Not only does our trading house participate, but many major factions also come to trade."  

"Moreover, because Flesh-Cutting Market sits at the border between two domains, demonic cultivators also attend the assembly to trade, making it a small channel for resource exchange between the two domains."  

"So, if you wish to purchase third-rank items, Master Han, you’ll need to attend the Dharma Assembly."  

"However, third-rank items are far more expensive than second-rank ones, and many transactions are conducted through barter. Acquiring them won’t be easy!"  

Han Yue listened with great interest. He hadn’t expected Flesh-Cutting Market to host such a grand event! He asked:  

"Xiao Qing, when is the next Dharma Assembly, and what are the requirements to participate?"  

Xiao Qing replied:  

"The next Dharma Assembly will be held in a year and a half!"  

"For factions from distant regions, we send invitations a year in advance. Each courtyard in Flesh-Cutting Market also has participation slots, but attendees must have at least second-rank cultivation."  

"Master Han, given your standing with our trading house, you’ll naturally receive a slot."  

"Even if you hadn’t asked, we would have sent you an invitation three months prior."  

Han Yue nodded and pressed further:  

"What’s the general price range for third-rank items?"  

"The price range varies greatly. Depending on the financial means and needs of the trading parties, each item is priced individually!"  

"Most third-rank items are exchanged through barter, with only a few materials being auctioned for spirit stones."  

"In our trading house’s records, the most expensive transaction was for a [Longevity Fruit] that could extend one’s lifespan by fifty years. It was purchased by a third-rank great cultivator nearing the end of his lifespan for five top-grade spirit stones—equivalent to five million trading coins!"  

"The cheapest items tend to be third-rank materials without special functions, such as metals or bones. Since they require refinement before use, their prices are relatively lower."  

"Our records show many third-rank materials being traded for as little as a hundred thousand trading coins."  

Xiao Qing answered in great detail, effortlessly providing all the information.  

"Have there ever been any third-rank or higher cultivation techniques or scriptures traded?"  

Han Yue continued his inquiries.  

"Not at all. Cultivation techniques are difficult to authenticate—without a reliable lineage backing them, who would dare practice them recklessly?"  

"Moreover, well-known cultivation methods are the foundational secrets of major factions. They’re never casually disseminated, let alone allowed to circulate in the market."  

Xiao Qing’s thorough explanations left Han Yue eagerly anticipating the Dharma Assembly!  

Not only would he have a chance to obtain high-tier resources, but he could also meet many high-level cultivators—an invaluable opportunity to broaden his horizons.  

However, if he wanted to make significant gains at the assembly, his current funds were insufficient.  

Fortunately, with a year and a half left, if he worked hard, he could likely save enough for at least one or two of the cheapest third-rank materials!  

After bidding farewell to Xiao Qing and returning to his residence, Han Yue immediately began accumulating his magical power.  

His motivation to earn money had grown even stronger—he resolved to push his limits further!  

Thus, Han Yue embarked on a new phase of cultivation.  

Cultivation, hunting, trading, sparring!  

Han Yue encountered more and more second-rank demon beasts, experiencing their innate supernatural abilities firsthand.  

His combat experience advanced rapidly, and his accumulated magical power grew increasingly profound!  

Most importantly, his wealth continued to grow, soon surpassing the hundred-thousand trading coin mark and rapidly approaching two hundred thousand!  

Han Yue relished this sense of fulfillment.  

One day, as Han Yue flew toward the outer domain for another hunting expedition, he ventured into a new area about fifty thousand kilometers from Flesh-Cutting Market.  

This region had a high density of second-rank demon beasts—roughly one every three hundred kilometers—making it Han Yue’s primary hunting ground.  

But on this day, as he entered a new stretch of land teeming with demonic beasts, he encountered another human.
