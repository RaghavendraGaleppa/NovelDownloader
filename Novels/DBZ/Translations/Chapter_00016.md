# Chapter 16: Bountiful Harvest

Feeling a slight sting on his ankle, as if bitten by a mosquito, accompanied by a tingling sensation, the burly man chuckled. He casually took out an antidote pill and swallowed it. "Hah, poisoned, huh? Too bad I've got enough antidote pills to build a mountain."

But the next moment, his expression changed drastically. "What kind of poison is this?"

The antidote he had just taken had no effect whatsoever. The tingling sensation rapidly spread throughout his entire body in an instant!

This was a deadly poison enhanced by the power of wishes, capable of killing a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator with a single strike. Even for late-stage Qi Refining cultivators, it posed a significant threat.

Had it not been for the fact that this man had cultivated the so-called *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art*, he wouldn't have even been able to remain standing.

"Throw the thunder!" Wei Qian shouted without hesitation.

Upon hearing this, Li Guchen immediately activated the Small Tremor Thunder Pearl and hurled it at the burly man.

At this moment, the man was filled with regret.

Not long ago, he had finally mastered the *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art* and had been eager to show off. When he encountered this unexpected "interruption" during the ambush, he had stepped forward to flaunt his skills.

His calculations had been precise—he was a dual cultivator of both magic and body refinement, unmatched among those below the Foundation Establishment stage. His opponents were merely a fifth-stage and a third-stage Qi Refining junior. If not now, when else would he have the chance to show off?

And so, the hunter had become the hunted.

Now, as the Small Tremor Thunder Pearl flew toward him, he was overwhelmed with terror. He wanted to flee, but the poison had left him powerless, unable to muster even a shred of strength.

Boom! A bolt of lightning struck the burly man, instantly inflicting a horrific wound. His chest was torn open, revealing white bone beneath.

Yet, the man still didn't die.

His mastery of the *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art* had granted him extraordinary physical resilience.

It was clear that, had he not been poisoned, he might have withstood the Small Tremor Thunder Pearl's strike.

Thinking of this, Wei Qian grew interested in the body-refining technique.

"With the help of the *Wishing Dragon Pearl*, I could master this body-refining technique much faster."

Thud! The nine-foot-tall man collapsed to the ground, his vitality rapidly fading.

Wei Qian controlled the nail artifact to strike him once more, this time aiming for the heart. A lethal dose of poison spread wildly from the wound.

After being poisoned twice—both times with toxins potent enough to kill a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator in one strike—the man's life force dwindled rapidly. Death was imminent.

---

Wei Qian took out his last Wind Blade Talisman. A razor-sharp blade of wind formed and shot forward, severing the burly man's head.

Now, the man was truly dead.

Li Guchen blinked, still unable to believe it. A late-stage Qi Refining cultivator who practiced both magic and body refinement had died so easily—and so ignominiously.

"Guchen, remember this," Wei Qian admonished. "Never underestimate your opponents in battle, or this will be your fate."

Li Guchen nodded in agreement.

Arrogance led to disaster. The decapitated corpse of the nine-foot-tall man was proof enough.

Having narrowly escaped death, Li Guchen's tension eased, replaced by another emotion. His eyes kept drifting toward a small pouch hanging from the corpse's waist.

The spoils from this bandit cultivator's storage bag must be substantial.

Not only Li Guchen, but even Wei Qian felt a surge of excitement.

He stepped forward and retrieved the storage bag left behind by the burly man.

With the man dead, the restrictions on the storage bag were easily broken.

Wei Qian flicked his finger, summoning a fireball that engulfed the corpse in roaring flames.

"This place isn't safe. Let's go," Wei Qian ordered.

Li Guchen obeyed without question. The two mounted their horses and galloped toward Misty Ridge Mountain, covering eight hundred li in one go.

At nightfall, they found a cave to rest in.

Only then did Wei Qian finally take out the storage bag to assess their gains.

The storage bag wasn't large, with only three cubic meters of space. Wei Qian probed it with his spiritual sense and soon uncovered everything inside.

After a moment of thought, he retrieved four items: a pitch-black shield artifact, a flying dagger artifact, a stack of talismans, and a small pile of spirit stones.

"Guchen, the value of these items should compensate for your Small Tremor Thunder Pearl," Wei Qian said.

In truth, it wasn't just compensation—it exceeded the pearl's value by dozens of spirit stones.

Li Guchen immediately declined. "No, Brother Qian. If not for you, I'd be dead today. These spoils should belong to you."

Wei Qian smiled faintly. "Don't refuse. Without your Small Tremor Thunder Pearl, we wouldn't have been able to finish off the enemy so cleanly."

Indeed, Wei Qian's nail artifact had played a crucial role, but the Small Tremor Thunder Pearl had been just as vital.

Wei Qian was not a greedy man. What didn't belong to him, he wouldn't take.

But what rightfully belonged to him, he would never let go.

For example, there were still some items he hadn't taken out of the storage bag.

One hundred and twelve low-grade spirit stones! Three spiritual herbs stored in jade boxes, worth roughly six hundred spirit stones.

A top-grade spear artifact! Six top-grade first-tier offensive talismans.

The stack of talismans Wei Qian had given Li Guchen were all defensive or auxiliary in nature.

Moreover, the storage bag also contained a second-tier low-grade talisman that exuded an intimidating aura.

This discovery made Wei Qian feel incredibly fortunate.

Had the burly man not been so eager to show off and had instead used this talisman from the start, Wei Qian and Li Guchen's paths to immortality would have ended right then and there.

But the most valuable item in the storage bag was a jade slip.

The *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art*!

Wei Qian pressed the jade slip to his forehead, absorbing the knowledge within.

After a moment, he opened his eyes. "What an incredible technique! Pity it only covers the Qi Refining stage."

This body-refining technique required enduring various tribulations to temper the body. Practitioners had to train in extreme environments—scorching heat, freezing cold—and even withstand lightning strikes in the later stages.

No wonder the burly man had been so eager to test himself against the Small Tremor Thunder Pearl after mastering the technique. It was part of the cultivation process.

"This technique is powerful, but the risks are enormous. One misstep, and you'd be dead." Any normal cultivator would avoid such a method at all costs.

But for Wei Qian, it was perfect!

With the *Wishing Dragon Pearl*, he could safely complete the cultivation process.

"Still, there's another concern," he mused, his earlier excitement dampened by the thought of the auction house incident.

A Golden Core demonic cultivator had appeared in the area!

For the minor factions in Yunzhou, this was akin to having the Sword of Damocles hanging over their heads.

After all, with just a thought, that Golden Core cultivator could wipe out the two-hundred-year-old Misty Ridge Mountain Li Family in an instant.

He glanced in the direction of the Blackwater Pool Wang Family. "What's happening over there? The Supreme Elder of the Flowing Cloud Sect and the Patriarch of the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Family should be taking action by now, shouldn't they?"
