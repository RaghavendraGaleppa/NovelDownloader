# Chapter 309: The Turmoil in Yujing Dao

“Senior Brother, you will know once you go!” Qing Song blinked mysteriously. “Master is waiting for you in the Clear Weave Hall, and even Chief Cui Yu of the Punishment Hall is here!”

Seeing that the young Taoist boy was playing coy, Xu Yunfan shook his head and laughed. He casually挂 the twin hammers on his waist. “Lead the way. If you dare trick me, I’ll ask Master to punish you by copying the *Scripture of Serenity* ten times.”

Qing Song scratched his head, feigning a foolish grin. “Senior Brother, please don’t tease me.”

“...”

Inside the Clear Weave Hall, Bi Yuan was whispering to Cui Yu when he suddenly heard the sound of the hall door lightly opening.

He looked up, the smile originally forming on his face freezing instantly upon seeing Xu Yunfan.

*Whoosh!*

The candles in the hall dimmed simultaneously. Bi Yuan’s figure had already appeared before Xu Yunfan like a ghost.

The Sect Master of the Dao Sect actually lost his composure, grabbing his disciple’s wrist as Pure Yang True Qi surged in like a tide to inspect him.

“Muscle Washing and Marrow Refining Great Completion?!” Bi Yuan’s voice trembled, a rare occurrence. “Jade Marrow and Golden Bones, Mercury Blood and Silver Meridians... How is this possible!”

Hearing Bi Yuan’s exclamation, the tea cup Cui Yu had just raised shattered in his grip, the tea dripping through his fingers unnoticed. He stared fixedly at the faint golden luster flowing beneath the exposed skin of Xu Yunfan’s neck—the “Flawless Glass Body” that the geniuses of the Dao Sect needed to cultivate for many years to achieve!

What Xu Yunfan cultivated, however, was the Golden Body of Jade Glass from the Maitreya Temple, a technique superior to the Muscle Washing and Marrow Refining of the Dao Sect.

“Three months...”

Bi Yuan released his hand, his eyes filled with shock as if seeing a deity. “Back then, I exhausted Dragon Tiger Golden Pills and still took eight years to touch the threshold of Great Completion. You actually used only ninety days?!”

He recalled how he had swallowed twelve Dragon Tiger Golden Pills and endured day and night in the Cold Jade Cave for eight years just to barely touch the threshold. The sound of jade chimes coming from his fingertips now was undeniably real. This disciple had compressed the hard cultivation of an ordinary person’s half-life into just ninety days and nights!

Xu Yunfan was startled. “Master, you took eight years to break through to the Marrow Refining Realm too?”

Cui Yu spoke gloomily from the side. “That is considered fast. In the entire history of the Dao Sect, your Master’s cultivation speed can still rank in the top five.”

Xu Yunfan’s heart settled instantly; he had been doubting his life just moments ago due to the flowing memories in his mind.

He felt helpless. Although he used the *Dragon Tiger Hibernation Breathing Technique* to conceal his aura, Bi Yuan was the creator of the technique—how could he be fooled?

“Master, do you think... this disciple’s practice is decent?”

He deliberately pretended not to know, but the golden light flowing beneath his skin flickered with his breath, like stars appearing and disappearing.

“You brat, putting on an act.”

Bi Yuan laughed and scolded, then said, “‘Decent’? That’s an understatement!”

Bi Yuan suddenly laughed loudly, his expression full of joy, shaking the dust off the hall beams. “The head of the Maitreya Temple sat in meditation for twelve years to achieve his Golden Body, yet you reached it in three months! Even the sages of the ancient times who possessed innate Dao Bodies weren’t this monstrous!”

Cui Yu was also doubting his life. Standing before Xu Yunfan, he felt he had lived his years in vain.

“Flesh and blood like mercury, bones chiming like chimes... This is the ‘Flawless True Body’ only possible at the peak of the Marrow Refining Realm!”

His expression was extremely complex. Recalling how he had entered the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining and the hardships he endured along the way, only he knew the details. Yet now, Xu Yunfan broke through realms as easily as eating and drinking.

*Do you know how I’ve spent these years!*

Cui Yu screamed internally, his face tightly绷ing on the outside, not saying a word.

Complexity and ecstasy intertwined in Bi Yuan’s eyes.

If Xu Yunfan could maintain this pace, the shackles of the Ninth Realm would likely be nothing to him.

Thinking of the prophecy regarding the impending arrival of the Demon King, the Sect Master’s fist hidden in his sleeve clenched silently. This disciple might truly become the final true dragon that allows the Dao Sect to break through the calamity.

Thinking of this, Bi Yuan’s fist couldn't help but feel a bit hard again. Once he returned, he had to find an opportunity to beat Bi Sheng up again. If he hadn't gone to the Five-Color Altar on a whim and seen Xu Yunfan, he might have truly missed him.

After the inspection, even Bi Yuan couldn't help but click his tongue in wonder.

Xu Yunfan retracted his stance, the blood qi steaming around him slowly converging into his body.

Bi Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze sharp as a torch as he examined this disciple. Achieving Marrow Refining Great Completion in three months, remaining undefeated against the thirty-six peaks, and obtaining two divine weapons at the Sword Burial Abyss—such talent far surpassed the prodigies of the Dao Sect’s previous generations.

To appear at such a critical moment was truly the fortune of the Dao Sect.

“For the next breakthrough to the Organ Refining Realm, you need to pay attention to three key points.”

Bi Yuan condensed a thread of Pure Yang True Qi at his fingertip, sketching a human meridian diagram in the air that lingered for a long time without dissipating.

“First, the five organs must be tempered simultaneously using the ‘Five Elements Rotation’ method, without bias. Second, the Jade Marrow and Golden Liquid in the marrow must be diverted to the organs, forming the image of an ‘Inner Organ Golden Bell’. Third...”

He suddenly flicked his finger. The True Qi transformed into a shadow of a red python and pounced toward Xu Yunfan’s chest, only to be shattered by the faint golden patterns that automatically surfaced beneath his skin. Seeing this, Bi Yuan praised.

“Not bad. The protective golden patterns of the Muscle Washing and Marrow Refining have become instinctual.”

*That’s enough!*

Xu Yunfan suppressed the sarcasm in his heart. This move was completely Bi Yuan unable to resist testing if the Xu Yunfan who achieved Marrow Refining Great Completion in three months was just an illusion.

“Thank you for your guidance, Master!”

Xu Yunfan performed a solemn disciple’s salute. These key points were very important, enough to shorten his cultivation time when the Attribute Panel brought the Ten Extreme Martial Dao to the入门 (entry) level.

However, Bi Yuan slid a scroll out of his sleeve. “I came this time because an opportunity has arrived. A rare opportunity.”

When the scroll was unfurled, it was actually a topographic map of the Great Zhou territory.

Bi Yuan’s finger pointed above Yujing City. “That madwoman sitting on the Dragon Chair, who once blood-sacrificed the sixteen states in an attempt to forcefully open the revival of the world’s spiritual energy and suffered backlash, has finally reached the point where the oil is exhausted and the lamp is dying.”

His finger moved slightly, pointing to the blood-red mark at the junction of Yujing Dao and Jiannan Dao. “The end of Jiannan Dao connects with Yujing Dao, and the Imperial Dark Guard has lost nearly half its strength over the years... If the Dao Sect does not make a move amidst this chaos, wouldn't that be failing the will of heaven?”

Xu Yunfan instantly understood his Master’s plan.

As the hub of the Great Zhou, Yujing Dao not only controls the ancient secret manual *Xuantian Baolu*, but its underground also hides the “Xuanhuang Pool” where twelve dragon veins intersect.

If one could seize the initiative during the change of imperial power...

He looked up and met Bi Yuan’s gaze directly.

“Yunfan, back when the Empress blood-sacrificed the sixteen states and slaughtered thirty-six million commoners, the Dao Sect never sat idly by. It’s just that some things can only be done in the dark. The Incense Fire Sect that descended upon Jiannan Dao back then was already wiped out by our Dao Sect.”

“The world’s spiritual energy is not only needed by that Empress, but also by the six great sects of the Great Zhou, and even those old monsters sleeping underground to prolong their lives using various secret martial methods... If the Dao Sect were to make a move, even more people would die than currently...”

Bi Yuan said softly, “I hope you can understand. If you look only at the surface, the six great sects of the Great Zhou are indeed tumors sucking the blood of the people. But the Demon King hangs over our heads like a sword, and we are unwilling to be mere nourishment for others...”

Xu Yunfan remained silent for a moment, then nodded slightly. “This disciple understands.”

The rights and wrongs of this matter will be judged by history. Since he has encountered it and possesses the strength, he will naturally do something about it.

(I don't want to whitewash the six sects in this section. Let's see what happens later...)
