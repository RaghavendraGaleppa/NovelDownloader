# Chapter 43: Adrift

The leading rogue cultivator was clearly displeased with Jiang Li's escape. He picked up a basketball-sized rock and hurled it into the river. 

But the splash and ripples were quickly erased by the raging torrents of the Mazu River, leaving no trace behind.

"Boss, I had no idea either. We tested them—at most two of those eight were mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators. The rest were all early-stage novices," one of the lackeys explained. 

"And they had no real experience. We stood right in the crowd today, and they didn't even notice us."

"Boss, why don’t we just storm the palace tonight? Keep the women, kill the men—same as usual?" suggested another cultivator with shifty, rat-like eyes.

**Bam!**

Before his lecherous grin could fully form, the boss kicked him to the ground.

"Are you an idiot? They’re sect disciples! If we could’ve killed them all cleanly, fine. But now one got away, and you still want to act? Do you have a death wish?" 

The leader’s face twisted with fury—both at his subordinate’s stupidity and at the constant oppression sect cultivators inflicted on independent ones like them.

"So... what do we do?" the lackey asked weakly.

"What do we do? We search! Follow the riverbank and find him! I refuse to believe he won’t come up for air!"

As the rogue cultivators began their pursuit along the river, Jiang Li and his Black Zombie were already being swept downstream by the furious currents.

Jiang Li hadn’t volunteered for this mission out of some heroic impulse. His bond with Yu Banxia and the others wasn’t deep enough for that. 

His decision stemmed partly from the arrogance of a transmigrator—the belief that fate favored him. With a rare treasure emerging, he couldn’t resist getting involved. 

The other reason was confidence. Though only at mid-stage Qi Refinement, his enhanced states—tested on the ill-fated Jing River Duo—allowed him to dominate most Qi Refinement cultivators. 

As for Foundation Establishment experts? They were too busy hunting the corpse demon to bother patrolling the river’s outskirts. Traveling by water would let him bypass most threats, making this route safer than staying in the city. 

Thus, he’d taken the task willingly.

But... plans rarely survive contact with reality.

**Thud!**

A dull impact echoed underwater as Jiang Li—his skin now pitch-black—slammed into a submerged boulder. 

A metallic tang rose in his throat. Despite daily training with the *Mountain-Crushing Art*, that collision had actually injured him.

---

After the impact, the current flipped Jiang Li head over heels, spinning him like a top as it hurled him downstream. 

This was *not* a pleasant experience.  

**[High-Speed Rotation: Dizziness inflicted on self.]**  
**[Dizziness: Spatial awareness skewed by 60 degrees, cognitive speed reduced by 40%, temporary mental debuff. Duration: 20 minutes.]** (-+)

Jiang Li could swim—well enough not to drown, at least—but he was no match for the river’s fury. The violent undercurrents made balance impossible. 

Forget swimming; the river tossed him left, right, up, and down in endless, uncontrollable rolls. Within minutes, the spinning triggered **[Dizziness]**. Only by repeatedly canceling the effect did he avoid passing out. 

No wonder those rogue cultivators hadn’t pursued him into the water. Even Qi Refinement cultivators could drown. 

This world’s natural forces dwarfed those of his past life. The river’s power could shred a human body—without exceptional swimming skills, drowning was a real risk.

Fortunately, the Gillweed he’d taken worked. Though breathing wasn’t as smooth as on land, inhaling water produced copious bubbles, extracting dissolved oxygen and keeping him alive. 

But that was the *only* advantage.

**Crash!**

Another boulder greeted Jiang Li. A cloud of blood bloomed in the water before vanishing in the current.

The **[Underwater Breathing]** status did nothing to improve his swimming. He tried resisting the current, then yielding to it—anything to regain control and avoid collisions. 

But mastering such techniques wasn’t instantaneous. He kept tumbling, kept crashing.

Strangely, each brutal impact accelerated his progress in the *Mountain-Crushing Art*. The river’s battering honed his body far more effectively than slamming into cliffs ever had. 

Turns out, the *Mountain-Crushing Art* truly was a masochistic cultivation method—the harsher the suffering, the greater the gains.

"I can’t keep this up—I’ll be smashed to pieces!" 

After over an hour underwater, Jiang Li checked his status panel. His health had already dropped by a quarter.

---

The numbers for health and stamina weren’t perfect indicators, but they were close enough. 

"I need to surface and recover."

**Wooden Armor Technique!**

Channeling wood-attribute灵气, he completed the hand seals. A glow of vitality enveloped him as wooden plates rapidly grew across his body, forming a full suit of armor.

The buoyant wood lifted Jiang Li’s nearly submerged form toward the surface. 

Occasional whirlpools dragged him back down, but their grip never lasted. The armor’s lift was constant, and after several struggles, he finally broke the surface.

Jiang Li sighed. His first use of the *Wooden Armor Technique*... as a life jacket. 

The river’s depths were lethally unpredictable. Water-attributed cultivators might fare better, but for someone like him? He might as well have been a landlubber.

Floating on his back, bobbing with the waves, Jiang Li pondered his next move. 

Staying atop the water made him an obvious target and slowed him down drastically. Worse, his Black Zombie might drift away entirely. 

But diving back in? His body couldn’t take much more abuse.

Wait... the Black Zombie?

Jiang Li quickly checked on it through their spiritual link. Zombies were tough but lacked defensive instincts—had it been smashed to pieces already?

To his surprise, the damage it had sustained was far lighter than his own. 

The zombie simply drifted like an inert corpse, yet whenever a collision loomed, the currents somehow steered it clear. It had barely taken any real damage...

So... had all his struggling been not just pointless, but counterproductive?
