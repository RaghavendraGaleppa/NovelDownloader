# Chapter 36: The 999 Rules of Civil Cooperation in the Great Li Dynasty  

"A rabid zombie," Chang Ping said.  

Inside the Cui residence, chaos reigned. The sounds of struggle gradually drew the attention of nearby residents. Despite the cold winter night, they bundled up in thick cotton coats—some even wrapped in quilts—to see what was happening. If not for the government officials guarding the gates, they would have rushed in for a closer look.  

In the courtyard, numerous constables were engaged in subduing the zombie. They had trapped it within a net infused with spiritual energy, while over a dozen strong martial artists strained to hold it down. Others stood by, unable to intervene directly, waiting to step in if needed. A few archers stood at a distance, but the chaotic scene made it too risky to fire arrows and purify the zombie.  

Despite their efforts, the authorities were losing ground.  

The zombie grew increasingly agitated, gripping the net and spinning in circles, swinging the men around like a giant windmill.  

"One of the survivors said the zombie was the Cui family's steward... It appeared suddenly, with immense strength, catching the authorities off guard. We need to call in an expert," one of Chang Ping's colleagues remarked.  

The area around Willow Town had no shortage of cultivators, and Cloudrise Town was no different. The world was full of practitioners, though distinguishing the genuine from the frauds was another matter.  

Chang Ping was frustrated. Since the murder case at the Kaishan Escort Agency the day before, his two decades of investigative experience seemed utterly useless, leaving him without a single lead. Now, with this new crisis at the Cui residence, the situation was only growing more dire.  

"Let me handle it," Xiao Ji said, stepping toward the zombie.  

His words brought a glimmer of hope to the tense scene. With no time to summon an expert, waiting for help could mean disaster.  

Chang Ping eyed Xiao Ji skeptically, surprised by the Taoist's sudden boldness. To him, Xiao Ji had been nothing more than a passive observer since arriving with the recently renowned Constable Song Yuanbao—wandering around, offering no input. Unlike Song, who always had insightful remarks to share.  

"I think he can do it," Song Yuanbao said confidently. In his eyes, the most reliable person in the world was none other than Daoist Xiao from the Primordial Temple.  

Xiao Ji circled the zombie.  

The constables continued their struggle, the spiritual net on the verge of tearing. Men were flung into walls, knocked unconscious, only to be swiftly replaced by others. Support staff carried the injured away for treatment.  

**[Cui Family Steward: Transformed into a zombie due to the influence of a four-stringed pipa fragment. A White Zombie—strong but mindless, obsessed with meeting the Cui family's mistress.]**  

This was a zombie with unfinished business, its thoughts fixated on a single goal.  

The Cui mistress had already been tortured to death, her body lying on the steps of the house. Yet the zombie still searched for her. Left unchecked, it would continue its futile hunt indefinitely.  

Zombies were categorized into five colors—white, black, gray, gold, and purple—each corresponding to the early cultivation stages of human practitioners. These creatures lacked intelligence and had limited potential, their strength capped far below that of true corpse cultivators who refined themselves with Yin energy. In essence, they were little more than domesticated beasts.  

But this one had transformed into a White Zombie immediately after its change—an anomaly that demanded attention.  

Xiao Ji calculated the zombie's movements and chose his moment.  

"Listen to me," he said, drawing his sword and holding up a large wooden plank he had picked up earlier. "I'll count down from one hundred and eight. When I reach one, release the net and retreat quickly."  

His words and actions baffled the onlookers.  

*Why not start counting from the dawn of creation?* they thought. *This will take forever.*  

The people of Cloudrise Town didn’t know Xiao Ji, and his instructions earned him skeptical looks. *Who does this guy think he is?*  

Chang Ping stepped in. "This is a renowned Taoist master invited from our neighboring town. The situation is critical—just follow his lead."  

The men reluctantly agreed.  

Xiao Ji pointed his sword at the zombie and suddenly shouted, "One!"  

Everyone stared at him in stunned silence.  

*What about the other one hundred and seven numbers? Did he just skip them all?*  

But the world was ever-changing, and opportunities were fleeting. The perfect moment to strike had arrived, and Xiao Ji seized it.  

His sword gleamed as he lunged forward.  

The constables released the net and leaped back.  

The zombie, suddenly freed from resistance, staggered. Sensing danger, it turned—just as Xiao Ji's blade pierced its forehead, the weakest point of its body.  

The White Zombie's head exploded in a spray of blood, brain matter, and dark energy.  

Many were splattered with the foul substances, cursing their luck. Fortunately, the filth wasn’t toxic—just disgustingly dirty.  

As the crowd groaned and complained, they noticed Xiao Ji standing untouched, the wooden plank shielding him from the gore.  

*So that’s why he picked it up.*  

He had known exactly what would happen.  

*Of course, he’s the only one who stays clean.*  

Human settlements, bustling with life energy, naturally repelled malevolent entities like zombies. Only the boldest, most cunning—or the utterly mindless—dared to enter.  

Beyond the deterrent of human presence, towns were frequented by powerful cultivators. A single encounter could spell doom for any intruding evil.  

It was like a master cultivator wandering into the Demon Realm’s Executioner Town—no matter how strong, they’d eventually be captured, killed, or worse, put on display before execution.  

Thus, the moment this brainless White Zombie leaped into the town, its fate was sealed.  

The Cui family had suffered devastating losses—many dead, servants fled, and their wealth corrupted by the zombie’s rampage. A once-prosperous household had been wiped out overnight.  

"Constable Chang, a word in private," Xiao Ji said, wiping his Thunderbolt Sword clean before beckoning Chang Ping over.  

Xiao Ji’s message was simple: the cases involving the Kaishan Escort Agency and the Cui family needed to be closed.  

The plan was similar to their earlier discussions.  

The Cui zombie would be left on display while rumors spread that officials from the county’s Evil-Suppression Bureau would arrive in three days to collect it—the estimated time for a round trip between Cloudrise Town and Longxiang County.  

During this period, a small team would lie in wait, ready to intercept anyone attempting to retrieve the Koi Luck-Transfer Embroidery.  

Having witnessed Xiao Ji slay the White Zombie, Chang Ping regarded him with newfound respect. His reaction mirrored Song Yuanbao’s.  

"Daoist Xiao, I’m not following," Chang Ping admitted, hoping for a simpler explanation.  

The three huddled in a corner, whispering.  

The complexity of the cases made Xiao Ji’s reasoning hard to grasp. As an outsider, his deductions remained speculative—not concrete evidence.  

"Trust Daoist Xiao’s plan. It’ll work," Song Yuanbao insisted.  

Xiao Ji meticulously reconstructed the case, analyzing Han Kaishan’s suspicions and Wang Dajiu’s lies.  

"But what if the zombie’s stomach doesn’t contain the Cui family heirloom?" Chang Ping raised a critical question.  

"Let’s check first," Xiao Ji suggested.  

They moved the headless zombie into a room, sliced open its abdomen, and retrieved the blood-soaked Koi Luck-Transfer Embroidery. Unfolding it, Xiao Ji plucked out a coiled string, cleaned it, and casually tucked it into his robe.  

Noticing Song Yuanbao and Chang Ping’s stares, Xiao Ji lowered his voice.  

"This is a magical artifact. I’ve just claimed it for myself—you both witnessed it. According to Article 37 of *The 999 Rules of Civil Cooperation in the Great Li Dynasty*..."  

He pulled out an officially printed copy of the rules and read aloud:  

*"If, during a collaboration between officials and an invited cultivator, a magical artifact is discovered and is unclaimed, ownership shall be determined by the principle of first possession."*  

"The Cui family is gone, so this minor artifact is rightfully mine."  

His flawless application of the law left Chang Ping chuckling.  

"Of course, we understand the rules. Cloudrise Town has no claim to it. Take it if you like. Solving the case is what matters most."
