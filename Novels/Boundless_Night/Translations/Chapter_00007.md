# Night Without Borders - Chapter 7: Encounter

Outside the village, darkness reigned, obscuring the landscape. Few people ventured out at this hour.

"Uncle Yang?" Qin Ming had barely left the village when he spotted a stout man.

Yang Yongqing looked surprised. "Little Qin, shallow night has yet to arrive, and you're heading out so early?"

"I wanted to try my luck in the wilderness, see if there are any mountain beasts that froze to death," Qin Ming replied.

Yang Yongqing chuckled. "We had the same idea. I just scouted around outside the mountain, but unfortunately, I found nothing."

Qin Ming was stunned. This burly, bearded middle-aged man was actually returning from the outside; he was certainly up early. *How could Uncle Yang be doing the same thing as me? Is he perhaps hunting some rare, spiritual prey?* He knew Yang Yongqing was formidable, one of the few 'newborns' in Twin Tree Village.

The two had only chatted for a few moments when they noticed dark figures moving in the distance.

"Patrollers," Yang Yongqing murmured.

In an era without a sun, the wilderness was exceptionally dangerous, requiring highly capable individuals to patrol the mountains for warnings.

A tall man in leather armor appeared, carrying a bow and arrows, gripping an iron spear, and with long, disheveled hair. His entire being exuded raw, wild power.

"Brother Shao," Yang Yongqing greeted him proactively.

Shao Chengfeng, a man of around forty with extremely sharp eyes, nodded. He stopped nearby and said, "He's so young to be out with you. Is he that peculiar fellow?"

"That peculiar fellow is from the neighboring village..." Yang Yongqing explained.

"You Twin Tree Village folks aren't doing so well," Shao Chengfeng said bluntly. "You haven't had a newborn in the golden age group for decades."

Yang Yongqing found this normal. Few people in this entire region could become newborns at fifteen or sixteen years old; talent couldn't be forced.

He continued, "I really didn't realize how formidable that peculiar fellow was in his early years. I heard that after he recovered from his deficiencies, his physical capabilities improved even further."

Shao Chengfeng nodded. "He is indeed quite extraordinary. I just wonder if he can stand shoulder to shoulder with the elites in that bright city far away."

"That's difficult," Yang Yongqing sighed with some emotion. "One environment nurtures one type of person." He had witnessed the prosperity of the city and understood the brilliance brought by advanced power scriptures.

"Indeed," Shao Chengfeng agreed. "I heard two incredibly remarkable youths appeared there, a boy and a girl, surpassing all previous newborns of the golden age group, astonishing the entire region."

"It truly is a land of spiritual brilliance," Yang Yongqing felt only admiration, not jealousy, because those places were far from them, and there was no comparison.

Qin Ming listened attentively the entire time, without interjecting.

After a brief stop, Shao Chengfeng vanished into the night.

No one knew what level of creatures resided deep within the dark mountains, or how many dangerous tribes existed. Patrollers were needed to monitor the outer regions and provide warnings.

Qin Ming spoke, "Patrollers are powerful individuals. Do they enter the mountains every day?"

"Some are very responsible," Yang Yongqing replied.

Qin Ming paused. *Does that mean some are not responsible?* He hadn't expected such a nuanced answer from the burly, bearded man.

"The situation in the mountains is very abnormal now; it's exceedingly dangerous. I estimate that it won't be long before the higher-ups conduct a 'mountain sweep operation,' and some disciples from prominent families should follow. Little Qin, you should strive to become a newborn during the golden age group," Yang Yongqing patted his shoulder. "If you happen to catch the eye of some noble lady who comes down, it might change your destiny."

The two parted ways, with Yang Yongqing returning to the village. Qin Ming digested the information as he continued towards the wilderness.

His speed was incredibly fast. He moved through the chest-deep snow like parting waves, sending snowflakes splashing to both sides of the path.

By now, the night was less intense; shallow night had arrived, and the mountain forest was vaguely discernible. Qin Ming stood at the edge of the mountains, his guard up, for one never knew what dangers lurked in unseen areas.

*Grumble*. His stomach growled, sending another signal of hunger. He had forcibly suppressed it earlier when he encountered an acquaintance on the road, but now it had completely failed. His stomach churned with acid. Staring into the dark, dense forest, he gripped his hunting spear and darted inside.

He passed the habitat of mutated squirrels, crossed the small hill, and ventured further than his previous trip. After delving slightly deeper into the forest, he found many tracks, such as shattered animal bones and large hoof prints. There was no need to worry about the snow being too deep, as many creatures had already trampled out small paths.

A whimpering sound drifted through the air, like a woman weeping, quite unusual in such a desolate forest. Qin Ming instantly accelerated, searching for the source of the sound in the mountains, and quickly neared his destination.

In the dark forest, pairs of emerald green eyes stared back. There were over a dozen shadowy figures. Someone unfamiliar with the wilderness might have been scared by the crying, but for those who often traveled through it, this was perhaps an opportunity.

Qin Ming charged forward, gripping his hunting spear. Instantly, a flurry of wings sounded as over a dozen creatures swiftly soared into the night sky, startled away. These were carnivorous night birds, two feet long, gregarious, and their calls resembled eerie wails. They hunted various small animals for food and sometimes attacked humans.

Qin Ming reached the spot in an instant, silently lamenting his bad luck. On the ground lay only a pile of bloody bones and a few stained fragments of animal hide; a roe deer had been completely devoured. Failing to snatch food from the birds' mouths, he turned to leave, wary of an attack from these carnivorous night birds.

He came to a clearing, sparsely wooded and stained with blood. There were paw prints larger than a serving bowl, indicating it was a feeding ground for large predatory beasts. As for the remaining carcasses, they had likely been carried off by other carnivores. Just as Lu Ze had said, even the outer regions of the mountain forest had become dangerous; one could only imagine what the deeper parts of the mountains were like.

Qin Ming remained vigilant as he left the bloody scene. Moments later, he discovered numerous hoof prints in the snow and immediately perked up, following them.

In the night, over twenty dark figures stood ahead. They were all quite large, and gathered together, they exuded a sense of oppression.

"Blade-horned Deer!" Qin Ming's face lit up with joy. In the past, deer herds rarely frequented this area.

He took out his bow and arrow, aiming at a large stag. These were not docile deer. Adult males had six horns, distributed on the sides and front of their heads, all flat and sharp like six steel blades. If one were to be gored, it would surely leave a fatal bloody hole. Even some fierce beasts dared not charge them head-on, always resorting to ambushes from behind. A human caught in such a herd would meet a miserable end.

Qin Ming pulled the tough bowstring taut into a full moon shape. *Whoosh!* The iron arrow flew as swiftly as lightning, piercing the stag's lungs. Blade-horned Deer were notoriously aggressive and dared to confront various predators. This large stag, after being hit, did not flee. Instead, it immediately charged towards Qin Ming. The herd, briefly startled, followed it, galloping wildly. Snow splattered, and hoofbeats thundered, making the forest tremble slightly.

Qin Ming didn't panic. He drew his bow again, striking accurately once more. The iron arrow carried immense force, burying itself completely and causing the large stag's body to sway a few times. He put away his bow and arrows, calmly climbing a very thick tree and hiding several meters high. In the dense forest, it was difficult to aim at prey after climbing a tree, as many branches obstructed the view.

After galloping for some distance, the large stag stumbled, unable to bear it any longer, and *thud*, it collapsed in the snow. The deer herd, startled, all came to a halt, then thundered away into the distance.

Qin Ming waited for a moment. When no dangerous mountain beasts appeared, he jumped down from the tree and approached, hunting spear in hand. This dark-brown Blade-horned Deer was exceptionally robust, weighing at least 770 pounds, and had not grown thin even in winter. He was very satisfied with such a harvest.

The forest was dangerous, and it was unwise to linger. He dragged the Blade-horned Deer and immediately returned along the same path. He was experiencing the benefits of his "awakening"; with greatly increased strength, he could quickly move through the snow with such a heavy catch, feeling no fatigue.

The wilderness boasted a variety of trees, such as larch and spruce, often dozens of meters tall, soaring into the night sky. The mountain wind picked up, whipping up many snow particles that stung his face.

In the whistling cold wind, Qin Ming broke out in goosebumps. A large, furry paw suddenly landed on his shoulder from behind. At the same time, he felt a warm breath on the hairs of his neck. He realized it must be a gaping maw, close by, aiming to bite through his nape.

He instantly shrugged his shoulders, squatted down, and rolled into the snow to one side. Even so, he still drew blood. The large paw on his shoulder was incredibly strong, comparable to sharp iron hooks, tearing through his cotton coat and injuring both his shoulders.

The snow erupted as a terrifying dark figure, which had been hidden in a snowdrift, suddenly sprang up. Tall and robust, it lunged forward after him. Qin Ming reacted quickly, moving across the ground like a slithering snake, narrowly escaping.

The ferocious dark figure attacked again, its sharp claws capable of tearing off a person's entire face, and its wide-open mouth revealing gleaming fangs. Qin Ming had no time to stand, but he didn't panic. He calmly extended his hands, firmly gripping the creature's forelegs, holding them tightly. The terrifying claws were incredibly close to his face, almost touching, but they could not be pressed down.

Facing it head-on, Qin Ming finally saw the creature's appearance. It had a massive donkey head with a wide mouth, long black mane along its neck, and the body of a mountain wolf, making it exceptionally fierce. It lunged for Qin Ming's throat. The situation was extremely perilous; the warm breath from its bloody maw sprayed directly onto Qin Ming's face, carrying a strong,腥味 (fishy/bloody) stench.

He remained calm in the face of danger, gripping its forelegs tightly. He maneuvered its own claws towards its fanged mouth, using them to block itself. At the same time, as he resisted, he curled his body, tucking in his legs to gather strength, then kicked out violently, striking its abdomen with full force. Qin Ming was undergoing his awakening, his strength surprisingly great. He sent the hundreds-of-pounds mountain beast flying backward, rolling several times on the ground.

"A Donkey-headed Wolf!" he stared at the black beast before him. It was also called a "Mountain Hybrid." It had a donkey head and a mountain wolf's body, but it was far more powerful than a regular mountain wolf. A normal individual weighed at least 180 pounds, and this one was clearly mutated, weighing over 440 pounds. An ordinary person encountering it would surely die! Its four limbs were long, allowing it to walk upright. Some elderly locals had even seen the strange sight of a Mountain Hybrid carrying prey while walking.

The mutated creature before him was brutal and agile. The moment it rose, it immediately pressed Qin Ming's hunting spear into the snow nearby. Qin Ming was speechless; it actually possessed some intelligence, knowing to separate him from his weapon.

The Donkey-headed Wolf's eyes were fierce, its thick mane bristling. It suddenly stood upright, instantly gaining significant height, and let out a roar, exuding a powerful aura. Qin Ming was not intimidated in the slightest. He drew his short knife from his back and advanced. He was in the midst of his awakening transformation; if he faced it head-on, he believed he could kill it with his bare hands.

The Donkey-headed Wolf moved, stirring a foul wind that sent snow flying. It let out a muffled roar, shaking the snowflakes from the tree branches. Qin Ming's short knife collided with its large claws, emitting a crisp clang. The Donkey-headed Wolf stood upright, its eyes blood-red, attempting to embrace and bite him. Qin Ming moved like lightning, a flash of bright blade light streaked past, and blood flowed from its mouth as its tusks were severed. He quickly followed up, his right leg like an iron whip, sweeping heavily across its body. Accompanied by the sound of cracking bones, it let out an agonized shriek. Qin Ming pounced, pressing the 440-pound Donkey-headed Wolf into the snow, and relentlessly delivered a flurry of punches.

*Crack!* The Donkey-headed Wolf's neck was broken by his blow, twisted unnaturally, and it lay motionless. Being a mutated creature, its glossy black fur was highly valuable, and it had been preserved relatively intact. If an outsider were present, they would surely be shocked that the extremely fierce mutated Donkey-headed Wolf had been beaten to death by Qin Ming with his bare fists.

Soon, Qin Ming discovered a remnant iron arrowhead on its body. He was certain this was the mutated creature that had attacked him on the road last time when he was raiding the red squirrel nest. It had been some distance away then, so he hadn't seen it clearly, but he had shot that creature that day.

Qin Ming touched his shoulder. The wound wasn't deep, and the bleeding stopped quickly. The process had actually been extremely dangerous; if his reaction had been even a moment slower, not only would both his shoulders have been torn open, but his nape would also have been bitten through.

He had expended considerable energy. His stomach rumbled like a beating drum, and he was so hungry it made him panic. He desperately wanted to roast a deer leg on the spot and feast. However, lighting a fire in the dark of night was like a lighthouse in the fog, a guiding beacon that would expose him to all creatures in the mountain forest, making it far too dangerous.

Qin Ming looked at the Donkey-headed Wolf at his feet, the Blade-horned Deer not far away, and then towards the small hill ahead. Carrying two large animals over the hill would be quite troublesome. He decided to "lighten his load."

The Blade-horned Deer and Donkey-headed Wolf had just died, their bodies still warm. As he cut open their hides with his short knife, blood immediately gushed out, staining the snow red. Although he was a clean-cut young man, his survival skills in the wilderness were strong, for he had always lived by his own means. He swiftly disemboweled both prey animals with quick, efficient cuts, and immediately buried the innards in the snow to conceal the smell of blood.

"I hope there are no dangerous creatures nearby," Qin Ming thought, believing it wouldn't be a major issue since this was already the outer region of the mountain forest.

However, just as he reached halfway up the hill, he heard a huge commotion in the distance. This was no ordinary sound; it startled many birds into the night sky, and numerous mountain beasts fled rapidly.

"Did the smell of blood attract a giant beast?" Qin Ming frowned, looking towards the distant dense forest. The sound drew nearer, accompanied by roars, and the ground snow churned. From time to time, the sound of tree branches snapping could be heard.

Soon, he saw a colossal creature, as tall and robust as an armored vehicle, incredibly fierce, overturning various obstacles in its path. It was wounded, its body stained with blood. This must be a defeated giant beast, escaping into this area, not charging towards Qin Ming. He gasped sharply. It was a wild boar, frighteningly huge, weighing at least 1,650 pounds. One must know that a 660-pound wild boar could be king of its tribe. This one far surpassed its peers, covered in coarse, steel-needle-like bristles, its snow-white tusks longer than an adult's forearm, its appearance too ferocious.

Qin Ming felt uneasy. If such a formidable Boar King was defeated, what kind of creature was pursuing it? He had originally thought this massive beast would pass by the foot of the mountain and leave, but then its nose twitched, and it actually charged up the small hill. Being wounded made it extremely sensitive, and the smell of blood in the forest had stimulated it. Qin Ming realized he was in deep trouble, not just because this giant beast was extremely dangerous, but also because the mysterious creature pursuing it might follow. Faintly, he could already hear commotion from the distant dense forest.

The wind gradually weakened, then completely vanished. The mountain-like Boar King charged over, savage and formidable, sending snow flying. It crashed straight through everything, breaking off branches that stood in its way. Some dead trees even snapped at their trunks. Qin Ming's expression changed slightly. He climbed a tree that required several people to encircle its trunk, gaining a vantage point. He prepared to use his bow and arrows to shoot its eyes, heart, and other vital points when it drew near.

The enormous Boar King approached, its coarse black fur bristling. When it lifted its head, its face was clearly visible; it actually had a layer of black scales, shimmering with a cold, metallic luster, making it even more hideous and fierce. Qin Ming frowned. He was completely targeted by this oppressive, giant Boar King. He nocked an iron arrow to his bowstring, aiming downwards.

Suddenly, he felt something was wrong. The mountain forest had instantly fallen silent. All sorts of birds and raptors that had soared into the night sky were gone, and the fleeing mountain beasts seemed to have vanished. The vast forest was suddenly without a sound, highly unusual.

At the same time, he saw a ball of light rise from a distant peak. It was initially soft but quickly grew brilliant, rising higher and higher. At this moment, the short-tempered Boar King dared not make a sound. It retreated silently, afraid of even breaking a branch. It was as cautious as a small kitten, hiding in a densely wooded, dark area, finally burrowing into a hollow and burying itself in the snow.

In the era of Eternal Night, the sky should have been empty, perpetually shrouded in darkness. Yet in the night sky, that ball of light grew increasingly brighter, like a brilliant full moon hanging high above. Qin Ming's heart pounded. He knew, however, that it was actually an insect.
