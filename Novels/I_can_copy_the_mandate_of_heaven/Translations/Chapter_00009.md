## Chapter 9: Deep Crimson Fate!

As the village, where I had lived since childhood, gradually disappeared into the distance, dwindling to a tiny black dot in my memory, the feeling of separation became palpable.

Inside a horse carriage, I, Li Zhi Ming, and Da Niu gazed out at the village, while three other children cried uncontrollably. Da Niu's nose was running, and his eyes were red from crying.

The sound of their crying floated behind me, and Yang Jing Shan, who was leading the procession on horseback, looked frazzled.

"What use is this? Just gathering people like this?" he muttered to himself.

At that moment, a rider caught up to Yang Jing Shan, and they rode side by side. The rider glanced around and spoke more freely since they were among close friends. "Yang, when did the Qi Xuan Gate start accepting such children?"

The rider referred to the children as country bumpkins, implying that they were not worthy. "These rural kids are ignorant and unrefined. How many of them will be useful?"

Yang Jing Shan remained silent for a while, and the rider continued to express his discontent. "The Qi Xuan Gate used to have high standards. We would climb steep slopes with bamboo leaves sharper than knives and traverse mountains. Only those who could overcome such challenges were considered qualified."

The conversation made me feel uneasy, and I looked around at the other children in the carriage. We were all from different backgrounds, and the contrast between us was striking. Some wore fine clothes, while others, like Da Niu and me, wore tattered and dirty clothes.

The carriage was large, but it was crowded with over a dozen children. The air was thick with the smell of sweat and dirt. I sat in the corner, holding Da Niu's hand, and observed my surroundings.

The children in the carriage were divided into two groups. Three of them wore luxurious clothing and sat in the center, looking down on the others with disdain. The rest of us, including Da Niu and me, wore simple and worn-out clothes.

As the carriage journeyed on, the children began to chat and form cliques. The three well-dressed children boasted about the Qi Xuan Gate and its rigorous entrance exams. A boy from my village, named Liu Zhi, eagerly joined their conversation, trying to ingratiate himself.

I listened for a while, but their conversation seemed shallow and uninteresting. I pretended to fall asleep, trying to make sense of our situation and the mysterious Qi Xuan Gate.

The carriage ride seemed endless, and I grew tired. I glanced around and noticed that everyone had a "fate" or "命格" above their head, represented by different colored texts. Most of them were black, with a few white ones.

I was about to look away when I spotted something extraordinary. A deep crimson text hovered above a child's head. It was unlike anything I had ever seen before.

The text read: "Deep Crimson, [Fate: Great Achievements in Later Life] - 'If you remember something, it will surely come to fruition!'".

Another text caught my attention: "Deep Crimson, [Fate: Reincarnation of an Old Demon]".

I gasped in awe, feeling a mix of excitement and curiosity. I had never seen such remarkable fates before.

As I gazed at the child with the deep crimson fate, I noticed that he was ordinary-looking, with dirty hair and a thin build. He seemed to be hiding in a corner, trying to avoid attention.

Without thinking, I gently moved away from Da Niu and sat next to the child. "Hey, what's your name?" I asked softly.

The child looked up, startled, and revealed a plain face. He glanced at me, then at the small gray animal in my arms, and returned his gaze to me. He seemed wary and hesitant.

"I am Han Li," he replied quietly, before lowering his head again.

I smiled, feeling an inexplicable connection to this child. Little did I know that this chance encounter would change my life forever.
