# Chapter 14: A Surging Ambition  

At this thought, the dwarf elder's gaze toward Zhang Yan immediately turned kind.  

Currently, Zhang Yan was entirely unaware of the elder's thoughts. His full attention was fixed on the spirit mushroom before him.  

The Wood Element Technique not only promoted plant growth but could also heal injuries and cure diseases—though it was far more effective on plants. As he activated the technique, the spirit mushroom, which had been dissected earlier, began to regenerate. In just a few breaths, the damaged parts had regrown completely. The spirit mushroom was now fully restored.  

"Not bad. Although you haven't completely resolved the issue with the spirit mushrooms, you've managed to cure this individual specimen. You've done well," the dwarf elder praised, looking at Zhang Yan with approval.  

"Thank you, Senior!"  

"These spirit mushrooms appear to have been invaded by malign energy. My suggestion is to perform the same cutting treatment on all affected mushrooms. As for the cause of the invasion, I believe it's due to excessive moisture in this cultivation chamber," Zhang Yan said after a moment of contemplation.  

"Hmm? Malign energy invasion? Excessive moisture?"  

Hearing this, the dwarf elder's eyes lit up. After all, he was a genuine spirit cultivator. Though he hadn't figured it out initially, Zhang Yan's reminder made everything clear. He immediately understood the root of the problem afflicting the spirit mushrooms.  

"Excellent, truly excellent. You've passed the assessment!" The elder's face broke into an excited smile. The more he looked at Zhang Yan, the more he liked him.  

When he first saw Zhang Yan use the Wood Element Technique, he had already considered him a promising talent for spirit cultivation. But now, it seemed he had underestimated Zhang Yan's potential. Based on what he had just demonstrated, Zhang Yan not only possessed exceptional talent but also had solid practical experience.  

Though Zhang Yan's movements were swift, the elder, being a seasoned spirit cultivator himself, could tell that every action was executed with natural ease—as if Zhang Yan had been working in the fields for decades.  

If someone had previously claimed that there were "natural-born spirit cultivators" in this world, the dwarf elder would have scoffed. But now, he could confidently say that Zhang Yan was precisely that—a natural-born spirit cultivator!  

However...  

What the elder didn't know was that the reason Zhang Yan's movements seemed so practiced was not because they merely resembled decades of experience—but because they *were* the result of decades of experience.  

The spirit hoe Zhang Yan had equipped granted him decades of spirit cultivation expertise from Elder Lin. Naturally, this translated into his remarkably skilled performance.

"Since you've passed the assessment, I assume you're planning to lease spirit fields. Here, I’ll give you a bag of spirit rice seeds I cultivated myself. I hope they’ll be of use to you."  

The dwarf elder took out a small pouch from his storage bag and tossed it to Zhang Yan.  

"Don’t underestimate these seeds. They yield 10% more than ordinary spirit rice."  

"Thank you, Senior!"  

A 10% increase!  

That might not sound like much, but if Zhang Yan leased 100 acres of spirit fields, the output would be equivalent to 110 acres. It was as if he were earning an extra tenth for free.  

Considering that some novice spirit farmers were only allowed to lease 10 acres initially, Zhang Yan could effortlessly reap the benefits of an additional 10 acres just by using these seeds.  

Thinking about it this way, the value of these seeds became clear.  

"No need for thanks. I’m deeply passionate about cultivation techniques—so much so that it even delayed my own foundation-building. If you ever have questions about cultivation methods in the future, feel free to ask me." When speaking about cultivation techniques, the elder’s eyes gleamed with enthusiasm. It was evident that he truly loved the craft.  

"And you don’t need to call me 'Senior.' My name is Wang Ping. You can address me as Senior Brother Wang."  

"This..."  

"I’d prefer to call you Elder Wang," Zhang Yan said after a moment of hesitation, glancing at the elder’s age.  

"As you wish. It makes no difference to me."  

After conversing for a while longer, Zhang Yan received a token and promptly took his leave.  

---  

Returning to the Sect Affairs Hall, Zhang Yan immediately presented the token to the attendant on duty.  

"You actually passed the assessment?!"  

The attendant looked at Zhang Yan in astonishment. Though he had directed Zhang Yan to take the assessment, he hadn’t expected him to succeed—let alone so quickly.  

And the examiner had been Wang Ping, no less!  

In terms of spirit cultivation, Wang Ping was unparalleled among the outer sect disciples. Some even claimed that if not for his low cultivation level, he could rank among the top ten spirit cultivators in the entire sect, even in the inner sect.  

Whether that was true or not was debatable, but it spoke volumes about Wang Ping’s skill. Moreover, the elder took spirit cultivation extremely seriously, which was why his assessment alone was sufficient.  

Yet, this young man before him had passed the assessment in less than half the time it took an incense stick to burn.  

This was nothing short of unbelievable!  

"How many acres of spirit fields would you like to lease, Junior Brother?"  

After collecting his thoughts, the attendant asked Zhang Yan.  

"What’s the maximum I can lease?"  

"Normally, a spirit cultivator can lease up to 100 acres. But since you were certified by Senior Brother Wang, you’re eligible for 200 acres."  

Zhang Yan was momentarily stunned. He hadn’t expected Elder Wang to hold such influence—his endorsement alone doubled the leasing limit.  

"Then I’ll take 200 acres."  

Since he could lease more, Zhang Yan saw no reason to hold back.  

"How would you like to pay for the lease? Upfront with spirit stones, or a share of the harvest?"  

"How much in spirit stones?"  

"One spirit stone per acre of low-grade spirit fields per year."  

"Then I’ll choose the harvest share."  

Paying upfront would cost 200 spirit stones for 200 acres—and that was just the leasing fee. Additional expenses would include purchasing seeds and hiring laborers. With his limited funds, the harvest share was the only viable option.  

"Very well. Please sign the contract, Junior Brother."  

The attendant handed Zhang Yan a spirit contract, which he signed by infusing it with a trace of his spiritual energy.  

With the contract in hand, Zhang Yan soon located his 200 acres of spirit fields.  

The sect’s spirit fields were scattered everywhere, and Zhang Yan’s plot was situated in a remote valley at the edge of the sect, right beside the protective formation. It was a quiet, seldom-visited area.  

But for Zhang Yan, this wasn’t a bad thing.  

Standing atop the valley, overlooking the vast expanse of flat land below, Zhang Yan felt a surge of ambition.  

These 200 acres of spirit fields would be the foundation of his livelihood in this world of cultivation.
