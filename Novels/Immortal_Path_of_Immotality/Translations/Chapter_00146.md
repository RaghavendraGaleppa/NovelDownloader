# Chapter 145: The Skeleton Artillery Corps

Seeing Qi Zhong stubbornly opposing him, Lin Shan couldn't be bothered to waste more words. 

Today, no matter who came, Princess Guo was doomed. Gods would be slain if they blocked his path, Buddhas would be cut down if they stood in his way!

With a fierce wave of his Five Elements Magic Fan, a fiery phoenix soared into the sky—its sharp hooked beak, piercing eyes, radiant plumage, and flame-wreathed tail feathers all meticulously replicated by Lin Shan.

The water bear behind him, receiving its orders, bared its fangs with a ferocious roar, seemingly having long awaited this battle as it pounded its chest and charged recklessly forward.

Countless tree-men around them brandished their branches, charging fearlessly like madmen.

Luan Chun, who had been standing by earlier, now joined the fray by tossing out her illusionary handkerchief. With a spell seal, a series of mazes suddenly materialized before their opponents—clearly, she had learned much from Protector Yan's illusion techniques.

All these overwhelming attacks converged on a single target.

Princess Guo.

Lin Shan wasn't foolish enough to attack Qi Zhong directly. That guy was decked out in high-grade magical artifacts—who could rival his top-tier defensive set? 

Princess Guo, on the other hand, was already at her limit. Even if she had recovered some spiritual power earlier, it was merely a drop in the bucket. It was always better to pick the soft target, especially since she had been his original mark.

Qi Zhong watched the scene with grave concern and immediately moved to shield Princess Guo. First, he activated a jade pendant, releasing a cooling aura that dispelled the illusionary handkerchief's effects. Luan Chun pouted and reluctantly retrieved her artifact.

Next, he threw a yellow net into the air, its hazy glow blocking the firebird summoned by Lin Shan's fan.

Then, pressing a clasp on his belt, countless tiny pellets shot out, shattering the surrounding tree-men into splinters.

A jade bracelet flew from his hand, ensnaring one of the tree demons; a flick of his finger sent a ring trapping another; a teacup soared and descended to cover yet another; a miniature pagoda rose into the air...

One high-grade artifact after another was casually deployed, effortlessly countering every incoming attack and showcasing the immense wealth of a true disciple of the Qianyun Pavilion. Moreover, the ability to wield so many artifacts simultaneously spoke volumes about his formidable spiritual power.

The water bear leader, sneaking up from behind with a vicious grin, was just about to strike when Qi Zhong's scrawny donkey delivered a powerful kick, sending the bear tumbling away.

The donkey snorted, its bony frame and stick-like legs belying its surprising strength.

Yet Lin Shan remained unfazed. He produced another handful of beans and scattered them in all directions.

This time, sunflowers sprouted everywhere, their seeds shooting forth like arrows in a torrential downpour—far more overwhelming than the previous tree-men assault.

Two pea-shooter plants at the Foundation Establishment level also set up their turrets, firing human-head-sized projectiles in rapid succession.

Lin Shan smirked coldly at the yellow net shielding the duo. His Five Elements Magic Fan shimmered as a wood-element woodpecker took flight, swiftly pecking several holes in the net.

The water bear leader, having learned its lesson, charged head-on this time. The donkey spun around, seemingly only capable of its signature back kick, but was immediately slapped aside, dazed.

Seeing Lin Shan regroup, Luan Chun hesitated before gritting her teeth and rummaging through her storage pouch. She pulled out a whistle-arrow artifact given to her by Protector Yan for emergencies.

As the sole direct disciple of a Golden Core protector, she naturally had her own trump cards.

The small whistle, coated in dark yellow gilding with inscribed runes, had been entrusted to her with strict warnings about its preciousness—only to be used in dire situations.

The girl blew into it with all her might.

*"Beep beep!"*

A barrage of hair-thin black streaks shot out, instantly corroding the yellow net. Black spots spread rapidly, and within three breaths, the once-formidable high-grade earth artifact had melted into a puddle of sludge.

*"Gulp—"*

The other three present couldn't help but swallow hard. Lin Shan stared at the girl in shock—was this the ace up Protector Yan's sleeve for her disciple? 

Melting a high-grade artifact in three breaths—this was nearly on par with Qi Zhong's Gengjin Sword Qi!

Princess Guo paled at the thought—had Luan Chun used this from the start, she wouldn't have stood a chance.

Qi Zhong, however, had no time to dwell on this. As a true disciple of the Qianyun Pavilion, if nothing else, he had artifacts to spare—wealth was his forte.

He summoned a turtle-shell shield and a hexagonal token, both expanding into defensive barriers just as another wave of seeds, peas, mushrooms, peppers, and icy watermelons came raining down.

*"Bang bang bang bang!"*

The sheer force sent Qi Zhong and Princess Guo reeling, their organs rattling from the impact.

*"Beep beep!"*

Before they could catch their breath, the shield and token suddenly lightened—transparent holes appeared before the artifacts dissolved entirely, leaving behind two more puddles of black sludge.

---

Two more high-grade defensive artifacts, treasures most Foundation Establishment cultivators could only dream of, had been effortlessly destroyed.

Luan Chun stood proudly in the distance, hands on her hips and the whistle between her lips, while Lin Shan showered her with praise, delighting the girl to no end.

As another storm of projectiles approached, Qi Zhong produced a red cape and threw it over himself. He couldn't afford to stay on the defensive—his artifacts wouldn't last forever.

With a pained look, he glanced at the golden glimmer spinning around his finger—the Gengjin Sword Qi, a life-saving technique bestowed by his sect elders. Against anything below Golden Core, it was virtually unstoppable.

He only had three uses, and he'd already expended one earlier to save Princess Guo from Lin Shan's blade.

Now, to maximize its effectiveness, he aimed it squarely at Luan Chun.

That damned whistle of hers was far too dangerous—it was practically a shield-breaker!

Luan Chun was basking in Lin Shan's praise when a flash of gold suddenly streaked toward her, accompanied by a deafening metallic clang.

*"Clang!"*

Lin Shan stood beside her, the broken-water sword in hand, as if he'd been waiting all along.

Qi Zhong's eyes widened in disbelief as the golden light returned to his finger, its glow significantly dimmed. His Gengjin Sword Qi, capable of cleaving through high-grade artifacts, had been effortlessly blocked! Could that sword be... a Golden Core-level treasure?

As a true disciple of the Qianyun Pavilion, one of the elite among tens of thousands, Qi Zhong's intellect was as sharp as his cultivation. He'd thoroughly investigated Princess Guo's past, including her feud with Lin Shan.

This brat was just a rogue cultivator from the Lin Clan of the Southern Border. Even if he had a cousin in the Purple Mist Sect, there was no way he should be this loaded—Foundation Establishment early-stage with a menagerie of artifacts, spirit beasts, puppets, and even a treasure?!

Most Qianyun Pavilion disciples didn't even possess treasures!

Treasures weren't something money could buy—they were typically exchanged between high-level cultivators or custom-forged by master artificers at great cost.

How could this penniless punk have one?!

---

The tables had turned. Luan Chun, grateful for Lin Shan's timely rescue, clung to him fearfully, showering him with flattery lest Qi Zhong send another sword qi her way.

Seeing their camaraderie, Qi Zhong abandoned all hesitation. Ignoring the barrage of attacks and leaving his donkey to the water bear's mercy, he grabbed Princess Guo and fled.

But before they could cover even a hundred meters, radiant lights erupted across the landscape—a dazzling formation activating in an instant.

Qi Zhong, well-read as a major sect disciple, recognized it immediately and nearly fainted from terror.

The Inverted Five Elements Formation!

*"Heh heh heh!"*

A pitch-black skeleton stood nonchalantly ahead, a bone banner slung over its shoulder as if it had been lying in wait. Unnoticed, it had set up this ambush long ago.

Behind it, rows of skeletal soldiers stood in formation beside ballistae, their dark barrels aimed squarely at the fleeing pair, stacks of enchanted ammunition piled nearby.

*"Ready—"*

*"Fire!"*

Each skeleton had its role—some loaded ammunition, others aimed, while yet others pulled triggers.

*"Fire!"*

With a series of deafening booms, multicolored projectiles streaked through the air.

Before Qi Zhong and Princess Guo could react, explosions blossomed around them like fireworks.

For the first time, they experienced the might of orthodox sect-crafted runic artillery, their ears ringing and vision blurring from the concussive blasts.

Then, amidst the thunderous barrage, they plummeted from the sky.
