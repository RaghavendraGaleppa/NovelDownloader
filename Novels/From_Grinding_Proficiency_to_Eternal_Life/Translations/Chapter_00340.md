# Chapter 340: This is a Struggle of the Dao

Cinan’s muscles swelled with power, his face alight with joy. If he could defeat Xu Yunfan, he too would receive the infusion of Xuanhuang Qi.

However, Cui Yu shook his head. “Xuan Yunfan has the Dragon Scale Armor protecting him...”

Cinan felt a flash of displeasure. “This won’t work, that won’t work. Is the Great Zhou court just going to sit by and watch its own destruction?”

Cui Yu’s face instantly chilled. He stared fixedly at Cinan, murderous intent in his eyes completely unrestrained. Only when Cinan averted his gaze did Cui Yu reach into his robes and produce a jade seal carved with the image of the Bi’An beast. “This is the ‘Suppressing Dragon Seal’ specially bestowed by His Majesty. It can temporarily suppress Xuanhuang Qi. As for Xu Yunfan...”

He looked at Cinan and Yan Tieshan, a faint smile touching his lips. “Xuanhuang Qi is a fine thing. Perhaps the Land Immortal who hasn't appeared for a thousand years will emerge from among you.”

Upon hearing these words, everyone couldn't help but hold their breath. Cui Yu watched this, sneering coldly in his heart.

***

Inside Yujing City, Xu Yunfan let out a long breath, his gaze fixed on the Great Zhou Imperial Court and its ninefold palaces. To endure and retreat like this did not align with his style, especially given his current strength. Moreover, if the Great Zhou Imperial Court managed to stall him through schemes, it would likely lead to unnecessary complications.

Since the Xuanhuang Qi had refined his entire body, the true Qi within him had become as vast as an abyss. Every inch of his flesh surged with immense, unrivaled power, and his movements carried the potential of wind and thunder. At this moment, he was like a blade drawn half an inch from its sheath; though he hadn't exerted his full strength, the surrounding spiritual energy already trembled in response.

He suddenly turned his head, his gaze like a tempered blade piercing directly into Chen Wei.

Chen Wei’s knuckles turned white as the black longspear in his hand trembled with a hum. He forced out a fierce shout from his throat, “Xu Yunfan! What do you want to do?!”

Xu Yunfan’s robes fluttered as the overwhelmingly tyrannical Ten Extremes True Qi condensed into a tangible vortex around him.

“The Dao Sect sent me to the peak of the Ninth Realm with the power of their entire sect, hoping to reopen the path to the Land Immortal Realm. Since you all...”

He took half a step forward, and the floor tiles cracked under his foot. “...lack the courage to kill me and lack the strength to slay me, then today, I shall clear away these obstacles blocking my path.”

As his words fell, Xu Yunfan drew the撼岳镇海锤 (Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer) and strode forward with large steps.

The moment his foot crushed the floor tiles, his figure instantly appeared before Chen Wei. The Ten Extremes True Qi around him erupted like a volcano. The true Qi poured into the hammer, condensing a tangible aura of malice at its锋 (edge).

Chen Wei’s pupils contracted violently. He had no time to parry with his black longspear; the dragon patterns on the spear shaft sparked as they were compressed by the force.

The Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer fell, carrying the momentum of a collapsing mountain and a roaring tsunami.

Chen Wei’s arm muscles bulged, true Qi flared, and the spear light flickered. The instant the spear shaft collided with the hammer face, the bluestone tiles within three zhang of his feet collapsed into a crater. The shockwave flipped a row of crossbowmen at the edge of the training platform.

Chen Wei’s tiger’s mouth split open. The spear body emitted a metal groan as if it couldn't bear the load. He discovered in horror that his true Qi, like snow meeting boiling water, was being directly evaporated by the Ten Extremes True Qi wrapped around the hammer!

“Can’t take it?” Xu Yunfan’s eyes were indifferent. “I only used thirty percent of my strength.”

Chen Wei’s face instantly flushed red.

“You are courting death!”

Chen Wei roared and urged his entire body’s true Qi, the tip of his spear bursting with seven feet of black芒 (light), attempting to attack as defense. But when the hammer’s aura struck his body, it was like thin ice hitting an iron anvil.

Before the hammer edge even arrived, the violent true Qi first shattered his protective aura.

The Seventh Rank Divine Weapon was snapped in half by this single hammer blow!

Chen Wei’s chest armor caved in, the sound of his ribs breaking like a string of firecrackers. As he flew backward spewing blood, his eyes reflected Xu Yunfan’s indifferent face. The giant hammer was tearing through the air to pursue him.

This final hammer was no longer within the realm of human power.

Xu Yunfan’s arm muscles twisted like coiled dragon sinews. The Ten Extremes True Qi compressed at the hammer head into a scorching white wave of air. As the hammer fell, it actually drew in the currents of the ten directions; the visible ripples of air split like water waves, yet they sucked in air like a whale, feeding into the hammer’s momentum.

Chen Wei desperately unleashed the royal family’s secret technique, the “Black Tortoise Suppressing Hell Art,” but upon contact with this heavy hammer, it was like an ant trying to shake a mountain. His true Qi, flesh, and bones collapsed layer by layer under the crushing force of ten thousand jun. Ultimately, his entire body exploded into a mist of blood. The remaining obsidian spear tip didn't even have time to fall before it was ground into flying iron filings by the hammer wind.

The residual hammer force spread out in a fan shape. The heavily armored cavalry of the Imperial Guard, watching from thirty zhang away, were flipped over along with their horses.

Xu Yunfan retracted his hammer and stood firm. Beneath his feet was a spider-webbed crater with a radius of ten zhang. Where Chen Wei had stood, only a pool of blood seeping into the ground cracks remained.

As he shook the residual blood off the hammer, his muscle lines seemed cast in molten gold under the Ten Extremes True Qi. Every inch of his physique pulsed with a suffocating aesthetic of violence.

The field fell into a sudden silence, followed by an explosion of panicked cries like a tidal wave. The martial artists who had been craning their necks and standing on tiptoes just moments ago now scattered in panic as if seeing a plague god. The crowd split into ragged fissures of terror.

How could ordinary martial artists hope to witness the life-and-death struggle of a Ninth Realm Qi Refining Supreme Grandmaster? Merely being able to watch the battle on the stage was already a stroke of supreme luck.

The remaining aura swept over the stands, and the bluestone ground silently cracked. Someone who fled a step too slow had their shoulder grazed by the leaking true Qi; their face instantly turned deathly pale as they knelt and vomited blood. The sound of bones shattering echoed in their chest cavity, as if their internal organs had been crushed by an invisible heavy hammer.

“Retreat! Retreat another thirty zhang!” Amidst the hoarse shouts, the crowd stumbled and knocked over the weapon racks at the edge of the training ground. The cold iron spear shafts clattered to the ground, actually cracking like spider webs under the residual pressure.

It was only then that the group of white-haired old eunuchs suddenly turned back. One of them, whose body churned with Yin Sha true Qi, shrieked in a sharp voice, “How dare you!!”

“Another Ninth Realm?!”

Xu Yunfan raised his brow, a flash of surprise in his eyes. He looked the hunched, withered eunuch up and down and said in surprise, “The Ninth Realms of your Great Zhou Imperial Court, do they grow out of the ground? Why do they keep popping out one after another?”

The old eunuch was hunched and his face was withered, but the aura of a Ninth Realm Qi Refining Grandmaster flowed faintly around him. However, that true Qi was as flimsy as floss, weak as if it would disperse with a single gust of wind, a far cry from the pressure of a true Ninth Realm.

“Heh...”

Xu Yunfan sneered, his five fingers slowly tightening as the Ten Extremes True Qi coiled around the Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer like an angry dragon. “A group of false realms, and you dare act arrogant in front of me?”

Before the words had fully faded, Xu Yunfan’s figure had already exploded like thunder, leaving only an afterimage at his original spot.

The old eunuch’s turbid pupils contracted violently, his withered fingers barely lifting half an inch.

“Boom!”

The Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer, carrying the violent malice of the Ten Extremes True Qi, crashed down like a meteor falling to earth.

Before the hammer edge arrived, the劲 wind (strong wind) had already crushed the old eunuch’s hunched body, causing his bones to crack. The bluestone tiles beneath his feet shattered inch by inch.

Facing the heavy hammer head-on, the power of the earth’s veins hummed and contracted, condensing into a tangible vortex. Wherever it passed, the air was sucked into a vacuum, emitting a ghostly wail.

The old eunuch hastily crossed his two palms. A wisp of ghostly blue fire burst forth from his chicken-claw-like knuckles, attempting to use his Yin-dampening true Qi to corrode the hammer’s aura.

However, this hammer of Xu Yunfan’s was a force of a thousand jun driven by the Ten Extremes True Qi. Before the hammer edge even arrived, the violent aura had already crushed the old eunuch’s bones with a crackling sound!
