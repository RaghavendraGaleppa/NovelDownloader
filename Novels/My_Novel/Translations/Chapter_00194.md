# Chapter 194: Fierce Might and a Final Resolution

The lake was surrounded by a vast host, a truly magnificent sight.

Cao Shuang looked out over the expanse. His clan's soldiers were robust, and the府兵 (militia) were fully equipped. All wore iron armor, carried fine steel blades, and held powerful bows. A surge of pride swelled in his heart.

"So what if you are formidable? Every prominent clan in the prefecture city maintains its own clan soldiers. These are handpicked elites, meticulously trained! At my command, a rain of arrows will pour down from all directions. What will you do then?"

"Even if we cannot harm you, we have subsequent measures for you to taste one by one. How can you, alone, block them all? You, the Lady of the Broken Sword, are indeed powerful, but you only need to set foot on the shore. Our militia will form their formations, and I, Cao Shuang, will personally enter the阵 (formation). Combined with our special military artifacts and water-combat weapons, we shall make you understand our might!"

The Lady of Warmth smiled. "What a hero of the prefecture city. Your earlier suggestion to spread out was a ruse to trap this young woman in the lake."

The Cao family's old matriarch was gravely injured, her liver and spleen shattered. However, her martial foundation was deep. After taking a healing elixir, she could now speak. She cursed, "You wretch! Brave but foolish, this is what you deserve!"

"If you die in the lake, that would be for the best. If you fall into my hands, I will shatter every bone in your body, pulverize your internal organs, and ensure you die a miserable death!"

Beside them, the master smith Ye Zi felt a chill run down his spine. "If I had known this would happen, I wouldn't have wanted the Golden Scale. This... this Cao matriarch... she's truly... truly audacious. Even with the Lady in a perilous situation, she dares to speak to her like that. There's always a chance, however small!"

The Lady of Warmth asked, "Xiao Xian, what do you think?"

Li Xian saw the arrowheads aimed from all sides. No matter how tight the defense, a myriad of arrows would surely find a gap. He also saw the deep, emerald-green water, several zhang deep. "My Lady, we can dive into the water to avoid the arrows, then swim to the shore to find a path out."

"You..." The Lady of Warmth pointed towards the shore. "Your experience is too shallow. You might avoid the first trap, but it will be hard to evade the second."

"Diving into the lake can indeed avoid the rain of arrows, but it puts you at a passive disadvantage. These great clans of the prefecture will have the [Dragon Gate Formation] and [Phoenix Gate Formation] set up on the shore. Why do you think those two tall buildings by the shore were built? The great clans of this city were prepared long ago. Those buildings occupy high ground by the shore and conceal many intricate mechanisms."

"They can also place water-combat weapons several li from the shore, covered in sharp iron spikes. Then, the clan elders will be equipped with tough catching nets, filled with poison that can paralyze the body, waiting by the shore."

"If you swim to the shore, the clan elders will cast their nets. The clan soldiers will form formations to kill you. Let's not even talk about these two threats. Just the water-combat weapons and the ground full of spikes alone would catch you off guard."

"If you stay潜 in the water, they can pour poison into it, which takes effect upon contact with skin. Moreover, a martial artist in water is never as agile as on land. Leaping from the water, you cannot fly very high."

"By then, there will be no path to the heavens and no door to the earth."

Li Xian asked, "Then, in your opinion, what should we do?"

The Lady of Warmth chided, "You brat, are you questioning me now?"

Li Xian smiled. "I cannot figure it out, please teach me, My Lady."

The Lady of Warmth's lips curved into a smile as she lightly tapped a finger. "There is much you still need to learn. Sigh... under these circumstances... I have no choice but to teach you."

Cao Shuang saw the two whispering, their conversation intimate, with no sign of panic or helplessness in the face of danger. He roared in fury, "You two dogs! On the brink of death, you still dare to be so arrogant, looking down on us! Release the arrows!"

"Release the arrows!"

"Release the arrows!"

He shouted three times, but no arrows flew. Ye Zi shook his head and sighed, remarking, "As expected, as expected. The Lady of the Broken Sword is a deep thinker. For her to show herself, she must have had a foolproof plan."

Suddenly, the府兵 and clan soldiers on the lake shore turned pale with blueish lips, foaming at the mouth. They collapsed one after another, unconscious. A few, before losing consciousness, loosened their bowstrings, sending a sparse shower of arrows flying. But they were completely off target.

Li Xian was secretly shocked. "Poison? When? On such a scale? How was it administered?"

The Lady of Warmth looked at Cao Shuang and smiled. "I originally intended to take the Golden Scale and leave. But you insisted on keeping me, so I stayed a while longer."

Cao Shuang's face was a mask of horror. He was powerless, the situation completely reversed.

It turned out the Lady of Warmth had anticipated this. She had ordered people to carry a strange fragrance, who then blended into the crowd. The toxic scent spread across the lake shore, affecting everyone who came.

Cao Shuang trembled. "La... Lady Warmth, you... you are superior. In the end, we... we were all driven by greed for treasure. The Golden Scale is yours, please... please just go."

The Marquis of Yuwen, seeing he was far from the Lady, immediately steered his boat to flee, moving at incredible speed, splashing water.

The Lady of Warmth said, "Good hero, please stop." Her palm turned, shooting out a jade bead. With a *pfft*, it embedded itself in the Marquis's arm.

The jade bead contained a powerful surge of internal energy. It exploded within his flesh and blood with a *crack*, shattering the Marquis's right arm.

He cried out in pain. The Lady of Warmth flicked her finger again, and another jade bead flew into his mouth, lodging under his tongue. The Marquis was terrified and speechless. He knew that if the jade bead shattered, his head would explode, and he would have no life left.

He immediately dared not run anymore. He sat down, using all his internal energy to suppress the energy within the jade bead.

In this state, he was immobile, as if his mouth were stuffed with explosives. He was in endless agony, having truly learned the Lady's methods. His heart was filled with bitterness, not knowing how long he could live or what a miserable end awaited him.

The elder of the Chu clan also tried to flee, meeting a similar fate. The elders of the prefecture city were out of tricks, and reinforcements would not arrive for a long time. Moreover, the Lady's schemes had already sealed their fate.

Each one looked as if they were wearing mourning garments, their faces ashen, on the verge of tears but unable to cry.

Ye Zi said, "My Lady, this matter has nothing to do with me. Can... can I leave first? Another day... after I forge a fine artifact, I will come to you to apologize?"

The Lady of Warmth said, "Since you are already here, what's the harm in staying to watch?"

Ye Zi let out a long breath, his heart suspended in the air. Li Xian was in charge of rowing. The Lady of Warmth stood at the prow of the boat, her long dress fluttering, breathtakingly beautiful.

Cao Shuang and the other clan elders huddled together, gripped by immense terror, their legs weak. The most affected was the Cao family's old matriarch.

The light boat drew near. The Lady of Warmth looked at the old matriarch and said, "I was careless in injuring you earlier, my apologies."

"It... it's nothing?" the Cao matriarch said.

"I have a box of Green Miao Spirit Fungus for you to take. Circulate your internal energy with it, and it will immediately nourish your liver and protect your spleen. Your liver and spleen will be fully healed." The Lady's voice was gentle.

She handed the dark green box to Li Xian, who passed it over. The Cao matriarch was stunned and confused. She took the Green Miao Spirit Fungus and, as she circulated her internal energy with it, her liver and spleen indeed gradually improved.

The Cao clan elders all thought: "Could it be... that the Lady of Warmth is actually unwilling to start a conflict with the Cao family? Her intention before was to show her might, but now she means to resolve the grudge. In that case... we should take the opportunity to end this feud quickly. The Lady of the Broken Sword is truly terrifying!"

Their minds were put at ease.

The Lady of Warmth said, "But on that note, you said earlier, if you were to capture me, what would you do?"

The Cao matriarch said, "That... that was all a joke, please, My Lady, do not— *Ah!*"

The Lady of Warmth struck with a palm from a distance. The Cao matriarch screamed and collapsed onto the boat. Her bones were all shattered, and she could no longer move.

The Lady of Warmth said, "Although your bones are shattered, with a great elixir in the future, you might still recover. I must also... ruin your purity and turbidity, and disrupt your Yin and Yang."

She scooped up a handful of lake water, steamed it into vapor in her palm, which lingered without dispersing. She slapped her palm down, driving the vapor into the old woman's body. The vapor would not dissipate for a long time, secretly containing the "change of Yin and Yang," alternating between clear and murky, and the "distinction of purity and turbidity."

Ye Zi was skilled at forging artifacts. The principles of martial arts and the essence of techniques were not his forte. But he vaguely saw the implications and was secretly shocked. "The Lady of the Broken Sword's martial arts have become even more profound!"

The old woman was in unspeakable agony, alternating between hot and cold, between pain and itch. The Lady of Warmth said, "You wanted to kill me, but today I do not wish to take a life. After some thought... since the three of you share the same surname and clan, you shall share the same fate."

"Lady Warmth, no... no..." Cao Shuang cried in terror. He tried to fight back, but he was like a fish on a chopping block.

His bones were shattered, the Yin and Yang in his body were reversed, and his purity and turbidity were indistinguishable. With the power of the Cao name in the prefecture city, it would be difficult to cure him. And Cao Shuang and the others were second-realm martial artists, with long lifespans. The rest of their lives would be filled with torment.

Li Xian rowed the boat away, heading towards the Lin family. The Lady of Warmth said to Lin Bei, "Although you joined them in opposing me, you did not make me too disgusted. Today, I will sever one of your arms and one of your legs."

Lin Bei's chin had been sliced off, so he could not speak. He glanced at the Cao family's people and thought that having his limbs crippled was still better than having his bones shattered and becoming a complete废人 (cripple). This outcome was already decent. He slowly nodded.

"Xiao Xian, you come," the Lady of Warmth said.

Li Xian had no choice but to comply. Lin Bei did not dare to resist, allowing Li Xian to sever his arm and leg.

"He is the same," the Lady of Warmth said, pointing to another Lin family elder.

The elder sighed and said, "I am convinced of the Lady's methods. I will do it myself." He turned his right hand into a blade and chopped off his own left hand.

"Who told you to do it? Severing one hand does not count. Xiao Xian, you do it," the Lady said gently.

"This..." The elder did not know the Lady's temperament. He had lost another hand for nothing.

The Chu and Yuwen families also received their retribution. The lighter cases involved severed limbs, while the heavier ones entailed a lifetime of suffering. The four great clans suffered heavy casualties.

The pond's water was dyed red with blood.

Ye Zi said, "My Lady... the schemes of these great clans have nothing to do with me. I... I was just here for a share of the spoils."

"Fair enough. Master Smith Ye Zi, I, Cai Shang, hold you in high regard," the Lady of Warmth said. "I have heard that Master Smith Ye Zi possesses the [Rebirth Phase], and your index finger is tempered like gold, known as the [Five Bone Finger Phase]. It can perceive the changes in the heat of the forge. Cai Shang wishes to borrow it for a look."

Ye Zi's expression changed. He felt a pain in his finger, and his index finger had already fallen into the water. The Lady of Warmth handed a white silk ribbon to Li Xian and said, "Xiao Xian, wrap this finger up."

Ye Zi was angry but dared not speak, remaining silent. Li Xian fished the finger out. It was quite strange: the finger had five joints, thick at the front and thin at the back, its bone tough and golden, faintly visible through the skin.

The Lady of Warmth said, "Let's go." Li Xian rowed the boat towards the shore. Along the way, he saw all kinds of miserable sights. Suddenly, he said, "My Lady, there is one matter I have yet to complete."

"What matter?" the Lady asked.

Li Xian said, "That Sunken River Sword, by right, should be mine."

"A small matter," the Lady of Warmth said with a嗔 (chiding) smile. "Since it is yours, you may simply go and take it. Why do you need to ask me?"

Li Xian rowed the boat over and said to Zhou Shijie, "Brother Zhou, please hand over the sword!"

"Yes... yes," Zhou Shijie said, offering it with both hands. Li Xian took the Sunken River Sword and felt its peerless sharpness, his spirits soaring instantly.

He played with the water with the sword, moving with natural fluency. After a moment of this, he rowed the boat to the shore.

And so, they departed before the eyes of all.
