# Chapter 4: Replication Once More

"Whoosh!"

A crimson sword light streaked across the sky as the rotund Mo departed, taking with him all eight hundred catties of spirit rice that Lu Xu had produced. In exchange, Lu Xu now held three additional spirit stones in his hand.

"With these three, my total savings reach forty-one spirit stones!"

"Ah, and let's not forget the two hundred catties of spirit rice I've hidden away!"

A smile spread across Lu Xu's face—finally, he could afford to eat spirit rice regularly. At his current cultivation level, about a hundred catties per year would suffice to meet his bodily needs. Considering he'd only entered the world of immortal cultivation a year and a half ago, accumulating forty-one spirit stones was no small feat. Had he remained a simple spirit farmer, such savings would have taken three to four years.

"But this is merely the beginning," Lu Xu mused to himself. Each year granted him one opportunity to replicate another's experience—last year's had been spent, but this year's remained unused. Another replication would further elevate his success rate in talisman crafting. The thought alone filled him with eager anticipation.

Retrieving the hidden spirit rice from the cellar of his fieldside hut, Lu Xu carried it back to his home in the market district. In the kitchen, he measured out a bowl of the precious grains, added water, and lit the fire. Soon, a rich, enticing aroma filled the air. The plump, jade-green grains glistened invitingly, eliciting an audible growl from his stomach.

Without bothering with condiments, Lu Xu devoured the plain rice straight from the bowl. The explosion of flavor on his tongue was unlike anything he'd ever tasted. No wonder most cultivators disdained mundane food—once one experienced spirit-infused sustenance, how could ordinary fare compare?

A single bowl left him pleasantly full. He ascended to the second floor of his modest two-story house—the lower level served as storage and kitchen, while the upper contained his bedroom and meditation chamber. Settling into the latter, Lu Xu crossed his legs and began circulating the Verdant Wood Scripture. As the technique flowed through him, tendrils of cool spiritual energy entered his body, cycling through his meridians before condensing into a wisp of green qi that settled into his dantian.

The pea-sized green qi cluster in his dantian showed no visible change from this minuscule addition. When Lu Xu opened his eyes, two hours had passed.

"My foundation grows firmer. The path is long, but I'll reach the peak eventually," he murmured, exhaling slowly.

Turning his focus inward, Lu Xu examined the cyan stele within his consciousness. The entry for his cultivation technique read:

[Technique: Verdant Wood Scripture (Novice) 28/100]

"If I can increase my proficiency with the Verdant Wood Scripture, my cultivation speed should improve significantly," he reasoned. "As one of the most common techniques, there must be many practitioners in the market. I can try replicating their experiences later. For now, improving my talisman crafting takes priority."

The following day, in the trading district...

"Little Lu, what brings you here today?" Old Man Xu greeted as Lu Xu approached, waving a hand in recognition.

"Just admiring the skills of master talisman crafters like yourself," Lu Xu replied, his gaze sweeping the area with apparent admiration. "I wonder when I'll reach your level."

Old Man Xu shook his head with a chuckle. "Still clinging to that dream? I'll be frank—unless you're willing to waste over a hundred spirit stones and thousands of talisman papers, forget about becoming a proper talisman master. Do you know how much a spirit farmer earns annually? Even if you poured every scrap into materials, it wouldn't be enough—especially without proper guidance."

The old man launched into a lecture, convinced Lu Xu's ambitions were delusional. At least he himself had received instruction from the Divine Talisman Hall. Future generations of his family would benefit from his knowledge—this was the advantage of lineage. Most skilled talisman crafters among rogue cultivators built their expertise over generations. How could one man hope to match centuries of accumulated knowledge?

"Ah well, I can't give up without trying. I've already succeeded in making a few talismans," Lu Xu countered, watching as Old Man Xu briskly sold talisman after talisman.

"This old fox is wealthier than he lets on," Lu Xu realized. Having dipped his toes into talisman crafting, he now understood the staggering fortune the unassuming old man must possess. Despite his frugal appearance—looking like someone you couldn't squeeze two taels of oil from—Old Man Xu likely hoarded hundreds of spirit stones. Undoubtedly the richest resident in their compound.

"No wonder he never leaves the market—with that much wealth, he'd be a prime target for bandits," Lu Xu mused, growing wary. The adventurers who regularly bought talismans were precisely the type who might turn to robbery if the opportunity arose. If Lu Xu started selling talismans regularly, he'd face similar risks. Unlike Old Man Xu, he had no intention of becoming a market-bound hermit.

"I'll need to disguise myself," he decided.

Old Man Xu's voice interrupted his thoughts. "Heard you've been selling some talismans lately. A lucky success or two means nothing—what matters is consistent results. How much have you lost making those few talismans?"

Lu Xu's expression darkened. His face twitched before he sighed heavily. "Over twenty spirit stones already."

"Where'd you get that kind of money?" Old Man Xu looked genuinely surprised.

With visible discomfort, Lu Xu admitted in a hushed tone, "I... took out some spirit stone loans."

"You what? Have you gone mad?" The old man gaped. "Those loans are dangerous! You gambled without even knowing if you have talent?"

"I couldn't resign myself to farming forever. Sometimes you have to take risks."

"And if you fail?"

"Then I'm at their mercy," Lu Xu said with forced resignation.

"With your mid-grade spiritual roots... what a waste," Old Man Xu lamented, shaking his head.

A new voice interjected: "Well said, young man! Life sometimes demands bold gambles."

Turning, Lu Xu saw a middle-aged man with an unsightly black mole by his mouth smiling at them.

"May I ask who...?" Lu Xu cupped his hands politely.

"Master Song, a far superior talisman master to this old man," Old Man Xu introduced.

"Seeing you reminds me of my great-grandfather," Master Song said nostalgically. "He too took out loans to pursue talisman crafting, founding our family's legacy."

"So he succeeded in his gamble?" Lu Xu feigned interest.

"Indeed. Through four generations, our success rate has grown from five percent to over twenty," Master Song declared proudly. Their family name carried weight in the market. With continued effort, they might produce a mid-grade talisman master in coming generations.

As Master Song recounted his family's arduous rise, Lu Xu listened respectfully while thinking, "You're the one."

"View Talisman Crafting Experience."

A flash of cyan light revealed:

[Lower First-grade Talisman Master: 24/100]

Master Song's expertise was substantial indeed.

"Your family's history is truly inspiring. I must return to my practice—perhaps I too can forge a path for future generations," Lu Xu said courteously before purchasing four hundred sheets of talisman paper from an elderly vendor.

Returning home, he immediately invested twenty-four spirit stones into the cyan stele, leaving him with only seven. The next day, he returned to hear Master Song expound further on family legacies.

Then—"Replicate!"

Cyan light flashed as a torrent of knowledge flooded from Master Song into Lu Xu's mind. While maintaining an attentive facade, Lu Xu absorbed the influx of expertise.

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, he returned home and checked his status:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 16/103]
[Cultivation: Qi Refining First Layer]
[Spiritual Roots: Wood (Mid-Low)]
[Technique: Verdant Wood Scripture (Novice) 28/100]
[Replication Points: 0]
[Skills—Spells:]
Minor Cloud Rain Technique (Novice): 82/100
Geng Metal Sword (Novice): 67/100
Sharpness Technique (Novice): 51/100
[Skills—Talisman Crafting:]
Lower First-grade Talisman Master: 27/100

His talisman crafting proficiency had leapt from 5 to 27—likely not reaching 29 due to overlapping knowledge between Old Man Xu and Master Song.

"A success rate approaching thirty percent—what a leap!" Lu Xu couldn't suppress his joy. This multiplication of efficiency meant his income would increase severalfold. And with his next replication, he might advance to mid-grade talisman master!
