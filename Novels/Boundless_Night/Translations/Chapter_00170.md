# Chapter 170: A Galaxy of Stars

In the night mist, a group of young men and women excitedly discussed, longing for the Kunling region.

Naturally, what they talked about most was the Auspicious Beast.

A young man in yellow splashed cold water on their excitement, saying, "Why are you so thrilled? Is the Auspicious Beast truly easy to kill? Moreover, it's an ancient beast that has survived countless ages unscathed; it's a creature at the top of the pyramid."

Many people nodded in agreement, acknowledging his point.

Clearly, this group had done their homework and knew quite a bit about Kunling even before arriving.

A young woman in green spoke up, "This time, there should be a chance. The senior elders from various Daoist academies and academic institutions will unite, and it can be considered a pioneering battle."

The Auspicious Beast resided outside a forbidden zone. For years, the major Daoist academies and academic institutions had wanted to expand into that area but had always been very cautious. This time, it seemed they had made up their minds.

"The outer region of the forbidden zone is a plateau rich in various herbs, and there are even some secret realms. However, normally no one dares to approach it. Besides the Auspicious Beast, there are also various demons there. Most of us will likely have the opportunity to participate in clearing out the non-humans. This counts as a form of pioneering. Those who perform exceptionally well can receive the Auspicious Beast's blood, thereby enhancing their aptitude, or even achieving direct nirvana."

Many people were surprised: Was the Kunling region that vast?
Qin Ming was also somewhat bewildered by what he heard.

"Kunling is quite extensive and special. It has three forbidden zones, a concentration unprecedented elsewhere. At the same time, there are over a dozen Daoist academies and higher academic institutions, which is also quite extraordinary. Furthermore, there are two blessed lands there, which is even more unexpected."

Because of the high number of forbidden zones, even though the Yu, Qian, and Rui Dynasties all bordered the area, they dared not lay claim to that territory.

According to the records in *The Ten Continents in the Seas: Jukuzhou*, Kunling is located in the west of the Western Sea and the north of the Northern Sea, thirteen hundred thousand li from the shore.

Qin Ming was lost in thought, hearing the two girls next to him discussing *The Ten Continents in the Seas*. He felt as if parts of the deeper areas of the Night Mist World were being included in this record.

"The Great Pioneering Era hasn't even arrived yet, and we're already going to pioneer the forbidden zones. How exciting! I'm willing to be the vanguard!" A hot-blooded young man in black rubbed his fists together, his expression very excited.

Someone laughed and teased him, "Wake up, young man. So impulsive, you might be among the first batch of cannon fodder."

"Is it good to kill the Auspicious Beast?" a young woman in white whispered.

Someone informed her, "When it first appeared years ago, purple qi came from the east, which is why it was called an Auspicious Beast. In truth, it has caused more harm than some of the truly ancient demons. It's like a 'god-like' creature; even though it carries the word 'god,' its appearance often brings great catastrophe. And this Auspicious Beast is actually one of Kunling's Ten Scourges."

Just then, a female voice, with a powerful spiritual consciousness transmission, announced, "Attention passengers heading to Kunling: The Vermilion Bird Airship is now boarding."

Immediately, the young people who had been enthusiastically discussing all set off, walking towards a colossal fiery-red airship in the distance.

Indeed, a large group of young people were almost all traveling on the same ship, and even more peers appeared in the distance, some from VIP rooms, some having just arrived.

The ship's hull was incredibly vast, inscribed with intricate runes.

As they boarded, Qin Ming saw people transporting strange energy sources. They were all precisely square and regular, either glowing silvery-white or shimmering golden-yellow, quite aesthetically pleasing.

If he hadn't known beforehand, it would be hard to imagine that these were all pieces of wood cut from trees.

"Dear passengers, the Vermilion Bird Airship departs from Xixia City and will land at Kunling Grand City, a total journey of twenty-one thousand five hundred li."

Compared to higher-level non-humans, this speed was quite slow.

People were mentally prepared for this. Moreover, they weren't taking the ship simply to save time; they had another purpose. During the journey, the Vermilion Bird Airship would hover in the night sky, possibly to receive "Tianhua"—a spiritual liquid that senior elders from outside the world usually drank like water.

Three quarters of an hour later, the Vermilion Bird Airship ascended, gradually disappearing into the dense night.

Looking around, there were over five hundred people in the cabin's seats, at least four hundred of whom were young, full of vigor and vitality, which made the cabin incredibly lively.

Additionally, there were higher-class cabins with beds and bathrooms.

However, for cultivators, three days was nothing, and ordinary seats were sufficient.

Qin Ming found that the ship ticket Meng Xinghai gave him included a lounge in the higher-class cabin, but also corresponded to an ordinary seat, implying a desire for him to experience both.

He temporarily sat in the main cabin, listening to the discussions of his peers, gathering much information about Kunling.

After discussing the Auspicious Beast, some young people brought up the topic of non-humans.

"After the Great Pioneering, non-humans can generally coexist peacefully with us."

Someone nodded, "Of course. Those who can't coexist are considered demons and will be dealt with quickly."

"Don't laugh, this topic is actually quite heavy. Thinking back, we were almost at a critical juncture of racial survival. Later, we finally stabilized, so we naturally have to be ruthless when dealing with demons."

Someone gave an example: early, extremely dangerous giant beasts and plant life as huge as mountains were no longer seen. That was the result of fierce battles.

"Now, non-humans deep in the mountains still have friction with people outside, but there won't be any daring to slaughter cities. Otherwise, they would surely be wiped clean. So, many non-humans are now actively transforming into human form and integrating with us. Oh, excuse me, I didn't realize I was sitting next to a fox fairy. My apologies."

The young man speaking just noticed that the person in the seat next to him was a beautiful girl with a pure white fox tail.

"It's fine. Many humans are also transforming into beasts, embarking on paths of mutation. You are in me, I am in you; this is quite normal." The fox girl was calm, her skin fair, and her white fox tail gave her a mysterious and extraordinary aura.

She continued, "In fact, some of your Path-breakers have also transformed into beasts. Hmm, some of us non-humans have transformed into humans and have even become ancestral masters or senior elders on your side. It's hard to distinguish between humans and non-humans now."

Immediately, someone refuted this, disliking such talk. "Impossible! How could there be non-humans among Path-breakers or ancestral masters?"

Qin Ming listened quietly. Though he couldn't entirely believe it, he certainly gained some insights.

Meanwhile, outside Chixia City, Yu Que carried a small package and flew into the mountains. It muttered to itself, "Mountain Lord, Little Que is also going to seek knowledge."

Its gaze was firm. "I will take a circuitous route. First, I'll go with my companions to the blessed land to follow Lord Purple Lightning Beast. They say Kunling has auspicious blood, and might go there, so I'll follow too."

The night mist was thick, and the massive Vermilion Bird Airship, flowing with intricate runes, traversed the vast sky, stirring up gusts of fierce winds.

After a brief argument, many young people in the cabin began to make friends. Those daring enough to travel alone twenty thousand li away to pursue studies wouldn't be hothouse flowers.

Of course, with youthful spirits, bragging, sparring, and passionate disputes were inevitable.

Around a few exceptionally beautiful and outstanding young women, a group of young men naturally gathered, asking them which Daoist academy or academic institution they would be attending.

"Sigh, I lost in an important competition and couldn't get into the academy I wanted most," a young man in black said, quite dejected.

"Brother, where are you going?" Someone couldn't help but ask.

The young man in black, Sun Teng, sighed, "I can only go to the Heavenly Peng Daoist Academy."

The group around him immediately fell silent, some wanting to hit him.

One person indignantly said, "The Heavenly Peng Daoist Academy is also among the top ranks. What are you dissatisfied with? Are you intentionally trying to annoy people?"

It was rumored that the Heavenly Peng Daoist Academy was guarded by a true Golden-winged Great Peng, whose cultivation was terrifyingly profound, demonstrating the depth of the academy's heritage.

Sun Teng said, "Actually, I wanted to go to the Origin Academy more, but I ran into the abnormal 'Eighty-One.' After losing to him, I lost the will to fight further."

Many people wanted to beat him. This guy was definitely sighing deliberately to show off, because the Heavenly Peng Daoist Academy was truly strong.

The "abnormal 'Eighty-One'" he mentioned was the terrifying young man who swept through eighty-one cities, and by now his nickname was far more famous than his actual name.

With so many young people, there was no shortage of powerful figures. Someone wasn't going to put up with him. The young man in yellow, Qiu Long, who had earlier discussed the Auspicious Beast, calmly spoke, "I'll go check out the Origin Academy for you."

The surrounding people showed surprise, then envy.

Sun Teng had nothing more to say.

"Origin Academy, the Immortal Path, the New Life Path, the Esoteric Sect Path, the Non-human Path—all seem very strong, right?" A young woman in blue asked, her face radiant.

Qiu Long nodded, "That's right. I pursue both the Immortal Path and the New Life Path simultaneously, so that place is the most suitable for me."

"Brother, you're truly impressive. Let's get acquainted. My name is Lu Xu, and I'm heading to the Flying Immortal Academy." A tall young man spoke.

Qiu Long sighed, "Brother, you are the truly remarkable one. The Flying Immortal Academy doesn't recruit many disciples. They are all top figures who can embark on the Immortal Path, supposedly supported by Ancestral Master-level figures."

Many people's expressions changed. One truly couldn't compare oneself to others.

"Lu Xu, could you be the Pure Yang Physique? Your name has nine suns in it," a young woman in white asked, her large eyes blinking.

The tall young man Lu Xu waved his hand, "I'm not that abnormal one. He's called Lu Dao, and he should have entered the Grand Unity Academy."

"Greetings, brothers. My name is Qi Ming. I follow the Esoteric Sect path and will be heading to the Calamity Evasion Daoist Academy." A delicate-looking young man stood up to greet them.

Lu Xu was surprised, "Qi Ming, I've heard of you. A genius on the Esoteric Sect path. I never expected to meet you here today."

As people from the Immortal Path and Esoteric Path appeared one after another and got to know each other, those on the New Life Path seemed to suffer a kind of bloodline suppression and gradually became quieter.

This was because, several years later, when their drive was worn down, they might seek to join these peers, serving as golden-armored guards or jade-armored guards by their side.

Qin Ming noticed that there were indeed powerful individuals here. Their consciousness auras were extremely strong, and their spiritual intelligence remarkably rich, clearly indicating they were aiming for the Auspicious Beast's blood.

He even acutely sensed that a woman completely enveloped in her attire possessed an exceptionally astonishing and somewhat abnormal Yang consciousness aura. Could she be a Pure Yang Physique?

Soon, that woman left. The person in the seat next to her let out a long breath and whispered, "Do you know who that was just now?"

"Who?" Many people's curiosity was piqued.

"A descendant of a Path-breaker from the Outer Yang Lands!"

"Hiss!" Immediately, there was a collective gasp of cold air.

"How do you know?" someone then asked.

"Because my elder brother cultivates in the Outer Yang Lands. I've been there and saw her from afar. When she cultivates, it's like a small sun emitting light!"

...

Not long after, six more people successively stood up and headed to the higher-class cabin.

Subsequently, their identities were revealed one after another: a granddaughter of an elder from the Immortal Lands, a descendant of a high-ranking official from the Esoteric Sect. All were young individuals of significant background and unfathomable strength.

One purple-clad young man was particularly excited, telling those around him that the masked woman sitting next to him was suspected to be a famous Heavenly Proud Daughter from the Immortal Lands. Someone had called out to her to leave together, inadvertently revealing her name.

It was rumored that this woman had cultivated a spiritual consciousness aura when she was only three or four years old, truly an Immortal Progeny!

"How are we people on the New Life Path supposed to live? How can we compete with them?" The young man in black, Sun Teng, looked up, this time sighing from the bottom of his heart.

After those people left, it sparked a flurry of discussion. Everyone was astonished that so many peers of such prominent backgrounds were also traveling to Kunling City, just like them.

Qin Ming listened for a while, then picked up the night report on his seat and began to read it.

"Hmm?" He was surprised. The front page was dedicated to a young man he had heard about more than once: the Young Grandmaster from Flowing Light City—Ling Yu.

In Chixia City, Yu Que had told him many hidden details.

The purple-eyed crow Qin Ming encountered in Black-White Mountain thought highly of him.

However, Tang Jin, the woman in the fur-lined cloak whom Master Wu followed, had chosen someone else as her teacher's successor.

"Young Grandmaster, who tested his sword in a hundred cities without a single defeat, perhaps can be called a Young Ancestor." The night report spared no praise for Ling Yu; his battle record was indeed terrifying.

"You're also paying attention to him? This person is too amazing! Most crucially, his teacher is even more legendary, on the verge of becoming an Ancestral Master-level figure!" The lively young woman in green next to Qin Ming loved to talk and started chatting away to herself.

Qin Ming nodded. He had long heard of the old Grandmaster from Flowing Light City, the person most likely to become an Ancestral Master in this era. This individual was blazing a new path, attempting to combine two methods and progressing quite successfully so far.

And according to the information Yu Que had learned from the purple-eyed crow, the Young Grandmaster Ling Yu might not be the strongest disciple of Flowing Light City.

Because Tang Jin had said that the person she chose for her teacher was like a scorching sun waiting to break through dark clouds, but should not be exposed too early, lest they incur heavenly jealousy.

"How strong exactly is a disciple taught by a Quasi-Ancestral Master?" Qin Ming muttered to himself.

The young woman in green next to him laughed, "We'll know soon enough, because it's rumored that a woman in black and a purple-eyed crow are taking Ling Yu to test his sword across the land, refining the new method passed down by his teacher. They'll probably arrive in Kunling City very soon."

Qin Ming said, "Looking at it this way, Kunling City won't be peaceful. There are already several young men and women of considerable background, and with another Young Grandmaster arriving, if they spar here, it will truly be lively."

"Likely a Young Ancestor!" the young woman in green corrected him.

"Right!" Qin Ming smiled and nodded.
