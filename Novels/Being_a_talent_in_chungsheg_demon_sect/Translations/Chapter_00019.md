# Chapter 19: Skinning

"You truly want to learn these divine abilities?"

Seeing Lu Yang's moved expression, Wang Bairong was somewhat surprised and couldn't help but say, "Junior Brother, the path of immortality always prioritizes cultivation realms. You must distinguish between what's primary and what's secondary." In his view, Lu Yang had earned so many contribution points at such a young age. In the future, even if he couldn't form his Foundation, at least achieving the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation was very promising. So why bother practicing those divine abilities with extreme side effects? Even if his combat power reached the heavens, what then? When his lifespan ran out, wouldn't he still turn into a handful of dust?

"Life is short; do not lead yourself astray." At this point, Wang Bairong displayed a sorrowful expression, "You are still young, and you don't yet understand this truth: flowers may bloom again, but youth never returns. You are vigorous and strong now, but what about ten years from now? Twenty years from now? The choice you make today might seem satisfying, but its drawbacks might only become apparent decades later. By then, there will be no medicine for regret."

Before his words even faded, Wang Bairong seemed to fall into a reverie. After a long while, he sighed, "You don't know, but when I was young, I was quite glorious in the Sacred Sect. But just one wrong step, and I squandered my entire life. Every time I recall it, it's unbearable pain..." As he spoke, Wang Bairong's eyes reddened. Under the influence of alcohol, he simply pulled Lu Yang and began recounting his glorious past.

In truth, it was nothing much; it was simply that in his youth, he didn't understand the importance of True Qi quality. He accidentally obtained a cultivation method below seventh-grade and began practicing it. As a result, his True Qi quality was too low, leaving him with no hope of forming a Foundation throughout his life, and even achieving Great Perfection in Qi Condensation was difficult. For decades, half of his body had been buried in the loess. Yet, his former senior and junior brothers, and the women he admired, had all extended their lifespans, retaining their youthful vigor to this day. How much regret, how much heartache this must cause! But alas, who in life can start over?

"What? I can start over? Then it's fine."

Seeing Wang Bairong thus fall into a drunken stupor, Lu Yang finally stood up and, following Wang Bairong's description, found the manual for "Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light." Undeniably, this was indeed a demonic art. Lu Yang exchanged it, his expression grave: "Rapid mastery, severe side effects, high danger – it possesses almost all the characteristics a demonic path should have."

To cultivate this divine ability, one must first select a magic artifact, then use the artifact to flay one's own skin alive, and then refine it with a secret method. Only after eighty-one days of refinement can a "Blood Transformation Treasure Light" be produced, which, when attached to the artifact, would injure ordinary cultivators upon brushing against it and kill them upon contact. "At the same time, I myself will become a blood shadow that exists reliant on the magic artifact. As long as the magic artifact is unharmed, the blood shadow will not perish. The side effects are a halved lifespan, and once transformed into a blood shadow, one no longer possesses a human body, but merely a human form, thus cultivation will no longer progress..."

"Good, it's indeed suitable for me!" Lu Yang's eyes gleamed brightly, and he immediately decided to practice this divine ability. During the cultivation process, he discovered that this divine ability actually had another version, which seemed to have been modified and optimized by a powerful cultivator. "After all, this divine ability is truly wondrous and extraordinary." The modified version also doesn't require the cultivator to flay their own skin for blood sacrifice; instead, it has the cultivator blood-sacrifice their biological siblings or descendants. "This way, the divine ability can still be cultivated. However, because the blood shadow created this way is not the cultivator themselves, it's difficult to wield freely, leading to a risk of backlash. But I am different; whether in this life or the next, the blood shadow will always be myself!"

Several days later, Lu Yang left the scripture pavilion. In addition, he fully purchased another copy of the "Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art." After all, only then could he openly display it in the future.

The next day, the "cultivation method" was delivered.

"Demon!" Looking at Yun Miaoyun, who was clutching the magic sword at her neck and glaring at him with an unyielding expression, Lu Yang suddenly felt a sense of having passed through another world. However, he quickly cast that thought aside. "Apologies, I need the method and experience for refining sword pellets."

"What? How do you know that!" Once was a stranger, twice was familiar. Lu Yang went all out and quickly extracted the necessary knowledge and experience from her.

This time, he went to "Myriad Treasure Peak," the mountain corresponding to the Outer Sect's Artifact Forging Hall, and one of the four inner peaks. Most of the Sacred Sect's magic artifacts originated from here.

"I want to rent a ground fire furnace." Arriving at the front desk, Lu Yang directly stated his request. After paying sufficient contribution points, he was invited into the highest-grade furnace room a quarter of an hour later.

After making full preparations, he took out the materials: Three taels of gold essence, three taels of jade marrow, two taels of cinnabar, and two taels of sword qi. Then, he performed a spell, drew fierce earth fire from the earth's core, and cast them all into the furnace! "Although most of the sword pellets from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion are refined by the sect elders, that's in the righteous path, where you don't have to worry about someone secretly tampering. This is the Initial Sacred Sect; instead of hoping for the moral integrity of the artifact refiners, it's better if I do it myself. At most, I'll just try a few more times..."

One set of materials cost 2000 contribution points. Lu Yang had only earned a total of ten thousand contribution points. After deducting the cost of divine abilities and cultivation methods, and repaying loans, his entire net worth could only afford three sets of sword pellet refining materials. "If all three attempts fail, then I'll try again in the next life!" With this thought, Lu Yang began to strictly follow the method and experience he had copied from Yun Miaoyun, slowly controlling the ground fire to refine all the materials.

Gold essence melted with jade marrow, cinnabar fused with sword qi... Gradually, a pellet appeared within Lu Yang's spiritual sense. However, before he could rejoice, he saw the pellet suddenly tremble in place... "Boom!" It exploded. One set of materials was ruined. Lu Yang calmly waved his sleeve to sweep away the debris, silently summarizing his lessons learned: "...My steps should be correct. The problem lies in the final step." Lu Yang recalled Yun Miaoyun's memories, and understanding gradually dawned in his eyes: "Refining a sword pellet requires the sword and heart to be unified. And I haven't been cultivating the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art for long, so my realm in the path of the sword is clearly lacking."

Logically, this was a rigid requirement that could only be achieved through gradual accumulation. However, this was from the perspective of the righteous path, which emphasized gradual progress and rarely employed expedient, heaven-defying methods that harmed harmony. The demonic path, however, didn't concern itself with such things.

"Sword and heart unified, at its core, is control over the sword pellet. Since that's the case, if I cultivate the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light simultaneously, the effect should be the same! Perhaps even better!" After all, the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light involved sacrificing oneself to the artifact. Once cultivated, one would practically merge with the artifact, and the degree of compatibility would undoubtedly far exceed the so-called unity of sword and heart.

"However, to achieve this, the anesthetic I prepared beforehand cannot be used..." Refining a sword pellet was a delicate task. If he took medicine to suppress the pain, causing his reactions to be half a beat slower during refinement, it was very likely to fail. Therefore, he had to remain fully conscious throughout.

"The demonic path, you know, demands ruthlessness towards oneself. Otherwise, how can one be considered a talent?" As he thought this, a glint of ruthlessness immediately appeared in Lu Yang's eyes.

A moment later, he sat upright before the ground fire furnace, shoved a piece of ragged cloth into his mouth, and when the sword pellet took form again, he controlled the sword qi to descend towards himself...
