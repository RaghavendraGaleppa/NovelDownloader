# Chapter 230: Qi Huan

Even though he had been calculating and economizing every day, a month had passed. With the last piece of tiger meat entering his stomach today, it wasn't long before he felt a warm sensation rapidly spreading from his stomach to his limbs. Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh. He stood up and took a breath of the ginseng spirit's essence before beginning to cultivate the Pure Yang One Qi Technique.

*Your Pure Yang One Qi Technique completed nine full cycles of the Heavenly River, successfully absorbing the essence of the demon beast's flesh and blood and the marrow of the ginseng spirit's essence. Your proficiency has increased significantly.*

*You diligently practiced the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique. The tempering of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body seems to have reached a new level. Your proficiency has increased.*

*...*

By the time the warmth in his stomach had completely dissipated, the frequency of the proficiency prompts flashing in Xu Yunfan's eyes had rapidly slowed. After practicing for nearly an hour, the proficiency of the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique had only increased by one point.

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Stopping his movements and slowly retracting his stance, Xu Yunfan walked out of the cave, crossed the waterfall, and climbed to the mountain peak. From there, he looked at the nearest spiritual energy node, which was entangled with demonic qi.

It is easier to go from frugality to luxury than from luxury to frugality.

Without the boost of demonic essence, relying solely on the assistance of the ginseng spirit's essence and the gathering of spiritual energy in the mountain's nodes, although the speed wasn't slow, Xu Yunfan, having experienced the sensation of having all three boosts and his cultivation speed maxed out, naturally did not want to slow his progress.

Tomorrow, once today was over, he would go to the nearest spiritual energy node to take a look.

He moved his hands and feet slightly, looked down at the dragon scale armor on his body, and reached out to touch a scale.

Under his fingertips, it felt as warm and smooth as jade.

Fortunately, he had this dragon scale armor; otherwise, after the continuous battles, his clothes would have long been shattered by the explosive force.

Tonight, he needed to sleep.

For more than a month, he hadn't slept or rested, relying entirely on the饱满的精神 (full spirit) maintained by the Lin Technique.

But going without rest for so long had inevitably left a layer of fatigue deep in his spirit.

Next, he could try to battle that vicious woman in his dreams to see just what level his strength had reached.

*Boom!*

A sudden, muffled thunder-like explosion came from the distance, its shockwaves spreading far away.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly. He was about to move when his feet froze, and he looked intently toward the direction of the sound. The sound had come from the nearest spiritual energy node, less than a hundred li away.

It was the very spot he had just been observing.

Had someone beaten him to it?

He didn't hesitate any longer. With a push of his foot, he tore through the air and shot forth with a whistling sound.

Three quarters of an hour later, the piercing shriek of the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer breaking through the sonic boom suddenly ceased.

Xu Yunfan stood on a protruding rock spur on Broken Dragon Cliff. The vibration of his muscles and fascia from the Hundred Tempered Steel Body made the seven-chi heavy hammer emit a humming sound that echoed far away.

His eyes flashed with light. As his Pure Yang internal energy surged with his blood, his vision rapidly pierced through the mist covering thirty li.

He saw two entangled scarlet auras, like evil dragons intertwining their necks. Wherever they passed, ancient trees turned to dust, and the ground cracked inch by inch. Each collision kicked up large swathes of earth and stone, snapping trees and grass.

What was even more astonishing was that the slightly darker of the two auras exuded a familiar rhythm of vital energy.

It seemed somewhat like the vital energy that could only be tempered by the martial arts of the Tiangong Cave.

Xu Yunfan's gaze sharpened. Could there be other outsiders within this Divine Weapon Secret Realm?

But what excited him most was that the other demon beast was actually an elephant body.

How long would it take to eat all of that?!

As long as he handled it properly, he wouldn't have to worry about the source of demon beast flesh and blood essence for a short time.

He didn't hesitate. With a forceful push from his foot, the entire basalt rock shattered with a crack.

The muscles and sinews throughout his body coiled and writhed. As his vital energy surged with the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength, the instantaneous high pressure generated within his body forced his pores to open, spraying out a golden-red mist. Stimulated by this, the 1,720 Red Serpent scales of his dragon scale armor breathed, opening and closing to dissipate the scorching heat.

By the time his seventh step shattered the stream stones, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength had already wrapped the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, completing seven layers of hidden power accumulation. The hammerhead, under high-speed friction, glowed with a molten, incandescent white.

At the center of the battlefield, a six-zhang-tall giant elephant was swinging its trunk to strike the ground. It looked like an elephant, with a trunk and ears, but its four legs were not like an elephant's. Instead, they were like chicken's feet, with skin as hard as iron, giving off a metallic luster.

The figure fighting it was increasingly catching Xu Yunfan's attention. The upper half of its body was covered in green scales, and a blood-colored ox horn on its forehead was broken, the stump constantly dripping black liquid that corroded the rock layers.

It was more fitting to call it a humanoid demon than a person.

Its two hands were exceptionally tough. Every time they collided with the elephant's trunk, they would blast open a spider-web-like transparent ripple of air in the air.

*Clang!*

Xu Yunfan's hammer momentum suddenly changed three hundred paces away.

When he saw the face of the humanoid demon, his expression shifted slightly, and the heavy hammer in his hand was forced into a sweeping motion.

The moment the seventh layer of hidden power of the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength was added, the air within a three-zhang radius was compressed into a liquid state. The thunder and fire enveloping the hammer's edge dragged out layers of sonic booms, crashing heavily into the unprepared belly of the elephant demon.

Three of the elephant demon's ribs shattered with a crack.

Xu Yunfan used the rebound force to flip in mid-air. The shoulder blades of his Hundred Tempered Steel Body emitted a rumble like the shifting of the earth's crust, diverting seventy percent of the counter-force into the rock layer beneath his feet.

When he confirmed it was indeed Qi Huan, his heart shook slightly.

Back then, Qi Huan had followed Pei Yan to the Xuanzhen Sect to participate in the martial arts competition of the Lingnan Dao sects, winning a spot in the top twenty to enter the Xuanzhen Secret Realm.

News from the Xuanzhen Sect had said that Qi Huan had died in the secret realm. Why had he suddenly appeared in the Divine Weapon Secret Realm?

Could it be that the secret realms of the various sects were connected?

In an instant, Xu Yunfan was filled with thoughts, suspicion rising in his heart.

"Senior Brother Qi, wake up!"

With a deep shout, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly flew from his hand, spinning.

Xu Yunfan pressed both palms against the end of the hammer handle. The great sinews throughout his body undulated like dragon veins, swinging the nearly four-hundred-pound weapon into a circular afterimage.

The scorching heat spewed by the dragon scale armor merged with the surging Pure Yang internal energy to form a qi armor, forcefully crashing into the center of the two's battle.

It wasn't that he had a kind heart, but he wanted to get information and see if he could awaken Qi Huan.

A flash of clarity passed through Qi Huan's turbid, beast-like pupils.

The demonized right hand instinctively shot out a sword finger, but the left hand, against the laws of its body, formed the closing gesture of the "Back Thrust Spear."

To Xu Yunfan, this contradiction was like a signal flare in the dark night. The martial artist's combat skills, imprinted in his very marrow, were fighting a desperate battle against the demon power that was eroding his body.

He pondered for a moment and made a decision.

Qi Huan alive was more valuable than dead. He was currently completely in the dark and needed someone who had been inside for a long time to clear his doubts.

"My apologies."

A righteous expression suddenly appeared on Xu Yunfan's cold face as he abruptly abandoned his hammer and closed in.

The Hundred Tempered Steel Body was pushed to its limit, turning him into a piece of red-hot meteoric iron as he crashed into Qi Huan's embrace.

The moment the two tempered bodies collided, a sound like a great bell or a giant drum erupted.

*(I'm particularly tired from work today and am writing the final chapter. Let's see if I can get it done. Thank you all, everyone.
