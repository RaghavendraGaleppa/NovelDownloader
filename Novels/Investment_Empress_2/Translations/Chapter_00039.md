# Chapter 39: A Bountiful Harvest, Three Investment Returns (1/2)

Autumn Water Pavilion.

Little Li Shifu hummed a cheerful tune as he began his day's work.

The ingredients were the exotic beast meat he had hunted today. In a good mood, he found cooking to be an immensely enjoyable activity.

His talent as a chef was probably a billion times better than his talent as a swordsman.

Spicy Wing Snake wings with ginger, clear-braised Spiked-Back Tortoise, stir-fried Black-Horn Sheep with scallions, Braised Fiery-Ring Wolf, and a side of green vegetables...

Four dishes and one soup, absolutely delightful.

"It smells so good."

The dishes had just been served when a figure in a palace gown appeared at the door and swiftly came to the table, reaching out to pick up a piece of lamb and pop it into her mouth.

"Master, you didn't go to the meeting with the elders?"

Li Mo passed her a pair of chopsticks.

The Clear Abyss Sect was in a turbulent period. The matter of the Ice Cube receiving the legacy was causing a huge stir throughout the sect.

If before, everyone saw Ying Bing as the future Sect Master, now they treated her as if she were a figure on par with the First Generation Founder of the Clear Abyss Sect.

If it weren't for the fact that the Ice Cube was only sixteen, the elders would have恨不得 enshrined her in a temple.

And at this critical juncture, the Demon Summoning Cult's evildoers had to stir up trouble. The Sect Master had immediately summoned all the high-level members to the main peak for a discussion.

"The old men are just spinning their wheels with endless talk, too lazy to listen," Shang Wu clicked her tongue, her beautiful brows furrowed with disdain for the old fogies.

Li Mo: "..."

Well, you couldn't expect his Master to offer any constructive opinions.

"The Sect Master did give me a task to handle."

"I reluctantly agreed."

Shang Wu propped her chin on her hand, her chopsticks flying.

Li Mo blinked. "The Master Sect Leader actually managed to get you to follow his orders?"

"He told me to move to Autumn Water Pavilion to make it easier for me to teach you."

Shang Wu supported her chin with one hand and let out a soft snort. "If it weren't for little Bing'er being here, I wouldn't even bother coming."

Li Mo gave a wry smile. He could more or less understand the Sect Master's intention.

Rather than saying she was here to teach him, it was more like she was here to protect Ying Bing.

His Master might be unreliable, but she was genuinely powerful in a fight. If pushed too far, she could even pluck a few of the Sect Master's beard hairs.

With such a fierce star like her guarding the place, the safety coefficient of Autumn Water Pavilion skyrocketed.

After the meal was finished.

"Little Bing'er, what was the legacy you obtained today like?" Shang Wu asked in a lowered voice.

Ying Bing put down her bowl and chopsticks.

To this carefree Elder of the Qunyu Peak, she surprisingly showed a little less coldness than usual.

As she channeled her Qi and blood, a layer of rosy light gradually began to circle around her.

Shang Wu's eyes filled with astonishment as she casually tossed a wine cup at her.

The cup was actually stopped by a gentle force, suspended within the rosy light and slowly spinning.

The wine inside was also controlled by Ying Bing, flowing out to form a water sphere that circled around her.

"At the Qi and Blood Realm, she can already project her internal energy outward... No, this is far superior to mere internal energy," Shang Wu clicked her tongue in amazement.

"Mm, it's just a trivial application," Ying Bing nodded slightly, and the rosy light suddenly surged.

*Crack—*

The wine cup shattered into pieces.

It could attack with rosy light, injuring people invisibly, or defend by neutralizing force with the principle of 'four ounces moving a thousand pounds.'

Shang Wu clapped her hands, finding it extremely impressive.

Li Mo looked mournfully at the shards on the floor. "My celadon wine cup..."

Suddenly, an idea struck him.

"Ice Cube, how much water can you control?"

"Water?"

Ying Bing walked to the water vat, and with a flick of the rosy light, the water surged out, transforming into a water dragon that coiled around her effortlessly.

Li Mo's eyes lit up.

He took the washed bowls and placed them into the water controlled by the rosy light, letting them spin and clatter along with the current.

Ying Bing: "?"

Li Mo: "It's actually getting them pretty clean."

Little Li discovered this as if it were a new continent.

Watching the boy's eyes filled with wonder and admiration, the slight frown on Ying Bing's brow smoothed out. She suddenly felt that this sensation wasn't讨厌 (unpleasant).

There was even a faint sense of accomplishment in her heart...

"Can I add two more bowls?"

"Mm, of course."

"Wow, amazing, amazing."

***

Shang Wu propped her chin on her hand, watching the young man and woman not far away. A hint of amusement flowed through her tipsy eyes.

Ice Cube...

That nickname was quite fitting.

By the way, it felt like she had forgotten something?

Never mind, it probably wasn't that important...

***

The moon rose to the treetops.

Inside the room.

Ying Bing wrote down elegant characters on a bamboo slip.

"Having been bathed in the essence blood pool of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, the physical body has been reborn, making it suitable for body tempering."

"Sword Dao aptitude is barely passable. With sufficient effort and guidance, it is not impossible to cultivate a sword art masterpiece to Great Perfection."

"Possessing a pure and innocent heart, the Divine Observation Method is of utmost importance. He must cultivate a balanced and upright technique to avoid straying into a deviant path."

What she was writing was an evaluation of Li Mo's current state, as well as a plan for his future development.

Ying Bing had already decided.

When she leaves the Eastern Wilderness Domain in the future, she will take Li Mo with her.

For some reason, he had undergone such a great change in this life.

Could it be because her rebirth had triggered a butterfly effect?

No matter the reason, it was not important.

The fact remained that in the cave this life, he had yielded the legacy to her.

Perhaps he was still unremarkable for now.

But as long as she helped him, there would be no worry that he couldn't defy fate and change his destiny in the future.

What made Ying Bing feel a little pleased was that although Li Mo didn't have any exceptionally brilliant talents, he also didn't have any fatal flaws that needed to be made up for.

All in all, he was a clean sheet of paper with sufficient plasticity for the future.

As long as the operation was done properly, it was highly possible to bring him into the ranks of true prodigies.

For the time being, it was enough to secure a place among his peers in the Eastern Wilderness Domain.

She put away the bamboo slip.

She returned to the bed and drew the bed curtains.

Soon, a chilling aura ran rampant, and ice crystals slowly spread out from the bed as the center.

Although she had obtained the Rosy Soul ahead of time, before the Inner Scenery Realm, without forming an inner world, she ultimately couldn't control the power of the Great Yin...

Furthermore, because the Rosy Soul had merged with her, her physique had been further enhanced.

The power of the Great Yin had not decreased but increased.

This also meant that her cultivation speed would grow even faster.

Within the Rosy Soul, there was also a divine-level technique focused on the application of internal energy.

《Rosy Phoenix Qi》.

She had long known of this martial art, but without the Rosy Soul, it was useless even if she learned it.

By the time the system's ranking settlement arrived, she should have been able to step into the Internal Energy Realm.

***

Next door.

"By the way, where is the reward for getting first place in the sect competition?"

"Did my Master embezzle it..."

Little Li pondered for a moment and gave up on thinking about it.

It wasn't important. Compared to the rewards he had reaped from the Ice Cube, they were all just floating clouds.

As is well known, the rewards given by the system feedback are usually better than what was invested.

Today, he could be said to have invested the legacy of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix into Ying Bing.

The return should definitely be something better.

With a thought.
