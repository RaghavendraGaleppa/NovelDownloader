# Chapter 213: Don't Bully the Young and Poor

Time passed in a flash as deep autumn gave way to winter.

Lin Shan sat cross-legged atop a white cloud, diligently cultivating during his leisure time. 

Over the past two months, the volcanic crater of Líluan Mountain had seen increasingly violent magma activity, its turbulent churning so intense that an uninformed observer might think its brief dormant period had ended. 

Lin Shan had once attempted to descend and observe how the Black Skeleton Demon Lord was undergoing his transformation. However, as he ventured deeper into the magma, his protective spiritual light began to falter, forcing him to retreat. 

He had no idea how deep the Black Skeleton Demon Lord was cultivating. Truth be told, Lin Shan was somewhat envious of the magma tempering method. 

Although he had the Void Star Disc's stellar energy tempering his body—his "Pseudo-Stellar Physique" already met the requirements to break through to the Golden Core stage—having an additional "Immaculate Body" to match other Golden Core cultivators would only strengthen his foundation. 

Lin Shan would never pass up any opportunity to improve himself. 

Every minor enhancement was another brick in the foundation of his cultivation—something he couldn't afford to neglect. 

The only uncertainty was whether the magma tempering method was suitable for human cultivators. If not, he would have to seek other opportunities during the upcoming campaign against the Dai Family. 

The Dai Family undoubtedly possessed methods for forging the "Immaculate Body"!

As he was lost in thought, small dots appeared on the horizon, eventually stopping at the lake surrounding Líluan Mountain. 

From an assortment of flying contraptions descended a group of cultivators dressed in various attires. They appeared to be from nearby third-rate sects and clans, bringing their disciples to participate in an inter-sect exchange. 

A quick count revealed over a dozen cultivation factions. 

Most were led by Foundation Establishment cultivators, each guiding twenty to thirty Qi Condensation juniors. 

In no time, they erected a large floating platform in the lake, roughly half an acre in size. The sects and clans then took their seats in a circle, engaging in discussions about cultivation techniques and exchanging insights. 

Watching from above, Lin Shan found this inter-sect gathering rather intriguing. Truth be told, he had never witnessed—much less participated in—such an event. 

After all, when he first arrived in the Eastern Sea and joined the Black Lotus Sect, he was immediately dispatched to proselytize. Shortly after, the war between the righteous and demonic factions erupted, leaving him no chance to experience the peaceful, harmonious life of sect cultivation. 

He had even once fantasized about chance encounters with pure-hearted junior sisters, gentle senior sisters, or even aloof female masters within the sect. 

Unfortunately, the Black Lotus Sect was a demonic cult—structured around a main altar and branch outposts, with a rigid hierarchy of Dharma Kings, Protectors, and Envoys. It was essentially a pyramid scheme. There was no formal initiation or master-disciple lineage—everything was performance-based. 

If you had talent, a higher-ranking Protector might take notice and sponsor you. 

Once you left the sect's premises, survival was your own responsibility. Internal conflicts were commonplace, and disputes were settled with fists rather than words—a stark contrast to the hypocritical politeness of the righteous factions. 

Down in Líluan Lake, however, the sects and clans were all amicable, engaging in pleasant discussions. Some of the younger disciples even exchanged flirtatious glances, hinting at cross-sect romances they dared not reveal in front of their elders. 

Lin Shan lowered his cloud slightly. The Cloud-Dropping Banner's concealment function, combined with his late Foundation Establishment cultivation, ensured he remained undetected—unless someone below possessed exceptional spiritual sense or deliberately scanned the skies with specialized pupil techniques. 

Most of the discussions among the Foundation Establishment cultivators revolved around Qi Condensation cultivation techniques, likely intended for the juniors. The young disciples listened attentively, absorbing every word. 

After about an hour, the lectures concluded, and the competition segment began. 

Each faction sent their disciples to duel in a central arena on the floating platform. The tournament-style matches determined rankings, with the top fifteen receiving generous rewards. 

The prizes were pooled from treasures contributed by the participating sects—a collective incentive to motivate the disciples. 

The small sects and clans had each brought unique treasures, clearly taking the competition seriously and unwilling to lose face. Many of the rewards even exceeded what typical Qi Condensation disciples would normally have access to. 

High-grade magical artifacts, top-tier elixirs, flight talismans, warrior puppets, spirit beast cubs, alarm formation plates, exotic spiritual fruits... 

The juniors below were practically drooling, their eyes gleaming with greed as they vowed to secure a spot in the rankings. 

Lin Shan, watching from above, remained unimpressed. Given his current wealth, these items were barely worth a glance—mere drops in the bucket. 

However, discord soon arose below. 

A yellow-bearded elder smirked mockingly as he taunted a young leader: 

"So, Young Clan Chief Muyan, what treasure has your clan brought to this inter-sect exchange?" 

The youth had delicate, boyish features, with bright star-like eyes and a chiseled face that bore a maturity beyond his years. 

This was Muyan, the newly appointed young clan chief of the Muyan Clan, a local cultivation family. 

Originally, the Muyan Clan had been nothing more than a third-rate cultivation family in Pengpi County. Its strongest member was Muyan's father, the clan chief, who had reached late Foundation Establishment. However, one day, he was suddenly ambushed and abducted by a mysterious force in the cultivation world, vanishing without a trace.
