# Chapter 66: Spirit Peak  

The bombshell news Mai Yunfa brought to Gu Mo was that the Spirit Plant Master elder had announced he would officially begin teaching in one month. Disciples qualified to attend would need to travel to the elder's Spirit Peak for the lectures.  

A month's notice was clearly meant to give disciples currently in seclusion time to prepare.  

After thanking Mai Yunfa for the news, Gu Mo began making preparations for the upcoming lectures. These were teachings from a Golden Core elder, and what he would impart was the legacy of a Spirit Plant Master—a profession crucial to Gu Mo. It was the perfect cover for the origins of his peculiar plants.  

A month later, Gu Mo rode his mid-grade flying sword alongside other outer sect disciples from the Spirit Plant Hall, heading toward the elder's residence.  

None of the outer sect disciples were surprised to see Gu Mo wielding a mid-grade flying sword. By now, everyone knew he was wealthy—after all, his previous sale of Water Spirit Rice alone had earned him thousands of spirit stones.  

"There are quite a few people," Gu Mo noted, glancing around. Over a dozen outer sect disciples from the Spirit Plant Hall were making the journey with him, and other peaks would also send disciples, though in smaller numbers. Still, combined, the total attendance would be significant.  

At the speed of their flying swords, it took only half an hour to reach the residence of the 3rd-rank Spirit Plant Master—a cultivation treasure land built atop a 3rd-rank spirit vein.  

"Junior brothers and sisters, gather here!"  

Upon arriving at the foot of the Spirit Peak, a male and female disciple dressed in the outer sect robes of the Spirit Plant Hall greeted them. These two were Song Xing and Li Jinmei, the only two official Spirit Plant Masters currently in the Qinglu Sect.  

Both hailed from the Spirit Plant Hall and were now assisting the 3rd-rank elder in managing affairs on the Spirit Peak, including guiding the arriving disciples.  

"Senior Brother Song! Senior Sister Li!"  

The outer sect disciples from the Spirit Plant Hall were naturally familiar with the pair, and Mai Yunfa, who was on good terms with them, was the first to step forward.  

"Junior Brother Mai, I have high hopes for you," Song Xing said warmly upon seeing him.  

"Hmm? Why is there a labor disciple here?"  

Li Jinmei's gaze landed on Gu Mo, who stood out conspicuously in his labor disciple robes among the outer sect disciples.  

"Senior Sister Li, don’t underestimate Junior Brother Gu Mo. He’s the one who successfully cultivated Water Spirit Rice," Mai Yunfa said, pulling Gu Mo forward.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother Song, Senior Sister Li," Gu Mo saluted respectfully.  

"What? You can grow Water Spirit Rice?" Song Xing and Li Jinmei exchanged astonished glances. Since when had labor disciples become so impressive? Even they hadn’t been confident of cultivating such high-grade spirit plants before becoming Spirit Plant Masters.  

Now, Mai Yunfa was claiming this labor disciple had succeeded. Had the Spirit Plant Hall changed so much in the few years they’d been away?  

"It’s true. Everyone here witnessed it," Mai Yunfa said with a smile. He had recruited Gu Mo from the labor disciple quarters, so Gu Mo’s achievements reflected well on his judgment.  

"Indeed," several other outer sect disciples chimed in.  

Though still skeptical, the unanimous confirmation left no room for doubt. A labor disciple capable of growing Water Spirit Rice was certainly a curiosity.  

Before Song Xing and Li Jinmei could inquire further, however, disciples from other peaks arrived, forcing them to set aside their questions and attend to their duties.  

After waiting at the foot of the mountain for a short while, the group was complete—no one dared to be late for the elder’s lecture. Gu Mo estimated around fifty disciples had gathered, all outer sect members from various peaks.  

Surprisingly, he even spotted an inner sect disciple among them.  

Without exaggeration, that inner sect disciple and Gu Mo—the sole labor disciple—became the two most eye-catching figures in the crowd.  

"Everyone, follow us."  

Once all had arrived, Song Xing and Li Jinmei led the group up the Spirit Peak. The mountain was protected by formations, and without proper guidance, triggering them would be disastrous.  

As they ascended the stone steps toward the mountainside—where the lecture would take place—the scenery of the Spirit Peak unfolded before them. Given that this was the residence of a Spirit Plant Master, the mountain was adorned with all manner of exotic spirit plants, captivating the disciples' attention.  

But Gu Mo’s gaze was fixed on the spirit fields beneath those plants. Every plot was at least 2nd-rank, and he even spotted a 3rd-rank field among them.  

A 3rd-rank spirit field was something Gu Mo had never even dreamed of possessing. Even a 2nd-rank field was beyond his current means. Yet here, the lowest-grade fields were 2nd-rank. If he could obtain just one, his path to Foundation Establishment would be wide open.  

"If I could become this elder’s disciple, maybe I could get a 2nd-rank spirit field," Gu Mo mused, the thought flashing through his mind.  

Rumor had it that this Spirit Plant Master elder had never taken a disciple. Even Song Xing and Li Jinmei, despite being official Spirit Plant Masters, only assisted in managing the peak—they weren’t his students.  

If even they couldn’t become his disciples, the difficulty of earning the elder’s favor must be immense.  

"We’re here!"  

Amidst their awe, the group arrived at the mountainside, where a grand hall stood. This was where the lecture would take place.  

The summit, however, was the elder’s secluded cultivation grounds—a forbidden area of the Spirit Peak.  

"Find yourselves seats inside. I’ll inform the elder of your arrival."  

With that, Song Xing and Li Jinmei departed.  

The disciples filed into the hall, where rows of meditation cushions were neatly arranged. Almost instantly, a scramble ensued as everyone rushed to secure the best spots, with the front rows being the most contested.  

The closer one sat to the elder, the higher the chance of catching his attention. Gu Mo wasn’t the only one hoping to become the elder’s disciple—everyone present shared that ambition.  

In fact, every outer sect disciple in the Qinglu Sect dreamed of being taken under a Golden Core elder’s wing. However, such elders only accepted inner sect disciples—and even then, only the elite among them.  

The ordinary inner sect disciples, like the one attending today’s lecture, had no such luck. Those with Golden Core masters wouldn’t bother coming here. For elite inner sect disciples, cultivation was their top priority. Even if they wished to learn a secondary skill, they would choose alchemy, artifact forging, formations, or talismans—rarely spirit planting.
