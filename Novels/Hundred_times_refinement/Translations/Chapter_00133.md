Chapter 83: The Talisman of Teleportation

The surrounding cultivators looked on with admiration, having heard that the Cloud Fairy of Misty Cloud Valley was renowned for her beauty and talents, and now they saw that her reputation was well-deserved.

Some were envious of Qin Yan's beauty, while others were jealous of her cultivation. It was said that she had only cultivated for less than four years, yet she had already reached the peak of the Spirit Mobility Period.

Qin Yan remained unmoved by the various greedy and complex gazes, but suddenly, her face changed, and she turned to the person on her right, warning, "Be careful!"

Before the cultivator could react, he felt a chill on his neck, and then his body fell backward, headless.

The nearby cultivators were shocked and terrified, unable to comprehend what had happened. The attack was too swift, like a lightning strike, and they hadn't detected any information before being ambushed. Was it a Foundation Establishment Period cultivator?

As a blood-red beam of light flew toward them, four figures appeared. The remaining cultivators examined the newcomers' cultivation levels using the Spiritual Eye Technique and were shocked.

"Continue to intensify the attack," Xiang Wu ordered, releasing his magical tool, a golden-ringed broadsword that emitted a bloody glow and a murderous aura.

Screams filled the air as another cultivator from the Dao Fu Mountain was beheaded. Two high-ranking cultivators from the Fire Spirit Gate joined the battle, taking advantage of their superior magical tools and techniques to slaughter the Spirit Mobility Period cultivators.

The two Foundation Establishment Period cultivators were pinned down by the demon beasts controlled by the Qiao Tong and Di Tong, who, despite their relatively low cultivation, wielded powerful magical tools that kept the enemies at bay.

The battle continued, with the slaughter becoming increasingly brutal. Qin Yan's expression turned grave as a golden beam of light descended, and she countered with a blue glow from her sword.

The two energies clashed, producing a massive explosion that sent colorful rays of light into the sky and shook the ground.

Xiang Wu was taken aback; his magical tool had been blocked for the first time. He gazed at Qin Yan with a greedy expression, recognizing the sword she wielded as the Autumn Water Sword, a famous artifact once used by the Cloud Crane True Person.

Qin Yan's cultivation was impressive, but Xiang Wu's was higher, and his magical tool, although only an upper-grade Spiritual Tool, was still formidable. However, the Autumn Water Sword was an exceptional Spiritual Tool, one of the best among its kind.

As Qin Yan struggled to keep up with Xiang Wu's relentless attacks, her face grew pale, and blood trickled from her lips. She knew she couldn't hold on much longer.

With a hint of hesitation, Qin Yan retrieved a talisman from her storage ring. Xiang Wu didn't notice, thinking it was just a futile attempt.

The talisman was a white sheet of paper with mysterious characters and patterns. Qin Yan infused it with her spiritual energy, and it emitted a brilliant white light that enveloped her.

Xiang Wu sensed the powerful energy emanating from the talisman and realized too late that Qin Yan was attempting to escape. He tried to stop her, but it was too late; the white light dissipated, and Qin Yan vanished.
