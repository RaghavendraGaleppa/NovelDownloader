# Chapter 245: To the Southern Frontier, Chasing the Moon

Watching the young girl speak those words so softly, Li Mo’s heart skipped a beat.

He couldn't help but recall the judgment given by the Eye of Fate:

‘A life of many calamities.’

‘Future ruler of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.’

She was the Empress of the Phoenix, destined to fight against the current and soar high.

The Qingyuan Sect would be her starting point, but it would not, and should not, be a cage to trap her.

It seemed sudden, but upon reflection, had she not been waiting for the fireworks tonight, she might have already left long ago.

And besides.

She said she would pick up the wish he had made for her.

Li Mo looked at the graceful girl, but saw that her beautiful eyes were as deep and clear as still water. There was no determination to leave, nor any fear or worry—only a calm and gentle light.

Just like the bright moon that had always shone upon him.

“Little Ice.”

“The Southern Frontier is the territory of the Demon Race. It is of no benefit for you to go there; it only adds danger,” Li Mo said softly.

Ying Bing replied gently, “Where did that shooting star fall?”

“You guess?”

“When do we set off?”

“I’m not telling you.”

“Alright, I never said I was going with you.”

“When it is time to leave, I shall leave.”

Ying Bing’s jade-like lips parted slightly, and she glanced at the red string on the youth’s wrist.

Perhaps it was after a meal, or perhaps on a certain morning, she truly did not know when she would set off, nor exactly where the Jade Phoenix God would fall.

However... though she did not know where she was going, she knew where she should return.

......

In the main hall of the tavern.

By the time Li Mo finished his dual cultivation, it was already the morning of the next day. The tavern’s main hall was unusually quiet today.

Xiao Er was sweeping the floor; he had now been promoted to the hall manager—and still a waiter.

Murong Xiao was still sitting there, though the incense burner now held a few more sticks of incense, and someone had stacked up the leftovers from yesterday’s meal. There were even a few bottles of wine.

Hmm.

It seemed the beautiful Master had drunk quite well yesterday; otherwise, these few bottles wouldn't have remained.

Li Mo casually picked up a bottle and took a sip.

“Brother Murong, for the years to be peaceful, one must have the strength to shield against wind and rain, don't you agree?”

“If I were at the Ninth Realm now, with a single tremor of my tiger-like body, the demons of the Southern Frontier would obediently deliver whatever Little Ice wants.”

“Shall I ask the Buddha for you?”

Murong Xiao: “......”

As the two were chatting, Li Mo’s expression suddenly changed, and he looked back.

His soul was powerful, yet he hadn't sensed it earlier. He only noticed someone entering the tavern after hearing the footsteps.

It was an old monk wearing a patched cassock. His two white eyebrows hung down, making him look like an ordinary wandering ascetic.

“Amitabha,” the old monk chanted softly.

“Great Master, are you here to beg for alms?”

“Amitabha.”

No matter what Li Mo asked, the old monk kept chanting “Amitabha.”

Li Mo raised an eyebrow slightly, a dark light flashing in his eyes.

【Name: Heng Yuan】
【Age: 82】
【Bone Structure: Thousand-Leaf Hands, Golden Buddha Bone.】
【Realm: Sixth Heaven of the External Scenery.】
【Fate: Blue with a hint of Purple.】
【Evaluation: Head of the Discipline Hall at Xuankong Temple. Has practiced the Vow of Silence for fifty years.】
【Recent Events: Commissioned by the Prince of the South, he detected the intentions of the Summoning Demon Cult. He pursued Chang Bolong to Yunzhou, intending to retrieve the ‘Preliminary God Son’.】

Li Mo put down the Heart-Resonance Bell in his arms.

Xuankong Temple was the orthodox Buddhist sect of the Southern Frontier, its reputation comparable to that of the Hengyun Sword City.

Preliminary God Son...

Li Mo looked at Murong Xiao, who was sitting there with a solemn, Buddha-like expression.

“Great Master, are you here for him?”

“Amitabha...”

Old Monk Heng Yuan nodded slightly, his gaze kind as he nodded.

“He is a disciple of my Qingyuan Sect; he cannot be taken away by you,” Li Mo said seriously.

Heng Yuan shook his head slightly, chanting a Buddhist name. Strangely, though he said nothing, it made one feel in their heart that he meant no harm.

Even as Li Mo secretly activated his Lunar Soul, there was no abnormality.

The old monk walked up to Murong Xiao. Seeing the ‘offerings’ placed on the ground, his eyelids twitched slightly.

---

Then, he slowly began to recite a Buddhist sutra.

Immediately after.

A golden light of the Golden Bell Shield emanated from Murong Xiao, yet vaguely, the shadow of a fierce flood dragon appeared.

As the sutra was recited, the flood dragon seemed to be slowly awakening.

“Bloodline power seems similar to Divine Intent, yet not entirely the same...”

Li Mo could see that.

Old Monk Heng Yuan was using a secret Buddhist method to accelerate Murong Xiao’s awakening, so Li Mo said nothing more.

A moment later.

Although Murong Xiao had not yet awakened, when Li Mo looked at him with the Eye of Fate again, he was no longer in a dormant state.

【Recent Events: Received a letter from his parents and returned to the Southern Frontier to visit relatives. Encountered an意外 awakening of the Ming Dragon bloodline and fell into a deep slumber. Now that a high monk has suppressed the bloodline, he will awaken in a few days.】

After finishing all this.

Heng Yuan retracted his gaze from Murong Xiao, gave Li Mo a deep look, and then left gracefully.

Li Mo frowned as he stood in place.

He had a feeling he would meet this old monk again.

......

Three days later.

Autumn was deepening. In the evening, before the sun had fully set and the moon had not yet fully risen.

The faint black light shimmering on Li Mo’s body became increasingly restrained. He looked no different on the surface, but in reality, his physique was now beyond comparison.

The Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body was complete.

Dinner. Everyone ate together lively.

Everyone’s liveliness was different.

Shang Wu gulped down fine wine. Princess Xiao Jiang wiped the broken sword Li Mo had bought for her, occasionally letting out a sword hum from her palm.

Qian Bufan’s chopsticks flew as he ate and talked simultaneously, not耽误ing either.

Murong Xiao...

Murong Xiao’s silence was deafening!

“We’re preparing to set off,” Qian Bufan said contentedly as he wiped his mouth. After staying in Yunzhou for so long, there were many matters in the sect that needed to be handled.

“Old Qian, let’s take the warship back.”

Shang Wu’s almond eyes were filled with drunkenness.

“What warship? That’s two Profound Crystals. Do you think money grows on trees?”

“Tch~”

“It’s not that far anyway. I have some medicine orders to deliver to a few cities along the way.”

“I need to deliver the latest ‘The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me’ to the cities along the route.”

Everyone seemed to have their own tasks to do on the journey.

“Set off...”

Hearing the conversation, Li Mo looked at the empty space under the tree and suddenly felt a stir in his heart.

She was just there a moment ago...

Little Li chased out of the Yulong Street, all the way to the street corner.

By the shimmering lakeside, under the twilight of the burning clouds, the slender figure of the young girl was traveling far away.

The crowd was surging, bustling and noisy.

As if she felt something, she turned her head to look back.

Through the crowd, their eyes met.

She was stunned for a moment, then gave a helpless, beautiful smile.

She hadn't wanted to say goodbye, to add to the sorrow of parting.

【Name: Ying Bing】
【Age: 16】
【Bone Structure: Lunar Moon Phoenix Body.】
【Realm: Three Apertures of Divine Observation.】
【Fate: Red (Bearing the Empress Bone, with Ice as Fate and Autumn Water as Spirit, possessing the appearance of a Phoenix Empress).】
【Evaluation: A life of many calamities, yet always able to turn misfortune into blessing. Though her feathers are not yet full, when the winds and clouds change, she will surely hang high in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, ruling the Six Directions and Eight Wastelands.】
【Recent Events: Saw the fall of the Jade Phoenix God, one of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix Souls, and set off for the Southern Frontier.】

She was going to pick up the shooting star for the youth.

After the figure disappeared, Li Mo let out a soft breath.

When he turned back to the tavern, dusk had passed, and the moon was hanging on the branches.

“I’m not returning to Ziyang Prefecture,” Li Mo said to everyone.

Shang Wu blinked her almond eyes, about to speak, but Xue Jing spoke first:

“Then what are your plans?”

“To the Southern Frontier, to chase the moon.”

She knew where she was going, and where she belonged.

So did he.

The day he comprehended the Seventy-Two Transformations of Earthly Evil would be the day he set off for the Southern Frontier.
