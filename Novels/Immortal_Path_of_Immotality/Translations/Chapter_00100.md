# Chapter 100: Body of the Lightning Mother

As soon as the Nascent Soul demonic cultivator in the sky ordered the massacre of everyone present, all the previously unsuspecting guests below wasted no time and fled immediately.

Thunder Rain Master summoned a massive water serpent, its azure body stretching over twenty feet long. She pulled Lin Shan and Lin Fan onto the serpent, and the spirit beast immediately swayed its head and tail, flicking its tongue as it skimmed low over the mountain slope.

Many other guests also displayed their unique skills—some summoned flying artifacts, gathering their disciples before soaring away. Others condensed clouds or mist with their magic power, wrapping themselves within as they scattered in all directions. Most, however, simply summoned their artifacts and fled for their lives.

But fleeing through the air made them easy targets. Half of the Foundation Establishment guests had already defected and were now tasked with eliminating the stragglers. Naturally, they wouldn't let anyone escape, and some guests were already being intercepted.

Meanwhile, explosions and flashes of light appeared near the distant shoreline as swarms of blood-robed and black-clad figures surged up the mountain—clearly, the forces of the three demonic sects had been lying in ambush for some time.

Panic intensified. Flying made them easy targets for groups of Foundation Establishment cultivators, while descending the mountain on foot risked running into the demonic forces, leaving them trapped between two fronts.

Many hesitated, only to be overtaken by pursuers, plunging them into chaotic battles.

Thunder Rain Master, however, paid no heed to the chaos. Riding her water serpent, she charged down the mountain with the two brothers in tow.

The serpent, a Foundation Establishment-level spirit beast, slithered nimbly around obstacles—palaces and trees—with astonishing speed.

Within moments, they reached the mountainside and encountered the advancing demonic cultivators.

"Look at that pretty little thing—so fresh!"

"Perfect! Capture her and bring her back for the Protector!"

"Shut up! This girl’s no pushover!"

A mixed group of demonic cultivators, young and old, clad in red and black robes, immediately moved to block Thunder Rain Master as she descended.

Her expression remained cold, her fair face devoid of makeup or emotion. Standing with her hands behind her back atop the serpent, she let the Foundation Establishment spirit beast do the work. The Qi Condensation underlings below stood no chance.

The serpent sent them flying, bones snapping under its force. Lin Shan and Lin Fan, still on the serpent’s back, didn’t idle either—they pulled out artifacts and assisted from a distance. In moments, the trio had advanced half a mile.

But the demonic ambush ahead was dense and unending—who knew how many cultivators had been mobilized for this siege?

Suddenly, the serpent halted abruptly, hissing at something ahead. Lin Shan looked forward and saw a middle-aged Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator blocking their path.

The man was wreathed in demonic energy, his face twisted with malice and adorned with a ghastly tattoo—clearly a ruthless killer.

"Well, well! A Foundation Establishment spirit beast—you must be from no small sect. Pity you ran into me."

Before he could finish, Thunder Rain Master let out a cold "Hmph!" The demonic cultivator clutched his head in agony, as if struck by a soul attack.

Simultaneously, she formed hand seals, summoning three thick bolts of lightning from the sky—reminiscent of the thunder techniques Lin Shan had witnessed in the Yelang Ancient Tomb.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The demonic cultivator was blasted meters away, his body charred black. He twitched a few times before going still—whether paralyzed or on the brink of death was unclear.

The onlookers were stunned. A fellow Foundation Establishment cultivator, defeated in a single strike? The gap was that vast?

All that bravado, only to be a weakling?

But the brief delay allowed more demonic cultivators to converge—three more Foundation Establishment experts arrived.

Seeing their comrade lying motionless, they exchanged glances but gritted their teeth and charged.

Thunder Rain Master formed another seal, and two swords—one blue, one purple—soared into the sky. One shimmered with watery mist, the other wreathed in violet vapor. After circling briefly, they crisscrossed downward.

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

Electric light and mist filled the air. Within moments, the three demonic cultivators lay dead, their shattered artifacts scattered around them.

Now, not only were the surrounding demonic cultivators dumbfounded, but even Lin Shan was shocked.

Was this the power of a disciple from the mighty Violet Sky Sect? Slaying peers like slaughtering livestock? Was it really this absurd?

Lin Fan, ever the helpful brother, explained:  
"Senior Sister Thunder Rain Master is at the peak of late Foundation Establishment. Among the younger generation of our Violet Sky Sect’s main lineage, she’s one of the top experts! Not only does she possess the innate 'Body of the Lightning Mother,' but she’s also been personally designated by the sect master as a future Nascent Soul seed. And this isn’t even her full strength—she hasn’t used her minor divine abilities yet! If—"

Lin Fan’s reassurances were cut short when Thunder Rain Master suddenly barked coldly, "Come out!"

Startled, Lin Fan and Lin Shan turned to see a blood-robed youth stepping gracefully from the forest ahead.

The man exuded the aura of late Foundation Establishment, his handsome face sharp-featured and noble—clearly a prodigy among the demonic sects.

He held a precious fan, and the jade pendants at his waist jingled softly—likely a high-ranking disciple, possibly even a true inheritor.

"My mistake—so it’s a fairy from the inland Violet Sky Sect. Your thunder techniques and swords are indeed formidable, seemingly countering our Blood River Hall’s methods. I fear I’m no match."

The youth spoke candidly, admitting his inferiority while lavishing praise on Thunder Rain Master’s techniques and artifacts. His smug demeanor made Lin Shan and Lin Fan frown, but Thunder Rain Master remained tense, clearly recognizing the threat he posed.

Just then, a pursuer from the mountain disrupted the moment with a roar:  
"Little lass from the Violet Sky Sect, the Water Bandit Chief, Bear Mountain Sage, is here to claim you as my wife! Huh—?"

A burly man wielding a spiked club charged forward, only for a flash of violet light to sever his weapon mid-swing. He gaped at the broken high-grade artifact—shattered in one strike?

This wasn’t entirely his fault. High-grade artifacts varied wildly in quality, from two thousand spirit stones to tens of thousands—like Lin Fan’s Five Elements Robe, which was priceless.

Thunder Rain Master, as a top-tier genius of the Violet Sky Sect, wielded treasures far beyond the norm. Ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators, with mere thousands of spirit stones to their name, couldn’t hope to compete.

But the blood-robed youth seized the distraction. His fan shot toward the water serpent while a treasure scroll unfurled from his sleeve.

The scroll depicted a crimson figure standing atop a sea of blood, its aura oppressive.

Thunder Rain Master redirected her water sword to block the fan while recalling her thunder sword. But the youth’s scroll activated instantly, unleashing a tide of blood that filled the battlefield.

Within the blood sea, ghouls, asuras, yakshas, and blood demons howled as they surged forward. Lin Shan and Lin Fan huddled behind Thunder Rain Master, layering defenses with the Five Elements Robe and the Bronze Heartguard Mirror.

The youth’s timing was impeccable—by splitting Thunder Rain Master’s focus, he trapped the trio within the blood sea, seizing the initiative.

Now, with no escape, they were at his mercy.
