# Chapter 16: Reunion with Little Brother and the Day of Assessment

Li Xian patted Li Xiaofan’s shoulder. Even through the coarse linen clothes, he could feel the bones beneath. Seeing his brother looking like skin and bones, clearly malnourished, a wave of pity washed over him.

“Little Brother, I’ve been in the manor for nearly a month. Have you eaten any meat?” Li Xian asked.

“Brother, I’m not stupid. Aside from buying books, I spent all the money on meat. I’ve even had fatty meat several times,” Li Xiaofan said with an awkward smile.

“Really?” Li Xian raised an eyebrow. “Then how much is left?”

Li Xiaofan shrank back, his heart filled with guilt. “I’ve already used most of it.”

Li Xian reached out and snatched the cloth pouch containing the money from Li Xiaofan’s chest.

“Brother…”

Before Li Xiaofan could react, Li Xian had untied the string. Inside, there were still three hundred and eighty copper coins.

In nearly a month, he had only spent one hundred and twenty coins.

Li Xian calculated mentally: “Pork jerky in the west of the city costs fifty copper coins per catty. If you buy neck meat or mixed scraps, thirty coins would be enough.”

“If you ate meat every two or three days, it’s impossible that you only spent one hundred and twenty coins. And you still had to buy books. Little Brother, health is the foundation of everything. You must never skimp on food.”

“Now that we have money, you should eat meat. Why save it?”

Li Xiaofan lowered his head and didn’t argue. How could he be willing to use his brother’s blood money to buy meat for himself?

Wouldn’t that be like eating his brother?

Therefore, his daily meals consisted of digging for wild vegetables outside the city, just enough to fill his stomach. Every coin had to be spent where it was needed most. Only by doing this could he live up to his brother’s sacrifice.

Seeing his brother’s expression, Li Xian let out a long sigh, then smiled. “Sigh, I’ll take you to eat meat and buy you a new set of clothes.”

For the next half of the day, Li Xian accompanied Li Xiaofan to eat a meal of fatty pork.

Considering that winter had already arrived, and the room had neither quilts nor protection from the wind, he also bought a padded jacket.

The world was a harsh place.

Wearing new clothes would inevitably attract envy. Li Xian told his brother to wear the new clothes inside and wrap the father’s linen clothes on the outside. He should try not to go to unfamiliar places.

After doing all this, Li Xian also visited Aunt Liu next door. He gave her thirty copper coins and asked her to look after his brother for the next while.

Aunt Liu was a kind person. After accepting the money, she agreed immediately and praised Li Xian for being promising and a good big brother.

“Brother, are you leaving again?” Li Xiaofan’s eyes were moist, knowing his brother wouldn’t stay long.

Li Xian gave all his earnings from this month to Li Xiaofan and solemnly instructed, “This is eighty copper coins. Remember to eat meat, eat meat, eat meat.”

“I know,” Li Xiaofan said, clenching his fists tightly.

“I know you’re smart, but you can’t fool your brother,” Li Xian smiled. “Repeat it three times yourself.”

“Eat meat, eat meat, eat meat,” Li Xiaofan said obediently. “Brother, I remember.”

“Alright, it’s getting late. Go back quickly,” Li Xian waved his hand and turned to walk away quickly.

His figure turned the corner of the alley and disappeared completely. Li Xiaofan took a few steps forward, his gaze dimming, and returned to the small, shabby thatched hut.

The house was bare, with only a creaking wooden bed. He lay on the bed, took out the wrinkled books, and calmed himself to read.

Only through studying could there be a way out.

...

...

On a mountain path three to five miles from the One Unity Manor.

The cold wind blew, adding a touch of desolation.

Four people were walking together, their voices occasionally carrying over:

“Fourth Brother, it’s a pity you didn’t come. You have no idea, the women there are truly seductive.”

“Everyone says the brothel is a money-draining pit, and that’s no lie.”

“Yeah, when that woman breathed on me, my whole body went weak.”

“Sigh, thinking back now, I really regret it. I couldn’t hold back, and all my earnings from half a month went down the drain.”

On the way back, Zhao Han and the other two reminisced about the revelry in the brothel, the beauty in their arms, her fragrant breath, and the lingering scent. They still found it回味无穷 (a lingering aftertaste).

Unfortunately, as a D-rank servant, their rank was too low, their authority limited. Even if they asked for leave, they couldn’t stay overnight outside the manor.

Seeing that night was approaching, they headed back to the manor together.

“Ah!”

“Commander Pang!”

As they approached the manor gate, Zhao Han, still carrying a hint of drunkenness, suddenly caught sight of Pang Long’s figure. The alcohol instantly dissipated. He hurried forward to pay his respects.

Pang Long swept his gaze over the four of them淡淡地 (calmly). “You took your earnings and asked for a day off just to go to the brothel for entertainment?”

“Y-yes,” Zhao Han scratched his head.

“As long as you don’t violate the manor rules, I have no right to ask where you go,” Pang Long said calmly.

His gaze then fell on Li Xian. He frowned, sighed, and shook his head, revealing a look of disappointment. “Li Xian, you are still in the assessment period. They can indulge in pleasure because they have already established their footing.”

“But you’ve just become a guard. Instead of seizing the time to diligently practice the Four Directions Fist, you’re wasting your body like this. You’ve disappointed me greatly.”

“Commander Pang, you misunderstood…” Li Xian smiled, wanting to explain.

“No need for more words. Martial arts do not lie.”

Pang Long waved his hand. “On the day of assessment, I will personally be there. If you do not meet my standards and master this martial art, you can go back to being a servant.”

He turned and strode away.

Li Xian watched Pang Long’s retreating figure. Hearing the tone of disappointment, his heart was actually very calm.

It is best to be appreciated by someone. However, one must be made of strong stuff to forge iron. Rather than racking one’s brains to win appreciation, it’s better to walk one’s own path steadily.

He knew what he wanted and what he was doing.

“Fourth Brother… Should we three go help you explain?” Zhao Han asked, feeling a bit embarrassed.

“No need, there’s nothing to explain about this matter,” Li Xian shook his head and smiled. “Besides, as a great man, is there anything wrong with visiting a brothel?”

The second brother, Wang Chun, widened his eyes. “You can say visiting a brothel with such righteousness. Fourth Brother, Fourth Brother, I am inferior to you.”

Time flew by, and it was the day of assessment.

That morning, the guards went about their morning training as usual. Li Xian stood in a secluded corner, legs apart, throwing punches in an orderly fashion.

[Four Directions Fist]
[Proficiency: 658/1000 Proficient]

Li Xian felt a sense of gradually entering a wonderful state. When throwing punches, he no longer needed to recall the patterns from the manual. With just a thought, the fist锋 would immediately arrive.

The more he practiced, the faster he became.

According to the说法 (saying) of martial artists, this was the realm of "Shedding the Manual." That is, having moved past the manual, one begins to have one’s own understanding, cultivating one’s own style in the art of fist.

"This Four Directions Fist is of great help to me."

"Although this fist technique is basic, it is systematic. There are experience-based teachings on how to deal with enemies and how to defend against them."

Li Xian sensed a warm current in his lower abdomen.

The internal energy had accumulated to the size of a fist. With a thought, he could channel the internal energy to附着 (attach) to his fist. With one punch, he could bring up a gust of劲风 (strong wind), accompanied by the sound of "Pa, pa, pa."

The subtlety of this fist technique lies in how to借力打力 (borrow strength to strike back) and how to skillfully engage when attacked from the front and back.

For a guard, this is completely sufficient.

[Skill: Running]
[Proficiency: 164/1500 Small Success]
[Description: Swift as the wind, breath as long as a river, flowing endlessly. In climbing mountains and wading through waters, you have领悟ed (understood) the mystery of running. Vitality slightly enhanced.]

"Morning training running is almost effortless for me."

"It’s just right for warming up."

Li Xian was沉浸在 (immersed in) his gains.

"Commander Pang is here!"

Suddenly, a voice was heard from the crowd. Turning his head, he saw Pang Long striding into the courtyard.

Li Xian收了架势 (retracted his stance) and walked toward Pang Long.

"Li Xian, today is your assessment day. I think I don’t need to say much more," Pang Long got straight to the point.

The guards all walked over, forming a large circle, enclosing Pang Long and Li Xian within.

Every guard must undergo a new recruit assessment. To be blunt, a guard’s martial arts talent can be fully seen through the new recruit assessment.

But people are different, conditions are different, and the martial arts they practice are naturally different.

Some have long legs and are suitable for learning the Four Directions Leg. Some have short statures and learn the Ground-Shielding Skill. Some have tough skulls and learn the Iron Head Skill.

"Commander Pang, I understand," Li Xian nodded heavily.

"Sigh!" Luo Tongyun let out a timely sigh, revealing a look of pity.

"Luo Tongyun, Li Xian was taught by you. This assessment should naturally be conducted by you," Pang Long said calmly. "Do not show partiality. Otherwise, you will be punished as well. Call it as it is."

"Brother Li, you’ve heard him," Luo Tongyun said helplessly, shrugging his shoulders, and stepped forward.
