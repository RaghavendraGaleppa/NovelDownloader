# Chapter 44: Sword Armor, Phantom Star, and Little Titan

The origins of Star Spirits are mysterious and ever-changing, with nearly every Star Spirit being unique. Every cultivator who obtains one guards it jealously, fearing discovery, so there are almost no records on the raising of Star Spirits in the open market.  

Gu Yuan couldn't identify the name of the Star Spirit before him.  

However, Lan Tianlu had already demonstrated its general abilities and how to raise it. After briefly feeding the Star Spirit, Gu Yuan stored it in his spirit beast pouch, planning to study it in detail later.  

At the moment, he wasn’t sure how to bind the Star Spirit, but according to *The Annals of Star Spirits Over Forty Millennia*, it seemed the "Soul Contract Method" could be used.  

But this wasn’t the place to delve into such matters. After securing the Star Spirit, Gu Yuan first retrieved Lan Tianlu’s storage pouch, then set his corpse ablaze with a single flame, leaving no trace behind.  

---  

Inside Lan Tianlu’s storage pouch were several treasures: a top-grade artifact, the "Soulguard Bell," a high-grade defensive artifact, the "Seven Mysteries Mirror," and an elite-grade artifact, the "Purple Lightning Chisel," capable of unleashing lightning strikes powerful enough to wound a seventh-layer Qi Refining cultivator—a truly formidable weapon.  

This had been one of Lan Tianlu’s trump cards.  

With so many artifacts and the Star Spirit at his disposal, he had ventured into the Shell Field to reclaim his opportunity. Unfortunately, he had crossed paths with Gu Yuan.  

The Eight Winds Treasure Ring, a gift from a Golden Core elder, was something Lan Tianlu, despite his considerable luck, had no means to counter.  

Beyond these three artifacts, there were also the "Water Veil," the "Shell-Seeking Compass," the "Mist Shuttle," and other miscellaneous tools, along with several bottles of pills and over a hundred spirit stones.  

Though Lan Tianlu’s resources had dwindled after his younger cousin’s birth, he had still been a direct descendant of the Lan family, and his storage pouch held no shortage of valuables.  

Moreover, there were artifacts and demon beast corpses that appeared unrefined.  

Now, all of it belonged to Gu Yuan.  

*"Truly, a horse grows fat on stolen grass, and a man grows rich on ill-gotten gains!"*  

*"The struggle in the Shell Field isn’t just over pearls and demon beasts—it’s also over the blood of fellow disciples!"*  

As he stowed away the storage pouch, Gu Yuan couldn’t help but sigh.  

In just a few months since joining the sect, two fellow disciples had already met their end by his hand.  

What’s more, if his suspicions were correct, those unrefined artifacts likely belonged to Yang Yue and the others who had perished outside the Shell King’s lair.  

Without having accomplished anything, several fellow disciples had already died. Gu Yuan almost felt like he carried the aura of a "calamity" or a "heretic."  

But he quickly shook his head, dismissing such thoughts.  

The path of cultivation was fraught with trials at every step—why dwell on pointless sentimentality?  

*"I can only hope the opportunity within this Shell Field satisfies me. Otherwise, the Lan family might still prove to be a variable."*  

---  

With that thought, Gu Yuan stepped forward toward the skeletal remains seated cross-legged atop the jade bed.  

This was the true purpose of his journey.  

---  

The skeleton bore nothing else—only a single jade slip of bluish-green hue.  

Taking a deep breath, Gu Yuan picked it up and extended his spiritual sense to examine its contents.  

A flood of intricate information surged into his mind, startling him.  

**"Seed Body Seal!"**  

*"Human potential is limited, yet external forces are boundless. Why not harness these forces to nurture oneself?"*  

*"Heaven and earth produce spiritual roots and exotic plants that absorb spiritual energy and bear fruit—why can’t humans do the same?"*  

*"Extract essence blood, inscribe Dao patterns, fuse spiritual roots and exotic plants with the human body, and plant them in spiritual fields. When the flowers bloom and the fruits ripen, consume them in one gulp—wouldn’t that drastically increase cultivation and spontaneously generate seals?"*  

What followed was an exhaustive and complex series of procedures, leaving Gu Yuan momentarily dazed before he regained his composure.  

*"This is actually a Dharma Body Seal!"*  

Setting down the jade slip, Gu Yuan’s expression turned somewhat disappointed.  

He had held high hopes for this half-silver opportunity.  

A half-silver opportunity at the Qi Refining stage was already exceedingly rare. If it was solely for Qi Refining, even a half-silver opportunity could drastically alter one’s fate.  

The Four Spirit Jade Pillars from before had been a nearly full-silver opportunity, but they also contained potential benefits for the Foundation Establishment stage.  

If this opportunity was exclusively for Qi Refining and still ranked as half-silver, it must be extraordinarily precious, capable of significantly accelerating his cultivation.  

Gu Yuan had hoped to obtain a "Body Seal" that could alter his innate potential.  

The jade slip in his hands did indeed offer a way to modify one’s aptitude, but it wasn’t a true "Body Seal." Instead, it was a special type of "Dharma Body Seal."  

A true Body Seal, once successfully forged, would permanently merge with the cultivator’s body, fundamentally altering their physique and potential without any degradation.  

A "Dharma Body Seal," however, employed esoteric methods to temporarily enhance a cultivator’s cultivation speed and aptitude through shortcuts.  

Once the "seal" dissipated, the enhancements would instantly revert.  

Because most of these seals were designed to improve aptitude and refine the physical body, they were called "Dharma Body Seals."  

The one in Gu Yuan’s possession utilized a unique method to nurture a "Heaven-Earth Mutant," which would then augment the cultivator’s power.  

During the cultivation process, this mutant would absorb spiritual energy and, every month or so, produce a peculiar "Dharma Leaf."  

Consuming this leaf would grant the cultivator an equivalent period’s worth of cultivation, as if the mutant had meditated on their behalf for an extra month.  

---  

Nourished by the cultivator’s essence blood, the mutant shared their origin, so consuming its leaves carried no side effects—the resulting spiritual energy was identical to their own.  

Moreover, after producing twelve Dharma Leaves—equivalent to one year of cultivation—the mutant would bear a "Dharma Fruit."  

Eating this fruit would grant an additional six months’ worth of cultivation.  

Most crucially, depending on the type of mutant cultivated, it would eventually yield a unique "Seal Fruit."  

Consuming this fruit would bestow a peculiar "Dharma Seal," imbued with extraordinary powers.  

The jade slip detailed three distinct mutants and their cultivation methods.  

The first was the **Sword Armor Tree**.  

Shaped like a blade with leaves resembling armor, it produced one leaf every two months. After two years of cultivation, it would yield the "Hundred Armor Sword Seal."  

This seal could be used for both offense and defense—when guarding, it formed an impenetrable armor, and when attacking, it unleashed a storm of a hundred swords, swift and explosive.  

The second was the **Phantom Star Flower**.  

Standing three feet tall, it bore one petal every two and a half months. After two and a half years, it would produce the "Phantom Void Seal."  

This seal excelled in illusion techniques—those below the user’s cultivation level would find it impossible to resist, and even those slightly stronger would be momentarily dazed.  

The third was the **Little Titan Tree**.  

Sturdy and thick, it produced one leaf per month. After one year, it would yield the "Little Titan Seal."  

This seal greatly enhanced spiritual energy, physical strength, and spiritual sense, amplifying all techniques. The weak could become strong, the strong could become peerless, and the elite could reach the pinnacle of power.  

The jade slip meticulously described the seals produced by these three cultivation methods.  

After a quick glance, Gu Yuan stored it away.  

The seals couldn’t be converted into immediate strength—he could deliberate on his choice later. For now, there was one more pressing matter.  

Gu Yuan looked up at the hole in the ceiling and the pearl at the center of the cave, which repelled the surrounding waters.
