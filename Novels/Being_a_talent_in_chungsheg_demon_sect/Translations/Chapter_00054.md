Chapter 54: When Fortune Comes, Heaven and Earth Work in Concert

Outside the Skull Mountain Market, within a temporarily opened cave dwelling.

Seven-colored light steamed and shimmered. Within the light, a woman of exquisite beauty sat meditating and recuperating, absorbing the ethereal glow with each breath.

After a moment, all the seven-colored light finally converged.

The colors then gradually merged, transforming into a pure white divine light, utterly pristine and without any impurity, which shone down upon her.

"I've succeeded!"

As the pure white divine light solidified, the woman in its midst immediately opened her eyes, her face filled with joy: "Seven-Colored Pure Light Qi! My Qi Condensation is complete!"

The cultivation method she practiced was passed down by an elder of the Sacred Sect. The "Seven-Colored Pure Light Qi" she refined, though appearing pure white, was actually formed by the fusion of seven distinct colors: red, orange, yellow, green, cyan, blue, and purple. Each ray signified a purification, and after seven such purifications, her True Qi had reached the fourth rank!

"With this, I can truly hope for Foundation Establishment."

Immortal Feixia sighed. As for fourth-grade True Qi being insufficient to achieve the Golden Core stage, it held no impact on her; she had never harbored such grand aspirations anyway.

"Finding a Cloud-Gathering Stone this time was indeed a stroke of luck."

"It's just a pity for Junior Brother Lu. Cultivation is a path against the heavens. If he had left the market with me, perhaps he too would have had some hope of reaching Qi Condensation perfection."

Having achieved her breakthrough, Immortal Feixia's perspective had shifted.

Previously, she had allied herself with Lu Yang because he guarded the market and possessed strength comparable to a cultivator at the Grand Perfection of Qi Condensation. But now that she herself had broken through, Lu Yang no longer held the same significance.

After all, "comparable" was ultimately inferior to the real thing.

Without his defensive array, Lu Yang's strength, in her opinion, was no longer impressive enough.

Furthermore, Immortal Feixia harbored dissatisfaction with Lu Yang's excessively cautious behavior earlier, feeling it was merely a flimsy excuse for his own lack of strength.

Boom!

Just then, the ground violently shook. Above the sky, a spiritual tide surged, and vast spiritual energy swept over, nearly causing Immortal Feixia to stumble.

"What's going on!?"

Immortal Feixia quickly conjured her escape light, flying into the sky. She gazed towards the distant center of the surging spiritual tide, and her beautiful face suddenly paled.

"Is that the market?"

Rumble!

A second loud boom reverberated, unleashing another massive wave of spiritual energy, as if someone had detonated a spiritual energy bomb. Immortal Feixia hastily enveloped herself in her Seven-Colored Pure Light Qi for protection.

However, compared to the mighty power of heaven and earth, her Seven-Colored Pure Light Qi was still missing that most crucial final step. Her fourth-grade True Qi struggled to hold firm, and for a moment, she was like a small boat tossed amidst furious waves, swaying continuously. Her divine light, originally pristine white, gradually began to reveal its underlying seven colors once more.

"This is... the aftermath of a magical battle!?"

While summoning her Haze-Dwelling Smoke Shroud to stabilize her form, Immortal Feixia's face contorted in horror: "Someone is fighting so fiercely in the market that it can cause such phenomena?"

Junior Brother Lu... he wouldn't have died, would he?

Immortal Feixia's heart was chilled. She immediately flew towards the market, only to see from afar a lone figure at the heart of the spiritual tide, being besieged by multiple opponents.

There were three attackers. Immortal Feixia recognized them, and her expression grew even more shocked.

"Jade Axis Sword Pavilion's 'Taiyi Sword' Yun Zhiqiu, Divine Martial Gate's 'Sky-Overturning Titan' Ouyang Feng, and the rogue cultivator 'Demon-Subduing Zen Master' Mingchan... They're actually working together!?"

Her gaze fell upon the sky above Skull Mountain Market, where a blood-colored sword array spread across the heavens. Ten thousand rays of bloody light transformed into a vivid, lifelike eight-clawed true dragon with clear scales and claws. It charged left and right, swept its tail, and slammed with its horns. Finally, it let out a sudden, thunderous dragon roar, and it was this very roar that stirred the surrounding spiritual tide.

"Break!"

Each time the spiritual tide erupted, it forced Yun Zhiqiu, Ouyang Feng, and Mingchan to temporarily retreat. But soon, the three would regroup and press on again.

"Amitabha, I didn't expect Benefactor Lu to possess such a fortunate encounter... Third-grade True Qi!"

Mingchan clasped his hands, a hint of surprise on his usually calm face. Third-grade True Qi... this was already the level of true disciples in the major sects!

Thinking of this, Mingchan's expression became even more benevolent: "Benefactor is indeed fated with this monk. This time, I shall send Benefactor to reincarnation, and I will ascertain Benefactor's third-grade cultivation method. When Benefactor returns in a future reincarnation, this monk will return the cultivation method to Benefactor intact, thus fulfilling our master-disciple destiny."

"Bald ass, you seek death!"

Lu Yang sneered, his True Qi-transformed great dragon roared once more, and at the same time, the Blood Sun Sword Pill emerged, its sword array expanding with a roar.

"Goodness, goodness. We are acting on behalf of heaven. Why does Benefactor persist in such futile efforts?"

Mingchan, seeing this, did not try to clash head-on. He immediately shook his kasaya, and the seven treasures adorning it — Ruyi Pearl, Mani Pearl, Dust-Expelling Pearl, among others — instantly shone with brilliant Buddhist light.

Relying on this protective Buddhist light, he retreated calmly, avoiding entanglement in Lu Yang's sword array.

In fact, the Blood Sun Sword Pill played a crucial role in Lu Yang's ability to hold on until now.

After all, the great array within the sword pill ensured that the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light would inevitably hit its target and was extremely powerful. Whenever he found himself at a disadvantage, he could use it to turn the tide of battle.

Of course, if he truly faced utter defeat, the Hundred Bones Return to Truth Great Array could still save his life, allowing him to make a comeback.

Beyond that, another reason for the prolonged fight was that none of the three attackers were willing to go all out.

'They're afraid of my Profound Yin Body-Seizing Great Art.'

Lu Yang knew very well that the more intense the fight, the more likely vital energies would leak. Once he seized them, it would undoubtedly be a fatal blow.

Therefore, Yun Zhiqiu and the others' plan was simple: exhaust Lu Yang. They were, after all, three Grand Perfection Qi Condensation cultivators, and their individual combat strengths were considerable. Now, with three of them teaming up against an eighth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator, their chances of victory were absolute, even if Lu Yang had two powerful arrays as his reliance, it would be futile.

"If I were *only* at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, then that would indeed be the case..."

Lu Yang's eyes flickered. He looked up at the sky, and a sudden, profound realization dawned on him: Today, right now, is the precise moment to break through!

The next second, Lu Yang let out a long, defiant roar, looking up at the heavens.

And at this very moment, his True Qi violently expanded, actually pushing towards the ninth layer of Qi Condensation!

Seeing this scene, Yun Zhiqiu and the others were momentarily stunned, then immediately scoffed: "Ignorant fool! Breaking through during a fight? Did you read too many wuxia novels?"

Breaking through during a fight was tantamount to seeking death!

Which cultivator didn't seek secluded meditation and absolute quiet when breaking through?

This was because during a breakthrough, True Qi erupted, requiring complete and unwavering concentration. But if you were engaged in combat, with external enemies distracting you, how could you possibly focus your mind on the breakthrough?

However, at this moment, above Skull Mountain.

From a "high and mighty" place, a gaze descended, overlooking the people within Skull Mountain, as if observing dolls on a sand table.

"Interesting, audacious... and perceptive enough to judge the situation. Not bad."

True Person Yinshan chuckled lightly. Then he extended his hand and flicked it gently, as if plucking a zither string, and the seemingly certain death situation below suddenly changed dramatically!

This change was felt most deeply by Lu Yang.

Just a moment ago, he felt his True Qi was chaotic, and his forced breakthrough was ill-prepared, making him extremely likely to suffer qi deviation. But suddenly, everything changed.

His True Qi became 'chaotic' in precisely the right way, as if by incredible luck, it perfectly met the requirements for a breakthrough. The bottleneck also 'unexpectedly' wasn't as formidable as imagined, allowing him to break through it with a single push. And his mental state—a sudden flash of inspiration, as if by 'instinct'—effortlessly stabilized his cultivation after the breakthrough.

Coincidence? Luck so unbelievable it defied reason!

Is this what it feels like to be a "Son of Destiny"? When fortune comes, heaven and earth work in concert. He didn't even need to deliberately do anything; he could achieve the desired result!

Boom!

The next second, Lu Yang, under the utterly astonished gaze of Yun Zhiqiu and the other two, brazenly broke through, successfully cultivating the last transformation of the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art"—the Flying Fish Transformation.

And the Flying Fish Transformation primarily focused on "breaking barriers"!

Therefore, Lu Yang had no pause. His newly ascended True Qi expanded again, and with the boost from the Flying Fish Transformation, he charged directly towards the bottleneck of the tenth layer of Qi Condensation!

And then he 'naturally' broke through again!

Nine Transformations Dragon, Qi Condensation Perfection!

"Roar!"

Immediately, a clear dragon roar echoed throughout the entire Skull Mountain! The sound swept past Yun Zhiqiu and the others, revealing their stiff, utterly astonished faces.

"This is impossible... No! Is a True Person manipulating karma!?"

The next second, Yun Zhiqiu and the others finally reacted, their faces filled with terror.

Lu Yang stood proudly in the air, then turned to look at the three, a chilling smile playing on his lips: "Understood? *This* is what you call acting on behalf of heaven!"

When a Foundation Establishment True Person has a single thought, heaven and earth change drastically!

To Qi Condensation cultivators, a Foundation Establishment True Person *is* heaven. Whoever has a True Person as a backer is the true Son of Destiny, and *that* is who is truly acting on behalf of heaven!

"Amitabha..."

The next second, Mingchan, without another word, shook his kasaya. Buddhist light exploded, and his figure was the first to vanish.
