# Chapter 277: Promotion to Token Bearer, Essence Digestion, and the Signs of the Turbid Garment Appearing All Over!

The "Water Altar" of the Flower Cage Gate was an island in full bloom. The island was vast, covered in endless flowers of every color, dazzling and enchanting.

As soon as one stepped onto the island, a riot of colors assaulted the eyes, making one dizzy and unsure where to step.

The gate was in the east, with a stone tablet outside inscribed with the words "Peach Blossom Town." The calligraphy was exceptionally robust, written in the cursive script of the Nanyang period.

Li Xian, nurtured by Wen Caishang, had calligraphy that still needed practice, but his discerning eye was already quite sharp. He had memorized the evolution of calligraphy through the ages. He observed the inscriptions carefully and nodded repeatedly.

Inside the town were long streets paved with bluestone and towering pavilions.

Mischievous children chased butterflies and played with bees, farmers plowed the fields and planted rice, and women tended to flowers and watered them.

Peach Blossom Town had about forty thousand households, filled with the songs of birds and the fragrance of flowers, peaceful and serene.

Distant mountains stood tall, and nearby, a babbling stream flowed.

Li Xian suddenly felt a jolt of surprise. He caught sight of a familiar figure and focused his gaze. The man was tall and sturdy, with scars on his face. His short hair was neat, and he looked quite robust.

It was actually "Pang Long"!

The Commander Pang of the One Union Manor.

Li Xian had once been assigned to guard "Black River Village." During that time, the One Union Manor had undergone tremendous changes. Pang Long had been injured repeatedly before mysteriously disappearing without a trace.

Li Xian furrowed his brow. A casual glance made him think the man was similar, but he couldn't be sure. He narrowed his eyes for a closer look. Seeing the slight droop of his shoulders, his broad palms, and his walking posture, it was very similar to Pang Long. It should be him.

"Is this person a fellow disciple?" Li Xian asked.

Qiao Sanyan smiled and said, "Of course, he is a disciple of the Flower Cage Gate. I once went on a mission with him and know his name is Pang Long. Do you know him?"

Li Xian thought to himself, "It really is Commander Pang!" He felt a hint of joy at meeting an old acquaintance in a strange land. But then he pondered:

"A person's temperament changes with their circumstances. After such a great change, it's hard to guess Commander Pang's temperament. The situation is still unclear, so it's better not to acknowledge him and avoid trouble."

He shook his head and smiled, saying, "We're meeting for the first time, so of course, I don't know him."

Pang Long heard the voice and looked over, staring at Li Xian's face. He was slightly startled and thought, "What a handsome figure." He felt a sense of familiarity but couldn't recognize him.

It turned out that Li Xian, having washed away his muddy nature, had a very handsome appearance. After being stationed at Black River Village, the two had rarely seen each other. It was during that period that Li Xian's appearance had changed dramatically.

In the past two years... Li Xian had been further nurtured by Wen Caishang, and his appearance had become even more extraordinary. He had transformed from a thin, lowly servant into a bright and handsome man. His demeanor, appearance, and perspective had all undergone a heaven-shaking change.

Now, he had also secretly applied some rouge to his face to somewhat conceal his handsome features.

After such a long time, Pang Long had been through many things, and his memory of Li Xian had faded. The combination of these factors made him feel that Li Xian looked familiar, but he couldn't immediately associate him with "Li Xian." Besides, in his memory, Li Xian was thin and delicate, handsome but not as striking as the person before him.

Li Xian cupped his fists and said, "Senior Brother Pang." Pang Long nodded slightly and turned to leave. Qiao Sanyan said, "Pang Long is taciturn and speaks little; that's just his nature."

Li Xian said, "It's fine. I don't mind." Qiao Sanyan said, "Let's go, let's continue our stroll."

Peach Blossom Town was lush with peach blossoms, their fragrance filling the air. The street scenery was beautiful, with a gentle breeze blowing, and pink leaves rustling down, blocking the damp, fishy smell of the lake.

Turning into a small alley, the aroma of wine wafted out. Qiao Sanyan smiled and said, "Brother Hua, the peach blossom wine here is exceptionally mellow and delicious. We've been eating fish soup for days, so it's time to treat you to something different."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Brother Qiao, I have no money."

Qiao Sanyan laughed, "Hahaha, I'll treat you! Are disciples of our Flower Cage Gate short of money?"

Tables and chairs were set up outside the wine shop. The fragrance of wine drifted out of the alley. Three children with braids ordered a bowl of fresh peach blossom wine and asked for three wooden chopsticks. They dipped the chopsticks in the wine and sipped it bit by bit.

The "Peach Blossom Wine" brewed by the Flower Cage Gate was an excellent wine. It had a wide market outside, with a mellow and fresh taste. It wasn't spicy or strong, but it could get one drunk imperceptibly.

Young and old alike craved this taste.

The Jade City, the Naked Body Gate, the Lishan Sword Sect... many sects also loved this fine wine. When hosting grand events or banquets, they would buy it in large quantities to entertain guests.

Qiao Sanyan bought a jar of fine wine and a few flower-infused drunken eggs. The wine shop owner carried the jar to their table. Qiao Sanyan paid about thirty copper coins for the wine.

He then smiled and said, "Brother Hua, outside, a mouthful of this peach blossom wine costs at least five hundred copper coins."

He tore off the cloth seal, and a rich aroma of wine filled the air. A closer look revealed four eggs floating in the jar.

It turned out that the so-called "flower-infused drunken eggs" were raw eggs hidden in the wine and brewed along with it, creating a unique flavor.

Qiao Sanyan said, "This is the flower-infused drunken egg, try it quickly!" He lightly tapped the jar. The wine splashed two streams into the thick-bottomed wine bowl. Two drunken eggs jumped out of the jar's mouth, landed on the table, and spun rapidly. Fine cracks appeared on the eggshells.

This technique was the "Heart-Shaking Palm." It was a basic martial art, and Qiao Sanyan had already mastered it. The palm force penetrated the jar, agitated the wine, and shook the eggs out. The control of the palm force was quite exquisite.

Li Xian praised, "Brother Qiao, what a fine technique!" Qiao Sanyan modestly smiled and said, "Brother Hua, your martial arts are also not bad, why don't you show us a thing or two?"

Li Xian laughed, "Hahaha, how could I dare show off in front of Brother Qiao?"

They peeled the eggshells. The flower-infused drunken eggs were crystal clear, and the meat was translucent. They had the mellow fragrance of wine, and the yolk was liquid, concentrating the essence of the wine with a sweet taste. Dipping them in some cumin sauce made the flavor even more unique.

Li Xian took a bite of the egg and a sip of wine, eating and drinking to his heart's content. Qiao Sanyan ordered two more plates of drunken fried peanuts and, mysteriously, a plate of side dish for wine.

When it was served, it turned out to be "live bee pupae," still squirming. They were white and tender, crystal clear, like jade or fat.

Eating them was sweet and refreshing, cutting through the greasiness. This was the "drunken pupae," a unique side dish for wine in Peach Blossom Town. Because the town was rich in all kinds of flowers, it attracted butterflies and bees, and there were many swarms.

Gathering the pupae from the bees was a common occurrence. Being stung by a bee was very painful, so people wanted to drink wine to relieve the pain. Over time, the "drunken pupae" dish was created.

After eating and drinking their fill, they walked a few more miles, taking a rough look at the high towers and pavilions in the town. The number of people gradually thinned, and they were about to leave the town.

Ordinary disciples of the Flower Cage Gate could buy residences in the town. They could open up mansions and fields, hire people to help manage them, or live there themselves.

Qiao Sanyan said, "Brother Hua, you've just arrived at the Water Altar and have no residence. What do you plan to do?" Li Xian said, "I ask for Brother Qiao's guidance."

Qiao Sanyan said, "There are inns in the town. If you're staying temporarily, you can rent a room. If you want to find a long-term place, you can either rent a mansion or buy your own."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Where do I have the money to buy a mansion?" Qiao Sanyan said, "Then you can rent a room first. The matter of a mansion is indeed not easy."

"The matter of renting a room, I suppose I don't need to lead the way. You can go by yourself. After you've settled everything, follow this path deep inside, and you'll see an island within the island. That's where disciples of our Flower Cage Gate exchange and spar, and buy martial arts items."

"By the way, we're going to hold a grand event. The rewards are quite generous. Your strength is not bad, so use this time to prepare well."

The two parted ways here.

Li Xian turned back to the town and used his remaining money to rent a room. The room was clean and tidy, with a bookshelf, desk, bed... it was fully equipped.

Ordinary disciples of the Flower Cage Gate had no right to enter or leave the island. They could only follow the elders' boats and obey their dispatch.

The current world was very chaotic, and the Flower Cage Gate had been besieged by various sects, with elders suffering casualties. Sometimes, for months on end, there was no boat traffic, which was extremely common.

After Li Xian had settled the room, he headed towards the "island within the island." Leaving Peach Blossom Town, he walked more than ten miles, winding and circling, and indeed saw a lake.

The lake was shrouded in white mist, hazy and indistinct. There were boats for crossing the water at the shore. He untied the rope and rowed towards the depths.

After another half an hour, he arrived at the "island within the island." More than a hundred boats were docked at the shore, with many Flower Cage Gate disciples coming and going.

The buildings inside the island were luxurious.

There was a Red Flower Pavilion, an Inquiry Martial Pavilion, a Flower Visit Pavilion, a Climbing Branch Pavilion, four academies for the east, west, south, and north, a Seeking Flower Residence, a fighting stage, an auction pavilion...

All kinds of buildings served their purposes. The Flower Cage Gate seemed scattered, but in reality, it used profit and lust to drive people, which was more effective than many rules and regulations.

The internal hierarchy was even more strict.

Disciples were divided into three levels: "Registered," "Token Bearer," and "Seal Bearer." Registered disciples had little real power. They had to obey dispatches and accumulate "Merit."

When Merit reached "one hundred," they could exchange for the sect's basic martial arts. After that, they had to endure for two years. Once they mastered the basic martial arts, they could become a "Token Bearer."

If their talent was exceptional and they mastered the basic martial arts to "perfection," they could skip the "enduring" stage and obtain a disciple token by passing an assessment.

Most Flower Cage Gate disciples failed at the enduring stage. Either they died midway, or they felt hopeless and fled.

The sect's "Merit" had many uses. It could be used as money at the Water Altar, exchanged for martial arts books, used for auctions... it was an important assessment for promotion.

Only after becoming a Token Bearer could one be considered a formal disciple of the Flower Cage Gate. They could sign up to participate in the grand event, have a certain status, and access corresponding places.

They gained certain ways to obtain resources.

When cooking essence food, they could also get a share of the essence soup. If they made great contributions, they could be rewarded with meat.

Li Xian pondered: "Since I have arrived at the Water Altar, the layout outside the island is complex. It's difficult to escape, so I might as well stay here and focus on accumulating strength. Nan Gong Liu Li comes from a great family, and even she said that although the Flower Cage Gate is despicable and shameless, its sect's secret arts are quite remarkable. Moreover... it has a deep relationship with some Candle Cult. If there's a chance, it wouldn't hurt to investigate a bit."

Li Xian looked around from east to west. The sky was gradually darkening, and disciples on the "island within the island" were leaving one after another in their boats.

Li Xian didn't stay long. He came to the shore and rowed back to Peach Blossom Town. Along the way, there were rustling sounds, and he could see fellow disciples. Some were young, some were old, covering a wide range.

Li Xian talked with them and learned that some disciples, in their thirties or forties, had stumbled into the Flower Cage Gate by chance and started their path of martial arts cultivation. They started late, but if their luck was good, they could still achieve a decent status.

Li Xian thought back to the scene at the One Union Manor. Starting as a servant, he fought desperately to become a guard. In this world... unless one is from a family, it's extremely difficult for an ordinary person to achieve anything in martial arts!

Returning to his room, the sky was already completely dark. The stars were shining in the sky, and the bright moon illuminated a thousand miles. The scenery was truly beautiful.

Li Xian pushed open the window, let the night breeze blow in, and sat in a daze for a long time. He remembered he hadn't washed his body. "Three Flowers Gathering at the Top" could blow away all filth with a single breath of "pure qi."

He had some free time today. He had thought the Water Altar would be a hellish place, filled with evil deeds and gathered villains, with a depressing atmosphere... but it was very different. Although it was still a gathering of villains and had many evil deeds, at least on the surface, it was peaceful.

His mind relaxed.

He spent a little money to buy a basin of hot water. He soaked in the hot water, letting his long hair down. His bones, muscles, and skin gradually relaxed under the enveloping water.

He let out a long sigh. He gathered the Three Flowers at the Top and spat out a mouthful of pure qi. He played with the pure qi in his hand to pass the time.

Peach Blossom Town was extremely quiet.

Li Xian's thoughts gradually drifted.

"Now that I've arrived at the Water Altar, it's peaceful and quiet here. Although the Flower Cage Gate is full of heinous villains, I, Li Xian, am like a lone leaf drifting with the wind, with no place to go."

"I originally wanted to go to the Yueshan Sword Sect, but such sects are competed for by the scions of great families. Even if I went to the foot of Yueshan Mountain, would they give me a second look?"

"Since I'm drifting with the wind and have landed here, I might as well settle down in the Water Altar first. Use the resources here to recuperate, advance my martial arts, and accumulate strength. As for the Flower Cage Gate's dirty dealings, I just won't participate."

"In that case... then tomorrow, I need to go to the island within the island again and promote myself to a 'Token Bearer'."

Li Xian reflected on himself, combined his current situation, chose his path, and planned his next step. He knew how to proceed and where to go. With a direction in mind, he felt an infinite drive.

After washing his body clean, Li Xian took out some rouge and darkened his face a bit. He then covered the red mole on his brow. He was very troubled by the two signs of transcendence. The red mole couldn't fade, so he had to use external objects like rouge to conceal it.

The double pupils needed to be controlled deliberately. Otherwise, if they were exposed, it would cause trouble. His full appearance was rarely shown. Only Wen Caishang and Zhao Zhiyuan had seen it. The latter was already dead.

Li Xian thought: "Only with stronger strength and no fear of external things can I truly reveal my true appearance. Otherwise... keep your trump cards hidden as much as possible!"

[You are transporting filth, proficiency +1]

Transporting filth, practicing quiet qi, nourishing blood and strengthening the body. There were no major matters on the island, and it was very peaceful.

[Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian · Five Organs Chapter]
[Proficiency: 599/1600 to Mastery]

The next day.

The Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian did not generate inner qi, but it was very effective for the digestion and absorption of "heaven and earth essence."

Last night, he digested seven strands of "heaven and earth essence," feeling refreshed and light as a swallow. He had already "gathered the Three Flowers at the Top," and was not far from "wearing the Turbid Garment."

Tattered rags, plain cloth clothes... Golden Phoenix Jade Robe... Void-芥 Demon Garment. Li Xian was very curious. Since fate is predetermined, and the Turbid Garment is also predetermined, what kind of garment would his destined one be?

He sorted through the miscellaneous items on his body and remembered the [Void-芥 Demon Garment], which could hide objects within the Turbid Garment and make them disappear. If he could hide all these miscellaneous items on his body in the Demon Garment, wouldn't he be much lighter?

He still had more than twenty taels of silver left, which was quite sufficient.

Yesterday's "fresh peach blossom wine" and "flower-infused drunken eggs" were extremely delicious. Li Xian, tempted by his craving, wanted to taste them again. Following his memory, he found the deep alley wine shop. He spent a few copper coins to buy three bowls of "fresh peach blossom wine" and two "flower-infused drunken eggs."

He drank the wine and ate the eggs. Drinking the wine, he sensed its flavor and felt a great deal. Naturally, he asked, "Shopkeeper, is your fresh peach blossom wine made from February peach blossoms, first marinated with fine white salt, then cooked and slowly simmered... finally, using freshly picked peach blossoms to wrap the layers of processed peach blossoms, put into a jar, and buried deep in the ground for a year to mature?"

The wine shopkeeper was startled and said, "Oh! Did you peek at my brewing process?!"

Li Xian smiled and said, "Just a wild guess." The wine shopkeeper insisted, "You must have peeked, otherwise how could you say it so clearly!"

Li Xian said, "Shopkeeper, I'm new here. How could I peek? Besides, this jar of wine has been brewing for at least several months. Could I have been following you all this time?"

The wine shopkeeper said, "Wait a moment!" He turned back into the house, secretly took out a cloth bag, and secretly stuffed it into Li Xian's hand.

Opening the bag, it contained more than ten taels of silver. Li Xian didn't understand its meaning. The wine shopkeeper pleaded, "Good young hero, since you've guessed my brewing secret, I beg you to keep it for me. Don't tell anyone, this is my old man's capital for survival. If you leak it, I... I'll have no way to live."

Li Xian suddenly understood. His "Tasting" skill was perfected, and he had acquired the "Appraisal" trait. He could taste the qi of all things and discern their secrets. He had just appraised the wine and figured out the brewing secret.

He realized the great use of this trait: "If I eat someone's dish, I can appraise the recipe. If I drink someone's fine wine, I can appraise the brewing secret. With this trait, how can I worry about not making money?"

"In the future, I'll hone my culinary skills, create world-shocking dishes, and make the warriors of the world spend thousands of gold just for a taste of my food. Wouldn't that be wonderful!"

Feeling excited, he returned the silver and said, "Don't worry, I will never leak the brewing secret. You can keep this money yourself!"

He turned and left.

The island within the island was very lively, and many disciples had gathered. Li Xian's small boat docked, and he walked straight to the "Climbing Branch Pavilion."

He wanted to be promoted to a "Token Bearer" and needed to go through a sect assessment. The Climbing Branch Pavilion was the place specifically for handling "rank" promotions.

The steward in the pavilion was named "Meng Han," an elder of the Flower Cage Gate. There weren't many people who wanted to be promoted today, about five or six.

They secretly sized each other up. Li Xian noticed that there were actually two women. They were charming and had good looks, but they were registered disciples of the Flower Cage Gate.

Li Xian was curious: "Good heavens... this is a wolf's den. Are they not afraid of being captured by mistake if they become disciples of the Flower Cage Gate?"

He suddenly felt a light pat on his shoulder, and a voice came from behind: "Brother, are you here for promotion? Where are you from?"

The speaker was also a registered disciple of the Flower Cage Gate, named Zhong Kai. Li Xian smiled and said, "A person from Qiong Tian Prefecture." Zhong Kai said, "Qiong Tian Prefecture... I've heard it's very poor."

Li Xian said, "Indeed." Zhong Kai said, "I just saw you looking at those two women?"

Li Xian smiled and said, "Just curious." Zhong Kai said, "It's best if it's just curiosity. I'm telling you... the women who can enter the Flower Cage Gate are definitely not ordinary people. They must be the direct disciples of 'Poison Flower Taoist'!"

Li Xian asked, "Poison Flower Taoist?" Zhong Kai shook his head and said, "I'm just kindly reminding you. Be careful, and don't get any wild ideas."

The Climbing Branch Pavilion steward, Meng Han, said to the crowd, "Those who want to take the test, come here and register your names!" He pointed to the jade table beside him, on which a name list was placed.

Everyone registered their names in order. Li Xian was at the end of the line. When registering, he could see the names of six people. The two women were named "Qu Xiaoyou" and "Zhou Xiuwan."

Li Xian scanned the other names one by one and then wrote down the three characters "Hua Wucuo."

Meng Han nodded slightly, stroked his beard, and waved to call a servant to check the "Registered Disciple" list. After confirming it was correct, he led everyone towards the depths of the pavilion.

They entered a room where a deity statue was enshrined, with incense burning continuously and smoke visible. In front of the statue was a candlestick, burning dozens of incense sticks.

Meng Han said, "For a registered disciple to be promoted to a token bearer, they must possess the sect's basic martial arts, have been in the sect for two years, have mastered the basic martial arts to proficiency, and then submit one hundred Merit coins to purchase a stick of incense. After paying respects to our sect's ancestor, they can receive a token."

"In the future, when cooking essence food, eating meat and drinking soup, extending life and longevity, will all be within reach."

Li Xian frowned inwardly. From what he learned yesterday about the sect rules, it seemed there was no need to purchase incense, nor to waste another hundred Merit coins.

An older disciple stepped forward, took out a green copper coin from his pocket. The front read "Candlelight Illuminates the World," and the back read "Sun and Moon Together in the Sky."

At that time, the Great Wu dynasty was in turmoil, and the casting of copper coins and silver... was extremely chaotic, with the court unable to control it. The official copper of Great Wu was inscribed with "Martial Arts Prosperous" and "Year After Year." However, local copper and silver were secretly altered...

Local copper coins were mixed with family surnames. This led to a multitude of currencies circulating in the Great Wu dynasty.

The Flower Cage Gate was born from the "Candle Cult," and the Merit coins referred to the remnants of the Candle Cult's currency. At that time, the Candle Cult was prosperous, its momentum unparalleled. The might of the Candle Cult shook the four seas, making true dragons bow their heads and the four seas calm. All disciples of the Flower Cage Gate who knew of that glorious history were excited and couldn't help but consider themselves as members of the Candle Cult, with tears in their eyes.

Therefore, the remnants of the Candle Cult's currency held extraordinary significance.

Meng Han said, "You are a bit older and have no great contributions. Considering your hard work, I will allow you to be a token bearer." He handed the Flower Cage Gate token to the old man.

Zhong Kai said, "Elder Meng, I haven't been in the sect for two years, but upon seeing the ancestor's statue, I feel immense reverence. I am willing to offer one hundred Merit coins to purchase incense for worship."

Meng Han beamed with joy and said, "Good, good, good child!"

Qu Xiaoyou and Zhou Xiuwan looked at each other and both said in charming voices, "We admire our ancestors. Although our experience is shallow, we are willing to purchase incense to offer to our ancestors."

Meng Han nodded repeatedly and said, "You two must be the high disciples of Poison Flower Taoist. Truly, dragons and phoenixes among men. Very good, very good. With this intention of yours, how can our Flower Cage Gate not flourish?"

Li Xian saw the trick. Purchasing 'incense' to offer to the ancestors was actually Meng Han using his position to extort from the disciples below. One hundred Merit coins were a large part of an ordinary registered disciple's savings for half a year, a veritable exorbitant demand.

If Li Xian had Merit coins, to ensure a smooth promotion, he would have temporarily endured the exploitation. But he really had no Merit coins. He pondered:

"Those who speak grandly while engaging in such private dealings for personal gain are definitely narrow-minded and petty people. Doing bad things is most annoying when someone points it out. There are many people here. If I say I'm willing to use silver to buy incense, he will be extremely angry and think I'm accusing him of abuse of power. He will still dislike me, so it's better to do nothing." So he held his ground and showed no reaction.

The other few people gritted their teeth secretly, all taking out Merit coins to purchase incense and worship the ancestor. Only Li Xian stood as if rooted, unmoving, his mind wandering in the heavens.

Meng Han frowned, stared at Li Xian for a long time, gave a slight "humph," and甩袖 (shuǎi xiù - flicked his sleeve) said, "Those whose experience is insufficient, follow me. I will lead you to test your martial arts."

Zhong Kai whispered, "Why didn't you buy incense? Don't you know Elder Meng is famous for being narrow-minded?"

Li Xian smiled bitterly and said, "I really don't know. Besides, I don't have any Merit coins." Zhong Kai was surprised and said, "How is that possible? Aren't you hiding some on purpose?"

"You, if you fail to be promoted, then the grand event has nothing to do with you. I've heard there's a huge prize for this event!"

Li Xian said, "It shouldn't be that way..."

Zhong Kai lost interest and said, "I don't understand you. Suit yourself." He walked away quickly.

Because purchasing the sect's basic martial arts required one hundred Merit coins, those who wanted to be promoted to a token bearer had to at least practice the sect's basic martial arts to proficiency or even perfection.

This process would take another half a year or a year. During this time, they could prepare Merit coins, curry favor with those above and below, and prepare for promotion.

Li Xian's situation was special. He was valued by Ye Cheng, who casually taught him the basic martial art "Flying Snake Hand," so he was different from others. Meng Han put his hands behind his back, activated "Coiled Intestine Small Step," and his figure became indistinct. Li Xian and the others all knew the secrets of Coiled Intestine Small Step and followed closely.

Suddenly, Meng Han made a wonderful sound with every step he took. His speed was incredibly fast, forming a melody. He had actually combined Coiled Intestine Small Step with the ethereal fairy sound.

The essence of the ethereal fairy sound is the sound made when a martial artist's bones collide. However, even a strong martial artist finds it difficult to control all the bones in their body like their arms. In battles and fights, they have no time to control their bones, so over time... high-level martial artists will integrate the ethereal fairy sound into certain moves. When they execute the moves, their body posture determines the direction of the bone momentum, which helps in playing the fairy sound.

Being able to naturally integrate it with the moves and execute them together yields a sudden and remarkable effect. Meng Han's Coiled Intestine Small Step, combined with the assistance of the fairy sound. Wherever he stepped, green flowers actually grew.

He walked further and further, and the sea of flowers spread, plunging them into a state of being both real and illusory. Li Xian secretly played the "Body-Protecting Sound," his mind firm and unshakable, and gradually broke free from the illusion.

It turned out that Meng Han was narrow-minded. Seeing that Li Xian didn't submit Merit coins, he deliberately used a hidden trick to make him fall behind completely.

Li Xian always kept up and never fell behind. Meng Han was very surprised and secretly glanced at Li Xian. At this time, they arrived at a stone room.

There were many wooden men inside. The Flower Cage Gate's basic martial arts were about seventeen types. Flying Snake Hand, Blowing Smoke Palm, Poison Sand Palm, Soft Body Technique...

Qu Xiaoyou and the others passed the test smoothly.

Soon it was Li Xian's turn. The martial art he practiced was the Flying Snake Hand. The Flying Snake Hand emphasized both softness and ferocity. Li Xian had a deep understanding of the essence of the martial art and demonstrated it in public. His hands were like soaring snakes, combining hardness and softness, striking vital points.

Zhong Kai and Qu Xiaoyou were both surprised. They felt this martial art was almost perfect, with hardly any flaws.

Meng Han frowned and said, "Flying Snake Hand? Who taught you to practice it like this?" He was determined to find fault and wouldn't let him pass easily.

Meng Han said淡淡ly (dàndàn de - calmly/indifferently), "Flying Snake Hand emphasizes insidiousness and venom. Your way is like flying and dancing, you've practiced it wrong."

Li Xian said, "It was taught by Elder Ye Cheng. He praised my rapid progress." He said "taught" but not "instructed," deliberately using Ye Cheng's name as a shield.

Meng Han's expression changed slightly. But he became angry and said, "You little servant, I'm correcting you and you're not convinced. I say you've practiced it wrong, so it's wrong. Go back and practice another one. This Flying Snake Hand doesn't suit you."

"I'm doing this for your own good. The wrong path, the further you go, the more you'll miss. Knowing when to turn back is the right solution. You may not understand now, but you'll definitely thank me later."

Li Xian said, "What Elder Meng says is absolutely right. But Elder Ye said there's no fixed way in martial arts. Young disciples don't have to blindly imitate their predecessors. They need to have their own understanding. He has also seen my Flying Snake Hand."

Meng Han thought: "Did Ye Cheng recruit a thorn this time?" He was very displeased and secretly angry. Since he became an elder, when had any disciple dared to defy him?

Meng Han said, "Since you're so persistent, fine. This test, I'll reluctantly count you as passed." His expression was gloomy, thinking: "You brat, I hope you really have a background. If I find out you're bluffing, see how I'll deal with you."

Li Xian's martial arts skill was solid, and the Flower Cage Gate's rules were like this. Although Meng Han intended to make things difficult, under these circumstances, he had nothing to say.

And so...

Li Xian successfully promoted to a 'Token Bearer', but in doing so, he offended Meng Han.

"Well... it's impossible to completely avoid such people."

Leaving the Climbing Branch Pavilion, he held the token and weighed it lightly. He felt a wave of confusion. The world is full of tricks. At this moment, he was a genuine Flower Cage Gate "Flower Thief."

The Flower Cage Gate's grand event was approaching. In the following days, boats arrived one after another, landing on the Water Altar island.

There were seven towns around the Water Altar, each with a boat dock outside. As boats docked, the island became increasingly crowded. Those with outstanding martial arts skills began to frequently show their faces, and their reputations spread.

Li Xian focused on himself. He practiced the Flying Snake Hand and the Blood Vomiting Canon day by day, silently accumulating strength. At night, he transported filth and digested the essence in his body.

A few days passed.

Li Xian occasionally inquired about Nan Gong Liu Li's situation. But it was all foggy, and he couldn't see a thing. He thought that a good person would have good fortune. All he could do was practice martial arts.

Li Xian's progress was steady and fast, and the three martial arts were progressing steadily. The heaven and earth essence was gradually being digested. "Gathering the Three Flowers at the Top" had shown signs for a long time, and gradually...

The characteristics of "Wearing the Turbid Garment" also began to appear!
