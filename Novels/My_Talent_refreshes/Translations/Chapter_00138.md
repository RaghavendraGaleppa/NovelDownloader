# Chapter 138: Enemies At the Door, Run First

“Another hour, and it should be about time.”

Chu Ning was originally cultivating the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art in his room, but as the appointed time gradually approached, even with his considerable focus, he found himself unable to cultivate with peace of mind.

He rose and exited the cultivation chamber, gazing at the sky outside.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!”

Just then, the sound of a giant bell suddenly echoed throughout the entire Green Creek Sect. It rang ten times before finally ceasing.

Chu Ning’s expression subtly changed. Ten bell tolls signified that the sect had encountered a powerful enemy.

Chu Ning’s original plan was to first go scouting nearby when it was almost dark. Then, as night just fell and it wasn’t too conspicuous, he would use Little White’s innate divine ability to bypass restrictions and slip out of the sect’s grand formation.

“Why would a strong enemy suddenly arrive?”

As this thought flashed through Chu Ning’s mind, a majestic voice resounded over the entire sect.

“All Green Creek Sect disciples, quickly assemble at your respective training grounds.”

Chu Ning recognized it immediately as the voice of Elder Zhu, the one with the dark face.

“The sect is facing a powerful enemy, but why isn’t Sect Master Xin Wuyai appearing? Why is Elder Zhu calling for assembly?”

A hint of doubt flickered in Chu Ning’s heart, but his expression had already turned ashen. When the sect encountered a powerful enemy, not only would the protective grand formation be strengthened, but more critically, disciples who didn't report to the training grounds would be specifically sought out.

“Can’t worry about that now, I need to run first.”

At this moment, Chu Ning gritted his teeth slightly, no longer willing to wait. He walked directly out of his cave abode, wondering if there would be enemies outside the grand formation at this very moment. But at this point, Chu Ning could only try; at worst, he would let Little White scout ahead.

“Chu Ning!”

Just as Chu Ning opened his cave abode door and stepped out, a figure suddenly appeared before him. It was He Litao, Xin Wuyai’s disciple.

“Martial Uncle He.”

Seeing He Litao, Chu Ning’s heart sank, a vague sense of unease settling in his heart. Sure enough, the next moment, Chu Ning heard He Litao’s faint voice:

“Master has ordered that with a strong enemy present, your cultivation is too weak. Go to his cave abode to take shelter first.”

Chu Ning was cursing inwardly, but on his face, he displayed righteous indignation: “Martial Uncle, there’s no need, is there? Aren't there enemies at our door? I also want to contribute to the sect.”

“With your cultivation realm, you won’t make a difference whether you’re there or not,” He Litao frowned slightly. “Let’s go, stop with the nonsense. There are others waiting.”

Hearing He Litao speak so, Chu Ning secretly sighed, regretting his bad luck. At this point, he could only obediently follow the other party towards Xin Wuyai’s cave abode. At the same time, he pondered how to deal with the situation next. He wondered who this so-called enemy was this time. Could it be the Yin Demon Sect again? He heard that the sect’s protective grand formation almost couldn't hold out last time. This time, surely it wouldn't truly be unable to resist? If so, who knew how many low-level disciples of the sect would die tragically. Everyone in the sect was in danger; even hiding in Xin Wuyai’s cave abode didn't necessarily guarantee safety.

Thinking this, Chu Ning couldn’t help but furrow his brow.

The two flew rapidly towards Xin Wuyai’s cave abode using wind manipulation, almost reaching their destination. At this moment, the sky suddenly darkened, as if something had blocked the sun. Chu Ning instinctively looked up, his face immediately filled with shock.

Above the sect, a colossal bird-like demonic beast had suddenly appeared in the sky. This beast was truly massive; even from such a distance, Chu Ning and the others could still make out its general shape. It was entirely black, without a single杂色, only its two eyes, as large as buckets, facing downwards, glowed blood-red. And on its broad back, many figures could vaguely be seen standing.

“Blackfire Vulture-Crow!” He Litao, beside Chu Ning, changed his expression slightly and whispered.

Chu Ning heard his words, and his expression also turned solemn. The Blackfire Vulture-Crow, a Class 6 demonic beast comparable to a mid-Core Formation cultivator, mainly came from the碧幽山脉 (Jade Abyss Mountain Range). Thus, the identity of the newcomers was self-evident.

“People of Green Creek Sect, listen up!” Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, a loud shout suddenly resounded in the sky. “Hand over the Qi Condensation disciples who obtained the Spiritual Charm Qi, otherwise, the sect will be annihilated!”

Hearing this, Chu Ning’s expression drastically changed. “They’re actually here for us!”

“Let’s go!” He Litao’s face also showed a hint of solemnity as he quickly led Chu Ning into Xin Wuyai’s cave abode. Vaguely, Chu Ning saw Elder Zhu with the dark face, the silver-haired Elder Mu, and the red-robed Elder Gui rising into the sky.

“Yin Demon Sect, don't bully us too much! Last time, we gave you the spirit seed, but you yourselves were incompetent. Now you come knocking again? Do you truly think there's no one left in our Green Gorge Mountain Range?” the silver-haired Elder Mu shouted loudly.

The next moment, the voice of that Yin Demon Sect cultivator resounded again. “Enough talk! Your Grand Sect Master Xin has already been tied up outside. You three Core Formation cultivators alone wish to resist? That’s nothing but a fool’s dream. Quickly hand over the disciples who obtained the Spiritual Charm Qi, or this Green Creek Sect will be erased from the cultivation world!”

...

After that, Chu Ning could no longer hear anything. It turned out that within Xin Wuyai’s cave abode, there was a restriction that cut off outside sounds.

Chu Ning entered the main hall of the cave abode and discovered that he wasn’t alone; six disciples were already present. Three of them were at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, while the other three had reached the Perfection stage of Qi Condensation. Seeing He Litao enter, everyone bowed to him. One of the Perfection stage Qi Condensation disciples immediately asked, “Martial Uncle He, what exactly happened outside? Who are these enemies?” Clearly, these people had entered the cave abode earlier and hadn’t witnessed the scene Chu Ning had just seen.

“These matters are for the sect’s Core Formation cultivators and your Foundation Establishment martial brothers and sisters to worry about. You all just stay here in peace,” He Litao didn’t directly answer the man. As he spoke, he seemed to recall that Chu Ning, having entered later, had seen what happened outside. He turned to Chu Ning and said, “Chu Ning, follow me!”

With that, he directly led Chu Ning to a separate stone room at the back of the cave abode. “You stay here. Don’t overthink what you just saw. When the Sect Master returns, he will naturally explain everything clearly to you.” After speaking, He Litao didn’t pay any further attention to Chu Ning and left directly.

“This truly shows that plans can’t keep up with changes.” Alone in the stone room, Chu Ning’s expression flickered between clear and overcast. This cave abode of Xin Wuyai’s was located in the sect’s core area, quite a distance from the sect’s protective grand formation. With He Litao outside, he had no way to leave. Furthermore, he didn't know the battle situation outside.

If Chu Ning had previously thought that it didn't matter if he missed this opportunity and could wait a few days, now that he knew the Yin Demon Sect was after the disciples who had obtained the Spiritual Charm Qi, his need to leave became even more urgent. He knew very well that if the sect truly couldn't hold out, the Green Creek Sect might very well sacrifice them. After all, no matter how important the spirit seeds were, they wouldn’t be more important than the sect’s survival. When the Yin Demon Sect’s Nascent Soul cultivator appeared last time, Xin Wuyai even let go of a spirit seed already in his grasp to preserve the sect. What were a few Qi Condensation disciples compared to that? Moreover, with the experience from last time, the Yin Demon Sect’s grand approach this time meant they were definitely well-prepared. Chu Ning naturally had a very dim view of the Green Creek Sect’s ability to resist the Yin Demon Sect’s attack.

His thoughts raced, but for a moment, he had no solution, which made Chu Ning frown tightly. Suddenly, Chu Ning’s gaze flickered slightly, looking at the floor. Then, he quickly released Little White from his spirit beast pouch.

“Ying!” As soon as it appeared, Little White chirped at Chu Ning in confusion. It seemed puzzled why they weren't leaving through the sect’s restrictions as previously discussed. Chu Ning ignored it for the moment and asked Little White, “Can you sense if there are any restrictions beneath the cave abode’s floor?”

“Ying!” Little White nodded, then transmitted its divine sense to Chu Ning. Hearing Little White’s transmission, Chu Ning couldn’t help but sigh faintly. “Then it won’t work. You can only take me through a restriction once. Even if we bypass this cave abode’s restriction, we won’t be able to get through the sect’s grand formation.”

At this moment, Little White’s divine sense transmission suddenly echoed in his mind. “I can use my divine ability twice.”

“What?!” Chu Ning was startled by these words, almost exclaiming. However, he suppressed it and began communicating with Little White via divine sense. After some discussion, Chu Ning roughly understood the situation. It turned out that when he was refining the Spiritual Charm Qi some time ago, his ability to draw in heaven and earth spiritual energy was too strong. This little fellow, by absorbing spiritual energy along with him each time, had also gained some improvements in its strength. Although it hadn’t crossed the threshold of a Class 1 demonic beast to enter Class 2, its internal spiritual power had increased, allowing it to sustain two uses of its innate divine ability within a short period.

Upon hearing this news, Chu Ning was greatly invigorated. “Little White, is there any difference between the restrictions within this cave abode and the sect’s protective grand formation? Can you use one instance of your ability to take me out of this cave abode, and then I’ll use the Earth Escape Art to reach the edge of the sect’s protective grand formation, where you can then take me through the grand formation again?”

Hearing Chu Ning’s words, Little White blinked. It seemed Chu Ning had conveyed too much information at once, and it hadn’t fully processed it. After a moment, Little White transmitted its divine sense. Although the little fellow couldn’t express its full meaning perfectly, Chu Ning could generally understand. And after listening, Chu Ning’s eyes flickered slightly.

Little White told him that it had sensed before that at the edge of the protective grand formation, the ground beneath was also restricted. That kind of restriction extended vertically downwards, just like the protective grand formation in the sky above. So it had no problem breaking through from underground. Chu Ning wasn’t surprised by this; the protective grand formation was meant to be an all-around defense. If people could escape from underground, the defense would be useless.

However, the restrictions within this cave abode were different. Instead of the outer restrictions extending downwards, there was a single layer of restriction directly enclosing the entire cave abode. The restriction underground was only two zhang deep; one could reach its edge by digging slightly downwards from the surface and then break through.

Hearing this, a plan immediately formed in Chu Ning’s mind. First, escape through the underground restriction, then use the Earth Escape Art to reach the edge of the protective grand formation, and finally, Little White would use its innate divine ability again to take him out. Under normal circumstances, this method would certainly not work because there were too many Foundation Establishment cultivators in the inner sect. Using the Earth Escape Art from underground would make it extremely easy to be discovered by cultivators above ground. But now, due to the Yin Demon Sect’s attack, the Foundation Establishment cultivators were all concentrated. As long as he kept a distance, and they weren’t specifically looking for him, he shouldn’t be discovered.

Thinking of this, Chu Ning immediately felt it was worth a try. Even if he were discovered, at worst, he could say he was worried about the Yin Demon Sect breaking in and himself falling into the hands of demonic cultivators, so he decided to hide first. After a brief consideration, Chu Ning pulled out a handful of Earth Escape Talismans from his storage pouch. These low-grade mid-tier talismans were self-made, and he had plenty in his storage pouch.

Chu Ning held one in his hand and said to Little White: “Little White, now I’ll take you with me to use the Earth Escape Art to reach the restriction. You must take me out of this cave abode immediately. Then, during the Earth Escape process, please help me watch out. If there are any restrictions underground, tell me in advance so I can avoid them.” Chu Ning had to be careful; after all, some cave abodes in the inner sect might also have restrictions. Although these restrictions might not extend very deep underground, he still needed to be careful not to trigger them.

Chu Ning’s only concern now was whether He Litao, who was outside, would notice if he used an Earth Escape Talisman to leave Xin Wuyai’s cave abode. But at this moment, Chu Ning couldn’t worry about it; he could only try. After all, he still had the Divine Concealment Art, and He Litao was only a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, so he shouldn't be able to sense Chu Ning's presence.

After thinking carefully and confirming that he hadn't missed anything, Chu Ning prepared to execute his plan. The next moment, he immediately put Little White back into his spirit beast pouch. Then, he sat down again, looking bored. Just as he finished doing all this, He Litao’s figure appeared outside the stone room. After glancing at Chu Ning, He Litao turned and left.

A little while later, realizing that He Litao should have gone far, Chu Ning no longer hesitated. He quickly activated the Divine Concealment Art. At the same time, spiritual power surged in his hand, directly activating an Earth Escape Talisman. Instantly, a hazy yellow light shield enveloped Chu Ning, and the next moment, he plunged downwards beneath the stone room, taking Little White with him.

He descended about two zhang.

“Reached!” Little White’s divine sense transmission sounded in Chu Ning’s mind. He immediately dispersed the Earth Escape Talisman’s shield, and a white light immediately shone from Little White’s head, enveloping Chu Ning. The next moment, Little White, along with the white light, plunged fiercely into the ground.

“Passed through the restriction?” As the white light dispersed, Chu Ning felt himself free underground. He immediately activated another Earth Escape Talisman. Then, following the direction he had memorized on the surface, he began to escape. Chu Ning still chose the eastern direction because the Yin Demon Sect members came from the northwest, and the inner sect’s training grounds were also to the west. Therefore, the eastern side should logically be uninhabited at this moment.

“The inner sect has so many cave abode restrictions!” As his body traversed underground, Chu Ning couldn't help but secretly grumble to himself. Not only were there many cave abodes for the sect’s cultivators in the inner sect, but each one also had formation restrictions. Some, like Xin Wuyai’s, whose restrictions didn’t extend too deep, were fine. But for others, the formation restrictions extended to unknown depths. Chu Ning could only detour to avoid them.

However, Chu Ning also vaguely understood that people like Xin Wuyai probably didn’t need to plant spiritual plants or herbs. Those with deeper-extending formation restrictions, on the other hand, likely planted things and set the bottom of the restrictions deeper to avoid affecting the spiritual plants or their root systems from triggering the restrictions. This, however, caused Chu Ning significant trouble with his Earth Escape. After constantly avoiding obstacles, his direction had long deviated from his initial plan. And at this moment, he couldn’t go to the surface to check his direction either; he could only continuously use the Earth Escape Art in a general direction.

Vaguely, Chu Ning could also feel the ground trembling. If nothing else, that should be due to the battle between the two sects. This made Chu Ning even more anxious. Earth Escape Talismans were, after all, only low-grade mid-tier talismans. Each escape wouldn’t cover a great distance, and the speed wasn’t fast. The short distance wasn't a problem since Chu Ning had plenty of Earth Escape Talismans, but the slow speed was truly unavoidable. Chu Ning didn’t know how many Earth Escape Talismans he had used or how far he had escaped, until Little White let out a “Ying” sound.

“More restrictions?” Chu Ning merely muttered, then quickly reacted, saying with a hint of joy, “Have we reached the edge of the protective grand formation?”

“Ying!” Little White chirped.

Seeing this, Chu Ning didn't rush out directly. Instead, he said to Little White, “Little White, you go out first and see if there are any cultivators. Remember to be careful, try not to poke your head out of the ground. If there’s anyone, come back quickly.”

“Ying!” Little White chirped and then darted forward. Vaguely, Chu Ning saw a fluctuation in the grand formation, but it quickly returned to normal. Chu Ning waited anxiously. After a short while, a white blur, Little White’s figure reappeared.

“No one in this direction, but you don’t know what direction it is?”

Hearing Little White’s words, Chu Ning’s eyes flickered slightly, then he gritted his teeth. “Little White, take me out!”

The depths of the Green Gorge Mountain Range might hold dangers, like demonic beasts. But he had only just left the sect’s range, so he shouldn't be too deep. And he did have some means to protect himself. However, if he stayed within the sect, these means would be useless.

“Ying!” Following Chu Ning’s command, Little White chirped softly. Then, as soon as Chu Ning dispelled the Earth Escape Talisman, a white light immediately emanated from its head, enveloping Chu Ning. The next moment, the man and beast vanished within the sect’s protective grand formation.
