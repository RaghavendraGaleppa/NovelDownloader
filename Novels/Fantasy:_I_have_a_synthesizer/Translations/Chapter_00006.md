# Chapter 6: The Li Clan Group, Liu Kuang's Shock

In Hengcheng, a towering building bore four large characters: Li Clan Group! The Li Clan Group was quite a prominent power in Hengcheng, controlling thirty percent of the city's pill business. This was why Li Hu could become a VIP at the Xingcheng Grand Pharmacy.

Currently, in the highest room of the Li Clan Group, a middle-aged man watched Li Hu and Li Long with a grim expression. The middle-aged man's thin fingers lightly tapped the table. "Are you saying you provoked a student who is possibly a martial artist?"

Li Long trembled as he replied, "Father, I didn't know he was a martial artist at the time! He's a classmate of Second Brother's, and although we're all third-year students, I've never heard of such a person in school." The middle-aged man before them was indeed their father, Li Tianhe. "Father, you must save us! I don't want to be imprisoned in the Martial Artist Prison for the rest of my life!"

The Martial Artist Prison was specifically established by the Martial Artist Association for martial artists who defied discipline. Those who entered were invariably individuals who had committed heinous crimes. If Su Yu truly was a martial artist, then with a single word to the Martial Artist Association, even if Li Long was merely a quasi-martial artist, he would be thrown into the Martial Artist Prison, never to be released! The humiliation of a martial artist was an iron rule throughout Great Xia that no one could defy!

"What are you looking at? Do you think I'd be willing to take such a huge risk to assassinate a martial artist if it weren't for you two?!" Li Tianhe roared. "Even if the Martial Artist Association learns you provoked Su Yu, a dead martial artist, combined with our Li family's influence in Hengcheng, they will simply turn a blind eye." Having said that, Li Tianhe calmly looked at the figure beside him. The person nodded and vanished from the office.

Meanwhile, at the training ground, a digital screen appeared on a massive machine. The numbers continuously rose with time. Liu Kuang appeared beside Wu Ming, hands clasped behind his back, and said faintly, "The vital energy test is simple; anyone who dares to participate can do it. I just wonder what kind of results the subsequent strength and speed tests will yield."

Wu Ming smiled and said, "As long as he can become a martial artist, at his age, he will naturally enter that place!" Liu Kuang took a deep look at Wu Ming, then chuckled. "Indeed." With that, both men looked at the screen. Soon, the value on the screen quickly jumped, signifying success!

One thousand eight hundred and ninety-three kilograms! The appearance of this number made Liu Kuang's and Wu Ming's pupils contract sharply. "One thousand eight hundred kilograms!" The two exchanged glances, both seeing the shock in the other's eyes. What did it mean for someone who had just entered the martial artist realm to unleash a strength of one thousand eight hundred kilograms?

Liu Kuang took a deep breath, looking enviously at Wu Ming. "Your First High School truly found a treasure! It seems that place is genuinely about to have someone from Hengcheng enter." Wu Ming's face was beaming with joy at this moment.

Su Yu looked at his own strength, lost in thought. "Is it because of those pills?" Su Yu knew very well that his talent wasn't the strongest, but he had his 'golden finger'. The pills synthesized by his synthesis panel were indeed top-grade items; they not only enhanced vital energy but also subtly improved his strength! For a moment, Su Yu even looked forward to the Bone Tempering Pill he would take that evening.

Soon, Su Yu arrived at the third machine for the speed test. Liu Kuang said,
