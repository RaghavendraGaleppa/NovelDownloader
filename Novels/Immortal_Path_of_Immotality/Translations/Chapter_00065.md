# Chapter 65: Poor Devil Lin Shan

After hearing the price quoted by the Hundred Treasures Pavilion manager—60 spirit stones for a jar of wind-attributed spirit dates—Lin Shan's smiling face instantly froze. The total amount of spirit stones he could currently use was only 110 at most. This purchase would wipe out more than half of his savings!

He began calculating in his mind. Back in the mortal world, the wandering cultivator Guangnan Sanren, whose spiritual root aptitude was similar to his own, had taken ten years to progress from the fourth to the sixth level of Qi Refinement. 

For him to advance from the early sixth level to the peak sixth level, it would take about four years of cultivation in the outside world. However, renting a cave dwelling in the city, where the spiritual energy concentration was 15 times that of the outside world, would allow him to reach the peak in just three months!

Renting a cave dwelling for three months cost only 30 spirit stones, while this jar of wind dates cost 60? 

Unaffordable. Absolutely unaffordable.

Lin Shan thought that three months was bearable. For the same effect, he'd rather save where he could. Spirit fruits and spirit wines were probably delicacies for wealthy cultivators, not something poor wandering cultivators like him could afford. 

Most wandering cultivators would diligently save their money to rent cave dwellings or buy elixirs—wasn't that more practical?

What Lin Shan needed was a spirit fruit that, after being enhanced by his reinforcement panel, could help him break through his bottleneck. These wind dates were too small individually, containing only a limited amount of wind-attributed spiritual energy. Even if he spent 8 points of ancient charm to reinforce them, they likely wouldn't be enough to break through his mid-stage Qi Refinement bottleneck.

He asked the manager if there were any other wind-attributed spirit fruits available. The manager said they were currently out of stock and suggested he come back another time.

After leaving the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, Lin Shan browsed other shops, each with its own unique style and specialties. The dazzling variety of items made his head spin, and he couldn't help but wish he could take them all for himself!

The only downside was that everything was too expensive.

Lin Shan finally understood why even someone like Princess Guo, who had the backing of the mortal world's Huaian Prince's estate, didn't own a decent mid-grade magical artifact.

An ordinary mid-grade magical artifact cost at least 200 spirit stones, not to mention defensive artifacts or concealment artifacts—such life-saving tools started at 300 spirit stones and went up from there! Some niche artifacts like banners, flags, scrolls, or fans were even more expensive.

Lin Shan even found a sword artifact with three inscriptions, similar in function to his own Cold Iron Sword, but its price soared to nearly 500 spirit stones—almost the upper limit for mid-grade artifacts.

High-grade artifacts were generally used by Foundation Establishment cultivators, with prices starting at 2,000 spirit stones. The better ones could cost anywhere from 5,000 to nearly 10,000 spirit stones—far beyond what he could even dream of at his current level.

Moreover, high-grade artifacts consumed a tremendous amount of spiritual energy. Even if he could afford one, his Qi Refinement stage spiritual energy reserves wouldn't allow him to use it more than a few times. Mid-grade artifacts were far more cost-effective for combat.

Lin Shan then visited the Treasure Medicine Pavilion to look at elixirs. A bottle of Qi Refinement stage cultivation-enhancing elixirs cost around 60 spirit stones, offering much better effects than the jar of wind dates—though the taste and texture were far inferior.

A single breakthrough elixir for the early Qi Refinement bottleneck cost 100 spirit stones, while one for the mid-stage cost 500 spirit stones. As for elixirs to break through to Foundation Establishment?

"Sorry, we don't sell those here. If you're interested, you might want to check out a major auction someday."

Lin Shan pondered. While the mid-stage breakthrough elixir was beyond his reach, he wondered if reinforcing an early-stage breakthrough elixir with his panel might also help with his mid-stage bottleneck.

He could afford the 100-spirit-stone early-stage elixir, but he only had 3 points of ancient charm left—not enough to reinforce it. To gather more ancient charm, he'd have to wait until he returned to the Nightingale headquarters in the capital six months later for a proper harvest.

But if he hadn't broken through to the late Qi Refinement stage by then and encountered Princess Guo and the brocade-robed middle-aged man on his way back, he'd be hopelessly outnumbered.

"Forget it for now. I'll set aside 30 spirit stones to rent a cave dwelling and cultivate to the peak of the sixth level first!"

"The remaining spirit stones can be used to buy things to improve my combat strength. I especially need countermeasures against Princess Guo's Soul-Startling Bell and the brocade-robed man's talisman sword."

Lin Shan visited other shops but found that most items were either not what he urgently needed or simply beyond his means.

For example, there was a puppet workshop specializing in puppets. A single early Qi Refinement stage puppet cost 100 spirit stones! On top of that, operating it required installing spirit stones as an energy source, purchasing specialized control techniques, and regular maintenance.

Then there was the Array Pavilion, which offered a full-service package for selling, setting up, and repairing formations. Even the most basic Mist Array and Spirit Gathering Array started at 500 spirit stones.

At the Spirit Beast Corral, the cheapest early Qi Refinement stage Spirit Devouring Ant Rat cost 50 spirit stones, while better ones ranged from 200 to 300. Mid-stage spirit beasts had even higher rearing costs and longer growth cycles, with selling prices starting at 500 spirit stones!

After touring the market, Lin Shan realized he was truly a poor devil—the only things he could afford were spirit insects and talismans.

For example, the Mistlight Moths and flying ants used by the green-robed elder could be bought for 20 spirit stones per hundred. With proper rearing, their numbers might even multiply.

But Lin Shan had fought these before—the green-robed elder's swarm had been wiped out with just two swings of his sword. What was the point of painstakingly raising such weak creatures?

Of course, there were rarer and more powerful spirit insects, but those were mostly controlled by major sects like the Beast Taming Valley. The market rarely offered anything truly formidable.

Left with no choice, Lin Shan turned to talismans. At the Talisman Tower, he carefully picked out a mid-grade defensive talisman—the Water Curtain Talisman—for 20 spirit stones. He felt his offense was sufficient but his defense lacking.

If ambushed and unable to summon his mid-grade Cold Iron Sword in time, he could be caught off guard. In cultivator battles, initiative was crucial—a single misstep could lead to total defeat, as Princess Guo had nearly demonstrated by almost controlling him to death.

After some deliberation, he spent another 20 spirit stones on a mid-grade Concealment Talisman to mask his aura. As for higher-grade talismans that offered both invisibility and aura concealment, their prices were beyond his wildest dreams.

Survival came first!

Since arriving in Yichuan, Lin Shan had noticed that late Qi Refinement cultivators were common on the streets, giving him an inexplicable sense of crisis.

Even if he reached the late Qi Refinement stage, relying solely on a single mid-grade artifact wouldn't be enough. His arsenal was too limited—he needed more trump cards.

The Talisman Tower offered a vast array of other talismans: Earth Escape, Wood Escape, Soul Snatching, Thunder Calling, Body Binding, Heavenly Eye, Blazing Flame, Revitalizing Spring, Ice Seal, Beast Soul, Flight, Whirlwind...

Lin Shan's mouth watered at the sight, but these were all high-grade talismans that only Foundation Establishment cultivators could produce. The cheapest cost several hundred spirit stones each. For Qi Refinement cultivators, each was a potential game-changer in battle.

Utterly out of his league.

He even spotted talisman swords—flying swords usable by Qi Refinement cultivators! A low-grade talisman sword cost 200 spirit stones, while mid-grade ones started at 500.

"High-grade talisman sword?" The shop assistant looked at him strangely. "High-grade artifacts are generally used by Foundation Establishment cultivators, who can already wield flying swords on their own. Why would they need talisman swords?"

As for whether disciples of major sects carried high-grade talisman swords crafted by their elders, the assistant said he didn't know—but their shop certainly didn't have any.

After a full day of browsing, Lin Shan felt he had not only broadened his horizons but also gained a basic understanding of Yichuan's market conditions.

He didn't need low-grade artifacts, so he only spent 40 spirit stones on two mid-grade talismans. The remaining spirit stones had to be carefully allocated to maximize their utility over the next six months.

In six months, he would return to the capital. By then, the Nightingale tokens from various branches should have been collected, and he could deliver the Vermilion Fruit to the Grand Elder.

"I can't just sit idle and exhaust my funds. I need to find a way to make money! Without the 100 spirit stones 'donated' by the green-robed elder and the hook-nosed man, I wouldn't even have been able to afford these talismans today. Is robbery truly the fastest way to get rich in the cultivation world?"

Lin Shan fell into deep contemplation, his face clouded with worry.
