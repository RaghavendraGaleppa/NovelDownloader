Chapter 210: Getting Out

"I merely came at the summons of my disciple. If you wish to thank someone, thank my disciple instead," Zhou Tian said nonchalantly.

"May I ask, what great figure from the Nine Provinces might you be, Daoist friend? I would like to pay you a visit another day." The Beyond Realm Great Being, originally composed of human skin, now appeared more like a complete person after refining the Funeral Tome, no longer just a collection of hides. It seemed he had gained much from the Funeral Tome.

"Just a nobody, that's all. If you ever go to the Nine Provinces, please don't mention my name. My disciple's name would be far more effective than mine," Zhou Tian said, half-truthfully, half-jokingly. Such old monsters were not easily deceived; making them believe wasn't simple.

"Daoist friend, why are you bringing me into this? You still haven't answered my question," Zhou Tian said indifferently, looking at the Beyond Realm Great Being.

"Just like you, Daoist friend, I am merely a nobody. What name could I possibly have?" The Beyond Realm Great Being also played evasive, unwilling to reveal too much.

"Haha, what a coincidence then! Two nobodies meeting each other," Zhou Tian laughed heartily. Behind him, the Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death radiated light, streams of Yin and Yang qi swirling and converging in his palm. Two cups, imbued with the colors of chaos, materialized, with the qi of life and death flowing within them. Forming shapes from the void, creating existence from nothingness—the divine abilities of a Heavenly Venerate were evident.

"Please, Daoist friend, taste this cycle of life and death," Zhou Tian said, pointing with a finger. One of the cups slowly floated over. Although it was only fist-sized, it felt as though it held an entire world, immensely weighty. The Beyond Realm Great Being reached out and took the cup, a smile on his face, showing no surprise.

"Please." Zhou Tian raised his cup in invitation, and the Beyond Realm Great Being also raised his.

"To encounter a figure like you, Daoist friend, truly makes this trip worthwhile."

As the qi of life and death entered him, the Beyond Realm Great Being closed his eyes. His body radiated a faint glow, and a decaying aura spread out, permeated by death qi. The surrounding earth cracked and was corroded.

"You're courting death!" Huang Qi's expression changed drastically. He bellowed at Zhou Tian, believing Zhou Tian had secretly set up a trap to harm his master, and was about to attack.

Zhou Tian narrowed his eyes, saying nothing. He lightly tapped a finger, and ripples appeared in the void, as if about to shatter. Huang Qi instantly felt as if struck by lightning, flying backward a great distance. Blood spilled from his mouth, and he could barely stand, his entire body trembling. Only then did Zhou Tian speak: "Watch closely!"

Not much time passed. When the death qi reached its peak, a wisp of life qi began to brew deep within the Beyond Realm Great Being's body. Though it was only a trace, it erupted with powerful vitality, instantly obliterating all the death qi. Nearby, trees began to sprout. These were withered branches, buried for countless years, now resurrected. The area instantly transformed into a lush, verdant landscape.

The Beyond Realm Great Being opened his eyes, and all the life qi vanished once more. "The cycle of life and death, turning death into life. What a skillful technique, Daoist friend."

"Just a small trick, nothing worth mentioning," Zhou Tian waved his hand, admitting that he had merely leveraged the Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death.

"Huang Qi, quickly apologize to Daoist friend," the Beyond Realm Great Being instructed Huang Qi. The dignity of a Heavenly Venerate was not to be offended. In his view, Zhou Tian not killing Huang Qi was already giving him face. Huang Qi dragged his injured body forward, his expression showing no resentment or unwillingness, ready to apologize. To offend a Heavenly Venerate and only suffer these minor injuries was already good fortune.

"There's no need for that. He was merely flustered by concern. An apology is unnecessary," Zhou Tian declined, then his expression subtly changed. "Daoist friend," he said, "time is up. I can no longer possess my disciple's body. I currently have only these two disciples, and I am quite fond of them. I hope Daoist friend will look after them well. If anything were to happen to them, I would be very saddened."

"Naturally. This time, it was entirely due to your disciples' righteous action. My Beyond Realm will not mistreat them," the Beyond Realm Great Being nodded.

"Mm." Zhou Tian nodded, then the aura around his body deflated like a balloon, returning him to the Dharma Idol Realm. He looked around in confusion, finally turning to Saint Demon.

"Master left?"

"Yes," Saint Demon nodded.

"Phew, that's good. Every time he descends, it makes me feel so awkward." Zhou Tian sighed, twisted his body, then looked at the Beyond Realm Great Being. "Senior, since you've also refined this Funeral Tome, when can we leave?"

Faint runes appeared in the Beyond Realm Great Being's eyes as he casually glanced at Zhou Tian, then looked up at the blood-colored figure in the sky. "Just a little while longer."

The blood-colored figure continuously emitted blood mist, roaring and glaring malevolently in their direction, yet it was helpless. Even with its formidable current strength, it could only allow itself to dissipate. A moment later, with the dispersion of the last wisp of blood mist, the humanoid blood-colored figure completely vanished into the void.

The Beyond Realm Great Being frowned slightly, appearing somewhat puzzled, but then seemed to recall something. He gently opened the first page of the Funeral Tome in his hand, and a cold gust of wind swept through.

The entire ancient city began to echo with roars, and wisps of blood-colored mist drifted upwards. The human skins throughout the city began to dissipate. With each dissolving human skin, a skeleton warrior turned to dust. An invisible substance seemed to rise and then vanish—these were the souls trapped within the skeletons. They were not scattered into oblivion, but rather found complete peace. Before long, all the human skins and skeleton warriors in the ancient city had completely dissolved.

*Buzz!*

A humming sound resonated between heaven and earth. Above the ancient city, light converged, forming a gate of light, etched with faint patterns.

"Alright, you can leave now," the Beyond Realm Great Being said with a smile to the group. The others ascended into the air, heading towards the gate of light.

The Beyond Realm Great Being stopped at the entrance, turning back to glance at the space around them. Without the suppression of the colossal Buddha phantom, and with several Heavenly Venerate-level experts fighting consecutively here, this world had already begun to shatter. It wouldn't be long before it completely collapsed.

"Wutian... what a pity..." The Beyond Realm Great Being sighed softly. Even though he knew that if Wutian had succeeded, he himself would have been annihilated, he still felt regret for Wutian. It was a lament for a fellow practitioner, devoid of any personal interest. Then, he turned and stepped into the gate of light, with Huang Qi following closely behind.

Zhou Tian and Saint Demon exchanged glances, surveying the vast expanse of land, both somewhat silent. They had gained immense opportunities here. Saint Demon had cleared the obstacles on his path, ensuring a smooth journey ahead, and had also received Wutian's true legacy. Zhou Tian had completed his system's first upgrade, undergone a complete transformation, and even acquired a Heavenly Venerate artifact. Overall, the opportunities they obtained were in no way inferior to those from the Funeral Tome; perhaps they even slightly surpassed them. They had also witnessed many things, all of which left them feeling a sense of profound emotion. The gate of light began to grow ethereal. Zhou Tian and Saint Demon no longer delayed, turning and stepping into the gate of light.
