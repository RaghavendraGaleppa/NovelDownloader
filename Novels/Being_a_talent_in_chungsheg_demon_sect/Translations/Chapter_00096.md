### Chapter 96: Release Day Thoughts (Must Read!)

It's been two months since I started publishing this book, and I've painstakingly written 280,000 characters. Tonight, at midnight, the book will go premium. The two chapters released this afternoon are the final free chapters; as they're transitional, I won't include them in the paid chapters that go live tonight.

To be honest, since I started writing, I've faced many difficult moments.

Especially since the book was released before the New Year, leading to poor traffic in the middle of the year. After the New Year, it almost missed out on smart recommendations, and recommendations were even suspended at one point, nearly causing me to drop the novel. I barely managed to win a "resurrection match," only to lose a PK on Sanjiang, which delayed things by another week.

My ability to persevere is purely due to everyone's support. When this book reached 100,000 characters, it only had just over a thousand collections. If not for the excellent read-through rate and frequent reader comments, I might have given up.

Regarding everyone's comments, I actually read all of them, whether they praise the book or criticize it.

Aside from some initial, rather abstract issues, many people are actually more concerned about the power levels, thinking that with such high settings, the power system could easily collapse.

On this front, I'm treating minor cultivation realms as major ones. Initial, Middle, Late, and Perfect stages within each minor realm will have significant power gaps, and there's a lot of room for deeper exploration and upgrades. I believe I can manage this well, especially after reaching the Foundation Establishment realm.

The cultivation style of the Sacred Sect, and indeed the entire world view, will truly manifest only upon reaching Foundation Establishment.

I won't say much more, let's get to the point:

For the premium release, there will be at least ten chapters, possibly more. So, I sincerely ask for your monthly votes; I hope to contend for a spot on the new book monthly vote chart.

Additionally, if the initial subscriptions reach the "premium" benchmark, all daily updates for the following month will double, to at least four chapters and eight thousand characters.
