# Chapter 92: Anticipating, For Something to Happen in Life

After resting for a while at the inn and waiting for his resurrection count to refresh, Zhou Tian set off once more.

Emerging from the inn, Zhou Tian changed into a fresh set of white robes. Celer City was filled with people dressed in white robes. He stopped a person on the street, praised the Lord twice, and then inquired about the whereabouts of the Holy Sons and Holy Maidens who had arrived in the past two days.

Zhou Tian headed in that direction, planning to find Musu and ask about Zhang Yi's location. "Little brother Musu should be willing to tell me," Zhou Tian mused.

The destination was near the Central Cathedral.

"Merciful Lord, friend, you stepped on me."

"Great Lord, I apologize, friend. I apologize to you in the Lord's presence."

"Benevolent Lord, I accept your apology. Let us go pray together!"

"Holy Lord, very well."

Zhou Tian watched with a twitching mouth as two overly dramatic people walked hand-in-hand towards the Central Cathedral, utterly speechless.

The Central Cathedral was the largest place of worship in Celer City and its very core. It occupied vast grounds, with dozens of milky white stone pillars supporting the entire edifice. The roof was a golden, circular dome, engraved with complex runes and images. From just the part Zhou Tian could see, nearly ten Holy Envoys with six pairs of wings on their backs soared, alongside several white-robed Saints, showcasing its ancient might. In the center was a ball of light, too indistinct to make out anything specific.

This left Zhou Tian very disappointed. He had hoped to see the appearance of the so-called Lord, which would have made his artistic creations more complete and vibrant.

The Bishop of the Central Cathedral, who was also the Pontiff of the Divine Holy Sect, was the one who had received the Lord's Holy Edict during a prayer led by the former patriarch of the cathedral.

Zhou Tian wasn't particularly interested in what statue was enshrined inside. He didn't follow the crowd towards the Central Cathedral, instead turning at a crossroads.

After walking a short distance, Zhou Tian arrived outside a complex of buildings.

"A large courtyard with walls covered in carvings of Mandan Flowers."

Zhou Tian glanced at the carved patterns on the wall, then looked down at the embroidered flowers on his own white robes, nodding. "This must be it."

The Mandan Flower was the emblem of the Divine Holy Sect. It was said that when the Lord descended in ancient times, this flower bloomed for ten thousand li around, resembling a combination of a lotus and a mandrake flower.

Four guards stood before the gate, clad in white-gold armor, holding long spears. Their gazes were cold as they fixed on Zhou Tian approaching. One of them barked, "Sacred ground of the Sect! Unauthorized personnel are forbidden!"

The long spears faintly glowed, with white patterns subtly appearing.

Zhou Tian pondered for a moment, then spoke, "Merciful Lord, I have come to this place by your will. Is everything before me the revelation you have given me?"

The four guards' expressions stiffened, as if they'd just swallowed something foul. The Lord had not responded to anyone's prayers for countless years, and His Holiness the Pontiff had only just received a Holy Edict. And here this man claimed to have received the Lord's will? Was that appropriate?

Yet, they couldn't openly voice their suspicion. It would be easy for someone to escalate the issue: "Are you doubting a devout believer, or are you doubting the Almighty Lord?" The fanatics of the Tribunal certainly wouldn't go easy on their own people.

One of the guards frowned and asked, "What was the Lord's revelation to you?"

Zhou Tian's face took on a pious expression. "The Lord told me to come here and find a person named Musu."

*If you're looking for someone, just say so. Why all this unnecessary talk?* The four guards felt exasperated internally.

"Musu, is he a Holy Son or Holy Maiden?"

"No, he's the one accompanying a Holy Maiden."

"Do you know which Holy Maiden? It's difficult to find him with just his name."

Zhou Tian thought for a moment, then said, "I think her name is Holy Maiden Beina."

"Holy Maiden Beina? I see. Wait here."

One of the guards entered, apparently to inform someone.

*So it was this simple. Zhou Tian had expected it to be much stricter.*

Not long after, two figures emerged from the gate: the guard who had just gone in, and Musu.

Musu was also surprised to see him. When the guard said someone was looking for him, he had been a little confused, as he didn't know anyone in Celer City. He never expected it to be Zhou Tian, this schemer.

After bringing the person out, the four guards returned to their calm and composed watch.

Musu and Zhou Tian walked away side-by-side.

"The security here isn't that strict, is it?" Zhou Tian asked on the way.

Musu wasn't wearing his helmet today, his golden hair fanned out behind him, paired with his stern face, making him look rather handsome. Hearing Zhou Tian's words, he replied, "Strict? Why would it be strict? Everyone inside is a Holy Son or Holy Maiden, not some邪神邪神邪神邪神邪神evil god cultist."

Zhou Tian nodded in realization, then heard Musu say, "What do you want from me? Weren't you going back to your Hammer City?"

"I stayed to help you." Zhou Tian chuckled.

Musu's eyes instantly turned cold. "Don't play games with me!"

Zhou Tian merely smiled nonchalantly. "Don't be angry. Let's find a place and talk properly."

Musu frowned but said nothing more.

The two found a tavern. Celer City wasn't only home to members of the Divine Holy Sect; there were also members of other sects, mostly allies from ancient times who had stuck together for mutual support until now. Taverns still had their place.

Entering the tavern, they went up to the second floor and entered a private room.

As soon as they sat down, Musu spoke coldly, "What is it?"

Zhou Tian grinned slyly and said, "Didn't I tell you I had a major enemy among those who escaped the explosion that day? Actually, I lied to you. There wasn't just one enemy, but two."

"Do I look like an idiot to you?" Musu's face was indifferent, looking at him as if he were a fool.

"One of my enemies escaped, but another was captured. I have an irreconcilable hatred for him!" Zhou Tian ignored Musu and continued speaking regardless. "So, can you tell me where those captured people are being held now?"

Musu's eyes flashed. "What do you want to do?"

"Of course, I want to kill him with my own hands. If such deep hatred cannot be avenged with my own hands, then what meaning is there in living?" Zhou Tian declared, filled with righteous indignation, clenching his fists.

Musu wore an expression that clearly said, "Believe you and I'd be a fool," and replied, "Why should I help you?"

Zhou Tian gave a sly smile and slowly said, "Why has your Lord not responded to your prayers for so many years, and why did he suddenly bestow a divine edict? What fate awaits those chosen as Holy Sons or Holy Maidens to be vessels for the Holy Envoys?"

"And what do you think faith should truly be like? To sacrifice everything for a ball of light? That's called brainwashing!"

"Don't you anticipate that something might happen in life?"

Zhou Tian patted Musu's shoulder, his words practically half-revealed.

Musu was slightly lost in thought. Ever since he was a child, everyone around him had been a devout believer of the Divine Holy Sect. No one had ever told him these things, only that he should believe in the Lord.

But for some reason, a stir rippled in his heart. Perhaps he truly did anticipate that something might happen in life.
