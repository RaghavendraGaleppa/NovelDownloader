**Chapter 104: First Hearing of the Dao-Seizing War**

"Gather!"

Inside the cave dwelling, as the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord uttered a Dao sound and his magic power surged, "Chen Xin'an's" nearly dispersed soul finally regained stability.

"I'm still alive? Father?"

Seeing Chen Xin'an gradually awaken, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord had a gentle expression, smiling faintly, "I knew my son wasn't some mediocre person."

It was clear that while helping Chen Xin'an reassemble his soul, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord had already calculated the karma. After Liu Xin lost the protection of the divine talisman, the past events naturally couldn't be concealed. However, the banner spirit Chen Xin'an had borrowed the original body's karma and carried the divine talisman, perfectly obscuring the heavenly secrets. After all this, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord didn't detect anything amiss. In his calculations, the whole story was that Chen Xin'an had been ambushed by the Innate Daoist, becoming a banner spirit controlled by Liu Xin, but then used his wisdom to kill Liu Xin in retaliation.

"No matter what, it's good that you're alright." The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord sighed, and although the banner spirit Chen Xin'an outwardly displayed a touched expression, his heart remained completely unruffled.

‘Sorry, Father.’

‘I already belong to Master.’

The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord held Chen Xin'an's soul, taking a step back to the peak of Heaven-Mending Peak. Then he molded earth into a human form, carefully placing the soul inside.

"Don't worry, this is only temporary. This time, you were schemed against by that Innate Daoist, which led to this incident. With your father here, you'll only need a dozen years of recuperation to restore your peak cultivation. I can also remold your physical body for you. Given time, you'll still have the chance to attempt the Foundation Establishment realm!" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord spoke patiently. Clearly, he took Chen Xin'an's silence as despondency after a setback, which was why he proactively offered comfort. At first glance, his fatherly love was evident.

Chen Xin'an casually agreed, but in his heart, he was thinking of Lu Yang's mission. "Father, with my current state, can I really still attempt Foundation Establishment?" Chen Xin'an looked up, a perfectly fitting touch of dejection on his face.

"Of course you can!" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord smiled faintly upon hearing this, "I have a wondrous Foundation Establishment treasure in my possession, called Creation Jade Mud. I plan to use it to remold your physical body. With this, you'll have a ten percent chance of reaching innate Foundation Establishment. Next, as long as you cultivate the 'Cut Thought See Me Heavenly Silkworm Secret' and combine it with the third-grade true qi from the Heaven-Mending True Scripture, you'll have a thirty percent chance of successfully establishing your Foundation."

*These are all just ordinary methods.* Chen Xin'an, having been repeatedly refined by Lu Yang, was now utterly loyal to him. At this moment, he only thought about whether he could help his master uncover valuable resources within the Holy Sect.

"Thirty percent... isn't that too little?" Chen Xin'an sighed, "Father, I don't want to try my luck with just a thirty percent chance. If possible, I'd like to have a greater chance of success before attempting Foundation Establishment."

"Oh?" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord was momentarily stunned upon hearing this, then showed a look of gratification, nodding, "Good, how could your father blame you for having such a thought? As for other ways to increase your chances of success, it's not like there aren't any. I recall a True Monarch recently emerged from seclusion and issued an order to reignite the Righteous-Demonic War."

"Righteous-Demonic War?" Chen Xin'an was startled, and Lu Yang's divine sense within his body also overheard this conversation, sparking curiosity. *Was the Righteous-Demonic War related to breaking through to Foundation Establishment?*

Seeing Chen Xin'an's puzzled expression, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord immediately smiled: "It's quite normal that you don't know about this, after all, you grew up in the Cloud Sea of Heaven's Connection and are my offspring, so you wouldn't have access to such matters. Why do you think we fight so fiercely with Jiangnan?"

Hearing this, Chen Xin'an subconsciously said, "Because Righteous and Demonic cannot coexist—"

"That's nonsense!" The Heaven-Mending Peak Lord shook his head, "Both Jiangnan and Jiangbei follow the 'Body Refining Ascension Path,' it's just their styles that differ. Righteous and Demonic are merely titles. Would you fight to the death for a mere title?" At this point, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord pointed upwards, "The so-called Righteous-Demonic War is essentially a struggle between the True Monarchs, vying for various Daoist lineages! If our Holy Sect wins and advances an inch into Jiangnan, the True Monarchs' Dao Fruits can extend into Jiangnan, and their cultivation will strengthen a bit. If Sword Pavilion wins and pushes into Jiangbei, the True Monarchs' Dao Fruits will consequently weaken. Rather than a Righteous-Demonic War, it's more accurately a Dao-Seizing War! For this reason, most of the Holy Sect's True Persons are stationed throughout Jiangnan. Including Qi Refining realm disciples. The Cloud Sea of Heaven's Connection is just a place to cultivate new disciples. The battlefield of the Dao-Seizing War is the true gu-raising ground! Most of our Holy Sect's True Persons have also emerged from there. Because the influence of Dao Fruits brought about by the outcome of the Dao-Seizing War is not only useful to True Monarchs but also greatly beneficial to us lower cultivators who shelter under True Monarchs. Among these benefits are opportunities that help increase one's chances of Foundation Establishment. For example, that junior from Yin Mountain, he only broke through after overpowering other cultivators in the Dao-Seizing War a dozen years ago, helping a True Monarch seize the 'Myriad Pit of Jiangnan'."

However, as he spoke, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord shook his head again, "Even so, the battlefield is still too dangerous, almost certain death. With your father here, you don't really need to specifically go there to take risks. At worst, your father can find another way to ask the True Monarchs for a Foundation Establishment Pill for you—" At this point, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord patted Chen Xin'an's shoulder again. "In summary, what you need to do now is rest well, recover as quickly as possible. Your father awaits the day you establish your Foundation and inherit my mantle."

As his words fell, the Heaven-Mending Peak Lord smiled faintly. His smile was gentle and kind, like an old farmer full of expectation, waiting for the day his seeds would sprout, bloom... and finally bear fruit.

***

Heaven-Mending Peak, inside a cave dwelling.

Lu Yang reviewed the intelligence he had just intercepted through Chen Xin'an, a thoughtful expression on his face: "Righteous-Demonic Dao-Seizing War, lineage struggle, opportunity for Foundation Establishment..."

This news, indeed, resolved a long-standing doubt he had. He had always felt that the Holy Sect had too few disciples. Take Heaven-Mending Peak, for example. Most were disciples in the early and middle stages of Qi Refining. Late-stage Qi Refining cultivators were already rare, and perfected Qi Refining cultivators were virtually unheard of. This was clearly unreasonable. After all, the breakthrough rate for Foundation Establishment was so low; it would undoubtedly require a vast number of perfected Qi Refining cultivators to cultivate enough Foundation Establishment True Persons. So, theoretically, cultivators in the late and perfected stages of Qi Refining shouldn't be uncommon, even if they weren't everywhere. Yet, in reality, this was not the case. Now it seemed it wasn't that the Holy Sect lacked these many disciples, but rather that these disciples weren't in the Cloud Sea of Heaven's Connection; they were on the front lines of the Righteous-Demonic War!

"So, the Cloud Sea of Heaven's Connection is actually the rear."

"Those perfected Qi Refining cultivators still here are basically like Luo Wuya and Chen Xin'an, who have True Persons as their backing and don't need to fight desperately on the battlefield."

The more Lu Yang thought, the brighter his eyes became.

"In the Righteous-Demonic War, True Monarchs will definitely personally oversee the battles. It's impossible for them to allow things like Foundation Establishment True Persons bullying smaller Qi Refining cultivators!"

"In other words, the Dragon Subduing Arhat wouldn't dare come—"

"If I can break through on the Righteous-Demonic battlefield, I reckon it's the safest!"

After all, compared to the Dragon Subduing Arhat, those Qi Refining cultivators on the Righteous-Demonic battlefield were simply not worth mentioning. *If I can't beat a Foundation Establishment cultivator, can I still not beat you all?*

"Better to be the head of a chicken than the tail of a phoenix!"

Looking back, what kind of monsters and demons had he faced? Grandmaster Tingyou, a Foundation Establishment reincarnation; Heaven-Mending Peak Lord, a half-crippled mid-stage Foundation Establishment; Dragon Subduing Arhat, a peak mid-stage Foundation Establishment... Each one more absurd than the last!

"I got inflated, I got inflated!"

Thinking of this, Lu Yang reflected deeply and painfully: "Actually, from the very beginning, I wasn't someone skilled in direct combat. My true forte has always been using a higher cultivation base to 'downwardly compatible,' allowing me to challenge those above my rank."

Lu Yang's gaze became resolute; he decided to follow his true inclinations.

"I'm going back to the novice village to show off!"
