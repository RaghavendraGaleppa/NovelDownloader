# Chapter 20: Immortal Duel  

"Remnants of the Black Lotus Sect, surrender and face your doom today!"  

A thunderous roar echoed from the center of the plaza, followed by a series of rolling thunderclaps. Tiny arcs of lightning spread across the square, crackling incessantly. The entire underground plaza was filled with flickering ghostly flames, flashes of lightning, and swirling dust, as if the apocalypse had descended.  

Occasional gusts of eerie wind howled, biting into Lin Shan's skin like knives.  

"Thunderbolt!"  

A shrill, piercing scream filled with venomous hatred rang out from the distance.  

...  

*Is this a battle between immortals?* Lin Shan, crouched in a corner, was both terrified and awestruck.  

Since transmigrating to this world, he had only heard tales of immortals and supernatural beings from storytellers. He had never witnessed such phenomena firsthand and had always been skeptical. Today's experience shattered his previous beliefs.  

*Do immortals truly exist in this world?!*  

*Then what was the point of all those years I spent training martial arts from dawn till dusk?*  

The staggering realization sent his emotions into turmoil.  

Before he could dwell further, the venomous voice in the plaza resounded again. This time, instead of being ear-piercing, it was more like a demonic whisper. The surrounding air grew thick, coalescing into eerie winds that swirled and surged toward the plaza's center.  

As the dust gradually cleared, Lin Shan caught a glimpse of a small, dark figure sitting cross-legged on a raised altar, surrounded by ghostly fire-lit stone pillars. Above the figure's head was a massive hole in the ceiling, from which bolts of lightning continuously struck down, targeting the person on the altar. Countless smaller lightning serpents branched out, spreading across the plaza.  

The eerie chanting seemed to emanate from the figure. Under the flickering lightning, Lin Shan could barely make out the shadowy figure holding a rod and rhythmically tapping something.  

*Tap!*  

*Tap!*  

*Tap!*  

The eerie winds gathered toward the center, and the demonic whispers gradually transformed into a resonant, yet increasingly grating, chant.  

Lin Shan clutched his head, feeling as though countless ants were gnawing at his brain. His vision darkened, and his consciousness wavered.  

...  

Finally, after what felt like an eternity—or perhaps just an instant—the thunder, chanting, and tapping all ceased.  

Silence.  

Lin Shan collapsed to the ground, utterly drained. After the torment he had just endured, all he wanted was to sleep.  

The battle in the plaza seemed to have concluded during his suffering. The air reeked of scorched earth, and debris littered the surroundings.  

---  

"A thousand years ago, the Black Lotus Sect slaughtered mortal nations to refine their Yin Corpses, becoming the sworn enemy of the cultivation world. The sects united to eradicate them, yet their remnants have persisted through generations—how tenacious!"  

A deep sigh echoed from the hole in the ceiling, though no figure could be seen.  

Lin Shan struggled to lift his head and survey the plaza. The surroundings were now slightly clearer. Though half the ghostly flames on the stone pillars had been extinguished, some still burned stubbornly.  

"Cough... For centuries, my sect has hidden, avoiding the world. Now, we've even taken refuge in these desolate mountains. We've committed no further atrocities—I merely used corpses to refine puppets. Yet you still hunt us down!"  

The hunched, black-robed elder on the altar coughed up blood, alternating between mad laughter and curses directed at the hole above.  

After a while, as if exhausted, a young Daoist priest descended from the hole. He wore a blue robe, his hair tied in a Daoist knot, and held a horsetail whisk. His expression was serene, untouched by worldly concerns.  

This was undoubtedly the "Thunderbolt" the black-robed elder had cursed earlier.  

Lin Shan remained frozen, not daring to move. During the battle, he had been powerless. Now that the storm had passed, he feared drawing the attention of these two immortals.  

His heart raced as he observed the Daoist priest. The man perfectly matched his childhood fantasies of an immortal—a true orthodox cultivator!  

Unlike Lin Shan, who had sneaked in through a tunnel, this Daoist had blasted a hole through the mountain and descended from the heavens!  

His mastery of thunder techniques had left Lin Shan spellbound.  

"For centuries, the Black Lotus Sect has spread cursed idols across nearby provinces, harvesting mortal faith and fortune to rebuild their divine vessel. The cultivation world of the Great Song Dynasty is well aware. I act under orders."  

The Daoist spoke dispassionately, as if discussing a trivial matter.  

"Damn it! If not for those grave robbers stumbling upon my retreat and leaking my location, how would you have found me in these wild mountains? Fate... fate!"  

The black-robed elder wailed in despair.  

...  

Lin Shan's mind reeled at the revelations.  

*Cursed idols? Fortune? Faith? Divine vessels? How do these relate to ancient essence?*  

He recalled the artifacts he had encountered—*Spring River Ducks Painting*, some Black Lotus Buddha statues, and the Nightingale Token*—all of which contained ancient essence. These objects seemed intrinsically linked to human fortune and religious worship.  

A vague realization began to form in his mind.  

...  

As the eerie flames flickered in the dim plaza, the argument between the two figures on the altar finally concluded.  

"Enough. Right or wrong, I will take you back to my sect. The elders will decide your fate."  

After subduing the black-robed elder, Thunderbolt ignored his curses. Muttering an incantation, he summoned a thundercloud, lifted the powerless elder, and soared toward the hole above.  

From start to finish, he never glanced in Lin Shan's direction—perhaps already aware of his presence but dismissing him as insignificant.  

Panicked at the thought of losing his chance, Lin Shan scrambled forward despite his pain, shouting,  

"Immortal, please wait! I seek no treasures—only to serve at your side!"  

"Immortal...?"  

...  

Standing beneath the hole, Lin Shan stared blankly at the cold moonlight streaming down. A profound sense of loss overwhelmed him. Witnessing the might of an immortal's power left him yearning and powerless.  

Missing this opportunity might mean never encountering an immortal again in his lifetime.  

Just then, something fell from above. A faint voice drifted down with the moonlight:  

"You've been tainted by Yin energy. If not purified within three days, it will take root and sicken you. Take this Warm Sun Jade Pendant."  

The voice echoed through the cavern, its owner already gone.  

Lin Shan caught the pendant with both hands. It was a translucent yellow jade, radiating warmth that instantly spread through his body, soothing him like a hot spring.  

A translucent panel appeared before his eyes:  

**[Sunfire Jade]**  
Quality: Tier 1 Spiritual Material  
Description: A common material for crafting low-grade magical artifacts, often found in volcanic regions.  
Enhancement Cost: 8 points  

...  

"This is..."  

Lin Shan marveled at the pendant's miraculous effects—not only did it dispel the cold, but it was also a material for artifact forging.  

*Can materials be enhanced too?*  

Turning the pendant over in his hands, he bowed deeply toward the hole. "Thank you, Immortal!"  

Even if the Daoist was already gone, his gratitude was genuine. Though he hadn't managed to attach himself to Thunderbolt, the gift of the jade had resolved a hidden danger. Lin Shan silently admired the righteousness of orthodox cultivators.  

---  

Revitalized, Lin Shan remembered his original purpose.  

*To seek ancient essence.*
