# Chapter 243: A Major Event (Two Chapters in One)

People were stunned, wondering who this was.

He had white hair, wore coarse linen robes, and with one hand, he reached into the bloody sun, injuring Pu Heng right from the start!

Pu Heng's status was too high; he was known as "Little Cao Qianqiu." He imitated his master in every aspect, and objectively speaking, his cultivation was indeed terrifyingly high. He moved about with his Pure Yang Consciousness, and currently, many people's bodies were uncontrollably trembling.

However, such a figure, standing just below the Ancestor-level, now suffered a huge loss.

His head was splitting open!

Everyone was petrified, unable to believe the scene they witnessed.

Qin Ming's heart surged; Senior Brother Lu had indeed arrived. That day, Lu Zizai had only said a simple sentence: "Fight for the auspicious beast's blood, and I will ensure your fairness!"

Now, he had come to fulfill his promise.

He was calm, confident, and powerful, suppressing Pu Heng with a single hand.

Pu Heng's gaze seemed to come from hell, making people extremely uncomfortable to look at, filled with thick malice, icy and bone-chilling. Outside his body, a great red sun boiled, runes flickered within his consciousness, transforming into sword after sword of light, trying to shred the large hand.

However, dense Heavenly Light energy bloomed on Lu Zizai's arm, even more brilliant than the scorching sun. The light swords that struck him, one after another, were all shattered and then ignited.

With a pop, Pu Heng's head shattered! Before everyone's eyes, Lu Zizai crushed his head. This was no less than a volcanic eruption or a hurricane passing through; the entire plateau trembled slightly.

"That... that's Cao Bubai's direct senior disciple!" Someone exclaimed in shock. More people turned pale, their bodies swaying, quickly retreating into the distance. The oppressive feeling at the storm's center was suffocating.

Swathes of crimson mist bloomed in the night sky; it was Pu Heng's consciousness reforming. This was the terrifying aspect of the Immortal Path: once consciousness reached the Pure Yang level, it gained a degree of immortality. Even if torn to pieces or exploding on the spot, it could still reappear.

"Lu Zizai!" Pu Heng's gigantic face materialized, crimson light illuminating the dark night sky, full of oppressive power, much like the "old world's" sunset glow, staining half the sky red. Apart from Ancestor-level figures, he was considered a front-rank person, yet he was "handled" like this, given a direct "head-pat kill."

There was no worse experience than this! Pu Heng could no longer recall when he had last experienced such humiliation.

In the high sky, his consciousness shot forth, instantly covering the heavens and earth. From afar, it looked like chunks of extraterrestrial meteorites burning, piercing the night sky, trailing long tails of light, slamming down towards the figure below. Many felt their blood run cold, realizing their own insignificance.

Now Pu Heng needed no words; he was Cao Qianqiu's senior disciple, and only by destroying his opponent could he wash away the humiliation he had suffered.

Lu Zizai stood on the ground, utterly serene, and made a gesture of drawing a sword from his back. There had been nothing there originally, but now intense Heavenly Light appeared, surging from his spine, followed by roars of dragons.

With a clang, a great sword truly materialized, drawn from his spine, formed by sun-like Heavenly Light. People were shocked as a massive dragon soared into the sky, incredibly thick and radiating an unstoppable sharpness, heading straight into the firmament. Lu Zizai gripped its tail, wielding the dragon sword, and cleaved open the night sky! All the meteorite-like consciousness lights shattered at that moment, incinerated into ashes by the Heavenly Light carried by the colossal dragon sword.

Moreover, with a pop, the gigantic face in the sky was split in two. Then, his face exploded again! Pu Heng let out a pained groan. This time, a portion of his consciousness was permanently destroyed, and his immortal characteristics didn't fully withstand it.

In an instant, the shattered Pure Yang power violently trembled in the night sky. The consciousness power, like a sunset glow, raged continuously, sweeping across the heavens and earth, more terrifying than a true hurricane.

At this moment, the earth was torn, and the pervasive night mist churned, affecting a vast area! Pu Heng's Pure Yang light was no longer human-shaped; it transformed into clouds and mist, like wind scattering remnants of clouds, drawing in the clear qi from the nine heavens and the ancestral earth脉 qi. He was connecting with heaven and earth, forming millstones of clouds and mist—one descending from the night sky, one rising from the ground—spinning madly, intending to grind his opponent into bloody paste. Such a grand spectacle made many people's hearts pound. Even from a great distance, they felt as if they were caught within it, fearing they would be destroyed along with it.

Between heaven and earth, Lu Zizai stood still, the colossal dragon sword in his hand vanishing. People were alarmed. The clear qi of the nine heavens and the ancestral earth脉 qi merged, and heaven and earth seemed to rapidly draw closer, about to converge and destroy everything. Lu Zizai slapped one hand towards the night sky and struck the other towards the ground. The dense clear qi of the nine heavens exploded with a roar, and the ancestral earth脉 qi was scattered into disarray. Everyone was lost in awe, feeling profound shock. The great cloud millstones seemed to represent heaven and earth, yet they were pierced by the seemingly tiny figure in the middle, shattered to pieces with bare hands.

Pu Heng's enormous face reappeared, dimmer than before, another portion of his Pure Yang consciousness permanently erased. However, this time, as soon as he materialized, he received another blow. Lu Zizai's Heavenly Light energy surged up, transforming into a large hand in the night sky, like Pure Yang consciousness, and with a smack, it slapped that face. Crimson mist splattered everywhere, the giant face exploded, and Pu Heng took a solid hit, as if endless fiery clouds were surging.

"You..." He was enraged; in front of everyone, he had been slapped. Lu Zizai was publicly slapping him, highly damaging and extremely humiliating. In this region, all parties were astonished. No one had expected such an incident to occur.

"You have a big face," Lu Zizai said. Then, he calmly looked at the night sky and continued, "Who gave you the audacity? To say those battle achievements were fake? Do you, of all people, presume to cover the sky with one hand and twist right into wrong!"

Lu Zizai's white hair was unbound, appearing somewhat more weathered than last time, but Qin Ming knew this was his old body he wished to shed, not his new one. People's emotions surged; he was standing up for the young man from the New Life Path. A young outer saint had actually drawn out such a major figure! Qin Ming's exposure in this manner caused a great stir. Many people heard his name for the first time; before this, he had been unknown.

At Kunling, some geniuses from various academies showed surprise. Because, to their astonishment, they realized they had met that Qin Ming before. When exploring the secret realm together, they had rejected his request to team up. Except for a few like Jiang Ruoli, Liu Hanhya, and Gan Jincheng, other geniuses only learned of his true background today, realizing it was terrifying. For a moment, they were all petrified. Thinking back to that day, they had considered him a burden and believed he was feigning enlightenment. Now, recalling it, they felt their faces burning.

"And that Wu Yaozu was also one of the young men that day!" Zhao Muyao, Wang Lijie, and a group of top-tier geniuses were dumbfounded. The two young men they had politely rejected had both obtained more than two portions of auspicious beast blood. Furthermore, Qin Ming's achievements even surpassed those of immortal seeds and divine seeds.

"Are you trying to oppose my Pure Land?" Pu Heng's enormous head was like a great mountain, and the night sky trembled when he spoke. Many felt their hair stand on end, feeling as if heaven and earth were about to collapse.

"Do you represent the Outer Pure Land?" Lu Zizai asked. He raised his right hand, and all five fingers glowed, each shooting out a sun-like Heavenly Light force, like five golden chains, rapidly extending into the dark night sky. Pu Heng's consciousness could gather and disperse invisibly, coming and going without a trace, but now, he felt a deep unease, as if he had been locked onto. He shot upwards, wanting to escape this place.

However, the five golden Heavenly Light divine chains transformed into five gigantic golden dragons, detaching from Lu Zizai and directly plunging into the depths of the clouds and mist, catching up to him. With a whoosh, the five dragons coiled around his body, binding him and swiftly dragging him down. This scene made all parties' hearts pound wildly. Lu Zizai of the New Life Path truly possessed heaven-piercing abilities. Was there no difference between his Heavenly Light and Pure Yang consciousness?

Pu Heng was seething with anger. In the brief exchange, nothing had gone his way; he had suffered heavy losses repeatedly, and now he was even bound. He struggled violently, the red sun he had transformed into burning fiercely, trying to break free from his shackles. The five dragons raised their heads, each tightening its grip on him, their heads gnawing at him, tearing apart the red sun, and dragging him down towards the plateau.

"This..." Many found it hard to believe. How much time had passed? Had Pu Heng already been captured alive? The disciples of the Immortal Path were all numb. Hadn't it been said that their path held all advantages, allowing them to look down on all new cultivators? What they witnessed today overturned their understanding. The impact brought by this white-haired young man named Lu Zizai was truly too great.

As for those on the New Life Path, their emotions soared like never before. For the first time, they felt: "Our path can actually be this strong!" One must know that Lu Zizai had captured no ordinary outsider, but Cao Qianqiu's renowned senior disciple. The value of this achievement was immensely high.

"Lu Zizai, for a young man from the New Life Path, are you going to start a war with my Immortal Path?" Pu Heng spoke, having already fallen to the ground. The five great dragons locked him, and no matter how he transformed, he couldn't escape. Now, his heart was pounding in fear.

"You're not worthy," Lu Zizai said, slapping him, causing him to instantly explode on the spot. Moreover, this time, after Pu Heng disintegrated, he couldn't escape. He remained surrounded by the five great dragons, which confined all his stream of consciousness.

"You..." The crimson mist he emanated further dimmed. His so-called immortal characteristics couldn't withstand repeated heavy blows. If this continued, he would be ground to death, or even suddenly perish.

"You don't have Cao Qianqiu's fate, but you've caught his disease. Do you want to flaunt your dominance? Your hostility towards our path is too strong; you deserve to be beaten, to be cut down!"

After Lu Zizai finished speaking, nine phoenixes coiled around his feet, Heavenly Light blindingly bright. He kicked out, and with a boom, Pu Heng exploded! Many stared with wide eyes. What kind of ruthless person was this? Kicking Pu Heng to explode was too shocking. Pu Heng, immensely arrogant and dominant for so many years, had finally met his match. He was captured and savagely beaten, making everyone's minds tremble. Some felt their hearts surge, others their blood boil.

Only Pu Heng knew how catastrophic his losses were. Lu Zizai's attacks were terrifying; they could even sever his immortal characteristics. Now, he had already lost 20% of his Pure Yang consciousness. If this spread, it would definitely strike fear into the hearts of those in the Outer Lands.

"Where did you get the courage to disrespect my New Life Path?" Lu Zizai's foot was planted on Pu Heng's body as he looked down at him. Without a doubt, this scene would be permanently etched in everyone's minds. No matter how many years passed, Pu Heng would never be able to wash away this humiliation.

"Do you want to sever the New Life Path?" Lu Zizai asked.

The resources in this world were limited. Even the living environment for ordinary people needed improvement, the population was constantly expanding, and the fire springs were insufficient. These were all major problems, and the various paths were in competition with each other. Otherwise, the higher-ups wouldn't be preparing for the Great Reclamation. The New Life Path didn't have as many powerful individuals, but its base population was enormous. Because many ordinary people could walk this path, they didn't require special endowments. The prospects of the New Life Path were indeed somewhat bleak. In the first stage, ordinary people could only rely on mutations to become stronger. And from the second realm onwards, their progress was even slower. The Cao Qianqiu lineage's prejudice against the New Life Path wasn't simple; one could glean a hint of their deep hostility from their attempts to stifle overlords. Pu Heng was naturally influenced by his master.

A silver mace appeared in Lu Zizai's hand, and with a bang, the person under his foot exploded again. Pu Heng's Pure Yang consciousness exploded multiple times. Besides feeling intensely humiliated, he was also terrified; if this continued, he would face a life-or-death tribulation. Lu Zizai stopped speaking, concentrating on beating Pu Heng, wearing down his Pure Yang consciousness. Many people saw that this was meant to cripple him!

"Lu Zizai, spare others where you can." At this moment, an old man appeared, with a head full of silver hair, a clean complexion, and deep-set eyes. Many Immortal Path disciples were greatly shaken. Another major figure had arrived: this was Wei Yunqi, Sun Taichu's second disciple, a front-rank figure below the Ancestor-level!

"The punishment isn't enough!" Lu Zizai stated.

"Lu Zizai, your Six Imperial Ancestor isn't doing well; how dare you be so presumptuous? Release my Senior Brother!" In the distant sky, two blinding flames appeared, like two comets hurtling from outside the heavens, diving towards the dark earth, carrying an aura of destruction. People's minds trembled. Some experts recognized that within those two masses of Pure Yang consciousness were two powerful inheritors under Cao Qianqiu. They arrived in an instant, attacking Lu Zizai.

At the same time, Sun Taichu's second disciple, Wei Yunqi, also stepped forward, his consciousness illuminating the sky.

"Trying to gang up on him?"

"Come on over!" Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan stepped forward, their wide sleeves fluttering. With a boom, they shattered the pervasive night mist, confronting the two diving figures. For a moment, Heavenly Light surged into the sky, and Pure Yang power boiled as several top experts clashed.

"It's fine, please step back, both of you. Let them all come!" Lu Zizai said. At the same time, he pushed Wei Yunqi back with one palm and lifted Pu Heng with the other hand.

"Ah..." Pu Heng shrieked, a sound inconsistent with his usual domineering and forceful demeanor. At this moment, he struggled violently, his cries like wails. Everyone's expressions changed. Was Lu Zizai planning something big?! He unleashed thunderous, extremely violent methods, gripping most of Pu Heng's consciousness in his hand. After his Six Imperial energy burst forth, firelight burned the sky, eroding and dissolving that portion of crimson mist, aiming to utterly destroy it.

Finally, Pu Heng's dimmed figure re-condensed in the night sky, his strength plummeted! Because he had lost a total of 60% of his Pure Yang consciousness; he was essentially half-crippled.

"How dare you do this?" Pu Heng's two junior brothers supported him, both showing expressions of shock and fury. Lu Zizai calmly stated, "You only allow your lineage to act domineeringly, not allowing others to fight back, is that it? Today, I won't indulge you. I'll correct your bad habits." He stood with his hands behind his back, motioning Yu Gensheng and Zhao Ziyuan to retreat, facing the four masters alone.

Some shrewd old cultivators realized that something major was definitely going to happen today; the storm seemed to have just begun. Lu Zizai standing up for that young man might just be an impetus, deliberately breaking the silence today, very likely to establish prestige for the New Life Path. In fact, his actions might only be the first wave. Later, even more terrifying major events might occur.

Wei Yunqi spoke, "Lu Zizai, aren't you afraid of provoking a conflict between our two paths by dealing such a heavy hand?"

Yu Gensheng, with his fiery temper, couldn't hold back anymore and said, "Who exactly is instigating trouble? The true achievements of our New Life Path's young genius are right there, verifiable by memory crystals. Anyone with eyes can see them. But that grandson Pu Heng not only wants to slander him but also wants to stifle the prodigies of our path. This is going too far!"

Zhao Ziyuan sneered even more, "How ridiculous. He wants to cover the sky with one hand, but he doesn't have the ability, only making a fool of himself here for nothing." Instantly, crimson mist swirled around Pu Heng's entire body. Even though he was severely injured, he wanted to go and tear those two old men apart.

"If you're not convinced, suppress it, or you'll die," Lu Zizai said calmly, looking at the opposing side. Pu Heng and his two junior brothers felt a surge of stifled rage in their chests, an unspoken resentment. Usually, they were the ones who made others uncomfortable, making them dare not speak out in anger. But now, someone was even more overbearing than them, pushing them all to their limits.

"Attack!" In an instant, Pu Heng's two junior brothers launched their attack. Two great suns hung in the sky, illuminating the night like day, and charged forward!

At this moment, Lu Zizai's true body remained unmoving. From his physique, four dense Heavenly Lights surged forth, all transforming into human forms. The four figures emitted boundless light, shattering the night sky with Heavenly Light. Some wore crowns, some held jade tablets, and some had imperial seals suspended by their sides. All were incredibly majestic, each stepping on the void and ascending into the sky.

In an instant, Pu Heng, his two junior brothers, and Sun Taichu's second disciple Wei Yunqi were all blocked.

"Heavenly Light fusing with consciousness, can it also roam the Great Void?" People on the New Life Path were immensely excited to witness this scene, seeing the prospects for their future.

"The Four Imperials!" Some elder cultivators showed grave expressions. Even Wei Yunqi, Pu Heng, and others had slight changes in their complexions.

"Is that the Four Imperial energy of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court?" a young man asked his grandfather.

"No, this represents four domains, or rather, four beings at the pinnacle of the pyramid, manifested by him through Heavenly Light. It's quite terrifying!" On the plateau, everyone was alarmed. Lu Zizai's true body remained unmoving; he manifested the Four Imperials to face the four masters.

In an instant, they moved far from the area, entering the depths of the plateau and soaring above the dark cloud layer, where the most terrifying battle erupted. No one had expected things to escalate to this point! Everyone gazed into the distance. Although they wanted to watch the battle, they dared not enter the depths of the plateau, fearing they would be caught in the aftermath. The distance was too great. People could only see the dark clouds being torn open from time to time, the night mist dissipating, and blinding beams of light, thicker and brighter than lightning, occasionally streaking across the sky. Everyone was both afraid and eager to witness such a high-level confrontation, feeling an unbearable itch of anticipation.

Subsequently, many eyes turned to Qin Ming. It now seemed highly probable that his true achievements were indeed sufficient to earn him four portions of auspicious beast blood.

"Simply mentioning his name, perhaps many wouldn't know, but if we talk about his background, I think many should have heard: he is a discarded child of the Cui family." Someone secretly revealed.

In this region, people were in an uproar. There was such a hidden truth? In fact, some great aristocratic families knew about this matter, especially the Cui, Li, and Wang families. The expressions of the Cui family members were very ugly; they felt extremely uncomfortable in their hearts. A mere substitute, a discarded child, yet today he was the focus of all attention, having obtained the most auspicious beast blood. How would outsiders view the Cui family because of this? They felt as if they had been slapped, gravely offended. Especially, doing so in front of many acquaintances was extremely embarrassing. What they had originally suppressed was now revealed again today.

Back then, when Qin Ming had not yet risen and had no dazzling achievements on the New Life Path, after Meng Xinghai strongly protected him, Cui's father and others didn't kill him, but they warned him not to step into his old circles again, nor to return to the sight of aristocratic acquaintances. Yet today, he passively became renowned everywhere. Qin Ming simply revealed his true appearance, standing here openly and honorably. Immediately, both acquaintances and those meeting him for the first time showed strange expressions. Such a young man was actually abandoned by the Cui family?

"One can't blame the Cui family either. Before he embarked on the New Life Path, who knew how many times his body could mutate? This path is very mysterious; mutated root bones are not necessarily linked to the earliest displayed enlightenment." However, many still looked in the Cui family's direction, feeling their loss was quite significant!

"It's really him? How is that possible!" Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan's eyes widened, as if they had seen a ghost. After not seeing him for a few months, the other party had risen rapidly, as if a world-shaking change had occurred.

Boom!

Deep within the plateau, lightning flashed and thunder roared, fierce winds raged, and the pervasive dark clouds scattered, completely shattered. The four figures dimmed, tottering, and then began to flee.

"How could this be?!" Many cultivators of the Immortal Path were dumbfounded, unable to believe it. It was actually Wei Yunqi, Pu Heng, and others fleeing, being chased by the Four Imperials, all severely injured. How much time had passed? "Didn't they say our Immortal Path masters hold a dominant position in the later stages? Why is this Lu Zizai so strong!" Many on the Immortal Path found it hard to accept this outcome. Four against one, and they still couldn't win?

"He's very mysterious, a unique case. Legend has it, his endowment is even higher than the Six Imperial Ancestors'!" an elder figure sighed softly. Those on the New Life Path had fervent eyes. It had been years since they had seen such an inspiring high-level battle. Their seniors on this path had finally stopped being low-key and revealed their brilliant side.

"Lure me away, and you think you can overturn the heavens?" In the distance, a bloody great sun appeared horizontally in the sky, instantly dispelling the night mist over the entire plateau, unusually dazzling and terrifying, causing many people to involuntarily tremble. Cao Qianqiu appeared, arriving at this place! Everyone's scalps tingled. Even people from the Outer Lands feared him far more than they respected him. His reputation was too great, hated by gods and loathed by ghosts, overly negative. However, everyone cursed Cao Qianqiu in their hearts, hated Cao Qianqiu, but everyone also wished to become Cao Qianqiu.

"You want to bully the small with the great?!" Along the way, a scorching sun rose. This was a figure formed from pure Heavenly Light, golden radiance illuminating all directions, its aura terrifyingly powerful.

"The Six Imperials... personally present!" An elder gasped. Indeed, everything had been foreshadowed. Someone truly wanted to cause a major incident today. People from all paths immediately speculated, strongly suspecting that the New Life Path's Ancestor had little lifespan left and intended to shine brightly in his final moments, forging a "harmonious" future!

"Lu Yu, calm your anger, why go to such lengths!" Sun Taichu appeared, standing in the sky, arriving with leisurely steps. Although he said that, he was clearly on Cao Qianqiu's side.

With a cold snort, heaven and earth trembled, the entire sky seemed to rip open, and a terrifying light curtain appeared, as if a giant capable of holding up the heavens was walking forth. "Hiss, Qingtian has arrived!" Even the grand figures of the Esoteric Sect showed expressions of shock.

"We have been in secluded cultivation for many years; do you think there are no more Ancestors on the New Life Path?!" Another brilliant great sun rose from the horizon, composed of Heavenly Light, causing the night mist at the edge of the sky to burst apart, and the entire plateau trembled violently.
