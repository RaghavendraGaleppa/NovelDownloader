# Chapter 200: Lifebound Magical Treasure

In the Juesha Heavenly Pit, a massive gray formation stood towering, continuously absorbing endless streams of yin energy from its surroundings. The sounds of fierce combat echoed within.

Five towering ghostly creatures surrounded a middle-aged man, relentlessly striking with their tridents.

Although the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was still nurturing his lifebound magical treasure within his dantian, as a member of the Dai Family—a mining giant in the cultivation world—he naturally wasn't limited to just one magical treasure like those from smaller sects. In his hand now appeared a small black umbrella.

This umbrella was an inheritance from a Golden Core ancestor of his direct lineage within the Dai Family. Crafted primarily from "Black Silver Essence" mined from a silver essence deposit, it was purely a defensive magical treasure.

Since breaking through to the Golden Core stage and becoming the patriarch of his lineage, inheriting this family heirloom, he had never had the opportunity to reveal it publicly, so outsiders remained unaware of its existence.

This treasure was precisely why he dared to swagger about so boldly shortly after reaching the Golden Core stage.

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord weren't particularly surprised. They had anticipated that a Golden Core cultivator would likely possess magical treasures. However, seeing that his was a defensive treasure, they both secretly sighed in relief.

Their original plan had been to use the "Illusory Spirit Mesmerizing Formation" to create a jungle of illusions, concealing the five Golden Core ghost generals of the "Five Ghosts Yin Energy Formation." In this maze, the ghost generals could advance or retreat freely, appearing and disappearing unpredictably to launch surprise attacks—this was their guarantee of successively weakening the enemy by sixty percent.

But now, the Illusory Spirit Mesmerizing Formation had been mostly destroyed, and repairing it wasn't something that could be done quickly. Left with only the Five Ghosts Yin Energy Formation, the five ghostly creatures temporarily condensed from yin energy, though possessing Golden Core strength, couldn't compare to a true Golden Core cultivator. At best, they could tie up thirty percent of his combat power.

Had the opponent wielded an offensive magical treasure, a life-or-death struggle might have tipped the scales unfavorably.

But now, with only a defensive treasure in hand, the five Golden Core ghost generals attacked recklessly, surrounding the Dai Family cultivator. For the moment, he was at a disadvantage, forced into a defensive stance.

"Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!"

Five tridents struck the black umbrella simultaneously, failing to leave even a scratch—testament to the defensive treasure's sturdiness. The Dai Family cultivator remained unharmed beneath its shelter.

Yet Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord showed no urgency, calmly observing the six figures darting about in chaotic combat within the formation.

With the Juesha Heavenly Pit providing an endless supply of yin energy, the ghost generals had ample reserves, making consumption a non-issue.

---

The Dai Family cultivator, however, was expending both mana and physical strength to maintain his defense. Once his reserves were depleted, he would be at their mercy.

He understood this well. The formation was rooted in the Juesha Heavenly Pit, making a battle of attrition untenable. He needed to end the fight quickly.

Though he hadn't mastered minor divine abilities and couldn't yet wield his lifebound treasure, he still possessed high-level spells and artifacts, which he wielded with practiced ease.

Suddenly, golden blades materialized in the air, raining down in all directions. A meteor hammer swung with formidable force, a brown gourd poured out streams of golden sand, and an illusory golden guillotine appeared.

These Foundation Establishment-level techniques, empowered by Golden Core mana, far surpassed their usual potency, swiftly reversing the tide. The ghost generals, formed from condensed yin energy, howled as they were pushed back.

Watching the Dai Family cultivator hold his own against five opponents, Lin Shan couldn't help but marvel.

Having never faced a Golden Core cultivator in battle before, he lacked a concrete understanding of their strength. Observing high-level combat from afar was like viewing flowers through fog—only firsthand experience could reveal the truth.

Now, witnessing the Dai Family cultivator relying solely on spells and artifacts—mere Foundation Establishment tools—to contend with five ghost generals, Lin Shan felt a surge of admiration. The empowering effect of Golden Core mana was incomparably superior to spiritual energy.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord sensed the danger. The Dai Family cultivator's strategy was clear: eliminate the ghost generals, break the formation, and regain the initiative.

But the demon lord hadn't staked everything on just two formations. Its skeletal hands wove intricate gestures as the soul fire in its skull blazed, chanting incantations. The five ghost generals suddenly became more agile, dodging nimbly and wielding their weapons with precision, even displaying hints of coordinated tactics.

"By the decree of the Five Directions' Ghostly Gods, Spirits of Yin Energy, arrayed in battle, united in will. Five Stars Imprison, Light Illuminates the Nether. We beseech Yama, dispatch your envoys. By the urgent law, so it is done!"

The ghost generals' yin energy surged, their green eyes gleaming with newfound vitality. Their tridents moved in unison, encircling the Dai Family cultivator and trapping him at the center.

"Ghost Path Secret Art!"

The Dai Family cultivator's eyes darted frantically as the rotating ghosts constricted his movement, his mana draining like a flood. He nearly dropped his umbrella in shock, staring incredulously at the duo outside the formation.

That skeletal monster beside the young man wasn't just a formation master—it also wielded such profound secret arts. What was its origin?

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord wasn't finished. After empowering the ghosts, it took direct control of the formation, commanding them to execute a "Combined Assault Secret Technique" against their target.

As a master of summoning and legion tactics from the Fifth Hell, leading armies of millions in battle, orchestrating five ghosts was child's play.

The Dai Family cultivator's pressure skyrocketed. Facing the coordinated assault, his spells were effortlessly dismantled, his artifacts shattered one after another, until only his black umbrella remained for defense.

The tables had turned again, with the five ghosts leaping about, pummeling their foe.

"Tsk—!"

Lin Shan's mind reeled as he glanced at the Black Skeleton Demon Lord. He remembered how, back in the Eastern Sea, this creature had fought above its weight at the Qi Refining stage against Foundation Establishment opponents. Now, at Foundation Establishment, it was contending with a Golden Core cultivator. This was insane!

Thankfully, Elder Huang had given him the Contract Gold Page in time, or he'd have had no way to restrain this monster.

That said, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's strength lay in its professional skills. As a formation master and artifact-forging grandmaster with Nascent Soul-level combat experience and secret techniques, it could effortlessly handle opponents below its level.

Without its summons and equipment, however, it was just a rickety skeleton—utterly fragile.

Its current advantage stemmed from the high-tier Five Ghosts Yin Energy Formation, the natural yin energy of the Juesha Heavenly Pit, and the secret arts enhancing the ghosts' coordination, allowing it to bully a newly minted Golden Core cultivator.

Yet even so, protected by his family's black umbrella, the Dai Family cultivator held firm. No matter how fiercely they attacked, he remained unyielding.

Simultaneously, he began absorbing mid-grade spirit stones and swallowing recovery pills.

Outside the formation, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's soul fire blazed fiercely—clearly, it was overdrawing its soul power to maintain the secret arts. It was anyone's guess who would outlast the other.

After about fifteen minutes, amidst swirling yin energy and flying debris, the black umbrella still stood tall. The Dai Family cultivator gulped down more pills, desperately replenishing his mana.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord finally began to falter. Gritting its teeth, it glared at the defensive treasure and sought external assistance.

"Lend me your magical treasure!"

Snatching Lin Shan's Severing Water Sword, it sent the weapon into the formation, placing it in the hands of the lead ghost general. Empowered by the sword, the ghost's combat prowess surged.

"Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang! Clang!"

The Dai Family cultivator buckled under the onslaught. Though his umbrella held, relentless attacks would eventually damage it and exhaust his strength.

No matter how he struggled, his spells were effortlessly countered by the ghosts under the demon lord's control. Any artifacts he summoned were sliced apart by the Severing Water Sword, a sight too pitiful to behold.

Lin Shan winced at the waste—if the Dai Family cultivator died, those artifacts would have been his spoils!

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord cackled manically, its taunts growing increasingly venomous, clearly venting its earlier frustration:

"Still acting tough? Keep pretending!"

"Nice performance earlier—'formation master,' 'child's play,' 'minor divine abilities.' So impressive!"

"A mere decade-old Golden Core runt. In the Hell World, I'd have crushed countless like you underfoot. How dare you, an ant, boast?"

"Submit to you? Are you even worthy?"

...

Though the demon lord seemed to be gloating, its true aim was psychological warfare—and it worked brilliantly.

The Dai Family cultivator's face flushed with humiliation. As a scholar from the Confucian academy, such mockery struck deep. His defense grew increasingly erratic.

Lin Shan, not to be outdone, joined the verbal assault, his voice carrying into the formation:

"Truly, the venerable's divine powers are boundless. For us to challenge our betters is like mayflies shaking a tree or a mantis blocking a chariot. We act only out of desperation, trembling with fear."

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, now in full swing, cut to the chase: "Desperation? I want him dead! His corpse will rebuild my Black Skeleton Golden Body!"

Lin Shan feigned concern: "Brother, don't be careless. The Dai Family cultivator is still a Golden Core expert. He might drag us down with him."

The demon lord laughed: "The fish will die, but the net may remain unbroken."

Lin Shan pressed: "He might have other trump cards. What if he takes us all out?"

The demon lord retorted: "Other hills' stones can polish jade."

Lin Shan sighed: "If he escapes, we'll never know peace."

The demon lord smirked: "Heaven's net is wide, but none escape its mesh."

...

Their call-and-response sarcasm was infuriating.

Inside the formation, the Dai Family cultivator's face burned with shame and rage. Distracted, he left an opening—and paid the price.

"Gah—!"

A mouthful of heart's blood sprayed forth, his complexion paling like paper.

"You little—! You've enraged me!"

At his wit's end, the Dai Family cultivator gritted his teeth, a pained expression flashing across his face as he resolved to abandon caution and retrieve something from his dantian.

A small golden lock!

Hazy and dreamlike, it pulsed with golden ripples that merged with the environment, rendering the cultivator semi-transparent. The ghost generals, touched by the golden light, froze like puppets with their strings cut.

The cultivator struck his own chest, expelling two streams of Golden Core essence onto a high-level artifact, which glowed crimson before shooting forth.

"Boom—!"

The lead ghost general, immobilized by illusion, exploded in a shower of blood and yin energy, intensifying the surrounding miasma.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord ignored the sacrificial art, its gaze fixed on the golden lock. Recognizing it instantly, it exclaimed:

"Lifebound Magical Treasure!"

Lin Shan shuddered. The Dai Family cultivator had a second magical treasure—a lifebound one at that!

Golden Core cultivators' treasures came in two varieties:

First, inherited treasures, refined in the dantian. Even if not originally theirs, prolonged nurturing could restore full potency—a convenient option.

Second, custom-forged treasures, tailored to one's techniques. These could unleash 120% of their power after decades of nurturing—lifebound treasures!

A twenty percent boost might seem small, but in battles between equals, even a slight edge could decide victory.

Given the scarcity of resources, most cultivators opted for inherited treasures, avoiding the monumental cost of crafting new ones—equivalent to a lifetime of debt in Lin Shan's previous world.

Only the exceptionally talented or those backed by major powers could afford lifebound treasures.

The Dai Family cultivator's black umbrella had been an inheritance. Yet shockingly, this newly advanced Golden Core cultivator had somehow crafted his own lifebound treasure!

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord were stunned anew.
