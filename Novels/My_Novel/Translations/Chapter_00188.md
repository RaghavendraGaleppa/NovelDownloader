Chapter 188: I Have Reached the Peak, Seeking Martial Arts in the High Tower

Peng Lianyun grew even more anxious seeing the situation. He forced a look of delight, appearing as if savoring an exquisite taste, an expression of endless aftertaste. It was as if he were saying: It is truly delicious, everyone must believe me!

Li Xian said, "It seems Brother Peng has a great fondness for this type of food."

The prodigies could no longer hold back and burst into laughter. Peng Lianyun’s face turned the color of a pig’s liver, his brows twitching in fury. He knew he could no longer hide it. Since childhood, he had held a high status; how could he ever bear being laughed at?

A malicious thought arose in his heart: "I have made a fool of myself, that is true, but you shall not fare any better!" He circulated his Internal Qi, faced Li Xian, and prepared to spew the rotten substance from his mouth.

The two were only a zhang apart. Li Xian had long been on guard. He stepped forward swiftly and pinched Peng Lianyun’s lips shut. The Internal Qi rebounded with a shock, forcing the rotten matter back down into his stomach.

"You!"

Peng Lianyun had not expected this and could not resist. He felt the foul, rotten object slide down his intestines and into his belly, an extreme nausea washing over him. Between shock and anger, he stumbled back several steps, opening his mouth to curse. The moment he opened it, the stench spread everywhere.

Everyone covered their noses and frowned.

Peng Lianyun looked around, at a complete loss. He glanced outside the lake and realized that the great clans, sects, martial schools, and commoners... were all watching.

Such a great humiliation was as good as death to him.

Overwhelmed by shame and anger, his blood boiled, and his Internal Qi surged, assuming a posture of fighting to the death. But moments later, he suddenly clutched his stomach, fell to the ground in agony, and foamed at the mouth.

It turned out...

The rotten shrimp had already produced toxicity; an ordinary mud-level martial artist would die immediately upon eating it. The bodies of refined martial artists, washed and tempered by the essence of heaven and earth, possessed strong resistance. If one tasted it and realized the flavor was off, spitting it out immediately would ensure no harm.

But Peng Lianyun, to save face, endured the bitterness and stench, chewing it for a long time. By then, the poison had entered his body, though the symptoms were not yet apparent as the poisoning was shallow. Later, he swallowed the rotten shrimp into his stomach.

Poison added to poison, and it struck instantly, causing excruciating abdominal pain.

He was nearly unconscious and completely devoid of fighting strength.

A moment later, his whole body convulsed, cold sweat poured out, and his luxurious clothes were completely soaked. He muttered incoherently, the situation becoming critical.

Just now, his anger had attacked his heart, causing his Qi and blood to flow erratically, sending the toxins straight to his heart meridian.

A prodigy named Zhang Xiao stepped out quickly. With agile footwork, he lifted Peng Lianyun onto a table and struck him on the back with his palm. Peng Lianyun spat out the rotten contents of his stomach with a "pfft" sound.

However, some of the poison had already spread throughout his body. Zhang Xiao felt his pulse, frowned, then relaxed, knowing exactly how to handle it. With a graceful motion, he undid his jade belt and pulled out ten gold needles.

His hands moved like the wind, inserting the needles naturally.

A moment later, Peng Lianyun’s condition stabilized, but his lips were black and purple, the poison not yet eliminated. Zhang Xiao said, "Brother Peng has been poisoned. Although the poison is not fatal, he cannot participate in this grand banquet."

Zhang Xiao walked to the side of the building and called out loudly into the empty air, "Please send a boat to take Brother Peng back to recuperate."

Li Xian praised, "Truly worthy of being the Golden Needle Divine Doctor, Young Master Zhang. A physician’s benevolent heart, superior skills. I have long admired you, long admired you."

Zhang Xiao smiled gently and said, "Brother Li, it is you I have long admired."

Peng Lianyun was taken away by boat. The farce was over, and everyone took their seats, continuing to taste the food. A stick of incense later, several dishes were served one after another.

The onlookers, though far away and only able to listen and watch, were by no means bored. Every dish was accompanied by many strange anecdotes, insights, and knowledge. The prodigies present also displayed their various skills, eating splendidly and revealing their own talents.

They conversed eloquently, the atmosphere harmonious.

Everyone showed their elegance.

Thus, around the lake, the crowd grew larger, including citizens of the city and wandering martial artists. The grandeur of the event was beyond words.

Peng Lianyun was sent into the Dragon Gate Tower.

The Sect Master of the Seven Mountains Sect, "Peng Shan," performed back-palm therapy to force out the poison. After feeding him an antidote, Peng Lianyun’s complexion gradually improved, and he regained consciousness.

Peng Lianyun roared, "I will fight him to the death!" Remembering all the humiliations, he was so angry he wanted to die. Peng Shan said calmly, "Lianyun, you have already exited the stage. Do not make a further fool of yourself."

"Dad!" Peng Lianyun said, "My personal humiliation is minor, but tarnishing the sect's reputation is major. If this仇 is not avenged... how can we... how can we stand?"

Peng Shan did not speak, only looking at the lake surface. Seeing the mirror-like lake water rippling in circles, a strange scene suddenly appeared:

Two figures were fighting in the water mirror, both using basic martial arts, but exceptionally精彩.

The crowd was in an uproar, exclaiming in surprise repeatedly.

Two voices echoed over the lake. They spoke entirely of basic martial arts moves: Flying Eagle Spreading Wings, Sky Eagle Straight Drop, Tiger Pounce Claw Strike...

Every time a voice rang out, the reflection in the lake changed. It seemed that along with the two voices, a battle was taking place in the lake reflection.

"Dad, what is going on?" Peng Lianyun asked.

Peng Shan said, "Someone is debating martial arts, and their voices are carried on the lake surface. This lake is quite special. When a person's words contain profound martial intent, they can resonate with the lake, turning verbal debate into a battle of lake shadows."

Upon hearing this, Peng Lianyun became even more furious. Such a grand event was now completely out of his reach.

"Do not overthink it," Peng Shan shook his head. "Not every debate can trigger the lake mirror resonance and display a battle of lake shadows. The debater needs martial arts attainments approaching perfection to achieve such a scene. Even if you were present, the basic martial arts you practice are only barely at Great Completion. Though it is not bad, it is not enough to watch. To trigger the strange phenomenon of the lake shadow is extremely difficult."

"Of course... since you have suffered such a great loss, if there is a chance, I will help you get revenge."

The commotion here was felt most keenly by the prodigies in the Heavenly Man Tower, who cried out in surprise repeatedly:

"The moves used in the lake shadow, though just a simple Eagle Claw Hand, have offense and defense in order, approaching perfection, already establishing an invincible position."

"The opponent is not weak either, his moves fierce and straight."

"It is Wang Kun, ranked third on the Hero List, challenging the number one, Zhou Shijie. Both of their moves are extremely powerful, pulling at the artistic conception in the lake."

Not long after, the lake shadow paused and ceased movement. The two sides had decided the victor. However, the onlookers, and even the prodigies in the tower, could not tell the outcome. Who won and who lost was unknown, as if in a dream.

Zhang Xiao had saved Peng Lianyun, but he was enthusiastic by nature. Fearing he might have offended Li Xian afterward, he proactively offered a toast to show goodwill. Li Xian responded frankly, and the two went back and forth, already considering each other friends.

"Brother Li, was it a draw?" Zhang Xiao asked.

"No, it was a great victory for Zhou Shijie," Li Xian said.

"Zhou Shijie's Eagle Claw struck downward, and Wang Kun, unwilling to be outdone, used the move 'Fierce Tiger Raises Head.' The fist锋 went upward. This strike seemed like a stalemate, but in reality, the winner was already decided."

"Behind Zhou Shijie's Eagle Claw, there was still the potential to turn into a carp or a dragon, with thousands of changes to follow. Although Wang Kun was powerful and intended to hide his strength, in the heat of battle, the situation changed rapidly. He hid and hid, only to find he had no room to施展. Seeing himself in such a窘境, he admitted defeat."

"In short, one still had strength left, while the other had reached a dead end. If it were a life-and-death struggle, Wang Kun might have fought to the death, and the result might have been different. But in a friendly match, he was utterly defeated!"

Zhang Xiao pondered internally and found it to be true. But he did not dare to believe it completely and remained deep in thought.

A moment later, Wang Kun's voice drifted from the lake surface: "Brother Zhou is truly厉害. The number one spot belongs to you. If anyone covets it, they must ask me, Wang Kun, first."

He truly admitted defeat, and sincerely at that.

This grand occasion stirred the competitive spirit of the prodigies. One by one, they stepped forward to debate martial arts. The lake surface rippled, waves of disturbance spreading.

The banquet on the tower was a banquet, not a擂台. It was about displaying talent, with verbal debate being paramount. It showcased the grace of the prodigies. The atmosphere was in full swing, extraordinarily lively.

Li Xian frowned in thought: "The Madam ordered me to stir up the winds and waves, I do not know her intention. The prodigies in this tower all have backing forces and deep roots. Only I come and go alone, with no one to protect me."

"But since I am here, why not ascend the tower and seek martial arts? Do I not wish to meet the prodigies of the prefecture city?"

Li Xian was also young, also wild and arrogant!

At this time, the feast had not yet reached its halfway point. Li Xian clasped his hands in farewell to the people on the second floor and, with a潇洒 air, ascended the tower.

On the third floor were Luo Bu'er, Li Ruhu, and others. The layout of the floor was similar, only the bronze tripods held more wine, and the aroma was stronger. It was the same "Dream of a Thousand Returns," but the vintage was older, the taste more mellow.

Luo Bu'er was savoring the fine wine. He had already debated martial arts with several people, but no one could solve his martial arts problem. His arrogance soared to the heavens. Seeing someone else ascending, he sneered, "Well, here comes another to debate martial arts. If you know what's good for you, I advise you to go back down乖乖. Save yourself from becoming a laughingstock."

Li Xian glanced at him and did not stop, heading straight up to the fourth floor. Ascending the tower to seek martial arts was originally无可厚非. But Li Xian skipping floors was a great blow to everyone's face.

Li Ruhu on the same floor immediately roared in anger, "Boy, you are arrogant!" He threw the wine in his cup at Li Xian.

Li Xian exhaled forcefully from his lungs, his Qi energy surging. Having tempered a pair of iron lungs through the "Iron Copper Body" martial art, he applied it here perfectly. The wine splashed back.

Li Ruhu raised his eyebrows, unwilling to be outdone. He flipped forward, catching all the wine in the air back into his cup. It was intact, not a drop spilled.

There were fourteen prodigies on the third floor. They all slammed the table and stood up, shouting, "Boy, do you look down on us?!"

Li Xian said strangely, "When did I say I look down on you?"

"You skipped the third floor and went straight to the fourth floor. That means you don't have us in your eyes!" The crowd said angrily.

Li Xian said, "Must I occupy a seat on the third floor first before going to the fourth floor to debate martial arts,才算 look down on you?"

"You!" The crowd was furious but could not find fault.

Li Xian smiled lightly and said, "Very well, then I shall debate martial arts with you. I ask Brother Li for guidance." He pointed at Li Ruhu, who had just made a move. His humble demeanor gradually faded.

Li Ruhu's face turned ugly, and he agreed coldly. Debating martial arts... it seemed like a verbal dispute, but it was actually not simple at all.

Li Ruhu clasped his hands behind his back and spoke eloquently.

He had planned the sequence of moves in advance, describing them verbally:

First, use these "Ten Styles of the Dragon Swim" to maneuver, then apply various basic strange techniques with hands, elbows, and legs. He described the attainments of each martial art, how the layout was严密, how he advanced step by step, and how the moves connected smoothly and logically.

Taking one step, he anticipated three steps ahead.

This Li Ruhu was the chief disciple of the "Dragon and Tiger Martial School." A figurehead of the younger generation, his reputation was earned move by move. He had defeated countless opponents.

When his voice reached the lake surface, the wandering martial artists admired him greatly. Previously, when they fought with prodigies, they were defeated but did not know why. It seemed they were just a fraction short, and with a little more effort, they could catch up.

Today, hearing the debate, they understood that between a fight, there were delicate calculations of mind, advancing step by step, and psychological games. They suddenly woke up and realized the gap. Their confidence was completely shattered.

The wandering martial artists couldn't help but wonder: "How should this evil尉 Li Xian deal with it?"

All eyes were on him.

Li Ruhu asked arrogantly, "Given this, how would you solve it?"

How to solve it? The other prodigies were also deep in thought.

Li Xian said seriously, "I would solve it with my fists."

"Hahahaha," Li Ruhu said得意ly, "You are, after all, a disciple from a county. Your见识 is a bit shallow. I use the Ten Styles of the Dragon Swim to fight you, setting three traps. If you use fist techniques to应对, you are walking straight into the traps. You are truly straightforward."

He immediately detailed the move specifics.

"I attack like this, and you return with a fist move. Your old momentum is broken, your new momentum has not yet formed, so you will inevitably withdraw your hand to defend. At this time, I will do this, then that. In this battle, you have actually already lost."

"But it won't be revealed for a while. I need to use three more moves before you will vaguely notice the clue, but by then it will be too late."

As he spoke, he casually gestured. They were all basic martial arts. The potential rule of "Debating Martial Arts" was to debate using "Basic Martial Arts." Entry-level martial arts reveal their玄妙, and the key points within are岂是 words can clearly explain. Therefore, they are not included in the "Debating Martial Arts" list.

Luo Bu'er and the others all felt it made sense. They silently practiced in their hearts, all feeling that Li Ruhu had already achieved a great victory.

Li Xian said, "Actually, it is not so. The moves you used seem to connect naturally and advance step by step. In reality, they can all be resolved with fist techniques. Even the most basic Four Directions Fist can easily resolve them."

"The three traps you set just now are actually not traps. I just need to do this, and that. A set of fist techniques will naturally break all your moves."

He explained the principles of how to use the same set of fist techniques, similar moves, to break all of Li Ruhu's moves.

"This is pure boasting!"

Li Ruhu said angrily, "What you just said, relying on Great Completion or even Perfect basic fist techniques, is根本 impossible to achieve. If you reason like this so illogically, what is the meaning of debating martial arts? Or have you already reached the pinnacle? Hmph."

As soon as these words were spoken.

Lin Aoshan in the Dragon Gate Tower also frowned slightly. Li Xian's words were not wrong, and the method of resolution had some logic, but it required extremely high attainments in basic fist techniques. There were eighty or ninety sets of basic fist techniques in the prefecture city, but those who truly could reach "Perfect" were extremely rare.

Diligent study could lead to [Proficient].

With good talent, practicing day in and day out for ten years, one could reach [Small Completion].

Great Completion depends on机遇 and temperament. As for [Perfect], it is already a rarity.

The prefecture city is full of prodigies. With the talent of the prodigies present, if they practiced diligently, they might not be able to reach [Perfect]. However, the time and effort required would not be worth the gain.

Even basic martial arts inherently have flaws.

Reaching perfection requires filling in those flaws, making it even more difficult. As for [Pinnacle]... to reach the pinnacle of such lower-level martial arts, it might not be extremely厉害, but it is absolutely extremely rare!

Some dare to speak of [Perfect]. But who dares to say [Pinnacle]?

Gu Nianjun gazed at the lake, sipping tea lightly. Zhou Shijie was infatuated with her and went to great lengths to invite her to watch the tower banquet, intending to highlight his own talent. Who knew that by a twist of fate, Gu Nianjun's gaze was mostly fixed on Li Xian.

She thought: "Seeking martial arts is no joke. Speaking such nonsense is asking for trouble. He is still Ah-Fan. If necessary, I will have to speak up for him."

"But his character is too flashy. On the path of martial arts, how can he go far? He might find it hard to become a true hero, and hard to make me truly look at him with new eyes."

Suddenly, at this moment.

A sound echoed over the lake: "Li Xian, my friend, we invited you to the banquet, not to cause trouble sincerely. You had best ensure you are not speaking nonsense. Otherwise, my Cao family will have to invite you over for some tea."

The elder of the Cao family took the opportunity to make trouble.
