# Chapter 187: World Flame

"Okay."

Zhou Tian nodded, now having a clear understanding.

"Die!"

Yuan Chi wasn't just using the ancient stele; his body also glowed. With a dragon's roar, his outstretched hand transformed into a dragon claw, a terrifying sight. This was the manifestation of a secret art, and also the outline of one of the strongest physiques in the world.

*Boom!*

Flames surged, and a pair of wings burning with golden fire appeared on either side of his body.

The crowd didn't intervene. With the two strongest individuals battling, they were content to watch, but this divine ability also made their scalps tingle. Some had created techniques like Dragon Fist or Lion Seal by mimicking divine beasts, their power shaking the world, but these were always single techniques. They had never seen secret arts from more than one divine beast stacked together. This was the superposition of secret arts. If successful, it would be equivalent to comprehending myriad laws, far more than a simple one plus one. As Yuan Chi unleashed it, several legendary biological features began to manifest on his body. A terrifying aura permeated the air, incredibly dreadful. Even his hair, as it swayed, cut through the void. If a single strand fell, it could kill a powerful cultivator.

"Let me witness the might of the Yuan Tomb clan!" Saint Devil roared, his hair disheveled. As he opened his mouth, gases spewed out like a tornado, shaking the void. His gaze was icy cold, and beams of light swept across the entire dark starry sky.

He summoned a golden lotus to envelop Zhou Tian, then unleashed a fist technique. Golden light blossomed within his body, starting from a single point of vitality, erupting outward, then growing vigorously to obliterate all obstructions. Furthermore, outside his body, there was a layer of blood-red halo, as crimson as the evening glow, enveloping his form. A phantom image of a blood-colored Arhat appeared, bare-chested, muscles bulging, like an ancient god or demon.

*Arhat Fist!* This was a legacy art he had once obtained, different from that of Luotian Temple. This version had been improved by Wutian, and he had once exchanged many secret arts with Luotian Temple using it.

Yuan Chi went berserk, his wild, grass-like hair splayed out, two cold electric currents blazing in his eyes. He roared, primitive runes and creation symbols blooming from his mouth. His entire body was wrapped in dense chains of order as he charged at Saint Devil. The dragon claws were like dozens of exploding suns, tearing the void apart.

"Kill!" Saint Devil also went all out, confronting Yuan Chi.

*Bang!* The void trembled. Saint Devil's arm vibrated uncontrollably, and he was sent flying backward. Golden flames continuously scorched him. Yuan Chi's secret art also lost its balance, withdrawing from its special multi-state coexistence form.

*Pfft!* As Yuan Chi opened his mouth, a hanging galaxy appeared, refined from the starlight of the primal cosmos, merged with his own Great Dao. This was the Yuan Tomb clan: their profound arts and wondrous techniques were endless and never repeated. With another great killing move unleashed, the heavens and earth changed color, and the sky dimmed.

"Good!" Saint Devil's brilliant long hair flew wildly. A bead flew out from his glabella – precisely the lotus seed he had previously fused with. The lotus seed burst forth with Great Dao light, and chants echoed from the void, synchronizing with Saint Devil's breathing and the pulsations of heaven and earth, mastering the rhythm of the Great Dao's ebb and flow. Then it blossomed, a clear fragrance permeating the air, forming golden lotuses.

*Boom!* The golden lotuses collided with the hanging galaxy. Annihilation occurred between them, and great starry fissures appeared, dense and countless, terrifyingly black and unfathomably deep. It was as if a fierce beast had appeared here, devouring the cold cosmic space as food, bloodying life planets.

The duel between them was terrifying; some Heaven Kings were struck with fear, starting to doubt if staying here was the right choice. Because if it were them, they wouldn't even have a chance to scream, instantly turning to ash. Some quietly departed, suddenly realizing in the face of destruction that this was not something they could contend with, fearing being purged by the victor.

Yuan Chi roared to the sky. Behind him, a black stone stele appeared, only a person's height, with mysterious symbols moving across its surface. He swung the stone stele like a falling meteorite. This was the physical stele, not a mere projection, possessing unparalleled power. Saint Devil, hair disheveled, wielded fists incredibly blazing, as if condensed from refined gold, sturdy and immortal. He dodged the stele and smashed his fist towards Yuan Chi's body. The stele was retracted in time, and his fist struck its side, creating a clang and sparks.

"Since you are from Jiuzhou, you must die!" Yuan Chi whispered. His eyes grew even brighter, displaying an unrivaled, supreme demeanor. He was melting the starry sky, intending to merge with that black stone stele, transforming himself into a grand furnace of heaven and earth, wanting to refine Saint Devil away. That stone stele actually began to decompose, with Heaven Gold, Chaotic Jade Essence, and other materials rearranging themselves, reconstituting into a massive furnace body, aiming to seal Saint Devil.

*Clang!* Saint Devil threw a punch, radiating peerless dominance. Every punch he landed caused a large section of the furnace body to bulge out, as if he were about to punch through it.

"Body as fuel, World Flame, ignite!" Yuan Chi roared, throwing his body into the furnace.

At this moment, Saint Devil felt his hair stand on end. He genuinely sensed a crisis that made his heart pound; something was threatening his life. He immediately summoned the golden lotus, enveloping himself to resist the furnace body. With a *boom*, great flames burned the sky, soaring upward, truly incinerating the void. Both tangible and intangible things were consumed.

"World Flame?!" Saint Devil was greatly alarmed! This was a flame that could only appear when a world was annihilated, a flame of destruction. If he hadn't reacted in time and used the golden lotus to shield himself, something terrible would likely have happened just now. The firelight was too bizarre and sinister, incinerating various fragments of the Great Dao. All rules, all divine chains of order, were breaking apart, turning into fuel, making the flames even more intense, burning fiercely. Heaven and earth above and below were illuminated in a blaze.

This flame was sinister, terrifying to the extreme, and eerily quiet, yet it burned with immense vigor, silently destroying all tangible forms. Rules and Great Daos melted away with it, silently and without trace, capable of annihilating everything; it was far too dreadful. The black furnace body floated in the void, brilliant crimson flames burning within. The scene inside was not very clear.

"Alas..." Yellow Seven lightly sighed. The Yuan Tomb clan was truly terrifying. This World Flame only ignited when a world was annihilated, yet they could actually unleash it using their own bodies as a medium. It seemed that deal would have to be voided.

Zhou Tian's eyes flickered. The golden lotus above Saint Devil's head was already somewhat illusory, indicating that Saint Devil was at a critical juncture. In the distance, the golden runic chains enveloping the world's origin were breaking apart. Only a few of the thickest ones were still struggling to hold on, but they too were constantly trembling. The world's origin was on the verge of emerging.

"Help me!" Saint Devil's voice echoed from within the black furnace body. He realized he had still underestimated this World Flame. Although Yuan Chi had unleashed it through special means and it didn't possess the terrifying might of legend, it was still formidable. Even with the protection of the golden lotus, he felt his very existence dissolving, as if he were about to melt into the flames.
