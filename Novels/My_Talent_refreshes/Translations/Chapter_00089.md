# Chapter 89: Fengxia Market

Leaving Ling Xiaobai in the backyard, Chu Ning returned indoors to start a fire and cook spirit rice. He hadn't eaten well during the day, so he definitely needed to have some dinner.

"I should find an opportunity to buy some Bigudan from Senior Sister Gu for emergencies; it would be more convenient," Chu Ning muttered softly as he scooped spirit rice from his storage pouch. While cooking the spirit rice, he thought for a moment and added a bit more. He would cook some spirit rice for Ling Xiaobai to see if it would eat. After all, though he had some spirit stones, he wasn't wealthy enough to feed Ling Xiaobai expensive spirit herbs like Jade Orchid Fruit or Golden Yuan Fruit daily.

As he cooked, Chu Ning couldn't help but ponder the origin of this little spirit beast. The "Records of Wonders and Oddities" Zhuang Yunde had given him last time contained some information about spirit beasts. However, no matter how Chu Ning thought, he couldn't recall anything about such a small creature.

"It's a pity that the jade slip Deacon He gave me only contains information about spirit plants and herbs, nothing about spirit beasts." Luo Yiping and his group probably had information on spirit beasts, but Chu Ning naturally had no interest in asking them.

At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly recalled what Lin Changqing had mentioned about the recent beast calamity. It was said that a third-order demonic beast had emerged from the Green Gorge Mountain Range, causing the lower-order demonic beasts to panic. Ling Xiaobai certainly wasn't a third-order demonic beast, otherwise, it wouldn't have been so easily contained by him.

However, could the appearance of this third-order demonic beast be related to this little creature? As Chu Ning considered this, he subtly felt that this direction of thought seemed plausible.

"If that's the case, then Ling Xiaobai might have a significant background. And bringing it along would be inconvenient; I might need to prepare a spirit beast pouch to carry it when going out." Chu Ning thought to himself.

A while later, the spirit rice was cooked. Chu Ning also prepared two dishes, then called Ling Xiaobai over. Ling Xiaobai hesitated upon seeing the spirit rice but eventually started eating it. However, it didn't even glance at the two dishes.

After seeing Ling Xiaobai finish a bowl of spirit rice, Chu Ning finally felt a little relieved. Whatever else happened, at least providing food shouldn't be a problem. Just adding a bit more spirit rice each time was still affordable for him.

"I can't give it too many good things for now, or it'll get used to them, and I won't be able to afford to feed it," Chu Ning resolved, then instructed Ling Xiaobai to go back to the backyard. After tidying up, he resumed his routine of crafting talismans and cultivating.

The next day was market day. Chu Ning woke up early and went to a shop in the market city to buy a spirit beast pouch. What annoyed him was that when he took out the spirit beast pouch and tried to put Ling Xiaobai inside, the little creature shook its head incessantly and absolutely refused to enter. Since Chu Ning had no contract with it, he couldn't force it into the spirit beast pouch.

After thinking it over, Chu Ning could only temporarily give up and instruct it to stay in the backyard. The little fellow was obedient this time, staying directly in the backyard and falling soundly asleep. After half a day of interacting with it, Chu Ning had also discovered that this spirit beast truly loved to sleep. Besides eating and occasional activity, it spent most of its time sleeping.

Chu Ning sold some talisman paper, though not much. By the time the market was about to close in the afternoon, a sound transmission talisman landed outside his door. It was Lin Changqing, who informed him that he would take him to Fengxia Market the next day.

Early the next morning.

"Xiaobai, I'm going out today, so you stay in the backyard and don't go anywhere. Absolutely do not wander off. Everyone outside has Beast-Binding Talismans like mine, and they are all ruthless. If you fall into their hands..."

After a series of threats, Ling Xiaobai's little head nodded frantically. It looked as if dragging it outside would take a lot of effort. Seeing that it had promised to stay in the backyard, Chu Ning walked out of the courtyard to the shop's exterior.

Soon, Lin Changqing arrived on his spirit boat, picked up Chu Ning, and soared into the sky.

"Was your spirit field damaged?" Lin Changqing asked shortly after they left Yanji Market. Chu Ning had originally planned to report some losses, but after discovering Ling Xiaobai, he abandoned that idea. If Lin Changqing asked, he wouldn't be able to explain well. So, he shook his head this time, "With the restriction formation for protection, the spirit plants inside weren't damaged. It just delayed things for a few days, and the growth of the spirit plants slowed down a bit."

Lin Changqing nodded slightly upon hearing this, then suddenly said, "Then it was still affected. You don't need to pay this first month's tribute."

Chu Ning was stunned for a moment. He quickly reacted. "Thank you for your care, Deacon."

As he spoke, Chu Ning took out 50 spirit stones from his storage pouch and handed them to Lin Changqing. "I'm not very familiar with Fengxia Market; please guide me, Martial Uncle."

"Good. In the future, if there's nothing else, you can come out with me more often." Lin Changqing nodded, highly satisfied, seeing Chu Ning so understanding.

With a flick of his hand, Chu Ning's 50 spirit stones vanished into Lin Changqing's storage pouch. Chu Ning wasn't annoyed by this; instead, he felt greatly relieved. The information Zhuang Yunde provided was indeed good; this Deacon Lin, though stern-faced, was truly the same type of person as Zhuang Yunde. Getting things done with money was good. It saved him a lot of trouble.

Fengxia Market was not close to Yanji Market, but fortunately, Lin Changqing's spirit boat was fast. After more than an hour, the two had arrived in a bustling market city. Calling it a market city, or rather, a small city, would be more accurate.

Fengxia Valley was closer to the western side of the Green Gorge Mountain Range than Qingxi Sect, and further west was Illusory Moon Palace. Because of trade with both sects and the presence of more surrounding cultivation families and rogue cultivators, the scale of this market city was much larger than Qinghe Market near Qingxi Sect. As for Yanji Market, it couldn't even compare.

Moreover, as soon as he entered Fengxia Market, Chu Ning noticed that there were far fewer mortals in the market city than in Yanji Market or Qinghe Market. He didn't know if it was because it was further from mortal cities or for other reasons.

"Martial Uncle, are we going directly to Cloud Sea Pavilion?" Chu Ning asked when he saw Lin Changqing enter the market city with no intention of lingering, heading straight for its center. Lin Changqing had also asked Chu Ning to change his address to 'Martial Uncle' on the way, saying that calling him 'Deacon' was inconvenient when out and about.

Hearing Chu Ning's question, Lin Changqing nodded. "Cloud Sea Pavilion's reputation is assured. Today, the Cloud Sea Pavilion here in Fengxia Market happens to have an auction. We'll go take a look."

"An auction?" Chu Ning was naturally familiar with Cloud Sea Pavilion's auctions. He had witnessed one as an observer back in Qinghe Market. It was there that Chu Ning learned that Seven-Star Spirit Fruits were quite valuable. And it was also on that day that the Seven-Star Spirit Fruits in his backyard were discovered by Qi Chongmao, which then led to a series of subsequent events.

Chu Ning hadn't expected that on his first day in Fengxia Market, he would again be attending a Cloud Sea Pavilion auction. However, this time, with Lin Changqing accompanying him, he...

Thinking of this, Chu Ning immediately asked, "Martial Uncle, are you planning for me to buy that flying magic tool at the auction?"

Lin Changqing nodded, "You can't use overly advanced flying magic tools yet; your spiritual power isn't sufficient. If a suitable magic tool for the Qi Condensation stage is sold at this auction, its quality is generally better than those found by directly approaching vendors."

"If it's not available at the auction, it's not too late to buy it from them later."

Hearing Lin Changqing's words, Chu Ning nodded slightly. He said nothing more and followed him directly to Cloud Sea Pavilion. After all, although this market city was more prosperous than the ones Chu Ning had visited before, there wasn't much along the way that truly captured his interest.

They arrived at the center of the market city, where two tall pavilions stood. One had a sign reading "Cloud Sea Pavilion," while the other bore "Fengxia Pavilion," presumably belonging to Fengxia Valley.

The two went straight to Cloud Sea Pavilion. Inside, a waiter, upon seeing that Lin Changqing was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, immediately stepped forward to usher him upstairs.

Walking up the stairs to the second floor, the waiter paused and asked Lin Changqing, "Senior, would you prefer the second floor or the third floor?"

"I'll go to the third floor," Lin Changqing said, then pointed to Chu Ning, "This is one of my martial nephews; he wants to see if there's anything suitable at the auction on the second floor."

The waiter smiled, "Alright, Senior, please proceed upstairs. I'll take this fellow cultivator to find a room on the second floor right away!"

Chu Ning was slightly surprised at this moment. So, there was also a transaction on the third floor? He had always thought that the previous Cloud Sea Pavilion auction he attended was the main event of the day.

Lin Changqing turned back and glanced at Chu Ning. "The items auctioned on the second floor are useless to me. You go and look for yourself. If you find something suitable, bid on it, and wait for me downstairs after it's over."

"Yes, Martial Uncle," Chu Ning knew Lin Changqing usually spoke little, so he didn't ask further questions.

After Lin Changqing ascended to the third floor, the waiter extended a hand, gesturing for Chu Ning to follow. "This way, fellow cultivator, please."

Chu Ning followed him, simultaneously using his Qi-Observing Art to scan the man. He found that this person's cultivation was actually above his own, a late Qi Condensation stage cultivator.

"Even a mere waiter at Cloud Sea Pavilion is a late Qi Condensation disciple, and he didn't show the slightest hint of neglect despite seeing my low cultivation. This number one merchant association is indeed extraordinary."

As he thought this, he recalled Lin Changqing going to the third floor and couldn't help but ask, "Senior Brother, may I ask if the third floor is also an auction?"

The waiter turned his head to look at Chu Ning and explained, "Yes, the third floor hosts a smaller auction, open only to Foundation Establishment seniors. The items traded there will also be more advanced than those on the second floor."

Chu Ning nodded, then remembering that Foundation Establishment cultivators seemed to have participated in the auction of Seven-Star Spirit Fruits back in Qinghe Market, he asked confusedly,

"Are there no Foundation Establishment cultivators on the second floor?"

"There are some, but fewer," the waiter replied. "Most are late Qi Condensation and perfected Qi Condensation cultivators, but sometimes Foundation Establishment seniors will also come to the second floor to participate in the auction if they know there are specific items suitable for their use."

Chu Ning finally understood after hearing this. When the Seven-Star Spirit Fruits were auctioned in Qinghe Market, it must have been because those fruits also had some effect on Foundation Establishment body-refining cultivators, which is why they participated. After all, from what he later learned about body refinement, most body-refining cultivators nowadays no longer followed ancient cultivation methods like the Nine Evolutions Body Refinement Art. Instead, they used external force tempering methods. This meant their bottlenecks were not as difficult as Chu Ning's direct cultivation of the Nine Evolutions Body Refinement Art, which is why the Seven-Star Spirit Fruits were also effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators.

After these thoughts circulated in Chu Ning's mind, the waiter had already led him to the room with the number twenty-two sign.
