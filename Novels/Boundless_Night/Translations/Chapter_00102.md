**Chapter 102: The Great Pioneering Era**

Qin Ming was training his spirit sparrow, not yet having transferred Tang Xumi's conscious spiritual light into the fiery red bird. He planned to "arrange" that once they entered the Spirit Cave.

"You still have the mood to play with birds?" Meng Xinghai arrived, surprised to find Qin Ming so leisurely.

"I'm emulating the ancients; maintain composure when facing great matters," Qin Ming replied.

Meng Xinghai reminded him, "Tonight, you must be careful. Only those competing can stay in Luofu Immortal Town; the rest of us outsiders must remain outside."

Qin Ming's expression turned solemn. "Surely no one from the Outer Realm Disciples will make a move within the town, right?"

"Normally, they wouldn't dare," Meng Xinghai said, "but one must guard against the unexpected."

"I'm probably the lowest-ranked among those in Luofu Immortal Town, aren't I? I really do need to be vigilant," Qin Ming mused, gripping his mutton-fat jade iron blade.

"It's fine, let Qingyue protect you," Meng Xinghai said with a smile.

Qin Ming didn't want to dwell on that, instead asking, "Uncle Meng, among Qingyue's competitors and those Golden Guards, are there any formidable individuals worth special attention?"

"The core disciples vying for this spot should all have stepped into the second realm, Yellow Court, though most are newly ascended," Meng Xinghai informed him, adding that Qin Ming needn't worry about these people, as Li Qingyue could handle them herself.

Qin Ming sighed. "Look at their realm names, 'Heart Fasting,' 'Yellow Court'—all drawing from classics and having origins. Then look at our path; who came up with our realm names?"

Meng Xinghai explained, "Our names were coined based on practical circumstances during the great upheaval of those years."

"Pragmatic!" Qin Ming could only praise the ancestors of their path in this way.

Meng Xinghai sighed, "In the early years, after the sun vanished, fire springs appeared, giant beasts ran rampant, and dangerous, mysterious plants were everywhere. Our race was nearly wiped out. During that period, the sages who forged the New Life path made immense contributions. Back then, they relied on constantly mutating their bodies to fight giant beasts and eradicate countless terrifying plants."

Thus, the name "New Life" indeed held great significance, representing the rebirth of the entire race during that era.

"As for the term 'Outer Saint,' it was certainly fitting for that time. After multiple 'New Life' transformations, people reached a critical point where heaven-light began to manifest outside their bodies. They were no longer so passive and powerless when confronting strange, powerful beasts, and could even kill unknown creatures, sever mountain-sized terrifying plants, and protect a region. They truly deserved the title of 'Saint.'"

Therefore, "Outer Saint" was a common appellation for a long time.

All changes came about with the emergence of ancient cultivation methods.

As humanity gained a firm foothold, various religious scriptures and ancient texts were rediscovered, gradually giving rise to the Outer Realm Disciples and experts from secret sects.

From then on, the term "Outer Saint" gradually became less presentable, and was even ridiculed as "Outer Nephew" (a pun in Chinese, `外圣 wàishèng` vs. `外甥 wàishēng`).

Most of the time, people referred to it as "External Manifestation," which suited the state of heaven-light emitting outwards.

"Were all those highly dangerous monsters, mountain-sized plants, unidentifiable creatures, and unpredictable 'quasi-deities' eradicated?" Qin Ming was quite interested in that period.

Unfortunately, little was recorded about them in ancient texts.

Meng Xinghai shook his head. "How could they be completely eradicated? You wouldn't think the Night Fog World we hear of now is all there is, would you? It's merely a corner that we've opened up."

"Just a corner?" Qin Ming was truly astonished. Even after regaining his memories, he knew nothing of this; no one at the Cui family had ever discussed such topics with him.

Most importantly, the upper echelons seemed to intentionally conceal the truth of the world; records in various documents were very vague.

Meng Xinghai nodded. "The night fog is boundless, the dark realm endless. We have no idea how vast it truly is. Although we've stabilized and seem to have the upper hand, our knowledge of the deeper parts of the Night Fog World is limited, and we've temporarily ceased further expansion. If we were to continue fighting and advancing, it's hard to say what kind of species we'd encounter. No one knows what terrifying beings lie ahead; there might even be near-godlike creatures."

He continued, "We are fortunate to live in this era, as we have already developed and grown strong, temporarily holding the initiative. However, as the population expands, high-grade fire springs become insufficient, and giant cities require expansion. At that point, a Great Reclamation will likely be necessary. When that time comes, don't be surprised by any bizarre species or strange phenomena you encounter. It's even possible to glimpse certain kingdoms deep within the Night Fog World."

"Great Reclamation, Great Pioneering Era..." Qin Ming murmured. Such titles, upon first hearing, could stir the blood of a youth, making them yearn to participate in such grand events.

Clearly, against such a grand backdrop, many extraordinary individuals would rise, rapidly growing into pillars of strength on their respective paths.

Undoubtedly, that would be an era of heroes and dazzling stars.

However, a realistic thought revealed that once a Great Reclamation war was re-launched, and the Great Pioneering Era returned, many would inevitably die.

Glory, splendor, blood... many imaginable scenes would accompany the rise of powerful individuals, making the era richer and more profound. But, many youthful dreams would also shatter, becoming insignificant white bones on the path of the Great Reclamation and Great Pioneering Era.

Meng Xinghai said, "It's too early to mention these things now, and the upper echelons won't openly discuss them, as they are extremely cautious. After all, no one knows what lies deep within the vast Night Fog World. So many years have passed, yet we still haven't figured it out."

The two ended the topic and discussed the immediate practical issues.

"Each core disciple can bring four Golden Guards into the arena. Indeed, there are some formidable individuals among them, such as Tan Yu from Falling Moon City, who is rumored to have fused over ten types of Heaven-Light Force during the New Life stage."

"Over ten types." Qin Ming calculated that he had already mastered over a dozen, many of which were powerful composite force techniques.

Moreover, the integration of two unique profound arts had caused his Heaven-Light Force to undergo a fierce transformation.

He pondered that his raw strength might not match theirs, as his realm was still low, but with the augmentation of Heaven-Light Force, he should be able to contend with some of them.

"A young man named Chen Shuhang has mastered the Five-Colored Thunderfire Force, a renowned technique of immense power that can harm Outer Realm Disciples of the same rank," Meng Xinghai pointed out another dangerous individual.

Then, his expression turned serious. "Furthermore, some say that a registered disciple from that ancient orthodoxy, which has been sealed for two hundred years, has emerged."

"What kind of lineage? Is it very powerful?" Qin Ming asked in surprise.

Meng Xinghai gravely replied, "They wield the Jade Clarity Force, which is unfathomable and should be no weaker than the Heaven-Propping Force and Tathagata Force. It's a reclusive sect, quite low-key."

He immediately added, "Fortunately, he's only a registered disciple, so he shouldn't have learned the true Jade Clarity Force yet."

Meng Xinghai took a sip of tea. "Hmm, there's a rumor that someone from the reclusive Five Elements Palace has also appeared; a young man has been invited to assist. If he has truly mastered the Five Elements Force, then he would indeed be extremely troublesome, considered quite formidable and dangerous among your generation."

Qin Ming said, "Why do I feel that these reclusive orthodoxies are becoming active? Is the era of great expansion for all sects approaching? Are the figures from the spirit mountains shrouded in night fog all descending?"

Meng Xinghai replied, "Although there is such a trend, this time it's mainly because the near-immortal object sought by the core Outer Realm Disciples is of great importance. It's like the Eight Immortals crossing the sea, each displaying their unique powers; everyone is inviting assistance, which is understandable."

Subsequently, he critiqued some other individuals, including the Abandoned Tathagata Disciple, Cui Chongxuan, and others who had mastered unusual Heaven-Light Force techniques.

Qin Ming assessed his opponents based on what he heard.

Meng Xinghai told him to relax. "Don't feel pressured; you don't need to make a move. Moreover, apart from a small handful of specially invited individuals, the actual Golden Guards' strength is quite average."

According to him, this age group was when youths were full of vigor and ambition; who would willingly become a follower?
Comparatively, the Outer Saints who appeared here were forced choices for those who were confused about their future path or saw no hope.

"Except for a few who temporarily came to assist, the truly exceptional talents are participating in the annual grand examination; they won't abandon their prospects at this stage."

Meng Xinghai sighed softly. "Years from now, some of these talented individuals participating in the grand examination will join the Outer Realm, becoming Jade Guards. Even more powerful individuals will have to endure more years before finally becoming Divine Guards."

Qin Ming was utterly speechless. So, everyone on this path ultimately becomes someone else's follower? The more powerful one was, the later they compromised, but they would ultimately have to accept the cruel reality.

"Unless you can still rapidly break through after reaching major realms like External Manifestation and Spiritual Field, otherwise, enduring ten years of arduous cultivation just to advance a small step—can you bear it?"

"There should be a way," Qin Ming mused, realizing that the Hegemon's strength growth wasn't slow.

Meng Xinghai departed; he could not stay long in Luofu Immortal Town.

Li Qingyue returned after receiving guidance from her sect elders.

"Only those competing are left in town. Tonight might not be peaceful," Qin Ming said.

"They wouldn't dare raid us. You can sleep in the room next to mine," Li Qingyue said with a faint smile, exuding confidence.

As one of the popular figures in this competition, she was very confident.

She had already retrieved a golden armor for Qin Ming and introduced him to three others: two men and one woman who had followed her for over a year.

Apart from Qin Ming, Li Qingyue had not invited anyone else to assist her, only bringing her three original Golden Guards.

"Let's go for a walk," she suggested.

Qin Ming was surprised. "At this critical juncture, we're going outside? Shouldn't we be more low-key?"

Li Qingyue, dressed in white with lustrous black hair and a flawless, radiant face, like a divine flower blooming against the cold wind in snow, fresh and brilliant, smiled faintly. "They should be afraid of me, not the other way around. If I didn't have this confidence and backing, I wouldn't be here to compete for that legendary item."

"Alright!" Qin Ming stood up and walked out with her.

It was evening now, and the twilight glow dyed the night fog red. The fire springs of Luofu Immortal Town flowed slowly, creating a distinction between day and night here.

Luofu Immortal Town had many ancient ruins, all left from a thousand years ago.

Other core disciples also walked on the ancient streets, equally confident, surrounded by a group of people.

A group of Outer Realm Disciples quickly gathered around Li Qingyue.

Soon, Qin Ming realized that these Outer Realm Disciples revolved around Li Qingyue. Once inside the Spirit Cave, they would all proactively help her.

This was the nature of a core disciple: having enough prestige that other disciples, who felt their own chances were slim, would naturally gravitate towards them.

In fact, these individuals had privately contacted Li Qingyue long ago and were considered her future foundation in the Outer Realm.

This was a mutually beneficial arrangement; these Outer Realm Disciples knew their own limits and naturally chose to attach themselves to an outstanding individual destined to rise early on.

Cui Chonghe had already left the ancient town; he was not permitted to stay overnight.

His junior disciple, a disciple of one of his teachers, appeared. This junior had exceptional talent, and with the aid of Cui Chonghe's Great Yin-Yang Medicine, his strength had increased significantly.

At this moment, Cui Chongxuan and the carefully selected Cui family Golden Guards all stood beside that young man.

Qin Ming realized that all the capable core disciples had come out to "flex their muscles," giving confidence to the Outer Realm Disciples who relied on them.

Indeed, he then saw Li Qingxu, and what caught his attention was the golden-armored youth holding a great pike beside Li Qingxu.

Qin Ming's heart immediately stirred. Could it be that Li Qingxu's teacher had passed on the Hegemon's inheritance to this Golden Guard of his lineage?

"The Hegemon's inheritance, while not difficult to cultivate in the early stages, can they truly comprehend its profound meaning? It's meant for realms beyond the Spiritual Field!" Qin Ming wondered inwardly.

Many Outer Realm Disciples also followed Li Qingxu.

Afterwards, Qin Ming saw some familiar faces from the Outer Realm, such as Lu Zhenyi, Chen Bingyan, and others. They seemed to be banding together for mutual support.

Wang Caiwei also appeared. As before, her figure was graceful and slender, her black hair fluttering, quite radiant and always smiling. She was also accompanied by some people, including four formidable young experts specifically invited by the Wang family for her, all having cultivated strange Heaven-Light Force techniques with astonishing legacies.

"Brother Li!" The core disciple Tang Xumi greeted him with a simple, honest smile. He also had many followers.

Qin Ming flashed his pearly white teeth, returning a brilliant smile. He thought to himself, *You 'bird-playing' youth, you're really not honest; you're still pretending to be simple now.*

Core disciples appeared one after another; Qin Ming only recognized a few.

"Li Qingxu, aren't some of your Golden Guards your cousins? Is that Li Qingxiao there? I heard he got kicked in the butt and cried recently?"

It had to be said that even among the Outer Realm, the core disciples were a diverse bunch. Someone was already proactively stirring up trouble, making fun of Li Qingxu.

Moreover, the one who spoke was a young girl.

"Luo Qingge, you really can't hold back, can you? Do you want to fight me now?" Li Qingxu looked at her; she was his "nemesis."

At the same time, he murmured to himself, "The one who bullied my cousin was someone I crippled with three strikes back then. It seems he's recovering... somewhat unexpected."

Li Qingyue suddenly spoke. "Li Qingxu, with me here, you won't get the near-immortal object. The person you attacked back then is an old acquaintance of mine. More than two years have passed; it's time to settle that score. See you in the Spirit Cave!"
