# Chapter 150: The Lingering Might of Tianxuan

Bai Yue and the other two demon kings, each comparable to late-stage Golden Core cultivators, weren't intimidated by the eight Golden Core auras. However, upon hearing Tianxuan's familiar voice, memories of Tianxuan Patriarch surfaced in their minds.

"To fight or retreat—what is your intention?" 

Amidst the thunderous voice, the Yin-Yang Qi suddenly struck towards the White Wolf Demon King. 

Bai Yue erupted with savage demonic power, manifesting the Heavenly Wolf Dharma Form. Two massive wolf claws materialized, radiating intense white light. 

The divine light formed by the Yin-Yang Qi collided head-on with the Heavenly Wolf Dharma Form without hesitation.

Boom!

The black-and-white Yin-Yang Divine Light exploded instantaneously, releasing a profound and terrifying aura. Cracks appeared on the Heavenly Wolf Dharma Form under its assault.

The Yin-Yang Divine Light could shatter all techniques!

"Retreat!"

Bai Yue recalled witnessing Jingyang Zhenren sweeping through the demon race with the Yin-Yang Divine Light during his childhood. 

It truly was the Yin-Yang Divine Light!

Boundless terror filled his heart. 

The colossal Heavenly Wolf Dharma Form, now bereft of Bai Yue's demonic power, rapidly disintegrated under the impact of the divine light.

A thousand miles away, having confirmed they weren't being pursued by Tianxuan Patriarch, the three demon kings halted their escape.

Black Eagle King sneered, "Bai Yue, Tianxuan Patriarch is clearly at the end of his rope. If we demons united, we might not need to fear him."

"Black Eagle, that was the Yin-Yang Divine Light. Even if Tianxuan appears weakened, on the verge of death, he could still drag a couple of us down with him. Aren't you afraid you might be one of them?" the Ink Dragon King retorted coldly.

He vividly remembered how the former Dragon King of Ink Dragon Palace, once a dominant force commanding a hundred thousand water demons and just half a step away from becoming a Nascent Soul-level supreme demon, had been crippled by Jingyang Zhenren's Yin-Yang Divine Light.

Bai Yue added, "The aura of the Divine Thunder True Method is unmistakable—it was indeed the Yin-Yang Divine Light. Otherwise, my Heavenly Wolf Dharma Form wouldn't have been shattered instantly. However, that flying sword treasure is unfamiliar... Black Eagle isn't entirely wrong. Tianxuan did seem like a spent force, not as formidable as before..."

Though initially panicked, upon reflection after fleeing, Bai Yue sensed something amiss. Yet, how could the Yin-Yang Divine Light and the aura of the Divine Thunder True Method be faked?

---

The Ink Dragon King solemnly said, "Humans are cunning. Tianxuan feigned weakness to prevent our escape, likely intending to coordinate with others to annihilate us..."

His words struck a chord with Bai Yue and the others. Tianxuan, nearing the end of his lifespan, might very well seek to take them down with him.

Even if Tianxuan's power seemed diminished, the three demon kings dared not gamble. The stakes were too high—losing meant certain death. 

A single late-stage Golden Core human cultivator's self-detonation could obliterate at least one of them. What more Tianxuan Patriarch?

Even if they won, they'd still face numerous human Golden Core cultivators. Moreover, mobilizing the demon race's full strength was no easy feat. 

Demons excelled in opportunistic battles but were quick to flee when the tide turned. Strategic retreats were their modus operandi.

After a moment's contemplation, Bai Yue burst into laughter.

Black Eagle King frowned, "Bai Yue, what's so amusing now?"

Bai Yue grinned, "I laugh at Tianxuan's lack of wisdom. Whether he's truly near death or feigning weakness to lure us in, we've already won!"

He exuded confidence.

"How so?" Black Eagle asked.

Bai Yue explained, "This encounter confirmed Tianxuan is still alive. Regardless, his intervention must have taken a toll. I doubt he can act freely now. Moreover, if he were truly on the verge of breaking through to Nascent Soul, he wouldn't have intervened. This proves he's abandoned his ascension and is nearing his end."

Black Eagle and Ink Dragon nodded in agreement.

Bai Yue continued, "Time is on our side. Tianxuan can't hold on much longer. Meanwhile, we'll rally more demons to harass the Four Great Demon Sects, keeping Tianxuan unsettled and hastening his demise."

The Four Great Demon Sects were scattered far from Tianxuan City, much farther than Desolate Ridge. 

But the three demon kings wouldn't risk another confrontation—what if they couldn't escape next time?

Bai Yue's underlying message was clear: use this pretext to pit rival demon factions against the humans, weakening both sides. 

With their alliance growing stronger, the three demon kings aimed to eliminate competitors, including two other late-stage Golden Core demon kings at odds with them.

Yuan Mingyue, though weary, couldn't hide her excitement. "Master, based on this, the Divine Water Palace might be a Spirit Treasure."

"A Spirit Treasure?" Zhou Qing was astonished.

When a magic treasure's divine restrictions reached the ninth layer, they could unify into a Spirit Treasure. Most Golden Core cultivators' treasures had only one divine restriction, though a natal treasure counted as an additional layer.

"Perhaps not a Spirit Treasure, but at least a treasure modeled after one, with no fewer than seven divine restrictions," Yuan Mingyue said, her fatigue overshadowed by joy.

Each breakthrough was like consuming a spiritual pill for her, enhancing her divine sense. 

As her cultivation grew, her innate talent for formations unlocked previously unknown insights, deepening her understanding.

Formations, intertwined with natural laws and cosmic principles, were among the most demanding arts in cultivation.

Yet, every resurgence of the Southern Barren humans had involved formation masters.

"Additionally, through the Black Water Divine Stele and the Divine Water Palace map, I've noticed that while the formations of the Water Mansion and the Divine Water Palace differ vastly, they seem to share the same lineage."

"And how does that relate to the 'Formation Foundations' manual?"

"The underlying principles align."

To Yuan Mingyue, the manual was the seed, the Water Mansion the sapling, and the Divine Water Palace the fully grown tree.

"The Divine Water Palace, the Water Mansion, and the Mortal Realm... The Mortal Realm's heavenly law revolves around frost, which connects to water. Since I began my cultivation there, it seems the Divine Water Palace is indeed fated for me," Zhou Qing mused.

Working together, they activated the Black Water Divine Stele's latent power, re-establishing its connection to the Divine Water Palace.

Suddenly struck by inspiration, Zhou Qing suppressed his aura to the Foundation Establishment perfection stage. Wrapping Yuan Mingyue and the stele fragment in his divine sense, they vanished from the Water Mansion in a flash of light.

---

Divine Water Palace.

Zhou Qing stored the stele fragment in his inner world. The surroundings were unfamiliar, yet the aura felt familiar.

"This is the Divine Water Palace, deeper than before."

Consulting the palace's map in his mind, he deduced they were close to its core—the Divine Water Hall.

"Stay close, Mingyue. Don't be afraid."

He had brought his disciple to broaden her horizons and study the formations, combining her insights with his divine sense and Truth-Discerning Eyes to decipher them.

Surprisingly, his "Thousand Illusions" technique had deceived the palace's restrictive rules—originally barring Golden Core entities from entering.

---

This was an intangible form of plunder, sustainable and self-perpetuating.

With resources flowing from Tianxuan City and the Four Great Demon Sects, the Dao Court would flourish like a sapling nourished by fertilizer.

Moreover, Zhou Qing could refine Jade Marrow Revival Pills. Once the Dao Court amassed enough resources, it could continuously nurture Golden Core cultivators.

Time was his ally—the longer they had, the stronger they'd become.

This virtuous cycle hinged on withstanding the demon threat, especially the impending crisis when the Lunar Howl Monster broke free in eighty to ninety years.

The ultimate challenge rested on Zhou Qing's growth and whether he could extend Tianxuan Patriarch's lifespan, enabling a Nascent Soul breakthrough.

For now, Zhou Qing could impersonate Tianxuan Patriarch using Thousand Illusions. Over time, his portrayal would grow more convincing.

The advantage was his.

---

Meanwhile, Bai Yue and the other demon kings expanded their alliance during the beast tide, absorbing other demons.

Though they learned of the Four Great Demon Sects relocating near Tianxuan City, Bai Yue remained unfazed.

"With each passing day, Tianxuan nears death, while our patriarch's release draws closer," Bai Yue declared. "No matter what, our demon kings far outnumber the human Golden Core cultivators. The advantage is ours!"

Failing to eliminate Qinglingzi as instructed, Bai Yue focused on strengthening the alliance. After all, their patriarch had said: if Qinglingzi couldn't be dealt with now, his death would come once the patriarch was free.

---

Despite the ongoing beast tide, news of Tianxuan Patriarch repelling the three demon kings bolstered morale in Tianxuan City and Desolate Ridge.

As the guardian of Tianxuan City for centuries, Tianxuan Patriarch was a revered figure among the humans of Jingyang Dao Domain, his prestige far surpassing Qinglingzi's.

His intervention dispelled rumors of his demise.

"When a late-stage Golden Core cultivator returns his Dao to heaven, the celestial phenomena would be earth-shattering and impossible to conceal. Claims of his death are mere demon-spread lies," the cultivators debated during lulls in battle.

"I sense the resurgence of our race. Qinglingzi, Golden Light, Xiao Jing... It's been ages since so many Golden Core cultivators emerged in such a short time."

"Did you know? Aside from the Solar Rooster Deity, Qinglingzi has another mysterious Golden Core subordinate."

"Rumors say it's his Dao companion."

"A Dao companion?"

"Possible. According to the Jin family, that figure's aura is yin-aligned, with an air of longevity..."

"Wrong. The Flaming Sun Demon Sect claims Qinglingzi's Dao companion might be a spirit cultivator."

The crowd gasped.

"A spirit cultivator? That's terrifying."

"Only a Golden Core spirit cultivator could evade detection by other Golden Core experts."

"But spirit cultivators are half-human, half-ghost. Does that mean...?"

The implications were chilling. The discussion halted as another beast tide approached.

---

Water Mansion.

Zhou Qing meticulously carved array patterns onto the hide of a Thunderbull Demon King with his Green Bamboo Sword, preparing it to channel Divine Thunder Heavenly Light talismans.

The bull, possessing a trace of Kui Bull lineage and thunder affinity, was ideal for crafting such talismans.

"Thankfully, Jingyang Dao Domain has ample thunderstorms. In a few years, I can produce a hundred Divine Thunder Heavenly Light talismans." With his current divine sense, Zhou Qing could activate all hundred simultaneously, weaving a net of heavenly lightning potent enough to trouble even late-stage Golden Core demons.

Powerful divine sense paired with expendable talismans made for an elite-slaying strategy.

Golden Core demons were treasure troves—victory would offset any losses.

Now afflicted with "wealth sickness," Zhou Qing only fought battles where the odds favored him.

While he worked, Yuan Mingyue studied the Black Water Divine Stele's secrets, most of which Zhou Qing had already deciphered.

The remaining challenge was pinpointing the Divine Water Palace's location and activating the stele's connection before the hundred-year cycle.

Zhou Qing's divine sense functioned like a supercomputer. When Yuan Mingyue hit a snag, his overwhelming intellect pushed through, solving problems with remarkable efficiency.

"Master, it seems the Divine Water Palace might be a Spirit Treasure."

"A Spirit Treasure?" Zhou Qing was taken aback.
