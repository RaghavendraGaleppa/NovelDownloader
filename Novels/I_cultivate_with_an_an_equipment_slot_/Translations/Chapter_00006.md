# Chapter 6: Spells and Divine Abilities

Zhang Yan carefully examined the light screen before him. It displayed various spell courses—Rain Summoning, Fire Serpent, Flame Control—everything one could imagine.

"I can only learn two spells. Which ones should I choose?" Zhang Yan frowned slightly. Opportunities to learn spells were rare for him. Once he used up these two free chances, further improvement would require spending spirit stones or contribution points. Thus, these two spells were crucial for him at this stage.

"My cultivation is still low, and my strength is weak. Since I'm staying within the sect and don't have any missions outside yet, I don't need combat-oriented spells right now. Instead, I need spells that can help me earn spirit stones and contribution points—preferably ones that can generate income quickly."

With this in mind, Zhang Yan made his decision. He would learn the spells required for a spirit plant cultivator. As for why he didn't choose alchemy-related spells, the reason was simple.

Refining a single batch of pills required many materials, which often cost a significant number of spirit stones. Even a moderately skilled alchemist couldn't guarantee success every time. Moreover, he would also need pill recipes—something he didn't have. How could he refine pills without them? 

Even if he somehow obtained the recipes and succeeded, how would he explain his sudden proficiency? After all, alchemy wasn't something one could master without proper guidance. Impossible. Absolutely impossible!

For now, the best course of action was to start as a spirit plant cultivator. He would slowly accumulate spirit stones, build a foundation, and only then venture into alchemy. That was the proper way forward.

For spirit plant cultivators, the two most important spells were those that accelerated plant growth and those that eliminated pests. Thus, Zhang Yan decided to learn these two types.

Among growth-enhancing spells, there were many options, such as Wood Essence Art and Rain Summoning. However, since Zhang Yan primarily cultivated the Evergreen Technique, the Wood Essence Art was more suitable. When cast, this spell released vast amounts of pure wood essence energy to stimulate plant growth.

As for pest control, after careful consideration, he settled on the Golden Grass-Cutting Sword. This was a wood- and metal-element spell. Given that Zhang Yan's spiritual roots were aligned with metal, wood, and water, this spell was perfect for him.

Having decided on the two spells, Zhang Yan turned his attention to the available courses.

"The Wood Essence Art starts the soonest—in just half a shichen (one hour). The Golden Grass-Cutting Sword, however, won't begin for another three days." 

After noting the information, Zhang Yan took out his jade token and registered for the courses. 

"Why does this feel like signing up for university classes?" Shaking off this strange thought, he marked the Wood Essence Art and Golden Grass-Cutting Sword courses. This registration didn't count against his free learning quota since he was only attending trial lectures.

Since the Wood Essence Art class was about to start, Zhang Yan waited at the Enlightenment Peak. To pass the time, he grabbed a bite to eat nearby.

"These people are absolute vampires! A simple meal costs one contribution point! This is daylight robbery!" Zhang Yan grumbled in frustration but had no choice. He should have brought his own food.

Soon, the Wood Essence Art lecture began. With his jade token, Zhang Yan entered the Enlightenment Hall. The moment he stepped inside, he was struck by a sense of awe. From the outside, the hall appeared modest in size, but inside, the space was unexpectedly vast.

"Is this a spatial expansion technique? Like a storage pouch?"

Following the directions, he soon arrived at a chamber. Inside, there was a raised platform resembling a lectern, with meditation cushions arranged below. Since he had arrived early, the room was still sparsely populated.

As soon as Zhang Yan entered, his attention was drawn to the cushions.

**[Name]:** Enlightenment Cushion  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Effect]:** Slightly increases comprehension; beginner-level Wood Essence Art mastery.

"Huh?" Zhang Yan's eyes widened in surprise. He hadn't expected these cushions to be magical artifacts as well!

"If that's the case… then…" 

His mind racing, Zhang Yan quickly scanned the other cushions.

**[Name]:** Enlightenment Cushion  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Effect]:** Slightly increases comprehension; intermediate-level Wood Essence Art mastery.

"There are even cushions for intermediate mastery!" 

Excited, Zhang Yan began inspecting the remaining cushions. While the slight comprehension boost was consistent across all cushions, the Wood Essence Art mastery levels varied.

Suddenly, his eyes lit up as he spotted an exceptional cushion. Though it looked somewhat worn, its effect was remarkable.

**[Name]:** Enlightenment Cushion  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Effect]:** Slightly increases comprehension; advanced-level Wood Essence Art mastery.

"Advanced mastery!"

Instinctively, Zhang Yan moved toward it—only for a fair-skinned, delicate-looking young woman in Taoist robes to sit on it first.

"Damn it…" 

Zhang Yan scratched his head in frustration. He desperately wanted that cushion, but he couldn't just shove the girl away. Reluctantly, he settled for the cushion next to hers. At least this one wasn't bad either.

Noticing Zhang Yan sitting beside her, the young woman—who appeared around his age—wrinkled her nose slightly but said nothing.

As more disciples filed in, the lecture hall grew livelier. The attendees were a diverse mix—men and women, young and old.

Before long, a middle-aged man strode in and took his seat on the highest cushion. Undoubtedly, this was the Wood Essence Art instructor.

"I am Lin Sen, your instructor for the Wood Essence Art. Let's skip the pleasantries. I see many new disciples here today, so I'll start by explaining the fundamentals of spellcasting."

Lin Sen swept his gaze across the room before continuing, "As you all know, spells are essential for us cultivators. Not only do they aid in cultivation and self-defense, but they're also necessary for securing resources."

"More importantly, if you don't master a spell to perfection during the Qi Refining stage, you'll never grasp divine abilities after Foundation Establishment."

"Divine abilities!" 

Zhang Yan's eyes gleamed with interest. He had heard of divine abilities before—they were said to be a cultivator's greatest trump card in battle after Foundation Establishment, surpassing even some magical artifacts. What's more, divine abilities could grow alongside the cultivator.

He had always assumed divine abilities were something one acquired after Foundation Establishment. Yet now, he learned they required perfecting spells during the Qi Refining stage!

"What? We need to master spells to perfection?" 

The crowd erupted in murmurs. Mastering spells was no easier than advancing one's cultivation realm—if not harder. It demanded exceptional comprehension. Achieving perfection in the Qi Refining stage was an immense challenge!
