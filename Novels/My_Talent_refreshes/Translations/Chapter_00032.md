# Chapter 32: Ten Thousand Sheets of Talisman Paper  

The next day, as Chu Ning had anticipated, Zhuang Yunde appeared punctually outside his courtyard.  

"Junior Brother Chu, I've come to collect the Dark Spirit Bamboo."  

"Senior Brother Zhuang, please come in!"  

Chu Ning led him into the courtyard to where he had stacked the bamboo.  

Seeing the neatly arranged Dark Spirit Bamboo, Zhuang Yunde's smile widened.  

"It seems you've already separated the portion to be submitted to the sect. To cultivate such high-quality Dark Spirit Bamboo in your first year—Junior Brother truly has a talent for spiritual plant cultivation."  

Zhuang Yunde's smile was genuine. After all, as he looked at the pile of bamboo, he could already envision the additional ten percent that would soon line his own pockets.  

Chu Ning, well aware of the thoughts behind that smile, seized the opportunity to broach his idea while the man was in high spirits.  

"Senior Brother Zhuang, I was wondering if the sect allows flexibility in how we submit our harvest—for example, submitting talisman paper instead of the bamboo itself."  

"Hmm?" Zhuang Yunde's cheerful expression faltered as he stared at Chu Ning in surprise.  

"What do you mean, Junior Brother? Are you suggesting you want to process all this bamboo into talisman paper before submitting it?"  

Chu Ning nodded slightly. "Exactly."  

Knowing Zhuang Yunde would ask for an explanation, he had already prepared his reasoning.  

"To be honest, I'd like to try my hand at making talisman paper. However, if I only use the small portion of bamboo I'm allowed to keep, accounting for practice and waste, I'd barely produce any usable paper. But if I could use all this bamboo, it would be a different story. Practice makes perfect—I'm confident that with more experience, my success rate would improve significantly."  

Zhuang Yunde immediately grasped Chu Ning's intent: he wanted to offset the initial losses by increasing production volume. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke seriously.  

"Your idea has merit, Junior Brother. But it hinges on whether you can truly master talisman paper production and deliver the required amount. The sect won't account for failures. If you can't submit enough paper on time, the deficit will be deducted from next year's harvest—with at least a twenty percent penalty."  

Chu Ning's heart leapt at these words—this was a tacit approval. He knew his own capabilities, and Zhuang Yunde's concerns weren't an issue for him.  

Feigning hesitation, he furrowed his brow and bit his lip before finally nodding resolutely.  

"Senior Brother, I still want to try. If I don't take this chance, this season's harvest will have been for nothing."  

Seeing his determination, Zhuang Yunde didn't press further and began calculating.  

"Based on the bamboo you'd normally submit, the ideal yield would be about 5,000 sheets of talisman paper. However, even the Hundred Arts Hall accounts for a twenty to thirty percent loss rate. As a newcomer with such ambition, I might be able to petition the sect to accept seventy percent of the estimated yield."  

Chu Ning immediately expressed his gratitude. He knew Zhuang Yunde well enough to recognize that the man wouldn't make such an offer without confidence.  

He had already researched the market price for standard talisman paper—currently, one spirit stone could buy about fifty sheets. Of course, selling to the sect would fetch less, likely requiring fifty-five to sixty sheets per spirit stone. Still, if Zhuang Yunde succeeded, Chu Ning stood to gain nearly ten extra spirit stones.  

Not forgetting their earlier arrangement, Chu Ning casually asked, "Senior Brother, would you prefer the bamboo or the talisman paper?"  

Pleased that Chu Ning had broached the subject himself, Zhuang Yunde smiled.  

"My storage pouch has been rather full lately. Bamboo would be cumbersome, but talisman paper would be perfect."  

Chu Ning promptly assured him, "Rest assured, Senior Brother. I'll set aside 550 sheets for you first."  

Not only had Chu Ning honored their original agreement, but he'd even added an extra ten percent. Zhuang Yunde was thoroughly satisfied.  

"Don't worry, Junior Brother. I'll do my best to secure an extension for your submission deadline, so you can practice without pressure."  

With that, Zhuang Yunde took his leave.  

Once the man was gone, Chu Ning returned to his courtyard, his face breaking into a triumphant grin.  

Zhuang Yunde assumed that as a novice, Chu Ning would need extensive practice and suffer heavy losses. Little did he know that Chu Ning had already mastered talisman paper production—and with the added advantage of his Talisman Source Spiritual Body, his success rate far exceeded ordinary standards.  

This meant the actual yield from his bamboo would undoubtedly surpass eighty percent.  

---  

A day later, a message talisman from Zhuang Yunde arrived: the sect had approved Chu Ning's request to submit talisman paper at seventy percent of the estimated yield.  

With this settled, Chu Ning threw himself into production.  

His bamboo was divided into two batches. The first, originally intended for the sect, had received fewer applications of the Verdant Wood Spring Technique and contained more impurities, yielding less pulp.  

The second batch, reserved for his own use, was of higher purity and produced significantly more pulp—and thus more paper.  

After twenty days of relentless work, Chu Ning gazed at the stacks of talisman paper filling his room, his face alight with satisfaction.  

Despite occasional mishaps, his Talisman Source Spiritual Body ensured an astonishing success rate. The bamboo meant for the sect had yielded 4,800 sheets, while the higher-quality batch produced 6,000.  

In total, Chu Ning now possessed over ten thousand sheets of talisman paper!  

After deducting the 3,500 for the sect and 550 for Zhuang Yunde, he was left with 6,750 sheets—worth over a hundred low-grade spirit stones. Never before had he been so wealthy.  

Pulling out a spirit stone—one of the three he'd saved from Old Man Sun and the bandit—Chu Ning decided to indulge.  

He had always been too frugal to use them for cultivation, but now...  

**[Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art (Yellow Grade, Low Tier), Second Layer (198/900)]**  
**[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Immortal Skin (133/300)]**  

After checking his progress, Chu Ning closed his eyes and began circulating his energy, the spirit stone clutched in his hand.  

Though his Verdant Wood Eternal Spring Art's proficiency was only at 198, he could sense he was on the verge of breaking through to the fifth level of Qi Refining.  

If his intuition was correct, reaching 200 would propel him into the fifth layer.
