# Chapter 423: The Millet Dream Technique, The Pink Ice Cube's Dream

The First Sparrow God Tournament of the Qingyuan Sect concluded successfully.

The main reason was that the other three couldn't continue playing. Watching Little Li rest his head on the Ice Cube's flat stomach, all three wore the same resentful expression.

It felt even worse than losing money.

Elder Han He reminded them to remember to come to the Divine Weapon Peak, thus ending this pastime that sapped the will. Shang Wu was now in deep debt. Although Little Li didn't intend to make her pay it back, she had already lost her elder's salary.

If they kept playing, she'd be betting her underwear next.

The group wasn't complete, and Qin Yuzhi wasn't satisfied yet. She sighed reluctantly:

"I'll have to play in my dreams then."

"You can control your own dreams?"

Li Mo put away the mahjong tiles and asked curiously.

"It's just a minor skill. Don't underestimate me just because I'm at the Seventh Realm."

Qin Yuzhi twitched her nose, looking quite impressive:

"Memory is the root of dreams. The revival of the Cloud Dream Immortal is pervasive. To ensure I don't slack off even in my sleep, besides traveling through other people's dreams, I also invented this secret art."

"So, do you want to learn it?"

Li Mo was fine, just a little curious about this strange art.

It was mainly the Ice Cube who needed to learn it, to take precautions against the unforeseen.

"The mahjong debt is forgiven."

"Hmph, this secret art isn't easy to learn. But since you're sincerely asking, I'll teach you a thing or two."

Half a quarter-hour later.

The expression on the face of the Demon教主 (Demon Sect Master) went through several changes: 'Not bad, but you still need practice'; 'You have some talent, how are you not stumped by this?'; and finally, 'Who am I, where am I, what am I doing?'

She muttered to herself as she returned to her wing.

Li Mo stood up and looked at the sky. It was getting late, the sky was clear for miles, the moon was bright and the stars were sparse. The huge moon climbed halfway up the snow-capped mountains. It played with the snowflakes in the wind, making the night sky sprinkle with starlight.

Looking back, Ying Bing sat in the moonlight. Her downcast face was a mix of light and shadow in the moonlight. The pages of the book in her hands turned with a rustling sound, quiet and peaceful.

"The moonlight is beautiful tonight."

"It is very beautiful."

Ying Bing looked up, glanced at it, and nodded.

Li Mo smiled.

During the process of dual cultivation with the Ice Cube, the two had gradually developed a tacit understanding, such as 'The moonlight is beautiful.'

As everyone knows, when the moon is beautiful, the Grand Yin Divine Will is abundant, making it the best time for observation. Thus, this became a signal for requesting dual cultivation.

It seemed they hadn't observed the moon together...咳, observed the Grand Yin Divine Will for a while.

Cultivation requires persistence, how can we be so negligent!

"I'll wait for you in your room then."

"What are you doing in my room?"

"???"

Li Mo was stunned for a moment. Isn't it for dual cultivation?

Then he saw a mischievous curve at the corner of the Fairy Han's mouth, her eyes, tinged with moonlight, seeming to smile yet not smile.

"Today, I want to... study the Millet Dream Technique. Be good."

"Alright..."

Li Mo couldn't resist that word, but he still showed his disappointment at not being able to observe the Grand Yin Divine Will, and returned to his own room.

Well then, he still had many upper-forms and several extreme-forms to play.

Observing the Seven Orifices of the Divine, he could now accommodate one great sage divine ability.

The figure of the empty-nester Li, under the moonlight, stretched very long... very long...

Watching him go upstairs, Ying Bing pursed her lips and sat for a while before getting up.

Just as she opened the door to her boudoir, she heard the tossing and turning from across the hall again, feeling a bit helpless.

She gently closed the door.

By the moonlight, she took out the Millet Dream Technique book again. It read:

"What one thinks of in the day, one dreams of at night."

That's right, the Millet Dream Technique wasn't about making the dream whatever you wanted it to be. At least, at the Divine Observation Realm, you couldn't freely control your dreams, like Qin Yuzhi playing mahjong in her dreams.

You could only use a special method to establish a psychological suggestion for yourself.

To make certain thoughts take deep root, then enter the dream, so that to a certain extent, the dream would change due to those thoughts.

If Li Mo slept beside her...

---

What would her dream become?

"It's about time."

Ying Bing reviewed it once more, confirming that the method she had grasped was correct.

Then, she began to recall the scenes from her past life.

After her rebirth, all other memories were clear, except for those from the Void Realm, which were fuzzy and fragmented.

Besides the phrase 'the heart has a flaw,' she knew nothing else.

She wanted to know why she had failed.

And there was Ying Huang.

The last time the other party appeared in her dream, if she could control her own dreams, would there be some difference?

Thinking this, a wave of sleepiness washed over her.

Suddenly.

[System Alert: 29 days remaining until the system ranking.]

[This punishment is: Planting forty-nine strawberries.]

[To make the host feel shame and then be brave, relevant scenes are now being automatically broadcasted.]

"?"

The last image Ying Bing saw before falling asleep was...

Inside the mind of the gentlemanly Little Li!

...

That night, in the dream of the former Demon Sect Master.

"教主 (Sect Master) is truly amazing!"

"A set of Eighteen Arhats, such a hand is possible."

"Sect Master is mighty, your mahjong skills are divine!"

Amidst the flattery at the card table, Qin Yuzhi looked out the window. It was the Divine Summoning Sect in her memory. At this time, the Divine Summoning Sect held important positions, monitoring the world's weather and climate, managing the vast power of the populace.

A scene of prosperity.

"Master, I want to be as amazing as you in the future."

Qin Yuzhi turned her head and saw a five or six-year-old child, his eyes full of innocence and adoration for her.

This was one of her disciples.

"Si Ye, then you must work hard."

Qin Yuzhi smiled and patted his head, but her heart was filled with bitterness.

Bai Li Si Ye...

Is he now just a handful of yellow earth?

A dream she had never tired of for thousands of years, a dream that felt so real, sometimes even made her, the creator, unable to distinguish reality from illusion.

Now it began to collapse, scattering like sand in the wind.

This dream...

Came to an end when reality descended.

Qin Yuzhi sat on the throne, silently watching it all happen.

Then she let out a long, soft sigh. In the dream, she drifted away, wandering aimlessly in the brilliant, starry river of dreams. Each bubble was the dream of another member of the Qingyuan Sect.

This was her other secret art, Dream Roaming.

She could travel through the dreams of many people, even stepping into them.

Hmm?

Suddenly, Qin Yuzhi stopped in front of one particularly colorful bubble.

This bubble seemed condensed from moonlight, yet faintly carried a hint of pink.

"This is... Little Bing'er's dream?"

Qin Yuzhi blinked curiously, her low spirits suddenly piqued with interest.

Someone as serene and aloof as her.

What kind of dream would she have?
