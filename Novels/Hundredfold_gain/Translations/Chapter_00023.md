# Chapter 23: Qi Refinement Fourth Layer, Mastered Fireball Technique!

The grand hall fell into complete silence.

All eyes turned to the clear-eyed young man standing in the corner, expressions filled with utter astonishment.

No one had expected that after Qi Channer—a fourth-grade spiritual root genius—had taken the stage with her fourth-layer Qi Refinement cultivation, effectively intimidating everyone into giving up on competing for the inner sect spot, another person would stand up and openly declare their intention to challenge her.

Unlike the previous two second-layer Qi Refinement cultivators, this newcomer was unmistakably at the fourth layer. Moreover, judging by his appearance, he seemed to be around the same age as Qi Channer.

What was even more surprising was that nearly everyone found his face unfamiliar. Clearly, a true dark horse had emerged.

"This... can't be possible..."

At the front of the hall, the Transmission Elder stared at the young man, his face slightly frozen, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He had already assumed the inner sect spot was as good as secured for his granddaughter. Yet now, out of nowhere, this unfamiliar youth had appeared—also at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement—and was challenging her for the position.

No, not entirely unfamiliar... The elder's mind raced before suddenly recalling—wasn't this the young seedling he had personally met four years ago? He had even bestowed the Evergreen Art upon him.

Back then, the boy had just entered the main lineage as a mere mortal. Yet now, after only four years, he had reached mid-stage Qi Refinement and was competing for an inner sect spot?

How was this possible?

Meanwhile, Qi Channer turned her gaze toward Qi Chuan, her delicate face also showing astonishment.

She knew her own aptitude well.

Even with her talent, reaching her current level had taken five years of relentless effort, supplemented by the resources provided by her grandfather.

Thus, she found it hard to believe that another person of similar age had achieved the same cultivation level.

Could this person also have a fourth-grade spiritual root—or even higher?

Wait... this face seems familiar...

Staring at the young man's refined features, Qi Channer's eyes widened in shock as she vaguely recalled the events of four years ago.

Wasn't this... the young seedling from back then?

But... wasn't he supposed to have an eighth-grade spiritual root?!

"So impressive! Another genius..." Nearby, Qi Baicang turned to look at Qi Chuan, sighing in admiration.

But in the next moment, his eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets.

Wait—isn't that my descendant, A-Chuan?!

No wonder his voice sounded familiar earlier...

But... how could he possibly be at the fourth layer of Qi Refinement?

Qi Baicang's mind buzzed with confusion, completely unable to process the situation.

From another direction, Qi Li and Qi Huo also recognized Qi Chuan's face, their expressions shifting to shock and disbelief.

"That's Senior Brother Qi Chuan, who participated in the Spiritual Root Testing Ceremony with us and won the championship... He's already at the fourth layer? Terrifying... Is this the power of an eighth-grade spiritual root?"

At the same time, the clan leader Qi Wuyou and the other elders at the head of the hall stared at Qi Chuan in stunned silence.

Having already known that Qi Channer had reached the fourth layer—effectively securing the inner sect spot—their attention had been mostly fixed on her.

Yet none of them had anticipated that another contender would emerge, one who could rival Qi Channer despite her fourth-grade spiritual root.

And what was more shocking—he had reached the fourth layer at the same age!

Cultivators possessed extraordinary memories, and as clan leaders or elders, they naturally had at least some familiarity with every member of the main lineage, which numbered barely over a hundred.

Soon, they recalled Qi Chuan's basic details: he had entered the main lineage four years ago during the Spiritual Root Testing Ceremony and was indeed fourteen years old now.

But that meant he had achieved this level of cultivation in just four years?

This...

Realizing this, Clan Leader Qi Wuyou and many of the elders turned their questioning gazes toward the Transmission Elder.

"Lower eighth-grade spiritual root..."

Sensing their unspoken inquiry, the Transmission Elder—who was naturally well-informed about such matters—answered with a complicated expression.

An eighth-grade spiritual root... yet reaching the fourth layer in just four years?

The elders exchanged glances, their eyes filled with shock.

How was this possible?

Even if he were exceptionally suited to the Evergreen Art, it shouldn't be this extreme. At best, he might progress slightly faster—but not to this absurd degree.

Could he possess some special bloodline or unique physique?

Regardless, Qi Chuan's achievements spoke for themselves. At his age and cultivation level, he undoubtedly had the qualifications to compete for the inner sect spot.

Thus, the elders all turned to Clan Leader Qi Wuyou, awaiting his decision.

Qi Wuyou observed the two youths in the hall: Qi Channer was clenching her fists nervously, while Qi Chuan remained composed.

As clan leader, he was inwardly pleased to see two such talented cultivators emerge simultaneously.

However, the actual decision weighed heavily on him.

In terms of age and cultivation, both were fourteen years old and at the fourth layer of Qi Refinement—equally matched.

But Qi Channer had the advantage of her fourth-grade spiritual root, far surpassing Qi Chuan's eighth-grade one, suggesting greater potential.

On the other hand, Qi Chuan had started cultivating a year later—beginning at age ten—whereas Qi Channer had been tested early by the Transmission Elder and entered the main lineage at nine.

From this perspective, Qi Chuan's four-year ascent to the fourth layer was even more impressive than Qi Channer's five-year journey.

"Hmm... What do the elders think?" After some hesitation, Qi Wuyou turned to the council, seeking their opinions first.

"This..."

The elders exchanged glances, equally conflicted.

"My granddaughter has a fourth-grade spiritual root—that should be the deciding factor..." the Transmission Elder spoke up hesitantly, still advocating for his descendant.

"But don't forget—Qi Chuan reached the fourth layer in just four years!" countered the Exchange Hall Elder.

At this, the Transmission Elder fell silent, unable to refute the point. Finally, he bowed slightly. "Then let the clan leader decide."

"Clan Leader, esteemed elders, there's no need for difficulty."

Just as the clan leader and elders were struggling to reach a consensus, Qi Chuan's voice rang out in the hall.

They turned to see him smiling faintly as he spoke: "I believe the choice should be me."

Hearing this, some of the elders frowned slightly.

With the clan leader still deliberating, Qi Chuan's direct assertion could be seen as lacking proper decorum.

"Why?"

Qi Channer immediately turned to glare at Qi Chuan, her eyes burning with defiance. The inner sect spot was far too important for her to concede easily—especially when she was fully confident in her own qualifications.

For her to willingly yield, Qi Chuan would need to present undeniable proof of superiority.

"Because... of this."

In response, Qi Chuan smiled faintly. His strength wasn't limited to just his cultivation level.

With a single-handed seal and a nearly imperceptible murmur, he raised his left palm. Mana surged forth, rapidly coalescing into a crimson fireball.

The Fireball Technique!

However, the fireball that took shape was larger than a fist, its dark flames flickering ominously as intense heat radiated outward, distorting the surrounding air.

This was... a mastered Fireball Technique!

In an instant, the entire hall seemed to hold its breath.
