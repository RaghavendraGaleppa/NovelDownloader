# Chapter 227: How Could She Agree? He Ultimately Underestimated the Ice Cube (1/2)

“Holy Lady, did you succeed?”

The madam asked cautiously from the side.

“No.”

Ever since returning, Yin Mianmian had been standing on the deck of the painted boat, leaning against the railing and gazing into the distance, remaining silent as if she had lost her soul.

“You... you failed even with your出手 (move)?”

The madam’s face filled with shock.要知道 (You know), even those with reputations towering above the Holy Lady would be in mortal danger if targeted by Yin Mianmian.

Li Mo was merely nineteenth on the Hidden Dragon List.

“Did his sect elders guard him by his side?”

“No.”

Yin Mianmian looked into the distance and softly denied it.

“Then... why?” The madam was bewildered.

Yin Mianmian’s mood was already a mess, and she was getting annoyed by the questions.

“His strength is greater than what is recorded on the Hidden Dragon List.”

“Stronger than the Hidden Dragon List?”

The madam’s heavily made-up face froze.

He is only sixteen.

She originally thought his ranking at nineteen had some margin of error, but it turns out he is actually ranked lower than he deserves?

Suddenly, she heard Yin Mianmian ask:

“Do you know of any Divine Intent or Soul Release that can make a person’s anger and resentment vanish, making them unable to generate any negative emotions toward the target?”

“This... is it a Buddhist Divine Intent?”

“Does he look like one of those baldies from the Zen Sect?”

“Hiss...”

The madam fell into deep thought, then her face showed a difficult expression.

“Occasionally, on the boat, some companions fall in love with their customers...”

“Speak plainly.”

Yin Mianmian frowned.

“That might, perhaps, be because... of love?”

“Love your damn head!”

Hearing this, Yin Mianmian almost lost her sanity.

The madam trembled.

“Go to the Listening Wind Tower and cancel Li Mo’s bounty.”

“Yes.”

The madam retreated as if granted a reprieve.

Yin Mianmian remained alone, sinking back into her thoughts.

The things Li Mo had said.

How much of it could possibly be true?

......

Meanwhile.

Outside the window, the night was deep. Inside the private room, the lamplight was dim.

Ying Bing’s jade legs were pressed together as she let out a soft breath.

Three times.

This was already... the third time she had been suppressed by Li Mo.

But her heart was in turmoil, not because of the failure again.

Although she later stood at the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, making people not even dare to look at her, her strength had always been peerless among her generation, and eventually, she found no equal.

However, her path had not been smooth sailing.

She had experienced near-death failures as well.

To admit defeat was to lose for a lifetime.

This punishment was not as severe as the Heavenly Human Illusion, nor the Law Body Tribulation, nor the Immortal Ascension Path.

Her current state of mind was more perfect than before; as long as she let nature take its course...

She slightly activated her Soul Intent.

Ying Bing opened her almond eyes, lightly bit her lips, and looked toward Li Mo.

The girl’s clear eyes, usually rippling with coolness, now carried a hint of seriousness.

“??”

The confused Li Mo became even more confused.

She used her Soul Intent?

The Ice Cube suddenly looks so serious.

Little Li suddenly remembered a past life experience where his best friend took him to get a foot massage. Before setting off, he had even washed his feet specifically, yet the person serving him was an auntie smoking a cigarette.

Her grip strength was immense, aggressively attacking his various reflex zones.

Under his friend’s teasing gaze, the prideful Little Li didn’t make a sound, even rebelliously saying: ‘Is that it? Auntie, didn’t you eat?’

As everyone knows.

The Ice Cube has always had a strong desire to win.

She never admits defeat.

So Little Li sat back down, locking eyes with her without hesitation.

“It seems it’s time for me to get serious.”

“...... Okay.” Ying Bing nodded with a cold expression.

“Then let’s change clothes.”

“?”

---

A second later.

Li Mo performed magic, taking out a set of things she had never seen before. It looked similar to a bellyband but was much more embarrassing than one.

“I can’t do the full service if you don’t change clothes~”

Little Li raised the corner of his mouth triumphantly.

She would back down from the difficulty, right.

He didn’t believe it; could the Ice Cube really...

“You... go out first.” Ying Bing’s soft voice sounded in his ear.

“Yeah, I knew it.....”

Li Mo shook his head and smiled, standing up.

But then he heard:

“Leave the clothes.”

“!”

*Slam*—

The door closed, and the room went dark.

**[Current Touch Area: 8%]**

A system prompt appeared, quite thoughtful, afraid the host wouldn’t complete the punishment.

This must have been calculated from when he rubbed her feet earlier.

Why would he like playing with that thing? It’s really strange...

And this outfit, though slightly better than the system reward, isn’t much better.

Where did he get it?

And he carries it with him all the time...

Usually, he is so gentle, sunny, and modest.

Ying Bing’s eyelashes trembled, and she finally let out a soft sigh.

“Be calm, let nature take its course...”

Sounds of rustling came from inside the room.

Little Li was leaning against the door, holding a brush in his hand, taking a deep breath.

He really didn’t expect the Ice Cube to agree so readily.

Before coming out, she had that look in her eyes...

“Come on, I need to be spirited.”

“Senior Brother Li, what are you doing?”

The room opposite opened, and Tang Xiaobao saw the brush in Li Mo’s mouth and was confused.

“I need to hold something in my mouth when I’m thinking about difficult problems.”

“I see.”

Tang Xiaobao didn’t quite understand.

But since Junior Brother Li is so talented, he must have his reasons.

So he imitated him, took out a pill that wasn’t too hard, threaded it with a small bamboo stick, and put it in his mouth.

So he also held a bamboo stick with a pill on it, his powdered jade-like face looking solemn.

“Senior Brother Li, what difficult problem did you encounter? Tell me and I’ll help you think about it.”

“I’m thinking that I might have a blood光 (bloody) disaster later.”

“That serious? I’ll go tell the Master!”

Tang Xiaobao immediately became serious.

But before he could run two steps, Li Mo turned his head back.

Li Mo said helplessly:

“It’s not a big problem, I might just have a bit of high blood pressure.”

“Then just take some medicine and you’ll be fine.” Tang Xiaobao sighed in relief.

“Will it work?”

“Why don’t you lick me a couple of times to try?”

“... Junior Brother Tang, go play by yourself, I’ll think about it myself.”

“Okay.”

Tang Xiaobao walked away with the lollipop pill in his mouth.

A moment later.

Suddenly, a clear voice was carried by the wind through the wooden door:

“You... can come in now.”

“Okay.”

Li Mo slightly activated his Soul Intent.

But it was strange.

The Divine Intent in his Soul Intent usually had excellent effects, but today it seemed to be working less effectively.

Little Li suddenly felt that even in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, where danger was everywhere, it wasn’t as tense as he was now.

But if he chickened out now.

He wouldn’t be able to hold his head up in front of the Ice Cube in the future!

She has learned to follow up on her attacks now.

*Click.*

The door to the new world opened a crack.

Walking in after closing the door, the moment his gaze fell on the Ice Cube, Little Li suddenly felt that his psychological expectations were still too low.

It wasn’t because of the swimsuit. Although the name was a bit strange, the style was relatively normal.

He underestimated the Ice Cube.
