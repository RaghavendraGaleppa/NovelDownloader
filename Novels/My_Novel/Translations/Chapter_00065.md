Chapter 65: The Dragon Appreciation Banquet and the Selection of Martial Arts

The Red Candle Inn.

"That vicious bandit has committed countless atrocities, yet luck seems to be on his side. He has escaped once again," Li Haitang cursed.

"The guards on duty were completely useless. Sigh, and we made Elder Li Houjun owe a favor for nothing," Yang Huayu said.

"After this incident, that villain definitely wouldn't dare stay in Qingning County anymore. Tracking him down again will require a lot of奔波 (travel)," Liu Xian said.

Yun Fei asked, "What should we do now?"

Li Haitang paced back and forth, thinking for a moment before saying, "Regardless of the outcome, we should go to Yihe Manor to pay our respects to the Madam of the Broken Sword and express our sincere gratitude."

Liu Xian, Yun Fei, and Yang Huayu all nodded in agreement. "That's all we can do. We must observe these courtesies."

By then, it was already late, and everyone rested for the night.

The next morning.

Li Xian led the way in front, with the surviving guards following behind. They felt the cold wind was particularly piercing, and an endless chill filled the air.

More than ten zhang behind them.

Four fine horses were treading through the snow. On the horses were Li Haitang and the others.

After about half an hour, they finally returned to the manor. The four of them went to the Guest Hall to pay respects to the Madam, while Li Xian and the others could rest for half a day to recuperate.

"Haa..."

With this matter settled, Li Xian let out a long breath. If there were such dangerous matters in the future, he wouldn't go to "broaden his horizons" anymore.

The guards who acted so domineering within the manor were pitifully weak when truly facing ruthless martial artists from the Jianghu.

"Strength... Only by improving my strength is the top priority!"

Li Xian clenched his fists.

Although he had never been lazy, after clearly recognizing his own insignificance, the fire in his heart burned even more intensely.

Now, [Square Fist] has reached Perfection. The next step is to reach its peak, the limit of a martial art.

[Whirlwind Leg] is Small Success, nearing Great Success.

[Emerald Silk Palm] is still at the Entry stage.

"The primary goal for the next step is to cultivate Whirlwind Leg to Great Success."

"Then, master Emerald Silk Palm completely!"

Li Xian secretly formulated a plan in his heart.

"If all goes well, I won't be far from Qi Circulation through the Meridians."

The Qi in his Dantian is already quite abundant. Condensing Qi into threads, they circulate through the 289 acupoints, and the Qi threads can still remain intact.

It is no longer far from the 361 acupoints, where Qi threads circulate through the entire cycle, completely locking down the blood and energy.

"Although it's said that greed leads to poor digestion..."

"If I could learn one more martial art, it would be of great help to my Qi Circulation."

"I am now a Grade B guard. I wonder if I can receive another basic martial art?"

A regular guard with a year of full attendance can receive one basic martial art. Veteran guards of eight or nine years can master seven or eight martial arts.

Their strength and foundation are both stronger than new guards.

However, Li Xian had been promoted several ranks in succession, which was clearly out of the ordinary. By right, going from Grade C to Grade B should entitle him to an additional basic martial art.

But Li Xian had already entered the Leisure Martial Pavilion and received the "Emerald Silk Palm," so Pang Long didn't mention this matter and didn't think Li Xian would need a basic martial art in the short term.

"I'll look for an opportunity tomorrow to talk to Commander Pang."

Guest Hall.

Li Haitang, Liu Xian, Yun Fei, and Yang Huayu met with Madam Wen Caitang and briefly described the events.

After hearing this, Madam Wen was not surprised and said with a hint of regret, "It's a pity. I have heard a thing or two about that bandit, the Jar Immortal."

"He has learned [Swallow Steps of the Broken], his lightness skill is quite commendable."

Li Haitang said, "Madam, for your assistance this time, I will inform my father to thank you."

Madam Wen smiled gently, "Niece, you are being too formal. There is no need for thanks, it was nothing."

"You four young heroes, at such a young age, dare to roam the Jianghu with such high spirits, truly enviable."

"Please, have a seat."

With a wave of her slender sleeve, a gust of hidden incense-infused wind blew out, gently pushing the four of them into their seats.

The four were all astonished. Her strength was truly formidable.

"This must be the young master of the Yang Family Manor, right?"

"I have long heard of the Two Heroes of the Yang Family Manor. Seeing you today, you have the spirit of your father."

"As for you two... judging by your appearance, you must be from the Prefecture City. Just now, your steps were steady, and your heels seemed to touch the ground, but in reality, they did not."

"It resembles the Willow Wind Steps of the Liu family from the Prefecture City. You have grasped its essence, truly amazing."

"This one's Qi flows like a bull, fierce and solid. You practice the [Three Hands of the Cloud Family] from the Prefecture City's Yun family, a family martial art. I am of limited knowledge and dare not make a rash comment. If I am wrong, young heroes, please do not laugh at me."

Her voice was light, and her words seemed to be praising the three. In reality, the intention was to show off her own knowledge and experience.

She saw through the origins of their martial arts at a glance.

The three who were pointed out were all shocked and speechless for a moment. They secretly felt apprehensive. This Madam, with her soft voice, was indeed a ruthless character. Was she blaming them for not introducing themselves, showing disrespect?

Li Haitang said, "Madam, your knowledge is profound. You saw through our backgrounds at a single glance."

"By the way, Madam, you don't seem to be from Qiong Tian Prefecture. Why are you so knowledgeable about the local forces?"

The Yang Family Manor, the Liu family, and the Yun family were all local tyrants in their respective areas, quite famous locally, but their reputations didn't spread far. Once outside Qiong Tian Prefecture, few would care.

Madam Wen smiled, "I have established a manor here, how could I not understand the local forces? After all... if one is careless, even a martial artist who has undergone a transformation can still capsize in a ditch."

"That is very true," Li Haitang agreed.

Madam Wen glanced at Li Haitang, seeing her charming face, young age, and fair, delicate skin. She had blossomed into a beauty.

As if remembering something, she casually advised, "Niece, as a woman roaming the Jianghu, you should be even more careful."

"Don't get targeted by some evil sect forces, that would be troublesome."

The implication was naturally the Flower Cage Sect. This sect specifically targeted women, with insidious methods. Many heroic women of the Jianghu have fallen to this sect.

"Yes," Li Haitang could only accept the advice.

"Perhaps... your father and I should meet soon," Wen Caitang said nonchalantly.

Li Haitang's pupils constricted, "You... are you referring to the Dragon Appreciation Banquet?"

Wen Caitang smiled without speaking. Li Haitang secretly muttered to herself. If it were the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, that would be fine. If it were the Dragon Slaying Banquet...

[You have diligently practiced your leg technique, grasped the twisting force, Proficiency +4]

Inside the manor's training yard.

Li Xian brought an iron basin and filled it with water. He kicked out with his foot. The basin itself remained still, but the water inside began to spin on its own, forming a small vortex.

This was a technique for controlling Qi and adjusting force,领悟ed after cultivating Whirlwind Leg to a certain level.

The leg force is like a wicked wind, finding its way into every nook and cranny. Once it penetrates the body, the leg force spirals and doesn't dissipate, pulling at the muscles, bones, meridians, and blood vessels.

Those with slightly weaker strength, after taking just one kick, would be unable to summon any strength and collapse on the ground.

[Whirlwind Leg]
[Proficiency: 1090/1500, Small Success]

[Emerald Silk Palm]
[Proficiency: 569/800, Entry]

The incident from yesterday was completely over. Li Haitang and the others had already ridden away from the manor early this morning.

Li Haitang, Yun Fei, and Yang Huayu continued to pursue the Jar Immortal. That Liu Xian seemed to have some business and returned to the Prefecture City first.

Those who participated in the siege of the Jar Immortal each received a reward of five hundred copper coins and a Deer Blood Pill.

The reward for risking one's life seemed a bit too little.

But in the Madam's eyes, a life seemed to be... worth about that price.

"Haa."

Li Xian let out a long breath of turbid air.

"It's time to ask Commander Pang if I can pick another martial art."

"Also... about the medicinal bath, I wonder when that will be arranged."
