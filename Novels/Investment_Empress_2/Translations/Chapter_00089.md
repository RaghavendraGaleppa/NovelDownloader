# Chapter 89: The Third Layer of "Phoenixes Singing in the Sky's Marsh"

“Dual Cultivation?”

As the words fell, the air grew subtly strange.

*Creak, creak—*

What was that sound?

Li Mo was stunned. He looked down to see the Ice Cube gripping the Sky Frost Sword so tightly it was creaking.

*Ugh.*

If it hadn’t been him who said those words, the sword would probably have already swung at him.

He looked up again and met Ying Bing’s scrutinizing gaze.

Li Mo: “!”

Was she going to dislike him now?

It was all those bandits in the Jianghu’s fault. They went around every day calling their evil, yin-supplementing techniques “Dual Cultivation,” making it easy for people to misunderstand.

“The two of us combining our sword arts to practice together isn’t also a form of Dual Cultivation?”

“This is a legitimate martial art,” Li Mo added.

“What do you mean, legitimate or illegitimate?” Ying Bing asked, tilting her head in confusion.

She was actually thinking about where exactly Li Mo’s inheritance came from in the Eastern Wilderness Domain. How could it even include martial arts related to Dual Cultivation?

After thinking for a moment, Ying Bing said thoughtfully, “This kind of martial art has extremely high requirements for both parties. We might not necessarily be able to practice it. Let me see it first.”

“Okay.”

Li Mo nodded and took out a few pages of pale golden paper from his chest.

Ying Bing sat down at the stone table, placed the Sky Frost Sword across her knees, and lowered her eyes to read. Gradually, her expression seemed surprised.

“Top-tier peerless art?”

“Yeah, I stumbled upon it by chance.”

“Come to my room tonight.”

“Huh?”

“Wasn’t it you who wanted to Dual Cultivate?”

“......”

The Ice Cube’s agreement was unexpectedly straightforward.

Little Li couldn’t help but sigh that she was truly her, characterized by her signature elegance and decisiveness.

Speaking of which, isn’t Dual Cultivation a form of investment?

Leaving the martial art behind, Li Mo saw Shang Wu leaning against the back door, crooking a finger at him.

It meant: “Come out here and take your beating.”

Li Mo sighed and went out the back door.

After he left, the hand Ying Bing was using to hold the paper slowly tightened.

She wasn’t an ignorant little girl.

This was indeed a legitimate Dual Cultivation martial art.

But even a legitimate one is typically something practiced only between partners.

The Gui Palace strictly forbids disciples from falling in love.

In her previous life, there were quite a few members who were caught precisely because they secretly practiced similar techniques.

But now, she was...

That strange feeling in her heart made her want to curl her fingers involuntarily.

However, if she didn’t use this as a pretext, she wouldn’t know how to fulfill the punishment criteria.

After all, Li Mo wouldn’t get drunk and barge into the wrong room every day...

It’s fine.

This is to get back to the top spot as soon as possible...

Also, to repay his favor...

Yes, that’s it, there’s no other meaning...

Besides, she could also figure out what kind of physique Li Mo has to produce such a strange internal energy.

Thinking this, Ying Bing seriously lowered her head and continued reading.

...

Outside the courtyard.

The fiery color once again enveloped this open space.

Li Mo still felt uncomfortable staying within the domain, but he didn’t try to use his internal energy to burn it again. After all, staying inside here could temper his internal energy.

Besides, as long as his master paid a little attention and patched up the loopholes in time, his previous trick wouldn’t work anymore.

He looked up and saw Shang Wu sitting on the wall with her legs crossed.

“Today, I’m still teaching you how to fight.”

“But what I’m teaching today can be considered a real skill.”

“Come on, make your move.”

She crooked her finger.

Li Mo actually saw a hint of seriousness on his usually lazy master’s face?

He couldn’t help but focus his mind.

*Hmm.*

He still started with the Wind Shadow Step.

Then used the Star Drop.

Then was flicked away by his master’s finger.

Just as the thought crossed his mind, his body moved.

...

However, just as he thought everything was proceeding as expected, he saw those fiery almond-shaped eyes.

Li Mo’s chest suddenly felt tight, as if struck by lightning. It felt as if a divine mountain was crushing him, while he was just a withered grass being crushed.

His vision went directly dark.

He was dead.

No, not really dead.

He had just genuinely experienced death once.

That terrifying aura lingered in his consciousness even after he woke up.

“You woke up faster than I imagined.”

Shang Wu was still sitting on the wall, her crossed legs swinging leisurely.

“Just now...”

“Those who practice swords have Sword Intent. A hammer isn’t just for smashing people.”

Shang Wu jumped down.

“Killing Intent?” Li Mo asked tentatively.

“Not entirely.”

The fire in Shang Wu’s eyes faded:

“You’re currently like someone who possesses a treasure mountain but doesn’t know it.”

“Same old rule, we’ll talk while we fight.”

“......”

Li Mo was silent.

Wouldn’t this mean he’d be beaten for an entire day?

...

Nightfall.

Another day of fighting lessons had ended.

“I finally understand why Master never had any disciples before.”

“If it were someone else, the grass on their grave would be three zhang high by next year.”

Li Mo, who didn’t even want to move a single finger, sank his mind into his Dantian.

It had to be said, if he could endure Shang Wu’s training methods, the effects were quite remarkable.

His internal energy had grown a little stronger again.

And this wasn’t the key point.

If he were to fight his past self, with similar internal energy, he was confident he could take him down within ten moves.

His realm and fighting skills were progressing at an astonishing speed.

Give him another month or so, and he might be able to reach the peak of Qi Condensation?

Dragging his exhausted body into the courtyard, Li Mo saw the "Phoenixes Singing in the Sky's Marsh" he had given to the Ice Cube in the morning, lying quietly on the stone table.

It was obvious that the Ice Cube had just tossed it here after reading it.

“Speaking of which, I haven’t read it myself yet.”

Li Mo warmed up his food and read while eating.

This martial art is divided into four layers.

The first layer focuses on the blending of Qi.

The second layer is the blending of Spirit and Intent.

The third layer... is the Unity of Spirit and Flesh.

“The meaning of Unity of Spirit and Flesh shouldn’t be...”

Li Mo fell silent for a moment.

【Ten years of martial arts insight successfully injected】

【Year One...】

...

Soon, the deduction was complete.

*Hmm, it’s strange, he领悟ed this thing quite quickly.*

Li Mo opened his mouth, forgetting to swallow his food.

This martial art could be practiced by people of the same gender, but it could never reach the third layer.

Because it requires the two practitioners to know each other inside out.

Only then, at that moment, can Qi, Spirit, and Heart achieve a brief, perfect fusion.

*Gasp...*

Same gender isn’t completely impossible... but that’s not the point!

The Ice Cube didn’t领悟 to this layer, did she?

“Li Mo.”

A familiar voice came from upstairs.

Ying Bing stood by the window.

“Come up.”

“Okay.”

Li Mo felt a bit uneasy.

*Creak—*

As he pushed the door open, he met Ying Bing’s clear and deep gaze.

Li Mo felt a bit uncomfortable being stared at like that:

“How much of that Dual Cultivation martial art did you learn?”

“I’ve just barely grasped the first layer. I was planning to do the rest tomorrow...”

“That’s good, the first layer is good enough, it’ll suffice.”

Li Mo’s heart relaxed slightly.

At this moment, a familiar chill began to spread from Ying Bing.

In the darkness.

The girl patted the bedside, her voice cold and clear:

“Take off your clothes, come here.”
