# Chapter 20: Mountain Wilderness Dwelling  

"I never expected the possession technique to be so useful for hunting. So quickly I've bagged a large pheasant," Qin Ziling murmured as his soul returned to his body. He stood up, happily stuffing the pheasant into a burlap sack.  

Fortunately, no soul cultivators were present at this time and place. Had they known a fellow practitioner had used the possession technique to hunt a mere pheasant and was gloating about it, they would have surely nailed Qin Ziling to the pillar of shame in the spiritual cultivation world!  

Since ancient times, soul cultivators had always been regarded as prodigies—mysterious and awe-inspiring figures in the mortal world. Who among them would need to hunt a pheasant in the dead of night, let alone resort to the possession technique?  

After storing the pheasant, Qin Ziling repeated his method and soon added two rabbits and a muntjac to his haul, filling the sack to the brim.  

Pleased with his bountiful harvest but feeling the fatigue from repeatedly using soul possession—both his spirit and body growing weak from prolonged soul detachment—he decided to call it a night and head home.  

Qin Ziling stored the sack of prey in a corner of his Corpse Nurturing Ring, far from the coffin at its center where the yin and corpse energy were thinnest. Storing the prey there for a short time posed no issue; in fact, the heavy yin energy and low temperature inside the ring helped preserve the freshness.  

However, if left too long, the pervasive corpse energy would gradually seep into the prey, altering the meat's quality.  

"Just the outskirts yielded so much. If I venture deeper, I might even bag medium-sized beasts."  

Descending the mountain and storing the copper corpse back into the ring, Qin Ziling stood at the foot of Xisheng Mountain, looking back at its dark silhouette. His eyes gleamed as if gazing upon a mountain of gold and silver.  

The next day, Qin Ziling entered the city early.  

Instead of heading straight to the martial arts school, he first visited the western city's market to purchase some disguise materials. Finding a secluded spot, he transformed his appearance.  

When he re-entered the market, the handsome young man had become a burly, bearded fellow.  

This common disguise technique was partly derived from the fragmented memories and experiences of the demonic cultivator Li Mo, and partly from books he had read in his wheelchair-bound past life to pass the time.  

After some inquiries, Qin Ziling arrived at a shop named "Mountain Wilderness Dwelling," a store in the western market specializing in purchasing wild game and medicinal herbs.  

The shop had two sections: one for wild game and the other for herbs.  

As Qin Ziling entered, a worker carrying two bamboo baskets hurried out. Through the gaps and the scent wafting from them, he guessed the baskets contained game, likely destined for a restaurant or some household.  

Inside, a clerk stood idly by the door while a goat-bearded manager, who also served as the accountant, fiddled with an abacus.  

Spotting Qin Ziling entering with a large sack, the clerk's eyes lit up, and he quickly approached, politely asking, "Sir, are you here to sell goods?"  

"Indeed," Qin Ziling nodded, then thumped the sack onto the counter. "Give me a price."  

The manager set aside his abacus and account books, walking over to greet Qin Ziling with a cupped-hand salute. "I am Manager Zhu. May I know how to address you, sir?"  

"Manager Zhu, a pleasure. My surname is Qin," Qin Ziling replied.  

"Master Qin, the pleasure is mine," Manager Zhu responded with another salute before turning to the clerk. "Lin Er, take a look."  

The clerk opened the sack, pulling out two rabbits and the muntjac and placing them in a large bamboo basket nearby.  

Seeing the muntjac, Manager Zhu's eyes gleamed slightly as he stroked his beard. Just as he was about to speak, two women entered.  

One wore a goose-yellow robe, tall with notably long legs. Her facial features were sharp, her skin a healthy ivory hue, smooth and radiant. Her jet-black hair was tied back simply with a ribbon, exuding elegance with a touch of vigor and competence. She appeared to be in her early twenties.  

The other woman was more voluptuous, around twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with softer features and a mature, charming allure. However, the sharp glint in her peach-blossom eyes as they fell on the rabbits and muntjac's heads sent a slight chill down Qin Ziling's spine. He recognized her as a formidable figure, far from the gentle appearance she projected.  

"Madam, Miss Xia, you're here!" Manager Zhu greeted them hastily, momentarily setting aside the pricing discussion with Qin Ziling.  

The tall woman in yellow nodded slightly at Manager Zhu before turning to Qin Ziling with a cupped-hand salute. "Greetings, sir. I am Xiao Qing, the owner of this shop."  

"Miss Xiao, a pleasure. Qin Feng," Qin Ziling replied, casually fabricating a name.  

"Master Qin, the smell here is rather strong. Please join me in the backyard to discuss the price," Xiao Qing gestured politely.  

Both Manager Zhu and the clerk were surprised to see their usually aloof owner personally inviting Qin Ziling to the backyard for negotiations.  

The backyard was unexpectedly elegant and serene, filled with various flowers and plants. A pavilion stood by a rockery and a clear pond where red koi fish swam leisurely—a stark contrast to the blood-stained game in the shop.  

Seated in the pavilion, the mature Miss Xia served tea and snacks.  

"Though the muntjac isn't a particularly rare catch, they are naturally skittish, fleeing at the slightest disturbance. Their agility makes them hard to hunt. For you to catch one, Master Qin must be quite the skilled hunter," Xiao Qing remarked after sipping her tea.  

"Just luck," Qin Ziling replied modestly.  

"Two rabbits and a muntjac, all killed with a single blow to the head—that's no ordinary luck," Xiao Qing pointed out.  

The copper corpse had used the back of a chopping knife to crush their skulls, leaving no other wounds.  

Qin Ziling merely smiled enigmatically.  

"The rabbits weigh about ten catties each, the muntjac around thirty-four or thirty-five. The pelts are intact. The rabbits aren't worth much, but the muntjac's meat and bones are nourishing, and its hide is prized by the wealthy. How about three taels of silver?" Xiao Qing shifted to pricing.  

"Deal," Qin Ziling agreed readily.  

He had already inquired about market prices beforehand, with the highest offer being two taels and eight mace. But since he planned to sell game regularly, setting up his own stall wasn't practical. He needed a reliable long-term buyer.  

Xiao Qing's offer was slightly above market price, so he accepted without hesitation.
