# Chapter 15: Immortal Fate

Although Li Wenyuan only held the fourth rank, he was the prefect of Nanling Prefecture—a true high-ranking official and the highest authority in the region. If he wanted a promotion, he would have to return to the central capital and join the imperial court.

A series of violent crimes had occurred consecutively in Nanling Prefecture. Although they were related to immortal cultivators, the impact was undeniably severe. No matter how one looked at it, Li Wenyuan would inevitably face some repercussions.

However, since Li Wenyuan had no intention of returning to the central capital, the matter wasn’t of great concern to him.

"Shiming, you should go back and rest. The autumn examinations are coming up soon—you must take care of your health!" Li Wenyuan didn’t want Li Shiming to get too involved in these affairs and waved him off with a smile.

"You should rest early as well!" Li Shiming reminded him before leaving.

As he stepped out of the room, he saw several officials hurrying over and couldn’t help but sigh helplessly. It was clear that Li Wenyuan wouldn’t be getting much rest tonight.

Walking across the stone bridge toward his own courtyard, Li Shiming suddenly paused and glanced in a particular direction—where the two immortal cultivators had been staying.

The guest courtyard was still illuminated by candlelight.

"Li Shiming seeks an audience with the Immortals!" he called out loudly, standing between the two adjacent gates of the guest courtyards.

There was no response, just as he had expected.

Still, he had asked out of courtesy, just in case.

He tried pushing one of the gates and found it barred from the inside. 

It wasn’t difficult to open from the outside. He took out a dagger, slid it through the gap in the door, and with a few deft movements, dislodged the wooden latch.

Stepping inside, he saw that the doors to the rooms were wide open.

He searched the main hall, bedrooms, and other chambers without any trouble but found nothing.

The immortal cultivators seemed to have left no trace behind, as if they had never lived there at all. 

The courtyard was exactly as it had been before—even the bedding on the bed remained untouched.

He hadn’t held much hope to begin with, but he had wanted to check on the slim chance that the two cultivators might have left something behind.

Disappointed, he left the first courtyard and entered the second one.

In the bedroom of this courtyard, he spotted a circular disk placed on the floor.

The disk emitted a faint glow, with four milky-white stones at its center, connected by countless intricate lines forming an unusual pattern.

The *Introduction to Runes* left by Chief Escort Wang hadn’t mentioned such a disk, but based on its appearance, it was likely some kind of formation.

"It can’t be a defensive formation—otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to enter," Li Shiming reasoned with his limited knowledge of immortal cultivation.

He picked up a wooden chair nearby and carefully moved it over the disk.

"Not an offensive formation either," he concluded when the chair remained unharmed.

Since there was no danger, he didn’t hesitate any longer. He reached out and placed his hand inside the disk.

Nothing happened—no attack, no unexpected reaction.

"Could this be a cultivation-assisting formation?" he wondered.

The truth was, Junior Sister Zheng hadn’t taken the Spirit Gathering Disk with her for two reasons. First, Senior Brother Zhao had called for her urgently, and she hadn’t expected to be unable to return. Second, activating the disk consumed a significant amount of spirit stones, but once stabilized, the consumption became minimal.

Under normal circumstances, she would only activate it once during her stay and leave it running to conserve spirit stones.

The Great Xia was within the territory of their sect. Most powerful cultivators here would show respect to sect disciples. Among fellow Qi Refining cultivators, sect members held an absolute advantage in terms of strength, artifacts, and talismans. She had never imagined she wouldn’t make it back.

That was why the Spirit Gathering Disk had been left behind. Of course, had Senior Brother Zhao known about it, he would have returned to retrieve it even if injured or under threat from rogue cultivators.

But Junior Sister Zheng had kept the disk a secret. She knew that if word got out, she’d have to watch out for fellow disciples who might kill her for it.

Li Shiming made his guess and stepped into the disk’s glow, sitting cross-legged with the disk beneath him.

He attempted to circulate the *Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique*. Before, no matter how many times he tried, he had never sensed anything. But this time was completely different.

Tiny dots of light floated around him—three colors in total: gold, red, and green.

He didn’t know what they represented, but sensing them meant he had finally detected spiritual energy.

This was the foundational requirement for cultivating the *Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique*. Suppressing his excitement, he followed the first-layer pathway of the technique, drawing the spiritual energy into his body and guiding it along the prescribed meridians.

Li Shiming had no idea how fortunate he was. Normally, even for those with spiritual roots, cultivation required not only resources and the right environment but also a technique suited to their innate attributes.

The *Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique* left behind by Chief Escort Wang’s ancestors was an exceptionally versatile method, suitable for cultivators of any spiritual affinity.

This was precisely to ensure that any descendant with spiritual roots could practice it.

Li Shiming became completely absorbed in his first experience with cultivation. Spiritual energy continuously entered his body, gathering at his chest.

An hour later, his body trembled violently as a swirling vortex of spiritual energy formed in his chest. Though the gathered energy was meager, the vortex kept it from dissipating.

When he opened his eyes, the room appeared as bright as daylight.

This wasn’t due to the candlelight—his body had undergone a significant transformation after being nourished by the spiritual energy.

A foul odor assaulted his senses. He quickly realized it was coming from his own body.

His exposed skin was covered in a layer of black, greasy filth. Pulling open his clothes, he saw that his entire body was coated in the substance.

It seemed the formation of the spiritual vortex had forced impurities out of his body.

According to the *Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique*, the appearance of the vortex in his chest marked his official entry into the first layer of Qi Refining.

He didn’t dare attempt to manipulate the energy—there was simply too little of it, and without guidance, he was like a blind man trying to understand an elephant.

Looking at the still-glowing Spirit Gathering Disk, he knew it was wasteful to leave it active. But after his first cultivation session, the meridians through which the energy had flowed ached faintly. He wasn’t ready for another session just yet.

After a moment’s thought, he placed his hand on the disk and stored it in his machine room space.

Even inside the machine room, the disk continued to draw in spiritual energy. Though the origin of the energy in that space was unknown, the disk steadily gathered it from the void.

Li Shiming observed the disk for a while, confirming that it didn’t interfere with the other equipment in the machine room. Only then did he withdraw his consciousness, satisfied.
