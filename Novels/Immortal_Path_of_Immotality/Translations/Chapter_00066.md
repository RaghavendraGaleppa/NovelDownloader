# Chapter 66: The Deceptive Immortal Huang

After spending a day wandering through the shop district, noticing that night was about to fall again, Lin Shan headed straight for the western part of the city.

He wanted to first take care of Immortal Huang's request to settle this matter and see how much inheritance he could claim. Once these affairs were dealt with, he could focus on his own development.

Upon reaching his destination, he found that the western district was entirely devoted to entertainment—teahouses, beast stables, opera houses, brothels, and even a black market hidden somewhere in the area.

There was only one brothel here, adorned with glazed jade tiles and green-trimmed edges, its entrance bustling with activity under the glow of red lanterns. Women stood at the door, actively soliciting customers, while several second-floor windows were left open, offering glimpses of alluring figures inside. The signboard above the entrance bore three gilded characters:

"Spring Swallow Pavilion."

From the conversations of passing cultivators, it seemed all the female cultivators inside had stage names containing the character "Chun" (Spring).

Lin Shan hesitated at the brothel's steps, not due to any personal inadequacy, but because he wasn't sure how much money he'd have to spend here. This didn't seem like the kind of place a poor rogue cultivator like him could afford.

Listening to the chatter of the cultivators coming and going—some praising "Yingchun," others lauding "Yuchun"—a sinking feeling crept into his heart. The "Yuanchun" Immortal Huang had mentioned, with "Yuan" symbolizing new beginnings and renewal, seemed from the naming convention alone to be of a rather high rank.

Steeling himself, Lin Shan entered. The madam greeted him warmly, "Young master, you're quite youthful! Which lady would you like to spend the night with tonight?"

Lin Shan forced himself to ask, "Is Lady Yuanchun available tonight?"

The madam beamed. "Of course! Would the young master like to reserve her for the night?"

"How much would that cost?"

"Lady Yuanchun is our top performer—one hundred spirit stones per night."

Lin Shan: "..."

For a moment, the two simply stared at each other, one wide-eyed with shock, the other waiting expectantly.

Beads of sweat formed on Lin Shan's forehead as he clenched his fists, inwardly cursing, "Damn you, Immortal Huang! Are you messing with me?!"

He wanted nothing more than to pry open Immortal Huang's coffin and demand to know how the man could have possibly afforded the top courtesan twenty years ago. He even began to suspect that the truth might be that Immortal Huang had merely been infatuated with her, smitten at first sight by her beauty.

But the real issue was this: spending a single night with the top courtesan cost a hundred spirit stones. The eighty spirit stones Immortal Huang had left him weren't even enough for that, let alone to buy her freedom!

Lin Shan stood frozen, his expression shifting between disbelief and fury.

---

The madam studied the young man, unsure whether he could actually afford their services. "Will the young master still be reserving Yuanchun?"

Snapped out of his thoughts, Lin Shan glanced around at the bustling crowd. Having already come this far, he couldn't just leave without doing anything. Reluctantly, he paid three spirit stones for the cheapest option—a seat at a side table to listen to music and drink tea.

At the center of the hall, a stage held a refined courtesan in purple gauze playing the pipa. Though her face was veiled, her graceful silhouette and delicate features suggested undeniable beauty. Around her, cultivators sat enjoying fruits and wine, each accompanied by a courtesan.

Soon, the madam brought over a young girl in her teens, at the early Qi Refining stage. "Young master, this is Luanchun. Three spirit stones only cover half an hour of tea. Additional time will cost extra."

Lin Shan nodded wordlessly. Three spirit stones just to listen to music with a time limit—this place was extortionate.

The girl named Luanchun sat beside him, pouring tea before folding her hands demurely in her lap. Lin Shan studied her—fair-skinned with delicate willow-leaf eyebrows, exuding an air of vulnerability. Though still young and not fully developed, her figure was beginning to fill out the brothel's tailored attire.

Noticing his gaze, Luanchun lowered her head, her ears turning pink.

Lin Shan discreetly observed the other patrons. Most were either engrossed in the music or flirting with their companions, though a few seemed to be getting handsy.

After a moment, he frowned. So... was touching allowed or not?

Ahem. No—he was here to fulfill Immortal Huang's request, not to indulge. But the thought of how the old man had tricked him made his blood boil, quickly replacing any fleeting distractions.

Beside him, Luanchun, mistaking his displeasure, whispered nervously, "Young master, today is my first time receiving guests. I'm not very familiar with the rules..."

Having already spent the money, Lin Shan decided to make conversation. "Your first time? What did you do before this?"

Tears welled in Luanchun's eyes as she recounted her tragic past—born into a wealthy mortal family, she had entered the path of cultivation only to fall victim to loan sharks in Yichuan, eventually being sold to the brothel.

Lin Shan's expression grew increasingly odd. Her story sounded eerily similar to Immortal Huang's.

As they talked, Lin Shan learned more about the brothel's workings. When Luanchun mentioned that the top courtesan title changed hands every twenty years, realization struck him. "Wait—so the current Yuanchun just took the title this year?"

Startled, Luanchun nodded timidly. "Yes. The title 'Yuanchun' is passed down. This year's successor was just named."

Everything clicked into place. The "Yuanchun" Immortal Huang had spoken of must have been the top courtesan from two generations ago.

Eagerly, Lin Shan pressed, "Do you know what happened to the previous Yuanchuns?"

Luanchun's eyes sparkled with admiration. "Most were bought out by powerful cultivators."

Huh? If she had already been redeemed, then could he keep the eighty spirit stones with a clear conscience? Lin Shan's eyes gleamed with greed, making Luanchun shrink back slightly.

"What about the Yuanchun from two generations ago? Was she redeemed?"

"No, she's still here."

To his surprise, Luanchun answered without hesitation.

"Where is she now?"

A familiar sense of foreboding crept over Lin Shan. That old swindler Huang wouldn't have made things this simple.

"She's the current madam."

"The madam?!" 

Lin Shan's voice trembled as he glanced at the woman hustling customers at the door. The eighty spirit stones in his pouch suddenly felt scalding hot.

"How much to redeem the madam?"

Luanchun blinked at the absurd question. "She doesn't need redeeming. She owns the brothel now. How could she redeem herself?"
