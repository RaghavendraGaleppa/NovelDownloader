# Chapter 71: Finally Obtaining the Inheritance  

Han Yue spoke again, asking:  

"Disciple finds it difficult to fully comprehend the various divine abilities and secret techniques of the sect at the moment. Could the Patriarch help me select the remaining two divine abilities?"  

The [Chuanzong] True Master was intimately familiar with all the secret techniques passed down in the Shenxiao Palace. He didn’t even need time to think about Han Yue’s request.  

"At the Renshen Realm, one’s mana is weak, and there are few divine abilities and secret techniques that can be cultivated. Moreover, as one advances to higher realms, most techniques can be replaced by superior versions, making them hardly worth the time and effort."  

"Take the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* and *Entangling Thunder Robe*—both possess unique functions that remain useful even after advancement."  

"I will recommend three more divine abilities for you. If you master them at the Renshen Realm, the experience gained will carry over even after you advance, ensuring your efforts won’t be wasted."  

"The first is the *Primordial Great Hand Seal*, a simplified version of our Shenxiao Palace’s secret technique, the *Primordial Qi Shenxiao Great Hand Seal*."  

"Though it will be replaced after your advancement, the experience you gain in manipulating energy hand seals will remain."  

"This way, your cultivation of the *Primordial Qi Shenxiao Great Hand Seal* will progress faster than others."  

"Moreover, if you have the energy to master the *Primordial Great Hand Seal* to perfection, there’s a high chance it will help the *Shenxiao Great Hand Seal* condense a second hand upon advancement, doubling its power!"  

"However, time at the Renshen Realm is precious, and mana is limited. Few can afford to dedicate so much effort to mastering a divine ability."  

Han Yue decided to learn this technique.  

He had witnessed his master using the *Shenxiao Great Hand Seal* before, and its formidable power had left a deep impression on him.  

Furthermore, with the *Heavenly Origin Treasure Emperor Lotus* as his foundation, his mana far surpassed that of his peers, allowing him to attempt reaching perfection.  

"The second is the *Breath Concealment Art*, which allows one to suppress their aura and shield themselves from detection—a technique with unique utility."  

"However, few in our Shenxiao Palace care for such an ability."  

"Shenxiao cultivators never shy away from challenges or battles. Many would rather cultivate a technique with the opposite effect, one that draws attention wherever they go."  

"The third is *Wind Barrier Breaker*, whose effect is self-explanatory. Mastery reduces wind resistance during flight, increasing speed."  

"Many disciples who lack flying prowess choose to learn it, as it remains useful even at the third realm."  

"However, this technique only has a noticeable effect when flying below 30,000 li per hour. Beyond that speed, its benefits become negligible."  

"These three divine abilities are among the few at the Renshen Realm that are truly useful. You may choose two to cultivate."  

Han Yue committed this advice to heart. After thanking the [Chuanzong] True Master, he followed the direction indicated and set off.  

Once Han Yue had left, the [Chuanzong] True Master carefully reviewed the assessment records he had compiled, ensuring there were no errors before storing them away.  

Then, he picked up the half-read book he had been perusing earlier and resumed reading, swaying his head slightly as he did so.  

Deep within the vast *Shenxiao Stele Forest*, a brand-new stele suddenly rose from the ground.  

A mysterious force of mana carved a new passage onto its surface, stroke by stroke.  

Once finished, the same force moved to the opposite side of the stele and inscribed four large characters with precision:  

*"Draft of Yuanchu's Biography"*  

Carving steles and recording biographies for Shenxiao Palace disciples was a task the [Chuanzong] True Master had upheld for tens of thousands of years.  

To all members of the Shenxiao Palace, this work was a grand endeavor crucial to the sect’s legacy!  

True inheritance was not merely the continuation of doctrines, the transfer of authority, or the preservation of knowledge.  

The arduous and courageous cultivation paths of every predecessor were also invaluable spiritual treasures.  

The indomitable spirit of each disciple in their pursuit of the Dao was the very backbone and essence that forged the soul of the Shenxiao Palace!  

At this moment, beside Han Yue’s newly erected stele, countless identical steles already stood in this area.  

Among them, fifty-three steles dedicated to the sect’s Eternal True Masters shone brilliantly.  

Meanwhile, on the other side of the *Shenxiao Stele Forest*, Han Yue followed the path indicated by the [Chuanzong] True Master.  

After walking roughly a li, he arrived at the end of the path, where a small stone hut stood.  

As expected, the plaque above its entrance bore the words *"Zhixin Study"* in bold characters.  

Without hesitation, Han Yue pushed the door open and entered.  

Inside, seven steles stood side by side.  

Before them lay a rough cushion woven from gourd vines.  

Han Yue recognized the material because a small, unripe gourd still hung from one side of the cushion.  

Upon entering the *Zhixin Study*, an inexplicable sensation arose in Han Yue’s mind.  

Guided by this feeling, he knelt on the cushion before the steles.  

This cushion was none other than the Shenxiao Palace’s secret treasure—the *Primordial Gourd Heart-Questioning Cushion*!  

It enhanced one’s spiritual awareness, allowing them to uncover their deepest innate nature and inner light.  

Placed here, it aided new disciples in sensing the cultivation method most suited to them.  

As Han Yue knelt on the cushion, he felt an unparalleled tranquility in his heart.  

His dantian was calm, his mana smooth and undisturbed.  

His spiritual perception surged, his divine sense becoming lively and agile.  

Countless insights burst forth in his mind, instantly resolving many of the difficulties he had encountered in his cultivation.  

The *Entangling Thunder Robe* and *Thunder Nourishes the Soul*, which he had been reviewing over the past few days, suddenly became clear to him. Han Yue felt he could master them at any moment!  

Following the guidance in his mind, Han Yue solemnly bowed before the seven steles.  

With the first bow, his thunderous mana illuminated his entire being, merging with his body and soul.  

Three of the steles before him instantly vanished.  

A small sword, a gentle breeze, and a talisman seemed to drift past his vision before disappearing.  

Second bow.  

Within his consciousness, the divine ability rune of *Thoughtless Blade* erupted with a brilliant violet light!  

Under its radiance, another stele faded away.  

A winding celestial river appeared before Han Yue’s eyes before vanishing.  

Third bow.  

The remaining three steles suddenly released countless rays of violet light, each carrying profound truths that surged toward him!  

The three steles seemed to compete, as if vying for the chance to merge with Han Yue.  

At that moment, the long-dormant *Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique* rune in his consciousness also burst forth with golden radiance!  

This golden light was overwhelmingly domineering, pressing down upon the violet light of two steles and forcing them to disappear.  

Only one stele remained. Riding the golden light, it shot straight into Han Yue’s consciousness!  

Han Yue felt as if a massive object had suddenly thrust into his mind, stretching his consciousness to its limits!  

Yet, aided by the secret treasure cushion beneath him, he endured the strain and successfully absorbed the stele.  

As his divine sense swept over it, an ancient inscription appeared in his mind:  

*"The Supreme Shenxiao True Thunder Magnetic Longevity Scripture"*  

After countless trials and hardships, Han Yue had finally obtained the true inheritance of the Great Dao!
