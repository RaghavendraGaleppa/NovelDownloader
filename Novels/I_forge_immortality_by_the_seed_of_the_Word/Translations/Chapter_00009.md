# Chapter 9: The Potent Spirit Beast Meat

Silence.

A deathly silence.

Then—

Boom!

An explosive uproar erupted, nearly lifting the roof off the Dharma Hall.

"Am I dreaming? He just received the visualization technique yesterday and mastered it overnight?"

"Is the instructor lying to us? How is this possible?"

"What kind of monstrous talent is this?"

"Wait—what did the instructor mean by that 'Grade A' comprehensive evaluation?"

Shocked exclamations rose one after another. The news revealed by Instructor Wang had stirred towering waves in everyone's hearts, leaving them unable to calm down for a long time.

Among the crowd, Zhang Jing, who had been calm moments ago, now wore an expression as if he'd seen a ghost.

What in the world?!

Mastering the visualization technique in just one night after receiving it?

That's outright cheating!

Even with the help of his mysterious jade talisman and the Eye of the Heart technique, it had taken him a full ten days. The gap between them was simply unimaginable.

As for whether that person might have obtained the visualization technique earlier—

This thought flickered briefly in Zhang Jing's mind before he dismissed it. He didn't think anyone would be foolish enough to cheat their way into such conspicuousness—that would be suicidal. Moreover, if such a thing had happened, the Dao Academy would surely have uncovered it.

"So this is what a top-tier genius of this world looks like? Truly—"

For a moment, Zhang Jing was at a loss for words.

Between people, shouldn't there at least be some... limits?

He had just been thinking that only those with truly overwhelming talent could catch up to or surpass the disciples of cultivation families in the academy's assessment. And now, here was a living example—one that exceeded all expectations.

Having practiced the visualization technique himself, Zhang Jing understood perfectly well that with such terrifying talent, it didn't matter whether this Shen Qingqing came from a cultivation family or not. It was irrelevant.

Meanwhile, the four sitting at the front displayed varied expressions.

Ji Bochang's painted fan trembled slightly in his hand, his face nearly frozen. Notably, the fan remained closed.

As for the other three, including Chu Lingyun—

The composure they had maintained until now was finally replaced by profound shock.

"Grade A... Grade A..."

They muttered unconsciously.

Elsewhere, as his initial shock gradually faded, Zhang Jing's attention turned to something else—the "comprehensive evaluation" mentioned by Instructor Wang.

Grade A!

"Right, Instructor Wang only mentioned the passing criteria earlier. But obviously, any assessment would have a grading system—this must be it."

"But what are the rules?"

Zhang Jing focused his gaze on Instructor Wang at the podium.

Sure enough, seeing the crowd's reaction, a smug "I knew this would happen" expression appeared on Instructor Wang's face.

"Enough," he called out.

Instantly, the Dharma Hall fell silent.

"That girl, Shen Qingqing, possesses a special talent. All you need to do is focus on your cultivation and strive to master the visualization technique as soon as possible. There's no need to compare yourselves to her."

"As for the comprehensive evaluation—"

Instructor Wang paused, then continued in a solemn tone:

"For the Dao Academy's assessment, those who pass will be graded into four tiers—A, B, C, and D—based on the time taken to master the visualization technique."

"Those who master it within three days receive Grade A, within seven days Grade B, within fifteen days Grade C, and within thirty days Grade D."

"Upon entering the outer academy, Grade A talents may select a high-grade inheritance, Grade B a mid-grade inheritance, and Grade C a low-grade inheritance."

"As for Grade D, they may choose an ungraded inheritance."

Having said this, Instructor Wang looked at Ji Bochang and the other three in front, speaking with a hint of envy:

"The higher your grade, the more the academy will value you. The four of you have the potential to achieve Grade B. With that, you may even enter the inner academy in the future. Seize this opportunity and do not slack off."

"Yes, Instructor."

"As for you few," Instructor Wang turned to some others, "you might aim for Grade C."

"Understood. Thank you for your guidance, Instructor."

Finally, his gaze swept over the remaining disciples as he said indifferently:

"Don't give up. It's still early, and you may yet pass the assessment. Even with Grade D, if you accumulate enough Dao merits after entering the academy, you can exchange them for precious high-grade inheritances and have hope of reaching Foundation Establishment."

"Three days from now, the lecture begins at the first hour of Mao!"

Without waiting for a response, Instructor Wang vanished in a flash.

The disciples began to disperse in small groups, some heavy-hearted, others filled with anticipation. Before long, only Zhang Jing remained.

He sighed, muttering unwillingly to himself, "I still need nine more days to master the visualization technique... That means Grade C!"

"The difference between mid-grade and low-grade inheritances is huge. Not to mention the disparity in the academy's regard for each grade."

"So close..."

Zhang Jing felt a pang of despair.

After much deliberation, he couldn't find a way to bridge that gap and master the technique within seven days.

In the end—

'Fine, Grade C it is. At least it's better than Grade D,' Zhang Jing resigned himself to the thought.

With the mysterious jade talisman, he could afford to take his time with cultivation.

Gurgle—

His stomach growled. He was getting hungry.

At the Spirit Canteen, Zhang Jing frowned as he counted the silver in his hand.

"Only twenty-five taels and three maces left. The food here is ridiculously expensive—just a simple meal costs three or four maces."

Muttering to himself, he strode into the canteen.

A man had to eat, after all.

Besides, perhaps due to excessive mental exertion, he found that if he ate the dry rations from his pack, he'd be hungry again within two hours. The canteen's food, though pricey, kept him full much longer.

The Spirit Canteen was divided into eastern and western halls.

The western hall was larger, serving meals purchasable with silver. The eastern hall was smaller, offering dishes made from spirit beast meat and spirit rice—highly nourishing but requiring spirit stones.

"Brother Zhang, over here!"

Just as Zhang Jing was about to head to the western hall, Ji Bochang grabbed him and pulled him into the eastern one.

"Brother Ji, I can't afford this place," Zhang Jing said awkwardly.

"This is my treat—I have something to ask you," Ji Bochang replied with a laugh, waving his painted fan more vigorously. The two naked fairies depicted on it seemed to dance as it fluttered.

"Brother Ji, just ask directly," Zhang Jing said, sitting upright at a dark green jade table.

"Well, I wanted to ask—are you confident about passing the assessment?"

"Oh? What do you mean?" A flicker of curiosity crossed Zhang Jing's eyes.

"Since you ask, I'll be frank. Back on the spirit crane, I was forced into a bet with Wu Mingyuan—whether you'd pass the assessment or not."

"And I bet that you would!"

"Why would you bet on that?" Zhang Jing's eyes widened.

"Who knows what madness possessed him?"

"What's the wager?"

Zhang Jing took a deep breath.

"Twenty spirit stones."

"Twenty spirit stones?!" Zhang Jing's voice rose involuntarily.

"Exactly. So tell me—are you confident? If you are, I'll raise the stakes and we'll split the winnings. If not, I'll find a way to weasel out."

"I am!"

Zhang Jing's answer was resolute.

As they spoke, their food arrived.

"Brother Zhang, try this," Ji Bochang urged.

Zhang Jing never hesitated to take advantage of free meals. He picked up a slice of spirit beast meat and chewed, mumbling, "Brother Ji, you should definitely raise the stakes. I'm absolutely certain I'll pass the assess—"

His words cut off abruptly.

The moment the spirit beast meat entered his mouth, a warm current surged through his limbs and bones.

His blood and qi churned.

At the same time, his previously depleted mental energy began to recover bit by bit.

"This is the effect of spirit beast meat?!"

Zhang Jing was stunned.

He suddenly saw a glimmer of hope for achieving Grade B!
