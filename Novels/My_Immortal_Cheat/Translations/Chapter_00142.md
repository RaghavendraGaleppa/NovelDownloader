Chapter 142: The Pantheon Opens

Zhou Tian waved his hand. Divine light surged in the void, thunder rumbled, and lightning flashed. His five fingers spread wide, expanding continuously until they could cover heaven and earth, grasping all the lightning. At his fingertips, lightning surged, incredibly terrifying! At this moment, his palm was as vast as a thundercloud, and each finger resembled a pillar propping up the sky, a truly awe-inspiring sight.

Zhou Tian's massive hand descended, refining all the lightning. Then, with a flip of his hand, as if heaven and earth were collapsing, ten thousand thunderous waterfalls cascaded from his palm. Zheng Yusheng's figure swayed precariously, like a small boat in a storm, struggling to protect himself.

As everyone expected, at the most crucial moment, the old man from the Fool appeared. With a flick of his white sleeve, all the lightning was swept away, and the world became calm. However, Zhou Tian's cultivation was, after all, copied from this elder. With equal strength, the old man didn't have it easy. A trace of lightning still leaked, instantly striking Zheng Yusheng. This was a mere aftershock of an Emperor-level attack, something Zheng Yusheng was far from able to withstand.

His body immediately shook violently, as if he were having a seizure, blood gushing uncontrollably from his mouth. Yet, as if by coincidence, Zheng Yusheng flew straight out of the arena. The moment he left the ring, several figures flew out from the void, quickly catching him. They pulled out glittering golden pills, fragrant with medicinal scent, and quickly forced them into his mouth.

"Senior, good thing I just reminded you, otherwise that guy would be a pile of dust right now." Zhou Tian showed no displeasure at the old man's appearance. After all, this was the other party's duty. He even feigned ignorance of his own subtle action of sending Zheng Yusheng out earlier, instead chuckling. "It's very difficult to kill that guy. There's also a Heavenly King from the Grand Luo Academy here, who could intervene even at the last moment."

"Young people nowadays are truly becoming more and more terrifying." The old man stroked his beard and let out a long laugh, very satisfied with Zhou Tian's attitude.

Zhou Tian smiled, saying little more. He knew his own business. He stepped out of the arena, walking straight past Zheng Yusheng's group without a second glance, merely saying faintly, "When he wakes up, don't forget to remind him about our wager."

The faces of those from the Grand Luo Academy turned ashen as they glared at Zhou Tian. However, victory and defeat were clear; anything more they said now would only invite ridicule. Everyone looked at him with complex expressions. They knew that from today onwards, Zhou Tian had become a towering mountain above them. Perhaps this was just one of Zhou Tian's divine abilities, perhaps it had various restrictions, but it was a genuine Emperor Realm presence. Even if it only lasted for a second, he could crush them with a single finger!

Zhou Tian reined in all his aura. As he walked up to Zhou Xunchuan and his group, the skill's duration just happened to end. Several new people had arrived: Li Xuanyi, Zhao Yuan, Wu, and Sun Dao. In the distance, Nan Qing, and several others, including Zhexian, also appeared, all staring at him with strange expressions.

"Why are you looking at me with such eyes?" Zhou Tian found it difficult to describe what kind of look it was; it was just plain strange, making his hair stand on end.

"Tsk, tsk, Zhou Tian, you've certainly hidden yourself well, old man. From now on, should we address you as 'Elder Zhou the Great'?" Zhou Zui spoke first. He had previously experienced Zhou Tian's skill, so he had some preparation, but he was still greatly startled today.

"No, look at you, talking like that. You're making me quite embarrassed." Zhou Tian scratched his head awkwardly. "If you're willing, I don't mind."

Before Zhou Xunchuan and the others could speak again, a thunderous roar came from the horizon. Several beams of light shot up into the sky from an extremely distant place. The sky seemed to have been torn open, light feathers drifted down between heaven and earth, lightning raged, and a turbulent river flowed from beyond the Nine Heavens. Waves of immense, boundless fluctuations echoed throughout the world.

"I, the Lord of Holy Gods, have returned!" A strange voice resonated through heaven and earth. The language was odd, yet everyone understood it. Holy light illuminated the world. The ethereal figure of a Holy Emissary with white wings on its back chanted sacred sounds, and a beam of light descended from the horizon. Zhou Tian knew that direction was towards Celer City, the Holy God Sect's stronghold.

The event was sudden. Everyone looked up at the sky, unsure what was happening. Only a handful of people had glinting eyes, seemingly in thought. Five figures had appeared in the void at some unknown point, their auras powerful and fierce. Zhou Changsheng was among them, as were the two Heavenly King-level beings who had escorted them, who had been recuperating from serious injuries and hadn't shown themselves until now.

"I, the God of Death, have returned!" Another voice rang out. Fiery red flowers bloomed across the void, a turbid river meandered, and incomplete souls with missing limbs wailed within it. A dark black beam of light descended.

"I, the Thunder God Lord, have descended!" Thunder dragons rolled ceaselessly as a beam of light entwined with purple lightning descended.

"I..." One voice after another rang out, with four more sounding, though their momentum wasn't as grand. Including the previous three, a total of seven voices reverberated between heaven and earth. As these voices sounded, the entire Forsaken God Land seemed to undergo a change. Light burst forth from deep beneath the earth. At the Kyushu encampment, a grand formation manifested, with golden patterns weaving across heaven and earth, blocking those beams of light.

In the direction of Myriad Gods Mountain, the constantly present beam of light underwent a new transformation. A massive phantom of a building slowly emerged, eventually solidifying into a physical structure. It was entirely bronze-colored, supported by several colossal bronze divine pillars. The specific details inside were not clearly visible.

Zhou Tian's heart skipped a beat. The Pantheon had appeared, truly opening at the moment several ancient gods descended.

"Everyone, return to your encampments!" Zhou Changsheng's voice came from high in the sky, accurately reaching everyone's ears.

The crowd exchanged glances and wasted no time. Zhou Tian took Tian Ling's hand. At this moment, he had no cultivation, so Tian Ling took him and flew away from the area.

The grand formation of the Kyushu encampment was fully activated. It had previously been only partially active, possessing limited power, but now it was completely unleashed. Patterns emerged on the eight colossal ancient cities, crisscrossing and connecting, while other smaller satellite cities, also crucial formation cores, glowed with divine light as they were activated. A truly massive grand formation unfolded completely. This was a method devised by Kyushu. The eight cities themselves were powerful formations, and after being improved by strong cultivators, they could connect and enhance each other, even possessing some of the might of a Heavenly Venerate-level grand formation. Were it not for the absence of some crucial components, one could say this *was* a Heavenly Venerate grand formation.
