# Chapter 72: Pressing Forward in One Go

In an instant, spiritual energy from the spirit stones rapidly surged into Chu Ning's body. After a short while, one of the spirit stones crumbled into dust, and Chu Ning immediately began absorbing another. This cycle repeated continuously.

Whenever he felt he had reached his cultivation limit, Chu Ning would eat some spiritual rice, take a brief break, or practice his Divine Refinement Technique and Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art.

For five days, Chu Ning devoted himself entirely to bitter cultivation. Consuming over thirty spirit stones daily, he frantically increased his proficiency in the Evergreen Wood Technique.

By the evening of the fifth day:
[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), Second Layer (499/900)]

"Just one step away from the sixth layer. Keep going!"

After a good night's sleep, Chu Ning woke early the next morning and began packing his belongings. Sitting on his bed, he suddenly opened his eyes, a glint of excitement flashing within.

"Qi Refinement sixth layer!"

At this moment, the sixth ring of spiritual power had formed within Chu Ning's dantian. He had broken through to the Qi Refinement sixth layer in one vigorous effort and stabilized his new realm.

"At least now I have another layer of self-preservation ability."

With a light exhale, Chu Ning stood up and used a cleansing technique to remove all the spirit stone dust from the room. Then, with a simple Rain Spell, he washed himself clean before drying off with another technique. Instantly, after five days of arduous cultivation, he felt completely refreshed.

Looking at his status:
[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), Second Layer (501/900)]

After reaching 500 proficiency and attaining the peak of Qi Refinement fifth layer, Chu Ning continued cultivating and absorbed the remaining four spirit stones. Now, his next goal was clear—when he broke through to Qi Refinement seventh layer, his Evergreen Wood Technique would advance from the second to the third layer.

This realization made Chu Ning ponder another question: when he fully mastered the second layer, would his golden finger refresh the talent reward? If so, could he exploit this by choosing a technique with six or seven layers for his next selection, thereby refreshing rewards multiple times?

After some thought, Chu Ning chuckled wryly, suspecting his golden finger wouldn't allow such loopholes. For now, he could only wait until he fully mastered the second layer to find out.

Turning his attention to packing, there wasn't much to prepare. The Seven Star Spirit Fruits, talismans, and his cultivation and talisman-making materials had long been stored in his spatial pouch. All that remained were a few changes of clothes and some spiritual rice—though after half a year of consumption, there wasn't much left to take.

Before leaving, Chu Ning took one last look around the courtyard now densely covered with ironvine. A strange sense of nostalgia washed over him. So much had changed in just over a year—from a newly examined Outer Sect Disciple of the Ding District to now skipping directly to the Bing District and then to the Outer Sect. His former neighbor Qi Chongmao had died by his hand, while the subsequent occupants Lu Yunfang and Luo Hongping had already moved to the Bing District.

With a wave of his hand, Chu Ning uprooted several ironvines and stored them in his spatial pouch. Then, without hesitation, he strode out of the courtyard toward the Outer Sect.

At the Outer Sect entrance, Chu Ning was the first to arrive. Soon, others began trickling in. From their conversations, he learned their identities and greeted them accordingly.

The group consisted of:
- From the Alchemy Hall: Gu Xiaoqing, a female disciple at Qi Refinement eighth layer—the highest among them.
- From the Artifact Refining Hall: Shen Zhengquan, a male disciple at Qi Refinement seventh layer.
- From the Spirit Beast Hall: Luo Yiping (male, Qi Refinement seventh layer) and Lu Miaoying (female, Qi Refinement fifth layer).

Shen Zhengquan explained that his purpose wasn't to refine artifacts at Yanji Market but to sell pre-made artifacts and scout for suitable materials. Meanwhile, Luo Yiping and Lu Miaoying would be responsible for purchasing and rearing low-level spirit beasts from rogue cultivators and minor cultivation clans in the area—such as the Gray Spirit Rabbit, whose meat could enhance cultivation, especially for Qi Refinement practitioners.

As the only representative from both the Spirit Plant Garden and Talisman Hall, Chu Ning naturally drew some curiosity. He truthfully explained his background as a former Outer Sect Disciple who showed talent in talisman-making, hence his dual assignment due to both departments being short-staffed.

Upon hearing his humble origins, the others showed mild surprise but quickly lost interest—especially since Chu Ning appeared to be only at Qi Refinement fourth layer and was known only for making basic low-grade talismans. In their eyes, he was the least noteworthy of the group, which suited Chu Ning's desire to remain inconspicuous.

While Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan vied for Gu Xiaoqing's attention—the elegant and highest-leveled female disciple—Chu Ning quietly observed everyone's demeanor, gauging their personalities.

After about half an incense stick's time, a gray-robed elder arrived—Lin Changqing, the Outer Hall supervisor responsible for Yanji Market and surrounding areas. The fifty-something elder wore a perpetually cold expression, acknowledging the disciples' greetings with only a faint hum.

"You're the last group," Lin Changqing stated impassively. "The others have already departed for their assigned markets. Since everyone's here, let's go."

Without waiting for responses, he summoned a flying vessel from his spatial pouch. The five disciples boarded, and with a wave of Lin Changqing's hand, the vessel soared into the sky, swiftly carrying them beyond the sect's boundaries.
