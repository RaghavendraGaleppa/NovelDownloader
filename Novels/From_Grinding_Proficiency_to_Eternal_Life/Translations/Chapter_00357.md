Chapter 357: You Want to Learn?

Xu Yunfan gazed at the iron-colored encampments of the Black Armor Army in the distance, his eyes as deep and calm as an abyss.

He withdrew his finger and turned to look at Li Haomiao, his gaze profound. "Haomiao, have you ever seen a field during spring plowing? When the weeds are overgrown, the farmer swings his hoe to cut away the roots. It looks like a scene of utter devastation, but once the new seedlings break through the soil, it becomes a vast expanse of green."

Li Haomiao frowned. He naturally understood what Xu Yunfan meant.

The current situation required that to seize the mandate of heaven in these chaotic times, one must first shatter the old world.

But behind the word 'shatter'..." He looked at the smoke rising from cooking fires under the setting sun in the distance, his voice hoarse. "How many lives must be sacrificed for it to be enough?"

"When did you become so indecisive?"

Xu Yunfan laughed dryly and shook his head slightly. If it were during the dynasty's heyday, with Li Haomiao's temperament, he would surely have been a benevolent ruler. But with heroes rising everywhere across the land, the only way to ascend the throne again was through iron-blooded slaughter.

Li Haomiao looked at the pool of blood on the ground not far away, slowly seeping into the cracks of the blue bricks, and suddenly remembered passing by a slum a few days ago where a child was digging through a pile of rubble for half a moldy flatbread.

Even at the foot of the Jade Capital, there were wandering refugees and beggars...

He closed his eyes for a moment, his voice slightly low. "I understand the logic. But knowing you must swing the sword and actually severing ten million threads of life... are two different things entirely."

Li Haomiao sighed. "It's not that I'm indecisive. Sometimes, understanding is one thing, but doing it is another. The impact of this will affect the entire world."

Xu Yunfan slowly walked to the edge of a collapsed wall, looking at a buried official from the Ministry of Works of the Great Zhou Dynasty, the setting sun's afterglow casting a golden edge around him.

"The people suffer when the state prospers, and they suffer when it perishes."

He pointed towards the northwest where the Black Armor Army was camped. "Which of those soldiers hasn't been exploited by the sects at home? The two southern provinces where the Incense Offering Sect operated just settled down, only for a drought to follow. Do you really think that was a natural disaster?"

"This world has been killing people all along; it's just using my hand to make it quicker!"

This statement left Li Haomiao speechless. This fallacious logic, yet he couldn't find a reason to refute it.

The rise and fall of a dynasty, the suffering of the common people—this has been the case since ancient times.

He had traveled through the martial world, and he had seen some things with his own eyes.

"These sects have been feeding on the people for so many years; today, they are merely reaping what they have sown. Look..."

Xu Yunfan suddenly clenched his fist, the pure true energy beneath his skin surging like a river, refining the last impurities of the Buddhist Pure Flame. "Once I pull that female demon from her throne and gather the Great Zhou's Dragon Vein and Xuanhuang Qi to break through the Ninth Realm's shackles..."

"By then, the people will naturally have a chance to recuperate. They won't have to sell their fields to buy 'Karma-Extinguishing Talismans' from the Maitreya Temple, nor pay all sorts of absurd taxes to the Sword Pavilion."

Li Haomiao remained silent. Xu Yunfan's words were naturally his own vision as well. Looking at the cracked fragments of the镇龙玺 (Zhenlong Seal) on the training platform, he suddenly asked, "If the 300,000 Black Armor Army were to launch a full-scale assault on the Great Zhou Imperial Court..."

"They cannot move. Against a Ninth Realm Qi Refining master, numbers are no longer an advantage. Brother Haomiao, these are the foundation for your future bid for the world. If most of them fall here, then it will truly be a chaotic world."

Xu Yunfan turned to face Li Haomiao. "The Empress's tiger tally cannot command their hearts. These border troops have long had enough of the imperial family and sects colluding to embezzle their pay. After tomorrow, I shall execute the Empress, and you shall use the Dao Sect's 'Qing Nang Book' to heal the wounded. These three hundred thousand men will be the foundation of the new dynasty."

Speaking of this, he suddenly smiled. "'In chaotic times, use severe laws.' Now, I cut away the rotten branches, and you plant the new trees. We are simply each performing our duties."

Li Haomiao remained silent for a long time, finally shaking his head with a bitter smile. "You madman... If you fail..."

"There is no failure."

Xu Yunfan interrupted him, his gaze like a torch. "The Grand Rite of Heaven is complete. The old hag is at the end of her rope, just struggling in her death throes. I will not fail, nor can I fail. The thousand-year fortune of the Dao Sect has been placed upon me. Success means ascending to the heavens; if one person achieves the Dao, even their chickens and dogs will ascend."

He patted Li Haomiao's shoulder. "At this time tomorrow, I will let you witness with your own eyes what true universal harmony is."

The night was as dark as ink. At the top of the Heaven Inquiry Pavilion, the highest point in the imperial city, Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, his robes snapping in the cold night wind.

The glazed tiles beneath his feet reflected a cold light. The lights of the Purple Extreme Hall in the distance flickered amidst the surging darkness, like a dormant ferocious beast.

"The Ten Extremities Martial Path has actually been walked into a Gluttony's Devouring True Path by you. This is quite a surprise to me."

An ancient voice rang out abruptly. The void three zhang behind Xu Yunfan suddenly darkened, and Dugu Jiu, his white hair like frost, stepped out from the emptiness.

A three-foot long sword without a scabbard hung at his waist. The blade was mottled like a dead branch, yet it made the surrounding moonlight seem to stagnate.

Xu Yunfan did not turn back. He simply lowered the hands he had crossed over his chest to grip the handle of his hammer, his fingers lightly tapping the handle of the Mountain Shaking Sea Suppressing Hammer. "What does Senior Dugu think?"

Dugu Jiu let out a cold laugh. "I thought you would follow my Sword Path. I didn't expect the Ten Extremities Martial Path to allow you to tread a demonic path."

"When I created the Ten Extremities Martial Path, I used Sword Intent as the bone and all methods as the edge."

Dugu Jiu's withered fingers stroked the long sword, and with a flick of his finger, a light sound resonated from the blade's spine. Instantly, nine flickering Sword Intents lit up, encompassing myriad forms, ever-changing and elusive.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, secretly surprised. This old man could actually fuse the true intents of various martial arts into one, raising a single Sword Intent.

"I never imagined the Ten Extremities Martial Path could walk such a path."

As he spoke, a fierce light shone in Dugu Jiu's eyes, sparkling with a look of inquiry, his expression slightly excited.

"I created the Ten Extremities Martial Path three hundred years ago, thinking it was only a path to open the Heavenly Gate..."

A sudden, hoarse laugh erupted from his throat, shaking the residual Sword Qi in his sleeves. "But I didn't expect it to have been turned by you into a demonic path that can absorb the essence of others!"

What demonic path? This was just a 'True Devouring' special effect derived from the Ten Extremities Martial Path on the Attribute Panel due to its concept of 'All Methods Return to One'.

Xu Yunfan secretly scoffed. Dugu Jiu called it a demonic path, but he looked even more excited than Xu Yunfan himself.

He didn't turn around, just tilted his face slightly, a hint of an inexplicable smile on his face.

"Senior, do you want to learn? I can teach you."

The night wind suddenly grew fierce, and the old man's white hair danced wildly like frenzied snakes.

He took a sudden step forward, and seven points of starlight burst forth from his sword's edge, showing a strange purple halo under the illumination of the Ten Extremities True Energy that spontaneously gushed out from Xu Yunfan.

Seeing this, Dugu Jiu's joy became even more uncontrollable.

"Good! A truly excellent 'All Methods Return to One'! If we could refine all the Ninth Realm Grandmasters in the world into fuel..."

He quickly retracted his Sword Intent, rubbing his hands together in extreme excitement.

"In this末法时代 (Era of Declining Methods) with its depleted spiritual energy, we might just be able to hack open a path to immortality!"

Moreover, he had been watching from the shadows during the day. What Xu Yunfan absorbed was not just the true energy of his opponents, but also the vital force and energy of their bodies.
