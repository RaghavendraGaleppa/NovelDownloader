# Chapter 1: Qingheng Sect - The Cultivation Jade Slate  

"Turns out I only have inferior spiritual roots."  

In the Tianmu Mountain Range.  
At Qingheng Mountain.  
Within the Qingheng Sect.  

Inside a medicinal herb garden, a young boy who appeared to be around thirteen or fourteen years old wore an expression of melancholy that didn't match his age.  

Zhang Yan, a newly recruited miscellaneous disciple of the Qingheng Sect, had just entered the sect and hadn't even begun his cultivation journey. Due to his inferior-grade spiritual roots—metal, water, and wood—he was assigned to the Spiritual Plantation Garden.  

"Even cultivating immortality is tough!" Zhang Yan couldn't help but grimace as he surveyed the plantation. Apart from the herb garden, there were only two thatched huts. In his previous life, he had studied relentlessly just to avoid farming. Yet, he had accidentally enrolled in an agricultural university. After twenty years of hard work, he had finally escaped the toil of working under the sun and wind—only to inexplicably wake up in this world, once again destined for a life of farming.  

Farming before struggling, farming after struggling.  
Farming before transmigrating, farming after transmigrating!  

Had all his efforts been for nothing? Had his transmigration been meaningless?  

*Creak—*  

Just as Zhang Yan was lost in thought, the sound of a door opening interrupted him. An elderly man with a hunched back emerged from one of the wooden huts.  

The old man appeared frail, around sixty or seventy years old, dressed in a worn-out Daoist robe that had been washed so many times it had turned stiff and pale. Several bulging pouches hung from his waist, their contents unknown.  

He stepped out, glanced at Zhang Yan, and spoke.  

"You're the new disciple?"  

"I am Zhang Yan. May I ask how I should address you?" Though the old man seemed unremarkable, Zhang Yan, being a newcomer, immediately put on a respectful demeanor.  

"Call me Elder Lin."  

"Understood, Elder Lin."  

"We're all miscellaneous disciples here—no need for such formality. Just complete your tasks on time." Perhaps because of his good nature or because Zhang Yan seemed obedient, Elder Lin's attitude was quite amiable.  

"What tasks do we have?"  

"We're spiritual planters, responsible for tending to spiritual crops. This plantation oversees 100 acres of low-grade spiritual fields—sowing and harvesting. The yield is split seventy-thirty."  

"Only thirty percent for us?"  

"Thirty percent is ours! The sect takes seventy!" Elder Lin glared at Zhang Yan before continuing, "Don't think thirty percent is little. Many would kill for this opportunity. Only as sect disciples do we get such favorable treatment."  

"According to the rules, the plantation's workload is divided based on the number of planters. Since you haven't started cultivating yet, you'll assist me for now. When it's time to harvest, I'll give you five percent." Stroking his snow-white beard, Elder Lin smiled at Zhang Yan.  

"Understood. Thank you, Elder Lin."  

Five percent.  

That amount was pitifully small.  

But there was no helping it. He wasn't a full-fledged spiritual planter yet and didn't have his own designated fields. For now, he could only serve as Elder Lin's apprentice.  

"Good, you're teachable!" Pleased with Zhang Yan's compliance, Elder Lin nodded and casually retrieved a jade slate from one of his pouches, handing it over.  

"These are the two cultivation techniques used in our plantation. Since you were assigned here, you must have a wood spiritual root," Elder Lin explained.  

"Thank you, Elder Lin." Hearing that it was a cultivation technique, Zhang Yan eagerly took the jade slate.  

But to his surprise—  

The moment he touched it, a prompt appeared before his eyes.  

**[Name]**: Cultivation Jade Slate  
**[Quality]**: Gray  
**[Equipment Effect]**: Minor Mastery of the *Evergreen Art*  
**[Equip?]**  

"This is…"  

"A cheat system!"  

Confirming that Elder Lin couldn't see the prompt, Zhang Yan swallowed hard.  

A golden finger!  

His golden finger had finally arrived!  

"Alright, you look excited. Go back to your hut and study the technique properly." Seeing Zhang Yan's reaction, Elder Lin assumed it was just the thrill of obtaining a cultivation method.  

This was normal.  

Decades ago, he had felt the same excitement when he first received his technique.  

But once the initial enthusiasm faded and reality set in, he realized that miscellaneous disciples rarely rose above their station. And so, he had spent decades toiling away in this small plantation.  

"Understood. Thank you, Elder Lin." Zhang Yan bowed deeply before hurrying into the smaller wooden hut in the plantation.  

Inside, the hut was surprisingly well-furnished—bedding, cooking utensils, tables, chairs—everything was in place.  

But Zhang Yan paid no attention to these things. His focus was entirely on the jade slate in his hand.  

"Equip!"  

His voice trembled with excitement.  

In an instant—  

The jade slate vanished from his hand.  

And his mind was flooded with sudden enlightenment.  

"So that's how it works."  

Zhang Yan murmured to himself. He now fully understood what was happening.  

For some unknown reason, after transmigrating to this world, he had gained an equipment interface.  

This interface allowed him to discern an item's quality and attributes. By equipping these items, he could gain their effects.  

For example, this jade slate—  

Once equipped, it granted him minor mastery of the *Evergreen Art*.  

Though the effect would disappear if he unequipped it, it still allowed him to rapidly grasp the technique and accelerate his progress.  

"But what exactly counts as equipment?" Zhang Yan frowned. The jade slate was a magical artifact. If all equipment had to be artifacts, then finding more would be difficult in the short term.  

"Forget it. I should focus on cultivation first."  

Cultivate, earn spirit stones—worry about equipment later.  

With that thought, Zhang Yan tidied up his hut before sitting cross-legged on a meditation cushion, ready to begin his cultivation.  

From the very first moment, he entered a deep state of focus. With each breath, faint traces of spiritual energy gathered around him.  

This was the effect of minor mastery in the *Evergreen Art*.  

His aptitude was poor—three inferior spiritual roots (metal, water, wood). Normally, his cultivation speed would be sluggish. But even prodigies had to start from scratch with their techniques, whereas Zhang Yan already had minor mastery.  

This accelerated his spiritual energy refinement.  

However, this boost was temporary. Once he unequipped the jade slate, it would disappear. And once those prodigies achieved minor mastery themselves, they would quickly surpass him.  

Still, for now, Zhang Yan held the advantage. At the very least, his current cultivation speed was on par with that of a mid-grade spiritual root.  

Among his three spiritual roots, his wood affinity was the strongest—only a hair's breadth away from mid-grade. Combined with the technique's enhancement, he wouldn't fall behind in the short term.  

As for the future?  

That would depend on fate.
