# Chapter 28: Luo Li  

After listening to the middle-aged merman's account, Chen Daoxuan fell silent.  

"Senior, you mean you wish to purchase magical artifacts from our family?"  

"Exactly."  

The middle-aged merman nodded.  

After a moment of contemplation, Chen Daoxuan shook his head. "Senior, I'm afraid I cannot agree to your request."  

Hearing this, before the middle-aged merman could respond, Luo Li, standing beside him, grew anxious. "Why not? Is it because the price we offered isn't enough? If so, we can—"  

Before she could finish, Chen Daoxuan smiled bitterly and shook his head again.  

"It's not that, miss."  

He paused briefly before continuing, "After all, your merfolk and our humans belong to different races. If your people were to use the artifacts purchased from our Chen Family to slaughter human cultivators, not only would our conscience be troubled, but the Qian Yuan Sword Sect would never let our family off the hook."  

At this explanation, both the middle-aged merman and the female merman named Luo Li fell silent.  

Different races—there was no room for negotiation.  

"Then aren't you afraid I might kill you?"  

Seeing this, the middle-aged merman issued a veiled threat.  

"Senior, you certainly could kill me," Chen Daoxuan replied, his gaze unwavering. "But like the Zhou Family, our Chen Family is a vassal clan under the Qian Yuan Sword Sect. If you commit such an atrocity, the sect will surely seek justice for us in the future.  

"Moreover, senior, I am a weapon refiner. If you understand how much the Qian Yuan Sword Sect values refiners and alchemists, you’ll know my words hold weight!"  

As he spoke, Chen Daoxuan glared at the merman with a fearless expression.  

Seeing that Chen Daoxuan had suddenly become unyielding, the middle-aged merman felt somewhat at a loss.  

Deep down, his merfolk clan had no desire to make enemies of humanity.  

After all, humans were the absolute rulers of this world. His merfolk couldn’t even defeat the small Zhou Family, let alone contend with a behemoth like the Qian Yuan Sword Sect.  

But sometimes, even if you didn’t want to make enemies, others would still oppress you.  

Take the Zhou Family of Guang'an Prefecture, for example.  

To cultivate spirit pearls, they had no qualms about capturing merfolk women en masse and even imprisoning merfolk men as breeding stock, forcing them to reproduce and serve the Zhou Family as slaves for generations.  

For centuries, the merfolk had rebelled countless times, but each attempt ended in failure.  

This time, their resistance was the largest in scale, yet the Zhou Family still crushed them effortlessly.  

With no other choice, the middle-aged merman had to lead his clan in a mass migration to escape the Zhou Family’s pursuit.  

It was precisely because of this that they had encountered Chen Daoxuan’s cargo ship along the way.  

After a long silence, the middle-aged merman spoke solemnly, "I can swear on behalf of my Luo Clan that we will never use any artifact purchased from your Chen Family to kill a single human."  

A Great Dao Oath!  

Hearing this vow, Chen Daoxuan was moved.  

In this world, the Great Dao Oath was one of the most binding vows a cultivator could make. The only other oath of comparable severity was the Nether Blood Oath, but that was far more sinister—even without breaking it, the backlash could be lethal. Thus, few dared to swear such a dire pledge.  

Seeing the middle-aged merman take this oath, Chen Daoxuan sensed that the situation had reached a turning point.  

Pushing further might backfire.  

After some thought, he asked, "If I may ask, since your merfolk won’t use these artifacts against humans, why insist on purchasing them from our Chen Family?"  

Hearing this, Luo Li couldn’t help but retort, "Do you think every race lives as comfortably as humans, free from external threats? My people dwell in the deep sea, where demonic beasts and other hostile races abound. Without the means to defend ourselves, the only fate awaiting my clan is extinction!"  

As she spoke, the stunningly beautiful mermaid’s eyes dimmed with sorrow.  

Forced into migration by the Zhou Family, they would inevitably clash with other deep-sea races. She had no idea how many of her kin would perish in the coming battles.  

The thought made her expression grow even more despondent.  

Chen Daoxuan couldn’t fully grasp the hardships of the merfolk, but the demonic beast uprising in Changping County had taught him that danger was ever-present—especially in the deep sea.  

After pretending to deliberate for a moment, Chen Daoxuan reluctantly nodded.  

"Very well. Since your merfolk won’t use these weapons against humans, this transaction can proceed. However, the exact price still needs careful discussion."  

With that, he retrieved two flying swords from his storage pouch—one of low-grade and one of mid-grade quality.  

"Take a look."  

He handed the swords over.  

The two examined them carefully. Luo Li frowned. "These weapons are both inferior to the one you showed us earlier."  

Chen Daoxuan smiled. "Naturally. The price varies with the artifact’s grade."  

He then turned to the middle-aged merman. "For example, the artifact that wounded you earlier would be priceless!"  

Hearing this, the middle-aged merman recalled the flying sword Zhou Mubai had used and nodded in agreement. "Indeed, such a weapon would be beyond valuation."  

Luo Li’s eyes brightened with hope. "Does your Chen Family have treasures like that for sale?"  

"Ahem."  

Chen Daoxuan coughed awkwardly. "You jest, miss. Even if our family possessed artifacts of that caliber, I doubt you could afford them."  

"That’s true..."  

Luo Li’s voice trailed off.  

Not wanting the conversation to stray further, Chen Daoxuan quickly steered it back.  

"These three artifacts are of low-grade, mid-grade, and high-grade quality, respectively. Their prices are 500, 1,000, and 2,000 spirit stones. Currently, our Chen Family can mass-produce only the low-grade ones—the ones priced at 500 spirit stones."  

When he quoted the price of 500 spirit stones for the low-grade flying sword, Chen Daoxuan nearly choked on his own words.  

Just as he braced himself for the merfolk to haggle, Luo Li exclaimed in delight, "This weapon costs only 500 of these broken stones? That’s far too cheap! And this one—only 2,000 stones? Are you afraid of us and deliberately lowering the price?"  

At this valuation, Luo Li’s impression of Chen Daoxuan soared.  

To her, humans were clearly not all the same. Compared to the wicked Zhou Family, this young man before her seemed like a saint.  

Hearing her reaction, Chen Daoxuan realized he might have vastly underestimated the wealth of the deep-sea world.  

In fact, all cultivators in the Ten Thousand Stars Sea had likely overlooked the immense riches hidden beneath the ocean.  

But upon reflection, this made sense.  

While cultivators boasted of soaring through the skies and burrowing into the earth, low-level cultivators lacked the power to mine the depths of the ocean.  

From what Chen Daoxuan understood, this world was nothing like the spherical Earth of his past life—its vastness was incomparable.  

Similarly, the depth of its oceans was beyond imagination.  

As a result, the meager spiritual energy of low-level cultivators couldn’t withstand the crushing pressures of the deep sea.  

Thus, the idea of exploiting the ocean’s resources remained a fantasy.  

But the merfolk were different. Their innate racial gifts allowed them to thrive in the deep sea—a privilege other land-dwelling races could only envy.  

At this thought, Chen Daoxuan’s gaze toward Luo Li suddenly burned with fervent interest.
