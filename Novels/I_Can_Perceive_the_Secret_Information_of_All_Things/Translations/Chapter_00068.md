# Chapter 68: Foundation Establishment  

Obtaining the synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill meant Xiao Ji was now a quasi-Foundation Establishment cultivator. When to ascend depended entirely on his own decision.  

When it came to Foundation Establishment, one could either find a secluded place to break through or spend some money to complete the process within the safety of Taigu City.  

Xiao Ji preferred the latter. After all, Taigu City offered security, and the Foundation Establishment facilities there were fully equipped.  

The expenses were covered by Qian Duoyu. Back in the Jiuyou Valley, he had promised Xiao Ji a gift. Unsure of what to give, he simply paid for Xiao Ji's Foundation Establishment venue.  

Xiao Ji didn’t decline. If he could ascend more safely, why bother hiding away?  

The design of Taigu City’s Foundation Establishment grounds was quite thoughtful, offering various settings for guests.  

He chose a ruins-themed environment.  

"Fellow Daoist, after consuming the Foundation Establishment Pill, remember to stay focused. Do not move midway. If you need anything, just call out, and I’ll handle it," the Taigu City cultivator said with excellent service.  

Such was the power of spending money.  

Xiao Ji observed the graceful figure of the female attendant, listened to her soothing voice, and noted her rather revealing attire, feeling quite at ease.  

"Understood. Though, I’m not sure what I’d need to do midway—I have no experience," Xiao Ji admitted honestly.  

"Ah, your first time, then?" The young-looking female attendant’s eyes gleamed with a different light. "No worries. Most people succeed on their first try. The key is to relax and not get too nervous. If you’re overly tense, it’s easy to lose control and ruin everything."  

"But even if you fail, it’s fine. With experience, you’ll eventually succeed on your second or third attempt. Never give up—always believe in yourself."  

Foundation Establishment wasn’t as simple as consuming a high-quality pill. Success depended on probability, as well as one’s innate talent and comprehension.  

Thus, in the cultivation world, many Foundation Establishment cultivators didn’t succeed on their first try but only after multiple attempts.  

"Thank you," Xiao Ji said after a moment’s thought. "Since this is my first time, I’d appreciate your guidance."  

"Don’t worry. You won’t need to lift a finger—leave everything to me," the female attendant replied with a sweet smile. "I’m very professional. I’ve assisted many people before."  

"Experience is good," Xiao Ji said, still somewhat nervous despite her reassurance. "If both of us were nervous, things could go wrong."  

His nervousness wasn’t about fearing failure—he was confident in his control over the situation.  

What truly unsettled him was the attendant herself. Despite her claims of experience and many successful assists, he knew better.  

Those were just pre-prepared lines from Taigu City’s script. Every attendant here recited the same thing.  

They made you believe they were seasoned experts, but in reality, most were newcomers.  

And as everyone knew, newcomers often lacked experience and were prone to mistakes.  

From what he could sense, this attendant would cause him significant trouble, severely affecting his Foundation Establishment.  

**[Taigu City Foundation Establishment Attendant – Newly arrived in Taigu City. She will snore during your breakthrough, disrupting your Dao heart.]**  

With such a warning, there was no need for her assistance.  

"How about this?" Xiao Ji said with an apologetic smile. "I’ll handle it myself. You can attend to other matters."  

"Why?" The attendant was puzzled. "Doing it alone is exhausting."  

Wasn’t it better to have someone assist during Foundation Establishment?  

"It might be tiring, but it’ll be more rewarding—after all, it’s my own effort," Xiao Ji replied.  

"That’s not a convincing reason. Don’t worry, Daoist, I’ll ensure your satisfaction," the attendant insisted, reluctant to leave since this was her job.  

"Well, the real reason is… I prefer someone older," Xiao Ji said casually, hoping to hasten her departure. "Don’t worry about payment. My friend outside will cover your service fee."  

That friend was Qian Duoyu, who was adamant about seeing Xiao Ji after his breakthrough.  

Once the attendant left, Xiao Ji found a comfortable spot in the ruins—a half-collapsed tower—and sat cross-legged, circulating his qi.  

He swallowed the synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill, allowing his spiritual energy to digest it. A warm current spread through his limbs, filling his entire body with heat.  

A luminous aura enveloped him as swirling spiritual energy continuously poured into his body.  

"I feel like I’m about to explode," Xiao Ji muttered, sensing the overwhelming energy.  

An hour later, the accumulated spiritual energy within him had reached a critical point.  

He considered releasing some, fearing he might genuinely burst.  

**[Spiritual energy is sufficient. Releasing it will cause Foundation Establishment to fail. Maintain control, and success will follow. Hold steady.]**  

So that’s how it worked. Without guidance, Xiao Ji grasped the fundamental principle of Foundation Establishment.  

"I need to compress the spiritual energy into my dantian, condensing it into a solid form that merges with my body. That’s how the foundation is built."  

Xiao Ji began compressing the vast spiritual energy he had absorbed.  

If Foundation Establishment were visualized, it would resemble the foundation of a building. All future cultivation—whether absorbing techniques or utilizing spiritual energy—would rely on this base.  

For cultivators in this world, those with a water spiritual root would incorporate water-aligned materials during Foundation Establishment.  

Since Xiao Ji’s spiritual root was indeterminate, he could only use all-purpose spiritual energy, allowing him to manipulate all five elements later.  

When the compression reached its peak, a burst of violet light erupted from Xiao Ji’s body, obliterating everything around him—including his clothes.  

He slowly opened his eyes, sensing the drastic transformation of his body. His control over spiritual energy had become effortless.  

With a flick of his finger, a fireball materialized and incinerated a withered tree.  

A wave of his hand summoned dark clouds overhead, unleashing a torrential downpour over the burning wood.  

Rising to his feet, he spread his arms, and the earth before him split open with a deep fissure.  

"So this is Foundation Establishment," Xiao Ji murmured, exhilarated. "Far stronger than I imagined. With the right techniques, the effects could be even more formidable."  

In high spirits after his success, Xiao Ji eagerly headed for the exit.  

Just as he was about to leave, the dejected attendant stopped him at the door.  

"I already said your payment is guaranteed. My friend will cover it," Xiao Ji reminded her.  

"That’s not what I meant," the attendant said, blushing as she stared at him. "You can’t go out like this. At least put on some clothes. Even just one piece."  

Xiao Ji had once again lost his clothes during his breakthrough. Now, he stood in unabashed nudity.  

Unfazed, he simply apologized, "An accident, I assure you. These rags are the only clothing I could find here."
