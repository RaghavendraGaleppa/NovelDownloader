**Chapter 117: Breaking Through Like a Hot Knife Through Butter**  

"Is that Junior Brother Zhang Jing?" a short man beside Huang Jingtong murmured, his voice laced with complex emotions—astonishment, disappointment, but mostly thick envy.  

Why was comprehending Dao Intent, a feat as difficult as scaling the heavens in their eyes, as effortless as eating and drinking for him?  

"The heavens truly favor some," he sighed inwardly.  

"But to challenge the Heavenly Staircase after only half a month in the Ninth Void Heaven? Tsk, such is the arrogance of a prodigy. However, the Heavenly Staircase here isn’t like the lower levels. Junior Brother Zhang Jing is in for a rough time."  

A smirk crept onto his face as he prepared to watch the show.  

At that moment—  

A streak of golden light froze abruptly three zhang away from Zhang Jing, revealing a crystalline skeletal figure. The golden divine flames in its hollow eye sockets flickered out.  

A tall man in black robes gasped, his breathing growing heavy. The skeletal body, once impervious to water and fire, unbreakable by blade or spear, was now riddled with cracks.  

A faint smile flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.  

Huang Jingtong jerked his head up, his pupils contracting sharply.  

From the hollow sockets of the diminutive skeleton opposite Zhang Jing, two golden flames ignited. Dark golden Dao patterns rapidly spread across its bones, exuding an indestructible aura.  

And now—  

He never imagined this junior brother would charge straight to the eighth level of the Heavenly Staircase.  

*Spiritual Essence increased by 500,000!*  

"P-e-r-f-e-c-t D-a-o I-n-t-e-n-t!"  

A chorus of agonized shrieks suddenly erupted.  

Hearing this—  

Zhang Jing’s gaze settled on the slowly reviving three-headed, four-armed guardian spirit.  

In a flash of rainbow light—  

He paid no attention to the Spiritual Essence.  

"Senior Brother, you weren’t lying to me?"  

*Whoosh—*  

In the face of comprehended Dao Intent, the presence or absence of a Dao Foundation made all the difference.  

Spiritual energy erupted from his dantian!  

The remaining five exchanged glances before following suit.  

How could a Qi Refining cultivator who hadn’t even laid his Dao Foundation hope to catch up to those ranked on the True Spirit List?  

Witnessing this, the six of them shared a single, terrifying thought:  

*He must clear these Heavenly Staircases as quickly as possible and reach the Tenth Void Heaven.*  

Yet—  

It sent an inexplicable shiver of dread down their spines!  

"Senior Brother Huang, since you’re also from Longhu Dao Academy, you must know which Dao Intent Junior Brother Zhang Jing has comprehended, right?"  

---  

**Chapter 117: Breaking Through Like a Hot Knife Through Butter**  

Yet, in their line of sight—  

Wait!  

After slaying the guardian spirit of the eighth step, Junior Brother Zhang Jing’s expression remained utterly calm.  

The small skeleton transformed into a streak of golden light, darting toward Zhang Jing.  

Huang Jingtong seemed to realize something. He turned abruptly, his voice tinged with envy:  

*The sixth level!*  

A Dao pattern flickered in Zhang Jing’s palm.  

No—  

That three-headed, four-armed spirit, which had once given him so much trouble, had just been effortlessly slain by Zhang Jing.  

The six observers stood frozen in shock, their eyes blank, as if unable to believe what they were seeing.  

The remaining man stared at Zhang Jing with reverence—and a trace of fear.  

An invisible wind turned pitch-black, carrying an unfathomable chill that sought to freeze flesh and soul alike.  

What was this?  

The tall man in black suddenly turned to Huang Jingtong, curiosity in his voice.  

Even in the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven, where everyone was at the peak of Qi Refining’s tenth layer—  

Meanwhile—  

Huang Jingtong spoke word by word, his voice hoarse.  

Or rather, five of them stood dumbfounded.  

Zhang Jing’s mind connected to a place of extreme cold, desolation, and silence.  

Senior Brother Huang wasn’t wrong. He was only half a step away from comprehending Dao Intent. If he could witness it firsthand now, perhaps he could make a breakthrough.  

Seeing Zhang Jing’s astonishing feat of conquering four Heavenly Staircase levels in succession—  

And it was so... small.  

The Tenth Void Heaven was clearly the domain of superior Dao Foundations.  

A boundless wind arose from nothingness, tearing through the thick mist surrounding them as it swept toward the golden light approaching Zhang Jing.  

But then—  

They noticed Zhang Jing smiling faintly at them before transforming into a rainbow streak, soaring upward and vanishing in an instant.  

From nothingness to the complete comprehension of a perfect Dao Intent.  

Nine months!  

The black wristband around Zhang Jing’s arm detached at his will, morphing into a dark, serpentine dragon.  

Among the towering shadows, a skeletal figure barely four or five chi tall squeezed forward, its dark hue fading to reveal bones as smooth and lustrous as mutton-fat jade.  

Huang Jingtong’s mind gradually recovered, but the shock on his face lingered.  

Just how far could this junior brother climb?  

Ahead—  

Without hesitation.  

As if by instinct.  

Such a monster truly existed!  

*The fourth level of the Heavenly Staircase.*  

---  

**Chapter 117: Breaking Through Like a Hot Knife Through Butter**  

Could this junior brother be aiming to reach the Tenth Void Heaven in one go?  

Beside the man—  

But he was only at Qi Refining!  

In the blink of an eye—  

The more formidable the perfected Taiyin Dragon Serpent Dao Intent appeared, the more Zhang Jing’s curiosity and anticipation for the so-called "Great Dao of Heavenly Immortality" grew.  

Zhang Jing didn’t pause for even a moment.  

"This is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for you. Observe Junior Brother Zhang Jing carefully—you might just break through that half-step barrier and comprehend Dao Intent."  

The six of them shuddered.  

The black-robed man frowned in confusion.  

Zhang Jing recalled that the last time he reached the fourth step, his welcoming party hadn’t been this petite skeleton.  

"If this were half a month ago, I might’ve feared you."  

As Zhang Jing pondered—  

Sensing the terrifying aura emanating from the figure—  

"Changed again?"  

A glint of seriousness flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes.  

But was it even possible?!  

"So this is the Taiyin Dragon Serpent Dao Intent?"  

Under the black wind infused with Taiyin energy—  

The six lifted their heads in unison.  

None of the guardian spirits could hinder his unwavering advance.  

"Junior Brother Zhan, your chance has come!"  

Zhang Jing’s figure vanished.  

*The eighth step!*  

He had already become one of the strongest in the Ninth Void Heaven, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them.  

Zhang Jing landed softly at the center.  

Vast amounts of Taiyin energy were drawn forth, merging with the raging winds.  

Zhang Jing extended his left hand, fingers splayed, and pushed forward slowly.  

At this thought—  

Only here did things begin to get interesting.  

Unless—  

The moment the words left his lips—  

"What do you mean, Senior Brother?"  

"Pity, Skeleton Brother, you’re a bit late to the party."  

Then—  

He transformed into a streak of rainbow light, shooting toward the ninth step.  

They were all curious.  

"Junior Brother, you might not know, but I recall that the superior cultivation method Junior Brother Zhang Jing practices is the *Ocean-Subduing Dragon Seizing Void True Method*, corresponding to the Taiyin Dragon Serpent Dao Intent—exactly the same as your path!"  

*The fifth step!*  

This meant—  

In the brief moment he had been distracted—  

Now, he had only one thought.  

His eyes remained fixed on Zhang Jing atop the Heavenly Staircase. Unconsciously, he drifted forward, afraid that stepping back would obscure his view.
