# Chapter 393: The Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm

"Senior Brother."

Xu Tian knelt three丈 (zhang) away, his gaze trembling as he looked at the profound halo circulating around Xu Yunfan.

He saw how the latter's breathing drew in the essence of the sun and moon, and how his every movement resonated with the rhythm of heaven and earth. Though he had yet to obtain the true scripture or proper methods, his imposing aura was as stable as a mountain or a deep abyss, not one bit inferior to the direct disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Those direct disciples of the peak masters who were at the Great Perfection of the Qi Condensation realm—peak Foundation Establishment True Lords—had at most this kind of presence.

His voice trembled. "Tomorrow is the New Moon. The Realm Gate will open. The time for the retrospective has arrived."

Xu Yunfan slowly retracted his cultivation, the starlight in his eyes gradually fading.

Over the past three months, he had been comprehending the *True武 (Martial) Swallowing Demons True Scripture* day and night. Although he had been unable to make a breakthrough because the meridians in his body were vastly different from those of upper-realm cultivators, he had already grasped the key points.

He only needed a single Meridian Opening Pill, combined with the *Hundred Meridians Penetrating Yin Technique* to reshape his meridians. In an instant, he would be able to pierce the Xuan Pass, enter the threshold of this scripture, and rapidly advance it to the Minor Achievement stage.

This was the confidence brought by the accumulation of his entire life.

"Let's go. From today onward, you and I are fellow disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect."

On the night of the New Moon, a purple-black fissure tore open the sky of the Divine Martial World.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back before the Realm Gate. Behind him knelt Xu Tian and seven other Primordial Origin Sect disciples whose soul thoughts had been forced out by Xu Yunfan.

These unlucky fellows who had come looking for him one after another had now become the best identity cover.

The sky on the New Moon's night was torn open by a purple-black fissure, like a wound cut open by an invisible blade.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back before the Realm Gate, his robes fluttering violently in the chaotic void currents.

The seven Primordial Origin Sect disciples, their soul thoughts forced out, knelt on the ground, their faces as pale as paper.

"Remember your identities."

Xu Yunfan did not turn back, his voice as cold as ice. "If there is the slightest flaw..."

"Rest assured, Senior Brother!"

Xu Tian hurriedly kowtowed, his forehead touching the cold rock. "Our souls are already in your hands. We would never dare to have treacherous thoughts!"

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched almost imperceptibly.

Over these days, under the pretext of interrogation, he had already figured out the basic situation of the Primordial Origin Sect completely.

The Hundred Desires Peak, the White Mountain Peak, the Dust-Clad Peak... The open and covert strife between the various factions was the best cover for him.

Most importantly, the Divine Martial World was not very conspicuous within the Primordial Origin Sect; it was merely used for harvesting blood food. Although a Divine Martial True Lord had once emerged from here, that was several thousand years ago.

The disciples before him, without exception, had been proven to be the lowest-level marginal disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect through mutual accusation and exposure.

Most of them had entered this world while burdened with heavy debts.

These borrowed "Realm Gate passage fees" needed to be repaid by hunting the ninth-rank Qi Condensation martial artists of the Divine Martial World.

If they could successfully harvest the blood and flesh essence of three or five supreme grandmasters of the ninth-rank Qi Condensation, they would not only be able to clear their debts but also make a considerable profit.

Unfortunately, they had met Xu Yunfan; it could be said they were quite unlucky.

The space at the Realm Gate suddenly distorted, and a pink colored light surged out from the fissure.

From within the colored light stepped out a woman wearing a semi-transparent crimson dress. A dot of cinnabar was between her eyebrows, and her eyes seemed to hold a thousand charms. Her every movement revealed her graceful, naked body, yet the vital parts were shrouded in mist, indistinct and unclear, causing the disciples who looked up to have only one thought flash through their minds.

They wanted to go deeper.

But before them was a Foundation Establishment True Lord. Although their hearts were seething with thoughts, they did not dare to reveal the slightest expression.

"Hundred Desires Peak's Bai Hua greets the True Lord."

Xu Tian and the others immediately prostrated themselves, their voices trembling.

Xu Yunfan's heart tightened. He immediately followed their example to bow, not showing any signs of his strength. The Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Technique, cultivated to its extreme, operated with all its might.

True Lord Bai Hua's gaze was like a knife, sweeping over each person one by one.

When that gaze fell on Xu Yunfan, he felt a chill run through his entire body, as if all his disguises had been stripped away, and even his bone marrow had been seen through completely.

The Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Technique was useless!

Of course, it was just a martial art from the Divine Martial World; how could it escape the discerning eyes of a Foundation Establishment True Lord?

His heart moved slightly. The *Ten Extreme Martial Paths* operated frantically within his body, ten completely different true qi characteristics interweaving and changing within his flesh and blood.

The hardness and softness of Dragon and Tiger Pill Qi, the scorching heat of Pure Yang True Qi, the vastness of the Nine Lumens Swallowing Qi...

The essence of the martial arts from the various sects of the Divine Martial World had now become the best cover.

"Hm?"

True Lord Bai Hua suddenly let out a soft exclamation, her gaze lingering on Xu Yunfan for an extra moment.

Xu Yunfan's back was instantly drenched in cold sweat.

He could feel a strand of divine sense roaming within his body, like a snake probing every inch of his meridians.

The only thing worth being grateful for was that the Martial Dao Profound Crystal was obscure and profound, possessing a unique mystery of its own; the other party had not detected it at all.

"Interesting."

True Lord Bai Hua suddenly laughed softly, the corners of her red lips curving into a playful arc. "When did the White Mountain Peak produce such a disciple?"

"I am about to formally join the sect!" Xu Yunfan immediately took off the Primordial Origin Token from his waist.

True Lord Bai Hua's eyes shifted as she looked Xu Yunfan up and down.

"Since you haven't formally joined a master yet, and your physique is quite good, then come join me under the Hundred Desires Peak."

Before the words had fully fallen, she had already turned and walked deeper into the Realm Gate, leaving behind only a faint, lingering fragrance.

What could Xu Yunfan do? The other party did not allow for refusal.

"...Thank you for your favor, True Lord!"

Xu Yunfan slowly let out a breath of turbid air, only then realizing that his fingers were trembling slightly.

The pressure of a Foundation Establishment True Lord was actually so terrifying!

"Senior Brother, you have good fortune."

Xu Tian sidled over, his expression somewhat envious. "The Hundred Desires Peak practices the way of dual cultivation and draining Yin and Yang. There are no exceptions on the Hundred Desires Peak; everyone is a handsome man or a beautiful woman. You primarily cultivate the Martial Dao, your physique and blood essence are strong and vigorous, you will definitely be in great demand..."

"Shut up."

Xu Yunfan coldly interrupted him and strode towards the Realm Gate.

Right now, he only wanted to leave the line of sight of this dangerous person as quickly as possible.

Looking at the fissure before him, Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. He turned his head to look at the mountains and rivers of the Divine Martial World. In the far distance, he could still vaguely see the shadow of the Qingwei Mountain of the Dao Sect. He took one last, deep look back, then passed through the Realm Gate without turning his head.

In an instant, Xu Yunfan felt as if the sky and the earth were spinning.

When he opened his eyes again, the scene before him made him hold his breath.

The sky was washed clean, a blue so deep it was almost transparent.

In the distance, mountains rose and fell, the snow on the peaks shimmering like diamonds in the sunlight.

What was most shocking was the spiritual energy permeating the air, so dense it almost condensed into mist. Every breath felt like drinking down the nectar of the gods.

"Is this the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm?"

Xu Yunfan murmured to himself.

Compared to the turbid and thin spiritual energy of the Divine Martial World, the spiritual energy here was pure to the point of being outrageous.

The true qi in his body began to boil uncontrollably, and every pore was greedily absorbing the dense spiritual energy around him.

"Be careful, Senior Brother!"

Xu Tian suddenly cried out in alarm, feigning concern. "When you first come into contact with pure spiritual energy, you need to adapt slowly. If your body can't take it, you might explode and die."

*Hurry up and die, just die!* Xu Tian roared in his heart. He naturally knew just how greedy the natives of these worlds would be when entering the Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm.
