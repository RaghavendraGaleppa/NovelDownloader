**Chapter 223: Post-Heaven Purple Qi, Karma Reversion**

Time flowed gently. Unconsciously, three months had passed.

Sanjuan City remained as usual, with no significant changes. Cultivators and mortals still pursued their respective paths, either cultivating or toiling, repeating a monotonous life that had been the same for thousands of years.

Perhaps some people paid attention to recent major events. For instance, the Cyan Feather Army had once again marched to the Spirit Pivot Mountain battlefield. Although suffering heavy casualties, they had returned victorious. But these were only a minority of a minority. For the rest, living well was the top priority.

This day.

"Young Master is out for a stroll again, same as usual?"

On the street, a short, sweaty man put down his carrying pole. When he saw Zhang Jing slowly approaching, he couldn't help but grin honestly and greet him warmly.

"Still two steamed buns, please," Zhang Jing nodded, smiling.

"Alright! Two steamed buns, Young Master, please take them carefully, they're hot!" The man carefully took out the already wrapped steamed buns, shouting cheerfully. His face always beamed with a bright smile.

Zhang Jing took the steamed buns with one hand. As he was about to pay, the short man repeatedly waved his hands, respectfully saying, "Young Master, please just take them and eat. Don't worry about the money. I heard you donated silver again yesterday to build bridges and roads for our Qingyue Ward. Though I'm a crude man, I understand gratitude. Young Master, your willingness to eat my family's steamed buns already makes me incredibly happy, so how could I possibly accept money?"

"Haha, Uncle Wu, you earn your money through hard work. You should still accept it," Zhang Jing insisted on handing over the silver. However, no matter how much he tried to persuade him, the short man refused to accept it.

Having no choice, Zhang Jing had to give up. After a series of thanks, he picked up the steamed buns and turned to leave. However, before he had walked two steps, Zhang Jing seemed to remember something and looked at the man again, asking curiously, "Uncle Wu, we've known each other for a month or two now, but I still don't know your name?"

Hearing this, the short man rubbed the back of his head, somewhat awkwardly saying, "A humble person like me, what name could I have? Because I'm the eldest in my family, everyone calls me Wu Dalang. I've made Young Master laugh."

As soon as these words were spoken, the expression on Zhang Jing's face became even stranger. He asked quietly, "Then do you have a younger brother named Wu Erlang?"

"Young Master, you truly have divine foresight. My brother is no ordinary man; he's been incredibly strong since childhood, exceptionally gifted. Now he's an infantryman in the Cyan Feather Army. It's just that he rarely gets to come home."

Speaking of his own brother, a hint of pride instantly appeared on Wu Dalang's honest, dark face.

"Is your wife named Pan Jinlian?"

"Young Master, you even know this?" Wu Dalang widened his eyes, looking at Zhang Jing in disbelief. For a moment, he was amazed as if encountering a celestial being.

However, across from him, the shock in Zhang Jing's heart was no less than the other's. "It really is! Is it a coincidence? But... how could it be such a coincidence? This is the Clear Sky Profound Brightness Realm, not my previous life!"

At this moment, for some reason, Zhang Jing's spiritual sense began to frantically warn him, and even the jade talisman within his Niwan Palace started vibrating incessantly. Everything seemed to be telling him: *Leave this place quickly, do not get involved, or you will die!* There was a great terror within this. It was not something he could currently handle.

After a long while, Zhang Jing unconsciously took a deep breath, his gaze gradually returning to calm.

"Young Master, what's wrong?" Wu Dalang asked with concern.

"Ah, it's nothing, just thought of some old memories." Zhang Jing waved his hand, giving a perfunctory reply, then reminded him, "Uncle Wu, remember to be careful of a person named Ximen Qing."

Having said that, without waiting for Wu Dalang's reply, Zhang Jing was about to leave.

But at this moment, Li Jiu, dressed in official robes, suddenly appeared in sight. The moment he saw Zhang Jing, Li Jiu was slightly startled, then quickly trotted to Zhang Jing's front, respectfully saying, "Li Jiu greets Your Excellency. Thank you, Your Excellency, for your assistance last time; my son was able to survive the Spirit Pivot Mountain battlefield because of it. Another day, Li Jiu will certainly bring my son to your residence to express our gratitude."

As he spoke, Li Jiu unconsciously looked at the steamed buns in Zhang Jing's hand. A hint of surprise flashed in his eyes. *Would someone of His Excellency's precious immortal body also eat the grains of mortals?*

After a moment's thought, "Your Excellency, since you like these, why not—"

However, before Li Jiu could finish speaking, he was interrupted by Zhang Jing's gaze.

"Constable Li, there's no need for a visit. It was just a small trick, consider it payment for informing me about the Spirit Pivot Mountain," Zhang Jing said with a half-smile. After that, he walked straight past Li Jiu, continuing leisurely forward.

Looking at the figure walking further and further away, a feeling of dejection naturally arose in Li Jiu's heart. How could he not understand now that his little schemes had been completely seen through by this young lord?

Only... to give up just like that, he was truly unwilling.

The next moment, he seemed to realize something, his gaze constantly darting back and forth between the steamed buns in Zhang Jing's hand in the distance and Wu Dalang in front of him.

"That lord knows you?" Li Jiu asked indifferently.

"Reporting to Constable Immortal, this young master often eats steamed buns from my house," Wu Dalang answered cautiously.

"Very good, haha!" Hearing this, Li Jiu nodded delightedly. "If you ever have any problems in the future, you can come find me at the Qingyue Ward Yamen."

Not long after, Wu Dalang, who had been standing blankly, suddenly awoke as if from a dream. "Oh my, so Young Master is actually a big figure, even the immortal constable is so respectful to him."

As he spoke, he subconsciously remembered Zhang Jing's earlier warning, and immediately began to take it seriously. A great figure like the Young Master, every word he says must have its reason. "But, Master Ximen, why should I be careful of him?" Wu Dalang was utterly bewildered.

***

It was night. All sounds ceased.

In the courtyard, Lu Thirty-Eight had reverted to its true form, sprawled on the ground, sleeping soundly. Ice Crystal Immortal Spirit Bing Liangliang was sprawled out on Lu Thirty-Eight's soft back, completely disregarding any feminine image, also sleeping deeply. Her small mouth opened and closed, murmuring in her sleep. If one listened carefully, one would certainly hear words like 'candied haws', 'fried rice cakes', 'delicious', and so on.

And at this moment, Zhang Jing, inside his room, was full of vigor. His face was filled with anticipation.

Time slowly passed. At a certain moment, the six-layered Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, quietly suspended above, suddenly erupted with a powerful purple immortal light.

"It's done, Post-Heaven Purple Qi!" A smile appeared on his face.

With a thought, in an instant, a faint, extremely subtle wisp of purple qi slowly emanated from the Golden Sun of Mind-Thought in the sixth layer of the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, then slowly descended. Finally, it stopped before Zhang Jing. He slowly extended both hands, gently cradling this wisp of Post-Heaven Purple Qi. His divine sense unconsciously swept over the jade talisman in his Niwan Palace.

【Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade · Uninitiated (10521/100,000)】
```

Looking at these two skills, a thoughtful expression flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. There were still about five hundred years until his true spirit would descend and go to the Great Cang Realm.

In such a short time, upgrading the Primeval Origin Realm skill level would not be very meaningful; it would be better to first prioritize resources to upgrade the Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade.

"In an era of great contention, the more terrifying one's combat power, the greater the gains." Thinking of this, Zhang Jing had already made a decision. At the same time, a hint of curiosity arose in his heart. He wondered what kind of skill characteristic the Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade would condense after reaching the introductory level.

Moreover, he suddenly remembered the congenital blood-gold essence he possessed. The forging method for the destined spiritual treasure corresponding to this great divine ability inheritance—the Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade! It also required cultivating the inheritance to the introductory level first. Only then would it be known.

In his hand, seemingly sensing Zhang Jing's intention, the Post-Heaven Purple Qi immediately transformed into a purple light, like a flexible swimming dragon, directly drilling into his glabella and merging into the deepest part of his consciousness.

In just an instant, Zhang Jing's entire mind was enveloped by the emanating purple qi. His comprehension and even his thought speed were instantly elevated to an extremely terrifying degree. If before it was one, now it was ten thousand, or even higher!

The Post-Heaven Purple Qi disappeared bit by bit. Correspondingly, Zhang Jing's understanding of the Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade inheritance continuously deepened. With every breath, a large number of new insights emerged. Gradually, wisps of profound demonic intent, wrapped in a terrifying artistic conception that could cut through anything, began to spread outward little by little.

Outside the small courtyard, the night quietly fell into a deadly silence. The intermittent croaking of frogs and chirping of insects disappeared without a trace. Lu Thirty-Eight and Bing Liangliang simultaneously woke up, a strong hint of terror flashing in their eyes at the same time. Just now, in their dazed consciousness, they seemed to see a magnificent blade light entwined with eerie crimson divine flames. Under the blade light, immortals and gods bled, and the azure sky wept.

In the room, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes. In the depths of his eyes, a red karma flame subtly ignited. It had no temperature, filled with boundless killing intent.

Within his Niwan Palace, the jade talisman flickered slightly, and the displayed skill information had significantly changed.
