# Chapter 75: A Flashy Spear That's Actually Weak...

"A nearly pure silver opportunity?" Gu Yuan was both shocked and delighted by the sight before him.

Over the past year, Gu Yuan had used the stone liquid multiple times to investigate opportunities, but his gains had been minimal. Aside from the opportunity he found in the Water Curtain Cave last time, he had hardly seen any opportunities above the cyan level. 

This trip to Flying Wave Mountain hadn't filled him with much hope, yet unexpectedly, the stone liquid had given him a pleasant surprise. A nearly pure silver opportunity was enough to slightly alter the course of his fate.

"However, it's in a phantom state again..." Gu Yuan pondered. "Is it because this time, I didn't specifically request cultivation resources or seals but merely sought which spiritual peak would yield the most? Or is it like the Silver Fish Island incident, where there might be unexpected gains?" 

He couldn't find an answer, so he let it go.

"Fortunately, the location of this opportunity isn't one of the top-tier spiritual peaks but a slightly inferior high-grade peak nearby. The competition for this peak should still be within my capabilities."

After brief consideration, Gu Yuan made up his mind. If it had been a top-tier spiritual peak, he would have needed to reconsider. Although his methods were formidable, for the disciples of the Dao Academy, competing for top-tier peaks wasn't just about resources—it was also a matter of status. 

Ninth-level Qi Refining disciples would undoubtedly join the fray, and powerful disciples from prominent families might also participate, making the situation complex. Gu Yuan wasn't entirely confident he could hold the formation disk for a full day. Defending the disk for a day meant enduring relentless attacks from the strongest Qi Refining disciples of the academy—no easy feat.

If he were at the eighth level of Qi Refining, he might have tried. But at the seventh level, competing for a top-tier peak would draw too much attention. 

After all, he had already seized six spiritual peaks—he was far from empty-handed. There was no need to grab every advantage. A top-tier peak only yielded about a hundred more spirit stones per year than a high-grade one. The risk simply didn't justify the reward. 

Besides, as a mere seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator, he didn’t need to worry about prestige.

"No time to waste. I should head out quickly and see which 'immortals' are frolicking on my peak!" 

With a light laugh, Gu Yuan mounted his flying shuttle and headed straight for the spiritual peak named "Green Moon Peak."

The sky darkened as night enveloped Flying Wave Mountain. 

Green Moon Peak was eerily silent, broken only by the occasional mournful howl of a beast—weak and filled with sorrow. It seemed the peak had already been conquered, its guardian spirit beast subdued.

Then, near the cliff's summit, panicked shouts suddenly rang out.

"Junior Sister Yun?! How—how is it you? Weren’t you supposed to be at Cloud Wing Peak?"

"Stop! Stop! Junior Sister Yun, what are you doing?"

"Spare me! Please, Junior Sister Yun! Didn’t you say you wanted to be the sole master of a peak? We’ve already taken Green Moon Peak—we can hand it over to you!"

"Don’t kill us!"

Desperate pleas echoed across the cliff, but soon, everything fell silent again. In the darkness, only a slender figure stood atop the precipice, gazing at the corpses below with a flushed expression.

"You actually believed a woman’s words? How foolish!" 

Yun Hanxiu sneered at the bodies beneath her feet before caressing the bulging storage pouch in her hand. Her eyes narrowed with satisfaction as she murmured, 

"Being the master of a peak? Nothing compares to the thrill of being a bandit!"

"All those years of acting—finally, I can kill to my heart’s content."

"Killing and looting—now that’s true pleasure!"

In the darkness, the stunningly beautiful young woman whispered to the corpses, her face flushed with excitement—a sight both mesmerizing and chilling. Even the hidden observer couldn’t help but feel a shiver of surprise.

"The Green Peak Dao Academy truly breeds talent. Who would have thought that the aloof and pristine alchemy hall disciple was, in truth, a murderous bandit—and one who revels in it?" 

A cold voice echoed across the cliff. Then, a young man clad in an eight-leaf Daoist robe emerged from the shadows. His aura was profound, his gaze as sharp as a hawk’s. 

As he spoke, he idly twirled a string of Daoist beads in his hand. The beads shimmered like carved agate, each of the 102 pieces engraved with mysterious Daoist patterns. 

As the beads rotated, golden light flickered across the cliff’s stone surface, intertwining with the beads to form a glowing golden fence—a barrier that instantly trapped Yun Hanxiu within.

"But no matter how ruthless you are, once caught in my Golden Fence Beads, you’re nothing but a dead woman."

With the golden barrier in place, the young man’s initial surprise faded, replaced by unshakable confidence and arrogance.

"Such a beauty—why choose the path of a thief?" 

He sighed as he examined Yun Hanxiu, now imprisoned within the golden fence.

---

"Who are you?! How long have you been following me?!" 

Yun Hanxiu stared at the golden beads and the sudden appearance of the young man, her face twisting in shock. She trembled like a frightened rabbit.

The young man frowned, sensing something amiss. But after touching his beads, his unease vanished. He scoffed, 

"A mere seventh-level Qi Refining cultivator dares to covet Green Moon Peak? Ridiculous!"

"I only let you live this long so you could weaken the guardian beast for me—to clear the way for—for—"

Mid-sentence, he felt warmth trickling from his nose. When he wiped it, his hand came away red. 

His expression darkened, but before he could speak, a searing pain erupted in his abdomen—sharp and sudden, as if thousands of insects were gnawing at his organs. 

He doubled over, vomiting a mouthful of blood.

"Hiss—!"

The blood was tainted with dark energy, and within it, tiny wriggling creatures hissed ominously.

"This is—?!" 

The young man’s face paled. Without another word, he channeled his spiritual energy to protect his organs and hastily swallowed a detoxifying pill. 

But it was too late.

"You’ve been tailing me all day, swallowing an entire gourd’s worth of Heart-Devouring Ghost Insects… and yet you still have the nerve to bark at me?"

"Have you ever seen a bandit linger over corpses, muttering to themselves after a kill?"

"True, I may have let my guard down earlier—but that doesn’t mean you were meant to witness it."

"Eighth-level Qi Refining—how impressive."

The young man’s face twisted in horror as the sweet, mocking voice reached his ears. When he looked up, he saw the alluring figure step effortlessly through the golden fence—his supposedly unbreakable barrier—and approach him. 

Her aura was no weaker than his. 

She was also at the eighth level of Qi Refining!

The realization struck him just as a sharp pain pierced his forehead. His strength drained away, and his body collapsed uncontrollably. 

As darkness swallowed his vision, he faintly heard a sigh.

"A flashy spear that's actually weak..."
