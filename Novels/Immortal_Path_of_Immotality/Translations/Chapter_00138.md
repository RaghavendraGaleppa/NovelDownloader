# Chapter 137: The Mermaid Maiden

Lin Shan heard someone approaching outside and quickly exited the formation. 

The beach of the small island was in complete disarray, littered with broken branches and leaves left behind after the tree demons were slain. The two battling sides had separated, with all the tree demons and skeletons gathering before the formation.

Opposite them, the water bears had also regrouped. The two Foundation Establishment water bears glared at Lin Shan with fiery eyes, their gazes practically spitting flames as if they wanted to tear him apart. 

Between them stood a newly arrived, graceful maiden with delicate features and a gentle demeanor. However, instead of legs, she had a fish tail.

"This is the territory of our Mermaid Clan's subsidiary within the Stormy Sea Domain. The water bear clan here is under our protection, human cultivator. Release their leader immediately!"

Lin Shan was startled by the mermaid maiden's rebuke. He hadn't known whose territory this was before coming, nor that the water bears were subjects of a non-human race.

But now that he had already forcibly contracted the water bear leader through a summoning pact, releasing it was no issue for him.

"So it's a mermaid maiden. My apologies for the offense. Since this water bear clan is under your protection, I'll naturally let it go."

Having achieved his goal, Lin Shan saw no harm in being courteous. He brought the water bear leader out from the formation, untied the Demon Binding Rope with great ceremony, and personally escorted it back to the other side.

He thought the matter would end there, but the water bears took one look at their leader—covered in bloody holes from head to toe, its massive bear head nearly deformed from hammer blows—and erupted in furious roars.

The leader, unable to face its kin, shed tears of humiliation. Anyone seeing this would think it had suffered unspeakable torture within the formation.

The mermaid maiden, hearing the water bears' angry protests, couldn't help but curse at Lin Shan.

"You monster! What did you do to it?"

Lin Shan spread his hands innocently. "My apologies. I merely wanted to spar with Brother Bear here. I didn't mean to go so hard. My mistake."

But the mermaid maiden wasn't fooled. Seeing the entire water bear clan, from leader to members, bearing signs of severe abuse, she decided to restart the battle after consulting with them, determined to capture Lin Shan and subject him to the same torment.

At this point, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord approached Lin Shan, returning the Descending Cloud Banner and whispering, "Maybe we should run."

The situation was indeed dire. Lin Shan was nearly drained of spiritual energy, and his soul was severely depleted from forcibly establishing the contract. His head still buzzed from the strain.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord had also lost many skeletons, and his Foundation Establishment tree demons were all injured, with most of the Qi Refining ones destroyed. 

With the mermaid maiden at late Foundation Establishment and her unknown abilities as a non-human, continuing the fight would likely end badly.

Having achieved their goal and secured the summoning contract, retreat seemed the wise choice. But one thing held Lin Shan back.

"What about the materials for these three formations?"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord was baffled. Abandon them, of course! With enemies attacking, who had time to recover materials?

Lin Shan refused. The materials had cost 50,000 spirit stones—enough for two damaged magic treasures. If he couldn't recover them, this venture would be a colossal loss.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord posed the ultimate question: "Money or your life?"

"Money," Lin Shan replied.

The demon lord turned to leave. "Farewell!"

"Wait—" Lin Shan grabbed him. Their silver-tier contract wasn't binding enough to keep them together in life-threatening situations. But facing just a few Foundation Establishment foes, was splitting up necessary?

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord insisted that with only Qi Refining strength remaining, staying meant certain death.

*Thud!*

Lin Shan tossed over a storage pouch containing 5,000 spirit stones. "With these and the unused formation materials, how long can we hold?"

After assessing the enemy forces, the demon lord calculated, "We can last until dawn."

Relieved, Lin Shan figured one night would suffice to recover his strength, after which they could retrieve the formations and decide their next move.

"Are you insane?" the demon lord retorted. "This is mermaid territory. By morning, a Golden Core mermaid might show up. Stay if you want to die, but don't drag me down."

Ever cautious, the demon lord refused to risk his avatar against a potential Golden Core opponent.

Lin Shan gritted his teeth. Surrounded by open sea, he doubted the Qi Refining skeleton could escape without him.

To his shock, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord dismantled several skeleton soldiers, reassembling them into a bone airship with an instant flight formation, and zipped away.

Lin Shan gaped. Since when could knowledge be used like this? Crafting + formations = black technology? Was this really Qi Refining level?

But might made right. Lin Shan, at Foundation Establishment, easily reeled the airship back. "Do you really think the mermaids would send a Golden Core expert after a mere early Foundation Establishment cultivator?"

"I don't care. Let me go!"

"Abandon 50,000 spirit stones worth of materials? That's insane!"

"You could've recovered a fifth by now."

"Hold the formations until dawn, and we can leave with everything. Otherwise, this trip is a total loss!"

"Not my problem!"

"Help me this once, and the high-grade magic tool Bone Banner is yours."

"Deal!"

The demon lord had been angling for this. The Bone Banner suited him perfectly, and now it would be his permanently.

Fuming, Lin Shan vowed to settle scores later. Meanwhile, the battlefield below had collapsed—skeletons smashed, tree demons decimated. He hurriedly recalled his four Foundation Establishment bean soldiers (precious millennium spirit seeds), while the demon lord cared little for disposable bones.

They retreated into the formation—Lin Shan meditated with mid-grade spirit stones, while the demon lord maintained the defenses. Outside, the mermaid maiden and water bears relentlessly attacked, unaware that brute force alone couldn't quickly breach the formations.

The assault lasted all night.

By dawn, the exhausted water bears collapsed, panting. The mermaid maiden conserved energy in case of a counterattack. Seizing this lull, Lin Shan and the demon lord swiftly collected their materials and fled.

The maiden could only watch helplessly as they escaped. She resolved to report this to her grandfather, the mermaid elder, and demand justice from East Sea's human cultivators.

Unbeknownst to her, the East Sea was now ruled by three demonic sects. Her complaints would bring calamity upon her reclusive clan—but that was no longer Lin Shan's concern.
