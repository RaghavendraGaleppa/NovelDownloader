# Chapter 25: The Foundation of Cultivation

For the following period, Lin Xuan devoted himself wholeheartedly to practicing the purification of mid-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills. As with all beginnings, the initial stages were arduous, with each step fraught with difficulty and a shockingly low success rate.

He succeeded only once out of every ten attempts—a failure rate so high that Lin Xuan nearly gave up. However, compared to his peers, he was more mature and resilient. Once he set his mind to something, he would persevere relentlessly until he achieved his goal. Gritting his teeth, he pressed on.

His persistence eventually paid off. Over time, Lin Xuan gradually improved, increasing his efficiency to one successful purification out of every five pills. While still low, this was at least within an acceptable range.

It was important to note that the efficacy of mid-grade pills was extraordinary, incomparable to that of low-grade ones.

Naturally, such a purification rate still fell far short of Lin Xuan's daily requirement of nine pills. He had a general plan for his cultivation progress. Though he temporarily slowed his pace, he still needed to practice daily to avoid falling behind.

After deducting time spent meditating and the minimal sleep he allowed himself, the remaining hours—coupled with a twenty percent success rate—yielded only one mid-grade pill per day.

Relying on just one pill was insufficient. While other cultivators would consider even this an unimaginable luxury, Lin Xuan was unsatisfied. After all, he possessed the ability to purify pills.

When mid-grade pills fell short, he supplemented with low-grade ones. Though their effects were inferior, they were better than nothing.

Thus, Lin Xuan began his rigorous cultivation regimen: one mid-grade pill in the morning, followed by four low-grade pills each at noon and in the afternoon.

Time flowed like water, swift and unrelenting. A month passed in the blink of an eye.

The potency of mid-grade pills was indeed remarkable. Despite consuming only one daily, under its powerful medicinal influence, Lin Xuan's cultivation steadily advanced. The growth of his spiritual energy was noticeably rapid. At this rate, in a few more months, he would likely break through to the fifth layer of his cultivation technique, becoming one of the few disciples in his cohort to reach the late-stage Lingdong realm.

While Lin Xuan was satisfied with his progress in cultivation, his purification efficiency for mid-grade pills did not improve as he had hoped. After a month, despite gaining more experience and refining his techniques, his success rate remained stubbornly at twenty percent. The volume of the starry sea within him had expanded slightly, but it still only allowed for the purification of a little more than one pill—far from enough to support purifying two.

It seemed he had reached a bottleneck in utilizing the blue starry sea. After careful analysis, Lin Xuan concluded that further improvement would require advancing several more cultivation levels.

For instance, breaking through to the fifth layer of his technique and entering the late-stage Lingdong realm might enhance his mid-grade pill purification efficiency. Since the starry sea grew in tandem with his spiritual energy, a significant leap in the latter could eliminate the current bottleneck.

Despite this realization, Lin Xuan did not recklessly rush to elevate his cultivation. While diligence was essential in training, impatience could be counterproductive. The Lingdong stage served as the foundation for the long journey of cultivation. Objectively speaking, with the support of spirit pills, his progress was already astonishingly fast. Chasing even greater speed might yield short-term gains but would ultimately harm his future cultivation.

Though young, Lin Xuan was far from impulsive. Even with his extraordinary advantage, he refused to seek quick success. Just as one must eat bite by bite, cultivation required steady, methodical progress. He did not let his purification ability inflate his ego. On the contrary, since heaven had granted him this gift, he resolved to cherish and utilize it wisely. Each day after training, he reflected on his experiences.

Having decided to solidify his foundation and avoid shortcuts, Lin Xuan deliberately slowed his pace to ensure a more robust groundwork.

With this approach, he found himself with extra time beyond pill purification and meditation. Naturally, he wouldn’t waste it—instead, he chose to begin practicing with spirit tools.

Spirit tools were simplified versions of magical treasures, designed for low-level cultivators. Yet their power should not be underestimated. Though incapable of overturning rivers or parting seas, they possessed formidable abilities—soaring through the skies, burrowing into the earth, and performing wondrous feats.

Upon reaching the fourth layer of the Lingdong stage, one could theoretically manipulate spirit tools. However, in practice, this was rare. While spirit tools paled in comparison to true magical treasures, they were still highly valuable. Generally, only Foundation Establishment cultivators could possess them. For Lingdong-stage novices, unless they inherited relics from ancestors or received gifts from mentors due to exceptional talent, owning a spirit tool was nearly impossible.

But Lin Xuan was different. Having plundered the treasures of Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan, his wealth was considerable. Beyond spirit stones and talismans, he possessed three spirit tools.

The first was the Golden Binding Rope Zhou Yan had used to ambush her master. When shrunk, it was only a foot long, but when infused with spiritual energy, it could extend freely, used to bind enemies.

The second was the flying sword—an offensive spirit tool whose power Lin Xuan had witnessed firsthand. With a single strike, it had demolished a sizable cliff face, demonstrating its formidable might.

Yet these two were not the most valuable. Zhou Yan, after all, was only at the peak of the Lingdong stage. Though among the top low-level disciples, her possessions couldn’t compare to those of Zhang Yu, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

From Zhang Yu, Lin Xuan inherited only one spirit tool: a translucent, snow-white bracelet-like ring.

Though unassuming in appearance, the Jade Snow Ring was renowned throughout the Piaoyun Valley, one of the sect's rare top-grade spirit tools.

Spirit tools were categorized into low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade. Only Core Formation experts could wield true magical treasures, while the most powerful Foundation Establishment cultivators might possess a single top-grade spirit tool.

In Piaoyun Valley, even the senior uncles and masters typically wielded only high-grade spirit tools. Top-grade ones were reserved for a select few—Zhang Yu being one of them. Lin Xuan’s luck was truly exceptional.

In truth, aside from the Jade Snow Ring, Zhou Yan’s two spirit tools were also extraordinary. The Golden Binding Rope, a mid-grade tool, could immobilize enemies, functioning as an auxiliary tool between offense and defense. The flying sword, meanwhile, was high-grade!
