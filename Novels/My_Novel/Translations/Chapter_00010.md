Chapter 10: To Obtain Long Life, Walk the Path Solidly

Outside the servant quarters, Luo Fang paced back and forth, waiting anxiously.

"Strange. With my nephew Bi Hao's current martial arts attainment, even if it were a real fight with blades, he should have a surefire chance of winning the position of guard."

"Why do I feel so uneasy and restless? Is it because of that sudden appearance, that thief Li Xian?"

He stroked his chin, his brows furrowing slightly.

"Sigh, I am overthinking it."

"Once Bi Hao becomes a guard, our uncle-nephew alliance will be even more secure. Heh heh, as long as we don't provoke the Madam's friends from the Jianghu, our days will be quite comfortable."

Thinking of this, a smile appeared on his face. A moment later, the sound of footsteps approached.

But the footsteps stopped several yards away, hiding behind a rockery, and did not come closer.

Luo Fang called out, "Nephew? Is that you?"

"Uncle Luo."

Bi Hao's voice rang out.

"Good nephew, why are you hiding? Come tell Uncle Luo how you won. What was the format of the guard selection? And... did you win Commander Pang's appreciation?"

Luo Fang walked toward the sound, and before he even saw Bi Hao, he had already blurted out all his questions.

"The selection... it was... a tournament format," Bi Hao said evasively, his heart filled with anxiety.

"Excellent!"

Luo Fang clapped his hands and laughed loudly. "A tournament format is your strong suit. I was worried before that if it were a test of endurance or strength, your martial arts advantage might not have been fully utilized."

"I've seen your Three Talents Fist technique; it's very solid. Hahaha, did Commander Pang show any appreciation?"

"My nephew Bi Hao truly has the qualifications to be a guard!"

By this time, he had finally seen Bi Hao, covered in blood and looking utterly wretched.

Luo Fang was stunned.

"Bi nephew, you... this..."

"Uncle Luo, that Li Xian was too cunning. He desperately tore my scalp apart."

Bi Hao's expression was strange, his eyes shifting away as he spoke weakly.

"I told you, those lowly scum, facing a chance to turn their lives around, would certainly fight for it with their lives," Luo Fang laughed it off, not taking it seriously. "It's a bit wretched, but a win is a win..."

"I didn't win," Bi Hao's voice was as quiet as the flutter of a mosquito's wings.

"Didn't..." Luo Fang's expression froze, unable to believe it. "Didn't what?"

Bi Hao threw caution to the wind, closed his eyes, and told the truth. "Uncle Luo, actually, I... I didn't win. It was Li Xian who won."

"Didn't win!?"

Luo Fang took three large steps forward, his eyes filled with killing intent. The warmth of the past was completely gone.

"Say that again. Good nephew, don't joke around. This is no joking matter."

"Uncle Luo, I really... really didn't win."

The moment the words fell, a slap landed on his face.

The blow made his ears ring instantly.

Before he could react, a kick struck his lower abdomen, sending him flying a yard away.

Without saying a word, Luo Fang slapped Bi Hao twenty times in a row, swelling his cheeks and knocking out several teeth.

"Worthless trash!"

"You drank my precious soup, and you tell me you didn't win!"

"You can't even beat a mere servant."

"I really want to kill this little bastard. Damn it, how did your mother give birth to such a废物."

"Li Xian, you live in Leaking Bottle Alley in Qingning County?" Pang Long walked ahead, recalling Li Xian's relevant information.

"Yes," Li Xian nodded, his steps light, making no extra noise.

Pang Long nodded gently and said:

"You passed the guard selection. From now on, you are no longer a servant but a formal guard of the One Union Manor."

"But there is one thing I must remind you. Although our guards have better treatment and benefits than servants, in the end, we are still the Madam's household slaves."

"We must be loyal and dutiful, and not be arrogant and domineering. Can you do this?"

Li Xian replied, "Naturally, I can."

He thought to himself, although these rules are good, human hearts are complex. Just the point of 'not being arrogant and domineering' is something very few can actually achieve.

"The fight earlier must have made you hungry. I will take you to the dining hall in the guard courtyard first, and slowly explain the rules to you."

Pang Long's tone was gentle.

He showed great interest in the slender Li Xian.

If he wasn't mistaken, in the tournament just now, Li Xian deliberately concealed his strength to make his opponent underestimate him, then seized victory at the last moment.

At first, even he was fooled, thinking he was just a servant with brute strength and ferocity.

After walking a little over a mile, they arrived at a pavilion.

The plaque read: "Dining Hall Pavilion".

This building was exclusively for guards, so many guards passed by.

"Commander Pang."

The guards greeted him respectfully, and Pang Long nodded slightly.

After sitting down, Pang Long waved his hand gently and said, "Two portions of Grade D meals."

"Commander Pang, you are eating 'Grade D' as well?" the cook asked.

"Naturally," Pang Long nodded.

It wasn't long before two plates of food were served.

Li Xian's mouth watered. There were three dishes and a soup: one meat dish and two vegetable dishes.

The meat dish was "Braised Pork Chunks," each about two fingers thick, with three pieces in total.

And it wasn't lean meat, but pork belly with layers of fat and lean. The surface glistened with oil.

An ordinary servant could never eat this in their lifetime.

The two vegetable dishes were boiled bean sprouts and stir-fried shredded radish with greens. The appearance was average, but they were heavy on "oil" and "salt," glistening.

Great for building strength!

It couldn't be called a delicacy.

But in this world, being able to eat a meal like this is already a rare privilege.

"Go ahead, this is the standard diet for guards."

"Guards... guards, simply put, are here to help the Madam look after the estate. Without some martial arts, you can't protect the estate."

"So, now that you are a guard, you won't have to do trivial servant work in the future. But you must also practice martial arts. For a warrior, eating is something that cannot be taken lightly."

Pang Long picked up his wooden chopsticks, poured the rice and meat dishes into the soup.

After mixing it all up, he slurped from the edge of the bowl, eating everything—soup, water, rice, vegetables, and meat—in one go.

In just a few breaths, he had eaten half of it.

Li Xian didn't rush to eat but asked, "Practice martial arts?"

Pang Long didn't answer, finishing his meal in one breath. His eating style was truly unique; he drank his food like water.

Like a wind sweeping away dead leaves, yet with a hint of elegance. When the bowl was empty, it was as clean as new, not even needing to be washed.

Then he replied:

"Every newcomer is interested in practicing martial arts."

"I have no obligation to explain the Dao of Martial Arts to you. But seeing as you are new here, I will allow you to ask me three related questions."

Pang Long added, "As long as it is related to the Dao of Martial Arts, you may ask anything."

Li Xian's eyes lit up. This Commander Pang was different from Luo Fang and the others.

At least for now, he seemed very different, very rule-oriented.

"Three questions?"

Li Xian thought that since Pang Long said he could ask anything, there was no need to be too restrained. He asked, "Can practicing martial arts increase one's lifespan and allow one to live forever?"

Li Xian had just arrived in this world, and his current situation was dire. How could he dare to seek immortality?

He asked this question purely to quickly understand the outline of the Dao of Martial Arts.

Pang Long was taken aback, looking at Li Xian with surprise. He was curious as to why such a question would come from a servant.

"This kid is really interesting. As a servant, he can't eat his fill or wear warm clothes. Now that he has become a guard, his first question is to ask me if the Dao of Martial Arts can lead to immortality?"

Pang Long said, "Naturally, it can."

But he didn't elaborate, instead observing Li Xian's expression. Seeing no fanaticism or excitement on his face, he confirmed that Li Xian was not being unrealistic, but purely curious.

Li Xian pondered for a moment. "Can one find a path to it within ten miles?"

Pang Long's gaze was complex. This time, he neither said "yes" nor "no," but replied, "It is harder than climbing to the sky."

"You have one last question."

After asking two questions, Li Xian had a general outline of the Dao of Martial Arts in this world.

It was extraordinary, mysterious... and the Manor's Madam was a master of its essence.

For his last question, Li Xian let his imagination run wild. He thought of the many stories and novels he had read in his previous life.

They all had one thing in common: growing one's strength by absorbing a certain energy from the air.

Or Qi, fighting spirit, spiritual energy...

Could it be that this world is the same? That there is a similar substance in the air that can be used to strengthen a warrior through breathing and meditation?

So he asked, "Is the so-called Dao of Martial Arts about perceiving and utilizing a formless power in the air?"

"Ahem," Pang Long looked at Li Xian strangely. "I don't know where you got this idea from."

"But I can give you a clear answer. Your idea... is too far-fetched. Air is just air. What mysterious power could it have?"

As he spoke, he almost laughed.

This kid was really interesting, with very different and flighty thoughts.

Li Xian thought deeply: "If there is no spiritual energy or Qi, where do the supernatural powers and long life come from?"

He was extremely curious.

He thought again of the [Essence Treasure] that had been boiled in the manor recently.

Was this object related to the supernatural?

Unfortunately, that level was still too far away for him for now.

Anyway, he had already shed the identity of a servant, and his days would be better from now on!

One must walk the path step by step
