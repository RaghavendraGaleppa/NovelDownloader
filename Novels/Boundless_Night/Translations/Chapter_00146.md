**Chapter 146: Young Man Slaying Demons**

The Godfall Plains stretched as far as the eye could see, a vast expanse of lush greenery. Yet, under the night mist, the immense forest was a oppressive black, endless and devoid of its usual verdant hue.

Trees swayed, leaves rustling softly, as a faint green mist flowed, enveloping Qin Ming. It made him feel as if he were about to lift off the ground, as if he were floating forward. Moving through the forest, his body felt light, submerged in Verdant Wood Qi. His entire being pulsed with vitality, and with each step, his feet barely touching the grass, he covered vast distances, as if borne aloft by a green haze.

"Verdant Wood Qi has such a marvelous use," Qin Ming thought, a little surprised. Not only did it conserve his strength, but the faint green light surrounding him also felt like a spiritual medicine entering his body, slowly purifying his flesh and blood, nourishing his essence, energy, and spirit. In this environment, his steps were as swift as flight, as if he were riding the essence of flora itself, his hair fluttering, like a banished immortal traversing the night.

In the ink-dark night sky, several streaks of crimson lightning flashed, like falling embers about to strike the earth.

"Is a downpour coming?" Qin Ming looked up. Dark clouds churned in the distance, making the already dim plains appear even more boundless and dark.

Several human figures appeared in his sight. Qin Ming recognized three of them; they had once, like the demonic beasts, regarded him as prey and hunted him. Shrouded in green mist, he changed direction, stepping on the grass, silent as a forest spirit, seamlessly merging with his surroundings.

None of the five noticed him immediately; they were still hurrying on their way. It wasn't until he was less than two meters away that one of them suddenly turned, a look of shock on his face. He hastily thrust out the long spear in his hand, its tip gleaming with a cold light.

Qin Ming swept his right hand, a green aura trailing behind it. With a clang, the finely forged spearhead shattered into scrap metal under his bare hand, falling to the ground.

"It's you!"

The others paled in alarm. This young man, whom demons had hunted and left gravely wounded, now exuded a fresh, herbaceous aura and possessed an incredibly powerful strength that made their hearts tremble.

"Who organized you to hunt me?" Qin Ming asked.

A young woman said, "Brother, don't misunderstand. We heard that the demons were fighting over the silver heart and wanted to snatch it from them. We never expected to run into you."

A middle-aged man nodded. "Yes, brother. We had no intention of targeting you. We just happened to meet you. We even wanted to help, but you misunderstood and left immediately."

Qin Ming's expression remained cold. What was the point of such excuses? Even they themselves must have found their words too weak and pale, for they had already gripped their weapons tightly.

He unleashed a punch, and all the surrounding Verdant Wood Qi surged towards him, empowering his punch beyond its normal limits. With a boom, the man holding the broken spear exploded along with his weapon.

"Brother, we are all human! You... you can't do this!" the woman cried out, but the gleaming silver blade in her hand suddenly swung towards him.

Qin Ming slapped out a palm, and her silver long blade shattered into seven or eight pieces. The green palm-light swept past, and her head flew off, her headless corpse collapsing to the ground.

In an instant, the three others who had encircled him were also severely wounded, lying on the ground, coughing up blood.

"Brother, spare us! We shouldn't have been greedy and joined those demons in trying to kill you," a young man pleaded for mercy.

Qin Ming resonated with their spirits, confirming that their actions were indeed born of greed. Yet, he showed no mercy. The Verdant Wood Qi surged under his feet, causing them to explode.

"Scared me to death! His aura is ethereal, almost immortal, but when he strikes, he's more terrifying than a demon!" a green sparrow muttered to itself, pondering how to report this.

*Poof!*

It exploded, green feathers stained with blood, scattering down in the night sky.

Qin Ming put away his bow and continued on his way.

Deep in the night sky, a gigantic white peacock hovered. Birds flew in from afar, reporting, "This task is too dangerous! We've already lost over a dozen brothers. We don't want to continue. We're not responsible for watching this area anymore—this isn't a bird's job!"

The Godfall Plains were no longer as chaotic. Most of the ancient demons had returned to their own territories. Only a small group of demons still roamed, and their cultivation was not shallow; they were all formidable characters.

Qin Ming spotted a colossal, one-eyed black elephant. Its dark, rough trunk thrashed, smashing large swaths of trees and trampling many boulders that blocked its path. It was furious, its right eye having been blinded by Qin Ming's Jade-Iron Arrow. Its single eye was chillingly cold. This ancient elephant had become irritable and extremely dangerous, seeking vengeance.

Beside it was another creature of similar size, also possessing two long, snowy-white tusks, its body packed with rippling muscle, incredibly robust. It was, in fact, a pig demon.

"Hmm? I smell him!" The elephant's sense of smell was even sharper than a dog's. The black elephant detected Qin Ming approaching. Of course, this was because Qin Ming hadn't deliberately concealed himself; he wanted to truly test his strength against it.

"The same fat heads, big ears, wide mouths, and tusks. Besides the length of your noses, you really do look alike! Truly a pair of pig-headed brothers!"

Qin Ming's single sentence made the expressions of the two colossal beasts turn cold.

With a rumbling roar, the black boar charged, shaking the ground, sending sand and stones flying. It possessed immense impact force, shattering many trees. However, it didn't charge at Qin Ming. Instead, it turned and fled, disappearing into the depths of the night.

"This has nothing to do with me!" it left only that one sentence, carrying two short blades crafted from its tusks, and crashed into the forest, vanishing completely.

Qin Ming paused, stunned. It just ran away?

The black elephant roared in fury. This "brother" was useless; he couldn't be relied upon in a crucial moment. Then, it too flinched, for it truly sensed the terrifyingly dense Verdant Wood Qi on the young man, making it feel a chill.

At this moment, Qin Ming was enveloped in green mist, as if he were about to ascend into the heavens, light as a feather, coming with the wind, rapidly closing in on the elephant.

The black elephant gritted its teeth. Since they had met on a narrow path and there was no way to resolve it peacefully, it could only fight to the death! It let out an elephantine trumpeting sound, shaking the wilderness. Nearby vegetation exploded from the colossal sound waves. It swung its trunk, trampled the earth, and charged madly, the ground trembling violently.

From a racial talent perspective, its strength should far exceed Qin Ming's. After all, such a massive creature, having evolved to a higher level, possessed unmatched brute force. However, once a human cultivated the Skyglow Force to a certain degree, they could become fearless against giant beasts, like a nail facing a block of hard wood.

Qin Ming dodged its charge. Shrouded in green aura, he flashed to the side of the giant elephant, then thrust his right fist out. The Verdant Wood Qi transformed into a flame-like radiance, erupting forth with his attack.

The black elephant howled miserably, staggering as it turned, nearly collapsing to the ground. A bloody hole appeared in its left flank, with many dreadful, bloody cracks spreading out from it in all directions.

"Where is my Jade-Iron Arrow?" Qin Ming asked.

The black elephant was both startled and enraged, and utterly aggrieved. In this human youth's eyes, it was far less important than a single arrow.

*Puff!* Qin Ming swung his Jade-Iron Blade, severing half of the black elephant's trunk. Now, it truly looked a bit pig-headed.

"Ah..." The black elephant flicked an ear, and a Jade-Iron Arrow flew out, signifying its submission. Afterward, it turned and fled.

Qin Ming intercepted it, forcing the old elephant to fight for its life.

Finally, Qin Ming soared into the air, unleashing a dazzling blade light. With all his might, he swept the blade, and a colossal black elephant head plummeted to the ground. The massive corpse fell, blood gushing like a spring.

Qin Ming felt sympathy for the kind, elderly, weak, and infirm, but for an ancient demon that had nearly hunted him to death, how could he simply let it go because it lowered its head once? It was only right to behead such a foe. Enemies that one wishes to remember fondly are best off dead.

Qin Ming moved silently, capturing several wolf monsters. From their mouths, he learned the current locations of the Black Roc and the Fire-Scaled Lion.

Crimson lightning crisscrossed the sky, and a fine drizzle began to fall. In the rain and mist, under the flashes of lightning, Qin Ming saw a towering, demon-god-like figure on the plains ahead, wielding a bone blade and roaming about. It was the ferocious Mountain Ape, its lifespan nearing its end. It sought a portion of silver blood to help its offspring advance, which was why it had lingered.

It was over ten meters tall. In the rainy night, when lightning flashed, it illuminated its dense fur, making it appear fierce and hideous. It saw Qin Ming approaching. Although it sensed danger, it still bared its teeth in a grin. It belonged to the most dangerous type of ancient creature: those nearing the end of their lifespan, completely unafraid of death.

When Qin Ming was hunted by it, he had several times nearly been crushed by its enormous feet, left in a wretched state. Now, he said nothing, only unleashed a heaven-shaking strike.

In terms of pure strength, he was currently inferior to the Mountain Ape—a gap between species. However, his current Skyglow Force was not necessarily weaker than the Rulai, Six Imperial, or Qingtian arts. At the very least, he had caught up in the realm of Rebirth! Even those extraordinary individuals from the great sects and ancestral grounds, despite possessing "a single page of true inheritance" to guide their practice, couldn't fuse so many different forces at this stage.

The blade light erupted, tearing through the rain curtain, as if summoning lightning to strike the Mountain Ape. One had to admit, the Mountain Ape was terrifying. Its eight-meter-long bone blade swung down repeatedly, striking the ground, directly slicing through earth and rock, blasting the surface. Trees and hard stones all shattered. Its destructive power was astonishing; it seemed intent on demolishing the entire forest.

In the rainy night, lightning flashed and thunder roared. Qin Ming wielded Wind-Thunder Force, his entire body shimmering with electrical light, wind surging around his feet. His speed was significantly faster than before his seventh rebirth, easily rivaling races known for their speed. He circled the Mountain Ape, attacking, his blade light gleaming, tearing open the night. He left wound after wound on the Mountain Ape, blood mixing with rain, constantly splattering down.

The Mountain Ape was much stronger than the black elephant, a true ancient demon that had cultivated to the limits of ordinary mountain apes. Its bone blade swept through the night, dispersing the dense curtain of rain, continuously chopping at the rapidly moving young man.

Finally, Qin Ming leaped into the air, like a bolt of lightning, piercing through the dark rain curtain. He soared dozens of meters high, his entire body enveloped in a green aura. The Verdant Wood Essence of the entire forest was mobilized, used by him, as if he were treading on air. Brilliant blade light illuminated the mid-air, then suddenly descended upon the Mountain Ape's head. The terrifying Skyglow Force erupted, cleaving its head into two halves!

The Mountain Ape's split face was grotesquely ferocious, its body covered in blood-stained fur. It released its bone blade and crashed backward onto the ground with a thunderous boom, shaking the entire forest.

Qin Ming drifted down, landing gracefully on a colossal treetop. Green mist flowed, and vibrant life force rapidly seeped into his flesh and blood, nourishing his essence, energy, and spirit. Beneath the dark clouds, he stood on the treetop, ethereal and transcendent, his depleted energy quickly replenished.

"If the Verdant Wood Scripture is already this miraculous, then what about the Abiding World Scripture?" Qin Ming pondered, his spirit soaring with longing. The Verdant Wood Scripture was merely a foundational portion separated from the Abiding World Scripture, yet it was already considered a top-tier profound art. How astounding must the complete secret tome be!

Qin Ming descended to the ground and continued his solitary journey across the Godfall Plains. He relentlessly slew demons; anyone who dared to obstruct him was cut down! He eliminated a large number of lesser demons and several ancient demon lords, shaking the entire Godfall Plains.

At this moment, he had ascended a great mountain and arrived at the "Dao Field" of the Black Roc. He had cleared his path of demons, leaving many corpses and trails of blood on the land behind him.

Dark clouds covered the entire plains, and the rain grew heavier, accompanied by flashes of lightning and rolls of thunder that occasionally illuminated the majestic mountain overhead. This "Dao Field" was an expansive area with many grand structures, large enough for the ten-meter-long Black Roc to enter and move about freely.

At this time, it stood on the great mountain, letting the rain fall, yet unable to reach it. Its entire body was steaming with dark light, as if distorting space, terrifyingly powerful. On the other side, the blood hole on the Fire-Scaled Lion's forehead had vanished; its wounds had long since healed.

They stared at the young man ascending the mountain, cold killing intent flowing in the eyes of both demons.

"Roar!"

A pack of Blood Lions roared and charged at Qin Ming, but he cut them down one by one, cleaving them all into two halves, letting their corpses and blood fall upon the mountainside. Among them were two exceptionally strong Blood Lions who had reached the Outer Saint level, yet they still could not withstand Qin Ming's blade light.

During this, fierce birds of prey launched surprise attacks from the night sky, diving down. Qin Ming continuously swung his blade, blasting a dozen of them apart. All were servants of the Black Roc.

"Big Brother, Second Brother, he has indeed transformed. His cultivation is unfathomable," the Old Donkey said, his voice trembling slightly. This time, he was wearing a scholar's robe.

"He's nothing special, we can handle him!" the Fire-Scaled Lion declared. Its scales clanged, emitting a crimson aura like intense flames, burning the night sky and evaporating the increasingly heavy rain. Its demonic qi surged tempestuously, shaking the mountain peak.

It immediately launched its attack. A massive claw erupted with blinding crimson light, striking out at the young man walking towards them.

Qin Ming likewise raised his palm. In an instant, all the vegetation on the entire mountain rustled, resonating with him. A vast amount of green light, accompanied by rich vitality, surged, seemingly lifting him into the air, as if to make him float! He thrust his palm forward. Instantly, the mountain's flora seemed to cheer along, green mist and radiant light surging. Before his palm, a gigantic green palm print materialized, then slammed forward!
