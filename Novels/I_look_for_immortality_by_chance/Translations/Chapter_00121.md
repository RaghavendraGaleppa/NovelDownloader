# Chapter 121: The Dragon-Binding Truth Seal!

Gu Yuan still couldn't discern the interior structure of the Scripture Transmission Hall.

A cyan light guided him as if heaven and earth were spinning. When he opened his eyes again, he was already inside the hall, where countless jade slips and precious tomes floated in the air like scales on a jade dragon. They drifted around him at his will, allowing him to peruse them freely.

After reaching Foundation Establishment, a cultivator's mana increased significantly, and their lifespan extended by three hundred years. They were no longer ordinary disciples and could freely select various seals—as long as they could comprehend and refine them.

However, the Scripture Transmission Hall was not the only place in the Dao Academy where techniques were taught. Among the seven great lineages, many senior ancestors had privately imparted secret seals and divine abilities that were not recorded in the hall.

These secret seals and divine abilities were often the key to victory for disciples of the seven lineages in battles.

Yet, the techniques within the Scripture Transmission Hall were by no means ordinary. Those with exceptional comprehension abilities could still learn formidable methods.

Gu Yuan didn't rush to make a choice. Instead, he browsed through them one by one.

But after just a glance, he felt his horizons expanding.

"The Supreme Righteous Solar Sword Seal—this seal is simple to refine but possesses immense power. However, once used, it leaves no room for retreat, instantly draining all of the cultivator's mana to unleash a single, indomitable sword beam of pure yang energy. Victory or death hinges on this one strike."

"The Four Pillars of Flames Seal—to refine this seal, one must gather four types of rare heavenly flames and fuse them into one. When deployed against an enemy, the four flames erupt simultaneously, summoning endless fire spirits to form four towering pillars of celestial fire. Its might is unparalleled, unbreakable except by those with immense mana."

"The Annotation Seal—refining this seal requires the bones of a mythical Bai Ze beast. Once mastered, the user's eyes gain divine insight, enabling them to discern the properties and age of any rare herb, spirit material, or demonic creature at a glance. Nothing remains unknown to them."

"The Five Directions Feast Seal—gather spiritual ingredients from five directions and comprehend their Dao patterns to form this seal. Once refined, the user can summon five elemental spirits with a mere thought to prepare exquisite, heavenly delicacies."

"The Yin-Yang Transformation Seal—this seal requires the corpses of forty-nine men and women to extract their yin and yang energies, supplemented with rare spiritual materials. Once refined, the user can freely switch between male and female forms, indistinguishable from the real thing. Only those with immense mana can see through the illusion."

After reaching Foundation Establishment, the variety of seals in the Scripture Transmission Hall had expanded significantly. Beyond combat seals, there were many peculiar techniques—annotation, culinary arts, gender transformation—truly encompassing all things, leaving nothing to be desired.

Gu Yuan found it all fascinating, further deepening his appreciation for the mysteries of the Foundation Establishment realm.

During Qi Refinement, a cultivator's mana couldn't harmonize with heaven, and their lifespan was pitifully short. Aside from cultivation, they hardly dared to slack off.

But after Foundation Establishment, although a cultivator's mana still couldn't merge with heaven, their Dao Foundation inherently possessed divine properties, granting them vast and surging mana. Techniques they could never have imagined before could now be wielded with ease.

After browsing for a long time, Gu Yuan finally turned his attention to "combat seals."

The campaign in the Scarlet Moon Great River was imminent, and time was running short. He needed to enhance his combat abilities to protect himself. Those esoteric and wondrous seals could wait until he had leisure to cultivate them.

Over the years, the Dao Academy had already thoroughly categorized and analyzed all types of seals.

The most profound and battle-effective seals had already been marked by predecessors.

"The Golden Radiance Great Sword Seal—one of the academy's secret transmissions. Only those who cultivated the Golden Radiance Sword Seal during Qi Refinement can learn it. Once unleashed, its sword light blazes like the sun, capable of parting clouds and destroying cities. Its might is boundless, and none but those at the pinnacle of mana can withstand it!"

"The Mystic Yang Sulfur Seal—to cultivate this seal, a cultivator must convert all their mana into flowing golden flames, then refine it with Mystic Yang True Fire to form the seal. Once mastered, the user can spew celestial fire like breath. Even peers can be reduced to ashes in an instant if caught off guard."

"The Heavenly Stars Seal—once refined, this seal can harness stellar power, instantly amplifying the user's mana. Every movement is bolstered by the boundless energy of the stars, making it possible to slay peers with sheer mana alone. However, mastering this seal requires exceptional comprehension to decipher the secrets of the stars."

"The Golden Cauldron of Mist Seal—this seal summons vast clouds that coalesce into a golden cauldron. Any spell cast against it is gradually eroded by the mist, dissipating harmlessly. It renders the user nearly impervious to a thousand techniques. However, refining this seal requires painstaking effort over time to gather and harmonize cloud energies."

"The Moonlight Soul-Severing Seal—this seal harnesses lunar essence to sever souls. A single glance can scatter an enemy's spirit to the winds."

"The Dragon-Binding Truth Seal—this seal channels the essence of heavenly wood and earth energy to unleash immense power. At its peak, it can bind flood dragons and subdue great demons. However, refining it requires obtaining 'Dragon-Binding Wood,' comprehending its Dao patterns, and forming the seal to draw upon endless spiritual energy. The higher the quality of the wood and the stronger the cultivator's mana, the greater the seal's power. Once mastered, the user can even seek higher-grade spirit wood to refine the seal further."

"The Great Five Elements Grasping Seal—this seal can immobilize an enemy's mana, capturing them instantly. Its strength scales with the user's mana—formidable in the hands of the powerful, but feeble and ineffective for the weak."

These seven seals corresponded to the academy's seven true diagrams and were renowned throughout the institution. Mastering any one of them granted earth-shaking power, but their cultivation was equally demanding—requiring either extraordinary comprehension, rare materials, or relentless, grinding effort.

Gu Yuan coveted all seven seals.

However, different true diagram foundations meant different seals were compatible. Forcing an incompatible seal would only backfire.

A true diagram foundation represented a cultivator's path in the Dao. As the saying goes, "The Dao is vast, yet one can only drink from a single cup." One cannot walk two paths simultaneously.

Even the Five Elements True Wheel Diagram couldn't accommodate all seals. The Five Elements were but one branch of the Dao, and once the foundation was established, only techniques that unified the Five Elements could be cultivated.

Only Gu Yuan's Three Methods Celestial Diagram broke these constraints, establishing three foundations that allowed him to cultivate three methods simultaneously.

However, aside from the "Dragon-Binding Truth Seal," the Scripture Transmission Hall lacked any renowned, top-tier techniques for the "Abyssal Diagram" and "Golden Rainbow Diagram" foundations.

The Golden Radiance Great Sword Seal was compatible with the Golden Rainbow Diagram, but since Gu Yuan hadn't cultivated the Golden Radiance Sword Seal during Qi Refinement, he couldn't learn it now.

"In that case, I'll have to pick the best of what's available... or seek alternatives elsewhere."

After surveying the seals in the hall, Gu Yuan sighed inwardly.

Of the Three Methods Celestial Diagram, aside from the Seed of Heaven and Earth Evergreen Diagram, the other two true diagrams came with innate methods that couldn't be swapped. These two diagrams weren't part of the academy's heritage.

Thus, the seals he needed weren't readily available in the academy.

Sword techniques for the golden path were manageable, but abyssal techniques were far rarer.

After much deliberation, Gu Yuan settled on three seals.

The first was naturally the "Dragon-Binding Truth Seal." It harmonized with the Green Ginseng Diagram's foundation and boasted immense power—a must-have.

Next, he chose the "Thousand Rainbows Glass Sword Seal." This seal could split sword light into a thousand rainbow-hued beams, dazzling and lethal, perfectly suited for the Golden Rainbow Diagram.

For the Abyssal Diagram, Gu Yuan selected the "Vast Sea Single Breath Seal." This seal could summon boundless water energy, excelling in both offense and defense. In attack, it condensed into a devastating beam of water; in defense, it formed endless overlapping waves to neutralize most spells.

These three seals would take considerable time to master. Not wanting to bite off more than he could chew, Gu Yuan made his decision, transcribed the techniques, and departed.

His new cave abode awaited—a place not just for cultivation but also for "dividing spiritual energy." If handled well, he might not even need to cultivate the latter two seals.
