# Chapter 373: Awakening from a Dream

A cold wind brushed past the straw curtain of the ancestral hall, causing it to sway and cast flickering moon shadows.

Behind the back door of the ancestral hall, Little Li Mo looked up. He saw the flowing black immortal skirt and hair fluttering in the breeze. Ying Bing’s eyes were deep and profound; she looked more like a fairy who had just descended from the bright moon.

Why did the Ice Cube suddenly wake up?

But it was good that she was awake... Just as Little Li Mo was about to breathe a sigh of relief, he suddenly felt something was off.

*Being small is also quite cute...*

*Was she really just awakened?*

*Does she remember what happened before?*

The brilliance of the Great Yin suddenly intensified. The pure silver light illuminated the ancestral hall as if it were a silver day. Wherever the moonlight passed, the ferocious appearances of the tomb-suppressing beasts were frozen in place.

Even the Nian Beast was no exception, turning into a lifelike silver statue. The difference was that its eyeballs could still rotate, but the gloominess in its eyes had turned into terror.

However, Ying Bing didn't look at it. Instead, she turned her gaze back.

"Ice-er..."

Next to the ancestor's statue.

Ying Xuliang and Ying Bing's mother stared blankly at the graceful, clear figure.

The girl in the painting and their daughter's small figure—reality and dream—seemed to slowly overlap at this moment.

Complex expressions appeared on the couple's stunned faces, which then turned into relief and gratification.

"So we... have already died. This is a dream..."

"Our daughter has grown up healthy and strong. Hahaha, good, good... That is enough."

As their voices fell, silver radiance began to emanate from their bodies. Just like the other Ying clan members, their forms seemed to merge into the moonlight and disappear.

Reality is the end of dreams.

They were about to vanish along with the dream.

"You, you actually... woke up long ago?!"

"It's only been ten years, yet you have reached such a realm! You..."

Cracks appeared in the clear radiance on the black Nian Beast. Its head had already struggled free from the restraint. It cried out in disbelief.

Hmm?

Li Mo leaned back slightly upon hearing this, then a small question mark appeared above his head.

Ten years?

He keenly caught those two words.

This Nian Beast knew that the Ice Cube was dreaming, and it also knew that this was her state from ten years later?

How could a disaster beast existing in a dream say such a thing?

Unless...

A thunderclap flashed through Li Mo's mind. He remembered Zou Yongfeng mentioning that he had seen a black shadow at the Ying family's old house.

This Nian Beast originally came from the outside world!?

So Fengzi didn't see things wrong that day!

This Nian Beast, like himself, is an existence capable of sneaking into others' dreams through special means. No wonder its first reaction upon seeing him was surprise; it never expected him to be here!

The Nian Beast didn't start dissipating just because the dream was beginning to end.

This is the best evidence!

*Crack—*

Suddenly, the clear radiance on the Nian Beast shattered, exploding into a sky full of glittering fragments.

It realized that the person before it was no longer the little girl from ten years ago, and perhaps not even just the version from ten years later.

This ability to control the Great Yin, even within a dream, is absolutely not something a Divine Observation Realm cultivator could possess. Otherwise, even if it were in someone else's dream, it wouldn't be so weak.

Li Mo only saw the form of the black Nian Beast transform into a black wind, rolling back toward the blank space of the dream.

*Buzz—*

A sword hum sounded.

A sword shadow suddenly drilled out from the Great Yin. The black Nian Beast was fast, but its speed was even faster.

Li Mo even felt it was fast to the point of absurdity.

It was as if the sword had just appeared, and the next moment it was already slashed out. This was clearly something that had just happened, yet it felt as if it had already occurred.

Although only one sword strike was made, it felt like thousands of blows appeared in the same instant.

This sword strike was like a phantom emerging from the gap in time.

"Ahhh!!"

The Nian Beast let out a miserable scream. Black energy churned around it. The sword, resembling a shadow within the moon, ruthlessly pierced through its body.

"You were looking for me, but wasn't I also looking for you?"

伴随着 the girl's voice.

Li Mo saw the sword light bloom amidst the black mist.

It was breathtakingly beautiful, yet cold and sharp.

"How could I die in a dream!"

The desperate roar of the black Nian Beast echoed through the ancestral hall.

The wound inflicted by the slash on its body emitted wisps of black煞气 (evil energy). However, upon encountering the sword light enveloped in moonlight, it was still crushed with overwhelming force.

...

Outside.

---

In reality.

The dark and windy night finally cleared up a bit. The moon, which had been hiding behind the clouds, slowly became distinct.

Moonlight illuminated the broken walls and ruins of the Ying family's old house, as well as the dilapidated ancestral hall.

A huge black shadow was currently lying in the hall.

It was identical to the black Nian Beast in the dream, though not as large as in the dream.

"It hurts, it hurts so much..."

"Let me out... Let me out!"

The Nian Beast rolled around in pain, knocking down the adjacent broken wall.

But even with such violent movements, it couldn't wake up from the dream.

Moreover, various ferocious wounds began to appear on its body. Rolling black evil energy also emanated from the wounds, causing it to deflate rapidly, its size shrinking quickly.

Gradually, it became the size of a calf and stopped moving.

Black blood flowed all over the ground.

......

Inside the ancestral hall.

The black Nian Beast, which had been fierce and menacing just moments ago, was now lying on the ground, submerged in silver moonlight, and disappeared.

Without the movements of the Nian Beast and the tomb-suppressing beasts, the ancestral hall in the dream became incredibly quiet instantly.

"Dead?"

Li Mo had a premonition that this thing didn't just die in the dream; its fate in reality probably wasn't much better either.

Hmm?

He suddenly realized that his perspective when looking at the Ice Cube was no longer from below; it had returned to before.

Li Mo realized.

This dream was becoming more and more 'real'.

So he was no longer a child but had restored his appearance as a youth.

The lively and noisy New Year's scene just now was gone, the Ying clan members were gone, and the surrounding scenery was also blurring and collapsing.

The only ones remaining were Ying Xuliang and Ying Bing's mother, lingering on with reluctance.

The ones reluctant to leave weren't them, but...

"Ice Cube..."

Li Mo looked at Ying Bing beside him and found her complexion had turned a bit paler.

The Ice Cube's Great Yin Divine Intent was related to time.

Now, she was maintaining the dream, delaying its rapid fall toward reality.

"Father... Mother..."

The couple gazed at their grown-up daughter and the Li family's boy. Many words they wanted to say flickered in their eyes, but they only smiled:

"Daughter, the moon will set, and the sun will rise again. No matter how beautiful a dream is, it will eventually wake up."

"Waking up is fine, as long as it's a beautiful dream, that's enough..."

Their forms were being decomposed into specks of silver light, vanishing into nothingness, their faces gradually becoming blurred.

But Li Mo clearly felt that Uncle Ying and Auntie were looking at him.

"Thank you for coming into Ice-er's dream..."

......

More than ten years ago, an ordinary day.

The sun rose as usual, illuminating the awakening moment of the Ying family's courtyard.

Some clan members were exercising in the square in front of the ancestral hall; some sat on the threshold slurping noodles, greeting the morning sun and the arrival of a new day.

Sunlight broke through the window and shone on the bed in the wing room. Ying Xuliang woke up in a daze. He looked at the morning light outside the window and muttered:

"Wife, I seem to have had a very long dream..."

"I dreamt that Ice-er fed me dumplings, dreamt that she grew up, and dreamt of... her standing together with a boy, it seemed to be... the Li family's boy?"

"I... I did too."

Ying Bing's mother also woke up. She wiped the corners of her eyes and found she had been crying at some point.

"You dreamt it too?"

"Yeah..."

"Haha, it seems our husband and wife won't have different dreams in the same bed."

Ying Xuliang laughed heartily.

"You rascal..." Ying Bing's mother was amused by her husband into holding back her tears and gave him a white eye.

"Wife, let's make some dumplings and take them to Brother Li's house today. Let's see his boy, see if he's as smart and cheeky as in the dream."

"I'll go ask Ice-er if she's willing to go out."

....

PS: Reality is the continuation of dreams, and dreams are the end of reality. This little author has remembered this sentence for a long time.

The subsequent divine form abilities of the Ice Cube are also related to this. Until now, she hasn't actually been in a completely full health state, not just in terms of cultivation realm.

As for the reason for her rebirth, this little author won't gloss over it. It will only be gradually revealed as the two of them slowly reach higher realms. Spreading it out slowly is definitely better than revealing everything at once.

I have to go out for dinner for the Mid-Autumn Festival tonight, and there are still two chapters in the evening, so they might not be on time.

I wish all readers a happy Mid-Autumn Festival in advance. May we all be blessed with longevity, though thousands of miles apart, we can still share the beauty of the same moon. 030.
