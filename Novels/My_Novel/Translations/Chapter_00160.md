Chapter 160: The Hum-Ha Formation, The Shock of the Divine Arrow

After stepping into the First Realm of Martial Dao—[Consuming Essence to Shed Mortality]—and cleansing the fetal body to retain its essence, one continues to drink in the精华 of heaven and earth, undergoing further transformation to accumulate the capital of the entire body.

Li Xian’s red mole between his eyebrows glowed faintly, and his pupils revealed their dual pupils. His body resembled a mountain at dawn, shrouded in white mist and surrounded by a radiant light, looking like an immortal deity.

This transformation had a more pronounced effect. The effects of the [Perfect Physique]—its strange phenomena and restorative abilities—and the [Dual Pupil Physique]—its intimidation, brute strength, and observation—had all significantly increased.

His life hair grew by half a millimeter, his lifespan increased by ten years, and he advanced one level in Martial Dao.

A thousand-zhang mountain, a ten-thousand-zhang peak. He had already climbed out from the foot and shown his initial potential. When he ascends the summit one day, the vast scenery will be一览无余.

Of the infamous names on the Red List, five have already been eliminated. The remaining few, alerted by his actions, have fled far away, making them difficult to find.

On this day, after finishing breakfast, Li Xian held the Red List and checked the information on the "Child-Eating Old Man": seemingly surnamed Chu, originally a rural farmer. During a famine year, he ate his own child to survive, distorting his mindset. Later, he took pleasure in eating young boys. His martial arts and cultivation level are unknown... He is currently active in "Three Yin Mountain."

Li Xian deliberated for a moment and decided to hunt him down, acting entirely on his whim.

He summoned the constables of the Martial Commandant Hall and had them relay his order to recruit a few skilled martial artists from various gangs and sects in Qingning County to jointly exterminate the "Child-Eating Old Man."

Li Xian thought of Luo Xia. This woman’s origins were a mystery, and her strength was undoubtedly not weak. He went to her old residence to invite her to join.

"You are the Martial Commandant?" Luo Xia asked, surprised, after understanding the details. Half of her face was burned, her appearance ferocious, and neighbors avoided her.

Thus, she lived a solitary life with no one to talk to. She was too lazy to inquire about city affairs and only knew there was a young Martial Commandant in Qingning County. She had no idea what he looked like or his background, nor did she have any interest.

Li Xian smiled. "If you come along, I'll give you thirty taels of silver."

"Only thirty taels?" Luo Xia looked at him suspiciously.

Li Xian said, "That's not a small amount."

"To be honest with you, although that Child-Eating Old Man is evil, and it is my duty to kill him since he is in my jurisdiction, this mission is also a scheme from the Cao family against me."

"There is definitely risk in this trip. I suspect your strength is not weak and wish to invite you for assistance. But I don't want to deceive you, leaving you in a dangerous situation without knowing the full story. Before inviting you, I have already gathered dozens of brothers."

"The bounty for the Child-Eating Old Man is seven hundred taels. Even if we turn in the head, after layers of deductions, what reaches my hands will be pitifully little. These brothers risk their lives with me; I certainly cannot treat them poorly."

"After splitting it up, your thirty taels is already my limit. In fact, upon careful calculation, I might even lose money."

Luo Xia said, "You are quite an interesting person. If others are scheming against you, why go?"

Li Xian said, "The Cao family wants to deal with me; they will always find a reason and a way. Avoiding it won't help; it will only leave me anxious and helpless. Besides, that Child-Eating Old Man is wicked to the core. It is only right for me to go and kill him."

"Good!" Luo Xia tied up the long hair covering her face, revealing half of her fair cheek. If this woman hadn't had her skin destroyed, she would be a rare beauty. "Your words are to my liking."

"I won't participate in your feud with the Cao family. But this Child-Eating Old Man, I will help you deal with. I'll only take fifteen taels. Give the rest of the money to your brothers."

"But there is one condition you must agree to."

Li Xian was stunned. From Luo Xia's tone, it seemed she wanted to take full charge. "Go on."

Luo Xia's eyes flashed with light. "Give me command of the constables under you. If thirty or so men are well-trained and follow my command, we might be able to kill even a Second Realm martial artist."

"Oh?" Li Xian said, "These are all my brothers. I can let you command them for now, but... try your best to protect their lives."

Luo Xia said, "That is natural."

The matter was settled. Luo Xia accompanied him back to the Martial Commandant Hall. Li Xian announced loudly, "Brothers, for this extermination mission, this lady will serve as the deputy commandant. You will all follow her orders."

And so, the Martial Commandant Hall set out with fierce momentum. Dozens of men rode horses with weapons, heading straight for the Child-Eating Old Man's location.

Li Xian asked humbly, "Miss Luo, the Second Realm of Martial Dao is formidable. Why are you so confident that you can kill him just by arranging formations?"

It was hard to say what realm the Child-Eating Old Man was in. He might not necessarily have the strength of the Second Realm.

Luo Xia rode her horse with a heroic and spirited bearing, and she didn't mind explaining to Li Xian. "If it were a one-on-one fight, these constables wouldn't be enough for a Second Realm martial artist to kill."

"And the army is clumsy. If a martial artist wants to escape, even a thousand soldiers or ten thousand soldiers often cannot stop them. But men have their methods, and armies have their laws."

"A multitude of people can create infinite妙用. Combined with the terrain layout, trapping and killing a martial artist is within reach."

"And with me personally commanding, if the situation turns不利, I will step in personally. How could the bandit have a chance to live?"

Li Xian understood. Luo Xia's strong confidence still came from herself. A multitude of people and the arrangement of formations could indeed resist a martial artist. However, nothing in the world is unchanging. The same formation, in different environments and situations, has different effects.

At this moment, in this place and scene, it could trap and kill a martial artist. But if the scene were changed, the martial artist might find an opportunity to escape, or even cause heavy casualties.

Therefore, one needs a stabilizing pill, a needle to anchor the sea, to oversee the overall situation.

Luo Xia held a map and arranged the military formation. She glanced at Li Xian with a somewhat speechless expression. This young man seemed absent-minded but was actually secretly observing, with the suspicion of stealing the craft.

Luo Xia didn't hide anything, but she wouldn't actively teach either. She just arranged things according to her thoughts.

This formation was called the "Hum-Ha Formation," requiring two large drums. Fifteen men were the "Hum Generals," and fifteen were the "Ha Generals." The rest followed orders and coordinated from within.

Luo Xia finished arranging the formation and displayed its great power. She thought to herself that since this was a scheme by the Cao family, the Child-Eating Old Man must be quite strong and extremely confident. For such a character, as long as she released a signal, he would fall into the trap.

She immediately found a suitable terrain and shouted, "Burn smoke to lure the enemy!"

The Child-Eating Old Man was hiding in the mountains. He was a vicious fugitive, protected by the Cao family to escape the pursuit of the yamen. Recently, he was dispatched to the vicinity of Qingning. The Cao family told him that the Qingning County Martial Commandant would bring people to hunt him down.

They told him to be prepared and kill the Martial Commandant.

The Child-Eating Old Man had been in the Consuming Essence Realm for a long time and was arrogant in his heart, not taking the encirclement seriously at all. He had committed many heinous crimes and had been encircled many times. Sometimes with a dozen or so people, sometimes with dozens.

But he always managed to kill his way out and escape.

Seeing the thick smoke now, he knew the Martial Commandant had arrived. Thinking to kill him early to complete the task, he let out a long howl and rushed towards the black smoke, "falling into the trap."

Running down the mountain peak, he saw dozens of people ahead. The old man showed no fear and asked, "Who is the Martial Commandant?"

Li Xian sat on a fine horse and said loudly, "I am the Martial Commandant. Today, I will take your head. You had best乖乖 offer it up to atone for your sins."

"Hehe." The old man was as withered as dried wood, with no flesh on his face, only skin and bone. When he laughed, he made a "click click click" sound, which was extremely eerie. He said, "What a coincidence, what a coincidence. Today, I also want to take your head."

He charged straight into the formation, aiming to seize Li Xian's head. Li Xian remained calm. He had already seen the Child-Eating Old Man's strength and relaxed slightly. Although this old man was more powerful than Zheng Xuezhang, he didn't seem to be of the Second Realm.

Seeing the old man enter the formation, Luo Xia sneered and let out a "Hum" sound.

Soldiers emerged from the side, blocking the old man's path. The old man was furious and was about to make a move. Luo Xia发出 a "Ha" sound. The soldiers, following her command, immediately responded.

It turned out that the "Hum-Ha Formation," though simple, was also complex. Luo Xia simplified this formation: "Hum" represented strong attacks, and "Ha" represented soft defense.

The thousands of martial arts in the world ultimately离不开 the two words "attack" and "defense."

Luo Xia commanded from a high place. When she发出 a "Hum" sound, the soldiers channeled their internal energy and attacked fiercely. Even though the soldiers' martial arts were lowly, their internal energy accumulated from little to much.

And with more than ten people attacking together, the momentum was immense, which could not be simple.

When she发出 a "Ha" sound, the Ha Generals immediately responded, parrying and defending, using softness to overcome hardness.

In this way, it seemed the old man was breaking into the formation, but in reality, he was exchanging moves with Luo Xia. Luo Xia used only "attack" and "defense" to deal with endless changes, turning the myriad changes into the unchanging.

The Hum and Ha formations were like left and right arms.

Naturally, they were extraordinary.

Li Xian thought, "If I were trapped in the formation, how would I deal with it? This formation's attack and defense are unique. Only by finding its weakness can I break it."

Since witnessing the "Iron Net Catching Criminals Formation" and the "Three Talents Catching Criminals Formation," he had become quite interested in formations. In this world, there is individual great power, longevity, and demons and ghosts. But there is also the truth that many people gathering firewood makes a high flame; the combined power of the masses cannot be ignored.

He consulted books and asked predecessors, gradually understanding that any formation is like a "problem." If you cannot find the key to solving the problem, you will be restrained by the formation.

Conversely, if the problem is solved, the formation will collapse. In an instant, it will be overturned, and one can fight a hundred.

Li Xian watched from the side. The old man was powerful, but he quickly exhausted his strength. Many of his martial arts could not be used, and he wanted to escape.

"Beat the drums!" Luo Xia shouted loudly.

Two drum sounds were like thunder, rumbling and shaking the wilderness. The drum sounds seemed to have the effect of dispersing internal energy, making joints sore, draining strength, and making internal energy diffuse and difficult to condense.

"Hm?" Luo Xia frowned. She saw the old man roll out of the formation, actually enduring the drum sounds and escaping.

The full appearance of the "Hum-Ha Formation" is composed of dozens of strong men skilled in "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." When beating the drums, everyone stimulates the thunder sound, stacking the momentum.

It could scare a Consuming Essence martial artist into瘫软 his legs, completely losing the power to resist. However, today it was incomplete, and Luo Xia overestimated the effect of the drum sound.

Seeing that the old man was about to escape, he would surely be cautious next time, making him harder to deal with. She immediately took her bow and shot at the old man.

The old man was covered in cold sweat. After this battle, it was like escaping from death. Hearing the sound of the arrow, he immediately hid behind a stone. The arrow pierced four-tenths into the stone but failed to kill the old man.

Luo Xia frowned and shot another arrow. The old man ran for his life, darting east and fleeing west, making him difficult to shoot. Luo Xia's archery was very precise; several arrows grazed him, but none killed him.

"Let me do it!"

Li Xian took out the Golden Leopard Bow and drew an arrow. His movements were smooth and natural. He drew the bow to its full extent and shot the arrow. It划破 the air and accurately hit the abdomen.

"Good archery!" Luo Xia's eyes lit up and she looked at Li Xian sideways.

Li Xian drew his bow again and shot another arrow. The old man was hit by an arrow, but because his martial realm was not weak, his combat power still remained. He turned back to grab the flying arrow.

The immense force in the arrow pushed him back several zhang. He hit a tree trunk. By now, he was panting heavily, his energy greatly consumed, and his internal energy almost empty.

Li Xian shot another arrow. From dozens of zhang away, this arrow happened to hit the previous arrow, splitting it open, and then pierced through the old man's chest.

Luo Xia's eyes shone with brilliance, and she almost applauded. Although archery is a foundation, anyone who can pull a bow can practice it. Diligence can lead to proficiency, and hard practice might lead to minor success, but "great success," "perfection," and "peak" depend entirely on individual talent.

At this moment, the archery Li Xian displayed was at least at the level of great success. Such a person would be very popular on the battlefield!

"This is..." Immediately after, Luo Xia's face showed surprise. She saw that on Li Xian's last arrow, a spirit actually burst forth.

This arrow shot through the forest, moving forward without hesitation, so touching.
