# Chapter 146: Seven Stars

Li Shiming could say with absolute certainty that he had never heard of Seven Stars Island from any records or fellow cultivators. 

He glanced at Yin Shilan and saw the look of surprise in her eyes, realizing she likely knew something about this island.

"Lan'er, what is Seven Stars Island?" he asked softly.

Yin Shilan looked at Uncle Zhuge with a questioning gaze, seeking his permission.

"No need to keep it from him—we're taking him there anyway," Uncle Zhuge said with a smile.

"Seven Stars Island is the first line of defense jointly established by the seven major sects in the sea to prevent sea beasts of Golden Core strength from approaching our territories," Yin Shilan explained to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming was surprised to learn that the seven major sects actually cooperated with one another. 

From what he knew, Tianhai Sect and Xuanming Sect were sworn enemies, while Tianhai Sect's relationship with Shengbing Sect wasn't much better either. As for the other sects, given his status, he had never interacted with them. 

Yet these seemingly unconnected sects had joined forces to establish a defensive line at Seven Stars Island—was it solely to guard against Golden Core-level sea beasts?

Of course, these matters were still far beyond his reach. As a mere Qi Refining cultivator, if not for his exceptional talent in formations, he would never have been exposed to such secrets.

The flying boat slowed down, and Li Shiming finally saw Seven Stars Island—a cluster of seven interconnected small islands. 

From the sky, the arrangement of the seven islands resembled the Big Dipper formation. It was unclear whether this formation was natural or artificially created.

He also understood their mission now. The seven interconnected islands had been slashed by five deep sword marks from some immensely powerful being. 

From above, the five sword marks were clearly visible. On the ground, they must have been even more shocking in scale.

As the flying boat descended, Li Shiming tensed up as seven terrifying auras swept over them.

"Golden Core—seven Golden Core elders!" He nearly jumped in shock. 

Normally, encountering even a single Golden Core elder was rare. Yet here, there were seven of them gathered in one place.

The flying boat landed on one of the islands, and Uncle Zhuge stored it away.

"Zhuge Xuan pays respects to Elder Gu!" He bowed respectfully toward a cave dwelling.

"You arrived quickly. Begin repairing the formations first," an aged voice replied.

"As you command!" Zhuge Xuan bowed before turning to Li Shiming and Yin Shilan. "Your task is to repair the formations on this island. If you encounter any difficulties, leave them for me to handle."

Li Shiming surveyed the surroundings. Based on what he had seen from the sky, this island had been struck by two sword marks, and the damage was severe. It wouldn't be a quick fix.

"Here are the required materials. Don't worry about conserving them—just focus on completing the repairs as quickly as possible." Zhuge Xuan handed each of them a storage pouch.

Li Shiming took one and probed it with his spiritual sense. It contained twenty cubic meters of space, packed with precious formation materials.

The materials in this single pouch alone were worth at least a million spirit stones. 

Though Li Shiming considered himself wealthy with over two million spirit stones to his name, this was the first time he had seen such an abundance of high-grade formation materials in one place.

Combined with the materials in Yin Shilan's pouch, the total value exceeded two million spirit stones. And the materials Zhuge Xuan would be using were likely even more valuable.

This was just for one island. All seven islands had suffered varying degrees of damage. The cost of repairing the formations on Seven Stars Island alone was astronomical by normal standards.

Li Shiming and Yin Shilan had worked together many times before, so they paired up while Zhuge Xuan worked alone.

They arrived beside one of the sword marks—three meters deep, over five meters wide, and stretching across the entire island.

Li Shiming probed the mark with his spiritual sense and found that the residual energy within had already been cleared. Otherwise, just dealing with that would have been a major challenge.

With his spiritual sense aiding him, he began the repairs.

The formations here were built around the Big Dipper formation, supplemented by multiple other formations woven together to create a powerful defensive array.

Since he was working on one of the nodes and the Big Dipper formation was damaged, he could only make preliminary assessments. The true extent of the formation's power remained unknown.

But for Li Shiming, no matter how complex the formation, it was composed of smaller nodes. His task was simply to repair those.

He retrieved materials from the storage pouch, and Yin Shilan crafted the necessary formation components based on his instructions.

Li Shiming had a deeper understanding of formations than Yin Shilan, and over countless missions, they had developed a clear division of labor—he took the lead while she assisted.

Yin Shilan's spiritual power was more abundant, making her better suited for crafting the components, while Li Shiming focused on repairing damaged formation lines and replenishing the nodes.

Their progress was steady, and they encountered none of the difficulties Zhuge Xuan had warned about.

Though the formation was highly complex, Li Shiming wasn't tasked with rebuilding it from scratch. With his analytical skills and the support of IBMz15, repairs were effortless.

While Li Shiming and Yin Shilan worked, formation masters arrived on the other islands to begin similar repairs.

"Take a break," Zhuge Xuan reminded them when he returned.

His spiritual sense swept over the repaired sections, and his expression turned to surprise.

The efficiency and quality of their repairs surpassed even his own as a high-level formation master. The progress was not only fast but also nearly flawless, requiring no further intervention from him.

After ten hours of continuous work, Li Shiming and Yin Shilan were exhausted. Though they possessed spiritual sense, they were not yet Foundation Establishment cultivators. Prolonged use of spiritual sense left them mentally drained.

"Uncle, this work will take at least ten days to complete," Li Shiming said wearily as he set down his tools.

"Ten days would be optimistic. Tianquan and Kaiyang Islands suffered the worst damage. Our Tianji Island is relatively less affected," Zhuge Xuan replied with a bitter shake of his head.

The seven islands were named after the stars of the Big Dipper—Tianshu, Tianxuan, Tianji, Tianquan, Yuheng, Kaiyang, and Yaoguang.

"Uncle, who was responsible for this?" Li Shiming asked in a hushed tone.

He didn't even consider sea beasts—anyone with eyes could see these were sword marks. 

Only a cultivator could unleash such sword energy, but what kind of monstrously powerful sword cultivator could wreak such havoc under the noses of seven Golden Core elders?

"Don't ask too many questions. Your task is to repair the formations," Zhuge Xuan said sternly, waving his hand to dismiss further inquiries.

Suppressing his curiosity, Li Shiming sat down to rest.

He took out stir-fried bamboo shoots, sweet and sour ribs, steamed pork with rice flour, twice-cooked pork, and braised pork—all spirit food—and arranged them on a makeshift table. He then filled two jade bowls with spirit rice.

"Uncle, would you like to join us?" he asked, remembering Zhuge Xuan's presence and fetching another bowl.

"I've lost my appetite," Zhuge Xuan said, shaking his head as he watched Yin Shilan standing affectionately beside Li Shiming.

Li Shiming didn't press further. He invited Yin Shilan to sit. The repairs had drained them, and a good meal was the best way to recover.

Yin Shilan had previously preferred vegetarian spirit food. But after Li Shiming acquired thousands of sea beast carcasses—though he disposed of most, he kept the edible parts—their diet had expanded.

Li Shiming had also cultivated various spirit herbs on Eagle Beak Island, all of which were used as seasonings. 

For a long time, their meals had consisted of spirit meat from sea beasts, prepared using recipes Li Shiming had studied from IBMz15's database, mastering many famous dishes from his past life.

Now, Yin Shilan had grown accustomed to eating spirit meat and to Li Shiming's attentive care.

Just as the two were enjoying their intimate meal, a figure landed beside them. Li Shiming suddenly found himself immobilized, as if bound by an invisible force.

"Father!" Yin Shilan exclaimed happily upon seeing the newcomer.

But then, remembering Li Shiming beside her, her face flushed crimson.

Hearing her address, Li Shiming immediately realized the man's identity.

As Yin Shilan spoke, the restraining force vanished.

"So this is Li Shiming. Not bad for a young man," Elder Yin said dotingly to his daughter before turning to Li Shiming, his eyes gleaming sharply.

Li Shiming felt a chill run down his spine. He suspected that without Yin Shilan present, Elder Yin's gaze alone might have killed him.

In truth, Elder Yin was quite satisfied with Li Shiming. But seeing his daughter being so affectionate with him made him inexplicably uncomfortable.

From Elder Yin's perception, Li Shiming's strength was exceptional for his age among ordinary cultivators.

Moreover, Li Shiming had cultivated body-refining techniques and awakened spiritual sense—traits typically seen in top-tier geniuses.

Yet Elder Yin knew the sect hadn't provided such training. These achievements were entirely due to Li Shiming's own机缘 (fortuitous encounters).

Most importantly, Li Shiming's formation skills were outstanding.

Elder Yin understood his daughter well. He had once worried that her aloof personality would make it difficult for her to find a suitable partner.

Yin Shilan had encountered many top-tier geniuses, and given her status, she had been pursued by many. Yet none had ever caught her eye.

"Greetings—" Li Shiming hastily stood and bowed, unsure how to address Elder Yin.

Elder Yin hadn't introduced himself. Though Li Shiming had suspicions about Yin Shilan's background, they had never discussed it openly, so he feared using the wrong title.

"Just call me Uncle," Elder Yin said with a resigned sigh after glancing at his concerned daughter.

"Greetings, Uncle Yin," Li Shiming amended.

From a distance, Zhuge Xuan twitched his lips, marveling at Li Shiming's incredible luck in securing such a powerful backer.

"Fellow Daoist Yin, did you find no trace of that man?" Several figures descended, and an elderly monk spoke.

Li Shiming's already tense heart nearly stopped. The newcomers exuded overwhelming pressure—each one was a Golden Core elder.

In this short time, he had seen more Golden Core elders than he had ever heard of in his entire life.

Yin Shilan discreetly transmitted their identities to Li Shiming. Though such whispers were ineffective before Golden Core elders, none paid it any mind out of respect for Elder Yin.

Li Shiming now understood these elders represented the seven major sects.

"No. With injuries that severe, he might already be dead somewhere," Elder Yin replied.

"I doubt it. Though heavily wounded, a sword cultivator's physique would allow him to cling to life for some time," countered Elder Lu of Shuiyun Sect, a female elder.

Elder Yin hadn't participated in the battle. He had been summoned afterward to join the search, so his knowledge of the enemy's strength was limited.

"Let's see if the others find anything. We must uncover why he appeared here. I sense great trouble brewing," Elder Xie of Shengbing Sect said gravely.

Each sect had dispatched Golden Core elders. Combined with the seven originally stationed at Seven Stars Island, a total of fourteen Golden Core elders had gathered—demonstrating the gravity of the situation.

Listening in, Li Shiming pieced together some clues.

An unidentified Golden Core sword cultivator had appeared near Seven Stars Island, triggering a battle. Even with seven Golden Core elders joining forces and leveraging the island's formations, they had only managed to severely wound the enemy before he escaped.

It was hard to fathom how formidable that sword cultivator must have been. For the first time, Li Shiming questioned the strength of the sect's Golden Core elders.

Were the disparities among Golden Core cultivators truly this vast?

"Let's wait for updates. Meanwhile, we should gather intelligence from across the sea. We need to understand what's happening there. Why would a Golden Core sword cultivator risk crossing the sea if not to fight us?" Elder Gong of Jinghong Sect sighed.

Only then did Li Shiming learn the sword cultivator's origin—from "across the sea." He had never heard of such a place within the sect.

"Great Master Du Hai, we must trouble you to investigate through Buddhist channels," Elder Yin said to the monk from Wanfo Sect.

"Wanfo Sect will handle this, though it may take some time," Great Master Du Hai agreed without hesitation.

As Elder Yin had said, other sects had limited external connections. Only Wanfo Sect maintained channels beyond their borders. The seven sects' cooperation was based on mutual agreements.

Now that trouble had arisen, Wanfo Sect's assistance was only natural.
