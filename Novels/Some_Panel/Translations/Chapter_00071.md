# Chapter 70: Sword Wings! Supreme, Don't Trade With Him

"That is..." Yang Ji's eyes suddenly lit up. What he saw was a pair of wings, a pair of wings filled with a cold, metallic aura.

Each feather was like a small, sharp flying sword, arranged in a stepped pattern to form a pair of shimmering, dark and luminous wings.

These wings seemed to breathe, opening and closing like a folding fan amidst the spiritual light. When open, they were a pair of wings; when closed, they were two flying swords.

What attracted Yang Ji was not only their peculiar shape but also their grade – this was actually a low-grade treasure artifact.

[Sword Wings, low-grade treasure artifact. Material: Black Essence Iron. Flight-type treasure artifact, can also be used as treasure armor or flying swords.]

"No wonder it can become a treasure artifact; it's Black Essence Iron. It seems this underground world isn't without treasures after all; Senior Fu Dongliu must have encountered a piece of Black Essence Iron." Yang Ji was overjoyed, hurrying over to pick up the Sword Wings, caressing them with fondness.

With these Sword Wings, his previous shortcoming in speed would be completely remedied.

Normally, a flight-type treasure artifact's speed was enough to rival that of an ordinary Nascent Soul True Monarch, like True Monarch Yin Zhi, being countless times faster than a peak Golden Core cultivator.

A single flap could carry him a thousand *li* – that was truly divine speed.

Although Yang Ji hadn't tried it yet, it didn't stop him from imagining its wonders.

With these Sword Wings, in a sense, he now possessed a complete set of peerless Daoist equipment. He no longer needed to bitterly "beg" the Evergreen Sect.

Yes, over the years, Yang Ji had learned from his master, Jian Yuanzi, that Baimei Supreme had always been trying to acquire the grand divine ability, Earth-Shrinking Golden Light.

Unfortunately, first there was Granny Tianshang causing trouble from within. After her demise, her disciple, True Monarch Yin Zhi, continued to maliciously obstruct.

And the Supreme of the Evergreen Sect would only feign helplessness, saying, "Brother Bai, it's truly not that I disagree; it's just that the elders in the sect have objections. As Supreme, I can't just cover the sky with one hand, can I? I also have to respect everyone's opinions."

As the sect's Supreme, he absolutely had the right to make decisions on all matters within the sect, but he used this as an excuse to refuse, colluding with the True Monarchs in the sect to put on a show, merely watching the spectacle with a smile.

One played the red face, one the white face, secretly toying with Baimei Supreme.

As a result, for so many years, no matter what conditions Baimei Supreme offered, the other party refused to exchange.

Oh, right.

The Evergreen Sect's Supreme did propose a "win-win" suggestion.

He once suggested that Li Changxiao nominally represent their Evergreen Sect to join the Dao Sect, but in essence, he would still be a disciple of the Azure Wave Sect. Everyone would be happy. This was truly a shameless good idea. If this were done, all the Dao Sect's rewards would fall into the Evergreen Sect's hands, while the Azure Wave Sect would gain nothing.

Baimei Supreme naturally refused outright.

So many years of effort yielding no results, he had completely given up on the idea a few years ago, deciding not to yearn for the Earth-Shrinking Golden Light technique anymore.

Baimei Supreme failed to acquire the Earth-Shrinking Golden Light technique, but Yang Ji had found this flight-type treasure artifact – truly a tremendous surprise.

Thus, he now had full confidence to challenge the Dao Sect.

If, with such ample preparation, he still couldn't join the Dao Sect... well, Yang Ji didn't believe that would happen.

Such a set of Daoist equipment was truly unrivaled among peers. Even if an Immortal Physique cultivator was at the same stage as him, he still had confidence to fight them.

With such profound backing and strength, passing the Dao Sect's assessment should not be difficult.

After happily putting away the Sword Wings, Yang Ji began to carefully examine the other items. He looked through all fifty-two spiritual light clusters in the room but found no second treasure artifact.

However, these magic tools and spirit tools were also crafted by Senior Fu Dongliu, making them top-grade among their peers. Yang Ji naturally took them all without hesitation.

Even if he couldn't use them, handing them over to the sect would be a large sum of wealth; he couldn't let them go.

Emerging from the artifact refining room, Yang Ji walked around other areas, but found no other treasures.

At this moment, he found himself staring at the houses.

They were all made from thousand-year Vajra Wood, and Vajra Wood was also a good material.

But he couldn't possibly dismantle someone's house, could he? That would be far too disrespectful.

If Senior Fu Dongliu were to return and see it, perhaps he would only shed tears of regret, thinking, "Why didn't I leave more treasures to fill his storage bag back then? This way, he wouldn't even dismantle my house."

Yang Ji's eyes flickered, and he took another look, but still didn't dare to act.

After all, that would be going too far. To take someone's inheritance and then dismantle their house – he couldn't bring himself to do it.

Speaking of which, Senior Fu Dongliu left behind cultivation techniques, bestowing a favor upon him. It was one thing not to repair the houses, but to dismantle them entirely? He absolutely couldn't do that.

Standing before the houses, he bowed deeply three times, then passed through the spatial teleportation array to the outside.

Then, flying out of the underwater waterfall, he found an uninhabited stone pillar, carved out a cave dwelling, and settled in.

He took out the Sword Wings and began to refine them.

***

A month later.

Night.

Yang Ji finally completed refining this low-grade treasure artifact.

With a single thought, the Sword Wings shrunk to palm size, burrowed into his body from his palm, and then grew out from his back.

Immediately, the Sword Wings rapidly expanded. *Clang clang clang!* Each sharp sword-wing easily pierced the stone wall. With a gentle flap, a burst of spiritual light erupted from the surface of the wings. With a *boom*, Yang Ji instantly broke through the stone pillar and flew out.

At this moment, the Sword Wings behind him stretched three *zhang* wide, constantly flapping and transforming.

Like a vine, *whoosh!* they instantly sliced through the air, darting ten *zhang* forward. They could also act as treasure armor, with the two wings closing in, radiating cold light, meticulously protecting him.

With a shift of thought, the Sword Wings transformed into a flying sword, shooting out from his palm. With a gentle swing, sword qi crisscrossed for ten *li*, slicing through the dark clouds in the sky.

With another thought, the Sword Wings grew from his back, spiritual light shimmering. A gentle flap of the wings, and he flew a *li* within a breath of wind.

This speed truly astonished and delighted Yang Ji, making him instantly fond of the Sword Wings to the extreme.

Like wings, yet like swords, remarkably similar to Dan Chenzi's Steel Flying Dagger Wings in "Legend of Zu," they were truly excellent for both offense and defense, and incredibly fast.

The more Yang Ji looked, the more he liked them. He immediately flapped his wings and rushed into the clouds. The world was instantly stretched into lines, rapidly streaking past his eyes.

Yang Ji wildly savored the extreme speed brought by the Sword Wings.

He passed through clouds, through vast celestial regions, flew over islands, and finally arrived at Black Wind Island.

Mang Biao, who was in meditation, sensed the immense aura appearing and burst out of the grand hall.

Seeing that it was Yang Ji, he was genuinely tearful, and threw himself forward to embrace him.

Yang Ji smiled and cleverly dodged, which made Mang Biao show a resentful expression, his heart-shaped black fur on his chest drooping.

Then, the two entered the hall and chatted happily, even inviting Fairy Huayu to dance.

Huayu was indeed beautiful and moving, with a soft body and a maiden's purity.

Facing a sect disciple like Yang Ji, her eyes showed no hint of desire for attachment, pure as water.

As their eyes met, Yang Ji found a profound indifference beneath her passionate gaze, as if she had seen through all worldly desires, and nothing seemed capable of stirring her interest. Yang Ji was somewhat curious, his gaze delving deeper into her eyes, wanting to explore the private depths of her indifference.

But Huayu retreated at that moment, her white skirt swaying, gracefully departing on a gentle breeze. Yang Ji could only regretfully touch the faint fragrance on the tip of his nose.

"Little brother, be careful your eyeballs don't get hooked out. Come, let's drink!" Mang Biao grinned mischievously, suddenly raising his wine cup and drinking loudly.

"Good, let's drink!" Yang Ji withdrew his gaze, also raising his wine cup, and drank heartily with everyone.

Three days later, Yang Ji departed, taking with him some high-grade Demon-Accompanying Grass and Demonic Cores.

In exchange, he had refined many pure Demonic Essence Pills for Mang Biao.

Mang Biao stood at the cliff edge. Above his head, Yang Ji saw a thought bubble reading: "So Pleased!" He reluctantly shouted, "Little brother, you must come back often to visit your big brother! Your big brother will definitely prepare more high-grade Demon-Accompanying Grass for you."

Yang Ji smiled and nodded, then left with a smile.

When no one was around, he finally summoned his Sword Wings, soared into the sky, and flew at extreme speed.

Flying along the Demonic Omen Sea, the scenery below constantly changed. Suddenly, Yang Ji's gaze fixed.

He actually saw two familiar figures below.

It was Huo Yuan and Jin Suanpan, flying along and chatting happily.

Yang Ji was surprised. How did Jin Suanpan get involved with Huo Yuan again?

He smiled slightly, then spread his wings and flew down, appearing ghost-like before the two of them.

The sudden appearance of a figure startled the two, and they immediately retreated.

But upon seeing the person before them with a faint smile on his lips and a very familiar appearance, they then cried out in surprise.

"Uncle-Master!"

"Grandmaster!"

Jin Suanpan saw Yang Ji wearing the Azure Wave Sect's robes and knew that he must have comprehended sword moves from the Sword Dao Reflection, and thus been accepted as a disciple by Jian Yuanzi. So, calling him Uncle-Master was normal.

Huo Yuan enthusiastically called him Grandmaster, greeting him with a smiling face.

"How did you two get together?" Yang Ji looked at them curiously, noting that Huo Yuan was wearing Azure Wave Sect robes, which gave him some guesses.

"Grandmaster, Jin Suanpan was introduced to me by Old Jin when I first joined the sect," Huo Yuan laughed.

"Yes, Uncle-Master, my thirty-eighth uncle introduced us," Jin Suanpan said with a chuckle.

"Oh, I see." Yang Ji nodded and said, "Are you two cultivating in the Demonic Omen Sea, or...?"

"Hehe, we're here to earn some small spirit stones," Jin Suanpan said with a low chuckle.

Even after several decades, seeing Jin Suanpan still reminded Yang Ji of past events, and he joked, "Are you two so openly trading in the Demonic Omen Sea? Aren't you afraid of being targeted by those with ill intentions?"

"Uncle-Master is joking. We're just small-time operations, and the pills we refine aren't high-grade. Others wouldn't bother targeting us."

Jin Suanpan looked at Yang Ji, also recalling the pleasant trading days of the past.

Those Temptation Pills were of superior quality, sought after by others, but the pills Huo Yuan refined were of ordinary grade, making trade a bit difficult.

Yang Ji saw through his thoughts and then looked at Huo Yuan, asking, "How many years of Demon-Accompanying Grass can you currently use to refine Temptation Pills? Can you refine Demonic Essence Pills yet?"

Huo Yuan awkwardly scratched his head, his beard wiggling, and chuckled dryly, "I've disgraced Grandmaster. Although I purchased a beast flame through the Jin Family Commercial Guild, I can currently only refine Demonic Essence Pills using seventy-year-old Demon-Accompanying Grass paired with sixth-grade demonic cores, and the quality isn't very good. I barely earn a few spirit stones."

"Oh?" Yang Ji smiled and suddenly said, "I'll give you a few pill recipes. If you refine according to them, I guarantee your pill formation rate and the quality of your pills will improve by several levels."

Huo Yuan suddenly jolted, his eyes wide, exclaiming, "Grandmaster, are they like the pill recipes for refining Spirit Essence Pills from last time?"

"Exactly!" Yang Ji nodded with a smile. Feeling that he had some affinity with Huo Yuan, and seeing that he was also from the Azure Wave Sect, he passed on all the improved pill recipes that he and True Monarch Qinghe had refined, only admonishing him, "These pill recipes are for your own study only; do not spread them indiscriminately."

"Thank you, Grandmaster, I understand!" Huo Yuan bowed respectfully, excitedly taking the pill recipes, his hands trembling.

The memories were still fresh; he had achieved peak alchemist status back then precisely because he had received such an improved pill recipe. Now, he had received a thick stack of such recipes – to what extent could they lead him?

His trembling heart dared not imagine too much.

Yang Ji saw the incredibly excited Huo Yuan and smiled, not thinking much of it himself.

His current perspective was countless times higher than Huo Yuan's.

He somewhat understood now why those reclusive experts, when encountering young juniors they liked, would not hesitate to give them a pointer or two, impart profound cultivation techniques, or explain the great Dao truths. Perhaps it was because their own realms were extraordinarily high, and the things they imparted were not considered that important in their eyes.

It truly fulfilled that saying: the cultivation technique you hold as a treasure in your hands might be something someone else could create with just a single thought.

The Thousand Island Sea was ultimately too small; shallow waters could not raise true dragons. Yang Ji would eventually leave this place.

But for Huo Yuan, the Thousand Island Sea was his entire world.

Yang Ji did not know that the pill recipes he gave would, several hundred years later, produce another Grandmaster Alchemist in the Thousand Island Sea.

...

After chatting with Jin Suanpan and Huo Yuan for a while, Yang Ji soared up and left the Demonic Omen Sea.

The Sword Wings displayed extreme speed. What used to take a month by boat now took only three days to return to the Azure Wave Sect with extreme flight.

Back in the sect, Yang Ji resumed his secluded cultivation.

With the Nine Revolutions Golden Core, he believed he could reach the peak of Golden Core within a few decades.

Cultivation days were dry, but also full of hope.

The process might be very hard, but the vision of becoming an immortal constantly motivated him.

Spring passed and winter came, seasons changed several times.

Twenty years passed in a flash.

Unbeknownst to him, Yang Ji was already eighty-six years old.

On this very day, he received a message from Jian Yuanzi.

"Disciple, the Supreme has called a meeting; he wants you to come too!"

"The Supreme called a meeting?" Yang Ji stood up without hesitation. The Supreme calling a meeting definitely concerned a major sect matter.

He immediately pushed open the secret chamber door and flew with his master, Jian Yuanzi, towards the deliberation hall.

When Yang Ji and Jian Yuanzi arrived, they found that all the Nascent Soul True Monarchs in the sect had come, and there were also two unfamiliar figures in the hall.

One was an old man sitting upright with a cheerful smile on his face. Facing Baimei Supreme and the True Monarchs, his demeanor was unusually composed, revealing his extraordinary nature within the ordinary.

Next to him sat a young man, broad-foreheaded and deep-set eyes, exuding an air of arrogance, practically looking down on everyone. He was extremely proud.

These two sat to the left of Baimei Supreme, their positions higher than the sect's Nascent Soul True Monarchs, clearly indicating their high status.

Yang Ji and Jian Yuanzi sat down. After a brief glance, Yang Ji saw that the old man was a Soul Transformation Supreme and seemed to know their own Supreme, so he roughly guessed his identity.

Indeed, Baimei Supreme's next words confirmed his guess.

"This is Qingyuan Supreme from the Evergreen Sect. Next to him is Dugu Yun, a rare genius of the Evergreen Sect, one encountered only once in a thousand years!"

Hearing this, the Nascent Soul True Monarchs of the Azure Wave Sect all looked towards the young man.

The young man was indeed courageous. Faced with the scrutiny and gazes of ten Nascent Soul True Monarchs, he didn't even frown, instead subtly raising his proud chin.

Yang Ji scanned him, slightly surprised, finding that he was actually a Spirit Physique – specifically, a Water Spirit Physique.

Spirit Physiques were rare in the Thousand Island Sea, so it was no wonder he was so proud; he indeed had capital to be arrogant.

"Hehe, Dugu Yun is my inner disciple. He possesses a Water Spirit Physique and has cultivated to the peak of Golden Core in just over a decade. He's much faster than virtuous nephew Changxiao was back then," Qingyuan Supreme chuckled.

Upon hearing this, everyone couldn't help but frown internally. These words carried a hint of disparagement.

Yang Ji glanced indifferently at Dugu Yun. Arrogant and conceited, almost looking at people through his nostrils. His temperament was far inferior to that of the steady and wise Senior Brother Changxiao.

Baimei Supreme swept a glance at the arrogant young man, then smiled and said, "Congratulations, Brother Qingyuan, on taking such a good disciple. With his outstanding talent, I wonder which 'Tribulation Palm' he has comprehended from your sect's great divine ability, the Nine Tribulations Palm?"

The smile on Qingyuan Supreme's face imperceptibly froze, but he chuckled, "My humble disciple is devoted to cultivation, and his comprehension of palm techniques is still quite recent. However, he has already comprehended the Fourth Tribulation Palm within a few years, his comprehension is astonishing."

"Oh? In that case, your disciple truly possesses a heaven-defying talent! Not only is his aptitude outstanding, but his comprehension is also top-notch. Brother Qingyuan, you've truly found an excellent disciple! The Evergreen Sect has a worthy successor; it's bound to shine brightly in a few hundred years." Baimei Supreme praised, but above his head, Yang Ji saw words appear: "If his comprehension is truly so astonishing, why did you wrinkle your brow? It seems his comprehension talent is far inferior to my Changxiao's."

Yang Ji found it amusing to see his Supreme secretly pleased.

"Brother Bai, you often mentioned in the past wanting to exchange divine abilities and techniques. Today, I've brought my humble disciple here because I wish to be a benevolent person, to facilitate a good outcome. I agree to exchange the Earth-Shrinking Golden Light technique," Qingyuan Supreme said with a smile.

"Oh?" Hearing this, Baimei Supreme's body suddenly straightened, and he looked at Qingyuan Supreme.

Qingyuan Supreme smiled, "The conditions are the same as last time: Brother Bai will bring all your divine abilities and techniques, and I have already brought the Earth-Shrinking Golden Light technique."

Baimei Supreme, however, hesitated, gently tapping the table. He looked at Dugu Yun, then at Qingyuan Supreme. Seeing the tables turned, Yang Ji noticed thoughts appear above his head: "A cold sneer" and "Do they truly take me for a fool?"

Yang Ji saw the information displayed above Baimei Supreme's head and thought he was about to reverse the conditions, but he was still too kind, truly a good person incapable of malicious intent. Instead, he said, "We'll do a one-for-one exchange: one grand divine ability for one grand divine ability."

Qingyuan Supreme feigned hesitation, but Yang Ji saw the thoughts "Ecstatic" and "This Baimei is truly foolish; he doesn't know how to seize the opportunity to raise the price, hehe" appear above his head. He then nodded hesitantly, "Alright, I'll concede a step. One for one it is."

"Haha, Xiao Ji, the Earth-Shrinking Golden Light is here! Your peerless Daoist equipment can finally be completed!" Baimei Supreme immediately winked at Yang Ji, happily transmitting his voice.

Yang Ji knew the Supreme was doing this for his benefit, fearing Qingyuan Supreme might back out, so he agreed for now.

But seeing Qingyuan Supreme's shamelessness, he couldn't stand it. He immediately transmitted his voice, "Supreme, don't trade with him!"
