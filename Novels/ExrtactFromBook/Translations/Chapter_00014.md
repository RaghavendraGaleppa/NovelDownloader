# Chapter 14: Possession  

Han Yue was determined to obtain the Thread Armor—it would be an immense boost to his combat capabilities.  

Keeping his composure, he asked, "Manager Zhang, may I ask how much this Thread Armor costs?"  

Manager Zhang replied, "To be honest with you, esteemed guest, although this item doesn't sell well here in Guizhou, it is still a meticulously crafted second-tier magical artifact. Its price is significantly higher than the [Earth-Splitting Lizard] heavy armor you saw earlier."  

"If you're genuinely interested, our shop would require 3,000 trade coins or an equivalent value in goods."  

Fang Yi couldn't hide her surprise, her expression shifting at the steep price.  

At that cost, her 330 trade coins were far from enough.  

Han Yue, however, remained unfazed. He summoned Xiao Liu and instructed him to fetch the items from his room.  

Xiao Liu returned quickly, carrying the white fox-fur bundle that had accompanied Han Yue for so long.  

Taking the bundle, Han Yue laid out its contents one by one on the table:  

Fourteen spirit stones, a pair of deer antlers, a spine bone, a pair of eyes, several teeth, and three thread-bound ancient books.  

This was the bulk of Han Yue's possessions.  

Having spent several months in Fenrou Market, he had become familiar with market prices. These materials should be worth a fair amount.  

Manager Zhang's eyes lit up at the sight. He called for an attendant to take the items upstairs for appraisal.  

A full half-hour later, the attendant returned with the results.  

After carefully reviewing them, Manager Zhang spoke to Han Yue, "These materials are quite valuable! Our shop is willing to offer a high price for them."  

"These three bloodline cultivation manuals—since we cannot verify their effectiveness—we'll purchase copies at a standard rate of 100 trade coins each."  

"As for the demon beast materials, they are all core components from second-tier creatures, refined through high-level primordial energy. Their essence is condensed, making them extremely valuable!"  

"For these items, we're willing to offer 500 trade coins. The deer antlers are of the highest quality—we'll pay 1,000 for them. That totals 2,500 trade coins."  

"The fourteen mid-grade spirit stones have a fixed purchase price of 100 trade coins each."  

"Altogether, your materials amount to 4,200 trade coins—more than enough to cover the Thread Armor."  

Xiao Liu couldn't help but ask, "These materials are so small—are they really from second-tier demon beasts?"  

Manager Zhang explained, "You may not be aware, but among demons, there are cultivators who rely on means other than bloodline power. These beings only operate within the demon kingdoms deep in the forests."  

"From the second tier onward, such cultivators can take human form, mastering various divine abilities. The most powerful among them are indistinguishable from humans."  

"These are materials from shape-shifting demons—priceless treasures."  

With that, Manager Zhang handed over the appraisal document for the deer antlers. It read:  

**[Snow Mountain Deer Antlers]**  
**Tier: Second**  
**Description: Material from a second-tier shape-shifting demon, refined through great power. The demonic energy has been purified and can be directly used in alchemy or artifact forging.**  

After some thought, Han Yue retrieved the fourteen mid-grade spirit stones from the tray and sold everything else.  

Combined with the trade coins from selling the Bronze Ram, he managed to gather exactly 3,000, finally securing the Thread Armor.  

Once again, Han Yue had successfully converted his resources into much-needed combat strength.  

With the transaction complete, the trio took their leave from Manager Zhang.  

They then split up—Fang Yi dragged Xiao Liu off to continue shopping for supplies, while Han Yue, gripping his cleaver, headed straight for the central square. Having been away for days without cutting meat, his hands were itching for action!  

That night, after a hearty meal, Han Yue sat cross-legged in his room for his daily cultivation.  

His practice of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* had stabilized, and all he needed now was persistence.  

Once his session ended, Han Yue took out the Thread Armor and began his first refinement.  

Holding the armor, he channeled his thunder-based mana into it.  

The mana flowed through the threads effortlessly, as if encountering no resistance. Under its influence, the armor shimmered with a faint iridescent glow.  

Gradually, Han Yue's consciousness merged with it, sensing the armor responding to his call as if it had a breath of its own.  

The Thread Armor in his hand began to move, spreading like liquid over his palm.  

Then, it crept up his arm, slowly enveloping his entire body.  

Han Yue felt as though the armor was a bottomless abyss, endlessly draining his mana.  

The thunder energy stored in his body was quickly depleted, forcing him to draw upon the reserves within *Thoughtless Slash*.  

Finally, the Thread Armor fully covered him, forming an intricate web of microscopic filaments across his skin.  

His mana circulated through the threads, merging with the armor to create his first line of defense.  

Han Yue could sense the rapid integration between his energy and the armor.  

After some time, the armor stabilized, ceasing its mana absorption.  

Running his fingers over his skin, Han Yue found the Thread Armor seamlessly adhered to him—invisible, colorless, and incredibly thin.  

To an outside observer, it was undetectable, and it didn’t interfere with his daily life in the slightest.  

He took out the *Genggold Blade Seed* and tested it against his palm. Without using mana, the blade couldn’t pierce the armor’s defense.  

Only when he infused the blade with a trace of mana did it barely manage to cut through.  

Yet, as soon as he withdrew the blade, the Thread Armor quickly repaired itself under the influence of his mana.  

Han Yue was thoroughly satisfied. The armor provided outstanding defense, self-repair, concealment, and comfort.  

Most importantly, it had growth potential—it could evolve with further refinement and might even transform into a divine ability in the future.  

The Thread Armor significantly eased Han Yue’s survival anxieties, allowing him to fight with greater confidence.  

However, there was one major drawback for Han Yue at this stage:  

The armor consumed an excessive amount of mana!  

Just this first refinement had nearly exhausted the thunder energy stored in his *Thoughtless Slash* seal—over 80% depleted.  

And this was after months of accumulation since arriving in Fenrou Market!  

Worse yet, further refinement would require even more mana—an astronomical amount.  

Han Yue’s *Body-Nourishing Thunder* cultivation could barely sustain the needs of *Thoughtless Slash* and *Earth-Treading Golden Light Technique* alongside his own growth.  

Adding the Thread Armor to the equation would create a severe mana deficit!
