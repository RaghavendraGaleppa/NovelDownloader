# Chapter 11: Choice Three

The middle-aged cultivator’s expression shifted, and he immediately chuckled, "Haha, so these are pills refined by Master Hegu! No wonder the quality is so good. I'm willing to offer five hundred spirit stones for this bottle."

"Eh, these were personally refined by Master Hegu! I'll offer five hundred and twenty spirit stones for them," someone flattered, not forgetting to cast a friendly glance at the young man.

"I'll offer five hundred and thirty spirit stones," another cultivator chimed in.

Everyone wanted to curry favor with Hegu. After all, befriending a peak alchemist would bring many benefits in the future.

From a high-rise in the Mo Family's shop, Master Hegu cast a proud and triumphant gaze down.

Following the information display, Yang Ji looked up and saw a radiant old man at a sixth-floor window of the Mo Family's establishment. He was sipping spiritual tea and watching the young man's area, a broad smile of satisfaction on his face, clearly in high spirits.

Opposite Hegu sat a middle-aged man in luxurious robes, who was currently fawning, "Master Hegu, within three days, all cultivators on South Wind Island will know that you've become a peak alchemist. You'll be incredibly busy in the coming days, and I imagine you'll receive so many congratulatory gifts your hands will go soft."

"Hehe, I owe much to Shopkeeper Mo for providing me with a vast supply of spiritual herbs for practice; otherwise, I wouldn't have reached this point," Hegu chuckled.

"We merely benefit each other, Master Hegu. You're too modest. With your alchemy skills, any shop would offer you such treatment. It is our Mo Family's honor that you chose us," the middle-aged man replied with a smile.

Hegu seemed to greatly enjoy the flattery, his smile deepening.

Below, Yang Ji watched this scene dispassionately.

He then turned, looking towards the Myriad Treasure Pavilion with a contemplative expression.

With a thousand spirit stones in his possession, he currently had four choices:

1.  He could go to the Myriad Treasure Pavilion to buy pills for cultivation and increase his cultivation base.
2.  He could purchase a low-grade magic artifact, then venture out to sea to acquire cultivation resources.
3.  He could return to his residence to absorb the spiritual energy from the spirit stones to enhance his cultivation.
4.  He could boldly take a step, buy an alchemy furnace, spiritual herbs, and pill recipes, learn alchemy, and become an alchemist.

He immediately rejected the third choice. Absorbing spiritual energy from spirit stones was too slow; converting them into pills of equivalent value for cultivation was much faster.

He pondered the first and second choices for a moment, then also shook his head. Buying pills for cultivation was too short-sighted. As for venturing out to sea, the risk was too great, and it would waste a lot of time.

After much thought, he ultimately chose the fourth option. For no other reason than that pills were simply too expensive.

To reach the tenth layer of Qi Condensation within ten years, he absolutely needed high-quality pills to accelerate his cultivation speed. However, a bottle of top-grade low-tier spiritual pills cost five hundred spirit stones. He simply couldn't afford them. Cultivation wasn't for a moment, but for a lifetime.

So, he decided to leave such hardship to others. He resolved to become an alchemist and provide himself with cultivation pills. Among the Hundred Arts of Cultivation, alchemy was the most profitable trade. The immediate benefits were good, and the future profits would be boundless.

With one skill in hand, one could traverse the world.

Yang Ji instantly firmed his resolve.

With this decision made, he headed towards the Myriad Treasure Pavilion.

"Young Brother Yang, are you looking to buy an alchemy furnace, pill recipes, spiritual herbs, and fire-attribute spells? Are you planning to learn the art of alchemy?" Jin Dafu asked curiously.

"Precisely. I wonder what the prices are for these?" Yang Ji settled down beside him and inquired.

"Haha, Young Brother Yang, you are our Myriad Treasure Pavilion's Ship Guardian! Since you wish to learn the art of alchemy, our Myriad Treasure Pavilion will naturally provide you with convenience," Jin Dafu said with a smile.

"Oh? What convenience?" Yang Ji's eyes lit up.

Jin Dafu continued with a smile, "You don't need to buy fire-attribute spells. There's earth fire for alchemy in the cave behind our Myriad Treasure Pavilion. This is much better than the flames produced by those low-level fire-attribute spells and can significantly increase your pill success rate."

"Earth fire? Really?" Yang Ji's expression brightened with joy. Knowing the importance of flame, he spoke up to confirm.

"How could I joke with Young Brother? Everything I said is true. There's a high-level alchemist behind our Myriad Treasure Pavilion, and we provide him with earth fire. If you want to refine pills, you can just go and use it," Jin Dafu chuckled.

So that was it! Yang Ji suddenly understood. The earth fire was already burning there; one person using it was using it, and two people using it would gain them an extra favor and bind Yang Ji more firmly to them.

Jin Dafu's abacus rattled loudly.

However, with free earth fire available, Yang Ji gratefully accepted this favor. He cupped his hands and said, "Then I shall thank Old Jin in advance."

Jin Dafu's eyes gleamed as he chuckled, "Young Brother is the Ship Guardian, so this convenience is only right. Just be on call for sea expeditions in the future."

This Jin Dafu indeed wasn't someone who would take a loss; he always found ways to get it back. But this was a loss Yang Ji was happy to take.

"Young Brother, I can provide you with the earth fire and pill recipes, but you'll have to purchase the spiritual herbs for alchemy and the alchemy furnace from me," Jin Dafu said with a sly smile. He was a merchant, after all, and couldn't do a losing business.

However, these points were already within Yang Ji's considerations. The resolution of the flame and pill recipes had already made him very happy.

Immediately, Yang Ji asked, "Old Jin, what are the prices for an alchemy furnace and the spiritual herbs needed to refine Spirit Bloom Pills?"

"A low-grade alchemy furnace costs around one thousand to three thousand spirit stones."

"As for the spiritual herbs needed to refine low-grade spiritual pills, one set costs about two hundred spirit stones."

"One set of spiritual herbs at two hundred spirit stones, if there's no medicinal potency loss during refinement, can yield ten pills, which can be divided into two bottles. Each bottle is worth around two hundred spirit stones, of course, this is for low-tier low-grade spiritual pills. If the refined pills are of high-grade quality like those refined by Master Hegu, then one bottle can sell for at least five hundred spirit stones. If the pills reach peak-grade quality, then one bottle can sell for at least seven hundred spirit stones."

"Of course, ten pills in two bottles is only the theoretical maximum yield. For a beginner, the spoilage rate is practically one hundred percent."

Jin Dafu grinned, "Young Brother, if you truly want to learn alchemy, I suggest you prepare a few dozen more sets of spiritual herbs, otherwise you won't learn anything at all."

"When Young Brother buys spiritual herbs from me in the future, the more you buy, the better the price. You are our Myriad Treasure Pavilion's Ship Guardian, so I'll give you the maximum nine-tenths discount."

Jin Dafu sighed, "Ah, Young Brother, if you truly can become a Grand Alchemist, I can also enjoy the good life!"

"Why?" Yang Ji asked.

"High-grade pills are rare! Sometimes we have the spiritual herbs but can't find anyone to refine them, which is why our Myriad Treasure Pavilion only sells low-grade spiritual pills; we don't have any mid-grade or high-grade ones."

Jin Dafu rubbed his brow, a bitter smile on his face, "Our Myriad Treasure Pavilion has collected quite a lot of spiritual herbs, but that alchemist in the back mountain is already too busy. He spends all day with the earth fire, and his temper has gotten quite volatile."

"Pills are in short supply, and demand is high. It makes me anxious to see these spiritual herbs unable to be converted into spirit stones."

"Oh?" Yang Ji's eyes flickered, and he chuckled, "Old Jin, why don't you let me refine those spiritual herbs? Once I become a Grand Alchemist, I guarantee you'll have an endless supply of pills and boundless spirit stones."

Jin Dafu hastily waved his hand, letting out a dry laugh, "This won't do. It's not that I don't trust you, Young Brother, but becoming an alchemist truly requires talent."

"Of course, if Young Brother really becomes a Grand Alchemist in the future, then our Myriad Treasure Pavilion's spiritual herb vault will be open to you. After refining the pills, excluding the cost of materials, we can even split the profits fifty-fifty!"

"Is Old Jin's word true?" Yang Ji stared at him.

"I'm laying my words right here. If there's any falsehood, you can curse me, Jin Dafu, to never earn another spirit stone again!" Jin Dafu patted his chest.

"Good, I'll remember Old Jin's words," Yang Ji smiled slightly. With his 'golden finger', what couldn't he learn?

Alchemy? Though he hadn't tried it yet, he firmly believed in his golden finger.

"Young Brother, just put in the effort, and I'll be waiting for you to clear out my inventory!" Jin Dafu said with a wide grin.
