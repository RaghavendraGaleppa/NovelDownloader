# My Undying Cheat - Chapter 170: First

"That's…"

Zhou Tian's face was filled with shock. This was an unbelievable sight. This was the Star Realm, where countless dazzling points of light were individual worlds. Yet, here stood such an enormous mountain, truly incredible.

"The Star Realm contains many Forbidden Lands, incredibly dangerous. Their existence has been recorded since the very concept of the Star Realm was first proposed. No one can explain how they came to be. The mountain before us is one such place. It is named First!" Shengmo gazed at the distant divine mountain, a hint of emotion in his eyes. It was an unimaginable wonder.

"The very lair of the Abyss Tomb, which occupies the eleventh spatial node, is one such place—a graveyard of realms. When a world perishes, its fragmented body is drawn by some mysterious force to the Abyss Tomb. Within it, however, are sentient beings, the Abyss Tomb clan. Their race is unique; no one has ever figured out how they came to be. Though their numbers are few, every single one of them is an apex expert."

"Other Forbidden Lands have also vaguely rumored the existence of life forms, but these rumors have never been confirmed. This First Mountain is no different." Zhou Tian's eyes flickered, his heart surging. He never expected the Star Realm to hide so many secrets.

Moments later, he asked, "Is the Celestial Venerable Tomb within the First Mountain?"

"No, even Celestial Venerables might not be qualified to be buried within this mountain." Shengmo shook his head. "That tomb is on a star ring encircling it, nearby."

"Celestial Venerables aren't even qualified? Aren't they already the strongest beings?" Zhou Tian was slightly stunned by Shengmo's words. What did he mean? Were there even stronger existences above Celestial Venerables? Although he had never seen a Celestial Venerable fight, he had witnessed a Dao Lord level expert in action. Even with his [Holy Word] skill amplified by revival counts, it could only restrain them for a mere instant. He even doubted if his skill would have any effect at the Celestial Venerable realm.

While many skill descriptions in the Undying System stated they ignored cultivation levels, some also noted that their effect might be adjusted based on the opponent's strength.

"Strongest?" Shengmo scoffed, not at Celestial Venerables themselves, but at the word "strongest."

"There is no strongest. Once, a Celestial Venerable was blasted into a bloody mist on the mountainside of this very mountain by some creature or divine ability, without even his divine soul escaping. At that time, other Celestial Venerables were observing, but they couldn't discern anything."

"An old man from the Ancient Land, which occupies the first spatial node, once sat atop this mountain for a hundred years. After a long sigh, he departed unharmed. Both were Celestial Venerables; who was stronger, who was weaker?"

"The path to becoming stronger has no end; one can only keep moving forward. And those who walked before us, who knows what heights they have already reached." Shengmo sighed, his pupils unfocused, as if lost in thought. A moment later, he regained his composure.

"Alright, knowing all this now won't do you much good. Follow me."

"It's not like I asked you to tell me," Zhou Tian grumbled.

Shengmo pretended not to hear and led Zhou Tian towards the divine mountain towering in the void.

The spatial passage Shengmo chose led them very close to the First Mountain. They didn't fly for long before reaching their destination.

The mountain was majestic and vast, covered in various flowers and grasses. It didn't look much different from an ordinary mountain, just magnified countless times. A single blade of grass had leaves nearly a hundred zhang long. Though lush and green, they pointed straight to the sky, like sharp swords.

The mountain was encircled by layer upon layer of star rings, all composed of special stone materials. Ordinary stones could not exist in the void, let alone form star rings near this First Mountain.

These star rings were densely packed, stretching as far as the eye could see.

In some areas, on some star rings, blood qi soared to the sky, and various strange phenomena emerged, enough to awe an entire region.

"Stop looking. Although it's very dangerous here, there are also many opportunities. Innumerable cultivators enter the First Mountain daily for cultivation. They don't need to conceal themselves here; strength reigns supreme!" Shengmo said, bringing Zhou Tian to settle on a star ring at the very edge. Even here, there was someone present—a Great Emperor, who, intimidated by a single glance from Shengmo, scurried away.

"Wait." Shengmo casually found a spot, sat down, and closed his eyes.

"Wait?"

"So, we're not just directly opening the tomb and looting it?" Zhou Tian asked.

"What are you thinking? That's a Celestial Venerable's tomb. You can't just walk in, and the method to open it isn't in my hands. So, we have to wait." Shengmo said, runes emerging from his body, and blue lotuses blooming in the void.

"???" Zhou Tian was full of questions.

"So you just knew there was a Celestial Venerable's tomb here, that it contained something you wanted, and then you took such a huge risk to bring me here? And now we have to secretly follow others in? I'm speechless."

"Otherwise? My two personalities are both at the Heavenly King realm. Our Dao hearts are incomparably firm. Even if I try my best to avoid it, being in the same body inevitably leads to conflict. If I don't resolve it soon, I'll wish I were dead." Shengmo said. This was also why he took such a big risk threatening Zhou Tian. If he didn't take a gamble, his fate would be miserable.

"Is fusion the only way? Can't you separate them using a method like an external avatar?" Zhou Tian asked.

"This is precisely what makes me unique. I don't have two souls in one body, but one soul with two personalities. Both personalities are born dependent on the same soul. I once tried to tear my soul apart, but the torn-off soul still contained two personalities. So, fusion is the only path I can take." Shengmo said. How could he not have thought of this method? But it was useless. Only that Wutian Buddha's situation was somewhat similar to his, where Buddha and Demon were one. That's why he was taking this gamble.

"Alright, alright," Zhou Tian said helplessly, looking at the myriad star rings. From time to time, streams of light headed towards the First Mountain. Then, a bad thought suddenly popped into his head.

"Um, the phenomenon when the Celestial Venerable's tomb opens shouldn't be too big, right?"

Shengmo opened his eyes, glanced at Zhou Tian, and smiled faintly. "No, it'll just be something like golden lotuses gushing for ten thousand li from the ground, and blood rain falling for several zhang from the sky."

"My *&#!"

"Just"? This is "just"? The people sitting on these star rings aren't blind, they're all powerful experts! With such a huge commotion, how could they not notice? Zhou Tian sat on the ground. Men are all liars. He even said, "I just need the sarira; the rest is yours." With so many people entering, some even Dao Lord level, it would be a miracle if anything was left!
