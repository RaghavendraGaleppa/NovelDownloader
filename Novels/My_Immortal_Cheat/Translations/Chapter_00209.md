# Chapter 209: Refining the Burial Scroll

"You go recuperate first. There's still a big guy waiting for me here."

Behind Zhou Tian's head, the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel slowly rotated, emanating incredibly profound fluctuations.

Holy Demon turned to look at the mass of bloody substance. Even he could feel something terrifying brewing within it.

"Alright."

Holy Demon flew off into the distance with his battered body.

Zhou Tian glanced at his remaining skill time. After this series of battles, he had about five seconds left on his skills.

However, he wasn't worried in the slightest, because he still had one resurrection chance, which meant he could use the [Cultivation Replication] skill once more. The [Cultivation Replication] skill had no usage limit; if he had enough resurrection chances, he could keep using it indefinitely.

The bloody mass churned incessantly, revealing a crimson body that looked like human skin, yet also seemed subtly different.

"Newborn..."

The crimson body's hoarse voice emerged, and Zhou Tian suddenly understood. No wonder those original remains were so afraid of merging; it was because once they merged, their divine souls would also fuse into a new consciousness, no longer themselves.

"Second brother, are you awake?"

Zhou Tian, tens of thousands of miles away from the creature, called out from afar, his eyes a little red. Since this consciousness was newborn, perhaps he could trick it.

"Die!"

The crimson body's cold gaze fixed on Zhou Tian. Although its consciousness was new, it clearly knew who the enemy was.

*Bang!*

Zhou Tian was sent flying backward, a crimson fist print appearing on his chest. The void was shattered, and its repair speed was significantly slowed.

"Wutian, I'll screw your ancestors!"

Zhou Tian cursed, feeling like Wutian had tricked him. This thing was too strong.

*Boom!*

The void shattered again. The crimson creature's eyes were icy, its fists entwined with bloody light. Divine demons roared within, exuding terrifying power.

Zhou Tian focused all his attention. A sea of chaotic lightning descended, countless lightning dragons churning, causing the void to vibrate incessantly.

This crimson creature was unbelievably strong. Zhou Tian even suspected it had truly reached the Heavenly Venerate realm, unlike his own half-baked Heavenly Venerate state, which couldn't contend with it.

The sea of chaotic lightning was shattered, myriad bolts of lightning extinguished. The crimson creature's fists broke through all laws. Lightning striking its body felt like mere tickles, having no effect whatsoever.

*Bang!* Another muffled thud. Zhou Tian spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, which landed on the ground, creating lush greenness. Heavenly Venerate blood nourished the earth, only to be instantly destroyed by the aftermath of the battle.

The Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel hummed, an Yin-Yang Dao diagram wrapping around Zhou Tian, imbued with the aura of life and death.

*Clang!*

The crimson fist slammed onto the Yin-Yang Dao diagram. As Yin and Yang flowed, and life and death circulated, Zhou Tian actually felt a trace of life force flowing into his body. This Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel actually converted a part of the attack into life force, truly profound.

"Die!"

The crimson creature roared, infinite blood river light condensing on its fists.

*Crack!*

The Yin-Yang Dao diagram shattered, and Zhou Tian was sent flying backward again, smashing through several primordial mountains.

"Good, very good."

Zhou Tian's eyes blazed with ferocity; he too had been provoked into true fury. He constantly monitored his skill time. With two seconds left, he just needed to ensure he wasn't beaten to death within those two seconds.

Enveloped by the Yin-Yang Dao diagram, thick earthen-yellow energy swirled around him, and a primordial mountain covered him. He became a shrinking turtle.

A Heavenly Venerate's speed was incredibly fast; countless punches could be thrown in a single second. Zhou Tian continuously vomited blood, his eyes fixed intently on the crimson creature.

Finally, his eyes brightened. The Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel instantly erupted, Yin and Yang revolving, life and death cycling, a vast energy temporarily blasting the crimson creature away.

Then, he instantly retracted the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel. The next instant, his aura rapidly dwindled, then quickly rose again as if in nirvana.

"Damn it, was that fun?"

Zhou Tian grabbed the fist of the crimson creature that was attacking him again, his eyes chilling. The Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel reappeared behind his head.

Just now, the duration of his first use of the [Cultivation Replication] skill had ended. So, he used the powerful burst of the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel to temporarily blast the crimson creature away.

He had retracted the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel because his true cultivation was only at the Dharma Manifestation Realm, and the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel would directly drain him dry.

Now, he had set the [Cultivation Replication] target to this crimson creature, completely matching its strength. But one shouldn't forget that Zhou Tian still had the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel.

Although the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel was a Heavenly Venerate artifact, even the strongest magic treasure depended on its wielder. Earlier, Zhou Tian's strength was inferior to that of the crimson creature, so the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel's power was naturally limited. But now, it was different.

*Boom!*

The Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel erupted with light. The Yin-Yang Dao diagram once again enveloped Zhou Tian, slowly rotating, shattering the surrounding space.

*Bang!*

The crimson creature's fist slammed heavily onto the Yin-Yang Dao diagram, but it had no effect. Zhou Tian, however, sneered.

He spread his five fingers, lightning wrapping around his arm, and the void trembled as he directly sent the crimson creature flying.

Relying on the protection of the Yin-Yang Dao diagram, he paid no heed to the crimson creature's attacks.

The situation was completely reversed. The earth trembled, the void continuously shattered, and the crimson creature was dazed from the beating.

Meanwhile, on the other side, the Burial Scroll floating above the central plaza continued to tremble. The crimson cover was almost entirely engulfed by black.

Huang Qi's face showed excitement, as this signified that the Burial Scroll was about to be truly refined.

"Roar!"

Zhou Tian's fist, which was about to smash into the crimson creature's face, stopped. This was because the creature before him trembled all over, and wisps of bloody mist drifted out, dissipating.

"Fellow Daoist, you can stop now."

Zhou Tian turned his head to look. In the central plaza, the person from the Border Prison reappeared, holding a black book in his right hand, looking at him with a smile.

It seemed he had completely refined the Burial Scroll.

Zhou Tian, being a Heavenly Venerate at this moment, felt it deeply: this distinguished figure from the Border Prison was also a Heavenly Venerate.

His heart stirred, and his expression turned solemn as he descended from the void.

"My disciple told me that Fellow Daoist is an ancient figure from the Border Prison. Might I know your esteemed name, to see if this old man is familiar with it?"

Zhou Tian's eyes became profound, seemingly containing the vastness of stars.

Beside him, Holy Demon stepped forward and respectfully called out, "Master."

Zhou Tian nodded feignedly, secretly giving Holy Demon a thumbs up. The cooperation was excellent.

People from these major forces were extremely shrewd; they might well covet Zhou Tian's bizarre abilities and attack him. Therefore, a reasonable explanation was needed.

"Oh, I see now. So, Fellow Daoist has come by possessing someone." The Border Prison dignitary said.

"Indeed. My disciple was out adventuring, and as a master, I couldn't help but worry, so I gave him a little something for self-defense."

Zhou Tian said calmly, the Yin-Yang Life-Death Wheel behind him radiating light, his eyes brilliant, his aura as profound as an abyss and as majestic as a rainbow, his hands clasped behind his back.

"Then I must thank Fellow Daoist for your righteous intervention this time." The Border Prison dignitary smiled, his expression unfathomable, making it unclear whether he truly believed Zhou Tian or not.
