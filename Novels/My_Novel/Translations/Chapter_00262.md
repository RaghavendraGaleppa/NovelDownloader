Chapter 262: Pure Yang Scripture, Purifying the Five Organs

Wen Caishang adjusted her skirt, brushed off the dust, and sat up straight.

"As the saying goes, one who stays near vermilion is stained red, and one who stays near ink is stained black."

"That scoundrel Li Xian tells lies without blinking, even daring to deceive me. Since you are so close to him, surely your words cannot be trusted either."

"Please think of another way to prove your identities and dispel my suspicions."

Luo Xia hesitated, carefully observing Wen Caishang. She sensed that beyond Wen Caishang's anger was the resentment of a betrayed heart. No matter how she handled it, it would be hard to satisfy her.

Suddenly, a guard stammered, "Madam... Madam, I..."

Wen Caishang glanced sideways. "Speak."

The guard said, "I... I only joined the Martial Commander Hall recently. I don't know Li Xian well. I didn't know... he was such a scoundrel."

Before he finished, Wang Wu and Zhang Hou glared at him furiously. To save his life, the guard gritted his teeth and said, "So, the saying 'one who stays near vermilion is stained red' doesn't apply to me. I haven't received his kindness or enjoyed his benefits. If I meet Li Xian, I won't cover for him. I will report him to you immediately."

Zhang Hou roared, "Good for you, traitor!" He kicked out in anger. The guard, knowing he could no longer stay in the Martial Commander Hall after saying those words, tore all pretense of cordiality aside and dodged the attack.

Wen Caishang flicked her sleeve. A wave of劲气 (vital energy) swept over Zhang Hou, rolling him across the ground and carving a trench in the earth. Suddenly, he began to itch all over, rolling in the dirt and wailing in agony.

The劲气 was mixed with a chilling aura, seeping into his body, rushing up and down, causing unbearable pain and itching, torturing him to the extreme.

Wen Caishang said, "It seems you know where that scoundrel is. Please tell me quickly."

Zhang Hou endured the intense pain, his nose stinging. Seeing Wen Caishang's fierce demeanor, he knew he wouldn't survive. He said, "Madam... I really don't know. Even if... even if I did, I couldn't tell you!"

Wen Caishang said coldly, "You aren't afraid I'll take your life?"

Zhang Hou replied, "I am, and I am not."

Wen Caishang found it strange. "What is so special about that scoundrel that you protect him so?" Zhang Hou said respectfully, "If... if you ask about his special qualities, this humble one is ignorant and cannot say. Perhaps the Martial Commander... he is special in every way."

"Zhang Hou was born in poverty and suffered scorn since childhood. When the Yellow Dragon Army attacked the city, the city conscripted young men to defend it. That is how I got a position as a guard in the government office."

"However, the guards in the government office were mostly sycophants who bullied the people and extorted money. In my confusion, I followed the crowd. It wasn't until I entered the Martial Commander Hall and understood my true heart that I truly began to live."

"Please kill me, Madam. I don't know the Martial Commander's whereabouts, and even if I did, I wouldn't say."

His voice was sincere.

Wang Wu and the others said, "Madam Wen, kill or skin us as you wish."

Luo Xia stopped speaking and stepped to the side, blocking the others. Wen Caishang, however, looked distracted, gazing into the distance.

Mixed emotions surged within her. "My Li Lang is so excellent. What they said isn't wrong... to make people willing to die for him... there is no other way." She couldn't help thinking of Li Xian, her eyes intoxicated with affection, lost in thought for a long time.

"If you ask about his special qualities, I know them best. A talent unparalleled in ages, a handsome appearance, hmm, his temper is erratic, and he is terribly bad."

Her thoughts drifted, sometimes smiling, sometimes pouting. She remained silent for a long time. Luo Xia and the others felt their lives hung by a thread and dared not observe Wen Caishang's expression. So, they didn't know...

After a long while, Wen Caishang pointed at the guard who had tried to clear his name and said softly, "Step forward."

The guard was overjoyed and said, "Madam, what are your instructions?"

Wen Caishang said, "I have a matter to ask you." The guard said, "Please ask, Madam. I will tell you everything I know."

Wen Caishang said, "You said you haven't received his kindness. But your clothes and food—do they come from the Martial Commander Hall?"

The guard was taken aback. "Though they come from the Martial Commander Hall, but..." Wen Caishang said, "Your salary and emoluments—do they come from the Martial Commander Hall?"

The guard said, "Madam, please rest assured. These salaries have nothing to do with Li Xian. I will not cover for him because of them."

Wen Caishang said, "Is that so? Miss Luo... the properties in this city, the flow of funds in the Martial Commander Hall, are all related to Li Xian, aren't they?"

Luo Xia pondered and said, "Indeed!"

Wen Caishang was furious. "You two-faced thief! You learned nothing of his good points, but learned to lie without blinking. Kill yourself." She turned her hand and吸 (sucked) Wang Wu's sword into her hand, then threw it at the guard's feet.

The guard was stunned. Wen Caishang said calmly, "If you don't kill yourself within three breaths, I will make you experience the pain of having your flesh peeled and bones removed." Her voice was gentle.

The guard was completely confused. Why did Zhang Hou survive after such defiance, while he, by trying to clear his name, was risking his life?

Luo Xia roared, "Villain!" She swung her sword and劈 (slashed) through the guard's heart, killing him on the spot.

She panted heavily. She knew Wen Caishang's style well. If the guard had delayed any longer, he would have experienced the pain of having his flesh peeled and bones removed. Although she was annoyed by the guard's betrayal and lack of integrity, they had been together for months, and she couldn't bear to see him suffer, so she gave him a quick death.

Wen Caishang said, "I hate being lied to the most. This man was extremely dishonest. Please let the next one prove his innocence."

Luo Xia said, "Whether we are innocent or not, Madam, you have already made up your mind. There is no need for us to prove anything."

"How you deal with us, we have no objections."

Wen Caishang found it uninteresting. She had wanted to vent her anger, but seeing everyone's loyalty and sincerity toward Li Xian, although she was extremely annoyed with Li Xian, her anger inexplicably dissipated, leaving her heart in turmoil.

She wanted to kill again, but she couldn't.

Seeing that it was getting late and the medicinal soup was almost ready, Wen Caishang walked out of the hall gracefully and left.

Luo Xia and the others were all stunned. They waited silently for a while and heard no movement. Luo Xia quietly walked to the outer gate, saw that Wen Caishang was already gone, and finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Wang Wu said, "Brother Zhang, are you okay?" Zhang Hou shook his head. "I'm fine."

Luo Xia said solemnly, "Really okay?" She took his pulse and examined him carefully. He had internal bleeding and bruised organs. The injuries were not light, but he would recover after a few days of rest.

Luo Xia found it strange. "How strange! How strange!"

Zhang Hou's face was pale. "It seems I can't escape death after all." Luo Xia laughed. "What are you thinking? I mean your injuries are surprisingly light!"

Luo Xia said, "The Sword-Breaking Madam is known for her ruthless methods. Even if she spares someone's life, she makes them suffer torment, wishing for death."

"You defied her today. According to reason... breaking your hands and feet would be the lightest punishment. But... your injuries are so light. That's why it's so strange."

Zhang Hou said, "In that case, it is indeed strange." Luo Xia came to her senses and guessed that although Wen Caishang was looking for trouble, she must have an unusual feeling for Li Xian.

Luo Xia thought to herself, "'One who stays near vermilion is stained red, and one who stays near ink is stained black'? Is it because she loves him, so she loves those around him? Does Li Xian really have the ability to make the dignified Sword-Breaking Madam love him so? What kind of magic did he use?"

Looking at the corpse on the ground, she understood even more clearly. "If it's really because she loves him, so she loves those around him, then this guy's sudden betrayal deserves his death. Wen Caishang loves Li Xian to the extreme and came to find fault to vent her anger, but considering Li Xian, she really might not have killed him. But... you suddenly betrayed him, weren't you just asking for trouble?"

Having figured it out, she immediately felt relieved.

Li Xian spent two days traveling to "Baishan Prefecture". He ate two pancakes in the morning and evening, walked, and practiced martial arts... It was monotonous but fulfilling. Heaven rewards diligence.

The inheritance from the tomb: Crane Middle Dan, Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian, Recipe: Sword Riding, A Marriage Contract.

『Marriage Contract』 and 『Recipe』 were still far away. "Crane Middle Dan" and "Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian" were right before his eyes, contained in his mind. Li Xian felt that he was already a hundred miles away from Yihe Manor.

His mind was exhausted.

It was noon, and the sun was blazing.

Summer was approaching, and the cicadas were chirping noisily.

Li Xian stepped on the Starlight Steps, leaping to cover ground. The proficiency of the Seven Star Steps was [2899]. His movements were light and graceful.

He hung on a tree branch, looked into the distance, and saw a lake. Several travelers were undressing, cooling off in the lake. Li Xian held a mat, looked at the sky, the heat was scorching and unbearable, so he also undressed and jumped into the cool lake water.

He had already manifested the characteristics of the second realm of martial arts, having gone through the process of "clear ascension and turbid descent", so he didn't dare to go too deep into the water. He used vines as ropes, tied to the tree trunks by the lake.

He grabbed the vines and soaked in the lake water. His body sank as soon as it touched the water, as if weighed down by a thousand pounds.

After cooling down, he pulled the vines and leaped out of the water.

With a "splash", water scattered everywhere.

Li Xian felt refreshed all over, his mind clear. He tied his long hair up simply. He sat down nearby, untied his backpack, and ate dry biscuits with water.

The Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian was profound and extensive. Martial arts that are called "Scripture", "Skill", or "Formula" often go beyond the frameworks of "fists and feet" or "swords and knives", covering a wide range and having strange uses.

Li Xian had dabbled in fists, legs, swords, knives, and fingers... He had already stepped out of the threshold of martial arts. At this moment, studying the "Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian" in detail, he initially found it obscure and complex, with profound principles. But the essence of its main points was enough for him to contemplate and understand on his own.

He had a thirst for learning and a broad mind. When he was with Wen Caishang, he often explored the sea of knowledge. Wen Caishang was reluctant to hide anything, telling him everything she knew, explaining the origins and allusions in detail. Li Xian gradually became somewhat familiar with the teachings of Taoism, Buddhism... He pondered for a moment and vaguely sensed that the Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian was related to Taoism and Buddhism.

It was profound and extensive, and he benefited greatly.

It was divided into upper and lower volumes.

Starting a few days ago, Li Xian used his spare time to study it, always lingering on the upper volume. It was concise but required careful contemplation to understand its deep meaning.

The upper volume mostly recorded the principles of conduct.

For example, on the third page of the upper volume, the scripture records:

"Zhao Zheng was the ancestor of the Pure Yang Sect, a gentleman and elegant scholar of high integrity. One day, he visited a former friend. Because his friend was sleeping deeply with loud snores, he did not disturb him. He waited outside the door for three days before he could meet his friend. After exchanging a few words, he left again."

Li Xian reflected: "This Zhao Zheng has a very good temper and a broad mind. The scripture records this matter, surely to teach later generations to have a calm heart and treat others with sincerity."

Although his understanding was shallow, he was serious, deliberating every word and sentence carefully, and gradually memorized them. When he read the lower volume, he suddenly realized: The principles in the upper volume seem useless, merely teaching people how to behave. In reality, they involve something very deep and have another mystery!

The lower volume is the "Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Internal Training Method", also known as the "Five Organs Transport Turbid" method. It can be divided into five layers:

Strengthening the Five Organs, Strengthening Bones and Blood, Initiating Transformation, Generating Five Colors of Glow, Stepping on the Lotus.

When practiced to a profound level, the five organs are like jade, and the whole body is flawless. Li Xian read the scripture several times, understanding the general idea. Today, he would try to "transport the turbid of the organs" to refine this extraordinary skill.

The five organs harbor the five turbidities.

Ordinary people eat the grains of heaven and earth, and the delicacies of mountains and seas... all of which will harbor turbidity and dirt. Martial artists cleanse their innate purity, clearing the innate turbidity, but the whole world is turbid; how can one remain pure alone?

They will inevitably be gradually stained by turbidity.

And the five organs are the places where turbidity accumulates.

The method of the Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian uses the "wonder of the five elements" and aligns with "the nature of heaven and earth" to transport the turbid qi of the five organs. Moving turbidity strengthens the organs, extends life, generates and nourishes essence, consolidates the foundation, and enriches the blood and strengthens the soul.

Li Xian knew the severity of this.

Hands, feet, knives, and swords are easy to train, but the internal organs are difficult. A person's internal organs are hidden within the flesh and blood, hard to perceive and control... naturally, there is no way to train them.

The "Iron Copper Body" trains the body while affecting the lungs. Having refined his iron lungs, Li Xian already felt he had benefited greatly.

But the lungs connect to the nose. Breathing methods and body-pounding techniques can somewhat train the lungs. But the "heart", "liver", "spleen", "kidneys"... these organs are extremely difficult to train.

Li Xian closed his eyes.

The method of training the organs requires forgetting the "internal qi". One must not use qi to intervene, but purely use the physical body to perceive the organs, like an invisible hand holding them.

Gradually exert control. Through organ vibration, flesh and blood movement, blood qi driving, and soul guidance... to train the organs. Leading out the turbid qi from the organs, but unable to release it externally.

The human body is like heaven and earth.

If clear and turbid are imbalanced, blood qi will rush straight to the top of the head, causing bleeding from all seven orifices. Mild cases lead to idiocy, severe cases lead to death. Therefore, this is called the "Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian", not the "Five Organs Eliminate Turbid Yang Meridian".

The heavens and earth are vast, and martial arts are vast. A martial arts form, a true scripture... often encompasses a certain understanding of martial arts. Sometimes, two martial arts understandings and theories are completely contradictory.

This is perfectly normal.

Ordinary martial artists, when encountering such a situation, will be cautious and dare not practice recklessly. Martial artists whose martial arts understanding has already formed a system and who have mature views on their own martial arts will find ways to take the essence of both.

The "Perfect Physique" has no such worries.

The Perfect Physique is like a exquisite vessel, with no flaws in the body, and its plasticity far exceeds others. Even if the two contradictory martial arts practiced cause a decrease in strength, as long as one immediately stops reckless practice and finds a way to remedy it, it can be restored to its original state.

It is not afraid of leaving lifelong弊端 (ailments).

Moving the heart turbidity to the kidneys.

The kidney gate is tightly closed, refusing to open.

Li Xian waited calmly, and the kidney gate opened. The heart turbidity and kidney turbidity blended for a moment, and then the heart turbidity moved away again. It subtly echoed the allusion of "Zhao Zheng visiting his friend".

This method of moving the five turbidities secretly follows the principles of the upper volume. After practicing once, Li Xian felt his whole spirit was refreshed, his body was warm, and he felt an indescribable sense of comfort.

[You transported organ turbidity, proficiency +1]
[Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian · Layer 1]
[Proficiency: 1/800 to入门 (Beginner)]

Li Xian maintained a calm heart and practiced diligently internally. The side effect of "Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword", "Declining Blood", could actually be resolved.

Li Xian mastered the trait "Heart Fire".

His heart felt like burning firewood, warming his blood and body, making him unafraid of damp heat or cold. But it also dried his blood and body, requiring constant interaction with the Yin Sword to be watered by Yin dew.

"The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" was extremely powerful. The combined swords were unmatched in strength. But success came from the paired swords, and failure also came from them.

The sword manual set up many obstacles, making it difficult for the Yin and Yang sword masters to part in their lifetimes. If the Yin Sword lost the Yang Sword, Yin would accumulate in the kidneys, causing endless sorrow and unbearable longing. If the Yang Sword lost the Yin Sword, heart fire would blaze, burning blood and scorching the body.

Li Xian practiced the "Five Organs Transport Turbid" method. When transporting organ turbidity, he naturally dissolved part of the heart fire.

Secondly, it could generate new blood.

[Generating Blood] should be the main effect of the Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian.

Li Xian thought: "I originally needed to put in a lot of effort to resolve the crisis of declining blood. The method of avoiding turbidity in the five organs is like sending charcoal in the snow; it couldn't be better."

"But... this method extends life, cultivates the body and mind, strengthens the organs and benefits the blood, but ultimately does not increase my internal qi or strengthen my martial arts. If there is a chance, I need to find new martial arts to practice well. Now that I have left Yihe Manor, alone, it's not easy to find martial arts!"

Li Xian didn't know that the Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian was the general outline of the "Pure Yang Sect" martial arts. The upper volume discusses principles and essentials, and the lower volume discusses internal training of the five organs. Although it has no fist and sword forms, the principles and essentials it contains are the foundation of the Pure Yang Sect's martial arts.

However, after years of transformation.

The Pure Yang Sect underwent several reforms, and this "Five Organs Avoid Turbid Yang Meridian" was no longer pure. Although what Li Xian practiced was pure, it could only serve as an auxiliary.

Avoiding turbidity in the five organs, generating blood and strengthening the body.

Li Xian had gained a lot since the Dragon Banquet, but there were too many storms and dangers, and he had no time to sort them out carefully.

In the blink of an eye, it was almost dusk.

The men who had been cooling off and bathing in the lake had all left. Li Xian had been sitting cross-legged for a long time and turned his body. His bones made a "cracking" sound.

He rearranged his belongings, eating dry biscuits while thinking.

Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, Green Silk Palm, Great Luo Knife, Wonderful Cloud Hand, Iron Copper Body, Gang Thunder Finger, Vast Leg, Seven Star Steps, Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword...

Except for "Seven Star Steps", all had reached their peak.

Recently, he had also gained the traits "Finger Sword" and "Playing Yang Immortal Sound". Li Xian had been indulging in tenderness and hadn't tried to use these traits yet.

Li Xian tried to play the immortal sound. Starting from the Jiaji acupoint, the sound was grand and surging. The surrounding heat waves rolled, actually scorching the weeds until they were dry.

Li Xian's body was like hot iron. The wonderful use of "Playing Yang Immortal Sound" made his body scorching hot.

"When fighting an enemy, if they hit me. At that time... if I can use the force of the enemy's blow to my body to vibrate my bones and play the immortal sound, my body will instantly become as hot as iron. In this way..."

"The enemy's palm will be burned and instantly injured!"

Li Xian's eyes were bright, thinking of various ingenious uses. He imagined the enemy in front of him again,施展 (displaying) strange and tricky moves, and how he would respond and resolve them...

He felt that the wonders of martial arts were endless.

The setting sun was about to disappear, and the sky was darkening.

Transporting turbidity in the five organs, generating blood and strengthening the body. When transporting stomach turbidity, the stomach churned frequently, causing more hunger. Li Xian had already eaten three pieces of coarse biscuits but couldn't suppress his hunger. He had to eat some meat to satisfy his hunger.

He went to hunt some wild rabbits, birds, and snakes.

The grass was green, and the bushes were dense.

Li Xian picked up a branch and beat the bushes. The venomous snake, startled, fled. Li Xian pinched a stone and used the "Riding Cloud Hand" to throw it. The stone was infused with refined internal qi, hitting the snake's three-inch spot with pinpoint accuracy.

The snake twisted and struggled, then died. Li Xian picked up the venomous snake and put it in a cloth bag. He repeated the trick, specifically heading towards damp, hot, and bushy areas.

In no time, he had caught three venomous snakes.

Li Xian weighed them; there wasn't even three ounces of meat. He was extremely hungry and figured he could eat five pounds of tiger meat. A few venomous snakes were barely enough to fill the gaps between his teeth.

He continued searching. After spending a quarter of an hour, he successively hunted four wild rabbits and seven birds. Li Xian was very good at hunting. He could have hunted wild boars, deer, tigers, etc., but dealing with them was troublesome and容易留下行踪 (easily left traces), so he didn't try.

He returned with a full load.

Li Xian lit a bonfire. He cut wood for firewood and cut bamboo to make a pot.

He simply processed the snakes, rabbits, and birds, removing the snake skin, rabbit entrails, and bird feathers. His movements were skilled. By now, the water was boiling.

He put two snakes, one rabbit, and one bird into the bamboo pot to boil. He sprinkled fragrant seasonings and some wild herbs.

There was a jujube grove and a peach grove nearby.

Li Xian used local resources, picked some peaches and jujubes, washed them clean, and threw them into the bamboo pot. In no time, a fresh and sweet fragrance filled the air.

The wild delicacies were ready. Li Xian took a small sip. The soup was fresh, sweet, and refreshing, with a hint of earthy smell. It was very appetizing.

[You consumed a wild delicacy, the proficiency of the skill Eating increased by 1]
[Skill: Culinary Arts]
[Proficiency: 1966/3000 to Small Accomplishment]

Li Xian fully displayed his culinary skills: roasting, stewing, and earth cooking. He roasted the wild rabbit until it was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, glistening with oil.

He ate voraciously, and after a few pieces of fragrant meat entered his stomach, his long-standing hunger was relieved.

The juice flowed, and the meat was tender and smooth.

Four wild rabbits, five venomous snakes, and seven birds were all eaten. Li Xian ate two more dry biscuits, and the hunger in his stomach finally subsided.

Li Xian sat on a huge rock, a blade of grass in his mouth. He enjoyed the cool breeze and the bright moon.

He let his thoughts wander for a while. He patted his belly, feeling full of energy, and set off again.

The night was cool.

Li Xian walked a few more miles and suddenly smelled a faint scent of blood. He followed the smell and found a person hanging upside down on a tree branch.

The person wore coarse linen clothes and tattered straw sandals. His head was down and feet were up, hanging upside down. A breeze blew, and his body swayed slightly.

He had no breath and was already dead.

Li Xian paused. The attire was familiar. He remembered that during the day at the lake, there were several men swimming to cool off. One of them was this person. He had been full of life, but in the blink of an eye, he had become a dried corpse.

Li Xian stepped on the "Seven Star Steps" and leaped onto the tree branch. He saw that the man's feet were tightly bound with vines to the branch. There were friction bruises on his ankles, obviously from before he died.

"Bandits?"

The situation was chaotic, and in remote mountainous areas, banditry was prone to arise. Bandits were cruel and ruthless. It was normal for them to capture merchants and travelers passing by,挖心掏肝 (digging out their hearts and livers), and drinking their blood and eating their flesh.

This method of hanging upside down to drain blood was indeed a form of torture. Although Li Xian was young, he had seen and heard a lot on his escape journey and had a general understanding of the ways of the world.

"Bandits are fierce and cruel. If I see them, I will naturally kill them on the spot. But bandits are extremely poor. Besides挖心掏肝, they usually don't even leave clothes."

"This person is still wearing clothes, so it's probably not the work of bandits. Hmm... this person was attacked and killed. I am on the same path as him, and I will inevitably be attacked too. Let's see how he died. Even if I encounter a strong opponent, I can take precautions."

Li Xian cut the vines. He laid the body flat on the ground, and suddenly heard several "cracking" sounds. The corpse split apart.

Li Xian pondered: "This person seems to have been sucked to death. But even the bone marrow and water... were sucked away. The whole body is like a piece of charcoal. What an evil martial art. If I encounter it... I must be extremely careful!"

Suddenly, he heard footsteps approaching.

Li Xian hid in the grass, held his breath, and observed secretly.

Two people approached quickly and said:

"Ah, Brother Wang... we're late again. After the Black-Faced Bat King committed the murder, he escaped again."

This voice was crisp, belonging to a woman.

"Yes, the Black-Faced Bat King is extremely skilled in lightness technique. It's really not easy to catch him."

"Brother Wang, what should we do now?"

"We can only go back to Xiu City first and discuss it properly."

"This Black-Faced Bat King is really cunning, and his blood-sucking skill is extremely powerful. Look at this corpse, it only has an external injury on the neck, just two small holes. How could it suck away all the blood and bone marrow in a few breaths?"

"The Black-Faced Bat King is not simple. His evil martial arts have gradually formed a school. Look at this corpse, the liver and spleen were shattered by a palm, causing abnormal blood circulation. This is the Black-Faced Bat King's famous skill, called 'Sudden Blood Palm'. His several sets of martial arts are combined and matched. They are extremely powerful."

"But he offended the wrong person. He killed Miss Luo."

"Silly sister... he didn't offend the wrong person, but... he has the Nine-Nine [Yellow Nine Ginseng] on him."

The two whispered to each other.

At the same time.

Wen Caishang drank the secret medicine, and the "Food Qi Gu" lost three legs and one head. Her strength had recovered by half.

She summoned Uncle Xiang to have him manage the manor. She also called back the guards and prepared to move the manor.

"That scoundrel... you won't be able to catch him. In the end, I will have to go personally."

Wen Caishang looked into the distance, a mix of coquettishness and anger in her voice. "You thought I wouldn't预料 (expect) that you planned to run away. It's extremely easy for me to find you. Li Lang... you'll have to explain yourself properly then."

She left the manor overnight, following the silkworm to find the silk.
