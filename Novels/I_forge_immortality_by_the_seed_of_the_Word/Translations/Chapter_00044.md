# Chapter 44: I'm a Good Cultivator, Really!

Huff—huff—

Three rogue cultivators were fleeing for their lives, their figures swift as the wind. Spiritual light flickered beneath their feet as they leaped seven or eight zhang with each bound. The thick white mist rolled forward under their momentum, waves of fog dispersing in all directions.

Feeling his spiritual energy depleting rapidly, the burly man at the rear couldn't help but complain, "Damn it! Everyone says the gap between us rogue cultivators and those academy disciples is terrifying, and today we saw it firsthand. That damned Yin Master's ghost puppets were at least comparable to first or second-layer Qi Refinement cultivators. How could that brat at the initial Qi Refinement stage obliterate them with a single spell? How old is he anyway?"

As he spoke, the burly man suddenly sensed the dangerous presence behind him closing in rapidly. His expression changed, and he instinctively sped up, overtaking the old man in front of him.

"Damn it, we miscalculated," the mole-faced leader said grimly. "I thought the three of us together would be enough."

As he spoke, he recalled the terrifying icy blade energy he'd witnessed earlier and shuddered.

"Boss, what do we do?" the burly man shouted, his voice tinged with panic. "That kid's catching up fast! I don't want to taste his spells—they're deadly!"

"Keep heading east," the mole-faced man said viciously. "We'll lead him as far as we can. Then I'll activate that magic artifact. No matter how strong he is, he's still only at initial Qi Refinement. Even if he survives the Yin Master's strike, he'll be crippled."

With that, the mole-faced man glanced at the burly man who was about to overtake him. He suddenly reached out, clapped him on the shoulder, and subtly pushed him backward while saying meaningfully, "These academy disciples always carry good loot. After I kill that kid with the artifact, don't forget to take his storage pouch. Then we'll go straight down to see the Yin Master."

At that moment—


Whoosh!

The old man lagging behind suddenly stopped. In the next instant, a terrifying blade of icy energy burst from his chest.

The bone-chilling cold washed over them.

"No time—we do it here!" the mole-faced man gasped, frantically pulling out a strange, tiger-tooth-shaped dagger from his storage pouch. He turned to the burly man beside him and ordered, "You distract him while I activate the artifact."

---

"Two left."

Zhang Jing's gaze swept past the old man's corpse on the ground and fixed on a slowly moving blurry figure not far ahead.

Hmm? Where's the other one?

As he pondered, another Frostblade Spell materialized in his hand. With a flick of his wrist, it shot toward the distant figure like a phantom.

Now!

Hidden nearby, the mole-faced man saw Zhang Jing cast his spell and his eyes lit up. He immediately channeled his spiritual energy into the dagger.

Roar!

A faint, bestial growl echoed as an overwhelming aura of bloodlust erupted from the crimson dagger. In an instant, the dagger transformed into a streak of red light, cleaving through the mist as it shot toward Zhang Jing.

Seeing this, the mole-faced man finally relaxed, his tense body easing as calm returned to his expression.

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing had already stopped moving after casting his spell. His senses were on high alert—he'd detected something dangerous.

Pouring his spiritual awareness into the Mind's Eye Seed, the world around him became crystal clear despite the thick fog. Everything within a dozen zhang was reflected perfectly in his mind.

There!

He turned his head slightly, his "gaze" locking onto the mole-faced man hiding behind a wall, his face alight with anticipation.

A thread of lethal intent suddenly appeared in Zhang Jing's perception.

The mist parted as the blood-red dagger hurtled toward him, its aura far surpassing anything an initial Qi Refinement cultivator should possess.

Without hesitation—

Splash!

Seven icy-blue spellfish leaped from the Five Elements Spiritual River, merging instantly with the protective barrier around Zhang Jing. A solid blue radiance burst forth, illuminating the surroundings.

Boom!

The dagger transformed into a vicious black tiger, its maw gaping wide as it clamped down on Zhang Jing's reinforced barrier.

Blood-red ferocity clashed against glacial resilience.

For a moment, the two forces were locked in stalemate.

---

Crack!

With a final snap, the crimson dagger shattered into three pieces, clattering to the ground. Zhang Jing's protective barrier dimmed drastically, flickering on the verge of collapse.

Glancing at the broken artifact, Zhang Jing maintained his weakened barrier and strode toward the mole-faced man. A Star Guidance Talisman quietly appeared in his hand.

Tap... tap...

His footsteps were soft, but to the mole-faced man, they might as well have been the tolling of the underworld's bell.

"So this... is an academy disciple?" the man muttered hoarsely, his eyes hollow. "Monsters... all of them..."

His greatest trump card hadn't even broken through the other's defensive barrier.

Thud!

The mole-faced man dropped to his knees, kowtowing frantically. "Spare me, brother! We were forced into this! You wanted information about the demon in Heishan County, right? I'll tell you everything!"

"Speak."

"The demon hiding here is called the Yin Master. This night fog is his doing, and the ghost puppets in the mist serve him. We were just ordinary rogue cultivators, but we fell into his trap and had no choice but to submit. I—I'm a good cultivator, really! I've been waiting for a chance to kill that old demon, but I lacked the strength. But now that you're here—"

Zhang Jing cut him off coldly. "What's the Yin Master's strength? Where is he hiding?"

"According to him, he's at the peak of the fourth Qi Refinement layer. There's a secret tunnel in the eastern city ruins near the wall that leads to his underground palace. He probably has tunnels in the other districts too, but I don't know where."

The mole-faced man spilled everything he knew in one breath, terrified that any delay would seal his fate.

Finished, he looked up pleadingly. "Brother, considering my honesty and that I'm truly a good cultivator... could you spare me?"

The next moment, Zhang Jing's barrier dissipated completely.

The mole-faced man saw Zhang Jing's faint, mocking smile—then darkness.

Soon after, Zhang Jing was holding two worn storage pouches containing only a few spirit stones and two shoddy magical tools.

"Rogue cultivators really are poor," he muttered in disappointment.

Just then—

"Junior Brother Zhang!"

A deep, urgent voice called out. Turning, Zhang Jing saw Senior Brother Ding hurrying toward him with the others.

Within moments, the group surrounded him.

Senior Sister Tong immediately began inspecting him from head to toe, her face tense. Only after confirming he was unharmed did she relax slightly. "Junior Brother, how could you act alone? Senior Brother Ding warned us repeatedly to be careful! You're new to the academy—inexperienced, without proper safeguards. What if you'd encountered the demon? If something had happened to you, how could I face Senior Brother Yangchu upon our return?"

Before Zhang Jing could respond, Senior Brother Zhou interjected, "Enough, Tong Yao. Junior Brother Zhang was probably just eager to pursue them. He'll be more careful next time. Besides, he cultivates a mid-grade technique—three initial Qi Refinement rogue cultivators couldn't have threatened him."

"But—" Senior Sister Tong started to protest, only for Senior Brother Ding to chuckle and cut in.

"Junior Sister Tong, this is Junior Brother Zhang's first mission. It's understandable that he acted impulsively. Weren't you the same back then? He's at the third Qi Refinement layer like you all—his methods might even surpass yours."

Turning to Zhang Jing, Senior Brother Ding said earnestly, "Let it go this time, Junior Brother Zhang. But if anything happens again, inform me immediately. Acting alone is too risky."

"I understand, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied solemnly.

As soon as he spoke, he noticed the others staring at him in shock.

"Junior Brother... you've really reached the third Qi Refinement layer?" Senior Brother Zhou asked, swallowing hard.

Zhang Jing nodded. "Yes, Senior Brother."

"But—you've been at the academy for less than two months! How did you accumulate enough to break through from the second to third layer so quickly? And the bottleneck—it makes no sense!"

"Hah, that's why Senior Brother Yangchu values him so highly," Senior Brother Ding interjected with a laugh. Then, turning to Zhang Jing, he started, "Junior Brother Zhang, since you dealt with those rogue cultivators, did you discover any—"

Before he could finish, a rustling sound arose from all directions—countless footsteps, dense as rainfall, suddenly surrounded them.

Senior Brother Ding's expression hardened as a green bamboo staff appeared in his hand, its Dao patterns glowing faintly. The others tensed as well, instinctively forming a protective circle around Zhang Jing.
