Chapter 103: The Banquet of the Dragon’s Sight and the Madam’s Secret

There exists a vast chasm between the ranks of martial arts. The Jade Green Palm is a martial art of the Entry Level; even if it is merely the lowest grade of that level, it far surpasses basic martial arts.

"It is said that powerful martial arts have bizarre and varied effects, capable of doing things ordinary people cannot."

"Combined with the transformed bodies of martial artists... when executed, their power is formidable."

Li Xian did not feel sleepy, but he knew he should balance work and rest. He had been rushing back and forth yesterday and had stayed up late forcefully practicing his martial arts.

Though he was strong and robust, full of vitality like a dragon or a tiger, and could endure the strain, being too hasty could actually harm his progress on the Dao of martial arts. It was better to relax for a moment and cook some wild boar meat.

"Let me reward myself; today, I shall eat the wild boar's back!"

Li Xian dug the wild boar out from the snow pile. It had already been skinned and its entrails removed.

He made a light cut on the back. A piece of meat with a perfect balance of lean and fat was now in his hand.

Wild boar meat has a strong, gamey odor.

Especially male wild boars; that musky scent cannot be removed. Only the meat from the back is tough and tendon-rich, with very little of that gamey smell.

Li Xian didn't know about wild boars from other places, but those around Qingning County were mostly like this. Because this type of wild boar has a nickname: the "Back-Arching Pig."

It often uses its back to arch against trees. Under the long-term impact and beating, the meat on its back became delicious, like panning for gold from dung.

"Part of it will be pan-fried, part grilled. No need to make soup."

Even the back meat, if used for soup, would still retain some of the gamey odor.

January 13th. The winter weather turned warm again.

Black River Village seemed to have restored its harmony, with no external enemies harassing them anymore.

[You开合有度 (open and close with measure), Proficiency +3]

Li Xian held the guard's narrow blade, slashing horizontally and chopping vertically. The light of the blade flashed. He struck out more than ten times in a row, the momentum of the blade coherent and swift. When the final strike was swung, a blade light flashed past, plowing a trench in the snow on the ground half a zhang away.

[Great Luo Blade]
[Proficiency: 148/2000 (Minor Completion)]

Li Xian sheathed the blade and fastened it to the left side of his waist. Seeing that the roof was covered in accumulated snow which hadn't been cleaned for days, he immediately struck out a light palm. The wind from the palm scattered the snow.

Time passed quickly in the mountains and wilds.

After temporarily settling the Mountain Wind Stronghold, there were no great troubles in daily life. Perhaps because it was still winter, people were like hibernating bears and beasts, staying in their dens and not coming out.

Invisibly, many troubles were avoided.

Li Xian went up the mountain to hunt a few days ago and caught another bear. He decided to enjoy it properly, so he specifically took the time to go to the Black Market in Blackwater Port to buy a cookbook.

He studied the book to learn how to handle "bear paws."

[Craft: Culinary Arts]
[Proficiency: 152/500 (Entry Level)]
[Description: The people regard food as heaven; food is defined by the kitchen.]

The taste of bear paws was indeed wonderful. After eating them once, he couldn't forget them and would occasionally recall the flavor.

"That is good too."

After practicing martial arts this day.

Li Xian emptied his mind and lay on a tree branch, enjoying the cool breeze.

"During this period, with no trivial matters disturbing me, I have been seriously, bit by bit, refining my martial arts."

"Accumulating strength properly."

"Situations like this are rare indeed. The others in the One Union Manor all say I came here to suffer, but they don't know how relaxed and carefree I am."

Black River Village... was truly a great place to accumulate strength!

Inside the One Union Manor.

It was said that today was a troubled autumn, as there were guests visiting the gate outside the manor.

"Sir, who are you looking for?" A servant sweeping snow near the entrance stepped forward to ask.

The visitor's name was Meng Long. He was middle-aged, with a square face and thin eyebrows, his mouth large enough to swallow a person. His throat was exceptionally thick. He wore a black long robe embroidered with auspicious cloud patterns.

"Who cares? Get lost."

Meng Long casually waved his hand. It slapped the servant across the face with such force that he was sent flying several zhangs away, crashing into a large tree. He died instantly.

"Murder! Murder!"

The other servants screamed in shock.

Pang Long reacted in time, immediately leading a group of guards to rush out of the gate, surrounding the black-clothed man completely.

This is...

Pang Long's legs suddenly went weak. He thought: "Is that the Demonic Throat?"

More than a decade ago, in the Qiong Tian Mansion area, across several counties, a fierce man had appeared. This man had an incredibly loud shout and could emit a strange, demonic sound. His martial world nickname was "Demonic Throat."

Later, he suddenly vanished without a trace.

It was said that he was appreciated by a high expert and went off to learn martial arts.

Meng Long was surrounded but didn't panic at all. He grinned, planted his feet firmly, and his chest swelled up.

"Bad! Cover your ears!" Pang Long shouted in shock.

Meng Long said, "Where is Madam Zhejian?"

The sound shot out, piercing the ears and shaking the spirit. This demonic sound had a special peculiar oscillating force.

Those with weaker constitutions were directly shaken until their bones loosened and flesh scattered,瘫痪 (paralyzed) on the ground. Just from this exchange, many guards and servants were already in a miserable state, unable to put up any defense.

Some fainted, some were paralyzed. Worse yet, some had their eyes rolled back, foaming at the mouth, limbs convulsing, and faces turning blue. Their gall bladders had seemingly been shattered by the shout!

Pang Long covered his ears, circulating his Internal Qi to forcefully resist. Although he didn't faint, he suffered heavy injuries, blood flowing from between his fingers.

The sound continued to spread, as if it would cover the entire manor.

Madam Wen said, "Rude wretch, arrogant." This voice was very soft.

It carried a faint tone of reprimand. Ordinary people heard it and were fine, but Meng Long heard it and his expression changed drastically. He took three steps back. His face instantly turned red. The next second, with a "pfft" sound, two streams of blood shot out from his ears.

"Master!"
"Save me!"

Then came a "bang." Meng Long's eyes burst, turning into bloody sockets. Blood flowed from his nose, and his teeth fell out.

His bones were dislocated, his form unrecognizable. He collapsed to the ground, rolling left and right and wailing. He mumbled the words "Master" and "Save me."

An outsider watches the excitement; an insider watches the doorway.

The simple exchange contained the principles of martial arts, yet they were extremely rich.

Even if Madam Wen was powerful, she couldn't kill an enemy so thoroughly with just a light sentence. Meng Long's current fate was entirely due to his own doing.

Just now, when Meng Long shouted, the sound was booming and extremely powerful. What he executed was the "Demonic Throat Piercing Heart" from the "Demonic Throat Sect."

This martial art aims to use Qi to lead sound, sound to lead vibration, and vibration to injure the enemy.

If this martial art is practiced to perfection, it is terrifyingly powerful; sound can kill people. However, before reaching perfection, there is a fatal flaw: when executing the "Demonic Throat Piercing Heart," the demonic sound strikes the user's own body first.

Therefore, while executing the move, the internal organs must also vibrate at a specific frequency.

This is to dispel the influence of the "Demonic Throat Piercing Heart."

Madam Wen's six words, "Rude wretch, arrogant," secretly infused Internal Qi. It disrupted the vibration of his internal organs.

In this way, the "Demonic Throat Piercing Heart" rebounded on him, and he naturally could not escape disaster.

"His art is not refined; he deserves this calamity."

Just then, a white-haired old man walked over. He leaned on a crutch, limping, yet his speed was extremely fast.

He tapped Meng Long's chest with the crutch and gave a slight shake of his wrist.

This resolved it.

But Meng Long was already废 (crippled). His internal organs were a mess, his eyeballs had burst, and his teeth were all gone.

"Madam Zhejian, your methods are vicious, truly living up to your reputation." The old man shouted toward the manor: "But I never expected that a figure like you would do something like hiding here?"

"Hehe, could it be... that you are afraid of someone? Hiding here to avoid debt?"

Madam Wen's voice came, "Old Man White Staff, you don't need to provoke me with words. Whether you came here for revenge or something else, just say it directly. I don't have the time to chat with you idly."

"Hehe." Old Man White Staff, Cang Qiongsheng, laughed and took a step back. He said, "My useless disciple was ignorant and caused you to misunderstand. Hehe, I am not here for revenge."

"I came first to take a look. To see if you, this Madam Zhejian, still have the same charm as in the past."

"After all... we are on the same side."

Madam Wen said, "You are quite bored. You cultivated this disciple for years just for this move?"

"Hahaha." Old Man White Staff laughed. "My, Old Man White Staff's, disciples are famous for being cheap and dying fast. I enjoy it."

With that, he kicked Meng Long. He clearly didn't care whether he lived or died.

He viewed him only as a pawn for testing.

"Forget it. Considering the Banquet of the Dragon's Sight, take him away. I won't make things difficult for you," Madam Wen added.

"What? The great Madam Zhejian, have you recently turned to Buddhism? You know mercy now?" Old Man White Staff asked in surprise. "If it were your old temperament, you would surely say: 'If you want to leave, fine, leave both arms behind first.' Why are you so agreeable today?"

"Then leave both arms behind," Wen Caitang's voice suddenly turned cold.

"I won't keep you company. See you at the Banquet of the Dragon's Sight." Old Man White Staff left quickly. His figure walked into the distance.

Suddenly, a sound of wind rose.

A leaf,不知从何处 (from who knows where), shot out and killed the barely breathing Meng Long.

Old Man White Staff laughed heartily and disappeared completely.

Pang Long, filled with dread, walked to Meng Long's corpse.

Flying leaves killing people is not difficult.

But what is difficult is... this leaf was a "withered leaf." It turned into dust the moment it was touched.

Inside the Quiet Tower.

Wen Caitang spat, "If it were a different time, I wouldn't just want your hands; I would want your legs too."

She sighed slightly. In the distance, Qiuyue had been震晕 (shocked unconscious).

"This woman is very weak."

February 7th. The ice and snow gradually melted, and the cold wind no longer pierced the bones.

Fresh green buds emerged from the snow, and a scene of vitality was about to revive.

West Village entrance, wooden house.

[Proficiency +1]
[Jade Green Palm]
[Proficiency: 5992/6000 (Minor Completion)]

As Li Xian struck out a palm, more than ten faint gusts of wind intertwined with each other.

[You grasp Condensing Qi into Threads, Twisting Threads into Ropes.]
[Proficiency +13]
[Jade Green Palm proficiency is full, promoted to Great Completion!]
[You practiced diligently and finally brought Jade Green Palm to Great Completion, catching a glimpse of the initial realm of the Dao of martial arts.]

Li Xian's heart was slightly delighted. As wished, it happened naturally.

The initial scene of the Jade Green Palm martial art unfolded before his eyes.

Li Xian's vision blurred.

A winding, twisting great river first entered his eyes. He saw the river water emerald green, the great river surging. On both sides, green mountains stood tall, with faint white mist lingering over the surface.

Looking into the distance, thousands of rivers converged, the river network dense and complex.

Poetic and picturesque, extremely beautiful, and extremely enchanting.

The beauty of the rivers and mountains was all contained within.

"I have never seen such a beautiful scene!"

"The rivers of this world are wider, the green mountains higher, the vegetation thicker. Everything is more vast!"

Li Xian saw the beautiful scenery and a heroic spirit arose.

It felt as if he were置身其中 (placed within it), extremely real.

Just as he was about to savor the meaning of the surging river, the scene suddenly changed, landing on a boat in the river.

The boat was about three stories high, decorated luxuriously, floating quietly on the river course.

Qiuyue was also in the boat, sitting at the bow admiring the scenery.

Li Xian was in the initial scene, moving freely, walking toward the cabin.

He came to the Madam's bedroom and lifted a light gauze curtain.

He saw an unbelievable scene.

"This..."

In his heart, the Madam was mysterious and powerful, dignified and elegant. Today... he saw a completely different scene.

His gaze couldn't help but become teasing.
