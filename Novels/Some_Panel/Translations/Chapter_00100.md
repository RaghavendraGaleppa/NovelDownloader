# Chapter 99: Senior Brother Treats Me Truly as His Junior

On this very day, outside the main hall, Chong Yuan's voice resounded.

“Honored Master, a young man named Li Changxiao, who claims to be your Senior Brother, has arrived at Dao Peak and wishes to see you.”

“Oh? Senior Brother has emerged from seclusion?” Inside the Mountain Sea Pearl, Yang Ji’s eyes lit up upon hearing this. He straightened his robes and stepped out.

“Where is he?” Yang Ji asked with a smile.

“I have already invited him to the reception hall,” Chong Yuan replied.

Yang Ji nodded and immediately headed towards the reception hall.

Upon entering the grand hall, he saw a handsome young man with an extraordinary aura, serene and unrestrained, meticulously savoring spiritual tea.

“Senior Brother.” Seeing this person, a smile blossomed on Yang Ji’s face.

“Junior Brother, congratulations on passing the first assessment and successfully joining the Dao Sect. I’ve been in seclusion all these years and didn’t even know you had arrived here, failing to greet you. It truly shows my lapse in responsibility as a Senior Brother.”

Li Changxiao happily stepped forward to greet him, a hint of remorse flashing across his face.

“Senior Brother, cultivation is naturally a crucial matter. Are you perhaps afraid that I, your Junior Brother, would get lost at the Dao Sect’s entrance?” Yang Ji laughed, pulling Li Changxiao to sit down again.

The two sworn brothers, reuniting at the Dao Sect, felt a rush of emotions. Despite not seeing each other for so many years, there was no trace of awkwardness between them.

Yang Ji poured spiritual tea for Li Changxiao and said, “Junior Brother only arrived at the Dao Sect a few years ago. I fortunately passed the first assessment and broke through to the Nascent Soul realm several years later, becoming an inner disciple.”

“What good fortune? Junior Brother, this is your skill. There’s no need to be so modest in front of your Senior Brother.”

Li Changxiao paused, then suddenly smiled mysteriously, “Oh, right, Junior Brother, in a few more years, you’ll be undertaking your second assessment. Senior Brother has brought you something good that will guarantee to increase your chances of passing the assessment by several tenths.”

“Oh? What good thing?” Yang Ji asked curiously.

“The latter four forms of the Returning Collection Sword Art, and a great Divine Ability of the Soul type, ‘Yin-Yang Divination.’” Li Changxiao smiled faintly, and with a flick of his hand, he produced two jade slips and placed them on the table.

“The first jade slip contains the latter four forms of the Returning Collection Sword Art. This is a Divine Ability I received when I passed my second assessment.”

“The second jade slip contains a rare Soul-attacking great Divine Ability. This art is exquisitely profound and immensely powerful. The Yin and Yang energies cultivated through it specialize in severing the Soul, capable of killing people invisibly. It is called ‘Yin-Yang Divination.’” Li Changxiao explained.

“A Soul-attacking Divine Ability? Senior Brother, where did you obtain this?” Yang Ji was slightly surprised. Such Divine Abilities are extremely precious and rare; he hadn’t expected his Senior Brother to possess one.

Hearing Yang Ji’s question, a sense of deep emotion and wistfulness arose in Li Changxiao’s heart, and he said, “I obtained this art unexpectedly while executing my second assessment mission.”

“At that time, I mistakenly entered a Ghost Immortal’s cave dwelling and was attacked by a remnant Ghost Immortal soul. My Divine Soul was severely damaged as a result, split into two portions.”

“My Soul was split into two before even reaching the Soul Transformation stage – truly a Heaven-defying tribulation. It was extremely perilous then, my life hanging by a thread.”

“Yet, I stubbornly endured, relying on my formidable will, and slowly wore down the remnant Ghost Immortal soul. It was truly a narrow escape from death.”

“However, surviving a great calamity often brings great fortune.”

“Inside the cave, I obtained the inheritance of a senior named Xuan Yang. The cultivation method practiced by that Ghost Immortal was also inherited from him, and this ‘Yin-Yang Divination’ is also a Divine Ability he created.”

“Because my Divine Soul was split into two, I coincidentally met the cultivation requirements and condensed Yin and Yang energies, which allowed me to keep my Soul from dissipating.”

“However, I was damaged as a result, requiring me to recuperate for several years. Fortunately, it turned out to be a blessing in disguise, as I successfully cultivated this profound Soul art.” Li Changxiao said, smiling faintly.

Yang Ji’s expression settled slightly. He knew that even the usually composed Li Changxiao had a hint of solemnity in his voice, indicating how perilous the experience must have been. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have described it as a narrow escape from death.

“Senior Brother, this art was obtained through a near-death experience of yours, how can I, your Junior Brother—”

“Junior Brother!” Li Changxiao suddenly interrupted him, saying, “The Azure Wave Sect has tens of thousands of people, but in this vast Boundless Dao Sect, I only have you, my Junior Brother, by my side.”

“There aren’t many people I can trust, nor many who can assist me on the path to immortality. On this long journey to longevity, I still count on you, Junior Brother, to walk it with me.”

“If Junior Brother is unwilling to accept it, does it mean you are unwilling to walk the Grand Dao alongside your Senior Brother?” Li Changxiao smiled faintly.

“Senior Brother, Junior Brother is naturally willing,” Yang Ji blurted out.

A smile emerged on Li Changxiao’s face as he said, “‘Longevity between heaven and earth, smilingly watching all beings pass!’ The characters ‘Changxiao’ (long laughter) form my name; this was the grand aspiration I vowed in my heart at the beginning of my cultivation journey.”

“My aptitude is ordinary, and while my comprehension is outstanding, it’s not top-tier. Only my will can break through heaven and earth and contend with the world.”

“But having only will isn’t enough. The immortal path isn’t clearly illuminated; it’s filled with numerous dangers and crises.”

“I can see that Junior Brother’s comprehension is even more outstanding than mine. Previously, it was limited by your region, your thinking was somewhat restricted, and your understanding was somewhat one-sided; you were still in a growth stage.”

“However, after undergoing the Dao Sect’s baptism, broadening your horizons, increasing your knowledge, recognizing the myriad worlds, and hearing the methods of various schools, your thoughts will become unhindered, and your comprehension will surely reach the peak you are capable of.”

“I believe this is no worse than someone possessing an ordinary Dao Body.”

“Junior Brother’s strength surpasses my own. On the path to longevity, with your assistance, I, Li Changxiao, will surely be able to go further.”

“This heartfelt intention of your Senior Brother is embedded within this ‘Yin-Yang Divination.’ Now, I slowly offer it to you, Junior Brother, do you wish to accept it?” Li Changxiao smiled slightly.

This revelation touched Yang Ji deeply; his Senior Brother truly treated him like his own younger brother.

On the path of cultivation, resources, companions, techniques, and dwelling are important, but 'techniques' are paramount. Everyone in the world has selfish motives, and Yang Ji was no exception.

Because of Luo Xiong, he maintained a sense of 'vigilance' and 'caution' towards everyone.

Which was why he hadn’t revealed his humanoid weapon back then.

Now, Li Changxiao led him into a higher spiritual realm, exploring a greater world.

His mind emptied, as if undergoing a transformation and baptism, his thoughts becoming broad and unburdened.

With his Senior Brother treating him this way, how could Yang Ji be someone ungrateful?

“Senior Brother, I also have two Divine Abilities to give you.” Yang Ji smiled faintly, taking out jade slips engraved with the humanoid weapon and the Three Immortals Array.

These two jade slips were ones he had crafted within the Mountain Sea Pearl over the years. These Divine Abilities were unlike the Buddha-Demon Sutra of the Buddha Child, which specified practitioners.

As long as they were imprinted onto cultivation technique jade slips, they could be passed on to others.

He had prepared these early, originally intending to give them to Li Changxiao. Now, as he presented them, the two sworn brothers exchanged smiles, the meaning becoming even more profound.

Seeing Yang Ji smilingly accept the Returning Collection Sword Art and 'Yin-Yang Divination,' Li Changxiao did not ask what Divine Abilities were contained within the two jade slips; he simply flicked his hand and put them away.
