# Chapter 88: The Future Positioning of a New Life Cultivator

“You cannot go!” Meng Xinghai immediately objected. In his eyes, Qin Ming was still in the nascent stage of his potential and needed to grow. Should anything happen, the regret would be immeasurable.

“Uncle Meng, I really must return to Black-White Mountain. I have a premonition that after Golden Rooster Ridge was wiped out, the Golden Bandits might have marked that area down for retribution. If something happens there, my conscience won’t be at ease,” Qin Ming stated with great solemnity.

His solo infiltration of Golden Rooster Ridge at night, wiping out all the bandits, was originally well-intentioned. But if it were to bring great disaster to the local mountain folk, he would feel incredibly guilty.

Meng Xinghai caressed the bronze cauldron in the living room and said, “I will consider arranging personnel over there. At your age, if you were a direct descendant of one of the great families going out for training, you would still be in the protection phase.”

Their opinions diverged.

Having walked this path, Qin Ming had already experienced many bloody battles, and recently even captured one of the Golden Bandits. He did not want to stand idly by.

“There are higher-level experts among the Golden Bandits. Although their movements have been discovered, it’s better to be safe than sorry. I’ve only just found such a promising young talent as you, and I don’t want anything to happen to you,” Meng Xinghai said very earnestly.

He added new calming incense to the purple copper censer and said, “To be honest, though I still wield a blade and continue to improve my Heavenly Radiance, I have long since ceased to be someone on this path. I see certain qualities in you that remind me of my younger self, so I want to see if, with your anomalous talents that surpass those of other youths, you can go further on this New Life path.”

Qin Ming was surprised. Old Meng was stronger than he had imagined, having walked more than one path.

He asked, “Will our path truly become so difficult later on?”

Meng Xinghai nodded and said, “Yes, I originally wanted to walk this path, but now, wielding a blade and improving Heavenly Radiance is merely inertia born of an obsession, and also a way to conceal my true strength. It’s not just me; Old Cui Qi is the same. His venture to the Outlands wasn’t to enhance Heavenly Radiance or purify his ‘Spiritual Aura Field,’ but to completely lay bare his path and solidify his cultivation on another one.”

Qin Ming frowned. Even Meng Xinghai and Cui Hao had long given up and were no longer on this path, suggesting that its future was unpredictable and rather ethereal.

Meng Xinghai sighed, “Among our generation, those who shone brightly on this path in their early years are now either silent, or they merely used the New Life path as a cover in their early days, actually cultivating another path. Looking closely, there isn’t a single pillar of strength among us now.”

Qin Ming asked, “If one persists, leaving aside the Secret Sect, how significant would the gap be when compared to peers from the Outlands?”

“The disciples of the Outlands, at their initial stages, always have gold-armored guards by their side. Later, if these guards can’t keep up, they are quickly replaced by jade-armored guards, all of whom are selected from our path. Do you understand this positioning?” Meng Xinghai calmly informed him.

Qin Ming nodded, pondering for a long time.

After embarking on the New Life path, his progress had been remarkably swift, especially his ability to quickly grasp the essence of various secret texts. He had originally thought himself quite extraordinary.

Now, with a preliminary glimpse of the path ahead, he realized there were very few companions, and he would face pressure akin to mountains from other resplendent cultivation systems. He absolutely could not afford to be complacent or slacken.

“My arduous cultivation is not so that I can enter the Secret Sect or become someone else’s follower in the Outlands!” Qin Ming declared inwardly.

Immediately, he asked, “Uncle Meng, has that exceptionally rare spiritual substance you helped me concoct arrived? If I consume it, I’m sure I’ll be fine going to Black-White Mountain.”

Meng Xinghai sat down and took a sip of tea. “Don’t rush. It will be delivered along with that extraordinary cultivation art.”

Qin Ming chuckled, “How about you just send me the spiritual substance that allows for six rebirths of the body? As for the fifth rebirth, I’ll handle it myself.”

“Calm your mind. I’ll give you some calming incense. No matter which path you take, you must not be impetuous. Your heart must remain peaceful, even if a spiritual mountain collapses before your eyes, you must not change your expression.”

The next day, Meng Xinghai himself became anxious, unable to maintain his composure, because a bloody incident perpetrated by the Golden Bandits erupted in the neighboring Maple Leaf City.

The Golden Bandits were not a small organization; they were not confined to a single city or place, their presence was felt across several nearby cities.

This time, Meng Xinghai contacted many people, including the City Lord of Maple Leaf City, preparing to launch a joint operation to thoroughly uproot the Golden Bandits.

However, a leak occurred in Maple Leaf City, forcing them to act prematurely. While they did manage to eliminate some notorious Golden Bandits, they were met with ferocious retaliation.

“They don’t have the guts or strength to slaughter a city. But they burned down two towns and unleashed beasts to commit atrocities, killing many people,” Qin Ming learned as he listened in at the City Lord’s mansion, understanding part of the situation.

Currently, the personnel dispatched by Meng Xinghai, and the experts invited, had not all arrived.

Qin Ming learned that the former City Lord Ling Xu would also come to assist, and that the tabby cat bearing the Scarlet Cloud Sword had also been invited once again, but more time was needed.

“Some Golden Bandits fled, forcing their way out, and they might pass through our area. I don’t know if this will cause a terrible impact. Maple Leaf City truly can’t be relied upon; their mid-level members were actually infiltrated by the Golden Bandits!”

Qin Ming strongly requested to go to Black-White Mountain.

This time, Meng Xinghai agreed. He had received a secret report that the high-ranking Golden Bandits would not take the Black-White Mountain route, having already appeared elsewhere.

Time was pressing, allowing for no hesitation. Meng Xinghai quickly issued orders to the various great families in Scarlet Cloud City from the City Lord’s mansion, demanding that experts be dispatched to take charge of various regions.

“Be careful!” Meng Xinghai cautioned, arranging a human-carrying raptor for Qin Ming.

This was a Scarlet Eagle, blood-red all over, with a wingspan of six meters when fully spread. It had mutated twice and could carry people for long distances, but it wasn't considered a true flying mount.

Generally, experts would not easily ride such a raptor, because they only considered extraordinary avian mounts of similar strength to themselves as true flying mounts. Otherwise, if attacked in mid-air, the consequences could be dire.

Qin Ming prepared thoroughly, imitating Ge Qianxun of the Xin Yi Hall, donning a black outfit with bat-like wings, and instructed the Scarlet Eagle to fly at a low altitude as much as possible.

The straight-line distance between Scarlet Cloud City and Black-White Mountain was actually less than three hundred li. The reason it took several days to travel by ground was due to constantly having to detour around territories occupied by many powerful creatures.

Night mist pervaded, and mountain shadows stretched across the land. The fire springs in various places resembled scattered fireflies. Qin Ming stood on the Scarlet Eagle’s back, looking down.

In some areas, one had to fly through the night mist at high altitude; otherwise, some high-grade anomalous beings in the deep mountains would perceive it as an intrusion.

Even when riding a human-carrying raptor, one still had to bypass certain dangerous areas, such as deserts as black as abysses, and the central region of Black-White Mountain.

Not long after, Qin Ming arrived. This was why many experts yearned for flying mounts comparable to their own strength.

The Night Mist World was vast and boundless, and many dangerous regions required detours. Without extraordinary avian mounts to traverse the night sky, travel was incredibly inconvenient.

Qin Ming had the Scarlet Eagle land on a higher slope outside Twin Trees Village. He did not enter the village, merely watched quietly from the dim night.

By now, his life could no longer be as peaceful as before. He feared getting too deeply entangled here, lest his future adversaries turn their attention to this place.

“Brother Lu, Wen Rui, Old Liu…” Qin Ming sighed softly in the breeze, only watching from afar.

Ultimately, he only disturbed the Loquacious Sparrow, which had long since mutated and was exceptionally cunning, drawing it over.

“My Mountain God! Master Qin, why have you suddenly returned?” This Loquacious Sparrow was considerably larger than its peers and had once infuriated Cao Long so much that he wanted to roast it alive.

“Enough of your glib tongue! Can those two words, ‘Mountain Master,’ be casually spoken? What if the true powerful entity hears you, do you want it to send me away?”

“This is my expression of respect for you! In my heart, you are already on par with it!” The Loquacious Sparrow flattered him.

It had kept its promise. Even though its mate had been released from its cage early and regained freedom, it hadn’t flown far, even building a nest in Lu Ze’s home.

Qin Ming said, “Don’t tell anyone else I’m back. Gather your little brothers and help me do something.”

“Speak your command!” The Loquacious Sparrow brightened, even using honorifics, mainly because the purple-eyed crow, Master Wu, had once instructed it to keep a close eye on Qin Ming in the mountains and give him early warnings. It had been negligent before, so now it naturally wanted to actively make amends.

Qin Ming whispered, “Send one of your little brothers to each nearby town. Monitor closely. Once there’s any news of the Golden Bandits, notify me immediately. If a bloody chaos erupts, not even a single breath can be delayed.”

“Got it!” The Loquacious Sparrow vanished in an instant.

In just half a day, Qin Ming heard news about the Golden Bandits. Scarlet Cloud City was issuing warnings to various places via raptors, and the news had spread throughout Black-White Mountain.

Two high-ranking figures among the Golden Bandits intended to break out, and a loyal group of their subordinates were creating opportunities for them by deliberately stirring up trouble, killing, burning, and causing chaos in various locations to attract attention and tie down some experts.

“Several villages and towns in Maple Leaf City are in severe condition, many people have died, and even some areas within Scarlet Cloud City’s jurisdiction have seen bloodshed,” the Loquacious Sparrow quickly informed him.

Currently, Green Pine Town, Silver Vine Town, and Emei Town were gripped by fear, worried that some Golden Bandits would target this remote region.

“Once you have the latest news, tell me at Golden Rooster Ridge!” Qin Ming said, standing on the Scarlet Eagle’s back, traversing the night sky toward that old place fifty li away.

He had a premonition that if a certain Golden Bandit harbored any sentiment for Golden Rooster Ridge, they might return there.

During his last intervention, Qin Ming already knew that the five-times mutated Old Golden Rooster was a seasoned fighter, personally trained by a Golden Bandit.

In the past, several Golden Bandits had resided at Golden Rooster Ridge for a long time.

The Black-White Mountain region had a generally high elevation. While other places had already entered early spring, there were still remnants of snow on the high mountains here, not yet completely melted.

Under the night sky, Qin Ming revisited the familiar place, standing on Golden Rooster Ridge and gazing at the surrounding mountains.

“Go hide in the back mountain.”

Though the Scarlet Eagle had only mutated twice, it was quite intelligent. Upon hearing this, it immediately flew away from this elevated area dotted with ruined wooden huts.

Scarlet Cloud City shone like day, but Black-White Mountain, lacking bright fire springs, was generally much dimmer. However, Qin Ming felt no discomfort; after all, he had lived here for two years and felt a sense of closeness.

As night deepened, the Loquacious Sparrow arrived and told him that the Golden Bandits, in their frenzy to cover for their leaders, had indeed started appearing in Black-White Mountain.

“Fortunately, an expert dispatched by Scarlet Cloud City is stationed in the town eighty li away and successfully killed a Golden Bandit.”

Qin Ming nodded upon hearing this; it was indeed good news.

There was a fire spring at Golden Rooster Ridge. Qin Ming stayed away from it, finding a dilapidated wooden hut to settle in.

The next day, as shallow night arrived, the mountains remained very dim, with only the central fire spring of Golden Rooster Ridge emitting a fiery glow in all directions.

A slender old man ascended the mountain, stepping through the snow to reach the high ground. He was very old but well-preserved; although his hair was completely white, he had few wrinkles and was not at all fierce, resembling an old scholar.

“I once recuperated here for five years. I never thought that upon returning, it would be a desolate ruin. Who did this?”

Indeed, a Golden Bandit had come here to pay his respects, and he intended to cause trouble in the nearby region.

“The Golden Bandits were once renowned, terrorizing this vast land for decades. Now that we’ve faced adversity, do many people think we are weak and easily bullied? I will go and bloodbath a place to help the leader escape,” the old man said calmly. After commemorating Golden Rooster Ridge, he turned to leave.

“A bunch of vicious and depraved individuals, whom you describe as so extraordinary and tragic, are in fact utterly infamous!” Qin Ming walked out from a distance.
