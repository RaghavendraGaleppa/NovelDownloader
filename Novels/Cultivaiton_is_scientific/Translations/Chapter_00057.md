# Chapter 57: Inquiring the Dao

In the imperial study of the palace, Emperor Jin Geng was reviewing the examination papers from the palace examination. The triennial imperial examination was a crucial talent selection process for the Great Xia Dynasty, bearing on the nation's foundation, and thus he regarded it with utmost importance.

After today's palace examination concluded, he had been grading the candidates' papers in his study. 

"Excellent essay!" he couldn't help but praise as he read one particular paper. The writing quoted extensively from classics, was brilliantly composed with every word like a pearl—it was undoubtedly the finest among all the papers he had reviewed.

Emperor Jin Geng flipped to the name section and saw "Li Shiming" written there. His expression stiffened slightly—this name had appeared frequently in recent intelligence reports. Most importantly, Li Shiming had been in close contact with the imperial advisor Gu Jia, who had visited Li Shiming's residence multiple times. Li Shiming had also attended several gatherings of cultivators.

From this, Emperor Jin Geng concluded that Li Shiming was also a cultivator. Based on his understanding of Gu Jia, even he, the emperor, couldn't command much respect from the advisor, let alone maintain a close relationship with him.

"What a pity—such talent cannot be employed!" Emperor Jin Geng shook his head. He had initially intended to name Li Shiming as the top scholar (zhuangyuan), but knowing that Li Shiming would never serve as an official, he couldn't appoint such a person to that position. 

In fact, the more he admired Li Shiming's essay, the more he resented that this talent couldn't be his to command. He was tempted to place Li Shiming among the lowest-ranked graduates (tong jinshi), but he had to consider Gu Jia's reaction. Even setting Gu Jia aside, he didn't want to offend a cultivator like Li Shiming over this matter.

"Then let's make him the third-ranked tanhua," Emperor Jin Geng decided, picking up the imperial brush to finalize the results.

The next day, when the successful candidates entered the palace hall to express gratitude to the emperor, a eunuch announced the results. When Li Shiming's name was called as the tanhua, officials and fellow candidates realized that the man who should have been present was conspicuously absent. Even the eunuch announcing the results couldn't help but glance at Emperor Jin Geng, expecting to see anger on the emperor's face.

To everyone's surprise, Emperor Jin Geng showed no sign of displeasure. "Since Li Shiming isn't here, let's continue," he said with a wave of his hand. 

He understood that this examination was merely a worldly game for cultivators. He also knew that Li Shiming was currently visiting Gu Jia. In truth, Li Shiming hadn't intentionally skipped the ceremony—he had been summoned by Gu Jia immediately after entering the palace.

In Gu Jia's courtyard within the palace, the advisor smiled at Li Shiming. "Young friend Li, you don't actually intend to stay in Great Xia and become an official, do you?"

"Of course not," Li Shiming shook his head in reply. "But I've studied hard for ten years—this is just a way to bring closure to that chapter."

"You're a cultivator, soon to be a disciple of Tianhai Sect. Were you planning to kneel before the emperor in that hall?" Gu Jia tapped his finger lightly as he spoke.

Li Shiming hadn't expected Gu Jia to be more concerned about a cultivator's status than himself. While he disliked the idea of kneeling, he would have endured it to fulfill his mortal world obligations. But now it was too late—the palace examination was over, and he had at least earned the jinshi degree, fulfilling both the original owner's lingering wish and his duty to his father, Li Wenyuan.

"Would you like to hear how you performed?" Gu Jia asked with a smile. As he spoke, he traced a spiritual rune in the air, and a three-dimensional image of the palace hall appeared before them, complete with real-time audio.

Li Shiming's eyes widened in amazement at the virtual projection—a technology that even in his previous life's advanced scientific era remained prohibitively expensive and imperfectly realized.

"The entire palace is within the sect's array formation. I can observe any part of it at will," Gu Jia explained, amused by his reaction.

Li Shiming wanted to ask whether the emperor knew about this surveillance. Would the emperor still choose to live in the palace if he knew Gu Jia could monitor his every move?

"Ah, not bad—you've earned the tanhua title!" Gu Jia chuckled as they heard the eunuch announce the results.

Seeing how the emperor commanded no respect before cultivators stripped away any sense of achievement Li Shiming might have felt about his ranking. Gu Jia observed Li Shiming's expression with satisfaction—this had been his intention all along, to sever the young man's attachment to worldly affairs.

Cultivators walked a lonely path, requiring distance from mortal bustle and noise. Only those who could endure solitude could pursue higher realms of cultivation.

As the two cultivators sat watching the events in the palace hall, Li Shiming felt the growing divide between himself and the mortal world. Yet this didn't diminish his determination to pursue the Dao. Having been reborn, he cherished life all the more—he wanted to live longer, explore every corner of the world, and comprehend its fundamental truths.

"Brother Gu, can cultivation lead to immortality?" Li Shiming asked in this contemplative atmosphere.

"Guess how old I am," Gu Jia countered with a smile.

Li Shiming studied Gu Jia carefully. The man appeared to be in his forties or fifties. Accounting for possible youthful appearance due to cultivation, he ventured, "Are you seventy years old?"—already adding years to his estimate.

Gu Jia laughed heartily before replying with a trace of melancholy, "I'm one hundred and twenty-three years old. After over a century of arduous cultivation, I'm still waiting to die in this mortal world."

Li Shiming stared in astonishment. Among mortals, living past 110 was considered an extraordinary blessing, let alone 120. Yet Gu Jia showed no signs of such advanced age—he looked like he could easily live several more decades.

"A Qi Refining cultivator's lifespan can approach two hundred years," Gu Jia explained. "Though due to various physical factors, reaching one hundred fifty is already good."

"Then higher realm cultivators must live even longer?" Li Shiming pressed.

"Foundation Establishment cultivators live at least two hundred years. Beyond that isn't within my knowledge, but undoubtedly, greater cultivation means longer life," Gu Jia affirmed.

At this moment, Li Shiming's resolve to cultivate solidified into unshakable certainty. With his computer room space, the IBM z15 supercomputer, and countless research achievements from his past life, he was confident he could advance far along the immortal path—far enough to achieve longevity beyond mortal measure.
