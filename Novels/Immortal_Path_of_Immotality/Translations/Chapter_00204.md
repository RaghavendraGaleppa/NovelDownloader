# Chapter 202: Divine Retribution Descends

As the phantom image of a golden thunder pool appeared in the distant ninth heaven, the Golden Core cultivator of the Dai Family and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord froze in place. The scene felt eerily familiar—hadn't something similar occurred in Moonview City about a month ago?

Was someone undergoing tribulation to break through to the Nascent Soul stage?

Had that person deliberately chosen to leave Moonview City and seek out this remote wilderness to undergo their tribulation today?

No wonder—this Forbidden Land of Absolute Yin was indeed an ideal place for tribulation. The natural barriers here could mask the disturbances, and with no living beings around, the heavenly tribulation wouldn't harm innocents.

Had they stumbled upon this at just the right time?

But if someone else was undergoing tribulation, didn't that mean the Li Family's ancestor from Moonview City had died in vain?

While the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord were glancing around suspiciously, wary of any third party that might interfere with their plans, Lin Shan stood to the side, his spirit soaring as he admired his own "masterpiece" for the first time.

Under the activation of the cyan-blue divine ability seed deep within his soul, as the phantom thunder pool appeared in the sky, towering tornadoes began to swirl, connecting heaven and earth.

"Whoosh—whoosh—boom—"

Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled across the darkened sky as dense storm clouds gathered. The massive tornadoes swept across the land like gray funnels, sucking in everything—dust, rubble, and even the surrounding yin energy—into their powerful vortices.

The gale carried storms of sand mixed with gray-black yin energy, shrouding the sky in a murky yellow curtain. The sun had long vanished, leaving only an eerie howl in the pitch-black darkness.

"CRACK—!"

A massive bolt of lightning split the sky, illuminating the darkness for a fleeting moment. The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator, trapped within the Five Ghosts Yin Formation, suddenly realized with horror that all these tornadoes and the heavenly tribulation...

All of it...

Seemed to be...

Aimed directly at him!

The sensation of being isolated by the heavens and locked onto by the thunder pool made him feel as if he had become an enemy of the entire world.

"???"

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was utterly bewildered. If someone else was undergoing tribulation to break through to the Nascent Soul stage, why was the heavenly punishment targeting him instead?

Had the heavenly retribution made a mistake? Why was he the one to bear it?

Unless...

That Nascent Soul expert preparing to undergo tribulation had used some secret technique—like "Shifting Stars," "Grafting Blossoms," or "Substitution"—to transfer the tribulation onto him as a scapegoat?!

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's face turned green with terror.

He was just a rookie who had barely broken through to the Golden Core stage a little over a decade ago—how could he possibly withstand the Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation meant for Nascent Soul cultivators?

But the phantom thunder pool in the ninth heaven paid no heed to his plight. A massive bolt of lightning descended directly into the formation, while the surrounding tornadoes roared and converged.

"WHOOSH—BOOM—CRACK—!"

"AHHH—!"

A blood-curdling scream echoed across the land. Outside the formation, Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord instinctively covered their ears and dropped to the ground, trembling uncontrollably. It wasn't that they were cowardly—it was simply the body's instinctive reaction when low-level cultivators encountered heavenly punishment.

If even they were shuddering in fear outside the formation, one could only imagine the torment the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was enduring inside.

"Tsk tsk... The Dai Family's cultivator is done for. Once locked onto by the thunder pool, there's no escape in this world. And given that he was already severely injured, he's likely become some senior's sacrificial lamb!" the Black Skeleton Demon Lord muttered to itself.

Having experienced the Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation itself during its own breakthrough to the Nascent Soul stage, it knew full well the terrifying power of the ordeal. The memory of being struck by those bolts still haunted it to this day.

However, it never once considered that Lin Shan might be the source of this tribulation.

After all, such heavenly punishment was typically either a natural tribulation or a Nascent Soul-level divine ability. How could this kid possibly be responsible? Besides, activating a divine ability usually required chanting incantations and hand seals, didn't it?

Little did it know that Lin Shan had already condensed a divine ability seed, allowing him to activate his powers at will, without any flashy preliminaries. His spiritual energy was rapidly draining, but this went unnoticed by outsiders.

Meanwhile, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had long retracted its dharma manifestation. The soulfire in its skull flickered weakly—it had nearly sacrificed this avatar earlier, only to be pulled back at the last moment by Lin Shan.

As for how Lin Shan had known the heavenly tribulation was coming, the demon lord attributed it entirely to the capabilities of the innate spiritual treasure, the Void Star Disc. The disc could divine celestial phenomena and determine feng shui—predicting the signs of a heavenly tribulation and issuing a warning would be child's play for such an artifact.

After mentally justifying everything, the skeleton monster found it all perfectly reasonable and couldn't help but covet the spiritual treasure even more.

Amidst the flying sand and rolling stones, the howling winds made it impossible to see what was happening inside the formation. Even Lin Shan's Phantom Spirit Eyes were useless now—he could only faintly hear the screams of the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator and the roars of the four Golden Core ghost generals.

That's right—the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, ever the opportunist, had secretly ordered its ghost generals to attack the drowning man.

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was thus subjected to a triple torment: bathing in the heavenly winds, enduring the Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation, and being relentlessly pummeled by four Golden Core ghost generals. The scene was nothing short of horrific.

After the first bolt of lightning, the second struck almost immediately. The phantom thunder pool in the sky continued gathering energy, and Lin Shan felt his spiritual energy draining like a bursting dam. He hastily stuffed spirit-replenishing pills into his mouth and began absorbing wind spirit stones with both hands.

"CRACK—!"

The surroundings were illuminated once more as the second bolt of heavenly lightning descended. In that brief moment of light, the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator could be seen in tattered robes, his face pale and chin covered in blood, desperately dodging the four ghost generals.

When he saw the second bolt descending, his face twisted in despair, and he roared at the heavens:

"Which senior is doing this to me?!"

No answer came.

Darkness swallowed the Forbidden Land of Absolute Yin once more as the yin energy shrouded everything again. The heavenly winds continued to howl within the formation, mingling with the ghostly wails and human screams, turning the place into a living hell.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, lying outside the formation, chuckled darkly, silently thanking the mysterious senior who had transferred the tribulation onto their enemy, effectively saving them. The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator clearly wouldn't last much longer.

After all, the Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation consisted of twenty-seven bolts—this was just the beginning. There would be plenty of suffering ahead.

But when the demon lord turned its head and saw Lin Shan frantically absorbing spiritual energy from wind spirit stones in both hands—even holding a third one in his mouth—it couldn't help but find the sight bizarre.

"What are you doing?"

"Mmph—mmph—"

Lin Shan had no time to answer. He was desperately absorbing spiritual energy while simultaneously digesting pills in his stomach. He had underestimated the difficulty of wielding a sect-guarding divine ability. Though he possessed the divine ability seed, he had forgotten that such techniques were designed for Nascent Soul experts!

Nascent Soul cultivators could draw upon the power of heaven and earth to summon twenty-seven bolts of heavenly lightning.

But Lin Shan was merely a late-stage Foundation Establishment ant—forget the increasingly terrifying later bolts, even summoning the initial "appetizer" strikes was draining him dry!

"BOOM—CRACK!"

The third bolt descended, briefly illuminating the darkness. The two outside the formation seized the moment to peer inside, only to see the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator now drenched in blood, his flesh torn by the heavenly winds, some wounds so deep that bone was visible. His black umbrella magic treasure was twisted and deformed, nearly melted by the lightning.

The four Golden Core ghost generals weren't faring much better—the heavenly winds were indiscriminate, and their forms were growing increasingly translucent. But as products of the Five Ghosts Yin Formation, they fought on fearlessly, relentlessly attacking their target.

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's face was a mask of despair. He couldn't fathom why he had provoked such wrath—had he unknowingly offended some powerful figure who had specifically transferred the tribulation onto him? Or was this all a trap set by the "Lin Trading Company" duo?

As the third bolt struck, his already severe injuries worsened. His earlier battle with the five ghosts had drained much of his energy, and the backlash from forcibly using his lifebound magic treasure had taken its toll. Now, under the combined assault of heavenly winds, heavenly lightning, and the ghost generals' suicidal attacks, he could only scream in despair:

"NOOO—!"

"BOOM—WHOOSH—!"

Shockwaves rippled outward, barely contained by the crumbling Five Ghosts Yin Formation. Lin Shan knew that the Black Skeleton Demon Lord was completely spent—the formation was now being maintained by the artifact spirit, Little Xin, from beneath the ground.

This was precisely why the Black Skeleton Demon Lord coveted spiritual treasures so much—a high-intelligence artifact spirit could be a lifesaver in critical moments.

After the third bolt, silence fell.

Both inside and outside the formation, darkness reigned. No one could see what had happened or whether the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator had perished.

Only Lin Shan continued his frantic consumption of pills and spirit stones. Summoning the fourth bolt felt like pouring energy into a bottomless pit—his cultivation was simply insufficient, and no matter how much spiritual energy he poured in, it never seemed enough.

"The Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation is the first major trial all cultivators face in their journey," the Black Skeleton Demon Lord mused aloud. "Every three bolts mark a minor threshold, every nine a major one. The first three might not necessarily kill the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator, but the fourth should be more than enough..."

It seemed puzzled as to why the fourth bolt was taking so long.

Meanwhile, Lin Shan was inwardly panicking. He quickly contacted Little Xin to check whether the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was dead.

The answer was clear.

As the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had guessed, Little Xin's short-range soul transmission confirmed that, though the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator was in a pitiable state—his black umbrella magic treasure reduced to a lump of scrap metal—he was still alive!

Outside the formation, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord was completely drained, devoid of any combat strength, while Lin Shan himself was nearly emptied by the sect-guarding divine ability. Neither had any means to deliver a finishing blow—and there was no telling whether the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator still had any fight left in him.

If they failed to kill him today, he would undoubtedly become a future threat.

Lin Shan clenched his teeth. Hesitation meant defeat—now was the time for decisive action.

He made up his mind—it was time to go all out!

Through a soul command, he summoned the Void Star Disc back to his side. The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, still staring blankly at the sky, was taken aback by the sudden return of the spiritual treasure.

"What are you—"

"No time to explain!"

Lin Shan sat cross-legged as the Void Star Disc spun above his head. Arrays of light descended, drawing in spiritual energy from all directions like a tidal wave. Streaks of starlight rained down from the heavens like scattered petals.

With the support of the Spirit Gathering and Star Gathering Arrays, Lin Shan's body became a conduit for vast amounts of spiritual and stellar energy. His meridians and pores couldn't withstand the torrent, bursting open and bleeding profusely, but he ignored the pain, gritting his teeth as he channeled everything into the sect-guarding divine ability, "Thunderstorm."

The fading golden thunder pool in the sky slowly regained clarity.

"BOOM—"

The dissipating storm clouds gathered once more, shrouding the sky as lightning danced and winds howled.

Countless silver serpents of lightning converged into the golden thunder pool. Once enough energy had accumulated, under the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's eager gaze, the fourth bolt—thick as a barrel—descended with earth-shattering force!

The darkness was momentarily banished as the world lit up.

In that fleeting moment of clarity, the scene within the formation was revealed.

The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator, having just staggered to his feet while clutching the lump of scrap that was once his umbrella, looked up in dazed horror at the incoming lightning. His eyes reflected the inevitable doom, and with a final, desperate scream, he met his end.

"NOOO—!"

"CRACK—!"

Darkness reclaimed the land.

The Five Ghosts Yin Formation shattered under the impact, its remnants scattering in all directions.

"Bzzz—"

A prolonged ringing filled their ears as their vision blurred. For three breaths, time seemed to stand still in absolute silence.

Then, peace.

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord exhaled in unison.

They knew—this time, there was no surviving that strike.

The fourth bolt of the Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation was far more potent than the first three. In his current state, the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator never stood a chance.

The only question was whether his body had been reduced to ashes.

At this thought, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord let out a sudden cry and scrambled into the dissipating mist, desperate to secure its future "vessel" before it was lost.

As for the golden thunder pool in the sky, having lost its target, it faded away without a trace.

Lin Shan paid it no mind. His body swayed dangerously—he was utterly exhausted, his soul and spiritual energy drained to the brink. Right now, even a Qi Refining cultivator could easily overpower him.

Of course, that was assuming they could get past the artifact spirit guarding him.

...

A quarter-hour later, the clouds parted, and sunlight returned to the Forbidden Land.

After consuming several healing pills and using recovery talismans, Lin Shan managed to regain enough strength to stand.

In the distance, amidst the lingering mist, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord waved its Bone Banner, directing its skeletal minions to scavenge the remnants of the two formations.

"It's finally over..."

Lin Shan exhaled deeply. This ambush against a Golden Core cultivator had been fraught with twists and turns, but in the end, his divine ability and spiritual treasure had secured a hard-fought victory.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord soon returned, its light steps suggesting good news.

"How did it go?"

"Hah, not bad!" it cackled. "The Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's flesh was eroded by the heavenly winds, but his umbrella took the brunt of the lightning. His bones are mostly intact, and the marrow's essence remains—more than enough to help me recover to the Golden Core stage."

"Good."

Lin Shan nodded. If the Black Skeleton Demon Lord could regain its Golden Core strength, he would have a powerful ally—a definite boon.

"Oh, and look what I found!"

The demon lord tossed over two items and a storage pouch with a gleeful chuckle.

Lin Shan caught them—one was his previously lost magic treasure, the Severing Water Sword, now returned.

The other was a small golden lock: the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's lifebound magic treasure.

The enhancement panel appeared:

**[Illusory Gold Lock]**

**Quality:** Magic Treasure  
**Description:** A dual-element (metal/wood) illusion magic treasure with twelve layers of restrictions. Crafted from Illusory Goldstone, Shimmering Goldstone, Phantom Spirit Wood, and other materials. Capable of concealing the user's form and aura or trapping enemies in illusions.  
**Enhancement Cost:** 64 points  

...

"An illusion magic treasure!"

Lin Shan marveled at the golden lock. According to the panel, it had two functions—concealment and deception—both incredibly useful.

With its original owner dead, the treasure was now his to claim. Once he reached the Golden Core stage and could wield magic power, it would be his to command.

The black umbrella magic treasure, unfortunately, had been destroyed by the heavenly tribulation, but the lump of scrap metal could still be recycled—let the Black Skeleton Demon Lord deal with that.

As for the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator's storage pouch, a quick inspection revealed only basic travel necessities—no riches to speak of.

He had likely exhausted his wealth breaking through to the Golden Core stage and crafting his lifebound treasure.

But when Lin Shan spotted two stacks of jade slips in a corner, his curiosity got the better of him.

"Hmm? What's this?"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord leaned in as they examined the slips.

One stack consisted entirely of IOUs:

**[Owed to Moonview City Internal Affairs Office: 50,000 spirit stones]**  
**[Owed to White Deer Academy's Elder Zhao: Three fourth-tier spirit materials]**  
**[Owed to Golden Ink Sect's Elder Ma: Ten bottles of Golden Core-stage spirit pills]**  
**[Owed to Master Wan Yan of Hundred Refinements Mountain: Five pieces of forging materials and 100,000 spirit stones in crafting fees]**  

And it didn't end there.

**[Owed to the Dai Family: Sixty years of advance salary]**  
**[Owed to Dai Family Elder Dai Zonghui: 8,000 spirit stones]**  
**[Owed to Dai Family Hall Master Dai Lingcheng: 5,000 spirit stones]**  
**[Owed to Dai Family Manager Dai Wensen: 3,000 spirit stones]**  
**[Owed to Dai Family Disciple Dai Budong: 1,500 spirit stones]**  
**[Owed to Dai Budong's classmate Zhu Duiyou: 800 spirit stones]**  

The list went on—a mountain of debt weighing heavily in their hands.

"..."

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord exchanged glances. Not only was the Dai Family's Golden Core cultivator penniless, he was drowning in debt—all of which they had now inherited!

This ambush had yielded no real gains. Both were severely injured, two Golden Core-stage formations were destroyed (costing over 100,000 spirit stones in materials), and seven or eight fourth-tier Phantom Spirit Woods had been burned.

If not for acquiring the Illusory Gold Lock and the Golden Core corpse, this battle would have been a total loss.

"Damn it..."

Lin Shan grimaced. He didn't mind being targeted—but being targeted by a broke cultivator was the worst!

Ignore him, and he hunts you down across thousands of miles. Kill him, and you realize he's broke!

After cursing vehemently, they turned to the second stack of jade slips—and their jaws dropped.

These weren't IOUs but property deeds—Moonview City assets belonging to the Dai Family, one of the mining giants of the Lu Kingdom. As the Dai Family's representative stationed in Moonview City, the Golden Core cultivator had been entrusted with their safekeeping.

Since they weren't his personal property, he had stashed them in a corner, separate from his debts.

**[Deed: Dai Family Forging Pavilion, Moonview City]**  
**[Deed: Dai Family Metallurgy Workshop, Moonview City]**  
**[Deed: Dai Family Ore Processing Plant, Moonview City]**  
**[Deed: Dai Family Spirit Material Warehouse, Moonview City]**  
**[Deed: Dai Family Reception Office, Moonview City]**  
**[Deed: Dai Family Artifact Repair Tower, Moonview City]**  

...

"???"

"The Dai Family's Moonview City holdings?"

Just when all seemed lost, fortune smiled upon them again.

As a Dai Family member, the Golden Core cultivator wouldn't dare touch these assets. But for a wandering rogue like Lin Shan, who lived by the "hit-and-run" philosophy, such concerns were irrelevant.

Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord locked eyes, their gazes gleaming with the same avaricious spark. Two like-minded souls, both willing to risk everything for profit, hatched a bold plan.

Lin Shan: "I think we need to return to Moonview City."

Black Skeleton Demon Lord: "Indeed. We seem to have left something behind."

Lin Shan: "The Lin Trading Company needs someone to take over."

Black Skeleton Demon Lord: "And we need to replenish our formation materials."

Lin Shan: "Also, shouldn't we liquidate our metallurgy and processing chain before leaving?"

Black Skeleton Demon Lord: "Exactly! We can't just abandon our hard-earned business—that's our life's work!"

The two shared a knowing look, their eyes glowing with wolfish hunger, before breaking into identical grins.

"Ke ke ke~"
