Chapter 72: Go Higher, Just Run

Li Xian kicked the door open and indeed saw his younger brother, Li Xiaofan. His mouth was stuffed with cloth, rendering him unable to speak. There were several red handprints on his face, but his expression was stubborn as he glared fiercely at Li Xian.

"Little brother, it's me," Li Xian said, removing the white cloth from Li Xiaofan's mouth.

"Brother!" Li Xiaofan's eyes lit up, finally recognizing Li Xian. He exclaimed joyfully, "Brother, you've come to save me?"

Then his expression tightened. "This place is very dangerous. They wouldn't dare kill me, but you should run quickly, Brother!"

"Nonsense," Li Xian laughed. "I'm taking you with me."

After untying the ropes, Li Xian saw that Li Xiaofan was only about ten years old and physically weak, so he wouldn't be able to run fast. However, he wasn't heavy, so carrying him on his back wasn't much of a burden.

They exited the firewood room.

To the southeast, flames shot into the sky, and black smoke billowed. Realizing the fire was still spreading, Li Xian didn't dare delay and immediately fled.

Meanwhile...

"Hurry, hurry! Put out the fire for me!"

"If my Little Fragrance dies, I'll make you all pay with your lives!"

The Seventh Young Master, Zheng Caiqi, had a ferocious expression. Learning that his beloved horse was likely being burned to a crisp, his heart bled. He grabbed two servants and threw them into the flames, shouting, "Quickly, save my horse!"

However, the fire was raging; the horse was likely already dead.

"Hm?"

Zheng Caiqi's personal guard, Yang Cheng, suddenly saw members of the Black Water Gang rushing over from a distance. They picked up wooden buckets and splashed water, working even harder than the servants.

He couldn't help but frown slightly.

A fire breaking out on a winter day was inherently suspicious.

"Who sent you?" Yang Cheng asked.

"Huh?" one of the gang members replied, "Didn't the Young Master ask us to come put out the fire?"

Yang Cheng's brow furrowed deeply. As soon as the fire started, he and Zheng Caiqi had rushed over. Although Zheng Caiqi was the young master, he lacked quick thinking and merely panicked.

In his haste, how could he have thought to ask the gang members to help extinguish the fire?

This was clearly suspicious.

Could it be...

Yang Cheng's heart skipped a beat. "Could this be a diversion?"

He didn't believe for a second that a winter fire could start naturally. Yang Cheng shouted, "You, you, bring your men and follow me!"

He took the lead, rushing toward the West Courtyard.

Arriving at the firewood room where the "Flower-Picking Brat" was held, his heart sank. He saw the door wide open, ropes scattered on the ground, and no one inside.

"Just as I thought!"

At that moment, Yang Cheng roared, "Little thief, where do you think you're going!" He leaped over a courtyard wall in one bound and saw a figure running into the forest.

"I'll go ahead to catch the thief! Follow me quickly!" Yang Cheng ordered, then jumped down the wall and chased into the woods.

"Brother, he's coming!" Li Xiaofan looked back and said.

"This guy is smart. He figured it out so quickly," Li Xian felt a bit uneasy but didn't panic.

"He's so fast," Li Xiaofan clicked his tongue as the distance between them closed step by step.

"Little thief, where do you think you're going!"

It didn't take long for Yang Cheng to catch up. He reached out to grab Li Xiaofan, his internal Qi flowing, his intent locking onto the target, making it extremely difficult to dodge. Li Xian spun around abruptly and executed the "Four Directions Fist" to counter him.

With a muffled thud, Li Xian's hand bone cracked slightly, causing intense pain. Fortunately, he had recently benefited from the Tiger Blood Pill, Bear Gall Bladder Pill, and the Hundred Beasts Bath, among other body-strengthening methods. His bones were tough, and his strength was great.

Otherwise, his right hand would have been废 (useless) from that single exchange.

Yang Cheng roared, "Was it you who set the fire to burn the horse!" He was greatly surprised; he didn't expect this young brat to be able to withstand his palm strike. As he spoke, he attacked again.

Li Xian dodged while saying, "What a pity for that snow-white jade horse. It's probably well-done by now. Hahaha."

"Good小子 (brat), on the verge of death, you still dare to be glib-tongued," Yang Cheng said. "I'll capture you alive and let the Young Master deal with you!"

He suddenly changed his move, kicking out without warning. The kick was powerful and terrifying.

This Yang Cheng was a martial arts expert at the "Qi Circulating the Heavenly Cycle" level.

Li Xian dodged to the side.

Yang Cheng's kick landed on the large tree behind him. With a thud, a chunk of the trunk was dented.

However, at that moment, an unexpected change occurred.

Several objects fell from the top of the tree. Before Yang Cheng could see clearly, Li Xian had already caught a narrow-bladed saber and slashed at his right leg!

"Bad!"

Yang Cheng immediately retracted his leg. But he saw Li Xian smile. The narrow-bladed saber划过一道弧度 (drew an arc), changing from a vertical slash to a horizontal cut!

The Four Directions Fist was mastered to perfection, and Li Xian was adept at adapting. Even holding a saber, he could wield it like a fist!

Yang Cheng was caught off guard. He was experienced and could usually see through common tricks like "diversion" and "real versus fake."

But the strength of the Four Directions Fist lay in the fact that it didn't use feints. Every move was a real attack. It was just that through slight changes in the body, the line of force was shifted, drastically altering the killing move in an instant.

He hadn't anticipated this change and knew he had fallen for a trap. With no way to avoid it, he channeled his Qi Circulating the Heavenly Cycle and硬生生接下这一刀 (hardly took the saber strike).

Flesh tore.

The pain pierced his heart!

But it didn't end there. Yang Cheng touched the ground with his toe, creating distance. Unknowingly, this was exactly what Li Xian wanted.

Li Xian used the saber as a projectile and threw it directly. Yang Cheng had no choice but to dodge again.

At the same time, Li Xian caught the "Deer-Shooting Bow," drew it to a full moon, and shot three arrows in succession.

"糟糕 (Trouble)!"

Yang Cheng's hair stood on end. These three arrows were powerful. One aimed for the throat, two for the knees. The three arrows formed a pincer attack.

The intent was clear and ruthless. This person was not only a master archer but also extremely calm and scheming.

From the moment Yang Cheng gave chase, Li Xian had already planned his response.

Yang Cheng's internal Qi cultivation, martial arts attainment, and combat experience were clearly superior to his opponent's.

Yet he was being led by the nose.

"Damn it!"

Yang Cheng's anger flared, and he took a desperate gamble. To save his life, he had to dodge the arrow aimed at his throat. But if he did that, his knees would be pierced, rendering him immobile, which was also a dead end.

The only solution was to take all three arrows without dodging, but to shift his body slightly so that although the arrows pierced his flesh, they only grazed him.

Yang Cheng was a quick thinker. His body trembled slightly, and he actually managed to do it. His throat was cut, bleeding profusely, but his windpipe wasn't severed. His knees were pierced, the arrows embedded in his flesh but not damaging the tendons or bones.

"Good!" Li Xian couldn't help but applaud. Such a response truly opened his eyes. However, as soon as he finished speaking, he carried Li Xiaofan on his back and turned to flee deeper into the woods.

"Guardian Yang!"

The encounter between the two was actually just a matter of moments.

By now, the members of the Black Water Gang had arrived late.

"Chase! Chase him for me!"

"Cough, cough..."

Yang Cheng covered his throat, his heart still pounding with fear. Then, the anger in his heart was ignited.

He had already reached the "Qi Circulating the Heavenly Cycle" level, half a step into "Solidifying Blood and Closing Pores," which slowed his bleeding, allowing him to simply bandage the wound.

The injury wasn't too serious, nor was it light.

Normally, he would need to rest for several days. But today, the Young Master's beloved horse had died. If he didn't capture the little thief, he wouldn't be able to justify himself.

So he personally entered the forest to capture Li Xian.

"Brother, you're really amazing!" Li Xiaofan looked at him with admiration.

"You're amazing too. At such a young age, you've already picked flowers," Li Xian laughed.

"Hehe," Li Xiaofan scratched his head.

"Xiaofan, today I'll send you out of Huangyu County. From now on, you'll have to walk your own path."

"Even if I want to help, my reach is limited," Li Xian said seriously.

"Okay, Brother, I won't let you down," Li Xiaofan nodded heavily. A trace of the same resoluteness and tenacity as Li Xian flashed across his young face.

"I've heard a lot lately. Things like luck, literary energy... it's all very mysterious."

"They all say I'm a mud-splasher, and my family are mud-splashes too, unworthy."

"I don't care about all that. I only know that I don't want Brother and me to be bullied anymore."

"Brother's job as a guard isn't easy either. I know that very well. Now that I've picked flowers, I'll go higher, even higher."

"Brother, wait for me."

As he spoke, Li Xiaofan clenched his fist and touched the red marks on his face. They were still burning.

Li Xian felt quite gratified.

At that moment, they suddenly saw a gray horse deep in the forest, with a crooked mouth and a hideous, ugly appearance.

When the stable burned, the most inconspicuous horse had been the first to escape.

Li Xian's face lit up. He mounted the horse. Although he hadn't learned horseback riding, relying on his martial arts skills to forcibly tame the horse wasn't difficult.

It was already late at night.

Pursuers were closing in from behind.

But the path ahead was pitch black.

Snowflakes drifted between heaven and earth. Li Xiaofan held tightly to the corner of Li Xian's garment.

"Forget it, let's go!"

The path ahead was pitch black. He couldn't see the road at all. It could be a deep pit or a cliff; it all depended on luck. But... he just spurred the horse forward. If there was no road, he would carve one out.

Since coming to this world, Li Xian had experienced many injustices and suppressions. Even though his situation was gradually improving thanks to the principle of "Heaven rewards diligence," he often felt the insurmountable gap between people.

He often felt oppressed.

But at this moment...

Despite the danger of the situation, the ugly horse beneath him galloped.

The wind and snow stirred their hair. The world was pitch black, as if nothing existed, yet an untimely sense of heroism arose in his heart.

Li Xian patted the horse's back.

In the dead of night, between heaven and earth, such a scene was painted:

An ugly horse carrying a guard, the guard carrying a child. Wind and snow mixed with pursuers, a great fire rising in the distance.

The curses were swallowed by the wind and snow.
