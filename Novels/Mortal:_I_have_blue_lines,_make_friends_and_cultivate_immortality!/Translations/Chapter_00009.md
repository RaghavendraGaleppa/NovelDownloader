# Chapter 9: A Visitor Comes to Buy a Magical Artifact Fragment!

The two arrived at the trading area and began browsing around. From morning till night, they couldn't find the talisman brush Han Li was looking for.

"Hmm?" Lin Yun felt somewhat puzzled, stroking his chin in confusion. "Where's Han Yunzhi? Did we come too early, and she hasn't set up her stall yet?"

"How strange."

While Lin Yun was pondering Han Yunzhi's absence, Han Li was drawn away by a commotion from a vendor.

"Your magical artifact fragment is too small. How about selling it to me for five spirit stones?"

"No deal! This is a magical artifact fragment!"

"Let me make this clear—this single pill of mine is more than enough to trade for your fragment!"

The offer had dropped from five spirit stones to just one pill.

"No! This is a magical artifact fragment!" the vendor insisted.

"You—" The handsome male cultivator was infuriated by the vendor's stubbornness.

A beautiful female cultivator nearby looked at him with disdain, keeping her distance.

She had never wanted to come to the Tai Nan gathering with this man, but family obligations had forced her. 

She chose to ignore him to avoid further irritation.

"Hey, little sister, what does this magical artifact fragment do?" a wandering cultivator nearby asked curiously.

"It does this!" The female vendor happily demonstrated the fragment's ability to conceal auras, hoping to fetch a higher price.

When the fragment was placed over a first-level Golden-Eating Rat, the beast's aura vanished completely, astonishing the onlookers.

Han Li, witnessing this, was thrilled. "This is incredibly useful! I must have it!"

He quickly pushed forward.

As the female vendor struggled with the crowd, Han Li stepped up and offered thirty spirit stones on the spot.

Gasps erupted from the surrounding cultivators.

The vendor beamed. "Deal!"

She handed over the fragment in exchange for the spirit stones.

Both the vendor, pleased with the sale, and Han Li, ecstatic over his new treasure, were happy.

"I owe this to Brother Lin. If not for his earlier help, I wouldn't have had the spirit stones to buy this fragment," Han Li thought gratefully.

"I must properly thank Brother Lin when we part ways."

He resolved to leave Lin Yun a few bottles of pills as thanks.

While the two were content, the male cultivator who had been haggling earlier wore a venomous expression. He had hoped to secure the fragment for a few spirit stones through bargaining.

Now, some random wandering cultivator had ruined his plan.

"Damn these lowly wandering cultivators!"

"You're asking for death!"

His anger flared, recalling how another wandering cultivator, Lu Yunfeng, had once crossed him. Unable to contain his rage, he struck Han Li with a palm strike, sending him flying.

Caught off guard in his excitement and facing an opponent of higher cultivation, Han Li couldn't react in time. He crashed to the ground, clutching his stomach in pain.

The magical artifact fragment he had just acquired fell into Lu Yunfeng's hands.

"Kid! Do you really think a lowly wandering cultivator like you deserves a magical artifact fragment?" Lu Yunfeng sneered at Han Li.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun, having given up on finding Han Yunzhi, decided to take Han Li back and try again another day.

But when he looked around, Han Li was nowhere to be seen.

"Damn it! Where's my lucky charm?"

"Who took my lucky charm?!"

Just as Lin Yun was about to lose his temper, a commotion erupted at a crowded stall ahead.

Han Li was sent flying out of the crowd.

Clutching his stomach in pain, Han Li's eyes burned with fury.

"Even in the world of cultivation, such people exist!"

"It seems good people like Brother Lin are rare. Staying with him made me let my guard down."

"From now on, I must plan carefully before acting."

Though unwilling to let go of the fragment, Han Li had no choice against a stronger opponent. He staggered to his feet, preparing to leave.

Some wandering cultivators mocked him. "This guy is clearly a rookie. He should've known better than to mess with someone like that."

Others sighed sympathetically. "Such is the world of cultivation—strength reigns supreme."

A pink-robed female cultivator hidden in the crowd observed Lu Yunfeng with interest. "Not bad. A rare talent with a mutated spiritual root."

Just as everyone thought Han Li would swallow his pride and leave, a sharp voice cut through the air.

"Hold it!"

All eyes turned to see a handsome Taoist priest striding forward.

In the blink of an eye, Lin Yun weaved through the crowd and reached Han Li, handing him a healing pill.

"So fast! I didn't even see him move!" The onlookers were stunned.

"That movement technique... That's no ordinary artifact. He must be from a prominent sect," the pink-robed woman mused, eyeing Lin Yun's Cloud-Treading Boots.

"It's him! He's here at the Tai Nan gathering too?!" Chen Qiaoqian, who had been standing aloof, melted at the sight of Lin Yun.

Her icy demeanor thawed like spring reviving the earth, a radiant smile breaking across her face.

She instinctively stepped forward but hesitated, her foot hovering mid-air as conflicting emotions twisted her expression.

She turned away, trembling, and whispered to herself, "Don't see me! Don't see me!"

Yet she couldn't resist stealing glances at Lin Yun.

Her abrupt departure years ago had been unavoidable.

"Brother Lin." Han Li was surprised by Lin Yun's sudden appearance. He lowered his head sheepishly. "Sorry for causing trouble."

"Don't say that. We're brothers, aren't we? Take this pill first." Lin Yun fed Han Li the healing pill.

[Ding! Host has gifted healing pills to friend Han Li, triggering "Cast thy bread upon the waters!"]

[Ding! Congratulations, host has received a reward: Foundation Establishment Pills ×1 bottle (5 pills).]

[Foundation Establishment Pill description: Pills that assist Qi Refinement cultivators in cleansing their meridians and advancing to the Foundation Establishment stage. Source: Han Li's own refinement.]

"Healing pills for Foundation Establishment Pills?!" Lin Yun was shocked by the system's reward. A bold idea formed in his mind.

"Someone, feed Young Master Han more healing pills!"

Lin Yun proceeded to give Han Li two more bottles.

[Ding! Congratulations, host has received Foundation Establishment Pills ×10 bottles (50 pills).]

"Brother Lin! That's enough! Really, no more!" Han Li was overwhelmed.

Though healing pills weren't extremely rare, they weren't cheap either.

Lin Yun's genuine concern moved Han Li deeply.

"Was it you who robbed my brother and attacked him?!" Lin Yun glared furiously.

"Do you know that Han Li and I are like brothers from different parents?!"

"How dare you hurt my brother!"

"If you've damaged my treasure—I mean, my brother—where will I find another like him?!"

"Their bond is this strong?!" The surrounding cultivators were envious of Han Li, who had such a loyal friend.

"Brother Lin Yun, still as chivalrous as ever. Even after all these years, he hasn't changed." Chen Qiaoqian smiled fondly, reminiscing about the past.

Years ago, when she was ambushed by demonic cultivators, Lin Yun had saved her without hesitation and tended to her wounds.

Her time with him had been the happiest and freest period of her life.

But alas, those days were gone.

"Is this guy courting death?" The pink-robed woman scoffed at Lin Yun's intervention.

Lin Yun was at the tenth level of Qi Refinement, while Lu Yunfeng was at the eleventh. Not only was Lin Yun weaker, but his opponent was also a rare wind-attribute mutated spiritual root talent, far surpassing ordinary cultivators.

Her verdict: "Seeking his own doom!"

Lu Yunfeng sneered at Lin Yun. "Kid, are you looking to die?!"
