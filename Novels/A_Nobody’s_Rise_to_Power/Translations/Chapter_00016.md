# Chapter 16: The Soul Arrives at Tianshui

The call to the soul to return was solemn and grand.

The scene of the eldest young master of the Yu family, Yu Chengye, having his spirit welcomed back was truly magnificent.

When Yang Can’s group crossed the Pan Mountains and entered the territory of Tianshui, people from the Yu family came to meet them.

They had brought a carriage pulled by eight horses to deliver a new coffin for Yu Chengye.

Strictly speaking, the previous coffin was merely a crude box, a shabby thing pieced together with wooden planks.

Now, they had a true inner and outer coffin. The inner coffin was made of nanmu wood, four inches thick, inlaid with gold leaf and decorated with cloud patterns.

The outer coffin was carved from a single block of bluestone, engraved with auspicious images such as the Four Divine Beasts.

The welcoming party had also prepared a large quantity of funeral supplies. This group, originally a wedding procession, finally no longer had to awkwardly escort the spirit while wearing festive clothing.

As they traveled along the way, the entire route was draped in white mourning.

Every village, manor, and city was shrouded in hemp and dressed in filial piety, with altars set up along the road to offer sacrifices.

Village heads, manor lords, and city magistrates all set up incense tables and fine wine, leading the local dignitaries and elders to welcome the return of the eldest young master of the Yu family.

The heads of the various branches of the Yu family, elders, and stewards distributed throughout Tianshui, along with powerful figures from all quarters, scholars, monks, Taoists, and gentry merchants...

They were all rushing toward Phoenix Mountain.

These people almost completely covered the most prestigious and powerful individuals within the territory of the Yu family.

This was only because the matter had started suddenly, leaving no time to notify a wider range of people.

Otherwise, with such an important figure of the Yu family passing away, other aristocratic families would surely have sent people to offer condolences.

Yang Can was not visiting Phoenix Manor for the first time; he had been there before when accompanying Yu Chengye.

But returning to the foot of Phoenix Mountain and witnessing such a grand scene, he still felt a sense of awe in his heart.

Such luxurious pomp was in itself a form of authority and power.

Although those wealthy people had money, they weren't truly foolish enough to waste it indiscriminately.

This extravagance was actually creating a kind of power, a kind of power that made people look up in awe, a kind of power that made people submit in fear.

The formation of authority cannot be separated from such resounding prestige.

Having lived two lives, Yang Can was considered to have seen much of the world, yet he still felt awe upon seeing this. How could those illiterate commoners help but feel fear and reverence?

This was only the Yu family, the weakest of the Eight Fates of Longshang, yet they possessed such a grand and imposing spectacle, almost comparable to that of princes and marquises.

If it were the top three families, what kind of scene would that be?

If it were the ruler of the world, what would it be like?

A great man should be like this!

Yang Can had always been a man who adapted to his circumstances. It wasn't that he was inherently Buddhist-like, but rather that in both his past and present lives, he had never had the opportunity to harbor ambition.

But this time was different. The sudden whim of Grandma Tu had created a crisis for him, but it had also brought an opportunity.

If at the beginning Yang Can was still being forced into a difficult situation, now he wanted to seize the opportunity proactively.

Unlike Yang Can, upon entering the Yu family's territory, Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan was in a state of constant panic.

As long as Yang Can's secret with the young mistress wasn't exposed, he wouldn't face a life-threatening crisis.

But Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan was about to face a great disaster. He had done many messy things before and was trying to make amends, but he didn't know if it would be effective.

The uneasy Cheng Dakuan sidled up to Yang Can and whispered, "Master Yang, I haven't been able to eat my steamed buns or sleep well these past few days. I've just been worrying about how the Family Head will deal with me..."

His eyes were bloodshot, and he asked in a hoarse voice, "Master Yang, you're a scholar and understand many principles. Tell me, how will the Family Head deal with me?"

Yang Can said, "Dakuan, have you seen this grand funeral scene?"

"The noble are born with dignity, and leave behind a powerful legacy even in death."

"When alive, their gates are lined with halberds; when dead, their monuments rise to the clouds. This is the order of heaven and earth."

Leopard Head looked blank. "Master Yang, say something I can understand."

Yang Can said, "This means that a great figure like the heir apparent of the Yu family cannot die an unknown death."

"Someone must pay the price so that this noble man's death is not in vain. Do you understand?"

Leopard Head gritted his teeth. "Is this person who must pay the price... me?"

Yang Can nodded. "It must be. It can only be you."

Leopard Head's face turned deathly pale in an instant. "Master Yang, you said that as long as I did as you told me, there would be a sliver of a chance for survival. You said..."

Yang Can quickly comforted him, "Don't be anxious. The Yu family's welcoming party has already arrived, but they didn't arrest you on the spot. Instead, they allowed you to travel with the procession."

"What does this show? It shows that our previous efforts were not in vain. You have already grasped that sliver of life."

Leopard Head nervously licked his lips, which were already covered with several blisters.

"Master Yang, what should I do next?"

"Wait!"

"Wait for what?"

"Wait for the Family Head to summon me."

Leopard Head was about to cry. "Master Yang, I really haven't studied. Please say something that even an 'illiterate blind man' like me can understand."

Yang Can said, "As long as the Family Head is willing to summon me, it means he needs some people who are not on good terms with the Suo family to work for him."

"So, as long as the Family Head is willing to summon me, there will definitely be a chance for you to survive!"

Not long after entering Phoenix Mountain, there was an orchard on the side of the mountain.

Many domestic fowl were raised in this orchard to provide vegetables, fruits, and meat and eggs for Phoenix Manor.

Now, this orchard had been temporarily converted into a mourning palace to hold the spirit.

The members of the Yu family sent to welcome the spirit here would dress in white and escort the spirit up the mountain in mourning.

The person presiding over the welcoming ceremony was Yu Chengye's second uncle, Yu Huanhu.

Yu Huanhu was Yu Chengye's paternal uncle, belonging to the second branch of the eldest generation of the family.

As an elder, theoretically, he did not need to come down the mountain to welcome the spirit.

But Yu Chengye was the heir apparent of the Yu family, equivalent to the Crown Prince, and Yu Huanhu was like a prince.

Although they were uncle and nephew, they were also lord and subject. It was not inappropriate for him, the biological second uncle, to welcome the spirit.

Suo Chanzhi, as Yu Chengye's widow, publicly cut a lock of her black hair and placed it in the coffin.

With this ritual, she confirmed her identity as the eldest daughter-in-law of the Yu family's main line, and no one could change it.

A nine-foot "banner of fame" was draped over the spirit carriage, the large characters "Yu Family's Eldest Legitimate Son Chengye's Bier" covering the entire coffin.

When he saw the coffin, Yu Huanhu's expression was very unsightly.

Although the "truth" of Yu Chengye's death had not yet spread, there were many rumors about it.

And in these rumors, he was portrayed as the prime murderer.

He certainly wished for Yu Chengye to die, but assassinating him during his wedding procession would have too great a consequence.

After much deliberation, Yu Huanhu still didn't dare to make a move, but who knew that Yu Chengye died anyway.

He had to take the blame for something he didn't do, so how could his mood be good?

"Yu Family's Suo Clan, greets Uncle!"

Since the uncle had personally come to welcome the spirit, as the widow, Suo Chanzhi naturally had to step forward to pay her respects.

This young, grieving widow, dressed in mourning clothes, bowed gracefully to Yu Huanhu. Tears welled up in her eyes, her beautiful face filled with sorrow, looking truly pitiful.

Yu Huanhu didn't think much of it, but the younger generation of the Yu family who were of the same generation or one generation younger than Yu Chengye were captivated.

The widow before them had a slender waist and a delicate bone structure; she was clearly a fairy in white.

Look at her white mourning clothes, her half-loosened cloud-like hair, her pale, beautiful face, and the tears glistening in her eyes...

It was truly heartbreaking.

Chengye that boy was indeed fortunate...

Alas! He was fortunate, but his fortune was thin!

It was such a pity that this piece of good land, with its fine mountains and waters, was now left fallow and would become barren. Just thinking about it made one's heart ache to the point of breathlessness!

"Niece-in-law, please rise. Control your grief."

Yu Huanhu let out a deep sigh, mustered his energy, and raised his hand to help her up虚扶 (a gesture of support without physical contact).

After comforting Suo Chanzhi, Yu Huanhu began to arrange the ceremony for welcoming the spirit up the mountain.

The spirit carriage was replaced by a hearse with six fans, with Yu Chengye's younger brother, Yu Chenglin, holding the "merit cloth" as the vanguard.

Subsequently, the cousins and younger generations of the Yu family within the five degrees of mourning, dressed in "filial mourning" and "coarse mourning" attire, supported the spirit carriage and wept mournfully as they ascended the mountain.

During this process, Yang Can was completely an invisible person, with no opportunity for him to step forward.

Since entering Tianshui territory, more and more people had surrounded Suo Chanzhi, and Yang Can no longer had the chance to get close to her.

In the midst of the busyness, it seemed no one remembered this Master Yang.

Therefore, Yang Can was not transferred back to the Yu family's side. Suo Chanzhi herself was unable to break away, so she handed him over to Qingmei to arrange for him.

"Here, you, just stay here for these few days. Don't wander around randomly, you know?"

Qingmei led Yang Can into the first courtyard of Yu Chengye's residence and into a side room.

As the heir apparent of the Yu family, Yu Chengye possessed an independent large courtyard within Phoenix Manor.

This courtyard was located on the east side of the manor. Although it was part of the entire manor, it was relatively independent.

It was a three-entry courtyard with independent high walls and an independent entrance and exit.

Even if it were cut out from the entire Phoenix Manor, it would still be a complete three-entry manor.

This side room was quite spacious, with a layout of three rooms in one entry: a central hall with two side rooms.

"Thank you for your care, Miss Qingmei." Yang Can nodded to Qingmei. He was quite satisfied with this "cell."

This treatment was no worse than when he was Yu Chengye's secretary.

"Ahem, what are you talking about? I didn't care for you."

"Anyway, three meals a day will be brought to you. Just stay here honestly and don't go out wandering around for no reason."

As soon as Yang Can was polite to her, Qingmei felt extremely uncomfortable.

Her feelings for Yang Can were now very complicated.

On one hand, she was Suo Chanzhi's personal maid, and the two were as close as sisters.

So whenever she heard the sounds of Suo Chanzhi being bullied by Yang Can, she felt a sense of shared outrage.

According to her logic, if you bully my girl, isn't that equivalent to bullying me?

But on the other hand, precisely because she was Suo Chanzhi's personal maid, she could easily put herself in her mistress's shoes.

Once she did that, her feelings for Yang Can became strangely complicated.

So now, when she was alone with Yang Can, she would inexplicably feel flustered.

As soon as Yang Can mentioned "care," Qingmei, as if afraid he might misunderstand something, hurriedly tried to clear herself: "Alright, alright, you... just rest well. I... I have to go serve my lady."

Qingmei found an excuse in a panic and fled, as if there were a heart-stealing ghost hiding in the room.
