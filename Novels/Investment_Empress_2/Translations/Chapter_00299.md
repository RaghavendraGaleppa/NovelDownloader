# Chapter 299: True Spirit Submission, the Qualification of a Ten-Thousand-Man Enemy!

Inside the central command tent.

Qu Sheng wore a long robe beneath his outer garments. Although this slightly unusual attire might seem out of place on others, on him, it appeared natural—possessing the elegance of a scholar while retaining the imposing aura of authority.

Looking at the freshly reported military supply figures, his brow furrowed into a deep "three" character shape.

The generals and advisors within the tent remained silent, their expressions filled with indignation.

"Report! The Wa Yue tribe is showing signs of movement, seemingly intending to move toward Green Wood City!"

A messenger rushed into the tent.

After relaying the intelligence brought by the scouts, the silence in the tent was finally broken by the sound of a fist slamming onto the table.

"The military pay has been reduced again."

"Hmph, that wouldn't be so bad, but from the Imperial Capital to the Southern Pass, who knows how many parasites have skimmed off the top. By the time it reaches us, who knows how much is left!"

"The supplies and pay for the eighty thousand troops in Green Wood City were already partially funded out of the王爷's (Prince's) own pocket."

"What does His Majesty mean by this? Does he want us to abandon Green Wood City?"

"Green Wood City is the shield of the Southern Pass. If we abandon Green Wood today, we will abandon the Southern Pass tomorrow. We might as well all take off our armor and go home!"

It wasn't until Qu Sheng let out a cold snort that these angry voices finally subsided.

"The only thing a general needs to keep in mind is the phrase 'exhaust oneself completely'."

"Who was it that just spoke of taking off their armor? Go receive thirty military rods."

The generals looked at this commander who had even moved his family to Green Wood City, exchanged glances, and all looked toward the man who had spoken the most fiercely earlier.

The big man grunted an acknowledgment of the order and got up to leave the tent.

As the dull sound of military rods striking a back echoed from outside, Qu Sheng spoke slowly again:

"First, report the military situation to the王爷 for his decision."

"Every unit must stay alert. From today onward, alcohol is strictly forbidden in the army. Those who violate this will be severely punished. You are all dismissed."

"Yes."

Not long after, the tent was left with only him alone.

Qu Sheng remained silent for a long while before calling out to his personal guard:

"Where is the Young Marquis?"

"He organized a hundred-man formation at the drill grounds to spar with that Li Tianjiao. It was Zhong Ling who instigated it."

"A hundred-man formation is enough to rival an Inner Scene expert. If one is not familiar with formation techniques, that Li Tianjiao might suffer a small loss."

Qu Sheng nodded upon hearing this.

Talent is often arrogant. It would be good for him to let Li Mo (Ying Bing) experience the ruthlessness of the battlefield and the insignificance of individual strength. Then, he could persuade them to leave Green Wood City as soon as possible, along with the Young Marquis.

With this thought, he walked out of the central command tent and headed toward the drill grounds.

...

On the other side.

The sun was high in the sky. The north wind swept across the land, but it could not disperse the killing intent of the battlefield.

Under tight coordination, the hundred personal guards were like the most precise mechanical parts, operating with the formation. Their Qi and energy twisted into a single rope.

If the formation were compared to a sharp blade, then Zhong Zhenyue was the tip of that blade.

He wore heavy armor. The energy of the formation gathered to its peak upon him, and even the phantom behind him vaguely emitted the sounds of iron horses and golden spears, along with earth-shattering shouts of battle.

It carried a hint of an Inner Scene domain.

An ordinary person facing this formation would likely be so terrified their legs would shake and their mind go blank.

"Your physique is particularly suited to formation techniques," Li Mo couldn't help but praise.

"No wonder Brother Li's ranking on the Hidden Dragon List has risen by so many spots," Zhong Zhenyue said with a solemn expression. "Did you perhaps comprehend another Zhi Zhi (Eye of Retaliation) Divine Intent while in the Southern Frontier?"

He had heard long ago that Zhu Yan, Qiong Qi, and Zhi Zhi were among the most battle-loving tribes among the妖族 (Demon Race). As for Wu Zhi Qi, it had vanished long ago, while Zhi Zhi and Zhu Yan were both Disaster Beasts.

Li Mo shook his head. "This is not a Divine Intent, but the power of a residual True Spirit bloodline..."

"True Spirit?"

"Yes."

"Hiss, this True Spirit bloodline is surprisingly similar to a Divine Intent."

"The two are indeed very similar in essence..."

On the command platform, Zhong Ling frowned.

*Great, these two have actually started chatting. Where is the seriousness?*

The once confident and proud Zhong Zhenyue had changed ever since returning from Yunzhou.

---

He had become even less interested in women, even more focused on martial arts, and didn't even pay attention to her anymore...

All to chase the back of that "Wang Qi Dou Hun" (Helpful Wife Fighting Spirit).

So, she waved her command flag.

For a formation, "military orders are as heavy as a mountain" was not just a figure of speech.

Instantly.

The power flowing through Zhong Zhenyue surged with the momentum of the troops, ready to strike. Even if he wanted to hold back, he couldn't. He had no choice but to shout loudly:

"Blades and swords have no eyes, be careful, Brother Li!"

"Come!" Li Mo exhaled a white breath. He too felt fighting spirit flowing through his body, his blood seeming to burn!

This time, it was truly burning!

In the blink of an eye.

A massive shadow of a halberd, carrying a sharp killing intent, descended upon Li Mo.

This was only the main attacker, Zhong Zhenyue. Spears from the surrounding troops rained down from all directions like a storm.

*Clang!*

The forty percent power he had gathered, combined with the sharp edge of military killing intent, crashed head-on into the attack.

After the thunderous boom, a large crater appeared on the spot.

As the dust and smoke cleared, the scene inside was revealed.

A stalemate.

Zhong Ling's eyes widened, her lips parted in shock.

A strike capable of shaking a Level 6 Disaster Beast had been blocked by a single person!

And the flesh-grinding spears striking that youth actually sparked against his skin!

To clash with a formation using pure physical strength within the same realm?

Forget a human, even a Disaster Beast would find it impossible!

Was his physical body comparable to an Inner Scene expert who practiced external martial arts? Was this the terror of a top-tier talent on the Hidden Dragon List?

Moreover...

Wasn't he a swordsman?!

Zhong Ling's worldview shifted slightly, but she still gritted her teeth and commanded the formation.

Her mastery of formations was truly impressive. Realizing that a direct assault was useless, she stopped trying to overpower him head-on. Under her command, the hundred guards transformed into waves of sharp edges, striking repeatedly to wear him down, like water dripping through stone.

The strategy was simple: exhaust him!

Even an Inner Scene expert trapped in a formation could very well be worn to death.

"Good timing."

Standing alone in the black tide, Li Mo was like an ancient reef that had stood for eternity, showing no sign of wavering.

At this moment, the Zhi Zhi True Spirit let out a wild roar.

He swung his hammer. The seven Xuan Dantians and thirty-six major meridians allowed his strength to flow endlessly, growing fiercer the more he fought!

"Roar!"

The Zhi Zhi True Spirit finally acknowledged this youth, willingly transforming into a stream of light and merging into the Stone Monkey Divine Mark.

The characteristics of the Zhi Zhi flashed over Li Mo's body for an instant.

His fighting spirit reached its peak at this moment!

*Boom!*

**Ding Feng Bo (Calming the Wind and Waves)!**

A hammer fell, striking the ground. The yellow earth churned like surging waves.

The immense force spread in all directions, sweeping over every guard. Even those with roots planted firmly in the ground couldn't stabilize themselves, tumbling over in disarray. The formation collapsed instantly.

Zhong Zhenyue stumbled back, using his spear to prop himself up, barely avoiding falling on his butt.

Zhong Ling stood dumbfounded, the command flag slipping silently from her grasp.

At the entrance of the drill grounds.

"If this child's bravery... if he were to join the military, given time..."

Qu Sheng stood with his hands behind his back, stepping onto the drill grounds. He stared at the youth in the field—head raised, chest out, stripped to the waist, growing into a young man—and his eyes shone with intense light.

"He would surely become a Ten-Thousand-Man Enemy, a God-General of this era!"
