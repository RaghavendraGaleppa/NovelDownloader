# Chapter 157: The Ice Cube Breaks Through, The Demonic Sect's Ways

Bang—

The hammer strike landed with a sound like hitting dried leather.

Yin Huaxuan flew backward, his body twisting unnaturally in mid-air to dissipate the force completely.

By the time he landed, he had channeled the impact into the ground, shattering countless stones.

Li Mo glanced at the White-Horned Great Eagle nearby but did not release a signal arrow.

He activated the Eye of Fate.

**[Name: Yin Huaxuan]**

**[Physique: Hundred Beast Blood Body]**
**[Cultivation: Inner Scene Eighth Heaven]**
**[Fate: Blue with a touch of Grey]**
**[Evaluation: Protector of the Hundred Beast Hall of the Summoning Demonic Sect. The horn on his head is broken, his inner world is sealed, currently in a severely injured state.]**

...

**[Name: Futu.]**
**[Age: 45]**
**[Physique: Hundred Beast Blood Body]**
**[Cultivation: Observing the God, Eight Apertures]**
**[Fate: Blue]**
**[Evaluation: Guide of the Hundred Beast Hall of the Summoning Demonic Sect, Yin Huaxuan's subordinate. Has been infiltrating Qingyuan Sect for thirty years, extremely deep-minded. Innate physique is extremely poor, hoping to gain a higher position within the Summoning Demonic Sect to reverse his meridians and change his fate.]**
**[Recent Events: Helped Yin Huaxuan escape and planted a hidden hand within his body.]**

...

Yin Huaxuan's face flushed with a sickly red.

"Futu, delay brings change. If we don't join forces to kill him, both of us will be left here!"

As soon as he finished speaking, he forcefully circulated his energy. Scales grew all over his body, making him look like a Flood Dragon Demon as he charged forward head-on.

A terrifying fluctuation swept through the area, and the stone pillars of the Stream Stone Forest shattered one by one.

However, the horn on his forehead was already broken, and his aura was much weaker than it had been in Qinghe County.

Old grudges and new hatreds.

He went all out the moment he attacked.

The White-Horned Great Eagle also dove from the sky to kill.

"Senior Yin Huaxuan."

"We haven't seen each other for a few days, and you've fallen so far?"

Li Mo used the First Style of the Fighting King while the Red Dawn Sword in his right hand flared with light. Sword shadows piled up, resembling a solar wheel.

After obtaining two Xuan Dans within his body, this supreme technique shone with a brilliance far greater than before.

"Die!"

Suddenly, Futu arrived as well, his eyes filled with icy sharpness.

His body swelled, looking as if cast from steel.

Roars of tigers and leopards exploded in the air. Shadows of the beasts appeared behind him, seemingly solid. A great oppressive force swept in like a tide.

This was the result of observing the God Observing Diagram, condensing one's own intent soul to reinforce oneself, thereby doubling the power of one's attacks.

It could be said that any Cultivator of the Observing the God stage would not be able to hold on for long under this encirclement.

However, the aperture in Li Mo's brow began to shine softly at that moment.

He had only just reached the first aperture of the Observing the God stage.

His intent soul was not strong enough to depict that magnificent Dao Divine Form.

But if it was just to release a sliver of moonlight to protect himself, it was sufficient.

Hum—

Moonlight enveloped his body, like a sheer, watery gauze.

Instantly, everything around him seemed to slow down. Li Mo could see the White-Horned Great Eagle, which was fast as lightning, its feathers slowly dancing in the wind.

"No, they haven't slowed down."

"I have sped up."

Understanding arose in Li Mo's mind.

Moreover, this difference in speed was not merely about velocity.

It was about time.

...

Precious Beast Peak.

Elder Han He arrived the fastest. He looked at Ouyang and the others, then at the corpses of the exotic beasts on the ground, and said in a deep voice, "Did you find Yin Huaxuan's trail?"

"Reporting to the Elder, the exotic beasts of Precious Beast Peak suddenly went berserk for no reason, which is why we released the signal arrow."

Xu Zhiqing sheathed her sword and cupped her fist.

"Exotic beasts going berserk?"

Elder Han He frowned in surprise. The exotic beasts on the ground were only Rank Eight.

Ouyang wiped his sweat and said, "Actually, there were quite a few Rank Seven exotic beasts just now."

"And now?"

"Slain by Junior Brother Li."

Xu Zhiqing bit her lip, her expression complex.

If it hadn't been for Junior Brother Li, the few of them would have been injured to some extent.

"Slain..."

Elder Han He was stunned for a moment.

The old man thought to himself that he wasn't blind, but where were the bodies?

---

Ouyang lowered his voice. "Junior Brother Li seems to have a spatial artifact. He put them all away after killing them."

Elder Han He: "....."

The true disciples who followed him: "...."

His hands aren't exactly clean.

Elder Han He rubbed his forehead helplessly.

"Alright, tell me exactly what happened."

"Elder, I drew it all down. You might as well just look at this."

Ouyang held up a sketchbook.

Elder Han He gave him a strange look and took the sketchbook to flip through it.

He saw the scene of Li Mo slaughtering the beasts and chasing the White-Horned Great Eagle into the sky.

Berserk...

That White-Horned Great Eagle was clearly different from the other enraged beasts; it hadn't lost its理智 (sanity). If so, why was it mixed in with them?

Elder Han He pondered this.

"Let's follow that White-Horned Great Eagle and see."

With that said.

He took to the air once again.

...

Meanwhile.

In the Autumn Water Pavilion, within the Mist Flower Immortal Spring.

Atop the artificial mountain, quiet moonlight shone down.

Mist rose and swirled, and the sound of water occasionally echoed as it struck the pool walls.

Ying Bing, wearing a fitted bathrobe, had her figure accentuated by the clinging fabric due to the hot spring water. Her figure was truly exquisite.

It had to be said.

This spring water was indeed very comfortable...

After soaking in it, it felt as if small fish were gently nibbling at her, similar to a fish spa treatment. Even the circulation of the two Xuan Dans within her seemed to speed up a little.

Her spirit was also soothed as if by a gentle hand.

At this moment, her mind was clear.

The system's rankings, the anomalies of the heavens and earth, the crisis of Qingyuan Sect... all distracting thoughts drifted away.

"Feels good, doesn't it?"

Shang Wu smiled and said, "I made a skylight in this artificial mountain. You can see the moon from here too."

"Mm."

Ying Bing raised her head and looked at the bright moon in the sky.

She could now control the power of the sun within her body.

Because, she had already touched the source of power.

Opening an aperture.

Hum—

Suddenly, a strange fluctuation arrived.

The pool water rippled.

Shang Wu, who was drinking wine, widened her almond-shaped eyes and smiled as she downed the cup.

"Little Bing'er, you're quite fast too."

Indeed.

With the two souls of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, plus observing the incomplete Bronze Divine Tree, Ying Bing had also reached the opportunity to open an aperture.

Her brow was currently shimmering.

A patch of jade-like light was slowly taking shape.

Shang Wu yawned, guarding Ying Bing while looking outside the artificial mountain.

"I wonder if my precious disciple is coming back tonight?"

...

Stream Stone Forest.

The battle had evidently reached its climax.

Li Mo held a sword in his right hand and a hammer in his left, attacking from both sides. The wind of the hammer and the light of the sword howled, shaking the void and shattering countless stone pillars.

Moreover, with the moonlight enveloping him, his speed was incredibly fast. He repeatedly found openings amidst the three-pronged attack, striking the enemy's weak points.

For a time.

It was actually Li Mo who made the two men and one beast flustered and in a hurry.

"This kid is even more诡异 (strange) than before, even without his secret technique..."

"Futu, you and I..."

Yin Huaxuan's eyes were bloodshot.

He was about to fight to the death in a last-ditch effort when suddenly, he felt his internal power vanishing rapidly, and even his flood dragon scales were receding.

No, it wasn't vanishing; it was flowing rapidly toward his abdomen...

Pfft—

A hand pierced through his stomach from his back.

"Yin Hua, it's too late. Even if you kill Li Mo, you won't be able to leave anymore."

Futu's voice came, laced with a cold sneer and suppressed bloodlust.

He viciously ripped out the Beast Seed wrapped in a pill from his abdomen.

"You're alive and staying in Qingyuan Sect. How could I sleep soundly?"

Li Mo: "....."

Brilliant.

The ways of the Demonic Sect are truly like this.

They are "heartfelt" and "devoted" to their own people.
