# Chapter 698: Hearing of the Samsara Sea of Bitterness

Xu Yunfan’s gaze did not linger on the departing figure. His Divine Sense had already spread out, silently covering the entire Divine霄 Mountain and even parts of the Nine Immortal Mountains.

The Nine Immortal Mountains were the foundation of the Primordial Origin Sect. Nine towering immortal mountains floated above the vast sea of clouds, bathed in ten thousand rays of auspicious light, with spiritual energy so dense it seemed tangible.

Among them, one mountain, wreathed in thunder and purple spiritual energy, stood with magnificent palace complexes atop its peak. This was the newly established Divine霄 Mountain.

It was his current Dao Field.

Compared to when Xu Yunfan first took control of this peak fifty years ago, the current scene was worlds apart.

Spiritual mist flowed through the mountains, and spiritual birds and strange beasts could be seen faintly.

Figures of cultivators, either riding artifacts or turning into streaks of light, shuttled between mountain paths and cloud bridges, their numbers more than ten times greater than in the past.

Inner disciples practiced thunder techniques on the plaza before the Transmission Hall, the flashing lightning drawing waves of cheers.

Outer disciples toiled diligently in medicinal gardens and spiritual fields, nurturing spiritual plants.

Executive disciples bustled back and forth, handling the various complex affairs of the peak.

In the Scripture Pavilion, the sound of Dao recitation was clear and resonant. Disciples came and went in an endless stream before the Scripture Storage Tower. The fires in the artifact refining workshops and pill refinement rooms never ceased, with the roar of furnaces and the fragrance of pills drifting out day and night.

All this prosperity was due to the existence of the one at the peak's summit.

Divine霄 True Lord, Xu Yunfan.

His earth-shattering feat of attaining the Golden Core Dao, his might in resisting True Lord Qingyuan and Bodhisattva Huiri, and his glorious military achievements in attacking the Aitila World together with True Lord Dongming had long since spread throughout the Primordial Origin Sect and even the entire Taihua Ruins World.

Divine霄 Mountain, one of the nine immortal mountains of the Primordial Origin Sect, held a revered status and its attractiveness had increased dramatically.

Countless disciples came seeking refuge or hoping to become disciples of the True Lord, seeking a trace of the true transmission of the Great Dao.

Xu Yunfan’s Divine Sense swept over this increasingly prosperous scene, his heart stirred by few waves.

Having many disciples and a flourishing peak was a manifestation of strength; the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect were very practical.

However, Xu Yunfan still hoped to expand his own lineage.

He could clearly perceive that as more and more disciples cultivated the *Divine霄 Nine宸玄穹不灭真经*, his understanding of the principles of the Thunder Dao deepened.

It could be said that under the unique pyramid model of the Taihua Ruins World, the true methods cultivated by these disciples could all be turned into his nourishment.

He needed these people to handle administrative affairs, collect resources, maintain the operation of his Dao Field, and even become potential helpers or eyes and ears in the future.

His thoughts had long since left the prosperity before his eyes.

Retracting his Divine Sense, on the jade table before him, an invisible Divine Sense condensed again, outlining a shadow of a deep and silent place surging with dead, silent blood waves and the wailing of endless resentful souls, as well as a deep and ethereal Netherworld.

The Samsara Sea of Bitterness.

This was a place that every cultivator in the Taihua Ruins World spoke of.

Especially after reaching the Foundation Establishment realm, when a Foundation Establishment真人 undergoes five cycles of reincarnation, they must enter the Samsara Sea of Bitterness to be reborn.

From what he had learned of the other great worlds in the World Sea, the Taihua Ruins World was the only one with such a thing.

It was said to connect the Yin and Yang worlds, a blurred zone between life and death, with disordered time and space, strange laws, filled with spiritual light-dissolving mist, soul-corroding Yin winds, and various terrifying existences condensed from the resentment and deathly aura accumulated over endless years.

There were even rumors that a Golden Core True Lord had ventured deep into it, only to end up never returning, his true soul forever falling into the Sea of Bitterness, unable to be liberated.

Xu Yunfan did not believe this entirely.

But it undoubtedly showed that the Samsara Sea of Bitterness was extremely dangerous.

Yet he had an unavoidable reason to go.

It contained the essential item for Xu Yunfan's Dao Path to advance further.

The Taihuang Mingqiu Dao Fruit.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the growth rate of his Dao Rank on his attribute panel.

It took almost a year to increase by 2 points of Dao Rank.

Accustomed to his extremely fast cultivation speed, he now found it unbearable to face such a snail's pace.

If not for the need to keep a low profile over the past few years to let the gazes constantly gathered on him quiet down, he would have already started his next move.

To be honest, if he had rashly left the Primordial Origin Sect back then, he might have been surrounded and attacked the next moment.

"The Thunder and Fire Duo have been formed, the Yang extreme is already strong, the Yin extreme cannot be lacking for long," Xu Yunfan calculated in his heart, his gaze profound.

"The Taihuang Mingqiu Dao Fruit contains the essence of extreme Yin and extreme cold, the wonder of life and death reincarnation. It can perfectly complement my Divine霄 supreme Yang Thunder, forming the final cornerstone for constructing a small celestial cycle."

This was his extremely clear understanding of his own Dao Path after fifty years of closed-door cultivation refining the Chiyang Dao Fruit.

Refining the Chiyang Dao Fruit allowed the mutual generation of Thunder and Fire, its power skyrocketing, his Dao Rank surging, already touching the limits of the early Golden Core stage.

But this power was extreme Yang and extreme Yang; it urgently needed extreme Yin power to harmonize it.

If he did not have the Taihuang Mingqiu Dao Fruit to harmonize Yin and Yang and form a cycle, it would be difficult to truly step into the mid Golden Core stage. Moreover, over time, the excessively violent Thunder and Fire power might even counterattack his own body, causing his Golden Core to become unstable and his Small World to be on the verge of shattering.

"Once I obtain and successfully refine this Dao Fruit, Yin and Yang will blend, the three fruits will circulate, and once the small celestial cycle is formed, I can naturally lift my Small World, entrust it to the Void, and step into the mid Golden Core realm."

But the Samsara Sea of Bitterness was certainly not a benevolent place.

Its danger far surpassed that of ordinary secret realms.

The dangers within were unpredictable. Records from predecessors were incomplete, and often, many entered but few returned, with the information brought out being fragmented.

Only those old True Lords who have lived for tens of thousands of years probably know exactly what is inside.

The incomplete records from predecessors' explorations were pieced together from the fragmented words of countless fallen or fortuitously escaped cultivators.

Some mentioned blood waves eroding bones and the wailing of all living things; some recorded时空 vortexes and disorientation; some warned of the proliferation of inner demons and the emergence of illusions; and some even mentioned that deep in the Sea of Bitterness dwells a Bitterness Sea Qiu Dragon condensed from ancient resentment, ferocious to the extreme, suspected to be associated with or born alongside the Taihuang Mingqiu Dao Fruit.

But this information was fragmented and contradictory, difficult to distinguish true from false.

Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment, considering whether to prepare to pay a visit to True Lord Pudu, this super expert of the mid Golden Core stage of the Primordial Origin Sect, who was definitely no stranger to the Samsara Sea of Bitterness.

The only thing that troubled him was that he didn't know what demands the other party would make. After all, according to the tradition of the Primordial Origin Sect, if you want to get something, you must be prepared to lose something.

Xu Yunfan pondered slightly and temporarily gave up the idea of seeing True Lord Pudu. Instead, he summoned Lu Chuan and Chu Chengnan to inquire about the Samsara Sea of Bitterness.

Seven days passed in the blink of an eye.

His Divine Sense moved slightly, and two sound-transmitting talismans turned into streams of light and flew out of the hall.

After a moment, Chu Chengnan and Lu Chuan entered the hall one after the other, bowing.

"Greetings, Divine霄 True Lord!" the two said in unison.

Xu Yunfan raised his hand to indicate they should rise, then got straight to the point.

"This Lord intends to make a trip to the Samsara Sea of Bitterness and needs to know the key points. You two have both experienced five cycles of reincarnation and should have some insight."

Hearing this, Lu Chuan and Chu Chengnan subconsciously exchanged a glance, both seeing the envy in the other's eyes.

To achieve the Golden Core position in a single lifetime, no matter where you are, is a peerless talent.

Lu Chuan spoke first, his expression respectful but with hidden deliberation.
