# Chapter 175: Secrets of the Upper Realm

Lin Shan and the others were deeply shaken. They had originally thought that among the three Black Lotus Sect's Nascent Soul Dharma Kings who had launched the expedition against the Great Song Dynasty, only the Precepts Dharma King had managed to escape alone after the battle at the Purple Firmament Sect, while the other two had long perished.

Yet, unexpectedly, the Guardian Dharma King had not died. Instead, he had secretly performed a Nascent Soul possession on a Purple Firmament Sect disciple, lurking under the noses of the righteous path for several years.

Indeed, few Nascent Soul old monsters could be considered easy opponents!

However, caught in the overwhelming tide of events, the Guardian Dharma King was clearly powerless to alter the balance between the righteous and demonic factions. He could only continue to hide and bide his time.

Later, when the righteous army broke through the Falling Pine Mountains and advanced into the eastern regions of the Great Song Dynasty, he seized the opportunity to escape with his new body, planning to return to the Eastern Sea to reconsider his options.

But even then, he had underestimated the Purple Firmament Sect's methods. After all, he had possessed the sect's genius true disciple, "Thunder Silver," a future Nascent Soul seed who had countless eyes watching his original body.

The moment he attempted to flee, his flaws were exposed. Soon after, the three Nascent Soul elders of the Purple Firmament Sect joined forces to pursue him.

Thus, the current scene unfolded.

By now, the four had been engaged in fierce combat for a long time. The evening's fiery sunset clouds, originally painting the sky red, were shattered into cotton-like fragments by the immense magical power. Thunderous dragons roared incessantly, their heads and tails flickering in and out of the mist.

Amidst the sky, a dense black mist enveloped a crimson-robed young man. With one hand behind his back and the other waving freely, he seemed to be painting an ink landscape in the air.

Streams of black sand-like energy cascaded down, transforming into black palm strikes, black weapons, black jade seals, and black inkstones—seventy-two transformations executed with effortless grace.

No matter what magical treasures or techniques the three Purple Firmament Sect elders employed, he could precisely identify their flaws and counter them with ease. His profound mastery was awe-inspiring.

The Guardian Dharma King had always been the Black Lotus Sect's pillar. Were it not for his lack of confidence in overcoming the heavenly tribulation, he might have already attempted to break through to a higher realm.

Even now, having possessed a new body for only a few years and not yet fully recovered to his peak, he could still hold his own against three Nascent Soul cultivators of the same realm. His terrifying strength was a testament to his status as a demonic path titan.

However, the three Purple Firmament Sect elders were now thoroughly enraged. Their sect had already suffered immensely during the demonic factions' invasion. Not only had half of their thirty-six lineages been lost, but all their spiritual veins had been drained by the "Golden Edict of the Alchemical Scripture," depleting millennia of accumulated resources. The sect had fallen from its leading position among the three righteous sects to the bottom.

At this critical juncture, when the sect was already weakened and struggling, their future hope—the Nascent Soul seed—had been possessed by a demonic path true monarch. It was like a dagger to their hearts!

It must be noted that the Purple Firmament Sect had only two publicly known Nascent Soul seeds!

Of course, there was also that somewhat "eccentric" Lin kid in the shadows. To prevent him from courting death prematurely, they had deliberately suppressed him to keep him out of the limelight.

Yet, even so, the losses were devastating.

On the other hand, who was the Black Lotus Sect's Guardian Dharma King?

He was a top-tier combatant at the late Nascent Soul stage, standing at the pinnacle of this world's food chain, capable of dominating the cultivation world and influencing the tides of fate. The once-in-a-millennium demonic calamity in the Great Song Dynasty had relied on such figures for support. Under normal circumstances, it would be nearly impossible for him to die unless he acted recklessly.

Had it not been for the "Golden Edict of the Alchemical Scripture" left by their founding ancestor, which consumed vast spiritual veins to summon the heavenly tribulation, how could they have forced him to abandon his body and flee as a Nascent Soul?

Now that they had finally severely wounded this demon, how could they allow him to escape after possessing a genius disciple? Wouldn't that be releasing a tiger back into the mountains? How could they let him leave the Great Song so easily?

Such a formidable enemy must never be allowed to rise again!

Initially, the three Purple Firmament Sect elders had held back, hoping to capture him and eliminate the possessing Nascent Soul. If they could use the sect's life tablet to recall "Thunder Silver's" soul, they might salvage a future Nascent Soul seed.

But now, it was clear that the Guardian Dharma King was no ordinary foe. Without unleashing their full power, they stood no chance against him.

After a brief telepathic discussion, the three elders reached a unanimous decision.

Kill him!

Since they couldn't save the genius, they would eliminate this great enemy once and for all!

Without hesitation, the three stood back-to-back and began chanting incantations. In an instant, a dazzling circular array appeared beneath their feet. Dark clouds gathered overhead, thunder rumbled, and the surrounding weather underwent a drastic change.

Within moments, a torrential downpour engulfed the area for dozens of miles.

"Boom! Crack!"

"Whoosh—"

The endless curtain of rain connected heaven and earth, obscuring all vision. The three elders vanished from sight.

The Guardian Dharma King, experienced and knowledgeable, recognized this large-scale weather manipulation as a sect-suppressing technique!

Moreover, with three Nascent Soul cultivators of the same cultivation and aligned techniques combining their power, the resulting force would be earth-shattering, aimed at annihilating him in one strike.

Lin Shan and the others, observing from a distance of a hundred miles, crouched low, not daring to flee further. The sky, previously clear, was now filled with lightning and torrential rain.

Such a large-scale alteration of weather was beyond their ability to withstand. A single misstep could reduce them to ashes.

They couldn't help but worry for the Guardian Dharma King. In his current possessed body, could he truly withstand the combined sect-suppressing technique of three Purple Firmament Sect elders?

Lin Shan glanced at the Skeletal Demon Monarch, trusting its keen eyes to discern the situation.

The Skeletal Demon Monarch spoke with rare gravity, explaining to the group, "He can't withstand it. Your demonic sect's Nascent Soul expert is merely putting on a strong front. What seemed effortless earlier was actually him overdrawing the body's potential.

"Moreover, the three Purple Firmament Sect elders share the same Daoist lineage. Their combined technique isn't simply additive—its power far surpasses the norm. Even a true late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator would struggle against it!"

Lin Shan inhaled sharply. He trusted the Skeletal Demon Monarch's judgment implicitly. Though sometimes unreliable, its insights were invariably accurate.

It seemed the Guardian Dharma King was truly in grave danger.

Meanwhile, in the distant sky, a silver waterfall descended from the heavens, its roaring waves deafening.

"Nine Heavens Thunderfall!"

Three resonant voices shouted in unison as the Guardian Dharma King let out a cry of disbelief. The silver waterfall, like a celestial river, stretched for dozens of miles, mighty and unyielding.

In an instant, the clouds parted, the rain ceased, and a rainbow emerged.

The torrential downpour vanished abruptly, revealing the mountain ranges on the horizon. The setting sun hung halfway above the silver river, casting golden light upon its surface.

"The green hills remain, bathed in the setting sun's glow."

It seemed to herald the end of the Guardian Dharma King's illustrious life, his once-glorious days now fading like the setting sun, destined to become a mere legend.

The possessed crimson-robed youth struggled desperately, unleashing every technique and treasure at his disposal, but to no avail.

The Nine Heavens Thunderfall, carrying the might of heaven, surged forward unstoppably, crushing everything in its path. No one could stand against it.

Watching the celestial river surge and the sun slowly set, the three purple-robed elders stood tall, their righteous aura unyielding, embodying the principle that justice would always prevail.

The demonic path onlookers trembled in fear, not daring to make a sound as they watched the tiny, struggling figure in the distance.

"Don't waste your energy," one elder laughed. "At your peak, we might have retreated and summoned our grand elder. But now, possessing only a Golden Core cultivator's body, how long can you last even by burning your potential?"

The figure in the river of divine power roared with indignation. "If I had fully recovered, you three wouldn't stand a chance! Bullying me with numbers is no feat—fight me one-on-one if you dare!"

The three elders remained unruffled, unaffected by his taunts. They were far too experienced to fall for such provocations. Against a dragon, even one stranded in shallow waters, they would use their full strength.

Seeing his words had no effect, the Guardian Dharma King finally erupted. It seemed he still had an ace up his sleeve.

"Fine! You leave me no choice! As the Black Lotus Sect's foremost Dharma King, I carry the sect's lifeblood. If I must die, I'll use it all to take you with me!"

Unexpectedly, the three elders had been waiting for this. They laughed heartily, their words shocking all who heard.

"Dharma King, you speak of the power of faith! Even if you don't use it now, we'll destroy it once we seize it. Such poison to the people's minds should never exist!"

"The immortal sects of the upper realm and the Western Buddha Lands long ago decreed that no one may privately collect faith power. Violators are to be eradicated!"

"Your Black Lotus Sect has secretly gathered faith in the Great Song for centuries. We turned a blind eye initially, as our strength was comparable. But your greed knew no bounds—you began openly deluding the masses, alerting the upper realm's inspectors!"

"Our founding ancestor, enraged, ordered us to eradicate you. You brought this upon yourselves!"

Their words struck like a barrage, aimed at unsettling the Guardian Dharma King's mind and disrupting his resistance.

But to Lin Shan, listening from afar, the revelations were staggering.

Immortal sects! The Western Buddha Lands! They had jointly forbidden the collection of faith power across all realms!

This explained why the Black Lotus Sect had been annihilated a millennium ago. The righteous path, backed by the upper realm, had seized the chance to crush the demonic factions.

The surviving demonic sects had fled, only to return centuries later, only to fail once more.

Lin Shan realized why collecting "ancient resonance" had been so difficult—the upper realm's powers actively suppressed faith-based practices to protect mortal minds from corruption.

Even the Buddhist sects, though tolerated, were confined to the fringes, forbidden from forced indoctrination.

The Guardian Dharma King, now on the verge of defeat, let out a final, desperate cry.

"Since I cannot deliver the faith gathered over millennia to our revered master, I shall expend it all in one final act!"

"Master above, your unworthy disciple beseeches your avatar to descend!"

Golden flames erupted from his body, countless faces flickering within. A golden gate appeared in the sky, effortlessly repelling the thunderous river.

A single, majestic foot stepped through the gate.
