# Chapter 136: Invitation

"It's still easier for an Intermediate Formation Master to earn Contribution Points!" Li Shiming exclaimed after completing the inspection task.

When he was a Spirit Planter, he only earned a few hundred Contribution Points per season, and that was considered a high-earning profession among the sect disciples.

But compared to an Intermediate Formation Master, there was simply no comparison.

Just for the inspection task, he and Yin Shilan split the Contribution Points, each receiving five hundred.

Of course, not every cultivator could do this kind of work, and even among Intermediate Formation Masters, very few could take on such tasks.

Furthermore, both he and Yin Shilan possessed Spiritual Sense, allowing them to complete the task quickly. Normally, it would take two Intermediate Formation Masters four or five days to complete the same amount of work.

"What are you planning to exchange your Contribution Points for?" Yin Shilan asked with a gentle smile, her bright eyes fixed on Li Shiming.

"Of course, I'm exchanging them for Foundation Establishment Pills!" Li Shiming replied without hesitation.

This was the accumulation that most sect cultivators were doing, the Foundation Establishment Pills distributed every five years being the hope of all sect cultivators.

"Actually, if you become an Advanced Formation Master, the sect will provide you with at least four Foundation Establishment Pills!" Yin Shilan, who knew more than him, pointed out the direction he needed to strive towards.

Li Shiming's eyes widened, this was the first time he had heard this news.

If he knew how many Advanced Formation Masters the sect had, he would understand how much importance the sect placed on them.

In the vast Sky Sea Sect, there were only three Advanced Formation Masters, while the areas that needed their maintenance were numerous.

And a sect's grand formation must have one Advanced Formation Master available to deal with sudden unexpected situations, which is why there is normally an Advanced Formation Master stationed in the Spirit Mechanism Pavilion of Dui Peak.

In other words, the Sky Sea Sect currently only had two Advanced Formation Masters maintaining the massive formation.

Like the node flag he saw earlier, only an Advanced Formation Master could repair it.

"I will become an Advanced Formation Master!" Li Shiming clenched his fist tightly, he had to get those four Foundation Establishment Pills.

Yin Shilan also made a decision in her heart, but she didn't tell him.

Yin Shilan was a Heavenly Spiritual Root, so at most one Foundation Establishment Pill would be enough as a guarantee. She had already accumulated enough Contribution Points to exchange for one.

She knew that Li Shiming was a Three Spiritual Root, so he needed as many Foundation Establishment Pills as possible to ensure his advancement to Foundation Establishment.

"Huh!" Li Shiming took out his identity jade disc, wondering why Yun Ze was contacting him at this time.

Logically speaking, he and Yun Ze, and the Yun Clan Merchant Guild, had already broken ties, so why would Yun Ze want to contact him?

"What's wrong?" Yin Shilan asked with concern.

"It's a message from Yun Ze!" Li Shiming replied while checking the information in the identity jade disc.

Yin Shilan was also curious. If there was anyone in the sect who knew Li Shiming best, it was her. She and Li Shiming would contact each other at noon whenever they had time.

Besides exchanging formation insights, they would also talk about miscellaneous matters.

Yin Shilan didn't have the idea of interfering in what Li Shiming did, this was the experience her mother had told her.

Yun Ze, as a friend, invited Li Shiming to meet.

Yun Ze was very clever, he didn't say anything else, but made the invitation based on their previous friendship, which he was sure would appeal to Li Shiming's personality.

At the same time, the place he invited him to was Gen Peak, which was theoretically extremely safe.

"Yun Ze wants to meet me, you go and hand in the task first!" Li Shiming considered it and agreed, instructing Yin Shilan.

"Contact me if anything happens, be careful!" Yin Shilan nodded in agreement.

She took to the air and left gracefully.

Li Shiming arrived at Gen Peak, at a courtyard at the foot of the mountain, which was where Yun Ze had arranged to meet.

His eyes flickered, this courtyard was a rare cave dwelling style in the Nine Peaks, most cultivators preferred to build their cave dwellings on the mountainside.

The main reason cultivators liked cave dwellings was that they were more hidden and secure. The mountainside protected by formations could isolate the prying eyes of other cultivators, and also minimize the spiritual energy fluctuations within the cave dwelling.

In addition, the formations arranged within the cave dwelling made it very secure and private.

A courtyard-style cave dwelling was more for the convenience of tending to spiritual plants, and normal cultivators rarely chose this less private type of cave dwelling.

It was obvious that Yun Ze chose this place to put Li Shiming at ease.

But the more it was like this, the more uneasy Li Shiming felt.

However, judging from the formation in the courtyard, it was just an ordinary defensive formation that could isolate the internal spiritual energy fluctuations, but it was also easy to break.

He had many backup plans, so he didn't think too much about it.

"Junior Brother Li is here, please come in!" Yun Ze still had a sincere smile on his face, and said enthusiastically when he saw Li Shiming.

He didn't seem to be affected by the 'Thousand Miles Vision Second Generation' incident, but the more Li Shiming looked at him, the more he felt something was wrong.

Li Shiming's Spiritual Sense pressed on something at his waist, activating its function. It was an ordinary-looking 'Thousand Miles Vision'.

"Senior Brother Yun is living comfortably in the sect!" Li Shiming said, looking at the situation in the courtyard, with a hint of sarcasm and envy.

There were four maids standing in the courtyard. The four maids had no spiritual energy fluctuations in their bodies, but they were real maids.

But under Li Shiming's observation, he could clearly sense the flow of blood in the four maids' bodies. That kind of surging blood flow was not something ordinary maids could have.

Having achieved some success in body refinement, he immediately judged that these four maids were all practicing body refinement techniques.

Four maids with spiritual roots, instead of practicing spiritual energy techniques, were practicing the more difficult body refinement techniques, which was putting the cart before the horse.

Even if the four maids' spiritual roots were poor, once they formed a spiritual energy vortex by practicing spiritual energy techniques, their lifespan would be longer.

The consequence of not practicing spiritual energy techniques and forcibly practicing body refinement techniques was that their lifespan would be shorter. Without spiritual energy to strengthen their bodies, forcibly practicing body refinement techniques would result in overdrafting their lives.

Li Shiming could also analyze that the body refinement techniques practiced by the four maids were very poor, which was related to his vision.

He himself practiced the 'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art' and the 'Sword Demon Secret Canon', each of which was the most top-level body refinement technique.

"Junior Brother is joking, I have prepared good tea, no less than the spiritual tea you treated me with back then!" Yun Ze said with an unchanged expression, pointing to the stone table next to him.

On the stone table, there was a jade pot and two jade cups, with the fragrance of spiritual tea overflowing from the jade pot.

Li Shiming's Spiritual Sense swept through the courtyard, and apart from the four maids, he didn't sense anything unusual.

Li Shiming sat down on the stone stool opposite Yun Ze, wanting to see what Yun Ze was up to.

In this kind of private conversation, even if there was something, there shouldn't be four irrelevant maids present.

A maid came over and poured him a cup of spiritual tea.

"What pure Spirit Suppression Powder, if the quality of this spiritual tea was a bit higher, it would really be impossible to detect!" Li Shiming said lightly, without even touching the jade cup, he discovered the problem with the spiritual tea.

With his five senses and Spiritual Sense fully open, IBMz15 was constantly analyzing the situation around him, and he discovered the existence of Spirit Suppression Powder in the first instance.

Spirit Suppression Powder, a drug that could suppress the spiritual energy in a cultivator's body, was usually used to imprison cultivator prisoners.

"Junior Brother has good eyes, why be an enemy of the Yun Clan Merchant Guild, otherwise we could really be friends!" Yun Ze said with a seemingly helpless expression, not annoyed by the discovery of the poison.

Seeing Yun Ze's expression, Li Shiming couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart. In the current situation, Yun Ze must have a one hundred percent certainty of keeping him here, otherwise the matter of poisoning a fellow disciple would be enough for Yun Ze to enter the sect's prison.

"The Yun Clan is really good, I bought five thousand spiritual stones worth of goods, and you charged me eight thousand spiritual stones, and you refused to accept orders that earned less spiritual stones. I'm curious, what force gave the Yun Clan such benefits to make the Yun Clan do this?" Li Shiming was really curious, he wanted to get the truth out of Yun Ze.

"I know what you're thinking when you ask this question. Before you die, I'll tell you the truth. The Holy Ice Sect wants your head, and the price they offered is too high, so high that the merchant guild can't refuse. Originally, if you hadn't taken the initiative to break ties with the merchant guild, things could have been delayed for a while!" Yun Ze shook his head regretfully.

In his eyes, Li Shiming was a dead man. Since he had interacted with Li Shiming, he would let Li Shiming die knowing the truth, which would be considered an end to their previous friendship.

"Holy Ice Sect!" Li Shiming understood. He thought that Elder Bai Li's closed-door cultivation meant that the Holy Ice Sect was no longer a threat.

It seemed that Elder Bai Li didn't even want to let him go during his closed-door cultivation. The Holy Ice Sect had already started taking action, and he was still unaware.

He considered whether to find an agent in the Holy Ice Sect to develop the 'Thousand Miles Vision Second Generation' there, so that he could monitor the Holy Ice Sect himself.

"Now that I've said everything, I'll send Junior Brother Li on his way!" Yun Ze poured the spiritual tea in the jade cup on the ground, and said coldly.

At the same time, Li Shiming felt formation fluctuations coming from under the stone table, followed by a strange fluctuation spreading outward from under the stone table.

He was about to use his spiritual energy, but found that he couldn't mobilize it at all.

He couldn't even open his storage bag. Within the range of that strange fluctuation, the spiritual energy in the void seemed to have disappeared.

Yun Ze had expected this, and he didn't even move. Although he had lost his spiritual energy, he was still at the late stage of Qi Refining, but he had lost all his combat power.

He saw the look of doubt and panic on Li Shiming's face, and his smile couldn't help but become arrogant with the control of life and death.

The four maids simultaneously took out short swords from their waists. The short swords were all of the top-grade magic weapon level. Since there was no need to consider injecting spiritual energy, the short swords had no additional enchantments, just a top-grade magic weapon blank.

But a top-grade magic weapon blank was most suitable in this spirit-suppressing environment. On the contrary, magic weapons with enchantments would be affected by the spirit suppression.

The four seemingly weak maids, when holding the short swords, had blood energy in their bodies like a rushing river. This was body refinement reaching a small success.

"Kill!" The four maids shouted in unison, their figures like dancing, but containing a fierce killing intent.

The four short swords turned into four swimming dragons, sealing off Li Shiming's surroundings.

This was a secular close-quarters sword technique, which very few cultivators in the cultivation world would be involved in, mainly because there were too few opportunities to use it.

Yun Ze's smile grew wider and wider. This trouble was finally going to be resolved.

Don't underestimate the arrangement here. This was the Yun Clan Merchant Guild's strongest method for dealing with cultivators. The four maids, in coordination with a special formation, had even dealt with cultivators at the peak of Qi Refining.

The four maids were assassins who had been trained since childhood, practicing body refinement techniques and swordsmanship.

In an environment where spiritual energy was imprisoned, they were more effective than Qi Refining cultivators.

As Yun Ze imagined, the four short swords pierced Li Shiming's four vital points.

Unfortunately, what was different from Yun Ze's imagination was that the four short swords only pierced the skin and could not go any deeper.

If it was the heart, lower back, and other vital points, that would be fine, perhaps Li Shiming had a defensive armor inside.

But the sword that pierced Li Shiming's forehead clearly showed the horror of his body.

'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art', still had the blessing of the Vajra Force monk relic given by the old monk Du Yuan, allowing his 'Vajra Body Protection Divine Art' to reach the extreme of his current realm.

'Sword Demon Secret Canon', used three-grade metal as the sword base. This kind of cost-no-objectives strengthening, unless with the full support of a Golden Core elder, would not have the opportunity to practice.

And for a Golden Core elder to pay out three-grade metal, even a direct disciple would not make such a big sacrifice.

Three-grade metal was the material for Golden Core elders to refine magic treasures, and magic treasures were the foundation of the Golden Core elders' strength.

Two top-level body refinement techniques practiced at the same time, even Bai Li Jinyan had not done it.

Li Shiming slowly stood up, he looked at Yun Ze indifferently, and then showed his grim teeth, like a bloodthirsty beast awakening.

The four maids quickly changed their moves, and the short swords stabbed at him again. Assassins who were trained as death soldiers would not give up because of a single failure.

Either the target died, or they died.

Li Shiming, purely in terms of physique, was much stronger than them, and close combat was pure skill. 'Sword Demon Secret Canon' was even more superior to secular close combat moves.

Because 'Sword Demon Secret Canon' was still shallow in practice, he could not summon the three-grade sword base to fight, but his hands surpassed ordinary middle-grade magic weapons.

Different from the top-grade sword blanks in the maids' hands, the power of his hands was based on the standard of ordinary middle-grade magic weapons, and in terms of sharpness, it surpassed the top-grade sword blanks without any enchantments.

His figure was like a ghost, his fingers turned into swords and slashed across the necks of the four maids. The four maids fell down with confused eyes.

"So your body refinement technique has reached this level!" Yun Ze looked at Li Shiming in horror.

It should be known that the four maids were not like cultivators, who also needed to practice other techniques. They only focused on body refinement techniques and swordsmanship. In theory, cultivators without spiritual energy could not resist their attacks at all.

But everything in front of him made Yun Ze appreciate the power of Li Shiming's body refinement technique.

The four maids had been practicing body refinement techniques for much longer than Li Shiming. What kind of gap could allow the four maids to have no resistance in Li Shiming's hands?
