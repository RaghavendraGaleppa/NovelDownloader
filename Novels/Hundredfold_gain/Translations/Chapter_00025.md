# Chapter 25: A Hundred Spirit Stones and a Top-Grade Magical Artifact  

After a brief conversation, Second Elder Qi Baicang finally accepted that his junior had suddenly become a true cultivation prodigy. That evening, he personally prepared a table full of spirit food, and the two celebrated heartily.  

Later, Qi Chuan returned to his room. After settling down, he cultivated for a few hours before lying down for a good night's sleep.  

The next day, he woke up rather late. As Qi Chuan stepped out of his room and was about to head to the spirit fields to tend to his work, he spotted a flying carpet approaching his secluded mountain peak, with a figure standing atop it.  

"Someone's coming?"  

Qi Chuan was curious, unsure whether the visitor was here for him or Second Elder.  

Under his watchful gaze, the flying carpet landed on an open area nearby, and a figure stepped off.  

The figure appeared to be an ordinary elder, smiling gently at Qi Chuan.  

However, Qi Chuan tensed slightly upon seeing him. He had spotted this elder multiple times in the clan's assembly hall, always seated beside Patriarch Qi Wuyou, in the center of the elder ranks. This was none other than the Qi Clan's Grand Elder!  

Within the Qi Clan, aside from the Foundation Establishment Patriarch and the late Qi Refinement stage elders, there was also a Grand Elder.  

Rumors said this Grand Elder had already reached the tenth level of Qi Refinement—the pinnacle of the Qi Refinement stage. However, he remained low-key, assisting the Patriarch with clan affairs.  

"Qi Chuan pays his respects to the Grand Elder!"  

Immediately, Qi Chuan stepped forward and bowed.  

At this moment, Second Elder, hearing the commotion, also emerged. Startled to see the Grand Elder, he quickly approached and bowed as well.  

"Hmm..."  

The Grand Elder nodded slightly before turning his gaze to Qi Chuan with a smile. "I've come today for no other reason than to deliver a reward from the clan."  

"A clan reward?"  

Qi Chuan and Second Elder exchanged glances, both surprised. They had never heard of any reward.  

"Indeed. Qi Chuan, you secured the inner disciple quota allocated to our clan by the Moon Breeze Sect. Once you enter the sect to cultivate and compete with its geniuses, our Qi Clan naturally cannot send you empty-handed," the Grand Elder said with a smile.  

Then, he patted an unremarkable storage pouch at his waist, and a dull-gray dagger and an embroidered pouch floated in midair.  

"This is a top-grade magical artifact and one hundred low-grade spirit stones—a gift from the clan."  

With a flick of his sleeve, the gray dagger and embroidered pouch drifted toward Qi Chuan.  

Staring at the items before him, Qi Chuan's eyes sparkled with delight.  

He hadn't expected that securing the inner disciple quota would earn him a reward from the clan—and such a generous one at that.  

He was finally about to own his first magical artifact—a top-grade one at that!  

As for the hundred low-grade spirit stones, if he had relied solely on his previous stipend as an early Qi Refinement cultivator—two spirit stones per year—how many years would it have taken to save up this much? Of course, now that he had reached the fourth level of Qi Refinement (mid-stage), his annual stipend had doubled to four spirit stones.  

"Thank you, Grand Elder!"  

Qi Chuan cupped his hands in gratitude before accepting the artifact and spirit stones.  

Second Elder, witnessing this, was overjoyed for Qi Chuan, though a trace of wistfulness flickered in his eyes.  

He also owned a magical artifact, but it was merely a low-grade one. As for a hundred spirit stones, he had never possessed such wealth before.  

His junior now suddenly had ample resources. When he entered the Moon Breeze Sect, he wouldn't be at a disadvantage—he would have a solid foundation.  

"There's one more thing."  

After presenting the reward, the Grand Elder looked at Qi Chuan seriously. "Once you enter the Moon Breeze Sect, you will cultivate as an inner disciple. However, above inner disciples, there are also core disciples."  

"Becoming a core disciple grants you the opportunity to obtain Foundation Establishment Pills, greatly increasing your chances of a successful breakthrough. Therefore, after joining the inner sect, you must strive to cultivate diligently. If possible, aim for core disciple status."  

"If you cannot become a core disciple, you can also keep an eye out for any news of Foundation Establishment treasures within the inner sect. If you find any, inform the clan."  

Qi Chuan nodded. "Understood, Grand Elder. I will remember."  

Since there was a higher status above inner disciples, he would naturally strive for it if given the chance—especially since core disciples might have access to Foundation Establishment Pills. Successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment would double his lifespan, allowing him to live over two hundred years.  

As for Foundation Establishment treasures, they were likely inferior substitutes for those who couldn't obtain the pills.  

After exchanging a few more words with Qi Chuan, the Grand Elder soon departed on his flying carpet.  

Watching the flying carpet disappear into the distance, both Qi Chuan and Qi Baicang couldn't help but feel a sense of longing. That flying carpet was a flying-type magical artifact—far more valuable than ordinary ones.  

"There are still two months before the Moon Breeze Sect's disciple recruitment begins. By then, I'll be heading there. I can use these two months to familiarize myself with this dagger artifact."  

Qi Chuan stroked the dull-gray dagger in his hand, deep in thought.  

This was a top-grade magical artifact—quite precious. Generally, even late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators might not own one if they were poor, having to make do with mid-grade artifacts instead.  

Top-grade artifacts were exceptionally powerful.  

"However, the Grand Elder didn't mention the name of this artifact. In that case, I'll name it myself. Let's call it... *Flying Ash*!"  

"After all, this is my first magical artifact—it deserves a meaningful name. *Flying Ash* symbolizes that all future enemies shall be reduced to ashes."  

To wield a magical artifact, one needed to master the Art of Object Control.  

At present, Qi Chuan only knew basic elemental spells and hadn't learned the Art of Object Control. Thus, he needed to visit the clan's exchange hall to acquire it.  

The next day, Qi Chuan arrived at the exchange hall and once again met the elder in charge.  

"What would you like to exchange for this time?"  

The elder smiled at Qi Chuan—a stark contrast to his previous indifference. Now, Qi Chuan could be considered one of the Qi Clan's potential Foundation Establishment seeds, warranting some preferential treatment.  

"I'd like to exchange for the Art of Object Control," Qi Chuan said directly.  

"The Art of Object Control? Planning to learn how to wield a magical artifact?" The elder smiled knowingly, clearly aware that the clan had rewarded Qi Chuan with an artifact.  

"Exactly," Qi Chuan confirmed.  

"In that case, I recommend you exchange for the *Compendium of Qi Refinement Spells* compiled by the clan. It contains many commonly used spells—not just the Art of Object Control, but also Mind Calming, Wind Control, Spirit Eye, Frostbite, Quicksand, Levitation, Voice Transmission, and Invisibility. All very practical," the elder suggested after a moment's thought.  

"Is that so? Alright, I'll take the *Compendium of Qi Refinement Spells*," Qi Chuan agreed.  

At present, his Fireball and Water Arrow spells had already reached the Great Mastery stage, while Golden Skin, Earth Wall, and Wood Vine were nearing it.  

Once spells reached Great Mastery, breaking through to Perfection required extensive time and effort—not something achievable in the short term.  

Thus, it was better to learn other spells.  

After all, a proper cultivator needed to master these commonly used techniques, as they had countless applications in daily life.  

The *Compendium of Qi Refinement Spells* cost ten low-grade spirit stones.  

After handing over the stones, the elder quickly retrieved the compendium for Qi Chuan.  

Flipping through the moderately thick manual, Qi Chuan nodded slightly before tucking it away without further thought.  

Then, after a brief pause, he added, "By the way, Elder, I'd also like three Spirit Tempering Pills."  

His supply of cultivation-aiding pills had run out, and it was time to replenish them.  

Spirit Tempering Pills were a type of pill he had seen on the exchange list before—suitable for mid-to-late Qi Refinement stages and quite effective.  

However, they were also expensive, costing five low-grade spirit stones per pill.  

Now that he had just received a hundred spirit stones, he could afford them.  

The reason he only exchanged for three was that Qi Chuan suspected he might encounter better pills once he entered the Moon Breeze Sect's inner sect.  

With only two months left before his departure, these three pills would serve as a temporary measure. Afterward, he planned to seek superior cultivation aids within the inner sect.
