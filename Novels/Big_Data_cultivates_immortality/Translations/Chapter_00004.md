# Chapter 4: Sister Hong from the Streets  

Feng Jun was startled by the deafening explosion and the shower of sparks. He instinctively took two steps back. Hearing the shouts outside, he glanced at the charred remains of the charger before turning away as if nothing had happened.  

Once in the restroom, he examined his phone. The surface appeared unharmed, though a half-centimeter length of burnt charging cable still clung to the port. His left hand, however, was blackened by the electric arc, a sight that unsettled him.  

After washing his hands thoroughly with soap twice to remove the marks, he casually strolled back to the gym's main hall with his phone in hand.  

The hall was empty—everyone had crowded near the entrance to gawk at the commotion. The city's power transformer, located less than a hundred meters from the Hongjie Club's entrance, was now billowing thick black smoke.  

"Talk about bad luck," receptionist Xiao Li remarked, sipping from a bag of soy milk as she pointed at the transformer. "A lightning strike fried one yesterday, they replaced it overnight, and now this!"  

"Probably a faulty connection," chubby Zhao Hongqi chimed in, playing the expert. "Otherwise, why would it blow up in the morning when it's not even peak hours?"  

Xiao Li rolled her eyes. "Or maybe it's just counterfeit crap. What *can't* the power bureau screw up?"  

"Hey, what the hell are you two talking about?" A loud voice interrupted. A man in a blue uniform—standard attire for power company workers—stormed over, the words "Power Supply" embroidered in bold red on his chest.  

The "blue elf" was furious at their baseless accusations. His team had worked through the night to replace the transformer after yesterday’s storm damaged multiple power facilities. Exhausted and sleep-deprived, he wasn’t about to tolerate slander about their professionalism. "Maybe your club just overloaded the damn grid!"  

Zhao Hongqi scoffed. "Our club has its own circuit breaker. If it was our fault, *we'd* have tripped first. Don’t you know the basics?"  

Feng Jun stood nearby, listening to the argument while checking his phone. He noticed the battery level remained at twelve percent—unchanged.  

*Maybe I used a fake charger*, he mused. But then his gaze fell on his wrist, and he froze. The faint bluish imprint of the stone ring had darkened slightly.  

---  

*Could the transformer have exploded because my body absorbed a massive surge of electricity?*  

It was just a guess, but charging an old flip phone alone couldn’t have caused such a catastrophe. As for why the club’s breaker hadn’t tripped while the city transformer blew, Feng Jun—a humanities graduate with limited technical knowledge—had no explanation.  

The darkened ring imprint made him itch to find a secluded spot and test entering the farm again. The urge was nearly irresistible.  

But he restrained himself, remembering the agony of his last "grass-pulling" session. Testing this during his lunch break seemed wiser.  

When noon finally arrived, Feng Jun slipped into the restroom and pulled up the farm interface. Just as he was about to tap the hand icon, a line of text floated across the screen:  

*"Sister Hong from the Streets" stole 15 patches of grass.*  

Feng Jun blinked, chuckled wryly, and decisively tapped the hand.  

Instantly, the scenery shifted, and he was back in the bizarre farm space.  

*So, to enter this space, I need to charge myself first*, he realized.  

He reached into his pants pocket, hoping to check if the cigarettes and lighter he’d stashed had made the trip. A smoke break during the grueling grass-pulling sessions would’ve been heavenly.  

But after patting himself down, he couldn’t even locate his pockets.  

Looking down, he couldn’t discern the color or style of his clothes—only that he *was* wearing something. The realization was surreal yet oddly natural.  

Sighing heavily, he muttered, "Guess I really am just data here."  

Still, considering the rarity of entering the internet as data, he couldn’t complain.  

His eyes swept over the vast field, and another sigh escaped him. "*More* grass-pulling... Next time, I’m planting just one patch."  

---  

Six hours later, Feng Jun reappeared in the restroom stall, muttering in disappointment, "No storage space... So much for that idea."  

He’d fantasized about using the farm as a storage dimension—smuggling goods like Indian generic drugs or duty-free cosmetics for profit. But reality had dashed those dreams.  

Sitting on the toilet, he consoled himself: *I’m still figuring this out. There’s bound to be more to discover.*  

As he prepared to leave, someone banged on the stall door. "You gonna live in there? Trying to shit out your intestines?"  

Feng Jun opened the door and frowned at Liu Shuming. "You hungry or something?"  

Liu, a fellow coach, froze before snarling, "You looking for a beating?"  

Feng Jun met his glare coldly. He’d had enough of Liu’s bullying. Few knew that despite Liu’s reputation, Feng Jun could easily overpower him.  

At 1.73 meters and 75 kilograms, Feng Jun wasn’t towering, but his muscular build and agility from years of sports—track, swimming, martial arts—made him formidable. Though two years of desk work had softened him, his foundation remained.  

Liu grabbed Feng Jun’s collar but faltered when he couldn’t budge him. Seeing Feng Jun’s unflinching stare, Liu backed down, muttering threats before retreating into the stall.  

Feng Jun walked away, his hunger gnawing at him. He headed straight for the staff canteen but detoured to a cheap diner instead, sensing his appetite would be monstrous again.  

Sure enough, he devoured three bowls of noodles, two plates of veggies, and five chicken legs—skipping the pricier dishes. Until he monetized his "adventure," frugality was key.  

The diner owner eyed him strangely.  

"What?" Feng Jun snapped. "You run a restaurant but hate big eaters?"  

The owner hesitated. "You don’t smell that weird stench on you?"
