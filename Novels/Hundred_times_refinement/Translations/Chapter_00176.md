# Chapter 124: The Stolen Immortal Herb (First Update, More to Come Today)

After a moment of contemplation, Lin Xuan channeled his spiritual power to cast a "Herculean Strength" spell on himself. Gripping the ancient book with both hands, he pulled with all his might.

The force he exerted was equivalent to several thousand pounds, yet the book remained completely unmoved, without even a single tear.

"This isn't paper."

"You're absolutely right, Young Sect Master. The material used to craft this book isn't ordinary paper—it's infused with Mother Profound Iron."

"Mother Profound Iron?"

Lin Xuan was visibly startled. Profound Iron was an incredibly precious material in the mortal world, capable of forging weapons sharp enough to slice through hair. Even in the cultivation world, it held significant value as a key ingredient for crafting spiritual artifacts.

While Profound Iron itself was rare, Mother Profound Iron was something one could only hope to encounter by sheer luck.

It was common knowledge that cultivators at the Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment stages could wield spiritual artifacts. But what about those at the Core Formation stage?

Spiritual artifacts were beneath their notice—they used something far more advanced called "magic treasures."

The power of magic treasures was incomparable to that of spiritual artifacts. However, with great power came great challenges. To withstand such immense energy, the materials required to craft magic treasures were exceedingly rare.

Among them was Mother Profound Iron.

Many Core Formation experts spent a century scouring the world, yet still struggled to find even a trace of it.

And here, the pages of the *Heavenly Thunder Scripture* were infused with such a priceless material.

"Are you offering this forging material to me?" Lin Xuan looked up at Lei Ao, a flicker of suspicion in his eyes. The reason was simple—Mother Profound Iron wasn't just used for crafting magic treasures. Even a small amount added to a spiritual artifact could instantly amplify its power. Even if Lei Ao wanted to make amends, this seemed excessively generous.

Aside from being somewhat opportunistic, Lei Ao was quite perceptive. Seeing Lin Xuan's expression, he quickly guessed his doubts and hurriedly explained, "Young Sect Master, please don't misunderstand. I offer this for two reasons: first, aside from this, the Thunder Sword Sect has nothing else worthy of your attention. Second, a treasure like this is beyond the fortune of someone like me."

"Oh? How so?"

Lei Ao forced a bitter smile and replied sincerely, "I don't know what method our ancestors used, but they somehow fused Mother Profound Iron with paper pulp to create this scripture. To be honest, I've tried countless ways to extract the Mother Profound Iron from it, but the book is impervious to water, fire, and even spiritual artifacts. I simply lack the means to separate it. Since it's useless in my hands, I might as well offer it to you, Senior."

Lin Xuan nodded. The explanation seemed genuine, and he had already formed his own thoughts. Tucking the scripture into his robes, he said, "In that case, I'll overlook your earlier disrespect."

"Thank you, Senior!"

Lei Ao beamed with joy, eager to further ingratiate himself with this alchemist from the Spirit Herb Mountain—the benefits of such a connection were obvious.

But Lin Xuan waved his hand, uninterested in further flattery, and transformed into a streak of light, flying into the distance.

Soon, he came to a halt, his face clouded with hesitation as if wrestling with a difficult decision.

He retrieved the jade slip again, channeling his spiritual sense into it. After a long while, he finally looked up, deep in thought. Then, he took out a jade vial and poured out a "Hidden Spirit Pill."

This pill, refined from the essence of Red Vine Grass, not only concealed one's cultivation level but, when combined with the "Heavenly Demon Disguise Art," also provided an excellent means of altering one's appearance.

Lin Xuan transformed into an unremarkable middle-aged man.

Next, he retrieved a new set of clothes from his storage bracelet and changed into them.

In his current guise, even Sect Master Tongyu would struggle to recognize him. Of course, a Nascent Soul cultivator could see through the disguise, but Lin Xuan doubted his luck was bad enough to encounter one. While the Azure Cloud Mountain might house such formidable beings, the chances of running into one were slim.

Following the location marked on the jade slip, Lin Xuan flew toward the herb garden, which was marked in red—indicating a restricted zone.

Several miles away from the garden, he descended and cautiously extended his spiritual sense to survey the surroundings.

Almost immediately, his spiritual sense rebounded as if hitting a wall. Lin Xuan wasn't surprised—it was only natural for a herb garden to have protective formations.

He didn't act rashly but instead concealed himself nearby.

His purpose here was merely reconnaissance—to gather information about the area.

Patience was essential for stealing immortal herbs.

...

Two hours later.

A glint of sharp insight flashed in Lin Xuan's eyes as a contemplative expression settled on his face.

**Boom!**

A deafening explosion erupted from his left front, followed by the sudden appearance of a gray-robed figure.

Though the distance was great, Lin Xuan could see clearly after channeling spiritual energy to his eyes. It was a tall, gaunt man in Daoist robes, around fifty years old.

His face was a mix of shock, fury, and terror.

Before the Daoist was a faint blue barrier.

From the barrier, beams of light as thick as bowls shot forth at incredible speeds, leaving no room for evasion.

The Daoist muttered curses under his breath and slapped his chest, summoning an umbrella-like defensive artifact.

The umbrella spun rapidly, positioning itself as a shield.

Relieved, the Daoist was about to escape via flight when a strange plant suddenly burst from the ground, entangling his legs.

A wood-attribute demonic creature!

Like demonic beasts, certain ancient plants could absorb spiritual energy from heaven and earth, eventually gaining sentience.

Those with profound cultivation could even take human form.

Of course, such advanced wood spirits were exceedingly rare.

Most could only move and perform minor spells, often tamed by cultivation sects to serve as guardians.
