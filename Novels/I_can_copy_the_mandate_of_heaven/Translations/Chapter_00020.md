## Chapter 20: The Stone Gate

As the sun began to set, casting a warm orange glow over the landscape, Li Zhiming and Han Li crept through the underbrush, their eyes fixed on two stone huts in the distance. Han Li's excitement was palpable as he whispered to Li Zhiming, "It really looks like we've found it!"

However, as they observed the area, Han Li's enthusiasm was tempered by concern. "But it seems like someone comes here often," he said, his brow furrowed in thought. 

The two boys watched as a figure emerged from a nearby path, moving swiftly and purposefully toward the stone huts. The figure was shrouded in shadows, making it difficult to discern any features. As it approached the huts, it slowed, crouching down to examine the area before standing up and scanning the surroundings. Its gaze swept over Li Zhiming and Han Li's hiding spot, and they froze, holding their breath.

The figure's voice boomed through the air, "Come out!" Li Zhiming and Han Li were paralyzed with fear, their hearts racing in unison.

The black-clad figure waited for a moment before turning away and pressing a stone into the wall. The sound of grinding stone filled the air as a hidden door swung open, revealing a dark passage. The figure stepped inside, disappearing from view.

As the silence stretched out, Han Li turned to Li Zhiming, his voice barely above a whisper. "Is that... Master?" 

Li Zhiming's face went blank, his mind reeling with the implications. It was indeed their Master, Mo Daren, also known as the Ink Doctor.

Han Li's expression changed from fear to curiosity. "What is Master doing here?" 

Li Zhiming's grip on Han Li's arm tightened. "Let's observe for a bit longer."

As they waited, Mo Daren emerged from the stone hut, glanced around, and then disappeared into the trees. It wasn't until much later, when Mo Daren reappeared, that Li Zhiming and Han Li breathed a sigh of relief.

The two boys realized that Mo Daren's gaze had not been specifically directed at them, but rather at the general area. They decided to return to their daily routine, careful not to arouse suspicion.

However, their curiosity got the better of them, and they began to discuss their next move. Li Zhiming suggested waiting for a time when Mo Daren was busy treating patients, and then sneaking back to the stone hut.

Han Li was hesitant, but Li Zhiming's plan seemed plausible. They decided to wait for the right moment to sneak back and uncover the secrets hidden within the stone hut.

Days passed, and their patience was rewarded. A steady stream of injured patients arrived at the medicinal valley, keeping Mo Daren occupied. Seizing the opportunity, Li Zhiming and Han Li made their move, slipping out of the valley while Mo Daren was distracted.

As they put some distance between themselves and the valley, they couldn't help but feel a sense of excitement and trepidation. They knew that if they were caught, the consequences would be severe.

"Let's hurry," Li Zhiming urged, his voice low and urgent. "If Master finds out, we'll be in big trouble!"

Han Li nodded in agreement, his heart still racing from their close call. Despite their youth, they were aware of the gravity of their actions and the potential risks involved.

With a deep breath, they pressed on, determined to uncover the secrets hidden within the stone hut.
