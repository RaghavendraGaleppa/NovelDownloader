**Chapter 30: The Rice Thief**

Spirit Rice absorbs the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into its body. Without any transformation, this energy becomes the nutrients for its growth, consuming a portion and storing the rest. Impurities are directly stripped away, and the purest spiritual energy is concentrated in its seeds for propagation. Spirit Rice also possesses life, and its vitality is incredibly potent. As long as the Spirit Rice is alive, this process of absorption and fusion will not cease, even if consumed by a cultivator. Therefore, the Spirit Rice eaten by cultivators must be processed and dead, incapable of germinating again! This is also why the sect's Spirit Rice rewards are usually distributed about ten days after the harvest, rather than immediately. This delay is to ensure all freshly harvested spirit grains are processed and killed. Only a small portion remains alive for the next planting season. Cultivators can only refine Spirit Rice that is completely dead, without any signs of life. If they consume unprocessed, living spirit grains, there is a high possibility that the living spirit grains will take root and sprout within some very weak cultivators. They would then treat these weak cultivators as nutrients, absorbing their True Essence and flesh to merge and grow. For powerful cultivators, this is not a major concern; they can expend a small amount of mental effort to kill the Spirit Rice. But for some weaker cultivators, the Spirit Rice could even absorb them to death.

In the following days, Ding Rui would make time to monitor everyone in the spirit fields, in addition to his regular work. While weeding daily, he would also pay attention to whether any problematic Spirit Rice plants appeared. After all, this concerned the interests of their entire spirit field. He didn't want a single stalk of Spirit Rice to be lost, only for the final harvest to inexplicably come up short. The very next day, Ding Rui discovered another Spirit Rice plant from which a small portion of spirit grains had been "stolen." After confirming that something was indeed amiss, Ding Rui observed even more meticulously. He even subtly reduced his overtime hours outside, without alerting anyone. But to avoid tipping off the culprit, he was extremely careful, making sure not to reveal any flaws in his routine.

...

One day, it was precisely noon. Ding Rui did not finish his work early as he usually did. Instead, he deliberately slowed his pace, weeding and killing insects in the spirit fields while keeping an eye on everyone he could see.

If it weren't for having done it so many times, achieving absolute confidence and proficiency, he wouldn't have been able to resolve the "battle" so perfectly and swiftly. Even Ding Rui, who had been simultaneously killing insects and weeding for nearly a month and a half, couldn't match his skill. After placing the plucked spirit grains inside his clothes, Yang Shou glanced over at Ding Rui again. Ding Rui still had his eyes closed, and faint True Essence glowed from his hands, indicating he was still working. Yang Shou then completely relaxed and walked towards the next Spirit Rice plant. He didn't tamper with this one. He quickly finished processing it, then moved to the next. What he didn't know was that everything he did had already been seen by Ding Rui, who had subtly opened his eyes. Ding Rui was deeply shaken. He hadn't expected that his accidental discovery and his speculation were actually true!
