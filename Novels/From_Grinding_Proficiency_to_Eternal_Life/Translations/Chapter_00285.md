# Chapter 285: The Langhuan Library

Chang Cangming was rendered speechless. The sharp, eager light in his eyes quietly faded.

To someone deeply versed in the Way of the Sword, contending with a heavy-weapon martial artist lacked a certain appeal. Heavy weapons were broad and forceful, emphasizing the use of power to crush technique. While their moves were unyieldingly fierce, they lacked delicacy, much like a brute swinging an axe to chop firewood—how could that compare to the ever-changing, agile grace of a sword?

Even the most refined methods of wielding heavy weapons, though possessing some subtlety, could not match the elegance of a sword.

When the two arrived at the Langhuan Library, Chang Cangming merely cupped his fist in a slight bow and said, "Do as you please, Junior Brother Xu."

With that, he transformed into a green shadow and stepped onto the astral path, departing. The fluttering of his sleeves stirred wisps of phantom afterimages formed by churning vital energy.

Xu Yunfan watched the figure disappear at the end of the cloud bridge, his gaze gradually deepening.

He knew this Senior Brother's sudden appearance was no coincidence. It was clearly a move to gauge the weight of this "newly promoted true disciple."

After all, the resources of the Dao Sect were limited. One more person sharing the pie meant one less portion of opportunity for others.

Chang Cangming appeared to leave with a carefree air, but in reality, he had already engraved the word "vigilance" into every step he took. What had just occurred was merely the appetizer.

Xu Yunfan retracted his gaze, his fingers unconsciously tracing the Flaming Python Cudgel on his back. He opened the steel mechanism case, plucked a ginseng tendril from the Root Spirit to chew on, and examined the Langhuan Library before him.

As Xu Yunfan pushed open the massive doors of the Langhuan Library, carved with the Dao Sect's unique cloud patterns, the bitter-sweet taste of the ginseng tendril still lingered on his tongue. Scorching heat continuously flowed from his stomach to his limbs, rapidly transforming into vital energy and making his Qi increasingly dense and potent.

Pushing the door open, the vast sea of books that rushed to meet him took his breath away.

A nine-story circular pavilion soared toward the heavens. Each layer's eaves hung with jade-green bells that swayed without wind, shedding faint, clear light.

Tens of thousands of black iron bookshelves were arranged in the pattern of the Eight Trigrams. On the shelves, bamboo slips, silk scrolls, and ancient books emitted the faint luster of golden nanmu wood. Jade scrolls flowed with water-like spiritual energy, and even more ancient beast-skin scrolls were placed in the corners, a testament to the antiquity of the library's collection.

Above the third floor, spiraling cloud ladders wound upward. Disciples stepping on the Green Duckweed Stance appeared and disappeared amidst the mist, the hem of their robes sweeping past and leaving behind waves of ink fragrance.

The central dome was wide open, and a river of clear light poured down, illuminating the "Diagram of All Paths Converging" paved from a single block of cold jade on the floor, revealing every minute detail.

Inside the Langhuan Library, the clear light dripping from the dome flowed like water over the "Diagram of All Paths Converging."

Three or four Dao Sect disciples sat around the central stone platform, their fingertips tracing yellowed pages with movements so light they seemed afraid of disturbing the souls slumbering within the words.

The entire space was so quiet one could hear the sound of ink fragrance slowly settling in the air. Only the occasional turning of a page, like the flutter of a butterfly's wing, rippled the silence with an almost imperceptible tremor.

The spiritual energy within the Langhuan Library was unexpectedly rich. The foundation of the entire building seemed to be constructed with a formation similar to a Spirit Gathering Array, capable of drawing in the wandering spiritual energy of heaven and earth.

"A newcomer?"

A hoarse voice came from the right. Xu Yunfan turned his head to see an old man with white hair and beard hunched behind a sandalwood counter, his thin fingers stroking a bronze counting chip.

The old man never looked up. Beneath his gray-white eyebrows, his turbid eyes seemed half-open, as if he had long since merged with the dust that never settled within the library.

"That's right. May I ask who Senior is..."

Xu Yunfan cupped his fist, the scales of his dragon-scale armor emitting a faint clang with the movement.

The old man finally lifted his eyelids, revealing two needle-point glints in his pupils. "Do you know the rules? Hand over your token."

When Xu Yunfan placed the Xuantian Token on the counter, a faint layer of spiritual light suddenly appeared on the dark wood surface.

The old man's originally relaxed fingers suddenly tightened, and the counting chip snapped in two with a *crack*.

He stared at the words "Tongxuan" on the token for a full three breaths, his Adam's apple bobbing as he swallowed down either shock or envy. In the end, it all transformed into a sigh so soft it was almost inaudible.

"The Xuantian Token... It has been so many years since I last saw one."

His withered fingertips hovered half an inch above the token, ultimately not daring to touch it.

When the old man looked up, his expression had returned to being as calm as an ancient well, but his voice was extremely low.

"With this token, you may ascend to the ninth floor, but..."

He suddenly tapped the counter three times with his finger. The jade-green bells hanging in the four corners of the library swayed without wind, locking his subsequent words within the immediate space. "Forbidden to spread outside. Violators will have their eyes gouged out."

*Thud!*

A disciple in the northwest corner knocked over an inkstone.

As the ink splashed onto the *True Explanation of the Thundercloud Hand*, the vital energy of the entire floor came to a halt.

The hair on the back of Xu Yunfan's neck stood on end. At that moment, at least twenty gazes were stuck to his back like bone-eating maggots. The sound of bamboo slips falling to the ground came from behind a bookshelf to his left, and even the deliberate sound of heavy footsteps echoed from the cloud ladder on the third floor.

Although the sound was confined to the immediate area, these Dao Sect disciples were truly hidden dragons and crouching tigers; they had actually managed to hear the old man's words.

The old man acted as if he hadn't noticed. With a flick of his wrist, a green thread flew out from his sleeve and wrapped around Xu Yunfan's wrist. "With this token, you can stay for as long as you like. Come out only when you're hungry."

With that, he buried his head back in the account book, his hunched back resembling an eternal tomb guardian.

When Xu Yunfan turned around, the silence of the entire library had already changed in nature.

The disciples who had been focused on reading the classics still maintained their heads-down posture, but their tense shoulders, slightly shifted feet, and the suddenly frozen fingers on the pages all betrayed them in the undercurrent of spying.

A disciple in a purple robe by the third-floor railing even crushed the spiritual fruit in his hand. As the juice dripped through his fingers, it reflected a crimson shadow on the cold jade floor.

As he stepped onto the cloud ladder leading to the second floor, a wave of suppressed discussion erupted behind him.

"The Xuantian Token?! Isn't that only for..."
"Shh! Do you want to be thrown into the刑堂's dungeon?"
"I heard the last person to hold one was three hundred years ago..."

The whispers turned into a tangible resistance by the time Xu Yunfan reached the third floor.

Four disciples in indigo Dao robes stood blocking the stairway. The leader wore a "Xuanxiao" jade token at his waist, signifying his status as a true disciple.

The man's hand rested on the hilt of his sword. His face held a profound expression, the firelight revealing undisguised probing in his eyes. "This Junior Brother looks unfamiliar."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly, his gaze sweeping over the "Xuanxiao" jade tokens hanging at the waists of the four men.

They were likely true disciples from the Xuanxiao Peak of the Dao Sect. To have reached the Blood Transformation Realm at such an age gave them sufficient capital.

Under his keen vital energy perception, the blood and Qi of these four men, while like surging rivers, had not yet broken free from the shackles of the Blood Transformation Realm. In an ordinary sect, they might serve as elder guards, and in more remote provinces, they could even establish their own schools. But in a place like the Dao Sect, teeming with hidden dragons and crouching tigers, they were somewhat lacking.

Some people, even if their martial arts advanced by leaps and bounds, would be stuck for a lifetime, unable to make further progress.

Those who could continuously break through the shackles of martial arts, shatter their physical limits, and become ultimate experts were, after all, a minority.

The scales on his shoulder trembled faintly, and a pressure as if a mountain were pressing down seeped out from his pores.
