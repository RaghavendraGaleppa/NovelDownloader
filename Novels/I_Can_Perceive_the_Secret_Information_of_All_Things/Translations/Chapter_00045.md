# Chapter 45: An Imported Demon in the Mad Demon Cave  

A sinister wind howled through the Mad Demon Cave on Dragon Rise Mountain, the blood-red characters above its entrance exuding an unmistakable arrogance.  

Deep within the cave, in one of its many chambers, the sound of weeping echoed ceaselessly.  

"Shut up! Keep crying and I'll stew you all!" A pig-headed demon brandished a thick whip, cracking it against the wooden cage bars. "With vermicelli!"  

The humans trapped behind the bars—children ranging from seven or eight to fifteen or sixteen—immediately fell silent, cowed by the demon's ferocity.  

This was the holding pen for humans, designed much like a pigsty—likely the extent of the demons' imagination when it came to confinement, or perhaps inspired by their own past experiences.  

Take the fierce pig demon, for instance. He might have once been a pig raised by humans before gaining intelligence through sheer luck. Now in charge of the cages, he had simply replicated the system he knew best.  

"Let us go home! We don’t want to cultivate immortality anymore!"  

"Why are we locked up here? We were promised Mount Wuliang—is this Mount Wuliang?"  

"I was handpicked by an immortal master! Release me at once!"  

A few brave children tried reasoning their way out of their predicament.  

It didn’t work. The pig demon bared his fangs, and soon other demons joined in, snarling at the children.  

The intimidation worked perfectly.  

Silence.  

"Bring some demon beasts to guard them," the pig demon ordered. "Make sure these little runts don’t escape at night. The boss said we’re trading them in a few days—no mistakes allowed."  

A few odd-looking lesser demons led several large wolves to stand watch.  

The Mad Demon Cave wasn’t a single straight tunnel but branched into three paths: the middle led to the living quarters, the left to food and weapons storage, and the right to the holding pens.  

At the heart of the central path lay a grand circular hall, illuminated by torches and bone lamps. A bull demon was busy squeezing oil into the lamps to keep the flames burning bright.  

A bear demon, draped in a bearskin cloak, strode into the hall surrounded by lesser demons. As he reached the head seat, he shrugged off the cloak, which was caught—just barely—by a fox demon who had been too slow.  

The bear demon scowled. "Be careful! That’s my granduncle. Stain it, and I’ll make underwear out of your pelt."  

"Forgive me, Great King! I’ll be more careful next time!" The fox demon groveled before hanging the "granduncle" on a large rack.  

This bearskin had once belonged to a hunter who had slain the bear. The current demon king had avenged his granduncle—who had raised him—by reclaiming the pelt.  

Soon, more demons flooded the hall, filling it with raucous noise. Raw meat, bones, wine, and blood-brewed liquor were served as the fiends feasted and roared.  

"Tonight, I feast you all! Eat your fill, for in a few days, the real harvest begins," the bear demon declared in a booming voice. "Once we sell these humans, the spirit stones and treasures we get will keep us living well for two years!"  

"Winter is over! Let us welcome spring with passion! Praise spring!"  

"Praise spring!" the demons chorused.  

Having roused their spirits, the Bear King outlined their tasks.  

"Disguising myself as an immortal master to lure humans with promises of apprenticeship won’t last forever," he said. "Last time, I was a wandering mystic. This time, a Mount Wuliang immortal. Next, maybe a virtuous monk… But humans learn from disasters. They’ll wise up."  

"So this path has an end. We must plan ahead."  

"Look at our hunting grounds—centered on Dragon Rise Mountain, we’ve scoured nearby counties. Now we’re even preying on Willow Town. Our options are shrinking."  

"I’ve decided—after this deal, we relocate. Westward, to the demon holy land, Tianzhou City."  

A demon who knew to prepare for the future.  

Yet his heartfelt speech was met with silence.  

Finally, a demon spoke up.  

"But this is my homeland. I don’t want to leave. What if the new place doesn’t agree with me?"  

"Humans were born here, and so were we. Why should we be the ones to move?"  

"Yeah! Why?"  

Many lesser demons resisted the idea, some even boasting of conquering Willow Town or destroying Longxiang County, complete with detailed plans.  

Seeing this, the Bear King sighed and shelved the discussion.  

Different minds, different visions. Orders would have to suffice when the time came.  

Human lands were richer than the demon territories to the west, but far more dangerous.  

With survival growing harder, relocation was inevitable.  

"Now, about this trade," the Bear King continued. "I’ve contacted the buyers. They’re tight-lipped about their origins and purpose, but we’ve dealt before—they’re reliable. They’ll arrive soon, date unknown."  

"Pighead, keep guarding the humans. The perimeter stays with the macaques."  

"Everything remains as before, except for sentry duty. Since our professional crow died, we’ve lacked a suitable replacement."  

Sentry duty sounded trivial but was crucial—especially for demons. A sentry’s mistake could mean annihilation by human cultivators.  

The role demanded care.  

"Then…" A voice spoke up. The demons turned to look. After a pause: "Let~ me~ do~ it."  

The Bear King frowned. The voice was unfamiliar. "Who said that?"  

The demons all stared at the source—a strange creature.  

Another pause.  

"Me~"  

The odd thing seemed slow, its reactions delayed.  

"Ah, the new recruit," the Bear King recalled. "The overseas demon. Imported."  

He remembered now. Busy with his schemes, he’d neglected to vet the newcomer.  

Another pause.  

"Y~es."  

Some demons bristled at its sluggish reply.  

"You volunteering for sentry duty pleases me. Everyone knows its importance, especially now," the Bear King said. "You’re hired. Now, introduce yourself. What kind of demon are you?"  

Another pause.  

"My name~" the strange import said, "is~ ko~a~la."  

The Bear King studied the koala demon.  

*Hmm… It looks sharp—those deceptively lazy eyes and big black nose radiate wisdom. Its slow reactions must mean deep thought—measuring twice before cutting once. And those ears! Perfect for eavesdropping…*  

*This puts my mind at ease. Imported goods are just better.*  

*It’s decided.*  

The Bear King resolved to entrust sentry duty to the koala during the critical trade, with the others assisting this foreign demon.  

Just its appearance alone would intimidate rival demon factions.  

"Interesting name," the Bear King said. "Here—have some wine."  

A moment later, a wolf demon beside the koala spoke up.  

"Great King… I think it’s asleep."  

"Exactly!" the Bear King nodded sagely. "Resting before work shows experience. A true… what was it again?"  

"Koala!" another demon supplied.
