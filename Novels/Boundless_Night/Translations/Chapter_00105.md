Chapter 105: All Tough Battles

Fire springs gurgled, winding through the pine forest, with fiery mists and green pines reflecting each other.

Qin Ming’s low murmurs were naturally heard by those nearby. The golden-armored guards opposite him, wary, instinctively widened their distance. They found it absurd; how could such a fierce young man still appear slightly bewildered?

"At the last moment, his hands were like tiger claws. That must be his most proficient Heavenly Radiance Energy, not very related to the Hegemon's legacy. He truly hasn't mastered it." Qin Ming felt enlightened. This was just a bluffing Outer Saint, completely undeserving of his reputation. Even Li Qingyue’s three followers showed odd expressions, wanting to ask: "Are you seriously analyzing and pondering this?"

In truth, the main reason was that Qin Ming had been deceived by the great lance. Seeing the opponent's Heavenly Radiance projecting over two meters, his hair had stood on end in tension. Last time, he had nearly died fighting an Outer Saint whose Heavenly Radiance could only extend half a foot in the desert. Now, encountering a golden-armored youth with such profound Heavenly Radiance, how could he not be shocked? Yet, the result left him baffled. It wasn't until Qin Ming picked up the great lance and lightly shook it, his own Heavenly Radiance Energy spreading out, that his eyes changed immediately. He then realized where the problem lay. This was a rare weapon forged with Jade Iron! In an instant, his confusion vanished. He understood the situation: the golden-armored youth's Heavenly Radiance could extend over two meters solely because of this special great lance.

"That makes sense. So you guys aren't that powerful after all!" Qin Ming looked at the golden-armored guards opposite him, his eyes sharpening. He gained a clear understanding of his own strength, realizing he had almost been "deceived" by these people. "I am indeed not weak!" Qin Ming glared like a tiger, staring at his nearby opponents.

The Outer Saints opposite had no idea about his "mental journey." They were enraged by this youth's on-the-spot introspection, believing he was intentionally mocking them. In fact, everyone had been startled by Qin Ming's earlier performance, where he had shattered an Outer Saint inside his glowing, rune-emblazoned golden armor.

A smile appeared on Li Qingyue’s face, her expression visibly relaxing. She had heard from Meng Xinghai that Qin Ming possessed exceptional talent, surpassing other abnormals of his age, and could go very far on the path of physical mutation. However, even Old Meng himself didn't know that Qin Ming's integrated Heavenly Radiance Energy was so formidable, already capable of fighting Outer Saints. Therefore, Li Qingyue’s earlier understanding of Qin Ming’s strength wasn't that clear either.

Li Qingxu’s face was grim. One of his own men had been killed by the opponent in a single exchange, simple yet brutal, a display of violent aesthetics. Most crucially, the golden-armored youth wielding the great lance had a distant blood relation to his teacher.

"Is he very strong on your path? But I didn't see him unleash his Heavenly Radiance Energy," Zheng Maoze secretly asked He Tai.

"Are you still telling me to hold back?" He Tai’s expression turned solemn. He believed that Qin Ming possessed more than just this strength, and his Heavenly Radiance Energy might actually be projectable. Zheng Maoze secretly transmitted, "The situation is becoming more complicated. An expert who has cultivated a special Heavenly Radiance Energy has appeared, which is disadvantageous to Li Qingxu. We cannot offend Li Qingyue now." He Tai replied gravely, "He might be an Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata. If you tell me to restrain myself, what if I get killed by his sudden burst of Heavenly Radiance Energy?" "What did you say? He cultivates Tathagata Energy?!" Zheng Maoze was shocked.

Qin Ming was currently studying the golden armor steaming with blood mist. The youth had been shattered by him, but the armor was intact, standing on the spot, flowing with brilliant light, very dazzling. "So there are vulnerabilities! Attack from the hands and feet; Heavenly Radiance Energy can penetrate there and kill the opponent." Hearing his words, the Outer Saints opposite immediately recoiled, feeling that this youth was a ruthless individual, clearly thinking about how to thoroughly kill his opponents. Qin Ming understood the intention of the Out-of-Realm masters: the golden armor could protect people from harm, but if no blood was shed, it would be too gentle and wouldn't align with the true meaning of competition. Therefore, it gave the defeated a chance to live, but they themselves couldn't be completely helpless.

In the distance, Wang Caiwei, clad in black and gold armor, her figure graceful and beautiful face showing surprise, asked the person beside her, "This youth is quite special. Have you figured out his origin? Can he actually project Heavenly Radiance Energy?" The young expert beside her, Jiang Congyun, a disciple of Pure Yang Palace, was very knowledgeable. He said, "I suspect he cultivates Jade Purity Energy. If his Heavenly Radiance can already be projected, then he'd be extremely troublesome." Jiang Congyun's Pure Yang Energy was incredibly formidable, even capable of scorching and destroying spiritual consciousness, but he was quite wary of legendary energy arts. "Tathagata Energy, Jade Purity Energy... have they all appeared this time?" Wang Caiwei stared at Qin Ming's back, frowning slightly. For some reason, she felt a hint of familiarity.

Li Qingxu and Li Qingyue were in a standoff. As their consciousness energies radiated, the surrounding plants and rocks twisted and shattered. Within their Yellow Courts, patterns like immortal light intertwined and flowed, emanating outwards, shaking the nearby ancient pines and fire springs. Li Qingxu urged Zheng Maoze to attack and deal with the youth whose Heavenly Radiance Energy was so strange. "Brother Li, he might be from that ancient Daoist tradition that has been sealed for two hundred years, cultivating Jade Purity Energy. Killing him would cause great trouble," Zheng Maoze secretly responded, without mentioning the "Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata" theory.

Qin Ming merely tapped the golden armor a few times, wasting no time. He gripped the great lance and charged forward, his eyes sharp. For him, the tables had turned; why wait for the opponent to attack him? Qin Ming found the great lance very comfortable in his hands. A 'shuo' (lance/halberd) combined the characteristics of a spear and a halberd, and could also be swung like a sword. Most importantly, this two-meter-long lance was forged with Jade Iron, allowing his Heavenly Radiance to extend along it, expanding and greatly increasing its lethality. Qin Ming moved as if riding the wind, incredibly fast, taking the initiative to attack. The two men and one woman behind him discovered that this youth, whose eyes had turned terrifying after his initial confusion, had abandoned them and charged ahead. The three golden-armored guards also quickly followed suit. Without a word, the two sides engaged in battle once more!

The front end of Qin Ming's two-meter-long great lance, with its half-meter long gleaming blade, streaked through the pine forest like a bolt of lightning, aiming for an Outer Saint's neck. This expert, unarmed and confident in his strength, hadn't used any weapons, but now he was anxious. He swiftly dodged, not daring to touch the great lance. He knew well that this weapon, mixed with Jade Iron, was difficult to break. Most importantly, he also suspected that this youth was either an Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata or had cultivated Jade Purity Energy, which was truly terrifying. Who among those on this path hadn't heard of those legendary energy arts that could penetrate various Heavenly Radiance and counter all sorts of experts, leading to dire outcomes when encountered?

However, as he tried to counter with skill, he found it was like "showing off one's axe before Lu Ban's door" (a futile display of skill before a master). The great lance in the opponent's hand seemed to have come alive, twisting like a fierce flood dragon. It scraped past his neck, then abruptly dropped, inexplicably landing between his hands. This Outer Saint’s hair stood on end. Everyone had just witnessed how this youth, suspected to be an Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata, had blasted apart their comrade's hands, pouring Heavenly Radiance Energy into them to shatter him. Now, his own hands were targeted. Was this youth trying to kill him completely? The most critical thing was that one of his hands was already bleeding; he hadn't managed to dodge completely, and the gleaming lance blade had sliced off two of his fingers. This Outer Saint was decisive. He didn't dare pick up his severed fingers. Without a word, he turned and fled. He was terrified, afraid of becoming the second person killed. After all, the "Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata" had carefully studied the golden armor, presumably to figure out how to thoroughly kill an opponent.

The finger-less man vanished in a flash. They had only entered a short while ago and were still near the entrance. He ignored Li Qingxu’s murderous gaze and voluntarily withdrew. With a clang, Qin Ming's great lance collided with another Outer Saint's wolf-tooth club. This Outer Saint recoiled, his wolf-tooth club chipped in one section, and seven or eight of its spikes were sheared off. This time, Qin Ming displayed the pure Hegemon Lance technique. The gleaming lance blade thrust forward, as if to pierce the heavens, carrying with it an inexplicable momentum. The two-meter-long great lance, carrying Qin Ming's Heavenly Radiance Energy, constantly roared, vibrated, and erupted with terrifying ripples. The Outer Saint was horrified. His heavy weapon couldn't block it at all; it was directly stuck by the inexplicable Heavenly Radiance and then sent flying. With a thud, the Outer Saint felt a sharp pain in his chest, struck by a heavy force. His protective golden armor instantly glowed, activating its sacred runes. He spat out a mouthful of blood. If the golden armor hadn't blocked a certain death blow, he would not only have been impaled but also certainly shattered. Qin Ming lunged again, directly sending this person flying dozens of meters away. This Outer Saint was decisive and immediately fled. He felt he had done his best and had no regrets; fighting further would surely lead to his death. "Cousin, I'm leaving first!" The fourth golden-armored guard, from the Li family, was actually Li Qingxu's cousin. He was even more decisive, fleeing without a fight.

He Tai was eager to try, increasingly convinced that this was an Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata. He wanted to go all out with his Great Ape King Energy against him. Back then, the patriarch of their lineage had fought an expert who commanded Tathagata Energy, and though badly defeated, gained much from the experience. "Don't go over there!" Zheng Maoze stopped He Tai. He suspected that the youth wielding the lance might already be able to project Heavenly Radiance Energy, and worried about He Tai's safety. From historical records, while Great Ape King Energy was terrifying, it ultimately couldn't match Tathagata Energy. Most importantly, Zheng Maoze sensed that experts were approaching. As an Out-of-Realm disciple, his powerful spiritual consciousness made him incredibly sensitive.

"Junior Sister Li, you're actually here." Tang Xumi appeared, smiling. Then, he fixed his gaze on Li Qingxu, saying, "Brother Li, it seems you're out!" Qin Ming and his group had just entered when they were blocked here. They hadn't even released the bird carrying a wisp of Tang Xumi's spiritual consciousness, yet he had been drawn here. "Good! Let's send him out first!" Li Qingyue nodded. Being able to end the battle quickly was better than her having to fight Li Qingxu alone and then expel him. Li Qingxu's face turned ugly. Two core disciples were targeting him. His hope of winning in the Spirit Cavern and obtaining a near-immortal object was very slim. "That big fatty didn't make a move, did he?" Tang Xumi looked to the other side. Zheng Maoze's spiritual consciousness almost boiled over. He was only stout; being called "Big Zhuang" behind his back already annoyed him, but for Tang Xumi to call him "big fatty" to his face was outrageous!

Li Qingxu suddenly leaped up and fled into the distance. He didn't want to leave the Spirit Cavern yet. Even if his chances were slim, he wanted to last until the very end. Swathes of ancient pines shattered as Li Qingyue and Tang Xumi intercepted him simultaneously. The three fought in the distant forest. Mysterious symbols flickered on Li Qingxu's brow. He swung a purplish-glowing bamboo staff, taking a direct hit from Li Qingyue's spiritual consciousness, as he directly clashed with Tang Xumi. "Let's go!" Wang Caiwei led her people and quickly vanished. "Quickly leave!" Although Zheng Maoze was seething with anger, he didn't dare confront Tang Xumi. He pulled the somewhat reluctant He Tai away.

Outside the ruins of Luofu Immortal Mountain, many people were watching, waiting for the results. People found that it hadn't been long since they entered, yet someone covered in blood had already fled out. "He's Li Qingxu's golden-armored guard," someone remarked. Many people showed expressions of surprise. Everyone knew that Li Qingxu's teacher, that senior expert, was too overbearing, and many dared not express their anger. This time, within the rules, some core disciples targeting his disciple was very reasonable; everything had been foreshadowed. "Li Qingxu might be the first to be eliminated," someone chuckled softly.

The person who fled out felt humiliated and tried to save face, saying, "I was injured by an Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata. He can shatter an Outer Saint through their golden armor!" "How are you sure he's an Abandoned Disciple of Tathagata?" someone questioned. Another person escaped, also a golden-armored guard of Li Qingxu, and hearing the question, said, "It could also be a descendant of the Jade Purity lineage." Many people looked startled. Was the youth beside Li Qingyue really that incredible? Was his Heavenly Radiance Energy truly so destructive?

...

Even with his golden armor protection, Li Qingxu was heavily wounded, coughing blood all the way. But he didn't want to be eliminated and escaped using a secret art. He was simply too unwilling to give up. Furthermore, he hadn't reached his wit's end yet. The most powerful helper the Li family had hired for him was arranged to be near a certain core disciple. Although this broke the rules, as long as it wasn't exposed, their goal could be achieved secretly. After Tang Xumi left, Qin Ming and Li Qingyue decisively released the bird, not wanting him to track them covertly.

A lake formed by fire springs gleamed with dazzling light, surrounded by many abandoned ancient medicinal fields. A thousand years ago, this place was scorched earth by external Heavenly Radiance, but now it was gradually recovering. One or two types of medicinal herbs could occasionally be seen in the furrows. "Zhou Chengru!" Li Qingyue looked ahead, encountering the youth supported by Cui Chong here. "What kind of luck do you have, only encountering core disciples?" Qin Ming said, as he looked at Cui Chongxuan opposite him. Over two years had passed, and Cui Chongxuan was now about the same height as an adult man, radiating a compelling heroic aura.

Li Qingyue didn't think her luck was bad. She said, "If I can defeat all the core disciples one by one and ultimately obtain the near-immortal object, it will be even more valuable." She reminded him, "You must be careful of Cui Chongxuan. He's recently gained a great reputation among the thousand-year-old aristocratic families. Although he's not suited for the Out-of-Realm path, he cultivates the legendary 'Six Imperial Heart Sutra.' His Six Imperial Energy is no weaker than Tathagata Energy or Jade Purity Energy." Qin Ming nodded. The time to test the Silk Scroll Method had arrived!
