# Chapter 52: The Winter Hunt Concludes and the Prey is Displayed

"This trip has yielded great rewards!"

"This Art of Consumption is truly formidable."

Li Xian marveled inwardly. The advancement of Consumption meant that the energy digested and absorbed from his three daily meals was far greater than that of an ordinary person.

If he could further consume pills and spirit treasures... the effects would be even more amplified.

Li Xian focused his senses. The heat in his Dantian was continuous, and his internal Qi grew increasingly robust. Coarse grains and plain vegetables were now like mountain delicacies and seafood, while mutton and beef were akin to spirit pills and divine medicines.

Naturally, becoming stronger was now a matter of course.

The fifteen or sixteen-year-old Li Xian had long since shed his frail appearance. He was now quite robust.

But the Consumption skill was difficult to level up; it required eating mountain delicacies and earthly treasures. The Winter Hunt only occurred once a year. If he wanted to gorge himself again, gulping down deer meat, tiger meat, and drinking bear meat, he would have to wait until next year.

"I won't leave the forest just yet. I'll try to hunt as many deer as possible and prepare more dried meat!"

Li Xian's eyes shone with excitement. He would make the most of this Winter Hunt.

The Winter Hunt lasted for three days and three nights. The day of reckoning would be the next morning.

Li Xian still had a whole night to slowly smoke the dried meat. Of course, with the continuous rain, he first needed to find a cave to start a fire.

The next day.

The sky had just begun to dawn, and a rainbow bridge climbed the celestial steps.

A winter rainbow was truly a rare sight.

The heavy rain of the previous night had already begun to subside, but it had been replaced by a continuous, drizzling rain that only finally stopped in the early morning of this day.

The air was fresh after the rain.

Outside the Bear and Tiger Mountain, many people had already gathered early.

It was the day of reckoning for the Winter Hunt.

Madam Zhuang loved the Winter Hunt, and on this day, she usually personally oversaw the proceedings. Those who performed exceptionally well had the chance to be seen by the Madam.

A clear whistle was heard from deep within the forest. The Madam had returned, riding her Crimson Blood Steed.

The drizzle from the previous night had not ceased completely, leaving the air damp. Yet, for some reason, there was not a single trace of moisture on the Madam's body.

"Madam."

The guards present called out in unison.

Madam Wen nodded slightly, turned to look at the forest, and asked, "Is everyone here? Where is Pang Long?"

Lu Xing, a Grade B guard, stepped forward and said respectfully, "Commander Pang is still in the forest."

"It seems he has quite the haul this time," Madam Wen said. "No matter, we shall wait for him."

"You may all bring the prey you have hunted for me to see."

"Yes!"

First, the group of Grade D guards untied their flesh bags and took out their prey one by one.

Grade D guards were only given five Spirit Feather Arrows, so they only had five pieces of prey. Most of them were birds, foxes, pheasants... common, small beasts.

"It's a wild boar!"

Suddenly, a cry of astonishment rose from the crowd.

One of the Grade D guards had shot a wild boar. When he took it out, everyone looked on with envy, their gazes fixed upon him.

Madam Wen glanced over indifferently, showing no particular expression.

Next, it was the Grade C guards' turn to display their prey.

Grade C guards were granted ten Spirit Feather Arrows. They usually stayed in the mountains longer, and some would even venture into the inner regions to try their luck.

However, most of them had not refined their archery skills. When faced with fierce beasts, it was difficult for them to remain calm. To actually hunt a tiger or a bear was truly very, very difficult.

"Wild boar, fox, mountain pheasant, mountain monkey..."

Most of their prey停留在 this level.

Larger prey was rarely seen.

One person had hunted a "Thick-Horned Ox," which was considered outstanding, and many Grade B guards looked on with envy.

"You, go collect your reward." The Madam was direct and to the point.

After that, the Grade A and Grade B guards presented their respective prey. The guard with the best results had hunted four wild deer, three wild boars, and three birds.

He was rewarded by the Madam with a Deer Blood Pill.

This truly made everyone else green with envy.

So far, not a single large beast had appeared. Madam Wen's brow furrowed slightly, showing a hint of displeasure. She thought to herself:

"These guards couldn't even hunt a single large beast. It's a bit of a disgrace to my reputation."

"You lowly beasts! Do I need to remind you? Hurry up and move everything back to the manor!"

Luo Fang, whip in hand, directed the many laborers to carry the various pieces of prey back to the manor.

Hunting was not just for fun.

Wild boars, deer, pheasants... all had their uses. They were all money.

The laborers did the most exhausting work and were the most looked down upon and humiliated. While carrying the prey, they would occasionally look up and see the well-dressed, heroic guards with long bows on their backs.

Their hearts were filled with envy.

They did not know that the very guards they looked up to were also gazing into the depths of the forest, envious of others.

"It seems the real main event is still with the people inside."

"That's right. The large beasts are all deep inside. To hunt a large beast, you need to go deep, and you won't come out so quickly."

"Brothers, let's see who's missing."

"Eagle Master, Master Wan... and a few Grade B guards. Hmm... a few Grade C guards as well. That Li Xian hasn't come out either."

"The forest is very dangerous. He might have been eaten by a bear."

As the crowd was speaking, a movement was seen in the forest. Grade A guard Wan Xingke strode out towards the crowd, walking with the vigor of a dragon and the stride of a tiger.

"Hahaha."

A burst of hearty, unrestrained laughter.

As he stepped out of the forest, he suddenly saw the Madam. His whole body trembled, and he immediately suppressed his smile, bowing deeply to the Madam.

Pious and fearful.

"Did you hunt a large beast?" Madam Wen didn't even look at him, her slender white fingers gently stroking the yellow jade ornament on her bow.

"I... I hunted one." Wan Xingke suppressed his excitement. He shook his flesh bag, and all his catches were revealed. Among the deer, boars, and other prey, there was a tiger.

"It's a big cat!" Everyone's gaze turned to him.

Madam Wen glanced at it and couldn't be bothered to look again.

This tiger was already critically ill, with many wounds on its body from other prey. It was already on its last legs; Wan Xingke had merely gotten lucky.

"Go collect your reward as usual."

Madam Wen waved her hand.

"Yes, yes." Seeing that the Madam had not shown a shred of approval, Wan Xingke was greatly disappointed and left with his head hung low.

A little while later, movements came simultaneously from the east and west sides of the forest. It was Pang Long and Jiang Yun coming out.

Pang Long was the Guard Commander, granted twenty-five Spirit Feather Arrows and equipped with two flesh bags in advance.

Both of them were soaked, having clearly spent the night in the rain. Jiang Yun's eyes were heavily ringed and bloodshot; she was probably very dissatisfied with her results.

"Pang Long, I hope you won't let me down." Madam Wen raised her eyes to look at him.

"Madam, please take a look."

Pang Long took off his flesh bag and unloaded a Red-Furred Wild Boar.

Although this was not a large beast, it was a rare variant, incredibly fast. Hunting it was still quite an achievement.

Immediately after, he took out a tiger's head... and its body. Pang Long used a heavy bow with immense force. The arrow passed through the neck so powerfully that it separated the tiger's body from its head.

"Nothing but brute strength." Madam Wen said lightly.

Pang Long scratched his head sheepishly. He then continued to take out his prey, the lowest of which were wild boars and mountain goats...

Slightly better were a python, a Thick-Horned Ox, and a water eel...

The final piece of prey was a genuine brown bear, with a massive build.

"Commander is truly a commander, so impressive!"

"He actually hunted a brown bear. With a beast like that, even if I had a bow and arrow, I'd turn and run, let alone if I were wearing armor."

"That kind of ferocious beast is exceptionally fierce. I encountered one once. At the time, I didn't even dare fight it. I was just grateful my legs didn't give out and I could run."

The guards let out cries of astonishment. There was no doubt this was a hunting feast.

Pang Long was also quite satisfied, but Madam Wen said, "You have plenty of prey, but they lack... elegance."

"You have brute strength, but it cannot be called heroic."

"Yes." Pang Long broke into a sweat; he had been quite proud of his haul.

"Let's not talk about the others. Even this python—you went into the water to fight it, used the 'Heart-Shaking Palm' to kill it in the water, and then used a Spirit Feather Arrow to finish it off."

Madam Wen点评 casually.

Pang Long was now completely in awe. The python had indeed been killed by his Heart-Shaking Palm. The power of the Heart-Shaking Palm was insidious; its effects were not visible on the surface.

But with a single glance, the Madam saw everything clearly.

The Madam was indeed the Madam, like a divine being.

"And you." After seeing Pang Long's display, Madam Wen finally showed a bit of interest and looked at Jiang Yun.
