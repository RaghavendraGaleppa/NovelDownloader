# Chapter 105: Discourse on Immortal Foundations

An unknown amount of time passed.

"What do you wish to know?" The voice of Infant Lord broke the silence.

Hearing this, a smile immediately appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

"May I ask, Infant Lord, what exactly is this 'Polaris Magnetic Sea' inheritance? And why does it exist in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven in such a manner?" he asked eagerly, his gaze burning as he looked at the other party.

Opposite him, Infant Lord's figure slowly descended. It turned back to glance at its beloved 'transformation block', its childlike voice unusually serious as it said:

"Very well, Zhang Jing. Since you've already discovered the Polaris Magnetic Sea, telling you these things shouldn't count as breaking the rules anymore."

"Please enlighten me, Infant Lord."

"Zhang Jing, now that you've comprehended Dao Intent, I'll continue from where we left off last time."

"Currently, the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault contains three hundred and sixty-five types of Dao Intent. These were selected by our Yuanjun lineage's various High Lords from among countless immortal spirits—"

At this point, Infant Lord suddenly covered its mouth.

Time passed slowly.

When nothing happened, it gave an embarrassed laugh and continued speaking to Zhang Jing:

"In short, just remember this—these three hundred sixty-five Dao Intents form the foundational Dao Intents of our Yuanjun lineage. Any one of them, when perfected, can allow you to establish a Golden Dao Foundation and aspire to the realm of immortals and gods."

"But these Dao Intents aren't without flaws."

"They represent either a category or sometimes directly the path of a specific immortal spirit—mature and complete. Thus, before achieving immortal status, they provide tremendous assistance."

"However, after becoming an immortal, they become shackles!"

"As for the Polaris Magnetic Sea, legend says it was conceived by a certain High Lord who directly contemplated the mythical Magnetic Sea, forming a seed of the supreme path! It contains a trace of the Magnetic Sea's original true intent, with an extremely high ceiling and limitless potential."

"It's entirely possible for two immortals both cultivating the Polaris Magnetic Sea to walk completely different paths."

"Merely comprehending its basics allows one to establish a Violet Immortal Foundation, with great potential to achieve the Heavenly Immortal Dao Fruit in the future!"

"That's why those in the Upper Realm call it the Heavenly Immortal Great Dao."

"The reason the Upper Realm placed the Polaris Magnetic Sea outside rather than in the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault is naturally to select as many predestined individuals as possible. Every person who comprehends the basics of the Polaris Magnetic Sea becomes a core seed of the Yuanjun lineage."

After hearing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but be momentarily stunned.

So the Polaris Magnetic Sea was actually the key to establishing a Violet Immortal Foundation?

And it involved 'High Lords' and the mysterious 'Magnetic Sea'...

But—

A bitter taste rose in Zhang Jing's heart.

All of Infant Lord's words could be summarized in one sentence: the Polaris Magnetic Sea had limitless potential, even touching upon the Great Dao itself, and those who comprehended its basics were highly valued even in the Upper Realm.

The crucial problem now was:

He had absolutely no affinity with the Polaris Magnetic Sea.

"Giving up isn't an option. The only way is—to wait until I reach the Foundation Establishment realm and see if I can forcibly comprehend the basics of the Polaris Magnetic Sea using the jade talisman?" Zhang Jing thought to himself.

After much consideration, this seemed to be the only reliable method.

Wait a minute!

As his thoughts gradually settled, Zhang Jing suddenly realized an important question.

Could the Polaris Magnetic Sea really be the only special inheritance in the entire Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven?

He found that hard to believe.

"May I ask, Infant Lord, are there other inheritances similar to the Polaris Magnetic Sea in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven?" Zhang Jing asked, looking at Infant Lord with hopeful eyes, wishing to hear the answer he desired.

"How could that be?"

Facing Zhang Jing's gaze, Infant Lord shook its head and laughed:

"In the entire Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven, including the Polaris Magnetic Sea, there are nine inheritances in total."

Hearing this, Zhang Jing felt some of his tension ease.

Nine!

This meant that apart from the Polaris Magnetic Sea, he still had other options.

What if he encountered one he truly had an affinity with?

But before that...

"Ninety-nine steps of the Heavenly Staircase means there are five more Void Heavens above. I must first comprehend the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent deeply enough to possibly set foot in those higher Void Heavens."

A flash of determination appeared in Zhang Jing's eyes.

Given the current situation, no matter what his ultimate goal was, comprehending the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent was necessary.

This was his capital for seeking out the other eight inheritances in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.

Returning to reality, Zhang Jing asked curiously:

"Infant Lord, you even know about these things?"

"Naturally," Infant Lord rolled its eyes. "This isn't any secret in the Upper Realm."

So that's how it was.

Understanding dawned on Zhang Jing's face, and he said politely:

"Infant Lord, please send me to comprehend the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent."

"Go then!"

"But remember well—don't speak of what I've told you today to anyone in the Lower Realm," Infant Lord said sternly as it waved its hand.

"Understood."

In an instant, Zhang Jing disappeared from the spot.

Familiar surroundings.

Zhang Jing sat directly on the meditation cushion, then took out the two qian of Enlightenment Tea obtained from Senior Brother Qi.

After some thought, he picked out two leaves of slightly inferior quality and slowly placed them in his mouth.

Given that the amount of spiritual essence this time was less than expected and wouldn't exchange for much Dao Intent comprehension time, Zhang Jing didn't need to use his best resources.

As crimson divine light and Dao-guiding spiritual light flickered and fluctuated...

"Begin comprehension!" he shouted inwardly.

Time flowed slowly.

At a certain moment.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes, the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent swirling in his gaze having faintly grown more concentrated.

The jade talisman gradually materialized from the void.

[Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (8/1000)]

"With the jade talisman's assistance and the Dao-guiding spiritual light's support, spending a full 730,000 units of spiritual essence only increased the Dao Intent comprehension progress by 7 points?"

Zhang Jing frowned slightly.

There were still nearly nine months left!

The difficulty in improving Dao Intent meant he would spend more time than expected accumulating spiritual essence and comprehending Dao Intent.

Correspondingly, the time available to explore the other eight inheritances would be compressed.

Yet not comprehending Dao Intent wasn't an option either.

Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to reach the higher Void Heavens.

"Troublesome, truly troublesome!"

But no matter how troublesome, he had to push forward regardless.

With a sigh, Zhang Jing's figure instantly vanished.

Leaving the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault, he returned to his stone house.

After scanning with his spiritual sense to confirm he hadn't forgotten anything, Zhang Jing went directly to Senior Brother Qiu's stone house.

No one was inside.

Likely out hunting spirit beasts.

Remembering what Senior Brother Qiu had said earlier, Zhang Jing didn't stand on ceremony. He pushed open the wooden door and entered.

After leaving a farewell message with his spiritual sense, he transformed into a streak of rainbow light and shot straight into the clouds.

It was about time to leave the Sixth Void Heaven.
