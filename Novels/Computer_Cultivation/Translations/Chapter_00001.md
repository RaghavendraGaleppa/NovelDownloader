**Chapter 1: Primordial Spirit! Activate!**

"Primordial Spirit! Activate!"

A massive mechanical device awakened in the room, its bright white indicator lights flashing and fans roaring. In front of the machine sat a clear-eyed young man.

"Primordial Spirit Unit 1 booting up..."
"Connecting to administrator's Divine Sense..."
"Connection successful..."
"Analyzing meridian spiritual power flow..."
"Analysis complete..."
"Please activate spiritual power rotation at Dantian coordinates (3689, 1689, 56)..."

A torrent of information exchanged between the computer and Fang Jun's Sea of Consciousness, rapidly solving cultivation difficulties and pushing his cultivation base to soar.

"Just as I estimated, the computer increased the spiritual qi utilization rate by 25%."

A wave of joy bloomed in Fang Jun's heart.

In this world of cultivation, a cultivator's spiritual qi utilization rate typically stood as follows: single spiritual root 100%, dual spiritual root 50%, triple spiritual root 20%, quadruple spiritual root 5%, and a quintuple spiritual root a mere 1%.

Therefore, quadruple and quintuple spiritual roots were known as "pseudo-spiritual roots," making Foundation Establishment almost impossible.

This was because the entire cultivation process, the environment within the meridians and Dantian, was completely dynamic, different at every moment, requiring real-time calculations.

A single spiritual root absorbed only one type of spiritual qi, requiring the processing of variables for only that one type. However, a quintuple spiritual root absorbed five types of spiritual qi, necessitating the processing of variables for all five.

Real-time calculation meant a limited processing time. If an answer couldn't be obtained within that limited time, one couldn't follow the correct cultivation steps. This would lead to the spiritual qi being wasted in vain, with no gains whatsoever. This was the fundamental reason for the low spiritual qi utilization rate of quintuple spiritual roots.

It was like everyone taking the same college entrance exam; those with single spiritual roots were tested on "1+1," while those with quintuple spiritual roots were tested on "advanced mathematics"—utterly unfair.

Even if Fang Jun, relying on mathematical tools, had mathematized the cultivation technique processing and converted it into algorithms, then optimized those algorithms, his brain's hardware simply couldn't support rapid calculations, capping his spiritual qi utilization rate at 25%.

However, just because the human brain couldn't do it didn't mean he couldn't seek external aid.

After Fang Jun created the Primordial Spirit Unit 1 computer, it instantly boosted his spiritual qi utilization rate to 50%. The reason it wasn't yet 100% was that the problem of five spiritual qis was too complex, and the cultivation technique itself couldn't handle all five spiritual qi issues. Fang Jun couldn't devise an algorithm for it, so even if the computer ran faster, it wouldn't be able to process it.

"But a 50% utilization rate is already the standard for a dual spiritual root. Aside from differences in cultivation techniques, I am already a dual spiritual root cultivator!"
"Foundation Establishment is within reach in this life! Longevity is within reach!"

Fang Jun suppressed his thoughts, focusing on his cultivation, pushing towards the third layer of Qi Condensation.

...

The next morning, Fang Jun stepped out of his room and encountered the thin Old Li.

"Fellow Daoist Fang, good morning."
"Fellow Daoist Li, good morning to you too."

Old Li chuckled, about to say something, when his gaze suddenly sharpened. "You've reached the third layer of Qi Condensation?" he asked in surprise.

A cultivator's meridians typically maintained a constant grand circulation of spiritual power, serving as both protection and maintenance. However, outside the Dantian, the stability of spiritual power decreased, radiating various electromagnetic waves. In a cultivator's Divine Sense, this manifested as a "spiritual power aura." Based on the strength of this aura, one could roughly judge a cultivator's cultivation level.

Fang Jun smiled faintly, saying nonchalantly, "Pure luck, pure luck. I had a slight epiphany yesterday."

Old Li sighed with emotion, "Truly, the younger generation is formidable! I'm already in my seventies or eighties, yet I'm only at the third layer of Qi Condensation. This is the fate of a quadruple spiritual root, I suppose."

Fang Jun: "..."
Fang Jun didn't know what to say about such a topic. Should he comfort Old Li by revealing he was a quintuple spiritual root, telling him not to be disheartened and that there was still hope for advancement? That would expose his deception of pretending to be a triple spiritual root.

Fang Jun changed the subject. "That damned Great River Sect, they've increased the required tribute of Spirit-Patterned Steel by twenty percent this year. Isn't this practically killing us?"

Hearing this, Old Li also sighed. "Indeed. We'll have to spend twenty percent more time smithing every day, which means less time for cultivation. And the worst part is, our wages haven't changed. This old body of mine might just give out this year."

As Qi Condensation cultivators, Fang Jun and Old Li worked at Zhuge Blacksmith Shop to earn cultivation resources. There was no other way. Cultivators relied on "wealth, companions, techniques, and land" for their cultivation, with "land" referring to spiritual veins. All spiritual veins in the world were already owned, and to cultivate, one had to pay rent for housing within them. If they couldn't pay, cultivators would be driven out of the spiritual vein area, forced to live in places with sparse spiritual qi, thereby cutting off all avenues for advancement. Hence, this work was a necessity.

The two arrived at the blacksmith shop. Before they could start work, the corpulent shopkeeper, Zhuge Chen, gathered all the employees.

"From today onwards, the tribute of Spirit-Patterned Steel to the Great River Sect will be increased to fifty percent."

Zhuge Chen's voice was calm, yet it was like a pebble dropped into a placid lake, stirring ripples.

One cultivator couldn't help but ask, "Shopkeeper, it was already twenty percent before, and now it's an additional fifty percent? If this continues, how will we have any time to cultivate?"

Zhuge Chen said blandly, "It's not an additional fifty percent *after* the twenty percent, but a base of fifty percent from now on."

Another cultivator complained, "Even so, there won't be enough time for cultivation."

Cultivators worked primarily to earn resources for cultivation. If the resources gained were insufficient to offset the losses from cultivation, it would be putting the cart before the horse.

Zhuge Chen explained, "Starting today, your monthly wages will increase by thirty percent."

A cultivator mumbled softly, "Thirty percent is too little."

Zhuge Chen swept his gaze over them, saying coolly, "Thirty percent is already quite a lot. The Great River Sect only gave us an additional twenty percent in resources; the remaining ten percent is me subsidizing you from the shop's profits."
"Any more, and the shop won't be able to make ends meet, and everyone will starve."

Upon hearing this, regardless of their inner thoughts, everyone chorused, "Shopkeeper, your benevolence is greatly appreciated."

At this moment, Zhuge Chen looked at Fang Jun, his tone calm but unyielding. "Fang Jun, your task isn't fifty percent; it's one hundred percent."
"Of course, to compensate you for your loss, I will also increase your wages to sixty percent."

Upon hearing this, Old Li immediately stepped forward to speak for Fang Jun. "Shopkeeper, this is too unreasonable! Fifty percent is already a struggle, but one hundred percent means smithing all day long!"

Zhuge Chen said blandly, "That's why I gave him sixty percent wages."

Old Li anxiously retorted, "It's not about the wages, but that he'll have no time to cultivate at all!"

Zhuge Chen remained unconcerned. "Can't he just buy pills?"

Old Li wanted to argue further, but Fang Jun transmitted a message with his Divine Sense: "Fellow Daoist Li, thank you for speaking up for me, but please don't anger the shopkeeper because of this."

To be honest, while one hundred percent was difficult, Fang Jun still had a way to handle it. However, the problem wasn't as simple as it appeared on the surface. Zhuge Chen targeting him must have a deeper reason. This was what truly worried Fang Jun.

Old Li paid no mind to Fang Jun and directly addressed Zhuge Chen: "Shopkeeper, I can also do one hundred percent. I can also eat pills. Just give me the same treatment as Fellow Daoist Fang."

Fang Jun: "..."
