Chapter 463: The Fulong's End is Nigh

He finally understood completely: if he had drawn in one more strand of Li Fire energy during the quenching process, the sharpness of the halberd's tip could have increased by another thirty percent. And if he had supplemented the inscription of runes with Xun Wind patterns, the flow of the killing intent would have been much smoother.

The perfection-level Heavenly Work Forging Technique indeed had its unique merits.

He immediately threw the heavy halberd back into the furnace to begin the reforging.

Three months later.

He waved his hand again, and the red flames in the furnace surged. Several fire-attributed spiritual ores were melted into a red flying wheel. Its edges were as sharp as blades, and when it spun, raging flames churned. It could unleash dark fire, suitable for both ranged and close combat—perfect for one of his six arms to wield.

"You have successfully forged a Low-grade Numinous Treasure, the Crimson Flame Flying Wheel. Your proficiency in Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital has increased."

Time flowed like water, and another three months passed.

Xu Yunfan formed a sword with his fingers, and a green light shot from his fingertips, precisely piercing into the forging furnace.

The Eight Scenes Spiritual Flame inside the furnace suddenly split. The breath of the Xun Wind and the essence of the Yi Wood intertwined, forming a green vortex in the center of the furnace.

In the center of the vortex, a peculiarly shaped chain-sword gradually took shape. The blade was composed of nine sections linked like green jade chains, each section engraved with fine Xun Wind runes.

The head of the sword was a triangular pyramid, hiding a cold gleam. The tail was adorned with three green jade beads the size of bells, trembling slightly with the airflow and emitting a clear, resonant sound.

"The Azure冥 Chain Sword is complete!"

Xu Yunfan scanned it with his spiritual sense and was satisfied to find that the connection points between the chain links concealed a mechanism. When infused with spiritual power, the nine sections could instantly straighten into a rigid sword. When the spiritual power was retracted, it could become as soft as a spirit snake and wrap around things.

After being refined and nurtured, this chain sword could be manipulated as easily as one's own arm. It was truly a fine piece among Low-grade Numinous Treasures.

Although the Heavenly Work Forging Technique was not of a high rank, integrating its unique mechanical design concepts into the path of forging actually increased the power of the Numinous Treasures by thirty percent.

Even better were the three green jade beads, which were actually containers for storing Xun Wind Qi. They could suddenly explode during combat to form a cage of wind blades.

The forging process lasted for a full two and a half years. Xu Yunfan remained fully focused. The formation of every Numinous Treasure was accompanied by the unique refining methods of the *Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital: The Cloud Manual of Creation and Transformation*.

The Eight Scenes rotated, generating life without end.

The spiritual flame in the furnace changed constantly, sometimes scorching like the sun, sometimes cold as ice, pushing the characteristics of the materials to the limit.

"The proficiency... is rising quite fast."

He glanced at his attribute panel. The progress bar for the Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital was climbing at a visible rate.

The forging technique, which was originally only at the minor success level, was rapidly approaching the major success level through such intensive forging.

"Indeed, actual combat is the fastest way to improve."

He curled his lips into a smile. This was all earned through his hard work.

To be honest, if he were in the outside world, the fact that he was proficient in the characteristics of various spiritual ores and could use the Qi of the Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital to seek the path of perfect fusion, succeeding in every single refinement, was truly astonishing.

If it were about the path of forging, looking throughout the Northern Continent's cultivation world, there were probably only a handful of refiners like him who were proficient in the characteristics of various spiritual ores and could precisely harmonize material conflicts using the Qi of the Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital.

After reaching minor success in the *Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital: The Cloud Manual of Creation and Transformation*, his感应 to spiritual materials of heaven and earth had reached a subtle realm.

As soon as he held a piece of ore in his hand, without needing to deliberately inspect it, the Eight Scenes Cloud Qi would naturally flow through it, reflecting the most essential characteristics of the material in his heart.

Where the essence of Li Fire resided, where the Qi of Gui Water was hidden—it was as clear as the lines on his palm.

What was even more rare was the unique harmonizing ability of this forging method.

Ordinary refiners often need to expend a great deal of energy to neutralize conflicts when facing materials with clashing attributes. However, he could use the principle of the Eight Scenes' rotation to make water and fire complement each other and gold and wood blend, perfectly casting materials that seemed incompatible.

"Li Baichuan, sitting on a gold mine without knowing it. It's a pity he's a Foundation Establishment True Person."

Xu Yunfan continued to invest himself in forging.

By the ninth day, the spiritual flame in the furnace suddenly converged. Eight streams of flame turned into flowing light and all merged into the final Numinous Treasure.

It was a long sword entirely silver-white. The blade was like a mirror, reflecting a cold light. It was forged from the "Mysterious Ice Cold Iron" collected from the depths of the Cold Crow Pass. When the sword was drawn, the cold air was biting, capable of freezing an opponent's spiritual power.

"It's done!"

Xu Yunfan let out a long breath. With a wave of his sleeve, the furnace lid opened, and six Numinous Treasures floated in the air, each emitting a different spiritual pressure.

He nodded in satisfaction. With a thought, the six weapons all flew into his storage bag.

"The manifestation of Three Heads and Six Arms finally has suitable Numinous Treasures to fill the slots. Next, I will integrate these six Numinous Treasures into the Dharma Form. That way, I can also use the power of the treasures to increase my cultivation."

He closed his eyes to adjust his breathing, sensing the flow of spiritual power in his body.

Although forging was mentally exhausting, the refining process of the *Eight Scenes of the Profound Capital: The Cloud Manual of Creation and Transformation* was a form of cultivation in itself. In particular, the tempering of the Eight Scenes Fire made his spiritual power even more solid.

"Next, I just need to wait for the Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi to erupt within the Cold Crow Pass."

His eyes were deep as he looked outside the cave dwelling.

"Fulong Arhat... Heh, let's see who has more patience."

"He still hasn't come out?"

The Angry-Eyed Arhat couldn't hold back anymore. Although he had cultivated a Buddha Heart, he practiced the appearance of a wrathful Vajra and acted with fiery impatience. Having waited for almost twenty years, his patience had been completely exhausted.

"Twenty years have passed."

The Angry-Eyed Arhat slammed his Vajra pestle heavily into the mountain rock. Stone fragments flew, and his expression was slightly agitated.

"Could this demon be planning to die of old age inside the pass?"

Fulong Arhat sat cross-legged on a green stone, the dragon patterns on his neck appearing dim. "Amitabha... This child's mental fortitude is unexpectedly strong."

Although he appeared calm on the surface, he was cursing inwardly.

This beast from the Demon Sect was no different from a turtle hiding in its shell.

He had actually stayed in the Cold Crow Pass for twenty years without coming out. From the intelligence they had gathered, the other party hadn't even taken half a step out of his cave dwelling.

"Brother, why must you boost the other's morale!" The Angry-Eyed Arhat's eyes burned with fury. "Why don't we just attack the Cold Crow Pass directly? Use the wrath of the Vajra to manifest the Karma Fire Lotus and burn this demon fortress to ashes!"

"Angry-Eyed!"

Cihang Arhat's white eyebrows trembled. "Do you think the Profound冥 Seven Evil Array of the Yuan Demon Sect is just for show? Did you forget the手段 that changed the array in an instant twenty years ago? If Fulong hadn't run fast, he would have already been reincarnated."

The mountain wind suddenly fell silent.

Fulong Arhat looked toward the pass and suddenly began to cough violently. Blood seeped through his fingers.

The Angry-Eyed Arhat was shocked upon seeing this. "Brother, how did your Dragon Form..."

"My lifespan is ending. This physical body... won't last three years."

Fulong Arhat wiped away the blood, and the dragon patterns faded another three parts. "The life-extending pill bestowed by the Bodhisattva back then could not withstand the erosion of karma after all."

Cihang Arhat silently put his palms together.

Among the three of them, Fulong Arhat was the oldest, nearing his four-hundred-year limit.

This time, blocking the pass for twenty years, instead of practicing in the temple managed by the Bodhi Zen Pure Land, had actually accelerated the loss of his vitality.

"Forget it..."

Fulong Arhat struggled to his feet. "I must return to the Pure Land to see the Bodhisattva and seek the decree for reincarnation. You two should go first..."

"Brother!"

The Angry-Eyed Arhat said urgently, "Are we just going to let that demon off like this?"
