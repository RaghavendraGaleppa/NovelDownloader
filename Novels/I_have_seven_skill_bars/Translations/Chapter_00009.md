# Chapter 9: A Small Test of Skill

“You can get rid of giant aphids?”

“Seriously?!”

“Are there any more giant aphids? Quick, bring them out and let this brother try.”

“They've almost all been pulled out, haven't they?”

“No, there are three new plants today that might have giant aphids. This morning, as soon as my true essence entered, I felt something was off, so I immediately pulled it back. I was just planning to re-examine them this afternoon.”

“Quick, take us there.”

…

The group was in high spirits. No one wanted to continue cultivating; they all gathered around Ding Rui, following the *Golden Radiance Art* cultivator from Spirit Field No. 112 into the field.

“This should be one. We originally planned to confirm it tonight, and if it was, we'd pull it out,” the *Golden Radiance Art* cultivator from Spirit Field No. 112 said, pointing at a spirit rice plant.

Ding Rui nodded, sat cross-legged in front of the spirit rice stalk, grasped the stalk, closed his eyes, and directly used the [Golden Radiance Spear] skill ten times consecutively.

Immediately.

Ten slender golden radiance spears materialized within the spirit rice plant.

This was his first time doing paid work.

He had to start with a bang.

So Ding Rui gave it his all.

These ten Golden Radiance Spears completely drained all the gold-attribute true essence in his body.

The *Golden Radiance Art* cultivator who had led the way had a look of surprise. He grabbed the spirit rice and began to examine it.

A moment later, he released his hand and looked at Ding Rui, his face filled with shock: “You can actually kill giant aphids!”

Ding Rui was also shocked: “You mean you only believe it now?”

The man became a little embarrassed, his face instantly flushed. He shook his head and explained, “No, no, no, I just find it too incredible. An ordinary person encountering a giant aphid wouldn't even have time to run, and they might even lose the true essence they painstakingly cultivated. You… Brother Rui, you're simply too amazing, I…”

“Look at you talking. Can Brother Rui be an ordinary person? When giant aphids encounter Brother Rui, *they* don't even have time to run. Stop wasting Brother Rui's time, quickly, to the next plant, the next plant!” Li Ang, who was accompanying them, interrupted.

The cultivator also reacted, nodding immediately: “Yes, yes, yes, we can't delay Brother Rui's time. Next plant, next plant!”

Ding Rui watched this scene and finally somewhat understood what had happened.

It seemed that the *Golden Radiance Art* cultivator from Spirit Field No. 112 completely disbelieved that he could kill giant aphids and thought he was trying to con them.

That’s why the first plant used to test Ding Rui was one without giant aphids.

It wasn't until Ding Rui had eliminated the second plant, which was confirmed to have a giant aphid, that the cultivator finally believed him.

However, Ding Rui didn't find anything wrong with it.

It was human nature.

True gold does not fear the refiner's fire; he wasn't angry at all.

“Brother Rui, this way please.”

Ding Rui didn't speak, looking at Liu Yun. He had previously been completely naive, having no exposure to such high-level transactions.

However, he felt that this price had completely exceeded his expectations.

One had to know, the sect reward for successfully cultivating the *Golden Radiance Art* was only 50 portions of spirit rice, with each portion containing 100 grains.

At today's price, if he dealt with 10 plants, that would be 300 grains; 100 plants would be 3000 grains!

With hundreds of spirit fields in the sect, if each field produced one giant aphid daily, he would go crazy with profit.

Liu Yun smiled as he looked at Ding Rui and said, “One grain for a spirit rice with ordinary aphids, and 30 grains for a spirit rice with a giant aphid. That's already considered a good price.”

Ding Rui immediately nodded furiously, grinning as he looked at the wealthy Li Ang: “Many thanks, Brother Li, many thanks, Brother Li.”
