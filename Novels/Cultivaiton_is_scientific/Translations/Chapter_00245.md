# Chapter 245: Crossing the Pass  

Li Yuanba sorted through the spiritual items with his divine sense while lost in thought. When he opened a medicine box, he hesitated slightly.  

Meanwhile, his true self, Li Shiming, had already begun searching the IBMz15's database for information about the spiritual herb inside the box—a thirty-six-petaled red flower. His memory vaguely recalled seeing a record of it in a jade slip from his master, Elder Ma.  

"It's the Eternal Blossom!" Li Shiming murmured with a smile.  

The Eternal Blossom was a second-grade spiritual herb, yet in some ways, it was more precious than third or fourth-grade herbs.  

First, the Eternal Blossom was extremely rare, growing under incredibly stringent conditions with no possibility of artificial cultivation. This made it even scarcer than higher-grade herbs.  

Second, the Eternal Blossom could restore a cultivator's youthful appearance. While this effect might not matter much to male cultivators, it was an irresistible treasure for female cultivators.  

Judging by how it had been stored, the former owner—likely a true disciple—had clearly not recognized its true value, treating it as just another second-grade herb. Fortunately, the herb's potency remained intact.  

Given its rarity, it wasn't surprising that most cultivators wouldn't recognize it even if they saw it.  

A cultivator's appearance generally remained ageless, but agelessness and youthfulness were two different things.  

Male cultivators didn’t care much about their looks, allowing their appearance to change naturally over time. Female cultivators, however, used various skin-nourishing spiritual items to maintain a youthful glow. They weren’t satisfied with mere agelessness—they wanted to preserve their beauty at its peak.  

At the end of a cultivator's lifespan, their appearance would rapidly age. But consuming an Eternal Pill, refined from the Eternal Blossom, could lock their appearance in its prime forever.  

Li Yuanba carefully transferred the Eternal Blossom into a new jade box for proper storage. The rest of the items didn’t interest him, so he set them aside to be sold off later.  

He then summoned his flying sword and resumed his journey toward the Boundary Mountain Pass.  

This time, the trip was uneventful—no rogue cultivators intercepted him.  

He landed outside Boundary Mountain City and entered its gates. The last time he had passed through the checkpoint, he hadn’t lingered, though his true self, Li Shiming, had visited before, so he was somewhat familiar with the city.  

**Ju Chang Trading House**—a shop affiliated with the Thousand Illusions Sect. This time, he planned to use their channels to cross the pass.  

Inside the shop, the atmosphere was bustling, filled with the clatter of abacuses and the voices of clerks calling out figures.  

Li Yuanba wore a bronze mask, concealing his face—a choice that naturally drew attention.  

Before any clerk could approach him, an elderly Foundation Establishment cultivator stepped forward, waving the clerks away.  

"May I ask what brings you here, fellow Daoist?" the old cultivator greeted with a polite bow.  

"Crossing the pass," Li Yuanba replied curtly, producing his identity jade slip.  

The old man examined the insignia of the Netherworld Sect but said nothing further. He took out a jade token and pressed it against the identity slip for a moment before nodding slightly.  

With a gesture, he led Li Yuanba into a back room.  

"According to the agreement, you may use this pass to cross the boundary once, with a maximum stay of three months in righteous territory. You must not practice demonic techniques, kill without cause, or overstay. If you fail to return within three months, the pass will expire," the old man explained, handing over a wooden pass.  

Li Yuanba took it, noting the Ju Chang Trading House’s emblem, his basic information, and the terms of use.  

"A copy of this pass is kept at the Thousand Illusions Sect's checkpoint. Do not attempt to forge it," the old man warned.  

Li Yuanba nodded. The Netherworld Sect's Boundary Mountain Pass was close to the Thousand Illusions Sect's territory, and the two sects had agreements in place to maintain mutual interests.  

These agreements ensured controlled interactions between righteous and demonic factions, preventing unchecked infiltration.  

For example, as a disciple of the Netherworld Sect, Li Yuanba had been granted permission by Elder Jian to cross the pass. He could approach any of the three righteous sects' affiliated shops to obtain a pass, allowing him to exit the Boundary Mountain Pass once and stay in the outside world for up to three months before returning to the Ten Thousand Mountains.  

This system was a compromise—controlled exchanges were easier to manage than unchecked infiltration.  

With the pass in hand, Li Yuanba didn’t have to endure the discomfort of hiding in a cargo wagon.  

At the Netherworld Sect's checkpoint, he easily passed through by presenting Elder Jian's authorization on his identity slip.  

Next came a four-hundred-li neutral zone—a buffer area that was usually safe unless conflicts arose between the two factions.  

For a cultivator, four hundred li was a short distance. Soon, Li Yuanba crossed the zone using his sword flight and descended to the ground as he approached the righteous faction's checkpoint.  

Neither the Netherworld Sect's nor the righteous faction's checkpoints allowed cultivators to fly through—everyone had to submit to inspection on foot.  

Li Yuanba produced his pass. As he passed through, he felt a divine sense sweep over it. The scan didn’t probe his body, lingering only briefly on the pass before withdrawing.  

He walked through a two-hundred-meter-long passage, sensing the energy fluctuations of a formation around him. If he posed a threat, the formation would activate, trapping him instantly.  

Even a Golden Core cultivator wouldn’t escape a formation guarded by multiple Golden Core elders.  

Though Li Yuanba knew he was crossing legally, the oppressive aura of the formation and the unseen gazes made him tense.  

Suddenly, he sensed a hostile presence watching him.  

The observer wasn’t particularly strong—otherwise, Li Yuanba wouldn’t have merely felt the malice without any sense of danger.  

**Venerable Jue Neng** observed the masked cultivator walking through the passage. He recognized him—this was the same man who had slaughtered many of his fellow monks during the battle between the Netherworld Sect and the Thousand Leaves Temple a year ago.  

Jue Neng had participated in that battle and had seen Li Yuanba from afar. Terrified by the sight of him cutting down multiple monks, Jue Neng had fled without engaging.  

For a long time afterward, Li Yuanba had haunted Jue Neng’s nightmares. It had taken him nearly three months to recover.  

Li Yuanba walked through the passage without incident, though the sensation of being watched by multiple Golden Core cultivators made his scalp prickle.  

He reminded himself to avoid unfamiliar Golden Core cultivators unless absolutely necessary—the psychological pressure was too much.  

Once outside the checkpoint, he immediately activated his sword flight and sped away.  

Just as his figure was about to vanish, an Arhat arrived with Jue Neng in tow. But the report had come too late—they couldn’t intercept him.  

Even if there had been a grudge, the other Golden Core guardians wouldn’t have allowed an Arhat to attack a Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator who had entered righteous territory legally.  

While the agreements between righteous and demonic factions weren’t always strictly followed, outright violations required some discretion—the righteous faction didn’t want to be seen as oath-breakers.  

Li Yuanba had deliberately avoided trouble. The moment he sensed hostile scrutiny in the passage, he had guessed complications might arise.  

Now, with the speed of a sword cultivator, catching him would be no easy feat.  

---  

Meanwhile, Li Shiming had initially planned to head straight to the Thousand Illusions Sect. But after discovering the Eternal Blossom, he changed his mind.  

First, he visited a market to gather the remaining ingredients for the Eternal Pill. The other herbs weren’t particularly rare, and he found them all after visiting just two shops.  

On his flying boat, he set a course for a mountain within the Thousand Illusions Sect’s territory, where he would rendezvous with his avatar, Li Yuanba.  

He then took out an ancient jade slip he had purchased from the Hang Clan’s market. The data inside had long been imported into the IBMz15, and after extensive analysis, he had finally deciphered it.  

The jade slip’s contents were encrypted—a method nearly impossible for cultivators to crack. But after repeated calculations by the IBMz15, patterns had emerged.  

The slip contained a cultivation method called the **Five Tones Qi Refining Art**. To be honest, Li Shiming was disappointed.  

Given his status in the Mount Shu Sect, he could easily access even the most powerful cultivation methods available.  

Though his current **Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art** wasn’t as high-tier as Li Yuanba’s **Sword Intent Soaring Art**, its compatibility with him mattered more than its grade.  

His master, Elder Su, had abandoned the idea of switching him to a stronger method after learning of his natural affinity for the Thunderstrike Art.  

The Five Tones Qi Refining Art wasn’t even complete—it only went up to the Golden Core stage, with the rest damaged or missing. This further diminished its value, leaving it as little more than a reference.  

However, the jade slip also mentioned an ancient sect called the **Five Elements Sect** and included a map of its location.  

It was unclear how old the Five Elements Sect was. When Li Shiming had the IBMz15 compare the ancient map to modern ones, he found significant discrepancies.  

If he had tried to match them manually, he likely wouldn’t have succeeded—maps of this world weren’t precise to begin with, and the ancient map’s vague descriptions made comparisons even harder.  

The IBMz15 had collected maps from both the Netherworld Sect and Mount Shu Sect, combining them into a relatively complete map of Northern Shu Continent.  

Additionally, the IBMz15 was compiling a more accurate three-dimensional map, adding terrain data from every place Li Shiming visited.  

Though the new map was far from complete, the existing data was enough for the IBMz15 to identify similarities with the ancient map and deduce the possible location of the Five Elements Sect.  

Surprisingly, the sect’s former site wasn’t on the continent—it was now submerged in the ocean, three hundred li offshore.  

Without the IBMz15’s verification, Li Shiming wouldn’t have believed it.  

On the ancient map, the Five Elements Sect had clearly been inland. How could the terrain have changed so drastically?  

"Perhaps it wasn’t a natural change," Li Shiming mused.  

This world had cultivators capable of moving mountains and emptying seas. Perhaps Northern Shu Continent had once been reshaped by a battle between supreme experts.  

Even Core Formation cultivators avoided fighting on land, preferring to take their battles to the Thirty-Three Heavens to minimize collateral damage.  

Since he was already outside, Li Shiming considered visiting the ruins of the Five Elements Sect.  

This wasn’t the same as exploring a hidden cave—those were left behind by individual cultivators, often booby-trapped to deter intruders.  

The Five Elements Sect’s ruins, however, were likely little more than rubble by now. He wasn’t expecting any major discoveries—just a chance to witness a piece of history.  

After so many years, with even the continent’s geography altered, finding any remnants of the sect would be a miracle.  

The Five Tones Qi Refining Art wasn’t entirely useless. Its insights into the five elemental forces deepened Li Shiming’s understanding of them.  

This was another reason for his interest in the Five Elements Sect’s ruins. He also wanted to see what kind of power had destroyed it.  

---  

Li Yuanba traveled for three hours, his mood gradually lightening. He thought he had finally shaken off any potential trouble.  

Then, he suddenly turned his head, sensing a Golden Core-level aura rapidly approaching from behind.  

He immediately pulled out the wooden pass and scanned it with his divine sense. Only then did he realize it was made from a spirit-wood that blocked divine sense, hiding an embedded formation.  

The formation wasn’t active by default—it only triggered after crossing the checkpoint.  

Even with his knowledge of formations, Li Yuanba hadn’t noticed anything unusual about the pass until now.  

As he examined it, Li Shiming’s consciousness linked with him, and the IBMz15 analyzed the pass through his divine sense.  

The subtle fluctuations and spiritual energy patterns confirmed that the pass contained a tracking formation, emitting a signal detectable within the righteous faction’s communication network.  

As long as he remained within their surveillance range, his location would be exposed.
