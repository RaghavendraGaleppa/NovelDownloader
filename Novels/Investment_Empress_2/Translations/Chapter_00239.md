# Chapter 239: The Autumn Festival Invitation from the Ice Cube

In the woodshed of the tavern.

"Hehehe..."

"I'm going to see the God..."

Li Mo heard Chang Bolong's roar from a distance. The man not only looked miserable, but his mental state also seemed to have deteriorated. His expression was devout, and he was muttering nonsense to himself.

"The martial arts of the Demon Summoning Sect really are bad for the brain," Li Mo sighed softly.

Chang Bolong's mind was already unstable to begin with. Now, seeing the culprit behind his downfall, Li Mo, walk into the woodshed together with Ying Bing, his emotions flared up even more. He looked like a madman, his tone full of venom.

"You will die! Stealing the God's child, you will die a horrible death!"

Xue Jing said helplessly, "Little Mo, even I can't cure this."

"He wasn't too bright to begin with, and he took a hammer to the back of his head from you."

"Yeah, I should have held back a bit," Li Mo nodded.

Everyone felt something was a little off about that statement.

Holding back when using the Divine Combat View to look at his Inner Landscape?

But coming from Junior Brother Li, it didn't seem to be a problem.

"Should we just close the door and let Shang Wu handle him?" Qian Bufan suggested.

"Cough, he doesn't deserve that..."

Li Mo coughed lightly. A strand of moonlight shimmered behind him, and with a casual point of his finger, it was cast over Chang Bolong.

The information from his Heaven's Mandate Divine Eye wasn't always comprehensive. He only knew Chang Bolong's basic information but didn't know what the Demon Summoning Sect was plotting.

Since Chang Bolong was rambling nonsense, Li Mo decided to calm him down first and ask for the details.

The pale radiance enveloped Chang Bolong, and he immediately quieted down. He had been about to spit some vicious curses, but they suddenly got stuck in his throat. His eyes became much clearer.

"Hehe."

Chang Bolong was no longer insane, but the venom and killing intent in his eyes remained undiminished. The Great Yin's clear radiance could only calm one's mind and soothe emotions; it obviously couldn't make someone abandon their killing intent and hatred.

"You said a 'God.' What is that thing?" Li Mo asked.

"Bold! How dare you call the God a 'thing'!"

"So, the God isn't a thing?"

"You're the one who isn't a thing!"

Chang Bolong's eyelids twitched wildly, and his expression turned to one of terror. "The God is an omnipotent being. He knows everything in the world. One day, he will truly descend upon this world and take his believers to the Heavenly Realm..."

Everyone frowned.

Cultivators focus on refining themselves. But Chang Bolong had clearly lost his sense of self, deifying some unknown existence as a god. No wonder his soul was so scattered.

"Why did you take Mu Rongxiao? What use is he to you?" Li Mo looked at the 'Buddha statue' on the side.

Mu Rongxiao seemed to be in a state similar to hibernation, and on top of that, his Golden Bell Shield technique had reached a certain level of proficiency. If you shaved his head and changed his clothes, he could pass for a Buddha statue without any违和感...

"Naturally, to serve as a vessel for the God's descent."

"His will will soon be upon you... You will surely..." Chang Bolong's voice grew softer and softer.

Li Mo was curious. Was there really an existence like a god in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands?

"You say this God is all-knowing and all-powerful?"

"Of course," Chang Bolong revealed a sneer of someone at death's door.

"Then is there anything he can't pick up?"

"Even the stars, the sun and moon, the heavens and earth, are all but in the palm of his hand..."

"Can he then create something that he himself cannot pick up?"

"He can... wait, no..."

Chang Bolong's eyes suddenly widened, flashing with confusion. He suddenly felt his head itch.

And so, Chang Bolong died with his eyes wide open.

"He was already stupid, and you, child, are just..." Xue Jing said exasperatedly.

Li Mo gave an embarrassed smile. He had just asked on a whim. He wasn't really curious about what the Demon Summoning Sect wanted to do or what would happen in the Southern Frontier.

He just wanted to stay within the territory of the Clear Abyss Sect and farm for rewards. The Southern Frontier had the Prince of the South; it wasn't something a Divine Combat Realm cultivator needed to worry about.

Anyway, Mu Rongxiao had been found back. Although he was still in a deep slumber due to his bloodline, he would wake up eventually.

In Li Mo's mind, this little episode wasn't as important as the Autumn Festival.

...

Several days later.

---

The fallen leaves in the courtyard were piling up higher and higher. The festive atmosphere grew stronger, and the entire tavern was decorated with lanterns and colorful banners.

After some discussion, everyone decided to return to the Purple Sun Mansion after the Autumn Festival.

The girl's black hair was tied into a ponytail that hung over her shoulders as she swept the courtyard. From time to time, she would look up towards the tavern's kitchen.

What kind of meal would he make today?

If they went to the Southern Frontier, it would be a long time before she could taste these familiar flavors again.

It was better to leave sooner rather than later...

Actually, for her, being alone was the norm. In her past life, she had always been by herself. But for some reason, the thought of going to the Southern Frontier alone felt... unfamiliar?

"Ice Cube."

Suddenly, a voice sounded not far away.

Ying Bing looked up and saw the boy standing at the entrance of the brightly lit kitchen.

"Hm?"

"Come see my latest creation!"

Li Mo waved at her mysteriously.

Ying Bing walked into the kitchen and saw many different kinds of mooncakes on the table. She raised her eyebrow slightly and picked one up.

On the round mooncake, a chibi-style drawing of Little Li was clearly engraved.

"Your creation is... engraving yourself onto a mooncake?"

"Cough, cough, of course not!"

Li Mo said proudly, "As everyone knows, if you don't take a bite, you'll never know what's inside the mooncake. This means many mooncakes are assassins! By engraving the corresponding pattern, it's much easier to tell them apart."

So why not just write the characters?

Ying Bing found it amusing. "So, what flavor are you?"

"You'll know if you try it."

As he spoke, Li Mo picked up a snow-skin mooncake next to him. The drawing on it wasn't of the Ice Cube. This was probably the mooncake that least needed a human portrait, yet it was drawn exceptionally well.

He took a bite of the snow-skin mooncake, biting off the leg of the chibi Ying Bing, and then looked at her with a smile.

Ying Bing frowned slightly, lowered her eyes for a moment, and took a bite of Little Li's head.

It was lotus seed paste?

"Is it good?" Li Mo asked, seeing her take such a big bite.

"Mm."

"Then try some of the others."

And so, Ying Bing picked up the mooncakes one by one, her cheeks moving softly as she savored each one carefully.

The lamplight was warm and yellow, not particularly bright. Perhaps this was how the nights in every ordinary household were, a mix of light and shadow.

Li Mo looked at Ying Bing's jade-like face.

Perhaps it was an illusion, but he suddenly felt that she had changed a bit recently, becoming much more down-to-earth.

From the cold exterior and overbearing inner nature of the Empress of the Phoenix Heaven, she had become a true childhood friend-like figure. If he weren't so used to calling her Ice Cube, he would have wanted to change his nickname.

Moreover...

Had the Ice Cube been worried about something lately?

As he watched Ying Bing finish the last type of mooncake, Li Mo asked casually, "Ice Cube, which one do you like the most?"

"Li Mo."

"Huh?"

"I'm talking about the mooncake."

Li Mo was a bit stunned. The mooncake with his picture was lotus seed paste, so she could have just said lotus seed paste. Why did she suddenly call his name...

But before he could react, he saw the girl's gaze shift back to him. The candlelight flickered in her eyes like a tiny flame.

"I heard the streets of Yunzhou are very lively during the Autumn Festival. I'm not really curious about it, but..."

"I'm especially interested!"

"If I can't see it, I feel like I'd regret it for the rest of my life."

Li Mo, who currently had no thoughts of being a genius, said very seriously, "Then we have to go."

"Mm."

Ying Bing's fair fingers lightly twirled the end of her hair as she said softly, "If you insist on going, I'll just go take a look while I'm at it..."
