# Chapter 53: Li, the Great Philanthropist, Mo? Cui Peng Appears, the Stuttering Sister (1/2)

The next morning.

Li Mo woke up early to find the Murong estate bustling with activity, with servant girls and boys coming and going.

When he reached the entrance, he saw Old Master Murong personally directing the workers.

"Li Xiao you, you are awake."

Murong Hai turned around, his face showing no signs of the heavy intoxication from the previous day.

"I have already mobilized grain from the Hengtong Mercantile Guild. We can set up the charity hall today."

"Thank you for your trouble."

Li Mo took out the prepared silver notes from his sleeve.

"Since we are following the family precepts to perform charity, we cannot be generous with others' resources. I hope the Old Master will not refuse."

"It is already a great favor to rely on the Murong family's reputation and manpower."

As for the investment feedback, of course, he would handle it himself.

Silver was the one thing he never lacked.

"Xiao you is kind-hearted, making this old man feel ashamed."

Murong Hai nodded and stopped a passing steward.

"Go and call Xiao Xuan to help."

"Also, send someone to make an announcement in the city. Hmm... let Xiao Xuan go."

"Yes."

...

That day.

In the streets and alleys of Ziyang Prefecture City, a person was beating gongs and drums, drawing the attention of many.

"Disciple Li of the Qingyuan Sect has descended the mountain to distribute alms! Wanderers can line up to receive porridge and rice! The location is at the Murong Estate!"

Murong Xiao shouted with a loud voice, his face red and neck thick with excitement.

Well...

Actually, Li Mo had no intention of making a name for himself.

It was just that Murong Xiao couldn't wait for the whole world to know that his brother Li was a good-hearted man.

The first half of that sentence was his own addition.

From a small tavern nearby, voices of discussion rose.

"A true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect?"

"I have some impression of that name. Isn't he the one who obtained the Mystic Weapon?"

"Did he perhaps accept a sect mission to descend the mountain and relieve the disaster victims?"

At the corner by the tavern entrance.

Watching Murong Xiao's retreating figure, a skinny beggar with a disheveled appearance slowly raised his head.

No one noticed the fierce light shining from beneath the weeds-like hair.

"Qingyuan Sect... True Disciple Li."

"Setting up a porridge stand to distribute alms, specifically inviting wanderers and beggars to come. Has my whereabouts been leaked?"

Cui Peng's eyes flashed with a chilling light, and killing intent surged within him.

It was reasonable for the Qingyuan Sect to issue a mission to arrest him.

But it was somewhat strange.

He only disguised himself as a beggar after arriving in Ziyang Prefecture City. There was no reason for anyone to know.

Yet, the other party immediately started distributing porridge upon arriving.

It looked as if they were targeting him.

"Li Mo, the newly promoted true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect, who only joined the sect not long ago."

"A Qi Blood Realm cultivator dares to accept the mission to arrest me? What audacity! It seems he relies on the Murong family's help, viewing me as a turtle in a jar."

"Is the Qingyuan Sect trying to use me as a whetstone for their true disciple?"

"Hmph... I wonder if the knife will break during sharpening."

Cui Peng's eyes grew increasingly fierce.

The short knife in his robe felt scalding hot, and he couldn't help but grip the hilt.

He practiced the Blood Blade Technique. With every additional soul claimed by his blade, his swordplay became sharper.

At first, he practiced secretly.

Later, when discovered by his fellow sect brothers, he killed them to silence them.

Who knew that the matter would be exposed, turning him into a rat running from the streets.

"I am now cornered with no way out."

"The only way out is to join the Drizzle Pavilion."

"If I can offer the head of this Qingyuan Sect true disciple as a pledge, perhaps I can avoid the Unending Trial..."

That's right.

Cui Peng planned to join the Drizzle Pavilion and become an assassin.

Coincidentally, the martial art he practiced was born for killing.

The head of a Qingyuan Sect true disciple and a Mystic Weapon long sword were enough for him to enjoy high treatment after joining.

Of course, this matter had to be approached slowly.

For now, he didn't even know the other party's background.

"He probably only knows I've disguised myself as a beggar, but doesn't know my exact location."

"I am in the shadows, he is in the light."

"Fool, trying to lure me out, but making himself the target of everyone's attention..."

"Hahaha... Let's see who ends up walking into the trap."

Cui Peng stood up and walked toward a small beggar ahead.

He patted the little beggar's back, and the other party turned around.

"What is it?"

The little beggar turned back, looking at him with vigilance.

"You are going to the Murong Estate to get porridge and rice, right?"

"Yeah, if you want to go, go yourself. I don't have time to help you."

The little beggar shook his head repeatedly.

"I don't want porridge or rice."

Cui Peng suppressed the killing intent in his eyes, trying to appear as amiable as possible, and took out a string of copper coins.

The little beggar's eyes fixed on it, revealing a look of desire.

"When you go to receive the porridge, just touch the corner of that Qingyuan Sect true disciple's robe with your hand, and this string of coins is yours."

---

"If you go back to Dongcheng Nijiao Alley and tell me what he looks like, I'll give you another string."

On the copper coins, he had applied a special incense.

Only specially trained rats could smell it.

"Alright!"

The little beggar took the money and happily ran off.

...

In front of the Murong Estate.

In front of the charity hall set up with a bamboo shed, a long line was formed. Among them were mostly ragged people with sallow faces, including wanderers and poor commoners.

"Wow, the porridge is so thick!"

"Not only can we get porridge, but we also get a small bag of rice. Wait... there's even half a salted fish!"

"Tsk tsk... I thought that True Disciple Li was just showing off to build a reputation, but I didn't expect him to be so genuine."

"So what if he really wants to earn a reputation? We still got real benefits."

"Don't talk nonsense. He is personally handing out supplies over there, and he's letting all the beggars line up at his place."

...

The discussions continued without end.

Inside the porridge shed.

Li Mo was busy like a spinning top. He had to personally distribute the porridge and rice, while also observing with his Destiny Divine Eye.

He was also puzzled.

He only said he wanted to perform charity; he didn't announce his identity.

How did everyone seem to know who he was?

It was foreseeable.

After today, he would likely become a well-known great philanthropist in Ziyang Prefecture City.

"Who exactly told them that I opened this charity hall?"

Li Mo handed out the supplies and turned his head.

"Brother Murong, do you have any idea?"

"I... don't... know..."

Murong Xiao's voice was hoarse. It took him a long time to finish the sentence.

Li Mo shook his head and scooped up more porridge with a bowl.

At the same time, he activated the Destiny Divine Eye:

[Name: Lu Ning]
[Age: 21]
[Root Bone: None]
[Realm: Mortal]
[Destiny: Gray]
[Evaluation: Ambitious but incompetent]
[Recent Events: Originally from a well-off family, he secretly left home to do business but lost all his money and was too ashamed to return, so he became a beggar in the city.]

He handed a small bag of rice to the beggar who was deliberately hiding his face.

Li Mo sighed softly. "Go home early. Bowing to your family is better than bowing for five pecks of rice."

The man's hand trembled as he took the rice bag and thanked Li Mo softly.

"Have you seen a beggar with a chest injury, bright eyes, and a stutter?"

"Replying to Great Philanthropist Li, I haven't."

"Alright, you may go."

Little Li was a bit worried.

Throughout the morning, he had seen quite a few beggars.

There were those pretending to be poor to get charity rice, and those who failed the imperial exams on their way to the capital. He had seen all sorts of life's struggles.

But the person he was looking for remained nowhere to be seen.

Could it be that the little beggar isn't mingling with the other beggars?

Or could it be that the Ice Cube's information was wrong?

Just as he was thinking this...

"Thank you, Great Philanthropist Li."

He looked down.

A skinny little beggar, about seven or eight years old, stood there timidly.

"Can you carry the rice?"

"Mm-hmm."

When handing the rice bag over, Li Mo noticed a small paw print on his clothes.

He looked at the little beggar again, who was biting his lip and closing his eyes, as if preparing to endure a beating.

"It's fine, I'll wash it later."

Li Mo couldn't help but laugh.

"You... are really a good person..."

"Have you seen a beggar who stutters, has bright eyes, and a chest injury?"

Li Mo asked casually.

"Huh? Do you know the Stuttering Sister?"

The little beggar's eyes widened.

"Stuttering Sister?"

Li Mo's eyebrows twitched.

He was about to ask further.

But the little beggar suddenly covered his mouth, as if he had made a mistake, and ran into the crowd in a panic.

However, his information was detailed in Li Mo's Destiny Divine Eye:

[Name: Meng Can]
[Age: 7]
[Root Bone: None]
[Realm: Mortal]
[Destiny: Black]
[Evaluation: Like a wild weed, a life thinner than paper. Although he has met a noble person, he does not have a noble fate.]
[Recent Events: The Stuttering Sister is sick. He went out to beg alone and encountered the notorious bandit Cui Peng. Unknowingly, he left a mark for Qingyuan Sect true disciple Li Mo, and is about to be silenced.]
