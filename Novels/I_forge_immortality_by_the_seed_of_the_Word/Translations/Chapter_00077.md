# Chapter 76: Selling Everything to Raise Funds

In the trading chamber.

The sound of faint gasps echoed intermittently.

As the pile of purified demon cores of various grades grew larger on the table before him, the composed expression on the elder's face gradually faded.

He couldn't help but glance at Zhang Jing, who was still steadily retrieving demon cores from his storage space, feeling a mix of surprise and excitement rising within him.

If he could purchase all these purified demon cores, the commission alone would amount to nearly a hundred Dao Merits.

More importantly.

Having worked here for decades, his discernment had become exceptionally sharp.

All signs indicated that the team behind this junior brother must possess some method to purify the lingering demonic thoughts from these cores.

If they could establish a long-term partnership, he might as well be counting Dao Merits in his sleep.

"Senior Brother, could you appraise these purified demon cores and tell me how many Dao Merits they're worth?"

Zhang Jing's voice snapped the elder out of his thoughts.

His body jerked slightly as he refocused his attention on the numerous demon cores.

"Junior Brother, please wait a moment while I tally them," the elder said, suppressing his excitement and maintaining a courteous tone.

Without further ado, and ignoring Zhang Jing's gaze, the elder extended a slightly trembling hand and began meticulously counting the demon cores on the table, one by one, not daring to be the least bit careless.

After the time it took to drink a cup of tea.

The elder exhaled deeply and spoke earnestly:

"Junior Brother, among these, there are ninety-five demon cores from the early Qi Refinement stage: twenty-three from the first level, forty-seven from the second, and twenty-five from the third.

"Additionally, there are nine demon cores from the mid-Qi Refinement stage.

"In total, these one hundred and four purified demon cores are worth three thousand one hundred and fifty Dao Merits. Does Junior Brother have any questions?"

This time.

Contrary to his usual practice of bargaining down the price, the elder had, within the limits of his authority, offered the highest possible purchase price.

Although this would reduce his own commission, the elder didn't hesitate in the slightest.

To foster a long-term partnership, it was only right to show sincerity.

On the other side.

Zhang Jing nodded slightly, a trace of imperceptible surprise flashing in his eyes.

The price offered was over a hundred Dao Merits higher than what he had estimated before coming here.

This was an unexpected boon.

"Senior Brother, let's go with the price you suggested."

He showed no outward sign of his inner thoughts.

As soon as he finished speaking.

The elder promptly collected the demon cores from the table and reminded him with a smile, "Junior Brother, please hand me your identity jade token so I can transfer the Dao Merits to you."

"There's no hurry. Senior Brother, could you also appraise these spirit herbs for me?"

As he spoke.

Zhang Jing took out another batch of spirit herbs from his storage space and placed them on the table.

A rich, medicinal fragrance instantly filled the chamber.

The elder's pupils contracted slightly.

Time passed slowly.

"Junior Brother, the combined value of the demon cores and spirit herbs totals seven thousand three hundred and fifty-seven Dao Merits. Are you certain you wish to sell them all?"

The elder looked at Zhang Jing with a complex expression, his voice trembling slightly.

Today had been an eye-opener.

Never before had he encountered someone selling resources worth over seven thousand Dao Merits in one go.

Just who was this unfamiliar junior brother?

Had his team stumbled upon some ancient ruins or secret realm during a mission? How else could one explain such a haul of spirit herbs?

Wait—ruins?

A method to purify demon cores?

Suddenly, everything clicked into place for the elder.

Meanwhile.

Zhang Jing's eyes betrayed a hint of hesitation.

The rare water-attribute demon core from the ninth level of Qi Refinement, gifted by Senior Sister Liu, was something he intended to keep for his own cultivation in the later stages. Selling it was out of the question.

However, he still faced a shortfall of over a thousand Dao Merits, which wouldn't be easy to make up in a short time.

As for the Divine Spirit Liquid.

Its best use was to exchange it for another ninth-level Qi Refinement demon core, as he had done before.

Otherwise, it would be a waste.

But with the opening of the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven drawing nearer by the day.

Zhang Jing quickly realized.

Between time and profit, he had to make a choice.

Even if the Divine Spirit Liquid could be exchanged for a ninth-level demon core, how long that might take was anyone's guess—perhaps a day, perhaps a month.

His time was precious now, and he couldn't afford to waste it.

"Do you purchase Divine Spirit Liquid?"

Zhang Jing's calm gaze settled on the elder.

Two days later.

Zhang Jing finally bridged the remaining gap in Dao Merits by crafting talismans.

Thus concluded his desperate scramble to raise funds by selling everything he could spare.

In his cave abode.

Zhang Jing flipped his wrist, revealing the faintly glowing violet identity jade token.

Name: Zhang Jing  
Status: Outer Court Disciple  
Dao Merits: 9,183  

Looking at the staggering number beside "Dao Merits," a faint smile tugged at the corners of Zhang Jing's eyes, growing wider until it erupted into a hearty laugh.

He had been waiting for this moment for what felt like an eternity.

In the spirit beast chamber.

Deer Thirty-Eight fiddled with the purple-gold spirit beast ring around its neck, a satisfied expression on its deer-like face.

Now it was completely safe.

Even venturing outside the cave abode was no longer a concern.

But as the saying goes: speak of the devil.

"Thirty-Eight, come out with me."

Zhang Jing's voice suddenly echoed in Deer Thirty-Eight's mind.

This was one of the functions of the extravagant spirit beast ring he had purchased for it.

Originally, Zhang Jing had planned to buy an ordinary spirit beast ring.

But with Deer Thirty-Eight's cultivation on the verge of breaking through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement, an ordinary ring would no longer suffice.

Reluctantly, he had opted for a high-grade spirit beast ring.

Fortunately, it was worth the price.

Otherwise, Zhang Jing would have had to consider persuading Deer Thirty-Eight to earn Dao Merits itself.

For example—

Launching a spirit beast express service between Luodu Island and the Inheritance Pavilion, and between Luodu Island and the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, with one trip per day at premium prices!

After all, a late-stage Qi Refinement spirit beast wasn't meant for paupers to ride.

Under such an arrangement.

Deer Thirty-Eight could earn enough Dao Merits to eventually afford its own cultivation techniques, with Zhang Jing taking only a symbolic ten or twenty percent as commission.

In time.

Deer Thirty-Eight might even save up enough for its future cultivation methods.

Not that Zhang Jing had any ulterior motives.

He merely wanted to instill in Deer Thirty-Eight the noble spirit of self-reliance and hard work!

Perhaps having been cooped up in the cave abode for too long.

The moment Deer Thirty-Eight stepped outside, it began frolicking wildly, unrestrainedly releasing the powerful aura of a near late-stage Qi Refinement beast.

Following Zhang Jing's directions.

Its massive body transformed into a streak of white light, tearing through the wind as it raced toward the Inheritance Pavilion.

Before long.

At the entrance of the Inheritance Pavilion.

The previously bustling crowd fell silent as the colossal beast arrived.

Countless gazes, filled with either fear or awe, involuntarily turned toward Deer Thirty-Eight's imposing figure.

Zhang Jing's eyes swept over the crowd as he dismounted.

"Wait here for me, Thirty-Eight. Don't wander off," he instructed, somewhat concerned.

"And especially be careful around these spirit cranes. Don't step on them."

"Understood, Master."

Only after watching Zhang Jing's figure disappear into the grand palace ahead did Deer Thirty-Eight yawn, carefully avoid the nearby spirit cranes, and settle down in an open space.

Then.

As if annoyed by the numerous eyes still scrutinizing it.

Deer Thirty-Eight abruptly raised its head and glared at the crowd of cultivators staring at it in curiosity.

They were weak—no match for it.

A glance at the gleaming new spirit beast ring around its neck bolstered its confidence.

"What are you looking at? Never seen such a handsome mount before?" Deer Thirty-Eight boldly shouted at the onlookers.

Inside the Inheritance Pavilion.

Zhang Jing scanned the area as if searching for something.

Soon, a young man in a green robe hurried over and asked in a low voice, "Senior Brother, how may I—Brother Zhang?!"

A voice brimming with surprise rang out.

Zhang Jing turned instinctively, then froze in recognition.

"Brother Ji, what are you doing here?"

Ji Bochang grinned.

"Heh, my senior sister thought my cultivation was too low for missions, so she got me a job here at the Inheritance Pavilion."

"Your senior sister is truly considerate!"

Zhang Jing's gaze held a hint of amusement.

This guy had truly mastered the art of living off a woman's favor.

Honestly.

He was dying to ask Ji Bochang's "senior sister" what kind of love potion or sorcery he had used to achieve such an effect.

"Haha, my senior sister is always like this. I'm used to it. I'll introduce you to her someday—she's been curious about you for a while."

Ji Bochang smiled knowingly, his face brimming with pride.

Then, as if remembering something, he asked:

"Brother Zhang, what kind of inheritance are you here to exchange? I can take you there."

He patted his chest confidently.

"Perfect," Zhang Jing said, getting to the point. "I'm here to acquire a top-grade inheritance."
