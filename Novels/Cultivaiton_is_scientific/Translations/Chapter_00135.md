# Chapter 135: Schemes  

"Junior Brother Li, congratulations!" Yu Yong'an handed a jade bottle to Li Shiming.  

Li Shiming hadn't participated in the final auction for the top-grade magical artifact—a defensive item that, in his opinion, wasn't as practical as his Spirit Turtle Shield.  

Given his current strength, infusing it with spiritual power would likely drain him dry before he could even engage in prolonged combat.  

The jade bottle Yu Yong'an delivered contained the Foundation Establishment Pill he had successfully bid for, costing him 123,100 spirit stones.  

To be honest, Li Shiming considered this price quite reasonable—even cheap, by his standards.  

However, in reality, this price far exceeded the usual auction range for such items. Every five years, two Foundation Establishment Pills were auctioned, and every cultivator present knew their approximate value.  

Once the bidding surpassed their psychological threshold, even if they had spirit stones to spare, they wouldn't continue.  

Another reason was Li Shiming's aggressive bidding style—he treated spirit stones as if they were mere pebbles, raising the bid by ten thousand at a time.  

Had it not been for a certain faction deliberately driving up the price, he might have secured it for under 100,000 spirit stones.  

Li Shiming knew exactly who that bidder was—just the surname "Yun" was enough to explain everything.  

He scanned the jade bottle with his spiritual sense. The bottle was specially crafted by the sect to preserve high-grade pills, and the Foundation Establishment Pill lay perfectly intact inside.  

"Senior Brother Yu, I'll transfer the spirit stones to you now," he said, reaching for his storage bag.  

"Junior Brother Li, there's no hurry for the payment. We can deduct it from future transactions. The trading house needs you to provide five hundred 'Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0' units," Yu Yong'an said with a smile, stopping him.  

The Hidden Dragon Trading House's event had been a resounding success. All participants were extremely satisfied, and all two hundred 'Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0' units had been claimed.  

The trading house was now planning weekly small-scale auctions, monthly large-scale auctions, and daily new product showcases.  

Cultivators greatly appreciated this sales model—it was far more secure and eliminated many potential hassles.  

"I'll have the five hundred units ready within three days," Li Shiming agreed with a nod, not insisting on immediate payment.  

He didn't linger with the still-excited Yu Yong'an. Returning to his cave dwelling, he descended directly into the underground space.  

There, he approached a machine—a computer equipped with two CPU chips and 64GB of RAM, functioning similarly to a program-controlled switchboard.  

Currently, all data from 'Thousand-Mile Vision' and 'Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0' passed through this computer before interacting with the sect's grand formation core.  

The group chat feature of 'Thousand-Mile Vision 2.0' was entirely managed by this computer.  

As for data security, all stored information was in hexadecimal format on the hard drive.  

Without specialized knowledge, even if a Golden Core cultivator got their hands on this machine, they wouldn't be able to decipher its secrets.  

Of course, Li Shiming didn't monitor every single chat. The computer's primary function was to serve as a filter—whenever conversations contained certain pre-set keywords, it would trigger an alert.  

This world had no concept of information security. Even in his previous life, hadn
