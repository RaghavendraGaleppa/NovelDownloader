# Chapter 154: Half-step Heavenly Venerate

The King of Gods clutched his ancient golden spear. Originally, he was merely a wisp of residual soul hidden within the divine throne, capable of a single strike. But now, by harnessing the ancient golden spear and the remnants of his past power within the Pantheon, he had imbued this body with the strength to wage war.

*Shimmer!*

He attacked directly. Within his palm, stars rotated, universes shattered, and creation unfolded. He held a universe in his palm, containing countless stars and encompassing all things. With a flick of his wrist, he sought to drag Zhou Changsheng and his companions into it, suppress them, and refine them alive.

*Thump!*

The small gourd in Zhou Changsheng’s hand floated up, Xuanzhenzi’s ancient pagoda hovered above his head, and Yan Mo forcefully gripped his Suppressing Ruler. His body was already crumbling, but he knew he could not retreat now. The three Heavenly Venerate artifacts emitted boundless light, condensing into a single point, shattering eternity. The stars within the massive hand shattered into dust, and even the universe within it was torn apart.

However, Zhou Changsheng and the others were also sent flying backward, vomiting large amounts of blood. The cracks on Yan Mo’s body became even more pronounced, some parts even falling off, revealing a glistening white light within. He was not merely a flesh-and-blood body.

“Half-step Heavenly Venerate!”

Zhou Changsheng’s face was grim, his body trembling uncontrollably. The blood he coughed up was mixed with golden divine substance, which was his true origin. The small gourd in his palm had dimmed, appearing like a common item. The King of Gods was undeniably a true Heavenly Venerate in ancient times. To their surprise, this wisp of residual soul had managed to reach the Half-step Heavenly Venerate realm through various means. Coupled with his absolute combat prowess, they found him irresistible.

They had made many calculations before arriving, even bringing three broken Heavenly Venerate artifacts. But the reappearance of the King of Gods was beyond their expectations; how could a residual soul have escaped the encirclement of several Heavenly Venerates in ancient times?

It seemed they might truly perish here today. Zhou Changsheng’s expression flickered, clearly plotting something.

“Now, at last, is the final moment.”

The King of Gods murmured softly, his hair flowing, each strand sparkling like crystal. His eyes were as deep as a star sea, and the ancient golden spear in his hand emitted dazzling light, divine laws entwined around it, capable of shattering the nine heavens.

The Holy Gods remained silent, assuming the King of Gods was lamenting his impending true dissipation, for after this period, his residual soul would vanish with the wind.

Meanwhile, Zhou Tian, still in the mysterious space, grinned. Only he understood that the old fellow’s words were meant for him. He shook his head and selected the King of Gods as the target for [Cultivation Replication].

Instantly, Zhou Tian’s body, lying on the divine throne, underwent a transformation. A monstrous aura erupted, various Great Dao rules interwoven, as if blending with the Great Dao itself, yet also feeling transcendent of heaven and earth. At the same time, Zhou Tian’s consciousness returned to his body. At this moment, he was a Half-step Heavenly Venerate, from inside to out, from body to soul. The divine throne space could no longer confine him.

It was an indescribable sensation, as if all things in the world were within his grasp. Worlds seemed to be created and destroyed with a mere thought. Zhou Tian felt an immense surge of exhilaration, for it was simply too sublime.

Everyone cast their gaze towards this sudden anomaly. Unlike the ordinary believers, these deities possessed the ability to scour heaven and earth, instantly noticing the change. They had previously discovered a body lying on the divine throne, but knowing of the King of Gods' residual soul within, they dared not overstep. Now, however, they were utterly incredulous.

“It is not the final moment yet, esteemed King of Gods.”

Zhou Tian stood in the void, a faint smile on his lips, his aura vast as an abyss, like a boundless sea, as wisps of immortal mist diffused around him.

“Tian’er?!”

Zhou Changsheng was stunned, hardly daring to believe it. He had just prepared himself for mutual destruction, resolved that even if they died, they wouldn't let the Holy Gods have an easy time, all to buy time for the younger generation. But for Zhou Tian to suddenly appear as a Half-step Heavenly Venerate—it was simply too unbelievable.

“How is this possible!”

The King of Gods was also dumbfounded. Wasn't that just a mortal? In his mind, this was no threat at all; he could kill him with a mere raise of his hand and erase his traces completely. But he only had one chance to strike, and he didn’t want to waste it on a mortal, which was why he hadn't dealt with him. Now, such a drastic change had occurred.

“Die!”

The King of Gods roared, his hair fluttering wildly. He was enraged. If Zhou Tian were truly a mere mortal, he would not have bothered to argue. But now it seemed Zhou Tian was a powerful being, someone with the right to speak to him as an equal. In his eyes, Zhou Tian had just been toying with him, an insult!

He waved a hand, and the Pantheon vanished. They appeared in the outside world; the space within the Pantheon was too small for them to fully unleash their power. A formidable oppressive aura surged forth, and on the battlefield outside, everyone turned their gazes towards them.

“Holy cow, don’t tell me that’s Zhou Tian!”

Zhou Zui tore apart a Saint Spirit, gaping at the figure confronting the King of Gods in the void. His aura was even more terrifying than Zhou Changsheng’s.

“Heavens, how could this guy…”

This was Liu Yan’s voice, her body enveloped in flames, like an empress of fire. Beside her, Tian Ling held a jade sword, unusual light flickering in her beautiful eyes.

The King of Gods advanced with his spear, his eyes as cold as ice, intent on impaling Zhou Tian, personally eradicating the potential danger he had allowed to grow! This was a Half-step Heavenly Venerate, unleashing his full power. The scene was unimaginable, even more terrifying than the creation of heaven and earth.

The very void trembled. The River of Time coiled around his body, and space submerged his form. He seemed poised to tear open this realm and remake the cosmos. His colossal manifestation was unparalleled, unmatched in its might.

*Rumble!*

The King of Gods attacked, and heaven and earth collapsed, even the River of Time threatening to break.

“Come!”

Zhou Tian soared into the sky, his massive Dharma Aspect also manifesting. His body was equally terrifying. This was not some divine ability, but an ordinary means, which Zhou Tian, now a Half-step Heavenly Venerate, naturally possessed. His body stood tall, reaching the heavens, as if the two most colossal war gods in history had collided. It was utterly breathtaking.

Zhou Tian instantly erupted with brilliant light: flames, lightning, the five elements, yin and yang—all kinds of exotic energies swirled, blending together. A hazy, chaotic hue enveloped his fists.

*Boom!*

Between them, the aura of creation and destruction pervaded, and the light of samsara circulated, as if it could truly lead one to rebirth. This was the strange phenomenon brought forth by the great battle.

“Kill!”

As the two clashed, countless divine chains of order intertwined, myriad beams of light erupted, each capable of tearing through the void and becoming eternal. The battle was fierce, incredibly terrifying. The two fought into the sky. With their destructive power at this moment, if they had continued to fight on Mount Myriad Gods, only a handful of people would have survived the aftermath of their clash.
