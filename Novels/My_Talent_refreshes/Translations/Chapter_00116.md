# Chapter 116: Breakthrough in Spirit Refinement Art, Repelling a Foundation Establishment Cultivator

“Summoning us back to the sect?”

Chu Ning and Lu Miaoying were both slightly surprised by this news.

Chu Ning keenly noticed that Lin Changqing hadn't called for Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan, but only himself and Lu Miaoying.

So, he immediately asked, “Deacon, is it just the two of us? Senior Sister Gu and Senior Brother Shen don’t need to go?”

“They don’t need to,” Lin Changqing shook his head. “The sect specifically called for the two of you this time.”

Chu Ning’s brows furrowed slightly, and his heart sank. He instinctively felt that something was about to happen.

His current displayed cultivation was at Qi Refining Layer 5, while Lu Miaoying was at Qi Refining Layer 6. Why would the sect summon two disciples with lower cultivation, while leaving behind Gu Xiaoqing, who was at Qi Refining Layer 8, and Shen Zhengquan, at Qi Refining Layer 7?

Thinking of this, Chu Ning directly asked, “Deacon, did the sect say what it’s about?”

After a year or two, his relationship with Lin Changqing was quite good, and Chu Ning tried to get some information from him.

To Chu Ning’s disappointment, Lin Changqing simply shook his head and said, “No!”

Then, the stoic deacon continued, “The sect’s previous message was to bring you back immediately. I also need to pick up others from two other markets. How about this, you pack up, I’ll pick up the others, and then I’ll come here to pick you up tomorrow morning.”

With that, Lin Changqing turned and left directly.

Chu Ning had expected Lin Changqing might privately transmit something to him, but he didn’t. Lin Changqing left very decisively, leaving Chu Ning full of questions.

Of course, Lu Miaoying, who was beside him, felt the same way.

“Junior Brother Chu, why is the sect summoning us back so urgently?” Lu Miaoying’s expression didn’t change much at this moment; instead, she looked quite curious.

Chu Ning shook his head and said to Lu Miaoying, “Senior Sister Lu, let’s pack our things first. We don't know how long we'll be gone once the sect summons us. I need to make a trip to the spirit field.”

As Chu Ning spoke, he walked out. Lu Miaoying naturally couldn’t stay in Chu Ning’s talisman workshop anymore and also left.

As soon as he stepped out, Chu Ning flew directly towards the spirit field. Along the way, he constantly pondered this strange news. What did he and Lu Miaoying have in common that would cause the sect to summon them? But no matter how much he thought, besides their lower cultivation and both cultivating wood-attribute cultivation methods, Chu Ning couldn’t think of anything else.

Upon arriving at the spirit field, Chu Ning decided to stop thinking about it. Instead, he began to harvest his second batch of ripe Golden Orchid Fruits. This batch had 80 plants, and each plant flowered and bore fruit well, so together he managed to collect 300 fruits.

After picking them, Chu Ning’s gaze fell upon the remaining hundred Iron-stem Orchids and the Gold Essence Fruits that were about to ripen, and he sighed softly. These had also grown Golden Orchid Fruits, but they still needed a lot of time to ripen; picking them now would be useless. And the Gold Essence Fruits still needed about half a month to ripen.

He just hoped that the time spent returning to the sect wouldn’t be too long, so he could come back and pick all these spirit fruits.

At this moment, Chu Ning had no desire to cast any Azurewood Spring Bloom Art. He left the spirit field directly and returned to the market.

When he arrived at his shop, Chu Ning saw Lu Miaoying chatting with Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan across the street. Without even needing to guess, Chu Ning knew that Lu Miaoying must have told them the news.

After a moment of thought, he decided to walk over.

“Junior Brother Chu, you’re here too? Just now, Junior Sister Lu said you’re going back to the sect soon?” Gu Xiaoqing greeted Chu Ning proactively when she saw him approaching.

Chu Ning nodded, then directly took out the spirit field’s restriction token from his storage bag and handed it to Gu Xiaoqing. “Senior Sister Gu, the Gold Essence Fruits in my spirit field will ripen in half a month. I don’t know if I’ll make it back in time. If I don’t, Senior Sister Gu can go and pick all those spirit fruits herself.”

Gu Xiaoqing took the token smoothly, smiled, and said, “Good, I’ve always wanted to see Junior Brother Chu’s spirit field. Now I finally have the chance.”

Seeing that the others still seemed to be in the mood for conversation, Chu Ning had no desire to join them. He said that he still had spirit plants to sort out and manage, bade them farewell, and turned to walk back into his shop.

Seeing this, Lu Miaoying quickly said, “I also need to pack up. I have a lot of spirit beasts to deal with.”

The group then dispersed.

Chu Ning returned to his talisman workshop. He looked around the backyard; since he had just returned a few months ago, there wasn't anything specific he needed to bring. After thinking for a moment, Chu Ning simply dug up the Iron-stem Orchids in his backyard and put them into his storage bag. Since he was returning to the sect tomorrow anyway, he might as well take these Iron-stem Orchids back and plant them in his own courtyard in the sect.

Then, Chu Ning went into his room and took out his talisman-making tools.

At the same time, he checked the proficiency levels in his mind.

[Azurewood Everlasting Cultivation Art (Yellow Tier Low-Grade), Third Layer (961/2100)]
[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Volume, Unbroken Sinews (638/1500)]
[Spirit Refinement Art, First Layer (998/1000)]

His recent cultivation had been quite normal, so the progress in Qi refining, body tempering, and spirit refinement was not slow.

“This Spirit Refinement Art is only a tiny bit short of completing the first layer. I have a night and half a day left; I might as well finish cultivating it.” Chu Ning muttered to himself.

And to increase the proficiency of the Spirit Refinement Art, making talismans combined with the Black Night Ironwood Sword was naturally the most effective.

Chu Ning picked up his talisman brush, made some slight adjustments, and began making talismans. Unlike the talismans on spirit talismans or spell seals he had made before, Chu Ning was now making True Spell Talismans.

The Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, having reached the instant-cast level, could naturally be used to create True Spell Talismans. Thinking that he would let Gu Xiaoqing go to the spirit field, he decided to make some Azurewood Spring Bloom Talismans for her, which could also help him cast the spell on those Golden Orchid Fruits. Anyway, the True Spell Talismans he made with the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art were extremely similar to the Everlasting Spring Talismans. If it weren’t for someone extremely knowledgeable about talismans, they wouldn’t be able to distinguish them immediately.

He made Azurewood Spring Bloom Talisman after talisman, each one successfully. Chu Ning made a full 200 talismans before he felt his divine sense was depleted to a certain extent. Thinking that he needed some time to cultivate the Spirit Refinement Art, Chu Ning decided to take the 200 Azurewood Spring Bloom Talismans and find Gu Xiaoqing first.

Upon hearing Chu Ning’s intention, Gu Xiaoqing readily agreed, chuckling, “Golden Orchid Fruits? This is the first time I’ve heard of such a spirit plant. Junior Brother Chu, don’t worry, I usually don’t have so many talismans to use. This time, I’ll definitely use all your talismans up.”

After a brief expression of gratitude, Chu Ning bought some Fasting Pills and Spirit Essence Pills from Gu Xiaoqing, then turned and returned to his talisman workshop.

Sitting cross-legged on the bed in his room, Chu Ning took out the Black Night Ironwood Sword from his storage bag.

“There’s very little wood spiritual energy left. I hope it can support me to complete this cultivation session.” Chu Ning muttered to himself, looking at the Black Night Ironwood Sword, which had almost reverted to its original wooden state.

Then, he placed it on his lap and began cultivating the Spirit Refinement Art.

At this moment, within his Niwan Palace, the divine sense liquid Chu Ning had condensed was more than ten times larger than before. As Chu Ning cultivated, this divine sense liquid once again formed a vortex, drawing the surrounding gaseous energy into it.

Once he began cultivating, Chu Ning completely forgot about time.

Until a certain moment.

“Drip!”

A sound like a heavy drop of water falling echoed in Chu Ning’s mind. Immediately, Chu Ning suddenly found that the divine sense liquid, which had been suspended in his Niwan Palace, suddenly plummeted. Then, like a giant water ball smashing onto the floor, water droplets splattered outwards.

The divine sense liquid actually dispersed directly, transforming into a hundred smaller droplets of divine sense liquid, forming a sphere within his Niwan Palace.

The next moment, Chu Ning found that his ears and eyes had become incredibly clear. There was a feeling that the entire world was laid out before his eyes.

Divine sense externalization! This was a very large-scale divine sense externalization that allowed for such a clear sensation. Realizing this, Chu Ning immediately began to gauge the range of this externalization. To his slight surprise, the distance was a full fifty zhang!

He could even clearly sense the spirit beast compound, which was separated by a spirit plant compound. In Lu Miaoying’s backyard, several gray spirit rabbits were sound asleep. He could also clearly sense that in the courtyard across the street, Gu Xiaoqing was cultivating in meditation.

“So, the so-called ‘divine sense doubled’ means it doubles based on the divine sense attained when cultivating the first layer to perfection.” Chu Ning was both surprised and delighted at this moment. He finally understood the concept of the Spirit Refinement Art's doubling effect.

“I wonder what a Foundation Establishment cultivator’s divine sense is like? My current divine sense should be no worse than an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator, right? Oh, right, can it be refreshed…” Chu Ning suddenly thought of this question.

He immediately checked the proficiency in his mind.

[Spirit Refinement Art, First Layer (1000/1000)]
[Refresh Talent Ability: Spirit Sealing Art.]

“Spirit Refinement can indeed refresh talent abilities!” Chu Ning was overjoyed at this discovery.

Moreover, to Chu Ning’s surprise, the Spirit Refinement Art refreshed into a talent ability called Spirit Sealing Art, not its自带 (inherent) secret art, Phantom Divine Stab.

At this moment, the Spirit Sealing Art had transformed into Chu Ning’s talent ability. He instinctively knew how to use it and its effects without any explanation. After understanding the contents of the Spirit Sealing Art, Chu Ning’s eyes lit up.

This Spirit Sealing Art was actually a divine sense defensive ability, with two effects depending on the situation. The simplest was that it could block other cultivators’ divine sense probes. The effectiveness of the Spirit Sealing Art in blocking divine sense probes was related to one’s own divine sense strength.

Currently, Chu Ning could block divine sense probes from cultivators whose divine sense was up to twice his own.

The other effect of the Spirit Sealing Art was to resist divine sense attacks, and it could also reflect double the damage back to the caster, causing them to suffer twice the divine sense attack damage. The prerequisite for this was also that the opponent’s divine sense strength did not exceed twice his own. Otherwise, it would only have the effect of resisting and reducing damage.

“If my inference is correct, my divine sense has already reached the level of the early Foundation Establishment stage. To have divine sense twice mine, perhaps only a late Foundation Establishment cultivator could achieve that.” Chu Ning muttered to himself, and the more he thought, the more delighted he became.

This meant that ordinary cultivators below the mid-Foundation Establishment stage would first be completely unable to discover Chu Ning if he wished to block their divine sense probes. And if by some small chance they did discover him and attempted a divine sense attack, Chu Ning’s Spirit Sealing Art would make them suffer twice the backlash damage. Even a late Foundation Establishment cultivator using a divine sense attack, while Chu Ning might not be able to reflect it, could still greatly reduce the damage.

“What a heaven-defying talent ability!” Chu Ning muttered to himself, then thought of the Phantom Divine Stab secret art that came with the Spirit Refinement Art itself.

“Now that I’ve refreshed a different talent ability instead of Phantom Divine Stab, does that mean I can still learn that secret art?” Chu Ning subconsciously wanted to take out a jade slip, but then he stopped. The cultivation of this secret art could wait until he had a chance later.

Moreover, Chu Ning was very cautious about using the Phantom Divine Stab secret art. His divine sense was relatively strong now, but only compared to Qi Refining stage cultivators. Against Qi Refining stage cultivators, he had many means and didn't temporarily need this divine sense attack. Chu Ning felt he wouldn't easily try Phantom Divine Stab until his divine sense was extremely powerful.

Thinking this, Chu Ning prepared to retract his externalized divine sense.

However, at that very moment, Chu Ning suddenly froze, a look of shock appearing on his face. This was because, at this moment, he suddenly discovered that within the range of his divine sense, a figure had appeared in Lu Miaoying’s adjacent room.

Chu Ning hadn’t even had time to react when this black-clad cultivator silently pointed a finger, and a spell struck Lu Miaoying’s body. Without even a chance to resist, Lu Miaoying was instantly pierced through by the spell. All of this happened too quickly, so fast that even if Chu Ning had discovered this cultivator, he wouldn’t have had time to give any warning.

The next moment, this person directly left Lu Miaoying’s room, then actually passed through that courtyard into his own spirit plant house's courtyard, and immediately, headed straight for the talisman workshop's courtyard. And the restrictions between each courtyard posed no hindrance to this cultivator at all.

“A Foundation Establishment cultivator?” Chu Ning suddenly thought of a possibility.

Their respective courtyards all had restrictions, and while these restrictions were not high-grade, only a Foundation Establishment cultivator could break through them so easily. This thought undoubtedly filled Chu Ning with immense shock.

Seeing the other party heading directly towards his own courtyard, and associating it with Lu Miaoying and himself being summoned by the sect, Chu Ning instantly understood many things. His face became incredibly grim.

Without time to think, Chu Ning immediately retracted his divine sense. The aura concealment effect of his Yin Wood Spirit Physique was fully unleashed, and at the same time, he unhesitatingly used the Spirit Sealing Art to block divine sense probes.

The next moment, Chu Ning felt the opponent’s divine sense sweep past. However, under the blocking effect of the Spirit Sealing Art, this person’s divine sense did not discover Chu Ning’s presence.

Although Chu Ning did not externalize his divine sense, his ears and eyes were still exceptionally sharp. At this moment, he heard the cultivator muttering while walking through the courtyard, “How can there be no one? There should be a Qi Refining Layer 5 here.” The person’s voice was hoarse, carrying a hint of doubt.

The next moment, he suddenly turned his head to look in a certain direction.

Chu Ning’s face abruptly changed at this moment; he suddenly realized something was wrong.

Little White Spirit. That little fellow was still in the courtyard.

“Ying!”

Indeed, at the same time, Little White Spirit seemed to have been startled. After letting out a cry of fright, the little creature instinctively dashed straight towards Chu Ning’s room. Little White Spirit was very fast; for a moment, the Foundation Establishment cultivator failed to catch it. However, the Foundation Establishment cultivator quickly gave chase. This made Chu Ning inwardly groan.

He quickly took out several intermediate-grade defensive talismans from his storage bag. The next moment, Chu Ning’s heart stirred. His divine sense, which he had originally retracted, was now directly released, covering the Foundation Establishment cultivator.

At this point, Chu Ning finally sensed the person through his divine sense: a middle-aged man with a mole on his left cheek.

The middle-aged Foundation Establishment cultivator, who had been chasing Little White Spirit, immediately halted his steps upon sensing Chu Ning’s divine sense. The next moment, his face greatly changed.

“A Foundation Establishment cultivator!”

He only whispered a single sentence. The next moment, the middle-aged Foundation Establishment cultivator rapidly turned around and, without looking back, transformed into a black light and fled.

Not until the middle-aged Foundation Establishment cultivator’s figure completely disappeared from his divine sense range, and about a stick of incense’s time passed with no one else appearing, did Chu Ning finally let out a sigh of relief.

That scene just now was incredibly dangerous. Chu Ning saw that this cultivator, despite being at the Foundation Establishment stage, was still acting stealthily, guessing that the other party probably didn't want to alarm others. So, he decided to try releasing his divine sense.

Indeed, the person hadn't sensed Chu Ning earlier, but then suddenly felt Chu Ning's externalized divine sense, thinking that a Foundation Establishment cultivator had appeared. Thus, he decisively chose to leave.

“Fortunately, my Spirit Refinement Art just broke through, and I managed to block his probe from the start, and my divine sense also greatly increased. Otherwise, I wouldn't have been able to sense him from such a distance, let alone scare him away with my divine sense.”

Thinking this, he looked at Little White Spirit squatting in front of him and transmitted a message through divine sense, scolding, “You little rascal, you almost got me killed! Quickly get into the spirit beast pouch.”

Although Little White Spirit looked full of grievance, it seemed to understand the danger just now and Chu Ning’s anger at the moment. Without a word, it immediately钻 (drilled) into the spirit beast pouch.

Chu Ning’s expression was still indecisive. He and Lu Miaoying were just two mid-Qi Refining disciples, yet a Foundation Establishment cultivator came to kill them. Chu Ning knew without thinking that this must be related to today’s sect summons.

Coupling this with some previously obtained information, the identity of this person was almost certain: the Yin Demon Sect!

And the sect’s summons this time must also be related to the forbidden land where that secret mission was located. As for choosing Lu Miaoying and himself, it was highly likely that the disciples needed for this mission were those who cultivated wood-attribute cultivation methods. The standard was even lowered to Qi Refining Layer 5.

Chu Ning quickly guessed the general situation of the entire affair, and his face became exceedingly grim.
