# Chapter 25: Foundation Establishment?

Today's main harvests were the Mask of Concealment and the Lightstep Boots.

The most important among them was undoubtedly the Mask of Concealment!

The reason was simple—it came with a perfected-level spell.

This meant he could directly comprehend and master this spell to perfection.

Moreover, it was a concealment-type life-saving spell, which significantly increased its value.

"Come to think of it, my Wood Elemental Technique is already nearing perfection. The Rain Summoning Spell from the Raindrop Pendant has also reached advanced mastery, and it comes with a perfected-level spell. Adding this Concealment Technique, that means I'll soon have three perfected-level spells?"

At this thought, his heart skipped a beat.

He was no longer a novice cultivator and now understood the importance of perfected spells in the path of cultivation.

The first major hurdle on the cultivation path was Foundation Establishment.

There were many methods to achieve Foundation Establishment.

The most inferior method was using a Foundation Establishment Pill—this would allow one to establish their foundation, but the resulting cultivator would possess no special abilities.

It was purely for advancing one's realm and extending lifespan, though it wouldn't hinder future cultivation progress.

Beyond pill-based Foundation Establishment, there were also methods like using a Lifebound Spiritual Artifact, Talismans, Formations, and even Spell-based Foundation Establishment.

For most people, the most superior method was spell-based Foundation Establishment. By cultivating a spell to perfection, during the Foundation Establishment process, one would achieve a state of communion with heaven and earth, comprehending the Dao essence within the spell. This would allow the spell to evolve into a Divine Ability.

This was also the most crucial life-saving technique for Foundation Establishment cultivators.

If one missed this opportunity during Foundation Establishment, there would be no other chance to obtain an innate Divine Ability in the future.

The difference between a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a Divine Ability and one without was like night and day. It was no exaggeration to say that unless an ordinary cultivator possessed some supreme-grade spiritual artifact, they would stand no chance against a Divine Ability wielder in a battle of the same realm.

Even if the ability was merely an auxiliary one.

Take, for example, the Sect Leader of the Qingheng Sect. Before Foundation Establishment, he had mastered three perfected spells. After establishing his foundation, he became invincible among his peers, and even now, few Golden Core cultivators could rival him.

"So, if I work hard, I'm guaranteed to reach at least the level of our Sect Leader?" Zhang Yan found this hard to believe. What kind of existence was the Sect Leader?

An unrivaled figure across three thousand miles.

The most difficult condition to become such a person had been fulfilled by him almost effortlessly.

He even felt it was... too easy.

"Steady, steady!"

Calming his emotions, Zhang Yan reminded himself that the more promising the situation, the more cautious he needed to be.

For him, stability was paramount.

"Equip the Lightstep Boots!"

With a flash of spiritual light, the Lightstep Boots in his hand disappeared, replaced by the Meditation Mat he had unequipped.

"Lightstep Technique!"

Zhang Yan cast the Lightstep Technique on himself.

As the spell took effect, he immediately felt his entire body grow light. With a slight exertion, he soared into the air.

"This..."

"Is this the perfected Lightstep Technique?"

Zhang Yan was astonished.

With the perfected Lightstep Technique, he could briefly hover and fly.

For ordinary Qi Refinement cultivators, physical flight was nothing short of a pipe dream.

Walking on air had always been the exclusive domain of Foundation Establishment cultivators and above.

Yet now, with the perfected Lightstep Technique, he could float mid-air like a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Suddenly, an idea struck him.

He began swapping his equipment.

He equipped both the Mask of Concealment and the Golden Bamboo Sword.

Though the Mask of Concealment was damaged, once equipped, it could still block others' spiritual sense detection.

The Lightstep Boots' Lightstep Technique allowed him to fly briefly.

Finally...

He extended a hand, and a sword aura shot forth, slicing cleanly through a nearby tree trunk.

The sword aura wasn't particularly powerful, but its momentum was impressive.

More importantly, this wasn't a spell—it was pure sword aura.

And it could be projected outward.

Normally, sword aura could only be unleashed by Foundation Establishment cultivators after converting spells into true essence. While its offensive power paled in comparison to spells, it was a symbol of status.

Thus, with the Mask of Concealment, Lightstep Boots, and projected sword aura, if Zhang Yan claimed to be a Foundation Establishment cultivator, few would dare to challenge him—at least without closer inspection.

Of course, his "Foundation Establishment" was rather flimsy. Any actual combat would quickly reveal his true level.

Still, it served as a decent deterrent.

"Not just that. With the Sharpness trait from the Spirit Hoe, the Sharpness trait from the Golden Bamboo Sword, and the Armor Penetration trait from the Violet Spirit Hammer..."

"Stacking these three equipment traits takes my offensive power to terrifying levels."

"Finally, I have some means to protect myself."

The surge in strength filled Zhang Yan with joy.

He had taken another step closer to the Great Dao of immortality.

At the same time, it reinforced his determination to collect second-hand magical artifacts.

Of course, this had to be balanced with his cultivation. Only artifacts with exceptionally valuable traits would warrant going all out to acquire.

Thus, Zhang Yan settled into a stable routine.

Each day was spent cultivating, comprehending spells, tending to his fields, and dismantling artifacts.

Life was peaceful and unhurried.

In the blink of an eye, two months passed.

During this time, he had dismantled many artifacts in the dismantling yard, but none suited his needs—either the price was too high, or the traits were unsuitable.

As for stealing artifacts from the yard, the thought never crossed his mind.

The reason was simple.

He had no idea if the yard was under surveillance.

If it wasn't, fine. But if it was, getting caught stealing would not only be embarrassing but would also expose his golden finger.

Hardly worth the risk.

More importantly, the Qingheng Sect had always treated him well. He had even met kind seniors like Elder Lin and Mu Sen.

Morally and logically, there was no reason for him to steal from the sect.

Over these two months, his cultivation had progressed steadily.

He had reached the peak of the second level of Qi Refinement. With just a little push, he could break through to the third level.

His rapid progress was largely due to his mastery of the Evergreen Art and the Qi Gathering Pills provided by Elder Bai.

Elder Bai had already visited him twice.

Today would be the third time.

Zhang Yan waited specifically for his arrival—after all, this was his most important client!

Sure enough, before long, a figure appeared in the sky, leisurely riding a flying artifact toward him.

As the figure drew closer, Zhang Yan recognized Elder Bai.

Before even landing, Elder Bai's voice rang out:

"I've brought good news!

This will make you a fortune!"
