# Chapter 42: The Local Emperor's Bait

Yang Can had never visited these manors before, not even after becoming Yu Chengye's chief clerk.

Thus, the village in his imagination was merely what he remembered a village to be. His impression of a landlord was that of a rustic country bumpkin with money.

In reality, however, he suffered from a severe cognitive bias.

In this era, the masters of manors—even in the Central Plains—were not merely country squires. In some parts of the Central Plains, there were also mighty landlords of local tyrant status. And in Longshang, every large manor harbored such a landlord-tycoon.

Here, a "village" was actually a composite of an economic unit, an administrative unit, and a military unit. It was an "independent kingdom" integrating military defense, agricultural production, handicrafts, and administrative rule. How could anyone view it as a simple village?

The landlords here were similar to the powerful local magnates of the late Han and Three Kingdoms periods during the chaos; their strength was immense.

Entering Phoenix Villa, Zhang Yunyi was just a "rustic landlord" who went about burning incense and offering prayers to the Buddha, smiling at everyone he met.

But here, he was the undisputed local emperor.

When Yang Can saw the imposing walled fortress, he was shocked and surprised because his "peacetime" mindset and inherent misconceptions could not match the product of such a special era and geographical location.

Yang Can scrutinized the fortress and said to Zhang Yunyi, "Master Zhang, is this fortress built to guard against horse thieves?"

Zhang Yunyi knew that once the stewards from above came to inspect, it would be difficult for him to "keep his wealth hidden." His manor was truly closed off; with a single word from him, news of major or minor affairs within the villa would not leak out. But it was also truly open, because to his master, this fortress was essentially defenseless.

This was also why he had given Li Youcai particularly heavy gifts when greasing the wheels. Li Youcai had been a steward for many years and understood the ins and outs of these manors; he couldn't play poor in front of the Great Steward Li.

Now that Yang Can was here for inspection, Zhang Yunyi knew that the gift for Yang Can next time would have to be much more valuable than the previous one.

However, he couldn't let Yang Can think he was too wealthy.

Zhang Yunyi said, "Steward Yang, guarding against horse thieves is only secondary. In years of great disaster, refugees running amok cause even greater harm than horse thieves. This fortress is so solid mainly to prevent desperate refugees from causing trouble during disasters."

Yang Can suddenly understood. By now, the drawbridge had been lowered, the great gates were wide open, and the group entered the fortress.

Zhang Yunyi introduced the manor's granaries and workshops along the way, all of which were built inside the fortress. If they encountered a large group of refugees they couldn't resist, the entire village, young and old, would retreat into the fortress to resist.

He was telling Yang Can that this fortress was the final stronghold of the entire Feng'an Manor, not just his own residence.

However, this wasn't a lie; Yang Can indeed saw areas for grain storage, an armory, weaving workshops, wineries, blacksmith shops, and other industrial and even commercial buildings.

Moving further in, like entering the inner city of an imperial palace, there was yet another high wall. Inside this was the Zhang residence.

The vermilion gates of the Zhang residence were half a foot thick elm planks, covered with wrought iron on the outside and studded with copper nails the size of rice bowls. This way, even if an external enemy breached the fortress gates and entered, they would still have to fight through another layer to truly threaten Zhang Yunyi's safety.

Inside the Zhang residence, the ground was paved with bluestones. Upon entering, there was a straight main avenue, with courtyards on both sides connected to this main road by their gates.

At the end of the road was the main house, a five-bay structure with a gable-and-hip roof. On the flying eaves sat a bronze-cast *Xiezhi* beast. Bronze bells hung under the eaves, tinkling melodiously when the wind blew.

Zhang Yunyi and the manor's managers invited Yang Can and his party into the main hall.

Zhang Yunyi said with a beaming face, "Steward Yang, Mr. Li, Miss Qingmei, I have arranged accommodations for you in the residence. Tonight, I will hold a banquet to welcome you and wash away the dust of your journey. Tomorrow, I will accompany you three to inspect the manor's affairs. How does that sound?"

Yang Can nodded and said, "A guest follows the host's arrangements. We shall follow Master Zhang's lead."

Lai Gulun and the others heard this and their faces broke into smiles. They took Yang Can's words as a sign of goodwill and cooperation. It seemed this Steward Yang was a sensible person. As long as you didn't go too far, they naturally wouldn't make things difficult for you. Everyone being happy was the real deal.

Zhang Yunyi said, "It is still early for the banquet. Everyone, please sit. It is a good opportunity to get to know each other."

As he spoke, he gave Lai Gulun a look.

Lai Gulun understood immediately and cupped his fists toward Yang Can, saying boldly, "Steward Yang, I, Lai, am the head steward of Tian'an Manor. Let me report to you on the affairs under my jurisdiction."

While Lai Gulun introduced his responsibilities to Yang Can's group, four young maids in blue dresses entered with tea trays, serving fragrant tea to the guests one by one.

The four serving maids were clearly carefully selected; each had a slender figure, beautiful features, and clear, lively eyes.

Yang Can took the tea cup, idly playing with the tea leaves as he listened to Lai Gulun's introduction. He casually glanced at the serving girls. Truly, the saying that deep mountains breed beautiful birds and firewood huts produce beauties was not false here. Humans, when seeing something beautiful, always take a second look.

It was just a fleeting moment, but Zhang Yunyi noticed it. He immediately gave a look to his housekeeper, who understood and quietly followed the serving maids out.

In Yang Can's original world, a contemporary "Hundred-Mile Supreme" had once said: *Do you know how great my power is? Even if I have a dream, someone will immediately make it a reality!*

And Zhang Yunyi clearly possessed the power to realize dreams. But Yang Can, holding the "Shangfang Sword," now possessed the power to make Zhang Yunyi realize *his* dreams.

The welcome banquet was very lavish, but Zhang Yunyi was a man of great discretion; the规格 of the banquet was just right. It was high enough to make Yang Can's group feel fully respected and treated with courtesy, yet not so excessive as to make them feel that this "rustic landlord" was as extravagant as a master.

After the welcome banquet, Yang Can's group was sent to the central courtyard to settle in. This was a relatively independent courtyard, separated from the rest of the large compound by a high wall. In the courtyard stood two buildings running north-south, with a lotus-filled pond between them connected by a stone bridge.

Yang Can, as the person in charge of this trip, lived alone in the south building.

As soon as he entered the building, two beautiful maids came forward to greet him with graceful curtsies, their voices like warbling orioles.

"Steward Yang, please drink some tea to sober up. The bathwater will be ready shortly."

Yang Can looked closely and found the two girls vaguely familiar. Thinking about it, weren't they the serving maids from earlier?

Yang Can couldn't help but laugh inwardly. Was this manor master a fruit seller by trade? Did he pick out the most presentable girls in the house to be used in any situation? The ones pouring tea with dignity were the same ones serving him in his daily life.

Yang Can smiled and asked, "What are your names?"

"This servant is Sangzhi."
"This servant is Xiaotan."

Sangzhi had a taller figure and wore a moon-white gauze skirt. The hem of her skirt was embroidered with light green cloud patterns, and a silk belt with a satin border was tied around her waist, accentuating her slender waist that seemed as if it couldn't be encircled by a handful. Compared to Xiaotan, she was softer and more beautiful, with superior looks.

Xiaotan, compared to Sangzhi, was more petite. She wore an apricot-red ru shirt, her youthful face already showing a touch of charm. She had a different flavor compared to Sangzhi.

Since their appearances were different, Yang Can could distinguish them easily.

Naturally, he hadn't gotten dead drunk at such a welcome banquet, just slightly tipsy. After sitting and drinking two cups of tea to sober up, Yang Can got up to bathe.

In the bathroom, a cypress wood tub steamed with warm mist, and a few freshly picked fragrant flowers floated on the water surface. Yang Can undressed and stepped into the tub. The water temperature was just right, making him let out a satisfied sigh.

At this moment, Xiaotan, wearing only a small undergarment, walked in barefoot carrying a red lacquer tray. On the tray were bath beans, scented cream, fine linen towels, and other items.

Xiaotan walked lightly to Yang Can's side, curtsied, and said softly, "This servant will assist Steward Yang with his bath."

Yang Can instinctively wanted to tell her to leave; he had never enjoyed such luxurious service before. But the words reached his lips and he swallowed them back.

Where was this? This was Feng'an Manor!

The most prestigious person here was merely a "village chief." If he were to make a fuss over the style of a village chief's household, how embarrassing would that be?

So, Yang Can acted as if he were already accustomed to it. He closed his eyes and leaned back against the rim of the tub.

Seeing that he didn't object, a hint of "just as expected" flashed in Xiaotan's eyes. She placed the wooden tray on a nearby low table. She was already wearing only a small undergarment, revealing two white, tender forearms. She scooped water with a ladle and slowly poured it over Yang Can's shoulders and back.

Then, she took the bath beans and rubbed them in her palms until they foamed, releasing a faint herbal scent. Her hands then landed on Yang Can's shoulders and neck, massaging him with just the right pressure.

Yang Can still kept his eyes closed, looking for all the world like a steward very familiar with this process—calm, extremely calm.

On the surface of the water, there was not a single ripple.

Outside Yang Can's second-floor bedroom, there was a "projected corridor," commonly known as a balcony. Sangzhi, seeing that Xiaotan had entered the bathroom and hadn't been chased out for a long time, smiled beautifully and walked to the "projected corridor" of the bedroom. She hung a tangerine-red lantern on the corridor and leaned against the railing to gaze into the distance. Then, she gracefully returned to the inner room and slid the sliding door shut.

Zhang Yunyi's residence was located behind the main hall where he had entertained Yang Can earlier. It was a courtyard unto itself, a "courtyard within a courtyard." Behind the main hall was actually a high wall; one had to walk to the left or right sides of this wall to find the entrance to the rear residence. Otherwise, anyone seeing this wall would think that behind this main hall was the outermost courtyard wall of the fortress.

Such a deceptive design was, of course, not meant to guard against refugees or bandits attacking the fortress.

Entering this "courtyard within a courtyard," the carved beams and painted rafters were even more exquisite and magnificent than the most luxurious houses in the front.

After Sangzhi hung the lantern on the projected corridor, a servant boy watching from afar hurried into this "courtyard within a courtyard." He was going to report that Steward Yang had already swallowed the "bait" offered by the Manor Master.
