# Chapter 51: Yichuan

Lin Shan and Protector Jiang arrived at the imperial capital, gazing upon the towering city walls that rose over thirty meters high, the moat spanning nearly seven meters wide, rows of arrow towers and crossbow emplacements embedded along the battlements, and massive black bronze cannons stationed at intervals.

Passing through the grand and lofty city gates, they were immediately immersed in the bustling atmosphere of the mortal world. The wide streets teemed with carriages and pedestrians, shoulder to shoulder, with the cries of vendors echoing endlessly.

Teahouses, pleasure boats, taverns, gambling dens, academies, and canals lined the streets. Young masters and ladies moved about with entourages in tow, while high-ranking officials traveled in ornate palanquins carried by eight bearers.

Willow-shaded bridges, painted railings, fluttering curtains, and emerald canopies adorned the city. Markets displayed dazzling jewels, and households overflowed with fine silks—a metropolis of a million homes in harmonious disarray!

This was the political heart of the Great Song Dynasty, where imperial power reigned supreme!

The prosperity and cultural richness of Bianliang City far surpassed anything Lin Shan had witnessed in the southern borderlands. Undoubtedly, many extraordinary individuals lay hidden within its depths.

Protector Jiang, clearly familiar with the city, led Lin Shan through a maze of twists and turns before finally stopping before an imposing mansion in the southern district.

"Marquis Bowang's Residence."

The marquis's estate was magnificent, with towering pavilions, multi-storied buildings, green pines brushing against eaves, and jade railings winding around terraces. It was unmistakably the home of a fabulously wealthy and powerful noble.

Without much explanation, Protector Jiang simply said, "Follow me," and led Lin Shan through a side gate. The estate was staggeringly vast, with courtyards and archways that left one disoriented.

Strangely, despite its opulence, the estate had few maidservants. Instead, they encountered groups of black-clad individuals hurrying about, each seemingly preoccupied with urgent tasks.

Finally, they arrived at a courtyard.

Protector Jiang knocked on the door, and a hoarse voice called out, "Enter!"

Inside, the air was fragrant with sandalwood incense. A white-browed elder, his eyebrows reaching his shoulders, smiled warmly at them.

"I've received the letter. Jiang, this must be Immortal Lin beside you!"

Lin Shan observed the elder—dressed in simple gray hemp robes, his kindly face resembling that of an ordinary old farmer. Despite being a mortal in his nineties, his eyes sparkled with vitality.

Those distinctive long white eyebrows left no doubt—this was undoubtedly the Nightingale's Grand Elder!

Protector Jiang bowed and stepped aside, gesturing toward Lin Shan to introduce him to the elder.

"Greetings, Grand Elder. I am Lin Shan," Lin Shan said with a simple cupped-fist salute.

The Grand Elder invited them to sit, personally pouring tea for Lin Shan before engaging in casual conversation.

Lin Shan handled the exchange effortlessly. Their discussion ranged from the customs of Zangke County and the southern borderlands to the refined culture of the Nine Counties of Jingxiang, and finally to the imperial capital's grandeur. Eventually, the topic turned to the immortal stationed at Nightingale headquarters.

The Grand Elder nodded. "I'll take Immortal Lin to meet Immortal Huang shortly. Fellow immortals will surely have much to discuss."

Lin Shan agreed, in no particular hurry, and inquired about immortal markets.

"Grand Elder, do you know of Yinchuan?"

The elder paused, teacup in hand. Lin Shan understood—the true leader of the Nightingale was privy to some immortal affairs.

"Indeed. You seek an immortal market, don't you? Young people always yearn for the true path of cultivation, not the mundane world's distractions." The Grand Elder chuckled, his long white eyebrows twitching.

But then he cautioned Lin Shan, "Immortal markets aren't as ideal as you might think. Ordinary rogue cultivators struggle to last long there. To settle, one must possess a unique skill.

There are things you may not know."

The Grand Elder proceeded to explain the background of immortal markets, which aligned with the records in the Loose Cultivator of Guangnan's biography. Clearly, many rogue cultivators had tried and failed before reluctantly returning to the mortal world.

Lin Shan nodded repeatedly, claiming mere curiosity.

The Grand Elder cut to the chase: "I'd like to invite you to become a Nightingale patron, with an annual stipend of three spirit stones!"

Lin Shan was taken aback—only three? The Loose Cultivator of Guangnan had received five at the prince's estate!

At his current Qi Refinement sixth layer, was this all he was worth?

The Grand Elder sighed. After receiving Protector Jiang's letter, he had considered recruiting Lin Shan. With their current immortal patron aging, the organization needed a new figurehead.

For major factions, having an immortal patron—regardless of strength—was a status symbol, a mark of prestige and stability.

Assuming Lin Shan was at Qi Refinement third layer, the offer seemed fair. Moreover, their current patron, Immortal Huang, already cost five spirit stones annually. Adding three more would strain Nightingale's resources.

Lin Shan, however, was unimpressed. He had no intention of staying. His goals in the capital were to locate an immortal market like "Yinchuan" and to search for ancient charms.

The Grand Elder's persuasion proved futile, and he reluctantly let the matter rest.

Next, he led Lin Shan to meet the other immortal, briefly instructing Protector Jiang to await assignment.

...

Lin Shan followed the Grand Elder to a side hall in the marquis's estate. When the doors opened, he finally understood why Protector Jiang had been reticent about this immortal.

The hall was brightly lit, with scantily clad dancers performing to the tune of musicians playing bawdy melodies. The atmosphere reeked of decadence.

At the head of the hall, a short, portly man with a goatee sat between two beauties, his hands roaming freely.

The Grand Elder remained impassive, as if accustomed to such scenes. With a wave, the musicians and dancers withdrew.

"Ah! Don't send them away! My beauties—" The goateed man looked crestfallen but reluctantly complied upon seeing the Grand Elder.

Lin Shan was puzzled. This "Immortal Huang" seemed oddly deferential to the mortal Grand Elder. Moreover, his cultivation was only at Qi Refinement third layer!

How could someone so old still be stuck at the early stage? Even with minimal effort, he should have reached mid-stage by now.

The Grand Elder spoke sternly: "How many times must I tell you? With your limited lifespan, you should focus on cultivation, not indulge in debauchery! Do you value your life so little?"

Immortal Huang sighed weakly. "I don't have many years left. Might as well enjoy them."

The Grand Elder shook his head in frustration. This old man had been the same for twenty years—a worthless lecher. If not for Nightingale's need of a figurehead...

"This is Immortal Lin, from one of our branches. You two should exchange insights. And share your experiences about 'Yichuan.'"

Immortal Huang glanced at the white-robed youth behind the Grand Elder. A casual probe made him leap to his feet.

"Mid-stage Qi Refinement!"

The Grand Elder was equally shocked. So young—not even twenty—and already at mid-stage?

Lin Shan remained calm, though inwardly disappointed. Was this the best Nightingale could offer?

The Grand Elder, meanwhile, regretted his low offer. No wonder Lin Shan had been uninterested! He began contemplating reducing Immortal Huang's stipend—the man was beyond redemption anyway.

Lin Shan took a seat and engaged Immortal Huang in conversation.

"Senior, with your years of cultivation, why remain at early-stage?" Lin Shan cut straight to the painful point.

"No need for 'senior'! Your cultivation surpasses mine. Call me Elder Brother Huang, or simply Fellow Daoist," the goateed man replied awkwardly.

"Very well, Elder Brother Huang. Do you know of any immortal markets?" Lin Shan pressed.

Immortal Huang glanced hesitantly at the Grand Elder, aware of his intentions to recruit Lin Shan as a replacement. At the Grand Elder's nod, he replied:

"Yes, in my youth, I spent time in an immortal market called Yichuan, located in the northern Yan-Yun region."
