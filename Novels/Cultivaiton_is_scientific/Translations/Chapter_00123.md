# Chapter 123: Essence Blood  

In an outpost of the Holy Ice Sect near the Heavenly Sea Sect, a Foundation Establishment cultivator was observing two late-stage Qi Condensation disciples.  

This outpost had been established by Elder Baili of the Holy Ice Sect as a permanent base to investigate the disappearance of Baili Jinyan. Normally, two late-stage Qi Condensation disciples were stationed here, overseen by Elder Baili's personal disciple, Kui Yun, a Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Recently, while reviewing intelligence reports from the Heavenly Sea Sect, Kui Yun discovered that Li Shiming—who was supposed to have been killed—was still alive.  

Li Shiming himself wasn't important, but the problem was that Kui Yun had already reported his death to Elder Baili. Therefore, Li Shiming *had* to be dead.  

Elder Baili had personally investigated Qiutan on Changming Island and detected traces of Baili Jinyan's spiritual imprint on Qiutan and his two assistants. Though the imprint had weakened over time, leaving only faint remnants, it was enough for Elder Baili to confirm that Qiutan was someone Baili Jinyan had intended to kill.  

Thus, Elder Baili killed Qiutan and his two assistants, fulfilling his son's unfinished business.  

After extensive investigations, Elder Baili still had many questions about Baili Jinyan's disappearance. The secret technique embedded in Baili Jinyan's body had lost connection but hadn't vanished entirely—this was Elder Baili's last hope that his son might still be alive.  

After capturing Qiutan and his assistants, Elder Baili subjected them to brutal soul-searching.  

Soul-searching was a forbidden technique in the cultivation world, typically used only in cases of deep-seated hatred. The process completely annihilated the victim's soul, preventing reincarnation—an especially cruel punishment. Additionally, the victim endured excruciating pain, which the caster also experienced to some degree.  

However, since Elder Baili's cultivation far surpassed that of Qiutan and his men, he suffered minimal backlash.  

Through soul-searching, Elder Baili learned of Baili Jinyan's encounter with the trio and the gossip they had exchanged. For his son's sake, he decided to eliminate the source of Baili Jinyan's anger—Li Shiming. If his son couldn't have the woman he desired, why should Li Shiming?  

Yin Shilan had a powerful father and a mother who was a notorious demonic cultivator, so Elder Baili could only target Li Shiming.  

However, Elder Baili didn't personally carry out the assassination.  

The main reason was that Li Shiming's Eagle Beak Island was too close to the Nine Peaks. At that distance, Elder Baili would immediately be detected by the Heavenly Sea Sect's grand formation, prompting their elders to intervene.  

After being threatened by the Demon Lord Ren, Elder Baili had no desire to provoke either the Heavenly Sea Sect or the Profound Nether Sect.  

To most Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment cultivators, the Heavenly Sea Sect and the Profound Nether Sect were mortal enemies. However, Golden Core cultivators and a select few Foundation Establishment disciples privy to sect secrets knew the truth—their conflicts were carefully controlled to hone their disciples' combat skills while keeping the battles manageable.  

Without danger, cultivators would become nothing more than weaklings who only knew how to meditate. True strength came from countless battles, forging cultivators capable of surviving the ruthless world of cultivation.  

In the face of Golden Core-level threats, the Heavenly Sea Sect and the Profound Nether Sect could quickly unite.  

Thus, killing Li Shiming became a simple reward mission assigned to late-stage Qi Condensation disciples of the Holy Ice Sect.  

The disciples completed the assassination effortlessly and received Elder Baili's rewards. Kui Yun, the Foundation Establishment cultivator overseeing the mission, was responsible for verifying its completion.  

"Falsely claiming rewards—do you know the consequences?" Kui Yun growled, his face dark.  

The two Qi Condensation disciples paled, well aware of Elder Baili's ruthless methods.  

"Senior Uncle Kui, how were we supposed to know the spirit farmer on the island wasn't Li Shiming?" one disciple protested helplessly.  

Indeed, the mission location was correct, and the target was a mid-stage Qi Condensation spirit farmer. Using the sect-provided formation-breaking talisman, they infiltrated Eagle Beak Island and killed a cultivator performing spirit farming techniques.  

The location and target description matched—they had no reason to suspect they'd killed the wrong person.  

Even Kui Yun hadn't investigated thoroughly. A mere fourth-level Qi Condensation cultivator wasn't worth a Foundation Establishment cultivator's attention—dead was dead.  

Only when recent intelligence mentioned a rising junior formation master named Li Shiming did Kui Yun recall the matter.  

"Here's another formation-breaking talisman," Kui Yun said coldly. "Go back and finish the job properly this time. No mistakes."  

He winced inwardly—this talisman came from his own stash, not Elder Baili's resources.  

The two disciples quickly assured him, "Thank you, Senior Uncle! We won't fail again!"  

Unbeknownst to Li Shiming, the fallout from Baili Jinyan's disappearance was far from over. Half a year had passed, and he assumed the Holy Ice Sect's investigation had concluded.  

After all, Eagle Beak Island had remained peaceful all this time.  

Currently, Li Shiming was using his spiritual sense and consciousness to thoroughly examine his clone.  

The clone's aura had completely transformed, erasing all traces of Baili Jinyan. Combined with its altered appearance, it was now an entirely different person.  

However, when Li Shiming channeled his consciousness into the clone to practice the *Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique*, he detected an unusual spiritual energy within its body.  

Initially, the clone's weak spiritual sense hadn't picked up on it, but as the clone's spiritual sense grew stronger, the anomaly became more pronounced.  

Moreover, the clone's spiritual sense improved at an alarming rate—even faster than his main body's.  

Dividing the clone's body into dozens of sections, Li Shiming meticulously scanned each area at a micrometer level.  

Finally, he found the source—a drop of essence blood in the clone's heart.  

Though the blood appeared normal, his spiritual sense detected a faint, discordant aura. Had the clone retained its original aura, he wouldn't have noticed anything amiss.  

But now, the essence blood's aura, though extremely faint, stood out starkly against the clone's transformed energy.  

Unable to identify the exact nature of the spiritual energy within the blood, Li Shiming decided to have the clone continue practicing the *Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique*, as the anomaly only manifested during cultivation.  

As the technique activated, the essence blood released pure spiritual energy, enhancing the clone's spiritual sense.  

Li Shiming finally understood—this seemingly ordinary drop of blood was the source of the anomaly.  

He had no idea how this essence blood had aided Baili Jinyan's cultivation, and with his current level of understanding—even with the help of his computer room and IBMz15—he couldn't decipher its secrets.  

Unbeknownst to him, this was a father's selfless gift to his son. Elder Baili had used a secret technique to infuse a drop of his own Golden Core essence blood into Baili Jinyan's body.  

Normally, a Golden Core cultivator's essence blood would instantly overwhelm a Qi Condensation cultivator's body, even one as resilient as Baili Jinyan's *Sword Demon Secret Code*-enhanced physique.  

But Elder Baili's technique had tempered the blood's potency, allowing it to reside safely within his son.  

This essence blood had elevated Baili Jinyan's already exceptional talent to unprecedented heights among Qi Condensation cultivators. Had he continued suppressing his cultivation to maximize his spiritual vortex before breaking through, he would have laid the most formidable foundation for his future cultivation.  

Frowning, Li Shiming considered his options.  

First, he could attempt to extract and destroy the essence blood. But he lacked the confidence—he could barely examine it, let alone remove it safely. Mishandling it might destroy the clone or even his computer room.  

Second, he could leave it be and let the blood deplete naturally.  

The *Ice Heart Jade Mind Technique* drained spiritual energy from the blood with each use. Given time, the essence blood would exhaust itself.  

But this meant delaying the clone's deployment outside the computer room.  

"Sigh. No pain, no gain," he muttered resignedly.  

At least identifying the problem eased his mind.  

From the moment he acquired the clone and saw the treasures in its storage bracelet, he knew trouble would follow.  

And it had—fortunately, his cautious nature had kept him safe.  

Had he carelessly summoned the clone outside, the Holy Ice Sect might already be hunting him.  

In fact, Elder Baili could track the essence blood's location as long as Li Shiming remained on this continent. Only the computer room's unique properties shielded him from detection.  

Shifting his focus, Li Shiming immersed himself in the vast array of formation knowledge processed by IBMz15.  

Without using sect contribution points, he had purchased formation manuals from the Yun Trading Company. Though expensive, it was more affordable than using his limited sect resources.  

The Yun Trading Company's manuals were miscellaneous and didn't overlap with sect teachings.  

He estimated that with a bit more study, he could attempt the intermediate formation master examination.  

He could probably pass now, but rushing would draw unwanted attention. Better to wait another year or two.  

IBMz15 constantly analyzed formation techniques, periodically sharing its findings with him. This allowed him to progress rapidly without neglecting other responsibilities.  

Suddenly, IBMz15 interrupted the knowledge transfer with an alert.  

The visor beside him had vibrated, signaling an intrusion.  

Without putting it on, he extended his spiritual sense into the visor and accessed a surveillance feed.  

Thanks to micrometer-scale chips, he had installed numerous surveillance probes around Eagle Beak Island, covering every approach.  

Infrared and standard cameras, processed by AI, automatically flagged suspicious activity and relayed real-time tracking to the visor.  

Through the feed, Li Shiming saw an invisible figure approaching.  

Most invisibility techniques were ineffective against cultivators—a simple *Qi Observation Technique* or sensitivity to spiritual fluctuations could reveal them.  

His surveillance system lacked such methods, but infrared imaging detected body heat.  

Yet this intruder appeared deep blue—indicating a temperature far below the surroundings.  

Most cultivators emitted heat, with stronger physiques radiating more intensely.  

Only a demonic cultivator he'd once encountered from the Profound Nether Sect matched this signature.  

"Could this be a Profound Nether Sect cultivator?" he wondered.  

But why would they infiltrate Eagle Beak Island? This was hostile territory for them.  

Then a second blue figure appeared. The two seemed to communicate before one reached toward the island's defensive formation.
