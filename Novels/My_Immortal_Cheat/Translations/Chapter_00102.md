Chapter 102: The Ash Spear... Head

Time passed by minute by minute. Zhou Tian idly drew on the ground with a branch, sometimes an 's', sometimes a 'b'. Approximately six hours later, a mass of flickering crimson ash suddenly appeared on the random patterns Zhou Tian had drawn. With a boom, it erupted into a towering crimson flame mixed with black ash.

Zhou Tian squinted, observing the scene before him. The entrance effect was quite cool.

As the crimson flames dissipated and the dust settled, a figure in a crimson robe appeared in its place. The robe was adorned with flame-like black patterns. He had the appearance of a middle-aged man, with some wrinkles on his face, firm eyes, and his hands crossed into his sleeves.

The man stared intently at the crimson silk cloth in Zhou Tian's hand, a hint of excitement even appearing on his face.

"Are you from the Ash Sect?" Zhou Tian asked tentatively.

The man averted his gaze from the crimson silk and looked at Zhou Tian, the excitement on his face receding.

"Indeed, I am one of the Ash Sect's bishops, Saman. How did you come by this item?"

"Its owner, of course," Zhou Tian said, standing up from the ground and patting his backside. "Come on, let's do the code. Gu... Gucci rua." Zhou Tian squeezed out a few strange characters from his mouth. This was the secret code Anduin had taught him to verify the other party's identity.

"Mohei rua!" Saman exclaimed excitedly. Although Zhou Tian didn't know what he was so excited about, he knew the code matched. The response Anduin had taught him was precisely these syllables.

"Is the Divine Son well?" Saman asked, trembling all over.

"He's fine, your Divine Son is alright, don't get so agitated." Seeing Saman on the verge of collapsing from excitement, Zhou Tian quickly said.

"Your Divine Son asked me to give this to you." Zhou Tian handed over the crimson silk cloth.

Saman became even more agitated, a look of piety spreading across his face. He extended both hands, taking the crimson silk from Zhou Tian, and slowly pressed it against his forehead.

"%h《@#" A string of extremely strange syllables emanated from Saman's mouth. Instantly, something miraculous occurred. The silk cloth, soaked with Anduin's blood, emitted a faint glow. Scattered golden specks of light slowly drifted on its surface, and an inexplicable low hum emerged—not Saman's murmur, but another sound entirely.

Saman's eyes were tightly closed, as if listening to this hum. A moment later, the hum vanished, and the strange phenomena on the silk cloth disappeared as well, returning it to its unremarkable state. Saman opened his eyes and whispered, "As you wish."

Zhou Tian silently watched the scene unfold. It seemed that Anduin had hidden quite a few things within that silk cloth.

Saman looked up at Zhou Tian. "We are already aware of the Divine Son's transaction with you. The Divine Son's friend is our friend. Please follow me."

Zhou Tian nodded. "Since you know, that's for the best."

Saman lowered his head in a gesture, then turned and walked towards the cave entrance. Zhou Tian followed behind him.

"You certainly have a large presence here," Zhou Tian commented as he emerged from the cave entrance. The cave he had found was halfway up a mountain peak. Upon following Saman out, he discovered the entire area was filled with individuals dressed in crimson robes with black patterns—all members of the Ash Sect.

"Please forgive us. We suddenly sensed the Divine Son's aura today, and we couldn't help but be cautious," Saman explained.

"It's nothing," Zhou Tian waved his hand, not taking this minor matter to heart. "How long has your Divine Son been captured?"

This question seemed to hit a sensitive spot for Saman. His face flushed, and he seemed about to say something, but a moment later, he returned to normal, sighing, "The Divine Son has been captive for quite some time now. We've been lurking near Sael City for a long while, trying every method to contact him, but to no avail, until today."

Zhou Tian observed Saman's shift in mood. There seemed to be more to the story, but it had nothing to do with him, so he had no intention of probing further.

"Saman, what's going on?" Two more individuals emerged from the crowd of Ash Sect members, also appearing middle-aged.

"These two are the other two bishops of our Ash Sect," Saman introduced to Zhou Tian, then added, "Please wait a moment."

Zhou Tian nodded. Saman walked aside with them and whispered for a good while before returning. They were likely sharing information, and the other two also looked very excited.

Afterwards, Zhou Tian followed them to their nearby hideout, which was underground. It was equipped with methods to block detection and wasn't too rudimentary, suggesting they had been operating there for a long time. This made Zhou Tian even more curious.

Zhang Yi and his companions were captured and would be tried within a few days. Yet, Anduin, the Divine Son imbued with divine blood, had been continuously imprisoned without being killed. The reasons behind this were worth pondering, but Zhou Tian's current objective wasn't to uncover Anduin's secrets, but to rescue Zhang Yi and Mu Su.

"Can you tell me your plan?" Zhou Tian asked.

Upon entering this underground base, he had simply followed the three bishops, turning left and right through the underground passages, with no idea where they were going.

Saman and the other two exchanged glances, then Saman finally spoke.

"There's no harm in telling you. The plan is very simple: merely place the silk cloth stained with the Divine Son's divine blood onto our Sect's Divine Artifact, the Ash Spear."

"That's it?" Zhou Tian was a little surprised. He had expected some profound and extraordinary secret technique.

"Indeed. The Ash Spear is the weapon of the Ash Lord, possessing unimaginable power. Although it was broken for unknown reasons in ancient times, it still retains divine power. As long as the Divine Son establishes a connection with it, it can find him and help him escape."

Saman explained, a sense of indescribable pride in his eyes as he spoke of the Ash Spear. Among the remaining divine sects in the Forsaken Land, only their Ash Sect possessed a personal weapon of a Divine Lord, which was why the Ash Sect's cohesion was arguably the strongest among all divine sects.

"Your Divine Son is imprisoned in the very heart of Sael City. Are you certain it can help him escape?" Zhou Tian inquired again.

"On this point, we have no doubt!" Saman replied decisively.

"If your Divine Artifact is so powerful, then how was Anduin captured by the Holy Divine Sect in the first place?" Zhou Tian asked curiously. "You're hyping up this Ash Spear so much, yet Anduin still got caught."

The atmosphere fell silent. "There's a reason for that..."

"I know there's a reason," Zhou Tian mused inwardly, but he didn't press further. It was clear they didn't want to talk about it.

Saman and the others continued to lead the way, Zhou Tian silently following. Along the way, they encountered many cultists, all of whom saluted the group, or more precisely, the three bishops.

They arrived before a metal casing forged from black metal speckled with gold, resembling the brilliant stars in the night sky. Every inch of its surface was intricately carved with complex patterns, and it was secured by thick crimson chains, with light flowing and faint flames flickering.
