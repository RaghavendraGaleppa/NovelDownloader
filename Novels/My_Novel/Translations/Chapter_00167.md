Chapter 167: The Second Realm of Martial Arts, Also Known as Great Plainness

It was already September. A cold, dreary rain fell, chilling the world.

Inside the One Union Manor, Lady Wen draped a thin gauze shawl over her shoulders. Her beautiful eyes were cold as she stared at Li Xian through a landscape screen.

On the other side of the screen, Li Xian cupped his fists and bowed.

"You have great audacity," Lady Wen said indifferently. "You secretly mobilized the guards to attend to your own affairs. Li Xian, you have truly grown capable. Do you know that since I established this manor, you are the only one who has dared to act in such a way?"

"Li Xian was reckless. Please punish me, My Lady," Li Xian said.

"Punishing you will make up for the losses?" Lady Wen coldly asked.

"I will accept whatever arrangement you make," Li Xian said.

"The losses at the manor today amount to three thousand taels of silver," Lady Wen said. "You must repay this within a month. Otherwise... I have my own ways of dealing with you."

Li Xian thought to himself, "I'm afraid I already owe a lot of money. Where am I supposed to get three thousand taels?" However, stabilizing the Lady and resolving this with only money was the best possible outcome. "Yes."

"That is merely compensation," Lady Wen said. "I still have to punish you."

"You acted recklessly and violated the manor's rules. You deserve to be beaten with a bamboo rod. However, I imagine the guards wouldn't dare strike you properly. From today onward, you will come before me every morning at the hour of the Chen. I will personally use a sword to strike your palm."

Hearing this, Li Xian felt a sharp pain in his palm. The Lady had struck his palm with a sword several times before, and the pain was truly extreme. But he had no choice but to agree.

Lady Wen's tone softened. "Come here."

Li Xian walked around the screen and stood before her. Lady Wen looked him over with satisfaction, thinking to herself that he was good, and had him massage her shoulders.

At that moment, the window creaked open. The cold rain drifted in, along with a gentle breeze. Lady Wen calculated in her heart, "A mere Cao family is beneath my notice. The lives of those guards are of no concern to me."

"By showing such ruthlessness today, Li Xian will surely fear me. Moreover, by provoking the Cao family, I have severed his path to the provincial city. This boy is isolated and helpless; only I can be his reliance. In this way, won't he belong to me completely?"

"It is about time to teach him the second layer of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword."

Lady Wen was extremely skilled at weighing benefits, but her methods were vicious, often offending others. She could not trust anyone. She could only make others dependent on her through calculated interests, ensuring that whether they looked at it from a "benefit" perspective or any other, they had no choice but to rely on her.

Only then could she trust Li Xian.

The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword was a superior sword art, divided into several layers that progressed step by step. One could only practice the next layer after mastering the previous one. Based on his talent and attainments in the sword, Li Xian was already qualified to learn it long ago. Lady Wen was also a sword enthusiast who had coveted the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword for over a decade.

The reason she had delayed teaching it, and even if she taught it, he couldn't practice it, was entirely because their interests were not yet deeply enough bound. For a long time, Lady Wen's cultivation of Li Xian had already been unrelated to the ethereal fortune of "Li Xiaofan."

But today... without a word, she had decided to break Cao Yuan's limbs and force him into the thorn armor. Aside from her calculations and vicious style, she was genuinely somewhat angered.

"My things—what kind of person are you to dare lay a hand on them? Do you have a death wish?" For a moment, such a thought flitted through Lady Wen's mind.

Lady Wen said softly, "Qiu Yue has already heated the medicinal bath. You are covered in blood and filth. Go wash yourself first, then meet me in the bathing room."

The bathing room was filled with mist.

The second layer of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword required a medicinal bath to lay the foundation. It needed over a dozen medicinal herbs, including Yin-Yang Grass, Boundary Root, Li Water, Qian Water, and Ghost Stone Powder, which were first boiled in a medicinal cauldron.

Finally, the dregs were filtered out, and the liquid was diluted with fine "Clear Water" to make the bath soup.

What is fine Clear Water? Places with famous mountains and great rivers, where Heaven and Earth bestow unique energy upon the landscape, are sources of good "Clear Water."

But it is not limited to that. There is "Sky Water" suspended thirty thousand miles high, "River Heart Water" from the ceaseless flow of great rivers, and "Dew Water" that clings to flowers, trees, and grass with a unique fragrance.

All are excellent water sources.

They require human effort to transport and collect... The creations of Heaven and Earth can only be moved by the hands of countless living beings.

In the bath soup.

The medicinal effects seeped in precisely. Lady Wen's beautiful eyes shimmered slightly, her hands clasped tightly. Her breathing was slightly unsteady. Although this was for practicing sword art, her mind at this moment was not on the sword.

This method of the medicinal bath could reshape one's physique with miraculous effects. One person could not absorb it, nor could two women or two men. It required a man and a woman to hold hands for the effects to flow into their bodies.

It nourished the physique, enhanced beauty and longevity, cultivated internal Qi, and soothed the mind.

Meanwhile.

Cao Yuan, who prided himself on his strength and had bullied the weak youth from the poor county, never expected to end up with his limbs broken and wearing a thorn armor. Filled with pain and rage, he fainted on the spot.

When he woke again, it was already noon the next day. The swaying carriage jostled him awake.

"Ugh..." Cao Yuan tried to speak. His throat had been removed. As a respected elder of the Cao family, his current state was unspeakably miserable. Thinking of this, his heart filled with sorrow and anger. He heard the accompanying Cao soldiers talking:

"Elder Cao is probably finished this time."
"Truly, there are always people beyond people, and heavens beyond heavens. It shouldn't be said, but... I honestly feel that woman yesterday was so... indescribable. She haunts my dreams. If I could have a taste of her in this lifetime, I'd be happy to end up like Elder Cao."
"To be honest, I feel the same. It's not surprising that the Martial Captain, young as he is, has achieved so much. With such a woman backing him, he's naturally extraordinary."
"Sigh, in my opinion, that Martial Captain is exceptionally handsome, and that woman is peerlessly beautiful. I bet that Martial Captain is her boy-toy. I absolutely refuse to believe they don't have some connection."

Cao Yuan's rage boiled upon hearing this. He had already entered the Second Realm of Martial Arts, [Bone-Shaping Turbid Robe], also known as [Great Plainness]. A martial artist who reached this realm possessed many supernatural abilities.

Having his hands and feet broken did not necessarily mean he was crippled.

But... a martial artist's abilities and methods vary with their martial arts attainments, making them diverse, with strengths, weaknesses, and peculiarities. The realm is a dead thing, but a person is alive. There is no difference between realms, but people are worlds apart.

Cao Yuan was skilled in hand techniques, especially "throwing" arts, which he dared claim were among the best in the provincial city. His martial arts were largely dependent on his hands and feet. Now, with his hands and feet broken, the accumulation of his previous efforts was wiped out.

He possessed martial arts cultivation but could not use his techniques. He was truly no different from a cripple. Hearing the Cao soldiers' teasing, which struck a nerve, his pent-up anger was indescribable.

He slammed his head against the ground, making a "thud, thud" sound. The Cao soldiers heard the commotion and immediately rushed into the carriage to check.

"Oh, Elder Cao, you're finally awake."
"We applied herbal medicine to you and are rushing back to the Cao family. Don't worry, once we're back, there will surely be a way to heal you."

The Cao soldier entered the carriage. Seeing Cao Yuan's throat bleeding, unable to speak, and his hands and feet gone, like a useless person, a flash of satisfaction crossed his mind.

Cao Yuan's eyes were cold. He opened and closed his mouth. The soldier asked, "Elder Cao, do you want water?"

Cao Yuan nodded quickly. The Cao family soldier took off his waterskin, lifted Cao Yuan's head, and tried to feed him water. Cao Yuan didn't swallow, holding the water in his mouth. Suddenly, he spat...

A drop of water flew from his mouth and hit the soldier. With a "boom," the soldier was sent flying, crashing to the ground, dazed.

Cao Yuan was furious. He had just used his "tongue as a hand" to perform a throwing technique. Filled with rage, he had aimed to kill. Unfortunately, his hand techniques were profound, but his mouth techniques were shallow.

He failed to kill him.

"Elder Cao!"

The other Cao soldiers heard the commotion and stopped the carriage, rushing in to check.

Cao Yuan found it hard to speak, and since he needed them to take care of him on the way back to the manor, he opened his mouth and spat again. A line of water shot out, piercing a distant tree trunk. After adapting from his previous attempt, this one was significantly more powerful.

After the demonstration, he swept his gaze over everyone, then tilted his head to look into the distance, signaling them to hurry up and return to the manor as soon as possible.

The soldiers looked at each other in fear. They lowered their heads and marched on, not daring to gossip anymore.

That night. Cao Yuan was thinking about his future. With his hands and feet broken, what would he do? Could he ever avenge this仇? His thoughts drifted, when suddenly he frowned. An intense itch spread over his body.

He slammed his head against the carriage wall. The Cao soldiers immediately came over. Cao Yuan gestured with his eyes, but they couldn't figure it out. One of the smarter ones said, "That's it! The Martial Captain put Elder Cao in a thorn armor. The armor's effect must be acting now, causing an unbearable itch!"

Cao Yuan nodded, making a strange noise, trying to say, "Quickly, relieve the itch for me!" But this was no ordinary itch. It was the kind that came from deep within, as thorns pierced his flesh and scraped his tendons...

Only the Cao family's secret medicine could temporarily relieve it. But no one had brought any. What were they to do?

Someone came up with a solution: "scratch." They scratched frantically over the thorn armor. Some Cao soldiers who had committed mistakes and been forced to wear the thorn armor would do this when the effects acted and they couldn't get the secret medicine.

But scratching an itch through a boot is hard enough, let alone scratching flesh through armor. It had a negligible effect.

Cao Yuan, the originator of this torment, finally got a taste of it himself. He thrashed his head, unable to relieve the itch, crying and laughing at the same time. Snot, tears, and saliva mixed together. His hair was a mess, completely devoid of the dignity he had when he first appeared.

"Beat... beat..." Cao Yuan mumbled.

A Cao soldier understood and slapped the thorn armor. Cao Yuan felt the pain, but the physical pain covered the physical itch, providing some relief.

Seeing it worked, the Cao soldiers used all the martial arts they had learned in their lives to strike Cao Yuan's body.

They couldn't stop for a moment. On the way back to the provincial city, the Cao soldiers took turns guarding him, slapping Cao Yuan. His mind became hazy. In his confusion, he was slapped across the face several times, but he couldn't count how many.

The journey was long.

Seven days later, they finally returned to the provincial city and the Cao Manor.

The entire Cao Manor was in an uproar...

Although the Cao family used thunderous手段 to suppress the matter, killing all the involved Cao soldiers...

It still leaked out. The large characters "A Gift from the Cao Family, Presented by Li Xian" on Elder Cao's face were exceptionally conspicuous. They spread throughout the provincial city.

Li Xian's name had already spread far and wide before he even arrived in the provincial city.

"This tiny Qingning County is actually so terrifying? Even Elder Cao ended up like this?"
"We've suffered repeated defeats there; it's not easy to go again. There must be another expert behind that Martial Captain, a local tyrant entrenched there."
"If we go to Qingning again, we'll likely suffer more losses. If there's a way to lure him to the provincial city, we'll have a chance to deal with him."
"That's right... The Young Heroes Gathering is not far off. All the young heroes of the provincial city will be there. If we can arrange something then..."

The elders of the Cao family discussed endlessly in the manor.

One Union Manor.

Li Xian's palms faced the sky. A light glowed from his body, and clear energy swirled around him.
