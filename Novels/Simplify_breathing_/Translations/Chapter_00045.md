# Chapter 45: Private Customization

Turning a few corners, Chen Fei arrived at a carpenter's shop and customized a cabinet nearly one cubic meter in size. The cabinet was divided into many compartments, each fitted with a drawer or a small door.

"It's not difficult," the carpenter said with a smile, "but if you want it by tomorrow, it will be a bit rough."

"Rough is fine, just meet the other requirements."

"Alright, then it's no problem." The carpenter nodded.

Chen Fei left a deposit and turned to leave. Whether the idea for this wooden cabinet would work, he would only know after testing it tomorrow.

Chen Fei didn't want to stay out long and planned to go straight back. His archery skill hadn't reached its peak yet, and he still had so many pills to refine. Chen Fei's time was fully packed.

Just after passing a few alleys, Chen Fei's brows furrowed slightly.

Without pausing, Chen Fei continued forward.

After Chen Fei disappeared around the corner of the alley, a figure looked left and right, then slowly followed Chen Fei's steps. But after turning the corner, Chen Fei's figure was nowhere to be seen in the alley.

The person paused slightly, just about to chase, when suddenly a dark shadow appeared behind them.

"Why are you following me!"

Chen Fei's voice rang out, and the person's body stiffened involuntarily. They slowly turned around and looked at Chen Fei.

Even now, the Zhao family still wanted to kill the remaining direct descendants of the Zhang family. But it seemed those people had all left Pingyin County, and the Zhao family hadn't found an opportunity.

"The Young Miss left the county a long time ago, what are you thinking!" Dan Xiang said, her gaze a little evasive.

"Then why did you specifically come to find me?"

Chen Fei sighed slightly. Given Dan Xiang's demeanor, even if there wasn't a problem, it was clear there was one. Of course, Chen Fei had primarily seen through Dan Xiang's disguise first. However, if everyone gathered around Zhang Sinan right now was like this, then the chances of them succeeding were somewhat low. But whether these people succeeded or not had little to do with Chen Fei, as Chen Fei had no intention of getting involved. There was very little left among Zhang Sinan's possessions that Chen Fei might desire. The only internal cultivation method was probably something Zhang Sinan wouldn't give to Chen Fei.

"We need some antidote pills and healing pills." Dan Xiang looked up at Chen Fei and said, "You can refine both of these pills."

"Currently, the Zhao family's daily tasks are very heavy, and I don't have much free time."

Chen Fei thought for a moment and said, "I can only provide a small amount of these two pills."

"That's fine, any amount is appreciated." Dan Xiang smiled.

Anyway, storing the pills for a few days before selling them wouldn't have any impact.

Early the next morning, Chen Fei retrieved his customized wooden cabinet from the carpenter's shop. He paid extra to have the carpenter's shop deliver it.

Once the delivery people left, Chen Fei opened a few drawers of the wooden cabinet and placed some medicine bottles and herbs inside. He then pushed the drawers back, leaving no gaps.

Chen Fei watched the wooden cabinet somewhat nervously. With a pull of his mind, the entire cabinet vanished the next moment, appearing within his spatial grid.

"It works!"

With the first step completed, a smile involuntarily appeared on Chen Fei's face. However, the experiment wasn't over yet; the next attempt was the key.

Inside the spatial grid, Chen Fei used his mind to push and pull one of the cabinet's drawers. The moment a gap appeared, the herbs stored inside the drawer vanished and reappeared in Chen Fei's hand.

"Excellent!"

This time, Chen Fei was truly delighted; the envisioned function was completely realized.
