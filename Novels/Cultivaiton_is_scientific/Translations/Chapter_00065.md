# Chapter 65 Ascension to Immortality  

Before dawn on October 1st, Li Shiming quietly left home without waking Sima Qin, who had cried herself to sleep late the night before.  

He cast the 'Lightness Technique' on himself and first retrieved the four surveillance probes he had placed around the house. If everything went smoothly, he wouldn't be returning for a long time.  

Activating the 'Vanishing Step Technique,' he sped through the capital, scaled the city wall, and left Zhongdu behind. By the time he reached the foot of Tiantan Mountain, numerous carriages were already making their way up to the summit where the Ascension Assembly would be held.  

Today, all youths hoping to test their spiritual aptitude and rogue cultivators seeking to join the sects would gather at the Temple of Heaven.  

Li Shiming slowed his pace, observing the curious faces of young boys and girls peeking out from the carriages. They all shared the same traits—exceptionally bright eyes but frail bodies.  

Generally, those with innate talent would develop spiritual roots at the age of twelve. The formation of these roots required vast amounts of energy, draining the growing bodies of these youths and leaving them weak. The fewer the spiritual roots, the greater the demand for energy—meaning the most gifted often appeared the most emaciated.  

Those born into wealthy families fared better, but impoverished youths with strong spiritual roots often perished prematurely from the strain. Over countless years of Ascension Assemblies, the mortal world had developed a rudimentary screening method: spiritually gifted children were unusually intelligent, with luminous eyes, and were noticeably frail.  

Of course, most officials conducting these screenings in Great Xia had no idea of the true purpose behind the task—only that it was a royal decree. Even many of the youths and their escorts arriving today remained unaware. Given the rarity of spiritual roots, the vast majority here were ordinary children, merely on an excursion.  

When Li Shiming reached the summit, he spotted Gu Jia standing before the Hall of Prayer for Good Harvests, with imperial guards maintaining order in the plaza below.  

Gu Jia noticed Li Shiming and beckoned with a smile. The guards parted to let him through.  

"Greetings, Brother Gu," Li Shiming said with a bow.  

"No need to stand with the others. Stay by my side. I don’t know which elder will arrive today, but I’ll arrange for you to test your spiritual roots first," Gu Jia said, gesturing for him to stand beside him.  

Li Shiming obeyed, watching as carriages continued to arrive, depositing boys and girls into the plaza where guards directed them into orderly lines.  

Naturally, privilege existed everywhere—like Li Shiming himself, and the small cluster of youths standing at the very front of the plaza.
