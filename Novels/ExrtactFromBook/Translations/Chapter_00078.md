# Chapter 78: Going Online

When the mark formed by the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique] appeared on Han Yue, his spiritual sense could detect changes in the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods*, causing ripples in his sea of consciousness.  

Han Yue summoned the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods* and examined it carefully. To his astonishment, after mastering the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique], the originally five-page *Compendium* had unexpectedly evolved an additional page!  

This new page was inserted after the two pages already filled with divine ability attributes, abruptly appearing in the third position. The entire *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods* now consisted of six pages!  

The newly appeared page also bore information:  

**Page Five**  
**[Divine Ability: Divine Thunder • Minor Thunder Sound Technique]**  
**[Quality: Rare • Green]**  
**[Already reached the upper limit of divine ability rank]**  

The newly learned divine ability had clearly been recorded in the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods*!  

Han Yue rubbed the newly appeared page with his fingers, sensing that its texture was slightly different from the original pages. He attempted to place his hand on the back of the new page but found that, unlike the original pages, he couldn't extract a new divine ability from it.  

Han Yue felt somewhat disappointed. He had thought he had finally discovered the secret to increasing the number of pages in the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods*!  

In Han Yue's mind, the most precious cultivation resource in the world was none other than the three remaining blank pages of the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods*—each with two sides, allowing him to effortlessly master six additional divine abilities.  

Every divine ability was an opportunity to change his destiny!  

For him, contemplating how to extract divine abilities was one of his most important daily tasks.  

Under his current circumstances, Han Yue had established strict rules for himself regarding divine ability extraction:  

First, he would preserve his extraction opportunities as much as possible, avoiding unnecessary uses. If his lifespan was sufficient and his cultivation progressed smoothly, he would continue to accumulate resources.  

Han Yue would only consider relying on the *Compendium* when he encountered an insurmountable bottleneck or needed to compensate for a significant weakness.  

Under normal circumstances, Han Yue hoped to rely on his own efforts to reach the fourth rank.  

Second, when faced with danger, he would prioritize escape rather than allowing himself to be cornered. However, if his life was truly threatened, he would decisively use his trump card to extract a divine ability that could turn the tables.  

Finally, all reserved extraction slots were reserved for the true path to immortality. Only when Han Yue could clearly sense the call of the Great Dao would he make his choice without hesitation.  

However, Han Yue, who had just embarked on the path of cultivation, was still too far from the Great Dao to even discern its direction.  

He would first need to climb to a certain height before he could make better choices.  

Although he couldn’t obtain an additional page for extracting divine abilities, the fact that his mastered abilities could be recorded in the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods* was still a great boon.  

After all, the *Compendium* had another excellent function—it allowed Han Yue to rapidly accumulate proficiency in divine abilities during their use.  

Every time Han Yue reached a new level of mastery in a divine ability, its power would increase significantly.  

Although the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique] had already reached its upper limit and couldn’t be improved further for now, Han Yue would master many more divine abilities in the future.  

If future divine abilities could also be recorded in the *Compendium* and their daily use translated into mastery, it would still be a significant enhancement.  

Han Yue put away the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods*.  

Since he couldn’t extract a new divine ability, he stopped dwelling on it and began experimenting with the newly learned [Minor Thunder Sound Technique].  

This new divine ability was the lowest-ranked one Han Yue had mastered so far—it hadn’t even formed a divine ability talisman. Instead, it manifested as a string of runes on his right hand, centered around his personal golden blade emblem.  

Han Yue lightly formed a hand seal with his right hand, activating the divine ability runes on the back of his hand to send out his very first message:  

**"Hello?"**  

Having not engaged in online communication for a long time, Han Yue found himself momentarily at a loss for words and simply sent a casual message as a test.  

Instantly, he felt himself joining a unique network chatroom.  

**"Disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace, Yuanchu, is online!"**  

The range of the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique] spanned over a hundred kilometers. Han Yue’s current location—spanning a hundred kilometers east to west—happened to cover all the disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace.  

His simple message instantly stirred up a hornet’s nest, eliciting a flurry of responses.  

The first to reply was Wang Mumu, the disciple closest to him, who sent a long string of messages:  

**"Shishu shishu shishu shushushu!"**  
**"Me me me I I I Mumu mumu mooo!"**  

Wang Mumu’s [Minor Thunder Sound Technique] was clearly not yet fully mastered. Her messages were not only fragmented but also highly inaccurate, making it difficult to grasp her meaning.  

Nevertheless, Han Yue politely replied with a voice message:  

**"Hello, Mumu. I’ve just mastered the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique]. This is my first time communicating with everyone."**  

He soon received another long string of replies from Mumu:  

**"Wahahaha, shushushu you you good hehehe amazing hehehe!"**  
**"Ni ni you fa fa very clear chuchuchu!"**  

It took Han Yue a moment to realize that Wang Mumu was praising him for the clarity and comprehensibility of his messages sent via the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique].  

**"Mumu, stop torturing others with your chaotic transmissions!"**  
**"Greetings, Junior Brother Yuanchu! I am Yuanzhen, a senior disciple who entered the sect a few years before you. Currently, I am one of the true disciples of the sect!"**  

Han Yue received a message from a second person. It seemed he wasn’t the only one who had suffered from Mumu’s bombardment of messages.  

**"Little Shishu, you mastered the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique] so quickly! It took me three and a half years to complete my training back then! Little Shishu, I’m Miaoyin!"**  
**"Welcome, Little Shishu! It’s been years since a new disciple joined the sect. I’m Miaofa!"**  

Han Yue received a series of greetings—the disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace were extremely enthusiastic. He replied to each one politely.  

Among the entire sect, apart from Yuanzhen, who was of the same generation as him, all other disciples were of the "Miao" generation. Although Han Yue had only recently joined the sect, his seniority was actually quite high!  

Among the many messages, he also received one from his master, Li Changle:  

**"Yuanchu, come to my cave abode."**  

Nearly half a year had passed since their return to the sect, and Han Yue had only just emerged from his deep immersion in the inherited teachings. It was only then that he realized he hadn’t seen his master since their return!  

Han Yue left his cave abode and swiftly headed toward the direction from which Li Changle’s message had originated.  

After greeting Han Yue, the others stopped disturbing him, and the message network woven by the [Minor Thunder Sound Technique] returned to normal.  

A disciple could be heard asking Elder [Chuanzong]:  

**"Elder [Chuanzong], my second-rank cultivation has stabilized, and I wish to travel to the Central Continent. However, I lack a reliable divine ability to counter extraterrestrial demons. Which divine ability would you recommend I exchange for?"**  

As Han Yue flew through the air, listening to the exchanges, he found this style of cultivation to be uniquely fascinating.
