# Chapter 72: The Nine Peaks Martial Competition Begins, Lao Xiao’s First Battle

The heavens were kind; today was a bright, sunny day.

Below the main peak of Qingyuan, motorcades stretched out like rivers flowing into the sea, deacons maintaining order at every turn.

It was a grand spectacle, befitting the status of the foremost sect among the Three Sects of Ziyang Mansion.

"So lively?"

Li Mo lifted the carriage curtain, observing the scene outside.

He had only descended the mountain once for a mission, so he hadn't truly entered the Jianghu yet.

Old Ba, who was driving the carriage, chuckled. "Our Qingyuan Sect's Nine Peaks Martial Competition is a stage for the younger generation to display their strength. Naturally, the smaller sects nearby, as well as the other two major sects, have sent people to witness the ceremony."

"I see."

Li Mo nodded, understanding why the competition was so bustling.

Newcomers replacing the old; the new generation would eventually become the backbone of the sect. They represented the future strength of the sect. Strength meant status, and it dictated how other sects should position themselves in the future.

Moreover, not long ago, a magnificent light shot into the sky above Qingyuan Sect, a massive celestial phenomenon.

Many came with the intention of probing the reality of the situation.

Old Ba pointed ahead. "That's the contingent from the Burning Jade Forest. The leader is one of their six heads."

Li Mo looked in that direction.

The Burning Jade Forest hadn't brought many people, only a dozen or so, but their presence was imposing. The disciples were all dressed in fine attire, wielding famous weapons, clearly distinct from the minor sects around them.

A white-robed disciple stood at the very front, hands clasped behind his back, a faint arrogance in his eyes.

"The Burning Jade Forest is to the west of Ziyang Mansion. Some of their territory borders the Central Divine Continent, so some of their disciples come from noble backgrounds," Old Ba explained upon seeing Li Mo's gaze.

"And over there?" Li Mo asked again.

Old Ba glanced over and smiled. "That's the Red Whale Gang."

"They are the largest gang in Ziyang Mansion and rank among the top in the Eastern Wasteland Domain. On the surface, their strength ranks last among the three sects, but it's a mixed bag of dragons and snakes; the waters are deep."

The Red Whale Gang's area was much more chaotic. They had connections with various small sects, and there was inevitably a lot of fawning and greetings.

Li Mo nodded slightly upon hearing this.

He narrowed his eyes.

The leader was a helmsman of the Red Whale Gang, but what caught Li Mo's attention wasn't him, but the blood-robed youth standing beside him.

This youth gave him a strange feeling.

But before he could activate his Destiny Divine Eye, a familiar figure blocked his view.

It was the Lord of Ziyang Mansion.

The Lord, who had met Li Mo once before, was conversing with the leading helmsman.

The carriage began to move again.

Soon, they arrived halfway up the main peak of Qingyuan.

"Good luck, my precious disciple."

Shang Wu yawned and stood up, lightly floating onto the high platform.

There, the Peak Masters were already seated, with a few extra seats prepared for the visiting guests from other sects.

Shang Wucang sat in the center and cast a glance over.

Upon seeing Ying Bing, his eyes flashed with deep expectation.

It wasn't just the Sect Master looking over.

Many eyes in the crowd were fixed on them at this moment.

Shang Wucang's only disciple, the recognized future master of Qingyuan Sect, and a talent that stood out among his peers.

Coupled with many enviable halos and her aloof, snowy lotus-like temperament, it was hard to be ignored.

"?"

Little Li frowned.

His perception was sharp, so he naturally sensed many hostile glances treating him as a thorn in their side.

Who asked him to be the only one standing next to Ying Bing?

And he had even obtained the Chixiao sword to match her Tianshuang.

Facing those glances.

Little Li's mouth curled up. "Ying Bing, I brought some tea. Want some?"

"Sure."

Ying Bing loved tea immensely, regardless of the quality.

Her fair hands took the tea set, and she began to brew it skillfully. Her movements were swift and pleasing to the eye, beautiful like a painting, making many people stare blankly in admiration.

---

"Tsk."

Li Mo picked up a small cup of Longjing tea.

Those gazes became even more hostile. If looks could kill, he would have been pierced through instantly.

He smacked his lips contentedly and praised, "It's still better when you brew it."

At this time, the voice of Sect Master Qingyuan came through. "Today is the Nine Peaks Martial Competition. I shall keep my remarks brief."

"Fellow colleagues, heroes and champions, our Qingyuan Sect is holding this competition today. The main points are as follows..."

........

An hour later.

The elderly voice on the high platform finally slowed down, seemingly reluctant to stop.

The Sect Master was usually a man of few words; it turned out he saved all his words for this occasion.

"Alright, I shall stop here."

Shang Wucang nodded slightly, signaling to begin the next segment.

Mainly, if he continued, there wouldn't be many people listening; they would all fall asleep.

The next segment was the draw.

Qian Bufan had the deacons collect the waist tokens from all participating disciples and place them into the bronze ox in the arena. Then, he channeled his energy and slapped the ox's back.

A sound of metal clashing rang out, and the bronze beast spat out two waist tokens.

He looked at them and announced loudly, "Xiao Qin versus Xie Lan'ai."

The first match was Senior Brother Xiao?

Li Mo looked up at the stage.

Lao Xiao's aura was much stronger than what he had seen a few days ago; he must have had a breakthrough in his martial arts. He was carrying a broken sword with a resolute expression, exuding a truly fierce and determined temperament.

His opponent was no simple person either.

The woman had excellent facial features, but her cheekbones were high, adding a sharpness to her already cold expression.

Li Mo used his Destiny Divine Eye to look at her.

【Name: Xie Lan'ai】
【Age: 23】
【Bone Structure: Plum Blossom Hand.】
【Realm: Inner Qi Jade Liquid Realm.】
【Destiny: Blue with a hint of Grey.】
【Evaluation: True Disciple of Luoxia Peak. Has the potential to take over a peak in the future. Has a love calamity in her fate. Due to her personality, she is prone to extreme emotions turning into poison.】
【Recent Events: Learning that the Senior Brother Yin Huacheng, whom she has a crush on, wants the Chixiao Sword, she is plotting to obtain the Tianshuang.】

Lao Xiao's luck wasn't very good.

"Yin Huacheng wants my Chixiao?"

Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

He remembered that the Peak Master of the Rare Beast Peak had the surname Yinhuah.

A shout of "Start" signaled the beginning of the battle.

Xiao Qin clearly knew that facing an opponent one realm higher, he shouldn't fight a protracted battle.

Whoosh—

The giant sword was drawn. With his slash, it seemed as if the broken part of the sword was mended, and the sword aura expanded by a large margin.

He made his move with an imposing momentum.

The surging sword aura pressed down.

Xie Lan'ai showed a hint of surprise in her eyes, but she neither dodged nor avoided it.

The soft sword at her waist, like a silver snake, coiled around her arm.

She didn't retreat, nor did she strike with her sword. Instead, she closed the distance.

Xiao Qin's pupils shrank.

He didn't understand her move.

Even if she was a realm higher, it was too arrogant to try to take his sword move with her physical body?

However, the next moment.

Xiao Qin's giant sword, as if striking a ball of cotton, couldn't find any force to oppose it.

Then, a cold light flashed before his eyes.

When Xiao Qin's vision blurred, the snake-like soft sword,不知何时 (who knows when), had changed its trajectory in a bizarre way and appeared right before his eyes!

Under her control, this soft sword seemed to have come to life.

Everyone couldn't help but show expressions of shock.

This was clearly the famous "Spirit Snake Sword Art" of Luoxia Peak, a high-level martial art.

And Xie Lan'ai had already perfected it.
