# Chapter 84: Why is She Acting So Strange Today? (1/2)

The Master went to the Scripture Pavilion in a hurry, not even eating breakfast.
She said she was going to review knowledge related to the Internal Qi Realm.

Noon.
Smoke began to rise from Autumn Water Pavilion.

"Silent all morning."
"Is the Ice Cube really in some kind of trouble?"
"Or is it because of yesterday's match..."

Li Mo's mind flashed back to yesterday's scene where he had tackled the Ice Cube to the ground.
After all, she was a young woman, and it happened in front of everyone.
Could it be that because of the embarrassment, she didn't want to see him?

"That's not very likely... right?"
Li Mo felt that Ying Bing wasn't that kind of person.
After thinking it over, he decided to go upstairs and check.

Holding the prepared dishes, he went upstairs and knocked loudly on the wooden door.
No response.
Li Mo blinked and pushed the door open with a bit more force, making it creak.

As soon as he entered, Little Li was stunned.
The room was as cold as a freezer.
On the bed, which was covered in cracks, there was a large block of ice where she should have been sleeping. Inside the ice was a少女 (young woman) hugging her knees, her life or death unknown.
It was Ying Bing.
A real, literal Ice Cube.

Li Mo: "!"
How did you manage to seal yourself in ice?
There wasn't even that much water in the room!
It was completely unscientific.

*Knock, knock, knock—*
"Ice Cube."
"Ice Cube?"

Li Mo knocked on the ice and called out twice, but got no response. He didn't care whether it was reasonable or not anymore and prepared to smash the ice open.
*Whoosh—*
But his fist stopped halfway, and he held back.
This ice, with its faint blue glow, was clearly not formed from ordinary water vapor; it was incredibly solid.
Who knows, if the ice shatters, might the Ice Cube shatter with it?

"That's right, Internal Qi!"
Li Mo suddenly remembered that he was now an Internal Qi Condensation Realm martial artist.
He reached out and infused a few strands of Internal Qi into the ice.
*Swish, swish—*
Under his control, the Internal Qi acted like a precise carving knife, slowly grinding away at the solid ice.
The speed wasn't fast.

......

Half an hour later.
The Ice Cube was finally 'rescued'.
She had her eyes tightly shut, her delicate brows furrowed as if having a nightmare. Fortunately, her breathing was steady.
Just as Little Li was hesitating over whether his good intentions had caused trouble, Ying Bing's eyelashes fluttered slightly.

"You..."

Li Mo wanted to ask how she was, but the words caught in his throat.
It was a gaze filled with such complexity.
He had never seen the Ice Cube show such a look toward anything.
The former Ying Bing was always detached and cool, as if it were extremely difficult for anything in the world to occupy her mind.
She always seemed to have a well-thought-out plan and knew clearly what she was doing.
But now, Li Mo saw in her eyes...
Confusion?
Complexity?

"Yesterday... did you do it on purpose?"
After a long while, Ying Bing's soft voice came.
In the match, Li Mo clearly hadn't shown strength exceeding hers.
That could only mean he was hiding his strength.
Ying Bing had also experienced the feeling of hiding her strength in the past.

Li Mo: "!"
So, she's still hung up on yesterday's matter?
And she even 'shut herself off' because of it?
Something's not right!
Is this still the Ice Cube? Why is she acting so strange today?

"Sorry," Li Mo said with an embarrassed smile.
Ying Bing lowered her eyes.
He admitted it.

---

He really had held back during their match.
Ying Bing's breathing quickened slightly.
"Why?"

"......"
Little Li fell silent at this question.
He just did it accidentally; there was no "why."
If he had to find a reason...
"Because of the hammer."
Li Mo took the Starry Seed Hammer out from his sleeve.

"Panjie Meteor Hammer?"
Ying Bing blurted out.
A Divine Weapon?
No... it was just the same shape, a mere shell without the spirit.
This was just a Xuan Weapon, a replica.

Li Mo: "!"
How did the Ice Cube know?
That day at the Divine Weapon Peak, didn't they agree that this matter must not be known by a fourth person?
Could it be... Master?

Thinking of Shang Wu, Little Li understood immediately.
Master must have let something slip while drunk one day.
Li Mo sighed and said:
"The Panjie Meteor Hammer is indeed with me. Please don't tell anyone else."
"I had no other choice. I hope you don't mind..."

Anyway, the Ice Cube wasn't an outsider. It was fine if she knew.

"No other choice..."
Ying Bing pondered this, her eyes flashing as if the fog in her heart had cleared.
She seemed to understand now.
That day, the disturbance at the Divine Weapon Cave was due to the Panjie Meteor Hammer choosing its master.
That master was Li Mo.
A Divine Weapon naturally couldn't be shown easily.

"You... can you wield the Divine Weapon?" Ying Bing asked seriously.
"Barely."
"Unless it's a matter of life and death, it's better not to," Li Mo said helplessly, shrugging.
If he were at the peak of the Blood Qi Realm, the most he could do was add the power of the World Seed for a slightly longer duration; he would exhaust himself and even get injured.

"No wonder... no wonder..."
Ying Bing understood now.
The System ranks based on combat power.
Combat power here doesn't include external items.
For example, if someone possesses a powerful hidden weapon that can only be used once, that hidden weapon cannot be counted as part of their own combat power.
Li Mo is a Divine Weapon master and can barely wield it.
Naturally, the Divine Weapon counts as part of his combat power.
The power of a Divine Weapon...

Ying Bing recalled the scene of Shang Wu wielding the Panjie Meteor Hammer in her past life. One hammer strike brought down mountains, like a meteor falling from the sky.
That kind of power was beyond human capability.
Could she have withstood it?
The answer was definitely no.
No matter how invincible she was in the same realm or how she could fight across levels, she couldn't possibly withstand the power of a Divine Weapon in the Internal Qi Realm.
But... wielding a Divine Weapon in the Blood Qi Realm?
Doesn't that sound like a fantasy?
She didn't understand how he managed it.
But... this was no different from exploiting a loophole in the System.
As long as she couldn't withstand the Divine Weapon, she would always be suppressed by Li Mo.

"Since it's all out in the open, then it's fine. Let's eat, let's eat."
"Okay... sure."

Ying Bing had faced many greater difficulties in her life.
She wasn't afraid of difficulties; she was afraid of the unknown.
Now that she knew the reason, it was fine.
The Divine Weapon wouldn't grow, but her realm was changing daily.
In the not-so-distant future, the Panjie Meteor Hammer would no longer be an obstacle to her.
Perhaps, that would be the next time?
If she could get a reward from the System...

【Please strictly carry out the punishment item.】

Ying Bing felt the food tasted bad for the first time.
That unfamiliar, strange feeling in her heart surged up again, refusing to go away.
Sharing the same bed... for a month...
