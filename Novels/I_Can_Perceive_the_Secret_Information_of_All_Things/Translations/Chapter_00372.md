# Chapter 372: Soaring to the Great Ascension Realm  

**[Name: Xiao Ji]**  
**[Affiliation: Primordial Divinity Temple, Secret Realm Progress (478/500)]**  
**[Assets: Celestial Pillar Mountain, Growth Progress 23%]**  
**[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, Quantity Variable]**  
**[Cultivation Realm: Unity Phase (1/1,000,000)]**  

The wind howled across the vast expanse of Celestial Pillar Mountain, carrying with it the faint scent of spiritual herbs. Xiao Ji stood atop a jagged cliff, his robes fluttering as he gazed into the distance. His cultivation had reached the Unity Phase, yet the path ahead remained daunting—each step forward required accumulating a staggering one million points of spiritual energy.  

His spiritual roots were peculiar, flickering in and out of existence like a candle in the wind. Some days, he could sense the flow of qi with perfect clarity; other times, it was as if his connection to the spiritual world had been severed entirely.  

Xiao Ji clenched his fists, his eyes narrowing in determination. The Primordial Divinity Temple had entrusted him with the exploration of the secret realm, and he had already uncovered 478 of its 500 mysteries. The remaining secrets were said to hold the key to transcending mortal limits.  

As for Celestial Pillar Mountain, it pulsed with latent energy, its growth slow but steady. The land itself seemed to breathe, responding to the ebb and flow of the world’s spiritual tides.  

He exhaled slowly, feeling the weight of his journey. The road to the Great Ascension Realm was long, but he would not falter. With each passing day, his power grew—and soon, he would break through the barriers that confined him.
