# Chapter 70 Underwater

When the flying boat was fifty meters above the lake, Li Shiming leaped from the deck, tucking his body into a straight line as he plummeted downward.

"Gahaha, a measly early Qi Refining cultivator thinks he can escape? I'll handle him—you deal with the flying boat!" a Xuanming Sect Qi Refining cultivator said to his companion before breaking off to pursue Li Shiming.

Li Shiming pierced the water like a needle, minimizing splash and allowing him to dive deeper. Moments earlier, he had consulted the IBMz15 to review research documents from the national diving team. Though his control over his body as a cultivator couldn't achieve a perfect 10-point entry, he estimated his form was at least an 8.5.

Once submerged, lacking any underwater breathing technique, he immediately retrieved an oxygen tank and breathing mask from his storage space. He had prepared these after witnessing the Xuanming Sect cultivator release poisonous gas in the city—though he hadn't expected his first use of the equipment would be for underwater evasion.

He kicked and paddled furiously, trying to put distance between himself and his pursuer. But before he could get far, he realized his mistake.

The Xuanming Sect cultivator entered the water, a cloud of black mist repelling the water around him. Though his movements were slower underwater, they were still leagues faster than Li Shiming's mortal-style swimming. Despite Li Shiming's head start, the cultivator closed the gap rapidly.

Seeing Li Shiming flailing awkwardly, the Xuanming cultivator's expression twisted with amusement. He couldn't believe someone with only mortal swimming skills had the audacity to dive into the water. Noticing Li Shiming's youth and his third-level Qi Refining cultivation, he surmised this must be one of Tianhai Sect's prized spiritual root seedlings.

"Pity," the cultivator mused aloud, unconcerned about being overheard. He relished the fear and suffering of his prey. "Uncle-Master's orders are to kill you all. Otherwise, with talent like yours, you might've become my junior brother. Such fine potential—maybe I should preserve your corpse for refining into a puppet. Who knows, I might even get one as good as Uncle-Master's!"

"Gahahaha!" His laughter boomed, the sound waves infused with spiritual energy pulsing through the water, battering Li Shiming's body and mind.

Li Shiming played the *Great Compassion Mantra* through his senses, mitigating the worst of the sonic assault. Though still uncomfortable, the mantra lessened the effects enough to remain bearable. He exaggerated his distress, even consulting the IBMz15 for a crash course in *An Actor Prepares* to enhance his performance. His face contorted in agony, his body trembling as if wracked with unbearable torment.

Yet the Xuanming cultivator didn't charge recklessly. Instead, he approached with caution, using spiritual energy to part the water around Li Shiming.

"Gahaha! Did you really think that pathetic act would fool me?" the cultivator sneered. "I've tortured over a hundred people to death—you don't look anything like them."

Li Shiming was surprised his acting had failed. Suddenly, he opened his mouth, letting the IBMz15 take control of his vocal cords. 

During this time, the AI had analyzed the sonic attacks of the Xuanming Foundation Establishment elder. It had identified several key frequencies—19 Hz, which resonated with the eyeballs, and another frequency affecting lung function, combined with high-decibel noise and spiritual energy to create devastating effects.

Though the research was incomplete and the role of spiritual energy remained unclear, Li Shiming had no choice but to act.

From his mouth poured the *Great Compassion Mantra*, infused with ultra-low and high-frequency waves, mimicking the Xuanming elder's technique as best as the IBMz15 could approximate. Spiritual energy, though crudely applied, intertwined with the sound.

The Xuanming cultivator was stunned. A Qi Refining novice was chanting Buddhist scripture—and somehow producing both vocals and instrumental accompaniment simultaneously. 

The scripture, inherently suppressive against demonic cultivators, was amplified by the faint traces of the Xuanming Sect's *Demonic Sound Infiltration* technique, magnifying its effects several times over. While not enough to kill, it disrupted the cultivator's focus.

As the mantra echoed, the controlled water around them collapsed inward. Seizing the moment, Li Shiming unleashed the Green Kite Wooden Sword, channeling most of his spiritual energy into the strike. 

It was his strongest—and only—offensive option. In such close quarters underwater, using white phosphorus or thermite would mean mutual destruction. Though he was prepared to die fighting, the wooden sword offered a chance at survival.

The blade shot forth. Disoriented by the mantra, the Xuanming cultivator's defensive spell faltered, leaving him vulnerable. The sword pierced his heart unimpeded.

By the time the cultivator regained his senses, it was too late. He stared at Li Shiming in disbelief. He had treated this lightly, confident in his overwhelming advantage. Under normal circumstances, a third-level Qi Refining cultivator couldn't hope to breach his defenses.

Yet here he was, slain by the unthinkable: a mere third-level cultivator wielding a high-grade offensive artifact, manipulating Buddhist scripture with demonic sound techniques. The sheer absurdity of it all was his undoing.
