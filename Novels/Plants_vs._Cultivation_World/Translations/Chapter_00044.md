# Chapter 44: Qi Refinement Third Layer  

With a splash, the koi fish was released into the paddy field. After a brief moment of confusion, it began swimming joyfully through the water. Compared to the cramped fish tank, the vast paddy field clearly delighted the koi.  

Watching the fish darting happily through the water, Gu Mo took out a portion of Solar Essence. Immediately, the koi swam over eagerly, mouth open, waiting to be fed.  

"I've raised you for so long—it's time you earned your keep," Gu Mo said, placing the Solar Essence into the fish's mouth. "From now on, you're responsible for patrolling this area. If you find any pests in the water, eliminate them. Understand?"  

*Plop!*  

The koi smacked its lips in acknowledgment.  

Pleased by the fish's intelligence, Gu Mo felt a surge of satisfaction. After feeding it Solar Essence for so long, not only had the koi's scales gradually turned golden, but its spiritual intelligence had also grown significantly. It could now understand many of Gu Mo's commands.  

The higher the grade of spiritual plants in the field, the more they attracted spiritual insects and beasts. While the small spiritual beasts were easily handled by the Peashooters, the insects proved more troublesome—especially since Gu Mo was now growing rice.  

If any spiritual pests lurked underwater, the Peashooters would struggle to deal with them. But with the koi patrolling the waters, any hidden pests would be swiftly eliminated, ensuring the aquatic spirit rice remained unharmed.  

Satisfied with the koi's diligent patrol, Gu Mo returned to his hut to begin his daily cultivation.

A month later, Yuan Niya arrived as promised. After receiving an enhanced version of Gu Mo's *Cleansing Technique*, she staggered away unsteadily. Fortunately, she had come under the cover of night, and no one was around to witness her departure. Had anyone seen a female cultivator leaving Gu Mo's hut in such a state, it would have undoubtedly sparked wild speculation.  

After Yuan Niya left, Gu Mo adjusted the illusion array's power. Before her arrival, he had used the array to conceal the entire spirit field, leaving only a single path leading to his hut.  

Yuan Niya didn't question this. To her, the secrets Gu Mo harbored were far more intriguing than anything in the spirit field—such as the sheer volume of his spiritual energy, which far exceeded what a first-layer Qi Refinement cultivator should possess. Even if Gu Mo had mastered the *Cleansing Technique* to perfection, giving him greater reserves than most, the difference shouldn't have been so vast.  

The truth was simple: Gu Mo wasn't a first-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. He was already at the peak of the second layer, just one step away from breaking through to the third.  

After mastering the *Breath Concealment Technique* to an advanced level, Gu Mo had stopped holding back in his cultivation. He trained at full capacity, refining ten portions of Solar Essence daily. Each portion was equivalent to three days of hard cultivation, meaning ten portions equaled thirty days. Over the past month, Gu Mo had effectively cultivated for two and a half years.  

His cultivation had surged to the peak of the second layer, with only a single step remaining to fully connect the third minor meridian cycle and advance to the third layer. However, Gu Mo halted at this point—his rapid progress had outpaced the *Cleansing Technique*'s ability to refine his body and marrow.  

To compensate, he began applying an enhanced version of the *Cleansing Technique* daily, ensuring his physical refinement kept up with his cultivation.  

The downside was that the enhanced technique consumed a significant amount of spiritual energy, forcing Gu Mo to reduce the frequency of his *Minor Cloud Rain Technique* applications. As a result, the water level in the spirit field dropped slightly.  

Still, it wasn't a major issue. After a month of relentlessly practicing the *Minor Cloud Rain Technique*, Gu Mo felt he was on the verge of mastering it.  

---  

The next day, as Gu Mo stood before the spirit field, weaving hand seals to cast the *Minor Cloud Rain Technique*, he suddenly felt an epiphany. His movements became fluid and effortless, and above the field, a denser, thicker cloud formed.  

A downpour of spiritual rain followed—no longer the light drizzle of before, but a steady, widespread shower. The volume of rain was several times greater than before.  

"Finally, a breakthrough!" Gu Mo exhaled in relief. His *Minor Cloud Rain Technique* had just reached the *Proficiency* stage—his first advanced-tier spell.  

Few in the Spirit Planting Hall had mastered a farming spell to this level, and most of those who had were outer disciples. Among the labor disciples, only a handful of elderly spirit farmers had achieved such mastery.  

With this breakthrough, managing the spirit field became far easier. What had previously required multiple castings could now be accomplished in one or two, freeing up Gu Mo's spiritual energy for more intensive *Cleansing Technique* sessions. This allowed his body refinement to catch up swiftly to his cultivation progress.  

Half a month later, Gu Mo successfully connected the third minor meridian cycle, officially becoming a third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. As before, his physical strength and spiritual energy were three times that of his peers.  

For a cultivator with an inferior spiritual root, the third layer was often the end of the road—barring any extraordinary opportunities. While Gu Mo's potential wouldn't stop here, his inferior root remained a limiting factor. As he attempted to merge the three minor cycles into a single intermediate cycle—a requirement for advancing to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement—he encountered a bottleneck caused by his spiritual root.  

But this wasn't insurmountable. Breaking through depended not only on spiritual roots but also on comprehension. Thanks to his knowledge from another world, Gu Mo found the process of merging the complex meridian cycles far less daunting. By deconstructing the pathways using mathematical principles, he significantly reduced the difficulty.  

Moreover, the *Gathering Qi Art* manual contained insights on merging minor cycles, though each cultivator's path was unique and couldn't be copied directly. Still, these notes helped lower the barrier further.  

Additionally, with enough resources, even cultivators with poor roots and comprehension could force their way through the Qi Refinement stages. Gu Mo had Solar Essence—even if all else failed, he could brute-force his breakthrough.  

However, this was the least desirable method. Merging meridian cycles required precision; a forced breakthrough would result in an imperfect intermediate cycle, limiting future potential. Unless absolutely necessary, Gu Mo wouldn't resort to such a crude approach.  

For now, he set aside active cultivation and focused entirely on merging the minor cycles. With the aid of his past-life knowledge and the manual's insights, his progress was promising.  

But the surprises didn't end there. With his cultivation paused, the Solar Essence he harvested daily was now used to expand the Misty Space—and soon, another unexpected boon arrived.
