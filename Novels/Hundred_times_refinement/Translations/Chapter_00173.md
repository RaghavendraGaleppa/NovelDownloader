# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 121: Three Treasures  

Though the original intentions of Tianchen Zhenren in seizing the Mountain Within Mountains remain unclear, given that the founding ancestor of the Spirit Medicine Mountain was such a remarkably talented figure, it was impossible for the sect to possess only the superficial strength it displayed.  

"Although our sect has not produced a Nascent Soul cultivator since its founding, we still have over a dozen Core Formation ancestors in secluded cultivation—outsiders simply aren't aware of them," Yang Xiu said with a hint of pride, tilting his chin slightly. "In terms of strength, we may not compare to the likes of Bixi Mountain, One-Line Gorge, or Thundercloud Manor, but in Youzhou, we are far from being a third- or fourth-rate sect. We are only slightly inferior to the three major powers."  

Hearing so many secrets in one go, even someone as composed as Lin Xuan needed time to digest the information.  

Questions swirled in his mind. Why would Spirit Medicine Mountain, with its first-rate strength, maintain such a low profile? Was it due to ancestral teachings, or was there another motive? What had truly driven Tianchen Zhenren to seize the Mountain Within Mountains?  

Moreover, if Spirit Medicine Mountain was truly this formidable, why had Tongyu Zhenren so casually named him as the next sect leader? What was the elder truly planning?  

Though riddled with doubts, Lin Xuan showed no outward signs of curiosity. Instead, he subtly probed Yang Xiu for more information. The latter answered candidly, though his knowledge seemed limited.  

As they spoke, the two arrived before a sheer cliff face.  

The path ahead ended abruptly, yet Yang Xiu stopped without hesitation.  

Lin Xuan also descended from his flight light, eyeing the cliff with surprise. Could this be the entrance to the treasure vault?  

Yang Xiu retrieved a token from his sleeve and murmured an incantation. Under the infusion of spiritual power, a beam of white light shot from the token and struck the cliff.  

Instantly, something wondrous occurred. Like a pebble dropped into a pond, ripples spread across the scenery before them. The cliff vanished, replaced by an exquisite pavilion.  

An illusion?  

Lin Xuan was stunned. Despite being at the Foundation Establishment stage with spiritual sense far surpassing his peers, he had detected no trace of this illusionary formation. The potency of these restrictions was beyond imagination.  

"Alright, Junior Brother Lin, this way!"  

Yang Xiu grinned and led the way. After a brief hesitation, Lin Xuan followed him into the pavilion.  

"This isn't just an illusion. The treasure vault of our sect is protected by formidable restrictions. The Mystic Immortal Formation here not only inverts yin and yang but also conceals attacks based on the five elements. Even a Core Formation cultivator who steps inside would be unable to escape—only meeting a shattered core and death. So stay close, Junior Brother, and don't wander off!"  

"Understood."  

Lin Xuan, now aware of the formation's lethality, remained no more than three steps behind Yang Xiu at all times.  

After bypassing another restriction, Yang Xiu led Lin Xuan into a chamber. "Here we are, Junior Brother. According to the sect leader's decree, you may select any three items from this room."  

The chamber was modest, spanning only about two hundred square meters, yet it was meticulously organized with all manner of treasures from the cultivation world.  

Spirit artifacts, elixirs, talismans—everything was available.  

---  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan emerged from the treasure vault.  

Recalling the selection process, a wry smile tugged at his lips. The sheer abundance of choices had left him momentarily overwhelmed.  

Among cultivators of his level, Lin Xuan was already considered exceptionally knowledgeable. Most early Foundation Establishment cultivators were fortunate to possess even a single spirit artifact, yet Lin Xuan owned several, including top-tier treasures.  

But here, even he had been dazzled, tempted to sweep everything into his storage bracelet.  

Of course, that was impossible.  

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xuan steadied his excitement. Then, he began selecting what he needed most.  

First, he chose a small, palm-sized round shield. Though unassuming, it was a top-grade defensive spirit artifact.  

Lin Xuan lacked no offensive methods, but his only defensive artifact was the Flower Cloth obtained from the ill-intentioned cultivator he had slain while refining the top-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pill—a mere mid-grade item. Naturally, he wouldn't pass up this "Mystic Gold Shield."  

For his second treasure, Lin Xuan selected a beast talisman.  

He was already adept at using talismans that sealed demon beast souls. Though he still possessed the Skysoar Bird talisman, it was only a first-grade beast—effective in battles between Qi Condensation cultivators but nearly useless now that he had reached Foundation Establishment.  

Thus, when he spotted a talisman sealing a second-grade "Flame Rhinoceros," he pocketed it without hesitation.  

Beast talismans had energy limitations, but possessing one was akin to gaining a helper of comparable strength.  

Facing two opponents at once, even a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator would struggle to prevail. This was one of the fastest ways to boost his combat power.  

For his third treasure, Lin Xuan chose a medicinal pill called the "Spirit Replenishment Pill."  

As the name suggested, it could rapidly restore a cultivator's depleted spiritual power.  

Normally, recovering spiritual power required either meditation or drawing energy from spirit stones. The former was suitable only for cultivation, while the latter was the common method during battles.  

However, absorbing from spirit stones, though faster than meditation, was still insufficient compared to the rapid depletion during combat. Cultivators used it more out of resignation than satisfaction.  

The Spirit Replenishment Pill was different. Though it couldn't instantly refill one's spiritual power—only legendary immortal pills could achieve that—it restored energy ten times faster than spirit stones.  

In other words, in a prolonged battle against an evenly matched opponent, this pill would ensure Lin Xuan's victory.  

The only regret was the limited quantity—just ten pills per bottle.  

But one must be content. With these three treasures, Lin Xuan's strength had surged dramatically.  

Combined with the "Nine Heavens Profound Art" he cultivated, as well as spirit artifacts like the Frostring and Hookblade, Lin Xuan now far surpassed his peers.  

---  

Three days later.  

A streak of light approached from the horizon, speeding toward a vast mountain range shrouded in mist.  

The plain-faced youth who emerged from the light gazed at the majestic peaks and sighed, "What a remarkable spiritual vein."  

Bixi Mountain stretched eight hundred li from west to east. From the sky, it resembled a crouching dragon. Its main peak, towering five thousand meters, was perpetually veiled in azure mist—hence the name "Bixi" (Jade Mist) Mountain.  

Ordinary mountains were cloaked in white mist, but the azure hue here was a marvel to mortals.  

Cultivators, however, knew this was no ordinary mist but a dense concentration of heaven and earth's spiritual energy. This was one of Youzhou's finest spiritual veins, claimed by Bixi Mountain, one of the three great sects.  

For ordinary cultivators, practicing here doubled their progress with half the effort.  

A flicker of emotion passed through Lin Xuan's eyes, but he felt no envy. For someone like him, who relied on elixirs for cultivation, the density of spiritual energy in his surroundings was irrelevant.  

After surveying the area, Lin Xuan retrieved an invitation card. Channeling his spiritual power, a beam of red light shot from the card and vanished into the mountain.  

Soon, another streak of light approached from Bixi Peak—a disciple clad in the sect's robes, appearing to be around seventeen or eighteen years old.  

He rode a flying sword spirit artifact. Lin Xuan's spiritual sense revealed the youth to be at the fifth layer of Qi Condensation.  

The young man arrived swiftly, eyeing Lin Xuan with surprise before cupping his hands in greeting. "Esteemed Daoist, was that signal sent by you?"  

"Indeed."  

"You are the sect leader of Spirit Medicine Mountain?"  

The disciple's face was full of doubt. Though Tongyu Zhenren wasn't renowned for his strength, his alchemical skills had made him a celebrated figure in Youzhou. Rumor had it he was an elderly man of immortal bearing—certainly not this young man before him...  

Using a spirit vision technique, the disciple's expression immediately turned respectful. This Daoist, who appeared only a year or two older, was actually a Foundation Establishment expert!  

Lin Xuan smiled faintly. "Tongyu Zhenren is my master. I am his disciple and the next sect leader of Spirit Medicine Mountain. My master is occupied with urgent matters and cannot attend the gathering at Bixi Mountain, so he sent me in his stead."  

As he spoke, Lin Xuan handed over his identity token.  

The disciple's doubts vanished. After inspecting the token, his demeanor grew even more deferential. "This junior was discourteous. So you are the next sect leader of Spirit Medicine Mountain. I am Mu Yan, a disciple of Bixi Mountain, tasked with welcoming fellow Daoists. Senior, please follow me."
