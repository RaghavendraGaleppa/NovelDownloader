# Chapter 154: Thirty Years Later

"Thirty-Eight, how many Cosmic River Gold Sands have you bid for, and at what price?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.

The sudden voice made Lu Thirty-Eight jump before he realized it was his master speaking.

The next moment.

The deer raised its large head proudly and declared: "Reporting to Master, I've successfully bid for 1,233 grains of Cosmic River Gold Sand at an average price of 91 units of fortune per grain."

"Excellent work!" Zhang Jing's eyes brightened slightly as he nodded in satisfaction.

Though Lu Thirty-Eight usually appeared lazy and indifferent to cultivation, when it came to matters concerning spiritual plants and immortal roots, none could match his dedication.

"How much fortune remains?"

"A little over 100,000 units."

Zhang Jing understood immediately and instructed: "Continue using these 100,000 units to bid for Cosmic River Spirit Sand. In five months, another million units will be added—use 300,000 of that for Cosmic River Gold Sands while reserving the rest. Maintain the same price per grain as before."

"By then, the Three Lights Peach Tree should begin sprouting saplings. Thirty-Eight, remember to take good care of them."

"Rest assured, Master. I understand," Lu Thirty-Eight replied with sudden seriousness.

"Good."

With that, Zhang Jing entered the palace to begin secluded cultivation, preparing to comprehend the four Dao Intent inheritances in his possession.

Time passed unnoticed in cultivation.

Thirty years flowed by like a dream.

By the spiritual spring at the center of the immortal island, Lu Thirty-eight—unchanged by time—held a small jade bucket in his mouth. He carefully drew water from the spring and poured it onto a half-human-height immortal plant.

Immediately, the plant's leaves stretched open, swaying gently in the breeze. Wreathed in dense immortal qi and shimmering with faint tricolored radiance, it appeared extraordinarily divine.

"Little Peach, little peach, grow quickly," Lu Thirty-Eight murmured as he watered the Three Lights Peach Tree. "Master and I are waiting to taste your fruit."

Envisioning that delightful future, the deer suddenly chuckled, a thread of drool escaping his mouth.

Meanwhile, within the palace that now bore subtle signs of age, Zhang Jing sat in silent meditation.

Though time was said to cut like a blade, thirty years had left no mark on his youthful appearance that still resembled a man barely past twenty. Even his temperament remained unchanged.

After a while, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, revealing a dazzling interplay of colors—Five Elements, Four Symbols, Yin-Yang—countless terrifying Dao Intents colliding and regenerating endlessly within his gaze, emitting waves of extreme oppressive power that froze even the immortal qi flowing through the palace.

A soft sigh echoed through the hall.

"Finally, all thirty-six foundational Dao Intents have reached perfection!"

A trace of emotion flashed through Zhang Jing's eyes. With a thought, his consciousness instantly arrived at his Niwan Palace.

The faintly glowing jade talisman still occupied the central region, inscribed with dozens of different Dao Intents. The blank Primordial Dao Foundation quietly encircled it, while the peripheral areas teemed with various intents—ferocious demonic birds, blazing sun crows, beastly giant scales, mountain lords, molting spiritual insects—too numerous to count.

Zhang Jing's gaze swept over these Dao Intents before settling on the blank Primordial Dao Foundation. He could sense a subtle connection between them, an almost eager yearning like fledglings longing to return to their nest.

For a moment, he was tempted.

Should he fuse these Dao Intents into the Primordial Dao Foundation now?

Having cultivated the innate Primordial Immortal Light divine ability upon reaching the Golden Core realm was already remarkable. Even within the colossal Taiyi Immortal Sect, few in the Foundation Establishment realm could match his achievements.

But then realization struck.

"So this is the World Creation Path? Merely gathering these Dao Intents and the foundation creates this natural tendency toward unification. What kind of existence could have originally devised such a path?" he marveled inwardly.

After calming his thoughts, Zhang Jing re-examined the thirty-six intents. "Though they appear chaotic, there's inherent order—Yin-Yang and space-time, Five Elements and Eight Trigrams, earth-fire-wind-water, and the Four Symbols. What would happen if I fused them according to these patterns?"

The jade talisman suddenly blazed with light.

Different Dao Intents began merging systematically. The principles of the Lunar Dragon Serpent Intent spread through Zhang Jing's mind before manifesting in his Niwan Palace, intertwining directly with the Solar Golden Crow Intent.

Using Yin-Yang as foundation, other intents gradually merged in.

Time became meaningless.

When the process completed, the original multitude of intents had vanished, replaced by a single grayish spiritual light.

Zhang Jing examined the jade talisman's display:

[Innate Primordial Immortal Light (Pseudo)]

His gaze froze.

What did this mean? Using the jade talisman's fusion ability, he'd actually condensed the Innate Primordial Immortal Light—a capability meant for Golden Core cultivators on the World Creation Path—far ahead of time.

Wait—no!

Zhang Jing suddenly noticed the glaring "Pseudo" designation.

"Perhaps the true Innate Primordial Immortal Light relates not just to these thirty-six intents, but also to the Primordial Dao Foundation," he mused. Otherwise, he might have genuinely succeeded today.

That the jade talisman could achieve this didn't surprise him.

While the Primordial World contained terrifying principles of creation and cosmic manifestation, the mysterious talisman possessed even more formidable abilities in Dao evolution. In comparison, forming a pseudo version of the Immortal Light seemed perfectly reasonable.

Returning to reality, Zhang Jing opened his eyes, excitement and anticipation flashing across his face.

With a casual wave of his hand, a grayish immortal light appeared, sweeping forward at his will.

Where it passed, nearly imperceptible spatial cracks appeared—dark, devouring rifts edged with faint elemental energies that resisted the void's natural healing.
