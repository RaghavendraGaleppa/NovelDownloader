# Chapter 152: Many Artifacts and Spells, but Killing for Treasure Leads to Early Demise

Within Chu Ning's line of sight were three arrows.

Just one glance gave Chu Ning a very familiar feeling.

The next moment, Chu Ning directly took out a longbow from his storage bag.

It was precisely the Divine Wood Longbow he had bought from the Cloud Sea Pavilion back then.

After placing the two together, Chu Ning easily discerned that they were made of the same material.

He recalled what the female cultivator surnamed Zhang from the Cloud Sea Pavilion had said: this Divine Wood Longbow was originally a top-tier artifact.

However, because the arrows were lost, it could only condense arrows with spells, which reduced its power, so it was sold as a high-grade artifact.

Even so, it was still much more expensive than ordinary high-grade artifacts when Chu Ning bought it.

Chu Ning had never imagined that he would accidentally discover the arrows here.

Seeing that these arrows were placed with some miscellaneous items, Chu Ning guessed that they probably couldn't be used directly by themselves.

And this cultivator might have somewhat recognized that these arrows were of a certain grade, which was why he kept them in his storage bag.

Casually picking up an arrow, Chu Ning took the Divine Wood Longbow and placed the arrow on its string.

At the same time, the Verdant Wood Sword Art condensed onto the arrow.

"This power is indeed more than double what it was when I used spells to condense arrows before!"

A smile flashed across Chu Ning's face, and then he dispersed the condensed sword art.

At the same time, he looked at several other crystal-like objects.

Wood Spirit Crystals!

Having already encountered Earth Spirit Crystals and Fire Spirit Crystals, Chu Ning recognized the origin of the green crystals at a glance.

There were a full six Wood Spirit Crystals here, and their sizes were not small, which greatly pleased Chu Ning.

What surprised Chu Ning slightly was that, besides these two items, the person didn't have many other good things on them.

There wasn't a single artifact, and only one or two low-tier talismans.

Presumably, many were consumed during the previous battle.

However, the only jade slip in the storage bag caught Chu Ning's attention.

After inspecting it, he was surprised to find that it recorded an escape technique.

At this moment, Chu Ning carefully recalled the previous chase involving the three individuals.

This person flew in front, and although severely wounded and clearly low on spiritual power, the two behind him simply couldn't catch up.

"Could it be that he relied on this escape technique?"

Chu Ning thought to himself, picking up the jade slip and seriously reading the escape technique.

"A wind-element escape technique, yet it can be used with wood-element cultivation methods?"

When Chu Ning finished reading the contents of the jade slip, his eyes were full of surprise.

Among escape techniques, wind and lightning element techniques are generally recognized as the fastest.

It's hard to compare which is stronger, it depends on the specific secret art.

The jade slip recorded a movement technique called "Divine Wind Escape."

However, the escape technique within the jade slip had been modified, because the original technique required a Wind Spirit Root to be cast.

But now, the escape technique in this jade slip could be executed through a Wood Spirit Root and wood-element cultivation methods.

Although its speed was one-third slower than before, its practicality was much stronger.

After all, there were far more cultivators practicing wood-attribute cultivation methods than those with unusual spirit roots like the Wind Spirit Root.

Chu Ning felt an irresistible urge when he saw this cultivation method.

After firmly memorizing the incantations, he flew out of his cave dwelling. The next moment, he directly cast the escape technique towards the distant horizon.

In the blink of an eye, he appeared more than ten zhang away.

"So fast!"

Though Chu Ning was still not very proficient, he could still feel the power of this escape technique.

Purely in terms of speed, it might be a tiny bit slower than the Startling Thunder Step.

However, compared to the Startling Thunder Step, it also had many advantages. First, it allowed for flight.

The Startling Thunder Step could only be performed on the ground and could not be used for aerial flight.

Therefore, if Chu Ning were to engage in aerial combat, this escape technique would be more useful.

Secondly, this escape technique consumed extremely little spiritual power, which was also crucial for Chu Ning.

Of course, the Startling Thunder Step also had its advantages.

For short-distance bursts, the Startling Thunder Step was undoubtedly faster.

Furthermore, the Startling Thunder Step could also enhance the power of the Heavenly Gang Fist, making them better when used together.

"Coupled with the Wind Chasing Shuttle, which is suitable for longer-distance flight, these three each have their strengths and weaknesses, so they can complement each other well."

Chu Ning returned to his cave dwelling with a smile on his face.

Killing three Foundation Establishment cultivators in succession today was truly beyond his expectations.

However, the gains were undoubtedly substantial.

Including the Divine Wood Longbow, he had effectively gained two additional top-tier artifacts.

Besides high-grade artifacts, various elixirs, spirit stones... and this Divine Wind Escape technique.

"Killing for treasure, indeed!"

Chu Ning sighed, no wonder there were so many incidents of killing for treasure in the cultivation world.

It was indeed one of the fastest ways to gain benefits.

However, such matters also carried an extremely high risk; one careless mistake and you could be counter-killed.

Chu Ning had always been passive about such matters, yet he frequently encountered others who were主动, which left him with deep emotions.

At this moment, having tallied the benefits, Chu Ning had to consider the potential aftermath of today's unexpected event.

The square-faced cultivator, Pang Dajun, had mentioned that the two of them were from Shadow Moon Island and Azure Waves Island.

These two islands were among the top twenty islands in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, excluding Thousand Illusions Island.

During this period, Chu Ning had gained a more detailed understanding of the various powers involved.

Shadow Moon Island had deep connections with the Liu Family, one of the Alliance Lord families, while Azure Waves Island was closely tied to the Song Family.

"This means that if word of tonight's events gets out, I'll immediately face two of the Thousand Island Alliance's Alliance Lord families."

Thinking of this, Chu Ning felt quite a headache.

When he first came to the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands, he just wanted to cultivate peacefully and live a stable life.

But he never expected to be embroiled with several major families in just half a year.

What's more, Chu Ning felt quite wronged about tonight's incident.

He now vaguely guessed that what the three of them were fighting over was very likely the beast hide map he later obtained.

However, at the very beginning, the middle-aged cultivator's beast hide map was indeed not with him.

And afterward, it was already impossible to explain clearly.

Shaking his head, Chu Ning could only hope at this moment that the three had not left any other clues.

He had just specifically used his divine sense to investigate the scene, and there was nothing unusual present.

"However, the items I obtained are somewhat traceable, so I must be more careful when using them. Especially the items obtained from the cultivators of those two islands, it's best not to use them easily."

After secretly admonishing himself, Chu Ning resumed his daily cultivation.

Worried about any further unexpected events that night, Chu Ning didn't even sleep, cultivating the entire night.

What brought him some peace of mind was that nothing happened that night.

The next morning, after finishing his cultivation, Chu Ning went directly to tend to his spiritual plants and herbs.

Chu Ning first went to the medicinal garden of the Flame-Wood Twin-Born Fruits.

After carefully observing them, Chu Ning's eyebrows slightly twitched.

"The cultivation time for these Flame-Wood Twin-Born Fruits is truly not short. For the past half year, I've used Fire Spirit Crystals and the Profound Green Spring Bloom Art. I even had Little Spirit White come to help accelerate their growth. But they are still growing, with no signs of flowering or fruiting yet."

Chu Ning sensed the growth of these spiritual fruit trees and felt that it would probably take a few more years for them to produce spiritual fruits like the ones in his jade box.

"But I've already been in the Qi Condensation Completion realm for over half a year. It won't take several years to cultivate to great accomplishment in this realm and touch the threshold of Foundation Establishment."

Chu Ning muttered softly, then took out two green crystals from his storage bag.

These were the Wood Spirit Crystals he had obtained from the middle-aged cultivator yesterday.

He carefully calculated the positions and buried the Wood Spirit Crystals in the soil.

Chu Ning looked at the small medicinal garden, where the wood-attribute spiritual energy was slowly becoming denser, and nodded slightly.

Next, he wouldn't need to deliberately help these spiritual plants absorb only wood-attribute spiritual energy; he could help them absorb both wood and fire-attribute spiritual energy together.

This would likely make the Profound Green Spring Bloom Art even more effective.

After all, in the past half year, he could not only cast it instantly but also easily strip both wood and fire-attribute spiritual energy.

This was exactly what the Flame-Wood Twin-Born Fruits needed. If he further strengthened the casting intensity of the Profound Green Spring Bloom Art, he believed it could make these spiritual fruits mature much earlier. After casting the Profound Green Spring Bloom Art, Chu Ning emerged and began to move towards the other medicinal gardens and spiritual fields.

The Golden Orchid Fruits had already fully formed and would mature in no time; their cultivation was normal.

Chu Ning then went to the small spiritual field next door where Primordial Yang Fruits and Iron Stem Orchids were planted.

"Oh, it's fruiting!"

Seeing that one flower on an Iron Stem Orchid had already withered and borne a tiny fruit, Chu Ning immediately walked closer with delight to observe it.

Based on previous cultivation experience with Iron Stem Orchids, since they were already mature plants, if Chu Ning had cast spells with full effort, they should have bloomed within the first two months.

However, the growth of these Primordial Yang Fruits was much slower than the Golden Yuan Fruits Chu Ning had planted before.

To coordinate the flowering periods of the two spiritual plants, Chu Ning had to control the frequency of his spells on the Iron Stem Orchids.

This was to prevent the Iron Stem Orchids from blooming too early and being unable to complete the entire pollination and cultivation process.

More than twenty days ago, after some calculation, Chu Ning finally completed the pollination process.

And now, this Iron Stem Orchid had finally borne fruit.

Chu Ning carefully observed the fruit and found sparse reddish-brown spots on its brown surface.

His heart immediately filled with joy.

It was the same when he cultivated the Golden Orchid Fruits before; they initially only had golden-yellow spots.

Later, those golden spots spread throughout the entire spiritual fruit, completing its final cultivation.

The appearance of this spiritual fruit now was very similar to that of the past.

Naturally, it gave Chu Ning a glimmer of hope.

Although he still hadn't found a good method to break through his body tempering bottleneck, if he could cultivate body-tempering spiritual fruits, they would eventually be useful.

He looked at the several Iron Stem Orchids that had already borne fruit, finding that all these spiritual fruits were in a similar state, and Chu Ning nodded slightly.

"It seems the cross-pollination was successful, but whether it will truly succeed and what use these hybridized spiritual fruits will have, I'll only know after they fully grow."

Chu Ning once again cast the Profound Green Spring Bloom Art on these spiritual fruits.

This half-day of tending to spiritual herbs and plants was temporarily concluded, and Chu Ning naturally began his spell cultivation.

"I can practice this Divine Wind Escape more to become proficient, striving to maximize its speed while minimizing spiritual power consumption. The fusion technique for ten fireballs in the Blazing Fire Blazing Flame Art is complete, so I can begin the next stage of cultivation."

Chu Ning made up his mind, first cultivating the escape technique outside for a while.

Then he returned to his cave dwelling and began cultivating the Blazing Fire Blazing Flame Art.

"According to the cultivation method of the Blazing Fire Blazing Flame Art, after completing the cultivation of this fireball fusion technique, the next step is to learn to condense a fire-element demonic beast form called the Flame-Winged Bird. If this attack can be unleashed, it would be comparable to a typical mid-grade, middle-tier spell."

Chu Ning knew in his heart that once he condensed it, its attack power would be far greater than that.

According to the records in the Blazing Fire Blazing Flame Art, if ten fireballs were fused, it could achieve the attack power of a mid-grade, low-tier spell.

But in his hands, due to the bonus from his Noon Fire Spirit Physique, it should already be comparable to a mid-grade, middle-tier spell.

Thinking this, Chu Ning immediately formed a hand seal and began to condense flames, attempting to condense the attack form of the Flame-Winged Bird.

This cultivation lasted for most of the day, and Chu Ning only stopped when it was time to go out again in the afternoon to cast the Profound Green Spring Bloom Art on the spiritual plants and herbs.

However, when he walked out of the cultivation room, Chu Ning did not go directly to the medicinal garden but instead looked up towards the lake.

There, another ray of escape light appeared.

And judging by its direction, it was heading straight towards him.

"Could it be that someone has come looking for me?"

Chu Ning's vigilance rose sharply, and his face became serious.

He watched the approaching escape light, and when the other party entered the range of Flying Rainbow Island, a hint of surprise appeared on Chu Ning's face.

He actually knew the person who came; it was none other than Fairy Cen Ziqin, whom the cultivators of the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands referred to as Fairy Cen.

After landing on the island, this woman also flew towards Chu Ning's cave dwelling.

She arrived nearby in a short while, and then, as if sensing something, she stopped not far from Chu Ning's cave dwelling.

The next moment, a melodious voice rang out.

"Is this Daoist Chu's cave dwelling ahead?"

Thinking that this formation array was personally refined by Cen Ziqin, Chu Ning was not surprised that she could recognize it at a glance.

After several flashes of his figure, Chu Ning appeared outside his cave dwelling.

He looked at Cen Ziqin and smiled, "It is indeed me. Fairy Cen has graced me with your presence; I am sorry for not greeting you from afar."

"Daoist Chu is too modest. I happened to be passing by this area and remembered that Daoist lives on Flying Rainbow Island, so I took the liberty of coming to the island to disturb you."

Cen Ziqin descended directly in front of Chu Ning.

Then she looked at the Yanfeng behind Chu Ning and smiled, "Daoist Chu, this array is well-placed. If it weren't for the fact that the components of this array were personally refined by me, I might not have easily detected it for a while."

"It's mainly because Daoist's array is wondrous," Chu Ning said, then proactively invited, "Why doesn't Daoist Cen come in for a chat and perhaps offer some guidance on whether anything is improperly set up?"

Cen Ziqin did not refuse, and the two entered the cave dwelling one after another.

Even though Cen Ziqin was separated by the array just now, she couldn't see the specific condition of Chu Ning's cave dwelling.

Now that she was inside the cave dwelling, her face immediately filled with surprise.

"No wonder Daoist wanted that Spirit Locking Array; it turns out Daoist has a hidden spirit vein of no low quality here!"

As she spoke, her gaze fell upon Chu Ning.

"This should be a second-tier spirit vein. No wonder, after not seeing you for half a year, Daoist's cultivation has already advanced to the ninth level of Qi Condensation. It seems you are not far from Qi Condensation Completion either."

Ninth level of Qi Condensation—this was the aura Chu Ning had decided to reveal before going out to meet her.

After all, this hidden spirit vein was a second-tier spirit vein, and his eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation was still too low.

Chu Ning was not sure if Fairy Cen would have any other thoughts.

Now, revealing his ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivation, not far from Qi Condensation Completion, combined with some methods he had previously shown, and their cooperative relationship, Chu Ning felt that the other party would at least think a few more times.

Of course, Chu Ning still needed to make her give up completely.

So, he shook his head and smiled, "There is indeed a hidden spirit vein here, but this spirit vein is too small; it's a treasure to me. For a prominent family like Daoist Cen's, this spirit vein is just ordinary."

Chu Ning did not specifically state the grade of this second-tier spirit vein.

This hidden spirit vein was extremely special; even if Cen Ziqin was a Foundation Establishment cultivator, she wouldn't be able to know the specific grade of the spirit vein without directly touching and examining it.

Although Chu Ning's current cave dwelling was built upon this spirit vein, it did not directly touch the vein.

Therefore, Cen Ziqin could sense that it was a second-tier spirit vein, but she couldn't perceive its specific grade.

Cen Ziqin nodded slightly after hearing Chu Ning's words.

"That's true. The reason why several major families of the Thousand Island Alliance are all on Thousand Illusions Island is not only because the spirit vein on that island is a top-grade second-tier spirit vein but also because the spirit vein is large enough to support all the major families together."

She indeed didn't pay too much attention to this second-tier spirit vein. There were still some second-tier spirit veins in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands.

Their Cen family also controlled more than one location. While a hidden spirit vein surprised her somewhat, it wasn't enough to make her covet it.

She walked with Chu Ning to the outermost part of the cave dwelling, and seeing that Chu Ning's cave dwelling offered a view of the entire lake, Cen Ziqin turned to look at Chu Ning.

"Daoist Chu, you can see outside from here. I wonder if you've seen any unusual occurrences recently, such as Foundation Establishment cultivators fighting?"

Chu Ning listened to Cen Ziqin's words and replied with a normal expression, "Foundation Establishment cultivators fighting? The spiritual energy on these nearby islands is insufficient; there shouldn't be any Foundation Establishment cultivators, should there? Let alone Foundation Establishment cultivators, even ordinary cultivators are mostly invisible to me on the lake due to the convenience of the arrays in the Thousand Lakes and Thousand Islands."

As he spoke, Chu Ning asked with some curiosity, "Daoist Cen, why would you suddenly ask such a question?"

"It's nothing," Cen Ziqin gently shook her head. "It's just that some cultivators from nearby islands previously reported to the Alliance that there seemed to be Foundation Establishment cultivators fighting nearby. Our Cen family is currently the rotating Alliance Lord, so I was assigned to come here to take a look."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning secretly thought, "Just as expected."

He replied, "Oh, I really haven't noticed any cultivators coming near here these past two days."
