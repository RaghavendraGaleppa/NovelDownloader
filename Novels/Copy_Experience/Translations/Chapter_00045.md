**Chapter 45: Ascending to High-Grade Alchemist**

After a flash of green light, a line of text appeared before him:

"[First-Grade High-grade Alchemist: 57/100 (10x)]"

"Copy!"

With a low roar in his heart, a green light flashed, and a torrent of information surged forth, pouring into Lu Xu's mind.

Lu Xu remained dazed for a while, struggling to digest the immense influx of experience.

Once his eyes regained their lucidity, he glanced around the stone chamber. The high-grade alchemist's figure had already vanished.

"This isn't good. Could that old man be planning to get people to ambush me once he leaves?"

A thought like this flashed through Lu Xu's mind, and he immediately became restless.

He had originally intended to sell a few more items in this secret market to exchange for some spirit stones.

But now, it seemed impossible. He couldn't just wait around here; he had to leave.

Hastily rising, Lu Xu left the stone chamber after the high-grade alchemist.

Some gazes fell upon his retreating figure, but no one followed him.

For those other than alchemists, the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma didn't hold such strong appeal.

Moreover, what Lu Xu had used to exchange for the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma was a cultivation method that could rapidly increase cultivation in a short time.

In the eyes of others, he had most likely cultivated this very method.

If that was the case, his cultivation must be very high, with a high probability of being a formidable late-stage Qi Condensation expert.

No one would be willing to take that risk.

Lu Xu smoothly left the tavern, blending into the crowd. After changing his appearance once more, he flew towards Tianmen City.

Meanwhile, in front of the Imperial City of Weidu, an old man with a head full of silver hair arrived, his face grim.

After showing a token to the guards at the gate, he entered the Imperial City unimpeded.

This Imperial City, like Tianmen City, was protected by a third-tier grand formation, and it was said to contain a second-tier high-grade spirit vein within.

This was the Wei family's second most important stronghold, only surpassed by Tianmen City.

There were even rumors in the cultivation world that the Imperial City's grand formation was connected to Tianmen City's formation, acting as Yin and Yang. As long as one side remained unbroken, the other would be impregnable.

However, whether this rumor was true or not, only the Wei family knew.

The number of cultivators within the Imperial City was quite considerable. Along the way, the old man continuously encountered many cultivators at the early and mid-stages of Qi Condensation.

Regardless of gender or age, all of them would respectfully step aside when they saw him, their faces deferential.

This showed that the silver-haired old man's status in the Imperial City was indeed quite high.

He wound through several paths, finally arriving at a waterside pavilion built by a lake.

Two figures stood there: one was dressed as a guard, appearing to be a middle-aged man, while the other was quite young, looking to be in his twenties.

What was striking was that this young man was wearing a python robe.

Python robes didn't seem to be a rare attire in the cultivation world; cultivators could wear them if they wished, and no one would stop them.

However, within this imperial palace, it was quite extraordinary, clearly indicating his extraordinary status.

This young man had handsome features, an impressive demeanor, and exuded an aura of approachability.

The silver-haired old man walked over with a gloomy expression. Seeing his face, the two in the waterside pavilion seemed to realize something, and both their expressions darkened.

"Elder Hong, did you get the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma?" the python-robed man asked first.

The silver-haired old man sighed:

"Someone intercepted it. The owner of the spirit ganoderma wanted a cultivation method that could quickly increase cultivation, and I don't have such an item!"

Although they had somewhat predicted this, hearing the words still caused the two men's faces to slowly turn ugly.

"Your Highness, what should we do? Without a Barrier-Breaking Pill, even with Your Highness's high-grade spirit root aptitude, it would take at least two more years to break through the late-stage bottleneck!" The guard said, a hint of worry flashing in his eyes.

The python-robed man's face was extremely grim. He walked back and forth slowly, with his hands clasped behind his back. After a long silence, he finally spoke:

"It seems I'll have to use the family's contribution points to exchange for a Barrier-Breaking Pill!"

The guard was immediately shocked:

"But if you do that, Your Highness's cultivation progress after entering the late-stage Qi Condensation will be greatly affected. If you fall even one step behind, you might not be able to compete with those few others in the future!"

The silver-haired old man also shook his head repeatedly: "One step behind means every step behind. Those few princes and princesses won't wait for Your Highness. The throne is tied to the Foundation Establishment Pill, and everyone is fighting desperately for it. Your Highness must deliberate carefully!"

"With Elder Hong by my side, even if I fall a step behind, I'm confident I can catch up!" the python-robed man said.

Upon hearing this, the silver-haired old man quickly denied it: "While I favor Your Fourth Highness, I cannot interfere too much in matters like this!"

The python-robed man frowned, a hint of displeasure flashing in his eyes.

But immediately, a gentle smile returned to his face, and he said warmly:

"Since Elder Hong thinks this way, I will not put you in a difficult position!"

The guard beside him was somewhat unwilling: "Elder Hong, could you tell the identity of the person who took the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma?"

The silver-haired old man shook his head: "I couldn't use my Spirit Eye Technique at the secret market's exchange fair, so I couldn't ascertain that person's identity!"

"Since he competed for the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma, he must be a high-grade alchemist, right?" the guard asked again.

Hearing this, the silver-haired old man frowned:

"Besides me, the only high-grade alchemist in Tianmen City is His Highness's Imperial Uncle. That person couldn't have been him!"

"Then it must be some mid-grade alchemist. This person might be attempting to break through to high-grade alchemist, which is why they competed for the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma!" the guard analyzed.

The python-robed man shook his head: "It couldn't be a mid-grade alchemist from our Wei family, nor could it be a mid-grade alchemist from the Hundred Herbs Pavilion. They wouldn't need to do something like this!"

"There are only one or two mid-grade rogue alchemists. We'll find out if we ask them!" the guard said, a trace of unwillingness on his face, looking as if he wanted to investigate to the very end.

The silver-haired old man pondered for a moment, then slowly said:

"Speaking of which, in recent years, some mysterious mid-grade alchemists have indeed appeared in Tianmen City!"

"Some?"

"Yes, many different faces. They all came to buy materials for refining Qi Nourishing Pills, and they bought a lot!" the silver-haired old man said slowly, stroking his beard.

The python-robed man scoffed when he heard this: "How could so many mid-grade alchemists suddenly appear? It must be the same person!"

"It seems this person's identity is questionable, otherwise, they wouldn't need to change their appearance every time they go to buy spiritual herbs!"

"And this mysterious mid-grade alchemist now wants to break through to high-grade alchemist!" A glint flashed in the silver-haired old man's eyes.

"Your Highness, we must find this person!" the guard immediately suggested.

"Indeed, we must find this person!" the python-robed man nodded.

A formidable alchemist with the potential to ascend to high-grade alchemist was someone he couldn't let go. If he could control this person, the benefits for him would be immeasurable!

"If Your Highness wishes to find this person, this old man might have an idea!" the silver-haired old man said with a chuckle.
