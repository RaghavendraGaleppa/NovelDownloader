# Chapter 73: Elder Tianyuan  

"Mm." Lin Xuan nodded, adopting the demeanor of a senior cultivator. "Then I'll trouble you two junior brothers. I've come to purchase some talismans."  

Located on the borderlands, Yanzhou was backward in terms of cultivation development. Unlike regions teeming with sects and cultivators, there were no dedicated markets for trading cultivation items. However, the Dao Talisman Mountain Sect was a unique exception. While their cultivators' strength was not particularly high, their mastery of talisman-making made them a force to be reckoned with.  

Aside from specially crafted talismans, their disciples often produced many talismans during their training. Unable to use them all, they would sell or trade them with other cultivators.  

Of course, not just anyone could purchase them.  

Low-grade talismans were available to anyone who could pay with spirit stones or items of equivalent value—no questions asked. After all, these talismans only contained low-level spells.  

Mid-grade talismans were sold exclusively to allied sects, such as the Drifting Cloud Valley, or cultivation families affiliated with Dao Talisman Mountain.  

As for high-grade talismans, their distribution was strictly controlled. Typically, they were only used for internal exchanges among sect disciples. Even allies were rarely sold these talismans unless under special circumstances.  

After all, the power of high-grade talismans was immense.  

Lin Xuan had thoroughly researched Dao Talisman Mountain's rules before his arrival. His goal was to purchase mid-grade talismans, which should be feasible given his status as a Drifting Cloud Valley disciple.  

Of course, he would have to play it by ear. If possible, he would try to acquire some high-grade talismans as well. With those, even if he encountered a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he would have a better chance of escaping.  

As a customer—and a peak Qi Condensation expert at that—the two junior disciples didn't dare to slight him. After exchanging glances, the one on the left spoke up, "In that case, Junior Brother Zhang will remain on guard here, while I escort Senior Brother Ye into the sect."  

"Much obliged."  

Lin Xuan smiled faintly and activated his Wind Riding Technique, his movements light and graceful, as if floating on air. The two junior disciples watched in awe, their admiration growing.  

"Senior Brother, your timing is perfect. Today happens to be our sect's monthly Talisman Gathering."  

"Talisman Gathering?"  

"Yes," the guiding disciple nodded. "Our Dao Talisman Mountain holds a gathering once a month where our disciples and visiting friends can trade and purchase talismans." Speaking of his sect's proud tradition, the disciple's face flushed with excitement. "Although talismans are available for sale at other times, the variety and quality during the Talisman Gathering are far superior."  

Lin Xuan's expression remained neutral, but inwardly, he was pleased. It seemed luck was on his side.  

---  

As they traveled, the two conversed. Through subtle probing, Lin Xuan learned much about Dao Talisman Mountain from the junior disciple.  

Eager to please a senior at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, the disciple answered every question without reservation. In return, Lin Xuan casually offered a few pointers on cultivation techniques, which thrilled the disciple and made him even more forthcoming. This allowed Lin Xuan to uncover additional secrets.  

Lin Xuan wasn't particularly interested in prying into another sect's affairs. However, as a newcomer to unfamiliar territory—even if it was an allied sect—it was prudent to gather as much information as possible to ensure a smooth visit.  

"Senior Brother wishes to purchase high-grade talismans?"  

Seeing the disciple's guileless nature, Lin Xuan cautiously broached the subject, hoping to test the waters and see if there was a way to acquire high-grade talismans.  

"That might be difficult," Wang Xin frowned. "The elders strictly control high-grade talismans. Even our own disciples rarely have access to them."  

"Is there no way?"  

"Well, not exactly," Wang Xin pondered. "It largely depends on luck. If Senior Brother can meet Elder Tianyuan, you might get what you want."  

"Elder Tianyuan?"  

Lin Xuan silently repeated the name. Though his cultivation was now considerable, he rarely left the valley. Apart from experts from his own sect and a few troublesome figures from the Fire Spirit Sect—whom he had researched for this trip—he knew little about the prominent figures of other sects and families.  

Seeing Lin Xuan's blank expression, Wang Xin was both surprised and disappointed. "Senior Brother has never heard of Elder Tianyuan?"  

"Heh, I prefer seclusion and know little about external affairs."  

Hearing this, Wang Xin relaxed. It made sense—if this senior brother wasn't a diligent cultivator, how could he have reached the peak of Qi Condensation at such a young age, even with excellent spiritual roots?  

Clearing his throat, Wang Xin began recounting the exploits of this esteemed elder with great enthusiasm.  

Compared to Drifting Cloud Valley and the Fire Spirit Sect, Dao Talisman Mountain was slightly weaker, lacking a Core Formation expert. But one should never underestimate them—these millennia-old sects had deep reserves and always harbored formidable individuals.  

Take Elder Tianyuan, for example.  

The strongest expert in Dao Talisman Mountain!  

Though only a Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was said that in actual combat, he might not necessarily lose to a Core Formation expert.  

"What?" Lin Xuan was stunned. Even his usual composure couldn't mask his shock—though part of the reason was that he was currently disguised as Ye Tian using the Heavenly Demon Transformation Art, so he didn't need to suppress his reactions.  

No wonder he was astonished. Lin Xuan had been in the cultivation world for some time, but this was the first he'd heard of someone challenging cultivators a full realm above them.  

Challenging someone of a higher level didn't refer to a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator defeating a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator. While rare, such cases weren't unheard of—after all, they were within the same realm. With superior artifacts or tactics, the weaker party could sometimes prevail.  

But challenging across realms? That meant a Qi Condensation cultivator defeating a Foundation Establishment cultivator, or a Foundation Establishment cultivator defeating a Core Formation expert...  

Within the same realm, the difference in strength was manageable. But crossing realms was an entirely different matter. For example, the gap between peak Qi Condensation and early Foundation Establishment was a single step, yet the disparity in power was like heaven and earth. How could Elder Tianyuan be so formidable as to challenge someone a whole realm above him?
