# Chapter 156: Forging True Skill with Worldly Fire

Lu Zizai, dressed in simple hemp robes, countered, "What's the use of clinging to outward appearances?"

The bamboo forest was a vibrant, dripping green, and the bright, shimmering fire spring illuminated his handsome young face, making it seem to glow, his bearing exceptional.

His expression was calm as he said, "I am currently Lu Zizai, an 18-year-old newcomer to the Six Imperial Cultivation, ready to run at any moment."

Qin Ming's suspicion hadn't lessened; he felt a certain wariness. But since Lu Zizai himself said as much, it was indeed unwise to probe further.

"Then how should I address you, Senior Brother Lu?"

The youth in hemp robes had already stated he didn't cling to appearances, so Qin Ming naturally had to let go of his reservations as well. Thus, he cautiously... probed.

"Alright, that's a good address," Lu Zizai nodded, a smile gracing his lips.

Qin Ming immediately realized that the youth in hemp robes disliked being called old; addressing him this way was perfectly to his liking.

"Senior Brother, how did you cultivate your Tri-Imperial Force? I feel like no one among the new disciples can withstand it," Qin Ming asked humbly.

Lu Zizai shook his head. "You can't say that. Scriptures like the Jade Clarity Tome and the Tathagata Method are no weaker than the Six Imperial Heart Scripture, not to mention the lost Heaven-Severing Stratagem and others."

He then countered, "How do you think my first three Imperial Forces evolved?" This was clearly a test.

After pondering, Qin Ming said, "The energies of Yin and Yang can transform heaven and earth. A wisp of purple qi arrives from beyond the mortal realm, possessing the potential to give birth to all things."

Lu Zizai said, "You have some insight, but there's no need to cling to the methods of predecessors. What you described sounds quite like the path of a vanished dao lineage."

From beginning to end, Qin Ming's eyes were fervent, clearly indicating his desire to learn cultivation methods from him.

Lu Zizai said, "The path I walked before had some issues. I have nothing to teach you now, as I'm currently reorganizing and reviewing my past. Alas, true gold fears no fire, and true cultivation should be the same."

"Senior Brother Lu possesses great foresight; this junior is far inferior."

Lu Zizai shook his head, "Are you and I flattering each other?"

"I want to learn true cultivation!" Qin Ming stated without hesitation.

Lu Zizai's expression turned serious. "Like you, I am still on the path, still in the process of forging true gold. I am striving to forget everything from the past, wishing to learn it all over again from the beginning."

Qin Ming was startled. He didn't feel like Lu Zizai was being perfunctory. If he truly intended to do this, his demands on himself were unbelievably high. Did he actually want to abandon all his previous cultivation?

"Isn't the path of the Six Imperial Cultivation strong enough?" he couldn't help but ask.

Lu Zizai sighed, "That depends on who you're comparing yourself to. In the novice stage, you and I are both very strong. But when you've endured years of hardship and reached your peak, your most glorious moment, only to find that you can merely contend with others, unable to look down upon all heroes under heaven... At that point, you'll have a realization. You'll ask yourself, is this path correct? Is it strong? Is it true cultivation that can withstand the test of 'Worldly Fire'?"

Qin Ming felt a certain resonance now, for he, too, had experienced similar stirrings.

In his daily life, he strictly demanded of himself, cultivating diligently to enhance his strength, imagining his opponents in their strongest forms. This was because he was benchmarking against the Esoteric Sect and the lands beyond the mundane.

He asked, "Senior Brother Lu, are you comparing it to other paths?"

Lu Zizai nodded, his expression serious. "Indeed. If you have talent, you should aim further. In the later stages, you'll discover how difficult this path truly is."

He then asked, "Is the Ancestor of the Six Imperial Cultivation strong?"

Qin Ming immediately replied, "Naturally, immensely powerful."

Lu Zizai's voice was calm. "Do you know that even someone as strong as the Ancestor was once subjected to attempts to force him into servitude as a strongman?"

"What?" Qin Ming was stunned.

Although he knew the Ancestor of the Six Imperial Cultivation had ultimately resisted successfully and wasn't forced into servitude, it still sufficiently illustrated the severity of the situation back then.

Lu Zizai said, "Don't be complacent. The opponents we are eyeing on other paths are truly numerous, in fact, one could say there are far too many."

Qin Ming nodded. He naturally took these words to heart, as he had already considered these matters before.

Lu Zizai said, "Given the talent in our bone structures, we must take a few more steps forward and diligently forge our path. Otherwise, without the Ancestor's protection, our ultimate future won't be good. Even someone as strong as the Young Ancestor might be forced into servitude."

"Is the gap that vast?" Qin Ming's brows furrowed deeply.

"There are mainly two issues. Firstly, time. We need to endure and accumulate, undergoing the baptism of years to gradually rise. This is currently being overcome. Secondly, in the most cutting-edge domains, we are making arduous progress, too slowly, and we can already see the end point. Other paths, however, are still expanding, far from reaching their culmination."

Lu Zizai appeared uninhibited and his temperament was ethereal, yet he was filled with worry for this path. The further he gazed, the more boundless pressure he felt.

"The Ancestor of the Six Imperial Cultivation isn't really going to have problems, is he?" Qin Ming asked.

"Rest assured, he pulled through again. But eventually, people grow old and die. What about the next life?" Lu Zizai sighed.

Qin Ming was dumbfounded; this was a lot of information!

"Senior Brother Lu, is there truly nothing you can teach me?" He was far too eager to advance. With the advent of a great era, all paths were expanding forward, and he naturally hoped to constantly grow stronger and push ahead rapidly.

"How many extraordinary skills have you cultivated, and how many types of force methods?" Lu Zizai asked.

Qin Ming thought for a moment and honestly explained his situation.

"Hiss, what kind of combination is that? Why does it seem so familiar? It's not another cultivation method that will lead you to a dead end, is it?" Lu Zizai's expression turned grave.

He then asked, "Did you try combining all these yourself?"

"Yes!" Qin Ming nodded.

"You're relying solely on your innate talent to push through!" Lu Zizai said.

"Is there a problem?" Qin Ming felt a little uneasy. He certainly didn't view the person before him as just a young boy, but rather as an extraordinary "renowned master."

"Historically, there have been two or three similar paths, and they all ended in extinction," Lu Zizai said.

Qin Ming felt a sinking feeling. Why did it sound like he was talking about the methods on the silk scroll?

He asked, "Is there a solution?"

"Either you power through to the very end, enduring until dawn appears and you break free like a butterfly from its cocoon. Or you address it proactively, constantly refining and discarding the dross to keep only the essence," Lu Zizai said.

Qin Ming pondered. His Heavenly Light Force had always been undergoing qualitative changes, without any abnormalities.

"When I was reorganizing my previous path, I felt that the Six Imperial Heart Scripture also had problems, causing the later stages of the path to be blocked and making it difficult to expand into the most cutting-edge new domains. Currently, I've devised a method which I call 'Worldly Fire.' It can refine true cultivation with fire and discern whether the cultivated force method is compatible with one's own constitution."

According to Lu Zizai, everyone's physique is different, and the problems they face naturally vary. As soon as one perceives even a slight incompatibility between a cultivated technique and oneself, it's best not to continue, otherwise the problem will continuously amplify along the future path.

Moreover, he frankly admitted that understanding the 'Worldly Fire Forging True Skill' thoroughly was extremely difficult. He hadn't fully sorted it out himself, so Qin Ming probably wouldn't be able to learn it.

"This is something I've prepared for the future fresh blood of the Six Imperial Cultivation. I've walked this path myself, but if I were to teach it to others, the method isn't yet mature."

Qin Ming's spirits lifted. "Senior Brother Lu, please impart this true method to me! I should be able to learn it!"

Lu Zizai said, "Observing your Heavenly Light Force, it seems you've blundered your way through it, which indicates your physical talent is indeed ridiculously strong. However, your comprehension in this aspect still needs testing. Otherwise, I fear I might harm you; if you cultivate incorrectly, you could suffer mental derangement."

Qin Ming, however, was full of confidence. Having encountered such an expert, he didn't want to miss out on "Worldly Fire."

Lu Zizai shook his head. "It's hard to say. There's an old fellow whose strength could uproot mountains, his hands practically able to hold up the sky. He relied solely on his peerless physical talent to cultivate brute force and forcibly forge a path, but his comprehension truly wasn't great."

Qin Ming suspected he was referring to the Ancestor of the Heaven-Bearing lineage.

Legend had it that when that Ancestor practiced the "Fate-Altering Scripture," he was very down-to-earth, constantly grumbling and almost tearing the book apart.

"You came here to cultivate the 'River-Connecting Scripture,' didn't you? That'll be a good test of your comprehension," Lu Zizai said with a smile.

The eighteen-year-old youth's entire body flowed with a natural, fresh aura. Under Qin Ming's astonished gaze, the silvery-white color at Lu Zizai's hair roots completely vanished.

"Mm, having a simple sparring match and exchange with you, I've gained some insights myself. The novice domain is now perfected," Lu Zizai's life aura seemed to have grown stronger by another notch.

***

In the stone mountain region, not only Zhou Shize and Zhou Tao stood at a distance, but many other elders who had received the news also arrived, silently standing guard.

There were no young disciples left in this area; they had all been sent away.

Subsequently, a hunched old man appeared. He was skin and bones, with only a few strands of hair on his head, and his teeth were almost completely gone.

A group of elders immediately stepped forward and bowed.

He was the Young Ancestor's eldest disciple, utterly gaunt and truly ancient. He looked at the group of elders and said, "Rise."

"Inside..." Someone began to speak.

"Don't concern yourselves. Act as if you've seen nothing and have no thoughts. Let nature take its course," the Young Ancestor's eldest disciple said sternly.

"I've always been quick at comprehending scriptures!" Qin Ming was very confident in himself.

Lu Zizai said, "Back then, I also studied the 'River-Connecting Scripture.' It seems I fully grasped it and cultivated the River-Connecting Force in about five or six days."

"That fast?" Qin Ming exclaimed in admiration.

"Mm, my comprehension is stronger than my physical talent," Lu Zizai nodded, showing a youthful, spirited demeanor.

Qin Ming said, "Then I'll see how long it takes me to fully grasp it and cultivate the River-Connecting Force!"

Lu Zizai nodded. "Mm, in terms of comprehension, if you merely come close to me, you'll be able to thoroughly comprehend this 'Worldly Fire,' even though it's not yet fully mature."

Inside the stone mountain, in a carved-out meditation chamber, a subterranean spring gushed forth, a small stream flowed through a cave, and the lower space connected to an underground lake.

This environment was prepared specifically for cultivating the "River-Connecting Scripture."

On a stone table, a book exuded the scent of ink, clearly a handwritten copy.

Both the original and earlier handwritten copies contained annotations from predecessors, who had penned many insights.

The elders of the Six Imperial Cultivation, in presenting these extraordinary skills, also wished to test the four anomalies and observe their comprehension. Naturally, they wouldn't provide annotated secret manuals.

Qin Ming sat on the stone chair, flipping through the River-Connecting Scripture page by page. Before long, he would stand up and practice the methods by the subterranean spring, raising layers of mist.

He secretly sighed, this was indeed a top-tier extraordinary skill, with endless wondrous applications.

If unleashed by a river or sea, its power would surge dramatically!

Moreover, as he comprehended, his entire demeanor changed; he became gentle, boundless with vitality, and his whole body was enveloped by mist.

"Truly an extraordinary scripture!" Qin Ming praised.

If this cultivation method were unleashed during a heavy rain, every raindrop in heaven and earth could transform into a weapon.

Furthermore, who does not have water within their body?

Qin Ming diligently comprehended and continuously practiced the methods, gaining immense benefits. Finally, on the fourth day, he fully grasped the scripture and cultivated the River-Connecting Force.

As he cast his spell, boundless mist surged, expanding out of the meditation chamber, merging with the night fog. His spiritual thoughts seemed to spread into the distance as well.

Qin Ming felt a little tired. He leaned on the stone table for a brief nap, but even in his semi-conscious state, the mist continued to spread outwards.

Vaguely, he heard a sound and saw a blurry image.

In the distance, a faintly discernible young man, appearing to be under thirty, spoke, "Zizai, why aren't you leaving yet?"

This person was extraordinary, seemingly controlling the Six Auras to roam the Grand Emptiness.

Behind him was a boundless, dense black mist. Within the mist stood a colossal, heaven-reaching figure, similar in appearance to him, stained with blood, emanating an immense sense of oppression.

"Soon, I'll leave right away. There's still a karmic connection that remains unresolved," Lu Zizai's figure appeared, the eighteen-year-old youth, whose bearing was extraordinary with every glance, enveloped in an ethereal aura.

Behind him, too, was a dense night fog, and simultaneously, a colossal figure. However, it was a head shorter than the giant opposite, its aura terrifying, radiating golden light in all directions.

"What's going on?" Even in his half-asleep, half-awake state, Qin Ming felt his mind and consciousness trembling.
