Chapter 300: The Ghost Peak’s Hidden Weapon, The Ghost Python Silver Spear

Li Xian’s venom injury had fully recovered, and the news spread quickly. The many elders all came to offer their congratulations. Ye Cheng told Li Xian that after recovering from a serious injury, a banquet should be held to celebrate, to dispel any bad luck, and to declare to everyone that they should no longer covet his beautiful wife or his wealth. Li Xian followed his advice and set up a banquet, inviting commoners, disciples, elders, and others.

The entire affair cost over a hundred taels of silver.

The wine and dishes at the banquet were all top-quality. There were "Steamed Perch," "Peach Blossom Fresh Brew," "Creamy Crispy Crab"... a rich variety of river delicacies, seafood, and mountain fare.

After the banquet, several Flower Cage Sect disciples wished to join Li Xian’s faction.

The Flower Cage Sect was loose and disorderly. Its disciples came from all walks of life, many of humble origins with low martial arts skill, making them of little use. The elders within the sect would cultivate loyal followers and recruit disciples to serve them. Those who wished to be valued and climb the ranks would also actively attach themselves to elders, doing their bidding, running errands and flattering them in exchange for a future.

Although Li Xian was temporarily a "Token Holding Disciple," the position of "Preparatory Elder" was within his grasp, a fact known to all. Only because of his lack of seniority was it not publicly announced yet. Thus, those who were opportunistic and clever came to join his faction first, showing their loyalty in exchange for his attention.

Li Xian had no intention of "forming factions" for the time being, so he politely refused them all. Though the disciples felt regret, they dared not say more. When the banquet ended, the matter was temporarily settled. Both internal and external troubles were quelled.

The great enemy, Hao Qingshe, had already left the island.

In the remaining days, he could quietly practice martial arts and temper his martial path.

On this day.

[Wind-Concealing Breath]
[Mastery: 396/1000 Proficient]

Li Xian’s breathing was peculiar. It varied in length, depth, and rhythm. His chest would sometimes swell like a ball, and at other times shrink like a concave board. Every dozen breaths or so, he would exhale a wisp of turbid, impure gas.

Although the Wind-Concealing Breath was a "basic martial art," it was profound and extensive, passed down through generations and perfected. It was a secret technique of the Nan Gong Qiu lineage. Everyone breathes, but the Wind-Concealing Breath could be practiced at all times, warding off poison and strengthening the body, detoxifying and maintaining health...

The poison of the "Yin Demon Heart-Devouring Palm" was completely eradicated. Li Xian’s blood and energy were abundant, and he had recovered well, leaving not a trace of hidden injury. Nan Gong Qiu couldn’t help but be both happy and surprised, deeply feeling that Li Xian’s physique was robust and extraordinary, unlike that of an ordinary person, with a tremendous ability to expel and neutralize toxins.

She also thought that the strength of this body was not limited to that. Her pretty face flushed slightly, her thoughts drifted, and a hint of spring and shyness was hidden in her brows and eyes.

The days were peaceful, pleasant, and carefree.

Nan Gong Qiu cared for him meticulously, grateful for his rescue. Every time she recalled it, she couldn’t help but feel her heart stir: "How many women in this world can truly have a man risk his life to save them?" Her heart felt as if it were filled with honey, an indescribable joy.

She treated him even more gently, as tender as water, her heart on the verge of melting.

The woman with the surname Huang was in stable condition, and the blood holes all over her body were gradually scabbing over. Li Xian spent dozens of taels of silver to purchase herbs and exotic medicines... boiling them into a medicinal soup to help the woman with her medicinal baths. Her condition was improving day by day, but it would be extremely difficult to fully recover.

Li Xian could only do his best and ask for no more. His martial arts advanced, and he made daily progress. The "Wraith-Weaving Spear" was nearing perfection. Nan Gong Qiu practiced martial arts with Li Xian all day, studying the Five Elements, and was immensely enjoying herself. Whenever she was drenched in sweat from exhaustion, she would enter the clam-shell for a medicinal bath.

She was truly studying the Flower Cage’s miscellaneous books, such as the "Flower Chain Manual," "Sleepless Moon-Gazing Record," and "Jade-Painting Diagram." At first, she was blushing and her mind was unsettled, her body agitated. She couldn’t help but curse the Flower Cage Sect for being improper, always researching these various tricks. How could such wicked books exist in the world? They should all be burned for peace.

If it weren’t for Li Xian... she would never have been willing to do such things with anyone. But after learning and achieving some success, and trying a few things according to the miscellaneous books, she found it was indeed very different. She couldn’t help but think that the Flower Cage Sect was quite adept in this art. Learning it to temper her emotions wasn’t entirely unacceptable.

The two of them deeply grasped the sect’s essential principles, turning the world upside down, enjoying themselves to the fullest. A few days later, news suddenly arrived that Li Xian had been promoted to the "Patterned Seal Disciple" of the Flower Cage Sect, a high rank within the sect.

His strength was formidable. The disciples all admired him. Chief Envoy Shi and Yan Hao had a good impression of him. Ye Cheng had drawn him into the sect. Tang Feng admired his style. Han Zisha sought profit with him. Meng Han avoided him.

Furthermore, on the arena, Li Xian wielded his "Wraith-Weaving Spear" technique with an eerie, ghostly aura, achieving a very deep level of proficiency. No one dared to disobey.

Unconsciously, Li Xian had already firmly established his footing. His promotion to "Patterned Seal Disciple" was a natural consequence.

He arrived at the inner island with his token and registered his name at the Climbing Branch Pavilion, being recorded as a 'Patterned Seal Disciple'. This matter was under Meng Han's management, who, under the pretext of sick leave, did not dare to meet him, acting in a narrow and sneaky manner.

Patterned Seal Disciples were already at the sect's core level. They could receive stipends and merit money each month, and enjoyed discounts at the inner island's 'Hundred Weapons Pavilion' and 'Hundred Flowers Pavilion'.

They could also accept missions and lead followers out to "seek flowers." If the search was successful and a target was captured and brought back to the Water Altar, the rewards in merit money and stipends were substantial. Although Li Xian had industries on the island, if he wanted to establish his foundation quickly, accepting missions to go out and seek flowers was of the utmost importance. Li Xian benefited greatly from being in the Flower Cage Sect, but he ultimately found it difficult to harm innocent people.

The Flower Cage Sect had a loose structure. Where there is advantage, there is also disadvantage. Entry was easy, and the disciples were numerous. Although the hierarchy was strict, due to the sect's fluidity and looseness, the protection and cultivation given to disciples and even elders were not as good as that of the Lishan Sword Sect. Thus, if one wanted money to spend, they had to run their own business.

Although Li Xian had been promoted to "Patterned Seal Disciple," he had not left the island to seek flowers. He stayed at home, practicing martial arts alone. When he had some spare time, he would use the remaining "Peach Blossom Spirit Tree trunk" to make fishing rods and go fishing by the lake for fun.

Recently... more and more flower boats had been docking at the shore. The Flower Cage Sect elders had all gathered at the Water Altar, seemingly discussing some extremely important matter. Shi Yufei was busy with事务 and had not come to find Li Xian.

[Minor Five Elements Strange Escape]
[Mastery: 56/100]

[Wraith-Weaving Spear]
[Mastery: 15/35000 Perfect]

[Description: You have grasped the 'Ghost Coiling Body' trait. Like a vengeful ghost coiling around you, illness follows you, nightmares accompany you, your lifespan decays, and you grow thinner day by day. But because you possess the 'Divine Ghost Ferocious Robe,' the ghost coiling body cannot invade you. All its evil effects are useless against you.]

Li Xian’s learning was deepening by the day. He advanced on all fronts. His skill in the Strange Escape of the Five Elements was not insignificant, and the Wraith-Weaving Spear had also reached perfection. The spear’s momentum was unpredictable, and with various traits added to his body, his strength was unfathomable.

In the blink of an eye, it was already October. The sultry weather was gradually cooling down, and it was late autumn, the beginning of winter. The crops in the fields were mature and fragrant, the golden rice ears pleasing to the eye. It was a busy farming season.

Fruit trees by the roadside bore large fruits. Dongran Lake was rich in "crabs," "fish," and "shrimp." Autumn was the season for "shrimp to ripen." Around the island, palm-sized, plump shrimp were everywhere. Even a three-year-old child, holding an iron net and scooping it into the lake, could fill a basin, and dinner would be ready.

This was the "Tail-Pointing Shrimp." It was an excellent ingredient from Dongran Lake. The Lishan Sword Sect, the Overturning River Sect, and other forces by the lake all loved to eat "Tail-Pointing Shrimp."

The shrimp’s meat was firm, and its oil was thick. Simply cooked, it was already a rare delicacy. Unfortunately, it needed to be cooked immediately after leaving the water. For every moment delayed, its freshness would be lost.

If left overnight.

The plump oil would turn into foul water, making it unpalatable. Thus, by the lake shore, one could see commoners everywhere holding "long poles," vigorously slapping the lake surface. Water splashed, and the Tail-Pointing Shrimp, stunned, floated to the surface.

Because the Tail-Pointing Shrimp needed to be eaten as soon as it left the water, the islanders were never greedy. Once they felt they had enough for the whole family to eat, they would put them in a basket and go home to cook and prepare them. Li Xian was very curious and also picked up a wooden pole to slap the lake surface.

The force of his slap was extraordinary. Water splashed several zhang high, and a whole patch of Tail-Pointing Shrimp floated to the surface. Li Xian had a great appetite. He picked up ten Tail-Pointing Shrimp, filled his basin, and returned to the Green Ox Residence.

Li Xian exhausted all his ingenuity. He prepared the Tail-Pointing Shrimp to be perfect in color, aroma, and taste, with a variety of styles. The moment the oil entered his mouth, the deliciousness was boundless and truly indescribable. Nan Gong Qiu couldn’t help but sigh with emotion that being trapped in the Flower Cage Sect had some small benefits.

This was how he spent his days in peace, accumulating his foundation.

On this day.

Chief Envoy Shi finally had some free time and came to visit Li Xian. He felt his pulse and checked his physical condition. He only felt that his blood was like lead and mercury, his spirit and energy were vigorous, and his injury had indeed recovered. Thus, he put his mind at ease.

He chatted with Li Xian for a while. He inquired about the recent progress of Li Xian’s "Wraith-Weaping Spear" practice. Li Xian was slightly evasive, only saying that he had cultivated it to the "Great Completion" realm. Chief Envoy Shi repeatedly sighed with emotion that Li Xian was blessed with natural advantages and was very compatible with this spear technique. He might even be able to receive the true teachings of the Candle Sect.

He then said: "If I remember correctly, there is a Ghost Peak on the island. A silver spear is wedged between the rocks inside. You have exquisite spear techniques but no suitable weapon. This cannot be considered perfect. If you have the idea, you can go and take it. This item has been left unused for a long time and was originally ownerless. But there may be dangers, you need to consider it yourself."

Li Xian asked: "Oh? What kind of spear? Why is it wedged in the Ghost Peak?" He knew the "Ghost Peak" was on the northwest side of the island. It was a dangerous place.

Shi Yufei stroked his beard and paced, saying: "Dongran Lake is strange and unpredictable, hiding many peculiarities. Every year on the fifteenth of the seventh month, the phenomena of ghosts and haunting are even more numerous. You are new here, perhaps you don't know."

Li Xian thought to himself: "I know it all too well. The haunting has even reached my home."

Shi Yufei continued: "The silver spear on Ghost Peak has a very mysterious origin. It is deeply wedged in a rock crevice. It is said to have been left behind by an ancient powerful figure. It is also rumored to have been brought out by ghosts during the fifteenth of the seventh month. It is a rare and unusual spear, but I cannot verify the specific situation. I once went to Ghost Peak myself to inspect the silver spear. Hmm, although its origin is strange and its material is special, it does not possess any divine power, and it is guarded by a giant serpent. So I left it where it was. Bringing it up now, I feel it is just right for you."

"If you go, there may be dangers. But for us martial artists, when is there ever no danger? It can also be considered an opportunity for training, to test your ability to adapt."

Li Xian smiled and said: "Thank you for the reminder, Chief Envoy. If I have the chance, I will definitely go and take a look." Shi Yufei mentioned it casually, smiled, and nodded.

Li Xian watched Shi Yufei leave.

He pondered in his heart: "This peach blossom spear of mine was forged from the peach blossom tree spirit. The spear shaft is solid and quite flexible, but holding it feels light and unsatisfying. Moreover, the spearhead is made of ordinary iron and is not very sharp. If I were to truly encounter a strong enemy, I'm afraid it would not be enough. The Sunken River Sword has excellent quality and possesses the [Water Manipulation] trait, but I use it frequently, and the blade has become slightly dull. Even the best sword, if one only knows how to abuse it and not how to maintain it, will eventually be damaged. If that silver spear is indeed extraordinary, it might really serve as my weapon."

He decided to go and see that mysterious silver spear. If it is suitable, he would try to take it.

That night, Li Xian told Nan Gong Qiu about this matter. Nan Gong Qiu thought of the "Gate-Paying Ghost" and felt a slight chill, deeply worried. But she knew Li Xian was not afraid of ghosts, and his cleverness and caution were even superior to her own. If he wanted to go, he must have some confidence. So she did not stop him, only seriously exhorting him to be extremely careful. If he were to be injured in the slightest, she would be heartbroken. Li Xian nodded in agreement.

The next day.

Li Xian prepared enough water and dry rations. Calculating that the round trip would take a day or half a day, he headed towards the northwest.

After leaving Peach Blossom Town, the fragrance of flowers filled his nostrils. On the Flower Cage Island, where flowers were lush, danger was often hidden. It was the "Flower Formation" arranged by the Flower Cage Sect. Li Xian followed the road, passing by 'Willow Flower Town' and 'Qingyuan Town'. The traces of people grew fewer.

After walking for another half an hour, he arrived at the foot of Ghost Peak.

Looking out, it was truly dangerous. The mountain path was steep and rugged, the trees were twisted. Before even entering the mountain, a Yin energy rushed to his face. There were many fierce beasts inside, and from time to time, the howls of wolves and roars of tigers could be heard. Li Xian made a detour of several li, observing the surrounding mountain terrain.

He smelled a阵阵 "foul odor."

"This foul odor is wolf urine. It seems this Ghost Peak is infested with wolves."

This was a place that concealed danger and gathered Yin energy. Li Xian had been hunting since he was young and was well aware of the dangers and strangeness of mountains. Although he had already shed his mortal shell and possessed considerable skill, he could not afford to be careless. He followed the path into the mountain. After walking for a short while, he felt the temperature drop sharply and the light dim. It was just past early morning, and the sun was bright. The trees here were not particularly tall, yet they oddly blocked out all the sunlight.

After traveling several li deep, he suddenly heard a "rustling" sound from behind. A black wolf suddenly attacked, pouncing at him. Li Xian turned his spear and thrust, piercing its head.

He then顺势 flung it. The wolf’s body flew several zhang and crashed into another lurking black wolf. The two fierce wolves twitched and died on the spot.

Li Xian thought: "The wolves here are more cunning and fierce than those elsewhere." He spat out a white mist. The mist clung to the spear shaft and flowed to the spear tip. The blood and filth were instantly dispersed, and the spear shaft was as bright as new. His gaze swept over, and he saw dozens of black wolves staring intently at this spot.

Suddenly, a wolf howl was heard.

The pack of wolves crawled out from the shadows, staring fixedly at Li Xian, revealing a fierce and murderous aura. These wolves were very robust, with thick limbs and fangs several inches long. Drool dripped from the tips of their fangs.

The leading black wolf had an unusual appearance, as sturdy as a tiger, with three fleshy tumors on its head. Its eyes held a hint of wisdom, making one’s whole body feel cold. Its fangs and claws were sharp, and its aura was extremely thick.

Surrounded and attacked by the pack of wolves, Li Xian was not afraid but angry. He shouted: "A pack of evil beasts! You dare to act ferociously." As he spoke, he activated "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." A "rumble" suddenly sounded, like a bolt of lightning on a clear day, shaking all directions. The several trees around him snapped with a "crack" in unison.

The trees several dozen zhang away had their leaves "rustle" down to the ground. The power of this shout was truly indescribable.

The Tumor-Headed Wolf King had a certain resistance to "Chest Drum Thunder Sound." It howled to the sky, issuing commands to the pack, which had a similar effect to the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" of a食精 (Energy-Eating) martial artist.

But Li Xian’s spine was like a divine mountain. His Chest Drum Thunder Sound was like a thunder from the ninth heaven. Furthermore, he had methods to increase his intimidation, such as "Twin Pupils" and "Divine Ghost Ferocious Robe." Although he did not reveal them, the subtle aura of intimidation was already extremely powerful.

The sound wave spread out, carrying the momentum of a raging wave, the flash of thunder, the might of ten thousand galloping horses, and the pressure of a black army pressing down. How could the pack of wolves, numerous as they were, resist?

The Tumor-Headed Wolf King immediately fled in terror. Of the dozens of ordinary black wolves, the stronger ones soiled themselves, their limbs went weak, and they stumbled and fell as they tried to escape. The weaker ones fell to the ground, twitching, breathing more out than in, and died without another breath.

Li Xian shouted: "Hah!!"

The second shout was like another sudden thunderclap. All the wolves were already dead. Only the Tumor-Headed Wolf King was barely alive. Its fur stood on end, and it dared not flee anymore. It ran back to Li Xian’s feet, exposed its belly, and lay on its back, letting out a "whimpering" bark.

Li Xian took out a dagger. He cut off the three tumors. The wolf king "whimpered" in plea, but Li Xian paid it no mind. These tumors were called "Wolf Crown Flesh," an extremely rare medicinal material.

Li Xian kicked the wolf king away and said: "Get lost." The wolf king, as if granted a great pardon, fled weakly. After such a fright, even if it survived by luck, its life would not be long.

Leaving only a ground full of wolf corpses and the foul smell of urine and feces. Li Xian stepped on the "Seven Star Steps" and proceeded deeper into the mountain. Although there were minor twists and turns along the way, he could easily resolve them.

He soon came to a rock wall.

Looking up, between the rocks, more than ten zhang off the ground, a silver spear was wedged. The spear shaft was entwined with vines and covered in moss. It had been there in the rock crevice for a very long time.

Li Xian’s eyesight was excellent. He could vaguely make out the patterns on the spear shaft and felt a secret liking for it. He thought: "This spear has been wedged in the crevice for a long time, weathered by wind and sun, washed by wind and frost, yet it remains so straight and its patterns are clear. This shows its material is special and it is very sturdy and wear-resistant. Moreover, I see that the surrounding rock walls are full of cracks. Judging by its aura... it must be quite heavy!"

He had heard that the silver spear was guarded by a "Ghost Python," so he did not dare to be careless. He waited at the foot of the mountain to observe. After waiting for about a quarter of an hour, he still did not see any sign of the Ghost Python. He saw that the sky was getting late, and if he waited until night, this place was eerie and would bring more trouble.

So he stepped on the Seven Star Steps and leaped onto a large tree. He gathered "Lightness Momentum" in his body.

[Seven Star Steps]
[Mastery: 7599/10000 Perfect]

Li Xian leaped up, his figure agile and nimble. He stepped on a protruding rock and used it as a springboard. His figure rose several more zhang. The mountain wall here was steep and uneven, with many places to borrow force from.

He soon reached a height of over ten zhang. The wind was blowing fiercely, his clothes fluttering, giving him a feeling of soaring freely in the heavens and the earth. Li Xian grabbed the spear shaft. With a shake of his internal energy, the vines and dead branches all "cracked" and fell away.

Li Xian’s feet were braced against the rock wall, and he stood sideways on it. He exerted force with both arms to pull out the silver spear, causing the rock face to shift and many miscellaneous sounds of rocks colliding. The silver spear "thumped" and was pulled out half an inch.

Li Xian thought: "This spear is wedged very deep. My strength is not weak, but to pull it out completely will truly take some effort." He focused his strength to pull the spear.

Suddenly, a "hissing" sound was heard. The Ghost Python appeared suddenly, from top to bottom, opening its mouth to bite down at him. Li Xian frowned: "When did this Ghost Python appear? I observed for a long time and did not see its trace. Otherwise, I would have killed the giant snake first and then sought to pull the spear steadily."

There was no time to think further. Li Xian hooked the silver spear with his foot and hung his body upside down on the rock wall, avoiding the Ghost Python’s bite. The Ghost Python’s body was huge. After missing its bite, it顺势 rolled down the cliff.

"Crack!" It crashed into several large trees. The Ghost Python let out a hiss. Two tree trunks, after being broken, pierced into its body like spears.

Li Xian secretly said: "Good opportunity!" He immediately used his toes for force, bent his abdomen to grab the spear shaft, and once again braced his feet against the rock wall, seizing the moment to pull the spear. The spear shaft rubbed against the rock crevice, making a harsh hissing sound.

The Ghost Python twisted its snake body. Although its size was huge, it could cling to the rock wall and quickly approach Li Xian. Li Xian remained calm. Standing on the silver spear, he drew his bow and shot arrows. In an instant, he shot seven arrows in a row. All seven arrows hit the Ghost Python’s head, with no error in their landing points.

Unfortunately, the "wooden arrows" were not sharp enough, and the Ghost Python’s scales were thick and heavy. It was difficult to truly harm it. But Li Xian’s force was tremendous. Each arrow that landed immediately shattered into pieces.

At the same time, the Ghost Python’s climbing body was shaken back over three zhang. Seven consecutive arrows knocked the Ghost Python down the cliff again. Li Xian immediately tried to pull the spear.

He snorted coldly, and his hands and feet exerted force together. He saw the rock "rumble" and shatter into pieces, dust flying everywhere. Li Xian had forcefully pulled out the silver spear.

The spear shaft was of a length that suited his body and was very heavy. But it was covered in moss and strange rust... Li Xian felt a bit disappointed, but it was indeed superior to the "Peach Blossom Spear." He thought: "This silver spear is now mine. The Peach Blossom Spear is useless to keep, so I might as well leave it here."

He kicked the Peach Blossom Spear.

The spear shaft shot out fiercely, aiming for the Ghost Python’s vertical pupil. The Ghost Python twisted its snake body, avoiding its vital spot. But it was hit by the Peach Blossom Spear and let out a pained and furious hiss.

After landing, Li Xian quickly fled. He would not fight a protracted battle. But the Ghost Python chased relentlessly, its snake body rolling in pursuit, knocking down trees along the way and plowing a trench. Li Xian suddenly thought: "This mere beast, with only its huge size, why should I fear it? Since it chases me relentlessly, I will use it to test the sharpness of my silver spear!"

He immediately planted his feet firmly and held the silver spear. He turned and charged at the Ghost Python. The moment he thrust the spear, there was an instant of stillness in the wind and clouds, a momentum like a bamboo being split. This move had neither a form nor an angle. It was purely a killing momentum that went straight ahead. The Ghost Python opened its mouth to bite, never retreating, both sides wanting to decide the outcome with a single strike.

Li Xian’s spear energy was fierce. It tore the Ghost Python apart completely, snake blood splattering all over the ground. The silver spear in his hand was stained with all the snake blood, emitting a faint light.

Suddenly, he felt the spear shaft become scalding hot.

The strange rust and moss fell off, revealing the true appearance of the spear shaft. Silver light flowed, sharp and heavy, exceptionally divine and handsome. On the spear shaft, it seemed as if a python beast was swimming, lifelike. In a moment, a ghost python pattern appeared on the spear shaft.

Li Xian held the long spear and stood facing it, which made him look even more mighty and extraordinary, as fierce as a prison, and exceptionally divine and handsome.

It turned out...

The Ghost Python was extremely special. It was neither a physical entity nor an intangible spirit. This spear was originally named "Ghost Python Spear." After it was lost here, its spiritual charm dissipated. The Ghost Python detached from the spear and, through the erosion of wind and sun, gradually evolved into a state that was neither real nor illusory.

This matter was strange to say, but it was not a false talk.

It was very secret.

Although Shi Yufei’s cultivation was not shallow, he had also tried to pull out the "Ghost Python Spear" before. But he did not practice spear techniques. When he inspected the Ghost Python Spear back then, although he was attacked by the Ghost Python, he did not entangle with it and left, so he did not know the mystery of this spear.

Li Xian bathed in the snake blood and felt a resonance with the Ghost Python Spear in his heart, immediately feeling a sense of closeness. He suddenly felt that the spear shaft was forged from a special material. It could be as heavy as a thousand jun, or as soft as a ribbon. It could be wrapped around his arm, hidden by his sleeve, making it convenient to carry.

This Ghost Python Spear was an unexpected joy and was very much to his liking.

On the other side.

Hao Qingshe was driven out by Shi Yufei and boarded a flower boat to leave the Water Altar Island. Her temperament was perverse, and she acted without considering gains or losses, so she had no attachment at all.

After successfully leaving the island, she was certain that Li Xian was already dead. She quickly forgot about this matter. She still had three disciples following her, all women, to whom she had taught her poison techniques for many years.

In her early years, she relied on her poison techniques to roam the world, and there were few experts who could subdue her. Thus, she became even more arrogant. She had long since been listed on the Red List. When things got too big and she was pursued and killed by various sects, she hid in the Water Altar. In recent years, she had been living in the Water Altar, and her poison techniques had made great progress. Now that she had left the Altar, she felt like a fish in the sea, with a feeling of boundless freedom.

She was capricious and her actions were unpredictable, disregarding human life. But she always settled her debts, so she went to find her old enemies and used poison for revenge.

During this period, she had poisoned and killed several martial artists for no reason, causing her reputation to be quite notorious.

But she did not know that every villain has their own nemesis, and danger was already approaching.

On this night, Hao Qingshe was staying at an inn. As she pushed open the door, she heard a childish cry: "Madam, please have some tea."

The voice came from a young girl, about seven or eight years old, with her hair in two buns, her eyes lively and innocent. She was offering tea to a woman in a white dress.

The woman had an indescribable charm. Her makeup was delicate, with a silver hairpin and a step-by-step ornament, and pearls gently clinking.

She took the tea cup with an elegant demeanor. She lightly sipped the tea with her red lips, leaving a faint red stain on the cup.
