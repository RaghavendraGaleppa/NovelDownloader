# Chapter 201: Senior Brother, Why Are You Pointing at Me?

“Masterful Technique for Massage...”

“A massage chair?”

Ying Bing’s slender brows furrowed slightly, her beautiful phoenix eyes narrowing.

Visibly, the light smile on her jade-like face vanished, seamlessly replaced by a frosty, ethereal coldness.

Li Mo: “!”

He felt the heart of this Ice Cube, as solid and flawless as bright jade, ripple ever so slightly.

What in the world had happened?

He hadn’t said anything outrageous.

It was just a massage... Speaking of which, Little Li couldn’t help but recall the *Flickering Flower Finger*.

Ahem. That technique contained certain moves that were indeed embarrassing to think about.

For instance, *Skillful Hand Threading the Needle*, *Orchid Brushing Jade*, *Two Dragons Fighting for the Pearl*...

Just as he reached that thought, her low, murmuring voice reached his ears:

“Right now... it hasn’t severed yet.”

Referring to the second layer of *Phoenix Singing in the Sky*.

Spiritual communication might not allow them to know exactly what the other is thinking—at least not at this stage—only vaguely sensing emotional fluctuations.

But that vague sense was enough.

“.....”

The girl’s gaze seemed to say, *‘I’m listening to your excuses.’*

It gave Li Mo a sudden feeling that *‘It’s back. Everything is back.’*

“It’s just... a masterful technique... Look, *Phoenix Singing in the Sky* is a Dual Cultivation art, doesn’t it also...”

*Bang—*

The wooden door slammed shut.

“I am going to the Sword City to lecture tomorrow. I need to rest.”

“You should turn in early too.”

The Ice Cube’s voice came through the door.

“Alright.”

Little Li sighed helplessly.

He would have to be careful when using the second layer of *Phoenix Singing in the Sky* in the future.

Although he was a gentleman, he was still a male. His mind wandered occasionally, inevitably leading to... impure thoughts....

It was normal. Everyone has various emotions and distracting thoughts. Even the Ice Cube’s heart湖 (heart lake) fluctuates occasionally.

Thinking about it in his head was harmless; if others knew, however, it would be a disaster....

Ahem, he was thinking a bit too deeply!

Li Mo returned to his room; he still had to give Little Princess Jiang a lesson, and afterwards, he needed to rest and gather his energy.

Tracing the Strange Stone was an incredibly mentally exhausting task.

He pushed the door and entered the room.

“Come to think of it, I suddenly feel that the Ice Cube is more normal when she’s cold...”

...

The next day.

Autumn in Yunzhou usually arrives early.

During spring and autumn, it is often misty and rainy, clouds and fog swirling, adding a touch of elegance and mystery to the land.

“No wonder it used to be a gathering place for swordsmen.”

As Li Mo stepped out of the door, he saw Senior Brother Ouyang holding his head, sitting there doubting his life.

The smell of alcohol was overwhelming.

“How much did he drink?”

“Ouyang got his heart broken.”

Shen Yunfei lowered his voice.

“Huh? What happened?”

Li Mo was stunned.

When had Senior Brother Ouyang ever been in a relationship?

Isn’t he an artist? As is well known, artists’ romantic lives are usually not smooth sailing.

Shen Yunfei said, “Yesterday at the Baohuan Tower, a beautiful woman recognized Junior Brother Ouyang, and she greatly admired his paintings. The two talked happily.”

“Isn’t that a good thing?” Li Mo looked at Ouyang.

Shen Yunfei continued:

“The story that followed was quite complicated.”

“The more they talked, the more they felt like kindred spirits. The beautiful woman said Junior Brother Ouyang had exquisite painting skills and was the illustrator of *The Domineering Empress Falls for Me*, so she asked Junior Brother Ouyang to paint a portrait of her.”

“Who knew that in the end, Junior Brother Ouyang would be cut out!”

“Cut out?!”

Little Li’s expression turned serious.

Although Senior Brother Ouyang was a bit greedy for money, had a bit too much yellow material in his head, and his martial arts were a bit weak, he was generally a good person.

Besides, didn’t the person bullying Senior Brother Ouyang know that he was a disciple of the Qingyuan Sect?

“Coincidentally, the one who cut in, Junior Brother Ouyang couldn’t do anything about him.”

Shen Yunfei had a strange expression.

Li Mo waved his hand and said seriously:

“Although our sect elders aren’t here, I, Li Mo, still have some face in Hengyun Sword City!”

Li Mo walked behind Ouyang and patted his shoulder:

“Cheer up, Senior Brother. We can’t lose face. Tell me who it is, just say it boldly.”

Ouyang looked up.

---

Seeing the earnest face before him, the mask of pain became even more painful.

He raised a finger...

“Huh?”

Li Mo realized Senior Brother Ouyang was pointing at him.

Is he not sober yet?

Little Li moved to the left.

Ouyang’s finger moved with him.

Little Li moved to the right.

Ouyang’s finger followed again.

Li Mo: “?”

Why is he locking onto me?

“Junior Brother Li.”

Shen Yunfei sighed, hesitating to speak:

“That woman didn’t just want a portrait; she wanted Junior Brother Ouyang to return to his old trade.”

Return to his old trade?

As is well known, Senior Brother Ouyang’s original profession was...

“The male and female protagonists are Jiang Chen and herself.”

Li Mo: “.......”

So, asking a painter to draw a fanart of the woman he likes and his own rival? This is essentially self-inflicted humiliation....

Just thinking about it hurts. It hurts so much.

A moment of silence.

He comforted, “Artists’ romantic lives are rarely smooth. The more you fail in love, the better your painting becomes.”

“You will definitely become a great painter in the future, famous throughout the world, and go down in history.”

The Eyes of Destiny said so, so it must be true.

Senior Brother Ouyang burst into tears completely.

It was evident he was genuinely heartbroken.

Everyone: “....”

Junior Brother, you really know how to comfort people.

Feeling awkward, yet finding it strange, Li Mo said, “Something’s not right. Senior Brother seems overly heartbroken.”

Shen Yunfei and Xu Zhiqing exchanged a glance. *Are you sure it’s not because of you?*

Just to be safe.

Li Mo activated the Eyes of Destiny and looked over.

Then he raised an eyebrow.

**[Name: Ouyang]**
**[Age: 27]**
**[Bone Structure: Divine Hands of Painting.]**
**[Realm: Four Apertures of Divine Observation.]**
**[Destiny: Blue-Purple]**
**[Evaluation: Has immense talent for painting women. Earned a fortune from *The Domineering Empress Falls for Me*, no longer lacking money. After suffering heartbreak, he reflected deeply and made great progress in the Way of Painting.]**
**[Recent Encounter: Met Yin Mianmian disguised as a fan and was bewitched by her. Currently weeping violently.]**

Yin Mianmian is still in Yunzhou?

She stayed in Yunzhou, and since I didn’t go to Baohuan Tower yesterday, she targeted the relatively close Senior Brother Ouyang...

“Is she coming for me?”

Li Mo’s heart sank slightly.

The strongest aspect of the Holy Maiden of the Fine Rain Pavilion isn’t combat...

And he didn’t know if this was her personal act or related to the Fine Rain Pavilion.

“By the way, Junior Brother, the sect sent a message. Elder Qian and Elder Xue are already on their way.”

“That’s great news.”

Li Mo felt a bit of relief.

The elders were still experienced and reliable. They knew that a tall tree catches the wind, so they came to support them.

The Qingyuan Sect had indeed caused quite a stir this time.

...

Not long after.

Li Mo, along with Ying Bing and Jiang Chulong, left the courtyard and headed towards Hengyun Sword City.

The mist was thick. Although it wasn’t raining, after walking for a while, one’s clothes would get damp.

There were still many pedestrians on the street, but there were far fewer martial artists.

They had all gone to Hengyun Sword City to listen to the lecture.

Their teacher was still on the way.

Every Sword Hero had the right to lecture in the Sword City for seven days.

Jiang Chulong carried a small basket on her back. Under the cloth strips, her little eyes scanned the ground constantly. Whenever she saw discarded bottles, jars, broken kites, or old clothes, she would pick them up before catching up.

Her small figure flickered in and out of the rain and mist.

Ying Bing, on the other hand, seemed to be walking amidst the clouds, her skirt fluttering lightly, carrying an ethereal aura.

They climbed to the mountainside of the Sword City.

The three passed by a solitary pavilion.

There was a figure inside.

“几位，可有意让我算上一卦？” (Friends, would you like me to cast a divination for you?)

A woman’s voice came.
