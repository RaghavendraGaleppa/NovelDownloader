# Chapter 287: Brave and Forging Ahead

Before the mace tip even arrived, the grass and trees within three zhang had all collapsed, and the ground was actually pressed into a bowl-shaped depression by the air pressure.

When the move was retracted, the lingering tremor on the mace body久久不散 (lingered for a long time), like a dragon's roar.

*'The Eight Wastelands Dragonfall Mace Technique you cultivate has been initiated.'*

As the prompt appeared on the attribute panel, Xu Yunfan's sea of consciousness suddenly surged, and countless scenes of cultivation poured out like a torrent.

In his mind, he stood atop a ten-thousand-zhang sheer cliff, holding the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace to迎击 (meet) the heavenly wind. When the heavy mace slashed down, the mountain rocks shattered, and the mace tip引动 (triggered) the collapse of the cloud vortex, like a giant dragon diving down. He practiced like this for a full three years. With a single strike, wind and clouds followed, like mercury pouring onto the ground.

The scene suddenly shifted. In a bloody battlefield, corpses were strewn everywhere. He swung the mace横扫千军 (sweeping away a thousand troops). The mace's momentum was like a meteor falling to the earth, the airwaves掀飞 (blew away) the heavy armor of iron cavalry, and in the cracks of the fractured ground, faint traces of scarlet fire burns appeared.

These memories not only contained the true meaning of the moves but also gradually branded the techniques into his body's instincts.

Since initiating the Eight Wastelands Dragonfall Mace Technique, Xu Yunfan had completely immersed himself in the bitter sea of cultivation.

He no longer set foot in the Langya Library Tower. Apart from paying respects when Bi Yuan finished his secluded cultivation, all other days were spent in seclusion within his courtyard, squeezing every moment of time into fuel for his martial arts progress.

After all, watching the system prompts jump on his vision during cultivation filled him with great motivation, which was also the driving force for him to continue.

In his previous life, he had been very enthusiastic about playing games similar to leveling up by killing monsters. Now that it could be manifested in his body, he was naturally沉迷其中无法自拔 (addicted and unable to stop).

Before dawn, Xu Yunfan was already standing at the spiritual gathering place atop the Qingwei Mountain peak.

He was familiar with the routine, slapping open the玄钢机匣 (mysterious steel mechanism box) to reveal the ginseng baby, picking a ginseng root and putting it into his mouth. Before the ginseng baby could cry out, he immediately pressed it back into the mechanism box.

The medicinal power, bitter and sweet mixed, exploded between his teeth, turning into a hot current that rolled into his flesh and blood. The scalding warmth immediately made his muscles all over his body swell and become full.

Facing the gradually whitening fish belly in the east, he operated the Pure Yang One Qi Technique. His mouth and nose opened and closed like dragon scales. Guided by the unique spiritual energy of the Marrow Cleansing Realm, he纳 (absorbed) the first ray of purple qi from the east that shone upon this place into his flesh and blood.

The purple qi blended with his Pure Yang internal energy, turning into a赤金 (crimson gold) torrent within his body, scouring the bones in the Marrow Cleansing Realm that had not yet been fully通透 (unobstructed).

Occasionally, early-rising disciples of the Dao Sect would see this scene from afar. The person on the mountain peak had his robes billowing, and as he breathed, his mouth and nose spewed out rosy light, like a divine being dining on clouds and drinking dew.

When the noon sun was high in the sky, Xu Yunfan had道宗特供的异兽肉 (special supply of strange beast meat from the Dao Sect) in front of him. It was taken from the heart's essence meat of the "Red-Eyed Savage Bull," which was comparable to the Marrow Cleansing Realm. Even after being roasted, it still oozed scarlet blood droplets.

With the recovery of the world's spiritual energy and the gradual increase of demons under heaven, the flesh and blood of strange beasts had also gradually become tangible and visible resources for martial artists to temper their bodies.

In front of Xu Yunfan was a piece of heart's essence meat taken from the Marrow Cleansing Realm strange beast "Red-Eyed Savage Bull." The muscles were twisted and knotted like iron chains, and the surface shimmered with a dark red blood light. Even after being roasted by intense fire, one could still hear a faint tremor sound from within the meat block, coming from the tendons and veins.

His five fingers were like hooks,扣住 (clutching) the meat block and tearing it猛地 (fiercely). When the muscles and tendons broke, they actually let out a crisp sound like the collision of gold and iron.

If an ordinary martial artist were to bite down recklessly, they would probably have their mouthful of teeth shattered by the meat fibers that were as tough as hundred-refined steel. But Xu Yunfan didn't even frown.

The copper teeth and iron teeth forged between his teeth raised a few sparks when they collided with the meat block. While chewing, a faint dragon-like grinding sound of tendons and bones came from his throat. After the "Muscle and Marrow Transformation Technique" reached minor success, his mouthful of teeth had also been tempered by his strength to be as firm as steel.

With every swallow, the surging blood energy contained in the flesh and blood poured into his flesh and blood like molten rock.

Under Xu Yunfan's skin, knotted and intertwined blue veins would occasionally appear. The blood energy, strength, and Pure Yang internal energy within his body were frantically refining the essence energy of the strange beast's flesh and blood.

When the last trace of meat residue was卷 (rolled) into his mouth by his tongue, he suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a three-chi long scarlet气箭 (qi arrow), shattering the stone lamp in the courtyard, and let out a long belch.

This scarlet qi arrow was the impurities of his flesh and blood being彻底排出 (completely expelled). If it were to remain in the body for a long time, it would greatly affect the purity of his own blood energy, thereby拖累 (dragging down) the speed of his martial arts progress.

The Muscle and Marrow Transformation Technique of the Maitreya Temple could change one's physique and alter one's bone structure, and it had an extremely unique way of剔除 (removing) such驳杂 (mixed and impure) blood energy.

If someone else had witnessed it at this moment, they would have been shocked to find that the fierce beast blood energy, which was enough to burst an ordinary Marrow Cleansing Realm martial artist, was like a stream flowing into the sea within his body, and was swallowed up in an instant.

Accompanying the meal was a bowl of "Blood Trout Marrow Cleansing Soup." The fish meat floating in the soup released a faint spiritual light, stimulating his muscles all over his body to tremble.

After吞服 (swallowing) it, he immediately practiced the "Muscle and Marrow Transformation Technique." The medicinal power steamed along with his fist movements,凝成 (condensing) countless tiny blood-colored vortices under his skin, squeezing the impurities from his bone marrow out of his pores. When they landed, they actually砸出 (smashed)细密坑洼 (fine and dense pits).

When twilight gathered, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the bluestone in his courtyard. The three burners and meridians around his body faintly shimmered with a silver glow.

He formed a sword seal with his hands, guiding the sword energy nurtured within his body with the "Three Burners Sword Nurturing Technique." These martial arts,抠来的 (extracted) from Pei Yan, were extremely extraordinary. Under his guidance, the sword energy was like a living creature游走 (wandering) within the three burner meridians.

Whenever the sword energy passed through his internal organs, there would be刺痛 (stabbing pain) like ten thousand needles stabbing him. Yet he remained expressionless. Instead, he used the Lin Seal to recite the true words,平复 (calming) his state of mind, thereby suppressing the pain, and forcing the sword energy to repeatedly巡皇 (patrol) at the three burner meridians within his internal organs. Each cycle would make the sword energy a bit thicker.

Given time, once the sword energy transforms into sword qi, even if he is not holding a sword in his hand, he would still be able to迸发 (unleash) extremely astonishing sword qi.

At midnight, after finishing the Three Burners Sword Nurturing Technique, Xu Yunfan, without stopping, immediately grasped the Scarlet Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace.

Without needing a light, relying solely on the resonance between his body and the mace body, he could accurately挥出 (strike out) the nine killing moves of the Eight Wastelands Dragonfall Mace Technique in the darkness.

When the ninth move, "Dragonfall," was executed, the ground of the courtyard collapsed with a轰然 (loud rumble). Before the mace tip arrived, the ancient pine ten zhang away was already broken in half at the waist.

After retracting the move, the lingering dragon roar from the mace body久久不散 (lingered for a long time), startling the patrolling Dao boy into thinking a fierce beast had闯山 (invaded the mountain).

Resting for a slight moment, Xu Yunfan glanced at the courtyard that seemed to have been plowed over, and couldn't help but咧了咧嘴 (grin). It seemed that tomorrow he would need to have the disciples in charge of construction from the Dao Sect come and修缮一遍 (repair it).

Back in the room, Xu Yunfan did not lie down to rest. Instead, he sat cross-legged on the cyan jade prayer mat.

He formed the Lin Seal with his hands, his ten fingers扣住天罡 (like grasping the Big Dipper), and a strange radiance faintly flowed between his knuckles. As the days of cultivation passed, the Lin Seal was also gradually revealing its strangeness. He silently recited the "Heart Mantra of the Highest Good is Like Water" in his mind. Every syllable he uttered seemed to stir invisible ripples in the void.

As the Lin Seal operated, his sea of consciousness gradually surged with chaotic mist. This was a barrier formed from distracting thoughts, restless blood energy, and external interference.

Suddenly, a清光 (clear light)劈开 (split open) from the depths of the chaos. Xu Yunfan's true self神 (spirit)踏破 (stepped through) the mist and emerged.

This deity-like虚影 (phantom) wore dragon scale armor, and its face was exactly the same as Xu Yunfan's, yet it appeared even more majestic and dignified.
