# Chapter 41: First Layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body - Jade Skin Realm (Seeking Follow-up Reads)

Gazing at the words floating before his eyes, Qi Chuan, whose body was nearly numb, managed a faint smile.

"As expected, the hundredfold multiplier effect works on body-refining techniques as well!"

At the same time, a faint tingling sensation spread across his skin. As this subtle itch emerged, Qi Chuan could feel something unusual happening to his skin—it was as if it was being strengthened.

Of course, there was also a slight tingling in his flesh, blood vessels, and tissues, though much milder, suggesting that the enhancement there was minimal. The primary focus was on his skin.

With this strengthening, the pain around him, which had been approaching numbness, seemed to lessen slightly.

"It's good as long as I can improve!"

Qi Chuan smiled faintly. He wasn't afraid of pain. If this level of pain could enhance his physical body, it was more than worth it.

"Next, I'll continue cultivating the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body!"

Once again, Qi Chuan began circulating the cultivation method of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body.

[You activate the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body within the medicinal bath, absorbing the medicinal energy to strengthen your body. Triggering a twelvefold multiplier, you gain twelvefold rewards—your body receives a slight enhancement.]

[You activate the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body within the medicinal bath, absorbing the medicinal energy to strengthen your body. Triggering an elevenfold multiplier, you gain elevenfold rewards—your body receives a slight enhancement.]

As this process continued, words persistently appeared before his eyes, and Qi Chuan's body steadily and slowly grew stronger.

Half a day later, Qi Chuan stood up, clenching his fists. He could feel the significantly increased strength. Since this was his first medicinal bath, the effects were particularly noticeable.

Although he hadn't yet reached the first-tier body-refining stage, the improvement compared to before was substantial.

At this rate, advancing to the first-tier body-refining stage was only a matter of time.

"Compared to my mana cultivation, body-refining seems easier for me, with faster progress?"

Sensing the enhanced strength within him, Qi Chuan focused on the skin of his arm, where he could faintly discern an almost imperceptible jade-like glow.

The first layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body was the Jade Skin Realm. Once the jade glow on his skin became fully visible, it would signify his successful entry into the first-tier body-refining stage—specifically, the early first-tier, roughly equivalent to an early Qi Refining cultivator in strength.

At that point, the toughness of his skin would rival that of a low-grade magical artifact.

Yet, the faint jade glow on his arm's skin now made Qi Chuan hesitate slightly.

---

In terms of mana cultivation, his eighth-grade spiritual root imposed certain limitations.

But body-refining had lower requirements. Thus, with the hundredfold multiplier, his progress seemed much faster.

"If that's the case, I might reach the early first-tier body-refining stage—or even the peak first-tier—sooner than I expected." Thinking this, Qi Chuan smiled. This was an unexpected boon.

"However, body-refining also consumes far more resources. It's practically piling up resources!"

Qi Chuan looked at the large vat before him. The originally thick, dark-red medicinal liquid had noticeably lightened.

For this vat of medicinal water, he had used all the spirit herbs and materials he'd exchanged for five sect contribution points. But it seemed it wouldn't last much longer.

This was equivalent to fifty low-grade spirit stones in resources.

Once exhausted, he would have to spend another five contribution points at the Alchemy Pavilion to replenish them. Right now, he only had a little over ten contribution points left.

"I'll just have to take it step by step and improve gradually."

Qi Chuan sighed faintly.

Giving up wasn't an option. To prepare for his future attempt at Foundation Establishment, he had to cultivate the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body.

*Thud. Thud.*

Just as Qi Chuan sighed, an unexpected series of faint knocking sounds came from outside his cave abode.

"What's this…?"

Hearing the noise, Qi Chuan frowned slightly. He stepped out of the vat, conjured a sphere of water with his mana to rinse himself, then evaporated it with mana, leaving himself clean and refreshed.

After dressing, he walked to the entrance of his cave abode.

Not far away, a palm-sized paper crane was flapping its wings, bumping against the formation outside the cave. On its body were written characters.

"Someone's looking for me?"

This sight puzzled Qi Chuan. Clearly, someone was using papercraft to send him a message.

But since entering the inner sect, he hadn't gotten to know many people. Who could be seeking him out?

With a wave of his hand, he opened a gap in the formation, allowing the paper crane to flutter inside and land in his palm.

Unfolding it, Qi Chuan found a letter inside.

"To Junior Brother Qi Chuan: Three days from now will be my birthday. I have prepared a banquet at the inner sect's Treasure Pavilion and have invited fellow disciples who entered the inner sect in the same year. As a proud son of the Qi family, with exceptional talent, if you think well of me, I sincerely hope you will attend…"

"…Ye Liang."

"Ye Liang actually wrote me a letter… inviting me to his birthday party?"

---

"I'm not really close with him, am I?"

Looking at the signature, Qi Chuan was baffled.

According to the letter, Ye Liang wasn't just inviting him—he was inviting all the new disciples who had entered the inner sect through the recruitment that year, including geniuses from cultivation families and rogue cultivators. It was unclear whether he was only inviting those he deemed worthy or everyone.

"Even in cultivation, people still do this sort of thing."

Qi Chuan shook his head slightly, unsure what Ye Liang was thinking.

But there was no way he would go.

He was busy cultivating the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body. Attending would mean preparing a gift, and he wasn't close with Ye Liang. Moreover, who knew what the other party's intentions were?

Immediately, Qi Chuan flipped the paper over, wrote a polite refusal, then refolded it into a crane and infused it with mana. The paper crane flapped its wings and flew back the way it had come.

"Can't be bothered with this."

Watching the crane leave, Qi Chuan closed the formation and turned back into his cave.

As for whether rejecting Ye Liang would provoke him, Qi Chuan wasn't particularly concerned.

Ye Liang might be a talented disciple, but to Qi Chuan with his hundredfold multiplier, he posed no threat.

As for Ye Liang's background as part of the top family under the Moonlit Breeze Sect, Qi Chuan was now an inner sect disciple with limitless potential. He had nothing to fear.

On the other hand, attending the birthday party would waste time, consume resources for a gift, and possibly disrupt his mindset with unknown complications—that would be the greater loss.

Thinking this, Qi Chuan was about to return to his meditation chamber when—

*Thud. Thud.*

The sound of the paper crane knocking against the formation rang out again.

"Again?"

Qi Chuan turned back, exasperated.

Was Ye Liang so worried he wouldn't come that he'd sent a second letter?

But when Qi Chuan reached the entrance, opened the formation, and unfolded the new crane's letter, he realized he was mistaken.

"To Brother Qi Chuan: I, Mu Rong Fan, write to you. The Qi and Mu Rong families have long been on good terms. As representatives of our families in the inner sect, supporting each other here would be a fine tale to bring back home…"

"…Mu Rong Fan."

"So it's someone from the Mu Rong family…"

Qi Chuan pondered slightly. As he read the letter, the image of a plain-looking youth in gray robes surfaced in his mind—Mu Rong Fan, whom he'd seen at the Inner Affairs Hall when he first entered the Moonlit Breeze Sect.

At the time, his first impression of Mu Rong Fan hadn't been particularly strong, but he'd vaguely sensed the boy wasn't a bad sort.

"Besides, the Qi and Mu Rong families do have good relations, with some cooperation between them. Given that, it makes sense he'd reach out…"

Qi Chuan nodded slightly and continued reading.

The letter proposed establishing a connection between them, akin to the cooperation between their families—a degree of mutual trust and collaboration.

In the world of cultivation, such ties were fragile and could dissolve at any moment.

But compared to unfamiliar fellow disciples, this relationship could allow for limited mutual benefit.

"This… might be worth considering."

After some thought, Qi Chuan decided to agree and began writing his reply on the back of the letter.

However, he made it clear that while he was open to this tentative alliance, he wouldn't have time for any activities in the coming months.

After all, his immediate priority was mastering the first layer of the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body and advancing to the first-tier body-refining stage.
