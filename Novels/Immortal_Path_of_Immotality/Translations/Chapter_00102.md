# Chapter 102: Escape to Freedom

The surroundings fell into an eerie silence. The blood-robed young man swallowed hard with difficulty.

Facing the heroic and valiant Thunder Rain Maiden before him, whose bearing rivaled even the most formidable men, he forced a flattering smile at the corner of his mouth.

"What if I said I only trapped you in the Blood Sea earlier without any intention to kill? Would you believe me?"

He cautiously observed the trio opposite him, only to find all three staring at him expressionlessly. His face twisted slightly in distress, and his calves trembled uncontrollably.

Though he was also a true disciple of a major demonic sect, the power of that minor divine ability she had unleashed earlier was still vivid in his mind!

This woman was only at the Foundation Establishment stage, yet she could wield a divine ability typically reserved for Golden Core cultivators. What kind of monster was she?

Immediately, he hurriedly backed down and began listing his affiliations: "I am the disciple of Elder Mang Zhenjun of the Blood River Hall, nephew of Master Ying, grandson of Master Tie, and great-grandson of the Blue Mountain Elder..."

Before he could finish reciting his long list of titles and reveal his true identity, a new group of black-clad figures emerged from the dense forest behind him. A young woman in black robes stepped forward.

"Enough, Brother Wei. No need to keep stalling—I've arrived!"

This black-robed woman looked utterly ordinary, like a common village girl who wouldn’t draw a second glance in a crowd. Yet, judging by her cultivation and leading position, she was clearly another true disciple of a major sect.

She then smiled faintly at Thunder Rain Maiden. "Sister from the Violet Sky Sect, you must be quite drained after using that divine ability, aren’t you? Why force yourself? Your acting can only fool timid fools like Brother Wei here."

The blood-robed man referred to as "Brother Wei" suddenly realized the truth. He had been so terrified by the divine ability's power that he hadn’t noticed—while he was stalling for time, Thunder Rain Maiden had been doing the same.

At this moment, Thunder Rain Maiden's lips twitched slightly, and a voice resonated in the ears of Lin Shan and Lin Fan behind her—clearly a secret sound transmission.

"Both of you, take advantage of the sparse numbers around us and break through now! I'll hold off these two Foundation Establishment true disciples."

Lin Shan and Lin Fan exchanged a glance and immediately understood that the black-robed woman’s words were likely true. Thunder Rain Maiden’s cultivation was indeed not at its peak, and their presence would only burden her. In a chaotic battle, she would have to split her attention and risk being overwhelmed.

It was better for them to leave early, allowing Thunder Rain Maiden to fight freely without restraint.

They had complete confidence in Thunder Rain Maiden’s strength. As long as she didn’t encounter a Golden Core cultivator, even facing two true disciples of major sects at the same level, she could fight or retreat as she pleased—no one could stop her.

It was common knowledge in the cultivation world that wind and lightning cultivators were the fastest.

Without hesitation, Lin Fan summoned the Green Jade Flying Boat artifact. Lin Shan hopped aboard and expertly pulled the lever to engage the gears. With a "whoosh," the brothers sped off, skimming the ground as they fled downhill.

After all, the sky was a battlefield for Foundation Establishment and Golden Core cultivators. It was far safer for two insignificant Qi Condensation juniors like them to escape amidst the ground-level chaos.

The blood-robed youth and the black-robed woman paid them no mind, their auras locked onto Thunder Rain Maiden. As for the two Qi Condensation brats fleeing, they had no interest in pursuit.

Lin Shan piloted the flying boat recklessly, plowing straight through small groves of trees instead of weaving around them—the high-grade artifact’s sturdy material made it more efficient to crash through obstacles.

Their small stature and low profile meant they only encountered scattered Qi Condensation demonic cultivators during their escape. While Lin Shan steered, Lin Fan cleared the path.

Any cultivators blocking their way were either picked off one by one by Lin Fan’s high-grade spear artifact or sent flying, their fates unknown, after being rammed by the flying boat.

Behind them, the distant rumble of thunder gradually faded as they put more distance between themselves and the battle.

The rest of their journey was uneventful—no Foundation Establishment cultivators crossed their path. Whether they had all been drawn away by their peers or Lin Fan’s "luck aura" was at work, the two made it smoothly down the mountain.

They then flew low over the sea, leaving Turtle Taming Island behind. When they looked back, the island was a scene of chaos.

Hundreds of tiny dots clashed in the skies above, while swarms of figures engaged in skirmishes below. It was clear that the forces under Turtle Taming Island’s Master Tortoise were no match for the three demonic sects, being steadily overwhelmed.

Flames soared into the sky as palaces and forests were reduced to ruins. The flashes of spells lit up the island like a raging inferno.

Now safely over the ocean, the two had no reservations. They ascended higher into the sky, their flying boat streaking away like a meteor.

Meanwhile, above the central peak of Turtle Taming Island, over a dozen Golden Core cultivators were locked in fierce combat. Artifacts and spells clashed, churning the spiritual energy in the area and scattering the clouds into tattered wisps.

Behind Master Tortoise loomed the colossal phantom of his Cold Tortoise Dharma Form. Every movement carried the might of heaven and earth, each strike rivaling the power of a minor divine ability.

This was the might of a Nascent Soul cultivator’s Dharma Form—every action was a divine ability!

Though Master Tortoise had not fully stepped into the Nascent Soul realm, the mere projection of his Dharma Form was enough to contend with the Golden Core experts of the three major sects.

Other battle formations were far more grueling. Some Golden Core experts pleaded to be allowed to leave, claiming they wanted no part in the conflict, but the defectors among them only responded with cold sneers.

To them, this was a golden opportunity—with numerical superiority, they could pick off one or two Golden Core cultivators, then snowball their advantage into two-on-one or three-on-one fights.

After all, Golden Core cultivators were wealthy individuals, each with centuries of accumulated resources. Pillaging was the fastest way to riches. Normally, they wouldn’t dare provoke their peers for fear of retaliation, but now that they were all in this together, they could pick off lone wolves one by one.

Where else would they find such a rare chance?

At the heart of the battle, the Golden Core experts of the three demonic sects gradually intensified their assault. Though Master Tortoise had summoned his Dharma Form, the elite guardians of the demonic sects were no pushovers.

After prolonged exertion, Master Tortoise began to falter.

The once-renowned vagrant cultivator, who had dominated the Eastern Sea for centuries, now wore an expression of exhaustion. Watching his life’s work being trampled, his island engulfed in flames and war, despair welled up in his heart.

"Fine! Fine! Fine! You demonic cultivators truly know no bounds—slaughtering the innocent, reveling in chaos. One day, retribution will come for you!"

The Blood River Hall’s middle-aged guardian sneered from the sky. "Countless people have said those very words to me, yet here I stand, alive and well!"

The elderly man from the Hundred Ghost Sect let out a sinister chuckle. "We demonic cultivators follow our hearts and act as we please. Retribution? My fate is mine to command, not heaven’s! Old Tortoise, prepare to meet your end!"

The veiled beauty beside them giggled without a word, though her attacks were the most ruthless of the three.

Just then, a streak of light flew up from the foot of the mountain, stopping near the battle. A Black Lotus Sect Foundation Establishment cultivator transmitted a message to the beauty via divine sense:

"Guardian Yan, some have escaped in all four directions. Should we pursue?"

The black-robed beauty continued her duel with Master Tortoise while her eyes shimmered with a faint light—clearly activating some pupil technique to scan the distance. She swiftly assigned teams to chase down the fleeing figures in each direction.

But when her gaze fell upon a green flying boat in the northeast, and she spotted Lin Shan at the helm, a hint of amusement flickered in her eyes.

She instructed her subordinates not to pursue that direction, murmuring under her veil so softly it was almost inaudible.

"So that’s where this brat ran off to. No wonder I haven’t seen him lately.

How interesting."
