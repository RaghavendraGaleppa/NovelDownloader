# Chapter 4: Pure Yang Pill, Critical Hit Special Rebate!

In the room, Li Mo finished packing his luggage, got up, stretched, and pushed open the window.

The river breeze blew in. Opposite was the Clear Abyss Mountain, shrouded in clouds and mist. The neatly arranged buildings on it were faintly visible, like a silent giant overlooking the city below.

"The scenery up there must be even better," Li Mo muttered to himself.

Having transmigrated, how could he be content to be an ordinary person?

But given his current situation, he probably wouldn't even make it as far as Wang Hu in the entrance ceremony.

Tiger and leopard forms, superior root bone.

Among his peers, Wang Hu could be considered the most talented.

New disciples are divided into inner and outer disciples, and even true disciples, based on talent, with a last-place elimination system.

Obviously, a good starting point means接触到的人天命就越強, and the investment rebate will be higher.

Not to mention, if he were classified as an outer disciple, he wouldn't even be able to see Ying Bing.

"By the way, Dad said there's a familiar physician in the city with excellent medical skills."

Li Mo turned around and said softly, "Why don't we go take a look today?"

At the tea table.

"No need," Ying Bing said, shaking her head as she sipped her hot tea.

Li Mo said helplessly, "Going there once could help alleviate your symptoms."

Ying Bing remained silent, raising her eyes from her teacup. The rising steam couldn't hide the profound light within them.

She looked at Li Mo, as if trying to see through him.

"Dad gave me the money, so I need to report back to him."

"The Three Yang Medical Hall isn't far, just two streets away," Li Mo said, deliberately frowning.

Three Yang Medical Hall?

Ying Bing took a light sip of tea, as if pondering the name.

After lowering her eyes for a moment, she finally nodded.

"Alright."

...

...

Evening.

The city of Ziyang Prefecture was brightly lit. Near the riverbank, there were flower boats and lanterns. On the wide streets, people in fine silk clothes came and went, along with people who were clearly outsiders.

The Clear Abyss Sect opening its mountain to accept disciples once every three years made the city even more bustling than usual.

The most lively place was undoubtedly Golden Ring Street, where things sold included medicinal herbs, weapons, and horses—all items used by martial artists.

Three Yang Medical Hall.

"Please inform the master," Li Mo said, taking out his father's letter from his sleeve.

The medicine boy saw the recipient on the letter and his expression turned serious.

"Please wait a moment, Master. My master went out on a house call. He should be back soon."

"Thank you," Li Mo said.

Li Mo and Ying Bing sat in the hall and waited.

A moment later.

Footsteps came from the hall.

A middle-aged man walked in, looking travel-worn, his linen robe full of patches.

He had thin facial features, a long beard reaching his chest, and especially bright eyes.

"Master!" The medicine boy took out the unopened letter and handed it over.

The middle-aged man read it briefly, and a smile appeared on his face.

"Da Long, that kid. He still remembers this old man."

Ying Bing's eyebrows moved imperceptibly.

Li Mo sensed something was off.

This man looked about the same age as his father, but why did he speak like an old man?

The medicine boy said proudly, "Master is ninety-six this year."

"Ninety-six?"

Li Mo opened his mouth wide.

They say studying medicine makes one age easily, but how could someone become younger the more they study?

Did he practice some kind of skill or learn a health-preserving technique?

This world really can't be judged by common sense.

"It's just a minor skill, nothing to it."

"Your father said the one needing treatment is this young lady. Come here," the middle-aged man in the linen robe beckoned.

As Ying Bing sat opposite him, he flicked a golden thread, wrapping it around her slender, pale white fingers.

Li Mo watched with great interest.

Seeing his worry, the medicine boy said, "Don't worry. Under heaven, there are very few illnesses my master cannot cure."

The middle-aged man in the linen robe twitched the corner of his mouth upon hearing this, clearly quite pleased by the statement.

But.

The next second, he let out a soft "huh" and frowned.

*Hum—*

The golden thread trembled slightly.

A trace of frost appeared, rapidly spreading along the golden thread from Ying Bing's fingertips.

*Snap—*

The middle-aged man in the linen robe, as if electrocuted, deliberately broke the golden thread.

He let out a breath, still feeling a lingering fear.

"So domineering!"

"How is she?" Li Mo took a deep breath and asked.

The middle-aged man's brow furrowed into a deep "川" character.

He pondered deeply for a moment, then shook his head.

"Inconceivable, inconceivable. Logically speaking, you shouldn't have lived until today."

He had practiced medicine for eighty years and had seen all kinds of疑难雜症 (difficult and complicated diseases).

But the extreme Yin cold in a person's body could be this domineering—it was truly unheard of!

"Young lady, you were diagnosed with a 'Jue Mai' (Severed Meridian), right?"

"Mm," Ying Bing nodded.

The middle-aged man pondered for a moment, then slowly spoke again.

"This old man is just guessing, but this might not be a Jue Mai, but a special physique. As for what exactly it is, this old man will have to consult ancient texts."

"If it's not a disease, there's no cure. I can only prescribe some medicine to alleviate the pain."

Ying Bing was surprised for a moment, then returned to calm.

To see through to this level, this man's medical skills could rank among the best in Ziyang Prefecture.

Including herself, she only found the answer later after going to the Central Continent, from a secret land of a secluded sect with a long lineage.

**Tai Yin Moon Phoenix Physique.**

In that ancient text, ten kinds of physique that were unprecedented and dazzling were recorded. The author named them the **Ten Absolute Physiques**.

Including the Tai Yin Moon Phoenix Physique, nine of the Ten Absolute Physiques had disappeared, existing only in legends and conjectures.

The only one that could be specifically verified was the **Society and State True Dragon Physique** of the Great Yu Martial Emperor, capable of suppressing the nation and bearing the fortune of all lands.

"This is the Pure Yang Pill I refined. It should be effective. Two hundred taels of silver," the middle-aged man in the linen robe said, taking out a porcelain bottle.

---

"That's not expensive," Li Mo nodded, preparing to pay.

However, the middle-aged man slowly raised a finger.

"One pill."

Li Mo: "..."

Could you please not pause so dramatically?

The medicine boy wiped his saliva and said repeatedly, "It's already a bargain price. If Master didn't feel he lost face today, he wouldn't..."

"Huh?" The middle-aged man glared at him, and the medicine boy shut up sheepishly.

"Not expensive, not expensive!"

"I'll take a hundred pills, thank you," Li Mo said.

Li Mo, as if performing magic, slapped a stack of silver notes onto the table, along with a few gold ingots.

Medicine Boy: "!"

Middle-aged Man: "?"

Ying Bing raised her slender eyebrows.

The medical hall fell silent enough for a needle to drop.

The thick stack of silver notes, at a glance, was worth over ten thousand taels. The few gold ingots were even more valuable. Gold is precious, and although it circulates less in the market, it has a market price.

If exchanged for silver, it would far exceed the market price!

All together, it was worth at least twenty thousand taels.

Even in the land-scarce, gold-valuable city of Ziyang Prefecture, it would be enough to buy a magnificent mansion.

"I have some private savings," Li Mo said with a shy smile. "Should be enough, right?"

"A hundred pills? Are you buying from me in bulk to eat as meals?"

"Just one bottle, twelve pills," the middle-aged man said, his mouth twitching, pushing the bottle forward.

"Alright then," Li Mo said reluctantly, nodding.

He cupped his fist in a salute and left with Ying Bing.

Watching their figures disappear into the night, the middle-aged man stroked his chin, suspicious.

"Weren't they saying these two kids have a very strained relationship? Why does it seem like he's afraid of not spending enough money?"

He picked up the frost-covered golden thread from the ground, his expression thoughtful.

If it really is a certain physique...

This child's talent is恐怕难以想象 (恐怕难以想象)!

"Master, there's a message from the sect," the medicine boy said, coming back with a hawk, taking the bamboo tube from its beak, and feeding it dried meat.

The letter clearly read:

**[To be opened by Elder Six, Xue Jing.]**

After reading the letter, he smacked his lips and glanced at the back courtyard.

"Let's go back to the sect. Bring the alchemy furnace."

"Yes," the powder-carved, jade-like medicine boy nodded, ran to the back courtyard, and with a "Hey!", exerted his strength.

A dragon-tiger bronze furnace, two people tall, spun and was hoisted onto his small shoulders.

...

...

On the other side.

The bustling night market was about to close. Pedestrians were few, leaving only the still-burning street lamps swaying.

The smoke and fire of the market dissipated, and the starry river above finally began to twinkle.

"What a pity," Li Mo said. "I heard Ziyang Prefecture's night market has many snacks. We should come earlier next time."

Holding two skewers of willow-leaf grilled fish, a specialty of Ziyang Prefecture, he took a bite. It was fresh and fragrant, without any fishy smell, and even the bones were crispy.

"Want to try some?" Li Mo turned around to offer the fish.

Ying Bing looked straight ahead, gazing at the boy with oil stains still at the corners of his mouth, and doubt arose in her heart.

Reborn, she had thought everything would proceed as she expected.

But he seemed to have become an exception.

"Why?" Ying Bing asked for the first time.

Li Mo was in a good mood and grinned.

"Since the hard approach doesn't work, I can only try the soft one."

"What if you're the type who likes to be coaxed, and you're moved and throw yourself into my arms?"

As his words fell, the atmosphere became a bit awkward.

Not getting the satisfactory answer she wanted, Ying Bing's gaze remained calm, clearly treating his earlier joke as if it were wind passing by her ear.

As expected, one couldn't expect an ice cube to have any sense of humor...

"Relax, relax," Li Mo waved his hand. "You suffered a lot from me before. Consider this compensation, or an investment."

"It's just over two thousand taels of silver. Once I enter the Clear Abyss Sect, it'll be pocket change."

Li Mo waved his hand, looking like he was rich and powerful.

Regardless of whether he would be strong or not, it was impossible for him to be poor in the future.

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

Where did he get his confidence?

In her previous life, Li Mo had only barely made it into the outer sect.

His root bone could be said to be completely ordinary.

But the少年 (youth) was still completely unaware of this, seemingly fantasizing about shining brilliantly in a few days...

"Hu—"

The night wind blew past, the lamp shadows swayed, making the youthful spirit and ambition on the boy's face flicker between light and shadow.

Ying Bing was suddenly stunned.

In her sealed memories, a very distant and unfamiliar figure flashed by.

That was her past self, under the gaze of countless onlookers, bowing to a Clear Abyss Sect elder and vowing to open her meridians within six months.

Where did her confidence come from back then?

"This favor, I accept it," her pleasant voice just fell.

**[Investment Successful. Investment: Twelve Three-Stripe Pure Yang Pills.]**

**[Investment Successful. Your words have changed the other party's state of mind.]**

**[This investment has successfully changed the investment target's life trajectory. The reward feedback will be subject to a critical hit.]**

**[Congratulations, Host, you have received a Special Feedback!]**

"Changed her state of mind?" Li Mo was confused. He hadn't said anything particularly special.

As expected of a Heavenly Fate Woman; she could have an epiphany from anything.

Special Feedback... Reward Critical Hit...

This looks like the sign of getting a big drop!

"Eat some grilled fish? It's delicious."

"No."

"Uh, little flying fish is here?"
