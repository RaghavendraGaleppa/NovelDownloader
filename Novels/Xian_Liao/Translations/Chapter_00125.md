# Chapter 125: Breakthrough

A large bump swelled on Fusong's forehead. He casually patted it, making it disappear, then said with lingering fear, "Qingzhi, what kind of water is this? It's so powerful."

"Primordial Heavy Water," Zhou Qing replied after playing a prank on his second senior brother. He briefly explained the properties of Primordial Heavy Water before asking, "Senior Brother, I noticed a hint of springtime joy between your brows. Did you take advantage of collecting monthly dues at the market to flirt with female cultivators?"

Zhang Jingxiu was occupied with comprehending the Giant Spirit Mystic Technique, while Zhou Qing was in seclusion refining the Celestial Origin Divine Water and cultivating Kidney Water Thunder. Thus, market affairs were temporarily handed over to Fusong.

Zhou Qing's disguise as Qinglingzi somewhat resembled Fusong in appearance. After teaching Fusong a simplified version of the Thousand Illusions technique, Fusong, with his ability to control facial muscles and bones at the Melting Furnace stage, could pass as Qinglingzi.

With Fusong and the Great Pine Tree overseeing the market at Desolate Ridge, along with the protective formation and communication talismans, unless a Golden Core Patriarch intervened, they could hold off any attackers long enough to send a distress signal.

Moreover, Fusong now carried several body-refining magical artifacts crafted by Zhou Qing. Knowing that Fusong was clear-headed in major matters, Zhou Qing felt at ease leaving the market in his hands.

Fusong exclaimed, "How could that be? But I do have my eye on Immortal Luo at the market. Rest assured, as long as the Dao Court remains hidden in the Jingyang Dao Domain, I won't bring in any outsiders."

Zhou Qing nodded. "If you're truly interested, I can arrange for Immortal Luo to return to the Mortal Domain with us. However, she wouldn't be able to leave until the Dao Court emerges. After all, life isn't just about pursuing the Great Dao. I've interacted with Immortal Luo many times—she's a cautious woman. Of course, this is only if she's interested in you."

Fusong shook his head. "Qingzhi, let's not discuss this further. I know my limits. Also, I found ancient texts on spiritual plant cultivation at the market. Tianxuan City does grow spiritual grains, but the supply is limited. Our Mortal Domain, however, can cultivate them in large quantities. We just need to select auspicious land, set up spirit-gathering formations, and supply spirit stones. The cultivation methods of the Thick Earth, Black Water, and Divine Wood branches are all useful for growing spiritual grains. I plan to make grain cultivation a mission where they can earn merit points. What do you think?"

Zhou Qing replied, "That's an excellent idea. If we can promote this successfully, with enough spiritual grains, we won't have to worry about supplying elixirs to future disciples."

While spiritual grains were far less effective than elixirs, their advantage lay in quantity. Low-level disciples could have unlimited access to them. Moreover, long-term consumption of spiritual grains would subtly benefit their bodies without the resistance issues associated with elixirs. In fact, Zhou Qing still didn't fully understand the resistance mechanism of elixirs—perhaps it was a natural law of heaven and earth.

Back when Patriarch Jingyang established dozens of human cities and cultivated millions of acres of spiritual fields, he earned the lasting admiration of the Dao Domain's people, who even composed poems in his honor.

Furthermore, if higher-grade spiritual grains could be cultivated, they would greatly benefit Foundation Establishment and Melting Furnace cultivators.

Fusong suggested, "Let's leave this matter to Xiao after we return. He's meticulous and cautious—perfect for handling farming tasks."

Zhou Qing thought to himself, *This senior brother of mine probably wants to burden Fellow Daoist Xiao with tasks to slow his cultivation progress and prevent him from surpassing him.* However, Zhou Qing knew that spiritual field cultivation was a significant undertaking that required oversight from the Dao Court's elders to ensure proper implementation.

He said, "Very well. Fellow Daoist Xiao will take charge, with Zhishan and Zhijing assisting him. As for the distribution of benefits from the spiritual fields, you can discuss and decide among yourselves."

Zhou Qing rarely took initiative in claiming the Dao Court's resources these days. Whatever he needed, he could simply request, without needing to take anything specifically. Even if he symbolically received one spirit stone annually from the Dao Court, it wouldn't hinder his ability to mobilize any personnel or resources at will.

The current priority was to take advantage of the relative peace in the Jingyang Dao Domain to strengthen the Dao Court with its resources. In the cultivation world, only one's own people could be trusted.

Cultivating spiritual grains required continuous refinement to adapt to the Mortal Domain's land—it wasn't something that could be achieved overnight. Fortunately, low-grade spiritual grains matured annually. With the Mortal Domain's existing farming expertise now redirected to study and develop spiritual fields, they could draw parallels and make progress with some resources.

Zhou Qing continued focusing on his Kidney Water Thunder cultivation. He planned to take action during the next beast tide, as it would feature a wide variety of demonic beasts without any Golden Core-level threats. Bringing Zhang Jingxiu and Fusong along, they could form a hunting team to reap substantial benefits while ensuring their safety.

With two Melting Furnace cultivators guarding him closely, Zhou Qing could confidently wield his magical artifacts and divine abilities for large-scale harvesting. Moreover, completing the Kidney Water Thunder cultivation would further refine his Dao Furnace, deepening his mana reserves. Over the years, his spiritual sense had also grown with the help of Lin Wan'er's *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture*.

Everything was progressing steadily toward better outcomes.

"Your Highness, Chief Fusong has relayed instructions from the True Person Zhou regarding the cultivation of spiritual fields. I've been thinking, there's something I'm hesitant to mention..." Xiao Ruowang stammered, somewhat embarrassed.

Yuan Hua replied, "Chief Xiao, please don't address me as 'Your Highness.' I am now a law-abiding citizen under the Dao Court's governance, temporarily handling the mundane affairs of the Sharp Gold branch on behalf of my daughter, barely qualified to converse with immortal masters. Please don't stand on ceremony with me. Whatever you need to say, speak freely."

Although Yuan Hua wielded authority over the Sharp Gold branch as his daughter Yuan Mingyue's proxy, he remained courteous to all cultivators. Even though Xiao Ruowang was a junior with decades of familial ties, Yuan Hua never put on airs. He understood the distinction between immortals and mortals. Moreover, the Qinghe Prince's Manor had joined Zhou Qing's faction relatively late.

Unlike Zhang Jingxiu and his disciples from Mount Taihe, who contributed resources upon joining, the Qinghe Prince's Manor carried the stigma of the Great Zhou Founding Emperor's misdeeds, necessitating extra caution.

The Dao Court's absolute core was, of course, Zhou Qing. Chiefs Fusong and Fushan formed the secondary core, while Zhang Jingxiu, as the strongest combatant after Zhou Qing, held equal status. Xiao Ruowang ranked slightly below them.

Next came the core members from the Jiangzhou Lin family and Hu Village, followed by factions affiliated with Prefect Feng Zhiyuan and Jiangzhou Garrison Commander Jiang Dahu. Feng Zhiyuan held some influence in the Demon-Slaying Division but primarily governed mortals, while Jiang Dahu managed mortal military affairs.

Notably, Feng Zhiyuan had once sworn brotherhood with Zhou Qing. Additionally, Feng Zhiyuan was close to Feng Xiu, the current chief inner disciple of the Dao Court. If the Feng family produced talented cultivators in the future, they would undoubtedly receive substantial support.

Following Zhou Qing truly exemplified the saying, "When a man attains the Dao, even his pets ascend to heaven." Legend had it that the chicken that once accompanied Zhou Qing was now living a life of leisure in the immortal realm.

Thus, Yuan Hua cherished his daughter's status as Zhou Qing's sole disciple. This mentorship had secured a new future for the Yuan family. Moreover, under Chief Fushan's medicinal care, Yuan Hua had fathered a young son. Even the elderly Lin family patriarch, in his seventies, had recently sired a young heir with Fushan's treatments and elixirs, ensuring the Lin lineage's continuation.

Yuan Hua's only concern was that his status as a former imperial clansman, coupled with his ancestor's misdeeds, might disadvantage his daughter. Fortunately, Zhou Qing was magnanimous, holding no grudges. By appointing Yuan Mingyue as acting chief of the Sharp Gold branch, he placed the Qinghe Yuan family on the fringes of the Dao Court's core.

As long as the Dao Court existed, even if the family faced ups and downs, future generations would have opportunities to cultivate. Yuan Hua had foresight—while the Dao Court currently recruited talent indiscriminately, admission would inevitably become more competitive over time. However, as long as the family maintained its reputation, descendants could still gain direct entry.

Seeing Yuan Hua's excessive caution, Xiao Ruowang found it both amusing and frustrating. Though he was kind-hearted, he felt guilty for what he was about to propose. Yet, for the Dao Court's development, he had to speak up.

Having heard from his master and Zhou Qing about the harsh conditions for humans in the immortal realm and the Mortal Domain's role as humanity's hope, Xiao Ruowang felt a sense of mission and responsibility to manage affairs diligently. He deeply revered Zhou Qing, whose intervention had ended the chaotic era early, allowing people to survive.

When the Northern Anping Dao once coerced millions of refugees, Zhou Qing single-handedly pacified them, disbanding the movement and restoring peace. Though winters now lasted five to six months—even eight to nine months in some northern regions—beasts in the seas and mountains grew rapidly, and resources flourished. Mortal crops also yielded several times more than before, as spiritual energy gradually infused the land.

Most malevolent spirits and demonic beasts were detected early by the Dao Court's Demon-Slaying Division, preventing widespread harm while training disciples. Additionally, the Dao Court was considering annual competitions to assess disciples.

In the long run, however, the urgent need was to cultivate spiritual fields for grain to supply disciples. With a sigh, Xiao Ruowang addressed Yuan Hua: "The Great Zhou imperial mausoleum sits on the world's most auspicious feng shui site. As spiritual energy revives, the mausoleum's energy has grown abundant, infused with dragon vein qi and connected to underground fire veins, keeping the land unfrozen even in snow. I propose repurposing the mausoleum to cultivate spiritual grains experimentally."

Since the Great Zhou Founding Emperor's incident, only the Yuan family and a few distant branches remained of the former imperial clan. Thus, nominally, the Great Zhou mausoleum and imperial city still belonged to the Yuans—though Yuan Hua dared not reclaim them.

But repurposing the imperial mausoleum and disturbing ancestral graves required Yuan Hua's consent.

Yuan Hua breathed a sigh of relief. "Chief Xiao, you know my principles. For the Dao Court's cause, sacrificing personal interests is trivial. My ancestor's deeds still shame me. Besides, my ancestor isn't even buried there. Please proceed with leveling it. Since the True Person Zhou and Chief Fusong have approved spiritual field cultivation, we must act swiftly."

From this moment, anyone obstructing the mausoleum's demolition would earn Yuan Hua's enmity. His ancestor had nearly doomed the Qinghe Yuan family—leveling his old grave would atone for his sins. As for the remains of Great Zhou's Taizong, Yuan Hua wished he could scatter the old scoundrel's bones himself. From Taizong onward, the Qinghe Prince's lineage had suffered persecution for over a century.

The more he thought about it, the angrier he grew!

With Yuan Hua's approval, Xiao Ruowang felt relieved. After all, Yuan Mingyue was Zhou Qing's only disciple, acting chief of the Sharp Gold branch, and the Dao Court's阵法大师. Her assistance was essential for spiritual field cultivation.

With Yuan Hua's assurance, Xiao Ruowang could proceed boldly. He mobilized numerous disciples, allocated magical tools, and obtained formation disks from Yuan Mingyue. With these resources, leveling the imperial mausoleum would be effortless.

The excavation also yielded vast amounts of gold, silver, treasures, and rare ancient texts. While Xiao Ruowang lacked expertise in ancient texts, he handed them to the Ancient Classics Academy for study.

In fact, the academy's great scholars had long proposed excavating the imperial mausoleum. Obsessed with studying ancient texts, they had forgotten all about imperial rites—this was also their way of pledging loyalty to the Dao Court.

Confucian scholars knew how to adapt with the times. Their teachings had always borrowed from other schools. Some revered ancient texts merely to assert authority. Yet despite the academy's many great scholars, the young Tang Jieyuan remained its undisputed dean, admired for his brilliance.

Xiao Ruowang even believed that though Tang Jieyuan began cultivation late, his future achievements would be remarkable.

"Chief Xiao, you're proposing to fully connect this section of the imperial mausoleum with the underground fire veins, then excavate a subterranean river to irrigate the spiritual fields?" Yuan Mingyue examined the construction blueprint Xiao Ruowang presented.

"Exactly. But to achieve this, we need your support in formations."

Yuan Mingyue felt no attachment to her ancestral graves—her ancestors weren't buried there anyway. After reviewing the blueprint and surveying the terrain, she made several adjustments.

"Chief Xiao, take a look at my revisions."

Xiao Ruowang examined them and found that Yuan Mingyue's changes minimized terrain alterations while naturally harnessing feng shui. Delighted, he said, "I wasted so much effort—I should have consulted you earlier."

Yuan Mingyue smiled. "Chief Xiao, don't flatter me. I still have much to learn. Fortunately, the formation inheritance my master gave me applies here. Once you're ready, we can begin work."

She added, "However, the formation flags must be crafted by my master. You can start construction first—the formations can be set up later."

"Understood."

Clad in a robe Zhou Qing had given her, Yuan Mingyue passed through the teleportation formation to seek an audience at the Water Manor.

Hearing her request, Zhou Qing smiled. "Tell your father that as my only disciple, you needn't be so cautious. The imperial mausoleum is, after all, your family's ancestral property. The Dao Court should compensate accordingly."

Yuan Mingyue replied, "My family has already received so much from you, Master. Please don't grant us further favors."

She considered her ability to cultivate and study formations a blessing. Cultivators should cherish their fortune, not seek excessive gains.

Zhou Qing said, "In that case, since Wan'er's younger uncle is about the same age as your brother, I'll personally create two customized cultivation methods for them. But given their privileged status, if they err and you fail to discipline them, I won't be lenient."

"Master, rest assured—I'll oversee them closely," Yuan Mingyue promised.

Zhou Qing continued, "Mingyue, you're a good child. Today, having achieved some success in cultivation, I'll share my insights. We cultivators wield thunderous methods to overcome obstacles, but we must never belittle others or harbor narrow minds. Cause and effect are clear, and grievances must be settled, but bullying the weak is always wrong. Amidst cultivation's countless tribulations, who can guarantee they'll never be insignificant again?"

"Your disciple will remember."

Zhou Qing added, "These words aren't just for you—they're also reminders to myself. I haven't been flawless; arrogance has surfaced at times. But cultivation requires constant self-reflection. If I ever grow arrogant, you must remind me. If I can guide you today, perhaps you'll guide me tomorrow."

Yuan Mingyue protested, "How could that be? Master will surely attain immortality and live as long as heaven."

Zhou Qing laughed freely. "That would be ideal, but self-awareness is precious—arrogance serves no one. That's why I rarely involve myself in mundane affairs. If I participated in the Dao Court's daily operations, I'd only hear flattery. Occasional praise is fine, but over time, I might start believing it."

Yuan Mingyue felt deeply moved, glimpsing another side of her master.

"I'll remember your teachings, Master. If you ever grow arrogant, I'll remind you."

Zhou Qing teased, "Aren't you afraid I'll resent you?"

Yuan Mingyue answered firmly, "If Master remains dedicated to the Dao, you won't resent me. If you change your mind, I'd rather bear your resentment."

Zhou Qing smiled. "Even an immortal path can be lonely. I hope we master and disciple can forge ahead together. Don't neglect your cultivation—without a long life, how can you unravel the endless mysteries of formations?"

"Your disciple understands." Yuan Mingyue had an epiphany—her master was reminding her not to obsess over formations at the expense of cultivation, as the two should complement each other.

Zhou Qing then crafted the formation flags and handed them to Yuan Mingyue.

Two years passed unnoticed. Zhou Qing had long since fully refined the Celestial Origin Divine Water from the Divine Water Palace and, through over a year of effort, mastered Kidney Water Thunder.

Focusing on his Health Master interface, he noted:

**Kidney Water Thunder (Proficient).**

His mana had completely liquefied, surging with twice its previous potency.

Another cultivation hurdle overcome!
