# Chapter 720: The Time for Contribution Has Arrived

The silent smile was more oppressive than any words.

The atmosphere in the hall momentarily stagnated.

Xu Yunfan met Pu Du Zhenjun’s gaze, which seemed capable of seeing through a person’s heart, and his thoughts raced.

He understood that before an old demon like Pu Du Zhenjun, any further辩解 (defense) would appear pale and powerless.

The other party did not need evidence, only believing in their own judgment and deductions.

Moreover, when Xu Yunfan had established his Dao in the East Wasteland, it was truly earth-shattering. Pu Du Zhenjun had even stepped in to block the Great Bodhisattva of the Bodhi Pure Land for him—Xu Yunfan naturally remembered this.

The debt regarding Qingyuan’s death was clearly being placed on Xu Yunfan’s head by Pu Du Zhenjun.

Now, using this as a pretext, the other party demanded he take responsibility. In reality, this was to force him to take over some of Qingyuan Zhenjun’s remaining sphere of influence or troublesome matters, binding them more deeply with his newly established Divine Thunder lineage. This would make him a true core pillar of the Primordial Origin Sect, rather than just a newly promoted Zhenjun.

The grander the lineage, the more outstanding the disciples, and the stronger the fortune, the deeper the foundation of Xu Yunfan, the master of the lineage. This was a tangible benefit.

However, correspondingly, the degree of responsibility and entanglement in the sect’s internal vortex also deepened.

Pu Du Zhenjun was laying out a layout for the future of the Primordial Origin Sect and balancing internal forces.

After all, including Xu Yunfan, the Primordial Origin Sect currently only had three Golden Core Zhenjun.

Weighing the pros and cons, Xu Yunfan knew he had few choices.

The agitated color on his face gradually faded, replaced by a hint of contemplation. He stopped acting. After a moment, as if he had figured something out, he cupped his fists and said seriously, "Senior Brother is right. I spoke recklessly just now. Senior Brother Qingyuan's death is indeed regrettable."

"Senior Brother's words are surely considering the overall situation of the sect. Since this matter is beneficial to the sect's inheritance and development, and will strengthen the foundation of our Primordial Origin Sect, as a member of the Primordial Origin Sect, I have an unshirkable responsibility!"

"Accepting disciples and passing on the Dao, continuing the lineage—I, Xu Yunfan, accept this matter!"

He had to give something in return.

Seeing Xu Yunfan finally agree, the smile on Pu Du Zhenjun’s face became a bit more genuine. He nodded: "Good. Senior Brother is deeply principled, which is a blessing to the sect."

He said no more, stood up, and said: "Take this matter to heart. When selecting disciples, value quality over quantity. If you encounter any difficulties, you may come to find me at Chenghua Mountain."

With that, the Dao rhythm around him flowed, and his figure dissipated on the spot like a bubble, as if he had never appeared.

After seeing off Pu Du Zhenjun, Xu Yunfan stood alone in the magnificent and solemn hall of the Divine Thunder Palace, his brows slightly furrowed.

This old monster definitely wouldn't act without a purpose.

His Divine Sense swept over the vast Divine Thunder Mountain below.

Among the rolling mountains, purple-gold thunder light flickered, pavilions were dotted about, and disciples' cave dwellings were arranged in rows.

In the scripture pavilion, the sound of the Dao was clear and resonant; on the training grounds, thunder techniques rumbled; in the alchemy workshops and pill-refining rooms, the furnace fires never ceased.

It was a scene of vitality.

His subordinates did indeed have quite a few disciples now, numbering in the thousands. All practiced the Divine Thunder technique and were blessed by his Zhenjun fortune, allowing their cultivation speed to be much faster than outside.

But just as Pu Du Zhenjun said, and as Xu Yunfan himself saw, among these disciples, there wasn't a single one who could be called outstanding or eye-catching.

Even his old master, like Bi Yuan, who had led him into the Dao Sect back in the day, now relying on the abundant spiritual energy of Divine Thunder Mountain and the feedback from his Zhenjun fortune, had barely managed to verify the Dao Foundation. His foundation and potential were limited, and without a great opportunity, reaching the Golden Core was hopeless.

Perhaps after five cycles of reincarnation, he would be lost among the crowd.

Xu Yunfan had no solution for this.

The others, like Xuezhen, Qingming, Old Man Mud, and the Old Taoist in Hemp Clothing, were early followers. Their performance was acceptable, but they were merely picking the best from a mediocre bunch. They were still far from being able to truly inherit his mantle and stand alone in the future structure of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Was Pu Du Zhenjun trying to increase the Primordial Origin Sect's foundation?

Xu Yunfan sneered at this. The Primordial Origin Sect had the Dao Lord behind it. Even if the sect were truly about to be destroyed, the Dao Lord wouldn't just sit and watch.

Could it be that he is plotting the position of a Great Zhenjun in the late Golden Core stage?

Xu Yunfan frowned slightly. In the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, not to mention the small and medium-sized sects in the various states, just among the three major forces—the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, the Bodhi Pure Land, and the Primordial Origin Sect—the top combat power is at the mid-Golden Core stage.

As for the late Golden Core stage, there isn't a single one. It's unknown why, and even the ancient texts don't record it.

It's probably because his own foundation is too shallow, and he isn't clear about many things.

"A grand lineage increases the foundation, but if there is no successor, it is ultimately a castle in the air..."

Xu Yunfan mused to himself.

Pu Du Zhenjun was right. Some truly good seedlings, in the harsh environment of the Primordial Origin Sect, might be extinguished in battles or dangerous situations before they even have a chance to shine.

If they can be discovered early, brought under his tutelage, and given some protection and guidance, they might truly be able to cultivate a few usable talents. These could not only strengthen the foundation of the lineage and share the sect's affairs but might also become assistance in the future.

However, Xu Yunfan wasn't particularly concerned about this. Pu Du Zhenjun had a deeper meaning behind this matter.

With Pu Du Zhenjun's requirement, Xu Yunfan had to agree.

"It seems I really do need to personally go and pick a few disciples."

Xu Yunfan made a decision in his heart.

His gaze fell below Divine Thunder Mountain. The Primordial Origin Sect was the overlord of the Northern Continent, a vast territory with countless mortal kingdoms.

When selecting disciples, one naturally couldn't just look within one's own Divine Thunder Mountain. One had to go to the vast world where outer disciples struggle to survive and inner disciples compete fiercely. One had to go to the edges of dangerous grounds and secret realms to see those rough stones who struggle on the brink of life and death yet still shine with potential.

However, this matter isn't urgent for the moment.

The top priority is still the arrangements in the Samsara Sea of Bitterness.

After confirming that Pu Du Zhenjun had left, he activated the great formation again and sank his mind into the connection of the Attribute Panel.

At the edge of the Sea of Bitterness, Han Shi was still immersed in the Yin Mist. Under Xu Yunfan's guidance, he executed the commands meticulously.

New formation flags and more complex formation plate hubs were continuously inserted into the wider spatial nodes on the periphery of the White Bone Island.

Some sank beneath the surging blood waves, connecting to the earth's Yin energy; some were embedded in giant skeletons, drawing upon the resentment of the wandering souls; others hung within the grayish mist, gathering the dead energy.

The power of the "Nine Nether Profane Evil Extermination Thunder Formation" was being reinforced layer by layer. The outer "Myriad Calamity Yin Evil Extermination Sword Formation," which drew upon the boundless killing karma and turbid evil of the Sea of Bitterness, also became increasingly solid. The fierce aura was held back, ready to be unleashed.

Han Shi's facial muscles twitched slightly every time he inserted a formation flag into a dangerous location.

The fear in his heart had not disappeared; rather, it deepened as the formation became more complete.

Watching those formation artifacts radiating an aura of destruction being personally arranged by him, he seemed to see his own possible future.

Once the formation was activated, he would surely be trapped within, his body shattered, his soul extinguished.

Those fleeting thoughts of resistance or escape that had just been forcibly suppressed seemed even more ridiculous and powerless amidst this process of laying the formation.

He could only suppress all his thoughts again and continue executing Xu Yunfan's every instruction as if resigned to his fate.

On Xu Yunfan's vision, the Attribute Panel clearly fed back the complex and suppressed emotional fluctuations within Han Shi's soul link.
