# Chapter 173: The Madam's Miscalculation, Seeking Help from Li Xian

Lin Aoshan was true to her word. On that very day, she reported the Flower Cage bandits and the villains on the Red List to the Patrol Sky Division. Government funding was a complex process, riddled with common practices of embezzlement and exploitation.

Lin Aoshan credited the achievement to herself. The reward money was secondary; the merit was what mattered. She was in high spirits, having resolved a knot in her heart. Since taking the title of "Marquis of the Mysterious," she had yet to make a single contribution, running around in vain. It felt meaningless. With merit under her name, she could stand tall.

She also took out three thousand four hundred taels from the Lin family's funds and handed it to Li Xian with great generosity. The matter was considered settled.

Li Xian took out one hundred taels to reward the brothers. The remaining three thousand were packed into chests and would be transported back to the One Union Manor soon.

After dealing with these miscellaneous matters, Li Xian went to the inner courtyard of the Weweitang Hall. He dismissed everyone and began to sort through his spoils: an identity token and a low-grade martial art.

"The identity token might be useful in the future. I'll keep it hidden. As for the martial art, the Gang Thunder Finger... its quality seems extremely high, its completion far surpassing that of the Azure Blue Palm."

"Even among low-grade martial arts, there are differences. This one... is perfectly suited for me. I already have the Azure Blue Palm and the Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword. The Azure Blue Palm was created on the spot, and the Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword is incomplete and a paired sword technique."

"This Gang Thunder Finger is the most complete martial art I currently possess!"

Li Xian reviewed the manual. The Gang Thunder Finger was of such high quality that only a食精 (Food Essence) expert could practice it. This martial art wasn't for fighting; it was a killing move from the start. It consisted of four stances: Shocking Thunder Finger, Resounding Thunder Finger, Startling Thunder Finger, and Gang Thunder Finger.

The manual stated that if one reached the pinnacle, in a thunderstorm, with the chest drumming like thunder, and the martial art pushed to its limit, one could call down lightning from the heavens. It was incredibly mystical.

Practicing this martial art, the killing stances were only one aspect. It could also strengthen the body and fortify the spirit, as it required medicinal baths and a type of strange ore called "Thunderclap Stone."

This ore was produced in "Jade City" and was quite rare. But with money, it wasn't hard to acquire. Thunderclap Stones were struck by heavenly lightning, infused with thunder power. By borrowing the power of the strange ore, one could use electricity to temper the body, thus strengthening it.

Furthermore... the first killing move, "Shocking Thunder Finger," held great mystery. A食精 martial artist could make their chest drum like thunder, boosting their momentum. The key to the Shocking Thunder Finger was its great connection to the "chest drumming thunder sound."

It was a clever use of the chest drumming thunder sound. The sound was held back and not released. The shock was transmitted to the finger, hence the name "Shocking Thunder Finger."

Li Xian read through it all and nodded secretly. He began to practice diligently, once, twice... sizzling without pause.

He extended a finger, his chest drummed with a thunderous sound that rolled. It startled the people outside the hall so much their legs went weak. Li Xian felt this martial art wasn't suitable for practice in a bustling market. He rushed to the deep mountains to temper his finger technique.

When Li Xian extended his finger, the sound was rolling and the thunder was booming. It seemed domineering, but he hadn't grasped the essence. The key to the "Shocking Thunder Finger" was silence.

The rolling thunder was a sign of the chest drumming thunder sound's energy overflowing. If the energy wasn't utilized, it would naturally produce a thunderous sound. When fighting an opponent, if you used this finger technique and the sound was startling, anyone who knew their stuff would realize you hadn't mastered it.

"Practicing this martial art is quite exhausting."

Li Xian practiced for two hours straight. Though he made some progress, the results were minimal. It was getting late, and the area was eerily quiet, with even fewer mosquitoes and insects.

On closer inspection, snakes, frogs, mosquitoes, and other insects had all been scared to death by the chest drumming thunder sound.

"Fine, I'll come back tomorrow."

The next day.

Li Xian entered the forest again, fully prepared this time with enough dry rations and water, intending to practice all day. He was diligent, and heaven rewards the industrious.

Around noon.

Li Xian extended his finger again, simultaneously drumming his chest and striking a nearby tree trunk. The chest sound was softer, but the finger force suddenly increased. His finger vibrated, and the moment it touched the tree trunk, there was a "bang." The tree trunk shook violently, and a shower of fruits fell to the ground.

\[You have mastered the Gang Thunder Finger to the入门 (Initial Stage).\]

\[Gang Thunder Finger\]

\[Proficiency: 14/600 Initial Stage\]

Proficiency +1

Li Xian practiced tirelessly. With each chest drum, the sound grew softer. The shock and thunder were all stored at his fingertips.

That evening.

Li Xian was delighted with his martial art progress. On his way back to the city, he bought a few crispy ducks. Wrapped in oil paper, they smelled fantastic.

He and Luo Xia enjoyed them in the hall.

Luo Xia drank heavily and asked, "Why don't you quickly send that three thousand taels back to the manor to please your Madam?"

Lin Aoshan had already returned to the prefectural city, taking the heads of the Flower Cage bandits and the Red List villains with her. Luo Xia and Li Xian sat opposite each other, having become like brothers, drinking and eating meat together.

Luo Xia didn't know the secrets of the One Union Manor and asked casually.

The speaker meant no harm, but the listener did. Li Xian thought, "The Madam is extremely deep-thinking and has many hidden moves. On the surface, I am already the strongest under the Madam, the strongest in the manor. But behind the scenes, I'm afraid that's not the case. When I killed Xu Liefeng, I felt a gaze. If it were the Madam spying on me, I wouldn't have sensed it. It must have been someone else under the Madam."

"Who is this person? If what Qiuyue said is true, the Madam is currently trapped by her own schemes and can't move. She will definitely want to find someone to help her out of her predicament."

"She will either assign the hidden person to help her, or... have the hidden person find me and ask me to return to the manor to help her out."

"In that case, I'll find a reason to stay in Qingning County for a few days. Whoever comes to find me from the manor is the Madam's trusted aide, a hidden expert."

The thought flashed through his mind. Li Xian said, "Three thousand taels is just the minimum. The next couple of days, I'll try to collect as much rent from the shops as possible and gather more before handing it over to the Madam all at once."

"Let's drink." Luo Xia was still bitter about her previous loss in the drinking contest. She had no interest in the manor's affairs. After just a couple of sentences, she started clamoring for another contest.

Li Xian smiled, raised his cup, and drank freely, once again defeating Luo Xia soundly.

Late at night. Luo Xia was dead drunk, sleeping right there in the courtyard. Li Xian knew she was valiant and fierce, so he ignored her and began practicing the Bronze Body Art and the Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword.

Proficiency accumulated.
He seized every opportunity to increase his strength.

His Qi Lake had reached twenty-one zhang in depth.

\[Your martial way has advanced, your digestion speed has increased,食精 (Food Essence) proficiency +1\]

"Once my Iron Bronze Body reaches the pinnacle, my Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword reaches the second level's minor completion, and my Gang Thunder Finger is proficient... my Qi Lake can grow again. The thirty-five zhang Qi Lake body isn't far off!"

"I've heard that the prodigies of the prefectural city, since childhood, enjoyed heavenly treasures and earthly gems, and received guidance from elders, practicing high-grade martial arts. At my age, their Qi Lake is only around twenty zhang."

"Right, Aoshan mentioned that recently in the prefectural city, they seem to be holding some kind of prodigy banquet, which sounds quite lively. It's a pity that such a grand event is beyond my reach. To me, the prefectural city is a mountain of knives and a sea of fire."

The next day.

"Li Xian."

At the entrance of the Weweitang Hall, Uncle Xiang, dressed in plain clothes, saw Li Xian coming out and waved to him.

"Uncle Xiang?" Li Xian was surprised, then walked over with a smile.

Uncle Xiang patted Li Xian's shoulder and said, "Good lad, not bad. Dressed so smartly, you really have the air of an official."

"Uncle Xiang, you flatter me. It's all thanks to the Madam." Li Xian pulled Uncle Xiang into the hall and asked, "Uncle Xiang, what brings you here? Are you looking for me?"

"Why would I be looking for you?" Uncle Xiang laughed. "I'm the manor's accountant. Every month, I need to come to the city to check the prices of people's livelihood goods and顺便 buy some things. Otherwise, I'd be easily cheated, wouldn't I?"

"Speaking of which, it's strange."

"When I used to come to the city, that girl Qiuyue would always clamor to come along. I was afraid she'd spend the Madam's money recklessly, so I never took her. But this time I came to the city, she didn't come to bother me. Have you seen her recently?"

He glanced at Li Xian nonchalantly.

Li Xian smiled and said, "Uncle Xiang, to be honest, Qiuyue and I don't get along. Where she goes is none of my business."

"I see..." Uncle Xiang nodded. "But, Xiao Xian, even though you're making a name for yourself outside, you can't afford to neglect your duties. You need to remember, you are still the Great Commander of the One Union Manor."

"Yes, yes, Uncle Xiang is right to remind me." Li Xian said with a smile.

"Ah." Uncle Xiang shook his head. "Why would I lecture you? I'm just reminding you. Besides, I'm just an old accountant, how could I dare lecture a Weweilang like you? Am I right?"

"Actually, I've been wanting to return to the manor for a while," Li Xian said. "It's just that the Madam fined me three thousand taels. I've been outside, trying every way I can to get the money. I planned to gather it all before returning."

"Oh?" Uncle Xiang said, "You're quite capable. Three thousand taels is no small sum. Impressive, impressive."

Uncle Xiang waved his hand and said, "Alright then, you go about your business." He walked out of the Weweitang Hall, turned a corner, and disappeared.

Li Xian watched him go. "Just as I suspected, this Uncle Xiang is the Madam's hidden hand. His strength must be formidable. If the Madam is truly trapped by her own schemes and can't get out, she would find it troublesome to have an old man like Uncle Xiang act, so she sent him to ask me to return to the manor to help her out of her predicament."

"If the Madam is pushed into a corner, Uncle Xiang could also help her break free. By then, I'd be in deep trouble."

"Come to think of it... the famous 'Madam of the Broken Sword,' with her deep schemes, formidable strength, and ruthless methods. Many powerful figures in the江湖 (Jianghu) trembled at the sound of her name, feared her like a tiger, and suffered losses at her hands. But in the end, she was outwitted by Qiuyue."

"Who would have thought the Madam had such a weakness? Her current situation must be quite awkward."

Li Xian suddenly found it amusing. But since Uncle Xiang had come to remind him, Li Xian had to go back.

"That Uncle Xiang must be watching me from the shadows. I'll deliberately stall by collecting rent, delaying my return. Let the Madam wait a little longer."

He intentionally delayed, going to various shops to collect rent, dawdling and dragging it out until late at night.

When it was dark, Li Xian said, "Finally, the money is ready. Prepare the horses and carriage, transport it back to the One Union Manor!"

The carriage headed for the One Union Manor, carrying two chests of silver.

The gaze from the shadows finally faded.

The night breeze was cool.

Li Xian felt refreshed. The Madam wasn't all-powerful after all.

Back at the One Union Manor.

Ding Hu said, "Commander Li, you're back?" He stepped forward to greet him and ordered people to carry the silver down.

Li Xian said, "I'm exhausted. This silver is the Madam's fine, a full three thousand taels. I've finally gathered it today. Help me deposit it into the accounts."

"Three thousand taels?" Ding Hu said with admiration, "In less than a month, Commander Li was able to gather so much silver. Truly impressive."

"It's just luck, nothing to boast about," Li Xian said.

Back at the Commander's courtyard.

Li Xian pretended not to know about Qiuyue's defection, naturally feigning ignorance of the Madam's secrets and all these matters. As usual, he practiced his martial arts silently.

\[Proficiency +4\]

\[Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword · First Level\]

\[Proficiency: 9856/80000 Perfection\]

\[Waning Sun Decaying Blood Sword · Second Level\]

\[Proficiency: 1455/1600 Proficiency\]

The night grew deeper, the full moon hanging overhead.

\[食精 (Food Essence)\]

\[Proficiency: 27/100\]

The essence treasures were all consumed. It was time to prepare the cauldron again soon.

Li Xian sheathed his sword and was about to rest when he suddenly heard a voice in his mind: "Li Xian..."

A pause, then it continued:

"Come to the Serenity Pagoda to see me."

It was the Madam's voice.
