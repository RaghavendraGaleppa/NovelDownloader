# Chapter 53: The Purple Marten, Emerald Python, and Black Bear  

The water seal shattered, and light flooded the world as Gu Yuan regained his freedom. At the same time, he spotted a handsome young man who had suddenly appeared by the water's edge.  

The youth was strikingly good-looking, with lips as red as cinnabar and teeth like white jade. His hair was tied up with an emerald hairpin, and he wore a flowing blue-green robe with wide sleeves, exuding the refined air of a noble scion. His cultivation was similar to Gu Yuan's—at the sixth level of Qi Refinement—but his waist was adorned with several bulging spirit beast pouches.  

Initially, the young man had been smiling, watching the sealed space with amusement. But when the water seal abruptly broke, his grin froze.  

"You actually killed the water ape that quickly?" The youth was shocked, his eyes widening as he stared at Gu Yuan.  

"Was this your doing?" Gu Yuan's gaze turned icy as he scrutinized the stranger.  

He didn’t recognize this person—they had never met before. Why would he ambush him? Gu Yuan was puzzled.  

But the young man didn’t answer. His expression darkened as he hesitated, clearly taken aback that Gu Yuan had slain the half-blooded water ape so swiftly and emerged unscathed. This disrupted his original plan.  

Indecision gnawed at him—should he continue?  

But before he could decide, a thick, gray mist surged toward him, instantly enveloping the area within ten zhang.  

**Boom!**  

Not just mist—purple lightning crackled within the fog, carrying a violent energy as it streaked toward him.  

Gu Yuan had already struck.  

He didn’t know who this young man was, but since he had set a trap, he was undoubtedly an enemy. Capture first, questions later.  

Seeing the encroaching mist and the sudden lightning, the youth’s face twisted in alarm.  

"The **Cloud and Mist Seal Art**?!"  

"And a top-grade magical artifact?!"  

His expression soured as he realized he might have bitten off more than he could chew. But there was no turning back now. His face twisted into a snarl.  

"So what if you have secret seals and top-grade artifacts?"  

"I have my own methods!"  

"Once I kill you, they’ll all be mine!"  

These thoughts flashed through his mind in an instant. Reacting swiftly, he slapped his waist, summoning an earthen-yellow seal that hovered above his head, radiating golden-yellow light to block the incoming lightning.  

**Crack!**  

But the moment the seal appeared, a golden ring shot out from the mist, binding it tightly.  

The youth’s face paled—in just a breath’s time, he had lost all connection to his seal.  

**Boom!**  

The purple lightning continued unabated, hurtling toward him.  

At the same time, a silver mirror’s light pierced through the mist, instantly suppressing the youth’s body, mana, and spiritual sense, leaving him severely weakened.  

Panicked, he slapped his waist again, summoning a jade-green barrier to shield himself.  

**Crack!**  

Yet another golden ring shot forth, immobilizing the barrier before it could fully activate.  

**Boom!**  

With both defensive measures neutralized, the youth turned ashen. He tried to summon another seal, but it was too late.  

The lightning struck his head with a deafening roar.  

If it landed, his seventh-level Qi Refinement body would be obliterated.  

**Squeak! Squeak! Squeak!**  

But just then, a tiny purple marten darted out from his sleeve.  

The marten spat out a bolt of equally fierce lightning, intercepting Gu Yuan’s **Purple Lightning Chisel**.  

**Boom!**  

The two bolts collided, canceling each other out in a shower of sparks before dissipating into the mist.  

The youth exhaled in relief but didn’t hesitate. He slapped his chest, and a massive emerald python, five zhang long and as thick as a bowl, materialized in the mist.  

The python’s aura was dense—stronger than the youth’s sixth-level Qi Refinement, reaching the seventh level.  

**Hiss! Hiss! Hiss!**  

The moment it appeared, the python let out a furious hiss, exhaling a gale-force wind that tore through Gu Yuan’s **Cloud and Mist Seal Art**, revealing his hidden form.  

Gu Yuan had been channeling the **Secret Yuan Piercing Arrow**, preparing a fatal strike.  

Now exposed, his actions were laid bare before the youth.  

"**Secret Yuan Piercing Arrow**?!"  

The youth’s face twisted in horror, his brow twitching.  

"Go!"  

Without hesitation, he tore the largest spirit beast pouch from his waist and hurled it forward.  

**Roar!**  

A massive black bear, standing over ten feet tall, rode a gust of dark wind as it materialized.  

Its aura was overwhelming—already at the late stage of seventh-level Qi Refinement. Its eyes burned with malice as it charged Gu Yuan, swinging its massive paws.  

Gu Yuan remained unfazed. His **Cloud Radiance Robe** and **Black Tortoise Seal** activated simultaneously, forming a barrier before him.  

**Bang! Bang! Bang!**  

The black bear’s corrosive claws slammed into the defenses. The **Black Tortoise Seal** lasted only moments before dimming and retreating into Gu Yuan’s dantian. Only the **Cloud Radiance Robe** held on stubbornly.  

But it wasn’t Gu Yuan who was in trouble—it was the youth.  

Watching the eighty glowing runes coalescing in Gu Yuan’s palm, his heart pounded in terror. Without hesitation, he bit his tongue, activating a crimson seal in his dantian.  

"**Blood Ascension Seal**!" he roared.  

His face turned deathly pale as if half his blood had been drained.  

But the black bear’s aura surged, its body swelling to twice its size.  

**Crash!**  

The **Cloud Radiance Robe** shattered.  

"Kill him!" the youth screamed in triumph.  

Gu Yuan sighed. He couldn’t complete the runes in time.  

**Whoosh!**  

With a flick of his wrist, he released the **Secret Yuan Piercing Arrow**.  

A dazzling arrow shot forth.  

The black bear roared, blocking with its massive paws, channeling all its demonic energy.  

**Thud!**  

The arrow pierced through its palm and tore a bloody hole in its chest.  

Crimson blood gushed out, but the youth’s face lit up with glee.  

"Hahaha! It’s alive! It’s alive!"  

"I win!"  

The **Secret Yuan Piercing Arrow** was a killing strike.  

If the bear survived, victory was his!  

He refused to believe Gu Yuan had anything stronger.  

Even if the bear was gravely wounded, he had already won.  

But just as he laughed, his expression suddenly froze.  

His spiritual connection to the bear had vanished.  

Looking up, he saw a towering ice-blue giant hammering the bear’s skull with fists the size of cooking pots.  

The giant’s strength surpassed the bear’s—in the blink of an eye, the beast’s mangled corpse crashed into the water.  

"Is that… a **Star Spirit**?!"
