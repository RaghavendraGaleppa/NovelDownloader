# Chapter 12: Night Raid and Choice

After Han Zhen and the others withdrew, a middle-aged man dressed as a Taoist priest, holding a long sword and carrying two severed heads, emerged.

"How are things, Brother Chen?"

Hall Master Yue and another Protector emerged from the shadows of the forest. The battle Han Zhen and his group had just fought was watched by the three elders of the Seven Mystical Sect.

This group from the Wild Wolf Gang acted too crudely; Han Zhen had seen through their pretense at a glance. How could these seasoned veterans, who had dealt with the Wild Wolf Gang for years, not notice something amiss?

Protector Chen casually threw the two wide-eyed, dazed heads of Wild Wolf Gang disciples onto the ground. The cuts on their necks were smooth and even, indicating they likely felt no pain before death, showcasing Protector Chen's exquisite swordsmanship.

"There was indeed an ambush. Although the numbers weren't large, quite a few blue-robed enforcers were visible."

This certainly meant that high-ranking individuals commanding these blue-robed disciples were also among them.

A mere group of inexperienced youths from the Seven Mystical Sect wasn't worth the Wild Wolf Gang deploying such a formation. Protector Chen was concerned that there might be hidden masters "fishing" for them, so he didn't dare approach too closely.

The Wild Wolf Gang members are divided from bottom to top: green-robed disciples, blue-robed enforcers, and above them are command masters and several gang leaders, forming the high ranks.

The status of blue-robed enforcers is similar to the accomplished disciples of the Seven Mystical Sect's Seven Absolutes Hall; their martial arts cultivation is clearly above that of disciples like Han Zhen, who are on their first outdoor training mission.

Hall Master Yue and the other Protector frowned in thought after listening to Protector Chen's analysis. "Protector Chen has a point."

"It seems quite a few spies have infiltrated the city, thoroughly investigating the background of these disciples. The ambush was actually targeting us."

They wondered about the situation of the other training teams. Even if all the new disciples except Han Zhen were killed, the Seven Mystical Sect would just feel a pang of pain. But losing several Protectors and Hall Masters at once would truly shake the foundation of the Seven Mystical Sect. They hoped that all the team leaders were as cautious as young Han Zhen.

As Hall Master Yue spoke, he looked back in the direction of Guwei Town. By now, Han Zhen and his group should have met up with the outer disciples who were scheduled to provide assistance. Hall Master Yue considered proposing a purge to the Sect Master upon returning, estimating that a few "rats" might be caught within the Seven Mystical Sect itself.

Protector Chen was noncommittal about Hall Master Yue's idea. He took out a new, clean cotton cloth from his clothes and meticulously wiped his long sword. The sword gleamed brightly, yet Protector Chen wouldn't overlook any potential blemishes. Hall Master Yue and the other Protector were long accustomed to this.

"What about you two? How are things inside?" Protector Chen asked, carefully examining the wiped long sword.

Hall Master Yue rubbed the dust from his fingertips. He had just couldn't resist personally inspecting the damage caused by the armor-piercing arrow Han Zhen had thrown.

"It might not be long before young Han surpasses us."

Hall Master Yue even had an unrealistic thought: could it be that the Wild Wolf Gang's target was to eliminate Han Zhen?

***

The prosperity of Guwei Town was only relative to Qingniu Town during the day, with a bit more human traffic. At night, it became pitch black, with only a few inns and restaurants lighting their night lamps.

Wu Yan stumbled back to the inn, leaning on the wall, his steps light and unsteady. After several rounds of "battle" with Xiang'er tonight, he had also drunk some wine to enhance the mood. He had originally planned to spend the night with Xiang'er but was afraid of being seen by Miss Xiu'er the next day, so he reluctantly bid farewell to the soft embrace.

Under the faint moonlight, Wu Yan took a shortcut, staggering towards the dark side entrance of the inn, which had a night lamp. As he just poked half his body out of the dark alley, several figures flashed past not far away under the moonlight.

Wu Yan pulled back, holding his breath, listening carefully to the sounds outside. There were quite a few footsteps.

"That's... a night raid!!"

Wu Yan's intoxication instantly turned into cold sweat. His hand tremblingly reached for his waist; thankfully, he hadn't left his blade behind when he went out.

"What should I do... what should I do..."

He was only about ten steps away from the inn.

If he raised an alarm, he might give the more alert fellow disciples a chance to fight for their lives. But similarly, it would expose his own position, and he would instantly become the target of all!

To save or not to save?

Wu Yan slowly retreated, Han Zhen's figure involuntarily appearing in his mind. *He would definitely make a decision immediately, wouldn't he?*

Wu Yan struggled internally, his hand gripping the hilt of his blade tightly.

"I'm not wrong."

"If it were him, he would also choose this way... Xiu'er, don't blame me!"

Wu Yan retreated... not noticing the towering shadow that appeared behind him.

Han Zhen, who was sleeping in his clothes, instantly opened his eyes. With his Evergreen Arts at the third layer of perfection, Han Zhen's spiritual perception far exceeded that of ordinary people.

It was a faint, stifled whimper, followed by the crisp sound of a neck being twisted, accompanied by disorderly footsteps all around the inn.

Han Zhen picked up his eyebrow-level staff and secured his armor-piercing arrows to his back.

He quietly approached the slightly ajar window, turned sideways, and looked out at the inn's surroundings under the night sky. With the Evergreen Arts, Han Zhen's vision was even sharper at night; what was pitch black to ordinary people was as clear as day to Han Zhen.

"This is troublesome!"

***

All exits were controlled by enemies holding strong crossbows, and even the rooftops had enemies cutting off escape routes.

Four purple-robed middle-aged men exuded powerful auras, possessing strength no less than Hall Master Yue's. And the tall, towering giant with a golden blade at his waist had a long, deep breath, making his depth unfathomable.

The enemy's visible masters already outnumbered their own; it was clear they intended to wipe out all Seven Mystical Sect disciples in the town.

The outer disciples on covert sentry duty hadn't issued any warnings, perhaps there were even hidden marksmen lurking, ready to launch a sudden attack that would prevent anyone from fighting at their full potential.

Han Zhen felt a slight urge to retreat.

The enemy clearly had intelligence on their side, and it was unrealistic to resist by relying on the inn's internal terrain. The enemy wasn't setting fires yet, but that didn't mean they wouldn't if the siege dragged on.

Han Zhen tightened his grip on the eyebrow-level staff, having made up his mind.

Taking a deep breath, Han Zhen slammed his eyebrow-level staff onto the floorboards, producing a thunderous sound. Then he flipped out of the window, and sure enough, several crossbow bolts landed on the window sill, some even shooting into the room.

Han Zhen stepped onto the eaves of the roof, channeling true qi into his legs, launching himself forward like a cannonball at extreme speed. The crossbow bolts aimed at him all missed.

"Bold fellow! Get me a bow!"

The one-eyed giant who had twisted Wu Yan's neck had excellent eyesight and saw Han Zhen's figure clearly.

There were no techniques of light footwork; it was purely an explosion of raw strength and true qi. Each step he took on the rooftop caused the eaves and roof tiles to crack and shatter, creating a tremendous noise.

*He looks so young, who is this master from the Seven Mystical Sect?*

But looking at his direction... he's actually abandoning his fellow sect members and fleeing. Truly despicable!

The one-eyed giant anticipated Han Zhen's next landing spot, drawing his bow like a full moon. Suddenly, he clearly recognized the long staff in Han Zhen's hand.

"You are... Old Dog Wu's direct disciple!!"
