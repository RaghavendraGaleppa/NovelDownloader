# Chapter 171 Strength

Each close-range attack from the clone carried tremendous force. Even if the Foundation Establishment cultivator blocked it with a top-grade defensive magical artifact, the sheer impact would still affect him.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator couldn't help but panic. By now, it was clear to him that he had encountered a genius nurtured by a major sect—otherwise, how could a Qi Refinement cultivator suppress a Foundation Establishment cultivator?

Li Shiming had been quietly observing the battle. Without absolute confidence in delivering a fatal blow to the Foundation Establishment cultivator, he wouldn't reveal too much of his strength.

This was the weakest type of Foundation Establishment cultivator, perfect for practice.

Back on Tianhai Island, he had always been cautious, afraid of drawing the sect's attention, and never dared to expose too much.

But here in Northern Shu, deep within the Hundred Thousand Mountains, he had no sect, no friends, no family—nothing to hold him back.

On the battlefield, the clone appeared to be suppressing the Foundation Establishment cultivator, but in reality, it had no real means to kill him. 

The main issue was the lack of lethal capability. While the clone could overpower the Foundation Establishment cultivator with superior speed and strength, actually killing him required breaking through his defenses.

Of course, this was without considering the clone's third-grade sword foundation. But revealing such a trump card was only permissible if he could guarantee complete annihilation of all witnesses.

Li Shiming had seen what he needed to know—both he and his clone could hold their own against early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, at least in close combat.

He hesitated no longer. A streak of sword light shot from his hand and joined the battle.

His sword light was far more condensed than it had been half a year ago, infused with a much denser sword intent.

After months of dedicated study and guidance from his sword bone, he had truly grasped sword intent, no longer relying solely on the sword bone to channel it into his flying sword.

Even if he lost the sword bone now, he could still produce sword intent on his own—though self-generated sword intent paled in comparison to that from the sword bone. Still, it proved he was on the right path.

Unfortunately, having only recently mastered sword intent, he hadn't yet replicated it in his clone. That would require deeper comprehension over time.

He still wielded the Jade-Breaking Sword. Since his opponent's defensive artifact was also top-grade, it was a perfect opportunity to test the effectiveness of peer-level artifacts against Foundation Establishment cultivators.

"Sword intent!" The Foundation Establishment cultivator exclaimed in shock the moment the sword light struck his defensive artifact.

Even in Northern Shu, cultivators who comprehended sword intent were exceedingly rare. Each was a prized seed for sword cultivation, highly valued by sects.

The Foundation Establishment cultivator's mind raced—what kind of monsters had he encountered? One with physical strength surpassing a Foundation Establishment cultivator's body, and another who had mastered sword intent.

Either of these Qi Refinement cultivators would be considered elite disciples in any major sect.

A thought of retreat surfaced in his mind. But if he wanted to flee, Li Shiming wouldn't let him.

Each sword light from the main body weakened the spiritual imprint on the Foundation Establishment cultivator's defensive artifact, reducing his control over it.

Meanwhile, the clone's attacks came like a storm, leaving the Foundation Establishment cultivator no room to catch his breath.

So far, due to the clone's close-quarters combat, the Foundation Establishment cultivator hadn't been able to employ his preferred fighting style. His supreme-grade offensive artifact remained unused—it was designed for long-range attacks, and the initial shock from the clone's appearance had cost him the initiative.

Li Shiming's sword lights steadily eroded the spiritual imprint on the defensive artifact, while the clone relentlessly hammered at it.

As the Foundation Establishment cultivator's control over his artifact waned, its ability to withstand the clone's blows diminished. Each strike now sent violent tremors through the cultivator's body.

Realizing the dire situation, the Foundation Establishment cultivator knew he might die at the hands of these two Qi Refinement cultivators if this continued.

Gritting his teeth, he retrieved a talisman from his storage bag—a precious item obtained at great cost, capable of withstanding a single strike from a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. He just needed enough time to deploy his supreme-grade offensive artifact.

The talisman activated the instant his defensive artifact was knocked away. A vicious expression crossed his face—this would cost him dearly, but he intended to recoup his losses by looting the two Qi Refinement cultivators' storage bags after killing them.

He stopped dodging and defending, confident the talisman's protection would hold long enough for him to counterattack without restraint, showing these Qi Refinement cultivators the true power of Foundation Establishment.

When the clone saw the talisman transform into a defensive spell, it knew the perfect opportunity had arrived.

The Golden Strike Sword in its hand vanished, replaced by the third-grade sword foundation, which elongated into a longsword.

With textbook-perfect form, the clone thrust forward with both hands, delivering the most powerful strike of the entire battle.

Though not a true Golden Core treasure, the third-grade sword foundation had once pierced the skin of a Golden Core sword cultivator in actual combat.

Facing late-Foundation Establishment level defense, the clone's full-power thrust, augmented by the sword foundation's innate properties, shattered the protective barrier.

The sword foundation continued unimpeded, piercing the Foundation Establishment cultivator's body with such force that it sent him flying backward.

Simultaneously, a sword light controlled by Li Shiming's main body shot through the cultivator's forehead, leaving a gaping hole.

As the battle concluded and the Foundation Establishment cultivator's life force dissipated, Li Shiming burst into laughter, soon joined by his clone—like a pair of madmen.

All the frustration bottled up over these long months was finally released through this battle.

Back at the Tianhai Sect, he hadn't received evacuation orders and had to escape Tianhai Island via rocket, nearly becoming sea beast food along the way.

The resentment festering within him was part of why he'd chosen to confront the Foundation Establishment cultivator head-on.

He needed this cathartic battle to purge the accumulated grievances.

The results spoke for themselves—he and his clone, being one, had slain a Foundation Establishment cultivator, proving they possessed combat strength capable of killing early-stage Foundation Establishment opponents.

This confidence was crucial, marking a shift in his mindset.

Both he and his clone felt their spiritual energy grow more active. The clone nearly lost control of its urge to break through to the next level.

The clone had long been ready for advancement, but considerations about assisting the main body's cultivation and finding a suitable environment with adequate spiritual energy had delayed the process.

The same would soon apply to Li Shiming's main body—once his spiritual energy vortex compressed sufficiently, he too would need an appropriate cultivation environment.

He was no longer the cultivator who could rely solely on a Spirit Gathering Array in the mortal world. As a ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivator, both he and his clone now demanded much higher quality spiritual environments.

Li Shiming collected all the storage bags. The Foundation Establishment cultivator's was decent—a thirty-cubic-meter model unlocked by spiritual sense.

The four mid-Qi Refinement cultivators' storage bags received only a cursory glance before being tossed into his computer room space as extra storage.

In the Foundation Establishment cultivator's bag, he found a compass displaying a bright dot.

Experimentation revealed it was designed specifically to track the Senluo Token. A Senluo Sect emblem in one corner confirmed this—likely intentionally distributed by the sect to increase difficulty for those returning the tokens and stir up chaos.

Fortunately, the compass's detection range was limited to fifty kilometers. No wonder the Guan brothers had hidden among mortals earlier—mortals traveled routes completely different from cultivators, making them easy to overlook.

Unfortunately for the Guans, they'd already been marked, leading to their ambush.

Li Shiming chuckled as he tossed the Senluo Token into his computer room space. Instantly, the token that had been detectable even inside a storage bag vanished from the compass.

This came as no surprise—the computer room space excelled at blocking all sorts of signals, as evidenced by its ability to shield even Golden Core cultivators from sensing their own essence blood.

Among the Foundation Establishment cultivator's other possessions, only the supreme-grade flying axe held any value, and even that was mediocre by supreme-grade standards.

Li Shiming found it curious that a rogue cultivator could reach Foundation Establishment—something nearly unimaginable back on Tianhai Island.

The Foundation Establishment Pill alone created an insurmountable barrier for rogue cultivators there. Any with sufficient talent to reach ninth-level Qi Refinement would have long been recruited by one of the seven major sects, never remaining rogue.

Abandoning thoughts of rest, Li Shiming considered the cultivator's earlier words—he belonged to a cultivation family. Lingering risked further pursuit.

Despite having killed a Foundation Establishment cultivator, this one had been among the weakest of his rank.

While Li Shiming possessed means to kill Foundation Establishment cultivators, treasures like talismanic treasures were reserved for life-or-death situations, not to be wasted here.

Stowing his clone in the computer room space, Li Shiming employed sword flight to depart.

He maintained course for Guanquan City, but first detoured to a market along the route—one mentioned by Third Guan, operated by the Wei cultivation family and reputed among local Qi Refinement cultivators for fairness and safety.

He needed to purchase a proper map. While Golden Core sword cultivator Yun Xingyi's map was detailed, locations marked for Golden Core cultivators were far too dangerous for a mere Qi Refinement cultivator like himself.

Markets frequented by Golden Core cultivators were high-end establishments where Li Shiming's very attempt to enter would draw unwanted attention—anyone seeking such places either carried valuable treasures for sale or harbored dangerous secrets.

At ninth-level Qi Refinement with continuously compressed spiritual energy, Li Shiming's sword flight duration and speed had improved dramatically.

His right thumb's sword bone provided about a ten percent speed boost during flight—a percentage that would increase as his sword intent mastery deepened and he learned to better channel the sword bone's energy.

After half a day's travel, he reached a valley whose ordinary appearance belied the array fluctuations he detected from afar—a perk of his advanced array mastery through the Stellar Sea of Arrays technique.

Retrieving a veiled hat from the Foundation Establishment cultivator's storage bag (likely for anonymous market visits), Li Shiming concealed his face. Though not a magical artifact, the veil's spiritual material blocked spiritual sense probing.

At the valley entrance, he channeled spiritual energy to form a hand seal, opening an access path through the array. In truth, the array was simple enough that he could bypass it without the seal, though discovery would cause complications.

Entering the passage, his spiritual sense mapped the valley's array with perfect clarity through IBMz15's computational assistance—a precaution ensuring escape routes if trouble arose in the market.

The so-called market was more accurately the Wei cultivation family's compound, with an external area designated for commerce. This arrangement guaranteed security, as the Weis maintained a permanent Foundation Establishment presence here.

Naturally, outsiders couldn't approach the family's living quarters, though their buildings were visible from the market.

The setup mirrored Tianhai Island's markets—part mobile stalls, part fixed shops. Today wasn't a peak activity day, leaving both vendors and customers sparse by the market's standards.

But most visitors came with purchasing intent—few browsed idly.

As Li Shiming wandered the stalls, he noted the goods. While all catered to Qi Refinement needs, the sheer abundance compared to Tianhai Island underscored Northern Shu's prosperity.

Tianhai markets rarely offered late-Qi Refinement resources—those came either from sects or personal sea beast hunts. Here, even mobile stalls carried higher-tier materials.
