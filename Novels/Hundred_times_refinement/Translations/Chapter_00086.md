# Chapter 36: The Value of Pills  

With major sects and cultivation families participating, rogue cultivators held little hope of finding treasures at the upcoming Lingyun Sect auction. Thus, they placed greater importance on the current market stalls, which explained why the square was bustling early in the morning.  

Lin Xuan's main goal was to obtain an intermediate-level cultivation manual containing the Spirit Control Technique, something unlikely to be found in these simple stalls. Therefore, he was in no hurry. Instead, he strolled leisurely, observing the market and broadening his knowledge.  

To his surprise, although the rogue cultivators were mostly at the second or third layer of the Spirit Movement Stage—with Lin Xuan's current cultivation level already considered decent—they lacked high-quality goods. However, due to their sheer numbers, the stalls offered almost everything a low-level cultivator might need, giving Lin Xuan quite an eye-opening experience.  

For example, at one stall, he saw a young woman in her late teens selling storage equipment of all kinds—storage rings, bracelets, hairpins, necklaces—covering nearly every type of accessory a girl might wear. On the surface, they appeared exquisitely crafted and visually appealing.  

Of course, there were items for men too: storage belts, pouches, and even boots. The variety was dazzling, and Lin Xuan found himself drawn in.  

"Interested, fellow Daoist? High quality at a bargain—just two low-grade Body Refining Pills per item."  

The price was shockingly low. If not for Lin Xuan's composed nature, he might have stumbled in surprise. Though he wasn't entirely familiar with the market rates for cultivation items, even the lowest-level disciples of the Piaoyun Valley received two low-grade Body Refining Pills each month. This price seemed absurdly cheap.  

Here, Lin Xuan's understanding contained a misconception. In the past, despite his lack of spiritual roots and slow cultivation progress, which earned him disdain within the sect, he was still far luckier than rogue cultivators. Aside from Elder Ma's deliberate obstruction, he had always received his two low-grade pills every month.  

Later, with his pill purification ability, he had an endless supply, so he no longer valued these low-level pills. But he had forgotten that only sect disciples enjoyed the privilege of receiving two pills monthly.  

In this world, countless rogue cultivators had no backing or support. While sects had dedicated alchemists, how could a low-level rogue cultivator possibly refine pills or gather ingredients? Thus, though sect disciples received only a modest supply, they at least had some medicinal aid, whereas rogue cultivators relied solely on their own efforts.  

This was why, under similar circumstances, sect disciples were stronger than rogue cultivators. Most rogue cultivators remained stagnant at the Spirit Movement Stage, with very few advancing to higher levels.  

Of course, guidance from elders and access to better techniques also played a role, but the lack of medicinal support was undoubtedly the most critical factor.  

Cultivation required effort, spiritual roots, and pills—all equally important. Spiritual roots and pills could compensate for each other. Take Lin Xuan, for example: an ordinary person who consumed pills like meals could still progress faster than his peers. Conversely, a genius with exceptional spiritual roots could achieve remarkable results without pills.  

But how many heaven-defying geniuses existed in the world? Most rogue cultivators had average talent, forever stuck at the Spirit Movement Stage.  

This was why pills were treasures in the eyes of rogue cultivators—extremely valuable. Lin Xuan only thought the price was cheap because of his own perspective. In reality, it was entirely reasonable.  

"Fellow Daoist, pick one! These storage items are exquisitely crafted and a real bargain," the girl urged, seeing Lin Xuan's interest.  

"May I take a look?" Lin Xuan picked up a pouch-like item.  

"Of course."  

With her permission, Lin Xuan channeled his spiritual sense into the pouch but withdrew it almost immediately. Noticing his lack of enthusiasm, the girl grew anxious. "Not to your liking?"  

"It's a bit small."  

Lin Xuan was honest but polite. The storage pouch was practically garbage—its inner space was only a cubic foot, barely enough for a few pills or talismans. Anything larger, like a spirit tool, wouldn't fit.  

It couldn't compare to the storage items he had obtained from Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu. The bracelet had about five square meters of space, while the belt, once used by a Foundation Establishment expert, had the capacity of a small bedroom.  

Hearing Lin Xuan's complaint, the girl blushed. At only the second layer of the Spirit Movement Stage, she had learned a crafting technique and made these items herself. But with her limited cultivation, the results were mediocre. Though the storage equipment looked appealing, their functionality was lacking. She had been at the stall all day without a single sale.  

"Fellow Daoist, how about one pill per item?"  

Lin Xuan shook his head and walked away without hesitation. Though he had plenty of Body Refining Pills, he wasn't about to waste them. Even if he didn't mind the loss, flaunting wealth would only draw unwanted attention. Lin Xuan was no philanthropist—he wouldn't act without benefit.  

After leaving the girl's stall, Lin Xuan continued browsing, occasionally stopping to examine items or inquire about prices. But he bought nothing. First, the goods were either too low-quality or useless to him. Second, he didn't want to appear reckless with his spending. Since he was posing as a rogue cultivator, he needed to act the part—poor and frugal. Flaunting wealth would only invite trouble.  

Time flowed like water. Two hours passed unnoticed, and the sun now hung directly overhead—noon, the time for meals.  

High-level cultivators could abstain from food, sustaining themselves on spiritual energy alone. But low-level cultivators couldn't manage that. Lin Xuan decided to return to the inn to replenish his energy. Though he hadn't bought anything, his morning stroll had been fruitful. At the very least, he now had a clear understanding of market prices.  

Pills were far more valuable than he had imagined—even Body Refining Pills, especially mid-grade ones. While they wouldn't cause a sensation, they would undoubtedly turn heads.  

With this realization, Lin Xuan made a decision: the pills he carried would suffice to purchase the intermediate-level technique jade slip. But unless absolutely necessary, he would never reveal his mid-grade pills.
