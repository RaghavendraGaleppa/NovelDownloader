# Chapter 32: Registration  

"Is this the headquarters of the Luodu Squad—Luodu Island?"  

Zhang Jing instinctively compared Luodu Island to the other islands he had seen before, only to realize the difference between them was like heaven and earth.  

It wasn't just about the size of the island.  

It was also about the number of powerful auras he could sense with his spiritual perception.  

"Senior Brother Yangchu, is this how all the top ten mission squads in the outer court are? And why don't the top ten squads have the five-year Dao Merit deduction rule like the others?"  

Seizing the opportunity, Zhang Jing voiced all the questions in his mind.  

Instead of answering directly, Zhang Yangchu countered with a question:  

"Junior Brother, we've seen quite a few mission squads on our way here. What do you think of them compared to our Luodu Squad?"  

"They're not even on the same level!" Zhang Jing replied sincerely.  

Zhang Yangchu nodded, then explained, "Among the top ten squads, there are stronger and weaker ones, but even the tenth-ranked squad far surpasses those below in terms of overall strength and foundation."  

"As for the reason?"  

A hint of pride appeared on his face.  

"It's because—every squad has produced more than one inner court disciple, and this tradition continues unbroken. With the support of senior brothers from the inner court, our squads lack nothing but talent!"  

"Of course, everything has its pros and cons. Enjoying benefits naturally comes with corresponding responsibilities."  

"What responsibilities?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.  

"Some extremely dangerous and troublesome demon-suppression missions in the outer court can be declined by other squads, but not by us. At the same time, we also bear the responsibility of nurturing the next generation of inner court disciples."  

Zhang Yangchu's voice suddenly grew solemn.  

"Countless members have perished during missions, including those at the tenth level of Qi Refining. Junior Brother, since you've just entered the outer court, you must be cautious when undertaking demon-suppression missions."  

Hearing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but ask,  

"Senior Brother, is the demon-suppression mission mandatory for everyone?"  

"Of course. The Dao Academy has a rule: every outer court disciple must undertake at least one demon-suppression mission within a year. Besides, Junior Brother, you need Dao Merit for cultivation as well. The fastest and primary way to earn Dao Merit is through demon-suppression missions."  

"The mission reward is a sum of Dao Merit, and the materials from the demons, as well as any rare treasures you find during the mission, can be sold to the Thousand Techniques Pavilion for another substantial income of Dao Merit."  

So that's how it is.  

Zhang Jing nodded in understanding.  

As they spoke, the two had already arrived above a sprawling complex at the center of Luodu Island.  

---  

The flying sword gradually descended and finally stopped in front of a majestic pavilion.  

"Junior Brother," Zhang Yangchu leaped lightly off the flying sword and said with a smile, "This is our Luodu Squad's Merit Hall. I'll take you inside to register and also give you the promised cultivation cave and the opportunity to exchange for a mid-grade inheritance."  

"Understood. Thank you, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing jumped down from the flying sword, his face filled with gratitude.  

"Haha, it's what I should do as your senior brother."  

As he spoke, Zhang Yangchu led Zhang Jing into the Merit Hall.  

As soon as they entered, Zhang Jing saw a senior sister in a white robe approaching them with a warm smile.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother Zhang."  

Seeing her, Zhang Yangchu chuckled and said, "Ah, Junior Sister Tong is on duty today. Seems like your mission went smoothly."  

"Ugh—Senior Brother, don't remind me. This time, the four of us, led by Senior Brother Ding, easily found that Three-Headed Pheasant. But when we attacked, we realized the demon was incredibly skilled in flight. Senior Brother Ding had to use a mid-grade talisman just to barely wound it."  

"He's still sulking about it now."  

The female cultivator called 'Junior Sister Tong' frowned slightly and pouted.  

Then she noticed Zhang Jing standing behind Zhang Yangchu and asked curiously,  

"And this junior brother is...?"  

"Junior Sister, this is Zhang Jing, a new member of our squad. I'm here to register him." Zhang Yangchu introduced.  

Then he turned to Zhang Jing and said,  

"Junior Brother, this is Senior Sister Tong Yao, who joined a year before you. If I recall correctly, she ranked fourth in her entrance exam~"  

As soon as he finished speaking, Tong Yao rolled her eyes and corrected,  

"Senior Brother, I was third! Third!"  

"Oh, then it's perfect. Both you and Junior Brother Zhang ranked third in your exams—what a coincidence!" Zhang Yangchu teased with a wink.  

"Senior Brother, you're always teasing me!"  

The next moment.  

Tong Yao glanced at Zhang Jing, a mischievous glint flashing in her bright eyes. She clasped her hands behind her back and circled Zhang Jing with exaggerated scrutiny.  

"Oh~ So this is Junior Brother."  

"Greetings, Senior Sister Tong!"  

Faced with the senior sister standing so close, Zhang Jing greeted her awkwardly.  

Then—  

*Smack!*  

A crisp sound rang out as Tong Yao jumped up and slapped Zhang Jing's shoulder. Her sparkling eyes gleamed with excitement as she exclaimed in a bell-like voice,  

"Haha, don't worry, Junior Brother! From now on, your senior sister has your back!"  

Opposite them, Zhang Yangchu couldn't help but show a strange expression upon hearing this.  

---  

But he didn't comment, only reminding her:  

"Junior Sister, shouldn't you help Junior Brother register first?"  

"Oh, right, right! I almost forgot. Sorry, Junior Brother, could you hand me your identity jade pendant?"  

After being reminded, Tong Yao seemed to snap back to reality.  

Zhang Jing took out his identity jade pendant and handed it to her.  

She took the pendant and quickly walked inside.  

Watching her retreating figure, Zhang Yangchu smiled helplessly. "Don't mind her, Junior Brother. Your Senior Sister Tong can be a bit... lively at times. You'll get used to it."  

"It's fine, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing replied calmly.  

Before long, Tong Yao returned and handed Zhang Jing his jade pendant along with a jade slip, saying softly, "Junior Brother, welcome to the Luodu Squad. This jade slip contains some information about the Dao Academy and our squad. It should be useful to you."  

"Thank you, Senior Sister."  

At that moment.  

Zhang Yangchu spoke up again, "Junior Sister, could you fetch the jade key to the West No. 23 Cave for Junior Brother? Oh, and also a mid-grade inheritance exchange voucher."  

What?!  

For a moment, Tong Yao froze, thinking she had misheard. She turned to Zhang Yangchu in confusion.  

"Senior Brother, aren't caves only available for application by squad officers? And the mid-grade inheritance exchange voucher—are you sure?"  

Meeting her gaze, Zhang Yangchu nodded firmly.  

"Junior Sister, the squad leaders have already approved this. Go ahead."  

Seeing Tong Yao still looking shocked and puzzled, he explained with a smile:  

"Haha, Junior Sister, you just returned from a mission, so you might not know. The difficulty of Junior Brother Zhang's entrance exam was nothing like yours."  

"There were two A-grade prodigies, and nearly thirty people received B-grade evaluations. During the ranking assessment, sixteen participants were already at the second level of Qi Refining."  

"And your Junior Brother Zhang here secured third place with overwhelming dominance. His performance was only slightly behind the two A-grade prodigies, far surpassing the other B-grade talents."  

On the spot.  

With every word Zhang Yangchu spoke, Tong Yao's shock deepened, her eyes flickering with disbelief.  

After hearing everything, she stared at Zhang Jing as if he were a monster and said,  

"Junior Brother, wait here a moment. I'll go fetch them now."  

Soon.  

Tong Yao returned and carefully handed Zhang Jing a jade key and a voucher, explaining:  

"Junior Brother, just channel your spiritual sense into the jade key to locate the West No. 23 Cave. As for this inheritance exchange voucher, take it to the Inheritance Pavilion, and you can directly exchange it for a mid-grade inheritance."  

Zhang Jing accepted the key and voucher.  

"Thank you for the reminder, Senior Sister."  

Meanwhile, Zhang Yangchu seemed to remember something else and said to Tong Yao:  

"Junior Sister, remember to pick a suitable mission for your team soon and take Junior Brother Zhang with you. He's just starting his cultivation journey, so his techniques aren't fully developed yet, and his cultivation level is still low. I'll need you to look after him. I'll speak to Junior Brother Ding later."  

"Understood, Senior Brother. Don't worry, I'll take good care of Junior Brother Zhang."  

Tong Yao clenched her small fist, brimming with confidence.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing," Zhang Yangchu turned to Zhang Jing, "remember to come to the Merit Hall on the first of every month to collect your Purple Spirit Pills. I have other matters to attend to, so I'll take my leave now."  

With that, he strode out.  

"Take care, Senior Brother!"
