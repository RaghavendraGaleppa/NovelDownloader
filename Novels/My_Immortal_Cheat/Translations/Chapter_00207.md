# Chapter 207: Dispersal

Puzhi was also stunned by Zhou Tian's peculiar thought process. After a brief silence, a voice once again entered Zhou Tian's ears.

"Kid, I can't hold on for much longer."

The voice carried a hint of untamed arrogance, completely unlike the old man's voice from before.

"That's better." Zhou Tian let out a breath of relief. He found it very uncomfortable to be spoken to in such a tone by someone with a pale, delicate face.

"I used special means to merge with my master's residual Buddhist Kingdom to gain this power," Puzhi explained. "However, the Buddhist Kingdom was already severely damaged during the ancient war and has undergone countless years of erosion. Its power is less than one percent of its original. My time is limited."

"What do we do then?" Zhou Tian asked. Once Puzhi's power vanished, another shed skin would appear, which would be an enormous problem.

"So, I need your help?" Puzhi said, cutting out another sword qi to suppress the human skin shed skin that was trying to resurface.

"Me? How can I help? Those are two Heavenly Venerate-level shed skins! How can I stop them? Just tell me if there's any small path to sneak out of here." Zhou Tian had no intention of pretending to be strong. He could somewhat handle one human skin shed skin, but dealing with two would definitely leave him flustered, and it would be utterly pointless.

"No, to get out, you must destroy these human skin shed skins. Besides, don't you want that Heavenly Venerate artifact?" Puzhi said with a firm tone. This place was opened in a hazy, unknown realm. If they didn't exit from the correct location, they would likely drift into the Star Realm. If they encountered some great horror in the Star Realm, even Heavenly Venerates wouldn't be enough to fill its teeth.

"It's not that I don't want to stop them, it's that I can't. I'm also a Heavenly Venerate raised by special means, a half-baked one at that." Zhou Tian let out a bitter laugh. It truly wasn't that he didn't want to stop them; he was powerless. "What's more, isn't old man Wutian here? How could I, a junior, step forward?" Zhou Tian added, "Your master is still here. He's a formidable character who dared to directly confront Border Hell in ancient times. Why do you insist on looking for me?"

"My time isn't much either." An unfamiliar voice interjected. It was undoubtedly Wutian. Even if they were two 'half-baked' Heavenly Venerates, only someone in the Heavenly Venerate realm could interrupt their divine sense communication. The three temporarily formed a divine sense network. Although they were all 'half-baked' Heavenly Venerates, they were still Heavenly Venerates, and each exchange happened in an instant.

"..." Zhou Tian was speechless. Both of them claimed to have even less time than him, yet they acted as if they were going to defy the heavens. Couldn't they have a little self-awareness?

"Senior Wutian, didn't you leave any escape routes when you opened this space?" Zhou Tian asked again, knowing that soon it would be just him fighting three shed skins alone, which would be utterly pointless.

"I am merely a wisp of a remnant soul. With the help of the lotus seed and some residual energy, I can barely exert the strength of a Heavenly Venerate. I've forgotten most things."

Zhou Tian's mind reeled. "You've forgotten everything, except how to trick people, right?"

"Seniors, how do you expect me to stop these three shed skins?" Zhou Tian was helpless. Even if two of the shed skins were held back, if one went to assist the Burial Scroll, he wouldn't be able to withstand it.

"They are all my shed skins. There's a forbidden art in the Burial Scroll that can merge one's shed skins to unleash unimaginable power, but it's not sustainable, as that power would even backfire on oneself. But now that I'm dead, it doesn't matter. In fact, you'll only need to deal with one when the time comes." Wutian was more uninhibited than Puzhi, using various divine abilities with ease. A Buddha and a Demon King fighting alongside each other was a truly rare sight in the world.

"Didn't you say you'd forgotten most things?" Zhou Tian questioned.

"Coincidentally, this is the one thing I remember clearly."

"..." Zhou Tian was stifled again. "Serves you right for being beaten to death by the people from Border Hell, serves you right!"

"How strong will the merged human skin shed skin be?" Zhou Tian asked.

"How strong? Anyway, it will be very strong." Wutian gave a vague answer. Zhou Tian wanted to press further, but Wutian excused himself, saying he was just a remnant soul and couldn't estimate it.

"Puzhi, where is the Heavenly Venerate artifact you promised me?" Zhou Tian suddenly remembered. These two were about to dissipate, and the Heavenly Venerate artifact was nowhere to be seen. Such a powerful aid, yet Puzhi hadn't brought it out to use.

"It's inside me. The Buddhist Kingdom's energy isn't easily gathered; it needs something to suppress it and act as its core. The Buddha Wheel is within me."

"It will naturally be yours after I dissipate. It should give you a few more chances of success against the merged human skin shed skin." Hearing Puzhi's words, Zhou Tian grew increasingly uneasy. Even with a Heavenly Venerate artifact in hand, he would only have a few more chances of success.

"Master, your disciple failed to fulfill your last wish. It is my fault." Puzhi's voice suddenly turned sorrowful, as if he were delivering his last words.

"Puzhi," Wutian let out a long sigh, filled with endless melancholy, "your master once dominated a realm, ascended to the peak of power, and even stood alone against ancient, long-standing great forces. But do you know what your master's proudest achievement in this lifetime was? It was taking you as my disciple."

"My body as a sword! World birth, world destruction!" Puzhi did not respond within the divine sense network. In his direction, a fierce roar erupted. His body seemed to transform into a sharp sword, divine light blossoming as it fiercely slashed down towards the human skin shed skin!

Boom!

The sword light descended like a galaxy. Chaotic divine demons roared, and the stars of the universe revolved. Under this single sword strike, it was as if worlds were being created and destroyed. The sword light pierced through eternity, sweeping across several epochs, seemingly cleaving from the very end of time. Nothing could break it, nothing could stop it. The sword qi streaked across hundreds of millions of miles, severing everything!

"What if it's the World Birth, World Destruction Sword? I am Wutian!" The human skin shed skin roared, clenching its fists. Blood-red runes blossomed, carrying an aura like that of creation, intending to smash through the sword light.

However, with crushing force.

Pfft!

A burst of blood mist erupted. The human skin was directly cleaved in half by the sword light. The blood mist enveloped everything, making it impossible to see what exactly was happening.

Subsequently, the sword qi transformed back into Puzhi. However, his body was extremely dissipated, almost transparent. A shimmering golden object could be seen at his heart; it was precisely the Buddha Wheel.

"Does my World Birth, World Destruction Sword have a fraction of Master's style?" A smile appeared on Puzhi's face as he asked Wutian with a slightly boastful tone.

"It already has seven-tenths of my style, but you still need more practice." Wutian nodded, also smiling.

"Seven-tenths? Seven-tenths is enough." Puzhi's body transformed into a rain of light and vanished between heaven and earth. Light erupted from his chest, and the Buddha Wheel floated out, trembling and wailing. Divine artifacts possessed sentience, and it too grieved Puzhi's dissipation.
