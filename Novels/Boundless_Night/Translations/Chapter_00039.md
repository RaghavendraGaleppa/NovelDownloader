Chapter 39: The Whole World Is Different Now

The room was so quiet you could hear a pin drop, yet in this profound silence, Qin Ming inexplicably heard whispers, incredibly close. He grabbed his long-handled dark-gold hammer, his body tensing like a leopard. It wasn't a hallucination; he had even seen a blurry shadow just moments ago.

Outside, the night was deep. The sunstone in the room gradually dimmed, then flickered once before going out completely, plunging everything into a pitch-black silence. Fortunately, the murmuring by Qin Ming's ear had also vanished.

A moment later, he reached for the leather sword manual, its pages curled and heavily worn. It was quiet; nothing happened. He picked up the manual. The room was too dark to read the words on the pages, and no more anomalies occurred. Was it just an illusion earlier?

Qin Ming immediately went out, walked to the fire spring at the village entrance, retrieved a few glowing, brilliant stones, and quickly returned home. With the large hammer in one hand and the old manual in the other, he flipped through the pages. It remained calm, with no murmuring whispers.

"Was I hallucinating just now?"

Soon, Qin Ming stopped being distracted and refocused his attention on the ancient-looking leather pages, carefully studying the crystallized wisdom of his predecessors.

"Sigh..."

At this very moment, Qin Ming's hair stood on end. Not only did he hear whispers in the profound silence, but a clear sigh echoed in his ears. Moreover, an old man with white hair appeared in the dim room, his tattered clothes stained with blood, flickering before Qin Ming's eyes. The temperature in the room seemed to drop by several degrees, and even the newly brought sunstones appeared to dim. Qin Ming reacted swiftly, striking directly with a hammer-blow. The sigh disappeared, and the old man in tattered, blood-stained clothes vanished with it.

What was happening? The world appeared different in Qin Ming's eyes. His expression was solemn; merely studying a sword manual was turning out to be so bizarre. He gripped his long-handled dark-gold hammer and carefully surveyed the room. The sunstones were still bright, the temperature didn't seem to have dropped, and everything had returned to normal.

"Is this a demonic book?" Qin Ming stared at the manual. It was bound with animal hide and seemed quite old, every page worn. "Or did absorbing that liquid make my spirit overly vigorous, causing me to see and hear abnormalities?" He pondered carefully.

Finally, he gritted his teeth, deciding to throw caution to the wind for now. He would observe calmly rather than act preemptively, to see exactly what kind of demon or ghost this was.

Qin Ming held the hammer in one hand and flipped through the manual with the other. Aside from the rustle of the leather pages, there was no other sound in the room until he fully immersed himself, concentrating on studying the various combat techniques. Then, the whispers reappeared, and a disheveled, blood-stained old man stood not far in front.

"Time is short. I'll leave this sword manual. Alas, it's a pity. My Way of the Blade is hard to fully describe, destined to lose some parts. What a waste of my half-lifetime's effort," the old man sighed. Then, Qin Ming saw him hunched over a desk, writing. One after another, blade lights appeared, seeming to tear open the night sky. Each time the old man completed a blade technique with his brush, scenes of him practicing the blade arts in his youth would appear before Qin Ming, along with his various emotions, insights, and understanding of the blade forms.

Qin Ming immediately realized how significant and impactful this was for him. After absorbing the liquid from the "scraps," the world he saw was completely different. When his mind was highly focused, through this ancient book, he experienced the author's state of mind, resonating emotionally, and his understanding of the blade techniques surpassed what was recorded in the book. Qin Ming considered himself to have high comprehension, learning everything very quickly. Earlier, when he flipped through the sword manual in the mountains, he didn't find it difficult to practice and quickly grasped its essentials. But the current situation was no longer about comprehension; it was about witnessing how the sword manual came into being, resonating with the old man's spirit when he practiced his blade arts. This involved experience, profound insights, and the most fundamental understanding of this particular blade technique.

"This sword manual carries an old man's half-lifetime of effort. I'm resonating with it, recreating the true scenes from back then..." Qin Ming was briefly distracted and then exited that real scene.

Afterward, he put down the dark-gold hammer, sat before the copper basin containing the sunstones, and began earnestly studying the sword manual from the beginning, fully immersing his mind in it. Indeed, the more focused he became, the more concentrated his spirit, the clearer those sounds, those images, and that emotional and spiritual resonance became.

At one point, he saw the old man gazing at the night sky, deep in thought about blade techniques, then piercing the night with a dazzling blade light. Then the scene shifted again: lightning flashed, thunder roared, and torrential rain poured down. The old man gained new insights, standing in the heavy rain with a wooden blade, delivering a heart-stopping strike that seemed to cleave the heavens. The radiance bursting from the wooden blade appeared to overpower the lightning in the night sky, tearing through the darkness.

Qin Ming's mind trembled with excitement. This stance was not recorded in the sword manual at all. This subtle technique, which could only be understood implicitly and not explicitly described, was a strike that could only be unleashed when one's spirit ascended. This profound and mysterious feeling was difficult to put on paper, which was why the old man had sighed that parts of the essence of his blade techniques were destined to be lost. But now, Qin Ming had witnessed it, and through emotional and spiritual resonance, he had completely grasped the essence of that strike.

In the subsequent blade techniques, the old man cultivated diligently in the deep mountains, slaying giant beasts. Next, he traveled alone through wind and snow, battling multiple powerful enemies, losing an arm. Severely wounded, he fled far away, and in his twilight years, he buried a broken blade. Afterward, he lived alone, recuperating, staying secluded. After five years of quiet meditation, he dug up the broken blade. When he struck again, that brilliant blade light, capable of cleaving the heavens in a rainy night, became even more overbearing, as if splitting mountains that blocked its path and flattening seas that obstructed it.

The older he got, the more vigorous he became. His blade intent did not follow the path of returning to simplicity or nature, but rather soared upward relentlessly until the terrifying blade light threatened to consume his emaciated body, unable to bear it any longer. After the old man journeyed far again, sweeping aside all opponents with his broken blade, he finally returned to the place where he had meditated for five years. He buried his blade, left behind his writings, and reached the final moments of his life.

"Alas, I was trapped in a remote land, lacking secret methods to efficiently enhance my life essence. Although my understanding of the Way of the Blade is profound, and I am confident my comprehension is no weaker than anyone's, I was hampered by my body and couldn't access higher-level texts. My life could only stop here." The old man had little time left and wrote quickly. With every stroke, blade lights flashed. However, when it came to "Heavenly Light," the scenes blurred, and the subsequent pages became completely illegible. Qin Ming knew it was likely because he hadn't yet cultivated Heavenly Light, making him unable to emotionally and spiritually resonate with those parts, thus he couldn't see them for now.

He closed the manual and shut his eyes. Everything he had seen, heard, and all the scenes, surfaced in his mind. Those experiences, insights, and new understandings of blade techniques felt like his own personal journey. He picked up the long-handled dark-gold hammer and went into the courtyard, performing blade techniques not recorded in the manual. For a moment, it was as if lightning and thunder appeared under the night sky. The large hammer in Qin Ming's hand continuously swept across the night sky, its dark-gold head moving faster and faster, leaving behind various terrifying trajectories that intertwined in the courtyard, gradually weaving together, as if erupting into dense, horrific blade lights. He stopped, standing with his hammer, his heart deeply shaken, for he had recreated those blade techniques.

Qin Ming was confident that if given the complete blade techniques, he would certainly master them after a certain amount of time. But now, through spiritual resonance, he had mastered these blade techniques—which surpassed the manual itself—in just one night, as if he had practiced for decades. Soon, Qin Ming calmed down. This only applied to techniques, experience, and understanding of blade arts. As for the enhancement of his own life essence, that still required cultivation. But even this was enough to shock the world!

He pondered what that liquid in the stone chunks could be, which allowed his spirit to resonate with the mysterious emotions carried by this book. Qin Ming realized that the mysterious substance in the "scraps" might not be inferior to what was nurtured by the fusion of the ten pillars of light and the five-colored mist. If this knowledge got out, it would likely cause an immeasurable storm. He even suspected that these "scraps" might have a much greater origin.

Qin Ming's thoughts surged, bringing many things to mind. On the night the great fire consumed the entire village, the youth in feather robes appeared ethereal and otherworldly, holding a gleaming purple bamboo staff, transcending the mundane. It was clear his origins were extraordinary, his strength certainly unfathomable, and the sect behind him likely even more terrifying. Now, Qin Ming had gained a sense of composure and confidence. In the future, he could walk towards Fallen Moon City and confront his bloody past head-on. At the same time, the two women who appeared at the village entrance clearly walked a different path from him, seemingly able to look down upon those who cultivated the Rebirth Method. Currently, Qin Ming believed that his own path might not be weaker than others. As long as he progressed fast enough, he could break through any path.

After calming down, he began to assess his strength. He now possessed over two thousand jin of strength in his arms, possibly even reaching twenty-two hundred jin. Coupled with his mastery of the essence not recorded in the sword manual, his actual combat ability seemed somewhat terrifying.

"Can I contend with those old fellows who have cultivated Heavenly Light Qi?" Qin Ming pondered. He silently calculated: even if those old fellows could lift a six-hundred-jin tripod during their first rebirth, using that as a base, three rebirths would put them around eighteen hundred jin, still less than him. This was why everyone placed immense importance on their first rebirth, wanting to lay down a golden foundation, because subsequent rebirths would build upon this base. Qin Ming believed that the most terrifying aspect of those who had undergone three rebirths was their cultivation of Heavenly Light Qi. If they managed to entangle him in close combat, he would surely die. Because this special inner force could even pierce and tear through the scales of giant beasts, its destructive power was extremely potent and terrifying. This was the fundamental reason why humans, despite their lack of physical advantage, could contend with anomalous beings.

However, in the realm of rebirth, Heavenly Light Qi could only be distributed on the body's surface, extending slightly beyond the fists and feet, and could not yet expand to weapons. Qin Ming muttered to himself, "In that case, as long as I don't let those old fellows with three rebirths get close and maintain a suitable distance, I can still fight them." The premise was that he needed a suitable weapon. Swords and sabers definitely wouldn't work; they would likely be torn and snapped by Heavenly Light Qi. But the long-handled dark-gold hammer was probably fine. He didn't believe he couldn't smash his opponent to death with pure strength.

"Sure enough, another sleepless night." Qin Ming felt helpless. His spirit was still very vigorous. It wasn't until the latter half of the night that he took a brief nap. He estimated he wouldn't need to sleep for the next few days. In the latter half of the night, he studied the blade techniques, thoroughly dissecting the old man's experiences, insights, and understandings, then performing them in his own way, adding his flashes of inspiration and profound epiphanies.

The next day, Cao Long, Mu Qing, and Wei Zhirou told Qin Ming and the others that if they didn't find anything special or gain any more harvests in a few days, they would be returning. That day, they took out a Mid-grade Qi Cultivation Art and gave it to Qin Ming, Old Liu, and a few others as compensation, also allowing them to pass it on to people around them. The few people from Twin Tree Village were naturally extremely grateful. It was their first time encountering a Rebirth Method of this level. Mainly, they had indeed provided considerable help to the three teams. For example, the Fire Bat Cave allowed Mu Qing, Cao Long, and others to gain significant harvests.

That night, Qin Ming studied the Mid-grade Qi Cultivation Art and felt it was inferior to the method on the silk scroll he practiced. Moreover, this copy was transcribed hastily; it carried no strong emotions, making spiritual resonance impossible. "It seems it has to be the crystallized effort left by predecessors," he realized with new understanding.

In the evening, when Qin Ming brought the Mid-grade Qi Cultivation Art to Old Liu, he asked, "Old man, you wouldn't tell the three teams from Scarlet Cloud City about all the places with spiritual substances just to repay their kindness, would you?"

"Don't worry," Old Liu patted his chest and said, "This old man knows what he's doing. Once I've recovered from my injuries and you've undergone your second rebirth, when the great mountains are completely quiet, we'll go into the mountains together to find spiritual substances that can grant us a third rebirth. The best places are all still kept safe!"

Afterward, Qin Ming asked, "Old man, are there any sects or powerful families in our area that have a significant history but have completely fallen into decline?"

"Why do you ask that? What do you want to do?" Old Liu asked suspiciously.

Qin Ming said, "I want to borrow some books from them. Don't worry, I'll definitely offer them Night Silver that they can't refuse!"
