# Chapter 56: The Transaction

"Brother Gu, you misunderstand. How would we dare covet that minor spirit vein? If not for our supervision, those ignorant rogue cultivators would have already laid hands on it!" Clan Leader Deng hurriedly interjected to explain.

"No need for explanations. Take this command flag with you and place it at the Hao family ruins. At minimum, no one is to touch that minor spirit vein until the Ascension Assembly concludes. A Foundation Establishment uncle from our sect will arrive then to handle the matter." Gu Jia took out a flag bearing the characters for "Tian Hai" and placed it on the table, speaking gravely.

The four clan leaders exchanged helpless glances. They had indeed intended to claim that minor spirit vein for themselves.

But after seeing the shattered formation disk, they didn't dare act rashly, hence their idea to involve Gu Jia.

Little did they expect Gu Jia planned to claim the entire spirit vein for himself. Their efforts had been in vain.

"Do you truly think a minor spirit vein would catch the eye of our sect's uncles? The vein will remain, but you'll need to offer some spirit stones. The uncle can't take on risks for you without compensation," Gu Jia waved his hand dismissively.

"We'll divide the spirit vein's benefits five ways," Clan Leader Liu said, glancing meaningfully at Li Shiming before trailing off.

Li Shiming understood the implication—this was to include an extra share for Gu Jia.

Regardless of how the spirit vein was used, Gu Jia would receive a portion of the profits without lifting a finger—all thanks to the Tian Hai Sect's backing.

Only Li Shiming knew there was no Foundation Establishment cultivator involved; Gu Jia was getting this share for free.

Of course, he wouldn't expose this truth—it was impossible to explain.

"Little friend Li, don't focus on petty gains. Once you join our sect and pass the trials to become a full disciple, with your abilities you could claim a cultivation site with a substandard spirit vein all to yourself," Gu Jia turned to Li Shiming.

This statement made the four clan leaders understand why Gu Jia valued Li Shiming so highly.

Their gazes toward Li Shiming now carried undisguised envy.

A substandard spirit vein might carry the label "substandard," but it was still a graded spirit vein—far superior to the ungraded minor veins they occupied as rogue cultivators.

Only a major sect like Tian Hai could provide such resources to its disciples.

Of course, becoming a full disciple of Tian Hai wasn't easy—it required both spiritual root qualifications and passing rigorous trials.

That Gu Jia was so confident in Li Shiming's success spoke volumes.

---

The four clan leaders' attitudes toward Li Shiming shifted noticeably. No longer just a junior under Gu Jia's protection, he was now someone worth cultivating deeper connections with.

Li Shiming was satisfied with this change. He didn't seek anything from the clan leaders—he simply wanted to quietly pass this period until he could successfully enter Tian Hai Sect during the Ascension Assembly.

The clan leaders then negotiated with Gu Jia about rogue cultivators entering the city. Only after agreeing to a series of conditions did Gu Jia relent, permitting rogue cultivators to reside long-term in a designated city district.

Two days later, the imperial examinations began. Over three days of testing, though Li Shiming didn't take it seriously, his mastery of knowledge and memories of historical essays from his past life gave him effortless advantage.

Results were posted ten days after the exams. Li Shiming couldn't be bothered to check—he'd been extremely busy lately.

Between daily cultivation of the "Five Elements Absorption Art," he studied spells and practiced talisman creation.

The deeper he delved into cultivation, the more he realized this world's civilization matched—even surpassed in many aspects—the technological world of his past life.

Take the "Revitalization Technique"—in his past life's medicine, treating external wounds, internal injuries, or illnesses required various specialized methods: surgery, medications, or extensive diagnostic equipment.

Here, a single "Revitalization Technique" could heal wounds, injuries, and sickness alike.

Of course, as a low-level spell, it worked wonders on mortals but could only treat minor injuries for cultivators—serious cases required stronger healing spells or elixirs.

This didn't render his past life's medicine useless. Its rigorous study of human physiology and pathology surpassed this world's approach.

Cultivation healing resembled mysticism, while his past life's medicine was grounded in systematic theory from fundamentals to treatment.

Even more mystical was the "Vanishing Technique." Upon mastering it, Li Shiming realized how helpless mortals were against cultivators.

Under this spell's effect, mortals couldn't even see cultivators, let alone oppose them.

Without means to counter the "Vanishing Technique," a cultivator was invincible in the mortal world—mortals wouldn't even know how they died.

No wonder Tian Hai Sect stationed Gu Jia in Da Xia. Without sect oversight, even a single rogue cultivator could wreak unimaginable havoc on the mortal world.

"Congratulations, young master, for placing as a Tribute Scholar!" Mo Yan's voice carried from the courtyard as he scurried to the main house.

"Siqin, give him two taels of silver to make him stop shouting," Li Shiming instructed his maid outside.

"Young master, becoming a Tribute Scholar is a grand occasion! According to household rules, everyone should receive rewards," Siqin reminded him with a smile.

"You handle it then. Just don't disturb me," Li Shiming waved dismissively.

Siqin knew of her master's cultivation pursuits. That he still excelled academically despite this pleased her greatly.

"Young master, the palace examination is in ten days—don't forget!" she added as a final reminder.

Li Shiming nodded. After the palace examination, his ties to the mortal world would likely fade.

Time flowed swiftly, and soon the palace examination arrived.

Under clear skies, a group of Tribute Scholars in Confucian robes were led by imperial guards to the Fengtian Hall.

These scholars represented Da Xia's finest talents cultivated over three years, each a genius among geniuses.

Yet Li Shiming stood out conspicuously among the mostly thirty-something scholars.

Near Fengtian Hall, he spotted a familiar figure—Gu Jia.

Gu Jia smiled at him, viewing his participation in the exams as mere youthful amusement. Not that Gu Jia looked down on this highest mortal academic honor—he simply didn't regard it at all.

Wielding power to effortlessly destroy mortals placed cultivators on an entirely different plane of existence.
