# Chapter 88: The Legend of Wulin

"You... how dare you act so arrogantly!" The Third Prince shouted indignantly upon hearing Zhou Qing's response.

Zhou Qing didn't reply and simply walked away.

The Jiangzhou garrison commander bowed obsequiously. "My lord, what should we do?"

"Send him to the Qinghe Prince's residence."

"Alive or...?"

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "What difference would it make if he's dead?"

Delight flashed in the garrison commander's eyes as he bowed deeply before turning away, his gaze turning murderous.

Returning to the courtyard, Zhou Qing was met with Lin Wan'er's anxious question: "How did it go?"

Zhou Qing: "This might be a trap."

Lin Wan'er: "Indeed. The imperial decree from the north is clearly trying to stir trouble and create discord between us and Elder Zhang."

Zhou Qing shook his head. "No, it seems more like they're trying to provoke us... wait—" His fingers tapped lightly on the table, producing crisp sounds. "This is a declaration of war."

After a pause, he asked Lin Wan'er: "What's the Third Prince's maternal background?"

"A palace maid from the Laundry Bureau—the lowest status. He's essentially a discarded pawn with no maternal clan support. To gain higher status, he could only take risks by coming to Jiangzhou to seek merit. But his fate was sealed the moment he set out." In an instant, Zhou Qing pieced together many things.

Despite the north-south divide, news of the Living Buddha's passing would have certainly reached the northern court. The imperial Martial Virtue Bureau had spies everywhere, far surpassing Zhou Qing's fledgling intelligence network in reach.

The Living Buddha's death had been known for months. The old eunuch must have guessed that the secret of the Formless Mind Technique had been exposed.

Minister Lu's only son remained in the capital, with no other family left. To Lu Fengxian, this son was more precious than life itself.

Out of gratitude, Zhou Qing was bound by duty to help Lu Fengxian rescue his son.

This obvious provocation was meant to enrage Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu. Regardless, having a prince die in Jiangzhou would paint Zhou Qing as a traitor in the eyes of the world. If Zhou Qing refused to repay his debt, his reputation would suffer even more.

But...

In this new era, what was the point of such petty schemes?

Lin Wan'er grasped the implication immediately. "They want to lure you north—it's a death trap."

"No, this marks the beginning of a new era."

"I've decided—I'll go to the capital, rescue the man, and retrieve the Formless Mind Technique..."

Zhou Qing had analyzed the situation clearly. By provoking him, the other side must have also considered the possibility of him refusing. If he didn't go, what was their backup plan?

---

Demonic creatures.

They were cultivating chaos through the turmoil.

Given the Martial Virtue Bureau's intelligence network, they had likely detected signs of demonic activity across the land. Of course, communication between north and south might be blocked, or the Bureau's capabilities might be overestimated. But after 150 years of rule, the Great Zhou Dynasty's knowledge of hidden affairs far surpassed Zhou Qing's.

Moreover, the emperor's obsession with alchemy and immortality meant he would pay special attention to such matters. The likelihood of the imperial family cultivating and controlling demonic creatures was high.

Regardless of the truth, Zhou Qing resolved to eliminate the threat posed by the old eunuch swiftly. He couldn't afford to have a powerful enemy constantly scheming against him.

Retrieving the Formless Mind Technique was also crucial for his senior brothers' full recovery. Delaying risked unforeseen complications.

Zhou Qing wrote a letter summoning Zhang Jingxiu to Qingfu Temple. He then officially assumed the governorship of Jiangzhou, overseeing Jiangzhou and Hushan Prefecture—stepping fully into the political arena.

---

A month passed swiftly. With his elixirs successfully refined and Zhang Jingxiu's arrival at Qingfu Temple, the four gathered in the main hall, each seated on a meditation cushion. With Zhou Qing's help, Fushan and Fusong regained clarity.

This was a council of four Transcendent experts.

Zhou Qing had already briefed Zhang Jingxiu on the demonic creatures, the old eunuch, and other details. The two elder Taoists had also been informed upon awakening.

All four clearly understood the current situation.

"Junior Brother, regarding the demonic creatures, I believe we should deal with them later. Years ago, that old eunuch lured me into facing the heavenly tribulation without mentioning the Formless Mind Technique—his intentions were sinister. Having such a formidable enemy constantly plotting against us is unacceptable. We must act decisively," Fushan said gravely.

"Agreed. We should eliminate the old eunuch first. After that, we'll dictate the course of events," Zhang Jingxiu added, his tone frustrated. The Tantric sect's shameless claim that the Living Buddha had achieved "rainbow body" attainment—despite Zhang personally admitting to killing him—had tarnished his reputation as the world's top martial artist.

He needed to vent his anger.

More importantly, as long as the old eunuch and emperor lived, the Taihe Sect would remain rebels in name. Their stance demanded action.

Zhou Qing looked to Fusong.

Fusong: "I concur."

Zhou Qing then produced the refined, albeit subpar, Qi Condensation Pills. "Let's divide and consume these pills together."

He distributed Zhang Jingxiu's portion first, then shared his own with the two elder Taoists. However, their weaker spiritual cultivation limited their ability to refine qi, forcing them to focus on physical enhancement through the pills.

---

Yet the recent turmoil had made him acutely aware of the power of sheer martial prowess.

Even so, he still preferred solving problems through schemes whenever possible.

After all, there were always greater powers beyond one's knowledge.

He felt uneasy about revealing his full capabilities, hence creating the identity of the Abbot of Fuhu Temple.

A palace eunuch would only bare his fangs at the final moment. Until then, even if seething with hatred, he would maintain a smiling facade.

Eunuchs were, by nature, the emperor's servants.

His current status had been painstakingly built over decades through subtle maneuvering.

Ultimately, eunuchs had no descendants.

In the old eunuch's heart, the emperor was his progeny.

Moreover, the current emperor held him in high esteem.

Unfortunately, the emperor lacked talent. Despite the old eunuch's guidance, he couldn't even touch the threshold of qi refinement.

"Once I obtain Master Jingyang's legacy—with enough Marrow-Cleansing and Qi Condensation Pills—His Majesty will surely achieve qi refinement. Together, with the empire's resources, we may even reach qi perfection."

---

"Uncle-Master, we've reached the capital."

"Rest tonight. Tomorrow is the full moon—we'll enter the Forbidden City then," Fusong said urgently upon awakening and confirming the date with Zhishan. He burned with hatred for the old eunuch's schemes against Fushan. His senior brother deserved justice.

"Not enter—we'll storm the Forbidden City," Zhang Jingxiu corrected, stroking his beard with a smile. He aimed to create a martial legend, especially after the humiliation of the Tantric Living Buddha incident.

Zhou Qing gazed calmly at the imperial palace. "We're merely burying a dynasty."

Tomorrow's sun would set, and another would rise thereafter.

After pacifying the north, they would march south to reunify the realm.

If the two southern Transcendents dared come north, it would be the perfect opportunity to eliminate them. Without such obstacles, reunifying the south would be far easier.

The Great Zhou's revival was within reach!

Moreover, the old eunuch had spoken of celestial fortune. Once he absorbed this fortune and refined the legendary Dragon-Ascension Pill, success would be assured.

The pill's key ingredient was the inner core of draconic creatures, which could only be found in forbidden depths of mountains and marshes.

After reunification, the Martial Virtue Bureau would scour the land for them.

Previously, local officials had often paid lip service to imperial decrees. Once order was restored, none would dare disobey.

With dreams of revival, the emperor bid the old eunuch farewell.

The old eunuch moved at speeds imperceptible to ordinary eyes, vanishing from the palace.

---

In the capital's Fuhu Temple, the abbot—with long white eyebrows and an immortal's demeanor—bore the old eunuch's visage.

"Scholar Tang."

"Greetings, Abbot."

"How fares the translation?"

"The general content is complete."

The abbot brightened. "Scholar Tang's talent is peerless. Even the imperial academics couldn't assist me in this matter."

Tang demurred, "The academics lacked knowledge of cultivation, and these texts involve obscure studies. My modest gift for ancient scripts merely allowed me to contribute."

The abbot smiled. "Your brilliance is undeniable. By next year at latest, I'll help you attempt the heavenly tribulation to reach Transcendence, matching that southern Scholar Zhou."

At Zhou's name, Tang paused before sighing. "My current state stems from arrogance—I dare not compare myself to others anymore. Translating these texts revealed how vast the world truly is."

The abbot gestured. "Please elaborate."

Tang continued, "The parchment I previously provided contained Master Jingyang's relics. This text is also his legacy, but its contents are astounding."

He paused. "Only at Transcendence's peak can one knock on the immortal gate and lay the foundation of the Dao."

As he detailed the contents, the abbot grew excited.

"So it's true! The path continues!"

"Demonic creatures herald spiritual revival."

"Originally suppressed by formations that siphoned the world's spiritual energy, their resurgence means the formations are breaking."

"Master Jingyang spent his life repairing these formations, delaying the demonic calamity by centuries."

Tang's explanation revealed that demonic creatures were hybrids of spirits and fiends—wood-attributed beings corrupted by demonic energy.

The demonic tree in the palace was one such entity.

The text also mentioned the "Evergreen Immortality Art" and "Five Organs Thunder Resonance."

"No wonder I couldn't fully control that tree—I lacked these techniques."

Despite mental invasions, the abbot had only achieved partial control over the tree.

Without Tang's genius, the text's secrets would have remained hidden.

Another crucial section detailed the Formless Mind Technique, of which the abbot had only deciphered the first two layers after years of effort.

This had elevated his spiritual power to the peak of the fourth qi-refinement layer, bordering on breakthrough.

With ample resources, he had reached the fourth layer in qi refinement and the second in body refinement long ago.

But body refinement progressed painfully slowly—he remained far from the third layer.

Alchemy's difficulty was the main obstacle.

Years ago, Fushan had shown talent in alchemy, but not being Transcendent limited his ability to refine high-grade pills.

A decade prior, a mysterious seal in the palace had cracked, releasing subterranean fire—superior even to a cultivator's innate flames (which required fifth-layer qi refinement).

This was a boon.

Had he discovered it earlier, he might have coerced Fushan into alchemical service. But fearing the Formless Mind Technique's exposure and Qingfu Temple's potential (having accidentally obtained the orthodox Evergreen Immortality Art), he had schemed with the previous Living Buddha to steal its mental cultivation method.

Yet despite his machinations, Qingfu Temple had still produced a prodigy like Zhou Qing.

"My decades-old wariness was justified—Qingfu Temple truly has fortune's favor. Had it not declined, it might have birthed multiple Transcendents."

Raised amidst palace intrigues, he always preferred schemes over force—reserving violence as a last resort.

But the recent turmoil had reaffirmed the supremacy of personal power.

Still, old habits died hard.

The world was vast, with always greater powers lurking.

Full exposure felt unsafe—hence his Fuhu Temple abbot persona.

A eunuch bared his fangs only at the end. Until then, smiles masked murderous intent.

As the emperor's servant, his status had been meticulously cultivated over decades.

Without descendants, he viewed the emperor as his heir.

And the current emperor revered him.

Yet despite his guidance, the emperor lacked the talent for qi refinement.

"With Master Jingyang's legacy—and sufficient pills—His Majesty may yet succeed. Together, we could achieve qi perfection through the empire's resources."

---

"Uncle-Master, we've reached the capital."

"Rest tonight. Tomorrow's full moon marks our assault on the Forbidden City," Fusong declared urgently, hating the old eunuch's schemes against Fushan.

"Not assault—we'll shatter it," Zhang Jingxiu corrected, eager to cement his legend after the Living Buddha debacle.

Zhou Qing gazed at the palace. "We're just burying a dynasty."

Tomorrow's sunset would herald a new dawn.

After pacifying the north, they'd march south to reunify the realm.

The two southern Transcendents' potential northern venture would be their demise. Without them, reunification would proceed unhindered.

The Great Zhou's revival beckoned!

The old eunuch had spoken of celestial fortune. Absorbing it and refining the Dragon-Ascension Pill (requiring a draconic core from forbidden lands) would ensure success.

Post-reunification, the Martial Virtue Bureau would secure the ingredients.

No more half-hearted obedience—the empire would heed his commands.

With revival dreams, the emperor departed.

The old eunuch vanished at inhuman speed.
