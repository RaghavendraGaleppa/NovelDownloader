**Chapter 29: Karma Brings Trouble**

Zhao Xuhe’s words plunged Lu Yang into an icy abyss.

He hadn't even visited Dragoncoil Island in this life, and the cultivation technique was something he'd memorized from his previous two lives. Yet, Dragoncoil Island had just disappeared? Because of so-called karma?

Because he had cultivated the "Nine Transformations Dragon Art" ahead of time, snatching the karmic link between it and Zhao Xuhe, Dragoncoil Island had thus vanished?
The karma of cultivation techniques, predestined opportunities.

So, this was Zhao Xuhe’s fated opportunity, and he couldn’t seize it or cultivate it, otherwise, his karma would immediately be deduced, and they would follow the clues directly to his doorstep?
After realizing this, Lu Yang laughed out of sheer fury.

What a disgusting world!
True Lord cultivators predict opportunities in advance, securing benefits for their disciples. If an unexpected turn occurs, they can even pinpoint the cause and set the deviated karma back on track.
In such circumstances, how could ordinary people ever rise?

They could only bow their heads and serve like cattle and horses!

Just like now, on the surface, only Zhao Xuhe had appeared, but in reality, the true mastermind was probably Zhao Xuhe's so-called "Master"!
Lu Yang was 100% certain that it must be a Foundation Establishment True Lord!
Looking up, Lu Yang recalled Daoist Hongyun from his previous life, as if he saw a pair of eyes looking down from the boundless sky above.

"...Why are you forcing me?"

Thinking of this, a surge of anger and viciousness welled up within Lu Yang. He then looked at Zhao Xuhe, a mocking arc on his lips.

Almost simultaneously, beside Zhao Xuhe, a person suddenly stepped out.

"Junior Brother, be careful!"

*Whoosh!*

A flash of sword light, and Zhao Xuhe felt his vision blur. By the time he could see clearly, his initial fury was instantly doused by a chill.

The person who had just stepped forward was a disciple who had also bowed under their "Master's" tutelage, having entered three years earlier than Zhao Xuhe. He had cultivated the "Dragon-Tiger Conjunction Great Pleasure Rhapsody of Yin-Yang" to the sixth level of Qi Condensation, peak mid-stage, and his True Qi had been refined to the fifth-grade limit. In terms of strength, he was much stronger than Zhao Xuhe.

However, now, that Senior Brother had vanished.
His flesh, bone, and blood were devoured clean by a scarlet divine light. In the blink of an eye, only an empty human skin slowly drifted down where he had stood.

The next second, a streak of spiritual light flew out from the human skin.

"Many thanks, Fellow Daoist, for liberating me."

Within the spiritual light, an illusory figure emerged, showing no anger at all from being instantly slain by Lu Yang's sword. In fact, it even carried a hint of relief.

Then, he looked at Zhao Xuhe.

"Junior Brother, before coming here, Master commented that my foundation was shallow, and my merit insufficient. Achieving Qi Condensation Perfection in this life would be difficult, and Foundation Establishment was utterly hopeless."

"I asked Master for guidance, and Master then ordered me to come with you and save your life at a crucial moment. You have accumulated merit over three lifetimes, and in the future, you have a 30% chance of achieving Foundation Establishment. Now that I have saved your life, the karma is set. If you achieve Foundation Establishment in the future, you must help my reincarnated body cultivate to attain the Dao."

As his voice faded, the spiritual light shot up into the sky.

Below, Lu Yang’s gaze grew even colder at the sight.

"...Using my hand to forge karma for his own disciple, to reincarnate? Is he so confident I can't cause trouble, trying to squeeze out my last bit of value?"

Lu Yang's gaze shifted, and he saw one Sacred Sect disciple after another stepping out beside Zhao Xuhe. All of them were at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, peak mid-stage cultivation.

At the same time, Zhao Xuhe finally reacted, his face beaming with excitement. He declared loudly, "All Senior Brothers, as long as you can help me capture this rogue today and reclaim my opportunity, if I achieve Foundation Establishment in the future, I will spare no effort to repay you, helping you all reincarnate and achieve Qi Condensation Perfection!"

At these words, everyone nodded in agreement.

"Junior Brother, rest assured."

"Opportunity belongs to the fated. This rogue unjustly stole your opportunity; his crime is unforgivable. With Master above, we will certainly help you capture this rogue!"

Lu Yang burst out laughing at their words, "Talk all you want, it still boils down to forceful snatching, doesn't it?"

"Stubborn and unyielding."

The leading Sacred Sect disciple shook his head and sneered, "My name is Lu Yuanchun. Since you refuse to surrender, don't blame me for being merciless."

As his voice fell, Lu Yuanchun chanted a spell. His aura surged to the seventh level of Qi Condensation, late-stage cultivation. He then conjured a golden treasure mirror, hanging it high in the sky, replacing the sun. Instantly, thousands of golden rays descended, sharper than blades, engulfing Lu Yang like a torrential downpour.

Lu Yang's eyebrows furrowed at the sight, and his figure vanished instantly.

Next, a sword light soared into the sky, splitting into thousands, darting left and right, yet it remained trapped within the golden light's embrace, forced to endure the golden rays directly.

"Master had long ago calculated that this rogue excels in sword arts. How could he not bestow a countermeasure?"

Lu Yuanchun smiled proudly at the sight, then looked at Zhao Xuhe, "Junior Brother Zhao, I have trapped this rogue, making it difficult for him to employ his sword arts' evasion techniques."

"Please, Junior Brother, activate your treasure seal and seize this rogue's flying sword, and the matter will be settled!"

"Many thanks, Senior Brother!"

Zhao Xuhe cupped his hands, then, without daring to delay, immediately took out a dazzling golden treasure seal and conjured it into the air, bringing it down towards Lu Yang's sword light.

"That thing again..."

Lu Yang's eyes flickered. He recognized it as the "Primordial Magnetic Gold Seal" that Zhao Xuhe had used in his second life, a magical artifact that countered flying swords.

With the lessons of his previous life, Lu Yang naturally wouldn't let Zhao Xuhe deploy it freely. With a thought, his Blood Sun Sword Core moved as he willed, not making contact with the Primordial Magnetic Gold Seal but instead evading it. Then, he twisted his sword light, transforming it into a sky-filling Blood Transformation Divine Light, sweeping towards Zhao Xuhe.

Zhao Xuhe was startled and immediately retreated in panic, crying out, "Senior Brother!"

"Don't panic, it's just the desperate struggle of a cornered beast."

On the other side, Lu Yuanchun remained calm, proclaiming, "All Junior Brothers, please make your move."

No sooner had he spoken than several other Sacred Sect disciples stepped out, their faces bearing eerie smiles. Without waiting for the divine light to fall, they surprisingly committed suicide.

In an instant, streaks of blood light bloomed from their corpses.

These blood lights resembled chains, temporarily trapping Lu Yang's Blood Transformation Divine Light, making it difficult to retract and causing his mental control to feel sluggish.

Zhao Xuhe and Lu Yuanchun were clearly well-prepared.
Especially Lu Yuanchun, who had received secret instructions from his Master before coming, learning many of Lu Yang's secrets, and thus had prepared many countermeasures.

So, before the battle, he had set a strategy: first, restrict Lu Yang's speed to ensure he couldn't escape, then have Zhao Xuhe suppress his Sword Core, and finally, have the accompanying Junior Brothers jointly suppress the Blood Transformation Divine Light. No matter how powerful Lu Yang's divine abilities were, he would be like a lamb awaiting slaughter.

"At the end of his rope, the situation is decided!"

Lu Yuanchun sneered, feeling his chances of victory greatly increased. He immediately shook the golden treasure mirror, and thousands of golden rays followed, intent on refining Lu Yang to death.

Lu Yang could only sigh at the sight.

"This is the advantage of having a powerful background..."

With his current strength, even against multiple opponents, Lu Yuanchun, Zhao Xuhe, and their ilk were no match for him. However, the opponents' preparations were simply too thorough.
Every move struck his weak points.

And all of this was because of Zhao Xuhe's mysterious "Master," who deduced karma and divined fate, leading to such a targeted arrangement.

Normally, at this point, he would indeed be powerless to turn the tide.

"Fortunately... I have a cheat!"

The Blood Sun Sword Core was brought to him by the [Book of Hundred Lifetimes] from his previous life. It did not enter the karmic cycle and naturally feared no deductions.
Even if Zhao Xuhe's mysterious "Master" could deduce his proficiency in sword arts and his Blood Transformation Divine Light, he could absolutely not deduce the true nature of the Blood Sun Sword Core!

The next second, Lu Yang's mind stirred, and his True Qi surged again.

*Clang! Clang!*

The Blood Sun Sword Core let out a resounding cry. Then, the array patterns on the sword core suddenly exploded, locking down heaven and earth, sealing the cosmos, and instantly encompassing everyone within!
In less than a blink of an eye, Lu Yang had deployed the grand array he had spent twenty years refining in his previous life!
