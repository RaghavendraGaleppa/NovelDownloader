## Chapter 4: Eye Disease

"What's wrong with Little Four? He was fine, but now his eye disease has flared up again," Li Chunu said, cradling Li Zhiming in her arms, her face filled with worry. Her husband, Li Ershi, stood behind her, rubbing his hands together, looking embarrassed. The small courtyard of their mountain village was filled with concern.

Li Zhiming was in too much pain to open his eyes, tears streaming down his face.

"Should we take him to see Niu Dafei?" Li Chunu asked, but Zhangshi, her mother-in-law, scolded her, "Niu Dafei is not someone to be seen casually."

The village didn't have a proper doctor; Niu Dafei, who lived in a cow shed on the outskirts of the village, was an unlicensed healer. He only had a basic understanding of herbalism and mostly prescribed charms and potions. Even the villagers, who were not well-educated, were skeptical of his abilities.

"Let's just bring him inside to rest," Zhangshi suggested.

As Li Zhiming's parents talked, his pain slowly subsided, but he was still dizzy and fell asleep again.

When he woke up, the room was bright, and a girl about 14 or 15 years old was lying on the bed, sewing a shoe that had cracked open the night before. She was wearing a simple white undergarment, and her body was thin like a skeleton. Her skin had a wheat-like complexion but was pale from lack of sunlight.

Li Zhiming blinked his eyes, feeling that they no longer hurt.

The sunlight shone on the mud wall, illuminating the cracks and an ant crawling on it.

"Little Four, you're awake. How are your eyes? Do they still hurt?" The girl turned to him, smiling. Her face wasn't beautiful, but her white teeth sparkled.

Li Zhiming blinked again, feeling a sense of comfort with his second sister.

"Second sister, I don't hurt anymore!" he said.

"That's good. Your father was worried sick about you. You should go eat some vegetable soup," she said.

As Li Zhiming looked at his second sister, another line appeared above her head:

Black, Life Grid [命克二夫] (Life Grid: Kills Two Husbands)

A new line appeared below it, which Li Zhiming was sure had not been there before:

Skills:裁衣纳履2级 (Tailoring and Shoemaking Level 2): You have a basic understanding of sewing clothes and shoes...

Li Zhiming was intrigued but didn't say anything. He just looked at his second sister, and the line didn't disappear.

"What's wrong? Why are you staring at me?" his second sister asked, smiling.

"Nothing, I just want to make money for you when I grow up and make you marry well," Li Zhiming said.

His second sister blushed, touched by his words, and quickly looked away, wiping away a tear.

"You'll be big and I'll be married already," she said, her voice tinged with melancholy.

Li Zhiming didn't understand the sadness. He thought that命克二夫 (Kills Two Husbands) wasn't a bad thing. He didn't see what was wrong with it.

As he watched his second sister, he focused on the line above her head. After a while, he felt a stream of information flow into his body.

When he ran out of the room, he looked up and saw:

Li Zhiming, black, [Life Grid: 十四早夭] (Life Grid: Dies at 14)

Skills:裁衣纳履2级 (Tailoring and Shoemaking Level 2)

He felt a strange sensation, as if he had acquired his second sister's skill.

He ran to the yard, opened a water缸, and scooped out a dipper of water. He squatted by the water沟 and brushed his teeth with a tree branch.

After a while, Zhangshi returned, sweating, and asked, "Little Four, are your eyes better?"

"Yes, I'm fine," Li Zhiming replied, running into the house to grab a bowl of vegetable soup.

"Where's Father?" he asked.

"He's working in the field with your brother," Zhangshi replied.

Li Zhiming ran out of the house, eager to help. Zhangshi called out, "Go, but don't run so fast! You're not a dog!"
