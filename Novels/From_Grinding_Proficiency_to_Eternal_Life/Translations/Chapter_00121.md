Chapter 121: Three Hundred Mid-Grade Mortal Weapons

The moment the red-hot sword blank was plunged into the cold spring, Xu Yunfan suddenly twisted his wrist and shook the hammer. The micro-serration produced by the Gold-Splitting, Jade-Cutting special effect gradually appeared amidst the sparks, and the blade edge actually formed fish-scale-like quenching patterns on its own.

"Success!"

Using tongs, he pulled the long sword out of the quenching pool and turned to place it into the cooling pool.

As steam rose, a long sword emitting a cold light let out a melodious hum that echoed for a long time.

*You have successfully forged a mid-grade mortal sword. Your Forging proficiency has increased.*

*You have successfully forged a mid-grade mortal sword. Your Heavenly Craftsmanship Forging Art proficiency has increased.*

Looking at the two lines of prompt information floating in his vision, Xu Yunfan let out a breath.

He glanced at the bright, lustrous fine steel sword in his hand and casually tossed it to the side.

With a clanging sound, Xu Yunfan took another piece of red-hot fine steel ingot from the quenching pool. He swung his hammer, and rain-like blows fell.

For a time, the sound of clanging filled the entire forging platform above the Thunderfire Pool.

Three days later, Xu Yunfan, whose eyes were bloodshot after working non-stop for three days and nights, finally delivered the three hundred fine steel long swords ahead of schedule.

A disciple of the Heavenly Cavern Hall who was inspecting the goods took one of the fine steel long swords and tested it. He then pressed the sword body against an elm anvil, bending the three-finger-wide blade into a terrifying arc.

When the spine of the sword almost touched the hilt, he suddenly let go.

The fine steel sword rang with a *zheng* sound, snapping back straight. The blade edge actually cut half an inch deep into the elm wood.

"The seventh one."

The voice of the Casting Hall steward in charge of the record was somewhat dazed. He looked at Xu Yunfan with suspicion.

Such technique could be called a master even within the Casting Hall.

In the past, disciples of the Heavenly Cavern Hall's Casting Hall would spend three years pulling the bellows, another three years hammering iron ingots, and only then would they start handling some parts needed by the Mechanism Hall. Only after mastering the forging hammer to perfection would they begin formally forging weapons.

Even this steward himself had to endure nearly twenty years before his promotion. He started at eight, began pulling the bellows at sixteen, and became a steward in his thirties, with his martial arts reaching the level of a First-Rank Martial Teacher.

Without comparing himself to Xu Yunfan, he could stand tall and proud just by saying all this.

A Casting Hall steward was capable of forging upper-grade mortal weapons.

"Senior Brother Xu, have you really never forged a weapon before?"

The Casting Hall steward couldn't help but ask.

"Naturally. My master only taught me the forging technique three days ago. This is basically me submitting my homework."

The steward looked at the six test swords laid out on the table before him. Some had indentations from being struck by a hammer but were not broken. Some only had half a fold on the edge after劈ing through seven layers of wrought iron armor. Most surprisingly, the one soaked in quenching oil could still cut through a horse's tail.

The disciple inspecting the goods suddenly ran his fingers along the blade edge. He felt a subtle serrated sensation on his fingertip.

His pupils trembled slightly. He took a piece of green ridge rock used for testing swords and slashed across it.

Cold light flashed, and the test rock split in two with a crisp sound. The cross-section was as smooth as a mirror; the unique micro-serration structure was at work.

"The Gold-Splitting, Jade-Cutting method of the Heavenly Craftsmanship Forging Art."

The disciple inspecting the goods rubbed the edge of the sword with his fingers. The slight serration not only improved toughness but also enhanced sharpness.

In the sixteen prefectures of Yanbei Dao, only the Heavenly Craftsmanship Forging Art of the Heavenly Cavern Hall could produce such a weapon.

"Three hundred swords, the quenching纹 error is no thicker than a strand of hair," the inspecting disciple reported, his Adam's apple bobbing. He suddenly stacked the seven swords on the iron anvil and struck them hard with a hammer. Seven clear, resonant sword hums actually formed a complete musical scale!

The Casting Hall suddenly fell into dead silence.

Everyone understood what this meant. The material density and internal structure of the three hundred swords were almost completely identical. Even a master smith with thirty years of experience would need half a year to gather seven swords that could produce the same note.

This could only be achieved by controlling one's strength to a miraculous degree, combining hardness and softness, and ensuring every hammer blow was nearly identical.

"All three hundred are top-grade! All are of mid-grade mortal weapon quality!"

The recording disciple of the Casting Hall shouted at the top of his lungs.

By the time the steward wanted to find Xu Yunfan to sign for confirmation, Xu Yunfan had already returned to his courtyard.

Besides forging weapons during those three days and nights, he had done nothing else. After returning, Xu Yunfan naturally practiced the Hand Seal of Lin for a while.

Two hours later, Xu Yunfan opened his eyes.

His originally bloodshot eyes were now black and white, clear and distinct. A single glance made the room seem brighter.

Although he was mentally refreshed, Xu Yunfan still felt a bit drowsy. Since he wasn't in combat or outdoors, he naturally wouldn't force himself and immediately lay down to sleep.

It wasn't until the sun was high the next day that Xu Yunfan woke up. After eating the meal brought by the Casting Hall disciples, he began practicing the Cicada Strength Art in the courtyard.

He had already wasted three days, so he couldn't let the Cicada Strength Art fall behind. Forging was a side job. Since the Heavenly Craftsmanship Forging Art had been initiated, he naturally needed to focus on perfecting Bone Refining.

As his bones trembled, if someone were to get close, they could clearly hear the faint sounds of cicadas coming from inside Xu Yunfan's body.

Time passed. Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged on the bluestone slabs of the newly renovated courtyard in the Heavenly Craftsmanship Department of the Heavenly Cavern Hall. The setting sun cast his shadow long over the weapon rack.

As the Cicada Strength Art circulated, wisps of blood energy, under the writhing of his muscles and tendons, continuously seeped into his bones. The two hundred and six bones throughout his body began to vibrate at different frequencies. His skull sounded like a chime, his ribs like a bell, and his spine like a dragon's chant.

*You forcefully condensed your blood energy into threads, slowly seeping them into your bones along the fascia meridians. Your bone toughness seems to be increasing, and your Cicada Strength Art proficiency has increased!*

*...*

*Hum!*

When the first cicada sound erupted from his tailbone, it was clearly audible within the courtyard. The vibration caused fine ripples to appear on the surface of a water jar three zhang away.

Xu Yunfan clearly felt as if millions of ants were gnawing inside his kneecap. This was the sign of his bone membrane transforming amidst the vibration as his proficiency continued to rise.

He had discovered a few days ago while practicing the Cicada Strength Art that since perfecting Skin and Muscle Refining, his body's blood energy had become so abundant that even his Senior Brother Fu Jin found it exaggerated.

With the blood energy soaking into his bones, the progress of Bone Refining was accelerating even more.

He wouldn't even need half a year; at most four months, and he would reach the perfection of Bone Refining.

*Crack!*

The bluestone slab beneath him suddenly cracked with spiderweb-like patterns.

Xu Yunfan suddenly realized that the resonance of his entire skeleton had broken through a certain critical point. The vibration frequency of his scapula and clavula suddenly doubled.

The summer cicadas on the distant treetops seemed to be summoned, their chirping forming a marvelous harmony with the bone鸣 inside his body.

The Cicada Strength Art circulated repeatedly. When the seventh cycle of bone鸣 began, a faint jade luster actually started to appear on his bones.

Too much of a good thing is bad.

If he continued practicing, the jade luster on his bones would likely turn into bone fractures in the next moment. The loss would outweigh the gain.

He suddenly stood up and grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer beside him.

Inspired by a sudden thought, the moment he gripped the hammer handle in reverse, the mechanism at the end of the handle moved slightly. The high-frequency vibration unique to the Cicada Strength Art actually resonated with the meteorite spring inside the hammer!

*Boom!*

The hammer head slammed heavily into the ground, but not a single sound was made.
