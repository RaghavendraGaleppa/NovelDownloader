# Chapter 70: He Arrived in a Hurry

The Canglang Gorge lived up to its name; the cliffs on both sides looked as if they had been carved by an axe.

It had split the loess plateau asunder, cleaving a gaping wound into the spine of the green mountains.

The valley was long and deep, and the wind howled through the gorge with a ferocity far greater than that outside.

More than a hundred household soldiers from Feng'an Manor were already lying in ambush on both sides of the gorge.

In the slack farming season, hunting was a common way for them to supplement their family income.

During this time, they had not only honed their archery skills but had also mastered many techniques for concealing their tracks and setting traps.

Now, all the methods used to deal with agile wild beasts were being brought into play.

Zhao Laosan clung to a protruding rock on the cliff face like a gecko.

He was dozens of zhang high from the ground, and the outcrop was barely wide enough for a single foot.

Yet, he held fast, his fingers gripping the rock crevices with steady strength.

From this vantage point, he could see any movement outside the gorge at the first moment.

He stayed there, his eyes fixed on the gorge entrance like a hawk or a falcon.

More than a hundred household soldiers were lying in ambush on the cliffs on both sides. They held hunting bows, choppers, lassoes, and piles of stones still caked with dirt.

"They're coming!"

Zhao Laosan's eyes suddenly lit up. He let out a sharp whistle and quickly moved away.

At the mouth of the gorge, more than twenty riders escorting eight large carts slowly made their way inside.

Once they passed this mountain pass, they would enter the territory of a Xianbei tribe.

Their hearts finally relaxed.

"Wait!" The leader of the riders suddenly reined in his horse, a vague sense of unease rising in his heart.

The household soldiers had designed many traps and mechanisms to catch wild beasts using materials they found on the spot.

However, their methods were so clever that they could fool even wild beasts, naturally leaving no obvious flaws.

Yet, this leader had an inexplicable feeling of unease.

"Boss, is something wrong?" A rider urged his horse closer and asked in a low voice.

The leader did not answer but stared intently at a particularly narrow and shadowy section of the path ahead. His right hand slowly began to grip the hilt of the sword at his waist.

On the cliff top, Kang Zhengyang knew it was time to wait no longer.

"Attack!"

He shouted sharply. Beside him, Kang Zhengyi immediately pushed a huge boulder down.

Kang Zhengyang also drew his hunting bow, aiming at that leader.

"Rumble..."

"Crash..."

Boulders, large and small, mixed with sand and mud, rained down from the cliffs on both sides.

At the front of the gorge, several large trees with canopies like clouds slowly toppled over.

With a thunderous crash, the dense foliage completely blocked the mountain path.

Some of the boulders piled on the cliffs were propped up with wooden poles. As long as a pole was pried with a steel fork, a large pile of stones would come crashing down like hail, with a sound like a landslide.

"Ambush! Scatter! Protect the goods!" the rider leader shouted. Fortunately, he had turned his body to shout, so he avoided a fatal wound to his throat.

Kang Zhengyang's arrow only struck his shoulder.

The leader reacted quickly, rolling off his horse and dodging the second arrow that followed.

The gorge was too narrow, only wide enough for two carriages to pass abreast. In such a narrow space, they could not effectively scatter, but the stones and arrows from above could pour down freely.

These escorts of mountain goods were far more skilled than the household soldiers, but unfortunately, their prowess had no chance to shine.

No matter how fast their movements, they could not outrun the rumbling, roaring boulders, much less the mechanical force of the bows.

One rider was crushed by a boulder, falling to the ground with his horse.

A carriage was struck by a large stone, shattering the vehicle and scattering the agricultural produce inside all over the ground.

Another carriage had its wheel hit by a rolling stone, breaking five spokes and getting stuck.

The horse pulling it, terrified, neighed and tried to flee, but could only spin in place.

The mountain goods escorts reacted nimbly. The survivors quickly pressed themselves against the base of the cliffs on both sides, hoping to avoid the rolling stones and arrows.

But then, those damned household soldiers threw down basket after basket woven from rattan.

The baskets bounced like balls, smashing the beehives inside to pieces.

These were nests of hornets, wasps, and tiger-headed wasps that the household soldiers had found in the valley. They had carefully harvested them, woven rattan baskets on the spot, and placed the nests inside.

As soon as these were thrown out, the damaged hives released the enraged swarms, which stung anyone they saw.

"Ah, ah~ ah~~"

The men, who had been hiding under the cliffs and had avoided the stones and arrows, had barely caught their breath before the swarms arrived. Those who were stung covered their faces with their hands and screamed in agony.

They wanted to flee forward, but more stones and arrows were falling from the sky.

Although the cliffs on both sides were steep, there were gentle slopes leading up. The survivors had no choice but to charge up from here.

However, on this short stretch of mountain path, lassoes, pit traps, wooden arrows tensioned between branches, and crude, spiked collision boards began to take effect.

These mountain goods escorts were men who had seen their share of the world, but this time, it was like a butcher slipping and being gored by a pig.

There were only about twenty of them in total. After being ambushed by over a hundred men with their carefully prepared tricks, they suffered heavy losses immediately.

By the time Kang Zhengyang's long-range attacks were exhausted, only a handful of men were left standing, able to hold a sword, and they were all wounded.

"Kill!"

Kang Zhengyang raised his sword and, with Kang Zhengyi who was holding a steel fork, charged down first.

The household soldiers on both mountains responded in unison and also rushed out.

The battle devolved into close-quarters combat, and the household soldiers fought with military discipline. They formed groups of three to five, combining long weapons, short weapons, ranged weapons, and even rattan shields in seamless coordination.

Leveraging their ability to fight in concert, though their individual martial skills were inferior to their opponents, they displayed formidable combat effectiveness.

Bamboo spears thrust, choppers hacked, ropes lassoed, shields blocked, and arrows shot from hiding...

Only five or six enemies remained. How could they fight?

As they fell one by one, they only managed to kill one household soldier.

This was only because that soldier had stepped on a loose stone and fallen right beside them.

"Check for anyone still breathing. Kill them all!" Kang Zhengyang commanded sharply, leaning on his sword after the fierce slaughter.

The household soldiers, without needing to be told, were already searching for survivors. Anyone who had been hit by a rolling stone or an arrow and was still breathing, upon being seen, was immediately finished off with a slash.

Li Quanxin walked panting to a carriage covered with oiled canvas. This was the one whose wheel had been smashed, its spokes broken, stuck in place.

He didn't cut the ropes; this finger-thick hemp rope was good stuff only if kept whole.

Li Quanxin scraped the blood off his hunting knife on the sole of his shoe, stuck it back in his belt, and untied the ropes with his bare hands. Then, excitedly, he pulled back the oiled canvas...

What greeted his eyes was neither silk brocades nor gold and silver jewelry. What were these things?

At a single glance, Li Quanxin's eyes widened.

As a hunter, he completely couldn't identify what was on the cart.

"Company Commander, Company Commander, come quickly! Look what this cart is carrying!"

Kang Zhengyang was standing not far away. Hearing the call, he walked over, sword in hand.

"Company Commander, look quickly, what is this stuff on the cart?"

Kang Zhengyang walked to the front of the carriage and looked inside.

Seeing the neatly stacked, bundled-up pieces, Kang Zhengyang was puzzled at first.

Suddenly, he realized something, and his face fell dramatically.

"Company Commander, what is this thi..."

Before Li Quanxin could finish, Kang Zhengyang swiftly covered it back up with the canvas.

A few household soldiers who had just finished checking the area and found no more survivors were about to come over to look when they saw Kang Zhengyang's extremely grim expression.

A chill shot straight from the base of Kang Zhengyang's spine to the top of his head.

All the hair on his body stood on end.

He knew that this time, he had probably provoked a terrifying figure absolutely beyond his reach.

Kang Zhengyang was a man of experience.

He had a set of tattered armor bestowed upon his father by the Yu family, which he treated as a treasure. He usually only took it out for maintenance and was unwilling to wear it.

He had now recognized that the cart was full of armor.

The hunter Li Quanxin hadn't recognized it because the armor was all disassembled parts.

Most of the armor on these carts was "Liangdang" armor, a type of cavalry armor. There were also a few sets of more ornate "Mingguang" armor worn by generals.

Disassembling the armor into parts allowed for more efficient use of the carriage's loading space.

Kang Zhengyang estimated, using his own set of armor as a reference, that these four carts contained nearly one hundred sets of armor.

This was a hundred sets!

In this era, swords and spears were not forbidden, and even bows and arrows were not strictly prohibited. However, armor and crossbows were things that any ruler strictly forbade the common people to possess.

This was simply because armor and powerful crossbows had too great an effect on the battlefield and too obviously enhanced combat effectiveness.

Although the Eight Warlords of Longshang acted independently and were not a unified nation, their attitude toward the control of armor and crossbows was highly consistent.

In their domains, any commoner who secretly possessed or sold armor and crossbows would be executed upon discovery!

And these mountain goods escorts had smuggled nearly one hundred sets of armor in a single trip.

A hundred sets of armor could equip at least five hundred common cavalrymen. More importantly, armored cavalry could easily tear through the formations of unarmored cavalry with a charge.

The effect of such a force on a battle could not be measured by a simple ratio.

As long as one possessed two hundred elite armored cavalry, it would be enough to influence the outcome of a medium-sized battle.

If any of the Eight Warlords of Longshang discovered such a large-scale armor transaction in their own territory, they would investigate it with the utmost seriousness.

Otherwise, even they would feel uneasy.

What terrified Kang Zhengyang was, what kind of person had the ability to conduct such a massive armor transaction?

How could he, a mere household soldier commander of a manor, possibly contend with such a person's power?

Yes, he could report this to the Warlord, and the Warlord would certainly take it seriously. But would the Warlord send people to protect him constantly?

Someone who could trade a hundred sets of cavalry armor would find it no trouble at all to kill him quietly.

Such a powerful enemy, and hidden in the shadows at that—he was dead for sure!

Kang Zhengyang stood dumbly before the carriage, his mind in a turmoil.

Just then, a sudden, rapid sound of hoofbeats reached his ears.

Kang Zhengyang couldn't help but shudder violently.

He looked up sharply to see Yang Can and Bao Zitou leading seven or eight guard martial artists, galloping furiously into the valley.

Kang Zhengyang watched them, like a little lamb that had fallen into a pit, watching another little lamb come bouncing and skipping straight towards the trap...
