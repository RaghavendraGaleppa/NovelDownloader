# Chapter 82: Junior Brother, Keep This Quiet  

Not far from Misty Isle, on a deserted island.  

Streaks of crimson, scorching spells intertwined with jade-green, ethereal magic. Violent spiritual fluctuations continuously spread in all directions, kicking up clouds of dust.  

After about half an hour,  

Everything returned to calm.  

At the center of the battlefield,  

The once-lush vegetation had been completely stripped away, leaving only pockmarked brown earth.  

Two youthful figures sat cross-legged.  

They were none other than Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing.  

At this moment,  

A lingering look of astonishment remained on Chen Xiandao's face as he stared blankly at the slender figure before him.  

"Fairy Shen has already quietly reached the seventh level of Qi Refinement?!"  

"Qingqing merely got lucky. Brother Chen is only half a step away from the seventh level, isn't he?" Shen Qingqing smiled reassuringly.  

"One step behind, always behind! That half-step will take me at least another month."  

Chen Xiandao shook his head with a sigh.  

"By the way," he suddenly remembered the purpose of his visit and turned to Shen Qingqing, asking, "Fairy Shen must have been in contact with the senior brothers of the Inner Court recently. Have you decided which pavilion to join after coming out of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven? The Artifice Pavilion, the Surveillance Pavilion, or the Heritage Pavilion?"  

A trace of curiosity flashed in his eyes.  

"What about you, Brother Chen?" Shen Qingqing countered.  

"Me?"  

Hearing this, Chen Xiandao hesitated briefly before firmly stating, "I don't want to join any of those three. To be honest with Fairy Shen, I want to try for the Spiritual Dao Pavilion."  

Shen Qingqing let out a soft sound of surprise, then said,  

"The Spiritual Dao Pavilion, which oversees mission assignments and all matters related to Dao Merit?"  

Opposite her,  

Noticing the expression on Shen Qingqing's face,  

Chen Xiandao's eyes lit up with realization as he smiled and said, "It seems Fairy Shen and I are of the same mind."  

"The Spiritual Dao and Thousand Techniques Pavilions hold transcendent status. Naturally, we should strive for them if given the chance."  

Shen Qingqing's expression remained unchanged.  

"Indeed. It's just a pity that the senior brothers of the Spiritual Dao Pavilion didn't extend a direct invitation. They want to see our performance in the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven first."  

"As expected of one of the top two pavilions in the Inner Court!"  

A bright, fervent light suddenly flashed in Chen Xiandao's eyes.  

A look of yearning appeared on Shen Qingqing's face.  

At this point,  

An image of another youthful figure involuntarily surfaced in her mind.  

After a moment's thought,  

Shen Qingqing looked directly at Chen Xiandao and asked, "Brother Chen, do you still remember Brother Zhang Jing?"  

As soon as the words fell,  

Chen Xiandao was momentarily stunned before recalling something, a faint smile tugging at his lips.  

"Brother Zhang? Of course, I remember! That time he used a magical shield to smack a fairy in the face—I still remember it vividly."  

"Isn't he with the Luodu Squad? Why does Fairy Shen suddenly bring him up? Could it be that you miss him?"  

A slightly mischievous expression appeared on Chen Xiandao's face.  

"What nonsense!" Shen Qingqing huffed indignantly.  

"I'm saying that while we're here struggling to get into the Spiritual Dao Pavilion, Brother Zhang will probably waltz right into the Thousand Techniques Pavilion, another of the top two pavilions."  

"Why?" Chen Xiandao asked, puzzled.  

"You don't know?"  

Now it was Shen Qingqing's turn to be surprised.  

Her beautiful eyes widened. "The 'Plague God' from Langya County—that's Brother Zhang. Really? There are still people who don't know this?"  

"'Plague God' is Brother Zhang?!"  

Chen Xiandao's expression froze.  

During that time, he had been outside hunting demons to train himself.  

Though he had heard the title 'Plague God' many times on the battlefield, how could he have imagined it referred to Zhang Jing? He had assumed it was some senior brother.  

Only now did he fully grasp the meaning behind Shen Qingqing's words.  

"Well, with his talent for talisman-making, once he reaches the tenth level of Qi Refinement, the senior brothers of the Thousand Techniques Pavilion will likely invite him personally."  

"It's just a shame that the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven will open soon. Otherwise—"  

"Otherwise what, Senior Brother?"  

Zhang Jing looked at Senior Brother Li, who stood before him dumbfounded, a trace of amusement flashing in his eyes.  

Huff—  

The quiet room was suddenly filled with heavy breathing.  

For someone of Senior Brother Li's cultivation level to lose control of his breathing—  

Such an unbelievable scene was unfolding right before Zhang Jing's eyes.  

Seeing that Senior Brother Li seemed somewhat flustered,  

Zhang Jing quickly lowered his head, eyes fixed on his nose, nose fixed on his heart, not uttering a word. Even his breathing became nearly imperceptible.  

An unknown amount of time passed.  

Gradually regaining his composure, Senior Brother Li swiftly controlled his expression, suppressing his excitement as he smiled at Zhang Jing. "Apologies for letting you see that, Junior Brother."  

"This junior saw nothing. There's nothing to apologize for."  

Zhang Jing replied with lowered brows.  

Seeing this,  

Senior Brother Li couldn't help but nod in satisfaction.  

This junior brother was becoming more and more pleasing to his eyes.  

Extremely high talent, virtuous character—truly a gift from the heavens to the Luodu Squad!  

A top-grade cultivation method, supreme compatibility!  

Either of these alone would be extraordinary, let alone both appearing in one person.  

And within one chi!  

He had never even heard of such a thing before.  

This level of compatibility was enough to bridge the gap between Zhang Jing and those with A-grade cultivation talent! In other words, was there even any difference between him and an A-grade prodigy now?  

An undisputed A-grade genius!  

Ah, right—Junior Brother Zhang Yangchu!  

Senior Brother Li suddenly remembered the junior brother who had recruited Zhang Jing and silently resolved to reward him generously upon his return.  

That kid had unwittingly brought back a major powerhouse!  

Returning to the present,  

Senior Brother Li gazed at Zhang Jing with fervent eyes:  

"Junior Brother, regarding the matter of the top-grade cultivation method, please keep it quiet for now. Also, I expect you'll soon break through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement."  

"Once you break through, come find me immediately. At that point, Water Essence Pills will no longer be suitable for your cultivation. I'll provide you with higher-grade spirit pills."  

"Understood, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing nodded in agreement.  

Though he didn't understand why Senior Brother Li wanted him to keep it quiet, he didn't ask further.  

After all, he wasn't one to boast by nature.  

Keeping a low profile suited him just fine.  

As for the higher-grade spirit pills Senior Brother Li mentioned—  

Zhang Jing had to admit he was looking forward to them.  

Not long after,  

Carrying a full nine bottles of Water Essence Pills, Zhang Jing left Luodu Tower with a satisfied smile.  

Shortly after his departure,  

Inside the quiet room,  

A communication talisman suddenly appeared in Senior Brother Li's hand as he rapidly channeled spiritual energy into it.  

Senior Brother Xie Yu's divine sense immediately transmitted through the talisman:  

"Junior Brother, have you confirmed it?"  

"Senior Brother, I've already confirmed with Junior Brother Zhang Jing. The 'Ocean-Subduing Dragon Seizing Void True Method'—supreme compatibility, within one chi!"  

"Within one chi?!"  

Senior Brother Xie Yu's divine sense fluctuated violently.  

The communication talisman began emitting a series of cracking sounds as if it might shatter at any moment.  

A moment later,  

The divine sense flickered urgently:  

"Junior Brother, monitor Junior Brother Zhang Jing's cultivation progress closely."  

"If what he says is true, he should reach the seventh level of Qi Refinement within a month and a half at most."  

"Come to me directly to collect the Essence of Primordial Water... No, I'll bring the Essence of Primordial Water to you personally and meet him myself."  

As soon as Senior Brother Xie Yu finished speaking,  

The communication talisman in Senior Brother Li's hand exploded with a bang, scattering fragments everywhere.  

Meanwhile,  

Senior Brother Xie Yu put away his own communication talisman, a thoughtful expression on his face.  

The 'Ocean-Subduing Dragon Seizing Void True Method,' according to records, corresponds to the Moonlight Dragon Serpent Dao Intent within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.  

Compatibility within one chi—  

Junior Brother Zhang Jing would likely gain some comprehension of it, perhaps even laying the foundation for a superior Dao in the future.  

Provided, of course, that he wasn't lying!  

Add to that Junior Brother Chen Xiandao, whom he was currently courting—  

If he could seize this opportunity, perhaps in a hundred years, the Heritage Pavilion could rise to become one of the 'Top Three Pavilions.'  

With such merit to his name,  

His chances of reaching the Golden Core Divine Ability Realm in the future would greatly increase.  

As for the Pavilion Master's earlier suggestion of entering the True Spirit Ranking and ascending to the Upper Realm—  

Senior Brother Xie Yu smiled wryly.  

He knew his own limitations.  

That was beyond his capabilities.  

Better to focus on achieving the Golden Core Divine Ability Realm in the Lower Realm.  

So what if the realm was incomplete?  

A thousand years of lifespan was enough.
