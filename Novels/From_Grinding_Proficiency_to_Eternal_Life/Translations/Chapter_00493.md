# Chapter 493: True Body Dao Form

Lu Chunyang fell into a long silence, leaving only a stagnant quiet in the hall.

His gaze fell upon Xu Yunfan, who was respectfully prostrating himself below, and his heart finally softened.

He had been a Golden Core True Lord for many years, yet due to the exclusion by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, he had remained solitary all this time. Now, Xu Yunfan's appearance had finally broken this situation.

"After all, he is a seedling that emerged from my Dao Sect..."

Lu Chunyang sighed inwardly.

This deep-seated sentiment regarding the legacy of the Dao Sect, he was unwilling to sever.

What caught Lu Chunyang's attention even more was that after leaving the sect, this disciple had actually managed to reach the Foundation Establishment True Person realm solely through his own efforts. Such talent and perseverance were truly rare in the current era.

If the other party were a waste, it would be one thing, but now that Xu Yunfan possessed such potential, he naturally needed to give him a helping hand.

Furthermore, compared to the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, which had strict rules and little room for maneuver, the internal structure of the Primordial Origin Sect was clearly more complex, offering more space for him to operate skillfully.

This space provided a crucial stage for his upcoming plans.

In an instant, the pros and cons were clearly defined.

Looking at this junior before him, who carried the legacy of the Dao Sect, possessed outstanding abilities, and was entangled with Buddhist karma, Lu Chunyang made a decision in his heart.

In that instant, atop the vault of Lu Chunyang's Cave Void Heavenly Realm, several ancient stars suddenly shone brightly, their radiance like ten-thousand-foot-long silk ribbons, piercing through the void.

Among them, the ultimate Sword Intents of "Heavenly Secrets," "Calculation," "Truth-Seeing and Insight," and "Tracing the Origin" suddenly intersected and shone, flowing endlessly.

Each Sword Intent manifested as a实体 (physical)玄 light (mysterious light).

These several Sword Intents entangled each other, giving rise to wisps of light floss, like interwoven galactic ribbons, echoing under the vault.

The light was both scorching like a raging flame and piercingly cold like ice, reflecting the turbulent waves of Lu Chunyang's causal deduction in his heart.

This was not a technique for killing, but a manifestation of deduction born from his cultivation as a Golden Core True Lord.

Wherever the Sword Brilliance reached, layers of ripples were branded into the void.

As the light grew increasingly intense, the composure on Lu Chunyang's brow, which saw through the affairs of the world, also became increasingly solid. Just as he had concluded earlier, this action was not only to resolve Xu Yunfan's calamity but also a move in the game of chess.

After a long time, a preliminary strategy had quietly taken shape, clearly branded in his heart. It could both resolve this disciple's predicament and, perhaps, take advantage of the situation to add a chip for the Dao Sect or even for himself in the game between various parties.

After a long while, he slowly spoke, his words clear and logical: "The words 'Karmic Debt' seem to have no solution, but it is not a dead end either."

"The key lies in the 'Carrier.' That Buddhist karma is not imprinted on the true spiritual origin of you, the person named Xu Yunfan, but rather entangled with the causality of 'existence' represented by your current lifetime, this physical body, and this Primordial Spirit."

"The plan of the Bodhi Pure Land requires a 'carrier' that conforms to their Dharma, can bear the projection of the Buddhist Fruit, and is a 'Dao Seed' of sufficient weight."

A glimmer of insight into the world flashed in his eyes: "If you can sever a 'clone' of sufficient weight, one that can take root and grow in the Eastern Wasteland, and skillfully and completely 'transfer' and 'bind' this immense 'Buddhist karma' that you are forcibly pulled into onto it."

"Let that clone become the substitute that bears all the karma of the Buddhist Dharma's transmission to the East by the Bodhi Pure Land."

"Using the 'clone' to replace the 'main body,' have it walk the path of 'Buddhist Dharma's transmission to the East' in the Eastern Wasteland for you, perform the rituals of the Bodhi Pure Land, and bear that karma."

"Your main body can then extricate itself from the affair. Even more so..." Lu Chunyang's mouth curled into a meaningful smile: "Although that bound clone bears the disaster for you, it is not a path to death. If it encounters a fortunate opportunity and grasps the chance brought by the Bodhi Pure Land's grand ritual, it might even be able to share a trace of the supreme benefits that emanate from the projection of the 'Great Compassionate Sovereign King Buddha of the Lotus Light' at the final moment."

"Using the immense power of others to achieve oneself. A calamity may also be a source of immense fortune. This is the strategy of 'removing the fire by pulling out the fuel and substituting the peach with the plum'!"

Xu Yunfan reacted instantly. According to Lu Chunyang's method, this was not merely about avoiding misfortune; it was about biting off a piece of flesh from the Bodhi Pure Land.

In the next second, Xu Yunfan was instantly excited.

If the *Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Archive* were to be perfected, reaching the perfect rank in the attribute panel, it would naturally be able to refine another clone to bear the burden.

Moreover, the *Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Archive* was extremely profound. Even within the Primordial Origin Sect, it could be called a top-tier secret technique.

Although he did not know which old bastard had released it, with the Pure Ancestor Master by his side, no matter the other party's intentions, they could only suppress their thoughts.

From this perspective, it seemed that the True Lord Qingyuan had not expected that the *True武 Subduing Demon Scripture* was chosen by the Bodhi Pure Land within the Divine Martial Realm, and in the end, its fruits might be plucked by others.

Sever a clone, completely bind the Buddhist karma to it, and let the clone become a "pawn" of the Bodhi Pure Land to complete their plan.

His main body would then hide behind the scenes, watching the winds and clouds, and even possibly... profit from the conflict of others?!

After the immense shock came uncontrollable ecstasy and excitement.

This was truly a stroke of divine inspiration.

However, the next moment, a huge difficulty arose. To sever a clone capable of completely bearing such a vast karmic debt?

Easier said than done.

This kind of transformation involving the karma of the Great Dao could never be achieved by ordinary clone techniques.

Although the Cloud Archive Clone Technique was profound, it seemed to be lacking a bit when it came to replacing causality.

As if seeing through Xu Yunfan's doubts, Lu Chunyang immediately asked: "You said you cultivated a method for refining clones. What is it?"

Xu Yunfan answered respectfully without thinking: "Replying to Ancestor Master, what this disciple cultivates is the Primordial Origin Sect's *Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Archive*."

"*Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Archive*?"

Upon hearing this, Lu Chunyang's always calm and composed face finally showed a very obvious expression of astonishment for the first time.

"Ha!... So that's how it is! It really is that one! Good! Good! Good!"

Lu Chunyang said the word "good" three times in a row. The surprise and playfulness on his face finally turned into genuine appreciation and admiration. "No wonder, no wonder it could conceal the heavenly secrets and evade the initial deduction of the Guidance Buddha Lamp, forcing Amitabha's incarnation to manifest and try to forcibly enlighten you. For this technique to reappear in the world, it is truly the will of heaven. This is excellent, heaven helps you!"

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly upon hearing this. He bowed and cupped his fists: "Please, Ancestor Master, resolve my confusion."

Lu Chunyang stared at Xu Yunfan with burning eyes: "This is the origin of Daoist methods, the fundamental principle of creation and refining forms. The Eight Scenes refer to refining the Eight Scenes Divine Palace internally and forging a creation玄躯 (mysterious body) externally."

"If you can cultivate this *Cloud Archive* to the great perfection realm of 'Refining the Spirit and Returning to the Void, participating in the Eight Scenes as One, Returning to the Origin and Blending with the Primordial,' and possess supreme creation mysteries, a trace of an indestructible Dao Source will naturally arise within your body."

"Combined with the great resolve to sever worldly attachments and split your spirit and mind..."

"Using this as a foundation, it will be sufficient to truly sever a 'True Body Dao Form' that contains the imprint of your origin Dao, is almost identical to your true body, and possesses infinite potential, rather than an ordinary clone."
