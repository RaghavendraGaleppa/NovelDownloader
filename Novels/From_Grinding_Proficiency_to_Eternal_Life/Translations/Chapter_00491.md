# Chapter 491: You Have Deep Affinity with Buddhism

Even so, in the subsequent thousand years, although he stepped onto the throne of True Monarch and achieved the Golden Core of the Sword Dao, the label of "Outsider from the Small World" was never completely torn off.

Some deeply entrenched ancient True Monarch forces within the Wansheng Sword Sect never truly eliminated their estrangement and rejection of him.

If not for the fact that the war between the three sects was too brutal, leaving the Wansheng Sword Sect facing a generational gap and in desperate need of top combat power, and if not for Lu Chunyang's talent and comprehension being so dazzling that it caught the attention of the entire Taihua Lingxu World and might even break the shackles of the Sword Dao, he would not have been able to ascend to his position with his mere Golden Core cultivation.

Outsiders only see his glorious status; how could they know of the undercurrents surging within?

When he originally achieved the Golden Core, the timing, terrain, and human factors were all favorable, yet there was still one thing he could not overcome.

Listening to Lu Chunyang's calm narration, Xu Yunfan felt a chill in his heart, gaining a deeper understanding of the predicament the Founder, an "Outsider from the Small World," faced within the Wansheng Sword Sect.

At this moment, he heard Lu Chunyang's tone shift, carrying a hint of playfulness and frankness.

"Staying in the Primordial Origin Sect is not a bad choice for you."

He picked up the deep purple nine-aperture gourd at his waist, pulled out the stopper, and took a sip. He smiled faintly and said, "Most people call the Primordial Origin Sect a demonic sect, but its creed of 'the capable rise, the weak fall' points directly to the core of the Great Dao and is highly effective. If the 'Pure Yang Limitless, All Phenomena Silent' Golden Core I achieved back then hadn't perfectly契合 with a certain Sword Dao Golden Core of the Wansheng Sword Sect, belonging to its lineage and unchangeable, there were times I thought about joining the Primordial Origin Sect to seek some peace and freedom."

His words seemed like casual banter, but they revealed a trace of sincerity, causing Xu Yunfan, who was well-versed in the Primordial Origin Sect's style of operation, to click his tongue in surprise, his heart even more astonished.

There is a reason why the Primordial Origin Demon Sect is called a demonic sect; this point alone is enough to show that Lu Chunyang fears nothing.

Hearing Lu Chunyang's frank words, which even carried a hint of heresy, Xu Yunfan, who had been holding his breath, finally relaxed by more than half.

The Pure Yang Founder before him was clearly not one of those rigid, stubborn "haters of evil" who blindly viewed the Primordial Origin as a demon and sought to kill it.

On the contrary, the fearless and pragmatic views revealed in his words, along with a wisdom that saw through worldly affairs and appearances, made Xu Yunfan admire him deeply, and even more so, feel fortunate.

This was not just a thigh to cling to; it was a golden thigh standing at the absolute peak of the Sword Dao, unbreakable and dazzlingly bright!

The internal structure of the Wansheng Sword Sect is complex, and the deeply entrenched old forces indeed hold a barrier against Lu Chunyang, this True Monarch from a "small world," often showing disdain and rejection.

However, no matter how unwilling those True Monarch families with long inheritances were in their hearts, they ultimately had to "grit their teeth" and acknowledge his status.

In the final analysis, all of this stems from Lu Chunyang's terrifying strength.

In the Taihua Lingxu World, Sword Cultists have always been famous for their fierce offensive power, which is unparalleled among all.

An ordinary Sword Dao True Monarch is already terrifying enough, but the Pure Yang Founder before him has even comprehended and condensed over ten types of extreme Sword Intents within his vast and boundless "Dao-Born Sword Domain"—such as Blazing Sun, Cold Moon, Gale, Rending Void, Thick Earth, and No Return!

To ask, a Golden Core True Monarch who possesses such earth-shattering power, as if holding the ultimate laws of the Sword Dao in his hand—even if there are minor criticisms, who would dare to truly insult him even slightly?

Him sitting here is itself the embodiment of the ultimate sharpness of the Sword Dao, enough to suppress all discordant voices.

Xu Yunfan now clearly realized what a terrifyingly逆天 (heaven-defying) opportunity it was to have met this Founder and received his inquiry and willingness to help.

A Great True Monarch in the mid-stage of Golden Core, about to enter the late stage!

One old, one young, under the boundless starlight of this Pure Yang Cavern Heaven, conversed for a long time about the old affairs of the Dao Sect and their experiences in cultivation.

Xu Yunfan answered respectfully, recounting his own experiences and observations. Lu Chunyang occasionally offered a点评 (comment), brief and to the point, yet hitting the key points of the Great Dao, benefiting Xu Yunfan immensely. He felt the fog before him suddenly clear, and many of the places he had been stuck in the past, after being casually pointed out by the Founder, gave him a feeling of having a clear plan in mind.

Most importantly, Xu Yunfan glanced at his attribute panel.

Although Lu Chunyang only spoke occasionally, the proficiency for the True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra, the Profound Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Script, and the Wansheng Transforming Sword Art on the attribute panel was rising so fast it was almost like a screen refresh.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's eyes filled with thought, Lu Chunyang assumed he was contemplating the principles just discussed. Sitting on his meditation mat, he raised an eyebrow slightly, picked up the deep purple nine-aperture gourd at his waist and took a sip. His voice carried a distant, insightful tone as if he saw through everything.

"The Wansheng Transforming Sword Art is said to have been personally left by that Dao Lord. This is the foundation of the Sword Dao in the Taihua Lingxu World."

"Do you know why the Sword Intent in this world is so uniquely magnificent and dominant, while the intents of all other weapons—Sword Intent, Spear Intent, and even the true intents of axes, halberds, hooks, and tridents—are all silent, to the point of vanishing and disappearing?"

There was no need for Xu Yunfan to answer. A sneer and understanding that seemed to touch the origin of the world flashed across Lu Chunyang's lips, and he gave the cruel answer derived from the power of the Dao Lord with absolute certainty:

"It is because the Dao Lord, with his supreme power, first evolved, deduced, and manifested the true meaning of the 'Sword' from the chaos of all laws.

"Once the Sword Intent was formed, it was magnificent like a pillar of the laws of the Great Dao, already occupying the 'opportunity' and 'dominant position' in the evolution of this heaven and earth.

"From that moment on, the paths of all other artifacts were like sparks falling into a world-destroying ocean, suppressed and assimilated by the vast Sword Dao, eventually leading to eternal silence, with no chance of sprouting and appearing again for all eternity."

After a long while, Lu Chunyang put down the wine gourd, his warm yet sharp gaze falling on Xu Yunfan again, and the atmosphere shifted accordingly.

"Idle chatter ends here."

Lu Chunyang's voice was still calm, but the solemnity within it, as if it understood fate itself, pressed down like an invisible bedrock, shaking Xu Yunfan's heart.

"You have been firmly locked on by the Bodhi Pure Land with the 'Guiding Buddha Lamp,' branded with a karmic link. This is a destined entanglement that is difficult to escape."

He raised his eyebrows, his gaze seeming to pierce through the walls of the Cavern Heaven to land on that chaotic, distant Eastern Wasteland. "This is a grand chess game laid out by the World-Honored One, Tathagata. To existences like him, at the level of a Dao Lord, you are an indispensable 'link' in his plan. The Eastern Wasteland... even if you have a thousand unwillingnesses, you must go there."

Speaking of this, this Golden Core True Monarch also revealed a hint of helplessness, picking up the deep purple nine-aperture gourd at his waist and taking a sip.

He was only a Golden Core cultivator. The machinations of a Nascent Soul Dao Lord were manageable within the Wansheng Sword Sect's Southern Prefecture, after all, there was a Sword Dao Lord here. Even if the World-Honored One Tathagata was shameless enough to like showing off with full divine gear in a newbie village, he would have to weigh the consequences. But once outside the Southern Prefecture, it would be a different story.

"The True Martial Subduing Demon Sutra nurtured in the Divine Martial World, although it is a Great Dao inheritance pointing directly to the Golden Core, the true essence and profound meaning of this scroll of cultivation art, tracing back to its source, is actually derived from the more ancient and profound foundations of the Buddhist methods of the Bodhi Pure Land."
