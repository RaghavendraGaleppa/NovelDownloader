# Chapter 71: Publicly Disclosed Opportunity

"Very well."

After hearing Gao Yunrui's explanation, Qi Chunde sighed deeply and agreed to the matter. After all, as an honorary elder of Qinglu Sect, he didn't wish to see the sect fall into trouble.

After seeing off the sect leader, Qi Chunde headed to the third-grade spirit field to plant the spiritual herbs in his possession. Suddenly, his movements halted.

Because the sect leader who had just left had reappeared.

"Junior Brother Qi, I have good news. A third Spiritual Botanist has emerged in the sect. It's said this individual mastered the basics in just over a month. Would you like to meet them? Perhaps this disciple could inherit your legacy," Gao Yunrui said with a smile, looking at Qi Chunde.

Gao Yunrui knew that Qi Chunde's lineage in the Spiritual Botanist tradition was exceptionally strong. Thus, he had tried several times to persuade Qi Chunde to pass on his knowledge. However, until now, no disciple in the sect had managed to capture Qi Chunde's interest.

Now, such a disciple had appeared—someone who had become a full-fledged Spiritual Botanist in just over a month without any guidance. Such talent should surely be enough to make Qi Chunde reconsider.

"Very well!"

Upon hearing Gao Yunrui's words, the image of Gu Mo instantly surfaced in Qi Chunde's mind. During the lecture a month ago, this humble outer disciple had stood out with the best comprehension among the attendees. However, even Qi Chunde hadn't expected the disciple to master the basics of Spiritual Botanist techniques in just over a month.

"Disciple Gu Mo pays his respects to the Sect Leader and Elder Qi!" Gu Mo arrived at the peak of the spirit mountain and bowed respectfully.

"An outer disciple?"

Gao Yunrui was slightly taken aback upon seeing Gu Mo. After receiving the news from the Spiritual Botany Hall, he had rushed straight to Qi Chunde without investigating Gu Mo's background thoroughly. After all, the Spiritual Botany Hall wouldn't dare falsify such information.

"Ah!"

Seeing Gu Mo again, Qi Chunde sighed inwardly. Mastering Spiritual Botanist techniques in just over a month—such talent indeed moved Qi Chunde. However, Gu Mo's spiritual root aptitude would become the greatest obstacle to his advancement as a higher-tier Spiritual Botanist.

"Young man, come here."

Gao Yunrui beckoned to Gu Mo. The stark contrast between Gu Mo's demonstrated comprehension and his status as an outer disciple was too jarring. Thus, the sect leader decided to personally assess Gu Mo's spiritual roots, as the initial tests for outer disciples weren't always entirely accurate.

"Yes!"

Gu Mo couldn't refuse the sect leader's request to assess his spiritual roots. At the same time, he knew some of his secrets would inevitably be exposed. However, as the leader of the sect and a Golden Core Great Perfection cultivator, it was unlikely Gao Yunrui would covet the opportunities of a mere Qi Refining cultivator.

"Alas!"

The moment Gao Yunrui placed his hand on Gu Mo's shoulder, he immediately discerned the quality of Gu Mo's spiritual roots. In that instant, the joy in Gao Yunrui's heart vanished—his plan to have Qi Chunde take on a disciple had fallen through.

"Hmm?"

But soon, a flicker of surprise appeared in Gao Yunrui's eyes. While he had confirmed Gu Mo's inferior spiritual roots, he also discovered that Gu Mo had reached the fourth level of Qi Refining, with a foundation six times more solid than his peers.

Inferior spiritual roots and Qi Refining fourth level—this seemed contradictory. Those with inferior spiritual roots typically hit their limit at Qi Refining third level. Reaching the fourth level suggested Gu Mo had encountered some fortuitous opportunity.

As for Gu Mo's opportunity, Gao Yunrui had no intention of probing further. As the leader of Qinglu Sect, why would he be interested in the meager opportunities of a Qi Refining cultivator? In fact, he could effortlessly provide resources to help a third-level outer disciple break through to the fourth level.

"Ah..."

Gao Yunrui sighed softly and withdrew his hand. If not for Gu Mo's spiritual roots, this disciple would have been the perfect template for an elite inner disciple.

The sighs from both the sect leader and the Spiritual Botanist elder didn't escape Gu Mo's notice. At this moment, he too felt a pang of disappointment—it seemed his hope of becoming Elder Qi's disciple had vanished.

His second-grade spirit field...

"Becoming a Spiritual Botanist in such a short time is still quite impressive." Seeing Gu Mo's dejected expression, Gao Yunrui offered some words of comfort before producing a porcelain bottle containing three Breakthrough Pills. These pills could directly elevate Gu Mo's cultivation to Qi Refining sixth level.

Since Gu Mo had already obtained one opportunity to reach Qi Refining fourth level, Gao Yunrui decided to grant him another. What Qi Refining cultivators considered major opportunities were merely spare bottles of pills to a Golden Core cultivator.

"Thank you, Sect Leader!"

Suppressing his excitement, Gu Mo respectfully accepted the bottle. His excitement wasn't for the pills themselves—after all, he didn't need any Breakthrough Pills. Once his Sunflower upgrade was complete, he could advance straight to Qi Refining Great Perfection.

What truly thrilled Gu Mo was that the sect leader's reward provided a legitimate explanation for his rapid progress. From now on, he could attribute all his sudden advancements to the sect leader's generosity.

Who would dare covet something openly granted by the sect leader?

"Here is a specialized Spiritual Botanist technique. Take it back and study it carefully." Seeing the sect leader's reward, Qi Chunde thought for a moment before producing a manual.

"Thank you, Elder!"

Gu Mo accepted the manual with reverence and flipped through a few pages out of curiosity. Then he froze. Wasn't this technique the same method he had independently devised to accelerate plant growth?

"Hmm? Is something wrong?"

Gu Mo's reaction puzzled Qi Chunde. He could understand expressions of delight or confusion, but Gu Mo's look of sudden realization was perplexing.

"Reporting to the Elder, this disciple previously stumbled upon a minor method to accelerate the growth of spiritual plants. It bears great resemblance to the technique described in this manual." After some thought, Gu Mo decided to be forthright. There was no need to hide things from a Golden Core cultivator—what he considered secrets might be trivial in their eyes.

"What?!"

Qi Chunde was stunned. To independently comprehend a growth-accelerating technique—was this level of comprehension even possible?

"Then demonstrate it for me."

Qi Chunde produced a spiritual plant for Gu Mo to work with.

"Elder, perhaps we could use this disciple's plant instead?" Gu Mo eyed the spiritual plant in Qi Chunde's hand, which radiated intense spiritual energy. This was likely a third-grade plant. Asking a fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator to accelerate a third-grade plant's growth would drain him dry without producing any visible effect.

"Very well."

Realizing his mistake, Qi Chunde calmly put away the plant.

Gu Mo then took out a prepared Jade Spirit Rice plant for demonstration. Activating Plant Perception, he revealed the plant's energy channels before channeling his spiritual energy into them, propelling the rice's growth at a visible pace.

Watching this, Qi Chunde stood up and paced back and forth several times. Finally, as if reaching a decision, he handed Gu Mo a token.

"If you can reach Foundation Establishment, bring this token to me. I will accept you as my personal disciple." Faced with Gu Mo's extraordinary comprehension, Qi Chunde's resolve finally wavered. However, he didn't immediately take Gu Mo as a disciple, instead setting a challenge.

If Gu Mo could reach Foundation Establishment despite his inferior spiritual roots, Qi Chunde would accept him—and as a personal disciple at that. Being a personal disciple meant Qi Chunde would dedicate himself fully to Gu Mo's training, even if it required expending several times the resources normally allotted to a cultivator.
