# Chapter 227: One Step to Blood Transformation

After the blood transformation was complete, his vital energy became as fierce as a flood dragon, and his internal force began to penetrate deep into his bone marrow. He tempered a mouthful of silver frost, and subsequently refined his five viscera and six bowels, achieving a perfect, leakless body.

After a long while, Xu Yunfan slowly retracted his stance and carefully examined his attribute panel.

As for the Pure Yang One Qi Art, the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique was not far from reaching the Advanced Mastery level. Adding today's cultivation progress, only one hundred and twenty-three points remained. Relying on the daily absorption of the ginseng baby's spiritual qi, using the pure yang internal energy of the Pure Yang One Qi Art to assist the Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Force, and supported by the flesh and blood of demons...

Training every day to the limit of his physical body's endurance would yield nearly twenty points of proficiency. If he could achieve enlightenment or gain new insights, his proficiency could increase by a few more points.

At most, within seven days, his internal force would overflow within his flesh and blood, seep into his blood, and begin to refine his vital energy, achieving Blood Transformation.

A Blood Transformation expert, if they were to walk the martial world, would be respectfully addressed as a senior master.

If they went to some smaller regions, they would have the qualifications to establish a sect and dominate a territory.

Given the current chaotic situation of the Great Zhou, it wouldn't be impossible to carve out a territory and become a king, achieving the status of a local warlord.

Setting that aside, Xu Yunfan was filled with joy for a moment, but then he frowned as he looked at the dissipating spiritual mist before him.

It was a bit thinner than in previous days.

At this pace, he was afraid that all the Primordial Spirit Qi would be absorbed within a month. With the terrain of the mountain range beneath his feet, a gathering place for Primordial Spirit, it would take at least a year or two to condense the Spirit Condensation Qi again to the level it was when he first arrived.

Moreover, this is only possible because the Primordial Spirit Qi in the outside world has recovered slightly; otherwise, it would truly be a case of using a little less.

What made Xu Yunfan almost unable to hold back was that when the nine-chi high platform fell into the molten pool, it clearly triggered some mechanism, thereby opening the Divine Weapon Secret Realm.

The Dragon Scale Armor on his body was forcibly认主 (recognized its master) under the Extreme Dao Remains and the Lin Seal, which was likely a necessary condition for opening the secret realm.

However, this was also a good thing.

Where else in the outside world could there be so much spiritual qi for him to cultivate? Only a secret realm that hasn't been opened for two thousand years could allow him to make such refined progress.

He raised his head and looked at the distant, overlapping mountain ranges. At the convergence points of the mountain trends in the folds, those places definitely harbored powerful demons.

In seven days, once he steps into Blood Transformation, he would slaughter them!

During these few days, Xu Yunfan, with his hunting skills, naturally had no shortage of wild game. However, after eating the old ape's flesh and blood and experiencing the boost from demonic blood, he naturally found it somewhat addictive. He became somewhat disdainful of food that only satisfied his tongue.

The next seven days, with the attribute panel's proficiency increase, advancing to the Blood Transformation realm was naturally a matter of course.

To prevent the Extreme Dao Remains from pulling him into a dream and delaying his cultivation progress, Xu Yunfan could be said to be working without sleep or rest.

Every morning, he stood on a precipice, facing the purple energy from the east, using the Pure Yang One Qi Art to refine the morning glow.

At noon, he cultivated while consuming the ginseng qi and the remaining demon flesh, roasting and eating them, practicing the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique.

In the evening, as usual, he took a breath of ginseng qi, transforming it into streams of heat like molten lava that circulated between his flesh, muscles, bones, and skin membranes.

Then, he would sit cross-legged, form the Lin Seal with his hands, and quietly recite the "Supreme Good is Like Water" Heart Mantra in his heart.

Now, with the ginseng qi and spiritual qi as aids, although the Lin Seal didn't increase his proficiency, Xu Yunfan could clearly feel that his spirit was becoming more resilient as it was continuously refined.

Having completely immersed himself in cultivation, Xu Yunfan was unaware that seven days had passed. The demon flesh contributed by the old ape had been completely devoured.

When the Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Force completed its final cycle within his flesh and blood, Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. A feeling of needing to vent made his throat move.

A sound of a dragon's roar and a tiger's cry suddenly erupted from his throat. The white mist spraying from his pores around his body condensed into three hundred and sixty serpent whiskers and spread out far away.

The Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Force emitted a sound of metal clashing deep within his flesh and blood, almost completely soaking his flesh and blood, making every trace of his flesh and blood contain internal force.

Just by raising his hands and moving his feet, there was the sound of wind and thunder exploding.

"Crack!"

His shoulder blades suddenly protruded a chi, transforming into two miniature volcanoes.

The boiling internal force poured down his spine, tearing through twelve layers of flesh and blood shackles along the way.

Like a flood overwhelming the Golden Mountain, his flesh and blood could no longer contain the eruption of internal force. Just as a roar like a river bursting its banks was heard, Xu Yunfan suddenly realized that his blood was slowly congealing into mercury slurry. The moment it shattered his blood vessel walls, it actually emitted a muffled sound like a mountain collapsing.

[Your Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer has Advanced to Mastery]

[You have stepped into the Blood Transformation Realm]

The moment the attribute panel popped up, Xu Yunfan suddenly went deaf.

The world turned crimson. He saw his heart, as if it had become a twelve-cylinder engine, pumping frantically, swallowing and spitting out astonishing amounts of blood.

In the surging world of blood within his vision, every muscle seemed to transform into twisted red copper chains, creaking as they were washed by large streams of warm currents that appeared out of nowhere in his body.

The originally dark red blood vessels now took on a metallic luster. When the mercury-like blood surged and struck the vessel walls, it actually emitted a roar mixed with the boiling of molten lava.

He watched, wide-eyed, as the bulging veins on his arms turned to jade inch by inch. The fascia network under his skin flared with light like forged black iron.

When he subconsciously swallowed a mouthful of saliva, the warm current transformed by the attribute panel within his body was making the one hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred blood-producing marrow cells undergo疯狂 (frenzied) fission. The newly born blood cells far exceeded the original intensity.

More resilient, more active, and with more intense vital energy.

Strands of the Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Force began to merge with his blood, guiding the vital energy, constantly condensing and refining.

Under the rapid changes of the attribute panel, the blood, which now appeared as mercury slurry, transformed into a molten lava river. The surface of each blood cell appeared as if it had undergone a thousand temperings.

The Crimson Serpent Coiling Mountain Force penetrated deep into his bone marrow. The one hundred and twenty-nine thousand six hundred marrow cells trembled simultaneously, spewing out new blood that carried the serpent-shaped internal force, forming nine layers of spiral vortices within his blood vessels.

Thump! Thump!

The sound of his heart beating like a drum cracked the ground. A large amount of internal force began to be transmitted throughout his body along with his blood, reaching even the tiniest places it couldn't reach before.

This realm was a true transformation of life, greatly enhancing his own vitality and life force.

His lifespan had now broken through the human limit, and he could live for at least two hundred years.

Moreover, the life force of a Blood Transformation martial artist was so strong it was inconceivable. Even if his heart was shattered or his five viscera and six bowels were damaged, he could still recover through the scouring of his powerful vital energy.

This was the same for Xu Yunfan when he hammered Qin Lie and Chu Mo to death. If he hadn't blown their heads off, they could have even used secret martial techniques in a short time to temporarily restore their combat power to its peak.

Sensing the large chunks of memories about cultivating the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique in his mind, Xu Yunfan shook his head and couldn't help but grin.

The cultivation in his memories was far more diligent than his own, or rather, it was brutally extreme.

The cultivation memories transmitted to him by the attribute panel gave him the feeling of being locked in a dark room and forcibly cultivated to the Blood Transformation realm before this segment of memory was cut off and returned to him.
