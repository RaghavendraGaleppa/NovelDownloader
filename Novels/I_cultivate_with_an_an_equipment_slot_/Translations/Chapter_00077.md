# Chapter 77: The Seventh True Successor and Secret Revelations  

"You're saying you cultivated ten second-grade spirit plants... and one third-grade spirit plant?"  

In the grand hall of Wood Spirit Peak, Zhuge Wan sat upon her throne, looking at Zhang Yan with undisguised astonishment in her voice.  

"Yes, Master. I cultivated ten spirit fruit trees and one Clearheart Lotus," Zhang Yan replied without hesitation. There was no reason to hide anything from his master.  

"Master, I can vouch for him. Junior Brother called me to assist, and the entire process was recorded with a Memory Stone," Mu Sen stepped forward, producing the stone as proof.  

Without another word, Zhuge Wan took the Memory Stone and pressed it against her forehead. A brief scan with her divine sense revealed its contents.  

"...This..." After reviewing the recording, Zhuge Wan immediately noticed something amiss. She glanced at Mu Sen and said, "You may leave. I need to speak with your junior brother alone."  

"As you command, Master." Mu Sen bowed and withdrew without another word, leaving only Zhang Yan and Zhuge Wan in the hall.  

"You used the *Flower Grafting Secret Technique*," Zhuge Wan said sternly. "How did you learn it?"  

Unlike Mu Sen, who had participated in the Spirit Plant Competition but had never witnessed the technique firsthand, Zhuge Wan recognized it immediately.  

"Elder Weng taught me," Zhang Yan answered truthfully. In a way, it wasn't a lie—Elder Weng *had* been the one to impart the knowledge.  

"Elder Weng taught you?" Zhuge Wan's expression turned cold. "The *Flower Grafting Secret Technique* is a closely guarded secret of the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace. Even if Elder Weng favored you, why would he teach you such a thing?"  

"I swear I'm not lying, Master. Elder Weng mentioned it in passing, but he never expected me to actually master it," Zhang Yan quickly explained, seeing her skepticism.  

"...Hmph."  

Zhuge Wan fell silent. Zhang Yan's explanation sounded absurd, yet she found herself believing it.  

She had personally witnessed Zhang Yan's terrifying comprehension abilities before. His talent was simply monstrous—anything she explained, he grasped instantly. At first, she had suspected he was merely pretending to understand, but every test proved otherwise.  

He was the real deal.  

So, putting herself in Elder Weng's shoes, she could imagine the scene: Elder Weng, impressed by Zhang Yan's talent, had casually mentioned the technique, assuming he wouldn't be able to learn it.  

But Zhang Yan had.  

"Very well. I will inform the Sect Master and the other elders to evaluate your True Successor trial," Zhuge Wan said after a deep breath.  

"Thank you, Master!" Zhang Yan beamed.  

"No, *I* should be thanking *you*," Zhuge Wan replied, her tone lighter, as if a great burden had been lifted. "Wood Spirit Peak finally has a True Successor."  

A True Successor was of immense importance—not just to a Golden Core cultivator like herself, but to the entire peak. It meant the sect would pour resources into nurturing Zhang Yan, greatly increasing his chances of reaching the Golden Core realm.  

With that, Wood Spirit Peak could preserve its status as one of the Seven Peaks of the Green Scale Sect, rather than being demoted to a mere mountain branch.  

"It is my duty as a disciple," Zhang Yan said earnestly.  

From Wood Spirit Peak to the entire Green Scale Sect, from Zhuge Wan to Mu Sen, Sect Master Mo Changqing, and even Lei Kunhai—all had treated him well. He had experienced genuine warmth within the sect.  

Now, it was only right that he repaid them.

**Bong—**  

**Bong—**  

**Bong—**  

Three resonant bell chimes echoed through the Green Scale Sect, summoning all available elders to the main hall.  

The elders of the Green Scale Sect were either Golden Core cultivators or masters of their respective crafts—such as the master of Iron Puppet Peak, who, despite being only at the Foundation Establishment stage, could control Golden Core-level puppets.  

Or the other elder of Wood Spirit Peak, a Foundation Establishment cultivator capable of nurturing third-grade spirit plants.  

Their status was high, second only to the seven peak lords.  

This time, nearly twenty elders gathered in the hall.  

Mo Changqing, Zhuge Wan, and Lei Kunhai sat at the forefront.  

"I have called everyone here today to announce that the Green Scale Sect will soon welcome its seventh True Successor," Mo Changqing declared, glancing at Lei Kunhai.  

He had expected Lei Kunhai to protest, but to his surprise, the man was flushed with excitement, looking almost giddy.  

"The seventh True Successor!"  

The non-Golden Core elders were momentarily stunned.  

One elder, friendly with Lei Kunhai, stood and congratulated him, "Brother Lei, congratulations!"  

Lei Kunhai waved a hand dismissively. "Ah, it's nothing, nothing."  

The elder continued, "With Wanbao becoming a True Successor, his path to Golden Core is assured!"  

Lei Kunhai's smile froze.  

"Wanbao? Who said the seventh True Successor is Wanbao? That brat still has a long way to go before he can even dream of becoming a True Successor!"  

The elder: "???"  

He was utterly baffled. Hadn't Lei Kunhai been pushing for Lei Wanbao to become a True Successor all along?  

And if it wasn't Wanbao, why was he so damn happy?!  

Mo Changqing couldn't help but facepalm.  

What was wrong with Lei Kunhai? Just days ago, he had vehemently opposed Zhang Yan's candidacy. But after a single visit from Zhang Yan, he had done a complete about-face, now acting like Zhang Yan's biggest supporter.  

Anyone who didn’t know better would think Zhang Yan was Lei Kunhai’s actual grandson.  

"The seventh True Successor is Zhang Yan of Wood Spirit Peak, Junior Sister Zhuge's disciple," Mo Changqing explained wearily. "At our last meeting, we assigned him the task of cultivating ten first-grade superior spirit plants and one second-grade spirit plant."  

"Zhang Yan? Ah, that youngster. I remember him."  

The name rang a bell—Zhuge Wan’s disciples were well-known.  

"So, the boy completed the task?" another elder asked.  

"Not only did he complete it, he exceeded expectations," Mo Changqing said proudly. "He cultivated *ten* second-grade spirit plants and *one* third-grade spirit plant—greatly enriching our sect’s foundation!"  

Zhuge Wan: "..."  

She was speechless.  

Zhang Yan was *her* disciple. Why were these two acting so smug?  

"However, there is one issue," an elder interjected. "For a True Successor to be recognized, they must prove themselves worthy. According to tradition, this is done through either a scholarly or martial challenge."  

"Since Zhang Yan completed a spirit plant trial, I assume it will be a scholarly challenge? If so, any disciple—regardless of age—within the same major realm can challenge him. How will he handle that?"  

The room fell silent.  

Scholarly challenges were rare—most True Successors proved themselves through combat.  

"That’s simple," Lei Kunhai cut in before Zhuge Wan could respond. "Zhang Yan specializes in spirit plants, so any challenge would be spirit plant-related. The most skilled in that field are all from Wood Spirit Peak. As long as Junior Sister Zhuge keeps them in line, no one will dare cause trouble."  

"And if anyone from *your* peaks tries to make trouble, they’ll have to answer to *me*!"  

The elders were speechless.  

Had Zhang Yan cast some kind of spell on Lei Kunhai?  

Zhang Yan wasn’t even his descendant! His actual descendant hadn’t even made the cut!  

But they all knew this was a non-issue.  

The True Successor appointment was decided by the Sect Master and elders. While challenges were technically allowed, who would dare defy their collective decision?  

---  

With the matter settled, preparations began in earnest.  

The coronation of the Green Scale Sect’s seventh True Successor was a major event, not just for the Heavenly Eye Mountain Range but for the entire Zhou Kingdom.  

As news spread, neighboring sects sent their congratulations—after all, the Green Scale Sect was a dominant force in the region.  

"True Successor… From now on, I’ll have to call you *Senior Brother* True Successor," Mu Sen said with a wry smile as he stood beside Zhang Yan.  

"Senior Brother, you jest," Zhang Yan replied hastily. "I owe my achievements to your guidance. You will always be my senior brother. If you ever need anything, I will not refuse."  

Zhang Yan held deep respect for Mu Sen, who had played a pivotal role in his rise. Without him, reaching this point would have taken much longer.  

"Good. I’ll hold you to that," Mu Sen chuckled.  

"But Senior Brother, our sect has six True Successors. Why have I never seen them?" Zhang Yan suddenly asked, curious.
