# Chapter 2: Shadow Assassination

Zhuge Chen's eyelids twitched, his tone firm, "Absolutely not!"

His gaze swept over the older cultivators, noticing a flicker of eagerness in their eyes. He added coldly, "And that goes for all of you! No taking on Fang Jun's work as a favor, and certainly no asking for payment."

Zhuge Chen understood the thoughts of these older cultivators all too well.

Knowing their own cultivation prospects were bleak, they placed their hopes on the next generation, willing to toil tirelessly for even a sliver of opportunity for their descendants.

Fang Jun frowned slightly, his voice calm but laced with skepticism, "Shopkeeper, you must have a reason for this arrangement, or else my increased wages will inevitably attract envy and cause trouble."

Zhuge Chen's expression remained serene, though a hint of helplessness flickered in his eyes. "It's not something I'm doing intentionally. It's your mother's wish that you earn more. I owe her a debt, and this is the only way I can repay it."

"Heh, what a great 'favor'."

Fang Jun sneered inwardly, already understanding the true reason.

The "mother" Zhuge Chen spoke of was not Fang Jun's birth mother.

His birth mother had died early, and his father had remarried. According to custom, his stepmother was now his mother.

However, the path of cultivation was like a fierce river crossing, and the Fang family's resources were limited, unable to support two direct descendants simultaneously.

From a young age, Fang Jun had been ostracized. To protect himself, he left Anxi City with a servant his birth mother had left behind, before his spiritual root could even be tested, distancing himself from the Fang family's conflicts.

"So that bitch's son has mediocre spiritual roots, otherwise why would she target me?"

"On the surface, she's giving me high wages, but in reality, she's forcing me to cultivate with pills, trapping me with pill toxins and ruining my future, hoping the elders will change their minds," Fang Jun mused to himself.

He hadn't wanted to get involved in such petty squabbles.

With his cultivation speed, comparable to a dual-attribute spiritual root, his future should have been bright.

However, being born into the Fang family meant he was destined to be entangled in this karma.

If not for the Fang family's background, a cultivator with five spiritual roots like him probably wouldn't even have had the chance to embark on the path of cultivation.

Of course, the most important point was that he had settled in Anxi City with Zhuge Chen's help, and Zhuge Chen had also provided him with work.

Although Zhuge Chen seemed to be siding with his "mother" now, there was still a debt of gratitude.

If it didn't involve his fundamental interests, maintaining the status quo was acceptable.

"I'll meet soldiers with generals, and water with earth. As long as I continue to advance rapidly, what does the Fang family's conflict matter?"

Having made up his mind, Fang Jun looked up at Zhuge Chen and said, "In that case, I want ten percent of the profits."

Zhuge Chen shook his head. "Ten percent is too much. Seven percent is the limit."

Fang Jun didn't back down. "Nine percent."

Zhuge Chen pondered for a moment. "Eight percent is the most I can offer."

Fang Jun nodded. "Alright."

After the meeting, Old Man Li patted Fang Jun on the shoulder, his voice filled with envy. "Fellow Daoist Fang, those eight percent wages of yours are making my eyes green."

Fang Jun smiled wryly. "I'd gladly give you these eight percent."

Old Man Li's eyes lit up. "You really mean it? The blacksmith furnace is a private room. As long as you spend the required time inside, who knows what you're doing?"

Fang Jun shook his head. "You've got a good plan, but don't forget, the shopkeeper will notice if the furnace is running overtime."

Old Man Li chuckled. "That's easy. I'll find a few old brothers to help you in shifts. Everyone gets a share, and we won't go over the time limit."

Fang Jun still refused. "That's not appropriate. The shopkeeper might have other tricks up his sleeve. Besides, this involves the Fang family. Don't get involved."

Old Man Li didn't take it seriously. "The Fang family is only powerful in this small area. In Anxi City, they're nothing."

Fang Jun said seriously, "Even so, the risk remains."

Old Man Li scoffed. "What path of cultivation doesn't have risks? You could mismanage your energy and die instantly."

"This little bit of risk is nothing compared to the money you'll earn."

"That's the problem, giving it to you means I'll earn less?" Fang Jun thought to himself, but on the surface, he insisted, "No need. This is my problem, after all. I can't drag you into it, Fellow Daoist."

Seeing that he couldn't persuade him, Old Man Li didn't say anything more. After chatting for a few words, he went to start work.

...

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

In the fiery red room, Fang Jun was shirtless, sweat dripping down his back.

He held a large hammer in his hand, rhythmically striking the blacksmith's table, the sound of the hammer rising and falling like a musical score.

This was Fang Jun's job at the blacksmith shop. Unlike ordinary blacksmithing, a cultivator's blacksmithing involves forging ordinary iron into spiritual materials.

The core theory behind this comes from the "World Structure Theory."

In the world before his transmigration, whether ancient or modern, Chinese or foreign, each had its own world structure theory, which is to say, what the world is composed of.

The cultivation world is no exception.

The cultivation world believes that the world originates from chaos, and chaos differentiates into clear and turbid spiritual energy. Clear and turbid spiritual energy then gives rise to essence, qi, and spirit, ultimately constructing all things.

This theory is not a mathematical model like string theory, nor is it a philosophical model like the five elements theory of his previous life.

Rather, it is a physical model that has been proven by generations of cultivators and can truly guide cultivation and production.

Why can ordinary steel be upgraded to spiritual material? It is precisely because steel also has essence, qi, and spirit.

Cultivators use special techniques to inject spiritual energy into the steel, helping it "cultivate," thereby transforming it into spiritual material.

Simply put, treat the steel as an ordinary person, but this person has no spiritual roots, cannot sense spiritual energy, and cannot cultivate.

But cultivators can help the steel attract spiritual energy, and then help the steel cultivate, becoming a cultivator.

And the cultivation techniques involve essence, qi, and spirit. If the steel does not have essence, qi, and spirit, how can it use the cultivation techniques?

Therefore, this proves that steel may have essence, qi, and spirit.

Fang Jun, as someone proficient in mathematical tools and good at optimizing five elements problems, is very familiar with this forging technique.

Moreover, steel is not human, so there is no need to worry about the changes in "spirit" caused by "passive cultivation," leading to various problems such as idiocy, madness, and loss of consciousness.

Therefore, the double workload Zhuge Chen gave him was just a piece of cake for him.

The reason he was hiding his strength was because there was no need to reveal it.

There was no benefit to exposing it. Did he expect the boss to give him a raise?

He liked to grind, grinding until there was no food to eat.

Didn't he see that even with the current 50% increase in production, Zhuge Chen and the Great River Sect behind him were reluctant to increase wages by 50%?

Moreover, the hearts of people in the cultivation world are treacherous, and a slight carelessness can lead to eternal damnation.

"Buzz—!"

Suddenly, an alarm sounded in Fang Jun's sea of consciousness.

His brows furrowed, and he quickly stopped his movements, his gaze sharply turning to where the alarm spell was triggered.

In the corner of the room, a black shadow quietly appeared. The shadow was humanoid, completely black, with only a pair of blood-red pupils staring intently at Fang Jun.

The moment Fang Jun noticed it, the black shadow unhesitatingly transformed into a black light, suddenly pouncing towards him!
