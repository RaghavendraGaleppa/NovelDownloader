# Chapter 618: What of a True Monarch?

He instinctively opened his mouth to argue, but the words stuck on the tip of his tongue and were swallowed back down.

The other party was a Golden Core True Monarch. Their appearance here was undoubtedly due to him refining the Yin Immortal Golden Essence earlier, causing a slight leakage of aura. Or perhaps, from the moment he left the Heavenly Realm, Clear Source True Monarch had been secretly monitoring everyone.

What a beast!

He didn't even trust the Foundation Establishment True Lords within his own sect, using them as bait everywhere.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath.

For such an existence to speak up and expose him, how could it be mere speculation? It must be based on some irrefutable deduction or a secret technique's感应 (sensing).

More importantly, since Clear Source True Monarch had personally appeared to expose this secret, his intentions were obvious.

Whether true or false, he had to personally confirm it, and in the process of confirmation, mere words could not stop him.

If he couldn't hand over the Dao Fruit, or if he refused after being discovered, the outcome would be the same.

"Hand over that Yin Dao Fruit,"

Clear Source True Monarch's voice remained flat, yet it carried an irresistible heavenly authority, clearly piercing through the long sky, each word hammering into Xu Yunfan's heart.

"Regarding your theft of the Dao Fruit, this seat will not pursue it. After all, it is a tradition of my Primordial Origin Sect. You have indeed grasped its essence. Rest assured, you will not be treated poorly. Hand it over, and you will be heavily rewarded."

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched minutely, a forced, insincere smile.

Deep within his Dantian Sea of Qi, the three dormant Golden Core sword intents belonging to the Pure Yang Ancestor, Lu Chunyang, were like a drawn bowstring, ready to be released at any moment.

This was the source of his confidence in not directly using the Soul Swap technique to replace his clone.

Simultaneously, he调动 (mobilized) his entire will,艰难地 (strugglingly) resisting the soul-level pressure brought by the Golden Core rank, and slowly spoke, his voice carrying a hint of hoarseness.

"I wonder what kind of reward the True Monarch could offer that could rival a Dao Fruit?"

This seemed like a question, but in reality, it was a silent resistance.

Clear Source True Monarch was somewhat surprised. He couldn't understand why Xu Yunfan was still trying to stall.

What method could there be when facing a Golden Core True Monarch?

Wanting to stall, then accumulating the courage and strength for a final, desperate move?

"Hmph."

Upon hearing this, Clear Source True Monarch revealed a smile as if he had already seen through Xu Yunfan's thoughts, his eyes filled with a hint of amusement.

Sometimes, when a powerful expert crushes a newbie village, there is this kind of cat-and-mouse teasing, wanting to see just how much the other party will struggle under absolute power.

Those who obtain Dao Fruit, excluding the few Dao Lords who have already ascended to higher dimensions, are already the top-tier power level in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Even among the many界天 (worlds), they are at the top tier.

"This seat possesses a lost ancient thunder treasure, the World-Stabilizing Thunder Marrow."

His gaze locked onto Xu Yunfan's eyes, his words cold.

"This item is enough to draw that silent, thousand-year-old Divine Mist Jade Clear Nine Chambers Mystic Vault Myriad Transformation Immortal Dao Fruit to favor you early! Saving you a hundred years of accumulating rituals and the hardship of subduing myriad demons!"

This generous reward was aimed directly at the core of Xu Yunfan's future condensation of the Golden Core.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered slightly upon hearing this. These Golden Core True Monarchs were truly wealthy, one after another, able to produce such things.

This item was mentioned in the Divine Mist Nine Chambers True Scripture. If refined, it could naturally attune one to the Dao Fruit position. One wouldn't even need to contemplate and凝聚 (condense) visions. As long as one refined the Immortal Golden Essence, using the World-Stabilizing Thunder Marrow as a guide, it would definitely draw this至尊 (supreme) Dao Fruit, ranked among the top ten of the 108 Heaven and Earth Dao Fruits, to manifest.

However, was Clear Source True Monarch really that kind?

Xu Yunfan naturally didn't believe it.

After all, upon reaching the Golden Core realm, every step forward meant needing to refine more Dao Fruits compatible with one's nature.

Clear Source True Monarch cultivated the Wonder Method of Heaven and Earth Clear Qi, refining the Clear Qi of the Immortal Palace.

This Divine Mist Jade Clear Dao Fruit would also be of great benefit to him. He might even rely on this supreme Dao Fruit to step into the mid Golden Core stage, thereby stabilizing his洞天 (cave heaven) and truly achieving longevity.

However...

"If..." Xu Yunfan pretended to have a dry throat, each word sounding like the friction of rusty iron, as if the decision was extremely difficult. "...this disciple refuses to hand it over?"

"Refuse?"

The smile at the corner of Clear Source True Monarch's mouth instantly widened, as if he had heard something extremely ridiculous, but the depths of his eyes were as cold as a frozen pool, directly pronouncing the verdict.

"Then you shall be形神俱灭 (body and soul annihilated), not even able to enter reincarnation. That pitiful bit of Immortal Golden Essence in your body hasn't even fully condensed. With a single thought from this seat, a single glance, I can completely erase you."

It was basically a situation where a single glance meant death.

For a Golden Core True Monarch facing a Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was such absolute suppression.

When practicing martial arts, it was possible to fight across realms, but in the path of cultivation, the further one went, the more every small realm improvement was like ascending to heaven for oneself.

Even now, at late Foundation Establishment, Xu Yunfan could easily take on three of his mid Foundation Establishment selves.

Xu Yunfan let out a deep breath.

His originally tense body relaxed somewhat.

Looking at Clear Source True Monarch's somewhat indifferent face, his thoughts raced.

If the True Monarch standing before him was from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, perhaps relying on the righteous atmosphere of the sect and the face of the Pure Yang Ancestor, he might have some room for negotiation, believing the other party might keep some promises.

But who was he facing now?

A Golden Core True Monarch from the Primordial Origin Sect.

It was known as the most scheming sect in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, willing to do anything to achieve their goals, called the Primordial Demon Sect by the world.

Wanting to silence him after killing him was almost a必然 (inevitable) choice.

Otherwise, if it spread that a dignified Golden Core True Monarch coveted and抢夺 (snatched) a Foundation Establishment disciple's opportunity, how could the face of the Primordial Origin Sect be preserved?

Furthermore, Clear Source True Monarch was essentially snatching the fruit from Universal Salvation True Monarch. If Xu Yunfan leaked some information, it would naturally be不利 (unfavorable) for Clear Source True Monarch.

He was already an unstable factor.

Only by彻底 (completely) dying would it be the ideal state.

Moreover, being full of lies was the standard configuration of the Primordial Origin Sect.

The arc at the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth gradually became clear, no longer forced camouflage, but instead carrying a hint of strange mockery.

He raised his head, his gaze seemingly casually sweeping over the sky above the eastern sea, where the clouds were stirred into chaos by some high-level power. The causal threads there were tangled and紊乱 (disordered), like countless forcibly torn and knotted silk threads. Even a Golden Core True Monarch's divine eye would find it difficult to clarify the source in the short term.

Xu Yunfan suddenly laughed out loud. The laughter was格外 (particularly)刺耳 (jarring) in this dead, silent, and solidified space, filled with a sense of eagerness to try.

"It seems the True Monarch's personal visit this time was done secretly, without Universal Salvation True Monarch's knowledge, right? Tsk tsk, taking advantage of the situation where he is busy dividing the Heavenly Emperor's Dao Fruit to be distracted, secretly出手 (making a move) to disrupt the机缘 (opportunities) of the East Sea. The True Monarch has a good plan. The causal chaos is so great that even the True Monarch himself cannot quickly clarify it. Isn't this exactly your doing?"

He directly pointed out the secrecy of Clear Source True Monarch's actions and the root of his timing choice.

Clear Source True Monarch's eyes were deep, showing no emotion whatsoever.
