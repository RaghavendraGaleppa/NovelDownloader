# Chapter 228: Demonic Beasts

For a full twenty years, the memory of Xu Yunfan consuming countless tonics to nourish his strength allowed his Qi to saturate every inch of his flesh and blood. Only then, when full to overflowing, did his Qi break through the barrier and merge into his flesh and blood.

Blood Transformation!

Xu Yunfan raised his hand, and with a thought, the dragon scale armor on his elbow began to layer and disperse, climbing all the way to his shoulder before stopping.

Xu Yunfan gazed at the dragon scale armor clinging to his shoulder. Beneath his skin, his blood vessels suddenly took on a golden luster.

As his thoughts flowed, the scorching sensation dormant in his flesh and blood surged up his spine, like thousands of streams of molten lava injecting into his blood vessels. He suddenly realized that the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Qi, which flowed through his flesh and blood, was now surging through his blood vessels in another form.

This was the true power of Blood Transformation, the strength of Qi and blood.

He could clearly feel every inch of his meridians trembling. The fierce Qi that once resided in his muscles had long since lost its edge, transforming into a long, thick, red-gold torrent that washed through his blood vessels with a thunderous roar.

The strength that once needed to be deliberately driven from his bones and muscles was now as natural as breathing. With every beat of his heart, the immense, dormant power flowed throughout his body with his blood.

Tapping his arm armor lightly with his fingertips, the dragon scale patterns pulsed in rhythm with his blood flow.

Xu Yunfan suddenly understood that this strange armor, which had accompanied his breakthrough, was not an external object. It was a manifestation formed when the Qi that had seeped into his blood over twenty years of bitter cultivation resonated with his new Qi and blood during the moment of Blood Transformation.

When the golden blood lines flowed past the Jianjing acupoint, he heard a roar like a river bursting its banks within his body.

It was a sign that his Qi had completely merged with his essence and blood.

The dark red, stale blood was being replaced by Qi and blood infused with his power. With every circulation, his blood took on a jade-like luster. The hidden injuries that once required medicinal herbs to nourish were healing at a visible rate. The legend of a Blood Transformation warrior having blood weighing a thousand pounds was now manifesting as a real, undeniable force within his meridians.

After stepping into the Blood Transformation realm, Xu Yunfan specifically consolidated his cultivation for a day or two. He saw that only a few thin wisps of spiritual mist remained in the air.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but exhale, raising his head to gaze into the distance.

Under the Dragon Seeking Pulse Discerning Method, seven strands of purple qi, varying in distance, rose like coiling dragons around pillars, piercing straight to the heavens.

These nodes where mountain ranges converged and spiritual energy gathered were all entwined with demonic浊气, similar to the old ape's cave.

The nearest spiritual energy gathering node was only two hundred miles away.

When the morning light pierced through the clouds, Xu Yunfan stood on the cliff of the Broken Dragon Cliff, staring at the spiritual energy gathering point that contained a hint of thick malevolent energy.

After weighing the situation in his heart and confirming it was something he could handle, he did not hesitate.

A two-hundred-mile journey was merely an hour's travel for a Blood Transformation warrior. At this moment, the tendons in his arches pulsed like a subterranean dragon turning over. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Qi spiraled up from his ankles, and with every step he took, he left an inch-deep crack in the rock.

"Rise!"

With a low shout that erupted like thunder from his throat, the tendons in his arches suddenly contracted into a crescent shape. His heel sank and shifted like a subterranean dragon turning over, and the force of the snapping tendon crushed the entire granite slab into a spiderweb pattern.

When the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Qi surged from his blood, Xu Yunfan finally experienced the true terror of the Blood Transformation realm. The Qi that once needed to be deliberately driven now seemed to transform into thirty-six red serpents. As they circulated with the blood through his bones, skin, and membranes, they spontaneously coiled and generated immense power.

His first leap crossed a thirty-zhang mountain stream.

The unintentional eruption of Qi caused the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer on his back to drag a purple-red afterimage in the high-speed movement. The thunderfire wrapped around the hammer head rubbed violently against the air, issuing a cry sharp like a dragon's roar.

Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that with every expansion of his arch, the force erupting from the sole of his foot could stamp out a visible ring of airwaves. These forces, refined by his blood and spontaneously transformed and driven, melted the rock into a glassy state upon contact, and then shattered it into radiating cracks under the subsequent impact.

No wonder, back at the Thousand Buddha Temple in Qingzhou, when he saw the Yinshan Sect master's Iron Melting Hand technique, he felt it was extraordinary. Only by stepping into the Muscle Refining realm, with Qi entering the blood, could one truly manifest the strange phenomena of martial arts.

The mountain wind turned into thunderous roars in his ears.

As his speed broke through a certain critical point, the muscles in Xu Yunfan's thighs suddenly swelled and stomped down. A ring of sonic boom clouds suddenly appeared around him. The muscles and tendons beneath the Hundred Tempered Steel Body writhed, and the dragon scale armor leaves opened and closed, tearing the oncoming wind pressure into絮状乱流 (floc-like turbulence).

The Eighth Rank Divine Weapon, the dragon scale armor he wore, increased his speed by at least half.

He deliberately chose the jagged mountain ridge as his path. Whenever the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Qi poured into his feet, the rocks would crumble layer by layer like a crisp pastry, kicking up a wave of stone ten zhang long behind him.

Passing by a pool of water, the strange phenomena caused by his speed reached their peak.

Xu Yunfan vaulted over a hundred-foot cold pond, his toes lightly touching the water three times. The spray from the first step had not yet fallen when the ring-shaped wave from the third step caught up, shaking the entire pond into a mist. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Qi rolled back up with the water, and after penetrating the waves, it carved three spiral grooves over a foot deep into the cliff wall on the shore.

The most breathtaking part was crossing the black pine forest.

The towering ancient trees, thick enough for twenty people to encircle, turned into a blurry gray-green curtain in his vision, yet Xu Yunfan advanced in a straight line as if entering an无人之境 (unmanned territory). Whenever he was about to collide with a tree trunk, a dull sound like crustal movement would erupt from his shoulder blades, and the Hundred Tempered Steel Body would drive his body to make an unnatural right-angle turn.

Pine needles kicked up by the air currents formed a tornado a hundred meters high. The footprints left on the tree bark were three inches deep, their edges still flashing with unextinguished thunderfire.

In just an hour, Xu Yunfan suddenly came to a halt before the Broken Dragon Cliff. The seven-foot heavy hammer plunged into the rock layer to buffer, still plowing a five-zhang-long trench in the ground. He looked down at his boots. The war boots formed by the dragon scale armor talismans spewed hot air, causing the surrounding green grass to bow low. The mountain rocks within a thirty-zhang radius were covered in spiderweb-like cracks, and every footprint was sunken like a meteor crater.

Xu Yunfan looked up.

A hundred-zhang mountain stream lay before him, spanning east to west. Black mist condensed from浊气 surged along the stream, corroding the thousand-year-old cypress trees on both banks into gnarled branches and trunks. The mountain range suddenly sank here, forming an inverted gourd-like valley. It perfectly gathered the mountain ranges from all directions into a node, and the spiritual energy thus flowed down the peaks, forming a gathering point in this valley.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. The mercury-like Qi and blood unique to the Blood Transformation realm flowed within him. His eyes seemed to brighten slightly. The Dragon Seeking Pulse Discerning Method allowed him to forcefully extract several strands of purple qi方位 from the foul demonic mist. The center of that spiritual energy node was deep within a cave behind a waterfall.

And behind the waterfall, a pair of pupils as large as lanterns were coldly watching this uninvited guest, Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but raise an eyebrow. This demonic beast was quite perceptive.

*Boom!*

The mountain stream suddenly exploded, kicking up a three-zhang-high curtain of water. A foul wind, carrying a black-scaled tiger claw, tore through the air and struck.

"Come on!"
