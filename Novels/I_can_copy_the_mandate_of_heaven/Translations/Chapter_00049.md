Chapter 49: Fairness

As the rain poured down outside, the droplets hit the leaves, washing away the wilted petals. Some were swept away, while others stuck to the muddy ground, only to be eventually submerged. Li Zhiming sat in his armchair, feeling the damp, chilly air fill his lungs. The humid atmosphere stirred his thoughts, and he couldn't help but reflect on his life.

After his master's passing, Li Zhiming had begun to ponder his fate. When he saw his "fourteen years of early demise" fate, he had wondered if this was the end of his journey. At that time, he was still young and didn't understand the concept of fate. Now, as he gazed at the rain-soaked ground, his eyes lost focus, and he was transported back to four years ago when he first saw his fate.

Li Zhiming recalled feeling no emotional response when he saw his fate. Fourteen years seemed like a distant number, and the entire village, including his family, had similar fates. However, when he saw the young boy, Xiao Pangdun, with a unique green fate, known as "spirit root," Li Zhiming felt a pang of jealousy. Why did Xiao Pangdun have it, and not him? Was it because of the heavens' decree?

As the rain continued to fall, Li Zhiming's fists clenched, and his palms began to ache. He thought about his efforts, both proactive and passive, to escape the small village. Had his fate truly changed? Li Zhiming wanted to say yes, but when he looked at his current fate, "wandering the rivers and lakes," he couldn't smile. The deep red fate of Han Li, always hovering before him, hinted at his own mediocrity.

Li Zhiming stood up, backing away from the rain, and gazed into the distance. "What do I truly desire?" he wondered. Just as he was lost in thought, Han Li interrupted him, "What are you thinking about?" Li Zhiming turned to see his companion's concerned expression.

"I was wondering if we're destined to be doctors in the Seven Mystic Gate forever," Li Zhiming replied. Han Li scratched his head, "Isn't that good enough? I'd be content being a doctor here and returning to my parents when I have the chance."

Li Zhiming felt a pang of frustration. Han Li, with his extraordinary fate, was content with a simple life, while he, Li Zhiming, with an ordinary fate, yearned for something more. "You're always so deep and serious," Han Li said, patting Li Zhiming's back. "Why don't you focus on your broken Seven Alpha Symbolic Power instead?"

Li Zhiming chuckled, "You insolent child!" He pretended to scold Han Li, lifting a nearby ruler.

In a distant location, far from the Seven Mystic Gate, a large river flowed, with numerous docks and bustling laborers unloading cargo. In a secluded courtyard, ten miles away, a man in a moon-white robe entered, his black hair cascading down his back. After verifying his identity, he proceeded to the inner courtyard, his footsteps echoing through the silence.

As he approached a room, he heard a woman's pitiful cries and paused, his expression a mix of disdain, anger, and helplessness. He knocked on the door, then stood back, gazing at the moon.

"Enter," a lazy, discontented voice replied from within. The man pushed open the door, his eyes adjusting to the dim light. He saw several women, some half-naked, others lying on the bed, their faces tear-stained and bruised. One woman, pale and slender, lay unconscious.

The man's gaze settled on a figure in the back, a man with a grotesque tumor on his face, his body exposed, with only a corner of the bedding covering his private parts. Su Zonguang knew these women were purchased from the Teaching Bureau, the families of officials implicated in a corruption case. They were meant to satisfy the "immortal's" twisted desires.

Su Zonguang's expression remained cold as he focused on the man, known as the Golden Lighted One, with a face disfigured by a terrible tumor.
