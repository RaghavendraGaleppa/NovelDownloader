## Chapter 22: Sorry, I'm in a Hurry

It was just lunchtime. Dozens of cultivators were already gathered at the entrance of Spirit Field 377, like a market fair. This number was less than half of what it used to be. During this period, thanks to Ding Rui's tireless work, the overall condition of the Mystic Talisman Sect's spirit fields was remarkably good, and the chances of problems occurring were getting smaller and smaller.

"Brother Rui is truly a lucky star for us cultivators of the Mystic Talisman Sect's spirit fields!"

"And Brother Rui's fees are too low. After cultivators practicing the 'Golden Radiance Art' and 'Verdant Wood Art' in our spirit fields discovered the large aphids, they started slacking off, completely pushing the task onto Brother Rui."

"Exactly! He's not making any profit from this. Why would Brother Rui do it?"

"Doesn't Brother Rui cultivate?"

"How could he have cultivated three different arts if he didn't cultivate? Brother Rui is going to become a Spirit Farmer cultivator."

"True, he must be a genius."

"How many spirit rice stalks did your spirit field reserve for Brother Rui?"

"300 stalks."

"Wow, that's too much! We only reserved 250 stalks."

...

Ding Rui had completely become the star of the entire spirit field area. Especially among the cultivators who had gathered at Spirit Field 377 to invite Ding Rui because of large aphid outbreaks in their fields, the only person they talked about was Ding Rui. Dong Feng listened to the constant chatter of "Ding Rui, Ding Rui," his face turning ashen, his fury growing even stronger. And just then, another whisper reached his ears.

"Brother Rui, come to our 233 today! Besides the large aphids, we've reserved 233 stalks of spirit rice."

"Come to our 333! We've reserved 333 stalks."

"You're going too far!"

"96 reserved 996 stalks! Who dares to compete with us!"

"Brother from 996, that's too many. Even if I went, I wouldn't have time to finish. You'll have to wait until next time." Ding Rui immediately refused the cultivator from Spirit Field 996.

Dong Feng finally managed to push his way through the crowd, but still couldn't get close to Ding Rui. So he roared at the top of his lungs, "Ding Rui, you must give me an explanation today!" Dong Feng had expected to shock everyone and then calmly negotiate with Ding Rui under their gazes. But when his voice came out, he realized how insignificant it was in the surging tide of noise. Aside from a few cultivators nearby giving him an annoyed glare, almost no one paid him any attention.

Wasting even a single breath could mean one more spirit rice stalk couldn't be saved. Spirit Field 66 was quite a distance from Spirit Field 377, and with a total of 666 spirit rice stalks, the quantity was considerable. Time was extremely tight for the entire midday period. Fortunately, the cultivators from Spirit Field 66 had hired two horse-riders when they came, so Ding Rui was directly taken away on horseback.

Dong Feng watched Ding Rui ride off on the horse, his eyes now bloodshot with fury. "How dare he disregard me!" Dong Feng thought, recalling how Ding Rui hadn't even truly looked him in the eye when speaking to him earlier, instead continuously chatting with other cultivators and even talking while walking. His anger intensified.

After seeing Ding Rui off, the cultivators gathered outside Spirit Field 377 also dispersed with a clamor. Dong Feng cast a deep gaze into Spirit Field 377 before turning and leaving. And just then, a few faint whispers of discussion reached Dong Feng's ears again.

"He can't handle things himself, yet he comes to trouble Brother Rui. This person is really sick."

"And Senior Brother Ding even apologized to him! I don't understand, what did Senior Brother Ding do wrong? Does that mean we should also blame Senior Brother Ding for earning extra spirit rice while we didn't, and demand an explanation from him? Haha, that's truly laughable."
