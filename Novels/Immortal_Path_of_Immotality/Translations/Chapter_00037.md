# Chapter 37: Preparing for the Journey  

"So you're saying you want me to go with you to the capital and oppose the immortal master at your headquarters?" Lin Shan's expression darkened.  

What a joke! After all this beating around the bush, this was your scheme all along!  

Chief Protector Jiang chuckled awkwardly. "Don't worry. From what I know, the immortal master enshrined at our headquarters is quite elderly. His status barely matches that of our Grand Elder, and his cultivation shouldn't surpass the Grand Elder's. You definitely won't lose to him!"  

The man began making bold promises, insisting that with Lin Shan's current strength, there would be no danger in going to Nightingale. Once he helped Chief Protector Jiang secure his position as an Elder at the headquarters, the organization would spare no effort in serving Lin Shan to his satisfaction.  

Lin Shan wasn't swayed by these empty promises. Even if Chief Protector Jiang became an Elder, he'd likely be the weakest among them. Lin Shan had no illusions about that. However, he had come to Tranquil Abode for a specific reason—he needed Chief Protector Jiang's help with something.  

Collecting Nightingale tokens.  

Back then, he had obtained an ancient token from the assassins Fatso and Tall-and-Thin. He was very interested in these centuries-old tokens from the ancient assassin organization. After all, ancient aura was crucial for his strength. Every bit counted when it came to enhancement.  

---  

"I agree, but let's be clear—I'm only going to back you up. Don't expect me to actually fight a cultivator head-on." With 8 points of ancient aura at his disposal, Lin Shan felt confident.  

Moreover, if Chief Protector Jiang was willing to return to the capital, the pressure couldn't be as overwhelming as imagined. Besides, Lin Shan himself was stuck at the third layer of Qi Refining and needed to venture out for opportunities.  

But first, he needed Chief Protector Jiang's cooperation, so he laid down the rules upfront to avoid being forced into a fight he couldn't win. Otherwise, he might have to resort to last-minute enhancements again.  

"Of course, of course! The opponent is just the immortal master's adopted son, not his real son. Since you're also an immortal master, he won't dare disrespect you. Besides, we're not going there to fight."  

Chief Protector Jiang was overjoyed that Lin Shan had agreed so readily and kept reassuring him.  

"As a condition for my help, there's something I need you to do first."  

Lin Shan subtly took control of the conversation, laying out his demands. Strength was the ultimate authority, and with his power, he had every right to set terms.  

Chief Protector Jiang nodded eagerly, promising to fulfill any request Lin Shan had. In the Nightingale's Southern Border branch, he was practically a local emperor.  

---  

When Lin Shan mentioned collecting the tokens, Chief Protector Jiang immediately thumped his chest in assurance—it was no problem at all.  

All they had to do was temporarily gather the tokens from the assassins under his command.  

Easy solution: issue everyone a new token, collect the old ones, and reward them with contribution points.  

While this might have been a hassle at headquarters, in the Southern Border branch, Chief Protector Jiang could easily accommodate Lin Shan's request.  

The two quickly reached an agreement. Chief Protector Jiang asked Lin Shan to wait a few days for news, and Lin Shan took his leave, returning to the Zhao residence to rest.  

---  

The Zhao family had recently shifted their focus to the antique and jade trade, having acquired nearly half of Zangke County's antiques—most of which were useless to Lin Shan.  

The remaining pieces had to be put to good use.  

As for Lin Shan, with nothing pressing to do, he spent his days refining his acupoints. Knowing he would soon leave Zangke for the capital, he asked the Zhao family if they had any enemies that needed dealing with.  

At this, Patriarch Zhao perked up immediately.  

Previously, as an advisor to the prefect, he had faced opposition from other advisors who banded together to exclude him due to the Zhao family's influence and his close relationship with the prefect.  

Lately, the prefect had begun distancing himself from Zhao, so he hoped Lin Shan could eliminate these rivals.  

"Why do you insist on being an advisor? You're the head of a prominent family," Lin Shan asked, puzzled.  

Patriarch Zhao sighed bitterly.  

"Zangke County is different from other places. In wartime, it's a frontier; in peacetime, it's a trade hub. Plus, there are several garrisons stationed here. During war, the court sends generals to take command, but in peacetime, the prefect controls everything.  

"The prefect here is practically a warlord, holding power over military, governance, finances, and trade. If I don't align with him, how can the Zhao family thrive here?"  

Lin Shan nodded indifferently. "Fine, list the names, and I'll take care of them for you."  

---  

"These are the people you want me to eliminate?"  

Lin Shan stared at Patriarch Zhao in disbelief. Had this guy listed every enemy he'd ever made in his life under the guise of being the prefect's advisor?  

- Wang Family Patriarch, Wang Yuming  
- Zhang Family Patriarch, Zhang Renbao  
- Li Family Patriarch, Li Shengtai  
- Tie Family Patriarch, Tie Jiacheng  
- Deputy Magistrate of Yangze County, Liu Huaijin  
- Garrison Commander, Fang Zhennan  
- ...  

The long list made Lin Shan's head spin. Were all these prominent figures in Zangke County really enemies of the Zhao family?  

---  

Patriarch Zhao poured out his grievances:  

Some families competed with the Zhaos in business.  
Some patriarchs hired bandits to raid Zhao trade caravans.  
Some officials passed policies targeting the Zhao family.  
Some military officers deliberately provoked conflicts.  

"Enough, enough! Stop! Are you sure there won't be consequences if I eliminate all these people?"  

"None at all! You have your Nightingale assassin identity, right? The assassins will take the blame, the employer who commissioned the hits will remain anonymous, and it won't trace back to you!"  

"You really think Nightingale can act so recklessly without repercussions? Wouldn't the organization be destroyed if it angered everyone?" Lin Shan remained skeptical. If this were possible, the world would have descended into chaos long ago.  

"Fine, then just warn them."  

Patriarch Zhao hadn't seriously expected Lin Shan to kill so many people—he was just testing the waters. Seeing Lin Shan unwilling to spill too much blood, he settled for the next best option.  

Lin Shan gave Patriarch Zhao a strange look. This guy clearly needed more discipline. Was he trying to trick Lin Shan into provoking everyone so they could gang up on him?  

Still, the Zhao family had helped him collect 8 points of ancient aura. Lin Shan might return to the Southern Border in the future to gather more, so it was worth keeping this connection.  

Over the next few days, Lin Shan personally visited everyone on the list, serving as a warning.  

Upon learning that the Zhao family had not only gained a Xiantian expert's backing but that the expert was willing to act personally, these people quickly ceased their schemes against the Zhaos.  

With this matter settled, Chief Protector Jiang soon sent word for Lin Shan to visit him.  

---  

In the grand hall on the fourth floor, Chief Protector Jiang pointed at two large chests on the ground.  

"Here you go—184 tokens, as requested."  

Lin Shan rubbed his hands excitedly but hesitated when he noticed others present.  

He wanted Chief Protector Jiang to leave, but this was his territory—kicking him out would be rude.  

But if Chief Protector Jiang stayed, what if he saw the tokens turn to dust when Lin Shan absorbed their ancient aura?  

Fortunately, Chief Protector Jiang had some tact. Noticing Lin Shan's lingering gaze, he chuckled awkwardly and excused himself.  

Only then did Lin Shan relax. His golden finger's secret must never be exposed!  

The only person who had ever witnessed it was Scarface—Lin Shan had been forced to enhance a weapon in front of him. But since Scarface was dead, the secret remained safe.  

After confirming no one else was around, Lin Shan began his search.  

---  

Half an hour later, he set down the last token, disappointed. This haul had yielded only 3 points—far less than expected. Many older tokens must have been lost, with most being recent replacements.  

Though Nightingale was an ancient assassin organization, its token-based recognition system was more of a curiosity in the jianghu. Few actually managed to find and join.  

When Chief Protector Jiang returned, Lin Shan nodded at him.  

"If everything's ready, we'll set out for the capital the day after tomorrow."  

"Agreed!"
