## Chapter 22: The Map

The stone room was spacious, with a bed, numerous dusty books on the walls, and several dirty buckets filled with torn letters. A large, dusty map hung on the wall, and the two of them wandered around the room, searching for secrets.

Li Zhi'ming soon found himself standing in front of the wall, gazing at the map. It was unfamiliar, and it didn't seem to be a map of the Qixuan Gate. He became engrossed in it, lost in thought.

Meanwhile, Han Li was carefully searching around, as if he was exploring a treasure house. Every move he made was deliberate and cautious, as if he was afraid of leaving any traces behind. Despite his carefulness, he moved with a quiet agility, careful not to disturb the dust or leave behind any fingerprints.

As Li Zhi'ming entered the stone room, he was immediately captivated by the map. Having spent some time in the Qixuan Gate, his horizons had broadened, and he had a general idea of his surroundings. The map, however, was something else entirely. It seemed to be a much larger-scale map, showing a vast area with numerous mountains and a few small plains. The Qixuan Gate, which Li Zhi'ming called home, was just a tiny spot on the map.

The map was so enormous that it made Li Zhi'ming feel like he was seeing the world for the first time. He felt a surge of excitement and curiosity, and his eyes wandered to Han Li, who was busy searching through the bookshelves.

Li Zhi'ming had known Han Li for two years, and he had gained a deeper understanding of his companion's personality. He knew that Han Li would explore the world extensively in the future, visiting places that Li Zhi'ming could hardly imagine.

As Li Zhi'ming continued to study the map, he noticed some small notes made by Mo Dafu. He studied the symbols and markings, trying to decipher their meaning. He assumed that the wavy lines represented rivers, the angular marks indicated mountains, and the empty spaces signified plains.

Upon closer inspection, Li Zhi'ming discovered that one of the marked areas seemed to be the Qixuan Gate. However, it was oriented differently than he remembered. He realized that the map needed to be rotated to match his recollection. Once he did that, the map made more sense.

The map revealed a massive plain, marked with four characters, and several other locations marked with different symbols. Li Zhi'ming was fascinated and wanted to memorize every detail. He called out to Han Li, but his friend didn't respond.

As Li Zhi'ming continued to examine the map, he noticed a red mark near the Qixuan Gate. He studied it carefully and estimated the distance. To his surprise, it was approximately 240 miles away, a staggering distance that seemed impossible to cover.

The map's enormity left Li Zhi'ming breathless. He wondered how someone could create such a comprehensive map. A thought occurred to him: could it be that the map was drawn by an immortal?

Li Zhi'ming's eyes widened as he stared at the map, his mind racing with the implications. If the map was genuine, it must have been created by an immortal. The thought sent shivers down his spine.

Standing before the massive map, 10-year-old Li Zhi'ming felt a sense of awe and wonder. He gazed at the Qixuan Gate, which seemed insignificant compared to the vast expanse of the map. His home, Dongxiang Village, was too small to leave a mark on the map.

Li Zhi'ming's thoughts turned to his own命格, "Small Rich Peasant." The label no longer filled him with pride but instead evoked a sense of sadness.

He pondered the red mark on the map, wondering what it signified and why Mo Dafu had noted it specifically. Lost in thought, Li Zhi'ming stood there, mesmerized by the map's secrets.
