# Chapter 99: Fate's Wonderful Ways

Musu was confined in a cage adjacent to Zhoutian. After the energy construct departed, Zhoutian entered Musu's cage.

The moment Musu saw Zhoutian, his eyes widened in instant fury. Without caring how Zhoutian had entered, he lunged forward, charging at Zhoutian, his previous aloof demeanor completely gone.

"Calm down," Zhoutian said helplessly. Since the cage restricted the use of extraordinary powers, Musu's speed wasn't particularly fast. Zhoutian instantly teleported away.

Musu's long hair was dishevelled, his eyes fixed intently on Zhoutian. His hands were covered in mud. As if he hadn't heard Zhoutian, he readjusted his direction and lunged fiercely again. Though unsupported by extraordinary power, Musu's physical foundation was formidable, giving him the impression of a fierce tiger pouncing on its prey.

Unfortunately for him, he had met Zhoutian. With a swift teleportation, Zhoutian was out of the cage. Musu lunged at empty air, panting heavily in place, his body bearing several wounds, likely inflicted by some power, which remained unhealed.

Zhoutian pointed to his own head, pressing downwards, signaling Musu to calm down. He waited for about half an hour, seeing that Musu had likely completely calmed down, as he sat on the ground with his eyes closed.

Entering Musu's cage once more, Zhoutian chuckled awkwardly. "Captain Musu, I never expected our paths to cross again here. Fate is truly marvelous."

Musu didn't open his eyes, afraid that seeing Zhoutian's face would reignite his anger. Hearing Zhoutian's words, he clenched his fists and coldly snorted, "Thanks to Young Master Lian, I'm no longer a captain." He deliberately emphasized the name 'Lian'.

"Oh? Is that so? Well, that's truly excellent then. How could someone as valiant as our Musu be relegated to a mere captain's position?" Zhoutian said in a tone that seemed to be genuinely considering Musu's best interests.

A vein bulged on Musu's forehead. He couldn't hold back anymore. How could such a shameless person exist in this world?

"Is there something wrong with your head? Why did you cause such a huge commotion in front of the Central Grand Cathedral? You... you're simply unreasonable!" Musu's face flushed crimson. He stood up from the ground, so enraged he didn't know what to say.

Musu felt utterly bitter. Who had he offended? He was simply sitting at home when trouble came raining down from the sky. He had been diligently practicing his martial arts when a group of people suddenly burst in and thoroughly beat him. He had initially thought that the Evil God's cultists had already invaded Salar City and was about to resist, but then they claimed he was colluding with heretics.

It took him a long time to figure out that Zhoutian, that scoundrel, had caused the uproar at the Central Grand Cathedral, even declaring himself a "Voodoo cultist." The Holy Church then followed the clues, leading them to Musu. Not only had Zhoutian brought people in, but he had also had extensive contact with Musu in Salar City.

And now what? Could the Holy Church tolerate this? It turned out this brat was an internal traitor, leading enemies here. They immediately subjected him to a severe beating and planned to kill him later.

"When you told me the location of the Tribunal, you should have guessed I was going to cause trouble. Besides, you lied to me once; you said the Tribunal was underground in the cathedral. This place doesn't look like it's underground at all," Zhoutian grumbled.

"Are you blaming me?" Musu's voice rose three octaves. He admitted he had indeed guessed Zhoutian would cause trouble when he told him, but he thought Zhoutian would plan secretly and act covertly. Who could have imagined he would be so crude?

"My fault... my fault... I didn't think it through," Zhoutian honestly confessed his mistake. It was already quite benevolent of Musu to help him gather information, even if it turned out to be inaccurate.

"But looking at it from another angle, at least you're still alive. That's already a blessing in misfortune."

"If it weren't for you, I wouldn't even have misfortune! Now, everyone thinks I've forsaken the Lord. How can I face my parents and friends?" Musu's spirits were low.

"Oh, come on, still spouting about the Lord. You're just a superficial believer. If you truly cared about your Lord, you wouldn't have helped me inquire about the Tribunal's location," Zhoutian scoffed.

Musu's lips trembled twice, as if wanting to retort, but in the end, he closed them dejectedly. What Zhoutian said was completely true.

Since childhood, in their family, the greatest wasn't his parents, nor himself, but a vague, ethereal Lord. He didn't know why, but seeing the attitude of his family and friends around him, he dared not ask. But he always wanted to ask one thing: Why? By what right?!

"Haha, interesting. A member of the Holy Church who doesn't believe in the Holy Lord." A burst of laughter came, and Anduin looked in their direction. He had been listening to Zhoutian and Musu's conversation.

"Who is he?" Musu asked with a frown.

"A fallen demigod."

Musu's face registered surprise. A god? This was the first time he had truly seen a god, even if only a demigod.

Zhoutian relayed the information he had just received to him, including the situation of their current location and Anduin's story.

Musu's surprise grew even more after listening. He stared intently at Anduin, a divine descendant, one with the blood of a god flowing within him.

"Don't stare at him like he's a monkey in a zoo. It's rude," Zhoutian tugged Musu.

Anduin's face stiffened. *Actually, I hadn't felt anything before, but your comment just made me uncomfortable.*

"Where were we? Oh, right... what's your purpose?" Zhoutian recalled the topic that had been interrupted.

"My purpose is very simple: to get out of here," Anduin said frankly.

"You make it sound as easy as drinking soup," Zhoutian scoffed. "I thought this place was truly underground, but now I don't even know where this is. I myself can't get out."

Anduin didn't understand what Zhoutian not knowing the location or being unable to get out had to do with his own purpose, but he still continued, "I had lost all hope. Although this place isn't guarded, the seals on these cages are truly ancient, left behind from antiquity, far beyond what a fallen divine descendant like me can break. Until I met you, you gave me hope—the hope of getting out."

"Tell me your method," Zhoutian raised an eyebrow, intrigued.

"I can use my divine nature to temporarily demonize the energy construct, but it has its own protective mechanism, so I can't control it. The Holy Church will definitely send people down to investigate. Since it's their own people coming down, the spatial channel won't be opened briefly but for an extended period. That's your chance to get out."

"What about you?" Zhoutian asked. He wouldn't be so naive as to think the other party went to such great lengths just to send him out.

Anduin casually tore a piece of cloth from his body, then bit his finger, squeezing out a drop of blood that shimmered with faint golden light. The blood dripped onto the cloth, instantly dyeing it a strange crimson, like fire, scattered with golden specks.

"Take this cloth. Go far away from Salar City. My followers will find you. Just give this cloth to them."
