# Chapter 34: Forced to Sign a Slave Contract, Immediate Suicide

“Such a majestic stone lion.”

The Zhuang Gate looked small from afar but large up close. It stood tall, a full zhang high, with bronze rivets and vermilion lacquer adorning the entrance, projecting an imposing aura. It was like a gaping, bloody maw ready to swallow people whole.

Standing outside the gate, Li Xiaofan felt a wave of oppression. Thinking that his brother lived in such a place, his resolve hardened even further.

After hesitating for a moment, he gently knocked on the door.

“In the middle of winter, I wonder which master has graced us with their presence.”

A grumbling voice came from inside, followed by the creaking of the large door being pulled open.

The one who opened the door was a head laborer, responsible for clearing the snow from the courtyard. When snow melts, it clumps together, making it difficult to sweep. However, compared to other laborer tasks, this was much easier.

Those who managed to secure such jobs were veteran laborers.

These laborers were initially bowing and scraping with fawning smiles, but upon seeing the visitor's tattered and dirty clothes—looking even worse than themselves—their expressions instantly flipped.

“Kid, who are you?” one laborer shouted impatiently. “We aren't hiring laborers right now.”

“Look at that frail body of yours; a gust of wind could knock you over. You can't do any work. Get lost quickly, and don't die at the entrance. We'd have to clean up your mess,” another laborer added.

With that, they moved to shut the door.

“Big brothers, you've misunderstood,” Li Xiaofan exhaled a puff of hot air and rubbed his hands together. “I'm looking for someone. Could I trouble you to pass on a message for me?”

His voice was young but polite.

“Looking for someone?” The laborer frowned and turned to shout behind him. “Master Bi, there's an outsider kid here who wants to find someone. Should we send him away or…”

Bi Hao, leaning on a crutch, rose from a wooden chair. His injuries from his previous fight with Li Xian were severe, and he had only just managed to get out of bed these past few days.

“Looking for someone?” Bi Hao was also puzzled.

It was rare to see relatives coming to look for someone who had sold themselves into servitude.

“Who are you looking for?” Bi Hao asked with great interest.

Li Xiaofan said earnestly, “I'm about to take the winter examination and will be leaving Qingning County. My brother is in the manor. I want to see him one last time.”

“What's your brother's name? If he's a laborer, he might be dead for all we know,” Bi Hao mocked.

“No, no, that can't be. My brother is already a guard,” Li Xiaofan denied repeatedly.

“Oh…” Bi Hao's brow furrowed. “So he's a guard now.” The mocking tone in his voice diminished significantly.

“My brother's name is Li Xian. Big brother… could I trouble you to go notify him?” Li Xiaofan pleaded.

“Li… Xian?” Bi Hao's expression changed, but he immediately suppressed it. “Are you sure your brother's name is Li Xian?”

“What's wrong?” Li Xiaofan grew nervous.

“Nothing… it's nothing. Wait here for a moment.” Bi Hao signaled to the few laborers with his eyes. Then, leaning on his crutch, he hurriedly left.

Those laborers were all heads of their respective crews. They lacked other skills, but they were very close to Bi Hao and understood his intentions. They immediately dispersed silently, intentionally or unintentionally blocking Li Xiaofan's path.

“Uncle, Uncle!”

Bi Hao hurriedly found Steward Luo Fang.

Luo Fang frowned and waved his hand dismissively. “Get lost, get lost. You're a pain to look at.”

“Uncle, just hear me out.” Bi Hao briefly explained the situation at the main gate.

“Oh…” Luo Fang raised an eyebrow, and a sinister plan surfaced in his mind. “In that case, isn't this a blessing in disguise?”

“Uncle, what do you mean?” Bi Hao pressed.

“You useless thing. You're foolish and clumsy, but you do have one good quality.” Luo Fang clasped his hands behind his back and paced back and forth, as if devising a grand strategy.

“You're obedient and never make decisions on your own.”

“Li Xian's younger brother has come out. We just need to trick him into signing a slave contract and make him a laborer. Wouldn't that give us a hold over Li Xian?”

Bi Hao's eyes widened in delight. “Uncle, you are truly the smartest man under heaven!”

“Hahaha, you flatter me, you flatter me.” Luo Fang laughed heartily. “Prepare the contract, and let's hurry to the front gate.”

Not long after.

At the front gate, Luo Fang indeed saw Li Xiaofan. He noticed the boy's clothes were dirty and disheveled, but his eyes were bright, and his features bore a slight resemblance to Li Xian.

“Young man, you want to see your brother?” Luo Fang's smile was gentle, but a knife was hidden within it.

“Mm, is that possible?” Li Xiaofan asked tentatively.

“Well… that's a bit difficult. The manor has rules; outsiders are not allowed to enter privately,” Luo Fang feigned difficulty.

Li Xiaofan sighed softly and gazed into the manor. If that were the case, the news of his upcoming exam would never reach his brother.

“However…” Luo Fang deliberately dragged out his voice and produced a piece of paper. “If you want to see your brother, signing this paper will allow you to enter the manor. Then I can take you to see him.”

Li Xiaofan only glanced at it and recognized it as a slave contract.

His heart sank, and his thoughts raced. Although he was young, he was not foolish; his thinking was quite sharp.

“That laborer said earlier that they aren't hiring laborers right now. This man came running as soon as he heard my brother's name, trying to force me to sign a slave contract.”

“He probably has a grudge against my brother and wants to use me to control him. Brother said the manor is full of wild beasts, and he was right!”

Li Xiaofan pretended to be naive. “Oh no… I ate some wild fruit on the way, and my stomach hurts terribly. I need to use the restroom, then I'll come back and sign. Gentlemen, please wait for me, I beg you.”

“Hahaha.” Luo Fang stroked his short goatee. “No problem, no problem. Go ahead.”

Li Xiaofan broke out in a cold sweat and turned to run. Luo Fang waited for a moment and sensed something was wrong. It was winter, and looking around, everything was a vast expanse of white.

It wasn't hard to see that Li Xiaofan had already started sprinting away. Luo Fang cursed, “Damn it, that brat is trying to run. Get him back for me!”

“What are you standing there for? Go after him… Ouch…” Bi Hao, seeing this, grew anxious and kicked one of the laborers beside him. The action aggravated his injuries, making him grimace in pain.

Several head laborers quickly gave chase. Li Xiaofan had short legs and was small, and he was weighed down by adult-sized clothes. How could he outrun them?

He was quickly caught and brought back.

“Force his hand onto the seal,” Luo Fang said coldly.

“No way!” Li Xiaofan was like a trapped beast, struggling frantically. Unfortunately, the others were too many, and his limbs were firmly pinned down.

“Ah!”

He suddenly saw an opportunity and bit down hard. A laborer cried out in pain and let go. Li Xiaofan scrambled to his feet and tried to run again.

“You little bastard. If I can't deal with the big bastard, can't I deal with you?”

Luo Fang was also angry now. These two brothers were truly troublesome.

He leaped forward and grabbed the back of Li Xiaofan's neck. Channeling his internal energy, he rendered all of Li Xiaofan's struggles useless.

He held Li Xiaofan's hand and activated his internal strength. Blood was forced from the tip of the boy's index finger, heading straight for the paper contract.

“Hahaha.”

Li Xiaofan suddenly laughed, staring coldly at Luo Fang. “You want to use me against my brother? Dream on! If you press my seal down, I'll kill myself right here!”

He completely stopped resisting.

Hearing these words, Luo Fang felt an inexplicable chill run down his spine.

He hadn't expected the brothers to be so stubborn. If that were truly the case, wouldn't his plan backfire?

“Heh, you little bastard, still trying to act tough.” Luo Fang was about to press the finger down for good.

Just then, he suddenly felt a hand land on his shoulder. The five fingers clamped down with force, as if digging right into his flesh and blood.
