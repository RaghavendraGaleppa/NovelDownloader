# Chapter 229: Inventory  

The computer room space was now devoid of corpses, leaving only the spoils of battle scattered across the floor.  

Among them was an old prayer bracelet belonging to Jue Tu the Buddha, densely inscribed with Sanskrit scriptures. When Li Shimin picked it up, a wave of tranquility washed over him. The bracelet seemed to have been blessed by a high monk, possessing a soothing effect on the mind.  

One shouldn’t underestimate the bracelet’s function. With his formidable spiritual power—nearly on par with a Golden Core cultivator after developing divine sense—the fact that the bracelet could calm his mind suggested it would be equally effective for Golden Core cultivators. Such an artifact, capable of influencing Golden Core-level practitioners, was likely a relic passed down by a Buddhist master.  

Unfortunately, Li Shimin wasn’t a Buddhist and couldn’t identify the bracelet’s origins. After scanning it with his divine sense and finding no hidden imprints, he simply wore it on his wrist. One advantage of divine sense was that any imprints left by Golden Core or Arhat-level cultivators wouldn’t escape his detection.  

This mind-calming treasure was comparable in value to the Nourishing Spirit Jade—both required long-term wear to fully manifest their effects.  

Jue Tu the Buddha had carried a *Bai Na* bag, a unique spatial storage item used by Buddhist cultivators. Upon opening it, Li Shimin found it sparsely filled—no magical instruments, only a dozen or so jade bottles containing calming pills and some personal belongings. Were it not for these pills, this would have been the poorest spatial storage he’d ever seen.  

Jue Tu didn’t use magical instruments, so he carried none. His need to constantly suppress his killing intent made these pills indispensable. Though Li Shimin didn’t recognize the pills’ names, their effects suggested they were demon-suppressing elixirs—an incredibly valuable commodity.  

These pills contained third-grade materials, classifying them as third-grade elixirs, though their quality varied from high to low. This wasn’t surprising; even master alchemists couldn’t guarantee perfect success or consistent quality when refining third-grade pills.  

Despite Jue Tu’s reliance on his own strength for his path of slaughter-enlightenment, the items he carried—the bracelet and the pills—were both third-grade treasures, each worth more than the entire fortune of some elite disciples.  

Next, Li Shimin turned his attention to the spatial ring left behind by Elder Lü. Probing it with his divine sense, he felt a strange sensation.  

This was his third spatial ring, meaning he had now killed three Golden Core cultivators.  

The ring was specially crafted, divided into two completely separate spaces: one for ordinary storage and another for housing corpses.  

No wonder Elder Lü had summoned an Iron Corpse without carrying a corpse pouch—this ring was an advanced version, something Li Shimin hadn’t known existed.  

When his divine sense entered the corpse space, he nearly dropped the ring in shock.  

The cylindrical space, five meters high and ten meters in radius, contained ten corpses standing motionless. The floor was engraved with intricate formation patterns—a third-grade corpse-nurturing array from the *Moonlight Corpse Scroll*.  

What horrified him was that among the ten corpses, one was a Silver Corpse, while the others were Iron Corpses on the verge of advancement. If unleashed, these corpses could easily overwhelm him—the Silver Corpse alone matched a Golden Core cultivator in combat power.  

Given Elder Lü’s mid-Golden Core strength, this Silver Corpse was undoubtedly his main battle asset, possibly even stronger than Elder Lü himself.  

Shaking his head to regain composure, Li Shimin reminded himself that the corpses were dormant in the space, their activity suppressed after their master’s death. The nurturing array kept them in an optimal state for growth.  

Elder Lü had summoned one Iron Corpse during the battle, which had become inert after his death. Li Shimin had stored it in a corpse pouch for later study.  

He had thought his own collection of corpses was substantial, but compared to Elder Lü’s, it was insignificant.  

Unfortunately, he couldn’t bind these Iron Corpses yet. Their late-stage peak Iron Corpse cultivation (equivalent to late-stage Foundation Building) made them too risky for his early-stage Foundation Building self to contract, even with divine sense.  

"I must train harder," Li Shimin muttered, eyes gleaming with excitement. "Once I reach late-stage Foundation Building, I’ll bind all these Iron Corpses!"  

He could already envision summoning Nezha (his three-headed, six-armed Iron Corpse) alongside ten—no, eleven (including Jue Tu’s corpse)—Iron Corpses in battle. Twelve Iron Corpses would form a formidable force.  

He even added a new research topic to IBMz15’s database: how to deploy these twelve Iron Corpses in a formation for maximum combat efficiency.  

For now, he stored Nezha and the lone Iron Corpse in the spatial ring’s corpse space, designating it as his personal corpse repository.  

Nezha was only at the early Iron Corpse stage—the highest Li Shimin could currently handle. If Nezha reached peak Iron Corpse strength before Li Shimin advanced to mid-Foundation Building, he’d have to remove it from the space.  

The corpse space alone made this ring a treasure trove.  

"Golden Core elders from major sects truly have the best loot," he mused.  

Next, he turned his divine sense to the storage space, where a large flying boat immediately caught his attention.  

He didn’t retrieve it but scanned it thoroughly. Large flying boats were never personal possessions—this one belonged to the Netherworld Sect, not Elder Lü.  

Constructed from third-grade materials for the frame and second-grade materials for the rest, reinforced with numerous second- and third-grade formations, this flying boat could withstand multiple Golden Core-level attacks.  

Unlike the ordinary vessel he’d seen on Heavenly Island, this was a treasure-grade flying boat—practically a magical artifact.  

Though classified as a treasure, its unique design allowed even an early Foundation Building cultivator like Li Shimin to operate it. It didn’t rely on the user’s spiritual power for normal flight, instead drawing energy from stored spirit stones.  

"This is just a big toy," Li Shimin concluded.  

And yet, who could resist owning a flying boat? Back when he first joined the sect, he’d marveled at the flying boat that transported new disciples. Now, he owned one far superior—fulfilling a youthful dream.  

Beside the large boat was a sleek black personal flying boat—Elder Lü’s private vessel.  

Another treasure-grade artifact, this one required refinement before use.  

"All these eye-catching treasures," Li Shimin sighed, withdrawing his divine sense.  

The greatest frustration of looting Golden Core cultivators was acquiring items beyond his current capabilities.  

Near the black flying boat were the jade ruler and flying sword treasures he’d seen earlier, along with a miniature mountain-shaped artifact.  

The jade ruler was Elder Lü’s lifebound treasure, which he hadn’t reabsorbed into his Golden Core due to contamination from Jue Tu’s attack. Fortunately, this meant Li Shimin could access it—had it been stored in the Golden Core, retrieval would’ve been impossible.  

Not that he could use it anyway.  

As an early Foundation Building cultivator, Li Shimin viewed these treasures with more resignation than excitement.  

Apart from the lifebound flying sword given to his clone Li Yuanba, he already possessed a chessboard treasure and a zither treasure—an absurd collection for his level.  

Most Golden Core cultivators only owned one or two treasures. Elder Lü, as a Netherworld Sect elder, had three, making him exceptionally wealthy.  

The flying sword and miniature mountain treasures’ exact capabilities remained unknown to Li Shimin, so he moved on.  

Next, he found stacks of jade slips—many ancient, likely collected by Elder Lü.  

Most contained historical records and Elder Lü’s personal notes, indicating their importance to him.  

Elder Lü wasn’t an ordinary demonic cultivator; his sect residence was secure enough that he only carried essential items.  

One jade slip stood out.  

At first glance, it seemed ordinary, but its contents related to Sword Elder’s Ten Thousand Swords Peak.  

Elder Lü had meticulously researched methods for refining mountain-type treasures, collecting detailed data on Ten Thousand Swords Peak—including engravings, formations, and positional markings.  

Ten Thousand Swords Peak had been refined as a treasure, though not for personal use but as a legacy artifact.  

Elder Lü’s notes revealed his long-standing ambition to refine it into a combat-oriented mountain treasure. He’d even practiced by creating his own miniature mountain treasure—the one in his collection.  

Dissatisfied with its power (unable to suppress late-Golden Core foes), Elder Lü believed refining Ten Thousand Swords Peak would yield a treasure potent enough to remain formidable even at the Nascent Soul stage.  

Beyond standard mountain treasure suppression, Ten Thousand Swords Peak’s sword intent would simultaneously restrain and erode enemies—a terrifying combination.  

Why had Elder Lü targeted Ten Thousand Swords Peak? Did he know Sword Elder would abandon it?  

The answers died with Elder Lü, but Li Shimin wondered if other Golden Core elders coveted the peak.  

The nearby crates of materials suddenly made sense—they were for refining Ten Thousand Swords Peak, including rare third-grade components. According to the notes, Elder Lü had gathered everything needed.  

"What was he planning?" Li Shimin grew increasingly uneasy.  

Elder Lü must have been certain Sword Elder would relinquish the peak—otherwise, why stockpile so many materials? Even for a Netherworld Sect elder, this would’ve been arduous.  

Li Shimin relayed his findings to clone Li Yuanba, who’d have to navigate Netherworld Sect politics alone.  

The ring also contained pills and materials. The demonic pills, infused with unsavory ingredients, were unusable to him but could be traded later.  

The materials, though lacking third-grade items, were diverse and useful—ranging from formation and artifact-crafting components to alchemical ingredients. While not exceptionally valuable, they’d serve Li Shimin well.
