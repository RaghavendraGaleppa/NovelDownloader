Chapter 409: One Night of Cultivation Equals Half a Month of Bitter Training

"Here, take this," she said, sticking one of the tokens to his waist. The icy touch instantly transformed into a warm current that enveloped his entire body.

The guards at the city gate saw the talisman and didn't even bother to question them. They immediately knelt to the ground, respectfully welcoming the three of them into the city.

On both sides of the bluestone streets, the vendors hurriedly lowered their heads and packed up their stalls. A child curiously peered out but was immediately pulled inside by his mother.

"The might of immortals is like a prison," Xu Yunfan murmured, looking at the talisman in his hand. He thought of the ordinary people in the Divine Martial Realm who feared martial artists—how they would basically avoid anyone carrying a sword or saber at all costs.

In any world, the fate of ants is always similar.

Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath, suppressing the thoughts rising in his heart.

Hua Ling led the two of them through several deep, winding alleys with practiced ease, arriving at a secluded residence in the southern part of the city.

Pushing open the mottled wooden door, the courtyard inside, though slightly worn, was clean and tidy.

"Two Senior Brothers, please rest here for the night. We'll set out at dawn tomorrow. I've been to the place where the Heavenly Heart Snow Lotus grows before, so I still have some impression of it," Hua Ling said with a smile, the tension in her brows easing slightly. "This is just a mission to pick the Heavenly Heart Snow Lotus. Compared to fighting for our lives with those Righteous Path cultivators, it's much easier. The contribution points are also quite generous. Finally, I can catch my breath and enjoy a bit of free time."

Xu Yunfan's eyes shifted slightly, and he suddenly asked, "How many contribution points did Junior Sister borrow from the Joy Pavilion?"

Hua Ling's expression froze, a hint of bitterness flashing in her eyes. "Senior Brother, you may not know this, but in the Primordial Origin Sect, just the cost required to condense the first strand of true energy is staggering. If I didn't borrow from the Joy Pavilion, I'm afraid..."

She paused, her voice growing softer. "If you fall behind one step, it becomes harder with every step after. In the end, you waste your years and, for your entire life, find it difficult to even glimpse the doorway, becoming nothing more than a disposable tool in others' hands."

The Primordial Origin Sect has always valued the worth of its disciples. If a disciple fails to repay their loan on time, once the deadline passes, enforcers from the Joy Pavilion will come to collect the debt in person.

At that time, they will not only reclaim the borrowed contribution points with interest but also, if the debt is truly unpayable, extract every last bit of the borrower's essence, blood, flesh, and bones, along with their three souls and seven spirits.

Peeling the marrow and skin is a common practice; refining the soul and seizing the spirit is what truly shows their skill.

In the eyes of the Primordial Origin Sect, a cultivator's entire body is a treasure, not a single bit of which can be wasted.

As Hua Ling spoke, she lowered her head to brush at non-existent dust on her sleeves, complaining somewhat, "I had to deal with those cultivators from the Xuanfu Sect today and got covered in dust. I'll need to take a good bath later."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly and didn't ask further. Having a place to stay is naturally far better than spending the night in the wild. The fact that she could have such a secret stronghold in a mortal city controlled by Righteous Path cultivators was enough to show that Hua Ling definitely had a powerful backer supporting her.

Although this residence had no spiritual energy fluctuations, in the perilous world of cultivation, who could say such a place wouldn't be useful?

Hua Ling pushed open the lacquered door with gold inlay, and in the center of the courtyard, amidst withered lotuses, a hot spring was steaming with mist.

As Hua Ling lightly undid her silk robe, she suddenly looked back, her eyes sparkling with a hint of mischief. "Senior Brother has been on the road and is covered in dust. Why don't we bathe together? This spring water is drawn from an underground spring a hundred zhang deep. It doesn't do much for cultivation, but it can relieve fatigue and relax the spirit."

Her fingertips traced the water's surface, sending out ripples. "Senior Brother seems to cultivate pure Yang... soaking in this hot spring can also stimulate it a bit."

As she spoke, her delicate hand lightly lifted, and her ruqun slid down her shoulder, revealing jade-like skin.

Amidst the steam of the hot spring, the silver bell at her waist remained strangely silent, only the sound of water droplets sliding down her collarbone was clear.

She stepped barefoot into the pool, and her close-fitting white ruqun became transparent upon contact with the water.

Beside her, Li Ergou had already fled like he'd seen a ghost the moment Hua Ling pushed the door open.

Meeting Hua Ling's slightly provocative gaze, the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up. "Then I won't refuse."

His right hand rested on the jade belt at his waist, and his black outer robe slid down like flowing water, revealing the dark golden dragon scale armor underneath.

The armor scales clanged with the sound of jade and metal, casting a cold glint in the twilight.

With a soft rustle of the scales, the dragon scale armor, like a living thing, began to decompose from his shoulders. As the scales fell, they piled up on the ground like a small hill, revealing a body as solid as cast iron.

Hua Ling's eyes grew even brighter, filled with a watery light that seemed ready to drip out.

"Senior Brother is... quite straightforward."

Her words had just left her lips when Xu Yunfan stepped into the pool.

The hot spring instantly seemed to boil. In the rising mist, the bronze-colored skin on his body浮现出 the unique golden veins of the True Martial Subduer Demon True Energy, reflecting the pool water into the color of molten gold.

"Ah~"

Hua Ling let out a soft cry, suddenly realizing the reason for the silver bell's silence.

The threads of desire condensed by the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Law were being severed one by one by the true energy wandering along his spine.

The opponent's strength was far greater than she had imagined.

Hua Ling knew instantly that things were not good, and the alluring expression on her face vanished, replaced by a solemn look.

She tried to retreat quickly, her toes scraping fine lines on the bluestone at the bottom of the pool, but she bumped into Xu Yunfan's blocking arm.

"Junior Sister's 'Thousand Threads of Desire' is practiced quite well. You must have put in a lot of hard work. Senior Brother takes the liberty to ask for a lesson," Xu Yunfan said, his right palm pressing down on that seemingly slender waist.

"..."

In the faint dawn, Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged. Thirty-six acupoints along his spine glowed with a red light, like thirty-six miniature suns.

As the True Martial Subduer Demon Sutra circulated, dark golden patterns resembling turtle shells and snake scales appeared around his body.

The silver bell at her waist finally made a sound, but it was a faint, trembling hum, like the dying buzz of a bee.

The backlash of the Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Great Law was clearly visible. The Thousand Threads of Desire brand below her collarbone had turned charred black, and the true energy vortex in her dantian, once full, was now dry and empty.

Her almond eyes were wide open, staring at Xu Yunfan in utter disbelief.

Moreover, the essence energy in Xu Yunfan's body was like a solid block of iron. No matter how hard she tried to suck, he remained as stable as a mountain, impossible to shake.

Instead, the pure Yin energy she had refined for many years was sucked away by Xu Yunfan when he抓住了 her trembling.

This damn bastard!

He's like a pixiu! We could have had a win-win situation!

Hua Ling was furious. Ever since she started cultivating, she had used her looks to make many men with questionable preferences suffer, turning them into dried husks.

And she had a good eye for people. Every time she targeted someone, she would investigate their background. If they had no backing and were all alone, she wouldn't hold back.

Xu Yunfan was an excellent target, but he seemed to be a body cultivator, making it difficult for her to succeed.

Xu Yunfan exhaled a mouthful of turbid air. The True Martial Millstone formed by the acupoints in his spine turned, grinding the last trace of impure desires to dust.

With his Martial Dao Sky-Eye looking inward, he could see that the pure Yin energy he had absorbed during last night's dual cultivation had transformed into the purest essence energy to nourish his own body.

Even the proficiency of the True Martial Subduer Demon Sutra had increased by several points.

'True Martial Subduer Demon Sutra (Minor Success, 38/1000)'

It had increased by three points!

Xu Yunfan was exhilarated. He knew that Daoist cultivation manuals were extremely difficult to practice. Even though he had entered the Dao through martial arts and was practicing a continuation of the martial path, performing the work of the True Martial...
