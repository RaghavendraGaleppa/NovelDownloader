# Chapter 211: The Tide Approaches (8k)

The scene unfolded in the blink of an eye, leaving everyone stunned as they watched Elder Rongjin get struck by a purple tentacle and sent flying into the ruins.

"Cough, cough—"

Elder Rongjin clutched his chest, coughing up blood with difficulty. The attack had caught him completely off guard. He had been focused on defending against the four Golden Core cultivators from Wangyue City, never expecting the purple tentacle to retain such formidable combat power after enduring his divine abilities.

"Good, good, very good..."

Seeing Elder Rongjin laugh instead of rage, the four Golden Core cultivators in the sky and the spectators from the other three districts of Wangyue City all felt a chill. They could sense the volcanic fury brewing within him.

"A mere tentacled demon actually managed to make such a fool of me. Truly remarkable. You seem to possess some intelligence—your origins must be anything but simple."

"However, a demon is still a demon. If you think you can run amok in human territory, you're sorely mistaken!"

"I don't care where you came from. Today, you'll return the same way you arrived!"

"Clang! Clang!"

Two clear chimes rang out as a pair of golden hooks, one left and one right, gleamed brilliantly under the moonlight. They were likely a matched pair of magic treasures, refined by Elder Rongjin over many years. With a thought, they shot forth.

The purple tentacle flailed desperately, but severely wounded by the earlier divine abilities, it had no strength to resist. Struck repeatedly by the treasures, it let out agonized shrieks.

"Screech—"

Sections of the tentacle were severed, writhing on the ground like earthworms cut in half, their vitality flickering in and out. Pools of foul-smelling blood spread across the ground.

As its aura weakened further, the purple tentacle finally let out a mournful cry and retreated underground, vanishing without a trace.

Elder Rongjin retrieved his treasures, his face suddenly paling as a sickly green-black hue crept up his cheeks. He coughed up blood again—this time, it wasn't bright red but a dark crimson.

"Not good!"

Elder Rongjin realized he had been poisoned by the purple tentacle's sneak attack. If he didn't expel the toxin immediately, it could become a fatal threat.

Meanwhile, the four Golden Core cultivators from Wangyue City, seeing Elder Rongjin's weakened state, grew restless. This seemed like the perfect opportunity to reclaim their dignity.

Elder Rongjin was severely injured. With the four of them joining forces, they had nothing to fear.

But as they exchanged glances, Elder Rongjin merely sneered and sat cross-legged in plain view, closing his eyes to focus on expelling the poison, as if daring them to make a move.

This display intimidated the four Golden Core cultivators. Despite his injuries, Elder Rongjin was still a late-stage Golden Core expert. If they attacked, there was a real risk of one or two of them being dragged down with him. None wanted to gamble on being the unlucky ones.

The flaw of their loose alliance became apparent. They couldn't help but reminisce about the days when the Li Family's patriarch was alive. Back then, though the patriarch had lorded over them with his superior cultivation, he had also shouldered the brunt of external threats, leaving them to follow behind and lend support.

Without the Li Family's patriarch, Wangyue City's inner council was a disorganized mess.

As they hesitated, a mocking smile gradually curled Elder Rongjin's lips, as if taunting them for their cowardice.

Just then, a streak of rainbow light rose from the eastern part of Wangyue City, swiftly approaching with a long cry.

"Hahaha! Isn't this Elder Rongjin of the Dai Family? Why so disheveled?"

Tens of thousands of cultivators in the city turned to look. A short-haired elder in yellow robes flew toward them. Though he appeared aged, his eyes burned with vitality.

Many knowledgeable cultivators recognized him.

The Grand Elder of the Yang Family, a late-stage Golden Core cultivator.

The Yang Family of Luzhong Prefecture was another mining giant in the Lu Kingdom, rivaling the Dai Family. The two had competed fiercely for centuries, their conflicts both overt and covert.

The Yang Family's Grand Elder had hidden in the city during the earlier battle, only stepping forward now that the dust had settled. What puzzled everyone was why two late-stage Golden Core experts had appeared here today.

Elder Rongjin's expression darkened. Under normal circumstances, he wouldn't have feared the Yang Family's elder, but now, with the strange poison coursing through his veins, he couldn't afford to fight. He needed to focus on expelling the toxin.

"Old Ghost Yang, what brings you here?"

"Hahaha, Brother Dai, if you can come, why can't I? This concerns that person's disciple—how could I let you hog all the benefits?"

The Yang Family's Grand Elder smiled slyly, his pupils glowing yellow as he openly used a pupil technique to scrutinize Elder Rongjin's injuries. His blatant malice was unmistakable.

Elder Rongjin inwardly cursed. The Yang Family must have also learned about Xiongshan Shangren, the disciple of the Pure Lotus Hermit, and rushed here to compete for him. But why had they waited until now? Had others arrived earlier and been restraining each other?

"Hahaha, Elder Dai's earlier display of might was truly awe-inspiring!"

"That tentacled demon's origins must be extraordinary to contend with a late-stage Golden Core cultivator!"

"Alas, though the demon was strong, righteousness prevailed. Elder Rongjin subdued it in the end."

"Tsk, tsk. Elder Dai, how are your injuries? Do you need assistance?"

...

Four more Golden Core cultivators emerged from the city, each with ill intentions.

Elder Rongjin's face finally paled. He recognized them all.

The sect master of Lingyun Sect, the leader of Immortal Crane Gate, the fortress lord of Zhaoshen Fort, and the head of Liuyang Sect.

All were Golden Core cultivators involved in the mining industry, though none were major players. They had long been suppressed by the Dai Family, silently seething with resentment. Now, seeing Elder Rongjin injured, they eagerly stepped forward.

Of course, more Golden Core cultivators lurked in Wangyue City, but only those with grudges against the Dai Family had revealed themselves. The rest remained hidden, observing.

After all, over a dozen nearby factions had learned of Xiongshan Shangren's whereabouts, with more on the way. Wangyue City's high-end trade fair was also renowned in western Lu Kingdom, attracting many Golden Core cultivators who hadn't yet shown themselves.

Elder Rongjin had originally planned to quietly retrieve Xiongshan Shangren, but fate had other plans. The strange tentacle hidden within Xiongshan Shangren had forced him into the open.

Now, not only was he severely injured and poisoned, but his condition was dire.

The four local Golden Core cultivators of Wangyue City's inner council saw an opportunity and aligned themselves with the newly arrived five, their combined auras radiating power.

The tens of thousands of cultivators in the city shuddered. Was another battle about to erupt?

Among the nine, the Yang Family's Grand Elder, being the strongest, naturally took the lead.

"Elder Dai, the poison has reached your heart and organs. Do you need my help to suppress it?"

The Yang Family's Grand Elder stepped forward, his pupil technique fading as if he had already discerned Elder Rongjin's condition.

Elder Rongjin's heart skipped a beat, but he feigned calm. "No need, Brother Yang. Though the poison is troublesome, I can expel it in time. There's no need to trouble others."

The sect master of Lingyun Sect also stepped forward, his gaze shifting. "Elder Rongjin, we've always supported each other. How can we stand by when you're in distress?"

Elder Rongjin waved him off with a smile. "You're too kind. Such a small matter isn't worth owing you a favor. That's a poor trade."

The leader of Immortal Crane Gate stepped forward, his concern exaggerated. "Elder Dai, why suffer alone? My sect has a poison called Crane's Crown Red. Perhaps using poison to counter poison could help!"

Elder Rongjin's heart trembled. "Thank you, but I'll pass on that method."

The fortress lord of Zhaoshen Fort stepped forward, his third eye glowing. "My Zhaoshen technique can stabilize the poison, preventing its spread. Please don't doubt my sincerity."

Elder Rongjin forced a smile. "Your technique would cost you years of accumulated power. I couldn't possibly accept."

The head of Liuyang Sect stepped forward, feigning compassion. "Our pure yang techniques specialize in countering evil. I'd gladly help you expel the poison free of charge."

Elder Rongjin appeared moved to tears. "Your generosity is admirable, but such a minor poison isn't worth your effort."

The four local Golden Core cultivators, emboldened, stepped forward in unison. "As hosts, we must thank Elder Dai for protecting the city. His sacrifice for tens of thousands of lives moves us deeply. Please let us repay you!"

Elder Rongjin wept openly. "No need! I was raised with Confucian virtues—benevolence, righteousness, loyalty, and courage. Helping others is my duty. Don't demean yourselves!"

...

The Golden Core cultivators' "sincere" offers to help were all politely declined.

The crowd below watched in confusion, unsure whether a fight would break out or if they should flee.

The Yang Family's Grand Elder finally changed his tone. "Since Elder Dai refuses our goodwill, we'll stand aside!"

The others were stunned. Weren't the Yang and Dai Families rivals? Why let him off so easily?

In truth, the Yang Family's Grand Elder had a more sinister plan.

A heavy pressure suddenly weighed down on Elder Rongjin.

"You—?!"

Elder Rongjin's face flushed as he nearly spat blood. His energy circulation faltered, and his efforts to expel the poison were disrupted.

The other eight Golden Core cultivators brightened, understanding the Yang Family's Grand Elder's ploy.

In the Golden Core stage, cultivators could manipulate their aura to exert pressure. Locking onto an opponent forced them to respond in kind, lest they feel like a blade was at their throat.

This was an overt scheme!

The other eight joined in, their auras converging on Elder Rongjin.

Under the pressure of nine peers, Elder Rongjin hunched slightly, sweat beading on his forehead. He had no choice but to abandon expelling the poison and focus entirely on resisting their auras.

He had three options: endure, fight, or flee.

But in reality, only the first was viable.

Fighting would mean certain death against nine opponents in his weakened state. Fleeing would trigger a backlash, likely causing a qi deviation and leaving him helpless.

He could only hold on.

The nine Golden Core cultivators maintained their pressure, intent on letting the poison consume him.

As time passed, Elder Rongjin's limbs stiffened, his face turning from red to black as the poison spread unchecked.

The spectators watched in awe as the once-venerable elder transformed into a ghastly figure.

Dai Budong and his followers were frantic but powerless to intervene.

After a quarter-hour, a hoarse voice spoke.

Elder Rongjin, now pitch-black and swaying, was beyond saving. The poison had taken its toll.

"Enough, enough..."

"After a lifetime of striving, I'll never see the Dai Family rise to dominance."

"Centuries of planning, wasted. Man proposes, heaven disposes."

"Autumn winds rise as dusk clouds drift; grass withers as geese fly south."

"Youth fades too soon; joy peaks, then sorrow follows..."

...

The crowd trembled, moved by his lament. A gust of wind swept through, carrying fallen leaves as the elder's figure dissipated into the autumn night.

Elder Rongjin of the Dai Family had fallen.

The nine Golden Core cultivators stood coldly in the sky, their robes fluttering.

Dai Budong below was furious, wishing he could tear them apart. Elder Rongjin had been the Dai Family's pillar, their foundation in the cultivation world.

His death would send ripples through the Lu Kingdom's cultivation circles.

With two Golden Core cultivators lost—including their late-stage pillar—the Dai Family's position as a mining giant was in jeopardy. A scramble for their resources was inevitable.

Lin Shan, watching from the Lin Clan Trading House in the western district, was struck by the ruthlessness of the cultivation world. Even a powerhouse like Elder Rongjin could fall in an instant.

The Yang Family's Grand Elder suddenly wailed.

"Alas! Woe is me!"

"Brother Dai, so full of vigor, on the cusp of Nascent Soul, felled by a demon's poison! What tragedy!"

"We once stood by the Wei River, gazing at the clouds, dreaming of the future. Two centuries later, only we remained to uphold our families' legacies!"

"Now you're gone, leaving me alone in this wretched world! How cruel!"

...

His performance moved many ignorant low-level cultivators, who believed Elder Rongjin had truly been killed by the demon.

The other eight Golden Core cultivators cursed inwardly but played along.

"Brother Yang, don't grieve too deeply. We did what we could."

"Indeed, Elder Dai refused our help. There was nothing more to do."

"Alas, a hero fallen to a demon's hand—what a pity!"

"Elder Dai dreamed of elevating the Dai Family, only to perish mid-journey."

"Truly, 'the bowmen of Shu lament their fallen leader'..."

...

Their acting was so convincing even Lin Shan was impressed.

The Yang Family's Grand Elder then retrieved Elder Rongjin's storage ring and declared solemnly, "I dare not keep Brother Dai's belongings. I shall personally return them to the Dai Family and pay my respects. Would any of you join me?"

Silence fell.

Everyone knew the Yang Family's true intentions. Bringing the entire Yang clan to "pay respects" was clearly a pretext for invasion.

The other Golden Core cultivators hesitated. They had only planned to skim some benefits, not launch a full assault.

The Yang Family's Grand Elder pressed on. "Remember, we all 'helped' Elder Dai earlier. If the Dai Family wishes to thank us, my Yang Family can handle it. Can you?"

The implication was clear: he would expose their roles in Elder Rongjin's death if they didn't join him. The Dai Family might not dare retaliate against the Yangs, but they could crush the smaller factions.

Faced with this ultimatum, the Golden Core cultivators reluctantly agreed.

One by one, they pledged to join the "memorial."

The Yang Family's Grand Elder laughed heartily. With eight Golden Core cultivators and his family's five, they outnumbered the Dai Family's remaining three.

He then called for others to join, sparking a frenzy.

"Our Wang Family will join!"

"Our Canghai Trading House demands compensation for destroyed workshops!"

"Our Hongdu Smithy lost dozens of artisans—the Dai Family must answer!"

"Our Thousand Thread Puppet House lost thousands of puppets!"

...

Amid the clamor, Blackbone Demon poked Lin Shan.

"What?"

"Shout with them!"

Lin Shan frowned. "Why? Only Golden Core cultivators will get anything. Without that power, we'd just be cannon fodder."

Blackbone Demon retorted, "Don't you want the treasures to break through to Golden Core? This is your only chance!"

"Have you ever seen such treasures in high-end auctions? They're monopolized by major powers. The Dai Family must have some in reserve. Are you really going to pass this up?"

Lin Shan's heart raced, but he hesitated. "With so many Golden Core cultivators, how could we compete?"

Blackbone Demon chuckled darkly. "Who says we don't have a Golden Core cultivator? With the Magic Taro Fruit and the Golden Core corpse, I'll recover my strength in no time."

Lin Shan eyed him skeptically. "They're gathering in three months. Can you make it?"

Blackbone Demon's soul flame flickered resolutely. "Three months is enough."

Lin Shan's mind whirred. If Blackbone Demon regained Golden Core strength, with his combat experience, mastery of formations and artifacts, and their two magic treasures, they could indeed claim a share.

"Fine!"

Lin Shan turned to Lü Xiuming, who immediately pulled out a loudspeaker artifact and climbed onto the roof.

"Our Lin Clan Trading House demands compensation for the destruction of our aquaculture estate and the abduction of our manager!"

Lin Shan and Blackbone Demon nodded approvingly. Might as well stake their claim.

Across the city, voices rose in a chorus of demands—some genuine, some opportunistic.

Unnoticed in the chaos, Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou slipped away into the night.
