# Chapter 39: Purchases

Li Shiming had approximately one hundred and ninety-two spirit stones available for use, but he needed to set aside some for his cultivation next month.  

He approached a book stall marked with the character "Zhang."  

"Here, you can only flip one page of any book. If you flip more, you must purchase it at the listed price!" The stall owner, Zhang, had noticed Li Shiming's earlier transaction with Old Liu and recognized him as a potential customer. He spoke up immediately when Li Shiming stopped at his stall.  

Li Shiming picked up a book titled *Light Body Technique*. The first page contained only an introduction to the technique, with no substantial content.  

The *Light Body Technique* was described as a "universal spell" in the introduction. Though Li Shiming wasn't entirely sure what that meant, he assumed it was a spell that all cultivators could learn.  

He set the *Light Body Technique* aside and examined the other books: *Fireball Technique*, *Object Control Technique*, *Sound Transmission Technique*, and *Freezing Technique*.  

"Fellow Daoist Zhang, how much for the *Light Body Technique*?" Li Shiming pointed to the book he had set aside.  

"All secret manuals here are ten spirit stones each," Zhang replied firmly.  

Li Shiming quickly calculated. None of these were cultivation techniques—only spellbooks. Given that they were openly displayed for sale, they likely weren't particularly powerful spells.  

Ten spirit stones per book—equivalent to ten pounds of spirit rice—wasn't expensive for him. But he knew better than to appear too generous. This wasn't the mortal world; it was the cultivation realm.  

Both Fan Yiyang and Gu Jiayu had warned him about the dangers of the cultivation world. He had no intention of drawing unnecessary attention that might lead to fatal consequences.  

"Five spirit stones each. I'll take three," Li Shiming countered.  

"Fellow Daoist, that's not how bargaining works. Twenty spirit stones for three books. If I hadn't made any sales today, I wouldn't be offering such a low price," Zhang said, feigning reluctance.  

Li Shiming didn't press further. He placed twenty spirit stones on the table, took three books, and left the stall.  

Zhang's face immediately brightened as he pocketed the spirit stones and replaced the sold books with three new ones.  

Li Shiming had actually wanted to buy all five books but restrained himself to avoid appearing too wealthy. For a novice like him, all five spells would have been useful.  

Next, he wandered to the temporary stalls, which offered a bizarre assortment of items. There were books here too, but he didn't bother looking.  

His earlier experience had taught him that sellers wouldn't allow him to browse freely, making it impossible to verify the authenticity of the manuals.  

He trusted the fixed stalls far more than these temporary setups. Among the temporary stalls, he even saw people trying to trade mortal-world paintings and treasures for spirit stones. He couldn't imagine which cultivator would make such an exchange.  

"Hmm?" As he passed one temporary stall, something caught his eye, slowing his steps.  

It was a plant's root and two broken branches lying beside it. What drew his attention was the faint spiritual energy emanating from them. Of course, most items in the market carried spiritual energy, but spiritual plants were rare.  

The root and branches had scorch marks at the breaks, and their condition appeared poor, either from prolonged exposure or some other reason.  

"Fellow Daoist, how much for this?" Li Shiming crouched and pointed at the root and branches.  

"I found it. Five spirit stones, and it's yours," the stall owner replied in a muffled voice, his face covered with cloth.  

Five spirit stones wasn't expensive. If the plant had been intact, the price would have been many times higher.  

Li Shiming wasn't sure if he could revive it, but five spirit stones seemed worth the gamble. The seller had likely thought the same, pricing it at just the right amount.  

He handed over five spirit stones and collected the root and branches.  

Having reached the end of the market, he turned back and quickened his pace, heading straight for the first stall at the entrance.  

"Fellow Daoist Hao, how much for the talisman paper?" Li Shiming asked.  

"Ten spirit stones per stack," replied Hao, his aged voice carrying a hint of alertness.  

"Two stacks, please. And how much for this talisman brush?" Li Shiming didn't haggle. He had observed that transactions at this stall were quick, indicating fixed prices.  

"Rabbit-tail brush, made from the fur of a Crimson Hare. Thirty spirit stones."  

"And these talisman ink materials—how much?"  

"Ten spirit stones."  

Li Shiming handed over the spirit stones, and Hao pushed the items toward him. The deal was done.  

Without delay, Li Shiming left the market. As soon as he stepped outside, he activated a *Primary Light Body Talisman*, channeling energy into his legs to sprint away.  

Instead of heading straight back to Zhongdu, he took a longer, circuitous route.  

He heightened all five senses, engaging all 190 CPUs of his IBM z15 mainframe to analyze every piece of sensory input.  

Suddenly, he changed direction mid-stride.  

His system had detected an anomaly—a bird taking flight from the forest ahead. The way it flapped its wings suggested it had been startled rather than taking off naturally.  

According to his database, there was an 80% chance someone was hiding in those woods.  

This wasn't a normal path. Without the aid of a *Primary Light Body Talisman*, traversing such steep and uneven terrain would be difficult.  

Two figures in the woods watched Li Shiming change course but made no move to follow.  

To them, Li Shiming was clearly a novice. Despite his attempts to appear experienced in the market, he had given himself away with numerous tells.  

His caution had only made him more conspicuous.  

First, he had a storage pouch—a luxury that immediately drew attention. He had assumed every cultivator owned one, unaware of the struggles of rogue cultivators.  

Second, his indifferent reaction to the weapons on display at the stalls betrayed his possession of superior equipment.  

Lastly, though his total spending amounted to only about a hundred spirit stones, his novice behavior had already made him a target for opportunistic cultivators.  

Mentally reviewing the map, Li Shiming knew there were limited paths down the mountain. He needed to descend quickly—once he left the area, he could move freely.
