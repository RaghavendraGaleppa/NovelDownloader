# Chapter 258: Guest Elder

Li Shiming had just returned and hadn't had time to carefully examine the changes in the Sword Holding Peak's spiritual vein when he received a message from outside the peak's defensive formation.

Stepping out of his cave dwelling, he opened the formation. Manager Lai, a middle-aged Golden Core cultivator with a refined appearance and profound yet restrained aura, entered. The moment he set foot on Sword Holding Peak, he was slightly taken aback—his sensitivity to spiritual energy far surpassed Li Shiming's.

He could confirm that this seemingly ordinary spiritual mountain now possessed a Golden Core-level spiritual vein. With his extensive experience, Manager Lai was well aware of how spiritual energy distribution worked in major sects like the Shu Mountain Sect. 

Sword Holding Peak should have been a branch of Tianmu Peak, theoretically incapable of having a Golden Core-level spiritual vein. To achieve this would require a Nascent Soul cultivator to reconstruct the spiritual vein and redirect a new branch from the main vein. Any task requiring a Nascent Soul cultivator's involvement was exceedingly rare in major sects.

Normally, to upgrade a spiritual vein, one would simply be reassigned to a mountain with an existing Golden Core-level vein. The fact that Li Shiming—still a Foundation Building cultivator needing to study under Elder Su—received such special treatment spoke volumes about his changing status within the Shu Mountain Sect.

"Fellow Daoist Li, I've come on behalf of Northern Shu Trading Company to pay you a visit!" Manager Lai said with genuine warmth, clasping his hands in greeting. He had initially considered addressing Li Shiming more casually, but sensing the peak's spiritual vein, he immediately adjusted his manner to treat him as an equal.

"Manager Lai, please come in!" Li Shiming, aware that the other was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, returned the courtesy and invited him in.

This time, Li Shiming led Manager Lai to the main hall of his cave dwelling—a rare gesture reserved for esteemed guests. As Manager Lai entered, his eyes swept over the furnishings, pausing at the second-grade Golden Lotus growing in the pond. His admiration was sincere.

Second-grade Golden Lotuses were treasures rarely seen even in Golden Core cultivators' abodes. "Fellow Daoist Li, I had prepared a gift, but seeing this Golden Lotus, I believe I have something more suitable," Manager Lai said with a smile, producing a jade vial.

Li Shiming accepted it and opened the vial, his spiritual sense detecting an extraordinarily vibrant life force. "Third-grade Spiritual Nectar?" he exclaimed in surprise, unable to identify the exact substance but clearly sensing its grade.

"This is third-grade Wood Spirit Treasure Milk, obtained by chance. While rare, it's not excessively valuable—its only function is to elevate a spiritual plant from second to third grade, which is rather limited in use, so I've kept it stored," Manager Lai explained frankly.

His assessment wasn't wrong. For a spiritual plant to advance to third grade required inherent potential—the Treasure Milk merely accelerated the process. Using such a precious item merely to hasten growth that would occur naturally over time was indeed inefficient. 

However, applying it to the Golden Lotus was an exception. Golden Lotuses were among the most precious spiritual plants, with extremely slow growth cycles. Given Li Shiming's rapid cultivation progress, the second-grade lotus might soon become inadequate. 

"You're too generous, Manager Lai. I'll accept with gratitude," Li Shiming said, not overly concerned about the gift's value—while third-grade, it was among the lowest-value consumables in that tier.

Without delay, he poured the Treasure Milk onto the Golden Lotus. As the liquid touched the plant, it was rapidly absorbed. The golden specks along the lotus's edges expanded visibly, its grade rising perceptibly as it swayed gently in the spiritual spring water.

When Li Shiming first obtained the second-grade Golden Lotus, he hadn't understood its value until a fellow disciple enlightened him. Its effects had been subtle then, but now, elevated to third grade, its purified spiritual energy output multiplied exponentially. Standing near it, one could feel the refined energy—easier to absorb and calming to the mind, indirectly accelerating cultivation. No wonder Golden Lotuses were among the most coveted spiritual plants.

Both men stood mesmerized before the transformed lotus. To cultivators, such purified energy was more intoxicating than fine wine. "Congratulations, Fellow Daoist Li, on obtaining a third-grade Golden Lotus. Your cultivation path will surely be smoother hereafter," Manager Lai said warmly.

"Thanks to your Wood Spirit Treasure Milk. Please, let's sit—I've been remiss as a host," Li Shiming replied, their shared experience fostering camaraderie.

He served self-roasted second-grade spiritual tea—not out of stinginess, but because serving third-grade might seem ostentatious. Manager Lai praised the tea sincerely; like Li Shiming's alchemical products, anything processed in his machine room space reached peak quality.

"Fellow Daoist Li, I presume you've settled matters with the Thousand Leaves Temple. I've been sent to persuade you to accept alchemy commissions regardless of origin," Manager Lai said after savoring the tea, addressing his primary mission.

"Manager Lai, I didn't expect my impulsive decision would trouble you to make this trip. Indeed, I've reconciled with the Thousand Leaves Temple," Li Shiming confirmed.

Though Manager Lai had received preliminary reports, hearing it directly from Li Shiming—given the young man's reputation for strong principles—was a relief. His smile grew more genuine. 

"Fellow Daoist Li, I heard you possess 'Everlasting Beauty Pills'?" Manager Lai shifted topics casually, though Li Shiming noticed the subtle gleam in his eyes—likely the true purpose of this visit.

That the Northern Shu Trading Company learned about the pills so soon after the Thousand Illusions Sect transaction demonstrated their extensive intelligence network. Having revealed the pills there, Li Shiming had anticipated this development.

"I do have two remaining 'Everlasting Beauty Pills.' I'm surprised such trivial news reached you," Li Shiming replied mildly.

"Would you consider consigning them to our auction house? We'd waive all fees to secure you the best possible price," Manager Lai proposed eagerly, though he suspected Li Shiming had more than two pills. Still, getting any commitment pleased him greatly.

Li Shiming wasn't commercially naive—his past life's information-saturated environment had imparted basic business acumen.
