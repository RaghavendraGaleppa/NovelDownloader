## Chapter 212: Road Collapse Incident

Under the dark night sky, fiery springs rippled, enveloping Kunling City like a crimson veil.

"Senior Cao stands above the clouds, overlooking the entire world shrouded in night mist. After forging his own invincible renown, even the disciples he takes in astound the Eight Desolations."

"The road ahead is long; I hope Junior Brother Li can go far enough."

Pu Heng and his friend smiled as they spoke of their junior brother in the tearoom, for they had just received word that Li Qingxu had "set forth." An Immortal Seed represents the future foundation of the sect. Their lineage needed such an accumulation to continue the glory established by Cao Qianqiu.

***

In the Secret Realm, two divine rainbows streaked across the sky, drawing attention from all directions. These were the Demonic Seed and the Immortal Seed colliding. No one had expected them to battle in such a manner, fighting into the heavens, creating a breathtaking spectacle. Some felt quite nervous, while others were expectant, all looking up and watching, quietly awaiting a "major incident" to occur. This was because some predicted that a "Road Collapse" event might happen today.

"Bullish! Our demon race actually has such a fierce individual! This truly boosts our morale, enhances our reputation, and grants us boundless confidence!" Some demons trembled with excitement, shouting loudly. They anticipated the Demonic Seed striking down the Immortal Seed. Though they couldn't participate themselves, they were already enthralled and their blood boiled with excitement.

In the sky, the two "Seeds" clashed upon their respective roads, a stunning sight, as large swathes of flowing light scattered downwards. The edge of one road was severely damaged, teetering precariously, very likely to break.

"The Immortal Road... it's unstable!" The pupils of some disciples close to Li Qingxu contracted, sensing that the worst was about to happen.

The crimson road, surging with demonic energy and wreathed in purple mist, resonated with dragon roars, growing increasingly dominant, as if it would sweep across the entire Secret Realm. The other road collapsed from its edge, its scattered flowing light surging towards the opposing demonic road – a true ebb and flow. After several collisions, the light of the Immortal Road severely diminished. It grew increasingly dim, and the sound of its collapse could be clearly heard. Many parts shattered, and the road narrowed. Those shattered fragments all flew towards the opposing side, paving the demonic road, causing it to expand, widen, and become even more solid.

"Is this the so-called 'Road Struggle'? It's fully materialized!" someone sighed. The two roads spanned the sky. In their final head-on clash, large sections of the Immortal Road shattered, its surface narrowing to less than half its original width. One more strike would completely sever it.

Moreover, at this moment, people saw Li Qingxu's figure. His hair disheveled, his body plummeted downwards.

"The Road Collapse event has occurred!" someone cried out.

However, at the last moment, Li Qingxu's hand clutched the edge of the remnant road, and he pulled himself back up. His chest heaved, his emotions fluctuating wildly! He was utterly unwilling to accept this. In this most crucial Road Struggle, under the watchful eyes of all, he had practically fallen from his road, defeated by a demon from the plateau. He was Cao Qianqiu's disciple; how could he be defeated?!

A cold voice reminded him: "Cherish the road ahead as you walk it. As the loser, you still have one more chance to challenge your opponent. You must seize it." Upon hearing the words "cherish the road ahead as you walk it," Li Qingxu felt an intense sense of humiliation, wanting to smash the road to pieces with a single strike.

At that moment, he was forced to leave the golden-bricked, jade-tiled structure, and watched helplessly as the incense stick that aided his enlightenment, and the meditation mat, flew away. Afterward, his teeth nearly ground to powder, his face ashen, for those divine objects had all flown towards the demonic road, aiding his enemy right before his eyes. He had failed in the Road Struggle, and the "gifts" he had been enjoying all became the demonic cultivator's spoils of war. This situation infuriated him, his chest tight with suppressed rage.

"Li Qingxu lost! He just fell, and his road is about to break!"

"The Immortal Seed of our Outer Pure Land actually couldn't contend with the Demonic Seed from the plateau. Senior Cao's face will surely lose its luster!"

The Secret Realm was filled with clamor; many discussed the battle, which had stirred up a huge commotion.

"Heh heh, our demon race truly lives up to being the heavens' most favored race! Heroes capable of shaking heaven and earth appear in every era. Another great deity is about to rise!"

"Quickly send unusual birds to the depths of the plateau to inform our elder demon seniors to come to the Secret Realm to provide assistance and protect the Demonic Seed. Don't let the old monsters of the Immortal Road harm him!"

Amidst this fervent discussion, different groups held entirely different attitudes. But one thing was common: the psychology of admiring the strong. Winners garnered much glory, while losers often faced dejection and slander. Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, Liu Hanhya, and others were somewhat lost in thought. They knew very well who that was, but couldn't comment too much here. They felt deeply shaken. That accompanying youth had first slain a Demonic Seed, then defeated an Immortal Seed, truly accomplishing one extraordinary feat after another!

***

Li Qingxu's qi and blood churned. Although it was merely a clash of roads without actual physical contact, the shattered Immortal Road beneath his feet vividly reflected the outcome of this battle. Soon after, he calmed his mind and muttered, "Among the unorthodox cultivators from the plateau, such a Demonic Seed actually appeared? Why have I never heard of him before?"

"If this were a real battle, would I be completely crushed by him?" He found this reality hard to accept.

"Not necessarily." The mechanical voice resounded again.

Li Qingxu abruptly looked up and asked, "What do you mean?"

"This is the result of the materialized 'achievements' on your respective roads colliding. It's related to the various evaluations you gained on your paths, and actual combat is just one factor among them."

Upon hearing this, Li Qingxu's eyes immediately brightened. The previous collisions weren't many, and he had quickly tasted defeat, which had made him doubt himself. He asked, "Could you elaborate on what factors those evaluations include?"

"Actual combat, comprehension, physical foundation, the road-opener's vision, unspeakable insightful flashes of thought..."

The more Li Qingxu listened, the darker his face became. It would have been better not to ask; he felt even more displeased. Apart from actual combat, which of these factors wasn't related to the future? Were all those simply bonus points for his opponent? Li Qingxu looked at the ruined road beneath his feet, his expression as dark as water, and declared, "I want to have a real combat with him!" He knew clearly that fighting on the roads was no longer an option. One more clash, and his road would surely break. He had no choice but to engage in a real blood battle!

"Yes, he will soon enter the second node. There is a combat arena there, but for the protection of later cultivators with exceptional talent and aspirations to open roads, the combat must occur within the same domain."

Li Qingxu nodded, "No problem!"

***

Qin Ming reflected, thinking he had been reckless this time. He originally didn't wish to stir up trouble, but he was unfamiliar with the rules of this place. Because he found Li Qingxu unpleasant, he shattered his statue, which unexpectedly led to such a confrontation.

"Hmm?" He was surprised, noticing an incense burner and a meditation mat flying from afar. Soon, he learned their purpose from the cold voice. They might be comparable to the tea that aided enlightenment he had drunk earlier! The incense stick had temporarily extinguished, but it could be relit at any time.

"What kind of existence are you?" Qin Ming asked.

The mechanical voice informed him that it was the Heavenly Demonic Mirror here, the Immortal Mirror on the Immortal Road, and the Divine Mirror on the Divine Road. It was a damaged exotic treasure. Qin Ming's heart trembled. Even a damaged treasure was this remarkable.

The Heavenly Demonic Mirror said, "Successor who aspires to open roads, if you show exceptional performance again, you may have the opportunity to fully restore the fractured Demonic Seeds." It actually offered such a grand prospect.

Qin Ming was stunned. He had refined two fragmented Demonic Seeds and cultivated the Dragon-Serpent Scripture to step onto the Demonic Road. He still had three untouched ones on him. Could they actually be fully restored? If so, his still-unfinished ninth rebirth, as well as cultivating the Golden Cicada Scripture and the Undying Butterfly Scripture, seemed to have a path forward. This was truly an unexpected delight!

"What constitutes exceptional performance?" he asked.

"Sever a road." The Heavenly Demonic Mirror replied.

Qin Ming felt great regret. The recent confrontation had been stopped by the mirror; otherwise, one more clash, and Li Qingxu's road would have broken! He seriously assessed the situation, believing Li Qingxu was indeed very strong. However, as long as he stepped into the Outer Saint realm, he wouldn't need to avoid this person if they met in reality.

Soon after, Qin Ming entered the Rebirth Road. He already knew about the plaza node issue, so he changed his appearance before stepping in. Thus, he "hopped" between the two roads, advancing rapidly in a strange manner.

***

Li Qingxu decided to retaliate. Not long ago, he had been in a deep state of enlightenment, comprehending a sect-guarding ultimate art, only to be interrupted by that demonic cultivator, and his road nearly severed. Now, he arrived at a plaza node further along the road, preparing to strike the demonic cultivator's materialized statue there, making the demon taste the sensation of being "interrupted" as well. He guessed that after the opponent obtained the incense stick and meditation mat, he would surely fall into a state of enlightenment. It was his turn to act!

After Li Qingxu arrived at this plaza, his first glance fell upon the demon, lifelike and full of wildness. He strode forward, his expression cold. Without a word, he swung the purplish-glowing bamboo staff in his hand directly towards the demon's head. With a thud, the entire plaza trembled slightly.

"What's going on?" He found that the statue hadn't suffered even a scratch, let alone had its head exploded. Li Qingxu refused to believe it. This time, his entire body glowed, and he raised the bamboo staff high before smashing it down fiercely.

Boom! Where the bamboo staff passed, lightning flashed and thunder roared, runes swirling around it. Yet, after enduring this strike, the statue remained completely undamaged. The demon's eyes and brows clearly showed arrogance, and its face held a cold smile, as if mocking him. Li Qingxu continuously swung his bamboo staff, but the result was always the inability to shatter the statue.

"Why is this happening?!" His face was covered in frost.

The Immortal Mirror informed him: "This is materialized based on physical foundation, comprehension, road-opening vision..."

"Stop talking! Arrange a real combat for me!" Li Qingxu slammed his staff onto the ground.

***

On the plateau, an elder demon received a report from an unusual bird, learning that an extraordinary Demonic Seed had appeared in the Secret Realm, powerfully suppressing an Immortal Seed, and might soon sever an Immortal Road.

"They need our protection? Hmm, no one can interfere with those roads. Alright, we can send people to guard outside the Secret Realm to provide assistance."

"They want to attack this plateau, huh? A good thought, but unfortunately, they don't know how deep the waters are here. In the end, it's still unknown who will be the prey!"

***

In Kunling City, Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple, Pu Heng, was drinking tea with a friend when he was informed that the latest news regarding his junior brother, Li Qingxu, had arrived. He remained composed. After taking a shallow sip of tea, he calmly smiled as he took the letter returned by the unusual bird and slowly unfolded it.
