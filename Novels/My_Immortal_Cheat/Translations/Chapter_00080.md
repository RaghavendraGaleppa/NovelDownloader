# Chapter 80: Dao Master!

The holy sword cleaved through the blood wolf, its momentum unchecked as it surged towards the figure enveloped in blood qi, white flames burning a zhang high.

*Clang!*

The figure shrouded in blood qi drew a blood-red saber, blocking the holy sword. The two clashed, a collision of creation and destruction. Though the holy sword was incomparably sacred, its destructive power was in no way inferior.

“Today, all of you shall perish here!” the winged creature declared coldly, pulling back its sword.

“How laughable. Not even the God-Kings of your lineage dared to be so arrogant!” another figure emerged from the void. He had a face like polished jade, dressed in a Daoist robe, with a purple mist canopy above his head, swirling like a vast ocean.

The six wings on the winged creature’s back flapped incessantly, its aura surging as if a raw nerve had been touched. It roared, “How dare you profane the Father God!”

“Gabriel, calm down.”

Turbid river water flowed past, and endless wailing souls shrieked. A dilapidated wooden boat slowly approached, its bottom planks loose and scattered. A black-robed figure stood upon it, slowly paddling with an oar.

“A Ferryman of the Underworld River? How peculiar. Two figures from opposing divine factions have actually joined forces. How heartbroken your followers would be to see this, haha…” The purple-robed figure clapped his hands and laughed heartily, the purple mist above his head expanding and contracting as if laughing along.

“Hehehe, if everyone on these eight warships were to die here, how heartbroken would you be then?” the black-robed figure on the wooden boat let out a strange cackle.

“Heartbroken wouldn’t quite describe it; there would indeed be a period of difficulty. However, the furious powerhouses behind us would undoubtedly uproot you at all costs,” the purple-robed Daoist said seriously, as if he had genuinely considered such a possibility.

“Who *are* these people?” Zhou Tian muttered in the cabin, speechless. They could hear the conversation of these figures clearly.

The main hall of the cabin was packed with people today. Faced with this sudden turn of events, many looked terrified, unsure what was happening. Of course, there were also composed individuals, like the Banished Immortal and Nan Qing. Those with keen minds could more or less guess seven or eight parts of what was going on by now—they were likely being used as bait to lure out a bigger fish.

And then there was a certain laughing idiot.

“I told you something was bound to happen, but you didn’t believe me. See? I was right,” Zhang Yi laughed like an imbecile, smug and utterly unbothered by the current situation.

“If I’m destined to die here today, resisting is useless. If I’m not destined to die here, I won’t die even if I lie still,” these were his exact, truly terrifying words.

In the void, the Ferryman of the Underworld River choked, unable to speak further. Beside him, Gabriel stated indifferently, “To uproot us? Not even the combined forces of the Eight Ancient Realms would dare to be so arrogant!”

*Rumble!*

Thunder suddenly boomed from the sky. Streaks of lightning descended, as if a lightning prison had arrived. From within the lightning domain stepped a figure wreathed in electricity, slender with long hair flowing behind him. He wore bright silver armor and held a silver short-handled hammer engraved with complex symbols in his right hand. Arcs of lightning sparked, and his eyes, filled with surging lightning, glowed blue. His voice resonated like a peal of thunder.

“No more words needed. Slay them!”

“Thor, the Thunder God? The major divine factions of the Ancient God Realm are nearly all here. This truly is a big catch!” A blue spatial vortex opened, and a figure in black-gold mecha armor stepped out, his voice processed to sound robotic.

*Clang!*

A golden light erupted from Gabriel’s abdomen, and space shattered. A black shadow appeared, strangely shaped, with a cape longer than its legs. It held a black short dagger and chuckled eerily, “Playing at assassination? Did you ask me first?”

Beside the purple-robed Daoist, a white-robed figure appeared, their head shrouded in a white hood. A short sword concealed in their sleeve, a deep voice echoed, “Sadoc, God Lord of Shadows? Interesting.”

Before they could say more, a miserable shriek resounded.

“Quick, contact Heaven’s Gate!”

A golden figure tumbled out of the void. Upon closer inspection, it was the body of a Buddha, but only half of it remained, mangled and bloody. Golden blood dripped down, and energy continued to corrode his body at the wound. In a short time, his divine soul extinguished, and he lost all vitality.

Everyone’s expressions changed. They recognized this person; he was a Buddha from Luotian Temple, and one of the powerful experts who had come with them. They were dispersed in different directions across the eight warships. How could this have happened?

Before they could investigate, *rumble!*

An ancient war chariot burst forth from the void, magnificent and radiating brilliant light that suppressed this entire domain, halting the spatial storms within a thousand miles.

The war chariot rumbled, pulled by nine ancient beasts that galloped at extreme speed.

The nine ancient beasts exuded boundless pressure. Each had ferocious horns and sharp, menacing scales. They resembled true dragons yet were not, belonging to races never before seen in the Nine Provinces.

The nine ancient beasts stepped through space, carrying the nine-colored immortal gold war chariot as they charged.

Upon the war chariot, a Daoist might erupted, followed by a sacred rain of light. A powerful figure stood up, looking down in this direction.

“You have some skill, to have slipped away when I wasn’t paying attention.” He stood on the war chariot, holding a long spear whose tip dripped with blood—the blood of a Buddha.

“Dao Master!?” The figure in blood qi exclaimed, the blood qi dissipating to reveal a general in armor with fangs protruding from his mouth.

The purple-robed Daoist frowned deeply, “Impossible. The Dao Master couldn’t possibly have snuck into the Nine Provinces… unless…”

“Unless two Heaven-Venerable level existences concealed the heavenly secrets for me!” the figure on the war chariot finished his sentence.

“The Heaven-Venerables of your Nine Provinces are busy invading newly discovered worlds and have no time to spare, which gave us an opportunity!”

“That new world, was it also part of your conspiracy?” the person under the white hood asked.

“Not quite. We don’t have such a grand scheme. We didn’t conquer that world, but we did intentionally let you discover it to tie up your high-end combat power.” The figure on the war chariot stepped down. Wherever he walked, chaos shattered. He raised the bronze spear in his hand, still dripping blood, its surface flickering with an enchanting, bloody light.

“Don’t waste your energy. This area has been sealed by my formation. Your messages cannot be transmitted. Go to hell!” The spear thrust forward, piercing the universe. It was just a casual strike, not intentionally aimed, yet it was terrifying, as if the sky were collapsing and the earth caving in.

The four individuals unleashed all their might, their divine abilities blazing, runes filling the sky, and磅礴 energy surging. Yet, they could not halt the spear tip for even a moment.

*Bang!*

The four flew backward, their mechas shattering, purple qi dissipating, and blood scattering across the starry sky.

“The gap between you and me is too vast. Do not make futile resistance!” The mighty figure holding the spear was shrouded in chaotic mist, his appearance unclear, his voice resounding through the heavens like a morning bell and evening drum.
