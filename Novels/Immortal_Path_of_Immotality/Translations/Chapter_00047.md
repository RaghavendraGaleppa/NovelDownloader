# Chapter 47: The Chronicle of Guangnan

From the records in the jade slip, its original owner called himself the Wanderer of Guangnan, and it was created in the ninth year of the Yuanhe era during the Great Song Dynasty. Lin Shan compared this with the current timeline and found it to be about three hundred years ago.

The Wanderer of Guangnan was a sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator. According to his writings, he had only stumbled upon a cultivation technique in his twenties and was overjoyed at the time. After cultivating in the deep mountains for a full year and a half, he reached the peak of the third level of Qi Refinement.

Reading this, Lin Shan felt that the Wanderer of Guangnan's talent seemed similar to his own—he too had taken a year and a half. However, Lin Shan had cultivated in the city, where the spiritual energy in densely populated areas naturally couldn't compare to that of remote mountains and forests. Still, overall, the difference wasn't significant.

Continuing, Lin Shan read that after realizing how time-consuming it was to refine his acupoints, the Wanderer of Guangnan left the mountains to travel and search for spiritual springs and veins.

After all, if cultivation in the mortal world took ten years, wouldn't finding a place with ten or twenty times the spiritual energy make it a breeze to progress in just a few months?

But he soon discovered that all places with spiritual veins, regardless of their concentration, were already claimed.

Some were occupied by cultivation families, while others were dominated by demonic beasts. With his third-level Qi Refining strength, he couldn't afford to provoke any of them.

After three years of fruitless wandering, he returned home in disappointment. He spent another ten years painstakingly refining his cultivation before finally breaking through to the early stage of Qi Refining. By then, he was already in his forties.

Upon reaching the fourth level of Qi Refining, he found that he no longer faced bottlenecks and could cultivate without worry. So he continued living in his hometown, tending to his vegetable garden while quietly cultivating.

What a leisurely and carefree life!

It took him a full ten years to reach the peak of the sixth level of Qi Refining! But then, the second bottleneck appeared.

Seeing that someone with similar talent to his own needed ten years to go from the fourth to the sixth level of Qi Refining, Lin Shan couldn't help but be shocked! After calming himself and calculating his own age, he decided it wasn't entirely unacceptable and kept reading.

The Wanderer of Guangnan roughly estimated that, if he continued refining his cultivation alone, the bottleneck at the mid-stage of Qi Refining would take him thirty years to overcome.

By then, he would already be in his fifties. If he were to break through to the late stage of Qi Refining by his eighties, he would be close to death, with no hope of achieving immortality!

Realizing that he had started cultivating too late in life and lacked access to spiritual veins, he knew he couldn't continue his solitary cultivation. He descended the mountain to seek opportunities.

Eventually, he encountered a prince from the imperial family who had previously met other immortal masters from the cultivation world. Recognizing the Wanderer's occasional use of spells, the prince enthusiastically invited him to become a guest elder of the prince's estate. The compensation for this position was five spirit stones per year.

Having wandered for years without finding any leads, the Wanderer of Guangnan accepted the offer.

During his time as a guest elder, he gradually connected with other immortal masters serving under different princes through his patron's network.

They were all rogue cultivators—without wealth or backing—otherwise, they wouldn't be working for mortals.

After all, the spirit stone mines in the cultivation world were controlled by major sects. The only other sources were the vast territories of mortal princes, who might collect scattered spirit stones each year.

The cultivation world three hundred years ago had numerous sects of varying sizes, most hidden deep in the mountains. However, the Wanderer of Guangnan specifically noted the three top-tier sects within the Great Song Dynasty:

- **Violet Heaven Sect**—a Daoist sect whose foundational scripture, *The Violet Qi Heart Sutra*, was said to summon Violet Heaven Divine Lightning comparable to heavenly tribulations when mastered.
- **Dry Cloud Pavilion**—a sect specializing in artifact forging, responsible for half of the Great Song's magical instruments, with several master craftsmen among its ranks.
- **Beast Taming Valley**—a sect skilled in controlling spirit beasts and insects. It was said their mountains teemed with all manner of creatures, and their disciples were among the most feared in the cultivation world.

Beneath these three great sects were various cultivation families and smaller sects, each occupying their own spiritual veins. Even the weakest among them had Foundation Establishment cultivators, and some of the most powerful families and sects were rumored to have Golden Core ancestors overseeing them.

Reading this, Lin Shan's breathing quickened—this was exactly the information he had been seeking!

After reaching the peak of the ninth level of Qi Refining, cultivators would prepare for the Hundred-Day Foundation Establishment. Each failed attempt would damage their potential.

However, once successful, they would enter the second major stage of cultivation—Foundation Establishment, also known as Condensed Light or Condensed Qi, marking the initial fusion of energy and spirit!

At this stage, spiritual sense could extend outward, allowing for telepathic communication, sword flight, and detection within a hundred-meter radius. They could also abstain from mortal food entirely, doubling their lifespan to two hundred years!

Lin Shan couldn't help but yearn for such power.

A spiritual sense range of a hundred meters! Far surpassing anything in the Qi Refining stage—this was true cultivation.

Qi Refining was merely the beginning. Without sufficient strength, one could even be struck down by mortals.

Foundation Establishment was the real start of the immortal path—the beginning of sword flight.

The text briefly mentioned subsequent realms: Golden Core cultivators could live for four hundred years, while Nascent Soul cultivators could reach eight hundred. With life-extending elixirs, some might even become thousand-year-old monsters.

Each major realm doubled one's lifespan.

"Nascent Soul cultivators can live for a thousand years!"

This time, Lin Shan didn't let his ambitions run wild. These realms were still far beyond him. There would be time to explore those heights later—for now, he would take it step by step.

The Wanderer of Guangnan then continued his account. During his time as a guest elder, he met many rogue cultivators and learned of a small immortal city called "Silver Spring," which he spoke of highly.

It was said to be a market established by powerful rogue cultivators, inhabited entirely by immortal practitioners. Not only did it offer treasures, techniques, and pills from the cultivation world, but many cultivators also lived there long-term to cultivate, as it had its own spiritual veins.

However, the Wanderer didn't specify Silver Spring's exact location, leaving Lin Shan unsure where to find it three hundred years later. Still, he made a mental note to search for it in the future.

Later, another rogue cultivator serving a different prince invited the Wanderer to visit Silver Spring. Eager to go, he agreed without hesitation, and the two set off immediately.

Upon arriving, the Wanderer realized that compared to Silver Spring—a true immortal sanctuary—the mortal world outside was nothing but a barren wasteland. The difference in spiritual energy was incomparable!

Had he come here earlier to cultivate, he wouldn't have wasted his prime years stuck at the mid-stage of Qi Refining.

After exploring the market, the Wanderer concluded that "information disparity" was the greatest divide among rogue cultivators. To gain firsthand knowledge, insights, and even breakthroughs, he needed to stay in the immortal market.

Despite his companion's earnest warnings, he resigned from his position as a guest elder and, with his savings of sixty to seventy spirit stones, settled in Silver Spring to establish himself.

But when he truly tried to integrate, he realized he had been far too optimistic.
