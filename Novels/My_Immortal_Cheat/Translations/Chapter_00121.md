# Chapter 121: The Saint-Demon Appears

Mu Su's eyes were wide. He had never witnessed such a shocking scene. Numerous divine statues lay toppled on the ground. These were statues of gods, once incredibly sacred, but now discarded like trash. This was almost unimaginable. Indeed, as Ling Yu said, if this scene were to be revealed to the outside world, who knew what impact it would have, how many people's faith would crumble.

Ling Yu was also slightly dazed. Although it wasn't her first time seeing this place, it still deeply moved her. She had seen records in her own sect about this gathering place of gods. It was once covered in divine herbs, with all sorts of divine artifacts visible everywhere. Holy Spirit Apostles guarded the temples, making it a place yearned for by all followers of gods. Yet, now it had been reduced to this state, evoking sighs of emotion.

"Stop sighing. Let's go. There's still some distance."

Compared to Mu Su and Ling Yu, who were lost in sentiment, Zhou Tian had no such emotions to express. The victor becomes king, the vanquished a bandit; it had always been so since ancient times. If other realms had been defeated back then, the current situation would likely be reversed.

Hearing Zhou Tian's words, Mu Su and Ling Yu snapped back to reality, appearing somewhat pensive. They both nodded and resumed walking.

Due to the extremely harsh environment, Ling Yu activated a layer of purple shield, enveloping herself completely to ward off the omnipresent yellow sand. Grains of sand struck the shield, creating ripples. Mu Su did the same, a milky-white shield extending around him.

Zhou Tian spit out the sand in his mouth, glanced at the voluptuous and beautiful Ling Yu, then at the stoic-faced Mu Su. He decisively moved closer to Mu Su, grinning and revealing his pearly white teeth. "Little Mu, how do I usually treat you, huh?"

Mu Su gave a helpless expression, understanding what Zhou Tian was implying. His shield extended to cover both of them.

Ling Yu looked on, somewhat puzzled. She didn't understand why Zhou Tian wasn't using protective measures himself. Although she couldn't gauge Zhou Tian's exact strength, the terrifying wind blades he unleashed that day were still vivid in her memory. In her opinion, how could someone capable of producing such wind blades be weak?

"Why aren't you using protective measures yourself?"

Zhou Tian, enjoying his VIP treatment next to Mu Su, suddenly heard Ling Yu's question. He pondered for a moment before replying, "Do you know an important prerequisite for becoming the King of Gods?"

"..." Ling Yu turned her head away, muttering, "Guess I asked for that."

They weren't the only ones in the Myriad Gods Plain. Less than fifteen minutes into their journey, they encountered others—or, more accurately, humanoid creatures. They had grey-green skin and mighty physiques; even the smallest among them was twice as tall as Zhou Tian. Their eyes were as large as copper bells, and tusks protruded from their mouths. They wore only animal hides to cover their lower bodies and rode wolf-like mounts, nearly a *zhang* long, with black fur and ghastly green eyes, baring their teeth and drooling onto the ground.

Their group was much larger than Zhou Tian's, numbering in the dozens. They had no protective measures, simply walking through the pervasive yellow sand. When Zhou Tian spotted them, they also spotted him. Although their numbers outnumbered Zhou Tian's by more than tenfold, they actively avoided them, maintaining a distance that felt safe for both parties.

"They are from the Beast God Sect," Ling Yu said. "They were once known for their ferocity and bravery, but now they've learned to tolerate and retreat." Ling Yu sighed, "This is just a microcosm of the many sects in the Forsaken Land of Gods. Without the backing of their gods, many sects and races have changed considerably."

They walked for a while longer, encountering more and more people, but no conflicts arose. Either Zhou Tian's group yielded, or the other party did; no one wanted to cause trouble, until...

"They've been subtly following us," Ling Yu said to Zhou Tian, her eyes flashing.

"Do you know who they are?" Zhou Tian looked at the group of people, who were like leeches stuck to bone. They were short, dressed in peculiar attire, and had been following them ever since their encounter, no matter how they tried to lose them.

"They are from the Shadow Sect, just a minor sect. The Lord of Shadows doesn't hold a high position among the gods."

Lord of Shadows? A flash went through Zhou Tian's mind, recalling the group that ambushed them in the void. He remembered one of them being a Shadow God Lord.

"So, they want trouble?"

"It seems so. But a bunch of rats from the sewers dare to scheme against *me*!" Ling Yu revealed a ruthless smile, runes swirling in her hand, energy gathering and stirring, ready to strike.

Zhou Tian speechlessly glanced at Ling Yu, who exuded a gangster-like aura. "Such a good girl, forcibly molded into this."

Just as he was about to speak again, Zhou Tian's eyes suddenly narrowed. A person emerged from the pervasive yellow sand, their spotless white robe particularly conspicuous against the backdrop. White hair streamed behind them, and an invisible shield seemed to envelop their entire body, preventing any sand from coming close.

"Someone's coming out of the plain!" Ling Yu said with a frown. It wasn't uncommon to see people *in* the Myriad Gods Plain, as everyone was rushing towards Myriad Gods Mountain. But someone *emerging from* the plain was different.

The person seemed to have a destination in mind, heading directly towards Zhou Tian and his group. However, due to the angle, the Shadow Sect members happened to be in their path. It was clear that the Shadow Sect members also noticed him. Yet, the great battle Zhou Tian's group expected didn't occur. The Shadow Sect members had just surrounded him when, without any apparent movement from the man, all of them transformed into small, flickering, rainbow-colored creatures, no bigger than a thumb, fluttering transparent wings and circling around the white-robed figure. This made the man appear as if a god had descended, radiating immense holiness.

Zhou Tian's eyes narrowed slightly. "What a show-off entrance," he thought. "Looks like a big shot, not to be underestimated."

Ling Yu's gaze was incredibly serious. This person was unimaginably powerful. To transform one living being into another was a terrifying divine ability, one only gods possessed. She could only pray that what the person unleashed was merely an illusion, or that their target wasn't them.

However, to Ling Yu's disappointment, the white-robed man, accompanied by the little sprites, no longer walked but instantly appeared before their group with a flash of his figure.

The white-robed man reached up and plucked a mischievous sprite from his head. A helpless smile appeared on his demonic, handsome face. With red lips and white teeth, he was as warm and gentle as winter sunlight, his eyes shining brightly as if the sun, moon, and stars revolved within them. He spoke softly, "Zhou Tian, I just solved a problem for you. You really should thank me." His tone was as familiar as if he were conversing with a long-unseen friend.
