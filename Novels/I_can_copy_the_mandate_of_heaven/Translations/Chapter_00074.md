## Chapter 74: The Arrival of Jin Guang

The air was serene on the main peak of Qixuan Gate, with white clouds drifting lazily by. The atmosphere was tranquil, as if one could pluck the clouds from the sky with a mere stretch of their hand. 

Su Zongguang smiled warmly, "I dare not presume, but I would be eternally grateful if you could offer some guidance." With a wave of his hand, a short, gnarled-faced man with a flask of wine emerged. The elders surrounding Meng Weizhi frowned, none of them willing to speak up first.

It was apparent to those with a basic understanding of martial arts that this man was not like others. His steps were unsteady, and his eyes lacked vitality. He seemed to be a man of leisure, not someone trained in the art of combat. 

The elders glanced away, not willing to take the initiative. They were, after all, high-ranking members of Qixuan Gate, having taught martial arts to others for years. They saw no reason to lower themselves to engage with this man.

Meng Weizhi understood their unspoken reluctance. He called out a name, choosing Kou Yunfei, one of the 72 elders and the youngest in the group, from the Y幽堂, which had recently been promoted. This selection allowed Kou Yunfei to observe the mysterious man's skills and also provided a reasonable excuse, should he fail.

In the seating area, a middle-aged man in his forties, dressed in black, stood up. He had a commanding presence and bowed slightly to Jin Guang. 

"As one of Qixuan Gate's masters, I propose that Kou Yunfei engage with the Reverend Jin Guang," Meng Weizhi said with a smile. 

"Of course," Su Zongguang replied nonchalantly, exuding an air of confidence.

However, amidst the calm atmosphere, two individuals, Li Zhiming and Han Ke, grew restless. They recognized that Jin Guang was a cultivator, someone who practiced the mystic arts. 

How did a cultivator end up in the mortal realm, entangled in martial affairs? Li Zhiming pondered. 

In his six years at Qixuan Gate, he had never encountered anyone with a spiritual root, let alone a cultivator. According to his understanding, cultivators adhered to certain rules, refraining from interfering in mortal disputes.

Han Ke's eyes widened in shock as he gazed at Jin Guang. As a cultivator himself, he could see through Jin Guang's cultivation level. 

Jin Guang was at the fourth layer of the炼气境 (Lingqi realm), a relatively low level. Han Ke, on the other hand, had reached the fifth layer of the middle品境. 

Li Zhiming caught Han Ke's glance and noticed a flicker of concern. What was behind Han Ke's knowing look? 

As Kou Yunfei stepped forward, Li Zhiming's anxiety grew. He clutched the armrest, his palms sweating.

Kou Yunfei bowed to Jin Guang, who responded with a disdainful smile. Jin Guang took a sip from his flask and discarded it on the ground.

"This is a lovely place," Jin Guang said, surveying his surroundings. "It's a far cry from the bleakness of Heishi Gate."

He turned to Su Zongguang, saying, "Don't forget your promise, Su."

Su Zongguang repeatedly bowed, his expression sycophantic. 

The crowd's unease intensified. Despite their efforts, they couldn't discern anything unusual about Jin Guang.

Meng Weizhi almost rose from his seat, scanning the surroundings. Everything seemed ordinary.

Kou Yunfei, however, was on high alert. He bowed to Jin Guang, prepared for a potential fight.

Jin Guang's expression turned contemptuous. 

Today, the refined martial arts of Qixuan Gate would be no match for the power of a cultivator. They were about to witness despair and the overwhelming might of a higher realm.
