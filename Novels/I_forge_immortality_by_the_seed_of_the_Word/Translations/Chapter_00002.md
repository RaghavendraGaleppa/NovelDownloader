# Chapter 2: This Is a Sure Win

The sudden crow of a rooster pierced the air.  

Under the gray dawn sky, thin trails of cooking smoke curled upward.  

Inside the room, the oil lamp had long gone cold.  

Zhang Jing held a scripture in his hands, unmoving.  

After repeated readings, he had completely immersed himself in the world of the book.  

At some point, Zhang Jing's consciousness suddenly began to blur. The scenery of the room faded away bit by bit.  

He found himself in an ancient schoolhouse.  

Before him stood a lectern, upon which three white-haired elderly figures stood quietly, their expressions serene.  

Zhang Jing sat below, his face filled with confusion.  

"What is this...?"  

Just as the question arose in his mind, streams of characters began pouring from the mouths of the three elders, transforming into profound teachings. Listening carefully, he realized they were passages from the Three Books and Six Classics—yet far more profound!  

**"The Treatise of the Five Elements."**  

*"The Five Elements are the root of creation, the foundation of human relations. All things undergo transformation through them..."*  

*"The myriad phenomena are governed by the measure of five. Beyond five, numbers shift. They rely on the five energies, harmonizing the four seasons, nurturing all beings, shaping all things..."*  

Countless insights surged like waves in Zhang Jing's heart.  

...  

**[Three Books and Six Classics · Level 9 (9999/10000)]**  

...  

**[Three Books and Six Classics · Level 9 (10000/10000)]**  

A brilliant white light suddenly flared from the jade talisman before him. It shot straight into Zhang Jing's brow, entering his sea of consciousness and transforming into a mark woven from mysterious runes.  

Shaped like a seed, it took root in his sea of consciousness, emitting a faint glow.  

"What is this?" Zhang Jing awoke from his epiphany and immediately noticed the anomaly within himself. "My sea of consciousness? Why is there suddenly a strange seed here?"  

He then noticed that the skill displayed on the jade talisman had also changed.  

The original **[Three Books and Six Classics]**, along with its experience points and skill traits, had vanished completely. In its place was a solitary **[Low-Grade Dharma Seed: Mind's Eye]**.  

"What exactly is going on?" Zhang Jing's eyes widened. "Wait—this feeling..."  

Time passed slowly.  

Huuuu—  

A long exhale broke the silence.  

"Skills on the jade talisman evolve into so-called 'Dharma Seeds' after surpassing level nine? No—'metamorphosis' would be more accurate."  

Zhang Jing's heartbeat quickened.  

Because he realized that **[Low-Grade Dharma Seed: Mind's Eye]** provided him with far greater enhancement than the combined effects of the previous three skill traits. His thoughts were clearer and more agile, with insights constantly welling up from within.  

This sensation of sudden enlightenment was utterly intoxicating.  

And—  

Guided by an inexplicable intuition—  

"Mind's Eye!" Zhang Jing shouted.  

In the next moment, he felt his mental energy drain like floodwaters through an open sluice.  

Within his sea of consciousness, the previously dormant Mind's Eye Dharma Seed erupted with radiant light.  

In Zhang Jing's mind, a phantom eye abruptly opened.  

The outside world transformed. The trajectories of the wind, floating dust, tiny insects on the ground, and even minuscule cracks on the window—details previously imperceptible to the naked eye—instantly appeared before his vision.  

It was as though a veil had been lifted.  

A flood of information poured into Zhang Jing's mind through the Mind's Eye, all of which he effortlessly processed in an instant.  

Concepts that once seemed obscure were now crystal clear.  

"So this is the Mind's Eye Dharma Seed?" Zhang Jing struggled to adapt to this new perspective.  

But before he could fully adjust, an overwhelming exhaustion violently ejected him from the Mind's Eye state.  

Dazed for a long moment, Zhang Jing gradually regained his senses.  

Wiping the cold sweat from his brow, he began piecing together the extraordinary experience.  

The passive effects of the Mind's Eye Dharma Seed alone elevated his cognitive abilities to the level of a genius. Activating it plunged him into a terrifying state of rapid observation, analysis, learning, and enlightenment—akin to the legendary divine abilities of his past life!  

The only drawbacks were the immense mental strain and the inability to sustain the active state for more than a few breaths.  

But that hardly mattered. Zhang Jing was confident that once he stepped onto the path of immortal cultivation, he would endure longer—perhaps even maintain the Mind's Eye indefinitely.  

Provided, of course, he passed the upcoming Dragon Lake Dao Academy entrance examination.  

"With the Mind's Eye Dharma Seed and the jade talisman, this is a sure win!"  

The thought lifted a weight from his shoulders. Zhang Jing leaned back heavily into his chair and stretched lazily before turning to glance outside.  

The sky was bright.  

"It's about time."  

Zhang Jing straightened his expression, gathered his focus, quickly dressed, and pushed open the door.  

Outside was the central hall.  

A busy figure came into view.  

"Jing'er, you're awake! I was just about to call you." Mother Zhang rubbed her slightly swollen eyes and smiled. "Hurry and eat. Don't be late."  

On the table lay two peeled eggs, glistening and translucent, alongside steaming millet porridge and buns that filled the air with a mouthwatering aroma.  

"Your eyes...?"  

"Oh, it's nothing. Just the wind irritated them." Mother Zhang turned away hurriedly, her voice soft.  

Then, as if changing the subject, she added, "Jing'er, I've packed your bag. There's some silver inside—be careful with it."  

"I will, Mother."  

Zhang Jing paused.  

Seeing his mother's eyes reddening again after just two sentences, he opened his mouth but found no words.  

A short while later, outside the family's medicine shop—  

"Father, Mother, I'm off. Take care of yourselves. Oh, and since you're both so healthy, why not have another child?"  

Zhang Jing hoisted his bulging bag onto his shoulder and grinned as he bid farewell.  

"You foolish child! Spouting nonsense in broad daylight!" Mother Zhang's scolding followed him.  

"Hahaha, my dear wife, I think our son makes a fair point. Perhaps we should—"  

"Ah—! Wife, go easy! You'll tear my ear off—!"  

A sudden yelp startled two sparrows feasting on the eaves.  

...  

The sun had just peeked over the horizon, yet Yong'an City—the capital of Linshan Prefecture in Huizhou—was already bustling.  

In the western market district, horse-drawn carts and oxcarts inched through the crowded streets. Merchants, wandering swordsmen, exiled scholars, and villagers who had risen early to sell their wares all jostled for space.  

The clamor of haggling and hawking filled the air.  

"Coming through! Make way!"  

Zhang Jing weaved deftly through the throng, picking up speed.  

Meanwhile, five li away in the eastern district, within Yong'an Academy—  

Instructor Liu stood beneath an ancient, gnarled tree, hands clasped behind his back, his gaze distant. Unaware that the morning mist had dampened his robe.  

Before him stood a dozen or so youths, aged seventeen or eighteen, carrying packs on their backs. They waited in silence, though excitement flickered in their eyes.  

Instructor Liu's gaze swept over them subtly before he shook his head, his expression complex.  

There was a trace of hope, but mostly resignation.  

He knew exactly what these young men were thinking.  

But in the twenty-odd years he had presided over Yong'an Academy, every three years, he had selected countless students—none lacking in talent. Yet the number who succeeded could be counted on one hand.  

The path of immortal cultivation demanded both innate aptitude and fortune. Neither could be lacking.  

By Instructor Liu's estimation, none of these youths stood a chance.  

But his hopes weren't pinned on them anyway.  

"Surely our academy won't suffer another complete failure this time..."  

He sighed inwardly, a certain figure flashing through his mind.  

"Instructor!"  

A voice snapped him from his thoughts.  

Turning, Instructor Liu's face brightened with a kindly smile.  

"Zhang Jing, you've arrived. Have you settled matters at home? Did your parents not see you off?"  

"Instructor, everything's taken care of. It's not a long journey—I can manage on my own."  

Zhang Jing replied respectfully.  

He held deep reverence for Instructor Liu, who had always looked out for him.  

"Hah! Excellent spirit for one so young. The Dao Academy representatives will arrive shortly. Wait here."  

"Understood, Instructor."  

At the same time—  

"Instructor."  

A richly dressed youth with thick eyebrows and narrow eyes sauntered over, fanning himself with an embroidered folding screen depicting amorous scenes.  

"Bochang, you're here as well. Wait with the others."  

"Very well."  

The youth glanced around before sidling up to Zhang Jing.  

"Brother Zhang, you live farther away, yet you always arrive before me."  

"My mother rises early. By the way, Brother Ji, where's your luggage?" Zhang Jing asked curiously.  

"Luggage? What luggage?" The youth tapped his fan against his palm before pointing at Zhang Jing's bag. "Ah, you mean that? No need."  

"No need?"  

Recalling Instructor Liu's instructions and noting the others with their packs, Zhang Jing didn't press further.  

Ji Bochang's family background was extraordinary—perhaps they had their own arrangements.  

"Brother Zhang, what do you think of my fan's design?"  

Ji Bochang suddenly raised the folding screen with a proud grin.  

"The pose is... average."  

"Just average? Damn, I knew something was off! If you have time, I'd appreciate your guidance!"  

Ji Bochang's face fell momentarily before reigniting with determination as he earnestly sought Zhang Jing's advice.  

...  

Beneath the ancient tree, Instructor Liu withdrew his gaze.  

That youth, Ji Bochang, was Yong'an Academy's greatest hope this year.  

The Ji family was a powerful clan in Linshan Prefecture, with generations of cultivators in their lineage.  

Ji Bochang possessed exceptional talent and had been groomed by cultivators since childhood. His success in the Dragon Lake Dao Academy examination was all but guaranteed.  

"As for Zhang Jing..." Instructor Liu sighed. "If only he had half of Bochang's resources..."  

In over twenty years, he had never encountered a student as extraordinary as Zhang Jing.  

Rain or shine, the boy improved steadily—not swiftly, but with terrifying consistency. And once he learned something, it seemed etched into his mind forever.  

A pity his luck was lacking.  

Just as the thought crossed his mind—  

Screeee—!  

A clear crane's cry pierced the sky, and a sudden gust swept through the air.  

"They're here!" Instructor Liu straightened, his expression solemn.
