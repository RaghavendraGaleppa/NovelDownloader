# Chapter 114: Unexpected Events  

Li Shiming had no choice but to publicly disclose his killing of the Han family cultivators.  

The old monk Du Yuan had witnessed the incident firsthand. If Li Shiming tried to conceal it, he couldn't guarantee that the monk wouldn't reveal the truth. He didn't know who Du Yuan was, but he had to assume the worst.  

Although Du Yuan harbored no ill will toward him, the monk clearly wanted to recruit him into the Buddhist sect.  

Thus, Li Shiming decided to report the matter to his sect himself. Moreover, the trap Han Tianlei had set for him needed to be resolved upon his return.  

"Junior Brother, what do you intend to do?" The stationed cultivator snapped out of his shock, exchanging a glance of pleasant surprise with the middle-aged emperor before turning to Li Shiming.  

"I'll deal with Han Tianlei myself. After healing the spirit plant, I'll return to the sect. As for the Han family, I don’t wish for them to remain," Li Shiming replied calmly.  

From Han Yu's confession, he had learned that the conflict between the Han family and the imperial court had nearly become public. Many factions in Nanshan Country had already sided with the Han family, while the stationed cultivator, who stood with the imperial court, was also their enemy.  

Under normal circumstances, the stationed cultivator and the emperor wouldn’t have agreed to Li Shiming’s demand based solely on his word. But Li Shiming had demonstrated overwhelming strength—he had broken through a formation and presented the corpses of ten Han family mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators, who represented the entirety of their mid-tier forces.  

Now, the Han family was at their weakest, with only a few early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators left, whom the stationed cultivator could easily handle.  

"Junior Brother, the spirit plant is in the palace. I’ll take you there first. As for the Han family, I’ll deal with them after you heal the plant. The imperial court can make preparations in the meantime," the stationed cultivator said with a smile, extending an invitation.  

The spirit plant was located in the stationed cultivator’s courtyard, where a formation sustained the spiritual energy. The plant was a thousand-year-old peony, its vitality exceptionally strong, offering benefits to aging cultivators.  

"I’ll handle the healing. It’s a minor issue," Li Shiming assured, observing the wilted peony.  

"Then I’ll trouble you, Junior Brother. I’ll be back shortly!" The stationed cultivator’s face brightened with relief. The peony was crucial to him, and he had repeatedly requested the sect to send a spirit plant specialist, to no avail. Now, thanks to the Han family’s trap, Li Shiming had arrived to complete the task.  

This mission was troublesome—ordinary spirit plant specialists might not succeed, and the journey was too long for such a low-reward task.  

---  

Li Shiming nodded and began tracing the runes of the *Spring Breeze Nourishment Technique* in the air. As an intermediate-level spirit plant specialist, he could now control the size of the rain clouds he summoned.  

A small rain cloud formed above the peony, its mist-like droplets wrapping around the plant. The wilted peony immediately perked up.  

But Li Shiming didn’t stop there. With a flick of his finger, he cast the *Gengjin Technique*. Though it was a basic spirit plant spell, his mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivation enhanced its power and precision.  

Golden needles of energy drilled into the soil beneath the peony, probing the spiritual earth.  

A metallic *clang* echoed from the ground, followed by a golden-armored insect bursting out.  

"Ah, it’s a Golden Light Winged Beetle!" Ren Fei’er, who had been quietly observing, exclaimed in surprise.  

Seeing Li Shiming summon his flying sword to strike the beetle, she quickly grabbed his arm. Though she couldn’t use much spiritual energy, she had other means.  

She produced a talisman and flicked it toward the beetle. The talisman transformed into a spiderweb, ensnaring the insect. Despite its struggles, the beetle couldn’t break free.  

Ren Fei’er then took out a jade box, used a spiritual hand to place the beetle inside, and sealed it with a spiritual pattern.  

"The Golden Light Winged Beetle is one of the rare insects recorded in the *Compendium of Exotic Insects*. You can learn insect-control techniques later to command it," she explained softly under Li Shiming’s questioning gaze.  

Li Shiming had never heard of the *Compendium of Exotic Insects* or insect-control techniques.  

"What’s the use of this beetle?" he asked, eyeing the jade box she handed him.  

"If you sell this beetle to a cultivator skilled in insect control, it’s worth at least a thousand spirit stones," Ren Fei’er replied, simplifying the explanation.  

"So it’s that valuable? I’ll keep it safe, then." Li Shiming didn’t hesitate—this was his rightful reward for completing the mission. He stowed the jade box in his storage pouch.  

A loud *boom* echoed in the distance, accompanied by intense spiritual energy fluctuations.  

"Stay here. I’ll go check," Li Shiming told Ren Fei’er. But seeing her reluctant expression, he amended, "You must have ways to protect yourself, but don’t stray too far, or I won’t be able to cover you."  

"Understood. You’re so fussy!" Ren Fei’er giggled and nodded.  

---  

Ren Fei’er rode her paper crane while Li Shiming flew with his wings toward the source of the disturbance.  

They arrived quickly at the battlefield, where the stationed cultivator was locked in combat with a black-robed cultivator.  

Ren Fei’er recognized the black-robed man as a disciple of the Profound Nether Sect. If the man had recognized her, the battle would have ended immediately.  

Li Shiming also identified the man’s techniques—he was a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator, matching the stationed cultivator’s strength.  

It was unclear how the Han family had colluded with this Profound Nether cultivator, but regardless, the Han family was finished. As long as the witnesses survived, their alliance with the enemy sect would be confirmed.  

The stationed cultivator, though powerful, was aging and lacked stamina. The Profound Nether cultivator, however, grew fiercer as the battle progressed. He paid little attention to Li Shiming’s arrival—one more mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator wouldn’t change the outcome.  

Ren Fei’er’s spiritual energy fluctuations were heavily suppressed by Buddhist energy, making it difficult for others to discern her true cultivation level unless they got close.  

"Junior Brother, flee! Report this to the sect! I’ll hold him off!" the stationed cultivator shouted urgently upon seeing Li Shiming.  

If all sect disciples perished here, it would be meaningless. But if Li Shiming escaped, the sect would avenge them.  

Had the stationed cultivator not spoken up, Li Shiming might have considered retreating to avoid exposing his full strength.  

Instead, Li Shiming waved his hand, summoning a bronze corpse.  

The corpse wielded a massive low-grade axe and roared as it charged the Profound Nether cultivator.  

"Senior Brother, I’ll assist you!" Li Shiming called out.  

He stayed airborne with Ren Fei’er, his Green Kite Wood Sword transforming into a streak of light, its blade gleaming with sword energy.  

He didn’t join the fight directly—he knew his limits. While he had killed ten mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators earlier, they were rogue cultivators, vastly inferior to sect disciples.  

A late-stage Profound Nether cultivator was terrifying, as he had experienced before. Staying out of the fray was the wisest choice.  

The stationed cultivator was surprised but not shocked by the bronze corpse. The Heavenly Sea Sect also had corpse-refining techniques, though few disciples practiced them.  

The Profound Nether cultivator, however, paled in horror. The bronze corpse was crafted using the *Profound Nether Corpse Refining Method*, and its single-spiritual-root quality was exceedingly rare—even within the Profound Nether Sect, such corpses were few.  

Single-spiritual-root corpses required sacrificing a single-spiritual-root genius. Such talents were already rare, and no sect would willingly waste them on corpse refinement.  

A single-spiritual-root genius could easily reach Foundation Establishment, but turning them into a corpse depended on the master’s cultivation. Most corpse-refining cultivators weren’t single-spiritual-root themselves.  

Li Shiming split a sliver of his consciousness to control the corpse. From a distance, his IBMz15 analyzed the battle, granting him an unparalleled grasp of the situation.  

The stationed cultivator unleashed a pillar of fire, forcing the Profound Nether cultivator to dodge. The enemy turned into a black streak, attempting to close the distance.  

But as he moved, the bronze corpse’s axe descended with terrifying force, tearing through the air.  

The Profound Nether cultivator barely avoided the strike, only to find the corpse relentlessly pursuing him.  

With the corpse occupying the enemy, the stationed cultivator could freely unleash long-range attacks.  

Yet, defeating the Profound Nether cultivator wouldn’t be easy. The man was familiar with corpse techniques and employed sinister methods, prolonging the stalemate.  

"Big Brother, you have a bronze corpse too? I’ve always wanted one, but Mother won’t let me!" Ren Fei’er said, recognizing the *Profound Nether Corpse Refining Method*. Her tone was a mix of awe and envy.  

Li Shiming imagined Ren Fei’er, a young girl, lugging around a hulking corpse. The image was unsettling.  

"Why would a child want to play with corpses?" he muttered, shaking his head.  

"You’re only a year older than me! Who are you calling a child?" Ren Fei’er pouted indignantly.  

"Fine, you’re not a child. But I didn’t refine this corpse—it’s spoils of war," Li Shiming conceded, changing the subject.  

"Your corpse is so plain. I’ve read about cultivators who modify corpses—like grafting half a spirit beast’s body onto them. A spider’s lower half with a corpse’s upper body makes for a fun hybrid!" Ren Fei’er said, unbothered by his teasing.  

"That’s possible?" Li Shiming didn’t recall such methods in the *Profound Nether Corpse Refining Method*.  

Corpses could be repaired with additional flesh and bones, but the process was slow and risked weakening the corpse. Most cultivators left minor damage untreated.  

"I’ll look it up when we return. It definitely exists!" Ren Fei’er insisted.  

The Profound Nether cultivator, realizing Li Shiming controlled the corpse, repeatedly tried to charge at him. But the corpse intercepted him each time, aided by the stationed cultivator’s attacks.  

Just as the enemy prepared a secret technique, a voice echoed in his ears:  

"Get lost!"  

The *Demonic Whisper*, delivered in the Profound Nether Sect’s unique tone, sent him fleeing in terror. He transformed into a black streak and vanished into the distance.  

The bronze corpse couldn’t match his speed, nor could the stationed cultivator’s spells catch up.  

The stationed cultivator was stunned. Though they had the upper hand, prolonging the battle would have been risky due to his dwindling stamina.  

"Big Brother, I have to go now. Here’s a communication token. Contact me when you return to the sect, or I’ll never speak to you again!" Ren Fei’er said unhappily, glancing at the empty air before handing Li Shiming a jade token.  

"This can really reach you?" Li Shiming asked skeptically. Then, recalling something, he added, "Your injuries aren’t fully healed. Are you sure you’ll be safe returning alone?"  

"My family’s coming to pick me up. Hurry back—I still want to hear your stories!" Ren Fei’er said, her reluctance evident.  

"Be careful," Li Shiming said, waving.  

Ren Fei’er flew off on her paper crane. Li Shiming watched his crane depart but didn’t protest—he had the superior Black Sparrow Wings now.

"Little Junior Sister, do you fancy that boy? Should I kidnap him for you?" a Foundation Establishment cultivator joked upon seeing Ren Fei’er.  

As a disciple of Elder Ren, she held a privileged position. In the sect, strength usually dictated hierarchy, but the children of Golden Core elders were exceptions.  

"Mind your own business!" Ren Fei’er retorted with a pout.  

She was only obedient around a select few—this disciple of her mother’s wasn’t one of them.
