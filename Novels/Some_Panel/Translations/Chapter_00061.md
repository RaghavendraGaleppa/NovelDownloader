# Chapter 61: Root Bone Improvement, Combat

Everyone felt quite regretful that the exchange for the great divine ability art, Golden Light Earth Shrinkage, had fallen through.

They then stopped mentioning it and chatted about other things until evening, when True Monarch Changye finally departed with Chang Yuan.

Inside the secret chamber, Yang Ji took out two gleaming white pills. Each pill contained immense medicinal power – these were Cleansing Spirit Pills, sacred pills capable of improving one's root bone.

Above Spirit Pills are Treasure Pills, and only above Treasure Pills are Saint Pills. Saint Pills are unseen in the Thousand Islands Sea Region because there are no spiritual ingredients available to refine them. Such ingredients generally need to be over a thousand years old, and more than one stalk is usually required. These kinds of heavenly spiritual essences have long been picked clean over the long years, making them almost impossible to find. Only super sects like the Dao Sect can continuously cultivate and supply them using immortal artifacts. This is their true depth of heritage.

The fragrance emanating from these Saint Pills was so rich that a single sniff invigorated one's spirit. Yang Ji glanced at them twice, then swallowed both pills at once.

Immediately, waves of medicinal power spread, and he felt his body begin to heat up, accompanied by a tingling sensation in his lower abdomen. He knew the medicine was taking effect, as he could feel his root bone slowly becoming more transparent.

Three days slowly passed, and the medicinal power of both Cleansing Spirit Pills was fully absorbed. Yang Ji looked at himself:

[Root Bone: Medium-grade]

His root bone had improved from low-grade to medium-grade. This change truly delighted Yang Ji.

Immediately, he eagerly swallowed a Demonic Essence Pill. A day later, it had surprisingly increased his cultivation by 120 points. Normally, it would only be 80 points, so this was an extra 40 points. This meant that the cultivation efficiency of a medium-grade root bone had increased by 50% compared to a low-grade root bone. This speed of cultivation filled Yang Ji with pleasant surprise. It meant the time it would take him to break through to the Foundation Establishment Middle Stage would be significantly shortened.

Yang Ji carefully sensed the changes in his root bone, then composed himself, letting the spiritual energy vortex refine the pills on its own, while he began comprehending arts.

Three days later, Jian Yuanzi delivered the sect's only great divine ability movement art to him, called Heavenly Cycle Displacement.

Yang Ji meticulously comprehended it for a day and then understood why this movement art was called Heavenly Cycle Displacement. This art could generate a force within the body. This force could transform into a roaming dragon, circulating through the four limbs, bones, and meridians. The roaming dragon would travel at extreme speed, generating several streams of Heavenly Cycle Displacement force, making the body seem as if it were being pulled by true dragons, allowing for extremely fast shifts and evasions. The speed was astonishing, and the movement was as exquisite and agile as a roaming dragon, making one's movements unpredictable.

Yang Ji spent ten days comprehending this great divine ability art. With his Golden Finger's insight and error-correction abilities, he quickly mastered it.

Now, as soon as he activated the movement art, streams of white energy quickly gathered within his body, moving according to his will, rapidly circulating. With a flash of spiritual light on his body, and the internal force roaming dragon stirring, his figure seemed to instantly shift, appearing on the left side of the secret chamber. The internal force roaming dragon moved again, and Dao charm overflowed from within him, making him appear on the right side of the secret chamber. Then, with the roaming dragon darting about within him, he began to shift on the spot like a roly-poly toy. His figure was ethereal; he could cover several meters in an instant, and within a mere inch, his movements were incredibly agile and fluid, far more dynamic than the footwork of the Lightness Art.

At this point, he had the True Adamant Divine Art for cultivation, Heavenly Cycle Displacement for movement, Guicang Sword Art for offense, and the Human-form Weapon Body Cultivation Art for defense. Now, his ultimate Daoist arsenal was only missing a Dao-tier speed art.

Yang Ji was very satisfied. Compared to those geniuses, he too had accumulated some significant foundation. Looking towards the path to immortality, he felt even greater courage and confidence.

Cultivation knows no time; five years swiftly passed. Within these five years, Yang Ji had successfully broken through to the Foundation Establishment Middle Stage. It was in this fifth year that Jian Yuanzi sent him a telepathic message.

"Disciple, come out for a moment."

Hearing this, Yang Ji opened his eyes, slowly concluded his cultivation, and stepped out of the secret chamber. Outside, Jian Yuanzi was waiting.

Seeing the tags [Depressed] and [Annoyed] hovering above his master's head, Yang Ji couldn't help but ask in a deep voice, "Master, has something happened?"

"Fifty years ago, while resisting a beast tide, Granny Tianshang of the Evergreen Sect and I discovered a Heavenly Spirit Fruit tree in a secret cave on a desolate island. It had four spirit fruits, but they weren't ripe yet."

"Granny Tianshang and I agreed that once the spirit fruits matured, we would each take two."

"But when I went to that desolate island today, Granny Tianshang, seeing how tempting the spirit fruits were, actually wanted to monopolize them!" Jian Yuanzi said, vexed.

"Granny Tianshang? The most senior Nascent Soul True Monarch of the Evergreen Sect? She wants to fight you, Master?" Yang Ji frowned.

"That's not it. Although your master was expelled by the Dao Sect, my strength in this Thousand Islands Sea Region is second only to the Three Supremes. She wouldn't dare be presumptuous in front of me."

"But she used an underhanded trick; she secretly placed a restriction on the spirit fruits. If I were to pick them, they would be destroyed."

"She doesn't want to split them equally and has proposed another distribution method: a duel!"

Jian Yuanzi said with slight indignation, "Granny Tianshang challenged me to two duels, but we can only use our own disciples."

"She knows full well that Chang Xiao is my disciple, invincible below the Nascent Soul True Monarch realm, yet she still proposed a duel. She's relying on her eldest disciple having broken through to the Nascent Soul True Monarch realm recently."

"Furthermore, her challenging me to two duels is also a little trick. She thinks I only have Chang Xiao as a disciple, so she'd win the second round without a fight. She's quite shrewd in her calculations."

"These Heavenly Spirit Fruits are excellent things. If you use them, your cultivation speed will greatly increase. I absolutely will not give them up."

"She doesn't know that although Chang Xiao is only a Golden Core True Person, after five years of arduous cultivation, his arts have reached a consummate level, and his combat power is enough to defeat an ordinary Nascent Soul True Monarch."

"If she had agreed to split the fruits normally, she would have gotten two. If she plays dirty, I'll make sure she doesn't get a single one."

"Disciple, let's go. Later, you'll also pick a Foundation Establishment opponent to fight. With your comprehension and your understanding of arts, you are definitely not someone her mediocre disciples can compare to."

Thinking of his two outstanding disciples, Jian Yuanzi's vexation eased considerably.

Yang Ji, with his Golden Finger, could see others' weaknesses and flaws, and even discern the power of every move they made, whether to attack or evade. He was confident and could respond freely. Facing opponents of the same realm, he had no fear at all.

He nodded in agreement, "Understood, Master!"

Then, he looked around the main hall and asked, "Where is Senior Brother Chang Xiao? Where is he?"

"Chang Xiao has already gone ahead to the desolate island. He's monitoring that old hag to prevent her from making any moves and picking the fruits early," Jian Yuanzi replied.

"I see!" Yang Ji nodded.

"In that case, disciple, let us depart." Jian Yuanzi immediately grabbed Yang Ji and teleported out of the hall, flying towards a desolate island in the Monstrous Stench Sea Region.

Nascent Soul True Monarchs moved with extreme speed. The scenery of the world changed rapidly as they swiftly transformed into two streaks of light and landed on a desolate island.

Li Chang Xiao, sensing their arrival, walked over with a smile. "Master, Junior Brother, you've arrived."

"Senior Brother!" Yang Ji greeted him with a smile.

Li Chang Xiao had been in seclusion for five years, and his overall demeanor hadn't changed much, but the aura he exuded was even more powerful. The sharpness he possessed was like a calm sea; once unleashed, it would be a surging, terrifying storm.
