# Chapter 33: The Talent of a Pill King

Though Wei Qian was curious about Wang Shanyin's true condition, reason told him that as a mere Qi Refining cultivator, it was best not to pry into the private affairs of a Foundation Establishment expert. Otherwise, he might end up dead in an ugly way.

So without stopping, he walked through a long corridor and halted before the door of Room C-16. The heavy stone door had a corresponding indentation where he placed his token. After a moment, a rumbling sound echoed as the door swung open.

The center of the pill refinement chamber housed a black medicinal cauldron. In one corner were neatly stacked, exquisitely shaped beast charcoal. Wei Qian intended to attempt refining "Qi Replenishing Pills." Before coming to this alchemy workshop, he had already purchased enough ingredients for ten batches.

"Ten batches should be enough to test my alchemy talent," Wei Qian thought. Though he possessed the golden finger [Wishing Dragon Pearl], he still hoped his innate talent in this area wouldn't be too poor. For instance, if he had been born with superior spiritual roots, he would have likely reached the peak of Qi Refining by now and begun preparing for Foundation Establishment, rather than remaining a mere fifth-level Qi Refining cultivator.

He arranged the beast charcoal beneath the cauldron and with a wave of his hand, ignited them with spiritual flames. As roaring flames erupted under the cauldron, Wei Qian focused intently, taking out the ingredients for the Qi Replenishing Pills and beginning the refinement process according to the formula.

While Wei Qian attempted alchemy, Wang Shanyin and Alchemist Ge were discussing matters in the outer passage.

"Speaking of which, didn't the Xiao family promise to compensate your Wang family?" Alchemist Ge stroked his long beard. "Why seek distant solutions when better ones are near at hand? Why not send your disciple to study with the Xiao family?"

Two years prior, during an auction hosted by the Wang family at Blackwater Pond, a Golden Core demonic cultivator had attacked. Afterwards, the Xiao family promised suitable compensation to the Wang family. This wasn't common knowledge, but in a place like [Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City], it was no secret.

Wang Shanyin smiled smugly. "That disciple of mine only has modest talent. He only succeeded on his fifth attempt, producing a defective pill. It wasn't until the ninth batch that he refined a passable standard-grade pill."

"The Xiao family's promise isn't something money can buy. If his talent were slightly better, the family might support him." If the disciple showed potential to become a second-rank alchemist, for instance, the family would certainly back him.

Hearing this, Alchemist Ge made an ambiguous clicking sound. "Hmph, in my day, I refined a standard-grade pill on my fifth attempt, which earned me my master's favor. Unfortunately, my talent was lacking in the end. It was my junior brother who inherited our master's legacy—he succeeded on his third attempt, producing a standard-grade pill, and by the fifth batch, he made a premium-grade one!" Alchemist Ge sighed deeply.

Decades later, he could only flaunt his status in this alchemy workshop, while his junior brother had become a second-rank alchemist, married a woman from the Xiao family, and risen to become their guest elder. Their statuses were now worlds apart.

Seeing that he couldn't sway Alchemist Ge, Wang Shanyin didn't waste further effort. Mentioning other matters, he soon departed. His true purpose in coming to the workshop was to purchase healing pills; attempting to recruit Alchemist Ge had merely been a side endeavor.

With Wang Shanyin gone, Alchemist Ge finally had time to ponder other matters—such as Wei Qian, who had entered the alchemy chamber earlier. "That lad must be trying his hand at alchemy. I wonder how talented he is," Alchemist Ge mused.

Inside the chamber, half an hour later, Wei Qian stared in astonishment at the twelve freshly refined Qi Replenishing Pills in the cauldron.

"Judging by their luster and aroma, these are undoubtedly standard-grade. But this is only my second attempt..."

After just one failure, Wei Qian had achieved complete success on his second refinement. Having studied the alchemy inheritance text, he knew his talent in pill refinement was extraordinary.

"I actually have the makings of a Pill King!" Wei Qian marveled. "With talent like this, even the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao family would deem me worthy of cultivation. But... why?"

Wei Qian had mentally prepared himself for poor alchemical aptitude—after all, trash-to-treasure stories were common. Yet fate had played a colossal joke on him: he was a genius!

After much deliberation, Wei Qian attributed his talent to his reincarnation. "A key requirement for becoming an alchemist is possessing stronger soul power than ordinary cultivators. As a reincarnated soul, my innate spiritual strength must surpass others', explaining my exceptional alchemical aptitude."

To confirm this, he would need to wait until his Foundation Establishment breakthrough. Upon reaching that stage, a cultivator's soul power could manifest externally as divine sense. Normally, a Foundation Establishment cultivator's divine sense extended a hundred zhang (about 300 meters). If his soul power truly exceeded the norm, his divine sense range would far surpass that.

For now, Wei Qian continued refining. His final three batches all yielded premium-grade pills—each adorned with faint circular patterns: pill patterns! Pills with such markings sold for 30-50% more than standard-grade ones. Exceptionally patterned pills could fetch double or triple the price.

Two hours later, when Wei Qian emerged from the chamber and returned to the passage, Wang Shanyin had long since departed, leaving only Alchemist Ge.

"How did your refinement go?" Alchemist Ge asked abruptly.

Wei Qian immediately adopted a look of shame. "This junior... only succeeded in producing a standard-grade pill on the seventh attempt."

"Some talent, but minimal," Alchemist Ge judged internally. He couldn't resist asking further, "Are you from a cultivation family or a rogue cultivator?"

"A rogue cultivator."

Alchemist Ge shook his head. For a clan cultivator, such modest talent might allow some progress in alchemy. But for a rogue cultivator... "You should abandon the alchemical path. Don't waste your spirit stones." With that, he waved Wei Qian away.

As he left, Wei Qian scoffed inwardly, "If you knew my true talent, you wouldn't dare say such things." But he quickly dismissed the urge to boast. Concealing his aptitude was a carefully considered decision—a commoner is guiltless, but treasuring jade becomes a crime.

Had he been surnamed Xiao, Wei Qian would gladly have displayed his gifts, possibly earning mentorship from a Core Formation-stage, third-rank alchemist. But he wasn't. One needed only recall Lu Ping—what had his outstanding talisman talent brought him?

Of course, Wei Qian could choose to sell himself to the Xiao family. Displaying his talent would likely earn him an offer to marry into their lineage. But joining under such terms would undoubtedly involve restrictive measures to prevent betrayal. The mere thought extinguished any inclination Wei Qian had to switch allegiances.
