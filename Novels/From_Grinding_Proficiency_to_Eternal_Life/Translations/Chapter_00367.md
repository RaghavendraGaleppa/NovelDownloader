# Chapter 367: Hundred Skeletons Penetrating the Nether Technique

"Wait!"

Seeing that Xu Yunfan remained unmoved, Youquan's shrill screams from within the Purple Gold Pill nearly pierced eardrums. Threads of true energy churned frantically within the pill, terrified that Xu Yunfan might refine him with a single thought.

"Since you obtained the Primordial Order from that Jiang Xu, you must know the wonders of the 'Heart Sutra of Stillness and Micro Dust' he carried!"

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. "It seems you know Jiang Xu?"

"Naturally, I know him. That man is extremely narcissistic, a true disciple of the Micro Dust Peak..." Youquan's voice carried a tone of schadenfreude. "Who would have thought he would meet his end in the Divine Martial Realm. Excellent, truly excellent."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's expression turn impatient, Youquan quickly shut his mouth.

The surface of the Purple Gold Pill suddenly浮现密密麻麻的经脉纹路. "The people of this realm are born lacking the twelve main meridians, and I..."

The demonic voice suddenly lowered, carrying an enchanting tremor. "...am perfectly capable of reshaping your meridians!"

Xu Yunfan's fingertip paused. The originally boiling Ten Extremities True Qi receded like a tide, parting layer by layer.

The Purple Gold Pill hovered three inches above Xu Yunfan's palm. The true energy within Youquan churned violently, suddenly condensing into a precise phantom of the human body's meridians. Three main meridians glowing with an eerie purple light were particularly prominent within the phantom, pulsing faintly like blood-stained river channels.

"See it clearly?" Youquan's voice couldn't hide its pride. "You people of the Divine Martial Realm are born lacking the Taiyin, Shaoyang, and Xuanshu spiritual meridians. This is precisely why the 'Heart Sutra of Stillness and Micro Dust' cannot be practiced!"

Youquan's tone became somewhat affected. "The 'Hundred Skeletons Penetrating the Nether Technique,' secretly passed down by the Primordial Sect, can reshape the innate meridian system. If supplemented with the Meridian Opening Pill..."

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly.

He had indeed pondered over the 'Heart Sutra of Stillness and Micro Dust' for a long time. When he tested it on a mortal body back then, he discovered that the meridian system of this realm's people differed fundamentally from what the cultivation method described.

A clever housewife cannot cook without rice. Although his true energy was as vast as a mountain, it could only circulate within his flesh and blood. However, the mortal body终究 has its limits. To advance further, one naturally needs to integrate the internal and external. And to integrate the internal and external, one needs the meridian network within the body as a foundation.

The meridian diagram Youquan displayed now was identical to the spiritual meridian paths recorded in the "Three Voids Return to Truth" chapter of the heart sutra.

Xu Yunfan said indistinctly, "You are quite knowledgeable. A disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak actually knows the true cultivation scripture of the Micro Dust Peak."

Youquan's speech abruptly stopped. He couldn't help but let out two dry laughs. "Please forgive me, sir. After all, the peaks are in competition, so I naturally needed to learn a thing or two. Moreover, the meridian network within your body, even if practicing the Hundred Desires Peak's methods, would need reshaping."

Seeing Xu Yunfan's expression turn slightly off, the true energy within the pill suddenly contracted, and Youquan sped up his words: "Sir, since you have read the heart sutra, you should know the key phrase: 'Qi travels through Xuanshu like a boat against a waterfall.' Without these three spiritual meridians, even if your true energy is as vast as the heavens..."

Before he could finish, the Purple Gold Pill was suddenly clenched within Xu Yunfan's five fingers, and Youquan instantly fell silent, trembling.

Xu Yunfan's fingertip blazed with golden light. The Ten Extremities True Qi surged out like a raging tide, enveloping the Purple Gold Pill layer by layer. Although the true energy contained within the Purple Gold Pill was of a far higher quality than true qi, within this vast torrent of true qi, it was like ice and snow meeting the blazing sun, being消融 inch by inch.

The demonic face formed by Youquan's qi twisted violently, letting out a piercing shriek.

It truly never expected that this武者, who seemed to appear out of nowhere, could use quantity to trigger a qualitative change, using a massive amount of true qi to forcefully grind down high-level true energy.

"You seem quite accustomed to this matter?" Xu Yunfan's tone was indifferent, but he felt a hint of probing in his heart. That so-called Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm was perhaps very large.

Youquan's aura fluctuated slightly, as if weighing his words. But under Xu Yunfan's oppressive gaze and his aura becoming increasingly沉凝 like the prelude to a storm, he replied: "The Taihua Spirit Ruins Realm is vast, with diverse populations. Although all belong to the human race, their physical constitutions often have subtle differences. The Primordial Sect specializes in this field, hence creating the 'Hundred Skeletons Penetrating the Nether Technique.' Supplemented with the Meridian Opening Pill, it can reshape the meridian network, allowing those of different bloodlines to adapt to the sect's cultivation methods."

"How does one obtain the Meridian Opening Pill?" Xu Yunfan went straight to the core.

Upon hearing this, Youquan's demonic core trembled, and he couldn't help but let out a few piercing cackles. But immediately remembering the ruthless methods of the person before him, his laughter cut off abruptly. The demonic energy even收敛几分, and he said resentfully: "The Meridian Opening Pill is specially crafted by the Primordial Sect, used to open up meridians for mortals. If used with the 'Hundred Skeletons Penetrating the Nether Technique,' it can reconstruct the internal meridian network. Although it cannot improve bone aptitude, it can slightly enhance affinity with spiritual energy, making cultivation twice the result with half the effort."

He paused, a hint of helplessness透露 from the demonic energy: "Outside, this pill can be exchanged for sect contribution points, but in this realm..."

The Purple Gold Pill flickered slightly, Youquan seemed to be observing Xu Yunfan's reaction. "I'm afraid there is truly no way."

Xu Yunfan's gaze darkened slightly. The demonic energy between his fingers suddenly tightened, and Youquan immediately let out a piercing shriek.

"You seem to have forgotten your situation," Xu Yunfan said coldly. "If the Meridian Opening Pill cannot be obtained, then the value of the 'Hundred Skeletons Penetrating the Nether Technique' is greatly reduced, and you..."

Golden light flashed faintly at his fingertip. The Ten Extremities True Qi, like a sharp blade, cut into the demonic core. "...to me, are only worth refining."

Youquan's demonic energy churned frantically, hurriedly saying: "Wait! Although there are no ready-made Meridian Opening Pills, but... but the Xuanhuang Qi of the dragon veins in this realm is abundant. If it can be refined and purified, it might not be impossible to imitate!"

His words came out extremely fast, afraid that Xu Yunfan would lose patience. "The main material of the Primordial Sect's Meridian Opening Pill is originally condensed from the spiritual veins of a realm. And you can absorb the Xuanhuang Qi of this realm. As long as you find a suitable method of pill refinement..."

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed with a hint of golden light. He loosened his grip imperceptibly. He naturally did not believe this statement. Youquan's words were half true and half false, only half could be listened to. The so-called suitable method of pill refinement was at least not in this Divine Martial Realm.

"Speak of the Hundred Skeletons Penetrating the Nether Technique," he said. His voice was cold like a quenched blade edge. If Youquan hesitated even slightly, he would face thunderous killing intent.

Youquan's demonic energy churned violently, hurriedly saying: "This method requires first using spiritual energy as a guide, mixing flesh and blood within the body, to form a Nether Seed..."

As he recited the口诀 at a rapid pace, Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged, simply listening quietly and intently.

But deeper, the attribute panel that only he could see remained沉寂 like dead water, not even showing a hint of a prompt.

When Youquan said, "It requires gathering the essence of moonlight to nourish the Yinqiao meridian," Xu Yunfan suddenly pointed like a sword. Pure Yang true energy transformed into a golden thread as fine as a hair and pierced into the core of the demonic energy.

"Ah!!"

Youquan let out a scream that did not sound human. The Purple Gold Pill, no larger than a palm, was burned through with dozens of holes by the golden thread.

"Why did you do this, sir?"

"You recited a false scripture. Why do you think?" Xu Yunfan looked coldly at the attribute panel, which still showed no reaction.
