# Chapter 60: Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast!

As Zhou Tian’s drool was about to drip onto the table, Emperor Qin finally stopped his rambling. With a flick of his finger, golden runes appeared on the central carpet, converging and evolving until they formed a mirror-like object. Scene after scene flashed across its surface:

Monks in kasayas, Daoists in robes, warriors in magnificent mechas, assassins shrouded in white hoods. The figures of Zhou Zui, Liu Yan, and Zhou Xun Chuan also flashed by one by one. These were all the participants of the elite competition.

There were about fifty people in total. Other state powers contributed two to three individuals each, with the remaining participants all being from the Heavenly Qin Empire.

"Let us witness the performance of these young talents!" Emperor Qin said with a smile, as a golden tassel extended from his finger and entered the mirror.

As if on cue, one by one, the contestants were enveloped in silver runes and transported into a secret realm. Golden symbols floated up from the mirror, hovering above it, exactly fifty in number. Upon closer inspection, they were the names of the contestants.

The scene in the secret realm shifted. Primordial divine mountains stood tall, majestic and treacherous, like countless sharp swords. Each ancient tree was thousands of zhang high, with even the vines coiling around their bark being as thick as a fist, speckled with golden spots. Their canopies spread like umbrellas, allowing only sparse sunlight to filter through the gaps. The mountains were far from quiet; savage beasts roared, shaking the land and rivers, causing myriad trees to tremble and leaves to rustle down.

Amidst the countless mountains and valleys, ferocious beasts roamed rampant, and ancient vestiges of species emerged. All sorts of terrifying sounds rose and fell, as if threatening to tear the very heavens and earth apart.

“Wooo…”

A gust of strong wind swept through, and a black cloud appeared overhead, covering the entire sky and blocking the last bit of sunlight, plunging the forest into even deeper darkness. A fierce cry of a bird came from high above, piercing through gold and cracking stone, originating from that black cloud. Upon closer inspection, it was an enormous giant bird, so vast it blotted out the sun, its length unknown, its feathers incredibly black, reflecting a metallic sheen in the dim light.

In the boundless forest, a hundred-zhang-long, dozens-of-zhang-thick, silver-glowing giant snake coiled through the mountains. It looked as if cast from pure silver, each scale gleaming and ferocious, clanging against the rocks as it moved, sending sparks flying.

The scene shifted again, and the earth began to tremble. A blurry figure walked from afar, almost as tall as the divine mountains themselves! An inexplicable aura emanated from it, plunging the mountain range into a deathly silence. Ferocious birds and savage beasts alike lay prostrate, daring not to make a sound.

This was a humanoid creature, walking upright, incredibly colossal, its height rivaling mountains. Its entire body was covered in resplendent golden fur. Its face had five features, resembling an ape with a hairy face and a thunderous mouth. Its two eyes were like brilliant suns; when they opened and closed, a golden lightning bolt seemed to flash, sharp and terrifying. In its right hand, it clutched a spiked club as thick as its thigh, covered in cracks. Its entire being exuded a sea of blood qi, like a divine demon!

Zhou Tian, who was furiously gnawing on a pork hock, nodded. "Now *that's* a blockbuster! A real scene, utterly realistic!" Honey dribbled from the corner of his mouth. In the entire great hall, only he was enthusiastically devouring his pork hock.

This secret realm was fraught with peril, full of hidden dangers. Zhou Zui and the others would have to spend three months inside to determine the ultimate victor! Of course, they wouldn't be watching in the hall for three months. The secret realm was enchanted with a time acceleration formation. Three months inside would actually only equate to an afternoon in the outside world. This meant that the final outcome would be decided by this very afternoon.

The scene flashed, and a person appeared on the screen. It was unclear if they were male or female, as they were completely encased in a mecha. The mecha was about two meters tall, mostly dark black, its body gleaming with an obsidian-like luster. On the forehead of its faceplate was a blood-red crystal, like a blood diamond, interwoven with silver patterns. At its abdomen was a fist-sized golden vortex, where specks of light swirled. Golden patterns extended from this point across its entire body, serving as energy channels, just like a human body's blood vessels.

Though its expression was obscured by the faceplate, Zhou Tian guessed that the expression beneath it must be grim. Due to random teleportation, this person was directly transported right in front of the Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast.

“Roar!”

The ferocious beast let out a thunderous roar, its sound waves rolling forth, snapping the nearby ancient trees. It lifted the massive spiked club in its right hand and swung it directly at the black ant-like figure before it.

“Whoosh!”

A sharp sound of tearing through the air rang out. Although this golden-furred beast appeared incredibly colossal, its speed was not slow in the slightest. The spiked club tore through space as it descended.

The black mecha drew a short hilt from its waist. Clasping it with both hands, with a *swish*, a three-meter-long purple energy blade shot out, instantly forming an Energy Blade Battleship Slayer.

Zhou Tian nearly spat out the hock in his mouth. "Did Star Wars sponsor this blockbuster too?"

*Clang!*

The massive spiked club slammed onto the Energy Blade Battleship Slayer. The mecha was forced down dozens of zhang in mid-air before it finally managed to stop.

*Click-click-click* sounds emanated.

The golden vortex in the mecha’s abdomen began to spin. Gaps opened on its back and feet, and violent golden flames jetted out, providing the mecha with additional power. Beneath the colossal spiked club, the mecha’s figure was incredibly tiny, yet it erupted with unimaginable strength, slowly pushing the spiked club upwards.

“Roar!”

The Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast roared again, its muscles bulging ferociously, its golden fur standing on end, its blood qi surging, tearing through the clouds. The spiked club pressed down once more.

Gaps opened at the mecha’s elbows, ejecting golden flames. The Energy Blade Battleship Slayer began to vibrate with small but extremely violent tremors.

*Crack!*

The mecha surged into the spiked club, shattering it into two halves. The mecha shot into the sky, gripping the Energy Blade Battleship Slayer, and streaked like a beam of light directly towards the golden-furred beast’s head.

The Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast reacted extremely fast, retracting its palm to block its head.

*Snap!*

The golden-furred beast’s little finger was completely severed, falling into the primeval forest. Golden blood spewed from the wound.

The Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast let out a painful roar, its eyes glinting fiercely. With a flick of its palm, the mecha was smacked backwards.

*Rumble!*

The mecha pierced through several mountain peaks, was slammed deep into the ground, then shot up into the sky again, narrowly dodging the beast’s foot.

*Click-click-click*, missile racks rose from the mecha’s shoulders. *Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh*, dozens of missiles were launched, leaving faint blue trails.

*Boom, boom, boom!*

The missiles struck the Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast, exploding all over its body. The beast was forced back several steps. As the dust settled, the areas struck by the missiles were charred black, and its golden fur had vanished.

“Roar, roar!”

Its savage nature roused, the Golden-Furred Abyssal Beast roared at the sky, its entire body glowing golden. Runes shot out from all over its body, and intricate symbols, as if crimson flames, ignited deep within its eyes. All the runes on its body converged, and two golden beams of light shot forth from the depths of its pupils!
