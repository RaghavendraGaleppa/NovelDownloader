# Chapter 38: Ancient Sword Immortal Wan Jiayi  

The reward for solving the Chuyun Town case would eventually be transferred through Yangliu Town—this was standard procedure.  

Even though Xiao Ji firmly expressed his love for silver, he couldn't persuade the officials to expedite the payment. In the end, he had no choice but to relent and accept that it would come later.  

Xiao Ji had been poor for too long, so even though his life was now comfortable, he still cherished every bit of wealth.  

Thanks to his awakened abilities, he no longer had to worry about daily necessities. If he ever ran short on money, he could always exchange a piece of spirit stone for silver—though no cultivator in their right mind would do such a thing.  

Spirit stones were scarce resources, especially for sects living among mortals, who treated them as priceless treasures. They served as currency among cultivators and were essential for cultivation. The wealthy could even absorb their energy directly.  

The next day, after enjoying another free breakfast courtesy of the Chuyun Town authorities, Song Yuanbao and Xiao Ji returned to Yangliu Town.  

It was noon when they arrived.  

Xiao Ji first went back to the temple to check on his master and ensure the Third Princess hadn’t run off before attending to other matters.  

Several peaceful days passed.  

On a gloomy afternoon, Xiao Ji visited the market to buy meat for hot pot.  

Since winter had arrived, the Yuanshen Temple hadn’t enjoyed a proper hot pot meal yet.  

After purchasing two pounds of lamb, one pound of pork, and some vegetables, he headed back, greeting acquaintances along the way.  

As he passed by the Yiwangxiang Teahouse, he noticed that the storyteller, Master Wan, had returned. The seats were packed with listeners, and even more people stood outside, eavesdropping for free.  

Xiao Ji had been waiting for Master Wan’s return, eager to hear more about the legends of the Nine Ancient Treasures—and to probe the storyteller’s true background.  

To most, Master Wan’s tales were just entertainment to liven up dull lives. But Xiao Ji was different. The last time he had heard stories about the Four-Stringed Pipa and the ancient ginkgo tree of Hegu Kingdom, he had suspected they were true.  

After obtaining the first string of the Four-Stringed Pipa, he became certain—Master Wan’s stories weren’t fabricated fables but real historical events.  

This man was worth keeping an eye on.  

Holding his purchases, Xiao Ji stood outside the teahouse, unable to squeeze inside, so he simply listened from where he was.  

He extended his perception, focusing entirely on the storyteller.  

"Master Wan, we’ve finally got you back! Your stories are the best—those tales of wandering heroes and love-struck cultivators from others are so dull."  

"Yeah, where have you been lately? We thought you weren’t coming back."  

"Some said you ran off with Widow Niu!"  

"Nonsense! Widow Niu’s been hiding at home—she hasn’t gone anywhere!"  

The audience was rowdy, their banter far from refined.  

Master Wan took a large sip from his tea bowl before continuing.  

"Last time, I told you about the ancient ginkgo tree in Hegu Kingdom. That tree has a peculiar trait—when its golden leaves begin to fall, it signals an impending calamity. I went to see it myself and found that a second leaf has already dropped."  

"If the great calamity is coming, Master Wan, hurry up and tell us more stories before it’s too late!" someone joked.  

Laughter followed.  

For ordinary folk, talk of world-ending disasters was distant and abstract. These fantastical tales were mostly of interest to cultivators—commoners just enjoyed the novelty.  

"Earlier, I mentioned the wonders of the Four-Stringed Pipa—how plucking its strings could summon wind, frost, rain, or snow, how the five elements danced to its melody," Master Wan said, handing his tea bowl to a young girl beside him.  

"The Four-Stringed Pipa is a treasure coveted not just by cultivators but also by demons and malevolent spirits. Possessing it could smooth one’s path to enlightenment and unlock unique abilities..."  

"The last time the complete Four-Stringed Pipa was seen was right here in Longxiang Prefecture."  

The crowd buzzed with excitement. The idea that such a legendary artifact had appeared so close to home was thrilling. Who knew? Maybe it was buried in their own backyard, waiting to be discovered—a life-changing fortune that could buy ten oxen!  

"Back then, the Great Perfection-stage expert, Thousand-Hand Dragon King, seized the Four-Stringed Pipa from a ten-thousand-year-old turtle demon in an underwater palace. The enraged turtle demon pursued him relentlessly, spreading word of the treasure..."  

"Cultivators from all over flocked to the chase, sparking widespread conflict. Many powerful figures joined forces to hunt down the Dragon King."  

"Exhausted and outnumbered, the Dragon King fled to a wild mountain outside Yangliu Town. With his spiritual energy depleted, he had no choice but to hurl the pipa into the air to save himself."  

"Chaos erupted as countless experts fought for it. Even Nascent Soul cultivators perished in the first wave of clashes."  

"In the end, the Four-Stringed Pipa shattered. Many fled with mere fragments, satisfied with even a sliver of its power. The once-mighty treasure was scattered, lost to time."  

"Now, with the great calamity approaching and the Heavenly Secrets flawed, those skilled in divination have resumed their search for the fragments..."  

"If any of you happen to find a piece of the Four-Stringed Pipa, keep it hidden—or hand it over to the authorities. Otherwise, disaster may follow."  

Though Master Wan spoke lightly, the crowd listened intently, their minds racing. Suddenly, everyone around them seemed like a potential rival in the hunt for the Nine Treasures.  

Xiao Ji’s expression darkened.  

Because he had just discovered that the storyteller, Master Wan, had a history no less extraordinary than the Nine Ancient Treasures themselves.  

**[Wan Jiayi, a fallen supreme sword immortal from ancient times. Raised on the kindness of strangers, he comprehended the Dao of the Sword through self-enlightenment. After a century of seclusion, he ascended with a single strike.]**  

**[Once, he gathered all Nine Treasures alone and, with the help of a master blacksmith, reforged them into one to seal the abyss and suppress the impending cataclysm. But under the machinations of a descended avatar of the Dao Ancestor, the world was left in ruins. Unable to prevent the shattering of the Nine Treasures, he was left broken in spirit.]**  

**[His cultivation was destroyed at the abyss by the Dao Ancestor’s avatar. Though saved by an old friend, he was left with an immortal body devoid of power.]**  

**[For years, he has wandered Longxiang Prefecture as a storyteller, waiting for the day his old friend—who fell to the Nascent Soul stage to save him—would emerge from seclusion.]**  

The information about this powerless sword immortal contained no clues about his friend’s whereabouts. He only knew they had agreed to meet here, so here he waited.  

As for when that day would come, he didn’t care—because it would, eventually.  

Xiao Ji stared at the middle-aged storyteller on stage. Without his unique ability, he would never have guessed that this man was once an ancient sword immortal who had single-handedly held back the abyss for the sake of the world.  

"So everything Master Wan tells is true, not fiction," Xiao Ji mused. "I’ve never seen the abyss, but just hearing about it sounds terrifying."  

In that case, the appearance of Four-Stringed Pipa fragments in Longxiang Prefecture made perfect sense.  

After all, the great battle for the treasure had taken place here. Over countless years, some fragments had been carried far away by natural forces, some remained buried deep underground, and others were hoarded as family heirlooms.  

With the Heavenly Secrets flawed, those skilled in divination wouldn’t miss this opportunity. Fragments of the Nine Treasures would inevitably resurface—first the pipa, then who knew what next.  

Xiao Ji found this ideal—because he wanted them all.
