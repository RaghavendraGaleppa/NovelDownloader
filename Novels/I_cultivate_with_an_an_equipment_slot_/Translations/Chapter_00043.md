# Chapter 43: Transplanting the Tea Tree  

The art of spiritual plant cultivation wasn't particularly outstanding among the myriad skills of immortal cultivation.  

In fact, one could become a spiritual farmer with just some casual study.  

But!  

That was only for becoming a spiritual farmer.  

To become a true spiritual cultivator, one needed talent. Some people spent half their lives pouring their hearts into it, barely qualifying as spiritual cultivators.  

Meanwhile, others could become exceptional spiritual cultivators in just a few years.  

Talent was something intangible, yet it undeniably influenced everyone.  

As a Golden Core elder, Zhuge Wan had seen her fair share of talented individuals—more than Zhang Yan had eaten grains of salt, one might say.  

Thus, she was rarely surprised by geniuses.  

Until…  

She met Zhang Yan.  

This disciple was simply too peculiar.  

He wasn’t just a genius. More importantly, his understanding of spiritual plant cultivation was eerily similar to hers—whether it was the techniques for cuttings, pruning, or even the precise amount of water to spray, his methods mirrored hers.  

No.  

It wasn’t just similar.  

It was identical.  

One could even say, without exaggeration, that he was her carbon copy.  

"To think you’d give me such a pleasant surprise." Zhuge Wan was delighted by this discovery. This was what true mentorship looked like—a disciple who mirrored her perfectly!  

Hearing her praise, Zhang Yan blinked.  

He could only say that this wasn’t an illusion but the truth. After all, he had already equipped Zhuge Wan’s magical artifacts.  

With the enhancement of their attributes, Zhang Yan was now constantly influenced by Zhuge Wan’s methods.  

Only by fully comprehending them could he internalize these techniques and make them his own.  

Until then, he would remain a mere reflection of Zhuge Wan.  

"Remember, no matter how excellent my methods are, they are still mine. You must develop your own understanding," Zhuge Wan earnestly advised Zhang Yan.  

"Yes, Master. But I believe your teachings are already exceptional." Seeing Zhuge Wan’s barely suppressed smile, Zhang Yan obediently agreed.  

Indeed, no teacher could resist a disciple who resembled them so closely!  

"Good. You’re still in the foundational stage. Resembling me will help solidify your basics."  

---  

After three hours of study with Zhuge Wan, Zhang Yan checked the time and immediately headed for Qingheng Peak.  

His destination this time was the sect leader’s cave abode.  

Upon arriving at Qingheng Peak, he presented his token, and soon a young attendant riding a crane came to guide him.  

"The sect leader has instructed that you may proceed directly to the spiritual garden for the transplant."  

"Then I’ll trouble you to lead the way, Junior Brother."  

Though the attendant served the sect leader, he wasn’t an official disciple, so Zhang Yan’s address was appropriate.  

Under the attendant’s guidance, Zhang Yan soon arrived at the sect leader’s spiritual garden.  

The moment he stepped inside, his eyes widened at the sight of the lush garden filled with precious spiritual plants.  

Spirit Turtle Fruit! Fire Spirit Blossoms! Golden Leaf Grass!  

Each of these plants could serve as the main ingredient for top-tier first-grade elixirs, making them incredibly valuable.  

Yet, in the sect leader’s garden, they were relegated to the outermost area.  

Further in were rare second-grade spiritual plants.  

And at the very center, Zhang Yan caught a glimpse of a faintly glowing purple bamboo.  

Purple Lightning Bamboo!  

A third-grade spiritual plant!  

"Truly, the sect leader’s collection is on a completely different level!"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes burned with envy.  

So rich! When would he ever amass such wealth?  

For a fleeting moment, he entertained the wild thought of knocking out the attendant and making off with everything.  

"Senior Brother, is something wrong?" The attendant suddenly felt a chill and turned to Zhang Yan.  

"Ah, nothing. I’m just… overwhelmed. Please lead me to the spiritual tea tree."  

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yan suppressed his reckless impulses.  

He knew the difference between a single feast and a lifetime of meals.  

"Right this way, Senior Brother."  

The attendant led Zhang Yan deeper into the garden until they stopped before a tea tree about the height of a person.  

"Senior Brother, this is the tea tree." The attendant’s eyes shone with admiration. "This tree is over three hundred years old and produces an ounce of tea leaves annually. Drinking it can slightly enhance one’s spiritual sense."  

"What a treasure!"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes lit up at the mention of spiritual sense enhancement.  

Spiritual sense—or spiritual awareness—was crucial for Foundation Establishment, which involved three key trials:  

The trial of mana.  

The trial of vitality.  

And the trial of spiritual sense.  

Among these, spiritual sense was the hardest to cultivate, making anything that enhanced it immensely valuable.  

And this tea tree could produce such a treasure continuously!  

No wonder the sect leader had looked so pained when offering it.  

But Zhang Yan couldn’t help but wonder—why had the sect leader been so generous?  

Such a precious tea tree, given away so readily?  

"Could it be… that I’m the sect leader’s secret love child?"  

A ridiculous thought flashed through his mind, but he quickly shook it off and focused on the tea tree.  

"Good thing I came prepared."  

Zhang Yan pulled out a gleaming shovel—a top-grade magical artifact gifted by Zhuge Wan.  

Not only could it easily dig through spiritual soil, but it also protected the plant’s roots from damage.  

An invaluable tool for spiritual cultivators.  

Carefully, he excavated the tea tree and swiftly transferred it, roots and soil intact, into a special pot-like container.  

"Junior Brother, I’ll take my leave to plant this. Please convey my gratitude to the sect leader."  

With that, Zhang Yan hurried off, tea tree in tow, straight to his hundred-acre plot of premium spiritual land.  

He chose the most spiritually dense spot and planted the tree.  

After a moment’s thought, he cast a Wood Element Spell on it.  

Under the influence of his perfected spell, the tea tree immediately took root and sprouted new growth, looking even more vibrant than before.  

Assured that the tree was thriving, Zhang Yan turned his attention to his living arrangements.  

He decided against relocating—instead, he would build a simple dwelling right beside his hundred acres.  

Though theft was rare within the sect, leaving such a valuable second-grade tea tree unattended still felt risky.  

"Besides, what should I plant across these hundred acres?"  

Growing spiritual rice here would be a waste of premium land. He needed something more valuable.  

"Ah! I could turn it into my own spiritual garden, dedicated to medicinal herbs."  

The idea struck him like lightning.  

As an inner disciple, he now had the status to settle down properly. Establishing his own spiritual garden wasn’t excessive—especially since he planned to grow herbs for alchemy.
