# Chapter 59: Finally Acquiring a Palm Technique and Its Unique Characteristics

The white-haired Pavilion Servant glanced at the two of them, then let out a couple of grunts, gesturing for them to follow.

He carried a lantern, but inside there was no candle flame—only a luminous pearl. The light was not as bright as a candle’s, but it guaranteed no risk of fire.

The Pavilion of Leisurely Martial Arts was filled with paper books. If a fire were to break out, even the Madam would likely be helpless.

Martial arts masters were accustomed to turning their momentary inspirations into martial arts manuals and preserving them.

The quality of these martial arts varied, but on some future day, reviewing them might bring new insights.

Thus, the martial arts within the Pavilion of Leisurely Martial Arts had been preserved excellently to this day. Being built in the center of a lake also served the purpose of fire prevention.

“Although this man’s hand tendons were severed, he still has the strength to hold things,” Li Xian observed secretly.

There were obvious scars on the Pavilion Servant’s wrists—the marks of severed tendons. However, the Madam had clearly shown restraint; the tendons were not completely severed, otherwise he would not have been able to hold up the lantern.

They seemed severed but were not, preventing him from practicing martial arts, yet allowing him to handle objects.

It was unlikely an act of kindness to let him live comfortably. Rather, she needed him to manage the affairs within the Pavilion. If his hands were too weak, he would not be able to perform the many tasks required.

Although there was some dust, the place was generally quite clean.

The interior was not spacious; it was a corridor wide enough for four people, winding around with bookshelves on both sides.

“Uh... uh...”

The Pavilion Servant pointed to the bookshelves on both sides, allowing Li Xian and Han Ying Hua to choose for themselves.

By the glow of the night pearl, Li Xian moved closer to one side of the bookshelf, his eyes scanning quickly.

“The higher the level of martial art, the harder it is to practice, but the greater the benefits and improvement in strength.”

“Martial arts are divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper grades. In reality, there are more than three grades, but higher-level martial arts are beyond our qualification to know.”

His gaze swept across the shelves, and memories of martial arts knowledge surfaced in his mind.

Entering the grade of martial arts... the effects were even more incredible.

Li Xian glanced over and became very interested in several martial arts manuals. One of them was a saber technique called “Sky Wind Saber,” which was a Lower Grade, Secondary Tier martial art.

This saber technique emphasized saber momentum like the wind. When wielding the saber, the surrounding air currents would swirl and yellow sand would sweep around. Although it was somewhat flashy and impractical, it indeed...

Suited Li Xian’s image of a lone man with a narrow saber, ideally paired with a pot of strong wine and a donkey—free and unrestrained, capable of entering the imperial palace or descending into the brothels.

A romanticized vision of the martial world.

Of course, it was just a fantasy.

Li Xian slowed his steps. Although he already had a target in mind, he still chose carefully.

Before long, he saw Han Ying Hua’s “Fire Eagle Claw.” Han Ying Hua’s current strength was partly due to the power of the “Fire Eagle Claw.”

This claw technique condenses Qi into fire, attaching it to the fingertips. It excels at capturing, seizing, and killing, with domineering finger force. It is an extremely formidable martial art.

He shifted his gaze...

Another martial art caught his eye: “Harmonious Qi Technique.”

It was a rare type of hard-flowing Qi technique. This kind of martial art has a fatal flaw—there is often a “vital point.”

If touched, one becomes disabled; if pressed, one dies.

However, if the vital point is well protected, it becomes much more powerful than martial arts of the same grade.

“Emerald Luo Palm!”

Before long, Li Xian finally saw the Emerald Luo Palm.

He thought to himself that although there were many martial arts here, he could ultimately only choose one. Looking at more would only increase his attachment and bring no benefit.

So he made his decision.

“Uh... head...”

The Pavilion Servant patted Li Xian, pointed at the book in his hand, and then pointed at his head.

“Are you saying I have to memorize it on the spot? I can’t take the book out?” Li Xian asked tentatively.

“Uh... yes...”

The Pavilion Servant nodded.

He brought Li Xian to a small room, which was quiet and peaceful. There was cold water and dry rations prepared on the side.

“Wow, the control is really strict,” Li Xian clicked his tongue.

He opened the book.

The three words “Emerald Luo Palm” came into view.

“I happened to have some free time, my mind wandered, and my thoughts fluctuated, so I created this technique.”

“The two words ‘Emerald Luo’ are taken from ‘Emerald Luo River.’”

In a few words, the origin of the martial art was made clear.

Turning the page, it revealed the essence of the martial art. The method of practice was all contained between the lines.

Mostly described in words, but occasionally supplemented with a few illustrations.

How the internal Qi circulates, how to execute the moves...

Li Xian did not rush to memorize. Instead, he read through it once from beginning to end, keeping it smooth and natural without forcing full understanding.

Then he began to memorize it section by section. Time flew by, and it was already evening. Through the window crack, he could see the sky had darkened.

Fish played in the lake. When tired of reciting, watching the small fish in the lake was a good way to pass the time.

The room was narrow and could not accommodate stretching his limbs; otherwise, Li Xian would have started practicing immediately.

After a rest, he drank some water and ate some dry rations, then continued to memorize stubbornly. It was impossible to fully understand and digest it immediately.

The only way was the clumsy method: rote memorization, chewing through it hard.

He could ponder the meaning after getting out.

Li Xian found that although the book was not thick, the principles were obscure and difficult to understand. Even if he memorized it perfectly on the spot, if he could not review it frequently after leaving, his memory would naturally become distorted.

For an ordinary guard, to practice a martial art to great completion or perfection would likely require entering and exiting the Pavilion of Leisurely Martial Arts several times.

“I believe in the reward of diligence, so I have more advantage than ordinary guards.”

Li Xian’s memory was actually not bad, though not as photographic as his younger brother Li Xiaofan’s.

But reading and memorizing were much faster than most people.

That night, he had essentially memorized it all, but he still repeatedly recited it to strengthen his memory. Even with the help of his Destiny, the effort he needed to put in was still necessary.

The next day.

Li Xian left the Pavilion first and waited until noon before Qiu Yue came to pick him up, leading him across the white jade bridge to the opposite shore.

“What martial art did you learn?” Qiu Yue asked.

“Emerald Luo Palm,” Li Xian replied truthfully.

There was no hiding this; hiding it was meaningless.

Unexpectedly, Qiu Yue was taken aback. “Emerald Luo Palm?” Her expression was somewhat strange.

“Is this palm technique very unusual?” Li Xian was puzzled. He felt Qiu Yue’s expression was odd.

“Whether it’s unusual or not has nothing to do with you,” Qiu Yue was unwilling to say more, her expression drifting as if remembering something.

Leaving the Pavilion of Leisurely Martial Arts, Li Xian pondered Qiu Yue’s expression.

“This Qiu Yue has a deep relationship with Jiang Yun. If Jiang Yun practiced Emerald Luo Palm, was it guided by Qiu Yue?”

“This martial art is not eye-catching among the many Lower Grade martial arts. If not for Zhao Han and others, I would not have chosen this palm technique.”

“Never mind, why think about this? If I have the time, I might as well practice martial arts seriously.”

Just as he was thinking, he suddenly saw Pang Long patrolling nearby.

Li Xian went over to greet him. Pang Long also took the opportunity to ask about his martial art selection. Upon learning that Li Xian had chosen Emerald Luo Palm, he shook his head and sighed softly:

“Actually, based on your situation, choosing a fist technique would be best.”

“If it were basic martial arts, I would support you developing comprehensively and exploring your strengths.”

“But this is an entering-grade martial art; the opportunity is rare. You already have a foundation in fist techniques. If you chose a fist technique, your practice speed would be faster.”

“It would also be more helpful for circulating Qi through the meridians in the future.”

Pang Long gave very earnest guidance.

“Commander Pang, is this Emerald Luo Palm very special?” Li Xian asked casually.

“Special?” Pang Long was surprised. “Isn’t it just an ordinary entering-grade martial art? What’s so special about it?”

His reaction was completely different from Qiu Yue’s; he clearly did not know the secret within.

Li Xian naturally stopped investigating.

After bidding farewell to Pang Long, he arrived at his usual training spot.

Now that Li Xian’s [Square Fist] was perfected, [Breeze Leg] was small success, and he was about to add a new martial art, [Emerald Luo Palm].

Fist, leg, palm—

It could be considered balanced development.
