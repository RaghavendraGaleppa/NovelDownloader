# Chapter 105: The Lifelong Pursuit

In the following days, Lin Shan concealed his tracks and traveled covertly to prevent Princess Guo from discovering his whereabouts.

Princess Guo herself wasn't a major concern, but her fiancé from the Qianyun Pavilion made Lin Shan tread carefully.

Upon entering the Yan Yun Mountain Range, Lin Shan had learned his lesson this time. 

He avoided the standard route to Yi Chuan entirely—especially that accursed stream! Every time he passed there, he'd been ambushed. He was beginning to think the place was cursed against him.

Instead, he took a long detour westward before looping back northeast, retracing the same path he'd taken when fleeing with Immortal Huang. He circled to the northern part of the Yan Yun Mountain Range and took another passage from Great Yan into Yi Chuan.

Fortunately, this time he encountered no ambushes and safely reached the mist formation surrounding Yi Chuan.

He wasn't sure whether his excessive caution had genuinely helped him avoid Princess Guo's deadly trap or if he'd simply been fighting shadows all along. 

But regardless, making it back to Yi Chuan safely was all that mattered.

Just as Lin Shan breathed a sigh of relief and excitedly prepared to open the formation to enter Yi Chuan, he noticed another group approaching nearby.

A charming and alluring young woman led a group of lively female cultivators. They seemed to have just returned from outside, travel-worn and in a hurry to enter Yi Chuan as well.

Lin Shan even recognized two of them.

The proprietress of the Yan Chun Lou brothel! And Luan Chun!

Weren't they supposed to be brothel workers? What were they doing outside Yi Chuan instead of staying put to conduct their business?

At first puzzled, Lin Shan suddenly recalled that the Yan Chun Lou proprietress—the deceased Immortal Huang's lover—was actually a Golden Core stage expert from the demonic path.

Could it be that during the recent surprise attack on the East Sea by the three major demonic sects, they had...

Lin Shan's mouth went dry as a startling realization struck him. Did this mean the entire brothel was a den of demonic enchantresses?

The thought made him shudder. His past visits to the brothel now seemed like a lamb wandering into a wolf's den.

That damned Immortal Huang!

However, the group of women from Yan Chun Lou paid Lin Shan no mind as they filed past him into the mist formation, ignoring him completely.

"Well, Yi Chuan Market has multiple Golden Core experts overseeing it. They wouldn't dare cause trouble right at the entrance," Lin Shan reassured himself.

After watching them disappear into Yi Chuan, he suppressed his unease. Yet another worry surfaced—what if these demonic enchantresses caused chaos while lurking in Yi Chuan?

It seemed nowhere was truly safe. Just when he thought he'd found a stable place to settle down, he discovered a ticking time bomb right beside him.

---

Who could remain calm in such circumstances?

Steeling himself, Lin Shan deliberately waited a while longer, estimating that the demonic enchantresses had moved on, before finally entering the mist formation himself.

Back in Yi Chuan, breathing in the familiar concentration of spiritual energy, Lin Shan felt like he'd returned to paradise.

Along the way, he passed vast spirit herb fields where farmers worked the land, casting wind and rain spells. The peaceful, harmonious scene was a welcome sight.

When he reached the sea of flowers near the central peak, he deliberately glanced at the small pavilion where young masters like Gongsun Yu had once gathered to drink and converse. Finding it empty now filled him with melancholy—it felt like a lifetime ago.

Turning right at the fork ahead, he finally arrived at Yi Chuan Market's city gates. After presenting his token for inspection by the guards, Lin Shan stepped inside, enveloped by a long-missed sense of security.

But before he could savor the moment, his eyes fell on a beautiful young woman leaning against the inner gate, smiling softly at him.

None other than the Yan Chun Lou proprietress.

She had clearly been waiting for him inside the city.

Lin Shan paused mid-step, then reasoned that if she meant him harm, she would have struck outside the market. Since she'd waited for him here, she probably had no intention of attacking. Somewhat reassured, he approached and cupped his hands in greeting.

"Senior—"

"Two years!"

The woman cut him off abruptly, holding up two slender fingers.

"I'm giving you two years."

"After that, I'll be leaving Yi Chuan. You'll give me your answer then."

"If you refuse the opportunity to join the Black Lotus Sect, our agreement becomes void, and we'll owe each other nothing!"

With that, the woman turned gracefully and disappeared down the street without another word, leaving Lin Shan standing dumbfounded at the city gates, his thoughts in turmoil.

---

The streets bustled with cultivators coming and going. The northern district happened to be the commercial area, and Lin Shan remained motionless at the north gate for a long time, pondering a simple yet daunting question.

Two years from now, the Black Lotus Sect.

Should he go or not?

If he went, could he survive the ruthless environment of a major demonic sect?

During the breakout at East Sea's Turtle Fishing Island, when he'd fought alongside Thunder Rain Child and Lin Fan, he'd witnessed firsthand how Qi Condensation stage demonic disciples were mere cannon fodder.

They had cut down countless demonic disciples like weeds, with no elders stepping in to protect them. Clearly, such expendable disciples held no value in demonic sects—their lives meant nothing.

Now that the demonic path had seized the East Sea, their next step after consolidating their foothold would be to invade the inland regions of Great Song. If he joined them, he'd inevitably become one of those cannon fodder soldiers sent to battle!

The thought of being swept into a war against the righteous path, only to be obliterated by a stray area-of-effect attack from someone like Thunder Rain Child, dying as meaninglessly as countless other demonic cultivators, made Lin Shan feel his death would be utterly pointless.

Yet joining the Black Lotus Sect had its advantages—chief among them being the Black Lotus Buddha Statue.

If he could access the statue and continuously harvest ancient essence, he could use the enhancement panel to rapidly strengthen himself and accelerate his growth.

If he stayed in Yi Chuan, scraping by as a cautious rogue cultivator, he might eventually rise to prominence through slow, steady effort. But that path would waste precious time he couldn't afford to lose.

On the path of immortality, falling behind at one step meant lagging at every subsequent step.

A cultivator's greatest enemy isn't others, nor even oneself—it's time itself.

When one's lifespan runs out, no amount of talent or ability can defy the natural order of life and death.

---

Lin Shan stood lost in thought until a sudden breeze brushed his face, jolting him with a realization.

What was his greatest advantage?

Being a transmigrator? His mediocre-grade Wind Spirit Root? His equally ordinary Thunder Spirit Root? His self-proclaimed sharp wit? Or his stable job earning a hundred spirit stones a month?

All of that was meaningless!

His true advantage was the enhancement panel.

In the world of cultivation, all practitioners tirelessly pursued opportunities, risking their lives for resources. Countless talented individuals perished every day.

Yet he possessed the enhancement panel—an unimaginable, heaven-defying treasure. He needed to utilize it fully, not cower in fear waiting for miracles.

Across the myriad realms and vast lands, how could one achieve immortality without striving?

His life's purpose was to walk the path of pursuing ancient essence.

That was the true road to ascension!

As the saying goes, fortune favors the bold. Back in the Ancient Tomb of Yelang, when he'd cast aside all fear of death, that had been the mindset of a true warrior.

The path of immortality is fraught with hardship—what opportunity comes without risk? Following the conventional path would only lead to mediocrity.

Lin Shan raised his head, gazing at the radiant sun shining upon all living things. Suddenly, it was as if a light had pierced through his doubts, scattering the clouds and revealing a rainbow after the storm.

"In two years, I must do whatever it takes to reach Foundation Establishment."

"The Black Lotus Sect—I'm going!"
