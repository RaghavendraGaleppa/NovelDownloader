# Chapter 111: How Foolish I Have Been, the Dragon and Tiger Alchemical Pill!

4,224 years old.

The little bean in front of him was older than the entire history of the Great Yu Dynasty.

Moreover... a pill?

A Seven-Aperture Dragon and Tiger Pill that could turn into a human?

Upon thinking about it, since all things possess a spirit, and there was even a talking hammer lying inside the World Seed, it didn't seem so difficult to understand that a pill could turn into a human.

However, he possessed many pills that were priceless and hard to obtain, yet none were as miraculous as this.

"The sect says I was born with deficiencies; that isn't entirely wrong," Tang Xiaobao rubbed his small chin.

"Master also said I have some deficiencies."

"What kind?"

"A lack of sense."

"......"

Li Mo felt that what Xue Lao said probably wasn't referring to a physical condition.

Since both of them had retrieved the books and were heading to the Cauldron Peak, they decided to walk together.

"By the way, Junior Brother Li, have you reached the Jade Liquid Realm now?" Tang Xiaobao asked halfway through the journey.

"Yes," Li Mo nodded.

"Junior Brother, you are truly a freak," Tang Xiaobao said with genuine sincerity.

"...... Thank you for the compliment." Li Mo took it as praise.

Tang Xiaobao sighed with some distress. "If this keeps up, the next time I see you and Sister Ying Bing, I'll have to call you Senior Brother and Senior Sister."

In the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, strength is supreme. In most sects, seniority is determined by strength, and the Clear Abyss Sect is no exception. That was why he used to be the Eldest Senior Brother of Cauldron Peak, but now he is the Junior Brother.

"Rest assured, Senior Brother Xiaobao, you will always be my Senior Brother," Li Mo promised solemnly, remembering the other's astonishing age.

"No wonder everyone in the sect says Junior Brother Li has the style of an ancient gentleman. You really are a good person," Tang Xiaobao said happily, then clenched his fist. "I will work hard too, and try to enter the Profound Pill Realm before you guys do."

"By the way, Junior Brother Li, are you coming to watch me train later? Master will be there too."

"Sure."

He was originally going to find Xue Lao anyway, and he was a bit curious about Tang Xiaobao's training, so Li Mo agreed without thinking too much.

Soon, the two arrived at Cauldron Peak.

Among the many peaks, this one had the most lush vegetation, and a strange fragrance could be smelled everywhere. Li Mo took a few extra breaths; it actually smelled quite good.

Reaching the peak, this was where the true disciples and the Peak Master, Elder Xue Jing, lived. The furnishings were extremely simple: a small courtyard with a massive Dragon and Tiger Pill Furnace in the middle, just like the one Li Mo had seen in the medical clinic before.

At this moment, under the pill furnace, fierce flames were jumping, and the temperature was extremely high.

Xue Jing and two other true disciples were in the middle of refining pills. The three of them were staring intently at the furnace, each performing their duties. The male true disciple was responsible for adding new materials, while the female true disciple was responsible for cleaning out the residue. Xue Jing focused entirely on controlling the flames to extract and purify the medicinal herbs.

Now was not the time to interrupt, so Li Mo and Tang Xiaobao quietly watched from the side.

"Add the Yellow Origin Fruit," Xue Jing said. The male disciple hurriedly took out a thumb-sized, translucent fruit.

Aside from the Black Evil Wood Oil used to increase the heat, Li Mo didn't recognize any of the other materials. Fortunately, Tang Xiaobao was there to explain.

"The Yellow Origin Fruit has a mild medicinal property. After merging with other main ingredients, it can make their medicinal effects more active."

"The next step, Master should add the Dust-Parting Flower."

"What is the Dust-Parting Flower?"

Li Mo didn't have the ambition to become a Pill Master; he was just curious about the refining process. He had read about it in novels many times, but seeing it with his own eyes was a first.

"The Dust-Parting Flower is naturally used to separate medicinal powers."

"I see."

Li Mo watched as Xue Jing took out a jade shovel and stirred the materials inside the furnace. He felt a strange sense of déjà vu, but he couldn't quite put his finger on why it felt strange.

At this moment, Xue Jing said solemnly, "Bring the Treasure Pill True Liquid."

The male disciple's expression turned serious as he carefully took out a basin containing a pool of淡 golden liquid. It was evident that this was a very precious material, brimming with rich vitality.

"Treasure Pill True Liquid?" Just hearing the name made Li Mo feel it was very powerful.

"Yeah, it's my bathwater," Tang Xiaobao whispered.

Li Mo: "....."

There was really no need to explain everything in such detail.

"High heat to reduce the liquid!"

After pouring the so-called Treasure Pill True Liquid into the furnace, Xue Jing added more Black Evil Wood Oil. Li Mo finally realized where that sense of déjà vu was coming from.

---

"Isn't this just stir-frying?"

"I thought the alchemy process was supposed to be grand and noble?"

Li Mo covered his face with his hand.

"The two aren't that different," Tang Xiaobao blinked.

Li Mo: "..... That doesn't seem entirely wrong."

Cooking emphasizes ingredients; alchemy emphasizes pill materials. The order of addition is important for both, and both require precise control of the heat. The only difference is that alchemy is more dangerous. If a dish isn't cooked well, it burns; if a pill fails due to conflicting medicinal powers, the furnace might explode.

At this moment, the thrilling alchemy segment ended.

"This furnace of Green Snake Blood Spirit Pills is considered a success," Xue Jing let out a sigh of relief.

He had known Li Mo was here for a while, so he turned around and smiled. "This pill is good for body refining, but unfortunately, it was a custom order for Floating屠 with a high price, so I can't spare any for you."

"Thank you for your concern, Elder Xue."

The atmosphere between the old and young man was quite harmonious. The old Xue had always had a good impression of this grand-disciple.

"You... I really don't know what to say," Xue Jing looked at Li Mo, who was now vastly different from before, and laughed dumbfounded. "How did you manage to sneak into the Infinite Trial and take first place?"

"It was a coincidence," Li Mo modestly cupped his hands. "My internal energy is somewhat special; it just happened to be able to erase the scent on the Hall Before the Swallows."

"Have some tea," Xue Jing gestured for him to sit.

Li Mo naturally sat on the nearby red sandalwood chair and casually brewed two cups of tea. He had learned this from the Ice Cube.

"You did well," Xue Jing picked up his tea cup and took a sip. "Keep your Hall Before the Swallows. If the Drizzle Tower makes any moves in the Purple Sun Mansion in the future, we can grasp the situation immediately."

"However, their Hall Before the Swallows have a unique crafting method. Your internal energy was actually able to erase the scent on them?"

If the Hall Before the Swallows were so easy to crack, the Drizzle Tower wouldn't be so feared throughout the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, let alone be capable of assassinating kings and emperors.

"You'll know once you see it," Li Mo flicked his finger, and a wisp of deep red internal energy shot out, landing on the pill residue from earlier.

*Crackle—*

A bean-sized flame burned quietly, as if eternal. The pill residue, which hadn't been refined even by the high temperatures of the furnace, slowly vanished, burned away completely.

Xue Jing narrowed his eyes, a strong light appearing in his pupils. After a long while, he let out a long sigh.

"How foolish I have been..."

"I should have taken you into my sect no matter what back then."

If this flame were used for alchemy, his future achievements would be limitless.

"Why do you say that, Elder Xue?" Li Mo苦笑 (wry smile). He had heard old men say this many times already.

"Even I can only purify materials to ninety-nine percent at best."

"If you practiced, you could possibly achieve one hundred percent."

"You are simply born for alchemy," Xue Jing said with deep emotion.

If Elder Han He were here, he would definitely say Li Mo was born for forging. After all, forging also emphasizes heat control. And little Li Mo had a hammer that could forge玄 weapons...

"Master, Master, you've finished refining the pill, now it's time to refine me," Tang Xiaobao climbed into the furnace, his voice echoing inside.

Li Mo was a bit silent.

Since alchemy is like stir-frying, then this is no different from stewing oneself in a pot... *cough*, a random association.

"Huh?" Xue Jing was stunned for a moment, looking at Li Mo.

"On the way here, Senior Brother Xiaobao told me everything," Li Mo said.

Xue Jing nodded and didn't say much more. He intentionally let Li Mo observe the alchemy, so he sent away the other two true disciples but kept him behind.

*Whoosh—*

He pointed a finger at Tang Xiaobao's forehead from a distance.

Immediately, a pill fragrance that made one's soul feel a stirring sensation overflowed.

Li Mo looked thoughtful. It seemed that Elder Xue had used a special method to seal the scent and pill power on Senior Brother Xiaobao's body, making him no different from an ordinary child.

随后, Xue Jing became solemn. His hair and beard stood on end, making him look even more otherworldly. An invisible domain spread out. The dragon and tiger coiled on the pill furnace seemed to come alive. The tiger's mouth and dragon's jaws opened one after another, spewing out fierce flames.
