**Chapter 143**

Within the majestic great hall at the heart of Tianqin's main base city, an ancient aura permeated the air, as if the hall itself were forged from ancient bronze. Dozens of figures stood within, Zhou Tian among them.

"What exactly is going on?" asked a young man with a youthful face, a disciple of a venerable elder from Futian State, closely connected to Tianqin.

"Are the numerous ancient gods from the God-Abandoned Land descending to besiege us?" speculated another, a large bump protruding from his forehead. Through the skin, a golden light seemed to be brewing within, indicative of a unique physique. While its full potential promised formidable battle power, it was currently still in its formative stage.

"Just a bunch of defeated dogs, daring to jump out and bark wildly!" scoffed a red-haired man. Not only his hair but also his eyebrows and eyes were crimson, and an uncontrolled, blood-red mist emanated from his body, carrying an astonishing killing intent. Those nearby instinctively kept their distance.

Zhou Xunchuan's brows furrowed slightly. He stood with Zhou Tian and a few others. As a core member of Tianqin, he was privy to more internal information than most. "Are they launching a full-scale assault? Several of the strongest deity leaders have already descended."

"It shouldn't be the gods' true bodies descending. Rather, those gods are merely descending by possessing vessels," Zhou Tian stated. He had lingered near Myriad Gods Mountain for a long time, gathering much information. During that period, the major divine cults had been searching for suitable divine hosts. Now, it appeared the descending gods were indeed using hosts, not their true forms. After all, they feared Kyushu might 'catch them like a turtle in a jar' (trap them easily), and they wouldn't risk their true bodies unless absolutely certain.

"Then what's the use? What major events can a group of divine hosts stir up?" Zhou Zui inquired. If the gods were merely using host bodies, their strength would surely be greatly diminished, so what purpose would it serve?

"Do not underestimate them!" Sun Tuo said grimly. "The path of the God Realm is vastly different from ours, and the power of faith is especially unique. According to information passed down from ancient times, those divine host bodies possess terrifying strength and various divine powers. They absolutely cannot be taken lightly!"

"When soldiers come, block them; when water comes, cover it!" Gu Zhen's eyes were resolute, the long saber on his back vibrating incessantly. He himself seemed like an unsheathed saber, accumulating enough power, just waiting for the moment of its release to be earth-shattering!

"Sigh, Zhou Tian, do you know anything else? Spill it," Zhou Zui nudged Zhou Tian, asking.

"That's all I know. What I just told you, I risked my life to gather. Don't ask me; ask our Third Prince here. You have such an important figure right in front of you, yet you come to ask me." Zhou Tian made it clear he had no more information.

"Third Prince, do you know any inside information? Care to share?" Zhou Zui immediately approached Zhou Xunchuan with a fawning smile. Zhou Xunchuan was personally appointed by Emperor Qin; he surely knew something. Otherwise, given the current situation, this place was clearly an isolated island, extremely dangerous.

"What inside information do I have? Father Emperor went to the Star Realm to deal with that newly discovered world right after we left," Zhou Xunchuan said, initially tight-lipped. However, seeing everyone's disappointed expressions, he thought for a moment and then spoke, "However, according to my second brother, Kyushu's high command seems to be planning something big. If successful, it could 'remove many deep-seated worries.' This is what my second brother said, not me." Zhou Xunchuan put on a look of not being concerned, as if the words had not just come from him.

"Understood, understood," Zhou Zui replied with an ambiguous smile.

No one seemed overly surprised. After all, how could a force as immense as Kyushu not have its own means? It was just that Kyushu's scheme seemed far grander than they had imagined, as the phrase "remove many deep-seated worries" was not simple.

"By the way, what did my second brother and the others go to do? Why haven't I seen them?" Zhou Tian asked. When Zhou Xunchuan mentioned the Second Prince earlier, Zhou Tian also suddenly realized that he hadn't seen Zhou Ying since returning here.

"Don't even mention you; none of us have seen them. They disappeared the moment we arrived here. They're probably on some secret mission," Zhou Zui waved his hand and replied.

Zhou Tian nodded, many conjectures forming in his mind.

Before the few could say more, a flash of light appeared, and a figure materialized above the main hall. It was Zhou Tian's grandfather, Zhou Changsheng. Everyone immediately stopped talking and turned their gaze to him, a gesture of respect.

Zhou Changsheng surveyed the hall, his gaze lingering briefly on Zhou Tian. He had been paying attention to the recent battle and was somewhat puzzled by the power his grandson had displayed, but now was not the time to ask. Instead, he spoke, "Gentlemen, war is upon us. As you can see, those remnants of the ancient God Realm are eyeing us like tigers."

Zhou Changsheng went straight to the point: "I can tell you clearly, currently, we are an isolated island here, with no contact with the outside world, and no reinforcements."

"No contact with the outside world?"

"How can this be?"

"Have we been abandoned?"

The hall erupted in chatter, most people displaying expressions of disbelief. They had not realized that this place had lost contact with the outside world. Although they had been ambushed in the Void Storm, they had believed it was merely an accident and hadn't thought much more of it. In their minds, Kyushu was omnipotent; how could it fall into such a predicament?

Only Zhou Tian and a few true prodigies from Futian State, such as Zhe Xian and Nan Qing, showed no signs of panic.

"Quiet!" Zhou Changsheng's brows furrowed slightly as he roared. An inexplicable ripple echoed through the hall, and everyone felt their emotions calm down. It was then they remembered there was a Heavenly King-level existence before them, and their faces turned pale, fearing Zhou Changsheng's displeasure.

Zhou Changsheng did not delve further, continuing, "Do not be pessimistic. This is merely the current situation. Those ancient gods are only descending through host bodies; we still have room to maneuver, and the people outside will not abandon us."

"The Pantheon of Myriad Gods Mountain has opened. We have reason to believe their objective in descending this time is the Pantheon. I've discussed it with the other Heavenly Kings, and we don't want to passively defend. We will launch a proactive attack. Therefore, we will fight our way to the Pantheon!" Zhou Changsheng said in a deep voice, hands clasped behind his back.

What a bunch of "iron-headed babies," Zhou Tian thought, clicking his tongue in wonder. Although Zhou Changsheng had told him that day about seizing divine positions within the Pantheon, that was under the premise that the ancient gods had not yet descended. He never expected that now, with the gods already descending, these reckless individuals still intended to go out. While the strength of the gods inhabiting host bodies was still unknown, Zhou Tian believed it shouldn't be too low. If they were just seven Great Emperors, that would be a joke—not even enough for Zhou Changsheng to crush with one hand.
