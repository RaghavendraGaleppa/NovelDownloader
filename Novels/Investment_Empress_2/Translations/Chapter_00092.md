# Chapter 92: Who Laughs Like That? (1/2)

The small posthouse was suddenly filled with flashing blades, instantly turning into a battlefield of carnage.

Zuoqiu Yang’s short knife at his waist was bewitching and dazzling. With a single flash, a life was extinguished.

The whistling sound of the blade gave people a feeling of ants gnawing at their hearts.

"So strong."

Xiao Qin’s heart tightened slightly. The other party’s killing intent was terrifying. If they were fighting to the death, he wasn’t confident he could win.

His teacher once said that among his peers, he was an outstanding genius.

But Old Xiao always felt he was ordinary.

He used to think it was because within the Qingyuan Sect, there were too many talented people. Now that he had left the mountain, he had encountered such a person again.

"So it is the Unborn Blade Art. At his age, he has actually perfected it."

The Thousand Form Martial Venerable let out a soft exclamation, also surprised by Zuoqiu Yang.

"You recognize his martial arts style?"

"Of course. If I didn't, why would I warn you?"

"Teacher, something is off about this posthouse. Why didn't you warn me?"

Xiao Qin hid in a corner.

Projectiles were flying everywhere, and he was forced to pick up a broken sword to swing around.

"These aren't even qualified assassins."

"And they aren't here to kill you anyway."

Xiao Qin nodded. He hadn't received the "Hall Front Swallow" signal, and there were no innocents involved here.

But unfortunately...

Suddenly, a projectile he had deflected shot through the chest of some unlucky fellow.

"This guy with the thick eyebrows and big eyes, I knew he was in cahoots with Zuoqiu Yang!"

"Kill him!"

A portion of the blade light and sword shadows swept toward Xiao Qin.

The Thousand Form Martial Venerable said with a half-smile:

"Now they are."

"....."

Xiao Qin was speechless and was forced to join the battle.

Both were geniuses who could fight above their level despite being at the Internal Breath Realm.

And this group of disguised assassins didn't even have anyone at the Jade Liquid stage of Internal Breath.

The result was self-evident.

This skirmish ended quickly.

The posthouse was filled with corpses. Aside from the disguised chef and shopkeeper who escaped, everyone else lay dead.

Zuoqiu Yang sat heavily back in his seat, wiped the blood from his face, and buried his head to start eating noodles. Before eating, he scraped all the beef into Xiao Qin's bowl.

"Is this considered thanks?"

Xiao Qin sat down, the corner of his mouth twitching.

Zuoqiu Yang swallowed the noodles in one gulp and shook his head:

"No, but I can give you a piece of advice."

"It's not too late to leave now. The ones coming to kill me later won't be the chicken and dog trash from just now."

"Someone else is coming?"

Xiao Qin fell into thought.

However, he still had to wait for someone here.

Seeing that he wasn't moving, Zuoqiu Yang frowned:

"Have you heard of the Huai Mountain Three Evils?"

"I've heard of Huai Mountain, there's a town there."

Xiao Qin shook his head. He had been in the Qingyuan Sect for several years and wasn't too clear on outside matters.

The reason he remembered Huai Mountain Town was because he had passed through it when traveling from Mian River Prefecture to Ziyang Prefecture.

Zuoqiu Yang's face twitched slightly:

"The town... is gone. Not a chicken or dog left. Three years ago, it was occupied by a group of bandits."

"The bandit leader calls himself the Huai Mountain Three Evils. They are biological brothers and are proficient in combined attacks."

As he spoke this, he clenched his fist, his knuckles turning white.

"Oh?"

Xiao Qin's expression shifted slightly:

"Did the government and the sects not care?"

He hadn't seen similar tasks in the External Affairs Hall either.

A touch of sarcasm appeared at the corner of Zuoqiu Yang's mouth:

"Huai Mountain is located on the border between the two prefectures. The Ziyang government said Huai Mountain Town was closer to Mian River Prefecture and wasn't under their jurisdiction. Mian River Prefecture said Huai Mountain Town was separated from their prefecture by a river, and the villagers had matters to go to Ziyang Prefecture, so it should be managed by Ziyang Prefecture."

"They argued back and forth, and I don't know if they forgot about it or if they still haven't settled the jurisdiction issue."

Saying this, he扫视ed the corpses on the ground and muttered to himself:

"It's a pity, the Huai Mountain Three Evils are just accomplices. The people who killed my master still haven't been found..."

As if sensing his sorrow and hatred.

The short knife at his waist actually began to hum softly at this moment.

The killing intent in the hall rose again, making one's blood run cold.

"Go. This is for your own good."

Zuoqiu Yang's voice, filled with chilling murderous aura, came over. It was barely recognizable as human.

Xiao Qin couldn't help but feel his heart sink.

---

The Thousand Form Martial Venerable sighed and said:

"The Unborn Blade Art kills others, kills oneself, and severs emotion and nature. It is a superior martial art of the Fine Rain Pavilion."

"Those who practice this blade art usually do not have good ends. Either they die by someone else's hand, or they die by their own."

"He advised you to leave because he's afraid that when he goes crazy later, he'll chop you down along with him."

Xiao Qin: "....."

So that's what "for your own good" meant.

Zuoqiu Yang didn't speak anymore, quietly accumulating his murderous aura, bringing his momentum to its peak.

At this moment.

Three more figures passed through the rain curtain, getting closer and closer. It was just...

Their speed was a bit fast?

Bang—

Two incredibly wretched figures, like torn gunny sacks, flew into the posthouse, crashing heavily and smashing a table and chairs.

It was the chef and shopkeeper who had fled earlier.

Now, they were taking more breaths in than out, their faces full of terror as if they had seen a ghost.

"Huai Mountain Three Evils?"

Zuoqiu Yang's pupils shook, his mind froze, almost passing out from shock.

Bang— Bang—

Several more figures crashed in.

This time it was three people, looking somewhat similar, each with a sunken chest.

Zuoqiu Yang's expression turned to stone.

Only then did Xiao Qin smack his lips and walk to the door:

"Junior Brother Li, is that you?"

"Sorry for being late, Senior Brother Xiao."

A youth walked in from the door. Although he had come through the heavy rain and had just defeated the Huai Mountain Three Evils—who together could fight an Internal Breath Xuan Dan Realm expert—he was spotless, as if he were a young master out for a spring outing.

It was Li Mo.

He looked at the mess on the ground, raised an eyebrow, rubbed his stomach, and said:

"Where is the waiter? Hiding somewhere?"

"The waiter is here."

Xiao Qin pointed to the ground with some embarrassment.

He had beaten him to death.

"And the shopkeeper?"

"The fat guy you just smashed in is him."

"So the one next to him... is the chef?"

"Right. Brother Li, you're really smart."

".....What the hell happened here."

.....

A quarter of an hour ago.

A carriage descending from the Qingyuan Sect was traveling harmlessly on the road.

"The people from the other sects should have all arrived in the prefecture city already."

"How much longer until we get there?"

Li Mo was driving down the mountain himself for the first time and didn't quite remember the way. There was no navigation in this day and age.

So he lifted the curtain and looked inside.

Ying Bing took out the map given by Qian Bufan from her怀里.

She lowered her eyes to look at it, then gently pointed upwards with her slender hand.

Li Mo pondered.

It's a bit far.

Why would the meeting place be chosen so far from the prefecture city?

Then he saw.

That slender, jade-like finger paused, lifted, and pointed to another spot.

Li Mo looked up in confusion, finding that the Ice Cube was pressing her lips together, her expression clearly uncertain.

After a moment of silence.

She asked softly:

"Is... it not?"

"We aren't going down the mountain to visit relatives, right?"

"Right."

"Then why did you point to my house?"

"....."

Helplessly, Li Mo had to ask for directions.

So he found the people waiting at the intersection, who seemed to be talking.

At first, he thought, although these people were a bit ugly, they were surprisingly nice.

Upon learning they were lost, they were even willing to lead the way.

Who knew that as soon as they arrived at the posthouse entrance, they revealed their true colors, their faces full of ferocity.

And they let out a 'hehehe' laugh.

Who laughs like that?
