# Chapter 38: The Purchase  

Although these were mundane items, when used properly, they could still yield excellent results. Lin Xuan always paid meticulous attention to detail. Even though he had already decided to approach the simple-minded young man in a secluded spot to purchase talismans—and the young man seemed honest—Lin Xuan wasn’t taking any chances. He didn’t plan to reveal his true appearance during the transaction.  

The disguise mask could alter one’s appearance. Of course, such a trick wouldn’t fool the spiritual sense of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, but the young man was clearly a Qi Condensation disciple like himself. As long as the youth didn’t deliberately inspect him with a spell, he wouldn’t be able to see through the disguise.  

Moreover, intentionally using a "Revealing Spell" to scrutinize someone was considered highly impolite—even hostile—behavior among cultivators. Since Lin Xuan was approaching as a major customer, he was confident that even if the young man was a bit slow-witted, he wouldn’t commit such a reckless blunder.  

After carefully considering all possible scenarios and ensuring there were no flaws in his plan, Lin Xuan put on the disguise mask. Instantly, his appearance completely changed—he now looked like a rough, dark-faced man.  

Next, he placed a small, round object under his tongue. This was another mundane item he had acquired from the martial world, capable of altering his voice.  

With everything prepared, Lin Xuan stepped out from behind the tree and continued following the young man at a leisurely pace. After about a quarter of an hour, they arrived at a relatively deserted area.  

It was time to act.  

Lin Xuan glanced around—no one was in sight. He quickened his pace and called out, "Fellow Daoist, please wait!"  

The young man turned around, a hint of wariness flashing in his eyes. "You are...?" he asked hesitantly. "What business do you have with me?"  

Lin Xuan noted the caution in the young man’s expression and inwardly sighed. Despite his simple appearance, the youth was surprisingly sharp—clearly aware of the need for vigilance when encountering strangers. However, his inexperience showed; his wariness was far too obvious.  

Smiling, Lin Xuan stepped forward, deliberately ignoring the young man’s guarded demeanor. "I am Zhao Gang. I’d like to buy your talismans."  

"You want to buy talismans?"  

The young man’s face lit up with joy, his earlier caution vanishing instantly. "You really want to buy them? Wonderful! How many do you need?"  

His excitement was understandable. After setting up his stall for three days without selling a single talisman, he was overjoyed to finally have his first customer. Most young cultivators were impulsive by nature, and few were as composed and patient as Lin Xuan.  

"How many do you have?" Lin Xuan countered.  

The young man blinked in surprise before breaking into a wide grin. "Haha, do you need a large quantity? Let me count them for you."  

With that, he pulled out a thick stack of talismans from his robe and began counting. Lin Xuan remained expressionless, neither impatient nor overly eager, waiting calmly.  

He had chosen this spot to intercept the young man after careful consideration. The path was rarely traveled, with people passing by only once every half-hour or so. There was no need to rush—they had plenty of time.  

"One hundred and eight talismans in total," the young man announced after finishing his count. "How many would you like?"  

"I’ll take them all."  

"All of them?" The young man’s mouth fell open in delight. This was even better than he had hoped. "In that case, I’ll be straightforward. Normally, I charge one low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill for every two talismans. But since you’re buying so many, I’ll give you a discount—just fifty pills in total."  

Fifty. Lin Xuan quickly calculated in his mind. Based on the market prices he had observed earlier, this wasn’t an unreasonable price—it was essentially the cost of producing the talismans. For him, it was a trivial expense.  

Though he was satisfied, Lin Xuan didn’t immediately produce the pills. Instead, he feigned reluctance, hesitating for a long moment. Just as the young man was growing anxious, Lin Xuan sighed heavily, as if making a difficult decision. "Ah, well... I do need these talismans urgently. Fine, it’s a deal."  

Relieved, the young man broke into a foolishly happy grin.  

"These pills took me years of hard work to save up—my entire fortune," Lin Xuan muttered under his breath as he pulled out five jade bottles from his robe.  

This was another example of Lin Xuan’s meticulousness. He paid attention to even the smallest details. For instance, while a single bottle could hold a hundred pills, that would be too conspicuous. Instead, he deliberately split them into smaller quantities—ten pills per bottle—creating the illusion that they had been painstakingly accumulated over time. This way, he avoided drawing unnecessary attention.  

The exchange was completed smoothly—pills for talismans. The young man happily accepted the payment while Lin Xuan carefully counted the talismans. Finding no discrepancies, he didn’t linger. "Farewell, Fellow Daoist."  

"Safe travels," the young man replied with a cupped-fist salute. The transaction had been mutually beneficial.  

Upon returning to the inn, Lin Xuan had lunch before using his identity token to deactivate the wards and enter his room. The morning’s haul had been fruitful. Though these one hundred and eight talismans were considered mediocre, their sheer quantity was valuable. With them, his combat strength had increased slightly.  

He had also gained a clear understanding of market prices, familiarizing himself with the costs of various cultivation items. This knowledge bolstered his confidence for tomorrow’s goal—acquiring a mid-level cultivation technique.  

No—he was determined to succeed.  

After resting on the bed for a while, Lin Xuan estimated that most cultivators would have finished their meals by now. The afternoon market was about to begin. Since staying in his room was dull, he decided to explore further, hoping to stumble upon more useful treasures.  

With this thought, he returned to the plaza. The crowd had grown even larger, the atmosphere livelier. As the treasure exchange event drew nearer, more and more cultivators were arriving.  

Though the marketplace was bustling, few items caught Lin Xuan’s interest. Despite being only at the middle stage of Qi Condensation, his wealth surpassed even that of most Foundation Establishment cultivators. Ordinary goods simply didn’t appeal to him.  

Still, he wasn’t entirely empty-handed. After spending the entire afternoon browsing, Lin Xuan managed to acquire something valuable—spirit stones.  

When he spotted them at a stall, he was genuinely surprised. Spirit stones, rich in natural spiritual energy, were incredibly useful—for cultivation, artifact forging, and combat alike. They rarely appeared in the hands of low-level cultivators.  

So when he saw the two water-attribute spirit stones, Lin Xuan didn’t hesitate. He purchased them immediately and tucked them away.
