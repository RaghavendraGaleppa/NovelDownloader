# Chapter 209: Slaying Demons and Embarking on the Path

Someone didn't like what they heard and immediately retorted, "How can you say that? Senior Brother Li is a heaven-blessed genius, originally possessing near-immortal potential. Due to various unexpected circumstances, he was delayed in becoming an immortal seed. Now that he's embarked on the path, isn't that perfectly normal?"

Immediately, the heated discussion quieted down significantly. After all, Cao Qianqiu's lineage was simply too difficult to provoke.

However, some people were still discussing it in private. "Sigh, Senior Brother Tang Xumi is by no means weaker than him. He just lacks a master at the peak expert level. Now, to embark on that path, he has no choice but to fight with his life on the line. He might die."

"I also heard that Elder Cao once ventured into the terrifying 'Dragon's Waterspout' and harvested invaluable rare materials, naturally formed 'Dragon Blood'. Li Qingxu consumed it, underwent nirvana, and had his innate talent elevated once more!"

Among the core disciples, some were unconvinced. Part of the disciples felt it was unfair to Tang Xumi. His achievements on the immortal path were brilliant, and he had also made significant progress on the path of rebirth, yet now he was risking his life.

Someone looked into the distance, where two streaks of firelight erupted from Tang Xumi's body. His body appeared emaciated, his essence, qi, and spirit seemingly ignited.

"Senior Brother Tang, why go to such lengths?" Someone tried to stop him, worried about his condition.

All the core disciples understood that it was the accumulated power from Tang Xumi's immortal path and path of rebirth burning, as he sought to break through some kind of limit.

Under the twilight, light and shadow dappled. A small path overlapped with the real world, winding forward. Some people could see it, but couldn't step onto it.

Tang Xumi said, "Sometimes at life's crossroads, there's no choice. I'm unwilling to fall behind others; I can only fight with all my might. I'll either break through all the way and ascend to become an immortal seed, or I'll burn to death on the path."

Hu Tingwen advised, "You appear to have a strong life flame now, but in reality, you're burning away your future, overdrawing your own vitality. What's the point?"

"If I pass this hurdle, I'll replenish my lifespan later with the blood of an auspicious beast," Tang Xumi stated.

On his left and right shoulders, fierce flames blazed. These not only represented the two paths but were also seen as his life flame being overdrawn, burning intensely.

***

In the mountains, a demonic beast was in a desperate escape, its white hair dishevelled, covered in blood. Its true form was a giant rhinoceros, but it dared not reveal it now. It was utterly terrified, fleeing frantically through the dense forest. Because it was being hunted by a bug! Fortunately, it knew how to stealthily conceal itself, temporarily shaking off that terrifying opponent possessing a "dual demon seed." The competition for shattered demon seeds was extremely bloody; life and death could be decided at any moment!

***

Qin Ming emerged from seclusion, feeling the threads of new vital energy within him, filled with anticipation. He held a pitch-black Heaven-Measuring Ruler, not concealing his true form. He was searching for other shattered demon seeds. Unfortunately, after completely pulverizing and absorbing the two within him, he could no longer resonate with them and had lost contact with "dual demon seeds." For this, he didn't hesitate to use himself as bait, wandering throughout the realm.

Someone spotted him and said, "Huh, isn't that Shen Wubing? At such a dangerous time, he's actually walking alone in the wilderness. Is he tired of living?"

"Brother Shen!" In the distance, Ling Yu appeared, waving towards them.

Qin Ming approached and asked, "Why are you all so tense?"

Ling Yu informed him, "Wang Lijie's team encountered an insect demon. It charged past them and they lost half their men. They said I definitely wouldn't be its match."

"Where is it?" Qin Ming's eyes immediately lit up.

"Over there, but don't you dare..." Ling Yu pointed the way, but before he could finish speaking, Qin Ming was already far gone, quickly disappearing into the forest.

Zhao Muyao in her snowy robes, along with Wang Lijie and those around them, were all dumbfounded. He went to chase that terrifying bug?!

"Brother Ling, is there something wrong with your friend?" Someone whispered. While others feared avoiding it, that person dared to chase it alone. Regarding that bug, it was widely known in the academies of the Kunling Realm, a renowned demon from the plateau, with potential to become a "demon seed" of its generation!

Qin Ming tracked it all the way, but the more he wanted to find it, the more he couldn't discover any traces of the bug. He did, however, see the special markers left by Xiao Wu and followed them.

Soon, he reunited with Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, and others. They were surprisingly in a small town, where figures bustled and various hawkers called out. This was a secret realm; there shouldn't be such a bustling ancient town here.

"Xiao Wu, are you all alright?" Qin Ming called out.

"Brother, we're fine, come in!" Xiao Wu waved and came to greet him.

The town was very clean, paved with blue stones, with people coming and going, very lively. But the livelier it was, the more abnormal it seemed. Soon, Qin Ming noticed that when he brushed past those people, it was like touching a mirage; there was no real contact, they were all illusions. He immediately concentrated his spirit, and a warm current surged into his eyes. In an instant, he saw that they were just wisps of mist.

Xiao Wu informed him, "Brother, there's a path here. It seems I can embark on it, but I wasn't at ease leaving you, so I've been waiting for you for a long time."

"If you embark on the path, you'll still need a weapon. Try this." Qin Ming handed over the Heaven-Measuring Ruler. It was forged from black jade iron mixed with refined gold, very valuable.

"You... annihilated all of them?" Gan Jincheng was shocked, because the Heaven-Measuring Ruler was the weapon of the leader of that demonic beast team. The others, looking at the black weapon, were also stunned. How terrifying that team was, even more formidable than the demonic beasts in the village.

"My brother's performance like this is completely normal!" Xiao Wu said, taking the Heaven-Measuring Ruler and swinging it forcefully, immediately producing a booming sound.

"How did you discover this path?" Qin Ming asked.

At one end of the small town, there was a blurry path. As the iridescent light within Xiao Wu transformed into a divine bridge and touched it, the path became clear.

Xiao Wu said, "It seems to require resonance with the spiritual domain, and then the path appears." This meant that unless a reborn individual stepped into the Outer Saint domain and gave birth to conscious spiritual light, they wouldn't even have the qualification to try.

Qin Ming was a bit skeptical. After his nine rebirths, his Heavenly Light Energy was fused with consciousness and divine wisdom, theoretically not weak. Why wouldn't it work for him? Then, he tried it there, directly merging all his Heavenly Light Energy into one, and then letting it boil.

In an instant, from Qin Ming's flesh and blood, golden rays of light shone in myriad ways, exceptionally dazzling, expanding beyond his body. Here, it was as if a brilliant scorching sun had risen!

"Ah..." Liu Hanya shrieked, stumbling backward. Jiang Ruoli also quickly dodged. Their faces were pale, startled, because they were too close, and their conscious spiritual light and divine wisdom felt like they were about to burn. This terrified them. It seemed even more overbearing than the legendary Tathagata Energy or Heaven-Propping Energy!

"How is that possible?" Gan Jincheng said in shock, staggering backward.

With a boom, a path unfolded beneath Qin Ming's feet, wide and flowing with golden light. This meant that even without a demon seed, he could embark on the path!

"It's wider and more splendid than my path!" Xiao Wu was mesmerized. Then, the iridescent light within his body flew out, preparing to amplify his resonance. However, no other path reappeared here; only this one.

"Brother, is your path so domineering?" Xiao Wu was stunned, greatly surprised.

The others were also awestruck, as they clearly saw that Qin Ming's path was quite unusual, as if paved with golden flames, wide and dazzling, seemingly able to lead directly to the other shore.

With a whoosh, he retracted his Heavenly Light Energy after the ninth rebirth, and the path immediately vanished.

Xiao Wu tried again, and his path appeared. As he amplified his resonance, it indeed brightened, but it was still dimmer than Qin Ming's path.

"Brother, your path is very special! My path is already brighter than the two paths we saw from a distance, but yours is practically burning!"

At this moment, even Xin Youdao was lost in thought, thinking of what he had just witnessed, finding it utterly preposterous.

Qin Ming said, "It seems only one path can appear near a strange building. You take this one; I still need to hunt demons, so I'll just find another."

Xiao Wu said, "I'll wait for you."

"No, you go ahead and embark on the path first, don't delay. I'll catch up quickly later!" Qin Ming had a plan in mind.

Finally, Xiao Wu embarked on the path, his figure gradually receding and blurring. The path seemed to be in the real world, yet sometimes it led to the clouds, piercing through mountains, utterly absurd. It was as if two worlds were merging, one moment in the current world, the next in a different realm.

Xin Youdao was quite envious. Gan Jincheng, Liu Hanya, and others were also mesmerized. Although they were all geniuses, none of them had the qualifications to embark on a path.

"Our opportunities should still be sought within the secret realm of reality. Let's not gaze into the distance," Jiang Ruoli said calmly, recognizing and accepting the reality.

Soon, the others also realized that such paths only belonged to immortal seeds and divine seeds! Except for Xin Youdao, everyone else had complex expressions. The two young men beside them were actually such astonishing figures; it was simply unimaginable! Earlier, they had thought they were just two nobodies.

"There are also two rather formidable demonic beasts nearby, you all need to be careful," Qin Ming reminded them.

Suddenly, he heard movement in the distance. The ground was trembling slightly; a massive rhinoceros was charging madly. It was a demonic beast with a shattered demon seed. After being discovered by that "dual demon seed" insect demon, it was forced to reveal its true form, accelerating its charge, wanting to escape with its life. It discovered the small town, saw the bustling figures, and immediately charged towards it.

"Am I finally turning my luck around? Things are finally starting to go smoothly," Qin Ming chuckled, quickly arriving outside the town.

"The one behind it is an insect demon, you now..." Xin Youdao warned. After all, even the silver-robed youth earlier had been afraid of the "dual demon seed" insect demon.

Gan Jincheng, Liu Hanya, and the others' faces had already turned pale.

"That was then, this is now!" Qin Ming stated.

The towering white rhinoceros, like a small mountain, had silver runes flowing around its body. Upon seeing the young man in front, its eyes revealed a coldness, and it charged forward regardless. Behind it, a pitch-black bug crunched and clicked, its leg claws tearing through rocks and bushes, rushing forward rapidly, quickly approaching.

Every time the white rhinoceros's massive hooves fell, the ground trembled and cracked open, a truly terrifying sight. It brought one hoof down towards Qin Ming, intending to charge right past him.

However, the next moment, its muscles suddenly tensed. Feeling that something was terribly wrong, its spiritual jade horn immediately glowed, releasing five-colored divine light. Qin Ming naturally wouldn't be trampled. He had already leapt up, level with its head, and unleashed a punch forward.

Although the five-colored light from the rhino horn came towards him, it was all shattered by his single punch, light fragments scattering and dissipating. Moreover, under the surging Heavenly Light Energy, the giant white rhinoceros's face was torn open, blood gushing from its face. At the same time, Qin Ming literally climbed right onto its face, then moved upwards, his right fist clenched, erupting with even more terrifying golden light. He was testing how strong his full power strike was after his ninth rebirth!

The white rhinoceros was terrified, sensing impending doom. Silver runes flowed over its entire body, and it shook its head and tail, trying to fling the human youth off. However, it was too late. Once Qin Ming got close, it was difficult to shake him off; he could stick to his opponent's body.

It was like heavenly lightning pouring down. In mid-air, not only was the light dazzling, but the sound was immense. Qin Ming's full-power punch blasted through the white rhinoceros's skull. Right on its forehead, a bloody gaping hole appeared, blasted open by Qin Ming's utterly powerful punch. Then, its entire skull shattered. Like a golden mountain toppling a jade pillar, with a thunderous roar, the massive white rhinoceros crashed down in front of the small town, drawing its last breath.

A shattered demon seed flew out, heading towards Qin Ming, who wrapped it in a tattered cloth woven from exotic gold, beginning to refine it. Qin Ming floated to the ground, very satisfied with his performance after the ninth rebirth. Indeed, after fusing six extraordinary arts, his Heavenly Light Energy had undergone a qualitative transformation.

A giant bug, like a black armored vehicle, arrived. It seemed quite apprehensive after witnessing this scene. It was spider-shaped but had an extra scorpion tail, held high, its sharp tail stinger dark and fearsome. Moreover, it didn't seem to be made of flesh and blood. Its entire body was black and shiny, as if cast from metal. When its leg claws scraped the ground, rocks would crack, indicating how hard and sharp they were.

The Spider-Scorpion was a renowned demon from the plateau. Many old demons held high hopes for it, believing it might become a new generation's demon seed. After the man and the demon met, no words were exchanged. They charged directly at each other, attacking with full force.

Qin Ming drew his Mutton-Fat Jade Iron Blade, and as if standing in a scorching sun, he began to battle it. The Spider-Scorpion attacked with lightning, spewed fire, and even unleashed lightning-fast spiderwebs, employing every trick it had. Its spider legs jabbed like spears, and its scorpion tail was extremely dazzling. It was like a soul reaper from hell.

Boom! Boom!

Outside the small town, that area erupted. Wherever the spider legs passed, massive rocks and ancient towering trees shattered. When the scorpion tail accidentally brushed against the white rhinoceros's enormous corpse, it instantly turned into a pool of rotten blood and mud.

The Spider-Scorpion was truly strong. Qin Ming attacked with full power, swinging his blade hundreds of times before it even began to sustain injuries. Qin Ming protected himself with sun-like Heavenly Light Energy, blocking the strange poison that could erode the spiritual domain.

Clang!

A spider leg flew off. The next instant, black venom splattered, and the scorpion tail was severed. Qin Ming, bathed in golden light, continuously swung his blade. Finally, spider legs flew, demon-qi-formed spiderwebs shattered, lightning and fire extinguished, and the insect demon's head was split open by him.

After a fierce battle, Qin Ming slew the Spider-Scorpion! Two shattered demon seeds flew out, rushing towards him. He likewise collected them with the tattered cloth, beginning to refine the demons.

Qin Ming strode away into the distance, looking for other small towns, preparing to embark on the path.

Behind him, Gan Jincheng, Jiang Ruoli, Liu Hanya, and the others were all petrified, utterly shaken. An even more formidable demonic beast had just been blasted apart by him!

In an ancient town, two paths actually appeared beneath Qin Ming's feet. This made him fall into a daze, with each of his left and right feet stepping on one.
