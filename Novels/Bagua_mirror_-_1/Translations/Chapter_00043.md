# Chapter 43: Calculations

"This trial is really..."

"Another job for the Canglong Valley. They just sit back and reap the rewards."

"What kind of arrangement is this?"

Suddenly, someone shouted, "Sect Leader Cao, your Canglong Secret Realm has many second-tier and above demonic beasts! Not only do we have to watch out for ambushes from other cultivators, but we also have to deal with second-tier beasts. Isn't this too dangerous?"

"Everyone, please remain calm," Cao Zhengxiong responded. "How could we not ensure your safety for this trial? Recently, our sect's artifact and talisman masters jointly crafted a large number of disposable small teleportation talismans. Each of you will receive one. If you encounter danger beyond your capability, activate it immediately to exit the secret realm."

At these words, the crowd's agitation settled.

He continued, "Additionally, we're offering greater rewards for top performers. The top ten will each receive a Foundation Establishment Pill."

"A Foundation Establishment Pill! I'll fight tooth and nail for that this time."

"Ten Foundation Establishment Pills? Canglong Valley is really going all out."

"With rewards like these, won't everyone be fighting to the death?"

"What's there to fear? The small teleportation talismans guarantee our safety."

"The top five, regardless of talent, will be accepted as nominal disciples by our Golden Core elders!"

"Madness! Canglong Valley has gone mad!"

"These rewards are simply heaven-defying!"

"I'm going all in! All in!"

"Golden Core experts! We might never get another chance to even see one in our lifetime. This trip was worth it just for this!"

"The top fifty will directly become inner sect disciples, with an opportunity to select a cultivation technique."

"There are still more rewards?"

"This is unbelievable!"

"Hahaha! Fantastic! This is truly a once-in-a-millennium opportunity!"

Watching the crowd's soaring enthusiasm and fighting spirit, Cao Zhengxiong's face beamed with satisfaction. This was precisely the effect he wanted. By deliberately revealing information piecemeal, he had successfully stoked their emotions.

Yet Qin Chong remained calm amidst the excitement, thoughtfully observing the fervor around him.

Sect Leader Cao truly lived up to his reputation as Canglong Valley's leader. This single move demonstrated his extraordinary capability.

Even so, Qin Chong sensed there was more to this than met the eye.

Cao Zhengxiong spoke again, "For those who don't pass the trial, we'll purchase materials you've collected in the secret realm at a set ratio. You'll still earn a considerable amount of spirit stones—certainly worth your while."

"Now, please follow our disciples' instructions in an orderly manner and board the Flying Dragon Boats. We'll depart immediately for the Canglong Secret Realm. The trial will begin in three days and last three months. Those who fail to leave on time will face the consequences."

As his words faded, Canglong Valley disciples sprang into action.

Within half an hour, dozens of Flying Dragon Boats set off in a grand procession toward the secret realm, each vessel manned by two Foundation Establishment disciples.

These sizable boats could easily carry fifty to sixty people each.

Only after watching the fleet's glowing trails disappear into the distance did Cao Zhengxiong flash away toward the sect's main hall.

Inside, three men and one woman—all Golden Core cultivators—awaited. Two were mid-stage Golden Core, the others early-stage. These four were Canglong Valley's Golden Core elders.

They had been deep in discussion but turned their attention to Cao Zhengxiong as he entered.

"Greetings, Elders," he said with a bow.

"Nephew Cao, is everything prepared?" asked Zhuge Lun, the sect's second elder, who had reached the peak of mid-stage Golden Core.

"Elder Zhuge, all arrangements are complete. The rest depends on these juniors."

"Alas, this is our only option. For Elder Lin's attempt at Nascent Soul breakthrough, we have no choice."

"With so many entering, the secret realm may need extended closure afterward to recover."

"Only the five of us know of this. Ensure no leaks occur during cleanup. Though the other sects may grow suspicious, our earlier rumors have taken root. They won't uncover the truth anytime soon."

"We've prepared secretly for over a decade. There will be no mistakes."

"Good. Proceed with the next phase. We'll begin our part."

"Yes, Elder!"

The Canglong Secret Realm wasn't far from the sect, but the journey crossed dense forests teeming with second-tier demonic beasts—hence the Flying Dragon Boats.

Compared to surrounding peaks, Qianlong Peak wasn't the tallest but covered one of the largest areas. The secret realm lay in a valley beneath it.

Before the boats even landed, a massive blue barrier came into view, its spiritual energy rippling faintly.

As the fleet descended, cultivators disembarked one after another.

On a clearing before the barrier, Canglong Valley's managing disciples organized the crowd into five long lines.

"Fellow cultivators, please line up orderly to receive your small teleportation talismans," announced Meng Fei, whom Qin Chong recognized. "Additionally, we've prepared simplified maps of the secret realm for purchase at three hundred low-grade spirit stones each. These jade slips required significant effort to produce."

That Meng Fei was overseeing this confirmed his high status in the sect. The price tag caused murmurs, but no one would abandon this rare opportunity over mere spirit stones.

"Canglong Valley really knows how to do business. With over eight hundred people, that's a fortune."

"What can we do? It's their secret realm."

"Don't fret. Even if we fail, we can earn back the spirit stones afterward. No real loss."

Amidst the mixed reactions, Qin Chong pondered while waiting in line.

Canglong Valley's meticulous planning left no stone unturned, maximizing their gains at every turn—a true win-win where they profited doubly.

Yet allowing so many rogue cultivators and minor clan members into their secret realm was highly unusual. Could there be deeper schemes at play?

Like the others, Qin Chong was now in too deep to back out. He could only proceed cautiously, one step at a time.
