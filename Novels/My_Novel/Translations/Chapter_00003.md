# Chapter 3: The Mistress Returns, the Malicious Servant's Face

Night.

Li Xian lay on the wooden plank bed. The other laborers on either side were already asleep. Snoring filled the air, and the stench of sweat and feet was unbearable.

Laborers weren't qualified to bathe. They had to endure being filthy and sticky until the two bath days each month, when they could finally wash themselves in a hurry.

He couldn't sleep for a long time, turning things over in his mind.

"Bihao was right about one thing: even a laborer needs a skill to rely on."

"If I could learn a bit of cooking or some gardening, my life in the mansion would definitely be much better. If there's a chance, I should try to climb up."

As a transmigrator, this ambition seemed a bit too small.

But the cruelty of reality was just like that.

He rested his head on his hands behind his head. Moonlight shone on his cheek, his eyes unusually bright.

"I've been here for over half a month. I wonder what this world is really like?"

He stopped thinking and closed his eyes to sleep.

Perhaps knowing that his younger brother's food and clothing were no longer a worry, his mind was clear, and he slept exceptionally soundly.

In the blink of an eye, it was the fifth watch. It was still dark, but Li Xian woke up first. Suddenly, something flashed before his eyes.

\[Skill: Sleeping\]

\[Proficiency: 2/500 (Beginner)\]

\[Description: Since ancient times, who hasn't slept? Don't wait until your final sleep to know the value of slumber.\]

"Could there be a trick to something as ordinary as sleeping?"

Before Li Xian could ponder it, the head laborer struck the bronze gong.

*Clang!*

*Clang!*

"Wake up, wake up. Time to start work."

This was the daily wake-up call. Once the gong sounded, it signaled the start of the day's labor.

Because he had done a good job pulling weeds yesterday, Bihao had arranged for Li Xian to deal with the backyard of the abandoned house again.

He was specifically in charge of the weeding area.

This thankless, bitter task was firmly placed on Li Xian's shoulders.

"Work hard, Xiao Li," Bihao said perfunctorily and turned to leave.

Li Xian was happy to have some peace and quiet. This patch of weeds was nothing to him.

Now that he was familiar with the work, it was actually much easier than other jobs. He rolled up his sleeves, bent his waist, and got to work with his head down.

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Skill: Weeding\]

\[Proficiency: 19/1000 (Expert)\]

The more he weeded, the more adept he became. With each bend of his waist, a sense of natural grace subtly emerged.

In the evening, Bihao made his routine inspection. Seeing that the backyard was once again clean and tidy, he nodded secretly in approval.

However, this time, he didn't give Li Xian a reward. He just said coldly, "Good. Go to the隔壁房 (next door) tomorrow and continue pulling weeds."

This went on for several days in a row.

Li Xian didn't have to do anything else, focusing solely on weeding. Outsiders thought he was suffering, but they didn't know that he had more and more free time.

It only took him half a day to clear the weeds from the entire backyard. The other half of the day was entirely devoted to practicing the "Wild Bull Fist."

That evening.

\[Proficiency is full!\]

\[Skill: Weeding\]

\[Proficiency: 0/1500 (Minor Accomplishment)\]

\[Description: After pulling weeds a thousand times, their meaning reveals itself. Pay attention to your breathing, and you might discover its subtleties?\]

Based on the \[Description\], Li Xian focused on his breathing while weeding. He felt the fatigue in his body being greatly alleviated.

"After reaching Minor Accomplishment in weeding, it seems to have improved my stamina and resistance to fatigue."

"This effect seems to originate from... breathing?"

He discovered that his breathing was becoming increasingly smooth and natural. It was hard to describe, but it was definitely beneficial.

\[Wild Bull Fist (Incomplete Form)\]

\[Proficiency: 139/1000 (Expert)\]

In comparison, the Wild Bull Fist was progressing slightly slower, but it was still quite impressive.

He could feel the heat in his lower abdomen growing stronger, changing from a small thread to the thickness of a finger.

His punches were more powerful. These things gave him a bit of a sense of security.

"Weeding every day gives me a lot of free time, but... it does nothing to improve my status."

"How can I break out of this situation?"

Li Xian had to think about it. Now that he was deep inside a large mansion, the only way was to climb up!

Just then, a commotion suddenly erupted in the courtyard. A sound of footsteps quickly approached.

"Brother Li, Brother Li! The Mistress has returned. Master Bihao told us to hurry to the village entrance to greet her. Anyone who's even a second late will have their legs broken!"

A laborer shouted loudly. The sound went from loud to soft, showing that he was running while shouting, in a hurry to gather.

"The Mistress?"

Li Xian had long been extremely curious about this mysterious Mistress. He immediately ran out of the abandoned house and joined the group of laborers.

Bihao and Luofang were both there.

The usually arrogant Bihao had a fawning smile on his face, bowing and sucking in his stomach, looking just like a grandson.

His uncle, Luofang, was also hunched over, not daring to stand up straight, looking extremely nervous.

Luofang was just a steward. Above him were the head accountant, the chief guard, the personal maid...

But with Li Xian's status, it was difficult for him to even see Luofang on a normal day. The chief guard and the personal maid... were all untouchable figures.

"Sigh, just one manor, and the hierarchy is already so strict."

Li Xian blended into the crowd.

Although he was a servant, his life not his own, his spirit hadn't been crushed. His courage was also a bit bolder. Though he lowered his head, he dared to use his peripheral vision to observe.

He saw four sedan carriers coming down a distant mountain path, carrying a red sedan chair.

Before they even got close, a faint, fragrant breeze wafted to his nose.

"Wow, such a luxurious big sedan chair. To live like this is truly magnificent," Li Xian thought to himself.

In a daze, the sedan chair had already stopped in front of the manor.

"My Lady," the chief guard, Pang Long, stepped forward to greet her, kneeling on one knee.

Luofang, Bihao, and the others knelt on both knees, bending their waists as much as possible, their foreheads touching the ground.

Only in this way could the distinction between superior and inferior be shown.

The many laborers, on the other hand, because their bodies were dirty, stood further away and had to keep their heads lowered. Not knowing what was happening and with no one to direct them, they just stood there dumbly.

Li Xian didn't do anything to attract attention, only daring to use his peripheral vision to take a vague look...

The vermilion-red curtain was lifted, and a woman in a white dress stepped out. The woman seemed to have a beautiful figure, her long hair like a waterfall, but he couldn't see clearly.

He could only catch a glimpse of the hem of her skirt, which was spotless white, made of fine brocade, with golden embroidery on the edges.

"I've just returned from a banquet and am a bit tired. Let's keep everything simple. There's no need for such a grand reception," the Manor Mistress spoke, her voice like a celestial melody.

The personal maid said, "My Lady, I have prepared hot water. Would you like to wash up first?"

"Alright," the Manor Mistress nodded.

The Manor Mistress and her personal maid left. Then the chief guard left, and only then did Bihao and Luofang, the uncle and nephew, get to their feet.

"TV dramas are all lies. Even if a true big shot is right in front of you, you don't even have the资格 to look," Li Xian, having lived two lives, felt more sentimental than others and gave a bitter, self-deprecating smile.

"The Manor Mistress's cultivation seems to have improved again."

"Uncle Luofang, what level do you think the Manor Mistress is at now? Has she reached the legendary Blood Transformation Realm?"

"Xiao Bihao, how have I taught you on a daily basis? The Mistress's affairs are not for us to discuss. However, I heard that the Songjiang Sword Sect within the Qiong Tian Mansion once invited the Mistress to be an Honorary Elder. The Mistress refused."

"The Mistress travels the martial world, has many friends, and a great reputation. It's a pity that we are as lowly as mud, not even qualified to inquire."

"Uncle Luofang, to be honest with you, I once had the fortune to smell Lord Pang's fart. That aroma... was more fragrant than any wine or meat."

"Hahaha, quite right, quite right."

The dialogue between the uncle and nephew silently influenced the many laborers. They felt that such high-class people were like stars in the sky, and whatever they did was right.

"You little bastards, what are you still standing there for? Is the work done? Don't wait for me to check in the evening, or I'll whip you!"

Having bent over for a whole day, Bihao now straightened his chest again. He bossed the laborers around, showing off his vigor and pride.
