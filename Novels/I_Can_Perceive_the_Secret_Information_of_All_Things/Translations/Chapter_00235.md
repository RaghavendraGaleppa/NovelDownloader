# Chapter 235: Sunken Coffin Lake

Xiao Ji purchased a mountain.  

The location was decent—not too deep within the Ten Thousand Ancient Immortal Forest, nor within the borders of any mortal kingdom. It was situated in a slightly desolate area within human territory, somewhat distant from the floating ship routes.  

If this mountain were treated as a commodity, one could only say its quality was passable, given the price. After all, acquiring a better peak would have been nearly impossible even with a million spirit stones.  

However, whether a mountain possessed abundant spiritual energy, whether its blessings were efficacious, or whether it drew bustling crowds—these were all uncertain.
