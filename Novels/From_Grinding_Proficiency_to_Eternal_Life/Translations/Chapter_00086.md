# Chapter 86: One Hundred Thousand Tiger Vanguard Black Armor

"Senior Brother, may I have a word in private?"

Chu Xuan's fingertips trembled slightly, her red nail polish nearly smudging the other's moon-white robes.

Under the shade of the green pines, the gentle smile on Ning Wuque's lips froze.

When he heard that "the Sky-Silk Thread was to be given to Xu Yunfan," the knuckles gripping his sword suddenly turned white, the veins on the back of his hand writhing like earthworms. This slip lasted only a moment.

Ning Wuque's gentle expression stiffened, then rapidly cooled. He stared deeply at Chu Xuan.

"Are you telling the truth?"

Chu Xuan nodded repeatedly. "I heard Father say it myself, Senior Brother. You should go reason with him. Given your seniority in the Sky Cicada Sect, there's no way Xu Yunfan should be the one to use the Sky-Silk Thread."

After a long silence, a faint smile appeared on Ning Wuque's face in the shadows, but it sent a chill down one's spine.

"Be careful with your words, Junior Sister."

The dragon pattern on the sword's pommel pressed against his palm. Ning Wuque's voice remained as gentle as a spring breeze brushing the willows.

"Junior Brother Xu is a martial arts genius rarely seen in a century..."

He suddenly looked up as sunlight was obscured by floating clouds. In the shadow, his scholar-like face revealed a hint of viciousness. "Just like Uncle-Master Liu Tianyun twenty years ago."

He slowly turned his head, his gaze sharp and predatory.

"The Sky Cicada Sect is fortunate to have Junior Brother Xu. Do not speak words that harm unity. Let this matter rest."

Chu Xuan was startled by his gaze and took a step back, the dry branch under her embroidered shoe snapping with a crisp sound.

By the time she regained her senses, Ning Wuque had already returned to the center of the training ground, gently instructing the Fourth Senior Brother on the essentials of Sky Cicada Strength.

The morning light cast a golden edge on his profile, as if the distortion from just a moment ago was merely an illusion.

"Blockhead!"

The girl stamped her foot, the silver bells on her wrist jingling chaotically. Suddenly, she slapped her head. Why not just go talk to Father herself?

She immediately turned and headed straight for the back mountain.

As she passed Xu Yunfan, she suddenly spun and flicked her sleeve. Using the cover of her wide sleeve, she shot a silver needle straight for his Zusanli acupoint. This was her seventh attempt this month to test him.

Xu Yunfan seemed to casually kick away a pebble. A blue brick under his foot shattered and splintered. Amidst the clattering sounds, the silver needle embedded itself perfectly into the blue brick.

Chu Xuan didn't hesitate anymore. She immediately strode away, heading for the back mountain of the sect gate. As she passed Xu Yunfan, who happened to be coming from the back mountain, and saw his gaze sweeping over her, she couldn't help but roll her eyes, let out a cold snort, and quickly walked past.

Xu Yunfan turned back, watching Chu Xuan's scarlet skirt hem disappear at the end of the stone path. A sneer escaped his nostrils.

This woman's infatuation with Ning Wuque was simply laughable. If Ning Wuque let out a loud fart, she would probably treat it as celestial music. She would probably enshrine even the night soil bucket in the latrine with carved flowers and jade inlay.

She was truly a green tea bitch. Over the past month, he had figured it out—this woman's mind was entirely on Ning Wuque. If Ning Wuque raised his butt, she would worry about whether he might have diarrhea.

Ning Wuque could casually say a couple of words and easily turn this pure love-brain's head upside down.

It was simply beyond words.

Three days later, at the foot of Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

Ning Wuque stood before the mountain gate in a cyan robe, a superior-grade silver dragon sword slanted at his waist. The blood patterns on the long sword flickered faintly in the morning light.

Behind him, Third Senior Brother Pi Zhi'an carried a nine-ringed broadsword, and Fourth Senior Brother Zhu Yi hung twin swords at his waist. Over two hundred disciples stood in neat rows, a killing aura soaring straight to the heavens.

"Set off."

At Ning Wuque's command, the team wound its way down the mountain like a long dragon.

He turned back to look at the mountain gate, his gaze lingering for a moment on the plaque of the Sky Cicada Sect, a faint, almost imperceptible smile curling at the corners of his mouth.

Chen Tiangang watched them depart and said, "The Jade Capital Circuit is the most prosperous and flourishing of the entire Great Zhou. It can be said to be supported by the vast resources of all directions, with countless rare treasures. Of the nine top sects under the heavens of Great Zhou, seven are within the Jade Capital Circuit, and the city of Jade Capital itself occupies three-tenths of the resources of the entire Jade Capital Circuit."

"That one hundred thousand Tiger Vanguard Black Armor are all martial artists who have entered the Dao. The general leading them is even a Marrow Refining master."

All of them are martial artists who have entered the Dao!

Xu Yunfan was inwardly shocked. A single martial artist who has entered the Dao consumes far more than an ordinary person. Daily martial training requires supplying Qi and Blood Pills, along with medicinal supplements and meals.

Ten thousand troops, the daily resource supply, is an astronomical figure.

Hearing Xu Yunfan's疑惑, Chen Tiangang let out a soft snort.

"A single martial artist who has entered the Dao consumes ten catties of fine meat and three Qi and Blood Pills daily."

"Ten thousand troops, just the meat consumption alone would be a million catties daily, plus three hundred thousand Qi and Blood Pills..."

"No wonder, back in Changyi, Qingzhou, those scholars said the Incense Fire Cult in Wuzhou was just a minor itch. Among the sixteen states of Yanbei Circuit, Wuzhou is utterly insignificant..."

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, recalling when he had crossed Wuzhou from north to south—Dingbei City, Dayi City, Feihe Pass...

City after city, almost annihilated by the战火 stirred up by the Incense Fire Cult.

Those were all vibrant lives, yet in the eyes of those at the top, they were nothing more than a string of cold numbers.

Xu Yunfan shook his head, his gaze becoming resolute. His strength was still insufficient. Dwelling on these matters would only add unnecessary trouble. It was better to spend more time cultivating.

In the days that followed, without Ning Wuque and Chu Xuan, things were finally quiet. Xu Yunfan basically wouldn't show himself unless necessary. When the opportunity arose, he would simply kill her. With his master Chen Tiangang present, it wasn't convenient for him to make a move right now.

Once they were down the mountain, if the chance came, he definitely wouldn't let it slip.

Every day, he practiced Sky Cicada Strength in the morning, wielded the Gale Hammer at noon, plucked his great tendons in the evening to stretch his bones and muscles, and at night, he held the Seal of the Lin Character, recited the Heart Mantra of 'The Highest Good is Like Water,' and cultivated the Lin Character Mantra.

His days were almost completely filled.

The morning light was dim. Xu Yunfan stood bare-chested atop the mountain peak.

He stretched his arms, his bones emitting a dense series of cracking sounds. The muscles all over his body were knotted like dragons, and dark red blood lines writhed like snakes beneath his skin.

As Sky Cicada Strength circulated, his veins pulsed, and the patterns of a cicada's wings flickered faintly.

"Ha!"

With a low shout, the sound of his fist wind howled.

A bluestone ten paces away shattered on cue. Amidst the fragments, the edge of the fist print was visible, with fine, trembling ripples left behind.

Xu Yunfan retracted his stance and exhaled, a sharp light flashing in his eyes.

'You have diligently practiced Sky Cicada Strength, becoming increasingly proficient in using bone trembling and cicada chirring to generate force. You can now use it as you wish and have finally found the key. Sky Cicada Strength proficiency has increased.'

"..."

Every time he saw the proficiency prompt in his vision, he felt a deep sense of satisfaction.

After eating, at noon, in the training ground.

Xu Yunfan held the War Drum瓮金 Hammer. His arm muscles were knotted and his veins bulged. As he wielded this heavy steel hammer, it brought forth howling winds.

"Boom!"

One hammer slammed down, and the bluestone ground cracked like a spider's web.

Xu Yunfan's figure turned, and his other hammer swept out, a dense series of popping sounds exploding in the air. This was his daily essential practice of the Gale Hammer Method, aimed at tempering his bones and muscles and increasing his strength.

Although this Red Lined Copper Body Gale Hammer had already reached Great Completion, practicing it diligently every day still saw his proficiency steadily increasing.

He wasn't far from the true state of perfect skin tempering.
