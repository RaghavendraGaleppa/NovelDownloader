# Chapter 17: The Mission

Late at night, in the residence of Squire Wu in the western part of the city.

Lin Shan pierced through the rice paper window of the side chamber and peered inside, spotting a middle-aged fat man sound asleep with what appeared to be his wife beside him. After waiting a while and sensing no movement, he quietly pushed open the door and slipped in. He knocked the fat man unconscious and carried him out to the courtyard, where there happened to be a well with a bucket and ladle nearby.

A ladle of cold water splashed over the man's face jolted him awake. Before he could cry out, a long blade was already pressed against his neck.

"Keep your voice down. I ask, you answer," came a cold voice from beside him. The sudden chill of the water had sharpened Squire Wu's senses, and he was now mostly awake.

He didn't dare look up, uncertain whether the assassin wore a mask. He knew enough about the underworld's rules—not seeing the assassin's face might leave him a chance to live, but seeing it would mean certain death. He nodded obediently.

"You know about the Yelang Ancient Tomb, don't you?"

"Y-yes..."

"You were the first to discover it, correct?"

"It was my men who found it."

"What did you bring out from inside?"

"A statue of Buddha and a golden bell."

"Nothing else?"

"Nothing else."

The blade pressed tighter against his neck, and Squire Wu felt something warm trickling down.

"Really nothing else?"

"Nothing, I swear! I can have my men explain in detail if you want."

Squire Wu was on the verge of tears.

Lin Shan's threats yielded no further information, and his expression darkened. "Call everyone who entered the tomb to come here. I'll be watching you from behind—don't try anything funny!"

For the sake of ancient essence, Lin Shan wasn't about to overlook any detail.

...

A short while later, the courtyard held not only the naked Squire Wu with Lin Shan's blade still at his neck but also five shirtless men standing in a row.

These five had been roused from sleep by Squire Wu, who had warned them not to make a sound before leading them one by one into the courtyard, where they found a black-clad assassin waiting coldly with a large blade.

The men exchanged uneasy glances as Lin Shan cut to the chase: "Aside from the golden bell and Buddha statue, what else did you take from the tomb?"

"Nothing."

"Nothing else."

"Nothing."

...

No matter how Lin Shan pressed them, all five insisted they had only taken the bell and the statue.

"Are you telling me that a tomb as large as the Yelang Ancient Tomb only yielded these two items?" Lin Shan's gaze flickered between Squire Wu and the five men, suspecting they had already coordinated their stories.

By now, it was the fifth watch of the night. Dark clouds obscured the moon, and the atmosphere grew unbearably tense.

One of the men, a short, pockmarked fellow, hesitated before speaking up: "Esteemed warrior, we did find many things in the burial chamber, but... when we were leaving, we encountered something... unnatural."

At this, the pockmarked man swallowed hard, his face pale with remembered fear.

"We were carrying the Buddha statue and the golden bell when suddenly, a coffin behind us opened on its own. A green-faced, fanged creature leaped out. To escape, we dropped everything else in the tomb's tunnels—only keeping the black Buddha and golden bell, which seemed the most valuable."

"You're saying the creature came from a coffin?" Lin Shan was stunned. Could there really be zombies in this world?

"Yes!"

"It's true!"

"I saw it too!"

...

The men's terrified expressions seemed genuine.

"After we returned, we spread the news, hoping others would scout the tomb for us. But..." 

He didn't need to finish. Lin Shan understood.

The golden bell and Buddha statue they'd brought back were extraordinary. Having tasted such riches, they couldn't bear to leave the rest behind. So they'd stirred up the greed of others, sending them into the tomb as cannon fodder.

If those people died, so be it. If they returned alive, they'd be robbed.

Lin Shan pressed for more details—such as the identity of the nobleman from the capital who had purchased the giant black lotus Buddha statue—but Squire Wu claimed ignorance. The buyer had left no information.

After thorough interrogation yielded nothing new, Lin Shan knocked them all unconscious and left them in the courtyard, scaling the wall and vanishing into the night.

He could only imagine what the household would think come morning, finding six naked men sprawled in the courtyard.

...

Half an hour later, Lin Shan arrived at the "Jing'an Hall" in the northern part of the city—the local branch of the Nightingale organization.

The first floor bustled as usual, with black-clad assassins coming and going through various entrances.

Lin Shan approached a counter directly. "I need all available intelligence on the Yelang Ancient Tomb."

The intelligence officer behind the counter remained impassive. "Only members of Protector rank or above may access such information without an assigned mission."

Lin Shan: "..."

Turning to the center of the hall, he studied the massive task board hanging from the fourth floor. After some searching, he finally spotted five or six missions related to the Yelang Ancient Tomb in the southeast corner:

"Investigate identities of missing persons in Yelang Ancient Tomb—10 contribution points."

"Assess threat level of supernatural entities in Yelang Ancient Tomb—15 contribution points."

"Retrieve map lost in Yelang Ancient Tomb—15 contribution points."

...

It seemed that even a month after the incident, the tomb still drew considerable attention.

The employers' requests varied widely—some wanted to know who had entered, others sought information on the creatures within, and some desired a map of the tomb's passages.

Lin Shan stared at the board, wrestling with indecision. The vivid descriptions of the coffin-dwelling zombie from Squire Wu's men, coupled with the countless disappearances, gave him pause. As a newly minted Houtian-level martial artist, was he truly capable of completing such a mission?

The Nightingale organization's rules were strict: once a mission was accepted, no one else could take it until the deadline passed. But once accepted, it had to be attempted—even if failure was certain. 

For instance, if Lin Shan took the mission to investigate the tomb's missing persons, he would have to enter at least once, either completing the task or providing evidence of the attempt. 

Failure to do so would be seen as sabotaging the mission, inviting the organization's relentless pursuit.

The hall remained busy, with passing assassins paying no heed to Lin Shan's prolonged hesitation. The staff had seen countless rookies struggle with such decisions.

...

After a long internal debate, Lin Shan gritted his teeth and made his choice. He would take the mission.

The golden bell he'd seen earlier had to be acquired soon—within a month, or someone else might claim it, and with it, the 8 points of ancient essence. Earning 3,000 taels of gold through gradual means was impossible; even robbing the rich wouldn't suffice in such a short time.

His only option was a windfall.

Besides, if five ordinary men like Squire Wu's subordinates had escaped, a martial artist like himself stood a chance. 

Moreover, if he could retrieve the burial artifacts they'd dropped in the tomb's tunnels before the creatures awoke, securing the ancient essence in advance, his odds of survival would improve.

Approaching the mission desk, Lin Shan handed over his identity token. "I'll take mission seventy-five."

The Nightingale operative processed the request efficiently, returning the token along with a plate engraved with "75."

"Assassin Xin-21 accepts mission seventy-five: investigate identities of missing persons in Yelang Ancient Tomb. Deadline: ten days."

Lin Shan turned to the intelligence desk, presenting the mission plate. The officer nodded, retrieving a stack of documents for him. Lin Shan found a window, leaped out, and vanished into the night.

Unbeknownst to him, a black-clad figure emerged from the shadows after his departure, a faint scar visible between his brows.

"Xin-21... So you've finally shown yourself."
