# Chapter Twelve: Fear of Death  

**Xiangzhou, Wang Family Ancestral Residence.**  

The current head of the Wang family, Wang Tianhe, glared furiously at a tall figure standing before him. He laughed bitterly and said, "A false charge is easy to fabricate!"  

"My son, Xuanli, has long since traveled west to the Qin Kingdom. Ten days ago, he was engaged in a sword duel with the son of the Marquis of Liyang, a pillar of the Western Qin. This news has spread across all four kingdoms—everyone knows it!"  

"Ten days isn’t enough time to return to the Great Jin, let alone journey to the northern territories!"  

"The Prime Minister imprisoned the Northern Defense General on baseless charges. Does he now intend to do the same to my Wang family?"  

The tall, fair-skinned man wearing a high crown smiled faintly. "Whether Wang Xuanli is truly in the Western Qin remains to be verified. However, the emergence of a young man in the north who has mastered the *Triple Origin Qi Art* is an indisputable fact."  

"The Wang family pledged not to interfere in northern affairs. Why break that promise now?"  

Wang Tianhe sneered. "Once I give my word, I never go back on it."  

"Bring out the family register. Let this Chief Steward Dai personally verify every name."  

"If even one person cannot account for their whereabouts, I, Wang Tianhe, will dash my brains out right here."  

"I only fear that someone is deliberately framing us."  

Steward Dai raised his hand, stopping the retrieval of the family register. His gaze deepened as he spoke meaningfully, "Your words alone are sufficient."  

"Without the Wang family's protection, a young man under twenty who has reached the Xiantian realm—no matter how talented—is still just a Xiantian warrior."  

As Steward Dai turned to leave, a hand suddenly gripped his shoulder. Wang Tianhe's earlier defiance and cold words were gone, replaced by a warm smile. "Steward Dai, you’ve come all this way. Why leave so soon?"  

"Tea! Bring out my finest tea at once!"  

"Steward Dai, please elaborate."  

"The *Triple Origin Qi Art* has always been difficult to master. Even with the Wang family's resources, we have no Xiantian warrior under twenty."  

"Is it possible there was a mistake?"  

"Of course, I don’t mean to doubt you. But this matter is too malicious—someone is clearly trying to sow discord."  

"After some thought, I believe I should personally visit the northern territories to verify the truth. After all, no one is more qualified than I to determine whether it truly is the *Triple Origin Qi Art*."  

"If it turns out to be true, rest assured, Steward Dai, I will not let the culprit escape."  

"I will capture them and punish them severely."  

Such a promising talent must be rigorously trained—their potential must not be wasted.

**Shamelessly Seeking Knowledge.**  

This was a fine tradition.  

Dou Changsheng was not one to pretend to understand what he didn’t. Seizing the opportunity, he began asking questions.  

A Houtian warrior opened meridians, connected the Heavenly and Earthly acupoints, and derived Xiantian inner qi. The cultivation of a Xiantian warrior involved the Five Qi Converging to the Origin and the Three Flowers Gathering at the Summit.  

After the Five Qi Converged, one reached the Xiantian True Realm, where Xiantian inner qi advanced to Xiantian true qi. Following the Three Flowers Gathering, one entered the Xiantian Profound Realm, condensing Xiantian true essence.  

Each of the three Xiantian realms was more challenging than the last.  

As Dou Changsheng rode alongside Tang He beyond the pass, he pondered Tang He’s explanation.  

Because he had obtained Xiantian inner qi, his starting point was the Xiantian realm. Though his inner qi automatically replenished, it was still Xiantian inner qi—albeit with an asterisk.  

A true Xiantian warrior cultivated the Five Qi—heart, liver, spleen, lungs, and kidneys. Each completed transformation refined the Xiantian inner qi until the Five Qi Converged, elevating it to Xiantian true qi.  

Dou Changsheng, however, first had to unblock his meridians to remove the "pseudo" label and become a genuine Xiantian warrior.  

Tang He had been exceptionally kind, answering every question without hesitation.  

Not only had he explained the three Xiantian realms, but he had also gifted Dou Changsheng a breakthrough method.  

The text detailed how to unblock the twelve primary meridians and the eight extraordinary meridians, along with taboos and other critical information. Though called a breakthrough method, it was effectively a complete Houtian martial arts manual.  

Tang He didn’t think much of it. The Tianjian Sect was a major martial arts school in Southern Chen, and such basic Houtian manuals were commonplace. Tang He had browsed countless during his travels and casually handed one to Dou Changsheng.  

Dou Changsheng couldn’t practice the inner techniques of this manual, as his qi was derived from the *Triple Origin Qi Art*. Cultivating another inner technique risked conflict. He merely studied the meridian-unblocking sections.  

Truth be told, his growing inner qi was increasingly confining him.  

Now, aside from the *Triple Origin Qi Art*, he couldn’t practice any other inner techniques—unless he discarded his abundant inner qi.  

---  

At noon, Dou Changsheng and Tang He sat beneath a tree, eating dry rations.  

Tang He took a sip of water, wiped his lips, and said, "This time, we’re splitting into two groups. Black Eagle Venerable is drawing attention, so he’ll face the greatest danger."  

"He’s only a Houtian Mastery warrior, so his pursuers will undoubtedly include Xiantian warriors."  

"After leaving Jun County, Black Eagle Venerable was supposed to hide, not rush toward Sword Gate Pass."  

"He was to buy time until we delivered the military funds and rescued him."  

"But we’ve just received word that Black Eagle Venerable didn’t follow the plan. Instead, he flaunted his presence, as if daring his enemies to find him."  

Tang He sighed. "This elder deserves respect."  

"So, Black Eagle Venerable was captured and is now a prisoner."  

"Our mission is to rescue him."  

"Such a good man deserves to live out his days in peace."  

Tang He picked up a twig and began sketching on the ground. "The biggest challenge is that Black Eagle Venerable is already imprisoned."  

"Don’t underestimate this ordinary-looking village. The Prime Minister’s men have fortified it, and many strong fighters are gathered here."  

"The most formidable is a Xiantian True Realm expert who wields Xiantian true qi. Only you, Brother Dou, can defeat him."  

"Of course, we don’t need to win outright."  

"My plan is simple: you, Brother Dou, will create a diversion, drawing the Xiantian True Realm warrior’s attention while I take advantage of the chaos to rescue Black Eagle Venerable."  

"As a mere Houtian Mastery warrior, Black Eagle Venerable won’t be heavily guarded. Our chances of success are high."  

Dou Changsheng pondered. The plan was straightforward, lacking sophistication. Most of the risk fell on him.  

*The Millennium Earth Pearl...*  

He had to have it.  

Dou Changsheng exhaled deeply. "Let’s do it."  

"But Brother Tang knows my limits. I can’t defeat a Xiantian True Realm warrior. I’ll start a fire to create a distraction and buy you time."  

"I may not be able to hold off the enemy."  

Tang He smiled. "That’s enough. The Xiantian True Realm warrior might not even be there."  

"Their main goal is seizing the military funds, not guarding prisoners."  

"It’s more likely they’re out searching. Including him in the plan is just a precaution."  

Dou Changsheng corrected him. "Be careful, Brother Tang. I have a feeling that Xiantian True Realm warrior is definitely in the village."  

What kind of cursed luck did he, Dou Changsheng, have?  

The idea of the enemy being absent and him getting an easy win was pure fantasy.  

Thankfully, it was only a Xiantian True Realm warrior. If it had been a Pure Yang Grandmaster, Dou Changsheng would have turned tail and fled—because that enemy would *definitely* be there.  

---  

Several days passed. Dou Changsheng resumed his routine of traveling by day and cultivating whenever possible, living like an ascetic.  

One afternoon, they finally neared the village. To avoid alerting the enemy, they held back and waited.  

Tang He had already disappeared, scouting for a way to infiltrate the village.  

Alone now, Dou Changsheng chewed on dry rations and realized his courage had grown.  

Before coming to Jun County, he would have abandoned such a dangerous mission outright. Yet now, he was willing to start a fire and draw the attention of a Xiantian True Realm warrior.  

Dou Changsheng laughed at himself. *Martial artists disrupt order.*  

With supernatural power at his fingertips, how could he settle for mediocrity?  

This time, he wasn’t risking his life purely to rescue Black Eagle Venerable. If his motives were divided into ten parts, saving the elder accounted for two or three, while the remaining seven or eight were for the Millennium Earth Pearl.  

As a rogue cultivator, his path would be fraught with hardship. The Millennium Earth Pearl was the stuff of legends—a poor boy’s ticket to greatness. Dou Changsheng had no intention of letting it slip away.  

*Fortune favors the bold.*  

A true man must seize opportunities when they arise.  

Steeling his resolve, Dou Changsheng prepared. His skills were lacking—even Tang He surpassed him.  

Despite his explanations, Tang He refused to believe him. Outsiders thought him formidable, but Dou Changsheng knew his limits. He wasn’t delusional enough to think he could fight a Xiantian True Realm warrior.  

This mission was about diversion, not combat. If it had been a direct fight, no treasure would have been worth the risk.  

First, he would start fires. Then, at the right moment, he would release two horses, setting their tails ablaze to send them rampaging through the village.  

This was a variation of the "Fire Oxen Formation." Simple in theory, easy in execution—but unpredictable. There was no guarantee the horses would charge forward rather than turn back. The plan was unreliable at best.  

But as long as the horses bolted, their direction didn’t matter.  

Glancing at the darkening sky, Dou Changsheng decided the time was right. He rigged a small mechanism—in about fifteen minutes, the horses would catch fire.  

Those fifteen minutes were his window to set the village ablaze.  

Creeping toward the village under cover of night, Dou Changsheng noted its eerie silence. It was a deserted settlement, one of many in the war-torn north. Years of conflict had displaced countless people.  

Some villages dwindled until survivors merged with others, leaving their homes abandoned.  

Dou Changsheng didn’t venture too deep. Stopping at a thatched hut, he ignited it and quickly retreated to light another.  

By the time he set the third fire, warriors had noticed the flames and rushed over.  

Dou Changsheng abandoned further arson and hid. Soon, a frenzied horse charged into the village. He sighed—one of the two horses had bolted in the wrong direction. Still, he counted it a success. Given his usual luck, he’d expected both to flee elsewhere.  

The horses were just for chaos, not major impact.  

Ordinary people would struggle against panicked horses, but warriors like Wang Xiong could subdue them single-handedly.  

The burning horse had only trampled one hut before a warrior leaped into the air, his blade flashing silver.  

The strike cleaved the night, leaving a white arc in its wake.  

Blood sprayed as the horse’s head soared skyward, tumbling to the ground.  

The warrior landed, silver hair fluttering—it was Ai Haike.  

A shadowy figure descended from above. Feng Zhongyi glanced at the horse carcass, then froze.  

"I recognize this," he said gravely. "It’s Dou Changsheng’s horse."  

"Dou Changsheng started the fire. He’s here to rescue Black Eagle Venerable."  

Ai Haike shook his head. "I came to bid farewell."  

"I’ve chosen to return home and leave worldly affairs behind."  

"Tonight’s events are none of my concern. I won’t take sides."  

"Farewell."  

Sheathing his blade, Ai Haike strode out of the village. Feng Zhongyi watched him go, eyes glinting.  

To save his own skin, he had exaggerated Dou Changsheng’s strength.  

If Dou Changsheng truly faced Long Ying now, he’d be no match. Long Ying was a Five Qi Mastery warrior, already condensing Three Flowers.  

Should Dou Changsheng’s true abilities be exposed, the Prime Minister would never spare Feng Zhongyi.  

He had no intention of dying.  

Turning, Feng Zhongyi sprinted toward the village center, altering his voice as he shouted, "Disaster!"  

"The Grand Secretariat has sent a Grandmaster to rescue the prisoner!"  

This ragtag group would hesitate at the mention of a Grandmaster—Feng Zhongyi knew them well.  

Bursting into a courtyard, he found Long Ying seated calmly beside the prison.  

"Sir, you must leave!" Feng Zhongyi urged. "Someone just claimed a Grandmaster is coming. I didn’t believe it at first, but Ai Haike suddenly withdrew."  

"That’s suspicious—I think he knew all along."  

"Rumors say the Pure Yin Grandmaster, peer to the Pure Yang Grandmaster, can possess bodies from a hundred miles away."  

"Ai Haike’s family is loyal. The northern Grandmaster wouldn’t harm him, but if we stay, we’re doomed."  

"This prison holds only minor figures. No one important."  

"Sir, retreat strategically. Securing the military funds is paramount!"  

If they fled, even a false alarm would become real.
