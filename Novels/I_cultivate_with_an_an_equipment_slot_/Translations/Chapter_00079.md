# Chapter 79: Fourth-Grade Spirit Vein, Grandmaster Uncle?

"You!"  

Lei Wanbao stared blankly at Zhang Yan, suddenly feeling as though the world bore him an immense grudge.  

Zhang Yan's performance was simply too outrageous.  

Brother, I know you're a genius.  

But you're just a Qi Refining cultivator, alright?!  

I'm a Foundation Establishment cultivator!  

Do you even understand what Foundation Establishment means?!  

Even if I suppressed my cultivation to match yours, with all my experience, Lei Wanbao should have utterly crushed Zhang Yan.  

Yet, when the two collided, it was Lei Wanbao who shattered.  

Just like that—snap!—so fast.  

Completely obliterated.  

"Is this the world of geniuses?" Lei Wanbao took a deep breath. He had always thought that so-called geniuses were merely those who cultivated a bit faster.  

No big deal.  

In an actual fight, with all his magical artifacts, he, Lei Wanbao, would surely be unbeatable.  

But now, reality had delivered a harsh lesson.  

Geniuses didn't even need exceptional artifacts to send him scrambling.  

Enough said.  

This was heartbreaking!  

Watching Lei Wanbao leave, Zhang Yan secretly clicked his tongue.  

This guy seemed like a clown, yet he was so formidable!  

His Golden Bamboo Sword was enhanced with Lv2 Sharpness, along with several Lv1 Sharpness attributes.  

Not to mention armor-piercing and immense strength modifiers.  

The sheer power was unimaginable.  

Yet, even such an attack had only barely broken through Lei Wanbao's defenses.  

His artifact had even been caught barehanded.  

"As expected, Foundation Establishment is Foundation Establishment," Zhang Yan sighed, feeling a surge of longing.  

Though Lei Wanbao had caused quite a stir, after dealing with him, Zhang Yan's ascent up the mountain proceeded smoothly.  

No one else dared challenge him.  

What a joke.  

Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator had been defeated—why would mere Qi Refining cultivators humiliate themselves?  

The journey was uneventful.  

Zhang Yan arrived at the main hall of the Qingheng Sect.  

Inside, seated figures like Mo Changqing and Zhuge Wan—Golden Core elders—greeted him with warm smiles.  

They had initially thought Zhang Yan was merely a production-type talent.  

Little did they know he was also a formidable combatant.  

A true all-rounder.  

This was an unexpected delight.  

"Disciple Zhang Yan pays his respects to the Sect Master and esteemed elders."  

Zhang Yan entered the hall and bowed deeply.  

"Excellent. Today, Qingheng Sect disciple Zhang Yan, having endured trials and attained enlightenment, is hereby promoted to True Disciple!"  

Mo Changqing rose from his seat and approached Zhang Yan, gently tapping his forehead.  

A flash of spiritual light appeared.  

A new Daoist robe materialized—still cyan, but now adorned with gilded purple trim, exuding an air of luxury.  

Of course, this robe wasn't just for show.  

It was a magical garment with self-cleaning properties, along with spirit-gathering, defense, fire resistance, water resistance, and wind-stabilizing effects.  

This single robe was worth a fortune.  

Additionally, Zhang Yan's jade token was replaced with a spiritual artifact forged by Lei Kunhai.  

Yes, the identity token of a True Disciple was a spiritual artifact.  

Its function was simple:  

Beyond basic features, the defensive capabilities were removed.  

Instead, it now had a teleportation function—crushing the token would instantly transport the user randomly within a hundred miles.  

A true life-saving treasure.  

"Many thanks, Sect Master!" Zhang Yan hurriedly expressed his gratitude.  

"This is what you deserve," Mo Changqing replied warmly.  

Truly, his future direct disciple was exceptional in both talent and ability!  

---  

After receiving the robe and token, and having his name inscribed in the Qingheng Sect's registry, Zhang Yan officially became a True Disciple.  

With this came numerous privileges.  

First and foremost: Zhang Yan no longer needed to worry about sect missions.  

Previously, whether as an outer or inner disciple, he had been required to complete tasks for the sect.  

But True Disciples were different.  

Their only mission was to cultivate diligently.  

Twenty years for Qi Refining, seventy years for Foundation Establishment.  

If Zhang Yan failed to reach Foundation Establishment within twenty years, he would lose his True Disciple status.  

Similarly, failing to reach Golden Core within seventy years after Foundation Establishment would strip him of his position.  

"It seems this True Disciple title isn't easy to maintain," Zhang Yan mused.  

---  

Zhang Yan made only a brief appearance at the celebration banquet before returning to his cave to cultivate.  

The elders understood his reluctance to seek the limelight.  

---  

One day, Zhuge Wan and Mo Changqing summoned Zhang Yan.  

"The Taiyi Sect's secret realm won't open for some time. As a True Disciple of Qingheng Sect, you must now join the others in cultivation," Mo Changqing said solemnly.  

"Join them?  

Who exactly?" Zhang Yan asked, puzzled.  

"Come with me. You must be curious why, after all this time in Qingheng Sect, you've never seen the other True Disciples."  

"Indeed. They always seemed so elusive," Zhang Yan admitted.  

"The reason is simple—they aren't in Qingheng Sect.  

Let’s go. I’ll take you to meet them."  

Mo Changqing flicked his sleeve, summoning a sword beam.  

"Focus on your cultivation there. But given your age, don’t rush into Foundation Establishment. Master as many techniques to perfection as possible before breaking through," Zhuge Wan advised earnestly.  

"Understood, Master."  

After bidding farewell, Mo Changqing whisked Zhang Yan away from Qingheng Sect.  

High above the clouds, Zhang Yan stood on the flying sword behind Mo Changqing, struck by a sudden thought.  

Mo Changqing was a Golden Core cultivator, yet his sword control lacked the finesse of Mu Sen’s.  

Fast, yes—but missing a certain fluidity.  

Of course, Zhang Yan kept this observation to himself.  

As Qingheng Sect vanished into the distance, Zhang Yan felt an inexplicable emptiness.  

He noted their direction.  

Contrary to his expectations, Mo Changqing wasn’t heading deeper into Zhou Kingdom.  

Instead, they ventured into the Tianmu Mountain Range—far into its depths.  

"Our True Disciples are in Tianmu Mountains?" Zhang Yan asked, surprised.  

"Of course," Mo Changqing nodded. "For generations, Qingheng Sect has sought to fully develop Tianmu Mountains.  

How can True Disciples lead the sect’s expansion if they don’t understand these lands?"  

"I see."  

Zhang Yan wisely fell silent.  

For Qingheng Sect, Tianmu Mountains were both a foundation and a sorrowful tale—countless cultivators had perished in its untamed wilderness.  

Golden Core flight was swift, yet the journey took an entire day.  

The surroundings shifted from bustling to desolate, eventually becoming utterly uninhabited.  

They had reached the heart of Tianmu Mountains.  

"From now until the Taiyi Sect’s secret realm opens, you’ll train here," Mo Changqing announced mid-air.  

"Here?  

It seems... perilous." Zhang Yan’s face twitched.  

During the journey, he had sensed countless demonic beasts—Qi Refining late-stage were mere underlings.  

Qi Refining perfection and Foundation Establishment were the norm.  

At times, he had even detected presences that filled him with dread—likely Golden Core demonic beasts.  

That Qingheng Sect’s True Disciples trained in such a place was beyond most people’s imagination.  

"Enough talk. Let’s meet your senior brothers."  

Mo Changqing descended toward a mountain peak.  

Midway, they encountered a translucent barrier—a formation.  

Unfazed, Mo Changqing produced a token and guided Zhang Yan through.  

Inside, Zhang Yan’s first thought was: The spiritual energy here is incredibly dense!  

Far richer than even Wood Spirit Peak or Qingheng Peak.  

A single breath made him feel lightheaded.  

"Notice it?  

The reason our True Disciples train here is simple—this place sits atop a fourth-grade spirit vein!"  

Mo Changqing’s eyes burned with fervor.  

"Fourth-grade?!"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes widened.  

Fourth-grade spirit veins could sustain Nascent Soul cultivators!  

To his knowledge, aside from the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace, no faction in Zhao Kingdom possessed one.  

A terrifying realization struck him.  

Though deep in Tianmu Mountains, this was still the periphery.  

If the outskirts had a fourth-grade vein, did the heartland hold a fifth-grade?  

Claiming that would propel Qingheng Sect to unimaginable heights!  

"Don’t get ahead of yourself."  

Mo Changqing recognized Zhang Yan’s thoughts—he’d had the same dream in his youth.  

But the reality was harsh.  

Every spirit vein was guarded by demonic beasts.  

To seize one meant exterminating all its inhabitants—a near-impossible feat.  

This fourth-grade vein was a fluke.  

Normally, such veins housed fourth-grade demonic beasts.  

But when Qingheng’s ancestors arrived, the beast had perished, leaving only two Golden Core late-stage guardians.  

After an arduous battle, the ancestors secured this mountain and sealed it with formations.  

Only token bearers could enter.  

As they landed, sword beams approached.  

A group led by a man in his thirties—a Foundation Establishment cultivator—greeted them.  

The rest varied in age but were all Foundation Establishment.  

"Greetings, Sect Master!" they chorused, delighted.  

"Good, good. Your cultivation has progressed.  

When will you attempt Golden Core?" Mo Changqing asked warmly.  

These were the sect’s future!  

"Thirty more years, at best," the leader replied confidently.  

"Thirty years... Time is of the essence. The sect’s expansion is imminent.  

Achieving Golden Core beforehand would be ideal."  

"We’ll strive our utmost!"  

The disciples grew solemn.  

"Golden Core can’t be rushed. Proceed at your own pace."  

Though eager for more Golden Core experts, Mo Changqing knew haste bred failure.  

He turned to Zhang Yan.  

"This is your new junior brother, Zhang Yan. Take good care of him."  

"Greetings, senior brothers and sisters."  

Zhang Yan bowed politely.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Yan...  

Only Qi Refining?"  

The group was stunned. They had all reached Foundation Establishment before becoming True Disciples.  

Yet Zhang Yan was merely Qi Refining!  

"Indeed. First, take him to meet Grandmaster Uncle. Explanations can wait."  

Straightening his robes, Mo Changqing led Zhang Yan to a thatched hut.
