# Chapter 50: Seven Stabilizes Heaven and Earth, Ultimate Art Reaches Perfection! The Ice Cube's Request

“Let’s try using the Heavenly Book Seal first.”

Li Mo took out the Heavenly Book Seal and stamped it.

There was no reaction.

The small characters on it showed no signs of flowing inward.

Clearly, the Heavenly Book Seal could not perfect incomplete martial arts manuals.

“Maybe I should try learning the first eight forms first?”

Li Mo felt a bit of a toothache.

If he had a choice, he wouldn’t want to learn an incomplete manual either.

If there was really no other way, he would have to wait until he went down the mountain to do sect tasks and check the trading firms. It would be best if he could buy a suitable martial art with money; if there wasn’t one available for the time being, he could pay a heavy price to have the trading firm help him find one.

For Li Mo, matters that could be solved with money were currently not an issue at all.

Half an hour later.

He had already memorized the general outline of the "Twelve Hammers of Calming the Waves" by heart.

Although he was somewhat reluctant to admit it.

He seemed to learn hammer techniques much faster than sword techniques.

“Incomplete manuals... should be able to accept the infusion of martial arts insights.”

Li Mo gave it a shallow try.

【One year of insight infused successfully.】

【In the first year, due to your astonishing talent for hammer techniques, even though the acquired martial art was incomplete, you persisted in practicing it. You reached entry level in one month, basic proficiency in three months, and minor success in six months.】

【Right at the one-year mark, a flash of inspiration struck, and you actually broke through to great success!】

Li Mo: “.......?”

Wait, bro.

Great success in one year, practicing an incomplete martial art... is that really me?

Unfamiliar, too unfamiliar.

The good news is, he finally discovered a talent other than being handsome.

The bad news is, this talent...

“Turns out interest and talent are two different things.”

“Swords, spears, sabers, halberds—I can do them all, so why is it a hammer?”

Li Mo’s feelings were complicated.

Could he actually reach perfection with this incomplete manual?

【Five years of martial arts insight infused successfully.】

【In the first year, you practiced the "Twelve Hammers of Calming the Waves" to perfection, but because there was no subsequent chapter, you hit a bottleneck, stuck at the perfection realm and unable to make any progress.】

【In the second year, you began to meditate deeply, contemplating the true meaning of this hammer technique, and attempting to find the missing parts.】

【In the third year, the originally cut-off path forward was actually found by you. By feeling the stones to cross the river, you created the ninth and tenth forms.】

【In the fourth year, this hammer technique in your heart was merely a puzzle missing a corner. You easily and naturally created the eleventh and twelfth forms, successfully obtaining the complete "Twelve Hammers of Calming the Waves." Compared to the original version, it seemed to be a case of the student surpassing the master.】

【In the fifth year, your "Twelve Hammers of Calming the Waves" stepped into the realm of perfection.】

“.....”

Li Mo supported his forehead, doubting his life.

One reason was that countless insights into hammer techniques were surging through his mind.

The second reason... his talent in this aspect seemed to be even better than he had imagined!

Five years!

An incomplete martial art!

He had actually forcefully perfected it and practiced it to perfection!

Compared to the snail-like speed of learning sword techniques, it was like riding a rocket.

“Is it because I was originally good with the hammer?”

“Or is it because I became the master of the Panjie Meteor Hammer, and my talent in this aspect was enhanced?”

Divine weapons seemed to be more than just powerful.

Sensing the Panjie Meteor Hammer within the World Seed, Li Mo didn't delve deeper for now.

He couldn't even take the divine weapon out to use it yet, so thinking too much was meaningless.

“Let's perfect the 'Twelve Hammers of Calming the Waves' first.”

Li Mo walked to a relatively flat bluestone.

He spread out paper on it and started writing swiftly.

Before long, the complete superior martial art appeared on the paper.

He took out the Bronze Heavenly Book Seal and stamped it. The tadpole-sized characters immediately rushed in, quickly arranging and combining the characters.

Finally, even the name of the martial art changed:

"Seven Stabilizes Heaven and Earth."

A brand new ultimate art was born.

"Seven Stabilizes Heaven and Earth" could be said to be a super-upgraded version of the "Twelve Hammers of Calming the Waves." The former, without changing the latter's essence, interpreted the word 'slowness' to the extreme.

It emphasized using slowness to attack speed, and lifting heavy objects as if they were light.

When practiced to perfection, a seemingly light strike could unleash terrifying power.

Splitting mountains, cracking seas, and blocking rivers were all within its capabilities.

Needless to say.

Martial arts insight, activate!

...

At the same time.

---

Main Peak of Qingyuan.

After a series of tests, the elders discussed.

At the Blood Qi Realm, she could already use the radiance to perfectly execute a perfected superior sword art.

Her body, tempered by the Yin Qi once a day, had a terrifying physical strength, truly possessing ice muscles and jade bones.

Her intent soul, for some reason, was also extraordinary.

“Little Bing'er's combat power is definitely not below that of the Internal Fluid Jade Liquid Realm.”

“If her bloodline wasn't so pure, I would suspect she is the transformation of some extremely powerful auspicious beast descendant.”

“Indeed, born with twenty-four meridians, and her Blood Qi Realm has only reached about halfway...”

The few elders had lived for over half a lifetime.

Today, they felt their vocabulary was exhausted; the storm in their hearts had never ceased.

However.

They didn't know that this wasn't all of Ying Bing.

She still had a trace of Yin Qi that she could use.

She also had the incredibly mysterious Radiant Soul.

And that peerless, ancient and modern battle talent.

As well as the experience and vision of the Empress of the Phoenix Heaven.

The elders didn't detect it, and Ying Bing had no intention of mentioning it.

She revealed her abilities today not to show off in front of others; she didn't care about others' opinions.

“I want to go down the mountain to Ziyang Prefecture City.”

Ying Bing held her sword and said softly.

Her cold voice fell, and the elders fell silent for a moment.

“Can you tell me what you are going down the mountain for?” Elder Shangguan Wencang asked.

“Sect task.”

“There are tasks that can be completed within the sect, and you don't lack contribution points for rewards.”

“There must be other matters to attend to, right?”

The elders followed up with questions.

Although Ying Bing hadn't been practicing martial arts for long, her strength was sufficient.

Comparable to the Internal Fluid Realm, going to Ziyang Prefecture City indeed wouldn't easily lead to accidents.

But just in case!

Ying Bing remained silent, tacitly acknowledging it.

Xue Jing thought for a moment and smiled:

“If it's a big matter, why not discuss it with us? We have at least eaten half a lifetime more of rice and have some say in Ziyang Prefecture.”

“If it's a small matter, why not entrust it to a trustworthy person by your side? It would save unnecessary trouble.”

“I don't have...”

Ying Bing's red lips parted slightly, about to say she didn't have anyone trustworthy, nor anyone by her side.

However, a sunny youth inexplicably flashed through her mind.

He... should be considered a trustworthy person, right?

After a moment of contemplation, Ying Bing nodded:

“Alright, I understand.”

...

On the other side.

“Achoo!”

Little Li, who was returning to Autumn Water Pavilion from the waterfall, sneezed.

Strange.

With his physique now, crushing bluestone was like crushing a soft persimmon, could he still catch a cold?

Hmm...

He still needed to train more.

Unfortunately, facing the Panjie Meteor Hammer inside the World Seed, he couldn't temper his physique, nor could he take it out.

Body tempering had to be put on hold for now.

“'Seven Stabilizes Heaven and Earth' actually reached perfection in just twenty years.”

“Unfortunately, this hammer technique wasn't created for someone at the Blood Qi Realm to use.”

“I can only perfectly use the First Stabilize right now.”

Li Mo muttered to himself, calculating the power of a hammer strike.

Anyway... it should be enough to crush an Internal Fluid Realm practitioner, right?

What was awkward was.

Right now, aside from a divine weapon that looked good but couldn't be used, he really couldn't find a suitable hammer.

*Patter—*

He had just stepped into Autumn Water Pavilion.

Right behind him, the Sect Master's carriage arrived at the door.

After the Ice Cube stepped down, her gaze fixed on him.

“What's the matter?”

“I want to ask you for a favor.”
