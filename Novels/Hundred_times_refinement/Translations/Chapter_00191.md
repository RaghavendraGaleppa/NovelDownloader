# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb - Chapter 139: Thousand Illusions Transformation (Seeking Recommendation Votes)

A shrill scream pierced the air!

It came from a Foundation Establishment cultivator who had been watching nearby, now caught in the crossfire.

Seeing the blood blossom in the air, a cold glint flashed in Lin Xuan's eyes. Since the opponent had struck with such ruthlessness, there was no need for him to hold back either!

The onlookers scattered in panic, leaving only a few high-level cultivators who activated their protective barriers to observe from a distance.

Lin Xuan's expression grew even colder. He opened his mouth and spat out two streaks of red light.

The red light was extraordinarily sentient, immediately engaging in fierce combat with the incoming dark green radiance.

Almost as soon as the battle began, the magical artifact released by the demonic cultivator was at a disadvantage, being violently knocked away.

It was a flying sword with serrated edges.

"Hmph, a mid-grade spiritual artifact!"

Seeing this, Lin Xuan felt even more at ease. If this were a sect-affiliated demonic cultivator, they would never have only a mid-grade spiritual artifact by the time they reached mid Foundation Establishment.

He pointed a finger, and the red light returned to him. As the radiance dispersed, it revealed a pair of ancient-style hook swords.

These had been obtained from the Fire Spirit Sect leader and were even more powerful than the Jade Snow Rings.

During his recent seclusion, Lin Xuan had finally refined them, making them fully his own.

Yuan Song's eyes filled with terror. After all, it was rare for anyone below late Foundation Establishment to possess a top-grade spiritual artifact.

But Lin Xuan defied conventional wisdom. If Yuan Song knew this was just one of several top-grade spiritual artifacts Lin Xuan owned, his shock would have been immeasurable.

Lin Xuan had no intention of prolonging the fight.

Although he was the young master of the Spirit Medicine Mountain, this was still demonic cultivator territory. The longer they stayed, the greater the risk.

With this in mind, Lin Xuan formed sword seals with both hands, shaping them into a sphere before pointing at the hook swords before him.

Spiritual energy was injected from a distance!

A dazzling red light erupted, accompanied by a faint dragon's roar.

"Transform!"

With Lin Xuan's shout, the red light coalesced into a massive dragon, dozens of feet long, with twin horns and flames spewing from its maw.

"Transformation Art!"

Yuan Song's face paled with disbelief. Even the hidden onlookers were struck dumb with shock.

It was common knowledge that the Transformation Art involved using spiritual energy to shape a magical artifact into the form of a divine beast, granting it a portion of that beast's power.

Examples included the Bifang and the Evil Dragon summoned by Ouyang Qinxin during her battle with the Dwarf Sage.

However, this technique required a Golden Core to perform, meaning cultivators below the Core Formation stage were incapable of it.

Could this young man actually be a Core Formation expert, disguising himself to deceive others?

This thought sent chills down Yuan Song's spine, drenching his back in cold sweat. But now, regret was useless.

Lin Xuan was not the Core Formation expert everyone imagined. What he used wasn't the Transformation Art but a technique called "Thousand Illusions Transformation."

This was one of the secret arts recorded in the Nine Heavens Profound Technique, resembling the Transformation Art but requiring only Foundation Establishment-level cultivation to perform.

It also transformed spiritual artifacts into divine beast forms, but unlike the Transformation Art, it merely mimicked their appearance without inheriting their abilities.

Even so, it surpassed the original power of the spiritual artifact itself.

Seeing his opponent's fear, Lin Xuan remained unmoved. Mercy toward enemies was cruelty to oneself—in the cultivation world, the kind-hearted did not survive.

A hint of killing intent surfaced on Lin Xuan's face.

Without hesitation, he urged the fire dragon forward.

Roar!

With a terrifying roar and waves of scorching heat, the dragon lunged at its prey. Yuan Song, drenched in sweat, refused to surrender without a fight and desperately threw out several mid-grade defensive talismans.

But it was futile. The barriers created by the talismans burst like bubbles.

Amidst agonized screams, Yuan Song was engulfed by the dragon.

Lin Xuan showed no relief. Instead, he formed hand seals, commanding the dragon to continue its assault, refining its victim into ashes with searing flames until even his soul was obliterated.

"Destroy the weeds, root and all"—Lin Xuan had never been merciful to his enemies.

With a sharp sound, the fire dragon reverted to its hook sword form and returned to Lin Xuan's hand. He swept a cold gaze over the surrounding cultivators, none of whom dared meet his eyes. Some turned away, while others simply fled.

A faint smile tugged at Lin Xuan's lips as a surge of triumph welled within him.

Xu Yin watched with undisguised admiration. To effortlessly annihilate a mid Foundation Establishment demonic cultivator—even her elder brother could do no better.

He was also at mid Foundation Establishment—how had he accomplished this?

Countless questions swirled in the young girl's mind.

Meanwhile, in a corner not far away, two elders—one in green, the other in white—exchanged glances, their eyes glinting with intrigue.

"Brother Chen, what do you make of this young man?" asked the green-robed elder, his tone icy.

"Brother Zhang, if you can't tell, how would I know?" retorted the white-robed elder, his gaze fixed on Lin Xuan. "But the technique he used is extraordinary. At first glance, it truly resembles the Transformation Art of Core Formation cultivators."

"Shall we capture him? There might be unexpected gains."

"No," the Chen elder shook his head. "His robes bear the aura of the Heavenly Fiend Sect. For a cultivator to receive such treatment here, his backing must be formidable. We cannot act recklessly until we know more."

"But—" The Zhang elder seemed unwilling to let it go.

"Patience. The potential gains are mere speculation. This is a critical moment—do you want to ruin the sect master's plans?"

Hearing this stern warning, the Zhang elder's expression shifted several times before he finally sighed in reluctant agreement.

Lin Xuan's exhilaration faded quickly. Surveying his surroundings, he knew it was time to leave. He turned to Xu Yin. "Let's go!"

But as soon as he spoke, his expression darkened. Three surges of spiritual energy were rapidly approaching.

Minutes later, three black-robed demonic cultivators surrounded Lin Xuan in a triangular formation.
