# Chapter 157: Returning to Old Ways, Furthering the Technique...

"Whoosh!"

Over a calm and undisturbed stretch of sea, a handsome young man soared swiftly on a blue streak of light. His speed was not particularly fast—in fact, it was somewhat sluggish. The aura emanating from the streak was also weak, as if he had only recently broken through to the Foundation Establishment stage.

The young man's face bore a trace of anxiety as he continuously urged the streak forward, speeding toward the distance.

The sea grew increasingly vast, and in the far distance, a lush green island covered in dense forests became faintly visible. A hint of joy flickered across the young man's face.

"Swish!"

But at that moment, a concealed streak of light suddenly shot toward him from behind. From within the streak, a colorful jade handkerchief unfurled, expanding to several dozen feet in size like a massive net. Laden with dense spiritual light, it wrapped around the young man.

"Fall!"

Not only that, but from beneath the sea, a shadow abruptly leaped out. In its hand was a gleaming emerald dagger, its tip shimmering with a green glow. The dagger carried a strong murderous aura as it struck toward the young man.

The two attacks were flawlessly coordinated. The young man seemed stunned, standing motionless on the sea's surface.

"Hahaha, kid, you're too naive! Did you really think covering your face with a cloth could hide your aura?"

"An ordinary man's wealth is his own ruin. Hand over the demon core, and I might spare your life!"

The shadow that had leaped from the sea, sensing victory within grasp, couldn't help but burst into wild laughter.

"Clang!"

But at that moment, a dazzling sword light suddenly erupted. Moreover, the sword light split—one into two, two into three, three into sixteen—instantly multiplying into sixteen streaks of sword light.

The sword light was brilliant, swift as wind and thunder. In a single clash, it sent the dagger flying. The dagger let out a mournful cry, its spiritual light dimming as if severely damaged.

"No, how is this possible?!"

The shadow exclaimed in disbelief. But the sixteen streaks of sword light merely twisted in the air like sixteen swimming dragons, turning in unison to slash at the shadow's head.

The shadow's face paled in terror as it frantically summoned its spiritual artifacts and seals. But the sword light flashed like blinding sunlight, and a head tumbled to the ground.

"You're a sword cultivator?!"

The sudden reversal was too abrupt to comprehend. The figure who had circled behind Gu Yuan gasped in shock—a beautiful, voluptuous woman.

Staring at the severed head still frozen in terror, the woman wasted no time. While controlling the colorful handkerchief to entangle the young man, she activated her escape technique, desperate to flee.

But before the young man, a delicate jade pagoda had already materialized. With a mere tremble from the pagoda, the handkerchief froze mid-air.

Beneath the pagoda, the spirit of a golden-eyed, green-haired ape opened its eyes.

"Boom!"

A scorching will descended like the sun. The woman, who had just begun her escape, stiffened momentarily, blood seeping from her eyes. The sword light swirled once more, piercing a hole through her forehead with a single twist. She collapsed, lifeless.

A "robber-cultivator drama" had come to an abrupt and dramatic end.

"This should be enough..."

The young man gazed at the two corpses and sighed softly. He then tossed two fireballs, reducing the bodies to ashes. After weighing their storage pouches in his hand, he activated his escape light and departed.

The young man was none other than Gu Yuan.

Two months prior, after purchasing two technique seals at the Thousand Techniques Hall, his funds had begun to dwindle. Yet, the materials required for refining technique seals, purchasing the Daoist Statue of Law Manifestation, and crafting technique pills all demanded spirit stones.

Left with no choice, he had returned to his old profession.

His "old profession" wasn't robbery—it was preying on robbers, turning the tables on those who sought to plunder others.

Becoming an outright robber was a line Gu Yuan couldn't cross, but "robbing the robbers" carried no moral burden.

With his experience, concealing his aura and leaving a few deliberate openings easily lured in several would-be assailants.

However, the roles of hunter and prey always reversed at the critical moment.

Over the past two months, thanks to Gu Yuan's careful planning, four waves of robbers had fallen at his hands.

Today's pair, the so-called "Twin Fiends," were the fourth.

Knowing that excess invites disaster, Gu Yuan clearly remembered the warning from the "Robber's Manual." Regardless of whether his resources were sufficient, this pair would be his final targets.

Fortunately, though the couple's skills were mediocre, their possessions were decent. Combined with the spoils from the previous three groups, Gu Yuan had gathered enough resources.

White Flame City, Exquisite Pavilion.

A thin but sharp-eyed old man in a blue brocade robe smiled as he handed Gu Yuan a storage pouch.

"Fellow Daoist, the two Daoist Statues of Law Manifestation and all the required materials are inside. You may verify them."

Gu Yuan extended his spiritual power to take the pouch, but the old man pressed down on it.

"These two statues were hard to come by—I had to procure them from the black market. Naturally, the price has increased slightly. This was part of our agreement. Have you brought enough spirit stones?"

The old man smiled as he asked.

Gu Yuan's expression remained unchanged as he tossed over another storage pouch.

Had he not been teleported to this remote place by the Emerald Water Fiery-Eyed Ape, he wouldn't have had to endure such treatment. The Sword Fox Sage would have long since bestowed upon him miraculous pills to resolve the issue with the golden book.

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly, but the path of cultivation was always fraught with obstacles. He had learned to accept such setbacks calmly.

"Fellow Daoist is most generous!"

The old man scanned the pouch with his spiritual sense, his smile widening before he released his grip.

Gu Yuan inspected the contents of the pouch and nodded slightly.

Though the Exquisite Pavilion was somewhat unscrupulous in its pricing, its methods were indeed impressive. Operating in both the open and underground markets of White Flame City, it had procured all the required materials without fail, each item meeting the required standards.

"Safe travels, Fellow Daoist!"

After a brief exchange of pleasantries, the old man escorted Gu Yuan out.

Without lingering, Gu Yuan took the pouch and rented a high-grade cultivation chamber in White Flame City before going into seclusion.

One month later, Gu Yuan exhaled deeply as he examined two radiant technique seals in his palm.

"Both the Moonheart Seal and the Evil-Containing Seal have been successfully refined. Now, it's time to further the technique. I hope it won't disappoint me..."

After half a day of calming his mind and regulating his breath, Gu Yuan flicked his sleeve, summoning a one-foot-tall stone statue of a Daoist, which landed on the ground.

"Drip!"

A drop of Gu Yuan's blood fell onto the statue, causing it to tremble and transform into a one-foot-tall human figure. Gu Yuan then channeled his spiritual power into the statue.

The statue grew with the wind, matching Gu Yuan's height, its features identical to his own.

Moreover, within its dantian, three Dao Foundations and various dazzling technique seals appeared.

"Demonic beings devour the sun and moon, refining the mysteries of the cosmos..."

"Two methods combined, a pill forms within the belly..."

Gu Yuan murmured incantations, each word infused with profound meaning. The statue's eyes gleamed with divine light, stirring the unseen spiritual forces. A radiant technique pill materialized within its dantian, growing from nothingness.
