# Chapter 12: Special Constitution

Watching Yao Shifeng's retreating figure, the crowd dispersed to make their final preparations. With only a few months left before reaching the Qi Refining stage, none of them wanted to fall behind.

Among the hundreds of newly recruited outer sect disciples, those who advanced to Qi Refining earlier would have the privilege of joining better mountain peaks. Among the four, apart from Gu Mo, Hu Hai, Wu Jinfei, and Chu Feifei had all chosen the most prestigious peaks—peaks where competition was fierce.

"Gu Mo!"

Just as Gu Mo was about to leave, Chu Feifei called out to him.

"Is there something you're confused about with the Cleansing Technique?" Gu Mo asked. The only reason Chu Feifei would stop him was likely related to the technique.

But this time, Chu Feifei shook her head. She had already grasped the basics of the Cleansing Technique, and Gu Mo had previously explained many details to her—details she hadn't fully digested yet. This time, she had stopped him to test an idea that had been on her mind.

"Um, Gu Mo, could you come to my room?" Chu Feifei took a deep breath and asked.

"What?"

The sudden invitation caught Gu Mo off guard.

"Don't misunderstand! I just need your help with something," Chu Feifei quickly clarified, realizing how her words might have sounded.

"Alright."

Gu Mo nodded, curious about what she needed help with that required such secrecy.

The living quarters for outer sect disciples were all in the same area, so it only took about ten minutes for Gu Mo to reach Chu Feifei's small hut.

On the way, Chu Feifei explained the reason for her request. It all came back to the Cleansing Technique. Every time she used it, her cultivation speed would increase slightly. However, the boost was minimal, and she wasn't sure if that was the limit or if it was because her mastery of the technique was still low. To test this, she would either need to improve her proficiency in the Cleansing Technique or seek help from someone who had already mastered it.

Unsurprisingly, Chu Feifei chose the latter. With all her time devoted to cultivation, she couldn't afford to divert her focus to mastering the Cleansing Technique. And Gu Mo was the only person she knew who had both practiced the technique and surpassed her in skill.

"I see."

After understanding the situation, Gu Mo nodded. He was also curious about how Chu Feifei's cultivation speed increased when she used the Cleansing Technique.

"Let's begin."

Once inside, Chu Feifei closed the doors and windows, took a deep breath, and nodded at Gu Mo.

Without hesitation, Gu Mo cast a Grandmaster-level Cleansing Technique. As for the Perfect-level Cleansing Technique, that was one of his trump cards—not something he would use lightly. Moreover, using the Perfect-level technique on others came with certain restrictions.

As the rippling spiritual energy of the Cleansing Technique settled over Chu Feifei, she suddenly seemed to transform, like a flower washed clean by rain, exuding an otherworldly fragrance.

"This is…"

Within moments, the strange yet pleasant scent filled the entire room. Gu Mo inhaled deeply, feeling his mind clear instantly.

Chu Feifei was equally shocked by the change. Compared to her own rudimentary Cleansing Technique, the effects of Gu Mo's Grandmaster-level technique were astonishingly powerful.

"This must be some kind of special constitution," Gu Mo murmured, staring at Chu Feifei, who now resembled an immortal fairy who had transcended the mortal world.

"My cultivation speed has increased fivefold!" Chu Feifei exclaimed after sensing the changes within herself. A fivefold increase was equivalent to possessing a mid-grade spiritual root—a rare and coveted talent.

This opportunity was even greater than Fan Shaoming's acquisition of a magical artifact. While Fan Shaoming had merely obtained an external tool, Chu Feifei's special constitution was something that would stay with her forever.

If she revealed this now, sect elders would undoubtedly take her in as an inner disciple. But remembering Fan Shaoming's example, Chu Feifei hesitated.

"Gu Mo, can you keep this a secret?" she pleaded, her eyes filled with urgency. Unlike Fan Shaoming's artifact, her constitution couldn't be stolen—but she could be kidnapped. Without a direct way to present herself to a sect elder, exposing her secret now would only invite danger.

"Of course."

Gu Mo nodded.

Just then, the enchanting fragrance in the room began to fade rapidly, and Chu Feifei's transcendent aura dissipated, leaving her looking like an ordinary mortal again.

"What…?"

The sudden reversal left both of them stunned.

"It's gone!" Chu Feifei said, her voice tinged with disappointment. The fivefold boost in cultivation speed had vanished as quickly as it had appeared.

Curious, Gu Mo cast another Grandmaster-level Cleansing Technique. Once again, the fragrance returned, and Chu Feifei felt her cultivation speed surge.

Now, Gu Mo understood. Chu Feifei's constitution was like a flower buried under dust—the Cleansing Technique swept away the grime, allowing her innate brilliance to shine. But the dust would eventually settle back, obscuring her radiance once more.

After realizing this, Chu Feifei knew the Cleansing Technique would become an essential part of her cultivation. However, her progress in the technique was slow, and reaching Gu Mo's level would take years. Having practiced the technique herself, she could clearly sense the vast difference between her skill and his.

She suspected Gu Mo had already reached the Grandmaster level—an astonishing feat given how little time had passed. His talent was no less impressive than her own special constitution.

With Gu Mo as her teacher, Chu Feifei wasted no time in seeking his guidance. Even though she hadn't fully absorbed his previous lessons, she wanted to gather as much insight as possible before the crucial cultivation period ahead.

She didn't dare ask Gu Mo to constantly cast the Cleansing Technique for her—that would be too much to ask. His guidance alone was already a tremendous help. Without him, she wouldn't have discovered her constitution so soon.

As he instructed her, Gu Mo pondered something else. If the Grandmaster-level technique had such an effect, what would the Perfect-level version do?

In the end, he decided against using it on her for two reasons. First, the Perfect-level technique required adjusting the spiritual energy's frequency to match the recipient's physique—a process that would give him complete insight into her body. For cultivators, such intrusion was a serious breach of privacy.

Second, the Perfect-level technique consumed too much spiritual energy. If he used it on Chu Feifei, he wouldn't have enough left for himself. Currently, he relied on it to cleanse and refine his own meridians—a process he couldn't afford to interrupt before reaching the Qi Refining stage.

Helping others was fine, but not at the cost of his own progress. That would be putting the cart before the horse.
