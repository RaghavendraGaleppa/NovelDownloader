# Chapter 81: The Moved Assessment Elder

"So that's how it is!" Yang Ji nodded.

"My Lord, I've told you everything truthfully, please spare me," the Demon Wight pleaded pitifully.

"Spare you? You've consumed too much blood and flesh of cultivators; you're an evil holy medicine. As a disciple of the Dao Sect, it is my duty to eradicate demons and evil," Yang Ji said, looking askance at it, feigning righteousness.

His five fingers subtly clenched, putting pressure on it.

"My Lord, I couldn't help it! I had no choice but to consume blood and flesh before. Now I want to be a good wight, please spare me."

Feeling the pressure from his fingers, the Demon Wight quickly added, sobbing, "My Lord, if you spare me, I am willing to surrender to you, I am willing to follow you! I possess Buddhist scriptures, and my talent is better than those you just took in. I will definitely be more useful than them in the future, please spare me!"

Hearing this, Yang Ji was overjoyed. This was exactly what he wanted to hear.

This little wight's luck was even stronger than his; naturally, he wanted to bring it under his command.

However, at this moment, he still displayed a compassionate, righteous indignation, shaking his head and saying:

"Unfortunately, you possess the Buddhist-Demonic Scripture. A Demon Wight with such an unrighteous nature would only cultivate it into a demonic scripture, becoming a great menace in the future."

"For the peace and stability of the world, to prevent demonic disasters, I can only crush you to death, just as I killed the Demon Sect's Dao Child."

As Yang Ji's five fingers clenched, the Demon Wight's body creaked, scaring it badly. It quickly cried out, "My Lord, 'Buddha or Demon is born from the heart; one thought leads to demon, one thought leads to Buddha.' My original heart is kind, so I am naturally a Buddha! My Lord, don't kill me!"

"Can you guarantee that?" Seeing that he had pushed it far enough, Yang Ji slightly loosened his fingers, gazing at it.

"I guarantee it, I guarantee it!" The Demon Wight gasped for breath, nodding repeatedly. "My Lord, don't kill me. From now on, I'll be your wight. If you tell me to eat someone, I'll swallow them whole in one gulp!"

"Hmm?" Yang Ji immediately frowned in displeasure, stating solemnly, "We are a righteous Dao Sect; how can we casually eat people?"

"Hehe, My Lord is right. Anyway, from now on, whoever you tell me to eat, I'll eat them. My Lord's words are always right," the Demon Wight chuckled.

Yang Ji saw a hint of cunning in its eyes, knowing that this little fellow was only temporarily submitting under his oppressive might, and who knew what schemes it would hatch later.

This Demon Wight had absorbed many fragments of cultivators' divine souls, gained human sentience, become incredibly cunning, and also possessed the Buddhist-Demonic Scripture, making it impossible to judge by ordinary reasoning.

However, a wight that had fallen into his hands was his wight. If he couldn't even control one wight, how could he talk about achieving the Dao and becoming an immortal?

Yang Ji wasn't afraid of it harboring ulterior motives. He scrutinized it, then nodded and said, "Since you guarantee this, then I will spare you. I take into account your youth, and that you can still develop good character. From now on, you will honestly follow by my side and not commit evil, understand?"

"Understood, My Lord, I understand." The Demon Wight quickly showed an innocent, childlike smile, nodding like a chick pecking at rice.

"Mm!" Yang Ji nodded, feigning profundity.

"Oh, right, give yourself a name. Stop calling yourself 'little wight' or 'this wight'," Yang Ji added.

The Demon Wight pondered, then suddenly said, "Hehe, then I'll be called 'Buddha Child' from now on. Using Buddha as a mirror, to reflect upon oneself, to mend the heart, to cultivate the body—I am originally a kind child."

"'Buddha Child,' that works too." Yang Ji nodded.

"Come into my sleeve, let's go out."

"Understood, My Lord."

In the hall outside the secret chamber, the others who were meditating and recuperating saw Yang Ji emerge and quickly came forward to greet him.

Everyone knew Yang Ji had sent them away earlier, and at this moment, they wisely didn't inquire about the Demon Wight.

"How is your recuperation coming along?" Yang Ji swept his gaze over the group and asked.

"We took some pills, and we're much better now; our movements are unimpeded," the white-haired elder said.

"Alright then, let's return to the sect," Yang Ji nodded.

"By the way, My Lord, when we return to the sect to confirm the mission later, should we mention that you single-handedly killed the Demon Sect Dao Child's avatar? If the sect's high-ranking officials knew, they would definitely value you, and you would likely gain many benefits," the smiling young man suddenly said during the teleportation.

"No need. If we say I alone killed the Demon Sect Dao Child, wouldn't the sect deem your assessment a failure, thus ruining your future? Instead, we can say that we collectively killed the Demon Sect Dao Child's avatar, but I was the main force. This way, if it draws the sect's attention, that's best; if not, there's no loss," Yang Ji said calmly.

Everyone nodded, knowing this was the safest approach.

After several days and multiple transfers, everyone finally returned to the Boundless Dao Sect.

Seeing the fairyland-like scenery of the Dao Sect again, Yang Ji still felt a surge of emotion.

Passing the first assessment meant he was one step closer to remaining in the Dao Sect permanently, and one step closer to eternal life.

Although the Dao Sect was incredibly vast, travel within it was very convenient, with teleportation arrays laid out everywhere.

Yang Ji and the others used a teleportation array to directly transport themselves to the Assessment Mission Hall.

The reason "Assessment" was added to its name was because this grand hall was specifically used to review the mission completion of disciples undergoing assessment.

The Assessment Hall was not located within the Celestial Dome Immortal Palace, but atop an immortal mountain on the ground.

The peak of this immortal mountain appeared to have been sliced off flat by someone using great divine abilities with a single sword stroke.

Upon it, grand palaces were constructed, hidden amidst the clouds and mist, majestic and vast.

Everyone was teleported to the mountaintop, where they also saw many cultivators, clearly all having completed their missions and come for the elder's review.

Yang Ji's group of eight looked around, then walked directly towards the grand hall.

"Our mission review is in Hall Six," the robustly dressed girl said, looking at her Dao Sect token, which displayed the mission and had the number "Six" at the end.

Everyone nodded and followed the directions to Hall Six.

Outside the hall, two Foundation Establishment realm guards, serving as attendants, saw them approach and asked, "Are you Senior Brothers here to have your assessment missions reviewed?"

"Precisely. Is the Assessment Elder busy at the moment?" the white-haired elder asked with a smile.

"There are currently no disciples being reviewed inside. Senior Brothers, please enter."

"Thank you."

The white-haired elder and the others cupped their hands and walked in.

The hall was not elaborately furnished; only an Assessment Elder sat cross-legged on a futon, meditating.

This middle-aged elder had a refined appearance and was at the Refinement Void Realm of cultivation. Seeing the group enter, he slowly opened his eyes.

"Greetings, Elder!" Everyone bowed in salute.

"Have you completed your assessment mission?" the Elder asked with a gentle smile.

"We fortunately passed. Elder, please review it." Everyone respectfully presented their Dao Sect tokens and each took out a corpse of an Eight Profundity City Lord.

The Assessment Elder glanced at their Dao Sect tokens, then swept his divine sense over the corpses on the ground, nodding. "This mission was issued by me. These corpses are indeed those of Eight Profundity City Lords."

"Do not resist my divine sense. I will check your cultivation levels. If you are indeed at the Peak Golden Core stage, then you will have passed the assessment."

Everyone rejoiced at these words, allowing the Assessment Elder's divine sense to sweep back and forth within their bodies.

It was a strange sensation; as the Elder's divine sense swept over them, it felt as if all their secrets had nowhere to hide, completely exposed.

Before long, everyone felt their bodies relax, knowing the Elder had withdrawn his divine sense.

"You are indeed all at the Peak Golden Core stage, confirmed. Your first assessment is passed."

"Thank you, Elder." Everyone's faces brightened with joy as they bowed again.

The Assessment Elder smiled slightly and, using his unique Dao power, inscribed the seven characters "First Assessment Passed" onto everyone's Dao Sect tokens.

Yang Ji and the others had been assessed by him. These seven characters, written with his unique Dao power, meant that if Yang Ji and the others had cheated, the elder would also bear joint responsibility.

However, having it written by his hand also signified authority, meaning Yang Ji and the others had genuinely passed the assessment.

Just as the Assessment Elder was about to hand back the Dao Sect tokens, the white-haired elder spoke up at the opportune moment: "Elder, these Eight Profundity City Lords are not as simple as mere city lords. Their true identities are actually avatars of Di Xuansha, the Demon Sect Dao Child of the Slaughtering Demon Sect."

"You said they are avatars of Di Xuansha, the Demon Sect Dao Child of the Slaughtering Demon Sect?" The Assessment Elder froze, then raised his head in astonishment.
