# Chapter 4: Activation  

Li Shiming refused to resign himself to an ordinary life. Though his memories from his past life contained knowledge like how to build a generator, there wasn’t much he could fully recall and implement—especially while conforming to the constraints of this world.  

Without the aid of a large-scale server, his options were severely limited.  

But with a large-scale server at his disposal, the possibilities became endless.  

With this thought, he activated the uninterrupted power supply connected to the IBM z15 mainframe and booted it up.  

The indicator lights on the massive server cabinet flickered to life one by one. Li Shiming could sense the power in the uninterrupted power supply draining rapidly—just the startup alone had brought it dangerously close to the warning threshold.  

A surge of panic hit him. Without sufficient power, a sudden shutdown during startup could easily damage the server's components.  

His consciousness plunged into the IBM z15, instantly granting him complete control over the entire system.  

The main power drain came from the CPU and memory self-checks. With his consciousness, he shut down all but one CPU and reduced the memory to just 64GB.  

Apart from the Linux system and a small amount of available space, he deactivated all other storage units.  

This drastically reduced the server's power consumption to a level the uninterrupted power supply could handle.  

The IBM z15 was far more complex than the power supply. Had he not been intimately familiar with it—having maintained it for a year—he wouldn’t have been able to manipulate it so swiftly with his consciousness.  

Being inside the IBM z15 was an entirely different experience from merely observing it from the outside.  

He could perceive the internal structure and operation of every single component with perfect clarity.  

When his consciousness reached the display processor, a familiar interface appeared before him—the Linux graphical interface of the IBM z15.  

He tested the controls and found he could operate it normally. His eyes had become the server’s display, and his consciousness its keyboard and mouse.  

He didn’t access the stored data yet—that would require activating the deactivated storage units. Retrieving those files would consume far more power, and for now, he had no need to increase the energy drain.  

---  

He created a document and tried typing.  

To his surprise, he didn’t need an input method—words appeared as soon as he thought of them.  

He recalled an essay he had memorized in school: *Farewell to My Father’s Back* by Zhu Ziqing.  

The moment he thought of transcribing it, the entire essay appeared in the document at once.  

Though the text wasn’t long, the instantaneous typing speed was beyond imagination.  

Next, he tapped into the memories of his current life, recalling all the classical texts he had studied.  

*Classical Selections* was a compilation of scholarly articles curated by generations of the Li family, similar to the *Five Years of Exams, Three Years of Simulations* from his past life—a study guide for examinations.  

Again, in an instant, the document filled with a vast sea of text—nearly two million words from the *Classical Selections* his predecessor had memorized.  

He saved the document under the name *Classical Selections*.  

A powerful realization struck him: by copying the text this way, the nearly two million words had been etched into his mind, never to be forgotten.  

With just a thought, any passage from *Classical Selections* surfaced in his memory.  

He experimented by withdrawing his consciousness from the IBM z15. The engraved sensation faded, returning his memory to its normal state.  

He wasn’t disappointed. Though he still relied on the IBM z15, as long as he remained connected, it was as if he were constantly reviewing the *Classical Selections*—not line by line, but all two million words simultaneously.  

While the effect wasn’t immediately obvious, over time, even without the connection, his retention would likely be just as strong.  

*"When I have time, I’ll input the remaining four million words of the* Classical Selections *into the server!"* Li Shiming murmured excitedly. But when he checked the power levels, he smacked his forehead in realization.  

He had nearly forgotten something crucial.  

He activated the IBM z15’s storage array and searched for information on rosary peas.  

Seeing the rosary peas earlier had given him an idea—could he use their deadly poison against Chief Escort Wang?  

But he worried that grinding them into powder might make the toxin too slow-acting.  

He vaguely remembered reports from his past life about the medicinal uses of rosary pea poison.  

After consulting the server’s data, he learned the toxic component was *abrin*. He also found extraction methods—requiring phosphoric acid, ammonium sulfate, glycerol, and a centrifuge.  

He transferred the necessary information to the memory and shut down the power-hungry storage array.  

Now armed with all the relevant data, he wasn’t a chemist, but with these resources, he was confident he could extract the chemicals he needed in this world.  

He jotted down a list of materials with a brush, then added a few more items.  

Since he already needed glycerol, and preparing ammonium sulfate required sulfuric acid, he might as well add nitric acid to the list—allowing him to produce nitroglycerin.  

After his kidnapping by Chief Escort Wang, he understood the dangers of this world.  

He needed ways to defend himself—not to harm others, but at least to protect against threats.  

*"Young Master, the medicinal ingredients have arrived!"* The servant Mo Yan called from outside the study.  

*"I need these items within the hour!"* Li Shiming handed him the list.  

Mo Yan scanned the list and winced.  

*"Young Master, even if I ran myself ragged, an hour wouldn’t be enough. I’m not worried for myself—just afraid I’ll fail your orders!"* he said with an ingratiating smile.  

*"Hire more runners if you must. Say it’s my command. There’ll be a reward if it’s done."* Li Shiming waved him off.  

*"Understood, Young Master! It’ll be done in an hour!"* Mo Yan, now motivated by the promise of a reward, hurried away.  

Some items on the list—like certain minerals—would be difficult for ordinary people to procure. But with the Li family’s connections, many could be sourced directly from the Nanling Prefecture’s stores—just a bit troublesome.
