# Chapter 426: The Discrepancy Between Dream and Reality, Returning to the Divine Weapon Peak

“Exactly how did you leave me completely powerless?”

Li Mo scratched his neck, glancing at the ice lump holding the big-headed doll, her head slightly lowered.

Could the ice lump have some secret weapon?

As everyone knew, her attainments in martial arts were unfathomable. It was perfectly reasonable for her to have手段 he hadn't seen before.

“Using a sword?”

“No.”

“Fist techniques? Palm techniques? Secret arts?”

But it was strange. No matter how Li Mo asked, Qin Yuzhi just shook her head, leaving the confused Little Li even more perplexed.

If she didn't use a sword or secret arts, how did she take him down?

“That’s strange... It couldn’t be leg techniques...”

Li Mo turned his head suspiciously to look at the ice lump. He found her picking up a strawberry, completely forgetting that she had just said she wouldn't eat fruit. She took a gentle bite, and her lips, like shattered jade, were stained with a layer of pink crystal.

Wait!

He remembered the Heavenly Wonder's miraculous martial arts, like a golden mouth speaking jade words, containing the laws of heaven.

“Was it with your mouth?”

“!”

Qin Yuzhi’s eyes widened. That wasn't what she said; Li Mo had guessed it himself.

How could he guess that?

This kid was twelve parts out of ten kinds of strange!

“.....”

Ying Bing stared blankly at the strawberry she had just taken a bite of. The originally hazy scene instantly became clear. A blush swept across her neck, as if stained by strawberry juice... causing the coolness on her jade-like face to show signs of melting...

“Things in dreams are sometimes... irrational...”

“True.”

Seeing her like this, Li Mo thought to himself that he might have hit the mark by accident.

Then he looked at Qin Yuzhi again:

“Master Qin, not only can you control dreams, but you can also travel through the dreams of others?”

“Of course, I said so yesterday.”

Qin Yuzhi regained her composure and nodded:

“This requires a profound understanding of the Dream Dao and reaching the Fourth Realm, the Inner Scenery, to be able to do it. In this world now, I’m afraid I’m the only one who can dream-walk...”

Speaking of this, Master Qin’s expression became wistful:

“Thinking back to the years when I took over the Divine Sect, the Cloud Dream Hall was already in decline. The entire hall had no more than ten Dream-Walking Envoys, and not a single Dream-Weaving Envoy. Managing the Power of Sentient Beings was also beyond our capacity; we could only rely on propaganda and education. I went to the then Sect Master for help, guess what he said?”

“People with Dream Dao aptitude are so hard to find. I have no one to give you...”

Listening to Qin Yuzhi recount the past while slurping noodles, Little Li roughly understood.

It turned out that in the days when the Summoning Demon Sect was still the Summoning God Sect, the management of the Power of Sentient Beings relied on dreams.

Dream-Walking Envoys could travel through dreams and give dreams to the people.

For example, pretending to be the other party's seventh uncle...

Even more powerful Dream-Weaving Envoys could initially weave dreams.

The efficiency of managing the Power of Sentient Beings was extremely high, so high that the Cloud Dream Ancestor God eventually revived...

“In less than a century, the Cloud Dream Hall under my command had everything. Hmph, do you think anyone can become a Sect Master without some ability?”

Qin Yuzhi was in high spirits, but then suddenly remembered that the Cloud Dream Hall was gone now. Forget about leading a team, the current Divine Sect was at best a gang.

“Master, are you interested in returning to your old profession?”

At this moment, after some thought, Li Mo said seriously.

“How to return to the old profession?”

“You know, our Vajra仙宗 has now reached a strategic cooperation with the Summoning Demon Sect. Currently, part of the Power of Sentient Beings in the Southern Frontier is within our business scope.”

“But apart from me and the圣女, the other main members of our sect only understand Elephant-Shape martial arts. We severely lack experience in managing the Power of Sentient Beings...”

Hearing this, Qin Yuzhi couldn't help but feel that Little Li really had something to him.

Give him a little ice girl, and he dares to trick the Beast Hall Master along with the Summoning Demon圣子!

He was even troubled by having too much Power of Sentient Beings.

After pondering for a moment, Qin Yuzhi asked seriously:

“Helping you is no problem, but the Power of Sentient Beings is not an ordinary thing. It is deeply entangled with the current Great Yu Dynasty, the Summoning Demon Sect, and even the Nine Heavens Immortals. Can you handle it?”

“I don't plan to absorb it myself.”

Li Mo shook his head.

“Then who?”

---

“One day, I strive to leave people completely powerless without even lifting a finger.”

“???”

Hmm.

When the Qi Tian Dou battle intent reaches a certain level, once the Great Sage's Divine Will is released, it dominates the clouds and sky, piercing through heaven and earth.

Ordinary cultivators of the same realm would indeed be completely powerless.

Ying Bing's deep, clear eyes reflected the figure of the youth.

Seeing his high fighting spirit, she realized she had overthought things. He probably wasn't pretending to be stupid; he really didn't know...

“Yes, he is using the Power of Sentient Beings to practice...”

If she lost to him again in the next ranking match.

It wouldn't be a matter of whether he knew about that dream or not.

If it really came to that...

In reality, she wasn't the Empress of the Phoenix Sky or the Master of the桂 Palace from her past life... There is a discrepancy between reality and dreams. Li Mo's physical body was already stronger than hers; it would be impossible to pin him down...

“Why think so much about it.”

“I haven't lost yet...”

......

Two days later.

The Qingyuan Mountain Range warmed up slightly, seemingly heralding the approach of spring. The earthfire on the Divine Weapon Peak began to stir and revive, melting the snow first.

The peak, which had been silent for the entire winter, echoed with the clanging sounds of forging once again.

Li Mo took advantage of this day to head to the Divine Weapon Peak.

The forging courtyard at the peak was quite bustling.

The snow hadn't even completely melted yet, but a group of muscular men were standing in front of the furnace, swinging forging hammers, sending sparks flying as they struck the iron blocks.

Surprisingly, the Three Heroes of Hengyun were also among them.

“Brother Li, you're here.”

“How did you guys become blacksmiths?” Li Mo asked. Wandering swordsmen all valued elegance and freedom; how could that be related to blacksmiths?

“The Master instructed it.” Wu Chushu said with a bitter face.

“Master Zeng said that a true swordsman not only needs to understand his own sword.” Bai Jinghong's expression had lost much of its arrogance, adding a touch of steadiness.

Cao Mu picked up the conversation: “But also needs to understand all kinds of weapons.”

“Elder Zeng also knows the way of forging?”

Li Mo was stunned and looked towards the depths of the forging courtyard.

Then he saw two old men with graying hair, both bare-chested, their muscles bulging, seeming even more vigorous than strong men.

Elder Han He and Elder Zeng were forging iron, occasionally glancing at each other with smiles of mutual appreciation.

This scene was indeed quite fiery...

“The Master and Elder Han He are old friends; they occasionally exchange notes on the way of smelting.” Wu Chushu explained.

“Xiao Mo is here.”

Elder Han He smiled warmly, beckoning Li Mo over, then said:

“You probably don't know yet? His hammer is no ordinary thing...”

“I know! How could I not know?” Elder Zeng nodded quickly, his expression vaguely showing a hint of gritted teeth.

Nonsense, the sword mark... oh no, the strange stone of their Hengyun Sword City, had already been turned into the shape of that hammer.

How could he not know?

“...”

Elder Han He was interrupted mid-boast and paused.

“Ahem, if he can fully master the Panjie Meteor Hammer, he might become a Divine Craftsman in the future! Hahaha, if you don't believe it...”

“I believe!”

Elder Zeng's eyes were firm, his words decisive.

Have you ever seen the birth of a Hammer Dao Divine Art?

I have!

“?????”

Elder Han He was once again choked up.

Showing off in front of others requires first suppressing then uplifting. Usually, Old Zeng often doubted him. Why wasn't he giving him any chance to slap him in the face today?

“...”

Li Mo sighed silently.

Although the Hammer Treasure was good.

But... his talent had to be a hammer!
