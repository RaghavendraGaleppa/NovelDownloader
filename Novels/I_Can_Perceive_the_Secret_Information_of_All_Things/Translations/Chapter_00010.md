# Chapter 10: A Stubborn Mule

Standing beneath the withered willow, Xiao Ji kicked the tree lightly, unable to hide his admiration for the cultivator's skill—it looked almost indistinguishable from a real tree. He was tempted to poke it with his sword to see if it would cry out in pain.

He never would have imagined that a fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator could achieve such a feat. While it wasn't as impressive as full-fledged transformation arts, the ability to conceal one's form through techniques and magical tools while creating a convincing disguise wasn't something just any cultivator could pull off.  

At the very least, Xiao Ji knew he couldn't do it himself.  

After lingering by the tree for a while and piecing together the details, Xiao Ji learned why this tree—named Zhao Jiuzhou—had ended up here.  

His sect had been annihilated.  

The Profound Iron Sect wasn't a particularly renowned faction in the cultivation world, but it did hold a unique advantage in artifact forging. As one of the members of the Dao Alliance, it was classified as an eighth-tier sect—marginally better than the lowest ninth-tier.  

Any sect that failed to meet even the ninth-tier standard was ineligible to join the alliance.  

The reason for its destruction? Internal strife.  

It all began when the Profound Iron Sect discovered an iron mine unusually rich in spiritual energy. While excavating, they unearthed an eerie coffin. The body inside had clearly been dead for thousands of years, yet it showed no signs of decay—its face as lifelike as if it were merely sleeping, clutching a small box tightly in its arms.  

Inside the box was a single coiled string—a sub-string from a qin.  

The disciple who found it handed the artifact to the Divine Hammer Elder, who then presented it to the sect master. After extensive deliberation, they concluded that the string was extraordinary.  

Excited by their discovery, they worked together to mount the string onto a specially crafted iron pipa. Over a year and a half, they refined it into a superior magical artifact.  

The pipa, now with only one string, possessed immense power—capable of influencing minds, enhancing cultivation, and aiding enlightenment through its music.  

But no sooner had the single-string pipa been completed than disaster struck. A first-level Qi Refining physician named Duan De, responsible for treating injuries within the sect, incited the Divine Hammer Elder to murder the sect master and seize the artifact.  

The aftermath was brutal. In a single night, nearly ninety percent of the Profound Iron Sect's members were slaughtered.  

Just five days later, Duan De conspired with the elder's son to poison the Divine Hammer Elder to death. Then, Duan De killed the elder's son and used poison to eliminate the remaining disciples. With the single-string iron pipa in hand, he vanished without a trace.  

As for Zhao Jiuzhou, despite being a single-spiritual-root prodigy, he had entered the cultivation world late and had only been practicing for a short time. His master was mediocre at best, and since the sect itself wasn't particularly strong, he had only reached the fourth level of Qi Refining.  

His passion, however, lay in the art of disguise.  

It was this skill that allowed him to survive the sect's collapse. On that fateful night, he had transformed himself into a table—only to find himself unable to revert. Trapped in that form, he had no choice but to witness the horrors unfold before him. Duan De's murder of the elder's son had happened right before his eyes, leaving him with full knowledge of the truth.  

By the time he finally deciphered how to undo his transformation, the Profound Iron Sect was no more. Corpses littered the grounds, the stench of blood thick in the air, drawing scavengers from miles around.  

Now, his sole purpose was to find Duan De—not to reclaim the powerful artifact, but to avenge his fallen sect. He wanted to wrench the traitor's head from his shoulders and offer it to the spirits of his slaughtered brethren.  

Following every possible lead, he had tracked Duan De to Longxiang County and eventually to the Child-Giving Temple. He suspected that the so-called Physician Xue was none other than the former Duan De.  

Hiding in plain sight, he waited for Physician Xue to appear. If the man wasn't Duan De, he would slip away unnoticed. If he was, however, he would experience the shock of a tree suddenly attacking him.  

After absorbing Zhao Jiuzhou's memories and combining them with what he had learned from the demonic infant spirit, Xiao Ji was certain—Physician Xue was indeed Duan De of the Profound Iron Sect.  

The single-string pipa was all the proof he needed.  

Relieved, Xiao Ji realized this master of disguise posed no threat to him. Their goals didn't conflict—one sought a person, the other an artifact. With some negotiation, they might even become allies.  

"Drop the act. I see through you."  

Xiao Ji couldn't pretend otherwise—the man had already witnessed his actions. Leaning close to a knothole resembling an ear, he whispered his accusation.  

The withered willow remained motionless.  

Unwilling to let the charade continue, Xiao Ji pressed further.  

"It's winter. The snow clinging to your branches proves you're meticulous—but why in the world are you blooming? And with such vibrant red flowers? Even at night, they're impossible to miss. When the temple acolyte comes to refill the stone lanterns, he'll notice you. And then things will get messy."  

Still, the willow didn't react.  

"Should I test if your knothole feels pain?" Xiao Ji reached for the sword on his back.  

The willow's branches twitched, then began to shrink until they reshaped into a human figure.  

Zhao Jiuzhou's expression was far from pleased.  

For a long moment, neither spoke.  

"Let's talk somewhere else." Xiao Ji strode away without waiting for a response.  

Though Zhao Jiuzhou didn't know the origins of this Daoist, the fact that he had seen through his disguise suggested he wasn't an enemy. Curiosity piqued, he followed to hear what the man had to say.  

"I'm Xiao Ji of the Primordial Spirit Temple. My master has made it clear—I'm the only candidate for the next temple master." Xiao Ji deliberately elevated his standing, knowing it would command respect. "I suspect Physician Xue of the Child-Giving Temple is a sinister healer, so I came to investigate."  

"I'm Zhao Jiuzhou of the Profound Iron Sect. My sect was annihilated—I'm the sole survivor. In a way, that makes me both disciple and sect master." Zhao Jiuzhou spoke gravely. "I disguised myself as a tree to confirm Physician Xue's identity. I believe he's the traitor who destroyed my sect."  

"In that case, you're not the only survivor—technically, there are two." Xiao Ji emphasized the point. "Assuming, of course, that Physician Xue really is the traitor you speak of."  

"A traitor ceases to be part of the sect the moment they betray it. So no, I'm still the only one." Zhao Jiuzhou was adamant.  

"Fine, you win." Xiao Ji had no desire to argue semantics—this debate could stretch until dawn without resolution.  

Zhao Jiuzhou's retort died in his throat, his face flushing red with frustration.  

After this brief exchange, the two formed a tentative alliance.  

Moving stealthily, they soon reached the rear wall of the main building in the temple's backyard.  

**[Below ground, seven Child-Giving Temple priests are submerged in medicinal vats.]**  

So the priests really were murdered... Xiao Ji paused, deep in thought.  

The presence of the bodies underground confirmed the existence of a hidden chamber beneath the main building. To access it, they'd need to find the entrance inside.  

The single-string pipa, forged from iron, was too large to carry inconspicuously. From Zhao Jiuzhou's memories, Xiao Ji knew that at the time of the Profound Iron Sect's downfall, Duan De had only been at the first level of Qi Refining—his only notable skill being medicine.  

Less than a year had passed since then. Under normal circumstances, his cultivation wouldn't have progressed beyond the second level.  

In this world, storage artifacts required at least sixth-level Qi Refining to use.  

Therefore, the single-string pipa was almost certainly hidden in the underground chamber.  

With Physician Xue absent, now was the perfect time to investigate.  

Just as Xiao Ji prepared to scale the roof and enter through the tiles, Zhao Jiuzhou suddenly tapped his shoulder from behind.  

"But how can you be so sure you'll be the next Primordial Spirit Temple master?"  

Seriously? Now of all times?  

What kind of stubborn, competitive oddball was this?  

Xiao Ji turned, meeting Zhao Jiuzhou's gaze squarely. In a low, deliberate voice, he answered:  

"Because the current temple master—my master—has only one disciple. Me."
