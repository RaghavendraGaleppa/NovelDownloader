# Chapter 44: Spatial Grid

Chen Fei said nothing, merely looking at the two of them.

"Take a look at this portrait. Can you spot anything unusual?"

Xing Wenxiang smiled at Chen Fei's wary expression and said, "We suspect this person used a disguise technique. Would you mind helping us out?"

Chen Fei's expression remained unchanged. He put on his deerskin gloves before taking the portrait.

The portrait was well-drawn, nearly identical to the appearance Chen Fei had adopted when he disguised himself. This showed how deeply impressed Ling Hanjun had been by the incident.

"It's hard to spot anything unusual just from a portrait."

Chen Fei glanced at it a few times, then looked up at the two men. Chen Fei was being honest; a portrait was, after all, a recreated piece, drawn by an artist based on Ling Hanjun's verbal description. Even if there were subtle differences, the artist would have found it difficult to capture them. Therefore, to truly tell if someone used a disguise, one had to see them in person, just as Xing Wenxiang had immediately recognized that Chen Fei's current appearance was a disguise.

"Is that so? What a pity then."

Xing Wenxiang glanced at Ling Hanjun. In truth, Xing Wenxiang knew that a portrait alone wouldn't reveal anything, and Ling Hanjun was only *suspicious* that someone had used a disguise. If it had been anyone else asking for help, Xing Wenxiang would have refused long ago, as it was simply an impossible task. But Ling Hanjun was someone he couldn't refuse, so he could only come to the dark market to observe from time to time. Coming after Chen Fei now was merely to allow Ling Hanjun a close look, to see if the person before him was suspicious. That was all.

Thanks to the three movement technique manuals he obtained from the Zhang family, Chen Fei's qinggong was now completely different from before, so he had no need to worry about being implicated.

"Well?"

Xing Wenxiang looked at Ling Hanjun's contemplative expression and asked with a smile.

"It shouldn't be this person," Ling Hanjun thought for a moment and shook his head.

"No worries. I'll continue to visit some of the experts in the county with you. If we still don't find anything, then that person probably left Pingyin County."

Ling Hanjun nodded slightly and said nothing more.

Chen Fei circled around for a bit before returning to his rented courtyard. Chen Fei frowned slightly, not expecting Ling Hanjun to be so persistent. Fortunately, Chen Fei had made many preparations for selling pills.

Back in his room, Chen Fei took off the satchel from his back and looked at the gleaming silver inside, a smile appearing on his face. Over five hundred taels. At this rate, earning the fifty thousand taels for the Dragon-Elephant Suppression Technique would only take a few months. However, Chen Fei couldn't stay in Pingyin County for that long. But with his alchemy skills, he could still earn money quickly in other cities later on.

"Store!"

With a thought, the silver on the table vanished instantly. The balance displayed on his panel surged, immediately exceeding the five thousand taels of silver mark.

This spatial grid could indeed store things, but it could only hold one item at a time. Once the longbow was placed inside, the arrows couldn't be stored, unless he took out the longbow and then put in something else.

"It really is a spatial grid. No wonder it only cost five thousand taels."

Chen Fei scratched his head. This spatial grid was only one cubic meter, but if it could only hold one item at a time, its utility significantly decreased.

"Is this telling me to save money and keep buying more grids?"

Chen Fei paced around the room, constantly thinking about the panel's description of this spatial grid. A moment later, Chen Fei paused, then walked into the kitchen. Looking at the full bag of rice before him, his mind focused, and the next moment, the rice vanished, appearing within the spatial grid. Chen Fei's expression shifted slightly, and joy gleamed in his eyes. The rice reappeared in the kitchen. Chen Fei stepped forward and opened the bag, revealing the yellowish rice grains inside.
