Chapter 67: I Want to Be Quiet

After the spring plowing and sowing, it was not yet time for the farmers to rest easy. The busy farming season was far from over. The result of "sowing one seed in spring and harvesting ten thousand grains in autumn" could not be achieved by simply scattering seeds. Three parts depend on the seed, seven parts depend on management. The next priority was the major task of irrigation. This was the most important matter after spring sowing, directly affecting the germination rate of the crops. If there was a spring drought, the villagers had to use waterwheels, buckets, and canals to draw water from rivers, wells, and ponds to irrigate the fields.

However, the fields here relied mostly on the Long River for irrigation. Drawing water from the Long River and channeling it across the vast plain created a tree-like network of irrigation channels. While inspecting the fields, Yang Can discovered another area for improvement: the waterwheel. Although they could draw water from the Long River, which was a superior water resource, the fact that water flows downhill meant that some plots of land, despite being fertile, were located at higher elevations and were difficult to irrigate, preventing their full development.

Zhang Yunyi's hidden fields and tenants were developed later. The best, easily irrigated land had long been cultivated by the local people, so they could only reclaim land at higher elevations. Consequently, they could not cultivate more land—not because there was no more land, but because they couldn't water it all. Feng'an Manor also had waterwheels, but the waterwheels of this era required manpower or animal power to operate. Whether it was foot-powered, hand-cranked, or pulled by an old ox, the efficiency was naturally low. Moreover, manpower was finite and could not work continuously. At the same time, this old-style waterwheel could only lift water to a limited height. Therefore, as long as the terrain was slightly higher, fertile soil could not be vigorously developed.

Yang Can was delighted upon seeing this. It was simple—simpler even than the process of inventing the curved-plowshare. This was great; he could show off again! Before long, the first high-lift tubular waterwheel, completely powered by water and self-operating, was installed under the direction of the Yang Manor Lord. Such a waterwheel could lift water to a height of ten zhang. If a reservoir was built ten zhangs high to make the lifted water flow, and another waterwheel was built at the flowing point, it could continue to lift the water even higher. With this irrigation tool, many high-lying lands could be turned into good fields.

Yang Can once again showed off, and as the news spread, the name "Yang Can's Cart" once again became famous throughout the world. If Yang Can's secret—sleeping with the wife of the eldest son of the Yu family—hadn't been known, he would have been secure in his position within the Yu family just based on this achievement. The Yu family could no longer easily sacrifice Yang Can. If they did, the Yu family's reputation would be ruined by public opinion. This made Yu Xinglong both hate and love Yang Can. He loved him because Yang Can's two improvements could elevate the Yu family's strength to a new level. Just increasing the family's grain output was not enough to significantly boost the Yu family's power, especially in the political ecosystem that had been balanced and stable for hundreds of years. However, a massive increase in grain production could lead to a qualitative change. For the Yu family, Yang Can was now a hero of great merit. Yu Xinglong was in urgent need of talent, and he was determined to keep Yang Can, this treasure, and not treat him as a disposable pawn.

Moreover, he no longer needed to investigate Yang Can to trust him. No great clan would send such a person out as a spy, nor would any spy provide a weapon that could so greatly increase the strength of his target. He would keep this Yang Can. If he hadn't already promoted Yang Can to the position of Second Steward of the Eldest Branch and Lord of Feng'an Manor in a short period, making it unsuitable to promote him again immediately, the talent-hungry Yu Xinglong would have certainly promoted him again. In any case, he had decided to keep this treasure. However, some pits still needed to be filled, and some pots still needed someone to take the blame. This person had to be someone they wouldn't feel bad about pushing forward, and their identity and status had to be somewhat convincing. That was the difficult part. The Lord of the Yu family was not only short on talent, but also hard-pressed to find a suitable scapegoat.

"Xiao Deng..." After much deliberation, Yu Xinglong asked his steward, Deng Xun, who had been his study companion since childhood and served him until old age. "What do you think of Li Youcai?"

This waterwheel didn't require careful observation; one glance and you could see where the improvement was. Therefore, it spread exceptionally fast. Soon, its blueprint appeared in the Blackwater Pavilion of the Northern Que Villa in Dailai City. Although the draftsman was unprofessional and the waterwheel looked a bit lopsided, the principle was clear at a glance.

"Have someone build it according to the blueprint immediately!" Yu Huanhu slammed the table and stood up. "Where is Ziming? Has he not established contact with Yang Can yet?"

"My Lord, Yang Can is causing a stir at Feng'an Manor, and many people are watching him. The Young Master said he needs to act naturally on this trip to avoid arousing suspicion. So, the Young Master needs to take care of some things first and hasn't contacted Yang Can yet."

"Good, tell him to raise the stakes. I must have this Yang Can!"

"Yes!" The subordinate immediately hurried to make arrangements and rushed to inform Yu Rui. As for what stakes to add, it would be nothing more than money, women, titles, and official positions. As Yu Huanhu's successor, Yu Rui could decide these matters himself without needing explicit instructions from his father.

Yang Can only improved the waterwheel; the remaining matters were still left entirely to the Manor Lord, Zhang Yunyi. Thinning seedlings, replanting, weeding, pest control, fertilizing... Although these tasks were numerous, any farmer could do them. More people were busy in the fields, as they no longer required only strong labor. The elderly, women, and children, and half-grown kids could all handle these tasks.

Kang Zhengyang could finally start his long-planned venture: doing business. He would do small-scale business, which was easier to implement. The business Yang Can intended to do was to first parasitize the Suo and Yu families until he was strong enough to replace them. The starting point for this business was much higher, so it was still far from fruition.

Thanks to the Yang Can Plow, the Kang family saved a lot of strong labor. At this point, the most arduous stage of spring plowing and sowing had passed, and the women and children at home could be put to use, further freeing up the workforce. Kang Zhengyang decided to take advantage of this rare opportunity to make a good profit. He gathered the able-bodied men of the Kang family, raised a sum of money, and headed for Tianshui City. When they left, they didn't go empty-handed; they brought honey, beeswax, angelica, astragalus, felt blankets, cloth... These things were all collected from the manor. They took these agricultural products and the textiles produced by the women of the manor to Tianshui. Once they sold these agricultural and sideline goods, along with the cash they brought, they could buy a batch of daily necessities urgently needed by the nomadic tribes, go through the Feihu Pass, and do another business with the nomads. With this round trip, the profit for them would be a considerable sum of money.

Of course, this matter couldn't be kept secret, and Kang Zhengyang never thought of hiding it. So, from the moment he gathered his relatives and proposed this idea, the entire Feng'an Manor knew about it. Many people were envious, but not everyone had the ability to imitate him. Moreover, his caravan was not large yet; for now, relatives, friends, and close family retainers were enough, and there was no need to recruit many people. The envious commoners could only look on with envy.

At night, the Kang family caravan rested at Iron Forest Ridge. By the next morning, they would arrive at Tianshui City. The leader was Kang Zhengyang's third brother, Kang Zhengyan. The second brother, Kang Zhengyi, was too simple and honest to be suitable for business, so Kang Zhengyan chose the third brother. Iron Forest Ridge was a valley with many pine trees on the mountains, which looked like cast iron in the night, hence the name. Kang Zhengyan's party had twenty-one people in total, escorting four large carts of goods purchased at Feng'an Manor. There was a cave halfway up the mountain in the valley, which the locals knew about. Lighting a fire in the cave could drive away mosquitoes, flies, snakes, and insects. It was an excellent place to rest.

Around midnight, Kang Licheng got up groggily to relieve himself. Kang Licheng was the eldest son of the second brother Kang Zhengyi, and Kang Zhengyan's nephew. It was late April, and the nights in the mountains of Longshang were still very cool. He was afraid of snakes and insects in the grass, so he didn't dare to walk into the dense grass. Fortunately, this was the wilderness, so he didn't have to worry too much. Kang Licheng was urinating when he suddenly heard a "tap," as if someone had thrown a stone. Kang Licheng grew suspicious and quickly fastened his belt, drew his sword, and looked around warily.

"Clatter..." The sound of another stone rolling came. Kang Licheng held his breath and cautiously followed the sound. Turning a corner, he saw two bonfires on the mountain path. Four carriages were parked by the bonfires, the same number as their own. The horses had been unharnessed and tied to trees. More than twenty strong men were gathered around the two bonfires, roasting food and talking and laughing in low voices. Kang Licheng noticed that all four large carts were covered with rain cloths. In this era, rain cloths were mainly oilcloth and lacquered cloth. Oilcloth was more expensive, while lacquered cloth was more cost-effective. It seemed these were merchants from afar. Seeing the rain cloths, Kang Licheng suddenly understood. Short-distance merchants like them didn't have rain cloths; even though lacquered cloth was cheaper than oilcloth, it was still an expense. They were small-scale traders and couldn't afford it.

Seeing that it was just a group of traveling merchants, Kang Licheng wanted to slip away quietly. However, he didn't expect that among the burly men around the bonfire, a stone suddenly fell. This stone was the size of a fist and fell into the fire, immediately sending sparks flying. The people around the bonfire jumped up, and someone cursed, "Who the hell is messing around?"

"Hmm, who is it? Stop right there!" Someone suddenly saw a figure flash by the rock and immediately shouted. Kang Licheng saw that these burly men were all tall and strong, with swords at their waists, and knew they were not to be trifled with. He took after his father, being honest and not wanting to cause trouble, so he didn't answer, just quickened his pace. This made the others even more suspicious, and they immediately drew their swords and gave chase.

This group of people was transporting mountain goods for "Mountain Master." What was on their carts, they knew best in their hearts. They knew that if this matter was exposed, it could very likely bring a fatal disaster. Now that they had encountered a suspicious person, they naturally wouldn't let him go easily.

"Stop! If you run again, we'll shoot!" The people behind shouted as they chased. Kang Licheng ignored them and ran straight toward the cave. How difficult it would be to shoot a running person in the dark of night. Kang Licheng usually went up the mountains to hunt with his father and was very skilled with the bow and arrow. He knew this very well and wasn't afraid of their threats.

"Third Uncle, Third Uncle, wake up quickly, someone is causing trouble!" As soon as he reached the cave, Kang Licheng immediately shouted. Kang Zhengyan and the others, who were sleeping in the cave, were startled awake. Hearing Kang Licheng's cry, everyone got up, grabbed their weapons, and rushed out of the cave.
