# Chapter 19: Highly Sought After! Seven Sects Compete for Favor!

"Hey! Where's that Lu Wei guy from earlier? Do you want your magical instrument sweet or salty?!"  

"Too shocking! Absolutely unbelievable!"  

"Such a talisman-making genius has actually appeared among us rogue cultivators!"  

"What a pity! If he had been born in the neighboring Yuanwu Country and taken in by the Wanmiao Temple, he would surely have received intensive training!"  

Li Huayuan, Fu Yunzi, and the other Golden Core cultivators from the six sects stood frozen in place.  

Lin Yun had accomplished something they couldn't.  

With their current cultivation and age, they could naturally craft elementary talismans, but such talismans were useless to them now—they needed intermediate-level ones.  

However, becoming an intermediate talisman master was extremely difficult, requiring not only exceptional talent but also consuming vast amounts of materials!  

Currently, in the Yellow Maple Valley, only the head of the Talisman Hall was an intermediate talisman master!  

And that person was already 180 years old!  

It took years of experience and accumulation to reach that level!  

Even now, if they tried crafting high-grade elementary talismans themselves, they couldn't achieve Lin Yun's success rate of two out of eight! It was simply outrageous!  

"Huh, I actually succeeded twice out of eight this time. My luck isn't bad," Lin Yun chuckled as he handed the talisman brush, cinnabar, and paper back to Nangong Wan.  

Nangong Wan's eyes were filled with astonishment. She carefully examined the two talismans in her hand—they were indeed high-grade elementary metal-element talismans: Thousand Blades Talismans!  

"A genius! A true genius! I admit, in terms of talisman-making talent, I'm no match for you!" Nangong Wan exclaimed, looking at Lin Yun with admiration.  

Then she said to him, "You can join my—"  

"Wait a moment!" Before Nangong Wan could finish, the Golden Core cultivators from Tianque Fort, Huadao Valley, Spirit Beast Mountain, and Giant Sword Sect all spoke up simultaneously.  

"Fellow Daoists, what do you think you're doing? Lin Yun was discovered by me first! He should naturally belong to our Veiled Moon Sect!" Nangong Wan said unhappily.  

"Haha—Fellow Daoist from the Veiled Moon Sect, the Ascension Assembly has no such rule. We agreed beforehand that aside from the pre-selected candidates from each sect, the others have the right to choose for themselves."  

"This young friend Lin Yun isn't on the pre-selected list."  

The so-called pre-selected list referred to clan cultivators like Dong Xuan'er, Lu Yunfeng, and Zhou Qingning.  

"So according to the rules, this young friend Lin has the right to choose which sect to join," the Golden Core cultivator from Tianque Fort said with a smile.  

"Exactly!" Fu Yunzi from the Clear Void Sect nodded in agreement, then walked over to Li Huayuan and patted him on the shoulder. "Fellow Daoist Li, your Yellow Maple Valley has truly given us a wonderful gift!"  

"Hahaha—a model for all seven sects! A shining example!"  

The others present also nodded in agreement. Given the current conflict between Lin Yun and the Yellow Maple Valley, it seemed unlikely he would choose to join them.  

Li Huayuan naturally understood the sarcasm in their words. He shook off Fu Yunzi's hand with an unhappy shrug.  

Then, forcing a smile, he said, "Hahaha—young friend Lin, you truly are a talisman-making genius!"  

"To be honest, I could tell from the start that you were no ordinary person. That earlier incident was just a test of your resilience. Your performance has truly satisfied me."  

"Damn—you old fox, you really have no shame!" Fu Yunzi rolled his eyes at Li Huayuan.  

"Young friend Lin, our Veiled Moon Sect is the strongest among the seven sects, and we possess the most resources! You must understand how important resources are for a talisman master!"  

"Moreover, I am also an intermediate talisman master. If you're willing to join the Veiled Moon Sect, I can guarantee your advancement to Foundation Establishment. Once you reach that stage, I’ll personally guide you in talisman techniques. With your talent, you’ll quickly become an intermediate talisman master."  

Nangong Wan laid out her conditions to Lin Yun.  

"Young friend Lin! Why not join our Tianque Fort instead? We—"  

"And our Huadao Valley!"  

"Giant Sword Sect!"  

"Spirit Beast Mountain!"  

"Clear Void Sect!"  

The sudden shift in attitude from the Golden Core ancestors left the rogue cultivators present dumbfounded. Some even rubbed their eyes in disbelief.  

"Am I dreaming? A Five Spiritual Roots cultivator is being fought over by all seven sects?!"  

"What’s happening to the world?"  

"Idiot! He’s a talisman-making genius! Do you think he’s trash like you?!"  

All eyes were fixed on Lin Yun.  

Beside him, Han Li awkwardly scratched his nose, though he was genuinely happy for his friend.  

"Brother Lin is a good person. If he can join one of the seven sects, we’ll have a chance to meet again in the future. Then I can give him spirit herbs and pills."  

The other six sects were all making their offers, while Li Huayuan stood there anxiously.  

Especially with the conditions Nangong Wan had proposed—they were practically impossible to refuse!  

Originally, the Wind Spiritual Roots genius his sect had specifically wanted was already dead. If he missed out on Lin Yun too, he’d have nothing to show for his efforts.  

But there was indeed some bad blood between Lin Yun and the Yellow Maple Valley.  

Li Huayuan was as frantic as an ant on a hot pan.  

Then, his gaze landed on Chen Qiaoqian and Dong Xuan'er, who were standing beside Lin Yun.  

He quickly sent them a voice transmission.  

"Junior Disciple Chen, you’ve known Lin Yun for a while. Help persuade him!"  

"Junior Disciple Dong, you too."  

"This…" Chen Qiaoqian hesitated upon receiving Li Huayuan’s message, torn between conflicting emotions.  

If the Chen Clan hadn’t forcibly taken her back, she would have eagerly urged Lin Yun to join the Yellow Maple Valley.  

But now, the Chen Clan was forcing her into a marriage alliance with the Lu Clan, and that Lu Yunfeng had even conspired with a Foundation Establishment cultivator to harm Lin Yun. She simply couldn’t bring herself to speak up.  

Moreover, the Veiled Moon Sect’s offer was clearly better. If Lin Yun joined them, he might even become a disciple of a Golden Core ancestor and eventually advance to an intermediate talisman master.  

Dong Xuan'er had no such reservations. She immediately clung to Lin Yun’s arm and said, "Brother Lin, won’t you join our Yellow Maple Valley?"  

"I can ask my master to take you as her disciple! My master is the number one Golden Core cultivator in the Yellow Maple Valley—Ancestor Hongfu! A late-stage Golden Core cultivator!"  

"Brother Lin, please join the Yellow Maple Valley! If you go to the Veiled Moon Sect, I’ll never see you again!"  

"Brother Lin, you’re really lucky," Han Li thought enviously as he watched.  

Feeling the softness pressing against his arm, Lin Yun smiled. He had already decided to join the Yellow Maple Valley.  

After all, his "money god" was still there, and did the Veiled Moon Sect have a Nascent Soul cultivator to expand his network?  

More importantly, with his maxed-out talisman expertise, did this intermediate talisman master really think she could teach him anything?  

Wasn’t that a joke?  

Who would be teaching whom here?!  

As for the promise to help him reach Foundation Establishment, Lin Yun glanced at the fifty Foundation Establishment Pills in his possession and decided he didn’t need the help.  

So while Nangong Wan’s offer seemed generous on the surface, none of it was actually useful to Lin Yun.  

Of course, to an ordinary person, the Veiled Moon Sect’s conditions would be the best.  

Lin Yun didn’t immediately declare his decision. After all, there was still time before the Ascension Assembly ended. If he made his choice now, what if someone got desperate and did something rash?  

Besides, keeping his options open might allow him to negotiate for better terms.  

He wouldn’t reveal his choice until the last possible moment.  

Lin Yun turned to Chen Qiaoqian. "What about you? Which sect do you want me to join?"  

"Of course I want Brother Lin to join the Yellow Maple Valley!" Chen Qiaoqian screamed inwardly, but in reality, she couldn’t bring herself to say it. Biting her lip, she realized she and Lin Yun could never go back to how things were.  

"Whatever sect Brother Lin chooses, I’ll be happy for him," she finally said.  

Nangong Wan glanced between Lin Yun and Chen Qiaoqian. It seemed these two had known each other for a while—something she hadn’t expected.  

Still, she was confident Lin Yun would choose the Veiled Moon Sect. After all, the conditions she’d offered were something no talisman master could refuse.  

"Thank you for your kindness, esteemed seniors. But this matter has come upon me rather suddenly, and my thoughts are still in disarray. Please allow me a few days to consider," Lin Yun said, bowing respectfully to the Golden Core cultivators.  

Seeing that Lin Yun hadn’t made an immediate decision, the Golden Core elders from each sect smiled. There was still a chance.  

"Haha—take your time, young friend Lin. The Clear Void Sect’s doors are always open to you!"  

"And our Tianque Fort!"  

"Huadao Valley!"  

"Spirit Beast Mountain!"  

"I’m so jealous of that guy!"  

"He’s just a False Spiritual Roots cultivator, yet all seven sects are letting him pick and choose!"  

"And the most infuriating part is that he’s still hesitating!"  

"Is this really such a hard decision?!"  

"If it were me, I’d join the Veiled Moon Sect without a second thought!"  

"That’s the Veiled Moon Sect! Not only is it the strongest of the seven sects, but it’s also filled with beautiful men and women. Finding a few Dao companions there would be like living in paradise!"  

Under the envious gazes of the crowd, Lin Yun and Han Li left the Tai Nan Mountain Tower together.  

Chen Qiaoqian watched Lin Yun’s retreating figure. She wanted to follow him but feared he might send her away.  

Dong Xuan'er had no such worries. After puffing out her chest in a silent challenge to Chen Qiaoqian, she stuck to Lin Yun like glue.  

"Brother Lin! Wait for me!"
