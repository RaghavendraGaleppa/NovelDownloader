# Chapter 99: He is a Natural Born Killer!

Inside the government office.

Looking at his sister, who looked as though she had suffered some great injustice, Luo Yu felt a headache coming on.

"You ran out again?"

"I... um..."

"Do Mom and Dad know?"

"They... of course they do."

Luo Yao stammered.

Luo Yu frowned.

"I'll write a letter to Mom and Dad then and ask what's going on."

"Wuuu wuu, I almost died, and you're still being fierce at me! I don't want to live anymore! I should have just let them beat me to death! Big brother, you're a big bad guy too!"

Luo Yao cried even louder. She was covered in dirt, looking as miserable as could be.

Luo Yu's mouth twitched.

He clearly saw his sister crying like a pear blossom drenched in rain, while her fingers secretly opened a tiny gap to peek and see if he was feeling心疼 (heartache) for her.

He was familiar with his sister's routine.

But the people from the Fen Yulin around them began to advise him one after another.

"Senior, Junior Sister Luo already knows she was wrong, so let's not追究 (investigate/punish) her for now."

"Whoever dares to move someone from our Forest must pay the price. Otherwise, they'll think we are all Confucian gentlemen with no temper!"

"Don't be afraid, Junior Sister. Your Senior Brother has read the sages' books thoroughly; I will definitely reason well with those who bullied you."

One Senior Brother took out a thick "Analects of the Sages."

The book was not only thick, but its four corners were inlaid with iron that glinted with a cold light.

Most of the disciples of Fen Yulin came from noble backgrounds. Although they practiced martial arts, they didn't call themselves martial artists, considering it vulgar.

They didn't call fighting "fighting"; they called it "reasoning."

Usually, the "Sages' Books" were enough to make the other party submit.

Luo Yu: "..." 

Are you guys trying to make the government city even more chaotic?

"The Prefect requests an audience."

After the announcement, Prefect Cui was invited in.

"Making the Young Miss Luo suffer injustice is this official's negligence."

"Did you see what the歹徒 (villain) looked like?"

Upon learning that a disciple from Fen Yulin had almost been killed, he was greatly shocked and furious, expressing deep apologies.

"It was the Night Ghost Liu Heng," Luo Yao said.

Everyone turned cold upon hearing this name.

No wonder.

The Night Ghost Gate committed all sorts of crimes and was destroyed by Fen Yulin. It seemed this was an act of revenge.

"Liu Heng..."

Prefect Cui glanced at the Gentleman's Brush clutched in Luo Yao's hand, his eyes flashing slightly.

"I have heard of this criminal."

"This man's martial arts are诡异 (strange/uncanny), and he usually only appears at night."

"This official will send people to track him down..."

"That won't be necessary."

Luo Yao shook her head and said, "He's already been beaten to death."

Hearing this, the agitated crowd froze.

Then why did you cry so loudly just now?

But thinking about it again.

If the Night Ghost Liu Heng hadn't died, the Junior Sister wouldn't have been able to come back.

Thinking of this, a wave of fear rose in their hearts. The Little Junior Sister was usually held by the Forest Master as if afraid she would break, and kept in his mouth as if afraid she would melt. If something had happened to her, wouldn't the Forest Master go crazy?

Prefect Cui raised an eyebrow.

"Who killed Liu Heng?"

Luo Yao thought for a moment and said, "Do you guys know of the Northwest Hammer King?"

Huh?

The crowd looked at each other in bewilderment.

They had only heard of things like the Fist Saint, Sword Immortal, or Spear God. Who walks the Jianghu calling themselves the Hammer King? It didn't sound romantic or dashing at all.

"I haven't heard of it either," Luo Yu thought for a moment and shook his head.

"What about the Hard Gang?"

The crowd: "....."

What kind of genius gang would give itself such a ghost name? It sounded like a lie.

It was certain that the other party hadn't revealed their true origins.

---

"What are his characteristics?" Prefect Cui asked thoughtfully.

"He wore a Green Dragon Head mask, and his voice sounded very nice (a bubbly voice)."

"And when he swung his hammer, it was incredibly cool. He was like a firefly in the pitch black. Just standing there, he was so distinct, so outstanding..."

As Luo Yao spoke, her eyes shone with a sparkling brilliance.

*Wait, how is a hammer cool? It's just a hammer!*

The Senior Brothers felt a bit jealous.

Prefect Cui frowned, then relaxed.

"If Young Miss Luo wants to thank her savior, this official will order people to help you pay attention."

"Okay, okay," Luo Yao nodded.

"Don't run around recently. Since the Prefect has promised, you shouldn't go out looking for him yourself."

Luo Yu warned his sister, then turned back.

"Prefect, I reviewed the recent case files and found that children frequently go missing in the city."

"Since the Wujian Trial began, the number has increased daily. Prefect, you should attach great importance to this matter."

"This Young Master will also try to find a way to investigate."

Prefect Cui, who was walking to the door, paused. With his back to the crowd, he remained silent for a few breaths.

"Thank you, Young Master, for sharing the burden of this official."

...

Inside a secret room.

Prefect Cui looked over the register, looking thoughtfully at the names of the Huai Mountain Three Tyrants on it.

The Smiling Maituo had mentioned that these three were respectively—Dragon, Tiger, and Leopard.

Dragon Head, skilled with a hammer.

He should be the eldest of the Huai Mountain Three Tyrants—Dragon Tyrant.

He was actually able to kill Liu Heng, who was in the Xuan Dan Realm?

I really misjudged this one.

And furthermore...

"Liu Heng... dying is good! It's a good death!"

"He almost ruined me completely just for a brush!"

Prefect Cui gnashed his teeth.

The other disciples of Fen Yulin would have been fine; he could have let them take their revenge. But it had to be Luo Yao, the most beloved youngest daughter of the Fen Yulin Master.

Luo Yushu, the Fen Yulin Master, was the proud disciple of the great Confucian scholar Zhang Shou and had a classmate relationship with the current Emperor. If he hadn't disliked officialdom, he would have been a high-ranking official by now.

If Luo Yao had really died, and the Gentleman's Brush had fallen into his hands...

Just thinking about it made his back break out in a cold sweat.

"Magistrate."

A subordinate's figure appeared.

"Have you found Liu Heng's body?"

"Yes. It's turned into a pile of ash. Nothing left on him, it's very clean," the subordinate replied.

"Good. This Dragon Tyrant is quite thorough."

Prefect Cui sighed in relief and couldn't help but nod in praise.

You see, he acted without a sound and knew how to hide his identity.

He was decisive in his actions. After killing someone, he cleaned up the scene meticulously without leaving any traces.

He wasn't greedy. The famous artifact was right in front of him, yet he still let it go along with Luo Yao.

High strength, meticulous mind, and knows when to advance and retreat.

A natural-born killer!

The only slight flaw... is probably the weapon.

What killer uses a hammer?

"Send a message to the Smiling Maituo. Tell him to pay special attention to the Huai Mountain Three Tyrants."

"Yes!"

"Have you found Jiang Chulong?"

"Reporting to Magistrate, we found her, but Mei Yun is still missing..."

"No matter. Let's see how long she can hide!"

After ordering the subordinate, Prefect Cui opened the register on his own.

Many names on it had already disappeared.

It's a bit strange.

In this Wujian Trial, people are dropping like flies.

At this rate, it won't be long before this trial ends...
