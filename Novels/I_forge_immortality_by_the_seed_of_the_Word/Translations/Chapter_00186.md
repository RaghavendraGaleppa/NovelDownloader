# Chapter 183: The Battle

"Oh?"

Upon hearing True Monarch Yuanming's words, the Seven Desires Divine Lord's eyes couldn't help but show a hint of surprise.

The participation conditions for the Proud Cloud Secret Realm were set by himself. If he remembered correctly, it seemed to only contain cultivators at the Foundation Establishment and Golden Core stages. The esteemed True Sun Realm Lord's gaze would actually fall upon such juniors? Even going so far as to lower his pride and ask him to open the core of the Proud Sun Secret Realm, just so the other party could comprehend the Immortal Proud Sun?

Suddenly, the Seven Desires Divine Lord felt a sliver of curiosity about the disciple mentioned by the True Sun Realm Lord. He wanted to know what extraordinary qualities this junior possessed to make the True Sun Realm Lord consider him so much.

Afterwards, the Seven Desires Divine Lord pondered slightly. Opening the secret realm core and allowing the junior to enter and comprehend the Immortal Proud Sun wasn't a big deal either way. It could even make the True Sun Realm Lord owe him a favor. However... if he agreed so easily, it would ultimately be a loss of face. More importantly, once this loophole was opened, he would certainly be incessantly troubled in the future.

Not long after, the Seven Desires Divine Lord spoke, a half-smile flickering in his eyes, which were constantly burning with terrifying karmic fire. "True Sun, it's not impossible to let him in, but I also have a request. As long as the junior successfully takes first place in this secret realm competition, he may enter the secret realm core to comprehend the Immortal Proud Sun. How about it?"

"Good! It should be so," True Monarch Yuanming said, a knowing smile appearing on his face as he nodded.

"Haha, True Sun, you're quite confident in that junior," the Seven Desires Divine Lord immediately let out a hearty laugh.

Hearing this, True Monarch Yuanming smiled without answering. He gently turned his head and looked in another direction. His gaze seemed to instantly cross an infinitely vast distance, falling directly into the Proud Cloud Secret Realm, looking at Zhang Jing, who was sitting cross-legged.

"Disciple, let's consider this opportunity your master's welcoming gift. With the blessing of those five-colored auspicious clouds, you should be able to gain some insights. And if you can comprehend a trace of the Seven Desires Divine Lord's original karmic fire Dao from it, then it will be a huge gain," True Monarch Yuanming thought to himself.

Immediately, as if he thought of something, True Monarch Yuanming looked at the Seven Desires Divine Lord again, a bit embarrassed, and tried to speak: "Divine Lord, I have another disciple, why not take this opportunity—"

"...True Sun, you truly have no shame!"

***

Ten days passed in a flash.

On the highest arena of Human Sovereign Island, Zhang Jing opened his eyes, slowly stood up, and his gaze swept over the other arenas below. A look of "as expected" flashed in his eyes. He saw that in the center of each arena, a figure was quietly sitting cross-legged.

Clearly, facing the upcoming final round ranking battle, all one hundred cultivators who advanced this time were, like himself, cultivating in seclusion within the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.

"That's right, how could cultivators who've reached this stage not desire to strive for a better ranking? After all, according to the Secret Realm Spirit, one's ranking is closely related to the rewards of karmic luck," Zhang Jing analyzed in his mind. "With only ten days, it's natural to seize the time to adjust one's state, and even cultivate in hopes of making a breakthrough." A faint smile unknowingly flashed at the corner of his eye.

Just then, the others on the arena seemed to sense something, and one after another, they stood up from their spots and looked towards the sky. Zhang Jing also raised his head.

In his line of sight, a giant scroll suddenly appeared, then was slowly pulled open by a pair of massive hands, emitting rumbling sounds.

That was— Zhang Jing's breath hitched. The opened scroll was actually blank. Before he could fully react, the Secret Realm Spirit's iconic giant face, covering the sky, began to slowly emerge, its face bearing an extremely brilliant smile.

"The time has come, I announce that the final round ranking battle now begins! Each person corresponds to a number, and there will be four rounds of competition each day. Winners will be recorded with one win."

The moment the voice fell, streaks of light flashed. Zhang Jing immediately felt an irresistible force suddenly appear, pulling him away from the arena he stood on. In an instant, everyone on the arenas appeared at various locations on Human Sovereign Island. And in the sky, the hundred arenas began merging two by two, instantly transforming into wider, broader arenas, simultaneously exuding a profound aura.

"This is... my number?" Zhang Jing thoughtfully looked at the small line of text marked 'Yi-1' that appeared before his eyes. Then... he suddenly looked at the fifty massive arenas floating in mid-air. As expected, on them, numbers flickered into existence.

"Attention, the numbers you just saw are your own. Follow the instructions and ascend to the corresponding arena," the Secret Realm Spirit's explanatory voice resounded in his ears at the opportune moment.

***

Hearing this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but look up again, and his gaze quickly locked onto one of the arenas. Yi-1! Ding-13! So the opponent for this match is the one with number Ding-13? Interesting. His gaze unintentionally shifted further upwards. Only then did Zhang Jing discover that on the giant blank scroll in the sky, one hundred names had unknowingly appeared, arranged in order from top to bottom. Soon, he found his name among them: [Yi-1 · Zhang Jing, Wins: Zero].

***

On the arena, a rainbow light flashed into existence. The light dispersed, revealing Zhang Jing's tall figure. His gaze swept across the empty opponent's side. There was no ripple in his calm eyes; he merely clasped his hands behind his back, quietly waiting for his opponent to arrive.

Not long after, a red rainbow light entered his vision, transforming into a beautiful woman in a palace dress. The moment she saw clearly, the woman's gaze froze, and her face instantly turned ashen. Such terrible luck?! How could she be so unlucky as to encounter one of *those three* in the very first match of the ranking battle? Isn't this an inauspicious start?!

But since it was already a fact, the woman had nothing more to say. She took a deep breath, then a hint of determination flashed in her eyes, and her entire body's magical power instantly surged forth. "Please enlighten me, fellow Daoist!" she shouted softly.

The woman stepped forward, and her entire being instantly transformed into hundreds of illusory figures, directly surrounding Zhang Jing. The next moment, all the illusory figures simultaneously formed hand seals. Hundreds of crimson flames ignited from the illusory figures' hands, emanating waves of powerful magical fluctuations, flying towards Zhang Jing from all directions. It actually gave him a feeling of overwhelming power, nowhere to hide.

For a moment, the scorching firelight illuminated a small section of the nearby sky, turning it crimson. A scorching aura permeated the air. Even the bronze arena beneath their feet seemed to faintly feel as if it were about to melt before such terrifying flames. However, the next moment, an immortal light flashed. The bronze arena returned to its cold, hard state.

The extremely exaggerated commotion immediately drew the gazes of cultivators fighting on more than ten nearby arenas.

At the edge of the arena, the woman watched Zhang Jing, who was enveloped by layers of firelight, her face pale, and a sliver of expectation couldn't help but arise in her eyes. She knew she shouldn't harbor such thoughts. But what if? After all, her inheritance came from a place of great fortuitous encounters. It was said to have been left behind by a mighty expert who was only half a step away from attaining the Heavenly Immortal fruit status.

And this strike, which almost completely drained all the magical power from her Dantian, was her strongest technique at her current stage!

"It should have some effect, right? At least it should make him look a bit disheveled. Such a performance should attract the attention of those immortal Daoist orthodoxies," the woman thought with hope in her heart.
