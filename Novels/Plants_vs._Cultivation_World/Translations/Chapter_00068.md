# Chapter 68: Plant Perception

If the fusion of spiritual plants could be considered the immortal cultivation version of grafting, then their cultivation could be understood as hybridization—especially when the elder used Spirit Jade Rice as an example. Who hadn't heard of hybrid rice? At that moment, Gu Mo felt that the profession of a spiritual botanist wasn’t all that difficult to grasp. This stood in stark contrast to the rest of the group, who were still racking their brains in confusion.

For them to understand concepts like grafting and hybridization was clearly not something that could be achieved in a short time. And it seemed the Golden Core elder had no intention of delving deeper into the subject.

"That concludes the basic knowledge of spiritual botany. Mastering these will allow you to become a formal spiritual botanist," Qi Chunde said, sweeping his gaze over the crowd. His eyes lingered on Gu Mo for a moment longer. The divine sense of a Golden Core cultivator was incredibly powerful, and every reaction from the disciples was within Qi Chunde’s perception. 

Gu Mo’s look of comprehension was unmistakable. This laborer disciple seemed to genuinely understand what he had explained—grasping it after just one hearing. Such insight was truly remarkable. In contrast, the others wore expressions of frustration, clearly failing to grasp the concepts. Among so many outer sect disciples, and even one inner sect disciple, none could compare to a mere laborer disciple.

Still, this batch was better than the previous ones. At least a few might become spiritual botanists, which would allow him to fulfill his obligation to the sect master.

As a guest elder of the Qinglu Sect, Qi Chunde had initially been reluctant to leave behind any spiritual botany legacy here. However, the treasures offered by the sect master were too tempting to refuse, so he reluctantly agreed to impart some knowledge—though he would never reveal the core secrets of his own sect.

As for taking on disciples, Qi Chunde had no such intention. He was not originally from this cultivation world. During a mission, he had been ambushed and forced to use a life-saving escape technique, leaving his homeland far behind. After wandering for a long time, he arrived in this cultivation world and was eventually invited by the Qinglu Sect’s master to become a guest elder. But sooner or later, he would leave this place, so he had no reason to leave behind his sect’s legacy here.

There was another reason—he had yet to encounter a disciple who truly impressed him. That laborer disciple might have shown decent comprehension, but he was still far from Qi Chunde’s ideal standards. 

This cultivation world was somewhat remote, and spiritual botanists were undervalued. Even if a true prodigy emerged, they would likely prioritize paths like alchemy, artifact forging, formations, or talismans over spiritual botany.

With a faint sigh, Qi Chunde’s figure vanished without a trace. He made no effort to offer further guidance or answer questions, leaving the disciples to figure things out on their own.

The group was left bewildered. They had all hoped for the elder’s personal instruction, only to be left with nothing.

"Junior brothers, please follow me," Song Xing and Li Jinmei, who had been waiting nearby, promptly stepped forward to guide the group away. They were accustomed to this scenario—after all, they had gone through the same process themselves. Becoming a spiritual botanist relied entirely on comprehending the knowledge the elder had imparted.

Thus, when faced with questions from the others, the two chose to remain silent. They had worked hard to gain their insights and had no obligation to share them freely. Moreover, the fewer spiritual botanists there were in the sect, the more valuable their own positions would be. Secretly, they hoped no more would emerge.

"Junior Brother Mai, stay behind for a moment," Song Xing whispered to Mai Yunfa through a sound transmission. During his time in the Spiritual Botany Hall, Zhao Zhishi had shown him considerable favor, so he couldn’t refuse the latter’s request.

Zhao Qiancheng had prepared more than just securing a front-row seat for Mai Yunfa. As a steward, he knew the chances of a Golden Core elder taking special notice of someone just because they sat closer were slim. Thus, arranging for Song Xing—an established spiritual botanist—to guide Mai Yunfa was his second strategy.

"Understood," Mai Yunfa replied with an imperceptible nod.

"Junior Sister Li, I have some spirit wine and spirit fruits. Would you care to share a drink with me later?" While Song Xing was communicating with Mai Yunfa, the inner sect disciple Shan Yu sent a sound transmission to the other spiritual botanist, Li Jinmei.

"Senior Brother’s invitation is an honor!" Li Jinmei readily agreed. Though she was one of only two spiritual botanists in the sect, she was still an outer sect disciple, her resources and status inferior to those of inner sect disciples.

Shan Yu wanted Li Jinmei’s insights into spiritual botany, while Li Jinmei coveted the resources an inner sect disciple could provide. Since both had something the other desired, the arrangement was mutually beneficial.

As for the other outer sect disciples, lacking connections or resources, they had no choice but to return and ponder the knowledge on their own.

Gu Mo, however, was an exception.

Returning to his hut by the spirit fields, Gu Mo immediately began organizing the knowledge he had gained about spiritual botany. The core of it all was a unique technique exclusive to spiritual botanists—Plant Perception.

Just as alchemists had their pill-refining arts and artificers their forging techniques, Plant Perception was the foundational secret method of spiritual botanists. Only by mastering it could one truly step into the profession. Of course, becoming a full-fledged spiritual botanist required proficiency in other skills, such as cultivation, fusion, and enhancement of spiritual plants.

This was akin to alchemy—knowing the refining technique alone wasn’t enough. One still needed to learn various pill recipes to produce actual pills.

According to the elder, just as humans and spirit beasts had meridians, spiritual plants also had their own networks. Sensing these networks was the first step to becoming a spiritual botanist, and Plant Perception was the method to achieve this.

Cultivating this technique required a certain level of spiritual strength—the stronger the soul, the easier it was to learn. Fortunately, Gu Mo, having practiced the Wine God Soul-Tempering Art, possessed a soul far more robust than his peers. Thus, he encountered no significant obstacles in mastering the technique.

Since he didn’t need to cultivate, he could dedicate all his time to studying. In just over a month, Gu Mo successfully grasped the basics of Plant Perception.

Eager to test his newfound skill, he headed to the spirit fields to experiment on the Water Spirit Rice growing there.

With a series of hand seals, Gu Mo pressed a finger against a stalk of Water Spirit Rice. Instantly, a network of veins materialized over the plant. "So this is the vein structure of Water Spirit Rice. Truly marvelous," Gu Mo murmured in awe as he observed the intricate patterns.

He could even see faint blue streams of water-attribute spiritual energy flowing through the veins—much like a cultivator circulating qi during cultivation, though in this case, the energy was meant to nourish the plant’s growth.

Suddenly, a thought struck him: *If I artificially increase the flow of spiritual energy through these veins, could I accelerate the plant’s growth?*
