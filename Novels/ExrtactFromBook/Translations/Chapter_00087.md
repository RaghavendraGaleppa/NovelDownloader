# Chapter 86: Immortal's Peril

Han Yue could no longer stand. The excruciating pain rendered him incapable of thought or bodily control.

The [Demon-Slaying Sword] remained clenched tightly in his grasp. Under the assault of lightning, his muscles had contracted violently—now, no one could pry open his fingers, not even himself.

Lying on the ground, Han Yue pointed the [Demon-Slaying Sword] straight toward the sky like a defiant middle finger challenging the thunderclouds. Though unintentional, he could no longer alter the situation.

The third bolt of lightning struck!

A torrent of mana surged from the [Demon-Slaying Sword] directly into Han Yue's body. Violent arcs of electricity crackled between him and the sword, unleashing deafening roars. Han Yue felt himself teetering on the precipice between life and death as the lightning rapidly ravaged his organs and tissues.

He couldn't just wait for death—he had to save himself!

Gathering all his spiritual awareness, he desperately channeled the [Nectar] stored within his lifeblood. Instantly, a cooling stream flowed through his veins, spreading across his body. The vast reserves of [Nectar] he'd accumulated surged forth, frantically repairing his injuries. A surge of vital life energy emerged, and his body began visibly healing.

But before long, the fourth lightning bolt descended, instantly worsening his freshly healed wounds. Still, thanks to the miraculous effects of [Nectar], Han Yue managed to wrest a sliver of opportunity to escape amidst his struggle. In the next instant, his instinctive [Golden Light Flight Technique] activated, and he vanished from the spot.

With its target gone, the thundercloud lashed out with several more bolts before gradually dissipating. By then, Han Yue had already teleported seventy kilometers west, landing atop a low mountain with protruding boulders. He lay motionless between two rocks, resembling a corpse—if not for his still-beating heart, he might as well have been one.

His body was charred black, with no patch of unburnt skin left, twisted into an unnatural contortion from the lightning's force. His appearance alone could silence a crying child. Yet, Han Yue remained conscious—and certain he would survive.

He simply needed time to recover.

Over the years, his body had accumulated vast stores of [Nectar], which now flooded his system, rapidly mending his wounds. Prioritizing his vital organs first, he would later attend to his muscles and skin. This was the most severe injury Han Yue had ever suffered—his blood was nearly scorched away, and over seventy percent of his cells and tissues had perished. Were it not for [Nectar] sustaining his heart, and the [Heritage Stele] and [Soul-Nourishing Banner] guarding his consciousness, he would have died outright.

Full recovery would take at least half a month.

Hidden between the rocks—a spot offering cover and a clear view below—Han Yue activated his [Breath-Concealing Art], which passively masked his presence. As he waited for his body to heal, he assessed his gains.

Despite the suffering inflicted by the [Lightning Summoning] technique, its effects were undeniably potent. His mana now brimmed to overflowing, circulating faster than ever. Within his body, thirty-six new [Lightning-Nurturing Runes] had formed—surpassing a year's worth of cultivation. His [Body-Nourishing Soul Thunder Method] had advanced tremendously.

Even his [Soul-Nourishing Banner] had grown more refined, expanding his consciousness by over twenty percent. The progress in his thunder cultivation alone made the ordeal worthwhile—the [Lightning Summoning] technique was absolutely viable.

But beyond that, Han Yue had gained something greater.

Within his consciousness now floated a [Heavenly Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword], bathed in his spiritual energy. Twelve [Heavenly Thunder Runes] adorned it, marking its refinement to the First Revolution, Third Refinement stage. According to the [Nine Heavens Spirit-Tempering Secret Manual], once a magical weapon reached First Revolution refinement, it could be stored within one's consciousness—becoming a true Dao-Bearing Artifact, its power vastly enhanced.

At last, Han Yue had fully forged his first Dao-Bearing Artifact. The sword felt alive, fused with his very soul. As his mana and will synchronized with it, a name imprinted itself upon his mind: [Immortal's Peril].

Han Yue was momentarily dazed—unsure whether he had unconsciously named it or if the sword's spirit had chosen the name through their bond. But the path was set; the name could not be changed. He resolved to refine [Immortal's Peril] further, ensuring its power lived up to its formidable title.

Thus, Han Yue's first attempt at the [Lightning Summoning] technique concluded successfully. Even accounting for recovery time, this method could accelerate his cultivation tenfold—an extraordinary boon. Though wracked with pain, Han Yue burned with excitement, sensing boundless possibilities ahead.

With [Immortal's Peril] amplifying his abilities, his strength had surged once more. Eager to test the sword's might, he longed for his injuries to heal faster. Yet, [Nectar] had already reached its limits—only time would mend him now.

As days passed, his condition slowly improved. Then, on the fifth day of his seclusion, something unexpected occurred.
