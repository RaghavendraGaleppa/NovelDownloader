# Chapter 407: The Summoning Cult Master (Part 1)

The entire underground palace was trembling with a deafening rumble, fine dust and debris raining down from the ceiling.

A drastic change seemed to be taking place within the underground palace.

"Is the Great Tomb about to collapse?!" Bai Jinghong cried out in shock.

Everyone’s expression changed instantly.

This underground palace was immeasurably vast and grand; they had no idea how deep underground they were. If the palace collapsed, the terror would be far greater than a mountain crumbling. Being buried alive would surely peel a layer of skin off even a Fifth Realm external scenery expert, let alone them.

"It shouldn't collapse," Li Mo said with a grave expression, shaking his head.

Through his Destiny Divine Eye, he hadn't seen anyone dying due to the collapse of the underground palace.

Ying Bing furrowed her delicate brows. After a moment of contemplation, she said softly, "Someone has triggered the killing formation on the chessboard."

Some people didn't understand the complex mechanisms of the underground palace at all and were likely wandering aimlessly, naturally walking straight into a dead end.

"There are no shortage of strong experts descending into the tomb. If they triggered the killing formation, they certainly wouldn't sit and wait for death," Tian Miao meant to say.

That group was using brute force to break through technique. Unable to comprehend the mysteries of the underground palace, they simply started using physical force to blast their way in. The latter method might come at a significant cost, or even lead to immeasurable consequences.

"We need to speed up," Li Mo and Ying Bing exchanged a glance, then looked at Tian Miao.

At the very least, Jiang Yu had a Profound Master behind him, along with the Patrol Sky Guards. Tan Zhuyin had two Dharma Body Realm Dharma Kings behind him. If they really spared no cost to rush to the main burial chamber, it was hard to say who would be faster. Moreover, if the underground palace was damaged to a certain extent, the original method to break through might fail.

"You're leaving?" Bai Jinghong asked hesitantly.

Li Mo nodded. "Stay here and don't move around. This part of the underground palace is safe. If we go further ahead, I might not be able to protect you anymore."

"If any changes occur, it would be like the city gate catching fire,殃及池鱼 (damaging the fish in the pond)..."

"..."

The Three Heroes of Hengyun felt quite complex about being treated as insignificant fish for the first time.

However, they knew Li Mo made sense, so they decided to stay put.

"You guys go ahead, we'll be fine."

"Right, don't wander around. Have you read storybooks? Those with too much curiosity often die first..."

Li Mo admonished them one last time. The Ice Cube had already twisted the numbers on the door.

The three figures disappeared into the darkness once again.

The previously high-spirited swordsmen suddenly felt the surroundings become incredibly quiet. In the pitch-black, vast environment, it felt as if a few tomb-guarding beasts could jump out from anywhere...

"We can... manage."

"Shiver, it suddenly feels so cold..."

In the darkness, the swordsmen silently became small, helpless, and pitiful, trembling in the crumbling underground palace.

Who isn't a child deep down?

...

Li Mo walked at the front to clear the way. The three returned to the correct path. As the Ice Cube opened one palace door after another, they drew closer to the depths of the underground palace.

The sound of thunderous rumbling remained at a variable distance from them.

"Ice Cube, how much longer?" Li Mo asked, but received no response for a long time.

He saw Ying Bing crouching in front of a stone door, her eyes slightly dazed, as if she had been distracted by something.

"Ice Cube? Are you alright?" Li Mo held her hand and called out softly, a bit worried.

"The situation in the underground palace has changed. I was just calculating the final step. I'm fine," Ying Bing bit her lip and shook her head gently.

She twisted the numbers on the base to the correct position again.

"It's open."

---

This time, there was no sound of the underground palace shaking, only the heavy friction of the stone door opening.

The soft light of the pearl illuminated the darkness ahead. It was a deep and long corridor; judging by the marks on the stone walls, it was definitely man-made.

Li Mo, having the strongest physical body, shielded Ying Bing behind him.

"I'll go first, follow me."

"Okay."

Footsteps echoed.

On this lengthy corridor, there were also murals, and the content was more complete, including the two murals seen previously. Or rather, they were the continuation of the murals above.

The continuation showed that after the Primordial Being was turned into a totem by the power of all living beings, the various human tribes began to wage war against each other, eventually leaving only the two largest ones.

One was depicted with red paint, the other with black.

Behind both sides stood giant figures, the Celestial Immortals who had descended from the Nine Heavens.

Behind the black tribe were five Immortals, led by the Nine-Colored Phoenix woman. Among the remaining three, the Dream God was included.

Behind the white tribe were four figures, their identities unknown.

In the end, the black tribe won, and the white tribe was absorbed.

The two tribes merged. The woman incarnated as the Nine-Colored Phoenix became a giant divine bird, sheltering the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths beneath her wings.

Another tall figure donned a crown and ascended as Emperor.

A kingdom emerged.

"The Dark Bird of Destiny descends to give birth to Shang?" Li Mo said, feeling the phrase sounded somewhat familiar.

"So the founding emperor of the Great Shang was actually an Immortal from the Nine Heavens?" Li Mo asked.

"Perhaps," Tian Miao couldn't determine events from such a distant era.

"But we need to move faster."

The three continued down the corridor.

The murals further down seemed to record the succession of Great Shang emperors, the time drawing closer to the day this underground palace was built.

Besides paintings, words began to appear on the walls of the corridor.

"The age of these characters should be very ancient..." Tian Miao frowned and looked for a moment, then shook his head.

Li Mo, needless to say, didn't recognize a single one; they weren't Chinese characters.

"This is a diary," Ying Bing suddenly said.

"A diary? Who writes that stuff seriously..."

Li Mo was curious about what a diary written thousands of years ago contained.

Ying Bing gazed at the text on the wall and read softly:

"Today is the fourteenth year I have presided over the construction of the Cloud Dream Palace, and the eighty-second year since I became the Summoning Cult Master."

"At the beginning, I thought building the Cloud Dream Palace would be straightforward, but during the process, I discovered that the layout could utilize the Nine-Death Chess Game, a dead game played between the Cloud Dream Ancestral God and the Heavens."

"Even if the Cloud Dream Ancestral God truly awakens, He cannot solve it..."

"I feel my changes becoming clearer. Every morning when I wake up, I feel I am becoming more and more unfamiliar."

"This chess game is truly difficult to arrange; not a single step can be wrong, otherwise all efforts will be wasted."

"If I were still an Immortal, wouldn't this be done with a wave of the hand..."

Here, the handwriting turned into scribbles, as if the writer was extremely shocked and flustered, wondering why he had suddenly had such a thought.

"He isn't the Cult Master? What does 'when I was an Immortal' mean?" Li Mo also felt confused.

The subsequent handwriting became very oppressive and restrained.

"I am Qin Yuzhi, the Summoning Cult Master, building the Cloud Dream Underground Palace..."

"I must hurry, otherwise He will awaken from within me... transforming from a dream into reality..."

"By then, my existence would merely be one of His dreams..."

"Am I still myself right now? I can't tell, I really can't tell..."

The murals ended here, and the corridor was almost at its end.
