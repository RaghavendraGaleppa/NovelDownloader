Chapter 14: Yang Can's Unique Skill

The escort parties of the Suo and Yu families had harbored a long-standing grudge against each other.

However, due to mutual restraint, no major conflict had occurred.

But this time, both sides were looking for trouble, so the fight was exceptionally fierce.

When Steward Yi arrived angrily to stop them, many had already been injured.

At least three of them were critically wounded, their lives hanging by a thread.

Steward Yi was furious. He was already distressed by the secret of the Young Master's death, and now the two families, who were supposed to be in-laws, had gotten drunk and brawled, leading to such severe consequences.

"Who started it? Step forward!"

"Where is Nanny Tu? Quickly, go invite Nanny Tu!"

Steward Yi issued two commands in succession, but before he could figure out the reason for the fight, he heard another shocking piece of bad news: Nanny Tu was dead!

Steward Yi was greatly startled and hurriedly followed the messenger to the scene.

When he arrived, he found that Nanny Tu had died just over twenty steps in front of her sleeping tent.

This was the center of the entire camp, but Nanny Tu's location had no bonfire, and the night was dark.

Moreover, the ground was uneven, so she lay collapsed there, undiscovered until now.

The night wind howled, the bonfires still burned, but the bone that had killed was already reduced to ash.

Nanny Tu was dead. At the place of her death, a wolf-tooth arrow was left on the ground.

But there was no blood on the arrow, and the wound on Nanny Tu's neck was not caused by a sharp arrow.

Yet, no other weapon could be found on the scene.

Who killed Nanny Tu, and with what? And why did he kill Nanny Tu?

A series of questions, but no one could answer.

No one suspected Yang Can except Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan, even though Yang Can and Nanny Tu had had a fierce conflict before.

Because this Yang Shidao was a smooth operator, and during his time as a groomsman, he was one of the few Yu family members that the arrogant Suo family didn't dislike.

Moreover, both the Suo and Yu families knew that this Yang Shidao was a scholar and Yang Can did not know martial arts.

How could a Yang Shidao who doesn't know martial arts kill Nanny Tu silently and without a trace?

Leopard Head stood in the crowd, staring at Yang Can with an extremely strange look.

Cheng Dakuan didn't think there was anyone useful by Yang Can's side.

This Yang Shidao had become the Young Master's advisor for too short a time, and he had been busy arranging the Young Master's wedding.

So, it was impossible for him to have recruited any close confidants in such a short time.

Then, was the killer actually Yang Shidao?

But how did he manage it? Does Yang Shidao... know martial arts?

Young Master Yu was assassinated and died, and Nanny Tu was killed mysteriously. Everyone knew the killer was among them, but no one knew who it was.

This cast an extremely oppressive atmosphere over the entire wedding and spirit-receiving procession.

Steward Yi was in a headache. He was also a resourceful man, but he truly didn't understand how to investigate a case.

At this time, Yang Shidao jumped out again, filled with righteous indignation.

This time, Yang Shidao pointed the spear directly at the bride, Suo Chanzhi.

"Steward Yi, I just said there was a problem with the Suo family, and then Nanny Tu died. It's clearly someone killing to silence a witness!

Among the Suo family, the only one with a status higher than Nanny Tu is our Young Mistress..."

Yang Can's voice was very loud, almost a shout, making Steward Yi's head ache.

"Yang Can, shut up!" Steward Yi sharply ordered Yang Can to be quiet.

For some reason, Yang Shidao was fixated on the Suo family!

The Suo family had the least motive to kill the Young Master!

Moreover, Steward Yi already knew who the real killer was.

He just didn't want that taboo name to come from his own mouth.

Suo Chanzhi was so angry by Yang Can's accusation that her delicate body trembled. She stepped forward and said angrily, "Steward Yi, I ask you to hand Yang Can over to my custody from this moment on."

Steward Yi was surprised and said, "Young Mistress, why do you say that..."

Suo Chanzhi appeared very agitated: "This Yang Can is just being perverse and unreasonable, blabbering that my husband's death has a great deal to do with my Suo family!

Now Nanny Tu has been mysteriously killed; it's obvious there is an insider among us!

If something happens to Yang Can next, then I, no matter how I try to clear my name, will never be able to!

How can I, a widow, still stand my ground in the Yu family in the future?"

By this point, this beautiful and holy-looking widow had already shed tears.

She choked up and said, "Yang Can absolutely cannot have another accident, otherwise, I will be unable to defend myself against a hundred mouths. Steward Yi, I want to personally be responsible for his safety until we safely arrive in Tianshui!"

"This..." Steward Yi showed a difficult expression.

Seeing this, Suo Chanzhi bit her silver teeth and bowed gracefully to him: "Steward Yi, if anything happens to Yang Can during this period, I will bear full responsibility."

"Please don't, please don't, Young Mistress, you must not perform such a great courtesy..."

Steward Yi quickly stopped Suo Chanzhi, glanced at Yang Can, and then hardened his heart: "Very well, this Yang Can, I will entrust to the Young Mistress!"

Yang Can was immediately terrified and quickly shouted, "You can't, Steward Yi, Steward Yi, you can't agree to her! Your subordinate will be killed by them, I'm going to die!"

Steward Yi had a pile of aftermath matters to handle and no time to listen to his noise.

Steward Yi waved his large hand and had the Suo family members take Yang Can away.

In the crowd, Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan was completely baffled by Yang Can's operation.

"Are the intestines of scholars all so winding and twisted?

Master Yang, I acted according to your plan, you must not let me down.

Otherwise, even if I, Dakuan, become a ghost, I won't let you, this deceiving ghost, off!"

It was late at night again, just like that night of the bridal chamber.

But back then, he and she were the groomsman and the bride.

Now, they were the prisoner and the judge.

Yang Can was tied up by Little Green Plum.

The little girl used all her strength, tying him so tightly that the rope was almost digging into Yang Can's flesh.

After tying him up, Little Green Plum stood guard to the side with her sword. At the young mistress's command, she would stab this bastard to death.

The young mistress had been bullied all over, and Little Green Plum couldn't stand it anymore. This kind of dog of a man, stabbing him to death would be a relief!

"Yang Can, did you kill Nanny Tu?" Suo Chanzhi stared at Yang Can and asked coldly.

By this point, if she still couldn't figure out that Nanny Tu's death was related to Yang Can, she would be too foolish.

Yang Can had no intention of hiding it from her and nodded frankly.

"You... how did you kill Nanny Tu?"

Regarding this, Yang Can just smiled and didn't answer.

No one in this world knew that he had a unique skill: "Flying Cards."

In fact, he could not only play playing cards with great flair, like flying cards to cut fruit, flying cards to cut mineral water bottles, flying cards to cut flower branches across the river...

Even a screwdriver in his hand could hit the nail exactly where he aimed.

Because of this skill, before his transmigration, he was a minor internet celebrity with a following online who liked to watch his skill-showcasing videos.

He didn't show his face, and people didn't watch for his face, but for his superb "Flying Card" technique.

After transmigrating to this world, this skill of his, which could only be used for performance, finally had a real use.

During the more than two years he spent as a laborer on the ranch, he also learned the unique skill of the northwestern shepherds: the sling.

The sling is a survival skill that every shepherd must master.

In fact, it is a throwing sling made of a rope and a leather pouch. A master proficient in it can hit a target a hundred paces away with perfect accuracy.

This kind of weapon also exists in the West. There is an ancient Greek proverb: "The heavy infantry's greatest fear is not a powerful enemy, but a shabbily dressed slinger."

The sling generates explosive force through the rapid rotation of the wrist. After Yang Can mastered this technique, his wrist strength became stronger than before, and his flying card technique also reached a new level, becoming superb.

At this time, when he calculated the unprepared, he was simply invincible.

"How did you dare? Why did you kill Nanny Tu?"

Yang Can first laughed freely, then slowly retracted his smile, his face turning cold. "Why? Does the Young Mistress... really not know?"

"I..." Suo Chanzhi guiltily avoided Yang Can's gaze.

She had planned to have Little Green Plum call Nanny Tu over tonight to try to persuade Nanny Tu to let Yang Can go.

But she didn't intend to tell Yang Can about this.

First, since it hadn't been done yet, saying it now would have no persuasive power.

Second, she didn't want to show weakness to Yang Can; she still had to establish rules for him.

Yang Can said, "Young Mistress, you don't think Nanny Tu only wanted to kill me, do you?

I dare to bet that after I die, the second person she wants to kill is..."

Yang Can looked at Little Green Plum, with her round face and a bit of baby fat.

Her willow-leaf eyebrows, almond eyes, small and well-shaped mouth, and the corners of her lips that curved up like water caltrops carried a hint of sweetness.

Yang Can said, "This Green Plum girl!"

The little maid was startled and opened her eyes wide. Huh, what does this have to do with me?

Yang Can said, "For Nanny Tu, only when both I and Green Plum are dead will this secret remain a secret!"

Little Green Plum quickly said, "She doesn't need to worry about me, I'm very tight-lipped!"

Yang Can said, "I also believe you're tight-lipped, but Nanny Tu doesn't need you to be tight-lipped. She just needs the secret to be known only by her."

Little Green Plum's mind hadn't quite caught up yet, so Yang Can explained: "That way, she can use this secret to control the Young Mistress and the child, and turn the Young Mistress and the child into her puppets."

Suo Chanzhi still didn't speak, because she had also had her own suspicions.

Just a couple of days ago, Nanny Tu had told her that she wasn't going to report this matter to the family head.

Nanny Tu said this matter concerned her reputation, and even among family, the fewer people who knew, the better.

She also told Suo Chanzhi to admonish Green Plum later, so she wouldn't slip up in front of the Suo family in the future.

At the time, she had been quite grateful for Nanny Tu's thoughtful consideration.

But after she calmed down and thought about it later, she felt something was off.

Nanny Tu was assigned to her by the main family when she married, and they had no prior relationship. Why would she be so good to her?

Once this question arose, she thought back to the night Yu Chengye died. She was full of panic and despair and had no mind to consider anything else.

It was this Nanny Tu who, racking her brain, came up with the idea of a "stand-in groom" and used both soft and hard tactics to force her to comply.

If... Nanny Tu was truly thinking of her and persuaded her to agree, that would be one thing, but why was there a need to intimidate or even threaten her?

She had intended to use this as leverage when she tried to persuade Nanny Tu to let Yang Can go tonight.

If Nanny Tu didn't agree, she would bring up these doubts to force Nanny Tu to comply, but now it was no longer needed.

Yang Can added, "By then, Nanny Tu would have the backing of the Suo family and control over the Yu family's eldest daughter-in-law and grandson. She would have the capital to be an overbearing servant who bullies her master."

Suo Chanzhi remained silent, but she completely believed Yang Can's judgment.

After a moment of silence, Suo Chanzhi said hoarsely, "Green Plum, untie him."
