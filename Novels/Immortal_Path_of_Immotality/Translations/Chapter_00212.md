# Chapter 210: Molten Gold Scorches Stone

Night fell over Wangyue City as two figures, one large and one small, clashed fiercely in the sky above.

A massive purple tentacle, over ten zhang long, writhed through the air. Its slimy, viscous surface shimmered under the moonlight, covered in eerie patterns that seemed to shift and distort. Even from a distance, cultivators who gazed at it for too long could hear sinister whispers in their ears, forcing them to look away in fear.

The other figure radiated a domineering golden aura. Every movement sent flashes of golden light scattering in all directions, their sharp, cutting energy making distant onlookers feel as if tiny knives were scraping against their skin, causing widespread discomfort.

"Beast, you're courting death!"

"Squeak squeak squeak~~~"

Old Ancestor Rongjin manipulated a golden serpent that darted through the air, searching for weaknesses in his enemy. Simultaneously, he controlled two golden hook treasures to flank the purple tentacle from both sides.

Despite the tentacle's agility, its massive size made it an easy target for Old Ancestor Rongjin's seasoned combat techniques. Dozens of bloody holes were torn into its body, eliciting pained shrieks as a rain of purple-black blood began to pour down upon the city.

The blood was clearly highly toxic and corrosive. While Old Ancestor Rongjin avoided contact, the city's cultivators weren't so lucky. Many who were struck by the droplets found their flesh melting away instantly, leaving behind nothing but pools of black sludge.

Buildings and pavilions fared no better, corroded into crumbling ruins by the acidic blood rain. Even the residential district in the northern part of the city, protected by defensive formations, couldn't withstand the onslaught. The formations flickered and failed, forcing the residents to flee for their lives.

The sheer scale of destruction shocked everyone in Wangyue City.

Naturally, this also provoked the anger of the local powers.

"Who dares to cause trouble in Wangyue Immortal City? Do you not know the rules against fighting within city limits?"

Wangyue City was a major cultivation hub, jointly established by several prominent cultivation families and loose factions. They had even formed an internal affairs council, with representatives from each faction taking turns to serve as elders and manage the city's affairs.

Seeing someone blatantly disregard the rules and wreak havoc naturally infuriated them, prompting their angry challenge.

Streams of light shot out from the city's four directions as representatives from the major families—all Golden Core cultivators—rushed to confront the troublemakers.

But when they arrived...

Their bluster quickly faded, and they fell silent.

The reason was simple.

One of the combatants was a demonic tentacle creature wreaking havoc in the city—there was no reasoning with it.

The other was a late Golden Core cultivator suppressing the tentacle.

In a way, he was helping them. If they stopped him, who would deal with the purple tentacle?

Themselves?

Looking at how the tentacle was holding its own against a late Golden Core expert, who would dare to intervene?

The Golden Core cultivators of Wangyue City collectively decided to play it safe, silently handing over the responsibility to the outsider.

But was Wangyue City really so weak that it lacked a single late Golden Core expert?

Truth be told, there had been one just a few years ago—the Old Ancestor of the Li family from the western district.

However, Wangyue City's loose coalition of factions was rife with internal strife. The Li family, with their late Golden Core expert, had dominated the city for over a century, amassing vast wealth and oppressing the other families into silent resentment.

Later, the Li family's fortunes declined. With no new Golden Core cultivators emerging among their descendants and the Old Ancestor nearing the end of his lifespan, they were forced to retreat and consolidate their power, hoping to buy time for their younger generation.

But five years ago, Lin Shan's reckless actions inadvertently summoned the phantom of the Nine Heavens Thunder Pool, triggering panic among the city's factions. They mistakenly believed the Li family's Old Ancestor was attempting to break through to the Nascent Soul stage—a development that would have allowed the Li family to dominate the city for centuries to come.

Just when they thought they could return to a balanced power structure after the Old Ancestor's death, the possibility of a tyrannical Nascent Soul cultivator emerging threatened to dissolve the council entirely, leaving the Li family in complete control.

No one was willing to accept that.

Thus, on a rainy night, six Golden Core experts stormed the Li family compound, killing the Old Ancestor—though not without losing two of their own in the process. The incident left Wangyue City's alliance severely weakened.

Now, history seemed to be repeating itself.

Another rainy night—though this time, the rain was purple-black blood.

Another late Golden Core expert—this time, Old Ancestor Rongjin from the Dai family, an external power.

The four elders of Wangyue City's council hesitated, torn between wanting Old Ancestor Rongjin to eliminate the demon and fearing the collateral damage to their city.

But reality rarely aligns with expectations.

When have Golden Core cultivators ever held back in a life-or-death battle to protect the surrounding area?

The purple tentacle, being a demonic entity, cared only for slaughter and devouring flesh to fuel its growth, with no regard for its surroundings.

Old Ancestor Rongjin fought to protect Bear Mountain Sage, a valuable asset who could secure him—and the Dai family—the favor of a Confucian powerhouse.

Neither side had any reason to relent.

As the battle escalated, the destruction spread. The council elders watched in agony as their city was torn apart—every ruined building was a financial loss.

The purple tentacle, battered and bleeding, was barely holding on. Meanwhile, toxic blood mist spread through the northern district, felling anyone who inhaled it.

Countless cultivators fled in panic.

Even Old Ancestor Rongjin began to feel dizzy, his movements unsteady. Alarmed, he noticed the tentacle absorbing the blood of fallen cultivators to heal its wounds.

He couldn't afford to drag this out.

Glancing at the buried Bear Mountain Sage below and sensing the hidden Golden Core cultivators watching from the shadows, he knew time was against him. More factions would soon arrive, making it harder to secure his prize.

He had to act decisively.

Without hesitation, Old Ancestor Rongjin unleashed a blinding golden light that illuminated the night sky.

"The great river flows east, washing away all—a single speck of molten gold scatters into countless grains!"

A faint metallic hum filled the air, growing into a cacophony of clashing stones. A river of golden sand materialized in the sky, shimmering like a celestial ribbon under the moonlight.

The onlookers stared in awe, their faces bathed in golden light.

But their awe quickly turned to horror.

A small divine ability—unleashed in the heart of Wangyue City!

The destruction would be catastrophic.

Old Ancestor Rongjin remained resolute. Securing Bear Mountain Sage was worth any cost. The damage could be blamed on the tentacle, and without the late Golden Core Li family patriarch, who could oppose him?

The council elders panicked. If this attack landed, a quarter of the city would be reduced to rubble. The reputation of Wangyue City would never recover.

"Old Ancestor Rongjin, stop!"

"Brother Dai, hold back!"

"Please, withdraw your technique—we can subdue the demon together!"

Their pleas only heightened Old Ancestor Rongjin's urgency. Fearing interference, he accelerated the formation of the golden sand river, its sharp edges humming with lethal intent.

The Dai family's metal-attribute divine ability was notoriously difficult to master, but Old Ancestor Rongjin had perfected it. What would take others minutes to prepare, he completed in seconds.

Before the council elders could intervene, the technique was fully unleashed.

The sky roared as countless grains of sand cascaded down like a molten gold storm.

"Retreat!"

The elders scrambled to escape the lethal rain.

A late Golden Core cultivator's full-powered divine ability was devastating—especially in a densely populated city like Wangyue.

Entire blocks collapsed. Streets were obliterated. Countless lives were lost.

The purple tentacle, the primary target, was shredded into a pulpy mess.

The scale of destruction left the city in shock—even Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon, watching from the western district, were stunned.

"Isn't that the same tentacle from Bianliang Camp?" the Black Skeleton Demon muttered, its bones reflecting the golden glow.

Lin Shan's heart pounded. He recognized the golden technique—it matched the Dai family's signature style. Bear Mountain Sage had indeed been captured by them.

What shocked him more was how quickly the Dai family had acted—just five days, not the ten predicted. Even more astonishing was the tentacle's growth. In less than thirty years, it had reached late Golden Core strength.

The battlefield fell silent as the dust settled.

Old Ancestor Rongjin lowered his trembling hand, satisfied with his work. The tentacle was crippled, and Bear Mountain Sage—though buried—was unharmed.

The northern district lay in ruins, littered with corpses and rubble.

The council elders were livid.

"Look what you've done, Dai Changming!"

"Our city's reputation is ruined!"

But Old Ancestor Rongjin remained unfazed. "I acted to eliminate a demonic threat. The collateral damage was unavoidable."

His explanation fell on deaf ears. The tentacle could have been subdued without such extreme measures.

Yet, with the Li family gone and the council weakened, who could challenge him?

The standoff grew tense—until a familiar shriek pierced the air.

The battered purple tentacle lashed out, striking Old Ancestor Rongjin with a thunderous crack.

"Ah—!"

Blood sprayed across the sky as the old man cried out in pain.
