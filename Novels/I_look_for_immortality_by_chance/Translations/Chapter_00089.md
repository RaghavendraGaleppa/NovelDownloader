# Chapter 89: This Guy Is Definitely Not a Good Person!

Inside the jade hall, Bian Chuyao seemed to sense something, and the smile that had been lingering at the corners of her lips stiffened slightly.

She knew that this trial shouldn’t be able to hold back a resolute cultivator.  

But to prevent interference, he had directly killed the "hostage"—such decisiveness still sent a slight tremor through her heart.  

Clearly, the other party hadn’t been affected by the illusion in the slightest, his will was as firm as could be.  

"Gu Yuan..."  

Bian Chuyao silently repeated this name in her mind.  

"It's him, it's him, Little Miss! This guy has supreme-grade spiritual sense!"  

"So scary, so scary! Back on the cloud steps, he almost devoured us!"  

"An evil dragon—his spiritual sense is that of an evil dragon!"  

"This guy is bad, really bad! Little Miss, you mustn’t choose him. If something happens in the secret ruins, he’ll definitely be the first to run!"  

"Yes, yes! This guy is definitely not a good person. Who knows how many people he’s killed behind the scenes?"  

"That’s right! He doesn’t understand how to cherish beauty at all. What a waste of such good looks."  

Among Bian Chuyao’s hair, four tiny figures poked their heads out and whispered their warnings to her through spiritual transmission.  

"No matter. Let’s observe further. Supreme-grade spiritual sense isn’t omnipotent—everything still depends on actual combat ability in the end."  

Bian Chuyao replied softly before falling silent, holding her golden seal as she calmly continued watching.  

---  

Meanwhile, the battle within the formation raged on.  

Gu Yuan’s sudden strike—slaying "Bian Chuyao"—had been swift and ruthless, catching the scar-faced Daoist off guard. Though the man dodged frantically, the peach blossom sword energy still grazed his cheek, leaving a bloody mark.  

The sword energy continued its pursuit, aiming straight for the scar-faced Daoist’s brow.  

*Buzz—!*  

But the scar-faced Daoist reacted quickly. With a flick of his magic power, a white jade lamp-shaped seal shot forth.  

A strange beam of light erupted from the seal, and the peach blossom sword energy immediately slowed as if trapped in a swamp.  

*Whoosh—!*  

At the same time, a thick mist descended, enveloping the scar-faced Daoist in an instant.  

Not only that, but within the mist, a torrential downpour fell like countless blades, "washing" over the lamp seal until its glow dimmed.  

From the first battle, Gu Yuan had realized that no magical artifacts could be used within the formation.  

To defeat his opponent, he had to rely solely on his own abilities.  

But he wasn’t afraid.  

As his cultivation advanced, the power of every seal within him had grown, allowing him to channel even more of the world’s spiritual energy.  

And since entering the Dao Academy, he had hardly replaced any of his seals—because the ones he had were already strong enough!  

---  

Back when he had entered the Scripture Transmission Hall, Gu Yuan had even been able to select the academy’s treasured sword seal, the "Golden Radiance Sword Seal." That was when he knew the token given to him by Fox Sword Sage must have extraordinary privileges.  

The *Cloud-Treading Mist Art* and *Secret Arrow Decree* he had carefully chosen were undoubtedly among the academy’s top-tier seals—ones that even disciples from noble families might not have access to.  

Especially the latter. Every time Gu Yuan used it in battle, those who witnessed it couldn’t help but pale.  

Even without magical artifacts, relying solely on his seals, Gu Yuan was confident he could secure a high ranking in the trials.  

As for the scar-faced Daoist before him? Strong, yes—but not strong enough to stop him.  

*Whoosh—!*  

The *Cloud-Treading Mist Art* blotted out the sky, turning dozens of feet around Gu Yuan into his domain.  

Unless his opponent’s spiritual sense surpassed his own or their magic power completely overwhelmed him, no one could perceive anything within the mist. All senses were sealed away.  

Meanwhile, the relentless rain, infused with the purest water-attribute spiritual energy, "washed" away all techniques that didn’t belong to Gu Yuan, severing their connection to the world and diminishing their power.  

The lamp seal restraining his peach blossom sword energy dimmed instantly.  

*Clang—!*  

The sword energy sang once more, merging with the endless rain as it shot toward the scar-faced Daoist with razor-sharp force.  

The scar-faced Daoist’s expression darkened, but within the mist, nothing could be sensed. He was as good as blind, with no idea where Gu Yuan was. He could only desperately deploy seals to defend himself.  

But a prolonged defense was bound to fail—especially when all his seals were being suppressed. How could he possibly withstand the sword energy’s assault?  

*Thud!*  

With the last of his seals shattered, the scar-faced Daoist collapsed to the ground, a gaping hole in his forehead, his face twisted with unwillingness.  

---  

Gu Yuan’s vision cleared, and he found himself standing on the thirty-seventh step of the staircase.  

By now, only five silver staircases remained in the jade hall.  

The others had already returned to their meditation cushions, faces pale with defeat.  

Of the four silver staircases beside him, the other competitors had only just stepped onto the thirty-seventh step.  

Unbeknownst to him, he had become the first to reach this stage.  

Sensing the difference, the other four turned their gazes toward him.  

Gu Yuan also took the opportunity to study his final competitors.  

Two of them wore eight-petal Daoist robes that had undergone secondary refinement—one with a "Gold" character embroidered on his sleeve, the other with a "Tao."  

The third had a green jade token hanging from his waist, inscribed with three bold, silver characters: "Law Enforcement Hall."  

The last, like Gu Yuan, had no markings on his sleeves or waist. His temples were slightly streaked with white, as if worn down by years of hardship. Though not old in age, his eyes already carried a trace of weariness.  

Gu Yuan couldn’t help but take a second look at this man.  

To reach this stage as a commoner—without the protection of a master or the support of a family—was no easy feat.  

And the way the others looked at Gu Yuan was much the same.  

"Who is that guy in the middle? A commoner, yet he surpassed even Senior Brothers Jin and Tao?"  

"I don’t know. He must be a reclusive cultivator—I’ve never seen him before."  

"Senior Brothers Jin and Tao have both mastered multiple high-level seals. How could they lose to him?"  

"Don’t even mention them—Senior Brother Luo is from the Law Enforcement Hall. His sword techniques are godly. Aside from the Golden Radiance Sword Seal, I don’t know who could match his killing speed."  

"After today’s battle, this guy’s name will spread far and wide."  

"By the way, who’s that man with the weathered temples? How did he surpass us?"  

"Senior Brother Zhang from Yuan Mountain Cave. He’s been cultivating for thirty years—his willpower is probably unmatched. I heard some elders from the Seven Peaks are considering taking him as a disciple..."  

"What? Is that true?"  

"Ah, I’m not sure... I thought I’d at least surpass Shan Yunlong, but in the end, I ended up just like him."  

"Senior Brother Shan might be a dreamer, but his strength isn’t bad. Still, I never expected the fourth trial to feature Junior Sister Bian. I didn’t have any improper thoughts about her, but the moment she cried, my heart softened, and my emotions spiraled out of control..."  

"Junior Sister Bian was just a facade. The formation amplifies whatever hesitation lies in your heart. Only those with absolute resolve, completely unaffected, can fight normally."  

"True, I saw through the illusion too, but that scar-faced Daoist’s techniques were vicious... I fought hard but still fell short in the end."  

"Enough talk. Let’s watch and see who claims the Mystic Grass this time. I’ll definitely pay them a visit afterward!"  

"For what?"  

"What else? To forge a connection! I have a younger sister, eighteen years old and stunningly beautiful. She’d be a perfect match for a rising star..."  

In the jade hall, the defeated disciples gathered and whispered, while Gu Yuan took another step forward—into his fifth battle.
