# Chapter 46: Rapid Progress  

Ten days later, Zhou Qing watched as the Bear Play technique in his Health Preservation System reached the "Proficient" level. He let out a long sigh of relief. Feeling somewhat guilty, he patted the bare trunk of the mulberry tree before fetching some discarded Qi-Blood Pills from his room and scattering them near the exposed roots.  

After all, the mulberry tree wasn't picky.  

As for how he knew the tree wasn't picky—well, he had asked, but the tree hadn't responded. That was as good as confirmation.  

The next day, after absorbing the Qi-Blood Pills, the bark Zhou Qing had worn away grew back.  

Spring was the season of growth and renewal.  

Mao Ri, his rooster companion, loved to roam around. However, since last year, Zhou Qing hadn't seen it bring back any dead snakes. He still remembered the benefits of that snake—eating it daily would have been far more effective than the Qi-Blood Pills.  

By now, the effects of the pills had noticeably diminished.  

Zhou Qing knew his body had developed a certain resistance.  

Still, he used the remaining pills to train the Bird Play technique. With their aid, his progress was slow but steady.  

Fortunately, the Crane Form technique and Bird Play shared many similarities. Practicing Bird Play also improved his swordsmanship—his wrists became more flexible, and his strikes grew increasingly unpredictable.  

Moreover, training in both Bear Play and Bird Play brought an unexpected benefit.  

Previously, Zhou Qing's right hand, trained in the Black Tiger Steals the Heart technique, had grown disproportionately strong, causing an imbalance that strained his spine. But as he practiced Bear and Bird Play, his body gradually regained equilibrium.  

The strength in both hands began to even out, though differences remained. His right hand was still stronger, but its flexibility had improved—though not yet matching his left.  

This led to subtle changes in his Finger Flick technique.  

Using his right hand, iron pellets flew faster and hit harder. With his left, he could adjust his aim mid-motion, even curving their trajectories slightly.  

*"Inhale and exhale, expel the old and take in the new, move like a bear and stretch like a bird—all for longevity."*  

Bear Play and Bird Play enriched his Qi and blood. When Bird Play reached the "Skilled" level, his remaining lifespan extended to eighty-four years—eighty-four years free of illness or pain, provided he continued practicing the Five Animal Exercises. Any latent ailments would vanish under their influence.  

Ten Qi-Blood Pills remained, but Zhou Qing decided against using them. Their effects had become negligible.  

Now, he either needed a new type of pill or had to grind Bird Play to "Proficient" through sheer effort.  

Why did everything require grinding?  

First, he had worn down the mulberry tree for Bear Play. Now, he had to grind Bird Play...  

A faint melancholy settled over him.  

As for alternative pills, he had an idea: keep the formula but replace the ingredients—specifically, find a six-leaf ginseng.  

Six-leaf ginseng was exceedingly rare, a tribute item likely found only in the imperial palace.  

The Lin family might gather some information, but actually obtaining one was beyond their means.  

The current emperor dabbled in alchemy and Daoist pursuits. If news of a six-leaf ginseng surfaced, officials would surely seize it as tribute.  

After all, no one else could refine it into Qi-Blood Pills like Zhou Qing.  

Besides, those of high status pursued power, not the elusive dream of immortality through cultivation like him. Naturally, they'd rather curry favor with the emperor.  

"Regardless, tracking down a six-leaf ginseng is more reliable than finding a new formula."  

A new formula would still require rare ingredients.  

The remaining ten pills could be traded. Powerful martial artists would surely covet them. As for Zhi Shan and the others, they were past thirty—their martial potential exhausted. Otherwise, Zhou Qing might have let them test the pills.  

Fu Song was the same.  

However, Fu Song claimed that if he perfected his "Regret the Arrogant Dragon" palm technique, he could systematize his skills and even elevate his spiritual state, possibly reaching the Xiantian realm and cultivating True Qi in this lifetime.  

Zhou Qing took his word for it.  

Without pills, progress was agonizingly slow.  

So, Zhou Qing turned his attention elsewhere—pairing martial techniques with Bear and Bird Play.  

First fists, then legs, followed by grappling, weapons, and internal arts—five in one.  

Bear Play complemented grappling techniques, while Bird Play aligned with swordsmanship, as his university instructor had mentioned.  

But first, he needed to master the "Shadowless Kick."  

The kick had been a side project during his Bear and Bird Play training, now at the "Skilled" level—close to "Proficient."  

"Brother Mulberry, I'm coming up," Zhou Qing said, bowing slightly.  

Using only his legs, he ascended the trunk almost vertically, then darted among its branches, leaves rustling softly.  

The quieter his movements, the closer his Shadowless Kick was to mastery.  

He was particularly curious about the effects of "Soul Suppression" at the "Proficient" level. Perhaps then, it could counter the two monks from Golden Light Temple.  

Fu Song held the temple in high regard. Even at its peak, Qingfu Temple had failed to drive Golden Light Temple out of Jiangzhou, a testament to its deep roots.  

The ancient temple had stood in Jiangzhou for a millennium, surviving dynastic changes. One of its martial monks even served as the chief instructor under Song He, the military commissioner of Tiannan Road, wielding considerable influence.  

Yet Zhou Qing hadn't forgotten their attempt on his life and the imperial exam.  

This debt would be repaid.  

He wasn't that forgiving.  

In the following days, Zhou Qing trained Shadowless Kick on the mulberry tree by day and studied "Soul Suppression" by night.  

Then, at the end of March, Zhi Shan came with news—a patient at Qingfu Temple required his attention.

"Handle business matters as you see fit."  

Lin Xiaojie then presented an account book detailing Zhou Qing's assets, neatly organized for his review.  

She had ordered the accountants to prepare it for his convenience.  

"There might be some discrepancies," she added. "If you're concerned, I can have it audited."  

Zhou Qing waved her off. "No need. As long as the general figures are correct. Frankly, I don't have the time to scrutinize these. Just ensure I get what I need. You know material things mean little to me."  

Lin Xiaojie noted that after becoming a provincial scholar, Zhou Qing's life remained unchanged—secluded, devoted to study and martial arts, like an ancient sage.  

Those sages had trained in martial arts too, for travel and self-defense. The world wasn't always reasonable.  

"Honorable Scholar," she couldn't help asking, "do you only care for study and martial arts? You don't seem interested in official posts."  

"What's wrong with study and martial arts?"  

"But... life offers so much more to enjoy."  

Zhou Qing smiled. "I prefer to master what I love before exploring other things."  

"You feel your studies and martial arts still fall short?"  

"By a wide margin."  

"How good is good enough?"  

"I'll know when I'm satisfied."  

Lin Xiaojie was moved. "That's admirable."  

They parted ways.  

She felt no sorrow—their paths would cross often. Strangely, she enjoyed his company yet grew restless in prolonged meetings. Each encounter left a different impression, as if he were constantly evolving into something unknowable, mysterious.  

She loved her current life. The pressure of Lin family's decline had lifted after Zhou Qing's success. She could fully express her talents.  

The Zhang family's fate served as a warning. If Zhou Qing wouldn't marry her, she might ask for his seed—though she wasn't sure of his thoughts.  

Being a concubine, or even a wife managing household affairs, didn't appeal to her. She preferred her vibrant, independent life.  

But she did want children.  

At eighteen, she could wait. Eventually, answers would come.  

---  

That night, Zhou Qing pored over the *Spring Revival Talisman Manual* by lamplight. Though he'd memorized it, holding the physical book sparked deeper insights.  

The chapter on "Soul Suppression" caught his attention.  

It wasn't about suppressing one's own soul, but a patient's. Some resisted treatment, rendering anesthetics ineffective. Thus, the manual prescribed fright—Soul Suppression.  

The technique resembled psychic power, using sound to paralyze patients with fear.  

Zhou Qing realized it could merge with Tiger's Menace for combat, delivering unexpected results. Against supernatural foes, it might outperform Tiger's Menace alone.  

Soul Suppression required vocalization from the diaphragm and Qi-blood activation.  

Closing his eyes, Zhou Qing visualized the technique's intricacies.  

After an unknown time, a tiger's roar erupted from his abdomen.  

Mao Ri, in the courtyard, cowered in a corner, trembling. Was the Tiger King undergoing a critical transformation?  

The mulberry tree's leaves trembled as moonlight pooled around it like water, its trunk quivering with fear.  

The roars continued until they ceased abruptly.  

Zhou Qing checked his Health Preservation System:  

*Soul Suppression (Beginner).*  

"So fast?"  

Upon reflection, it made sense. His Bear Play had strengthened his torso and diaphragm. His abundant Qi-blood and mental cultivation—possibly surpassing even Fu Song's—provided all the necessary elements.  

Enhancing it with Tiger's Menace made it deadlier than described.  

*If I roar like a lion, this would be another world's Lion's Roar.*  

Thoughts of Mount Wangpan, Xie Xun, and the Heaven Reliant Sword surfaced.  

He looked forward to Soul Suppression at "Proficient." Perhaps then, it could counter Golden Light Temple's monks.  

Fu Song respected the temple deeply. Even Qingfu Temple at its height couldn't expel them from Jiangzhou—proof of their enduring legacy.  

A millennium-old institution, it had weathered dynasties. One of its monks served as chief martial instructor to Song He, wielding military influence.  

Yet Zhou Qing hadn't forgotten their attempt on his life and the imperial exam.  

This debt would be repaid.  

He wasn't that forgiving.  

In the following days, Zhou Qing trained Shadowless Kick by day and Soul Suppression by night.  

Then, at the end of March, Zhi Shan came with news—a patient at Qingfu Temple required his attention.
