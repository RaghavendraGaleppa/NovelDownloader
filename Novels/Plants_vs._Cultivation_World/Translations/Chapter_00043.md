# Chapter 43: Senior Sister's Secret

"Alright!"

After thoroughly examining Yuan Niya's body, Gu Mo had determined the optimal spiritual energy vibration frequency for her physique.

"Phew~~"

Hearing Gu Mo complete his examination, Yuan Niya let out a long exhale. There had been several moments when she nearly cried out. Though she had mentally prepared herself for this when choosing to have Gu Mo perform the perfected-level Cleansing Technique's marrow-cleansing process on her, the warmth contained within Gu Mo's spiritual energy had still exceeded her expectations.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, you've been hiding quite a few secrets," Yuan Niya said as she studied Gu Mo. Having had her own secret discovered, she urgently needed to uncover some of Gu Mo's secrets. Only when both parties held each other's secrets would they have mutual restraint against revealing them.

"Senior Sister Yuan's secret isn't small either," Gu Mo hinted meaningfully. If she dared expose his secret, he would spread the word about her padded chest.

"Humph!"

Yuan Niya clenched her fists, itching to punch Gu Mo. Other servant disciples would be respectful when meeting an inner disciple like her, but Gu Mo was clearly an exception.

However, remembering she still needed his help, Yuan Niya suppressed her embarrassment and annoyance. "Well then, Junior Brother Gu Mo, let this senior sister experience the effects of your perfected-level Cleansing Technique."

"Very well."

Gu Mo nodded. This was his first time performing the perfected-level Cleansing Technique on someone else, and he was equally curious about its effects.

Channeling spiritual energy through his body, Gu Mo cast a beam of cleansing light toward Yuan Niya. As the light enveloped her, Yuan Niya felt waves of numbing soreness throughout her body. The vibrating spiritual energy continuously washed through her, shaking out impurities from within.

After fifteen minutes, the cleansing energy dissipated, leaving Yuan Niya collapsed on the ground, drenched in sweat as if she'd just been pulled from water.

Yet her eyes shone with delight. The effects of the perfected Cleansing Technique exceeded her expectations. She had researched the technique before abandoning it upon realizing she lacked talent for it.

This didn't hinder her judgment of the perfected version's effects, as the sect had detailed records from others who had mastered it. But none of those records described effects as powerful or long-lasting as what she'd just experienced.

"Senior Sister Yuan, are you alright?" Gu Mo asked with concern as he saw her sitting dazed on the ground. He had given her an enhanced version of the technique.

Normally, a perfected Cleansing Technique lasted only about ten breaths, but this session had continued for fifteen minutes. Gu Mo had increased the dosage because he realized performing it daily would require Yuan Niya to visit every day—something he couldn't accept given his many secrets, especially the sunflower's, which must never be revealed.

Alternatively, visiting her residence daily wasn't practical either. As a servant disciple, entering inner disciples' quarters wasn't easy, and he still had spirit fields to manage.

"I'm fine—better than fine!" Yuan Niya collected herself and circulated her spiritual energy to dispel the lingering numbness. She immediately noticed the difference—her energy flowed more smoothly than ever before, with effects that were strikingly immediate.

Her dramatic improvement resulted not only from Gu Mo's enhanced technique but also because Yuan Niya came from the mortal world, carrying more worldly impurities than sect-raised disciples. Gu Mo's cleansing had purged these, producing instant results.

"Junior Brother Gu Mo, I'll return in a month." After assessing her condition, Yuan Niya determined she needed at least a month to adapt to the marrow-cleansing.

She had initially worried about how to receive daily cleansing without arousing suspicion, but now the problem was solved. It occurred to her that Gu Mo might have anticipated this issue and adjusted the technique's intensity and duration accordingly—something easily achievable for someone who had mastered a technique to perfection.

Before leaving, Yuan Niya gave Gu Mo a communication jade talisman for future contact. Unlike single-use talismans, this reusable artifact was more like a magical tool—expensive for most but trivial for an inner disciple.

After confirming Yuan Niya's departure, Gu Mo replanted the sunflowers and pea shooters from the dark mist space back into the spirit fields, and returned the koi fish to their tank.

Standing before the prepared fields, Gu Mo began planting first-grade high-quality Water Spirit Rice—a task requiring precision. After using Minor Flame Wave and Minor Earth Dragon techniques to till the soil, he tirelessly cast Minor Cloud Rain spells until the fields were flooded, ready for planting.

A week later, with water now above his ankles, Gu Mo finally relaxed. Seven days of draining his spiritual energy to summon continuous rain had achieved the necessary flooding.

The submerged fields didn't affect the pea shooters, which Gu Mo had previously tested could survive partial submersion. The sunflowers, planted in isolated spirit sunflower plots, remained dry—though they too could function when partially submerged, continuing to gather solar essence. Only the spirit sunflowers couldn't tolerate flooding, hence their separation.

With preparations complete, Gu Mo planted the pre-sprouted Water Spirit Rice seedlings one by one. Unlike Jade Spirit Rice which could be broadcast sown, water rice required transplanting for optimal germination.

As ripples spread across the flooded field, inspiration struck—why not practice rice-fish farming? Immediately, he retrieved the koi from his hut and released them into the watery fields.
