# Chapter 40: Interrogation (4000 words)

"This is impossible! You're just a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator! How could you possess such strength!"

The elder of the Twin Jingsha brothers had his shoulder shattered by Jiang Li's palm strike. Kneeling on the ground with bloodied knees, his body severely injured, he couldn't stand up for a long time.

[Name: Wu Jiang, Gender: Male, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Late-stage Qi Refining, Threat Level: Medium]

[Name: Wu He, Gender: Male, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Mid-stage Qi Refining, Threat Level: Low]

(After releasing pill toxicity suppression, strength increased, threat level evaluation decreased.)

Jiang Li had just launched a sneak attack from behind, erupting with spiritual energy. Due to limited concealment abilities, he was immediately detected by the elder brother Wu Jiang, who instantly recognized his Qi Refining cultivation level.

Wu Jiang originally had the ability to dodge, but the Twin Jingsha were close brothers with deep affection. Seeing his younger brother Wu He in mortal danger and judging Jiang Li's cultivation to be limited, Wu Jiang decided to take Jiang Li's attack head-on to save his brother.

The plan was well-intentioned, and their brotherly loyalty was touching.

However, the unreasonable monstrous strength in Jiang Li's palm instantly stunned him. Severely injured in one strike, Wu Jiang immediately lost all ability to resist.

"Hah! A mid-stage and a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator—this is the famous Twin Jingsha?"

Jiang Li sneered, flicking his wrist as an iron chain shot out from beneath his black robe.

The chain moved with snake-like agility, instantly binding Wu Jiang tightly.

Jiang Li grabbed the bound Wu Jiang and walked to the black zombie. His hands moved swiftly, pulling out the six long nails embedded in the zombie's body.

Zombies hardly feel pain, and their response to physical damage is much slower than humans'. The poorly crafted "Death Gate Nails" had caused minimal harm to the zombie.

Meanwhile, the younger brother of the Twin Jingsha had already been drained to near-death by the black zombie's fangs.

Jiang Li forcibly stopped the zombie from sucking blood, sparing Wu He's life, and tucked him under the zombie's arm.

Without pause, Jiang Li and the zombie continued running in one direction, soon disappearing into the darkness.

...

[Consumed Experimental Fierce Strength Pill: Muscle Rigidity applied to self.]

[Status Muscle Rigidity has been removed.]

[Consumed Experimental Fierce Strength Pill: Fierce Strength applied to self. After effect ends, Weakness will be applied to self.]

[Fierce Strength: Temporary Strength +5, Temporary Constitution +2, Base Strength increased by 100%, Duration: 10 minutes] (-+)

[Overconsumed Experimental Fierce Strength Pill: Bloodburst Fierce Strength applied to self. After effect ends, Heart Failure will be applied to self.]

[Bloodburst Fierce Strength: Temporary Strength +10, Temporary Constitution +4, Base Strength increased by 250%, Duration: 10 minutes] (-+)

This was the source of Jiang Li's unreasonable monstrous strength.

The "Fierce Strength Pill," still in the experimental improvement phase, was refined from the useless pill recipe Jiang Li had obtained.

It could be said that the Twin Jingsha's defeat was anything but unjust.

First, the black zombie drew attention and absorbed the initial attacks, turning defense into offense.

Jiang Li himself was no weakling, and this explosive power came at the terrifying cost of "Heart Failure," granting him ten minutes of immense strength.

Fighting above his level wasn't much of a challenge, especially with a sneak attack—hence the swift victory.

Though those ten minutes would never end, and the "Heart Failure" would never come to pass.

Jiang Li had trained his body, and combined with the Fierce Strength Pill's enhancement, once he closed the distance, ordinary Qi Refining cultivators stood no chance.

The Twin Jingsha were the perfect example.

Jiang Li didn't leave the city immediately. With the black zombie in tow, he weaved through alleys, ensuring no pursuers before silently slipping into the death row prison of Yinnan Kingdom.

A handful of medicinal powder—barely qualifying as a pill, only effective against mortals—was scattered, and the once-wailing prison gradually fell silent.

Thud! Thud!

The Twin Jingsha were roughly thrown to the ground. The prison reeked of excrement mixed with dried blood.

Face-first in the dirt, Wu Jiang and Wu He struggled to turn over, desperate to free their mouths from further intimate contact with filth.

"Hey! You two! Stop playing dead! You're unlucky to have met me! Hand over everything you've got! Recite all the techniques and spells you know! Maybe I'll spare your lives!"

Jiang Li threw their own words back at them, turning the two rogue cultivators' faces pale and green with anger.

He urgently needed to know what was happening near Yinnan Kingdom, the current situation, and whether the Hidden Scripture Valley's people had arrived.

This concerned their next moves and their safety. With these two rogue cultivators delivered to him, he had a quick way to gather intelligence.

However, some people simply refuse to cooperate.

"Humph! The hunter finally becomes the hunted. Do it! If we Twin Jingsha so much as flinch, we're not men!"

"Exactly! Do it! You sect brat, how many years have you even cultivated? Think we'd fear you? Impossible!"

To Jiang Li's surprise, the Wu brothers were defiant. No matter how he threatened or coaxed, they refused to yield.

Captured and facing death, they showed no prisoner's demeanor, instead hurling vulgar insults, likely hoping to provoke Jiang Li into killing them quickly to avoid further suffering.

Jiang Li frowned, retrieved the black nails they had used earlier, and flicked them out, shattering both men's kneecaps.

This was a technique taught in the Transmission Hall.

While shattering kneecaps wasn't as effective as locking the pipa bones or piercing the qi sea in suppressing strength, it was excruciating—a method to keep cultivators conscious while enduring maximum pain.

The intense pain from their injuries left Wu Jiang trembling but silent, teeth clenched. Wu He writhed on the ground, cursing Jiang Li's ancestors with surprising vigor.

"You two are really something."

Jiang Li embedded the remaining nails into their bodies. The brothers rolled their eyes in agony but remained stubbornly unyielding.

Observing their reactions, Jiang Li realized his interrogation methods were too crude.

These desperadoes lived on the edge, always prepared to die. Once convinced of their fate, their resolve often hardened beyond expectation—since death was certain, why give the enemy any advantage?

Jiang Li understood this.

For such people, perhaps offering a glimmer of hope would be more effective.

He quickly devised a plan.

Smiling, he adopted an admiring expression.

"You know what? I admire you two."

"I like people with backbone like yours."

"You're lucky—today, I won't kill you. Don't doubt me; we can sign a contract."

Jiang Li rummaged and produced a contract paper.

These cost five spirit stones each, and he only carried one.

Initially dismissive, the Wu brothers' eyes lit up when the contract was unfurled before them.

Sign this, and they could live!

"Not only that, but because of me, you're severely injured. Other rogue cultivators would likely finish you off if you left like this, right?"

"I have this flaw—I'm too kind-hearted. Seeing you like this pains me."

Jiang Li adopted a compassionate demeanor, a complete reversal from his earlier ferocity.

"Injuries require medicine. I'll even provide pills to heal you. How's that for fair treatment?"

As he spoke, Jiang Li swiftly drafted a contract.

In essence, it stipulated that Jiang Li wouldn't kill them, would release them after two hours, and wouldn't deliberately hunt them for ten days.

The contract didn't even require the Twin Jingsha to answer questions—as if Jiang Li had suddenly decided to spare them out of sheer foolishness.

The clearly written contract lay before the brothers. They exchanged puzzled glances, unsure of Jiang Li's game.

But the contract seemed legitimate. Signing it would guarantee their lives.

The sudden prospect of survival left them hesitating in disbelief.

Ultimately, however, the temptation to live proved too strong. Using blood from their wounds, they pressed their thumbprints onto the contract.

"Excellent. Congratulations—your lives are spared."

"Now, let me treat your injuries."

Jiang Li, all smiles, produced a pouch emitting a faint burnt stench.

"No need! No need! Fellow Daoist, we have our own pills. No need to trouble you."

The Twin Jingsha waved their hands frantically, sensing danger.

Jiang Li's smile widened. See? Even their address had changed. Harmony and friendly communication truly led to mutual benefit.

"Ah, but gentlemen, you may have forgotten—your belongings were generously gifted to me earlier, weren't they?"

Jiang Li pointed to two small piles nearby.

"You! We never—"

"Wu He!"

"Right! This fellow Daoist speaks truly. We did indeed willingly offer our possessions."

The Wu brothers gnashed their teeth in fury. Those were their life savings, accumulated over years—now gone in an instant.

Such was the life of rogue cultivators: aside from a few bulky items, most of their wealth was carried on their persons.

"Since you've taken our things, and we're of no use to you, can we leave now?"

Wu Jiang, with one shattered shoulder and two broken legs, could only manage a one-handed salute, forcing politeness now that survival was possible.

"Leave? But I haven't properly treated you yet. And we still have two hours, no need to rush!"

Jiang Li unfolded the contract again, pointing to its terms.

"We don't need your treatment! Please honor the agreement and let us go!"

Wu Jiang, with one arm and two legs broken, couldn't leave on his own. The once-defiant brothers now feared for their lives after signing the contract.

"Now, now, no need for such severity. The contract is here—I wouldn't dare violate it."

"Come now, Da Lang, Er Lang! Time for your medicine!"

Jiang Li kicked them onto their backs, retrieved two foul, charred pills from the pouch, and forced one into each man's mouth. To ensure they swallowed, he used qi to push the pills into their stomachs.

Gag! Gag!

Just like Jiang Li's first experience, they convulsed violently, retching.

"Bastard! What did you feed us?"

"You promised to let us go! Breaking your word—the contract will punish you!"

Once recovered, the Wu brothers erupted in curses.

In response, Jiang Li promptly shoved two more pills into their mouths.

Their auras visibly withered.

Wu Jiang dropped to mid-stage Qi Refining, while Wu He fell to early-stage.

Both grew sallow, their foreheads darkening, appearing sickly and weak.

"I promised not to kill you and to let you go—but that's two hours from now!"

"Want to know what this is? It's good stuff!"

"Ever heard of... failed pills?"

Jiang Li elegantly produced two more failed pills, inhaling deeply. The stench was oddly addictive.

"F-Failed pills!"

"You demon! You fed us failed pills!"

The Twin Jingsha lay on the ground, despairingly condemning Jiang Li's villainy.

"Failed pills are still pills, aren't they? Still cursing me? How ungrateful!"

Another pill each, and their auras weakened further. Their qi grew sluggish and filthy, their bodies emitting a foul, burnt odor.

"Let me be clear: three failed pills' toxicity will take you at least twenty years to purge."

"Hide in a mortal city for two decades, and you might return as the Twin Jingsha."

"But take one more, and it'll be fifty years. Any more, and you'll never re-enter the cultivation world."

"A lifetime of torment by pill toxicity, living among mortals' dregs—or survive, wait twenty years, and cultivate anew?"

"I won't kill you. The choice is yours: answer my questions or not."
