# Chapter 106: Threefold Unity of Vital Energies

Upon the hastily assembled jade carriage, the Great Zhou's Founding Emperor felt the blood qi surging through him as the Dragon Scale Vine devoured demonic beasts. His physique and blood qi had already reached the third level of body refinement during this period, enough to dominate the current era.

Once he reunified the realm, he could attempt to break through to the higher martial realms mentioned by the True Person Jingyang.

Beyond the ninth layer of qi refinement lay Foundation Establishment.

Above the third level of body refinement was the forging of the Blood Qi Crucible.

This realm was also known as the "Crucible" realm.

After reaching the Crucible realm, the blood qi and true qi cultivated through body refinement would transform into true gang, with unimaginable destructive power. By then, body refiners or qi refiners below the Crucible realm would be utterly insignificant in his eyes.

However, forging the Blood Qi Crucible required not only vast amounts of blood qi but also an indomitable martial will to break through this martial heavenly barrier.

At that time, he would be able to control the Dragon Scale Vine as he pleased.

The only downside of fusing with the Dragon Scale Vine was his increasingly strong urge to "consume humans." Although devouring demonic beasts could also enhance his cultivation, powerful cultivators stimulated his appetite even more. He even felt the desire to consume his own descendants.

This was why he had let the Qinghe Prince go last time—keeping him nearby might lead to an impulsive decision to devour this great-grandson several generations removed.

This time, he would certainly not let innate martial artists like Zhang Jingxiu escape. Consuming all the innate martial artists in the world would naturally provide him with the blood qi reserves needed to break through to the "Crucible" realm.

He had heard that this so-called "Dao Court" possessed many elixirs. The young innate master Zhou Qing likely harbored many secrets. But at barely over twenty years old, his potential was far from fully realized. Consuming him and uncovering his secrets would bring unimaginable benefits.

Black clouds loomed over Jiangzhou City, pressing down as if to crush it.

The Great Zhou's Founding Emperor gazed at the city, where a towering mulberry tree rose from the ground like an imperial canopy.

What was this?

Back then, on Mount Taihe, he had been burned by fire oil and flaming arrows, yet this only deepened his fusion with the Dragon Scale Vine, enhancing his blood qi. As a fire-aligned individual, this aligned perfectly with the prophecy: "Prosper when encountering fire."

"Prosper when encountering fire, retreat when encountering mulberry!"

Seeing the towering mulberry tree, the Founding Emperor recalled the prophecy. But he felt no fear.

Turtle shells were lifeless objects, plants were ignorant, and prophecies were baseless nonsense. He would restore the Great Zhou—he was destiny itself. Why fear some dubious prophecy from centuries ago?

At that moment, Zhang Jingxiu stood ready, drawing his bow.

Whoosh!

An arrow shot forth like thunder, its explosive roar shaking the heavens as it streaked toward the Founding Emperor.

Tendrils of the Dragon Scale Vine coiled around the emperor's body, erupting with gang qi that effortlessly intercepted the arrow.

---

"Thunderclap Bow! I searched everywhere for this bow, yet it was hidden in Jiangzhou City. Where is my Heaven-Shaking Bow?" The Founding Emperor's voice boomed like thunder over the city walls.

Zhang Jingxiu signaled to Fushan, Fusong, and Xiao Ruowang beside him. The four leaped down from the walls, standing opposite the Founding Emperor.

"Not an inch of this land belongs to you anymore, let alone the Heaven-Shaking Bow," Zhang Jingxiu declared, standing tall like an ancient tree rooted in the earth.

"This is the last time you will disrespect me," the Founding Emperor said, his white hair billowing as a dragon's roar emanated from his body.

He moved like a whirlwind, crashing toward Zhang Jingxiu.

Zhang Jingxiu brandished his spear, its motion resembling a blue dragon.

Dark clouds thickened overhead, rumbling with distant thunder.

The battle had begun!

Their first clash sent shockwaves through the ground, dust billowing into the air.

In a single exchange, cracks appeared on Zhang Jingxiu's newly forged spear.

"To think you've improved so much in such a short time. Pity—you're still no match for me." The Founding Emperor clenched his fist, unleashing another overwhelming punch.

Fushan and the other two had already sprung into action.

No words were needed.

Fushan was the first to meet the emperor's fist.

Fusong and Xiao Ruowang attacked from the sides.

Zhang Jingxiu rejoined the fray.

Fusong's crescent blade moved like a dragon emerging from water, while Xiao Ruowang wielded his sword. Only Fushan, like the Founding Emperor, fought bare-handed.

But his punches carried the cry of a crane soaring beyond the heavens, striking from unexpected angles, making him the most troublesome opponent for the emperor.

The four had trained together for a long time, their energies intertwined.

"A formation?" The Founding Emperor realized mid-battle.

---

On the city walls, the Qinghe Prince asked anxiously, "Mingyue, how reliable is this Four Symbols Formation of yours?"

It turned out the four were using the "Heavenly Will Four Symbols Formation" devised by Yuan Mingyue. But even she wasn't entirely sure of its effectiveness.

"Both masters, Zhang Zhenren, and Sect Leader Xiao are innate experts. If they say this formation is useful, it must be."

The Qinghe Prince sighed and focused on the battle below, though his skills were insufficient to follow the action clearly.

Lin Wan'er had handed command of the city's heavy weapons to Yuan Mingyue. Aside from innate experts, only Yuan Mingyue could perceive the details of the battle and direct the weapons to potentially trouble the Founding Emperor.

Of course, Lin Wan'er had only dared to do this because Zhou Qing had returned.

---

As the battle intensified, the movements of the five combatants became invisible to ordinary warriors. Even Yuan Mingyue could barely perceive them.

The fusion with demonic creatures offered a great chance to break through cultivation barriers—a temptation few cultivators could resist.

Zhou Qing understood that the root of demonic chaos lay in human nature itself.

Fusing with demons and falling into the demonic path allowed rapid power growth and extended lifespan. The more one craved longevity and strength, the harder it was to resist.

But why had the True Person Jingyang, who like him had reached innate perfection without needing demonic fusion for Foundation Establishment or Crucible forging, left behind methods for demonic fusion?

Could he not see the drawbacks?

Impossible.

For now, Zhou Qing couldn't comprehend it. Only by visiting Jingyang's cave abode might he find answers.

Once he settled the Dao Court's affairs, refined the necessary elixirs, and allowed his senior brothers to fully absorb their gains, he could set out. In the meantime, Zhou Qing wanted to thoroughly review his own cultivation path from start to finish.

This was what it meant to see oneself!

"You must want to know the secrets I hold."

"Once you're dead, I'll know them naturally."

Zhou Qing struck the Founding Emperor's crown with a palm strike, extinguishing his vitality instantly. The Dragon Scale Vine burst from the emperor's body, seeking a new host. The Ironwood Sword flew out, severing the vine and extracting its blood core.

Black smoke rose from the Founding Emperor's corpse, coalescing into a vengeful soul. Zhou Qing unleashed a palm thunderbolt while the Great Mulberry Tree extended spectral branches like soul-hooking chains, dragging the thunder-struck spirit away.

This was why Zhou Qing had brought the Founding Emperor to the herb garden—with the Great Mulberry Tree present, even if the emperor had soul-escape techniques, he couldn't flee under the combined might of the palm thunderbolt and the tree's soul-hooking power.

Once the tree bore a soul fruit, Zhou Qing consumed it, nourishing his Health Preservation Master. He then began examining the memories extracted from the Founding Emperor.

"Beyond the ninth layer of qi refinement lies Foundation Establishment, while the body refinement equivalent is the Crucible. So that's how it is. Essentially, both are forms of Foundation Establishment—one focused on blood qi, the other on true qi. But as someone who has unified qi, body, and spirit in innate perfection, my foundation is the deepest and most profound."

Qi refinement and body refinement each had their pros and cons.

But Foundation Establishment achieved through innate perfection was the true foundation of the Great Dao. At the same level, it far surpassed ordinary qi refiners or body refiners.

Once a body refiner forged their Crucible, their blood qi and innate true qi would fully merge into true gang.

True gang could unleash unimaginable power through various techniques, producing astonishing phenomena.

For instance, Fusong's Eight Trigrams Dragon-Subduing Palm might genuinely manifest a dragon-shaped true gang visible to outsiders.

Regardless of actual power, it would certainly be eye-catching.

Forging the Blood Qi Crucible required not only martial will but also vast reserves of blood qi—essentially, one needed copious resources, possibly even powerful demonic beast blood as a breakthrough catalyst.

Body refiners fused with demons could bypass the need for demonic beast blood to break through this martial heavenly barrier.

From the Founding Emperor's memories, Zhou Qing learned that the True Person Jingyang's legacy mentioned that qi refiners attempting Foundation Establishment—barring extremely rare exceptions—required Foundation Establishment Pills. The primary ingredient for these pills was spiritual energy directly manifested by heaven and earth, not grown from spiritual herb seeds.

Thus, whether for qi refinement or body refinement, external aids were almost always necessary.

However, the Founding Emperor's memories also contained information about innate perfection—Jingyang had claimed that by unifying essence, qi, and spirit into innate perfection (the tenth layer of qi refinement), one could forge a Dao Crucible.

The Dao Crucible combined the Blood Qi Crucible and qi refinement Foundation Establishment.

"Then, after my Hundred Days of Foundation Establishment, I should form a Dao Crucible."

Though Zhou Qing had reached innate perfection and could begin his Hundred Days at any time, he decided it was best to first explore Jingyang's cave abode for more information before forging his Dao Crucible.

From the Founding Emperor's memories, Zhou Qing also learned about the path beyond the third level of body refinement—the Crucible—providing clear guidance for his senior brothers.

Most people couldn't balance qi and body refinement, making the body refinement path more suitable for his senior brothers.

The Dragon Scale Vine's blood core, remnants, and the Founding Emperor's corpse could all be processed further.

Though the Dragon Scale Vine was a demonic creature, it carried draconic energy. Zhou Qing planned to use its blood core as a substitute for the python-dragon inner core required for the Ascending Dragon Pill, attempting to refine a higher-grade version—perhaps called the Dragon Essence Pill.

As for the Founding Emperor's innate essence blood, Zhou Qing intended to refine it to potentially assist Yuan Mingyue in enduring heavenly thunder and breaking through to the innate realm.

The rebellion led by the Great Zhou's Founding Emperor had drawn out all manner of dark forces. The Dao Court seized the opportunity to conduct a major purge.

Meanwhile, Jiangzhou had been nurturing talent over the years. After the purge, these talents would fill the vacancies across the realm.

Additionally, martial lecture halls were flourishing everywhere.

The Dao Court's control over the regions steadily strengthened.

With the promulgation of the Martial Canon, local monopolies on martial techniques were shattered, giving commoners avenues for advancement. Under the Dao Court, society began to shed the old and embrace the new, flourishing vibrantly.

"This is an era of peace unseen in centuries," Fushan marveled.

Zhou Qing shook his head. "There is no true golden age—only that the people live slightly better now. With upward mobility unlocked, everything appears prosperous. But in time, those who rise will once again block the paths for others."

"Then we'll just break through again," Fusong said.

Zhou Qing smiled. "What if those monopolizing the paths are our own people? What if they're the disciples of you senior brothers, Brother Zhang, or Sect Leader Xiao?"

Fushan fell into deep thought.

Zhang Jingxiu cut through the hesitation: "Kill anyone who obstructs the Dao Court's progress. Even if it's one of us old men."

His words cleared the air.

Everyone nodded.

Zhou Qing thought to himself, "What if one day it's me standing in the Dao Court's way?"

He didn't voice it, knowing that as long as he didn't descend into endless slaughter, he wouldn't harm those around him. The Founding Emperor's fusion with the Dragon Scale Vine, to the point of craving his own descendants, served as a stark warning.

The fusion with demonic creatures offered a great chance to break through cultivation barriers—a temptation few cultivators could resist.

Zhou Qing understood that the root of demonic chaos lay in human nature itself.

Fusing with demons and falling into the demonic path allowed rapid power growth and extended lifespan. The more one craved longevity and strength, the harder it was to resist.

But why had the True Person Jingyang, who like him had reached innate perfection without needing demonic fusion for Foundation Establishment or Crucible forging, left behind methods for demonic fusion?

Impossible.

For now, Zhou Qing couldn't comprehend it. Only by visiting Jingyang's cave abode might he find answers.
