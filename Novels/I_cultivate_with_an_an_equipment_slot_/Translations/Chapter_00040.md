# Chapter 40: A Thousand Acres of Spiritual Fields  

With just one sentence from the female Daoist, Zhang Yan's heart jolted. For a moment, he feared his golden finger had been exposed.  

But upon reflection, the Law Enforcement Elder at the market was also at the Golden Core stage and hadn't noticed his Equipment Bar. So, it likely wasn't that.  

Before Zhang Yan could guess her intentions, the female Daoist stood up and stepped forward, appearing right in front of him in an instant.  

"Your Wood Elemental Art has reached perfection, hasn't it?"  

"Yes... it has," Zhang Yan admitted, his initial nervousness dissipating as he nodded obediently. To demonstrate, he cast the Wood Elemental Art again—this time in its perfected state.  

Seeing this, the female Daoist's pupils dilated slightly.  

"You're young, yet you understand the value of hiding your talents. A promising seedling indeed." Her expression softened with approval. "Though your spiritual roots are mediocre, achieving perfection in a technique at such a young age means your future is boundless. Concealing your abilities is wise for self-preservation, but there's no need for such caution before your master." She gave a slight nod.  

"Disciple Zhang Yan pays respects to Master!" Seizing the opportunity, Zhang Yan immediately bowed in reverence.  

Pleased by his quick wit, the female Daoist smiled faintly.  

"Since you wish to enter my tutelage, you should know my name. I am Zhuge Wan, Peak Master of the Wood Spirit Peak. Once the formalities are complete, you will be my thirteenth direct disciple."  

"Yes, Master." Zhang Yan nodded obediently.  

"Good. For now, find a residence on Wood Spirit Peak to settle in. I will inform the Sect Leader to arrange your initiation ceremony." Zhuge Wan waved her hand dismissively.  

Zhang Yan hesitated slightly.  

"Is there something else?"  

"Nothing major... I was just thinking about leasing some spiritual fields..."  

"Leasing fields?" Zhuge Wan chuckled. "No need for that. Take my decree—your senior brother Mu will allocate 2,000 acres of mid-grade spiritual fields and 100 acres of high-grade ones to you."  

"Two... two thousand acres? Mid-grade? And a hundred acres of high-grade?" Zhang Yan was momentarily speechless.  

"Thank you, Master!" Overwhelmed with gratitude, Zhang Yan could hardly believe his luck. The sheer value of these fields was worth tens of thousands of spirit stones—and they weren't just temporary leases. They were outright given to him!  

Even after leaving the hall, he still felt dazed.  

What Zhang Yan didn't know was that as he departed, Zhuge Wan clenched her fist in excitement. "To perfect a technique in less than a year—what kind of prodigy is this? To think I, Zhuge Wan, have taken such a monster as my disciple!"  

Clearly, the satisfaction was mutual.  

Outside, Mu Sen was already waiting.  

"Weren’t you supposed to fetch tea from Elder Wei? You returned so quickly?" Zhang Yan couldn’t help but admire Mu Sen’s speed—truly befitting someone with perfected flying boat techniques.  

Mu Sen rolled his eyes. "There is no Golden Core elder surnamed Wei in our Qingheng Sect."  

"But since you called him 'Elder Wei,' does that mean Master agreed to take you as a disciple?" A rare smile appeared on Mu Sen’s typically expressionless face.  

"Yes. Master said she’d inform the Sect Leader for the initiation ceremony. Oh, and she told you to allocate me 2,000 acres of mid-grade fields and 100 acres of high-grade ones."  

Mu Sen: "......"  

"What? An initiation ceremony? And she gave you 2,000 acres of mid-grade fields? Plus 100 acres of high-grade ones?!"  

Mu Sen couldn’t contain his shock. He stepped forward and pinched Zhang Yan’s cheeks.  

"Senior Brother, what are you doing?" Zhang Yan struggled free, bewildered.  

"Checking if you’re wearing a disguise. You don’t resemble Master at all—are you her secret love child?" Mu Sen lowered his voice conspiratorially.  

Zhang Yan: "..."  

"Master is a woman."  

"Right." Mu Sen smacked his own forehead, then sighed enviously. "Junior Brother, you’ve become a rich man overnight. You’ll have to look out for me in the future!"  

Truthfully, Mu Sen was green with envy.  

These fields weren’t just a one-time windfall—they represented a steady source of income. The profits from cultivating spiritual herbs would sustain Zhang Yan’s cultivation indefinitely. Even if he chose not to farm, leasing the land would earn him a substantial yearly sum.  

Mu Sen had assumed Zhang Yan would start as a nominal disciple, only becoming a direct disciple after reaching Foundation Establishment. But here he was, not only accepted directly but also lavished with gifts before the ceremony—there would undoubtedly be more to come.  

At this moment, Mu Sen’s envy deepened.  

"Senior Brother, you jest. I owe everything to you. If you ever need anything, just ask." Zhang Yan spoke earnestly, his gratitude genuine.  

Mu Sen had been his first benefactor in the Qingheng Sect. The talisman Mu Sen had given him had saved his life during a crisis, and when danger struck again, Mu Sen had rushed to his aid without hesitation. If Mu Sen ever faced difficulties, Zhang Yan would undoubtedly help.  

Mu Sen laughed heartily. "Good! With those words, I’m satisfied."  

He had spoken casually, but Zhang Yan’s sincerity touched him. No one liked an ungrateful person, after all.  

"Come, Junior Brother. Let’s go claim your fields."  

Mu Sen clapped Zhang Yan on the shoulder.  

"Right!"  

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Yan felt a surge of anticipation.  

Two thousand acres of spiritual fields...  

Just how vast was that?  

And a hundred acres of high-grade ones!  

From now on, Zhang Yan would be a true landowner!
