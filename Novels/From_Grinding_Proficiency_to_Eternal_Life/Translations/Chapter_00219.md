# Chapter 219: A Single Thought Turns Heaven and Earth

Xu Yunfan fell from the nine-foot high platform, his body twitching slightly, sparks flying from his seven orifices.

The blue bricks beneath his feet had already melted into crimson liquid. The extreme heat even made the dark golden dragon scale armor glow golden. Even with Xu Yunfan's formidable physique, how could he survive within this magma-flowing armor?

Zhan Yan felt immense regret welling up inside him, tears welling in his tiger-like eyes. He never imagined that a momentary lapse in judgment would lead to such a situation.

Although he had devoted his entire life to weapon forging, he had never managed to forge a divine weapon. Now, he had committed a grave taboo.

Hearing the cracking sounds coming from Xu Yunfan's body and catching a faint scent of roasted meat, Zhan Yan felt a sense of death in his heart.

He no longer held back and stepped forward, trying to find a way to remove the dragon scale armor.

"Whoosh!"

A breath resembling molten lava erupted from Xu Yunfan's throat, scorching Zhan Yan's hair and eyebrows and splitting his skin. Though shocked, Zhan Yan did not hesitate.

"Master... stop!"

A hoarse voice rumbled from Xu Yunfan's throat, forcing Zhan Yan to halt his movements, afraid that he might cut off Xu Yunfan's vitality.

Just then, from within Xu Yunfan's charred body, wisps of mysterious ice energy seeped out from the gaps between the scales, rapidly lowering the temperature of the scorching lava aura to a controllable range.

Although the temperature was still terrifying, it had finally dropped.

At this moment, the Extreme Dao Remnant Vest worn by Xu Yunfan began to seep out wisps of coldness.

This vest, made from the physical skin of an Extreme Dao powerhouse excavated from the Source Ancient Jade Wall in the Eight Hundred Miles of Wasteland Ice Plains, finally revealed some of its divine properties.

It could be seen that the skin was now clinging to his spasming back muscles like a woman's soft hand, its moving texture still retaining the smooth feel of its former owner.

This Yin-cold energy actually managed to suppress the bloodthirsty ferocity of the dragon scale golden threads.

The two forces collided violently within his flesh and blood, causing the surrounding molten rock to instantly freeze into frost.

Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes and looked down at the skin-tight dragon scale armor on his body. Before he could take a few steps, a low, rumbling sound like a dragon's roar suddenly echoed in his mind, causing his temples to throb.

Without the slightest hesitation, Xu Yunfan formed a hand seal.

"Lin!"

The moment the Lin Seal was formed, the chaotic emotions in his mind quickly calmed down, and the ringing in Xu Yunfan's ears stopped abruptly.

The surging waves in his Sea of Consciousness seemed to be frozen by thousand-year-old ice. All scorching panic, confusion, and hesitation were frozen inch by inch under an ancient seal technique.

He felt his soul detaching from his Niwan Palace, like a sword胚 soaked in a cold pool after the flesh was stripped away. The seven emotions and six desires turned into sparks during the forging process, extinguishing one by one in the blue ice flame.

The chaotic mist in the depths of the Sea of Consciousness churned, and his Ego Spirit, emitting a faint light, walked out from within, taking control of the center of the Sea of Consciousness, stabilizing all defenses.

The Ego Spirit floating in the center radiated a glazed luster. The originally turbulent emotions froze into frosty ripples beneath its feet. With every ripple that spread, a will that condensed into almost tangible form would unsheathe itself from the void with a clang.

The Ego Spirit raised its head slightly, its eyes flickering with a trace of Xu Yunfan's spiritual light.

Just then, the Red Python broke through the mist, carrying a blood-red tidal wave. Broken dragon tendons twisted into purple-black knots on its spine, and hundreds of deep wounds exposing bone writhed with a dark green pus.

Most terrifying were its empty eye sockets. Two clusters of ghostly blue flames flickered within the skull, each flash leaving a scorched mark on the ice.

Xu Yunfan's Ego Spirit raised its right hand, and the frozen Sea of Consciousness rang with the clear sound of a jade chime.

"Suppress."

Twelve starlights transformed into seal script chains that pierced through the python's body, each chain end hanging a bronze bell. When the Red Python struggled, the Taotie patterns on the bell faces would open their giant mouths to bite the dragon scales, while the thunder patterns settled inside the bell would crawl along the chains and cover the python's body.

The pus in the python's wounds suddenly boiled, condensing into blood-red talismans in an attempt to counterattack.

Seeing this, the Ego Spirit formed the Lin Seal with its left hand and pressed it against its brow. The frozen ripples instantly surged into a thousand-zhang ice peak. The towering mountain shadow crashed down, suppressing the blood-red talismans and the python's head together under the glacial ice.

A faint sound of bones shattering came from deep within the ice layer. The Red Python's residual soul turned into wisps of青烟, greedily devoured by the Taotie on the bell face.

*'You used the Lin Art. The Ego Spirit emerged from the Purple Mansion, subdued the evil python's will, and refined it. Your proficiency in the Lin Art has greatly increased.'*

*'You used the Lin Art. The Ego Spirit...'*

The moment this evil python's will was shattered and refined by the Ego Spirit, a large block of proficiency for the Lin Art appeared on Xu Yunfan's vision, showing a near-explosive increase.

Before he could react, the 431 points of proficiency needed were fully completed in this moment.

*'Your Lin Art has reached Minor Achievement.'*

*'Lin Art 0/1000 (Minor Achievement)*

*Special Effect: Mirror of the Divine Altar, Unflickering Heart Lamp, Soul Stabilization and Spirit Anchoring, Mustard Seed Observation, Thousand Mechanisms Locking Soul, Cicada's Awakening, Intent Probing Three Zhang.'*

In an instant, a cool sensation filled his head, spreading throughout his entire brain.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and took a long breath. In an instant, ten thousand sounds turned into silver needles piercing his Sea of Consciousness.

The underground magma ten zhang away emitted a sound like tearing silk. The sulfur scent was decomposed into seven different levels of sour bitterness in his nasal cavity. Even the scorching particles floating in the air caused ripple-like sensations on his skin.

His eyelashes suddenly trembled. A bubble was forming in a certain part of the lava underground river.

Before that bubble could float to the crimson surface, he already heard the tight humming sound of the water film's surface tension and smelled the hydrogen sulfide about to burst within the bubble.

What shocked him the most was that with a flick of his mind, his consciousness spread out like a spider web. In an instant, everything within three zhang was clearly visible, imprinted in his heart.

The gradually cooling magma beneath his feet, the dragon scale armor on his body moving with his breath and the heaving of his chest.

Suddenly, he sidestepped half a step. A splash of molten rock just missed where he had been standing.

His muscles tensed even before his divine sense could react. The Cicada's Awakening effect of the Lin Art, similar to a sixth sense, had planted a warning in his body.

At this moment, his Divine Altar was like a transparent glazed lamp, holding a mirror that could magnify grains of sand into mountains. Even the heat waves rising from the magma surface were transformed into the trajectories of ten thousand golden snakes dancing wildly in the mirror. The end of each trajectory extended three possible branches.

"Yunfan, how are you?"

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes and looked at Zhan Yan's concerned gaze, the wrinkles on his face trembling as he spoke, the slight contraction of his pupils due to the changing light, the saliva spraying from his mouth...

The strange phenomena around him receded like a tide, and his perception quickly returned to normal.

Although this super-sensory state allowed him to be fully aware of everything within three zhang around him, and nothing could escape his perception, if he remained in this state for a long time, not to mention whether his spirit could withstand such high-frequency consumption, just the slightest movements in his surroundings could cause him considerable trouble.
