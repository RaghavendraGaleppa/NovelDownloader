# Chapter 77: Blowing Away All the Mist

Qin Ming gazed at the night sky, silently pondering.

The main body of his memories had returned; only some details remained blurry.

"If my guess is true, then without me, Qin Ming, there would be a Zhang Ming, a Zhao Ming, and so on. The Cui family needed an 'identity' to stand there."

Qin Ming stood by the window, feeling a little chest tightness.

"The rise of the Li family, and their sudden collision with a thousand-year-old aristocratic family, certainly has nothing to do with me. The Cui family couldn't have predicted such a scene ten years ago."

Qin Ming mused that his role in the Cui family should have reached its end, originally meant to conclude. This final stage, happening to coincide with the Li family's assault, allowed him to be carried along with the momentum.

Clearly, in such a massive and terrifying clash between the Cui and Li families, he originally had no part, but it just happened that he encountered it, allowing him to exert his "remaining energy."

He, like those old men, was destined to be consumed.

But the old men of the Cui family had all voluntarily embarked on that path, knowing that it was a journey of certain death. They were already close to death from old age and were willing to give their last bit of light and warmth for the Cui family.

Qin Ming’s heart was filled with indescribable emotions, various feelings swirling within him.

"Every year when spring blossoms, they would receive a special letter…" Qin Ming first sensed something was off from this.

It was the same every year. Reading the letter was when Father Cui and Mother Cui were happiest. Even Father Cui, who was so strict and even rigid, would show an undisguised smile.

"One of those years, I vaguely heard something, but it was too long ago. I didn't seem to pay attention to that detail back then." Qin Ming frowned.

However, he was currently undergoing his fourth rebirth, which had not yet ended, and there was still hope of recalling even the minute details.

"The fourth rebirth relates to the five senses, subconscious, and instinctive intuition." Qin Ming felt that he could completely tear open the veil of the past.

He had already noticed that the spiritual substance consumed this time was truly excessive.

"If I hadn't entered the Thunderfire Alchemy Palace and continuously endured six or seven waves of heavenly light impact, gaining a large amount of extremely special and rare spiritual substance, my rebirth this time might have been a bit turbulent."

Qin Ming realized that the injury to his head was more serious than he had imagined, otherwise he wouldn't have been on the verge of death, suffering complete amnesia. Fortunately, after this rebirth, all problems would be completely resolved.

"Healing old injuries, plus rebirth, I've consumed double the spiritual substance." He had a premonition that this rebirth should be more intense than ever before.

"Perhaps when I wake up tomorrow, all those blurry areas in my mind will become completely clear." Qin Ming suddenly realized that he hadn't even eaten, having shut himself in his room for an entire day.

He got up and went out, eating some simple food.

That night, as Qin Ming fell asleep, golden needles threaded across his entire body, weaving and intertwining, as if mending him. At the same time, silver paste covered him, enveloping him from head to toe, like the final application of a powerful medicine.

The fractured part of his skull was no longer specifically targeted; the hidden danger had clearly been completely eradicated.

Qin Ming entered the final stage of his fourth rebirth.

In the middle of the night, he woke up drenched in sweat, muttering unconsciously: "I am Qin Ming, I have a grandfather, I am not a member of the Cui family."

He calmed down. This scene felt familiar, very familiar.

Qin Ming got up and sat still. Then he remembered that he had woken up like this in a household in Silver Vine Town. That time, he had frantically run out, rushing into the icy, snowy world, shouting and yelling.

"I was severely injured in the head by Li Qingxu, and was unconscious for a long time. Cui Hong and the woman with the red mole on her right eyebrow arranged for me to be in Silver Vine Town. I survived that winter, but I almost went crazy…"

Qin Ming pondered. Two years ago, he had been plagued by nightmares in his hazy state, seeing his childhood self and his grandfather. That's how he learned his name was Qin Ming. Had the rebirth method on the silk scroll worked then?

He lay down and quickly fell asleep again, reliving the dreams from two years ago.

"Not dreams, but my childhood experiences." Qin Ming's subconscious was still active.

In these dreams, he confirmed that the old man was his grandfather, and his own name was indeed Qin Ming.

"Child, the method on the silk scroll really doesn't work. Grandfather has practiced his whole life and never succeeded." The old man sighed, but still opened the silk scroll for him, explaining page after page.

His true family, knowing that this method had problems, although explaining it to him, also seriously warned him that practicing it would hinder his own development.

The old man said, "I've practiced it my whole life, and pondered it my whole life. I suspect that to succeed, one might need to die once, but not truly and completely die. This degree is simply impossible to grasp."

Qin Ming's grandfather softly said, "What is rebirth? Perhaps to be born from death is the first step."

Qin Ming, more than ten years ago, was too young to understand how difficult and dangerous that was.

Then the old man shook his head again, saying, "This is just a crazy thought from an old man like me. After all, those past sages who obtained the silk scroll were far more powerful than me, yet they couldn't make it work. Even the source of that silk scroll, the original people and their disciples, didn't they all die, leaving the silk scroll completely dust-covered and impossible to practice anymore?"

"Grandfather, when I succeed, you won't have to suffer anymore. I want to take good care of you." The young Qin Ming said naively.

"Alright, then you must grow up quickly. Life at seventy is rare since ancient times. Grandfather is already over fifty. With our conditions, I can live ten more years at most." The old man stroked his head, with both doting affection and worry. He said, "You are what worries Grandfather the most. What will you do if I'm gone? You're still so small, you can't support yourself."

The old man felt a pang of sorrow, saying, "Grandfather's whole life has been delayed by the silk scroll, dedicating all my heart to it. I've lived a very unsuccessful life. Now that I'm here, although you wear ragged clothes, at least you can eat your fill. If I feel I'm not doing well, I'll find a good family for you."

"Grandfather… only ten more years? I don't want that. You can live a hundred years! I'll grow up very soon." Qin Ming pulled the old man's rough hand, and finally asked, "Where are my parents? Let them come take care of Grandfather."

The old man was very disappointed upon hearing this. He said, "They, ah, were also delayed by the silk scroll. To practice the methods on it, they've traveled far away. Counting the time, they might not be around anymore, probably passed away even earlier than Grandfather. I don't want to hide it from you, because Grandfather doesn't have much time left. You need to mature early and be strong, so you can survive when Grandfather is no longer here."

"Grandfather, when I grow up, I'll support you. What do you like, what are your wishes? Quickly tell me!" Childhood Qin Ming urged, his eyes red.

"Grandfather used to want to master the method on the silk scroll. Now, I only wish for you to grow up safely. Everything else doesn't matter."

…

In the morning, Qin Ming woke up and murmured, "Grandfather, where are you now?"

More than ten years had passed. He sat there for a long time, motionless, before finally speaking: "My last relative is also gone?"

"Grandfather, you guessed right. One must die once to master the method on the silk scroll. I can fulfill all your wishes. I really want to see you again." Qin Ming said softly.

He got up and rinsed his body with cold water. The fourth rebirth was completely finished. Not only was his consciousness clear and he recalled various past details, but he also felt that his physical qualities had improved again.

"I might now have nearly five thousand jin of strength. The severe head injury had a huge impact on me. The reason so much spiritual substance was consumed this time was not just to heal old wounds, but also to make up for the regret that several previous rebirths were incomplete due to injuries."

Qin Ming pondered, estimating based on the current situation, if his head had not been injured, he should have been able to lift a tripod of over one thousand two hundred jin during his first rebirth.

With the hidden danger resolved, he felt light and relaxed from head to toe, feeling stronger.

However, thinking of his grandfather and the Cui family's affairs, he found it difficult to smile.

"After I entered the Cui family, those direct descendants personally taught me to write down the name 'Cui Chonghe,' making me remember it firmly. For a long time, I had no contact with outsiders."

Qin Ming recalled the details from back then. He had once heard people whispering in the mansion: "He does look somewhat similar."

In fact, the entire Cui family had never told anyone that he had ever been lost. Young Qin Ming had even had some doubts about this.

Now it seemed he was a "seamless replacement." Someone had just left, and he arrived, taking that person's place.

No wonder his older brother, Cui Chongxiao, who was mature beyond his years, showed an unusual expression when he first saw him, examining him carefully. Now it seemed everything had been foreshadowed.

Subsequently, Qin Ming also recalled a "detail" from when his parents received a special letter.

Now, after his fourth rebirth, with the mist blown away, he could see clearly. Recalling that unusual occasion, Father Cui and Mother Cui were extremely happy and excited, and had whispered while holding the letter: "Chonghe is precocious, with divine talent…"

Such thoughts sent a chill down his spine, because there really was another Cui Chonghe!

Stunning individuals like Li Qingxu, Li Qingyue, and the direct daughter of the Wang family were only taken in by outsiders and accepted as disciples after they were teenagers.

But the real Cui Chonghe was sent away at the age of three or four!

"Just how terrifying was his talent? Perhaps some of what Cui Second Master said when he was drunk was true, but it shouldn't have been applied to me; it should have been attributed to the real Cui Chonghe, destined to be 'near immortal' in the future."

Qin Ming believed that the old senior Father Cui spoke of, who was famous in the Night Mist world, must exist, and Cui Chonghe had already become his disciple.

"Father Cui and Mother Cui were incredibly cautious. Big Brother Cui Chongxiao only returned once every few years. They didn't allow clan members to discuss which lineage Big Brother had joined, fearing trouble."

Cui Chonghe's talent was even more astonishing, so he would naturally be protected even better, with no hint of his whereabouts revealed.

In fact, these things were understandable.

Because all the great aristocratic families were sending their descendants to the 'outside world.' Just like the Cui family, every year there were young direct descendants who joined the sects of the 'outsiders.'

And some of the old men of the Cui family were originally 'outsiders' themselves, living there year-round. It's likely that many powerful figures from other great families were also in the 'outside world.'

One could say that place was not a pure land; the various family powers within those Daoist traditions were intertwined, with each within the other.

Father Cui and Mother Cui were afraid that if someone knew Cui Chonghe's identity, he might be "targeted" and that something might happen to him there.

Therefore, they raised another Cui Chonghe here.

"Carefully selected, my appearance might even bear some resemblance to his."

Qin Ming believed that given Father Cui and Mother Cui's caution, it would be abnormal for them not to do something to protect the real Cui Chonghe.

"Two years ago, Cui Chonghe might have been exposed, or perhaps he became fearless and was about to step into the limelight, truly appearing before everyone. So, it was time for me to make my exit."

Qin Ming recalled the past, his eyes growing incredibly deep.

"When the Cui family and Li family clashed, I was just there to exert my remaining energy." He thought of Seventh Uncle's grandfather.

"If Seventh Uncle's grandfather hadn't been in that village, I might have been taken away by several other old men before the Feathered Robe Youth Li Qingxu even appeared."

Qin Ming clearly remembered that Seventh Uncle's grandfather had twice reprimanded those old men, telling them to stay away and not to approach.

And without Seventh Uncle Cui Hao, Cui Hong and that woman probably wouldn't have appeared and saved him.

"Although there are still some things I'm confused about, this is generally how it should be. Everything is because I completed my 'mission' and it was time for me to leave the stage; the near-immortal Cui Chonghe was about to step into the spotlight."
