# Chapter 40: Array Battle Against a True Disciple

"Array, activate!"

Above Skull Mountain Market, the Hundred Bones Reversion Array, now fully restored, rumbled into motion, instantly startling Wu Zhichong and Duanmu Yuan, causing them to retreat. Seizing this opening, Lu Yuanchun transformed into a streak of blood-light and darted through. The array patterns outside the grand array parted in response, allowing Lu Yuanchun passage, then swiftly reclosed, their speed leaving no opportunity for outsiders.

"Many thanks for your assistance, Brother Lu..."

Landing within the array, the blood-light dissipated, revealing Lu Yuanchun's disheveled appearance. A hint of shock and uncertainty still lingered on his pale face: "Brother Lu, you're actually an Array Master?" Had he not been an Array Master, how could he have re-established the array and resolved such a fatal predicament?

"You flatter me, Senior Brother. I'm merely a ninth-rank Array Master," Lu Yang said with a faint smile. "It took several days of study to barely unleash this grand array's power."

Lu Yang spoke casually, but Lu Yuanchun's face was filled with solemnity. Among the hundred arts of cultivation, the Way of Arrays reigns supreme! The value of a late-stage Qi Cultivation cultivator and a late-stage Qi Cultivation Array Master is incomparable; the latter can almost be regarded as a Qi Cultivation Completion cultivator!

"Speaking of which, Senior Brother Lu, you seem to have reaped quite a harvest this time."

Lu Yang looked at Lu Yuanchun with a half-smile, and under his gaze, Lu Yuanchun's expression gradually stiffened, cold sweat trickling down his face. However, the very next second, he regained his composure.

"Brother Lu, I've kept the 'Profound Yin Primordial Jade' safe for you for a long time. It's time for it to be returned to its rightful owner today!" With that, Lu Yuanchun directly took out a small box. Upon opening the lid, a white jade, strikingly human-like with seven orifices, lay within.

As the saying goes, a wise man knows when to yield. Lu Yuanchun was an old disciple of the Saint Sect and naturally understood that if he didn't hand over the treasure jade now, he would surely perish on the front lines of the righteous-demonic battlefield later. Furthermore, with the Divine Martial Sect deploying a Great Perfection Qi Cultivation expert, escape was impossible. Lu Yuanchun no longer harbored any illusions. Rather than keeping the treasure, it was better to hand it over publicly. On one hand, it could be seen as spending money to avert disaster; on the other, it would shift the attention of the Divine Martial Sect and its allies onto Lu Yang.

"The Profound Yin Primordial Jade..."

Lu Yang nodded in satisfaction at the sight, then put the small box into his storage bag. He turned, his face calm, to look at the figure that had suddenly appeared outside the market. It was a handsome young man wielding a spear. He wore a martial crown and scaled armor, and his long spear was engraved with dragon patterns. He looked less like a cultivator and more like a general from the mortal world.

"A ninth-rank Array Master?" The young man's gaze was sharp as a blade, seemingly able to pierce through the grand array's concealment and directly see Lu Yang, who was controlling it. "I didn't expect such an unforeseen variable."

At the same time, 'Divine Fist' Wu Zhichong and 'Mountain Mover Daoist' Duanmu Yuan approached, each bowing respectfully to the spear-wielding youth. "Senior Brother Ouyang, we were inefficient in our task and have disappointed you."

"It's fine." Ouyang Haoze shook his head, his expression mild. "Demons are cunning; it's normal for you two junior brothers to have had some oversight. Just make up for it with meritorious service from now on."

With that, he looked back at Skull Mountain Market, his eyes glinting with killing intent. "Our sect has schemed for many years; we cannot tolerate any mishaps. If possible, it's best to first eliminate the Demonic Sect's foothold here to minimize variables."

The next second, Ouyang Haoze's figure flickered, and his Great Perfection Qi Cultivation aura fully unleashed. Instantly, a towering aura of essence-qi shot straight up, manifesting earth-shattering battle cries, as if thousands of armored warriors were arrayed behind Ouyang Haoze, bolstering his spirit, energy, and vitality.

"Break for me!"

In an instant, a thunderous roar echoed through the air, directly slamming into Skull Mountain Market. A few cultivators of lower cultivation instantly vomited blood, shaken by the furious shout.

"Great Perfection Qi Cultivation..."

Lu Yang, controlling the array, wore a grave expression. The peak of the Qi Cultivation realm, this level not only symbolized cultivation but also status within major sects. If they were further valued by a True Man, they would undoubtedly become a True Disciple of the sect!

The Divine Martial Sect, located in the Northern Frontier, though far smaller in scale than the Saint Sect, also possessed several astonishing great divine abilities that only True Disciples were allowed to cultivate.

"If he possesses a great divine ability, I'll abandon the array and run immediately..."

While preparing to escape, Lu Yang moved to the edge of the array, confronting Ouyang Haoze across the barrier. "I am Lu Yang. May I know your name, fellow Daoist?"

"You are not worthy of knowing my name," Ouyang Haoze sneered. "If you know what's good for you, surrender now. In that case, I might show some mercy, merely crippling your demonic cultivation rather than taking your lives. But if you choose to resist stubbornly, not even a chicken or dog will be left alive when this array falls!"

"When will this cycle of vengeance ever end?" Lu Yang's smile remained unchanged, his tone gentle. "Though our two sides, righteous and demonic, are distinct, we have always kept to our own paths. Why not give me some face?"

"Give you face?" Ouyang Haoze burst into laughter, scoffing, "What arrogant words! You're merely at the eighth layer of Qi Cultivation. Even if I refuse to give you face today, what can you do?"

"Why bother..." Lu Yang shook his head. "Since that is the case, then please, fellow Daoist, come and break the array."

"Courting death!"

A flash of killing intent appeared in Ouyang Haoze's eyes. The towering essence-qi around him retracted entirely as he unleashed a punch that, at first glance, seemed no more than a mortal's martial art. However, Lu Yang's expression subtly hardened at the sight. Not daring to be negligent in the slightest, he immediately conjured his Blood Sun Sword Pellet, then merged with its sword-light and slashed at Ouyang Haoze. In that instant, fist and sword clashed, and an unparalleled sharpness of qi and punch force exploded outwards, like sparks blossoming in mid-air.

Ouyang Haoze's figure was like lightning, delivering hundreds of punches in the blink of an eye. The Divine Martial Sect differed from other cultivation sects; body cultivation was dominant, and most of their divine abilities focused on fist and foot techniques. Their close-quarters combat speed even surpassed that of sword cultivators!

"Chaos Arrow Strike!"

Ouyang Haoze spread his arms wide, as if drawing a great bow. Then, his fist-shadows, like a barrage of arrows, instantly submerged Lu Yang's position.

*Boom!*

Amidst the explosive roars, Lu Yang felt as if all the spiritual energy around him had been drained, replaced by endless fist-shadows that sought to grind him to dust! A thousand strikes in an instant, leaving no room for counterattack—it was clearly a superior divine ability! Although Ouyang Haoze spoke arrogantly and seemed to disregard Lu Yang, when he truly engaged, he showed not the slightest carelessness, going all out.

In an instant, explosive waves of qi surged and tumbled. Under his barrage of fist-shadows, Lu Yang only lasted less than ten seconds before being shattered into pieces. His sword-light dispersed, transforming into skeletal remains scattered across the sky in the blink of an eye.

The momentum of the fists abruptly halted. Ouyang Haoze stood in the air, his brow slightly furrowed. Meanwhile, above the market, the Hundred Bones Reversion Array was still operating. A figure materialized from thin air, stepping out, revealing none other than an unharmed Lu Yang.

"Fellow Daoist's fist might is unparalleled; I am impressed."

Ouyang Haoze did not respond, launching another punch, still the Chaos Arrow Strike. Lu Yang continued to resist stubbornly, enduring for over ten seconds before being shattered once more. Yet, in a flash, Ouyang Haoze saw Lu Yang's corpse turn into skeletal remains, while a perfectly unharmed Lu Yang stepped out from within the array, his wide sleeves fluttering, his demeanor unchanged. Not even a shred of his true qi or magical power seemed to have been depleted. He cupped his hands in a salute: "Fellow Daoist, do you wish to fight again?"

"...The Hundred Bones Reversion Array truly lives up to its reputation." Ouyang Haoze's expression grew solemn. As far as he knew, this array was ranked seventh-grade and contained a hundred skeletal soldiers. A cultivator within the array could use the bodies of the skeletal soldiers to manifest a hundred percent of their true combat strength. In this way, it was equivalent to the skeletal soldiers fighting in place of the main body. If they won, everyone rejoiced. If they died, it had no effect on the main body. Furthermore, as long as the array continued to operate, the skeletal soldiers could quickly recover even if they were expended. Thus, no matter how fiercely he attacked, it would be in vain, a futile effort. This was also because he was outside the array and hadn't rashly charged in. Otherwise, once he entered, Lu Yang could summon all the skeletal soldiers for a direct group assault, and even a Great Perfection Qi Cultivation expert would be stripped of a layer of skin!
