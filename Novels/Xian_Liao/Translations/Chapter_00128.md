# Chapter 128: Fusong's Responsibility

"Fellow Daoist, I had no intention of fighting. Let us reconcile." The golden light did not engage in a spiritual clash with Zhou Qing's divine sense, instead adopting a defensive stance.

Although Zhou Qing was eager to test the strength of a Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator, Jin Guang's divine sense remained withdrawn, showing no openings. Continuing the confrontation would be pointless.

In any case, with Jin Guang's retreat today, unless a Golden Core-level expert intervened, no one would dare cause trouble at the desolate ridge market again.

He withdrew his divine sense, only releasing an overwhelming sword intent.

Jin Guang was visibly unsettled. He could sense the sword intent but couldn't see the sword itself, which could only mean one thing—Zhou Qing's sword was a life-bound magical artifact, integrated into his very being.

A swordsman who had merged his sword with his body was far more formidable than an ordinary sword cultivator.

Moreover, with Zhou Qing's Thousand Illusions technique masking his true strength, and the natural charisma of his Soul Bewitching Art that made others more inclined to like him, Jin Guang found it difficult to maintain any hostility once he decided against further conflict.

He spoke up, "Might I ask, how should I address you, Fellow Daoist?"

"Qing Lingzi, a mere wandering cultivator from the wilderness," Zhou Qing replied.

Jin Guang had already guessed as much. After all, someone of such extraordinary ability would have to be a hidden wandering cultivator for him not to know of them. Even among the four great demonic sects, a cultivator of such prominence would have surely come to his attention.

"A mere wandering cultivator reaching such heights must have encountered great fortune—likely inheriting an ancient cave abode. That docile wood-attribute demonic plant at the desolate ridge must be part of his inheritance. Could it be from the ancient Azure Wood Sect?" Jin Guang mused to himself, drawing on his extensive knowledge.

He said aloud, "Fellow Daoist, today's incident was indeed due to my and Fellow Daoist Ye's lack of proper investigation before rashly intruding. My deepest apologies."

Zhou Qing responded, "You may leave, Fellow Daoist. However, my senior brother's foundation was damaged by Fellow Daoist Ye. What do you propose we do about that?"

Fusong immediately caught on. His previously vigorous aura now weakened, his complexion paling as he feigned extreme frailty. "Qingzi, I was severely injured by that Yin Shade energy. My life's essence has been damaged—I fear my path to the Dao is now hopeless."

Jin Guang's lips twitched. Did they think he was blind?

But he knew they were indeed in the wrong today. If a full-blown battle erupted, even if they could gain the upper hand, it would be a pyrrhic victory at best. Moreover, with the beast tide imminent, a fight between two Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivators would surely anger Patriarch Xuan Tian.

Though he couldn't discern Zhou Qing's exact cultivation level, Zhou Qing's divine sense was no weaker than his own. Combined with his status as a sword cultivator who had merged his sword with his body, it was undeniable that Zhou Qing possessed combat strength at the Foundation Establishment Perfection level.

While Jin Guang had been at the peak of Foundation Establishment for many years and had numerous trump cards, the current situation made a life-and-death battle impossible. Thus, with Zhou Qing clearly intending to extort compensation, Jin Guang had little room to refuse.

"What do you propose?" he asked, leaving the terms to Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing remained silent.

Fusong, understanding the cue, raised two fingers.

Jin Guang's expression shifted slightly. "Two thousand?"

Fusong thought to himself, "A Foundation Establishment cultivator offering only two thousand spirit stones? How cheap can you get?"

Below them, Ye Chong, having broken free from the divine sense suppression through some secret technique, snapped, "Two thousand mid-grade spirit stones could buy your entire market! Still not satisfied?"

Fusong: "..."

One mid-grade spirit stone was equivalent to a hundred low-grade spirit stones.

Fusong realized he had misunderstood. But it wasn't entirely his fault—after all, he only received a hundred spirit stones annually from Zhou Qing.

Zhou Qing had explained that with their current struggles to establish themselves and rebuild, resources were tight. Zhou Qing himself only took one spirit stone per year as a symbolic gesture.

Thus, Fusong had intended to demand an exorbitant twenty thousand low-grade spirit stones as compensation for his "injuries."

Little did he know he had vastly underestimated the wealth of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Zhou Qing spoke calmly, "In addition to two thousand mid-grade spirit stones, I also want Fellow Daoist Ye's cultivation method for the Profound Yin Ghost Shade. Otherwise, Fellow Daoist Jin may leave, but Fellow Daoist Ye will have to stay."

Ye Chong retorted, "Don't push your luck!"

Zhou Qing replied evenly, "If our positions were reversed today, Fellow Daoist Ye would surely have demanded far worse."

Ye Chong's expression flickered with uncertainty. After a brief exchange of silent communication with Jin Guang, he slumped in resignation. "Fine, have it your way. You cultivate thunder techniques anyway—I stand no chance against you regardless."

Zhou Qing smiled faintly. "Furthermore, Fellow Daoist Ye must swear a Dao oath. Otherwise, this humble Daoist will find it hard to rest easy."

Ye Chong wanted to argue, but after another whispered exchange with Jin Guang, he reluctantly complied. The terms of the oath left no loopholes—any attempt to seek revenge against Zhou Qing or his associates would trigger backlash, making further cultivation breakthroughs impossible.

Ye Chong handed over a jade slip containing his Profound Yin Ghost Shade technique, along with the spirit stones. As he didn't have enough stones, he had to supplement with other cultivation resources, depleting most of his savings.

With that, Ye Chong and Jin Guang took their leave.

---

As they neared Xuan Tian City, Ye Chong asked, "Brother Jin, what exactly is that guy's background?"

Jin Guang shook his head. "Hard to say. Fellow Daoist Ye, you're lucky to be alive today. Since you've sworn the Dao oath, abide by it—don't even think about seeking revenge."

"Brother Jin, is he really stronger than you?"

Jin Guang sighed, producing a small insect that lay limply in his palm. "My Devouring Shade Insect is highly sensitive to baleful energy. That Qing Lingzi's sword aura was thick with killing intent—he's undoubtedly a ruthless individual. Think about it: a wandering cultivator of such strength, yet completely unknown. What does that tell you?"

Ye Chong inhaled sharply. Even as one of the "Three Fiends of Xuan Tian," the realization sent a chill down his spine. If such a dangerous figure remained unknown, it could only mean one thing—those who had seen him fight were all dead.

Had Jin Guang not intervened today, he would never have made it back alive.

Jin Guang continued, "Fortunately, I have some reputation and am held in high regard. That's likely why Qing Lingzi was willing to avoid a fight to the death. Moreover, the desolate ridge is only five hundred li from Xuan Tian City. With the beast tide approaching, any intense battle would draw Patriarch Xuan Tian's attention. Qing Lingzi must have considered this before agreeing to reconcile."

Ye Chong nodded slowly. "That man keeps a low profile, running an underground market. I thought he was just an ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivator at best—never imagined he'd be so formidable."

Jin Guang said, "Your infamous reputation isn't necessarily a good thing, Fellow Daoist Ye."

Ye Chong fell into thoughtful silence.

---

"Qingzi, you're just letting them go like that?" Fusong asked cheerfully as he counted the spirit stones and resources, unable to hide his delight.

Zhou Qing ignored him for the moment, turning instead to Immortal Luo and the others. "Today's events have humiliated Jin Guang. If you spread word of this, you'll only make enemies of the Jin family. While I have no fear of the Jins or any other family, you..."

Immortal Luo immediately grasped his meaning. "The senior makes a valid point. It's best not to speak of today's matter."

Zhou Qing added, "Not that you should remain entirely silent. Simply say that Jin Guang and I exchanged insights on the Dao, each benefiting from the discussion."

This way, the desolate ridge market would gain a reputation for having an incredibly powerful Foundation Establishment cultivator, deterring troublemakers, without painting Zhou Qing as a vicious figure.

Moreover, Ye Chong, having suffered such a loss of face, would be unlikely to speak of the incident.

After giving his instructions, Zhou Qing took Fusong back to the water manor.

Fusong asked, "That Jin Guang is known as the strongest below the Golden Core realm. How do you compare?"

"About equal," Zhou Qing replied.

Fusong gave him a strange look.

Zhou Qing clarified irritably, "Both of us are pure gold."

Fusong grinned. "So you're saying you're practically invincible below the Golden Core realm now?"

Zhou Qing said, "It's hard to say without testing it, but no one below Golden Core can kill me. The beast tide is still a year away—until then, with no Golden Core experts intervening, it's a perfect opportunity for us to train. You should use this time to push for a breakthrough."

Fusong declared, "Don't worry. If I hadn't been off my game today, that Ye Chong wouldn't have stood a chance."

Zhou Qing rolled his eyes. If there was one thing Fusong excelled at, it was talking tough.

He said, "Actually, I've been thinking—refining demonic creatures into one's body shares similarities with absorbing Yin Shade energy. You could try condensing some Profound Yin Ghost Shade first, to get a feel for what refining a demonic creature might be like."

He had promised to find a suitable demonic creature for Butcher Hu to refine, but Fusong's demon-seeding was equally important. With Fusong's talent, he would likely peak at the Melting Pot stage without undergoing the transformation to achieve a "True Body" comparable to the Golden Core realm.

Zhang Jingxiu had the Great Pine, but both the Great Pine and the Great Mulberry were rare finds, obtained through sheer luck. Zhou Qing had tried using branches from the Great Mulberry to awaken other demonic plants, but the results were nowhere near as effective.

He suspected it was because the Great Mulberry had been in its early developmental stage at the time, and the Great Pine, while extraordinary, was a weaker version of the Great Mulberry by coincidence.

Even so, the Great Pine's Yin energy wasn't pure, containing significant baleful energy.

Thus, finding another Great Pine for Fusong would be difficult. As for Fushan's pear tree, it also carried the risk of baleful energy. But Fushan, through years of alchemy, could use his innate True Fire and earth flames to neutralize the baleful energy. Moreover, Fushan's comprehension of the Dao through alchemy far surpassed Fusong's.

Therefore, for Fusong to achieve greatness, he would need to focus on refining beast-type demonic creatures, which would grant him true power.

Fusong said, "I'll follow your lead."

Zhou Qing: "..."

While others relied on their elders, his second senior brother leeched off everyone—young and old alike.

In his youth, he relied on Fushan; in his old age, he relied on his junior brother.

---

A few days after the market incident, a message arrived from Xuan Tian City—a nominal disciple of Patriarch Xuan Tian delivered a letter.

"Qingzi, what does Patriarch Xuan Tian want?" Fusong asked.

Zhou Qing handed him the letter.

After reading it, Fusong learned that Patriarch Xuan Tian intended for the desolate ridge market to participate in the defense against the beast tide. Specific arrangements would require discussions within Xuan Tian City.

Fusong said, "Junior Brother, I'll go to the city in your place."

Xuan Tian City remained unfamiliar territory for them.

Zhou Qing knew the market incident couldn't be hidden from Xuan Tian City's higher-ups, but he hadn't expected it to draw Patriarch Xuan Tian's attention.

He said, "Senior Brother, at worst, we can abandon the desolate ridge market and find another place to develop."

After all, they had offended Jin Guang and Ye Chong, making it impossible for Zhou Qing to enter Xuan Tian City himself.

Ye Chong had sworn a Dao oath, but Jin Guang hadn't.

Zhou Qing couldn't guess whether Jin Guang might seek to restore his pride.

Fusong shook his head. "With Patriarch Xuan Tian in Xuan Tian City, developing nearby is far better than venturing elsewhere. Otherwise, we'd have to contend with either demonic sects or powerful demonic beasts. If something happens to me, you mustn't reveal yourself."

Melting Pot cultivators unified spirit and flesh. Unless Patriarch Xuan Tian himself intervened, no one could force Fusong to talk.

But Patriarch Xuan Tian, a figure who had guarded humanity for three centuries with his city, was no petty villain.

Thus, Fusong's going to Xuan Tian City in Zhou Qing's stead was entirely feasible.

Seeing Zhou Qing hesitate, Fusong added, "The Dao Court can survive without me, but not without you. As long as you don't go, my going alone should be safe. Patriarch Xuan Tian has devoted himself to cultivation, focusing solely on protecting Xuan Tian City. In centuries, he's never acted cruelly. Since he's invited us to discuss matters, there's likely little risk."

Zhou Qing knew Fusong was right. Abandoning the desolate ridge market would be easy, but finding another suitable place for their development wouldn't be simple.

Beyond the relative safety of Xuan Tian City's vicinity, the rest of the Jingyang Dao Domain was fraught with unknowns. Moreover, the spiritual materials required for Lung Metal Thunder wouldn't be easy to find on his own.

Establishing ties with Xuan Tian City would make locating such materials far simpler, given the city's resources.

The difference between cultivating the Five Organs Thunder with and without the corresponding spiritual materials was like night and day.

And with Fusong going in his place, they could adapt flexibly to any situation.

"Senior Brother Fusong, go ahead," Zhou Qing said.

He understood this was Fusong's role—handling the Dao Court's external affairs. Zhang Jingxiu was the Dao Court's foremost enforcer under Zhou Qing; Fushan handled alchemy and guarded the mortal realm; Xiao Ruowang managed spirit fields and balanced the various branches.

Yuan Mingyue researched formations.

External matters naturally fell to Fusong.

As for Zhou Qing, he was the foundation of the Dao Court's existence.

Fusong knew well that the Dao Court could survive without anyone else—but never without Zhou Qing.

In fact, for all of humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain, the Dao Court and Zhou Qing were their true hope.

Fusong smiled faintly. "Qingzi, going to Xuan Tian City isn't as dangerous as accompanying you to Changzhou for the imperial exams. Do you know? Back then, I was far more afraid than I am today. I knew trouble would find us on the road. And at that time, we were still ordinary mortals—so many things could harm us."

He paused. "Yet I decided to go anyway. Do you know why?"

Zhou Qing shook his head.

"Because I, too, refused to be ordinary."

With that, Fusong departed gracefully.

---

A day later, Fusong returned unharmed.

"Did you meet Patriarch Xuan Tian?"

"No. This meeting was chaired by Patriarch Xuan Tian's eldest disciple, Shang Zijian. He's an honest, pragmatic man who values the bigger picture. He even offered to mediate if Jin Guang caused any trouble for us." Fusong recounted his experiences in Xuan Tian City and the city's plans for the beast tide.

The meeting included not just representatives from the desolate ridge market but also several solitary Foundation Establishment cultivators from the wilds, all invited to Xuan Tian City.

Fusong also brought back two sets of spirit armor.

Xuan Tian City was determined to minimize casualties during the beast tide while reaping enough benefits to fuel their development over the next decade.

Zhou Qing examined the spirit armor—it was comparable to high-grade defensive robes, though less durable and irreparable once damaged.

Even so, it was incredibly valuable.

With his All-Seeing Eyes, Zhou Qing found no hidden flaws in the armor—a genuine gesture of goodwill from Xuan Tian City.

Moreover, Fusong's participation in the meeting went smoothly.

He even encountered Jin Guang, who feigned warmth and concern.

Fusong played along politely but remained wary, deflecting the old man's overtures with tact.

Xuan Tian City's intention was for the desolate ridge to form a pincer with the city.

However, the city wouldn't station people there. Instead, within Shang Zijian's authority, the desolate ridge would receive whatever resources it needed.

This beast tide was unlike previous ones—Foundation Establishment cultivators would be the main force. Shang Zijian even granted Fusong temporary free access to the city.

---

In Xuan Tian City, within Patriarch Xuan Tian's secluded cave abode.

Shang Zijian stood outside, bowing respectfully.

Only here could one truly sense the immense yet weary aura of Patriarch Xuan Tian. Shang Zijian sighed inwardly—his master's presence had grown even more aged.

"Zijian, you've worked hard," a weathered voice echoed from the cave.

"Master, it is my duty."

"If not for these mundane burdens, you would have reached Foundation Establishment Perfection by now."

Shang Zijian replied, "Master, I chose this path willingly. Only this way can you focus entirely on breaking through to the Nascent Soul realm."

The weary voice sighed. "The Nascent Soul realm is no easy feat—my chances are slim. All these years, I've been practicing the Yin-Yang Divine Light left behind by Senior Jingyang. But without forging a Dao Furnace, and relying solely on the Vajra Arts to achieve a True Body, I could never reach Senior Jingyang's level. Still, it's enough to ensure that before my death, I can take at least three late-stage Golden Core demon lords with me. Heh..."

Shang Zijian felt a pang of sorrow—his master had sacrificed so much for humanity in the Jingyang Dao Domain.

After a moment of reflection, Patriarch Xuan Tian asked, "Did you meet that new Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator?"

"No. His senior brother came instead."

"He didn't come? A cautious one, then. That's good. I hear he's young yet prudent. If he reaches the Golden Core realm in the future, such a man could be humanity's hope in the Jingyang Dao Domain after I'm gone. But let nature take its course."

Shang Zijian said, "From my investigations, this Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator goes by the Daoist name Qing Lingzi. He's likely the one who killed Huang Wenxiang. But upon closer scrutiny, Huang Wenxiang was colluding with demonic beasts and harming other cultivators during past beast tides—he deserved death. The Blood Demon Sect is also investigating Huang Wenxiang's death."

"Mm. Let the matter of Huang Wenxiang rest. Ensure the Blood Demon Sect finds nothing, to avoid complications. I hope to live long enough to see this young man break through to the Golden Core realm. Then, I might have the pleasure of meeting him." Patriarch Xuan Tian's voice carried a note of quiet anticipation.
