# Chapter 67: Thunderstruck News  

"Truly worthy of being an advanced-tier spell!"  

After reading through the jade slip, Chu Ning's eyes gleamed with excitement.  

If he first restrained his opponent with Thorn Binding and then followed up with the Verdant Wood Sword Art, the sustained damage would be...  

Of course, the Verdant Wood Sword Art had its shortcomings—its burst damage was lacking.  

This was a notable difference between wood-element spells and metal- or fire-element spells.  

However, for Chu Ning, this flaw was easily overlooked.  

After all, this was the first advanced-tier primary spell in his cultivation journey!  

Memorizing the key points of the technique, Chu Ning stored the jade slip back into his storage pouch.  

Then, chanting the incantation and forming hand seals, he pointed forward.  

In the next moment, a faint green sword-shaped spell shot from his hand, striking the Ironvine nearby.  

Upon impact, over a dozen Ironvine tendrils were severed instantly.  

The green sword radiance didn't dissipate until it had cut through nearly twenty tendrils.  

Seeing this, Chu Ning was momentarily stunned.  

Not because he had successfully cast the Verdant Wood Sword Art on his first try—given his deep mastery of the Verdant Wood Spring Art, mastering this wood-element spell quickly wasn't particularly surprising.  

What truly astonished him was that this single strike, despite being his first attempt and far from the spell's full potential (evident from the faintness of the green radiance), had still effortlessly sliced through twenty Ironvine tendrils.  

This was vastly more powerful than his strongest Blade Wind Technique.  

"It seems I underestimated just how formidable the Verdant Wood Sword Art is!"  

Chu Ning's surprise soon gave way to exhilaration.  

The "lack of burst damage" was only relative to metal- or fire-element spells of the same tier—or perhaps in comparison to its own sustained damage potential.  

But this was an advanced-tier primary spell!  

Its offensive power was naturally far beyond that of the low-tier Blade Wind Technique.  

Originally planning to practice the Verdant Wood Sword Art in his courtyard, Chu Ning immediately changed his mind and headed outside.  

His courtyard wasn't suitable for this—his carefully cultivated Ironvine would be reduced to shreds in no time.  

Arriving at the back mountain, Chu Ning practiced without restraint.  

One Verdant Wood Sword Art after another lashed out, reducing the surrounding Ironvine to scattered fragments.  

With each cast, his speed increased, and the green radiance of the sword technique grew more vivid.  

Thanks to his innate Wood Spirit Body and his mastery of the Verdant Wood Spring Art (now an innate ability), his proficiency in the Verdant Wood Sword Art improved at a visible pace.  

Over the following days, Chu Ning alternated between practicing talisman-making and refining the Verdant Wood Sword Art.  

Both skills advanced rapidly.  

Fifteen days later, he had achieved a 60% success rate in crafting all five talismans recorded in the jade slip.  

Unsatisfied, he spent another ten days in relentless practice, pushing the success rate to nearly 80%.  

This progress delighted him—especially since he had simultaneously honed the Verdant Wood Sword Art during those twenty days.  

Though he couldn't yet cast the advanced-tier spell instantaneously, its full destructive power was now at his command.  

Given his talent, instant casting was only a matter of time.  

Of course, this month of intensive training had demanded immense effort.  

Aside from occasional visits to the Talisman Pavilion for guidance and a brief chat with Qiu Shunyi, Chu Ning had devoted himself entirely to cultivation.  

But today, his secluded training came to an abrupt halt.  

The previous afternoon, He Changyou had sent a message talisman instructing him to meet early the next morning—presumably to discuss future arrangements.  

Though the meeting was set at the Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning didn't dwell on it.  

As a dual-hall disciple, he assumed He Changyou and Liao Yunming would jointly assign him tasks.  

When he arrived, he spotted the two elders in the main hall and promptly bowed.  

Before he could even steady himself, He Changyou's next words struck him like a thunderbolt.  

"Chu Ning, you're likely aware that many disciples are being assigned sect missions lately.  

"Both the Herb Hall and Talisman Pavilion are short-handed. After discussing with Elder Liao, we've decided to send you on an external mission."  

Chu Ning felt as if the sky had fallen.  

*Have they discovered my concealed cultivation level? But even if they have, I'm only at Qi Refinement fifth layer!*  

*Didn't they say only those at sixth layer or above would be assigned that mission?*  

His mind raced, a chill creeping into his heart.  

At that moment, it was as if he had plunged into an icy abyss.  

Ever since learning from Shang Zhaoxiang about the sharp decline in outer disciples due to sect missions, Chu Ning had regarded these tasks with deep suspicion.  

Zhuang Yunde's more detailed account only heightened his wariness.  

Though Zhuang Yunde mentioned that some disciples returned and even became inner disciples, this only deepened Chu Ning's unease—because it also implied many had perished, including outer disciples.  

*How could I, a disciple of less than two years, be assigned this? Is it because I recently became an outer disciple?*  

He Changyou's single sentence shattered the joy he'd felt upon joining the outer sect.  

Yet, thanks to his two lifetimes of experience, Chu Ning maintained his composure.  

Despite the turmoil within, his expression remained calm.  

Suppressing his unease, he feigned confusion.  

"Elder, I'm only at mid-stage Qi Refinement, and I've been in the sect for such a short time. Must I really go on a mission like the senior disciples?"  

"Naturally!" He Changyou nodded.  

"Though your time here has been brief and your cultivation modest, your skills in herb cultivation and talisman-making make you an ideal candidate."  

Chu Ning wanted to argue but found no grounds.  

However, when Liao Yunming spoke next, his eyes brightened with realization.  

*Wait—this doesn't sound like what I was thinking.*
