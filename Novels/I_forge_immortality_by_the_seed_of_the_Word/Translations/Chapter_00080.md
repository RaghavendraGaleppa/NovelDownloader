# Chapter 79: One Month Later  

Another month passed in the blink of an eye.  

Thanks to the ample supply of water-attribute spirit medicines and the terrifying cultivation speed of the *Ocean-Subduing Dragon Devouring Void True Art*, Zhang Jing successfully broke through to the sixth level of Qi Refinement on a dark and windy night.  

The cost, however, was that his stock of water-attribute spirit medicines was nearly exhausted.  

This cast a shadow over Zhang Jing's heart.  

He had originally thought that the medicines would at least last him until the seventh level of Qi Refinement.  

Now, it seemed he had been overly optimistic.  

Of course, part of the reason was the *Ocean-Subduing Dragon Devouring Void True Art* itself.  

The quality of his spiritual power was simply too high.  

As a result, advancing the same level of cultivation required far more resources.  

That day, Zhang Jing stepped lightly out of his cultivation chamber.  

By now, he had mastered perfect control over the draconic strength hidden within his body. Even though his body was as heavy as iron, not a single footprint was left behind as he walked.  

Passing by the spirit herb garden—  

"Master, the spirit herbs I planted have sprouted!"  

Lu Thirty-Eight suddenly poked his head out, unable to contain his excitement.  

"Thirty-Eight, you've broken through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement?" Zhang Jing asked with pleasant surprise, ignoring the previous statement.  

"Thanks to you, Master! The spiritual energy here is so abundant—I just slept and somehow broke through by accident," Lu Thirty-Eight replied cheerfully.  

"That's great! Congratulations!" Zhang Jing nodded with a smile.  

A breakthrough in cultivation was excellent news!  

This meant he no longer had to worry about Lu Thirty-Eight struggling to carry him.  

Entering the spirit herb garden, Zhang Jing saw dozens of young sprouts growing inside.  

As if remembering something, he turned to Lu Thirty-Eight and asked, "Thirty-Eight, where’s that piece of cloth fragment I asked you to keep?"  

"Right here, Master!"  

Lu Thirty-Eight shook his head vigorously, and soon, a piece of cloth fell from the crown-like antlers on his head.  

Zhang Jing caught it effortlessly.  

The once unbearably heavy fragment now felt weightless in his hands.  

He walked to the center of the herb garden, gently dug into the soil, and buried the cloth fragment.  

Instantly, he sensed wisps of spiritual energy gathering toward the spot.  

"It's working!"  

A faint smile appeared at the corners of his eyes.  

Lu Thirty-Eight, standing nearby, also seemed to sense the change and grinned widely, revealing two rows of large, white teeth.  

"Thirty-Eight, the herbs should grow faster from now on. Make sure to take good care of them."  

"Once these herbs mature, they might just be enough to trade for your cultivation technique."  

Zhang Jing encouraged.  

"I understand, Master! I swear I’ll take care of these herbs!"  

Hearing that these herbs were tied to his future cultivation method, Lu Thirty-Eight’s voice grew fervent.  

He stood up, his large eyes shining like bright lanterns as they scanned the spirit herb garden.  

Seeing this, Zhang Jing said nothing more and quietly left the cave dwelling.  

It was time to visit Senior Brother Li.  

---  

**Luodu Tower**  

The same quiet chamber as before.  

"Haha, Junior Brother, you’ve truly surprised me this time! In just over a month, you’ve jumped from the fifth to the sixth level of Qi Refinement. Impressive!"  

Senior Brother Li wore a delighted smile.  

Though he had confidently urged Zhang Jing to reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement before the opening of the *Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven*, only he knew how much confidence he truly had.  

But now, witnessing Zhang Jing’s rapid progress firsthand, Senior Brother Li finally felt somewhat reassured.  

He made a silent decision—if Zhang Jing needed it, he would increase the resource support once the latter broke through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement.  

After all, cultivation speed slowed down the further one progressed, especially in the later stages of Qi Refinement.  

But with nearly sixteen months remaining, Zhang Jing’s demonstrated speed—if backed by sufficient resources—made success highly plausible.  

The only uncertainties, and the most critical points to watch, were the two major bottlenecks: between the mid and late stages of Qi Refinement, and between the ninth and tenth levels.  

Thinking of this, Senior Brother Li frowned slightly.  

He looked at Zhang Jing, lips pressed together as if carefully choosing his words.  

Across from him, Zhang Jing also sensed the sudden shift in atmosphere.  

After a long pause—  

"Junior Brother," Senior Brother Li said softly, "your next step is to break through to the seventh level of Qi Refinement. There are some things you should know."  

"Please enlighten me, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing felt a hint of tension.  

"This is the barrier between the mid and late stages of Qi Refinement—a major transformation. Hitting a bottleneck and being unable to progress is normal. You mustn’t rush. Stay calm!"  

"Time is tight, but impatience will only hinder you."  

"If you encounter difficulties, come to me."  

Senior Brother Li spoke succinctly.  

"Understood. Thank you, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing expressed his gratitude.  

Bottlenecks were the least of his worries.  

With the *Pure Origin Spiritual Light*, *Crimson God Spiritual Light*, his previous enlightenment, and the purified spiritual energy from the *Five Treasures Spirit River*, Zhang Jing faced no real bottlenecks in Qi Refinement.  

All he needed was resources—vast amounts of them.  

As the two conversed, another figure appeared at the chamber’s entrance.  

"Senior Brother Li—oh, Junior Brother Zhang? You’re here too?"  

Senior Brother Li’s voice carried a note of surprise.  

"Greetings, Senior Brother Li."  

Zhang Jing turned and greeted him with a smile.  

Seeing Senior Brother Li’s arrival, he guessed the two captains had matters to discuss.  

Since Senior Brother Li had already given him this month’s *Water Essence Pills*, there was no reason to linger.  

With that in mind, he rose and said politely,  

"Senior Brothers, I’ll take my leave now."  

"Take care, Junior Brother."  

"Take care."  

Only after Zhang Jing had left did Senior Brother Li turn to Senior Brother Li, his voice low.  

"Senior Brother, now that the Langya Demon Uprising has ended, the inner court has allocated a batch of resources as rewards. But the specific distribution among the top ten squads requires discussion with the other nine captains."  

"What’s there to discuss?"  

Senior Brother Li’s brow furrowed slightly.  

"By convention, Panlong, Yanxia, and Luodu each take twenty percent, while the remaining seven squads split the rest equally. Has something changed?"  

Senior Brother Li nodded gravely, concern etched on his face.  

"Apparently, the other squads’ shares remain unchanged, but Panlong and Yanxia each want twenty-five percent, so..."  

"On what grounds?"  

Senior Brother Li’s voice turned icy.  

"They claim their two prodigies are guaranteed entry into the *Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven*, but the resources needed to nurture them are immense. They want to 'borrow' five percent from Luodu, since we don’t have such training obligations."  

He paused before adding,  

"Since Chen Xiandao and Shen Qingqing will enter the inner court in a year or two, the other seven squads don’t want to offend them now. Since their shares aren’t affected, they’re staying neutral."  

Senior Brother Li relayed all he knew.  

"And the inner court’s stance?"  

"Ambiguous."  

Silence filled the chamber.  

After what felt like an eternity—  

"Heh," Senior Brother Li sneered coldly. "Nonsense about training obligations—reaching the tenth level of Qi Refinement doesn’t require that many resources."  

"They’re just using this as an excuse to push us down and remove Luodu from competing for the top squad position."  

"Clever move."  

Senior Brother Li lowered his head, not daring to speak further.  

Moments later—  

"Junior Brother, let’s go. Time to see what they’re up to."  

Senior Brother Li stood abruptly, his expression unreadable.
