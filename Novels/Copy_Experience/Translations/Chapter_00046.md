# Chapter 46: Max Level

"Oh, Elder Hong, please tell me quickly!" The python-robed man's face showed interest.

"The method is simple. Doesn't Your Highness keep many 'Little Birds' in Tianmen City? Have them monitor those who own Earthfire Houses!"

"Just see who buys 'Crimson Spirit Grass' in the coming period!"

The "Little Birds" referred to the large number of informants this prince kept in Tianmen City.

"Crimson Spirit Grass? Just focus on this one spirit herb?" The python-robed youth was a little curious.

"Exactly. This spirit herb is only sold at the Chen family's spirit herb shop and the Hundred Herbs Pavilion. It's an indispensable ingredient for refining Barrier-Breaking Pills!"

"Good, Ziyuan, arrange this immediately!" The python-robed man ordered at once upon hearing the suggestion.

The guard immediately ran out.

The python-robed man's face showed a gentle smile: "Elder Hong, thank you for your guidance. After I ascend the throne, I will surely help you become a Tier 2 alchemist!"

"Hehe, then this old man will await Your Highness's ascent!"

After Lu Xu returned to Tianmen City, he immediately went to the Hundred Herbs Pavilion and purchased the several spirit herbs needed to refine Barrier-Breaking Pills.

Compared to the Nine-Leaf Ganoderma, these spirit herbs were not expensive.

However, one of them, the Crimson Spirit Grass, was very special. Its growth environment requirements were extremely strict. In Wei Kingdom, only a place occupied by the Chen family could meet its growth conditions.

Therefore, only the Chen family and the very influential Hundred Herbs Pavilion could provide this spirit herb.

Lu Xu had some reservations about local Wei Kingdom forces like the Chen family, so he chose to go to the Hundred Herbs Pavilion to purchase the spirit herb.

After obtaining these materials, he immediately returned home.

Looking inward, he saw the cyan stone tablet:

[Name: Lu Xu]
[Lifespan: 28/126]
[Cultivation: Qi Condensation Stage 6]
[Spirit Root: Wood (Mid-Lower)]
[Cultivation Technique: Azurewood Art (Great Perfection): 1000/1000]
[Replication Points: 39]

[Skill - Alchemy]:
Tier 1 High-grade Alchemist: 57/100 (10x)

[Skill - Talisman Making]:
Tier 1 Low-grade Talisman Master: 74/100
Tier 1 Mid-grade Talisman Master: 42/100 (3x)
Tier 1 High-grade Talisman Master: 13/100 (10x)

[Skill - Spells]:

The two lines of text for Tier 1 Low-grade and Mid-grade Alchemist had disappeared.

Lu Xu guessed this was probably because his experience in those two tiers was full.

"This old fella is impressive, probably about to become a Tier 2 alchemist!"

"This time, I've really hit the jackpot! From now on, I'll have a 100% success rate refining Tier 1 Mid-grade pills!"

Lu Xu was overjoyed. With this experience, he could directly enter secluded cultivation and raise his cultivation to Qi Condensation Stage 7.

He still had enough spirit stones, and with the Nine-Leaf Ganoderma, if he could refine a Barrier-Breaking Pill, the bottleneck of the late Qi Condensation stage would no longer be difficult for him.

The next day, Lu Xu left his courtyard.

As usual, he first circled around Tianmen City a few times, changing his appearance with a bronze mask.

Afterwards, he went to various spirit herb shops and purchased some materials needed for refining Qi Nurturing Pills.

After returning home, Lu Xu immediately entered the Earthfire House, took out his alchemy furnace, and began refining pills again.

Three days later, the alchemy furnace opened. Lu Xu waved his hand, and ten round, plump beams of light flew out from the furnace, landing in his hand.

Qi Nurturing Pills!

Ten pills from one furnace! Compared to the previous four, this was a complete leap!

"Refine again!"

Lu Xu continued refining pills until all the Qi Nurturing Pill materials in his hand were consumed.

Each furnace yielded the same — ten Qi Nurturing Pills, not one more, not one less. This was already the maximum quantity achievable by maximizing the efficacy of one set of spirit herbs.

"This is simply incredible. Even other alchemists with more experience than me might not succeed every time; there are always failures for various reasons!"

"But I seem to have no such problem. As long as my experience is full, I am guaranteed to succeed!"

After his initial surprise, a thoughtful expression appeared on Lu Xu's face.

This was probably another change brought by the cyan stone tablet. Locking the success rate was simply heaven-defying!

"Is this the courtyard?" Just as Lu Xu was absorbed in alchemy, two figures appeared outside his courtyard.

It was precisely the python-robed youth and the guard, though at this moment, both were somewhat disguised.

"It should be him. He returned on the night of the secret market trade fair and was seen by our informants. We can confirm he left this courtyard that day!" The guard stated with certainty.

"What if he just happened to be out on urgent business that day?" The python-robed man asked again.

A faint smile appeared on the guard's face: "There's that possibility, but it's very small. I conducted a thorough investigation, and this person is the most suspicious!"

"What's his identity?" The python-robed man's gaze narrowed as he looked at Lu Xu's courtyard and asked.

"The name he registered is Zhao Yun, but it's likely a pseudonym. The time he appeared in Tianmen City was precisely the year the Mo family was destroyed!"

"The year the Mo family was destroyed? Heh heh, interesting. Could this person have some connection to Qingchan's family?" The python-robed man smiled, but his eyes were filled with chilling coldness.

"Your Highness, what should we do next? Should we question this person?" the guard asked.

The python-robed man sighed: "He's already put a Seclusion Talisman on his door!"

The so-called Seclusion Talisman was actually a Tier 1 Mid-grade talisman. Its function was very simple: to maintain quiet within a certain spatial range. It prevented external sounds from entering and internal sounds from escaping.

At the same time, this talisman also served as a warning; if anyone entered its activated area, it would immediately sound an alert.

Because this type of talisman was usually affixed to doors when cultivators entered seclusion, it was called a Seclusion Talisman.

"Given this, he's most likely entered seclusion to refine a Barrier-Breaking Pill. Even if we break in now, it would be too late!" the guard said with a deep frown.

"What's more, we can't just break in!" The python-robed youth sighed.

In Tianmen City, trespassing on someone's residence was a great taboo, punishable by immediate execution if caught.

Although he was a prince, he couldn't violate this rule. Otherwise, his siblings wouldn't miss an opportunity to cause trouble for him.

"Watch this person closely and investigate his origins thoroughly. I must know who exactly this is!" the python-robed man ordered.

Lu Xu began his long period of seclusion for alchemy.

Every once in a while, he would go out to purchase spirit herbs needed for refining Qi Nurturing Pills. After buying them, he would refine them all into pills and then consume them for cultivation.

He would buy more after finishing them.

This cycle continued.

To increase his cultivation speed, he changed his previous habit of taking one pill every nine days, directly increasing it to one pill every three days.

As for the materials for the Barrier-Breaking Pill, he also used them up. Fortunately, he successfully refined one Barrier-Breaking Pill.

With this, the path to the late Qi Condensation stage was completely cleared of its final obstacles.
