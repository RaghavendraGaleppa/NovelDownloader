# Chapter 154: Clearing the Air

Outside the Bianliang City's demonic sect encampment, rows of flying artifacts were parked in an open area.

Lin Shan bid a reluctant farewell to his followers, including Luan Chun and Old Man Zhong, before boarding a massive flying vessel along with other cultivators. This was a large transport vessel specially designed for personnel movement—not only did it have a high passenger capacity and stable speed, but it was also officially operated by the Black Lotus Sect and, most importantly, free of charge.

The vessel was about a hundred zhang long and over twenty zhang wide, featuring a five-story pavilion with more than a thousand guest rooms. It was equipped with defensive formations, restrictions, ballistae, and arrow towers, ensuring both safety and comfort.

Among the thousand or so people returning from the front lines to the Eastern Sea, most were being transferred back due to injuries or disabilities—Lin Shan was one of the very few exceptions. The battles at Dongmen Pass and Bianliang had involved armies of over a hundred thousand cultivators, equivalent to large-scale military engagements where casualties were inevitable.

Some had lost limbs, others had damaged dantians, some had fallen in cultivation level, and many suffered from depleted vital essence. The aftermath of the war left countless lingering issues.

Though demonic sects were ruthless, keeping the weak and injured on the front lines served little purpose. It was more practical to send them back to handle logistics—perhaps assigning them to missionary teams as "alms collectors," giving them just enough to scrape by.

Among demonic sects, the Black Lotus Sect was relatively lenient. Had this been the Blood River Hall or the Hundred Ghosts Sect, the injured might have found themselves turned into blood corpses or vengeful spirits by their own sectmates overnight.

As the massive transport vessel ascended into the sky, carrying its thousand passengers eastward, a figure emerged from behind a tent in a corner of the encampment—Venerable Bear Mountain. He silently watched Lin Shan's distant figure on the vessel, recalling the recent rumors of the young man slaying a true disciple of the Dry Cloud Pavilion. His eyes flickered with unreadable thoughts.

After flying for a day and night, the transport vessel passed over the Falling Pine Mountains and entered the eastern region of the Great Song Dynasty. Compared to the west, where remnants of righteous path resistance still lingered, the east was relatively peaceful.

On the deck, cultivators emerged to get some fresh air. Lin Shan sat to one side, enjoying the scenery below. Wisps of white clouds drifted past as mountains and rivers swiftly receded beneath them. It had been a long time since he had felt so relaxed and content.

At this moment, he possessed a wealth of ancient charm and ample cultivation resources, ready to return and focus on breaking through his bottlenecks. Moreover, he had earned the favor of the Black Lotus Sect's Sect Master. As long as he completed his mission, a prosperous future was all but guaranteed.

The target assigned by the Sect Master sat on the opposite side of the deck—a middle-aged man with a dull, honest appearance. He, too, was quietly admiring the majestic landscape below, though a slight furrow in his brow hinted at troubled thoughts.

Lin Shan didn't fully understand the Sect Master's motive for wanting this man dead, but demonic cultivators were no strangers to bloodshed. Judging by morality alone, none of them had clean hands. In the struggle for opportunities, killing and plundering were inevitable—even righteous cultivators were merely cloaked in hypocrisy, let alone demonic ones.

This seemingly honest man was no saint either. He had long been involved in ambushes and assassinations. Years ago, the Sect Master's first wife had recruited him to kill the Sect Master's illegitimate child, after which he had joined her faction.

Now that he sensed his crimes were about to be exposed, he planned to flee back to the Eastern Sea under the first wife's protection. His official reason for returning was to recuperate from injuries, with all the necessary forged medical reports in place. On the surface, everything appeared flawless.

Though he believed his scheme was airtight, a sect master had countless ways to crush him. The Sect Master had simply chosen the most "secure" method—having Lin Shan eliminate him along the way.

What made it "secure"? Aside from Lin Shan's proven ability to kill a true disciple of a major sect, the Sect Master had reassessed Lin Shan's combat prowess after seeing the wealth in his storage bag—far surpassing that of an ordinary Golden Core cultivator.

With such resources at his disposal, dealing with the target should be more than manageable.

Though the target had once ambushed and killed the Sect Master's illegitimate son, acquiring the artifacts meant for the child, Lin Shan's own profound luck should tip the scales in his favor.

Even if the mission failed, the Sect Master had other means to eliminate the target back in the Eastern Sea. This was simply an opportunity to test a promising young talent.

While discreetly observing the dull-faced man across the deck, Lin Shan consulted the Black Skeleton Demon Lord.

"How should I go about completing the Sect Master's mission?"

"With your strength, even a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator would only slow you down a bit. Why ask me?"

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord's reply was half-hearted. Ever since witnessing the bizarre purple tentacles and learning that Lin Shan had been in "close contact" with eldritch entities—while being soul-bound to such a "high-risk carrier"—it had lost all hope for its skeletal existence.

Originally, it had planned to secretly advance this avatar to Foundation Establishment and slip away to freedom once Lin Shan left the demonic encampment. After all, their silver contract only prohibited mutual hostility and promoted cooperation on equal terms—it didn't restrict either party from leaving.

But now, knowing Lin Shan was a "carrier," it was only a matter of time before the eldritch horrors came for him. And the demon lord knew all too well how terrifying those entities could be.

Even if this was just an avatar, if the eldritch source traced their contract back to its true body in the Fifth Hell, the consequences would be dire. They were now bound together on the same sinking ship, with no escape.

Rather than striking out alone, it made more sense to stick with Lin Shan—at least they could brace for the inevitable together.

Seeing the demon lord's gloom, Lin Shan wasn't sure how to console it. But as a former Nascent Soul powerhouse, it was a resource too valuable to waste.

"Old friend, now that you've reached Foundation Establishment, we're equals. We should help each other out!"

"Me, needing your help? More like you needing mine."

"What kind of talk is that? Since when are we so distant?"

"What about the resources I need to recover my Golden Core strength..."

"I'll cover it!"

Lin Shan thumped his chest in assurance. With his enhancement panel, he could always upgrade their silver contract to gold once the demon lord reached Golden Core. There was no way this scheming old ghost would escape his grasp.

Unaware of Lin Shan's cheat, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord perked up at the promise of full support for its recovery. If it could regain Golden Core strength and find a way to annul their contract, it might yet escape this walking calamity.

Suddenly, the flames of hope were rekindled. With renewed purpose, it began earnestly offering advice.

"The Sect Master's task isn't difficult—the challenge is doing it cleanly."

"If you kill him outright on the ship, witnesses will report it, causing trouble for the Sect Master."

"If you slaughter everyone aboard and return alone, it'd be just as obvious."

"The key is eliminating the target without alerting anyone."

The demon lord's analysis was thorough and incisive, drawing nods of understanding from Lin Shan.

"So you're saying..."

"Curse him! Use your signature move. I'll set up a concealment array outside his room to mask any disturbances. Once he's weakened, we finish him quietly."

The demon lord's true motive was to study Lin Shan's curse abilities. Having been indirectly exposed to the eldritch through him, it wanted to understand this threat before their inevitable encounter.

From ancient ruins, it had learned that these entities heralded apocalyptic calamities capable of annihilating entire worlds. It was also curious why Lin Shan's curses summoned eldritch horrors instead of normal beings—and why it had been dragged into this world through such means.

"Sounds good. But curses require his hair, blood, or personal belongings..."

"Leave that to me."

With a sinister chuckle, the skeletal figure rose and shuffled toward the dull-faced man on the other side of the deck.
