# Chapter 14: The Wooden Dummy

The rooster's beak pecked at a spot between the neck and tail of the bluish-green dead snake, slightly towards the rear. A hole appeared, and soon a dark green sphere the size of a peanut rolled out.

Zhou Qing immediately caught a whiff of a foul, fishy odor.

He crouched down to examine it carefully, surmising that this was likely the snake's gallbladder.

The rooster nudged its beak toward Zhou Qing.

Suddenly, Zhou Qing understood its intention.

"You want me to eat its gallbladder?"

The rooster flapped its wings, clucking loudly as if urging Zhou Qing to eat the gallbladder quickly.

Zhou Qing shook his head.

His current constitution was undoubtedly incomparable to the rooster's.

Moreover, the digestive systems of chickens and humans were different. For instance, in an episode of *Journey to the West*, even a highly venomous centipede demon posed no threat to the giant rooster in the story.

Normally, snake gallbladders contained various toxins, and consuming them raw could easily lead to poisoning, not to mention the risk of parasites.

Given Zhou Qing's current physical condition, taking such a risk was out of the question.

Though the rooster meant well, Zhou Qing had to be cautious.

It might assume that since it could eat the gallbladder raw without issue, Zhou Qing could do the same and even benefit from it.

"This guy probably thinks I'm some human-shaped tiger."

Zhou Qing had often used the tiger's imposing aura from his Tiger Play exercises to tame the rooster.

Having read many miscellaneous books, Zhou Qing quickly recalled two safe methods for consuming snake gallbladder: soaking it in high-proof liquor for at least a month or cooking it thoroughly.

Butcher Hu had once given him a bottle of strong liquor, but it wasn't potent enough. Besides, Zhou Qing believed alcohol was harmful and avoided drinking whenever possible.

Cooking it was the better option.

Zhou Qing set up a pot, started a fire, cleaned the dead snake, and made a simple snake soup. He prepared the gallbladder separately.

Most snake venom consisted of proteins, which would be neutralized by high heat.

Once the soup was ready, it wasn't as fragrant as he had imagined. Instead, it still carried a faint fishy odor. After all, spices were expensive in this ancient world.

Zhou Qing remembered a detail from *Dream of the Red Chamber* where Grandmother Jia's private stash included pepper, indicating how precious spices were even to wealthy families.

Without spices, it was difficult to mask the fishy taste of food, especially game, which was inherently more pungent than domesticated meat.

Butcher Hu primarily slaughtered pigs because, in this era, pigs weren't castrated, making their meat particularly gamey. His clientele consisted mostly of ordinary folks.

In the bustling commercial hub of Jiangzhou, the wealthy preferred beef, lamb, and fresh river delicacies.

However, butchering and selling cattle and sheep required certain privileges.

While slaughtering sheep was permitted, killing cattle was strictly prohibited by the authorities. In practice, though, there were ways around this—whether the cattle died of old age or were slaughtered alive often depended on one's connections.

Without backing, even selling beef from cattle that had died naturally could land one in legal trouble. Conversely, with the right connections, one could slaughter cattle openly without repercussions.

This was why Butcher Hu sought Zhou Qing's favor.

As a scholar, Zhou Qing held some status, but he wasn't yet influential enough to meddle in established interests. However, if he passed the provincial exams and became an official, he would gain real power to exploit the local populace.

By aligning himself with Zhou Qing, Butcher Hu could rise from a lowly butcher to a mid-to-upper-tier one, eventually becoming a local magnate rather than just a market bully.

Seeing the snake soup ready, the rooster obediently waited at Zhou Qing's feet, evidently expecting to feast on the scraps and bones as usual.

Zhou Qing guessed that the rooster regarded him as a tiger king—its master—and the dead snake as tribute from a subordinate.

After some thought, Zhou Qing placed a small bowl of snake meat, bones, and blood before the rooster. Since the rooster had caught the snake for him, it wouldn't be right to leave it with only scraps.

The rooster happily devoured the offering, relishing the cooked meat despite being accustomed to raw food. It was a different flavor, and it came from Zhou Qing, the tiger king.

Watching its eagerness, Zhou Qing suspected the rooster hadn't killed any other snakes—it had likely eaten its fill before bringing this one back.

"Brother Rooster, since fate has brought us together, and we're companions here, I should give you a name." After a moment's thought, Zhou Qing said, "How about 'Maori'?"

Maori was one of the Twenty-Eight Mansions in Chinese astronomy, residing in the Palace of Light in mythology, with the form of a six- to seven-foot-tall rooster.

By naming the rooster Maori, Zhou Qing hoped it would live as long as the celestial constellations.

If even a pet could achieve longevity, surely its master would as well.

The rooster seemed to understand and accept the name—Maori!

After finishing the snake soup—most of which Zhou Qing consumed—he ate slowly, observing the changes in his Health Monitor. There were no immediate abnormalities, so he felt at ease.

Once satiated, he planned to rest briefly before practicing martial arts as usual.

However, he suddenly felt drowsy and lay down for a nap.

Soon, he woke up drenched in sweat, his body burning with heat.

He quickly drank several bowls of water and checked his Health Monitor.

"Remaining Lifespan: 32 years."

It had decreased by a year.

"Could the snake meat and gallbladder still be toxic despite being thoroughly cooked?" Zhou Qing had meticulously cleaned the snake, following methods from his memory.

During the meal, he had monitored his Health Monitor closely, and there had been no signs of trouble.

"Wait, if this were poisoning, losing only one year of lifespan wouldn't make sense."

Assessing his condition, he felt overheated and thirsty.

Severe dehydration could cause anemia-like symptoms.

Upon waking to find his bed soaked, his first instinct had been to drink water, which also helped cool him down.

Though still slightly thirsty, it was more out of habit—his body was no longer severely dehydrated.

Reciting the opening passage of *The Great Learning*, Zhou Qing calmed his mind.

It worked.

Despite the heat, his thoughts quickly settled. "This feels more like I've overindulged in a potent tonic."

The bluish-green snake must have been extraordinarily nourishing.

"Excessive tonification leads to deficiency," Zhou Qing thought.

His body, already weaker than average, couldn't handle such a strong tonic, resulting in "tonic excess causing deficiency."

To counteract this, he needed to expend the excess energy.

Zhou Qing rushed outside and began practicing the Five Animal Exercises.

Starting with the Tiger Play, he moved through the routine with unprecedented vigor and agility. His back felt unusually strong, his spine subtly undulating like a snake's.

Next was the Deer Play, focusing on legwork. As he practiced, two streams of warmth flowed—one to his liver, the other to his kidneys. Sweating profusely, he felt his circulation improve, the heat gradually dissipating.

The Bear Play that followed was less remarkable, though slightly smoother than usual. The Monkey and Bird Plays were even less impactful but still better than before.

After completing the full set, Zhou Qing checked his Health Monitor again.

"Remaining Lifespan: 33 years."

He smiled, pleased.

Ignoring his usual village school duties, he repeated the Tiger and Deer Plays, focusing on the most effective exercises.

Eventually, the heat subsided.

Another check:

"Remaining Lifespan: 35 years."

"Tiger Play: (Proficient)"
"Deer Play: (Proficient)"

The other three exercises remained unchanged, as did his unimproved "Black Tiger Steals the Heart" and "Flicking Finger Divine Skill."

The Deer Play's advancement to proficiency was a pleasant surprise, while the Tiger Play's stagnation at proficient didn't disappoint him—he sensed it was on the verge of breaking through.

Sitting under the mulberry tree, Zhou Qing noticed his breathing was deeper, his heartbeat slower and stronger, and his waist—his kidneys—felt unusually robust.

The familiar warmth from his exercises now coursed more vigorously through his body, alleviating fatigue.

As he rested, he recited classical texts.

Nearby, the mulberry tree's leaves curled slightly toward him, as if reacting to heat.

*Knock, knock, knock!*

It was midday, the sun blazing.

"Who is it?" Zhou Qing called out from the shade, where he had been enjoying the cool breeze while reading.

"It's me, Blacksmith Hu. Glad you're home."

Recognizing the voice, Zhou Qing opened the door to find Blacksmith Hu delivering a wooden dummy and sandbag leg weights, reinforced with metal plates at key points as requested.

Sweating under the scorching sun, Blacksmith Hu's movements were noticeably more agile.

Zhou Qing guessed this improvement stemmed from the ancient texts and herbs Blacksmith Hu had sought his help with. The texts were cryptic and incomplete, so Zhou Qing hadn't bothered studying them—focusing on the Five Animal Exercises was a better use of his time.

He surmised that Blacksmith Hu's previous lameness resulted from misinterpreting those texts. Now, with corrected methods and the right herbs, his leg was healing.

Inviting Blacksmith Hu inside, Zhou Qing helped set up the wooden dummy while Blacksmith Hu explained, "I planned to come in the evening to avoid the heat, but since you didn't show up at the village school today, the elders and students were worried. They feared something might have happened to you living alone here."

Touched, Zhou Qing acknowledged their concern. Though the village elders had hired him partly for their own gain, who in this world wasn't driven by profit? Ambition and kindness weren't mutually exclusive.

Once the dummy was assembled, Zhou Qing offered tea and payment. Blacksmith Hu declined at first but eventually accepted half, covering costs and labor.

Notably, Blacksmith Hu didn't pry into Zhou Qing's martial arts pursuits—a discretion Zhou Qing appreciated, given his own secrets.

In this era, while scholars were esteemed, the ideal was to be adept in both civil and martial arts. Many renowned scholars in history had excelled in both.

The reason few combined scholarly and martial pursuits was the immense time, money, and effort required. The wealthy often lacked discipline, while the poor could barely afford education, let alone martial training.

To Blacksmith Hu, Zhou Qing was exceptional—disciplined and financially stable enough to pursue both. Such a man was destined to rise.

After Blacksmith Hu left, Zhou Qing admired the wooden dummy beneath the mulberry tree.

For now, he continued using the tree for his "Flicking Finger Divine Skill" practice, reserving the dummy for later stages. The tree's thick bark could withstand damage and heal, unlike the dummy, which would be harder to repair.

The dummy's primary purpose was to refine his "Black Tiger Steals the Heart" and adapt the Tiger Play into a more personalized "Tiger Fist."

Now more versed in the Tiger Play, Zhou Qing felt confident modifying it to suit him better.

"Without a teacher or sparring partner, one seeks the mirror and the dummy," he mused.

A full-length mirror was beyond his means, and its clarity would be poor anyway. The dummy was a practical alternative.

Though he lacked a sparring partner, Zhou Qing glanced at the rooster, Maori.

Its agility made it an ideal candidate for Deer Play drills, which emphasized footwork.

Maori, having hidden during Blacksmith Hu's visit, now eyed Zhou Qing warily, its small head tilting in confusion as it backed toward a corner.
