# Chapter 7: The Cold Iron Palm Academy  

The walls of Fangsuo County stood twenty meters tall, towering and majestic like a giant beast crouching at the foot of the Wuyang Mountain Range.  

Armored soldiers patrolled the walls and gates, armed with swords and spears, exuding an air of stern authority.  

The sun had just risen from the distant horizon.  

Outside the city gates, a large crowd of commoners from the outskirts had already gathered, waiting to enter. Though their clothing was shabby, they were far better off than the refugees huddled timidly by the roadside, too afraid to approach.  

Those refugees were ragged, disheveled, and emaciated, their faces sallow from malnutrition and the hardships of displacement.  

Qin Ziling even saw several corpses of refugees lying by the roadside outside the city. A constable was directing workers to load the bodies onto a cart, which creaked as it was pulled toward the mass graves outside the city.  

"Ah, when will this wretched world ever change?"  

"Indeed. I heard the governor of Nanding Province, Wang Lang, has declared himself king. Those who refuse to submit are beheaded, their blood flowing in rivers. Who knows when his forces will reach our Xiyun Province?"  

"They say the southwestern vassal state, Luodian, has also rebelled, repeatedly raiding our borders, burning, killing, and looting. Many refugees have fled from Heya County."  

"In Jiugao County, there have been consecutive years of floods and locust plagues. Many areas have had no harvest, yet the officials not only refuse to open the granaries or distribute relief supplies but continue to raise taxes. The people are suffering unbearably, and rebellions have broken out in many places. The land is littered with bones, and not a rooster’s crow can be heard for miles—it’s truly tragic."  

"Hmph, is Fangsuo County any better? These days, which commoner dares to travel far? Bandits and outlaws are everywhere. Only the areas around the city appear somewhat peaceful and inhabited. Venture just ten miles beyond, and how many households remain? The officials only care about power struggles, indulging in pleasure, oppressing the people, and amassing wealth. None are willing to lead troops to suppress the bandits."  

"Shh! Such talk is dangerous!"  

"Alas, these are indeed troubled times..."  

Standing among the crowd, Qin Ziling gazed at the scene before him and listened to the hushed whispers, letting out a deep sigh.  

In the past, he had only read about the suffering of chaotic eras in history books—how life was as cheap as grass, and people even resorted to exchanging children to eat. But those descriptions had always felt distant. Living in an era of prosperity, civilization, and advanced technology, his imagination had been woefully inadequate.  

It wasn’t until ten days ago, when he was reborn into a world eerily resembling the feudal chaos described in those books, that he truly understood what it meant to live in such times—where suffering was everywhere, and human life was worthless.  

---  

In such a world, without power, influence, or wealth, living in a dilapidated village outside the city walls with only a low, broken fence for protection, and having achieved nothing in martial arts—being merely an ordinary disciple at the muscle-training stage, capable of handling only three or five untrained men—Qin Ziling knew he stood little chance of survival if war reached the county or if bandits roamed the area. Protecting his family, let alone saving others, was nothing but a laughable fantasy.  

Thus, when he first realized his circumstances, despair had nearly consumed him.  

It wasn’t until yesterday that a glimmer of hope had ignited in his heart.  

Gently rubbing the faint black mark on his left pinky finger with his right thumb and forefinger, Qin Ziling strode confidently through the city gates.  

The county was divided into inner and outer cities.  

The inner city had its own walls and moat, housing the noble families and high-ranking officials.  

Four east-west streets and six north-south streets divided the city into wards of varying sizes.  

After entering through the west gate, Qin Ziling crossed two streets and arrived at a grand residence in Xianyuan Ward of the western district, its entrance flanked by two stone lions.  

Above the vermilion gate hung a plaque bearing four bold, powerful characters: "Cold Iron Palm Academy."  

Pushing open the gate, Qin Ziling was greeted by a spacious training ground.  

About twenty young men and women—mostly men—were already gathered there. Some practiced punches and palm strikes, others lifted stone locks to build strength, while a few circled wooden dummies...  

Beneath a large tree at the corner of the training ground sat a man.  

Though his temples were graying and his frame slightly hunched and lean, his bones were large, especially his hands, which were noticeably bigger than an average person's, giving him an imposing presence.  

He was Zuo Le, the master of the Cold Iron Palm Academy.  

"Master, greetings from Ziling," Qin Ziling said, bowing respectfully as he approached.  

Zuo Le continued sipping his tea without looking up, merely waving a hand to dismiss him.  

Qin Ziling wasn’t surprised by the indifferent response.  

As a disciple still at the muscle-training stage, he was merely a source of income for Zuo Le—one of many who came and went. He wasn’t considered a true disciple.  

Only those who had reached the skin-and-membrane training stage earned Zuo Le’s attention and became his formal disciples, worthy of being called "Master." Qin Ziling, like others at his level, could only address him as "Academy Master."  

---  

Just as Qin Ziling turned to leave, a young man approached. Dressed in high-quality training attire, he had narrow eyes and thin lips, exuding an air of cold arrogance.  

"Ziling, spar with me later," the young man said, stopping in front of Qin Ziling and narrowing his eyes with a mocking, disdainful look. His tone brooked no refusal.  

"Of course, Senior Brother Nangong," Qin Ziling replied with a slight bow, his expression calm. Only a faint, undetectable glint of coldness flashed deep in his eyes.  

Nangong Yue was slightly surprised that Qin Ziling showed no anger or fear, but his lips soon curled into a contemptuous smirk as he brushed past him.  

"Good morning, Master Zuo!" Nangong Yue’s earlier arrogance vanished as he greeted Zuo Le with deference.  

"You’re here," Zuo Le replied warmly, setting down his teacup and smiling. His sharp eyes scrutinized Nangong Yue. "Your blood energy surges like a tide—strong and vigorous. Your father must have spent heavily again yesterday. But with your talent and age, it’s worth it. If you continue sealing your blood energy with your skin and membranes, compressing and tempering it diligently, you have a real chance of developing true force. Only then can you unleash the full power of the Cold Iron Palm, truly step into the martial path, and become a martial instructor—a figure of some standing in Fangsuo City."  

Nangong Yue couldn’t hide his pride at the praise, but he quickly composed himself and bowed again. "All of this is thanks to Master’s guidance. Without you, I would never have come this far."  

Zuo Le laughed heartily, pleased, and motioned for Nangong Yue to sit beside him, offering private instruction.  

---  

"So, Nangong Yue wants to spar with you again?" On the other side of the training ground, a burly man with a chest like forged iron was lifting stone locks. He tossed one to Qin Ziling as he approached, casting a disdainful glance toward Nangong Yue under the tree.  

This man, Liu Xiaoqiang, was one of Qin Ziling’s few friends at the academy.  

"Mn," Qin Ziling replied, catching the stone lock. Though he managed to hold it, the weight forced him a step back to steady himself.  

"He’s just trying to make you suffer," Liu Xiaoqiang said indignantly.  

"I know," Qin Ziling said with a wry smile, his gaze drifting toward a young woman practicing martial arts on the other side of the training ground.
