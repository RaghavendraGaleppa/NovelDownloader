# Chapter 25: Transaction  

There was no response.  

Chu Ning's Growth Technique struck the seed, but it showed no reaction whatsoever. He wasn't particularly surprised by this—after all, not all seeds could be easily germinated.  

From his previous studies on spiritual plants, Chu Ning had long known that some seeds were more challenging to cultivate.  

With another flick of his fingers, he cast the Growth Technique again.  

The seed remained unchanged, but Chu Ning wasn't discouraged.  

Three times, four times, five times... ten times!  

Only on the tenth attempt did he finally sense the seed beginning to crack.  

Eleven, twelve... fifteen!  

With each successive casting of the technique, the seed gradually sprouted.  

By the fifteenth application of the Growth Technique, the seed had fully germinated.  

The slender sapling had a brown trunk and had already begun to grow small leaves, which were still tiny and entirely green.  

But when Chu Ning looked closely, he noticed faint traces of seven-colored hues shimmering on the undersides of the leaves!  

The colors were extremely subtle, appearing and disappearing like a mirage—almost impossible to detect unless one examined them carefully.  

"It really is the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit!"  

After confirming it beyond doubt, Chu Ning carefully placed the sapling into a jade box, his eyes gleaming with excitement.  

Though he still didn’t know the exact purpose of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, the fact that Old Man Sun treasured it so much—and was even willing to spend so many spirit stones to have him cultivate it—meant it had to be something extraordinary.  

"Spirit stones, the Swiftwind Talisman, and even the Golden Sword Technique are certainly valuable to me. But the real treasures from this encounter are the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art and the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit."  

Chu Ning mused silently to himself. "I need to learn more about both of these."  

After taking stock of his gains, Chu Ning began carefully considering the events that had transpired and planning his next steps.  

Though he didn’t know where the bearded man had obtained the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seed, he had a sneaking suspicion that the ambush might have been related to it.  

Perhaps the man had even known about his arrangement with Old Man Sun to cultivate the fruit using the Verdant Wood Spring Technique.  

For now, it was best to avoid the market. There was no telling whether the rogue cultivator had accomplices.  

This meant he couldn’t consult Old Man Sun about the cultivation method for the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit either. He would have to seek information within the sect.  

Not only that, but he also wanted to inquire about the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art.  

After all, he had obtained both the Nine Tigers Body Forging Art and the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art relatively easily. There might be some clues within the sect.  

As for the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, the Green Stream Sect was known for its expertise in spiritual plant cultivation, so there might be records about it.  

If he couldn’t find anything, he could always revisit the market later.  

Since his next visit to the Scripture Hall was in a couple of days, Chu Ning decided to inquire then.  

Fortunately, storing a spiritual plant sapling in a jade box for seven to ten days wouldn’t be a problem.  

In the afternoon, Chu Ning went to the mountain behind his courtyard as usual to practice the Thorn Technique, Vine Armor Technique, and other spells.  

His current goal was to master the Thorn Technique and Vine Armor Technique as quickly as possible, refining them into innate abilities that could be cast instantaneously.  

In addition to these two spells, he had also begun practicing two others: the Object Control Technique and the Golden Sword Technique.  

For the Object Control Technique, Chu Ning used the wooden sword he had purchased from Old Man Sun.  

Perhaps because the sword was made of wood, he found it surprisingly easy to manipulate.  

Moreover, the sword had considerable weight, making it quite lethal.  

Though he hadn’t learned any proper sword-control techniques, simply using the Object Control Technique to hurl the wooden sword was enough to snap a tree as thick as a fist.  

The only drawback was that his current version of the technique only allowed for straightforward movements, without any additional mana enhancement.  

Otherwise, Chu Ning would have seriously considered making sword-throwing a key part of his training.  

His progress with the Golden Sword Technique, however, was far less smooth.  

Compared to his wood-element spells, mastering this technique was proving extremely difficult.  

In fact, among all the spells he had practiced so far, the Golden Sword Technique was by far the most challenging.  

For now, he could only treat it as an experiment. If he truly couldn’t make progress, he would have to abandon it.  

After a full afternoon of training, Chu Ning felt his schedule had become much tighter.  

No wonder Shi Yao at the Scripture Hall had been reluctant to teach too many spells at once—focus inevitably became divided when practicing multiple techniques.  

If not for his innate talent with wood-element spells due to his Yin Wood Spirit Body, he wouldn’t have been able to spare the effort for other spells.  

To his surprise, before he could even make it to the Scripture Hall, someone came looking for him the very next day.  

"Junior Brother Chu, your courtyard is quite well arranged."  

Zhuang Yunde, a plump sect disciple, stepped into Chu Ning’s courtyard and couldn’t help but compliment the layout.  

"These Ironvine Thorns are perfect for practicing the Thorn Technique. Transplanting so many mature and high-quality specimens must have taken considerable effort.  

Though they’re common, finding ones of such good condition isn’t easy."  

Chu Ning smiled modestly.  

"Senior Brother flatters me. I just planted them for decoration.  

I’m a simple man—flowers and fancy plants don’t appeal to me much. But these overlooked Ironvine Thorns feel quite familiar."  

Since he hadn’t interacted much with Zhuang Yunde, Chu Ning instinctively kept his guard up.  

Zhuang Yunde chuckled and didn’t press the matter further. Instead, he changed the subject.  

"Junior Brother Chu, it’s been almost two months since you started cultivating the Dark Spirit Bamboo. How is its growth? Would you mind if I took a look?"  

Chu Ning was momentarily taken aback, unsure of Zhuang Yunde’s intentions.  

But then he recalled that two months ago, Zhuang Yunde had specifically asked if he was interested in talisman-making and mentioned checking the bamboo’s progress.  

A thought struck him—perhaps Zhuang Yunde’s visit was related to that.  

"Of course, Senior Brother. I’d be honored to have your guidance."  

With that, Chu Ning led Zhuang Yunde to the high-grade spirit field where the Dark Spirit Bamboo was planted.  

As soon as they approached, Zhuang Yunde’s eyes lit up with surprise. He quickened his pace and examined the bamboo closely.  

Seeing that the stalks were gradually turning from green to black, his expression shifted to astonishment.  

"Junior Brother Chu, your Dark Spirit Bamboo is thriving. To achieve such coloration in just two months is remarkable."  

As he spoke, he gave Chu Ning a meaningful look.  

"It seems your Verdant Wood Spring Technique has reached quite a high level."  

"You flatter me, Senior Brother," Chu Ning replied calmly.  

"I seem to have a slightly better grasp of wood-element techniques like the Verdant Wood Longevity Art and the Verdant Wood Spring Technique, so I’ve focused most of my efforts there.  

As a result, my progress with other spells has been rather mediocre."  

To demonstrate, he casually cast the Rain Blessing Technique.  

Since he hadn’t invested much time in this water-element spell—and his talent for water techniques was decidedly average—the result was no better than what most new disciples could achieve, if not worse.  

Seeing this, the depth in Zhuang Yunde’s gaze lessened slightly.  

Considering that Chu Ning had always shown a stronger aptitude for wood-element spells, he didn’t dwell on it further. Instead, he smiled and said:  

"Junior Brother needn’t worry. I’m not questioning your progress—rather, I was thinking that the time might be right for us to proceed with our transaction."  

"Transaction?"  

Chu Ning, who had been wondering if he should tone down his abilities even more, was momentarily puzzled.  

He looked at Zhuang Yunde questioningly, and the latter continued with a smile:  

"You may recall, Junior Brother, that two months ago I asked if you were interested in talisman-making.  

The reason I didn’t elaborate then was that if your Dark Spirit Bamboo turned out poorly, you’d likely have to surrender all of it to the sect, leaving nothing for yourself.  

But judging by its current condition, if this growth continues, you’ll be able to keep about half after fulfilling your sect obligations."  

Pausing briefly, he added:  

"According to sect rules, the remaining half is yours to dispose of as you wish.  

You can sell it back to the sect for spirit stones, trade it with others, or even use it to make talisman paper yourself."  

Zhuang Yunde smiled meaningfully.  

"So I’d like to propose a transaction: I’ll teach you the method for crafting talisman paper, and in return, you’ll give me one-tenth of your remaining Dark Spirit Bamboo. What do you think?"
