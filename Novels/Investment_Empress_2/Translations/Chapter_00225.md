# Chapter 225: She Is Just Similar, But She Is Not You

Inside the room on the third floor.

The moment the Heavenly Demon Illusion was shattered, Li Mo snapped back to his senses.

He was awake, but he still felt mentally exhausted. The toll on his spirit, form, and intent was not easy to bear.

Opposite him, Yin Mianmian had clearly been shaken as well.

"Heh... That strange Soul Intent of yours is useless now, isn't it?"

Yin Mianmian’s face was slightly pale.

Nevertheless, she raised her hand and struck out. The attack seemed invisible and powerless, silent and soundless.

This move appeared soft and weak, but in reality, it sealed off all of Li Mo's possible escape routes.

Invisible Silk Hand.

This supreme technique had clearly reached the Perfection realm!

Her figure was like a phantom.

She arrived far too quickly.

A genius ranked outside the Top Ten of the Dragon Ranking would find it difficult to withstand such a bizarre palm strike.

Li Mo’s mind calmed down. The Forty was in his hand, and the seven Xuan Dan in his Dantian began to spin violently in an instant.

He did not retreat; instead, he advanced.

He raised the Star Pile.

Inside the World Seed, the stars arranged in the Big Dipper formation shone brilliantly!

The small hammer was fierce and domineering, containing the power to split the heavens and earth, as if causing the sky to collapse.

*Boom—*

The aura was violent yet incredibly condensed, leaking not a single shred of power.

This was because Li Mo’s mastery of the hammer technique had reached the pinnacle of refinement, wasting not a fraction of its might.

Yin Mianmian’s eyes widened suddenly.

Her figure drifted like a falling leaf in a gale.

*Crackle and pop—*

One Heavenly Demon Phantom exploded into black smoke and dissipated on her body, followed by the second, third, fourth, and fifth. Layer upon layer of phantoms shattered and vanished like illusory bubbles.

Asura Shadow.

This was the first stance of a Divine Rank movement technique.

It was also the reason she could survive that hammer strike.

It was also why she could stall even an Outer Scene expert for a moment; an Inner Scene expert was simply helpless against her.

"None of the Top Ten on the Dragon Ranking are easy to deal with."

"Even though my Soul Intent somewhat suppresses her..."

Li Mo gripped his hammer, calculating in his heart how many more strikes he could unleash.

"Observing the Three Apertures of the Divine Soul forced me to go all out."

"Among those ranked outside the Top Ten on the Dragon Ranking, you are the first."

Finally, the aura of her Nine Apertures of the Divine Soul poured out without any suppression, no longer concealing the energy within the room.

Her figure seemed boneless, dancing and entwining with the long silk.

It seemed... she wanted to wrap "Little Li" up like a zongzi and take him away.

Li Mo instantly activated the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body.

*Slap—*

A gentle breeze blew past, pushing the door open.

...

Just moments ago.

Tang Xiaobao had finished his bath.

He was holding a bucket of bathwater, preparing to head to the third floor, when he suddenly stopped in his tracks.

At the entrance stood a familiar figure.

"Senior Sister Bing?"

Tang Xiaobao stared blankly, unable to understand.

Why had another Senior Sister Bing appeared?

Then, he saw the Frost Sword being drawn. A flash of sword light suddenly lit up.

Ethereal and clear, like a fairy shadow flying from the moon, it was impossible to dodge. It shot straight up into the sky in an instant.

*Rip—*

The long silk filling the room was透ed through by the sword light, unable to block it in the slightest.

This was a sword strike that could not be avoided.

*Ding—*

Sparks flew.

It was the sound of a dagger colliding with the Frost Sword.

Yin Mianmian’s figure drew a sharp angle in a bizarre manner, instantly blasting backward and crashing through the window.

"Li Mo... I will come back for you..."

Her voice seemed to blow in from the Netherworld.

With a few flashes, she merged into the night.

"I think she’d be better suited to be a thief."

Li Mo didn't feel much loss.

Just now, he had essentially crossed hands with one of the strongest geniuses in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

To be honest.

If neither side had any restrictions or scruples, even with the加持 of World Power, he wouldn't be able to take her down.

In a head-on clash, he would certainly crush her, but Yin Mianmian’s strength lay obviously in speed.

---

Even a bald man has mosquitoes he can't squash, right...

At this moment, the sound of sheathing a sword came from beside him.

Li Mo turned his head. Under the night wind, Ying Bing’s dress clung to her body, seemingly dampened by moisture. Her hair stuck to her snow-white neck, and her breath was slightly disordered.

"Weren't you going to a duel?"

"Mm."

Ying Bing realized something was wrong as soon as she reached the heart of the Fish Dragon Lake.

Bai Li Rang hadn't come alone. Rather than a duel, it seemed more like he wanted to delay her time.

When she recognized the traces of the Drizzle Tower on him, she realized something was amiss instantly.

"Then why are you back so soon?"

Li Mo was a bit confused.

Ying Bing’s gaze swept over the two buns on the floor, then glanced at him:

"I didn't hold back."

What reason could there be to lure her away?

There was only one possibility.

Yin Mianmian’s Heavenly Demon Illusionary Form specialized in disguise and enchantment; this was something she had experienced before.

On the way back, her emotions had been churning. Her mind, which should have been calm, was filled with all sorts of strange thoughts.

The Sixth on the Dragon Ranking with Nine Apertures of the Divine Soul; she didn't have full confidence in beating her one-on-one yet.

What if, by the time she returned, Li Mo was already gone?

Or... when she came back, she would see his cold body...

She thought about it more and more seriously.

For the first time, she tasted the feeling of panic.

Now, seeing the youth standing before her unharmed, she felt as though she had stepped back from the clouds onto solid ground.

"...I didn't hold back."

Li Mo could roughly imagine the consequences of those people.

Just for a duel, Bing Dangdang wouldn't ignore the fact that her clothes were dampened by moisture...

"Why did Yin Mianmian say she would come back for you?"

Ying Bing looked at him quietly.

Li Mo explained what had just happened: "She disguised herself as your appearance. I thought it was you, but then I realized something was wrong..."

He roughly recounted the events.

"How did you realize?"

Ying Bing seemed a bit puzzled.

"..."

Li Mo hadn't used the Eye of Fate this time.

He had sensed it even before the system prompted him.

After thinking it over seriously, Li Mo said:

"She is just similar, but she is not you."

Ying Bing’s eyelashes trembled slightly.

Her breath, which hadn't settled yet, seemed... to become even more disordered?

Looking at the youth's serious expression.

The seed planted不知何时 within the solid ice seemed to have... sprouted again, cracking the surface...

"You worked hard."

"Sit down first."

Li Mo became serious immediately.

He realized that Bing Dangdang not only had disordered breathing and red ears, but her heart rate was also slightly elevated.

That made sense. She had just sent assassins, including a Dragon Ranking genius, to see King Yama, and had also fought Yin Mianmian. She couldn't be acting as if nothing happened.

Ying Bing looked up in confusion.

She sat on the intact massage chair.

Sensing Li Mo’s gaze scanning her.

Ying Bing pressed her legs together, covered her chest with her arms, and her expression cooled down rapidly.

"You... what are you doing?"

"Looking for acupoints."

"Huh?"

"Yeah, a massage martial art I just improved. I'll be using it on guests in the future. Congratulations on getting the trial qualification."

"I don't need it..."

"It won't hurt to try. You helped me scrub my back last time."

Li Mo figured this should count as an investment too.

...

Outside the corner of the VIP room in Micro Love.

"I shouldn't have come!"

"I thought the kid was in trouble and came to check, and I get to see this?"

"Let's go, damn it, I won't be able to sleep tonight."

Three elders of the Clear Abyss Sect cursed and went about their own business.
