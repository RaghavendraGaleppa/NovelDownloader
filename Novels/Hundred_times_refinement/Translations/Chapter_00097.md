# Chapter 47: The Beast Soul Talisman

A fierce wind howled, scattering the dust and smoke. Yan Tianheng held a talisman in his hand, his spiritual power pouring into it like a bursting dam. Seeing this, Lin Xuan's expression grew even more solemn—this was clearly no ordinary talisman.

Naturally, Lin Xuan wasn't foolish enough to wait for his opponent to complete the spell. He prepared to strike, but at that moment, a sinister smile curled at the corners of Yan Tianheng's lips. With a flick of his wrist, he hurled the talisman into the air and bellowed, "Soul, unseal!"

**Roar!**

A thunderous roar echoed through the mountains, shaking the trees and sending leaves fluttering down like rain. The talisman blazed with light, and within the crimson glow, a massive tiger wreathed in flames materialized.

A Blazing Tiger? No—its body was also encased in bony spikes. This was an Ironclad Blazing Tiger, a top-tier first-grade demon beast.

Just as cultivators were divided into eight stages from Qi Refining to Transcendence, demon beasts were also classified from first to eighth grade, each further divided into lower, middle, upper, and top tiers.

Qi Refining corresponded to first-grade demon beasts, Foundation Establishment to second-grade, and so on...

This meant the beast before him was as powerful as a peak Qi Refining expert.

Lin Xuan's expression soured. This was no illusion—it was a genuine demon beast, or more accurately, the soul of one. He hadn't expected his opponent to possess such a rare Beast Talisman.

Beast Talismans, like Formation Talismans, belonged to a special category. Ordinary talismans contained defensive, offensive, or auxiliary spells, while Formation Talismans housed simple arrays. Beast Talismans, however, were different—they sealed the souls of demon beasts within them, making them even rarer than Formation Talismans. They weren't crafted by ordinary cultivators but by those who practiced ghostly arts.

In essence, after slaying a demon beast, the practitioner would extract its soul and use special refining methods to seal it into a talisman. Unlike disposable talismans, Beast Talismans could be reused—though not indefinitely. Each activation consumed the soul's energy, and once depleted, the talisman would become useless.

Lin Xuan had once read about Beast Talismans in an ancient text, but he never imagined he'd encounter one in person.

**Roar!**

The terrifying roar, though from a soul, had been refined through ghostly arts and was every bit as fearsome as the real beast.

"Go!" Yan Tianheng formed a hand seal and pointed. The Ironclad Blazing Tiger transformed into a streak of red light, charging at Lin Xuan with claws bared.

---

The situation was dire, but Lin Xuan remained calm. He activated the talisman in his hand and tossed it into the air.

Quicksand, falling boulders, thorny vines—five low-tier spells erupted simultaneously. Yet they only slowed the beast momentarily before it lunged again.

Lin Xuan's expression darkened. It was time to use his spirit artifact.

He reached into his robe and withdrew a foot-long rope. Muttering an incantation, he channeled his spiritual sense, and the rope suddenly came alive. It expanded with the wind, stretching several zhang in length, coiling like a venomous snake ready to strike.

"Bind!"

At his command, the rope shot forward, emitting a faint white glow. Like an intelligent python, it wrapped tightly around the Ironclad Blazing Tiger. Though the beast was a spectral entity, the spirit artifact was equally mystical, capable of restraining it.

"A spirit artifact?!" Yan Tianheng gasped, his face twisting in shock. No wonder—spirit artifacts were incredibly rare treasures. While theoretically usable by fourth-tier Qi Refining cultivators, even some Foundation Establishment experts might not possess one.

Lin Xuan's endless talismans had already stunned him, but now he even had a spirit artifact? This discovery sent a chill down Yan Tianheng's spine.

Mid-grade pills, an inexhaustible supply of talismans, and a spirit artifact—even elite sect disciples might not possess such wealth, let alone a rogue cultivator. Who was this kid?

With such extravagant resources, his master must be an extraordinary figure—perhaps even a Core Formation expert!

The more Yan Tianheng thought, the more terrified he became.

Yet as the head of a family, he didn't lose his composure. Instead, his resolve to kill Lin Xuan grew stronger. If this boy escaped and his master came seeking vengeance, Yan Tianheng would be doomed. No matter what, he had to eliminate him here.

It wasn't paranoia—Lin Xuan's treasures were simply too shocking, enough to make anyone's imagination run wild.

Though determined to kill Lin Xuan, the task was daunting. While Lin Xuan was three tiers weaker in cultivation, his spirit artifact was a formidable obstacle.

Lin Xuan, too, was frustrated. His spiritual power was still too weak to wield a high-grade spirit artifact effectively. If only he could use the top-grade Frostfire Ring from Zhang Yu or even Zhou Yan's high-grade flying sword, dealing with Yan Tianheng would be effortless.

Both men sought the other's death. One desperately urged the tiger to break free, while the other struggled to maintain his grip with the spirit artifact. Once again, they reached a stalemate.

As time passed, Lin Xuan began to fidget anxiously, scratching his head like an ant on a hot pan. Yan Tianheng smirked inwardly—this youngster truly lacked patience. Victory would be his.

Two minutes later, Lin Xuan reached into his robe again. Yan Tianheng's expression darkened—more talismans? Activating the beast soul while simultaneously casting mid-tier spells wasn't impossible, but the spiritual energy consumption would be immense. If Lin Xuan still had a stockpile...

But then, Yan Tianheng's face twisted into a savage grin. Lin Xuan withdrew his hand—empty—and his expression turned panicked.

Heaven favors me! The brat's talismans are exhausted!
