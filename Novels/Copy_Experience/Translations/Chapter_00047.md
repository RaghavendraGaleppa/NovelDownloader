**Chapter 47: Reaching Qi Condensation Layer Seven**

One day, two years later.

Lu Xu, who was seated cross-legged in the cultivation chamber, slowly opened his eyes. Two streaks of azure light flashed in his eyes, and an intimidating aura, though restrained, was palpable.

Looking at the pile of jade bottles on the ground, Lu Xu couldn't help but sigh, "I've consumed so many pills! I've finally reached the threshold of entering Qi Condensation Layer Seven!"

Lu Xu inwardly observed his body and saw an azure qi mass, the size of a red date, slowly rotating and rising and falling in his Dantian. From this qi mass, wisps of slightly "moist" azure qi flowed out, entering the meridians throughout his body. That was the spiritual energy from cultivating Qi Condensation Layer Six to its peak. Lu Xu could clearly feel that his spiritual energy had reached its limit and could advance no further. If he continued, no matter how many more pills he consumed, it would be a waste.

He had encountered a bottleneck! The bottleneck of the late Qi Condensation stage, a bottleneck that could trap cultivators with mid-to-low spiritual roots for over a decade.

"If I hadn't prepared in advance, who knows how long this bottleneck would have trapped me! But now..."

A gleam flashed in Lu Xu's eyes. He flipped his palm, and a jade bottle appeared in his hand. Opening the jade bottle, a pungent aroma emanated from within. Upon closer inspection, it contained a reddish-purple pill: the Barrier-Breaking Pill! This was a pill that could sell for seven hundred spirit stones, and critically, it was often hard to find even if one had the money. Most cultivators in the mid-Qi Condensation stage simply couldn't afford this price.

Lu Xu tilted his head back, poured the pill from the jade bottle into his mouth, closed his eyes, and continued cultivating. As the pungent aroma spread, a reddish-purple torrent surged into his Dantian. The azure qi flows intertwined with these reddish-purple lights. Gradually, one reddish-purple aura after another was captured by the azure qi mass and absorbed into it.

The azure qi mass began to undergo drastic changes. It stopped rotating, trembling continuously, and began to slowly swell and contract, changing incessantly. With each expansion and contraction, the interior of the azure qi mass seemed to be gestating something extremely unstable. This sight was terrifying, making one fear it might suddenly "bang" and explode. If it truly exploded, then this breakthrough would be considered a failure.

But Lu Xu had, after all, copied others' breakthrough experiences, so how could he falter at such a critical juncture? He steadily controlled the changes of the azure qi mass, calmly allowing it to slowly contract. As the azure qi mass contracted, wisps of "dampness" gradually arose within Lu Xu's Dantian! Those azure qi flows began to resemble mist, hazy and indistinct, giving a sensation of being very "heavy."

Finally, when the azure qi mass compressed to the size of a soybean, it swiftly broke free from its unstable state of expansion and contraction, regaining stability. After a slight pause, this soybean-sized azure qi mass began to rotate and rise and fall once more. Wisps of dense spiritual energy flew out from it, entering his meridians, immediately making Lu Xu feel a powerful force.

Lu Xu suddenly opened his eyes; light seemed to emanate from the empty chamber. A powerful aura diffused from him, causing his entire robe to billow. Qi Condensation Layer Seven, breakthrough achieved!

Lu Xu stood up, feeling an unprecedented power. If he were to encounter that burly man again now, he could definitely kill him with ease. After breaking through this bottleneck, his spiritual energy underwent another qualitative change; his strength could be called a leap. Cultivators in the late Qi Condensation stage, no matter where in Wei Nation, were revered experts!

Lu Xu closed his eyes and inwardly observed, his consciousness arriving before the bluestone tablet:

"Fifteen years of cultivation to enter the late Qi Condensation stage, with thirty years remaining until the heavenly threshold of sixty. Reaching Great Perfection in Qi Condensation within thirty years should be easy! As for Foundation Establishment, I'll have to start considering it from now on!"

Opening his eyes, a trace of emotion flashed in Lu Xu's gaze. With his cultivation speed, he was definitely among the top ranks of cultivators of this generation in Wei Nation. Most high-grade spiritual roots weren't even as fast as him.

"I'll have to be careful when I go out from now on. I absolutely cannot let anyone connect me with that spirit farmer from Green Lake Market City! Although the possibility of my identity as 'Spirit Farmer Lu Xu' being noticed is extremely small, I can't stand against the suspicions of those with ulterior motives. Before I have sufficient strength, I absolutely cannot let anyone know I originated from Green Lake Market City! Gao Tianqiang remains a hidden danger. I need to find a way to deal with him!"

A fleeting killing intent flashed in Lu Xu's eyes. He walked out of the cultivation chamber and opened the long-sealed door.

In the distance, a figure, upon seeing the door open, immediately ran over.

"The Fourth Prince's invitation?" Lu Xu took the gilded invitation card handed to him by the mortal youth, his heart filled with extreme surprise. How did the Fourth Prince of Wei Nation's imperial family notice him?

"Reporting, Immortal Master, this invitation was personally given to this humble one by the Fourth Prince. He specifically instructed me to ensure it reaches the Immortal Master's hands!" the mortal youth said with utmost respect.

"What is the Fourth Prince inviting me for?" Lu Xu asked, frowning.

"This humble one does not know the details!"

After a moment of contemplation, Lu Xu waved his hand, dismissing the mortal youth. He closed the door and opened the invitation. A few lines of text were written on it. The gist was that the Fourth Prince would soon host a banquet, inviting some relatively renowned and powerful Qi Condensation cultivators to gather. He hoped Lu Xu would not hesitate to honor the invitation with his presence.

"He even specifically sent an invitation to my door. How did this person notice me?" Lu Xu was filled with confusion. It wasn't uncommon for princes to host banquets and invite cultivators. It was nothing more than these individuals wanting to win over some powerful rogue cultivators to serve as their guest elders. But since this Fourth Prince was inviting well-known and powerful individuals, it should be impossible for him to send an invitation to Lu Xu's door. He was neither well-known nor powerful, and he had been extremely low-key in Skygate City.

"Thinking carefully, how could he have known about me? Could it be that Gao Tianqiang was captured by him? Or perhaps, that Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma from last time? That high-grade alchemist?" Lu Xu pondered for a moment and felt there were only these two possibilities. He was so low-key on a daily basis; only through these two channels could someone trace him.

"So, I've still been targeted after all, and by someone from the Wei family. It seems I can't stay in Skygate City anymore! But before leaving, I mustn't miss out on that martial arts secret technique from the Wei family! The Fourth Prince, huh? Heh heh, I remember Mo Changzong seemed to say he had a great chance of forming Foundation. If that's the case, then he must be a core figure of the Wei family! The probability of this person cultivating that martial arts secret technique is extremely high!"
