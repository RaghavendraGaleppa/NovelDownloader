# Chapter 13: The Legendary Assassin Organization  

At the break of dawn, the black-clad leader arrived in the courtyard. With a simple wave of his hand and few words, he commanded, "Move out!"  

All the assassins swiftly assembled and followed him in single file. The streets were empty—curfew hadn't lifted yet, and commoners dared not wander outside. The only sound was the rhythmic footsteps of the black-clad group.  

Upon reaching the southern gate of Yongchang City, the men removed the wooden bar and opened the gate, revealing a drawbridge outside. Without waiting for them to lower it, the leader leaped forward like a dragonfly skimming water, drew his sword, and struck the iron chains three times in rapid succession.  

*Clang!*  

The chains snapped instantly. The leader repeated the feat on the other side, and the drawbridge collapsed with a thunderous crash. The assassins exchanged glances but knew better than to interrupt their leader's display of prowess.  

*If you're strong, you can do whatever you want!*  

The leader frowned slightly as he examined his sword, now chipped with a grain-sized notch, and casually tossed it into the moat. Lin Shan, observing from the crowd, narrowed his eyes thoughtfully.  

The guards on the city walls watched helplessly as the black-clad group departed. *Why destroy the bridge when no one was stopping you? Do experts just do whatever they please?*  

---  

The group traveled south for about ten miles before dragging over a dozen cargo carts from the bushes—the very same shipment Lin Clan Escort had been transporting for the government the previous day. Clearly, the assassins had hauled them here overnight and were now delivering them to their employer.  

Lin Shan followed the convoy as it continued south, seemingly heading toward Zangke Commandery. After another thirty or forty miles, they arrived at a desolate area near an abandoned courier station, where the leader ordered a rest.  

No one questioned the decision, scattering to find spots to sit. Lin Shan and Scarface deliberately kept their distance from each other. By midday, everyone pulled out dry rations and water bags, eating in silence.  

Hours passed. As dusk approached, dust rose from the road they had come from.  

*"Hyah!"*  

*"Hyah!"*  

*"Whoa!"*  

A troop of armored cavalry arrived, dismounting in front of the station. There were about twenty to thirty soldiers, followed by forty or fifty attendants. The Nightingale assassins tensed, some even gripping their weapons.  

Unfazed, the black-clad leader stepped forward. "Who is Vice Governor Yang?"  

A middle-aged man emerged from the opposing group, dressed in scholarly attire with an official’s black gauze hat. His dignified demeanor and faint smile were unmistakable, with soldiers flanking him protectively.  

"I am Yang Huaili. Are you Protector Jiang of Nightingale?"  

The leader nodded curtly and gestured to the cargo carts. Vice Governor Yang motioned to his men. "Inspect the goods."  

Soldiers moved forward, meticulously checking the carts. Thanks to his enhanced senses from cultivating innate techniques, Lin Shan could overhear the conversation between the official and Protector Jiang. A realization struck him—Yang Huaili was none other than the right-hand man of Qinghe Commandery’s governor.  

*The very governor who had commissioned Lin Clan Escort for this shipment!*  

Lin Shan’s breath hitched. *Was the governor embezzling state resources by hiring assassins to steal his own shipment?* The pieces fell into place. The world had grown so corrupt that even a governor could brazenly orchestrate such schemes.  

His heart ached for the late Escort Leader Wang and the hundred-odd men who had died—unwitting sacrifices to their employer’s greed. What role had the Lin Clan played in this? With so many cavalry and a vice governor traveling this far, how could the influential Lin family be unaware?  

A chilling thought struck him—*They were all expendable pawns.* The Lin Clan must have struck a deal with the authorities, sacrificing even a first-rate martial artist for whatever was in those carts.  

And if any escort had survived and returned to Qinghe...  

Lin Shan thought of Old Pu, the veteran who had dreamed of retiring with fifty taels of silver.  

*"I hope I’m wrong,"* he murmured, closing his eyes.  

---  

After the handover, the carts were hauled away by the cavalry, vanishing in a cloud of dust. As the sun set, Protector Jiang raised his hand again. "Move out!"  

The assassins followed him deeper south.  

By midnight, after a grueling fifty-mile march, the exhausted killers panted heavily but dared not complain. Ahead loomed a towering city wall, ten meters high, its battlements lined with blazing braziers. A sign above the gate read: *Zangke Commandery*.  

This was a crucial stronghold of the Great Song Dynasty’s southwestern frontier. Beyond lay the territory of the Southern Barbarians, who had recently adopted Song institutions and even proclaimed their own dynasty—Dali. Years ago, they had seized Guangnan Commandery, prompting the imperial court to reinforce Zangke as a defensive bulwark.  

Now, with relative peace restored, Zangke had become a bustling trade hub.  

The assassins waited in silence beneath the walls. Moments later, rope baskets descended, and the men ascended in batches.  

On the ramparts, a garrison commander spoke deferentially to Protector Jiang before the group slipped into the city under cover of darkness. Navigating winding alleys, they finally arrived at an elegant building with a plaque reading *Jing’an Hall*.  

Inside, the scene was worlds apart from the quiet streets.  

Carved rosewood, sandalwood incense, and blazing lanterns illuminated a bustling hall packed with over a hundred black-clad assassins. Some leaped in through windows, others vanished into sewers—all masked and aloof.  

Lin Shan’s gaze swept across tiered balconies before settling on the center, where clerks registered tasks listed on a massive board:  

- **Assassinate Guangnan’s Hero Zhang Tumang – 20 contribution points.**  
- **Intercept Magistrate Zhiyuan’s inauguration – dead or alive – 15 points.**  
- **Rescue General Qiao’s daughter – unharmed – 10 points.**  
- **Kill the son of Dali’s Censor-in-Chief – 10 points.**  
- **Locate the hideout of the Mengshan Seven Bandits – 5 points.**  

Lin Shan was astounded. The board overflowed with missions spanning martial, political, and military spheres.  

*So this is the legendary assassin organization?*
