# Chapter 85: Descending the Mountain

At this moment, Han Yue was still wrestling with his newly acquired secret technique, *Summoning Thunder*. 

Half a month had passed since he obtained the technique from Li Changle. He had spent each day meticulously studying it, finding immense insights within. 

*Summoning Thunder* contained a unique method of invoking the primordial energy of lightning. Even under clear skies without a trace of rain, a practitioner could summon a thundercloud of energy. Once gathered, this thundercloud allowed the cultivator to channel lightning energy to temper their Golden Core, enhancing its stored power and deepening its refinement. 

For second-stage cultivators, this technique was particularly suitable—an efficient method for cultivation. With the protection of the Great Dao Golden Core, the power of the lightning could be controlled, preventing harm to the practitioner’s body. 

However, for those still in the Body Entry stage, *Summoning Thunder* was typically unusable. Their strength was insufficient to control the summoned lightning energy, making self-injury highly likely. In such cases, not only would their cultivation fail to progress, but they might also suffer severe injuries. 

But Han Yue was different. With his two Dao-bearing artifacts—*Demon-Slaying Sword* and *Dutian Seal*—he could withstand the initial impact of the lightning energy. Moreover, his *Sweet Dew* divine ability served as a safety net; even if he suffered grave injuries, he could recover. This gave him the confidence to attempt *Summoning Thunder* while still in the Body Entry stage. 

Li Changle, with his vast experience and sharp insight, had foreseen Han Yue’s potential and thus selected this perfectly suited technique for him. 

Once Han Yue fully grasped the intricacies of *Summoning Thunder*, he knew it was time to descend the mountain. 

Out of habit, he sent word of his departure via *Minor Thunderclap Technique*, receiving blessings from his fellow disciples before setting off. 

After over three years of cultivation, Han Yue was no longer the same person he had been. His strength had grown exponentially, far surpassing what it had been during the *Flesh Division Trials*. His knowledge had also expanded—no longer an ignorant novice, he was now a true disciple of a major sect. 

Leaving the gates of the Divine Thunder Palace, he soared southward along the Heavenly River on his escape light. 

The further south he traveled, the wider the river became, flanked by endless stretches of dark, rolling hills. Han Yue knew that beneath these hills lay untold quantities of precious metals. If these ores could be mined and transported out of Luzhou, they would yield immense wealth. 

Yet, buried beneath the endless calamities of this land, these metals remained untapped. 

In any world, mining and refining metal ores required vast amounts of labor and resources. But in the Golden Blade Gorge of Luzhou, such conditions were absent. The land was desolate, its environment perilous, and most of the Divine Thunder Palace’s disciples—the de facto stewards of the region—were impoverished. Moreover, the distance to potential markets made the metals impractical to sell even if extracted. Transporting them out of Luzhou would be prohibitively expensive. 

No one willingly chooses poverty. Over the years, many desperate disciples of the Divine Thunder Palace had turned their eyes to these plains, hoping to mine third-grade materials for crafting Dao-bearing artifacts. But success was rare. 

Third-grade materials lay buried deep within the earth, requiring mineshafts extending over five thousand meters—a near-impossible feat for those below the third stage. Even if one managed to dig such a shaft, without the ability to survey the underground terrain, there was no guarantee of finding the desired materials. And the ever-present lightning storms of the Golden Blade Gorge could easily destroy any excavation efforts, rendering all labor futile. 

At his current strength, Han Yue had no hope of succeeding. He could only watch as these precious minerals remained locked beneath the earth. 

Following the river, he sped toward the Golden Blade Waterfall. His *Earth-Traversing Golden Light Technique* allowed him to move swiftly, unaffected by the land’s gravitational anomalies. With this supreme escape technique, Han Yue could traverse Luzhou unimpeded, avoiding its many natural disasters. 

The Heavenly River flowed ceaselessly across the plains toward the sea. As Han Yue flew, covering thousands of miles without encountering another soul, he was struck by the vastness of the land. The endless river and the boundless, perilous plains made him feel as though he might be the only living being in this expanse. The thought stirred his spirit, broadening his perspective. 

This was an experience he could never have gained through secluded cultivation—a reshaping of his sense of space and scale. 

By the standards of his past life, humanity was insignificant before nature’s grandeur. But in this world of cultivation, where individuals could ascend to immortality, humans could conquer and reshape nature itself. 

Han Yue’s Dao heart surged with inspiration. His desire to cultivate burned fiercer than ever, driving him toward the goal of transcending mortality and becoming a deity capable of reshaping heaven and earth. 

At last, he reached his first destination—the Golden Blade Waterfall, cascading from tens of thousands of meters in the sky. 

The sight left him awestruck. 

Here, the Golden Blade Gorge met the Flaming Mountains, one layer above as a metallic graveyard, the other below as a molten hell. The horizon abruptly dropped, marking the boundary between two worlds. The Heavenly River plunged downward with a thunderous roar, creating a spectacle Han Yue had never witnessed before. 

Hovering above the waterfall, he gazed at the torrent, sensing within it immense power, profound significance, and terrifying might. 

Beneath the waterfall lay the Golden Blade Lake, its waters crystal clear and teeming with *Golden Blade Swordfish*—a species of supernatural fish no higher than the second stage. These fish thrived on the metallic sediment swept down by the waterfall, existing as unique metallic lifeforms inedible to humans. Instead, they could be used as weapons when caught. 

After reaching the waterfall, Han Yue turned eastward, following the boundary between the Golden Blade Gorge and the Flaming Mountains. He flew thousands of kilometers before stopping atop a small metallic hill near a cliff. 

Below, the Flaming Mountains had begun to show signs of volcanic activity, with plumes of dark red smoke rising from the earth. 

In this desolate expanse, devoid of life for thousands of miles, no one could interfere with his plans. 

Standing on the hill, Han Yue prepared to perform *Summoning Thunder* for the first time. 

In his right hand, he held the *Supreme Cave True Thunder Demon-Slaying Sword*; in his left, he formed the summoning seal. Channeling his energy according to the technique, he activated the art. 

Above, thunderclouds gathered, crackling with power. Han Yue stood directly beneath them, anchored by their energy. 

A profound sense of danger gripped him, tightening his spirit. He felt like prey locked in the gaze of a predator, an instinctive urge to flee surging within him. 

This was the first time he had deliberately placed himself in such peril. 

As the thunderclouds reached their peak, a massive bolt of lightning descended at his summons. 

A tremendous force struck him. Han Yue raised the *Demon-Slaying Sword* to meet it. 

Instantly, a surge of lightning energy coursed through the sword into his body, violently flooding his dantian under the technique’s guidance. The energy was overwhelming—far exceeding his current capacity—yet he strained to contain it. 

His dantian felt on the verge of bursting. 

But the true terror was yet to come. 

Though he withstood the first bolt, the thunderclouds remained. Before he could react, a second bolt struck. 

Now, Han Yue was powerless to resist. His dantian was saturated, his energy circulation disrupted. He could only brace himself as the lightning struck. 

Without space to absorb it, the full force of the bolt ravaged his body. 

Agony wracked him—his muscles convulsed, his breath fled, his consciousness flickered. Like a fish out of water, he spasmed violently, flung into the air before crashing back to the ground.
