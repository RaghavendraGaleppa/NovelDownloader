# Chapter 12: Merit Lottery, Death-Substitute Yin Ghouls

"A colorful Merit Fish, a billion-point grand prize."

Since the relevant news had already spread far and wide and everyone was discussing it, Lu Yang didn't need much effort to figure out the full story.

It turned out that within the Primal Saint Sect, there was a standing special mission called "Accumulating Merit." The location was beneath Saint Fire Cliff, deep within the Sea of Clouds, a treasure land named "Merit Pool." Within the pool lived a unique spirit beast called the "Merit Fish."

The fish came in five colors: white, blue, purple, gold, and colorful. The closer to colorful, the more abundant the Merit Fish's vital essence. Consuming it could not only improve the quality of true qi but also had the effect of breaking through bottlenecks. The so-called "Accumulating Merit" mission was born from this.

This mission was limited to one attempt per person per month. One would first blind-select a number, then pay 10 contribution points to take out the Merit Fish corresponding to that number. However, the 10 contribution points paid by cultivators were not recovered by the Saint Sect. Instead, they were recorded in the Merit Pool's accounts. High-ranking officials of the Saint Sect had specifically explained this: anyone who selected the only colorful Merit Fish in the Merit Pool would receive all the contribution points accumulated within the Merit Pool!

And nearly a hundred years had passed since this mission was first released. Yet, in a hundred years, no one had selected the colorful Merit Fish. As a result, the contribution points in the pool accumulated more and more, becoming an astronomical figure.

"A billion! A billion!"

In the rocking chair, the old man was still mumbling softly, his tone full of envy, jealousy, and resentment. Just yesterday, this "Merit Lottery" super prize finally had a winner, and the disciple who won it had been an inner disciple for less than ten days. A century's prize pool, claimed by a newcomer who had joined less than ten days ago!

No wonder the old man of the Scripture Pavilion felt unbalanced; after all, a portion of that billion-point prize came from his own participation in the Merit Pool mission over the years. Not to mention that Xiao Shiye, while receiving the billion-point grand prize from the Merit Pool, also obtained the most precious colorful Merit Fish. After consuming it, he broke through from Qi Refining First Layer to Qi Refining Consummation overnight. He had now been taken as a disciple by a True Human within the sect and was in secluded cultivation, preparing to attempt Foundation Establishment.

Such a situation made even Lu Yang unable to help but show a look of envy.

However, his gaze soon changed... because the lucky winner, Xiao Shiye, had not concealed the number he chose when he drew the colorful Merit Fish: "2025113". Looking at this number, Lu Yang couldn't help but swallow.

Just as Lu Yang firmly committed this string of numbers to memory, preparing to use it in his next life, a graceful figure suddenly walked into the Scripture Pavilion.

"Junior Brother Lu?"

Lu Yang looked up in response and immediately recognized the person: it was Fairy Qingchen. She seemed surprised too, her pretty face showing a hint of pleasant surprise at the unexpected encounter.

"Oh, it's Qingchen. Is it time?"

The old man of the Scripture Pavilion also saw Fairy Qingchen. His originally bored expression instantly turned serious. He stood up and said, "Then let's set off quickly."

"Senior Brother, are you also going to explore the cave abode?" Lu Yang asked curiously.

"Otherwise?" The old man of the Scripture Pavilion said irritably, "I just lost a large sum of money. If I don't find some extra work, I'll be eating the northwest wind!"

"Lost a large sum of money?"

"Sigh, it was my carelessness," the old man of the Scripture Pavilion sighed. "Some time ago, the Saint Sect had a big battle with the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion in Jiangnan. The Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion came prepared and forcibly seized a 'Ten Thousand Corpses Pit' belonging to the Saint Sect in the south. The 'Death-Substitute Yin Ghouls' produced in that Ten Thousand Corpses Pit are very precious rare treasures. When the Ten Thousand Corpses Pit was captured, their price within the Saint Sect immediately soared. At first, everyone was hoarding goods. Out of caution, I watched for a while. Later, I found that the price indeed only rose and never fell. Feeling that the opportunity was fleeting, I then made a move and hoarded a batch of goods from others at a high price."

At this point, the old man of the Scripture Pavilion was utterly distraught, slapping his thigh in regret: "Who would have thought that no sooner had I finished hoarding than news came that the Saint Sect had launched a counterattack and retaken the Ten Thousand Corpses Pit? As a result, the price that had just risen plummeted instantly, even lower than the original price!"

Lu Yang: "..."

"But thankfully, there's Qingchen." The old man of the Scripture Pavilion sighed for a moment, then immediately cheered up again, exclaiming, "Qingchen is a good person!"

Fairy Qingchen smiled shyly, "Senior Brother, you flatter me."

"Truly from the bottom of my heart," the old man of the Scripture Pavilion said sincerely. "If you hadn't recommended Senior Brother Zhao to me, I'm afraid I wouldn't even have gotten my capital back."

"It was just a small effort," Fairy Qingchen said modestly. "Senior Brother Zhao happened to need a batch of Death-Substitute Yin Ghouls, and Senior Brother, you happened to have a hoard of them. I merely happened to be in the right place at the right time. I only hope that when we explore the cave abode later, if there's anything Qingchen fancies, Senior Brother can help Qingchen a little."

Senior Brother Zhao... Zhao Xuhe? Lu Yang's heart stirred slightly.

"Oh, right, Junior Brother Lu." Only then did Fairy Qingchen seem to remember Lu Yang. She turned her head and looked at him: "This time exploring the cave abode, Junior Brother truly doesn't intend to come along?"

"...You make Senior Sister laugh." Lu Yang shook his head and said, "Junior Brother has just entered the sect not long ago and is weak in both power and influence. I only wish to focus on cultivation. Exploring cave abodes is too dangerous, and I truly lack the ability, despite my willingness."

"Kid, I don't like what you're saying." The old man of the Scripture Pavilion shook his head: "Focus on cultivation? For ordinary disciples like us, who have no money or power, just burying our heads in cultivation won't lead to an immortal path. Cultivating immortals is inherently defying the heavens. If you don't take risks, how can your cultivation advance by leaps and bounds? When everyone else is afraid and wants to retreat, that's when you should be even braver to try and strive, only then can you seize opportunities!"

*Others are fearful, you are greedy. No wonder you went bankrupt,* Lu Yang thought to himself.

No matter how eloquently the old man of the Scripture Pavilion spoke, Lu Yang politely refused, making the old man so angry that he left with a remark about "rotten wood cannot be carved" (meaning someone untrainable/hopeless).

Seeing this, Fairy Qingchen also found it hard to say more. She just gave Lu Yang a deep look, then turned and left, accompanying the old man of the Scripture Pavilion to a hidden cave abode on Butian Peak. She then asked the old man to wait in the outer courtyard before she entered the inner courtyard, arriving before a quiet room.

A moment later, the door to the quiet room opened, and Zhao Xuhe strode out.

"Failed again? He still didn't agree?" Zhao Xuhe listened to Fairy Qingchen's account, his brows gradually furrowing: "He truly has a firm Dao heart. No matter, his absence won't make much difference."

"Senior Brother, I think there's something wrong with this person." Fairy Qingchen lightly bit her silver teeth: "The life lamps of my three paramours went out. Last night I sent them to kill that guy. It seems they failed. Senior Brother, you know that my three paramours were all at Qi Refining Third Layer. If Lu Yang could kill them... could he already be at mid-stage cultivation?"

"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" Zhao Xuhe shook his head without hesitation: "Breaking through a bottleneck is not easy. In just a few days, at most he could have broken through to Qi Refining Third Layer; breaking into the mid-stage is impossible. You don't need to be so suspicious. I've checked his purchase records. He used a cultivation technique loan to buy a divine ability, the Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art from the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion," Zhao Xuhe meticulously analyzed. "If he has extraordinary talent and comprehension in the way of the sword, and can quickly master the sword art, then slaying your three paramours wouldn't be surprising."

"Senior Brother is right," Fairy Qingchen pondered for a moment and felt that Zhao Xuhe's analysis was more reasonable. After all, she had personally experienced how difficult the mid-stage bottleneck was. It took her nearly ten years to barely break through. To say that a newly initiated disciple broke through in less than a month, unless he was a True Human reborn and re-cultivating, it would be sheer fantasy.

"Alright, we'll discuss this matter later." Zhao Xuhe waved his hand, a cold glint in his eyes: "First, let's deal with the 'cave abode' matter. Have all the people been gathered?"

"Yes," Fairy Qingchen nodded. "Especially Wang Bairong from the Scripture Pavilion. Senior Brother bought his Death-Substitute Yin Ghouls, and he trusts us greatly now."

"That's good." Zhao Xuhe smiled coldly: "My Saint Sect has always been abundant in talent. Whether we can make a huge profit this time depends entirely on my fellow disciples..."
