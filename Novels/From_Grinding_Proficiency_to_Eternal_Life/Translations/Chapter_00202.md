# Chapter 202: Force Dissipation

Watching the successive ring-shaped airwaves kicked up by the rapidly plummeting figure, Tuoba Lie suddenly laughed, his expression filled with extreme excitement. He gripped the Xuanhua Great Axe with both hands, the muscles on his arms bulging prominently, and visible vital energy steamed around his body, forming a blood mist.

"Come!"

Just as the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, wreathed in crimson lightning arcs, was about to strike down, Tuoba Lie's skin turned a faint crimson. Through his reddened flesh, one could clearly see blood vessels that looked like flowing magma.

The moment the axe blade swept up to meet the attack, seven blood纹 (patterns) erupted from his spine. His knotted muscles suddenly swelled by two sizes.

The forged steel hammer head collided with the Xuanhua axe blade, erupting a three-zhang fire ring. The gravel within a radius of ten zhang was pulverized into dust by the shockwave, and a large section of the ground collapsed three zhang deep.

Tuoba Lie was directly hammered deep into the ground by this overhead descending strike.

The Hundred-Refined Forged Steel Body dissipated the counterforce, while the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength guided the energy, erupting through the first stance of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique—Starfalling Heavenly River.

The power unleashed far exceeded what a typical Muscle Refining Realm cultivator could imagine.

When Xu Yunfan's forged steel combat boots shattered the rock layer, the entire rift valley echoed with the sound of a great bell or cauldron. The intense wind pressure forced the still-battling双方 (both sides) to halt their movements.

The wandering martial artists took the opportunity to shout at the crowd, urging them to take shelter in safe areas.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan wore Forged Steel Meteoric Iron Armor. The cold青 (cyan) face of the armor was faintly etched with dragon scale patterns, and the gluttonous beast shoulder guards at the joints exhaled赤红 (crimson) energy.

The seven dragon blood crystal grooves on his heart-protecting mirror glowed with a molten luster, and the interconnected waist and abdominal armor plates made a clanking sound of meteoric iron chain links with his movements.

The tiger-head wrist guards faintly revealed twelve air holes, and wherever the steel spikes on his combat boots crushed down, gravel mixed with blood residue splattered into a mist.

This set of armor was originally a commission he was forging for the Great Zhou military department; now, it was worn on his own body.

"Junior Brother!?"

Fu Jin, who had been blown away by the shockwave, coughed up blood continuously, looking at Xu Yunfan who had appeared before him with an expression of shock.

Xu Yunfan glanced sideways at Fu Jin. Although he was still coughing blood, his voice was full of energy, so his life was not in danger.

"Senior Brother, your condition seems a bit unfavorable."

Fu Jin gave a bitter smile and was about to speak when a sudden movement came from below the large pit smashed open by the heavy hammer.

A drum-like heartbeat sound came from the bottom of the deep pit; every muffled thud made the gravel tremble and roll down.

Xu Yunfan's expression paused slightly. The steel spikes on his combat boots crushed the rocks at his feet, and the Red Serpent energy between the gaps in his玄甲 (dark armor) circulated once more. He reached out and grabbed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer.

Xu Yunfan stepped back half a step, holding the hammer horizontally to block, only to see Tuoba Lie's figure, bursting out from the ground, charge at him fiercely, carrying with it a storm of gravel.

Xu Yunfan showed no sign of panic.

*Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique, Cloud Gate Locks the Mountain.*

The muscles on Xu Yunfan's right arm, as if cast from forged steel, writhed and knotted. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength exploded along his spine, segment by segment.

The hammer shadow transformed into nine illusory images, bringing with it a thunderous roar of air as it pressed down violently. Each illusory shadow that landed caused Tuoba Lie's body to crack open with bloody wounds.

Tuoba Lie, whose true blood within his body was boiling to the extreme, now had bloodshot eyes. He actually disregarded the attack completely and threw a punch. The fist锋 (edge) brought up successive airwaves, and the sharp shriek of tearing air sounded in an instant.

*Boom!*

The heavy hammer slammed squarely into Tuoba Lie's body, while Tuoba Lie's fist, like a cannon hammer, smashed onto Xu Yunfan's cheek.

Visible air ripples suddenly spread out. Tuoba Lie, as if struck by a mountain, flew and rolled dozens of meters away, smashing through countless large trees. Finally, he crashed into a stone wall, causing spiderweb-like cracks to spread out in all directions before he stopped.

In contrast, Xu Yunfan, after taking that punch, the face guard on his face shattered. The immense force of the fist made his eyeballs vibrate up and down several times.

His entire body's muscles trembled. He retreated seven steps. With every step back, his foot sank deep into the ground, and the surrounding earth and stone cracked with spiderweb patterns. Until the final step, the retreating step was like a normal daily step, only making a heavy sound.

"Force dissipation!?"

Fu Jin's expression shook. Even for him, it would be very difficult to运用 (apply) the卸力 (force-unloading) method of the Hundred-Refined Forged Steel Body so exquisitely.

"You've reached the Muscle Refining Realm?"

"Yesterday, fortune arrived at my heart, and I broke through accidentally."

Accidentally broke through...

Fu Jin was both shocked and delighted, but he didn't believe Xu Yunfan's words at all. Practicing martial arts wasn't like eating or drinking; every realm requires step-by-step progression. Even with rapid advancement, crossing a major realm requires a considerable amount of time to adapt and change.

Moreover, it was moving from the External Three Unions into the Muscle Refining Realm, generating劲力 (energy).

How could it be like Xu Yunfan, who clearly had been浸淫 (immersed) in the Muscle Refining Realm for a long time, even using the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength more skillfully than him by three-tenths.

The stone wall exploded with a rumble. Tuoba Lie, whose entire body was steaming like mist, seemed as if nothing had happened. He反手 (backhandedly) pulled out the Xuanhua Great Axe embedded in the rock layer.

Xu Yunfan's eyes moved slightly.

"This guy..."

His vitality was simply astonishing.

Fu Jin said: "The Great乾 (Qian) Empire values bloodlines above all. All cultivation revolves around the development of bloodlines, seeking to return to the ancestor and trace the origin, to achieve the body of a Human Immortal. This man possesses true blood, has an astonishing physique, and his strength is formidable. He is absolutely comparable to the Blood Transformation Realm. You..."

Fu Jin suddenly stopped talking.

He discovered that although Xu Yunfan was in the Muscle Refining Realm, he had been suppressing the other party ever since he appeared.

"You, very good, very impressive. To actually be able to beat this General to such a state."

Tuoba Lie grinned, revealing a mouth full of blood.

A dark gleam flickered on the axe blade, actually pulverizing all the gravel along its path into dust.

Xu Yunfan's pupils contracted slightly. The trajectory划过 (traced) by the massive forged steel heavy axe, which was as large as a millstone, distinctly condensed twelve blood-colored afterimages.

"Split the Mountain!"

Tuoba Lie stamped the ground, creating a pit. The great axe, carrying a blood-colored air vortex,劈落 (chopped down).

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged. The instant he spun his body and甩 (swung) the hammer, the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength游走 (wandered) like a dragon between his muscle textures. The forged steel hammer head struck the axe blade unerringly.

*Clang——!*

All the grass and trees within a radius of ten zhang倒伏 (fell flat).

Fu Jin watched helplessly as青红 (cyan and red) interwoven sparks erupted from the point where the two weapons collided. The splashing sparks actually炸出 (exploded out) bowl-sized holes when they landed on the ground.

What was even more terrifying was the spiderweb-like spreading cracks plowed out from under Xu Yunfan's feet,导 (channeling) all the force of the axe chop into the earth's veins.

Both of them were硬打硬进 (fighting hard and advancing hard),寸步不让 (not yielding an inch). Hammer and axe crossed, and every clash of硬碰硬 (hard against hard) would produce a grating sound of metal clashing, echoing throughout the entire valley.

The old, weak, women, and children had long since been led by the struggling and rising Fu Jin and the surviving wandering martial artists to retreat far away.

The Great乾's Luo Net (a type of organization) did not dare to take a step forward. Earlier, someone had wanted to rush into the crowd of women and children with a knife. When Xu Yunfan noticed, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand suddenly transformed into a chain hammer and flew out, turning that person into a puddle of meat paste.

The force dissipation unique to the Hundred-Refined Forged Steel Body, Xu Yunfan naturally would not硬抗 (resist head-on). With every exchange, the earth and stone beneath his feet seemed to be squeezed by immense force,崩裂 (bursting) and flying out.

The quality of the Xuanhua Great Axe in Tuoba Lie's hand was clearly inferior to Xu Yunfan's heavy weapon. The axe blade had already developed大小豁口 (large and small notches).

Tuoba Lie's single eye was bloodshot. The axe handle suddenly旋出 (spun out) nine暗刃 (hidden blades).

Every axe影 (shadow)劈出 (chopped out) contained three layers of force. The叠加 (superposition) of nine layers actually刻道 (carved) visible凹痕 (dents) onto Xu Yunfan's玄甲 (dark armor),凹痕 (dents) that revealed his body shape.
