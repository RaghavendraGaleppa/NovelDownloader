## Chapter Twenty: Dissatisfaction

“Drink! Everyone, drink up!”

Inside a tavern, Pu Liao was clinking glasses with a few men, his expression full of unbridled joy.

“It’s getting late, and the innkeeper is about to close. Perhaps we should call it a night?” a guard asked with a smile.

“The wine isn’t even finished yet, why close up!” Pu Liao turned his head and spat a thick glob of phlegm onto the ground.

The guards exchanged glances, one of them discreetly curling his lip. Although Pu Liao was currently injured and had difficulty with his legs, the Zhang family hadn’t abandoned him after his usefulness expired. Instead, they kept him at the Qingzheng Medical Hall.

But with a broken leg, Pu Liao’s life would be forever changed. Though he was still their leader, his influence had greatly diminished.

After a full half an hour, Pu Liao finally had his fill of food and wine. Trembling and limping, he staggered back to his residence alone.

It was late, the night quiet and still, with no pedestrians left in the county. Pu Liao felt no fear; he even hummed a few tunes out loud.

These past few days, his mood had been consistently good. Even with a injured leg, it couldn't dampen his spirits. This sort of feasting and drinking at the table had been going on for several days.

*Creeeak!*

The old door opened with a groan. Pu Liao entered, locked the door, and lit a candle. Just as he was about to take a sip of the tea on the table, his eyes suddenly caught sight of a figure sitting in the corner.

Seeing Chen Fei approach, Pu Liao’s heart pounded with panic. He roared, “When I first taught you the cultivation method, I deliberately made things difficult for you. I was wrong first. I can apologize to you, even arrange several tables at Yanfei Tower tomorrow to publicly admit my mistake!”

Pu Liao shouted, retreating backward as he did so.

“No need,” Chen Fei shook his head.

“If the Zhang family finds out I’ve been killed, they will thoroughly investigate. Everything requires evidence. If you had evidence that I sent someone to kill you, I would die without resentment. But you’ve found such a flimsy pretext today, I won’t accept it!” Pu Liao cried out in terror.

Chen Fei stopped. Seeing this, Pu Liao breathed a slight sigh of relief. Just as he was about to speak, a cold glint flashed in the dim room.

Pu Liao’s body stiffened abruptly, a streak of blood appearing on his forehead. His eyes fixed on Chen Fei; he had thought he had appeased Chen Fei and could escape this calamity.

“Here, evidence is not required.”

Watching Pu Liao breathe his last, Chen Fei’s figure flickered, and he left the room.

A moment later, Chen Fei returned to his rented courtyard.

Gazing at the bright moon in the sky, Chen Fei sighed softly. He only wanted to cultivate peacefully, but this world, it seemed, would not grant Chen Fei that opportunity.

The next afternoon, news of Pu Liao’s death spread throughout the North City Medical Hall.

After a brief tidy-up, Chen Fei arrived at the Zhang family residence.

A grand mansion with soaring walls, gilded roofs, and stone facades, the Zhang family’s estate appeared truly magnificent. This was Chen Fei’s first visit to the Zhang family. He entered through a small gate and followed a servant to a separate courtyard.

Chen Fei looked up, seeing Zhang Sinan currently conversing with Zeng Defang.

“Greetings, Young Miss, greetings, Elder Zeng!” Chen Fei stepped forward and cupped his hands in salute.

“Are you accustomed to your stay at the North City Medical Hall?”

Zhang Sinan turned to Chen Fei, scrutinizing him from head to toe. Compared to when they met during the disaster relief efforts, Chen Fei now appeared much sturdier, which made him more pleasant to look at.

Previously, his dark and scrawny appearance had been somewhat displeasing. If not for his exceptional alchemy skills, Chen Fei would never have caught Zhang Sinan’s eye.

“Thank you for your concern, Young Miss. Everything is well.”
