Chapter 104: The Secret of Biro, the Lady Captured?

The interior of the boat was lavishly decorated, crafted entirely from precious, smooth, and warm wood, resembling jade.

An incense burner stood in the center, its fragrant smoke curling upwards, making one feel as if they were in a fairyland. To the right was a jade bed, with pale purple gauze curtains hanging down, resembling a waterfall from the heavens.

On the western side of the bedroom was a large terrace with a view of the river scenery.

"Truly a life of luxury. To sleep in bed while enjoying the view of the great river is truly a beautiful thing," Li Xian murmured softly.

He lifted the pale purple gauze curtain and saw the Lady's figure, momentarily speechless. On the jade bed, the Lady sat in a cross-legged position, her posture graceful, her eyes slightly closed.

She looked like a fairy in quiet cultivation.

However, upon closer inspection, the ropes binding her were extremely conspicuous. They crisscrossed, biting into her flesh, with not a single redundant inch, tightly restricting every joint in her body.

Her ankles, knees, wrists, elbows...

It rendered the Lady completely immobile.

Dignity and eroticism appeared simultaneously.

The Lady suddenly opened her eyes, gazing at the great river. Seeing the beautiful scenery, a look of tranquility and contentment filled her eyes. But she seemed unable to break free, her beautiful face slightly flushed.

She did not appear to have been captured.

Li Xian snapped out of his initial confusion and suddenly understood. To comprehend the river by observing it, to comprehend water by observing it. The vast and mighty force of the Biro Palm, with its layered palm energy, originated from the winding river channel.

The water striking the riverbank is a magnificent sight.

The entanglement and binding of the Biro Palm were related to the Lady's state. Li Xian had originally thought that the Lady, looking at the river and thinking of its source, saw the surging waters and thought of the hundred rivers rushing to merge into the great river.

But now it seemed he was wrong.

"The Lady seems to be... practicing some kind of martial art?" Li Xian thought to himself. The feeling from just a moment ago, at such close distance, was quite strange; it felt as if the Lady had descended from her divine pedestal.

"Why think of such things? Concentrating on studying the martial art is the priority."

Li Xian dismissed his distracting thoughts.

He then began to practice his martial arts again. Having witnessed the initial scene of the martial path, practicing the art became much smoother. There were more places to contemplate.

After breaking through to Great Completion, his Qi Lake had gradually grown, now reaching a size of three zhang.

His Qi was abundant, his spirit vigorous, and a hundred diseases found it hard to invade him.

It was almost the end of February, the tail of winter, before it finally passed completely.

Time in the mountains was light. Only when the ice and snow had completely melted did one realize winter had already left.

Li Xian was happy to be undisturbed. His daily life was simple: practicing martial arts, hunting, and eating. Every ten days or half a month, he would go to Blackwater Port to sell his game, exchange it for money, and accumulate wealth.

During this time, he ate quite a few Crab Treasures.

But this item was extremely taxing on the cooking pot. After boiling fine food twice, the bottom of the pot would inevitably crack.

By a fluke, Li Xian had absorbed a wisp of the essence of heaven and earth. But luck does not come often, and the "Crab General" is not a common sight. After that time, the essence of heaven and earth dissipated as soon as it was consumed, not a trace remained.

Invisibly, he had also undergone "Body Cleansing."

He just didn't know how long this mud body needed to be cleansed before it would achieve perfection, manifesting the extraordinary scene of a "Food Essence" martial artist, and then grasp that elusive immortal opportunity in his palm?

That day.

Li Xian boiled Crab Essence late at night.

"These mountain crabs, although they can ensure I have a stable supply of essence of heaven and earth to consume, are too small in quantity. Boiling them ten times might not compare to a single mouthful of the Lady's fine soup."

"Moreover, each trip into the mountains to catch crabs takes at least two days, sometimes three or four. Add to that the time spent boiling the fine food, it's simply too time-consuming."

Li Xian added firewood.

The fire under the pot burned even hotter.

The water in the pot boiled, steam washing over his face. As it neared drying, Li Xian skillfully added cold water.

Despite the many inconveniences, Li Xian was quite satisfied with his current situation.

It's no wonder that martial artists in the world need someone to support them. Without support, how could the path of martial arts be comfortable?

"I wonder how my little brother is doing now."

Li Xian leaned against a tree trunk, gazing in the direction of the prefectural city.

Brothers separated, the feeling of longing is naturally deep. The moon is full now, so his brother must also be looking at the moon and thinking of his elder brother.

When the pot of fine soup was cooked, he pried open the crab shell.

He put the milky white crab roe into his mouth.

[You consumed inferior fine food, Proficiency +9]

That pitiful wisp of the essence of heaven and earth struggled with Li Xian for a long time before finally crossing the Qi Circulation Meridian, passing through the Solid Blood and Closed Pores...

The path of martial arts is long and endless.

All one can do is patiently cultivate one's martial arts and do every step well.

The next day.

Li Xian wore a long sword at his waist, dressed properly, and did a simple patrol of the fields.

After the great winter passed, the people of Blackwater Village were all busy.

Scattered figures could be seen working in the fields.

"Sir, it's all thanks to you."

"In our village, every year after winter, there's a fight. After all, some fields are adjacent, and no one is convinced by who takes more land and who takes less."

"Now everyone is united. Even if there are disputes, they are willing to listen to this old man's words."

Fu Bo followed behind Li Xian, speaking with a smile.

"That's good too." Li Xian nodded. Seeing the harmony in the fields and the vitality in the village, Li Xian suddenly thought: "In such a world, I don't have the ability to be a good man. I need to survive on my own first and gradually grow stronger. On this premise, I can help those I can help."

He didn't take Fu Bo's flattery to heart.

Along the way, the inspection was calm and uneventful. The Mountain Wind Stronghold had not come to raid again. That's just how the world is; when you are weak, even breathing is a crime.

But after Li Xian arrived, killed several leaders of the Mountain Wind Stronghold, and made them wary, things became peaceful instead.

Crossing the farmland, Li Xian patrolled to the stream, then climbed several mountains, casually inspecting the surroundings.

If he saw someone stealing firewood, he would shout to drive them away. Besides poor commoners, there were also some idlers among the wood thieves. They did nothing all day, stole wood to exchange for money, and then spent their time in gambling dens and teahouses.

When dealing with such people, Li Xian would be more ruthless. He would beat them away to prevent them from coming back again.

He patrolled to the riverbed overgrown with long grass.

Li Xian drew his waist sword and beat the tall grass on the riverbed. Lizards, venomous snakes, toads, centipedes... all scurried out.

"The last time I came here, this riverbed was warmer than other places."

"Since I'm patrolling here today, why not go down and explore?"

Curiosity stirred in Li Xian. He drew his sword and used his Qi to strike, cutting the waist-high grass in half before jumping down into the riverbed.

His boots got stuck in the mud.

It was quite muddy.

"For me, winter is actually better."

The riverbed was full of mosquitoes and insects. Li Xian had Solid Blood and Closed Pores, so he wasn't afraid of their harassment. But the buzzing was quite annoying.

It was the same on his recent trips into the mountains.

Leeches and venomous insects gradually appeared. If one didn't make preparations beforehand, spending a night in the forest would leave one drained dry.

[You cut through the grass, Proficiency +2]

[Great Luo Sword]

[Proficiency: 1546/5000 Great Completion]

He walked along the riverbed for over ten miles when he suddenly saw a black mud figure.

Li Xian had once bought a similar mud figure in the black market for one tael of money. Comparing them now, he found they were identical, and the material was extremely similar to the stone lions in front of the Blackwater Gang's gate.

"In this Blackwater River, there are stone lions, mud figures... I wonder what other treasures there are."

Li Xian swung his sword in a slash.

A venomous snake, lying in ambush and waiting to strike, was cut in two. Li Xian lifted the snake with his sword and threw it to the riverbank. He suddenly froze, noticing a bright red fruit hidden in the dense grass.

"It's said that mountain beasts like venomous snakes will autonomously search for mountain treasures. This fruit is protected by a venomous snake, it must be extraordinary!"

Li Xian picked the red fruit.

He took a careful sniff; the fruit's fragrance was rich. He split the fruit open, and the flesh inside was fibrous. It didn't seem to be poisonous, so he tasted it.

He did not expect a remarkable effect.

Li Xian felt a shock throughout his body, a faint crimson glow emanating from his pores.

The medicinal power of this fruit was strengthening his physique.

[You consumed a strange fruit, Proficiency +32]

"I don't know what this fruit is called, but it's very useful. I'll look for more." Li Xian's eyes lit up with excitement. There really were good things in the riverbed.

"I heard Commander Pang say that truly high-quality fine treasures are nurtured by heaven and earth. The fine food obtained from demons and monsters are all inferior items."

"If I'm lucky enough to find such a treasure..."

But as he walked over ten miles along the riverbed, he only found three red fruits. He ate them all, and his body became much stronger.

Li Xian truly did not know that he was being a wastrel.

This item was called the "River Perishing Fruit," growing on river veins that had suffered "sudden death." Heaven and earth, mountains and rivers, all have their own rhythms and energies. When a river vein dies suddenly, its energy and rhythm dissipate.

Under certain circumstances, through the mysterious workings of the heavens, the energy and rhythm are captured by growing plants, forming the "River Perishing Fruit." This fruit is a rare item, with an extremely low probability of appearing.

Besides the [Fine Treasures] for martial artists to shed their mortal bodies and be reborn, there are also [Strange Treasures] with various effects. Although this River Perishing Fruit does not contain [Essence of Heaven and Earth], it has its own remarkable medicinal efficacy.

It is the main ingredient for a certain prescription. If prepared correctly, a single dose of the medicine can be worth a thousand gold.

Its effects are to strengthen bones, toughen the body, and restore vitality. The crimson glow flows through the flesh and blood, the river's energy washes the body, and replenishes the deficiency of blood and vital energy.

For some martial artists whose blood and vital energy are deficient and whose Qi Circulation Meridian is too late, consuming this fruit can restore their body's vital energy and extend their martial lifespan.

However, Li Xian was young and vigorous, his blood and vital energy were almost overflowing. He did not enjoy the [Restoration] effect, only feeling his physique was slightly stronger.

At dusk, he returned to his wooden cabin.

Li Xian took off his sword, feeling relaxed, and began to practice his palm technique.

[Biro Palm]

[Proficiency: 1659/12000 Great Completion]

The Biro Palm was of a higher grade and required more proficiency. But it brought greater benefits. Li Xian's palm technique was now Great Completion, his sword technique Great Completion, his fist technique had reached its peak, and his leg technique was perfect...

His archery was also Great Completion!

Every martial art he practiced, he delved into deeply.

This level of martial arts attainment and accumulation was difficult to match even with decades of diligent effort by others.

He ate to become strong and sturdy, his overall strength had increased不知多少倍 compared to when he first arrived at Blackwater Village.

"It's almost the end of February. I've been at Blackwater Village for over two months now."

"I wonder... with my current strength, if I were to compete with Commander Pang, who would win?"

Pang Long had practiced martial arts for decades, dabbling in twenty or so martial arts: sword, spear, staff, fist, foot, palm... but none had reached perfection.

Only six had reached Great Completion, the rest were at Small Completion, Proficient, or Beginner levels.

Comparing the two... Li Xian had only practiced four: Square Fist, Biro Palm, Breeze Leg, and Great Luo Sword, from the peak of their respective levels down to Great Completion.

His foundation was naturally slightly weaker, and his internal Qi was not as strong.

But if he added his Great Completion "Archery" to circle around and fight. Using his strengths to avoid his weaknesses. He might already have the qualification to compete with Pang Long.

"Absolutely must not be arrogant!"

"My path is still long!"

Li Xian settled his mind.

[You diligently practiced palm technique, Proficiency +2]

He struck one palm after another.

His primary goal now was to perfect the [Biro Palm]. If he could do that, even if he encountered Zheng Xuezhang, he might have the power to hold his own!

As for the Great Luo Sword...

He could put it aside for now. Keeping a Great Completion sword technique for combat would make others underestimate him.
