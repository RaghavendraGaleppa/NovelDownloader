**Chapter 31: Piercing the Night Sky**

For a fleeting moment, Qin Ming felt as if someone had peered into the depths of his heart. The great fire from two years ago, which had consumed his entire village, seemed to burn from his memory into reality, bringing with it the scorching heat, the acrid smell of char, the broken walls, the scattered corpses, and the ethereal youth in feathered robes—all resurfaced.

But by the time he turned around, he had regained his composure, his mind peaceful.

Although the woman before him had witnessed his near-death state and dishevelment two years ago, she couldn't possibly know his true experiences. If they had more extensive interactions or a shared past, they wouldn't have met again only today, despite both being near Silver Vine Town.

Qin Ming showed a sincere expression and said, "Miss Xie, please tell me what happened. Who was taking care of me back then? As you can see, my head was severely injured, and I still don't remember anything from that period."

Xie Lingxi plunged her three-meter-long greatsword into the ground and glanced back at him. "At that time, a man and a woman were traveling with you. They looked to be in their early thirties. From what they said, you were on your last legs, and they had no choice but to leave you to your own devices."

Qin Ming pondered, muttering softly, "I was practically dying, yet they were still carrying me on a long journey. Why?"

Xie Lingxi's dark hair was seven feet long, her features strikingly sculpted, and her beautiful eyes sparkled like starlight. "I only overheard a few words from a distance. They wanted to take you to a remote area, completely away from the bustling cities. If you survived, it would be best for you to settle down here."

Just then, a slender maid came to serve tea. The two teacups on the tray were noticeably different in size. She spoke up, "My young miss once gave you a pill to replenish qi and blood. Although it wasn't particularly valuable, it was an act of kindness."

"Ah, thank you... Miss Xie." Qin Ming immediately bowed. The other party had shown kindness but hadn't mentioned it. Had it not been for this maid coming to the backyard, he wouldn't have known.

"You may go," Xie Lingxi waved her hand, not allowing the delicate and beautiful maid to say more.

Qin Ming cupped his hands and said, "May I ask Miss Xie to recall more carefully if there were any other details from that day? Please tell me if there were. I would be immensely grateful."

"At that time, you were ragged and covered in blood. It was clear that even when your clothes were new, they must have been very ordinary."

Qin Ming nodded. When he had his second rebirth, he had seen his younger self, dressed in patched-up clothes. It was not surprising that his youth hadn't been easy. He simply didn't understand why it had led to a murderous disaster, with his entire village consumed by fire.

After recalling, Xie Lingxi said, "The two people who brought you were mainly here to explore the spiritual mountains in this region, which were activated by the Heavenly Light. Since they discussed on the road that they hoped you could settle in a remote place, they probably just brought you along."

She informed him that they had only encountered the pair twice on the road. Her current insights were merely guesses based on the few hurried words exchanged by the pair while they were rushing.

Upon hearing this, Qin Ming couldn't help but lose himself in thought. What was the relationship between that man and woman and himself? They didn't seem particularly close, yet they had saved him.

At the same time, what was the significance of the spiritual mountains activated by the Heavenly Light? He truly wanted to ask, but felt he had already asked too much, which might be impolite.

...

"Hehehe." In the smaller living room in the front courtyard, the purple-eyed crow cackled, looking at the woman in the black fur cloak. "Those two young men mistook you for Miss Xie's daughter, caw-caw-caw..."

"Your laughter is truly grating!" The woman extended her long, slender fingers, glowing faintly, and pointed towards the crow. It immediately flew up, agilely dodging her.

The purple-eyed crow said, "I didn't expect to find two decent sprouts in such a remote area. I feel that if the other ill-tempered young man fully recovers his origin, he will also be quite remarkable."

The woman said, "That inarticulate young man already has a master. It's clear someone is using extraordinary means to help him regulate his body."

The crow said, "They all say that two years ago, when the Heavenly Light tore through the night sky, among the dozens of blessed areas, this place was the dimmest, receiving very little spiritual light. But it might not be so after all; to see two fairly promising youths consecutively in nearby villages."

The woman took a sip of tea. "My teacher's knowledge spans heaven and earth, so his premonition should be accurate. The Heavenly Light from two hundred years ago might never have erupted here, accumulating until now. With the fusion of two different colors of Heavenly Light, the special products born here will likely be astonishing!"

Then the woman pulled down her cloak's hood and stood up. "We should go. Senior Brother Xie will be very busy today. I didn't expect his daughter to act on her own initiative back then, taking the path of the Giant Spirit God without permission, which is now giving him a huge headache."

...

In the end, Qin Ming couldn't resist asking the noble lady before him for guidance.

She had no obligation to enlighten him. If she refused, he would simply leave shamelessly. As long as he wasn't embarrassed, it was fine.

Xie Lingxi said, "The sun set and never rose again. The moon and all the stars in the sky disappeared. The Heavenly Light is an unexpected light that pierces through the night sky. It appears irregularly, once every few decades to a hundred years, and is quite extraordinary, capable of giving birth to rare products near where it lands."

Qin Ming expressed his heartfelt gratitude. She hadn't put on airs and had directly informed him.

"Miss Xie is beautiful, and her heart is even kinder, unlike..." He began to speak, then realized that if Xie Lingxi were proportionally scaled down, her face would be palm-sized, with a golden ratio, curvaceous figure. It was only because she had taken the Giant Spirit God path that everything about her was now much larger than ordinary people.

"Unlike what?" Xie Lingxi asked.

"Unlike some people who, when inadvertently glanced at, stare back with two glares," Qin Ming said casually.

"You're not talking about my junior martial uncle in the front courtyard, are you?" Xie Lingxi showed a peculiar expression.

The woman who had just exited the old noble's mansion paused, while the purple-eyed crow flying low in the sky let out a cackle: "Caw-caw-caw..."

"That's so annoying!"

...

Qin Ming felt too embarrassed to stay for dinner at the old noble's mansion. He felt he had gained a lot today, and the information alone made his trip worthwhile.

As he neared Twin Tree Village, he was still recalling Xie Lingxi's words, pondering them for a long time along the way.

"I think, with my third rebirth, those lost memories will eventually be recovered," he murmured, his gaze firm.

Qin Ming realized that the old noble was quite extraordinary. Her daughter was very strong, nearing five meters tall despite her young age, indicating she had gone far on the Giant Spirit God path.

"Of the two people who took me on the road, the woman had a red mole in her right eyebrow, and the man had unusually long arms. I wonder if they will come to the mountains this time to harvest the products from special nodes," Qin Ming mused.

At the same time, he already knew that Falling Moon City was quite large and very far from here.

Soon, news came from Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing: they would enter the mountain in two days!
Now there was definite news: the higher-ups of Red Cloud City and the advanced creatures in the mountain had reached an agreement. The territory previously expanded by the otherworldly beings would be completely abandoned by them.

The places outside the mountain, where people used to hunt and gather herbs, could now be entered and exited freely.

However, if one wanted to delve deeper, into the dangerous zones of the mountain, that would depend on one's own capabilities.

Of course, the advanced creatures promised they would not secretly hunt, but there were still many other dangerous creatures in the mountain, so the people from outside the mountain should proceed with caution.

The higher-ups of Red Cloud City also made a commitment that they would not secretly attack either.

Evidently, even after both sides drove away the invading high-level creatures, the mountain would still not be peaceful. Even if the high-ranking officials would not engage in bloody hunting, there were still the old patriarchs of various families, and other terrifying otherworldly beings in the mountain, who would clash in the densest areas of the night mist.

Once one ventured deep, bloodshed and conflict were unavoidable, regardless of one's identity or background.

"I can guide the way, but only in the outer areas. I will not step into those unknown regions!" Qin Ming immediately informed Mu Qing and the others.

"Alas, we don't dare venture deep either. That's the territory of the old guys; they'll go berserk," Mu Qing, Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and the others lamented.

The main reason was that many people from other regions had also rushed over, making even the outer areas not so safe.

Because the news had spread, some special nodes had already given birth to rare products that could be harvested.

Over the next two days, Qin Ming observed the various actions of different factions.

Not to mention the powerful outsiders, even local organizations like the Three-Eyed Cult and Golden Rooster Ridge were actively preparing.

The Three-Eyed Cult was very mysterious; it was said to have members in distant cities, and the branch here was just an outpost.

Ordinarily, local members of the cult loved to use the influence of their high-level superiors to intimidate people. Before any conflict, they would always proactively tell others they were from the Three-Eyed Cult, with top experts overseeing them, so others should weigh their options.

But today they had changed their ways. Someone came to communicate with Xu Yueping, no longer so crude and direct.

"We are all local people. After making special discoveries, let's share information. Local rare products should naturally remain in our local area. Look, that mountain is right there, it will never move, accompanying you and me for life. Even in death, we shall sleep beside it. And the Three-Eyed Cult, rooted here, is as eternal as that mountain; it will long endure..."

Old Man Liu looked at the scar-faced man and couldn't listen anymore. He said, "Scarface Er, why don't you just be as straightforward as before? You should roll up your sleeves, stick your knife on the table, and put your foot on a stool to threaten us, telling us to inform you of any special nodes found in the mountain, otherwise, after the people from Red Cloud City leave, you, who will endure here just like the mountain, will retaliate against us. Isn't that what you mean?"

"Yes, that's actually what I wanted to say, but the higher-ups said not to be so crude this time. Just understand the meaning, and I'm off!" Scarface Er of the Three-Eyed Cult turned and left.

Soon after, people from Golden Rooster Ridge also arrived. They used to be great bandits, and although they had been officially recruited, they had always made the nearby villages and towns wary.

This was because the Golden Rooster Knights trained by Golden Rooster Ridge were fierce and very suitable for assassination in the mountains. The golden ground chickens corresponded to second-mutation creatures, and combined with their riders, they were extremely dangerous.

...

"We're about to enter the mountain soon..." You Liangyun sat in his quiet room. On the desk before him was a jade jar containing some spiritual substance. Consuming it would allow for a second rebirth. There were still two days until they entered the mountain, enough time for his life level to fully elevate.

Originally, he hadn't wanted to rush, as he still wished to further temper the foundation of his rebirth.

But now his expression shifted between coldness and hesitation. If he couldn't follow that woman to Flowing Light City, he was truly unwilling.

"You've investigated thoroughly, haven't you?" You Liangyun asked the person outside the quiet room.

"Yes, everything has been thoroughly investigated. After entering the mountain, it's best not to look for him for the first two days. He'll most likely be with Mu Qing and Cao Long. Once they familiarize themselves with the terrain, you can probably go find him."

"Good!"

Two days later, all the various forces began to enter the mountain.

To Qin Ming's speechlessness, Old Man Liu put on armor, carried a thick-backed broadsword, and rode on his yellow earth dog.

He wasn't the only one; Yang Yongqing carried twin blades, riding on the back of a black goat taller than an adult's shoulder, transforming into a Black Goat Knight.

"Into the mountain!" Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, Mu Qing, and the others led their teams. They were just a small part of Red Cloud City's young forces; there were larger contingents from major organizations and families.

"Attention! There are people here! Two-legged beasts are out and about!" Not long after entering the mountain, a language sparrow shouted from directly above Qin Ming and the others.

This was a type of bird that could speak human language, cunning and incredibly fast in flight. It was now relaying information to the creatures in the mountain.

The keywords were "people" and "two-legged beasts." The mutated otherworldly beings in the mountain understood these transliterated terms.

"Shoot it down!" Cao Long said.

"There's a big pile of two-legged beasts here, even bigger than a three-meter-tall bear!" Without a doubt, this language sparrow had mutated. It wasn't just sending messages to the otherworldly beings in the mountain; it was also sending information to other human teams, hoping to incite infighting among them.

Upon hearing this, Cao Long was furious and personally drew his bow and notched an arrow.

...

Boom!

Suddenly, five-colored mist soared into the sky from deep within the mountain, instantly shocking everyone. They had just entered the mountain, and the most mysterious product was already maturing and about to emerge?!

"My mountain god! The place where the five-colored mist illuminates has actually appeared directly! Rush!"
