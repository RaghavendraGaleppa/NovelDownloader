# Chapter 28: Meteorite Cataclysm Hammer

Little Li remained oblivious to being targeted.

Fourth floor of Divine Edge Cave.

The sharp, weaponized killing aura rippled, and fierce winds howled, making the cave echo with what sounded like ghostly wails. For anyone whose body hadn't undergone tempering, or who lacked special cultivation methods, the keen winds would instantly reduce their flesh to dust and bones to powder.

Yet, the young man's body stood unmoving. Through his already tattered clothes, a faint, precious luster could be seen shimmering on his skin.

“Hoo…”
“Haa…”

Li Mo, whose physical body was in the midst of a breakthrough, was at this moment no different from a blade undergoing relentless sharpening. Under the tempering of the keen aura, it gradually shed its rust, revealing its true edge…

Most disciples of the Azure Abyss Sect used Mortal Weapons. Only a select few inner disciples could possess a Keen Weapon. Some acquired them from the Divine Edge Cave, while others purchased them externally.

Now, Li Mo's physical body was approaching the level of a Keen Weapon.

Suddenly, the escaping aura became even more intense. The precious luster on Li Mo's body grew thicker and thicker, finally reaching its critical point. He abruptly opened his eyes, a sharp gleam flashing within them, and then softly exhaled.

*Pfft—*

The opposite cave wall actually crumbled, leaving a small pit. A mouthful of turbid qi, like a sharp arrow, shot forth. If it were to strike someone in the initial stages of the Qi-Blood Realm, it would likely leave them severely injured, if not dead.

Li Mo stood up, completely disregarding his tattered clothes. He clenched his fists, feeling the surging power within him. Picking up a piece of bluestone, he applied a little force. Silently, stone powder slipped from between his fingers.

"A body comparable to a Keen Weapon."

"Let alone ninth-grade exotic beasts, I doubt even an eighth-grade one could easily pierce my defenses."

Li Mo brushed the stone powder from his palm, examining his skin in the dim light. His satisfaction grew. *Hmm, my skin color hasn't changed, in fact, it seems whiter? It's as if I'd applied a skin-smoothing filter...*

"Thank you."

Li Mo bowed sincerely towards the six Profound Weapons, including the Chixiao Sword.

A soft hum resonated from the Profound Weapons, seemingly in response.

Following this, Li Mo walked to the very end of the fourth floor of the Divine Edge Cave. He held a luminous pearl in his left hand, and tapped the stone wall with his right index finger. The sound was clear and not dull.

"Hollow?" Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

With the luminous pearl's glow, he noticed that the color of this section of the stone wall differed subtly from the surrounding cave walls, as if it had been artificially constructed later. After a moment of thought, he decided.

*Bang—*

Li Mo's fist shot out like a dragon. The power of his eight Qi-Blood meridians exploded, combined with his keen weapon-like physique. The tremendous force caused the stone wall to collapse instantly.

"Sure enough, there's a path!" Li Mo's eyes lit up.

However, before he could celebrate, fierce winds roared, as if countless sharp arrows were blasting towards him. The surging, weaponized killing aura seemed to condense into a tangible presence!

Li Mo's eyes widened in alarm. He immediately activated the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body cultivation method with all his might. Struggling to keep his eyes open, he saw a narrow passage barely wide enough for one person. From the opposite end, intense red and blue lights faintly radiated.

Within a chamber the size of a basketball court were two pools. One resembled molten lava, the other, bone-chilling frost, both flowing outwards. At the convergence of these two pools, a dark, obsidian hammer stood silently inverted, diverting the converging ice and fire currents.

*Boom—*

Though it was only a single hammer that vibrated, the entire Divine Edge Peak seemed to tremble as if the earth itself were splitting apart. With just one glance, Li Mo felt his mind explode.

In a trance, he saw a burly, bearded giant wielding the hammer, striking a sword embryo on an anvil, sending sparks showering everywhere.

*Chixiao? Tianshuang? Were these two Profound Weapons forged by this very hammer?*

As this thought arose, the scene before his eyes shifted again. He saw the hammer, still held by the bearded giant, smash down on the head of a flood dragon as large as a small mountain. The creature's head directly exploded, leaving only its horn. He also saw the hammer, later in the hands of other powerful cultivators, crushing various formidable enemies. One strike even reduced an entire mountain range to dust.

*Rumble rumble—*

"Oh no, it really seems like an earthquake."

Li Mo only realized after he snapped out of his trance. That wasn't an illusion; the entire Divine Edge Peak was genuinely shaking! He quickly ran out. As he ran, an inexplicable voice echoed in his mind. It wasn't human speech, yet he understood its meaning:

"I await you."

*Was it... the hammer?*

***

Divine Edge Peak, Forging Courtyard.

*Hiss—*

A puff of white smoke rose. Han He shed his upper garment. Despite his aged face, the sinewy muscles of his torso were remarkably formidable. He took out the quenched weapon; it was a three-pronged halberd featuring a beast-mouth hilt devouring the blade, gleaming with cold light.

"Master, you've forged yet another renowned artifact." Murong Xiao said, easing his stance, his eyes filled with reverence. Recently, he had been practicing the Whirlwind Hammer under Han He's guidance.

"Alas, renowned artifacts." Elder Han He took a sip of tea, gently stroking the newly forged three-pronged halberd. "In the past, the peak masters of my Divine Edge Peak produced many true grandmasters, all capable of forging Profound Weapons."
