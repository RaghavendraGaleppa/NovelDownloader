# Chapter 427: Not Scalding, Not Hot, The God Within the Fire Veins (1/2)

Rolling, scorching firelight distorted the daylight.

Deep within the Forging Pavilion, the heat waves made every breath feel as though one's internal organs were being burned.

"Li Mo's talent in the Way of the Hammer is beyond doubt."

"Indeed."

Elder Cold Crane and Elder Zeng, two old men who usually bickered with one another, reached a rare, swift consensus on this matter.

Every inner disciple who ascended the Divine Weapon Peak had to undergo tempering in hammer techniques before entering the Forging Pavilion to learn the art of smithing.

The Little Overlord of the Divine Hammer skipped this step entirely.

"An outstanding craftsman usually has excellent hammer technique."

Elder Zeng stroked his beard and laughed. "But a good hammer technique doesn't necessarily make a great craftsman. One also needs extraordinary endurance."

The art of forging wasn't just about blacksmithing. There were many complex techniques involved in between, and one had to stay close to the fire veins, constantly enduring high temperatures.

"Li Mo, I heard you used to refine pills with Old Xue?"

Elder Cold Crane put down his hammer and asked curiously.

Every time he met Xue Jing, if the topic of Li Mo came up, within three sentences, he would inevitably hear that familiar line.

*'I was糊涂! Why didn't I have him learn pill refinement from me back then?'*

Elder Cold Crane agreed with that sentiment.

Whether he had talent in the Dao of Pills or not, it was still better than following that troublemaker, Shang Wu...

Li Mo thought for a moment and said, "To be precise, I was the one being refined."

Elder Cold Crane: "?"
Elder Zeng: "?"

Why did the words coming out of this小子's mouth always have a kind of beauty that was hard to understand?

"Follow me. Let's see how much high temperature you can endure."

Elder Cold Crane said, then opened the back door of the Forging Pavilion, revealing a downward tunnel.

"I'm coming too."

Elder Zeng followed as well.

Li Mo followed the two of them. As soon as they entered the tunnel, the scorching heat rushed at them; the air seemed to be burned and distorted, and the stone walls appeared a dark red color.

Was this the fire vein where the Hammer Treasure was once placed?

The further down they went, the higher the temperature.

The sound of forging metal also echoed in the tunnel, becoming sparser the further they went.

"The first step to becoming a craftsman is naturally learning to smelt iron. The higher the temperature, the better the quality of the material produced," Elder Cold Crane explained as he walked.

Elder Zeng also cautioned, "If you can't take it, say so. Don't force yourself. If your meridians or internal organs get burned, that's no small matter."

The two elders exchanged a glance.

They walked for a while longer.

*'Is Little Mo holding up okay?'*

Elder Cold Crane exhaled heavily, sweat stains faintly visible on his forehead.

*'He should be about at his limit.'*

*'The first time I came here, I only made it about a hundred zhang deep into the fire vein.'*

Elder Zeng thought to himself and looked back.

The two old men were thinking the same thing. They locked eyes, then turned around simultaneously.

Then they saw Li Mo strolling leisurely, looking around with a completely relaxed expression.

Seeing them stop, he asked curiously, "Why aren't you walking?"

"Hehe... I thought you couldn't take it anymore. Let's go," Elder Cold Crane said, forcing a smile.

"Kid, I'm curious. Exactly how far can you go?"

So Li Mo followed the two of them, continuing to descend into the earth vein.

Ten minutes later.

Li Mo was actually walking ahead of them.

Elder Cold Crane behind him was sweating profusely, his body trembling slightly.

Elder Zeng's eyes were vacant, as if he had aged several years. Taking advantage of Li Mo not looking, he pulled out a bottle of Cold Spring Pills.

"Old Zeng, give me one."

"This is a Cold Spring Pill! I only eat these when forging玄兵器! How can you be so shameless!"

"Hurry... give me one..."

The two old men were whispering and tussling quietly.

Li Mo sensed the movement and turned back, asking in confusion, "Elders, why are you walking so slowly? If it's too hot, you must tell me."

---

He was immune to both fire and water.

The two old men immediately grunted.

"Ha... haha, my cold legs are acting up, that's all."

"This little bit of temperature is nothing to a Grandmaster Forger like me. I just feel... excited."

"Alright."

Little Li Mo found it a bit strange but didn't think too much of it.

After all, when he took out the Hammer Treasure, he saw a forging platform deep within the fire vein. He assumed it was where Elder Cold Crane used.

Elders must have special ways to resist high temperatures...

Actually, that was used by the founder of the Divine Weapon Peak.

They walked for a moment longer, and the glow of fire could be seen ahead.

"Something's wrong, this kid... something's wrong..."

Elder Cold Crane's vision was going black, his voice hoarse like a rusty bellows.

"Cough, cough, cough! Water... water..."

Elder Zeng seemed to have shrunk, his whole body trembling.

But when Li Mo turned back in confusion, the two old men immediately straightened up, hands behind their backs, looking as calm and casual as if strolling in a garden.

"Elders, do you want some barbecue?"

Li Mo had taken the opportunity to use the fire from the earth vein to roast a lamb skewer.

"Heh... seems like it's about time for a meal..."

"Yeah, I love lamb skewers the most. It smells so good..."

Taking the lamb skewers and looking at the red chili powder on them, the two elders exchanged a glance and simultaneously swallowed their dry throats.

If they didn't eat it!

Wouldn't that make them look like they were bluffing, inferior to a junior?

How could they face others, claiming to be Grandmaster Forgers?

How could they show their faces at the Forging Conference?

The two men, who were stubbornly proud all their lives, gritted their teeth and ate the spicy lamb skewers.

"Cough, did I put too much chili... It is a bit hot here."

"His... not spicy."

"Hu... not hot."

"..."

Looking at the two elders, their faces were as red as copper ore, Little Li Mo finally realized something was off.

*Hmm...*

The two old men looked like two small biscuits now, as if they would shatter at a touch.

You guys are almost dehydrated! Even the three suns aren't doing three-body motion!

Just as he was thinking about whether to use his Destiny Divine Eye to take a look—

*Thump—*

Two muffled sounds. The two elders rolled their eyes and collapsed backward, unconscious.

"..."

不知过了多久.

Elder Cold Crane and Elder Zeng opened their eyes groggily, discovering that the deadly fire vein aura seemed to be gone.

But the firelight before their eyes clearly told them they were deep within the fire vein.

What happened?

*Ding—*

A thunderous sound exploded.

Cold Crane and Elder Zeng instinctively looked up toward the sound.

"Huh?"

"Ah?"

*Ding—*

Another violent clang, like a mountain collapsing or a thunderclap on a plain.

Intense sparks flew, reflecting in the elders' eyes, making their gazes flicker. The light also illuminated the figure of the boy holding the hammer.

In the raging fire, by the flowing magma, he was shirtless, breathing in the flames and the gale. He raised the scorching, crimson Divine Hammer, striking down firmly, again and again.

He looked like an ancient god of fire and forging, striking the first iron tool of humanity.

No, that was no god.

It was Li Mo.
