# Chapter 24: Dong Xuan'er: "Senior Sister Chen, the magic artifact Brother Lin gave smells so nice!"  

The Taiyue Flying Boat was a top-tier large-scale flying artifact of the Huangfeng Valley, renowned alongside the Tianyue Divine Boat of the Masked Moon Sect.  

Onboard were the ten victors of the Ascension Tournament, several dual-spirit-root cultivators who had stood out in the spiritual root assessment, as well as privileged individuals like Chen Qiaoqian and Dong Xuan'er. The vessel soared toward Huangfeng Valley.  

At the bow of the boat, Lin Yun looked at Han Li before him, his face feigning pleasant surprise while his heart remained utterly calm—he had anticipated this. "Brother Han, how did you end up joining Huangfeng Valley too?!"  

Han Li smiled and cupped his hands in greeting. "Brother Lin, I can't compare to your extraordinary talent that had all seven sects vying for you. I was just fortunate enough to obtain a Huangfeng Valley Ascension Token—a stroke of luck, really."  

As he spoke, Han Li's eyes brimmed with envy as he gazed at Lin Yun.  

During the Ascension Tournament at Tianwutai, the competition among the seven great sects to recruit Lin Yun—a supernaturally gifted talisman master—had reached a fever pitch!  

The offers they presented had left Han Li dumbfounded and green with envy!  

The Clear Void Sect offered pills, the Great Sword Sect presented top-tier flying sword artifacts, the Spirit Beast Mountain promised spirit beast cubs, and the Masked Moon Sect tempted with spirit stones and artifacts...  

But what truly sent shockwaves through Han Li's heart—and silenced the other six sects—was Huangfeng Valley's offer!  

It was staggering!  

A full thirty thousand spirit stones!  

Thirty thousand?!  

At that number, Han Li's teeth chattered in disbelief. He had never seen so many spirit stones in his life!  

What made him even more envious were the subsequent terms: an annual allowance of ten thousand spirit stones!  

Ten thousand spirit stones every year!  

Even if Lin Yun did nothing from then on, that income alone would be an astronomical sum!  

Just when Han Li thought his single Foundation Establishment Pill had made him rich—at least surpassing Brother Lin in this one regard—Huangfeng Valley went and gifted Lin Yun two whole bottles of Foundation Establishment Pills!  

Two bottles! That was ten pills in total!  

And then, as if that weren't enough, they even threw in a brand-new talisman treasure!  

Han Li glanced at the nearly depleted small sword talisman treasure in his pocket—usable perhaps one last time—and shed tears of envy.  

Why is it that we're both human, yet you're so exceptional, Brother Lin?!  

The representatives of the other six sects were equally stunned by Huangfeng Valley's offer. They thought the valley had lost its mind!  

Even if Lin Yun truly was a prodigious talisman master, an untapped genius was worthless. Moreover, the price was exorbitant—even a mid-to-low-tier talisman master wouldn't command such terms. It could only mean Huangfeng Valley—or perhaps the Chen Family—had exceedingly high expectations for Lin Yun.  

---  

"You rascal! I knew you weren't simple! To think you were hiding something as precious as an Ascension Token!" Lin Yun laughed, clapping Han Li on the shoulder.  

"Little Li! From now on, we'll both be cultivating in Huangfeng Valley. As brothers, we must look out for each other."  

"Huangfeng Valley isn't as peaceful as we might imagine. Both of us came from humble beginnings as rogue cultivators and now, by chance, find ourselves in the same sect. With no kin or allies here, we must stand together. United, we can overcome any challenge!"  

Hearing Lin Yun's earnest words, a bitter, self-deprecating smile flickered across Han Li's face.  

"Brother Lin, you're already a celebrated genius, while I'm just an ordinary rogue cultivator with no talent to speak of. How could I possibly be of any help to you?"  

Then, half-jokingly, he added, "Brother Lin, once we enter Huangfeng Valley, I'll be relying entirely on you."  

To Han Li's surprise, Lin Yun nodded seriously. "Don't worry, I've got your back. If anything happens, come find me!"  

Seeing the sincerity in Lin Yun's expression, warmth flowed through Han Li's heart. Though the two might one day part ways due to conflicting interests, at this moment, they were the closest of brothers.  

"Brother Lin, and you say you don't love me?!"  

"Even if you care for me and look after me like this, you still won't win over this Han's heart!"  

The other passengers on the Taiyue Flying Boat stared enviously at Han Li, their gazes so intense they might as well have bored holes through him.  

"Brother Lin, we'd be willing! We'd do anything! Why won't you spare us a glance?!"  

---  

At the highest point of the flying boat, Li Huayuan observed Lin Yun below, musing to himself, "Senior Brother Chen was willing to pay such a steep price to bring Lin Yun to Huangfeng Valley... It seems he intends to pull him into the Chen Family and marry Qiaoqian to him."  

"I wonder if the Chen Family's investment will pay off this time."  

"If it turns out like the Nie Family's support for Junior Brother Lei, they'll have made a killing."  

Meanwhile, by the railing on the lower deck, two stunning beauties stood side by side. One wore pink robes, her every smile and gesture exuding charm and allure.  

The other was elegantly understated, her cool beauty radiating an air of aloofness that kept others at bay. Yet, far from diminishing her appeal, her icy demeanor only enhanced her mystique.  

Though their presence drew the gazes of many fellow disciples, the two women only had eyes for Lin Yun at the bow of the boat.  

---  

These two were none other than Dong Xuan'er and Chen Qiaoqian.  

Dong Xuan'er leaned her soft, delicate frame against Chen Qiaoqian, a pink jade fan in hand, which she waved playfully before the other's face. "Senior Sister Chen, what do you think of my new magic artifact?"  

"It's a top-tier, supreme-grade artifact—the very pinnacle of its kind!"  

"Extremely rare! My Huachun Fan is on par with the legendary Wind and Thunder Fan!"  

"But compared to that one, the Huachun Fan suits Xuan'er much better."  

"Senior Sister Chen, do you want to know who gave this to me?" Dong Xuan'er whispered into Chen Qiaoqian's ear, her breath teasing, deliberately provoking her.  

Chen Qiaoqian longed to kick this infuriating woman away, but Dong Xuan'er's background was far more formidable than hers.  

Helpless, she could only endure the other's gloating.  

However, when Dong Xuan'er produced the Huachun Fan, Chen Qiaoqian was genuinely surprised. As Dong Xuan'er had claimed, it was indeed a supreme-grade artifact, comparable to the Darkwater Sword Lin Yun had gifted her.  

Then, when Dong Xuan'er coyly asked who had given it to her, Chen Qiaoqian's eyes flickered.  

Who else would Dong Xuan'er flaunt before her if not Lin Yun?  

"Senior Sister Chen! Let me tell you a secret—Brother Lin gave me this fan! He's so thoughtful, picking a gift that fits Xuan'er's tastes perfectly."  

"Do you think... Brother Lin might have feelings for me?"  

Dong Xuan'er feigned shock, covering her mouth with a bashful expression. "Senior Sister Chen, should Xuan'er play hard to get before accepting Brother Lin? Or should I just say yes right away?"  

"Even though Brother Lin has a five-element spirit root, he's a talisman genius. More importantly, he's so dashing—practically the most handsome man in Huangfeng Valley!"  

"Senior Sister Chen, I'm so conflicted!"  

"Senior Sister Chen, you're older and more experienced than me. Could you give me some advice?" Dong Xuan'er added with a mocking lilt.  

"You—!" Chen Qiaoqian trembled with rage, like a flower in the wind. She yearned to skewer Dong Xuan'er with her Darkwater Sword until nothing remained!  

"Older"? Was she calling her old?!  

And what did she mean by "more experienced"?!
