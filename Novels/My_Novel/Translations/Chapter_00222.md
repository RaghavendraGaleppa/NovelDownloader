Chapter 222: A Beautiful Wife as a Teacher Is Heartbreaking

Hearing the news, Li Xian felt a sense of foreboding. He knew his mistress had enemies everywhere, but he thought the Jianghu was vast and the land immense. How could they possibly run into anyone so easily?

Little did he know that the moment they checked into the inn, their tracks were exposed.

In reality, this area was already close to the ten-thousand-mile mark near the Benhua River. The Dragon-Jiao had exhausted its strength and barely managed to deliver them here. Wasn't this just walking right into a trap?

Wen Caishang, confident in her formidable strength, had always possessed an air of "whoever blocks the gods shall be slain by the gods, whoever blocks the Buddhas shall be slain by the Buddhas." She originally paid no mind to these "rabble." However, a string of bad luck had changed the situation.

One link after another, all seemingly guided by fate.

Had Wen Caishang not schemed to steal the Earth's Essence, the Dragon-Jiao could have ridden the wind and waves, delivering them all the way back to the Yihé Manor in one breath. All obstacles would have been avoided.

Li Xian frowned and secretly followed. He smeared his face with wall ash to darken it. After walking a few miles, he saw Jianghu experts holding swords, sabers, and iron nets, converging in front of an inn.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Wow, there are really a lot of them!" He used objects to hide himself and observed secretly.

More than thirty people surrounded the inn, looking fierce. The leader was an elder of the Sword Rain Pavilion named "Xi Danjian."

It just so happened that the five factions—the Yellow Sand Sect, Sword Rain Pavilion, Taixin Sect, Shiluo Village, and the Wují Saber Gate—had formed an "Alliance to Hunt the Sword" to surround and kill Wen Caishang.

They had long been guarding the ten-thousand-mile mark. They laid out plans along the way, but came up empty, ruining their mood. The factions were unwilling to give up and continued to search.

Xi Danjian, an elder of the Sword Rain Pavilion, brought ten direct disciples and inquired for clues along the way. That noon, they rushed to this town.

He saw that the accompanying disciples were all feeling fatigued. If they were to encounter the witch, they would need to focus their minds and set up a formation to deal with her. Physical strength and mental energy were extremely important. So, he looked for an inn to rent rooms, allowing the disciples to settle down and rest.

Xi Danjian was paying silver at the counter when he suddenly heard the waiter and the innkeeper chatting about a pair of extremely handsome man and woman who had arrived today.

Xi Danjian casually asked, "Oh? How handsome could they be?"

"Sir, they are incredibly handsome. The man is like this, and the woman is like that. They are a perfect match, but..." The waiter stopped talking.

Xi Danjian sensed something was wrong and asked, "I'm curious, please tell me."

The waiter smiled and said, "Master, it's not quite appropriate to discuss guests in private. If the guests blame me, I won't be able to take the responsibility."

Xi Danjian understood. He took a piece of silver from his sleeve pocket and said, "How about now?"

The waiter's eyes lit up. He looked around, put the silver away, and whispered into Xi Danjian's ear, "Well... that pair of man and woman, although their looks are beautiful. It seems the woman is more powerful, always ordering the man around."

Xi Danjian grabbed the waiter's shoulder firmly and said gravely, "What clothes were they wearing, what did they look like? Describe it in detail."

The waiter cried out in pain but couldn't break free. With tears in his eyes, he described, "The woman... white dress, very long hair, a melon-seed face, fair skin. Three silver hairpins in her hair, looking very noble. The man is very young, tall, with a red mole between his eyebrows..."

Hearing this, Xi Danjian let go and pushed him. The waiter's eyes rolled back, and he fainted.

Xi Danjian took a deep breath. He knew he had found the target, but he was afraid of Wen Caishang's reputation and didn't dare to act rashly. He immediately sent disciples into the city to gather the "Alliance to Hunt the Sword" allies.

Thus, the scene unfolded.

Xi Danjian stepped out of the inn and said loudly, "Guests inside, if you don't want to die, get out here quickly!"

His voice was like thunder. The inn was three stories high, with eighteen rooms on each floor. Windows were pushed open one after another. Seeing the Jianghu experts surrounding the place, the guests, fearing they would be involved, packed their bags and belongings and fled the inn.

Xi Danjian saw that everything was ready, waiting only for the east wind. He thought to himself, "Rumors say that witch's sword art is extremely powerful. Hmph, if she encounters my Sword Rain Flying Flower Formation, I wonder if she can still be so arrogant. Once I take her head, I can rise another level."

Xi Danjian said, "Witch Wen Caishang, you have committed countless crimes, your sins are unforgivable. Why don't you die quickly!"

The disciples of the Sword Rain Pavilion all drew their swords, emitting sharp sounds. Wen Caishang was resting quietly in her room. She frowned and walked down the stairs slowly.

Xi Danjian was stunned. Upon seeing Wen Caishang, his heart trembled slightly. He thought to himself that the rumors of the Jianghu were indeed not false. The beauty of the "Madam of the Broken Sword" could make one break their sword for her.

However, her methods were terrifying. Xi Danjian said, "Good, good, I really met you here."

He didn't dare to say more and waved his hand, shouting, "Form the formation!"

Immediately, dozens of people gathered together to attack Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang was severely injured, her Qi circulation was sluggish, and her face was pale. Under the encirclement of the crowd, she kept retreating, completely lacking her former heroic demeanor, inevitably looking somewhat sorrowful.

Li Xian watched from the side, his mind complex. "Since I entered the mistress's service, although I have benefited from her, I have always wanted to break away from her and get rid of her constraints. At this moment, if the mistress were truly in danger, it would be the perfect opportunity. The sky is high and the earth is vast; I could just run away. But... how could I, Li Xian, be the kind of person to take advantage of someone's peril? Even if I were to leave in the future, I would have to do it openly and honestly with the mistress!"

His heart settled. The Sinking River Sword was unsheathed, and he charged into the formation. With two kicks, he sent the experts of the Yellow Sand Sect and Taixin Sect flying, shouting, "Mistress, I'm here to help you!"

Xi Danjian saw that the sword formation had already trapped Wen Caishang and was feeling excited. Suddenly, he saw Li Xian breaking into the formation. He laughed and said, "So there really is a pretty boy. Good, since that's the case, I'll kill you first!"

He snatched a long sword from a disciple beside him and flew to kill him without hesitation. The sword art he used was "Flying Star Scattered Sword," the sword out like a meteor.

Li Xian's heart tightened. In his entire life, he had suddenly encountered such a strong opponent. He forced himself to stay calm and didn't dare to hold back, using the "Sunset Behind the Mountains" move from the Setting Sun Waning Blood Sword.

This move was a defensive sword technique. "The sun hides behind the mountains at dusk, protecting the body all around." The moment the two swords clashed, both were taken aback.

Xi Danjian was shocked to feel that his opponent's sword art was powerful and profound. He was both jealous and envious. He thought that Li Xian, at such a young age, could have such attainments; it must be because Wen Caishang had taught him everything. A beautiful wife as a teacher, how pleasant it must be. His killing intent grew even stronger.

Li Xian, on the other hand, had his first encounter with a fight between two-realm martial artists. Purely in terms of sword art attainments, Xi Danjian's Flying Star Scattered Sword was inferior to Li Xian's Setting Sun Waning Blood Sword.

Purely in terms of sword art quality... Flying Star Scattered Sword was a mid-grade martial art. Setting Sun Waning Blood Sword was a high-grade martial art, but it was incomplete. The difference was negligible.

However, the moment they exchanged blows, he immediately felt his sword art was being suppressed. It wasn't a suppression of "Qi" or "strength," but rather that a set of martial arts felt like a kind of worldly comprehension or worldly wonder.

Those with higher realms, having trained their bodies to resemble the world, could even evolve this kind of comprehension within their own world.

Li Xian felt a sense of danger, but he also felt that although there was suppression, it wasn't fatal. He swept his Vast Misty Leg through, smoke and mist swirling, blocking the view.

Xi Danjian sneered, "Tricks!" He swung his sword horizontally. The moment the sword was drawn, the world suddenly darkened. The arc of the sword was like a meteor striking.

It was breathtakingly fast and fierce. Li Xian's eyes were sharp. He guessed that this sword strike was like a meteor. If he were to meet it with his sword, it would be like trying to catch a star with his bare hands, seeking his own death.

In an instant, he abandoned the sword and drew the saber. The Daluo Saber Art, supplemented by the Four Directions Fist Intent, wove a net of blades, attacking densely. Xi Danjian said, "How decisive!"

He drew his sword back to protect himself and used the "Sword Falling on an Isolated Mountain" move. This Flying Star Scattered Sword was indeed a mid-grade martial art. It was both fast and fierce, with its killing intent all hidden in the unseen areas.

Li Xian used the saber to execute a sword move, drawing out the Yang Extreme Sword Radiant. A red glow tightly protected his body. Xi Danjian retreated several steps in shock, pulling his body away, utterly speechless with astonishment: "This kid is a monster! At such a young age, he has perfected a high-grade sword art!"

After several exchanges, he still couldn't take him down. Xi Danjian roared, "Brat, die!" He was now using his true strength and wanted to kill again.

Suddenly, his pupils shrank. He saw a soft sword extending towards him, like a snake emerging from its hole, slashing at his neck. Xi Danjian's anger instantly dissipated, replaced by terror. He leaned back to avoid it.

Although the soft sword was flexible, it was extremely sharp. With just a light graze, a plow mark appeared on the ground. Xi Danjian swung his sword to block, but saw that the soft sword had a spirit of its own and wouldn't clash with his sword.

It relied entirely on its softness, flexibility, and extendable characteristics to attack. In an instant, three places—his abdomen, arm, and thigh—were scraped, leaving sword marks and blood flowing continuously.

Xi Danjian roared, "Where are the others? Where are they!" Cold sweat poured out as he looked to the sides. Suddenly, he felt a sense of darkness. He saw his direct disciples, and the thirty-plus people from the Yellow Sand Sect and Taixin Sect, all dead from sword wounds.

Xi Danjian said in horror, "How is this possible? Weren't you trapped in the sword formation?"

Wen Caishang said calmly, "With scum like you, how could you possibly trap me?"

Li Xian understood, but his feelings were complex. He thought, "The mistress was just testing me. She pretended to be defeated to see my reaction. Mistress, oh mistress, even if I want to treat you with sincerity, it's difficult."

Li Xian's nature was unrestrained, yearning for a free world. Although he had schemed with Wen Caishang, it was to protect himself. His temperament was different from Wen Caishang's, but after a long time together, it wasn't impossible for there to be feelings.

Leaving Wen Caishang wasn't necessarily a betrayal. Li Xian had his own thoughts and was not blindly loyal. But at this moment, he could be considered loyal.

Wen Caishang's constant testing was understandable. But it inevitably created a barrier. Li Xian had shown himself just now, already risking his life. Seeing that the mistress was testing him again, he couldn't help but feel a chill in his heart.

He quickly adjusted his mindset: "Forget it, forget it. How could I really expect the mistress to favor a boy like me? I am just a tiny speck of dust, my life as fragile as an ant. The mistress might have a use for me now, but if I were to die, she probably wouldn't shed a tear for me."

"If I owe her a debt, I'll just repay it. Be open and aboveboard. A man in this world should be responsible for himself."

His heart was clear, and his distracting thoughts vanished.

Wen Caishang raised her willow eyebrows. She flicked the tip of her sword, and the White Snake Soft Sword flashed repeatedly, its speed so fast it was hard to see with the naked eye.

The sword's edge flashed densely, turning into a cage that trapped Xi Danjian. With the slightest movement, his skin would break and blood would flow. Wen Caishang asked, "You set an ambush to kill me. How do you want to die?"

Xi Danjian threw down his sword. He knew he was no match and had no hope of survival. He said, "Madam of the Broken Sword, you are truly厉害! To kill or to slice, it's your call."

Wen Caishang said, "Good! Then I'll slice you first, then kill you!" Her wrist shook, and a flash of sword light went by. A piece of fine flesh on Xi Danjian's arm was shaved off.

Wen Caishang thought: "My injuries have not healed, and I was surrounded. I need to be ruthless in my attacks, so they won't dare to chase me again!" Her wrist shook again.

Xi Danjian's screams of agony followed. The flesh on his arms was shaved off in thin strips. This pain was worse than being sliced to pieces!

Wen Caishang's swordsmanship was shocking and terrifying. Xi Danjian's cheeks, arms, thighs... the flesh all over his body was shaved off bit by bit. In a short while, he was turned into a skeleton.

Li Xian was terrified. He had always heard of Wen Caishang's ruthlessness. Seeing her break people's hands and feet was already cruel. Today she was even more ruthless, actually skinning him alive!

Xi Danjian was still alive, cursing, "You vile woman... you won't... die a good death!" His breath faded, and he died completely.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Xiao Xian, you did well!"
