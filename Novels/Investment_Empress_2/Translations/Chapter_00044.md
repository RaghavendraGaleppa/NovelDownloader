# Chapter 44: The Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body, Transcending the Realm! Gaining the Divine Weapon!

The dark, unadorned hammer hung silently upside down at the boundary between ice and fire.

It was about three hundred paces from the cave entrance.

“Haa...”

Li Mo exhaled a mouthful of white mist, his forehead covered in sweat.

He had walked a hundred paces and was already drenched in sweat, his very bones itching from the vibrations.

It was exhausting, but the light in Li Mo’s eyes burned even brighter.

The Divine Weapon was tempering his bones. With every step, he could feel his Qi and blood growing stronger, his physique being honed into something more formidable.

In just a hundred paces, he had actually opened another meridian.

Thirteen meridians.

For a normal martial artist, twelve meridians are the limit. At that point, they would begin to condense blood into Qi and transform勁 (Jin) into息 (Xi).

Li Mo had completely transcended the realm of Qi and Blood.

Furthermore...

He had not yet stopped moving forward.

One hundred and forty paces.

“The pressure is getting stronger.”

Li Mo found it increasingly difficult to advance; his physical body had reached its limit.

Fine bloodstains began to appear on his skin.

He had already used the technique of the Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body to minimize the damage caused by the weapon’s killing intent.

But a Divine Weapon is a Divine Weapon.

“Luckily, I still have some Martial Dao Insights to spare.”

“Otherwise, I would have to stop here today...”

Li Mo wanted to try again.

He took another step forward, and the oppressive force of the weapon’s killing intent instantly crashed down from all sides.

The bloodstains immediately began to bleed, and his physical body showed signs of collapsing. He quickly retreated.

“Fine, I won’t struggle anymore.”

Young Master Li understood its power and sighed.

He didn’t want to use the system either.

It was just that reality didn't allow him not to.

Hard work alone couldn't secure a Divine Weapon.

“Give me twenty years.”

Li Mo’s mind moved, choosing to gain insight into the Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body.

**[Ten years of Martial Dao Insights successfully injected.]**

**[Year 1: You observe the Divine Weapon ‘Panjie Meteor Hammer’ and gain a deeper understanding of the Body Tempering path. You begin to contemplate the essence of the Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body.]**

**[Year 8: You finally comprehend the Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body to perfection.]**

**[Year 10: You begin to explore the mysteries of body tempering and attempt to reach the Transcending Realm...]**

With ten years of insights, the understanding of the Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body reached perfection. No, to be accurate, it only took eight years.

Young Master Li covered his face, once again accepting reality.

For superior sword techniques, Bing Tuozi taught him personally.

For peerless body tempering methods, he had to practice himself.

Yet the former cost several times more insights than the latter.

“Whatever.”

Li Mo activated the perfected Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body.

Instantly, the wild, killing intent of the weapon radiating from all sides became much gentler.

He walked more firmly toward the Panjie Meteor Hammer.

One step, two steps...

Ten steps, a hundred steps...

In the blink of an eye, he was only about fifty paces away from the boundary of ice and fire.

Just as Li Mo stepped within fifty paces...

*Boom—*

A sound like thunder erupted from the hammer.

The weapon’s killing intent surged violently once again.

He felt as if he had walked into a water vortex, enduring countless impacts every moment.

“No wonder the Panjie Meteor Hammer can forge Mystic Weapons.”

“If this hammer falls, even a famous weapon probably couldn't withstand it.”

Li Mo felt as if he were a weapon himself, being baptized by this Divine Weapon hammer.

The founder of the Divine Weapon Peak must have been a powerhouse.

At the very least, his attainments in body tempering were unmatched.

No wonder Elder Han He just let this hammer lie at the bottom of the Divine Blade Cave.

He probably wanted to use it but lacked the ability...

“Even a Divine Realm expert might not have the qualification to stand before this hammer.”

“What kind of强者 could wield it as easily as their own arm?”

Li Mo stopped thinking.

*Grandpa, I’m using the system first.*

Martial Dao Insights poured into the perfected Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body.

**[Year 1: You observe the Divine Weapon and gradually understand the true meaning of transforming the body into a weapon. You begin to emit weapon-killing intent.]**

**[Year 3: Your own weapon-killing intent can now resonate with the Divine Weapon’s killing intent, complementing each other.]**

**[Year 12: You have finally reached the perfection of perfection. Your understanding of this technique is no less than its creator.]**

**[Insight complete. Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body reaches the Transcending Realm!]**

---

Total of twenty years.

From Great Completion to the Transcending Realm.

Li Mo raised his eyebrows, slightly surprised.

What surprised him was that reaching the Transcending Realm took so few insights.

Having been打击 by the sword techniques for so long, he was a bit unaccustomed to it.

“Transform the body into a weapon.”

Li Mo whispered to himself.

The next moment, his body began to emit the weapon-killing intent used to temper his physique.

It wasn't strong, just slightly sharper than a sharp weapon.

Compared to the Panjie Meteor Hammer, it was like a firefly compared to the bright moon.

But!

The Ultimate Weapon’s Corpse-Smiting Body was a peerless technique, and he had already comprehended it to the Transcending Realm.

This meant that a small force could move a great weight!

The oppressive sensation instantly weakened greatly. Li Mo could even control it at will, choosing how much pressure to endure!

The remaining fifty paces, Li Mo walked as if flying.

In the blink of an eye, he stood at the boundary between ice and fire.

Only then did he have the time to examine this Divine Weapon closely.

This hammer seemed to have the hammerhead and handle fused into one, as if formed by nature.

The hammerhead was square in front and sharp in the back.

The square part was like a great seal, great ingenuity without artifice.

The sharp part was like a startling wind or a strange rock, crafted by ghosts and gods.

One side of the hammer strikes weapons, the other strikes people...

Li Mo suppressed this dangerous thought.

“I don’t know why you called to me.”

“But since you chose me, I shall take you away today!”

He reached out and gently grasped the handle.

*Boom—*

It was like the chaos splitting open at the beginning of the universe, or a comet hitting the ground. The noise was deafening.

Li Mo’s consciousness went blank, and his hand almost went limp from the shock.

*He couldn't let go!*

He gritted his teeth.

The thirteen opened main meridians were fully activated at this moment.

Every ounce of strength in his physical body was squeezed out.

The Panjie Meteor Hammer was surprisingly cooperative with Young Master Li.

It was actually moved, just a tiny bit, by a Qi and Blood Realm cultivator.

*Rumble...*

Instantly, the earth shook and mountains swayed.

The entire Divine Blade Cave trembled violently.

...

It wasn't just the Divine Blade Cave that was trembling.

The Divine Weapon Peak was as well.

“Earthquake! Earthquake!”

“Is the Divine Weapon Peak going to collapse?!”

“Don’t talk nonsense. It must be the Earth Vein erupting early.”

“Usually, there are a few days of quiet period. Today is only the first day!”

“Run!”

Those still inside the cave sprinted out frantically, not daring to look back.

Fortunately, most people had already selected their weapons.

“Teacher, what is happening?”

Xiao Qin had already gone out, but he hadn't seen Li Mo come out for a long time.

The voice of the Thousand Forms Martial尊 also pondered:

“This cave shouldn't collapse.”

“But that is... the aura of a Divine Weapon?”

Xiao Qin didn't quite understand what that meant.

But hearing the gravity in his teacher's tone, he couldn't help but worry.

“Master! Junior Brother Li is still inside.”

Mu Rongxiao couldn't sit still, but the entire Divine Blade Cave was now filled with a formidable pressure.

“It really is him...”

Elder Han He’s expression changed.

He had suspected it earlier.

When the Founder's artifact moved last time, he vaguely guessed it had something to do with Li Mo.

But he didn't expect the fluctuation of the Panjie Meteor Hammer to be so intense!

A nearly absurd thought popped up.

Could it be... that it is acknowledging a master?

“Oi, old man.”

“What you said earlier counts, right?”

Shang Wu crossed her arms, her almond eyes narrowing like a cat that had successfully stolen fish.

“If he can really lift it, letting him take it away is fine!”

Elder Han He’s eyelid twitched, and he swept his sleeve, stepping into the Divine Blade Cave.
