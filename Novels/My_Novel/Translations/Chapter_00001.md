# Chapter 1: Tattered Clothes, Shared with a Brother

The late autumn season brought continuous rains, and the temperature grew freezing.

Before a dilapidated thatched cottage, dawn had yet to break. Li Xian was already throwing punches. He was stripped to the waist, his skin reddened by the cold, steam rising from his entire body.

Punch after punch, he struck out as if he could disperse the chill in the air, preventing himself from feeling the cold.

Below, he wore a pair of coarse cloth pants, patched all over, slightly loose. The hems were splattered with mud that had dried into grime.

"Brother, why don't you put your clothes on? I'm inside the house, so I'm not cold. You mustn't freeze yourself sick."

Inside the thatched hut, a shabby wooden window was pushed open, revealing a delicate, youthful face.

He was Li Xiaofan, Li Xian's younger brother. He was wrapped in a long, patched jacket, his body huddled up.

"I'm not cold. Look, steam is rising from my whole body. We only have one upper garment between us brothers. You have a weaker constitution, so you keep it."

"Besides, I'm practicing martial arts. If I ruin the clothes, we'll have nothing to wear."

Li Xian smiled to comfort him, but a wave of bitterness rose in his heart.

He knew the ancient world was poor, but he didn't know it was this poor—he couldn't even afford clothes!

Half a month ago, he had transmigrated to this world, merging with the original "Li Xian," their memories overlapping.

This was the Great Wu Dynasty, the Southern Heaven Region, Poor Heaven Prefecture, Qingning County.

The original owner's mother had died early. His father was a hunter who had his right arm bitten off by a bear, after which he fell into a deep depression. Later, he got addicted to gambling, lost all the family fortune, and committed suicide.

In the end, all he left the two brothers was a dilapidated thatched cottage... and a single piece of clothing stripped from his body!

Winter was approaching, the weather freezing... The two brothers had no idea how they would survive.

"Brother, I'm not going to study for the exams anymore. The Lin Mansion is recruiting servants. I... I want to sell myself."

An unusual maturity showed on Li Xiaofan's young face.

"Not going to study?" Li Xian frowned. "With your talent, you'd just waste it?"

"Brother!" Li Xiaofan lowered his head, his voice mournful. "After Father died, they took everything. We can't hunt, we can't farm. We can't survive."

"The Lin Mansion is recruiting servants. I'm good at arithmetic; I can surely get a decent job. Once I please the steward, I might get some silver coins. Then we won't just have clothes to wear, we might... even get to eat meat!"

As he said this, Li Xiaofan forced a faint smile.

"Stop talking." Li Xian didn't look back, throwing punch after punch, a flash of irritation in his heart. "If anyone is going to support us, it's your older brother. It's not your turn to support me."

"But..."

"No buts."

Blood is thicker than water. The original owner's memories were intertwined with his own, inseparable, and this bond of kinship naturally continued.

Li Xian was Li Xiaofan's brother, a true brother by blood.

The martial art Li Xian practiced was called "Raging Bull Fist." It was a damaged manual with only three moves.

Every time he practiced, a stream of heat would flow through his body, strengthening his flesh and blood. It was the only thing left by his gambling father that could be considered a possession.

"Little Fan is right."

"If I could go up the mountain to hunt, why would my brother and I be facing the dilemma of freezing and starving to death? This world... hard work doesn't bring wealth!"

"To survive, I must make a sacrifice. Little Fan is young, and the exams are approaching. He absolutely cannot give up now!"

"Only if Little Fan passes the exams can we truly rise above others!"

Within a radius of dozens of miles around Qingning County, every blade of grass, tree, mountain, and stone already had an owner.

Li Xian's father was originally a hunter for the Luo family. By hunting on the mountain, he could get a tiny share of the profit.

Occasionally, he could cut some meat from the prey to taste. Unfortunately, before his death, Li's father had accumulated a huge gambling debt, and the Luo family hired other hunters.

A father's debt is paid by his sons... The Li brothers still owed an astronomical debt.

The sky gradually brightened.

Li Xian, stripped to the waist, walked out of the house. Before leaving, he instructed, "Little Fan, I'm going to dig some wild vegetables for breakfast. Study hard and don't go outside and freeze."

Li Xiaofan watched Li Xian's back, his eyes slightly moist. His fingernails dug into his palm as he muttered to himself, "Brother, I won't let you down. Once I become an official, we'll have good days! I'll get you a beautiful wife and give you the best of everything!"

Li Xian didn't go to pick wild vegetables. Instead, he went to the [One Harmony Manor] outside Qingning County.

The manor covered a vast area. Legend had it that a formidable figure lived there. Hundreds or thousands of servants inside and outside the manor served her alone!

Dozens of people were already gathered there, all in tattered clothes. Li Xian sighed silently. Such was the world; it wasn't just the two brothers who suffered.

"Come on, come on! Those who want to sell themselves into the manor, line up. Don't push. Our One Harmony Manor doesn't want beasts without discipline."

The manor gate opened, and a middle-aged man with a long whip walked over. He shouted casually, but his voice carried far.

This man was Luo Fang, the steward of the One Harmony Manor. Behind him followed seven or eight subordinates, all tall and neatly dressed.

The crowd jostled, and suddenly someone fell to the ground.

*Crack!*

Luo Fang frowned and flicked his whip, striking the man. Instantly, skin split and flesh tore, blood gushing out. The man didn't even have time to scream before he was knocked unconscious.

Luo Fang cursed, "You狗东西 (bastard)! I told you to stand in line properly. Didn't you hear? Take him away. Letting someone like this into the manor would dirty the Madam's eyes!"

Two strong men behind him hoisted the man up and threw him on the roadside like a stray dog.

Li Xian turned to look, sighing silently. This man was probably done for. The steward and his entourage had strength that was strangely immense.

"In my memories... it seems martial artists have great capabilities?"

Li Xian didn't think too much about it and stood honestly in the crowd.

Luo Fang shouted, "We don't keep idlers in the manor. The Madam has a compassionate heart; she is a fairy-like figure. Winter is approaching, and she knows many must be struggling to survive."

"Coincidentally, our manor needs manpower. We are giving you a way to live; you must cherish it. If you miss this village, there won't be another shop."

Luo Fang paced back and forth, his head held high, his superiority undisguised.

"We are recruiting thirty servants. You lot are over thirty... Hmm... The few at the back, you can leave. You have no chance."

Hearing this.

A woman at the back fell to her knees with a thud, wailing, "Master, Master, please have mercy... My baby has no milk. I'll do anything if you let me in. Please!"

"Get lost. A lowly life, freezing or starving to death, what does it have to do with me?" Luo Fang shouted coldly, driving the woman away.

Li Xian saw the woman's plight but was powerless to help; he could only turn a blind eye.

The remaining people entered the manor one by one to register their basic information. Even as household servants, there were hierarchies.

Servants like Li Xian, newly entering the manor, were the lowest of the low. Servants who had entered earlier couldn't help but puff out their chests when looking at them.

"The price for selling yourself is five hundred and twenty-five copper coins, plus a set of servant clothes. Food, clothing, and lodging are all provided within the manor. Additionally, you will receive a monthly salary of fifty copper coins. If you have no objections, sign the indenture."

The accountant looked at the servants and said indifferently.

The servants were ecstatic, rushing to sign. Li Xian, however, felt a wave of sorrow. Human life was so cheap.

Looking at the indenture, he gritted his teeth and wrote his name.

"Yo, your handwriting is quite good." The accountant raised an eyebrow and looked at Li Xian a few more times.

After signing the indenture, they each received their money and servant clothes.

"You have the afternoon. Go home if you need to, share the good news with your family. Starting tomorrow, you cannot leave the manor without permission."

Luo Fang said to the servants. Feeling it wasn't enough, he cracked the whip in the air, making a sound like a firecracker.

"Also, don't think about taking the money and running. The便宜 (benefit) of my One Harmony Manor isn't that easy to take!"

"Little Fan, I'm back."

Li Xian returned to the thatched cottage and called out a few times.

"Brother, where are the wild vegetables? Why did it take so long to pick them?" Li Xiaofan's small body was completely wrapped in the long jacket.

The two brothers shared one piece of clothing. Li Xian wore the pants, and Li Xiaofan wore the top.

"Eat what wild vegetables? We're having some meat today." Li Xian laughed, taking out some pork he had just bought from the market.

It wasn't much, but enough for the brothers to taste meat.

"Brother! You..."

Li Xiaofan's body trembled; he had already guessed the reason.

Li Xian laughed heartily. "I sold myself to the One Harmony Manor. I got five hundred and twenty-five copper coins and a set of clothes."

"But from now on, I won't be able to come and go freely. Let's have a good meal together. Father's clothes... I'll take them off for you to wear, and I'll leave the remaining five hundred coins."

"You study hard. I'll work in the manor. If I have any extra money, I'll find a way to give it to you."

Li Xiaofan's eyes were wet. "Brother..."

Li Xian laughed heartily, gently stroking Li Xiaofan's head. "I'm your brother. I have to take on this responsibility. You have a photographic memory; that's something I can't match."

"By the way, I've had a new realization regarding the Raging Bull Fist recently. I'll demonstrate it a few more times for you. You must remember it; it's good to have some self-defense skills."

Li Xiaofan wiped his tears and nodded firmly. "Okay."

Li Xian set his stance in the room and threw a punch, like a wild bull charging.

Suddenly—

*[Ten thousand punches thrown, will steadfast, spirit unyielding. Awakened Destiny: Heaven Rewards Diligence]*

*[What is付出 (given) shall be 收获 (gained).]*

*[Proficiency: 456/500 (Entry Level)]*

*[Description: Simple fist wind, momentum like a bull, refines flesh and blood. There are no shortcuts to this martial art, only "hard work".]*
