# Chapter 100: The Heavenly Work Cave

"Father! Last time he practiced, the stone lock fell and shook the ground so hard that the striped cat went crazy, jumping all over the courtyard! I..."

Watching the girl being pulled down from the courtyard wall by the man, Xu Yunfan silently placed the stone lock to one side, quickly washed off the sweat, and returned to his room to lie down and sleep.

These days had been too bitter, mostly spent using the Spirit Inscription Technique to cultivate instead of sleeping. Today, he had finally perfected his skin training, achieving the Golden Skin state. In the coming days, once he brought his bone and tendon training to perfection, he would consider breaking through the External Three Unions to become a Great Martial Master.

Once he achieved the External Three Unions, his tendons, bones, and skin would be completely set. As his realm grew higher in the future, it would be harder than climbing to the heavens to train them again. With the Attribute Panel in hand, the three martial arts he cultivated could all reach the perfect realm, so he naturally wouldn't skip over it.

Achieving 100% completion had always been his motto from his previous life. He couldn't feel satisfied unless he achieved full collection in every game he played.

Moreover, in this life, practicing martial arts, if he didn't proceed step by step, how could he reach the peak of the martial path to take a look?

The next day, until the sun was high in the sky, when the sound of the Long Wind Tavern's servant shouting about delivering food came from outside the courtyard, Xu Yunfan responded from inside his room before slowly getting up.

He fastened the Extreme Path Remains into a vest style and wore it, strapped the iron box to his back, stretched, and his body emitted a series of popping sounds like frying beans.

Very good.

After eating, settling the bills for the courtyard and the food, Xu Yunfan led out his Scale Horse. Just as he was about to walk out of the courtyard, he saw the girl who had been perched on the wall last night and her old father, who were organizing luggage on a carriage.

The girl saw Xu Yunfan, glared at him angrily, let out a soft huff, and turned her head away.

A slightly awkward smile appeared on the man's face, and he nodded to Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan nodded back without a word, mounted his horse, and left.

The girl said, "Father, look at you, so cowardly. You don't show any of your martial strength, making others think we're easy to bully."

The man said sternly, "Siyang, when you're out and about, walking the Jianghu, you naturally have to be kind to others. If you make enemies casually, someone might suddenly rise up and crush you to the ground with a flick of their hand. You must remember, our Heavenly Work Cave isn't famous for martial power, but for weapon ingenuity. Only by making things convenient for others can we stand firm for nearly a thousand years."

"Alright, alright, I've heard these words so much my ears are calloused. Let's hurry on our way. We've been in the state city for days, bought enough things, and I've had enough. When I get back, I want a few peaceful days."

"..."

Xu Yunfan quickly left the city. Where the dust rose, the bay horse had already vanished into the distance.

The journey was uneventful. Following the main road, in just an hour's time, he arrived in the territory of Bull Ox Mountain. From afar, he saw the Heavenly Work Cave. The outline of Bull Ox Mountain was like a Thousand Mechanism Lock inverted into the clouds.

It was more like a Heavenly Work City built against the mountain than a cave. The towering walls were all made of fine steel, and the sound of gears clicking could be heard from time to time. The so-called Heavenly Work Cave was actually a city of mechanisms hollowed out of half the mountain.

On the hundred-zhang high fine steel walls, three hundred and sixty bronze watchtowers spiraled up the mountain's contour, and every crenel protruded with a cold, sharp, armor-piercing crossbow.

Even more wondrous was that the mountain's surface was covered with honeycomb-like holes. Every three quarters of an hour, steam would gush out accompanied by the sound of rotating gears.

At the main entrance, nine floodgates were slowly rising, revealing the crisscrossing bronze tracks inside—mechanical beast carts loaded with Blazing Fire Ore were speeding along the cliff face. The sparks from the iron wheels rubbing against the cables turned the Heavenly Work Cave into a burning forge.

"This..."

Xu Yunfan looked at the distant mechanical city with utter shock. He truly hadn't expected that with ancient productivity, such a city could be born. How much iron must have been used to cast it.

As he drew closer, a loudspeaker-like device on the city wall suddenly sounded.

"Halt, who goes there and what is your purpose?"

He looked up at the seventy-two bronze spy tubes extending from the gate, like a fly's eyes. The surfaces carved with Taotie patterns were adjusting their angles with the rotation of gears, refracting the harsh sunlight into a scorching web of light.

A nine-linked copper sound-transmitting tube suddenly popped out from a hidden compartment in the wall, which was the source of the voice just now.

Xu Yunfan said, "I have a broken weapon that needs to be recast. Please do me a favor."

"Sir, you seem to have quite a bit of killing intent gathered about you lately. You must have experienced many battles on your way here. Your purse seems quite full, it seems..."

The voice suddenly stopped. It turned out Xu Yunfan had flicked a silver ingot from his fingers, accurately embedding it into a hidden compartment extending below the sound-transmitting tube.

"Ahem! However, upon seeing your righteous face, you must be a great hero who eliminates harm for the people. Naturally, there is a VIP passage specially for heroes like you. Please step onto the slide platform. We will take good care of your horse."

The sound of gears was as cheerful as a spinning wheel, and copper spikes retracted into the hidden compartment, taking the silver ingot with them.

A three-foot square hidden door suddenly appeared at the base of the city wall. Steam smelling of sulfur rose, and a bronze slide platform emerged. The platform's surface was inscribed with the remnants of the "Thousand Mechanisms Manual" in bold, sharp strokes.

However, he couldn't understand it.

The moment Xu Yunfan stepped onto the platform, seventy-two iron chains shot out from the mountain body.

The slide platform raced along hidden tracks carved into the cliff face. As it passed, the honeycomb-like holes spewed scorching steam. In the abyss to the right, a thousand-toothed forging hammer driven by a waterfall was continuously hammering the Xuan Steel, sending sparks flying.

At the end of the slide, a gate opened with a rumble. Xu Yunfan squinted to avoid the oncoming heat wave, and found himself inside the Heavenly Work City.

Under the dome, three hundred and sixty floating forging platforms hung suspended, each secured by thick chains. On every platform stood a Nine-Aperture Burning Wind Furnace. Bearded master craftsmen, riding gear-driven ladders and holding tubes embedded with Ice Essence, were adjusting the molten steel waterfalls inside the furnaces.

Under this Bull Ox Mountain, there absolutely lay an extremely rich iron ore vein.

After stepping off the slide platform, Xu Yunfan looked up and saw a continuous stretch of brick and tile buildings ahead, with many pedestrians coming and going. What made the corner of his eye twitch slightly was that on the other side, the floodgate there was bustling with travelers and merchants.

In the market on the left, a vendor carrying a pole of candied hawthorns was haggling with a camel caravan. In the tavern on the right, a drunkard was playing a gear-driven pipa, producing a discordant tune. And the "VIP passage" gate he had just passed through was empty for half a day.

He had been ripped off!

"Little brother, please. What kind of weapon do you want to forge?"

A burly man walked up to him. The muscles on his sinewy right arm jumped like living mice, but the hammer he held was as steady as Mount Tai.

A first-level martial artist, a craftsman with perfected skin training.

Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised.

"That place can also be used for entry and exit?"

The craftsman replied, "The Heavenly Work Cave doesn't seal its gates. This place is also called Heavenly Work Town, personally named by the State Governor. Naturally, there are many travelers coming and going."

Xu Yunfan looked up at the mechanical plaque above that read "Heavenly Work City" and remained silent.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's lack of interest, the craftsman smiled and said, "Don't think you've been overcharged. Our Heavenly Work Cave is honest with everyone, young or old. Since you gave the silver, you naturally get better treatment. What weapon do you want to forge? Show me."

"A broken Weng Jin Hammer."

Xu Yunfan took out the hammer head and the broken fine steel handle from his waist.
