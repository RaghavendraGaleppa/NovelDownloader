# Chapter 62: Breakthrough Point +1

Half an hour later.

The misty rain suddenly dissipated, and the gray haze-like clouds dispersed. A ray of sunlight broke through the gaps in the clouds, soon casting dappled light through the forest, illuminating half of Wang Chan's face.

Birds chirped in the woods, insects hummed, and leaves danced in the wind, floating past his eyes before landing on a pale white undergarment embroidered with green lotus flowers—a mid-grade magical garment. Yet at this moment, Wang Chan had no mind to appreciate the beautiful scenery around him.

His face was etched with lingering fear, his clothes soaked in cold sweat. Despite his best efforts to control his thoughts, the echoes of sound still lingered in his ears.

That woman, Mo Jingchun, had somehow managed to make the chilly late autumn feel like spring.

Though the breeze carried fresh air, his damned nose still caught the lingering scent of that debauched encounter.

Looking at the mess on the ground, he mused that come spring, the plants here would surely flourish.

"What a lunatic!" 

After suppressing his emotions for so long, Wang Chan finally couldn't hold back a curse.

He never would have dreamed that his identity as a lowly wilderness rogue cultivator—despised by noble ladies—would make him a tool for Mo Jingchun to secretly retaliate against her Dao companion!

She was an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, practicing orthodox techniques with terrifyingly pure mana. How could her mentality be so twisted, as if she were seriously ill?

Would a normal Foundation Establishment female cultivator ever do something so absurd?

Utterly ridiculous.

Most importantly, even an ant might aspire to the heavens. Did being a Foundation Establishment female cultivator give her the right to violate another's will and commit such an act?

Wang Chan instinctively wanted to throw the faintly scented green storage pouch in his hand to the ground, treating it like worthless trash.

But when his divine sense inadvertently swept over its contents, his expression froze.

Then, he clenched the pouch tightly and discreetly tucked it into his sleeve.

Truly a noble lady—she had tossed out 10,000 spirit coins without batting an eye, as casually as he might throw a single coin now.

Since what was done was done, Wang Chan naturally wouldn't turn his nose up at money.

"There will be many hardships on the path of cultivation. When you can't resist, learn to adapt and even enjoy it when necessary."

Wang Chan sighed.

Come to think of it, he now understood the meaning of the saying, "Better to die under the peony than live as a ghost."

Was cultivation enjoyable?

When mana condensed and circulated through his body, the sensation was undeniably pleasurable.

But… when Mo Jingchun, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, joined in, the pleasure doubled.

His first time in this life wasn't bad at all. As a mere rogue Qi Refinement cultivator, he had unexpectedly tasted the flavor of a noble lady—a Foundation Establishment cultivator, no less.

The only regret was that she had been too dominant, leaving him no room to perform. After all, it had been against his will.

Thus, he hadn't dared—nor had the chance—to unleash his full potential, let alone display his true prowess.

Yet even so, during the act, she had praised him for being as wild as a demonic beast, urging him not to stop.

Afterward, she had silently tossed him a storage pouch, perhaps out of guilt or compensation.

This instantly snapped Wang Chan out of his post-climax clarity and into utter confusion. He couldn't fathom this woman's thoughts or logic, leaving him somewhat speechless. What did she take him for?

Moreover, after the act, she seemed to have resolved some inner turmoil, breaking through a bottleneck. Her aura became even more refined, her mana flowing as smoothly as a spring breeze, making one instinctively want to draw closer.

She had even playfully pressed a finger to her lips, whispering like a gossipy neighbor rather than a lofty Foundation Establishment cultivator:

"Little rogue cultivator, let this stay between us—heaven knows, earth knows, you know, and I know. Don't speak of it… This time, I've broken through and overcome my emotional tribulation. From now on, I'll remain chaste and devoted to the Dao. With my mind untainted by inner demons and my heart at peace, I've gained a sliver of a chance to advance to the Nascent Soul stage…

Oh, and don’t die, alright? Keep cultivating diligently. If, by some chance, you reach Foundation Establishment and your techniques are formidable, I'll give you a chance to challenge me. If you can overpower me, I'll assist your cultivation once more—after all, I owe you a karmic debt."

With that, she pulled up her skirt and vanished into a streak of green light, leaving Wang Chan alone.

"A true man knows when to bend and when to stand tall. For now, I'll remember this humiliation," Wang Chan muttered, unsure what kind of cultivation method required such absurd actions to overcome emotional tribulations and inner demons.

His gaze swept the area as he picked up the lotus-embroidered undergarment and carefully stashed it away. "If I reach Foundation Establishment, once won't be enough…"

Just then, a virtual message abruptly appeared before his eyes.

**[Breakthrough Point +1]**

Wang Chan froze, then opened his status panel in disbelief.

**Breakthrough Point (1/1): 1**

"Holy…"

His heart skipped a beat.

The surprise was so sudden that he was momentarily stunned.

As his thoughts raced, he wondered, "Was it because she was a woman, or because she was a Foundation Establishment cultivator?"

Before he could sort through his thoughts, a woman in apricot-yellow Daoist robes appeared on an ancient bridge in the distance. Riding a small donkey and holding an oil-paper umbrella, she cheerfully headed toward the Black River Market.

And all around her, within a radius of several dozen feet, there wasn't another soul in sight.

"Time to show what I'm really capable of."

Wang Chan vanished from his spot.

Ten breaths later.

The sound of a scuffle erupted somewhere.

Thirteen breaths later.

A woman's scream and a donkey's bray rang out in quick succession, then faded just as swiftly.

---

The same riverside cave as before, but no longer dark, damp, or reeking of mildew.

Wang Chan effortlessly carried the robed female cultivator as he leaped out of the water, his ghostly figure flickering against the cave walls.

The cave had been renovated—not quite a three-bedroom suite, but spacious and bright.

Warm yellow glowstones bathed the surroundings in a cozy light, complemented by luxurious rugs, a comfortable jade bed, fragrant incense, and a simple array formation. It was the perfect setting for activities best kept private.

Gently placing the unconscious woman on the jade bed, Wang Chan inspected the Thunder-Sealing Runes on her body—flawless and intact.

He then retrieved several talismans from his storage pouch before transforming into a ripple and diving back into the nearby river.

About the time it takes to burn an incense stick, he returned to the cave's entrance, the talismans now gone.

Still unsatisfied, he summoned two black needles, which dissolved into dark Yin energy, silently weaving through the cave walls, invisible and intangible.

Next, he took out two mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans and activated them.

Two yellow lights sank into the ground, causing a slight tremor before a pair of earthen-yellow barriers rose, encasing the jade bed within a three-zhang radius.

Earth Prison Talismans were typically defensive, but unlike other barrier talismans, they anchored to the earth, immobile once cast.

Seeing the dense runic patterns swirling across the dual barriers, Wang Chan felt reassured. Even if someone launched a high-grade attack spell, they wouldn't break through both layers easily.

These talismans could last for an hour—far longer than most defensive talismans. Though an hour wasn't their limit, time was of the essence. Best to resolve things within that timeframe.

With that in mind, Wang Chan flicked his left sleeve, causing the Thunder-Sealing Runes on the woman to dissolve into her body. Five silver needles shot out from her and vanished into his right sleeve.

He then turned away, hands clasped behind his back, staring at the river as if guarding against potential intruders—leaving only his broad back facing the jade bed.

Before long, the robed female cultivator let out a soft moan as she gradually regained consciousness. Seeing the rugged figure before her, her dazed expression showed no trace of panic.

Brushing a strand of hair aside, she murmured with a faint smile,

"My heart has long been yours, Fellow Daoist Wang. Was there truly a need to ambush me and resort to such brute force?"
