# Chapter 74: Networking Pays Off, The Crowd Boos, What a Fix!

This match attracted widespread attention, simply because it was the Sect Master's true disciple's first appearance on stage.

Ying Bing stood alone, embracing her sword, radiating an icy aloofness. Like a Heavenly Mountain Snow Lotus imbued with divinity, she naturally became the focal point of all gazes.

Many beneath the stage watched intently, utterly absorbed. While her exact talent was a matter of widespread debate, her breathtaking beauty was beyond dispute. She had even cultivated a considerable fan base within the sect...

"Go Bingbing!" An unknown disciple shouted.

One shout quickly spread to two, then three, turning into a roar of collective voices. And so, the disciples of Qingyuan Sect began to cheer like a surging tide.

On the high platform.

"Go Bingbing!" Shang Wu stood up, waving her fists and hands without a care for her image.

Elder Hancrane's mouth twitched slightly. What was she doing? As an elder, presiding over a peak, without a shred of dignity—how undignified was that?

"Go Bingbing!" That Elder Su from Luoxia Peak shouted with exceptional volume.

Hancrane: "..."

Ying Bing is fighting *your* disciple, hey!

The high platform became quite lively for a moment. As for the other large and small sects, there was even less need to mention them; they watched with bated breath and utmost seriousness. After all, many of them had ascended the mountain precisely because of that heaven-shattering radiant glow. That radiant opportunity might very well have landed on Ying Bing.

The scene became a little chaotic for a moment.

On the opposite side, a drop of cold sweat trickled down Xie Lan'ai's forehead. It wasn't because outsiders were supporting Ying Bing, but because of Ying Bing herself. But she gritted her teeth and still spoke:

"Junior Sister, I'd like to add a stake. If I win, I ask that you relinquish the Skyfrost Sword. If I lose..."

"Alright."

Before Xie Lan'ai could finish her sentence, she heard a voice like jade falling onto a plate agree. She hadn't even finished listing her own stake. This sparked a feeling of displeasure in Xie Lan'ai's heart.

"Since that's the case, Junior Sister, please make your move."

"You first."

Ying Bing raised her gaze to assess her for the first time. Xie Lan'ai understood this wasn't humility. Her meaning was: if she moved first, Xie Lan'ai wouldn't have a chance to strike.

What arrogance!

Li Mo's scalp tingled, and he took a deep breath. Yes, absolutely right. That's the vibe.

"Junior Sister, be careful!"

Xie Lan'ai spoke no further, immediately unleashing the Spirit Serpent Sword Art to its utmost, sending an unpredictable flurry of sharp edges sweeping forth, intending to suppress her opponent with the abundant inner qi of her Jade Liquid Realm cultivation and the advantage of her cultivation level. Her anger didn't mean she underestimated her opponent. To have a Profound Weapon acknowledge her as its master, her opponent's sword dao attainment must certainly be above hers. But her advantages were still considerable: a higher cultivation realm, more extensive combat experience...

In that instant, she thought of many things. She even considered how she would seal off Ying Bing's retreat after a dodge, or if Ying Bing retaliated, how she would overwhelm her step by step with her own rhythm.

But in reality... she had overthought everything.

The woven sword light pressed down, the sharp inner qi tore through the air. Even someone of the same realm would be severely wounded if grazed by such sharpness. Yet a fair hand passed through the sword aura as if it were nothing. Amidst the unpredictable sword moves, it was as effortless as plucking a leaf in one's own backyard.

The Spirit Serpent Sword Art halted. Because the flexible sword was now clamped between two fair, slender fingers.

Clang—

A light flick of the finger. The sword's edge actually recoiled, grazing its owner's lapel. Just a fraction more, and it would have pierced her chest.

Xie Lan'ai stood frozen, pupils constricted, her breathing stopped. She instinctively looked at the maiden just a sword's length away, only to see those ice-mirror-like eyes still possessing that tranquil, unperturbed calm.

Her opponent had shown mercy. Otherwise, that fraction wouldn't have been missed.

The entire venue fell silent.

...

On the high platform, silence had also fallen. Everyone had expected Ying Bing to win. But they never imagined it would be in such a manner, so effortlessly. Facing an opponent a whole realm higher, she hadn't even drawn her sword, merely using a tiny trace of inner qi to envelop her fingertips.

"That sword of hers, is it called Skyfrost?" The white-robed youth from Fenyu Forest no longer showed any trace of arrogance on his face.

The scholarly-robed middle-aged man didn't answer him, merely sighing with emotion: "How is it that every time Qingyuan Sect's power wanes, it always produces a peerless genius..."

As for the elders' reactions, there's no need to elaborate further here. Little Li had a broadcast going on.

"This woman, terrifying to such an extent!"

"Hiss..."

"What are you doing?" Ying Bing frowned slightly, watching Li Mo, who was sometimes speaking in a low voice, sometimes gasping in a cold breath, his theatrical persona acting up.

Li Mo: "I'm performing as a qualified shocked passerby."

Ying Bing: "?"

...

After drinking some more tea, just as Li Mo was about to get up to relieve himself, Elder Qian Bufan's voice rang out:

"Next match. Lin Jiang of Ruyi Peak, against... Li Mo of Qunyu Peak!"

Good news: it was finally his turn. Bad news: he really needed to go right now.

Coincidentally, his very first match was against an acquaintance. Indeed, as soon as Elder Qian Bufan finished announcing the two names, all eyes in the venue turned to look, many carrying a scrutinizing gaze.

There had always been much discussion about Li Mo within the sect. Some said he was eager to help others and upheld justice, a warm-hearted gentleman of ancient virtues. Others said his strength was insufficient and he couldn't be compared to Ying Bing, much less be called one of Qingyuan Sect's twin prodigies. Some detractors claimed he was a pretty boy, a male companion kept by Elder Shang Wu... Of course, such rumors were purely malicious gossip from envious haters. Senior disciples of Qingyuan Sect knew that Elder Shang Wu herself was penniless; how could she afford to keep a male companion?

In short, opinions varied widely. But one thing was certain: everyone wanted to see what this True Disciple Li was truly capable of.

Under the watchful eyes of the crowd, Li Mo couldn't very well announce that he needed to go to the toilet first. So he could only ascend the stage and quietly say:

"Brother Lin, let's finish this quickly."

"Alrighty then."

And so, Lin Jiang, who had just ascended the stage, walked to the edge of the arena. One second after Elder Qian's command of "Begin!" he jumped off the arena.

"I concede."

Lin Jiang shouted without hesitation, afraid that if he called out a moment too late, Li Mo might make a move.

Disciples: "Huh?"

Elders: "??"

Spectators from other sects: "???"

What the heck, isn't this rigged?! You two are both in the Qi-Blood Realm, yet you concede without even fighting? Are you taking us, the audience, for fools?! Lin Jiang, do you have any respect for us? Screw this, refund!

Oh, wait, we didn't pay any money. Never mind then. But there must be a problem here, a huge problem!

The rules didn't say one couldn't concede, and falling outside the arena was indeed judged as a loss, but it was still the first time such a bizarre incident had occurred. All the prominent sects of Ziyang Prefecture were present, and Qian Bufan also felt it was a bit embarrassing, so he hurried back to discuss with the other elders.

"How do we rule this?"

"Should we make them fight again?"

"Look at Lin Jiang's demeanor, is there even a need to fight again? It's pointless."

The elders couldn't reach a conclusion. Elder Qian Bufan suddenly thought of something, and asked suspiciously, "Shang Wu, my martial-niece, you wouldn't have secretly threatened Lin Jiang to make him concede directly, would you?"

The elders all looked at her; this was indeed something she was capable of.

"Watch your words! Do I need to bother threatening a mere disciple? Too much trouble. Wouldn't it be more convenient to just threaten Elder Qian to blow a black whistle (fix the match)?" Shang Wu was furious. They could question her character, but questioning her intelligence was truly infuriating.

Elders: "..."

What exactly are you being so self-righteous about?

And so, Elder Qian could only helplessly announce: "Li Mo wins!"

"Hiss..." A chorus of boos rose from below the stage.

Li Mo remained silent for a moment, then gave a wry smile. "Brother Lin, fast it was, but... why go to such lengths?"

"I'm not stupid." Lin Jiang shook his head like a rattle-drum. He remembered very clearly: during the sect trial, Brother Li's single punch turned Wang Hu, who had suffocated him, into a cripple. Even the Spiny-backed Tortoise's shell was shattered... He was practically a human calamity beast. Fighting Brother Li? Wasn't that just asking for trouble? By conceding now, he could still preserve his strength for the next match. If he didn't concede, then he wouldn't need to consider his ranking in the Nine Peaks Grand Martial Meet at all. What if Brother Li couldn't hold back? He'd have to start planning a funeral feast...
