# Chapter 391: The Three-Month Deadline

The head of Xu Yunfan’s hammer was pressed three inches from his throat, the wind from the strike causing his Adam's apple to bob violently.

"When does the passage to the Taihua Lingxu Realm open?"

Xu Yunfan’s voice was calm, as if asking about the weather.

Xu Tian’s forehead broke out in a cold sweat. "We entered through a Realm Talisman... it opens once every three hundred years. From the moment we entered, the next opening will be on the New Moon night three months from now."

Before he could finish, his eyes suddenly widened.

Xu Yunfan’s left hand had already pressed against the crown of his head. Gathering his vast True Qi, he forcibly used the technique from the True武 Devouring Demons Sutra to simulate a golden light for soul searching, piercing straight into Xu Tian’s Sea of Consciousness.

Although the True武 Devouring Demons Sutra had not yet formed a distinct skill on his attribute panel, several of its techniques could still be forcibly utilized.

However, using True Qi to drive them was incredibly inefficient. If not for Xu Yunfan’s immense reserves, it would have been impossible to achieve.

"Ah!!"

Amidst a blood-curdling scream, Xu Tian watched as his memories were roughly flipped through like the pages of a book. From the entrance examination for joining the Primordial Origin Sect, to the secrets he had overheard the elders discussing—even the embarrassing incident of wetting the bed at ten years old were all dug out.

When the soul search touched upon memories related to the "Primordial Origin Order," a blinding blood light suddenly exploded from within Xu Tian’s body.

"A restriction?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. The pure Yang True Qi in his palm transformed into a furnace, forcibly refining the blood curse that was attempting to self-destruct the soul.

Suddenly, his expression shifted. He decisively cut off the flow of True Qi. This blood curse was extremely strange. When the Ten Extremes True Qi transformed into pure Yang to refine it, it instead fueled the curse's power. It felt somewhat like a bone-eating maggot, attempting to follow the channel of his True Qi and rush into his own body.

It seemed he wouldn't be able to extract the secrets this way.

Xu Yunfan’s mind raced, and he quickly made a decision.

Just as Xu Yunfan was about to deliver the killing blow, Xu Tian suddenly roared, "Keep me alive! If you go out alone, you’re dead for sure! You’re a native of the Divine Martial Realm. If you go out alone, the Hundred Flowers True Personage of the Hundred Desires Peak will definitely kill you on the spot!"

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s descending hand pause slightly, he quickly pointed at the Primordial Origin Order at Xu Yunfan’s waist. "Without a living witness, how will you prove that you are a 'disciple accidentally swept in' during training?"

"Training disciple?"

"Yes, yes, that's right!" Xu Yunfan hurriedly said, "A training disciple! Only with this identity can you evade the Hundred Flowers True Personage’s investigation. A Foundation Establishment True Personage can trace causality. If you hold the Primordial Origin Order and become a training disciple by my side, you naturally won't be suspected."

Xu Yunfan’s movements stalled. Suddenly, he felt an unusual fluctuation from the Extreme Dao Remains on his chest.

Yu Congling’s residual consciousness seeped out like mist, whispering in his ear, "Since the Primordial Origin Order is in your hand, why not play along? This order is an unnamed disciple token of the Primordial Origin Sect. Since you have killed its original owner, you are the legitimate Primordial Origin Sect disciple."

An unnamed disciple token...

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but mutter internally. This Primordial Origin Sect—or rather, worthy of being the Primordial Origin Demon Sect—played their cards well. Did this allow low-level disciples to switch masters everywhere?

Or was it because low-level disciples were consumed too frequently that they could only use this method to replenish their numbers?

"Interesting."

Xu Yunfan weighed the hot token in his hand and suddenly flipped his palm, striking Xu Tian’s Dantian. The Ten Extremes True Qi, like a venomous dragon entering the sea, stirred a mighty force and formed a seal in his Qi Sea acupoint.

"Lead the way. If I don't see the passage to the Taihua Lingxu Realm in three months..."

His fingertips swept across Xu Tian’s neck, and a strand of hair fell silently.

Hearing this, Xu Tian trembled all over, and fine sweat instantly beaded on his forehead. He hunched his back, fingers unconsciously clutching his clothes, knuckles turning white from the force. His Adam's apple bobbed several times before he squeezed out a trembling voice from between his teeth.

"Brother Xu, please be clear, I will..."

Before he could finish, he suddenly froze.

He saw Xu Yunfan holding the bronze token in his palm. The lingering soul thoughts of Chen Jiuchuan flickered like a candle in the wind. As the five fingers tightened, the wisp of smoke vanished amidst a piercing shriek. The incident that should have triggered an alarm on the Soul Lamp was silenced because the original owner had already had his soul scattered and body destroyed.

Xu Tian’s pupils constricted, and the hair on the back of his neck stood on end.

He knew exactly what this meant. Xu Yunfan was clearly forcing him to hand over the Life and Death Talisman!

"What's wrong?"

Xu Yunfan’s fingertips tapped lightly on the token, the scales of the armor clashing with a sound of gold and jade. "Doesn't the Silent Dust Heart Sutra of the Micro Dust Peak claim to have 'One Thought Birth and Death'? Chen Jiuchuan of White岳 Peak could do it, surely you can too?"

Sweat slid down Xu Tian’s temples as he cursed Chen Jiuchuan in his heart for being a coward. To save his own life, he had let someone else control his life and death, only to end up with his soul destroyed and body perished.

He secretly formed a hand seal to test the waters, only to find the seal in his Dantian was immovable.

Looking at the increasingly fierce light in Xu Yunfan’s eyes...

"I'll hand it over!"

He tore open his chest, a strange fluctuation rippling over his skin. Opening his mouth, he spat out a wisp of soul thread entangled with black gas.

The soul thread turned into a wisp of smoke the moment it left his body and surged into the token in Xu Yunfan’s hand.

Xu Yunfan felt the token grow slightly heavier. He clearly sensed a bizarre connection established between this token and Xu Tian.

As long as he moved his mind slightly, he could shatter Xu Tian’s soul.

"Is Brother satisfied now?"

Xu Tian collapsed to the ground, the fawning smile on his face uglier than a cry.

As a training disciple, it was appropriate to call him "Brother."

In the sleeve that Xu Yunfan couldn't see, Xu Tian’s fingernails had already pierced his own palm. The strange thoughts that had risen in his heart were now completely wiped out.

His life was in Xu Yunfan’s hands. Even if Xu Yunfan died, he would be taken down with him first.

As a low-level disciple, he didn't have many people behind him to guide him away.

"Good meaning, Xu Shidi. I'm also surnamed Xu. Those with the surname Xu, five hundred years ago we were one family!"

Watching Xu Yunfan’s indifferent expression suddenly bloom into a smile, Xu Tian really wanted to roll his eyes.

He was born in the Taihua Lingxu Realm; what does that have to do with you, a native of the Divine Martial Realm?

"Yes, yes! Perhaps we really are from the same family!" Xu Tian squeezed out a smile, looking seriously thoughtful, then suddenly clapped his hands. "Five hundred years ago, one of my Xu ancestors also entered the Divine Martial Realm. Maybe it really is true!"

He really knows how to ride the wave.

Xu Yunfan tugged at the corner of his mouth, and his smile quickly cooled down.

"Next, we just need to wait for the opening in three months?"

Xu Tian’s heart trembled, and he hurriedly nodded. "Yes, we just need to wait quietly."

"You guys came to the Divine Martial Realm and aren't going to harvest?"

"..." We've already searched. Aside from the Dao Sect where Brother comes from, there's basically nothing left."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. "Then let's wait quietly."

Xu Yunfan’s sleeve shook lightly, and the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammer turned into a stream of light and vanished into the Sack of Dimensions.

He raised his eyes to look at the gray dome of the Divine Martial Realm. The Ten Extremes True Qi swirled like a star vortex in his pupils, vaguely catching sight of the Xuanhuang Qi steaming from the Dao Sect’s mountain gate three thousand miles away.

"First, we go to the Dao Sect to wait."

As Xu Yunfan’s words fell,缕缕 golden mist suddenly wrapped around Xu Tian’s waist. It was exactly the "Devouring Demon Binding Soul Rope" that Xu Yunfan had attempted to simulate using the True武 Devouring Demons Sutra.
