# Chapter 48: Mo Changyun, the Mastermind

“Did that person accept the invitation?”

“Yes, he finally emerged from two years of secluded cultivation!”

In the imperial palace of Weidu, still in the same waterside pavilion, the python-robed youth and the middle-aged guard appeared.

The python-robed youth, who was the Fourth Prince of Wei State, had a trace of doubt in his brows:

“You said he is Mo Changyun, a former Elder of the Mo family. Are you certain?”

“This subordinate is seventy percent certain!” the guard quickly replied. He explained, “I thoroughly questioned Elder Hong. The number of high-grade and mid-grade alchemists in our Wei State is limited, and almost all of them belong to major powers. It’s absolutely impossible for a powerful alchemist to suddenly appear!”

“This person took a Nine-leaf Spirit Ganoderma and frequently purchased materials for refining Qi Nourishing Pills, which indicates that he, or someone behind him, is at least a mid-grade alchemist!”

“But I investigated every mid-grade alchemist in Wei State and found that the only one who fits the description is the missing Elder Mo Changyun from the Mo family!”

“So I suspect that either this person is Mo Changyun himself, or Mo Changyun is backing him.”

“Mo Changyun, he’s an Elder of the Mo family, why would he hide?” The Fourth Prince’s eyes were filled with confusion.

“That, this subordinate does not know!” The guard shook his head.

“Could it be that a low-grade alchemist among the rogue cultivators obtained Mo Changyun’s alchemy legacy, became a mid-grade alchemist, and is now attempting to reach the high-grade?” The Fourth Prince proposed another possibility.

“After consulting Elder Hong, this subordinate believes such a scenario is highly unlikely. The changes in the Mo family occurred eight years ago. Eight years is nowhere near enough time for a low-grade alchemist to grow to the point of refining high-grade pills!”

“Unless this person is an alchemy genius rarely seen in thousands of years!”

“That’s not impossible,” the Fourth Prince slowly remarked. “Regardless, I must know this person’s true identity!” he muttered to himself.

“Your Highness, if he truly is Mo Changyun, what should we do? Will his appearance affect the Mo family’s structure? I recall Mo Changzong saying that Mo Changyun leaned towards the Patriarch’s lineage!”

“Now that the Mo family’s Patriarch and Mo Yuancheng are both dead, and all the experts of the Patriarch’s lineage are gone, with a little manipulation, we can make Mo Changzong the Mo family’s Patriarch!”

“At that point, having him order Miss Qingchan to marry Your Highness will face no further obstacles. But if Mo Changyun suddenly emerges, the position of the Mo family’s Patriarch will once again become contentious!” the guard stated.

A subtle light flashed in the Fourth Prince’s eyes when he heard this. A faint smile appeared on his lips as he said, “Then we simply won’t let him become an obstacle. Mo Changyun had better be someone who knows his place, otherwise…”

“Perhaps if we control him, we might even be able to force Miss Qingchan to agree to the marriage!” The guard’s eyes showed a pensive look.

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but sigh.

Mo Qingchan possessed a High-grade Water Spirit Root, and the Prince he served had a High-grade Wood Spirit Root.

If Mo Qingchan could be persuaded to marry the Fourth Prince, he could utilize a certain secret dual cultivation technique of the imperial family, allowing wood to be nourished by water, thereby accelerating his cultivation speed.

In this way, the Fourth Prince would have hopes of surpassing all other Wei family disciples of his generation.

At that time, the imperial throne and the Foundation Establishment Pill would be beyond dispute.

Unfortunately, they had schemed for Mo Qingchan for years, going so far as to spend a huge price to bribe Mo Changzong, yet they were never able to facilitate the marriage.

The root cause was that the Mo family still harbored hopes of helping Mo Qingchan, with her high-grade spirit root, achieve Foundation Establishment and restore the Mo family’s glory.

If she married the Fourth Prince, she would no longer be a Mo family member.

Thus, the Patriarch’s lineage had always opposed this matter, but not long ago, several experts from that very lineage died in the battle against the Black Robe Society.

This provided the Fourth Prince with an opportune moment!

“No matter what, this person must be thoroughly investigated, and we must bring him under our control!” the Fourth Prince stated in an undeniable tone.

“Yes, Your Highness. But what if this person doesn’t come to the gathering?”

“He seized my opportunity, forcing me to use family contribution points to exchange for a Breakthrough Pill. If he continues to be uncooperative, hehe…”

The Fourth Prince said no more, but the guard understood his meaning and immediately went to make arrangements.

Lu Xu, as before, emerged from his secluded cultivation and went to a teahouse to gather news and learn about the various happenings in the cultivation world.

“The Thousand Jue Sect is completely tearing off its disguise with the Wei family!”

“Indeed, they’re openly helping the Black Robe Society now. The Thousand Jue Sect isn’t pretending anymore!”

Waves of conversation drifted from nearby, and Lu Xu’s heart stirred. He quickly pricked up his ears and listened.

Soon, he understood what had transpired.

The situation in Wei State had drastically changed!

The Thousand Jue Sect had secretly dispatched a Foundation Establishment Great Perfection expert to join forces with the Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Black Robe Society, sandwiching the three Foundation Establishment cultivators from the three-family alliance.

The two Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Chen family and White Mountain Sect were killed on the spot, while only the Wei family’s mid-stage Foundation Establishment expert managed to escape, severely wounded.

The three-family alliance was utterly annihilated.

This act was equivalent to the Thousand Jue Sect openly admitting their relationship with the Black Robe Society.

This was an earthquake for the entire Wei State cultivation world. The Thousand Jue Sect doing this was tantamount to completely falling out with the Wei family.

Was this overlord of Wei State, this Golden Core Sect, finally making its move?

“Tearing off their disguise like this, disregarding their reputation, could it be that the Thousand Jue Sect’s Golden Core Ancestor doesn’t have many years left?”

“Wei State is truly going to be in chaos. Not only can Tianmen City no longer be stayed in, but the entire Wei State as well. We must leave!”

Lu Xu heard many rogue cultivators saying this, as if leaving Tianmen City and Wei State had become a common consensus among them.

No one wished to be embroiled in war; most rogue cultivators hoped to cultivate peacefully and steadily.

“Everyone’s thinking of fleeing, like cultivation-era refugees. But aren’t I one of them too?” Lu Xu thought to himself.

“Where should I go after leaving Wei State? I need to seek an opportunity for Foundation Establishment. Thinking it over, it seems there’s only that one immortal city, independent of all nations!”

After pondering for a moment, Lu Xu found a destination for his next stop.

Among the Nine States of the Eastern Wasteland, there were four Golden Core powers.

Three of them were overlords of large states, similar to the Thousand Jue Sect. Only the fourth had no ties to any specific country.

It was a merchant alliance. Shops like Divine Talisman Hall, Hundred Herbs Pavilion, and Thousand Mechanism Hall, which had branches in various market cities across the Nine States, were all members of this alliance.

The alliance’s headquarters was located in an immortal city on the edge of the Myriad Demon Mountain Range, a city that gathered tens of thousands of cultivators.

The Foundation Establishment Pill Lu Xu sought could only be obtained there; elsewhere, hope was slim!

“Myriad Immortals City, what an imposing name. It’s a pity that no one living there could truly be called an immortal!”

“As soon as I copy martial arts experience, I’ll head there!”

Lu Xu made up his mind and quietly waited.

Half a month later, he packed everything cleanly and silently left his residence.

Changing his appearance, he circled Tianmen City a few times before leaving the immortal city where he had lived for eight years.

Lu Xu transformed into an ordinary-looking middle-aged man and headed to a forest near Weidu.

This was the location of a royal estate and also where the Fourth Prince was hosting his banquet.

Lu Xu did not intend to attend the Fourth Prince’s banquet, but he also wouldn’t easily let go of this opportunity.

So, he came to this place to wait patiently for an opportunity.
