# Chapter 136: Skywolf Island and Cleansing Spring

Su Huazheng's face alternated between green and pale, clearly in turmoil. Spiritual artifacts were invaluable treasures. Had Su Jingming not relied on the Azure Luan Mirror during his battle against the Emerald Fire-Eyed Ape, he would have perished long ago. Such artifacts could save lives.

Although the Magnetic Treasure Mirror was only a mid-grade spiritual artifact—inferior to the Azure Luan Mirror—it could suppress all metal-based treasures, even freezing sword seals momentarily. This made it particularly useful against adversaries like Gu Yuan. Su Huazheng had painstakingly procured it from his clan. Despite his background as a scion of a Golden Core family, he was only granted one such artifact, as the Su Clan had many Foundation Establishment cultivators and couldn't allocate all resources to him alone.

He had intended to use it as bait to eliminate Gu Yuan through another's hand. Yet, not only did Gu Yuan take down the demonic ape, but he was now also eyeing the Magnetic Treasure Mirror. Losing it would increase the risks in their campaign through the Scarlet Moon Great River.

"Senior Brother Su, why do you look so troubled? Are you thinking of going back on your word? Was all that grand talk earlier just to set up Junior Brother Gu for death, not a sincere gift?" Ma Wu, noticing Su Huazheng's expression, immediately spoke up loudly.

The crowd's attention shifted back to Su Huazheng. Some things were understood tacitly, but decorum had to be maintained—unless one wished to be ostracized entirely. Even a Foundation Establishment cultivator couldn't endure constant public scrutiny.

"Of course not!" Su Huazheng forced a smile. "I was merely lamenting Senior Brother Ji's fate. Had Senior Brother Gu acted sooner, perhaps Senior Brother Ji wouldn't have perished."

"Junior Brother Ji slew a demon and secured our first victory in the Southern Marsh Waters, earning him the highest merit. His descendants will inherit his honors. As for his death, it was due to the Soul Rhino Beast's influence clouding his judgment, leading him to rashly accept the challenge. His defeat was a matter of skill, not anyone else's fault," Yin Xingchao, who had remained silent aboard the flying vessel, interjected.

Su Huazheng's face paled further. He didn't know why Yin Xingchao was siding with Gu Yuan, but the situation was now irreversible.

"Senior Brother Gu, since I gave my word, I won't take it back. I hope you'll treat this treasure well," Su Huazheng said with a strained smile, wiping his spiritual imprint from the jade mirror before reluctantly handing the Magnetic Treasure Mirror to Gu Yuan.

"Rest assured, Junior Brother Su. This mirror won't be wasted in my hands," Gu Yuan replied with a faint smile, accepting the treasure without hesitation.

After paying brief respects to Ji Fenghua's remains—which were then collected by his friends and sent back to the sect with a group of Qi Refinement disciples—everyone returned to their positions on the spirit disks, channeling their energy to dismantle the formation.

---

Seven days passed as they worked to dismantle the formation, with no further provocations from the demons. But on the eighth day, the demonic formation below suddenly collapsed with a thunderous roar.

Countless demonic energies surged and exploded, while underground water currents erupted violently, obscuring the sky and shaking the flying vessel. The protective arrays flickered unsteadily, and the cultivators' spiritual energies roiled within them.

Thick demonic clouds filled the air, making it impossible to discern what was happening. Within the haze, countless figures transformed into streaks of light, fleeing toward the scattered islands in the great river.

"Trying to escape?" Yin Xingchao's eyes gleamed sharply as he saw through the chaos. He activated the flying vessel's mechanisms, and nearly ten beams of golden light shot out, piercing several fleeing figures in an instant. Yet, many more escaped under the cover of the demonic mist and the remnants of the formation, scattering across the river.

Yin Xingchao prepared to strike again, but the sky was now empty, revealing only a vast, barren island. The Earth Fiend Water-Sky Formation had dissipated, replaced by sporadic arrays flickering like scattered stars across the countless islands dotting the river.

"Dividing to survive—clever!" Yin Xingchao snorted coldly, realizing the true trial was about to begin. He surveyed the cultivators aboard the vessel and declared:

"These demons have adopted the Six-Winged Purplegold Roc's strategy from the Thunderclap Mountains, scattering across the Southern Marsh. They've abandoned the unified water vein formation and instead fortified dozens of spirit islands with second-tier arrays, supporting one another. 

"If I attack one island with the flying vessel, the demons there will scatter, only to return once I leave. The only solution is for you all to descend and systematically clear each island to reclaim the Southern Marsh. 

"Powerful late-stage Earth Fiend demons still lurk here. I will remain aboard to oversee the battle. The outcome rests in your hands. Are you prepared?"

The cultivators exchanged glances. Though they had anticipated this moment, the reality was daunting. The Scarlet Moon Great River spanned thousands of miles, and the Southern Marsh was a labyrinth of swamps and waterways teeming with demons. If the demons had united for a decisive battle, the flying vessel would have been invaluable. But now, scattered across the vast expanse, the vessel was as ineffective as using a cannon to swat flies—unless the sect was willing to obliterate the islands entirely, sacrificing their spiritual veins and mineral resources. 

But the sect's goal wasn't just conquest—it was to temper its disciples. Yin Xingchao had initially planned to dismantle the Earth Fiend formation and use the vessel to eliminate key demons, easing the disciples' burden. Yet the demons had forced a protracted battle across the Southern Marsh.

After a moment of silence, the cultivators responded in unison: "We will eradicate the demons and reclaim the Southern Marsh!"

"Good!" Yin Xingchao nodded. "But the Southern Marsh is vast, and conquering it will take time. We'll start with these seven islands—the Crescent Bay."

He pointed to a cluster of seven second-tier spirit islands on the map, arranged like a crescent moon, each glowing with demonic energy and protected by arrays. 

"Divide into teams and begin the assault!"

The cultivators hesitated, then all turned to Gu Yuan. In the sect, strength dictated precedence. Having proven his prowess, Gu Yuan had the right to choose first. 

Conquering these islands wasn't just a duty—it was an opportunity. The Scarlet Moon Great River was rich in untapped resources, and the seven islands at the forefront of the Southern Marsh were particularly valuable. 

The most coveted was Skywolf Island, home to the Cleansing Spring—a rare spiritual spring that could purge pill toxins. 

For cultivators, the greatest challenge wasn't mastering techniques but advancing their cultivation. Many prodigies perished at the thresholds of breakthrough, watching helplessly as their lifespans dwindled. No matter how formidable one's combat skills were, stagnation in cultivation led only to a desolate grave. 

Thus, all cultivators sought ways to enhance their spiritual power and ascend to higher realms. But cultivation was a slow, arduous process, often requiring the aid of pills. The more pills one consumed, the more toxins accumulated, diminishing their efficacy. Hence, resources that could cleanse pill toxins were priceless. 

The demons of Skywolf Island had long profited from trading access to the spring. Its value was unmatched among the seven islands. 

As the others watched nervously, Gu Yuan chuckled and placed his finger squarely on Skywolf Island's location on the map. 

A collective sigh rose from the group.
