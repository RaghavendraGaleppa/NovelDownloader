# Chapter 2: Fleeing Far Away

Han Yue quickly steadied his emotions and began formulating his next plan.

"This place is too dangerous. I must find a way to escape before sunrise," he thought.

With that, he stood up and began ransacking the massive City Lord's residence.

Han Yue had slain over a dozen powerful demons, most of whom had turned to ashes under his lightning strikes. He rummaged through tables and chairs, searching for any valuable spoils.

These demons had sacrificed their strongest physical abilities to conform to the City Lord's peculiar tastes by taking human forms. After being struck by Han Yue's lightning, only a few remnants remained: a pair of antlers, a spine, a set of eyeballs, several teeth, and a white fox pelt left behind by the City Lord himself.

Among all the demons, only these five had been powerful enough to leave remains behind Han Yue's divine abilities. The City Lord had actually been a fox demon!

Han Yue wrapped the other items in the fox pelt and carried them toward the rear chambers. Along the way, he entered every room, ransacking cabinets and drawers, stuffing anything of value into the pelt until it was nearly bursting.

When he reached the City Lord's innermost bedroom, he found an exquisite small chest containing several thread-bound books, over a dozen pieces of jade, and a palm-sized metal ingot—likely the City Lord's true treasures. Han Yue took them all.

After completing his looting, Han Yue fetched several large buckets of oil from the kitchen and began splashing it throughout the courtyard. A thin, dark-skinned child who had been hiding in the kitchen came forward to help.

The child had been selected by the demons as dinner for the previous night, but Han Yue had saved him by claiming he was a kitchen helper. Now, they were the only two living beings left in the entire estate.

Han Yue pulled out a few gold and silver ingots from his bundle, pressed them into the boy's hands, and then shooed him out the gate, telling him to run as far as he could.

With that, Han Yue had finally accomplished the most critical task since his transmigration. He sat down in a chair to rest and summoned the thread-bound ancient book, carefully examining it.

The book's cover bore four seal-script characters: *Wan Fa Ji Lu* (Compendium of Ten Thousand Techniques). Inside the cover, a series of information was displayed:

**[Host: Han Yue]**  
**[Realm: First Stage - Body Entry]**  
**[Cultivation Techniques: None]**  
**[Keywords: None]**  
**[Divine Ability Extraction: Conditions Not Met]**

Before today, all of Han Yue's attributes had been "None." But after the battle and the baptism of lightning, his physique had been greatly enhanced.

Without having truly begun cultivation, he had instantly reached the Body Entry stage—a significant improvement.

He flipped to the next two pages, where more information appeared:

**First Page:**  
**[Divine Ability: Jade Void - Golden Light Flight Technique]**  
**[Quality: Mythic - Gold]**  
**[Proficiency: Beginner]**  
**[Keyword: Movement]**

**Second Page:**  
**[Divine Ability: Raiden Shogun - Musou no Hitotachi]**  
**[Quality: Epic - Purple]**  
**[Proficiency: Beginner]**  
**[Keyword: Severing]**

Looking at these two divine abilities, Han Yue felt slightly reassured. They were his trump cards for slaying enemies above his level and his foundation for survival in this demon-infested world.

After two extractions, he had gained a deeper understanding of how the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Techniques* worked. As its host, he could preset a keyword and extract all related memories from his past life, infusing them into the book. If conditions were met, he could then extract a divine ability closely tied to that keyword.

The richer the memories he provided and the higher the scale, the better the quality of the divine ability.

His ability to extract the mythic-grade *Golden Light Flight Technique* was closely tied to his past life. He had been a decorated Air Force pilot before retiring and becoming a commercial airline captain, primarily flying the Beijing-to-Shenzhen route. By the time he transmigrated, he had over twenty years of service and nearly forty million kilometers of flight distance—equivalent to circling the Earth's equator a thousand times.

When testing the book's functions, Han Yue chose "Movement" as his first keyword, representing his lifetime of experience. True to his expectations, the memories he poured into the book exceeded the minimum requirement by over forty times, filling the scale to its golden limit.

Thus, he obtained *Golden Light Flight Technique*, one of the strongest movement-based divine abilities. Legend had it that this technique originated from the Jade Void Palace of the Primordial Heavenly Lord, ranking among the Thirty-Six Heavenly Techniques—far surpassing even the legendary Somersault Cloud.

At its peak, it allowed the user to transform into light and traverse three hundred thousand kilometers in an instant. Even at its beginner stage, Han Yue could now move at extreme speeds along any visible light path within his line of sight.

This ability was his greatest reliance. With enough caution, he could vanish into light at the first sign of danger, ensuring his survival.

Flipping further, the *Compendium of Ten Thousand Techniques* only had five pages in total, with ten slots for divine abilities. Four pages remained blank, allowing Han Yue to extract eight more powerful abilities in the future.

He closed the book and focused inward, where two divine sigils hovered in his consciousness, still glowing faintly. Upon closer inspection, however, the *Musou no Hitotachi* sigil had noticeably faded—his power from the book had been partially depleted. The *Golden Light Flight Technique* remained largely unchanged.

Without a way to replenish his energy, Han Yue had to be cautious with his abilities.

He stood up again and fetched a large bamboo basket from the kitchen, placing the fox pelt bundle inside before covering it with dried rations and fruits. Then, with nothing left to do, he gazed at the starry sky, silently waiting for dawn.

Moonlight and starlight bathed him, and he realized he could use the *Golden Light Flight Technique* to travel along the light's path into the heavens. But he knew that, at his current level, attempting such a feat would only leave him stranded in the void.

Fragmented memories from after his transmigration told him that safety lay to the east, beyond thousands of miles of rivers and mountains, in the lands where humans thrived.

Soon, the eastern horizon brightened with the first light of dawn. Han Yue shouldered the bamboo basket and knocked over an oil lamp nearby. The flame ignited the spilled oil, and the fire quickly spread.

Standing amidst the roaring flames, Han Yue looked up at the sky, where an eagle circled lazily.

A burst of golden light flashed—and Han Yue vanished.

In the next instant, he appeared beside the eagle, startling it into a frantic retreat. Suspended high in the sky, Han Yue gazed into the distance.

Before gravity could take hold, he transformed into a streak of golden light, speeding eastward.

Thus, Han Yue departed, leaving behind a city deep in demon territory—and a legend of a third-stage grand cultivator who wielded thunder, slaughtered a City Lord's household, and vanished into the light.
