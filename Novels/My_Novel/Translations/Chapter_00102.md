# Chapter 102: The Emerald Silk Hand, A Small Success

The author: Duōqíng Shíliú (Passionate Pomegranate)

At the village entrance.

Second-rank guard Zhou Yitong was sent to deliver a message.

He paced back and forth at the village entrance, shouting a few times before waiting in place. He knew that Black River Village was a poor and dangerous place and was unwilling to step inside.

He spat on the ground, thinking to himself that he would wait for another half-quarter of an hour. If no one came out by then, he would assume the man was dead. Then, that great opportunity would no longer be his.

It wasn't long before a figure approached.

"Oh, he's not dead yet."

Zhou Yitong was stunned. After not seeing him for so long, Li Xian seemed even more vigorous. His skin was fair, his stature tall and straight—not overly burly, nor did he appear thin. Yet, he gave off a sense of hidden power...

"Brother Li, long time no see! How have you been?" Zhou Yitong主动 approached with a smile, cupping his fist in greeting.

"Brother Zhou, long time no see! I'm doing well," Li Xian returned the gesture and asked, "Brother Zhou, you said the Madam summoned me back to the manor? Is there a specific matter?"

Zhou Yitong laughed. "Of course, it's a good thing, Li Xian. Let's talk on the way."

"Alright."

Li Xian called over Uncle Fu and gave him a few brief instructions before following Zhou Yitong back to the manor.

On the way, Zhou Yitong said, "This trip isn't just to summon you back. All the guards stationed outside have been called."

"You've only been in the manor for less than half a year, so you wouldn't know. Every three years, the Madam spends half a day giving pointers on martial arts to the guards."

"That's why you've been called back today."

Li Xian was delighted. "This is truly a great thing."

Although Li Xian possessed the [Heaven's Reward for Diligence] destiny, allowing him to make progress through hard practice, receiving guidance from a senior would bring many benefits.

"Yes, so hurry back."

"It's this afternoon."

Zhou Yitong urged impatiently.

In the One Union Manor.

Noon was nearly over. In a clearing in the manor, guards of all ranks—A, B, C, and D—had gathered.

The place was crowded, with many new faces among them.

Li Xian hurried back to the manor and walked to the front of the ranks. His B-rank guard token was conspicuous, and guards of other ranks made way for him out of respect.

"Since I started practicing martial arts, I've never received any guidance."

"The Four Directions Fist has reached its peak and no longer needs guidance. The Breeze Leg has also reached perfection. My Emerald Silk Hand has just reached proficiency. If the Madam gives me pointers, I'm sure to gain a great deal."

After waiting a bit longer.

The noisy environment fell silent instantly—the Madam had arrived.

The Madam's appearance was as before: dignified, gentle, and indescribably noble. She wore only a thin silk gauze dress that fully revealed her figure's curves.

Her long hair was coiled up and fixed with three hairpins, from which hung sparkling jade beads.

As she walked, the jade beads clicked together with a crisp sound.

"It's her."

Li Xian noticed another woman beside the Madam. She wore a fox-fur cloak, with red lips and beautiful brows. Lacking the Madam's experience, she seemed like a young flower, slightly inferior in grace, but she had the advantage of youth and charm.

She was precisely the woman he had met in the Pill Pavilion that day.

"She really is a guest at the manor," Li Xian thought to himself. "This woman's identity must be extraordinary."

The Madam took her seat. Qiuyue served her hot tea. The Madam took a small sip and raised her eyes slightly. Pang Long understood and said to the crowd, "Let's begin!"

A-rank guard Hua Hanying was ranked first and was naturally the first to step forward.

"Hanying, use your Fire Eagle Claw," Pang Long said with a smile.

"Alright!"

Huá Hanying focused his Qi and made his move. His hands shot forward, fingers curved into claws, the bones making a "cracking" sound. He first executed a move, "Eagle Pouncing on a Tiger," striking from high to low, as if an eagle's cry could be heard in the confusion.

He then followed with several sets of claw strikes, horizontal and vertical, full of killing intent and ferocious might.

All the guards gasped in admiration, and Pang Long nodded in satisfaction.

However, Li Xian frowned slightly. "Although I haven't practiced claw techniques, my fist techniques have reached their peak."

"There seems to be a trace of fist technique left in Hua Hanying's claw technique."

After a full performance.

The Madam raised her eyebrows slightly and said only one sentence: "Your Qi is not condensed, it scatters and your heart is restless, as if there are fist shadows." She then let Hua Hanying ponder it himself.

Li Xian was slightly pleased. The phrase "as if there were fist shadows" confirmed his suspicions.

For martial artists, combat experience is crucial. Knowing oneself and the enemy leads to a hundred victories.

Li Xian thought that this was a great opportunity to quickly accumulate martial arts knowledge. He watched the guards' moves more seriously than others, trying to analyze their strengths and weaknesses.

The Madam was sparing with her words but often got straight to the point.

For example, there was a B-rank guard who practiced the "Upright and Even Fist."

This fist technique was balanced and even, making it difficult to practice incorrectly. However, this guard had a blocked acupoint in his right leg, which obstructed the flow of his internal Qi. Although his skill in the fist technique had some accomplishment, his shoulders would inevitably swell with pain every time he practiced.

The Madam said, "Unblock the Sanyin acupoint and take hot medicine; it can be resolved."

She not only pointed out the flaw in his fist technique but also saw his old ailment. Her level of martial arts attainment made Li Xian admire her immensely.

On the path of martial arts, having a famous teacher to guide you is truly like taking a shortcut. Twice the result with half the effort!

Soon, it was Jiang Yun's turn.

She performed the "Emerald Silk Hand," but her palm technique took a yin-soft and entangled path. It was like a chaotic mess of threads, a tangled ball of string.

Her palms were fast, but they moved left and right erratically, appearing somewhat disorganized.

Li Xian took this in and secretly shook his head. This Jiang Yun had entered the Leisure Martial Pavilion to practice the "Emerald Silk Hand." But since she had limited access to the pavilion, what she remembered and learned was flawed.

The Madam was slightly surprised, glanced at Qiuyue, and then her expression returned to normal. After Jiang Yun finished her palm technique, the Madam said, "The Emerald Silk Hand was created by me personally. You have already learned it incorrectly, so there is no need to pursue it further. You should switch to another martial art."

"This..." Jiang Yun's face turned ugly.

She had put a great deal of effort into this palm technique; was she to just abandon it?

But since the Madam had spoken, how could she dare not comply?

After Jiang Yun, there were three B-rank guards before it was Li Xian's turn.

Pang Long nodded to him and said, "B-rank guard Li Xian, you may begin."

Li Xian shot out both palms, also performing the Emerald Silk Hand. The Madam let out a soft "eh," thinking to herself: "Another Emerald Silk Hand. Although this martial art is ordinary, it was created out of my own whim."

Upon closer inspection, although Li Xian's attainment in the Emerald Silk Hand was not as good as Jiang Yun's, it was not misguided. His palm technique had both slowness and speed, with the vastness of a rolling river and the subtlety of a trickling stream.

The Madam raised her eyebrows slightly and said, "It's rare. Your palm technique has no flaws."

She lightly pinched with her slender fingers and pulled a silk thread from Pang Long's clothes. With a gentle push of her palm wind, the silk thread fell into Li Xian's hand.

Li Xian focused his gaze and looked.

The silk thread had been tied into a complex, tight knot.

The Madam said no more, waving her hand to signal Li Xian to step down.

Li Xian held the silk ball, completely puzzled. For the other guards, whether their martial arts were good or bad, the Madam would always offer verbal guidance. For him alone, she only gave a ball of silk.

What did this mean?

"Could it be that the Madam's guidance is all contained within this ball of string?" Li Xian observed the string ball but couldn't see any reason for now.

He simply put it in his pocket.

He would study it slowly later.

Time flew by, and it was evening.

The Madam's instruction was over. Li Xian still had to return to his post and prepared to go back to Black River Village.

Pang Long saw him off specially. Li Xian asked, "Commander Pang, what do you think the Madam meant by this?"

He took out the ball of string.

"I don't know either," Pang Long shook his head and patted Li Xian's shoulder, reminding him, "After you return to Black River Village, be careful. Zheng Xuezhang was seriously injured and won't recover for several months, but his son is not weak."

Li Xian nodded and suddenly asked, "That's right, Commander Pang, have there been many casualties in the manor recently? I've seen quite a few new faces."

"You're quite observant," Pang Long said. "Originally, there should have been another half-year before the Madam's instruction. But there has been unrest in the county recently, so the Madam gave her guidance early to be able to close her doors and train in peace."

"There's unrest in the county?" Li Xian was taken aback.

Pang Long said, "Indeed. It seems a rebel army is stationed outside Qingning County. The situation is complicated, and I can't see the whole picture yet."

"Being stationed at Black River Village might not be a bad thing. After all, two B-rank guards have died recently. It's very unsafe."

Li Xian asked, "How does the Madam view this matter?" He wanted to judge the severity of the situation from the Madam's reaction.

But he didn't get his wish.

"The Madam is, of course, as usual," Pang Long said.

Li Xian returned by the light of the moon, his heart filled with emotion.

He could only say that in these troubled times, there can be no calm lake.

Only by cultivating martial arts like the Madam's can one be safe and secure.

Black River Village.

Between the small wooden houses in the west of the village.

Li Xian held the silk ball, unable to understand it from any angle. He thought, "Could it be a method for circulating Qi?"

He activated his Qi and tried to move it along the silk ball. However, the ball was complex, and the Qi moved erratically within his body, almost injuring him.

"Forget it, since I can't figure it out, I'll just use my own笨办法 (stupid method) and practice it over and over again!"

He immediately began practicing his palm technique. One time, two times... the wind from his palms roared. Suddenly, in a moment of enlightenment, Li Xian remembered the Madam pulling the silk thread from the clothes, her palm wind sending it forth, turning a long, thin thread into a ball of string...

"Could it be that she wants me to use my palm wind to untangle this ball of string!?"

Li Xian's heart pounded wildly. He took out the ball of string and threw it into the air.

The silk ball, like a goose feather, drifted down slowly. Li Xian shot out a palm, and the palm wind blew the ball away. "Not good!" Li Xian quickly jumped up and reached out to grab the silk ball.

The ground was covered in snow.

If it fell into the snow, even with heaven-high skills, Li Xian would find it impossible to find. He immediately returned to his room, and without the interference of snow, he tried practicing his martial art again.

"If the palm wind is too strong, it blows the ball away; if it's too light, the ball falls to the ground."

Li Xian used his palm wind to lift the silk ball. He controlled the force, making the palm wind just right to keep the silk ball suspended in the air without falling.

However, the silk ball was intricate. Even using one's fingers to pick and pull would be difficult to untangle, let alone a gust of palm wind?

"When the palm fans out, it inevitably creates wind. This palm wind can be strong or gentle, but how can it be used to untangle a tangled ball of string?"

Li Xian recalled the unique aspect of the Emerald Silk Hand. When a palm is struck, it simultaneously unleashes more than ten different types of internal Qi.

Treating the palm wind as an extension of the internal Qi, when a palm is struck, the Qi leaves the hand and transforms into a dozen or so nimble, fine winds, much like the complex undercurrents beneath the surface of water.

Perhaps this is the principle.

He immediately began experimenting.

[You have touched the诀窍 (key point) of the Emerald Silk Hand for the first time, Proficiency +12]

The results were indeed swift.

Li Xian was overjoyed and practiced even more diligently without rest.

[You have touched the窍门 (trick) of the Emerald Silk Hand for the first time, Proficiency +4]

Riding this momentum, Li Xian once again stayed up late to practice hard.

The next day, at noon.

The sun was a little fierce today, and the climate was warming up.

Calculating the days, it was the end of the twelfth month, and the first month was approaching.

The cold winter was more than half over.

The days to come would see a gradual warming.

Although Li Xian still hadn't untied the silk ball, his proficiency in the martial skill [Emerald Silk Hand] had broken through the bottleneck of Proficiency, advancing in one leap to the [Small Success] realm.

[Emerald Silk Hand]

[Proficiency: 124/6000 (Small Success)]

[Description: The Emerald Silk in the palm, with hidden secrets within. You received guidance from a senior, practiced your palm wind diligently, and touched upon the characteristics of "condensing Qi like silk" and "entangling silk like a rope" ahead of schedule.]

Li Xian sat cross-legged on the spot, his breath long and steady. All the late-night, hard practice was for this moment of breaking through.

He looked inward at his body, and his internal Qi grew continuously...

The Qi Lake surged and expanded, from twenty-two zhang, to twenty-three zhang... until it reached twenty-four zhang, where it finally showed signs of stopping.
