### Chapter Twelve: Fierce Bandits

"Quick reflexes, but your cultivation is too poor."

Jianlang glanced at Puliao, then turned to Chen Fei and Physician Song, a smile appearing on his face. "Hope I didn't scare you two. In extraordinary times like these, I had no choice but to offend you."

"Aren't you here for a consultation? What is all this...?" Physician Song looked at Jianlang and the two people who had emerged on the city wall, asking in a terrified voice.

Chen Fei frowned, scanning his surroundings for an escape route. But after a moment, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

There was no escape. All possible routes were subtly blocked by Jianlang. With Chen Fei's current strength, a forced breakout would likely yield no better results than Puliao's. Judging by Jianlang's actions just now, he was definitely a ruthless individual. This trip was truly dangerous.

"Indeed, it's for a consultation. It's just that this friend reacted too strongly, leaving me with no choice." Jianlang spread his hands. "Gentlemen, please."

Physician Song's hands and feet trembled slightly. He was just an ordinary doctor; when had he ever seen such a spectacle? Chen Fei stepped forward, supporting Physician Song as they walked towards the courtyard.

Jianlang tilted his head in Puliao's direction, and someone immediately came to help Puliao up, entering the courtyard with them.

Song Mu wiped the sweat from his forehead, a slight sigh of relief escaping his chest. The injuries of these individuals were mostly similar, caused by knife wounds, so the difficulty of treatment wasn't actually that great.

Any medical clinic in Pingyin County could probably treat these people. However, the identities of this group of people were likely illicit, making them dare not go into Pingyin County. They could only resort to such methods, tricking a few people to come and treat them.

"Doctor, your hands truly work miracles! On behalf of my brothers, I thank you!" Jianlang's face was now wreathed in smiles, showing no trace of his previous menacing demeanor.

"You flatter me," Song Mu waved his hand. "May we leave now?" Song Mu didn't even ask about the consultation fee; all he wanted now was to leave safely.

"Not so fast. There's one more person who needs treatment. Please follow me, both of you."

Jianlang walked forward. Song Mu glanced at Chen Fei and sighed inwardly. The matter wasn't over yet. Chen Fei remained silent, continuously evaluating the worst possible scenarios and preparing for an escape.

They arrived at the back courtyard, which had clearly been tidied up, appearing much cleaner and fresher. There were even servants bustling in and out; judging by their clothing, they seemed to be refugees.

"Big Brother, the doctor is here."

"So, you're saying you can't treat him now, is that right?!" The voice turned cold. They knew about healing pills, but after the previous battle, they had used up all their medicine. Send someone to buy them in Pingyin County?

Currently, the guards at Pingyin County's city gate were conducting extremely strict checks. Refugees couldn't enter, and it was very difficult for people of their unknown identity to get in. Moreover, the healing pills were only what Song Mu had suggested; whether they would actually be effective was also unknown.

Perhaps his medical skills weren't enough, and he was just using the lack of pills as an excuse. If that were the case, it would be better to simply kill him to prevent their whereabouts from being leaked.

"Let me think again, let me think again!" Song Mu's body trembled uncontrollably. The murderous intent of the surrounding individuals was no longer concealed. If his answer didn't satisfy them, a blade would likely fall the next moment.
