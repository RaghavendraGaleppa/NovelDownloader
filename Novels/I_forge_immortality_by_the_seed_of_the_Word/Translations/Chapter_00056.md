# Chapter 56: The Price Reduction Storm (Part 2)

"Welcome— Oh, it's you two?"

Inside the shop, Zhang Jing, who had been resting with his eyes closed, immediately opened them upon sensing someone's arrival, his face breaking into a perfectly standard smile. 

Unexpectedly, the figures before him were two familiar faces.

"Brother Zhang, is that really you?" Chu Lingyun and Deng An exclaimed in unison, their expressions instantly turning to shock.

The next moment, they exchanged glances, their eyes filled with astonishment. 

Before entering, they never could have imagined that the mysterious talisman shop causing such waves in the market would be owned by their former 'Brother Zhang'! This realization left them momentarily speechless.

After a long silence, Deng An swallowed hard and tentatively asked, "Brother Zhang, is this shop yours?"

Zhang Jing nodded with a smile.

It really was him! 

Deng An's heart pounded as his gaze swept over the dazzling array of talismans on the counter. He then stole a complex glance at Zhang Jing. 

So this is what a top-ten squad member is like? The difference truly is immense.

Recalling his earlier deductions, Deng An now understood—his Brother Zhang had, within just over a month of joining the squad, already befriended a senior talisman master. And judging by the situation, their relationship must be quite close. Otherwise...

His thoughts were interrupted as he remembered the sign at the entrance about exchanging demon cores for talismans. 

Deng An knew a thing or two about the uses of demon cores—they were typically materials for alchemists. And any alchemist capable of using demon cores in pill refinement must be highly skilled.

Meanwhile, Chu Lingyun quickly snapped out of her daze. Remembering her purpose for visiting, a charming smile bloomed on her face as she said softly, 

"Lingyun greets Brother Zhang. Who would have thought that after our parting, we'd meet again under such circumstances? The memory of our first encounter aboard the Qingxiao Spirit Crane remains vivid in my mind to this day."

Zhang Jing neither confirmed nor denied her words, simply asking with a smile, "Has Fairy Chu come to purchase talismans today?"

"Brother Zhang, are you aware that the other talisman shops in the market have all lowered their prices today?" Chu Lingyun asked instead of answering directly, her tone laced with concern.

"No matter. Let them lower their prices as they please," Zhang Jing replied, his expression unchanged.

Biting her lip lightly, Chu Lingyun ventured, "Brother Zhang, I noticed your sign mentions a 20% discount for talismans purchased with demon cores, valid for only three days. Has that offer expired today?"

At this, Zhang Jing's demeanor turned enthusiastic. "Fairy Chu wishes to exchange demon cores for talismans?"

Chu Lingyun nodded frankly. "At my elder cousin's request, I'd like to exchange some low-grade demon cores for a batch of lower-grade talismans at your discounted rate."

"That can be arranged," Zhang Jing agreed.

"There's more," Chu Lingyun added with slight hesitation. "We plan to make several more exchanges in the future. Could we continue using this discounted rate then? Brother Zhang, considering we hail from the same province, might you make an exception?"

Her eyes held a pleading glimmer.

"Since Fairy Chu asks, of course it's no problem," Zhang Jing assured with a smile.

The three-day limit was merely a gimmick—he'd always accept demon cores regardless. After all, one should never turn their nose up at merit points.

Watching Zhang Jing make this decision so effortlessly left Chu Lingyun astonished. She thought to herself, "Brother Zhang must have an extraordinary relationship with that talisman master behind him." Clearly, she'd fallen into the same mistaken assumption as Deng An.

After completing their transaction, Chu Lingyun departed gracefully with Deng An in tow.

Behind them, Zhang Jing calmly examined the fifteen demon cores in his hand. "Several more batches, you say? Pity they're all from early Qi Refinement demonic creatures." 

The urgency to produce mid-grade talismans had become undeniable. Zhang Jing knew that the stronger squad members likely hoarded numerous mid-Qi Refinement demon cores—they simply disdained his lower-grade talismans.

As for the market-wide price reduction Chu Lingyun mentioned...

Zhang Jing shook his head. He'd learned of this development early that morning but chose not to react, treating it as mere entertainment. 

For one, the competitors' discounts paled in comparison to his demon core exchange rate, leaving his collection efforts unaffected. 

Secondly, Zhang Jing saw no need to join the price war. His current prices were barely above the Luo Du Squad's buyback rate. Rather than lowering prices, he might as well sell everything directly to the squad—far more convenient than retail.

In fact, the other talisman masters' actions suited him perfectly. With fewer customers buying with merit points, he could devote the saved time to producing—no, printing—more talismans.

With these thoughts, Zhang Jing slowly turned, his profound gaze seemingly piercing through walls to survey the competing talisman shops.

"This level is just right. I hope our senior brothers know when to stop, lest they bring misfortune upon themselves," his murmur echoed eerily through the shop.

As the sun dipped below the western mountains, painting the sky in twilight hues, Shuangfeng Street remained bustling with cultivators, the air thick with noise and activity.

Creak—

Despite it being prime business hours, Zhang Jing gently closed his shop door and vanished into the crowd without even locking up—not that it mattered. All valuables resided safely in his storage space, and he'd casually set up a spiritual barrier within the shop.

Meanwhile, in a small palace within Langya Prefecture...

Several elderly men sat facing each other, their expressions relaxed. Below them sat four or five young men, equally at ease.

"What a dramatic turn of events today," one elder chuckled.

"Indeed! Those junior brothers were actually forced to lower prices by some unknown new talisman master. Someone even came complaining to my residence last night—tsk!"

"Quite peculiar. Who exactly is this junior brother?"

"Completely under the radar, as if he emerged from a rock crevice."

As they spoke, another elder produced a Blazing Sun Talisman, examining it closely before sighing in admiration: "Exquisitely drawn. At least in lower-grade talismans, I pale in comparison."

Noticing this, Senior Brother Yan, who'd been listening quietly, suddenly wore a strange expression. "Everyone, I've been secluded crafting talismans and only emerged today. Might this mysterious talisman master you speak of have a shop on Shuangfeng Street, next to Senior Brother He's Elixir Pavilion?"

"That's the one! We've been speculating about his identity."

"Gentlemen," Senior Brother Yan took a deep breath, "no need for speculation. That's Junior Brother Zhang from our Luo Du Squad—he only joined the academy this year. It's natural you wouldn't know him."

The palace fell silent.

After a pause, someone asked incredulously, "Senior Brother Yan, you're certain he joined this year?"

Senior Brother Yan nodded, his own eyes reflecting astonishment. 

"He's from the same cohort as those two freaks? With his talisman-crafting talent, he might not be far behind them."

"When this matter concludes, the Inner Court's Thousand Methods Pavilion will surely take action," another elder remarked, unable to hide his envy.

Then, with a peculiar look at Senior Brother Yan, he added: 

"Senior Brother, your three squads truly are inseparable. Those two freaks made quite a name for themselves on the Langya battlefield. We thought Luo Du might fall behind this time, but turns out your ace was hidden here all along!"
