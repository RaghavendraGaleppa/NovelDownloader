# Chapter 244: To Retrieve the Star You Wished Upon (Part 1/2)

The stream babbled softly.

There were quite a few men and women around the Magpie Bridge, engaging in friendly and pure emotional exchanges. The customs in Yunzhou were open-minded; holding hands, hugging, or even kissing was understandable.

So, what was so unreasonable about rubbing her small feet?

At least, that was what Li Mo thought.

Besides, he had a strange disease.

She was an ice maiden with a heart of understanding today, so she would surely understand him. The slight trembling of her little feet, especially when he touched her soles, was proof of that.

The ice maiden was also more talkative today, though still not as much as Li Mo.

Li Mo spoke of what happened at the Sword Pavilion, of their childhood, the problems he encountered while observing the Divine Will and tempering his body recently, and the interesting things brought about by the mystery of the womb.

As everyone knows.

The ice maiden almost had no sense of humor.

But from beginning to end, the curve of her lips never disappeared as she quietly listened to the youth's words.

"Didn't you say there would be fireworks? Why haven't they started yet?"

After a while, Li Mo held her warm, soft hand and looked up at the sky, murmuring, "If we could see the fireworks, the trip to Yunzhou would be truly perfect."

"If..."

Her toes, like cardamom, curled slightly. Ying Bing subconsciously wanted to tuck the hair by her ear but realized she was wearing a jade hairpin, so it wasn't necessary.

"If what?"

"Nothing, look."

She didn't reply, her gaze fixed on the distance.

If... this could continue forever.

Actually, without turning back, Li Mo could already see the shimmering light in her eyes.

A rose-red firework shot into the night sky, exploding with a 'bang' into a sky full of sparks, only to be quickly submerged by subsequent fireworks.

Under the night sky of Yunzhou City, a shower of stars rained down, dyeing the layers of clouds into crimson琉璃 (lapis lazuli), reflecting the grand spectacle of the mortal world.

"These fireworks are really bright."

The fireworks in Yunzhou were of higher quality than Li Mo had imagined, not inferior to the ones he saw in his previous life.

With this sudden brightness, what was happening in the darkness became even more obvious.

Let's just say, the young people of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are quite passionate and unrestrained.

Taking advantage of the fireworks, they were kissing and hugging each other.

If Senior Brother Ouyang or Brother Murong saw this, they would surely be very surprised. Yunzhou City actually had so many hidden demon beasts? And they were openly succumbing to their animal instincts!

They were even biting people. Was there no one to manage this?

Li Mo curled the corner of his mouth; he felt a bit like biting something too.

Ying Bing felt the force on her foot increase. She glanced sideways at the youth's lips, her fingers curled for a moment, before looking up at the sky again.

*Is this how pigs run?*

But this is a bit...

"Li Mo, close your eyes," Ying Bing said softly, her lips parting.

"!" Li Mo's body trembled.

"What for?"

"I won't tell you for now."

Li Mo's mind went blank for a moment before he closed his eyes. Before closing them, he vaguely saw the smile on the girl's lips.

Then the warmth in his palm was gone, leaving a sudden emptiness.

A rustling sound was heard; probably the ice maiden standing up?

A faint, subtle fragrance suddenly appeared at the tip of his nose; she was getting closer...

A cool touch came to his wrist; she was holding his hand... Li Mo felt as if his heart was about to leap out of his chest.

But it wasn't as he had imagined.

The expected touch didn't happen.

"You can open your eyes now."

"Okay."

Li Mo opened his eyes and saw a red thread tied around his wrist.

It was the one Ying Bing used to tie her hair.

"Happy Autumn Festival," Ying Bing said softly.

"Uh... Happy Autumn Festival," Li Mo spun the red thread, no longer looking at the jade-like lips not far away.

What was he thinking just now?

Although the ice maiden wasn't as cold and distant as before, she definitely wouldn't take the initiative to kiss him.

That would be science fiction, pure science fiction.

---

Besides, this was just the beginning. Usually, such things are done by boys...

*Bang—*

Suddenly, a bright orange light from the south pierced the sky, turning the night into day instantly.

It was probably not just Yunzhou; it could be seen clearly from even farther away.

"What kind of fireworks are these, so bright? And... why are they falling from the sky?"

Li Mo couldn't help but be stunned.

Wait.

This isn't fireworks at all, it's a shooting star!

But no shooting star is this bright.

The slender hand holding his wrist suddenly tightened. Li Mo saw the smile gradually fade from Ying Bing's jade-like face.

She gazed at the shooting star falling towards the southern border.

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly, and she sighed softly in her heart.

"The fireworks are almost gone."

"Yeah, let's go back. My socks..."

"I don't know?"

Seeing the youth's bewildered expression, Ying Bing's gaze was calm, her eyes looking vaguely towards Li Mo's pocket.

Li Mo reached in and felt around, his face showing surprise.

"Huh? When did your silk socks run into my pocket? I get it, it must be a habit from the full-service package. I must have developed a professional disease."

"..."

"As compensation, I'll put them on for you."

Li Mo was mainly driven by curiosity.

After putting on Ying Bing's shoes and socks, the two returned to the tavern by the Fish Dragon Lake.

The tavern was quiet; everyone was probably still playing outside. Only Murong Xiao sat there, silent.

"..."

Seeing the two return hand in hand, Murong Xiao's eyebrows moved imperceptibly.

His expression seemed to have become even more sorrowful.

The two went to the roof of the tavern.

At this moment.

The shooting star had not yet disappeared. Standing higher, one could better observe the faint fluctuations of the Divine Will.

It didn't look like a shooting star anymore; it was more like a divine bird descending towards the south.

Li Mo closed his eyes again.

It wasn't that he particularly believed in those mysterious things.

Shooting stars were rare to see in a lifetime; a sense of ceremony was still necessary.

"Li Mo?"

"Haha, I just made a wish."

"That's not a shooting star..."

Ying Bing didn't finish the sentence, then asked softly, "What wish did you make?"

The youth smiled brightly: "I hope the days ahead will be safe and smooth, that everyone in the Clear Abyss Sect, and you... will be happy every day."

"..."

Peace and happiness.

This was the greatest wish in everyone's heart, but also the most difficult thing to achieve in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Accidents and tomorrow, one never knows which comes first.

Although they are considered outstanding among their peers, they are still too insignificant when looking at the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Currently, they wouldn't be able to change much about the future crises and survival of the Clear Abyss Sect.

She had tasted the wandering life after the fall of the Clear Abyss Sect.

"In a couple of days, you will return to Ziyang Mansion with the elders first. I need to go to the southern border; it won't be too long. Don't fall behind in your progress."

"The southern border? What are you going there for?"

"To retrieve the shooting star you wished upon."

Ying Bing's voice was clear and melodious. As she watched the starlight completely disappear, she felt the youth's hand was warm.

She turned back and smiled, her eyes still bright.

PS: These few chapters are quite difficult to write. I need to lay the groundwork for the later plot, as well as the changes in character relationships and character growth.

I've expended a lot of energy, and continuing to write would affect the quality. The chapter for midnight will be posted tomorrow.

Please, esteemed viewers, give me some support. Orz.
