# Chapter 143: Slapping Her Face Repeatedly

"Princess Guo!"

The sight of the woman in the blue palace dress instantly brought back a flood of memories for Lin Shan. As the saying goes, enemies meeting see nothing but red.

This woman had ambushed him repeatedly by that mountain stream in the Yan Yun mountain range, pretended to reconcile with him at Yi Chuan Market only to deceive him, and twisted the truth to slander him in the Great Song capital. 

Had it not been for the timely appearance of his clansman Lin Fan that night, he would have been forced to use his enhancement ability and fight the Great Song royal family's Foundation Establishment elder to the death.

Time and again, this woman had schemed against him, yet each time Lin Shan had soundly defeated her. Yet she always managed to escape unscathed, only to return with renewed vigor!

Not only was she as venomous as an icy beauty snake, but also as slippery as a rabbit.

What truly baffled Lin Shan was how Princess Guo had later received royal family resources to break through to late Qi Refining stage, joined an orthodox sect, and now had even reached Foundation Establishment like him!

How many years had it been? Her breakthrough had dramatically increased her lifespan, completely restoring her youthful appearance.

Lin Shan's heart trembled.

This woman must not be allowed to live!

Having experienced Princess Guo's ruthless schemes and her unfathomable cultivation talent, Lin Shan's killing intent surged.

Now that fate had brought them together again, he would settle old and new grudges alike—rooting out the problem once and for all!

Having silently made his resolution, Lin Shan didn't hesitate. He immediately activated his Black Iron Sword, sending it streaking toward her like a swimming dragon.

The palace-dressed maiden, locked in combat with Luan Chun, seemed oblivious until a blue jade pendant on her person suddenly activated. A mirror surface adorned with intricate ice patterns materialized in midair, effortlessly blocking the flying sword.

"Ding ding ding ding—"

After over a dozen strikes, the ice mirror remained unscathed, without even a scratch. Lin Shan was dumbfounded.

What kind of pendant was that? It could instantly cast a high-level spell, automatically protect its owner, and sustain it indefinitely?

Princess Guo, startled by the sudden attack, glanced over with a frown. A white-robed youth was glaring at her with gritted teeth, his expression so full of hatred that an outsider might mistake it for love turned to bitter resentment.

"Lin Shan?!"

As the bane of her existence, someone she schemed against day and night, how could she not recognize him?

She wasn't surprised that Lin Shan had reached Foundation Establishment and regained his youthful appearance—many had witnessed his breakthrough at Yi Chuan Market, and Princess Guo had naturally gathered that intelligence.

Over the years, Lin Shan's disappearance had left her searching fruitlessly like looking for a needle in a haystack. She'd lived in constant fear that he might be secluded in some remote mountains, cultivating in isolation.

After all, in her memory, Lin Shan's cultivation talent was frighteningly high.

Now that he'd suddenly reappeared before her, while she was initially shocked, joy quickly replaced her surprise.

"You dare show yourself before me, boy? Once I deal with this little girl, I'll take my time dealing with you!"

Princess Guo intensified her assault, gradually overwhelming Luan Chun, while flashing a smile so devastating it could topple cities.

Her tone suggested complete confidence, as if Lin Shan were nothing more than an easy target.

Lin Shan's heart inexplicably skipped a beat at that breathtaking smile. Even as enemies, he couldn't deny her allure, especially now that she'd regained her youthful beauty. But hearing her boast about "dealing with" him nearly made him laugh in anger.

So arrogant! Where does she get the confidence?

Does she think she's Lin Fan? I wouldn't even back down from the "Child of Fortune" himself!

"Ding ding ding—"

The clashing of metal continued as Lin Shan's high-grade flying sword relentlessly hacked away. The blue pendant on Princess Guo shimmered, the ice mirror before her standing firm, snowflakes swirling within its layers.

"Save your energy. This pendant is a Talisman Treasure, an opportunity I gained during my travels."

"It contains a high-level spell sealed by a Golden Core cultivator—the Ten Thousand Blossoms Ice Mirror."

"You'll never break through. Just wash your neck and wait for death!"

Princess Guo taunted Lin Shan leisurely while maneuvering a pair of Mandarin Duck Axes around Luan Chun with deadly precision.

Meanwhile, Luan Chun was proving utterly incompetent. Despite being the personal disciple of Golden Core Elder Yan, her combat experience was pitiful.

She was using a perfectly good illusionary silk handkerchief as a shield, wildly swinging a whip-like magical instrument that failed to block attacks and nearly hit herself instead. The spectacle was painful to watch.

Hearing "Talisman Treasure," Lin Shan ceased his futile efforts. Such items were legendary—rarely seen though often heard about.

He'd only heard of them before—artifacts combining talismans and magical treasures, crafted exclusively by Golden Core cultivators proficient in both talisman-making and artifact-forging.

Legends spoke of two hybrid products: "Talisman Artifacts" and "Talisman Treasures."

"Talisman Artifacts" used talismans to control magical instruments, like the "Talisman Sword" once used by the brocade-robed middle-aged man.

"Talisman Treasures" inverted this, using magical instruments to control talismans. While ordinary cultivators could only seal spells within talismans, "Talisman Treasures" could also seal spells.

The advantage was automatic activation—unlike talismans requiring manual triggering—and unlimited usage, unlike limited-use talismans.

Princess Guo's pendant contained a high-level defensive spell personally sealed by a Golden Core cultivator—the ice-element Ten Thousand Blossoms Ice Mirror.

As long as she had sufficient ice spiritual power, the Talisman Treasure would passively maintain this defensive spell indefinitely, making her virtually invincible. Lin Shan had no idea how she'd obtained such an item.

His expression turned grave, though he was relieved it wasn't a minor divine ability spell—otherwise he'd have fled immediately.

Retrieving his summoning banner, Lin Shan opted not to call his Qi Refining subordinates, leaving them to their skirmishes with the orthodox sect's disciples.

Instead, he summoned the "Water Bear Chieftain" he'd subdued six months ago in the East Sea's Tempest Region.

High-level defensive spells were formidable, especially when paired with a high-grade Talisman Treasure for sustained power. But could it withstand a relentless physical assault? Could it hold against his minion's brute strength?

"ROAR!"

A three-meter-tall water bear emerged from the vortex, its Foundation Establishment peak aura startling both combatants. Princess Guo and Luan Chun hastily disengaged, staring warily at the sudden appearance.

The Water Bear Chieftain tilted its head arrogantly at Lin Shan.

"See her? Beat her to a pulp!"

Though reluctant, bound by their contract, the bear had no choice. It beat its chest with a roar before charging at Princess Guo's Ten Thousand Blossoms Ice Mirror.

"WHAM!"

"WHAM!"

"WHAM!"

Initially, the ice mirror held firm. But under the bear's overwhelming blows, Princess Guo's face progressively paled.

Compared to Lin Shan's sword's ineffectual scratches, who could endure this beast's devastating punches? The passive defense spell drained her spiritual power like a bursting dam.

As cracks spiderwebbed across the ice mirror, Princess Guo's composure shattered along with it. Gone was her earlier confidence in handling Lin Shan.

A Foundation Establishment peak beast—how had a mere early Foundation Establishment cultivator tamed such a creature?

Lin Shan smirked. This bear had been trapped by Black Skeleton Demon Lord's three great formations, requiring tremendous effort to bind with a contract. If nothing else, its brute strength could even overwhelm his Cloud Copper Heart Mirror—what hope did a mere defensive spell have?

After all, human power had limits, and every spell had its breaking point.

The Water Bear Chieftain attacked relentlessly. A dozen "Bear Dominates the World" strikes later, the blue pendant on Princess Guo's person cracked audibly, fissures spreading across its surface. The Ten Thousand Blossoms Ice Mirror exploded into icy shards.

"ROAR!"

The bear roared skyward, then tilted its head to give Lin Shan that same arrogant sidelong glance.

Lin Shan responded with an enthusiastic thumbs-up.

Nearby, Luan Chun watched with barely concealed envy, already planning to ask Elder Yan to capture one for her. Only beauties deserved such beasts—what right did this guy have?

Though her Talisman Treasure was nearly destroyed, Princess Guo used the respite to release a "Spirit Crane" from the beast ring on her wrist.

Unlike Lin Shan's immediate control, this crane, though domesticated, remained unruly. Only after feeding it several spirit beast pills did she barely calm it down.

Stroking the crane's neck feathers while using Beast Taming Arts, her palms grew sweaty with tension. Finally establishing sufficient rapport, she pointed at the Water Bear Chieftain, and the crane strode forth.

"SCREECH—"

"ROAR—"

After a brief, mutually unintelligible exchange, the two beasts clashed at their masters' urgings. Unlike human cultivators, their battle was pure primal ferocity.

The wind-attributed Foundation Establishment Spirit Crane unleashed gale-force winds from its beak, countless feathers shooting like arrows in the tempest.

The Water Bear Chieftain roared back, summoning a barrage of water spears while using its massive paws to block. But their differences quickly became apparent.

Though not at the peak of Foundation Establishment like the bear, the crane's wind attributes granted it superior speed. The aquatic bear floundered in the air, its brute strength useless if it couldn't land a hit.

Seeing this, Lin Shan tossed out his "Cloud Descending Banner."

The large banner unfurled midair, swiftly positioning itself beneath the bear, carrying it in rapid pursuit of the crane.

Delighted, the bear gave chase and began pummeling its foe!

Meanwhile, Lin Shan whispered instructions to Luan Chun before sending his Black Iron Sword streaking toward Princess Guo.

Unlike the inexperienced Luan Chun, though Lin Shan hadn't learned proper "Sword Control Arts," his flying sword maneuvers were dazzlingly unpredictable. Princess Guo's Mandarin Duck Axes struggled to keep up.

Her pride refusing to admit defeat, Princess Guo began chanting while manipulating objects with her spiritual sense. Blue ice spiritual power coalesced before her, forming a three-meter-long ice serpent that swayed menacingly, its lantern-sized eyes gleaming with murderous intent.

In the cultivation world, higher-level spells grew increasingly rare. Market-available ones were common goods, while true treasures were closely guarded by major factions.

Ice-element spells, being particularly niche, were especially scarce among ordinary sects.

Princess Guo had clearly gained significant opportunities during her travels—not just breaking through to Foundation Establishment, but also obtaining ice-element techniques and Talisman Treasures. Mastering a few ice spells was hardly surprising.

As the terrifying ice serpent flicked its forked tongue, scattering ice shards with each tail movement, Luan Chun—about to intervene—gasped and recoiled, her usual domineering demeanor gone.

Lin Shan shot her a disappointed glare before producing his Five Elements Spirit Fan. The five differently colored feathers on the fan each flashed before the spiritual power settled on the crimson one. A fiery phoenix soared skyward.

Renowned throughout the cultivation world, the Five Elements Spirit Fan was famed for automatically selecting advantageous elemental counters. The fire phoenix's emergence perfectly countered both the ice serpent's element and serpentine form, nearly making Princess Guo spit blood in frustration.

With her flying axes barely fending off Lin Shan's sword and her spell at a disadvantage, Princess Guo resorted to throwing out puppets.

Dozens of nimble pangolin puppets emerged, firing multicolored beams from their mouths at Lin Shan.

He responded with a cold laugh, enlarging a bronze mirror to block all attacks.

Then he scattered a handful of beans, which grew into towering tree-men that charged forth, smashing the pangolin puppets to pieces.

Now Princess Guo panicked in earnest.

Moments ago, she'd been confidently toying with Luan Chun while taunting Lin Shan to await death. Now, facing actual combat, her defenses crumbled on all fronts.

Her last hope rested on her spirit beast, only to find her crane completely plucked bare, being chased and beaten by the enemy's Water Bear Chieftain riding the high-grade flying artifact Cloud Descending Banner.

The crane seemed to protest: It's not that I'm weak—the enemy jungler started with a major item! How am I supposed to fight that?

Luan Chun watched excitedly from the sidelines, cheering and waving her fists as if she were the one fighting, completely forgetting her earlier drubbing.

Lin Shan advanced steadily, controlling his flying sword with spiritual sense while fanning flames with his Five Elements Spirit Fan, relentlessly pressuring Princess Guo.

Simultaneously, he remotely directed the Cloud Descending Banner's aerial maneuvers, the Foundation Establishment peak "Flying Bear" proving unstoppable.

The featherless crane flapped desperately—not that it could flee, constrained by the control ring's restrictions from the woman below.

In a moment of distraction, Lin Shan tossed a dark object its way. Before it could identify the projectile, a rope coiled around it like a living serpent.

The "Beast Binding Lasso" tightened relentlessly, leaving the crane gasping before it plummeted from the sky.

Fortunately, as a spirit beast with some physical resilience, the dozens-meter fall only dazed it slightly. But the dim-witted bear, seeing an opportunity, leaped from the banner to land squarely on the crane, raining down slaps with its massive paws.

"SMACK! SMACK! SMACK! SMACK!"

The resounding slaps echoed across the battlefield. Lin Shan didn't need to watch—the sound alone conveyed the pain.

Luan Chun covered her face, unable to bear the sight. Princess Guo felt each blow as if striking her own face—a brutal rebuttal to her earlier arrogance.

Five breaths later, the bear tossed aside the lifeless crane. Holding the Beast Binding Lasso in one paw and the Cloud Descending Banner in the other, it stood triumphantly, once again giving Lin Shan that sidelong arrogant look.

It promptly earned a kick.

Lin Shan sent the stupid bear tumbling. What's there to be proud of when a fully-equipped tank beats a naked squishy?

That wasn't even the main issue—he'd intended to capture the Foundation Establishment spirit beast alive. Even if unusable, it would fetch a high price at market. Now it was dead because of this idiot. How infuriating!

Princess Guo was even angrier, her heart turning ice-cold—because the crane wasn't even hers to begin with.

She'd borrowed it!

When she returned to the Cang Xuan Sect, how would she explain its death to the Golden Core elder who'd lent it? But present survival took precedence over future explanations as Lin Shan closed in.

Princess Guo had exhausted all her means, reaching her absolute limit.

Now she looked utterly pitiful, her robes torn by sword strikes revealing glimpses of fair skin, subtle春光 (spring scenery—a euphemism for exposed flesh) peeking through.

Her tear-filled phoenix eyes, trembling crimson lips, and the momentary vulnerability of melted ice moved most men to pity.

Even Luan Chun felt sympathy stir, thinking it a shame to kill such a peerless beauty—both icy and alluring.

But Lin Shan remained unmoved, advancing steadily as his bean-soldier tree-men sealed all escape routes.

Today, this woman would die by his sword!
