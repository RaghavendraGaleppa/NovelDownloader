# Chapter 11: Someone, Serve Young Master Han Some Pie!  

"Brother Lin, this..." Han Li looked at Lin Yun in surprise as he witnessed the internal conflict between the two.  

From a young age, Han Li had been adept at reading people and was extremely clever. He knew the female cultivator hadn't intervened for his sake—otherwise, he wouldn't have been sent flying earlier. Clearly, it was because of the man beside him—Brother Lin.  

"Return the item," Chen Qiaoqian commanded coldly.  

"Junior Sister Chen! That rogue cultivator you met outside back then was him, wasn't it?!" Lu Yunfeng asked indignantly. "What's so great about him?!"  

"My Darkwater Sword won't ask a second time!" Chen Qiaoqian's delicate face turned icy as the blade pressed against Lu Yunfeng's skin, drawing a drop of blood that slid down the sword and dripped into the dirt.  

"Madwoman! Absolutely unreasonable!"  

The pain at his neck frightened him. He didn't want to risk his life over a rogue cultivator—he still had a bright future ahead. With a wave of his hand, he tossed the damaged magic treasure fragment to Lin Yun.  

Seeing this, Chen Qiaoqian withdrew her dark blue sword, unable to meet Lin Yun's gaze, and turned to leave.  

"How's the Darkwater Sword treating you?"  

Chen Qiaoqian, who had been about to leave, froze at the familiar voice. Her face darkened with sorrow as she bit her lip, thinking, *I'm sorry, Brother Lin... I can't drag you into this.*  

After silently apologizing, she suppressed her tears and walked away without looking back.  

Lu Yunfeng, meanwhile, glared at Lin Yun, engraving the man's face into his memory. *I'll tear this bastard to pieces!* Then he followed Chen Qiaoqian and left.  

"Did it really end just like that?!" All the rogue cultivators present turned their gazes to Lin Yun.  

"Who would've thought this guy had ties to that powerful female cultivator? No wonder he dared to step forward!"  

"Damn, I'm so jealous!"  

The pink-robed female cultivator glanced at the retreating figures of Chen Qiaoqian and Lu Yunfeng before turning her attention back to Lin Yun. "The Darkwater Sword, huh?"  

"Interesting. Seems like there's history between those two. How amusing."  

With the spectacle over, the onlookers dispersed.  

Han Li looked at Lin Yun, opening his mouth as if to say something, but ultimately remained silent.  

After the incident, Han Li no longer had the mood to continue browsing for a talisman brush. Although he had taken plenty of healing pills earlier, they had only stabilized his injuries—he still needed to return and properly recuperate.  

"Brother Lin, let's head back."  

---  

Han Li had assumed Lin Yun would feel the same way, but to his surprise, he saw Lin Yun eyeing the sweet-looking young female vendor.  

*What's going on with Brother Lin? Didn't he just have some deep connection with that female cultivator? How is he already exchanging glances with this girl?*  

Han Li was utterly baffled.  

If Lin Yun knew what Han Li was thinking, he would have shouted, *Slander! Absolute slander!*  

In truth, there was nothing between him and Chen Qiaoqian.  

Back when he had first met her, she was being ambushed by demonic cultivators. He had intervened to befriend her, hoping to raise her favorability and gain some rewards.  

After all, before her, he had only encountered dirt-poor rogue cultivators. Chen Qiaoqian was a rare opportunity—easy to impress (and exploit).  

*Might as well take full advantage—strip her clean!*  

His cultivation pills, his Greenwood Robe, his Flowing Cloud Boots, and even his Crimson Rainbow Sword Talisman had all been rewards from her.  

But what Lin Yun hadn't expected was that Chen Qiaoqian was like dry tinder when it came to emotions—one spark was enough to ignite her.  

It made Lin Yun seem like some heartless scoundrel, but he *wasn't*!  

He just wanted to give all the beauties of the world a shoulder to lean on—to offer warmth to those lovely ladies with nowhere else to turn!  

Besides, at the time, Lin Yun had been too preoccupied with the cultivation issues caused by his *False Yin-Yang Five Elements True Body* to bother with romance.  

Just as things were about to spiral out of control, the Chen family had arrived to take Chen Qiaoqian away, giving Lin Yun a much-needed reprieve.  

As for the Darkwater Sword, Lin Yun had given it to her as compensation, feeling guilty for leading her on. But she had completely misunderstood!  

*This is all the system's fault! If it had told me earlier about the conditions for the False Yin-Yang Five Elements True Body, I wouldn't have pretended to be so noble—I'd have gone for it!*  

*Why is he staring at me like that? Doesn't he have a thing with that female cultivator?* The young vendor blushed, lowering her head in embarrassment under Lin Yun's gaze.  

"Hello, I see your stall specializes in talisman-related items. Do you happen to have a talisman brush and cinnabar for sale?" Lin Yun asked politely.  

"Huh? Oh, you want a talisman brush and cinnabar?" The sweet-faced girl's expression dimmed slightly with disappointment.  

"You don't have any? That's a shame." Misinterpreting her reaction, Lin Yun prepared to leave with Han Li.  

---  

"Brother Lin, wait!" The girl hurriedly called out to him. "My name is Han Yunzhi. Thank you for helping me earlier—if that guy had kept causing trouble, I wouldn't have been able to sell anything."  

"Brother Lin, I *do* have brushes!"  

She then handed Lin Yun a wooden box.  

Lin Yun took it, giving her a puzzled look. *Why didn't you just say so earlier? Why tell me your name first before handing it over?*  

*Weird.*  

Opening the box, he found a golden brush emitting a faint yellow glow from tip to shaft.  

"This is the *Golden Bamboo Brush*. The bristles are made from the neck fur of a second-tier Golden-Eyed Ape, while the shaft is forged from a mix of gold essence and black iron. A Foundation Establishment cultivator then refined it for three days and nights with alternating spiritual and mortal flames before it was complete."  

Han Yunzhi spoke softly, her eyes lingering on the brush with reluctance.  

Lin Yun examined it—the shaft was smooth, with the characters *"Golden Bamboo"* engraved at the base.  

"I'll take it," Lin Yun nodded.  

"No need for payment, Brother Lin. Consider it a gift for helping me earlier—let's be friends." Han Yunzhi tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear.  

Han Li, standing to the side, was dumbfounded. *Why don't girls ever approach me like that?*  

*If I were as handsome as Brother Lin, maybe someone would take the initiative too...*  

*But that'll probably never happen.* Shaking off his self-deprecating thoughts, he steeled himself. *Focus on cultivation! Compared to the path of immortality, fleeting beauty means nothing!*  

**[Ding! Han Yunzhi has sent you a friend request. Accept?]**  

*Han Yunzhi... Her Han family is a branch of the Beast Taming Sect's Han Clan, and she supposedly has a direct ancestor in the Beast Taming Sect.* Lin Yun quickly reviewed her background.  

**[Accept.]**  

**[Ding! Han Yunzhi has been added as a friend. Current Favorability: 60.]**  

**[Ding! You have obtained two reward draws from Han Yunzhi. Proceed?]**  

**[Draw.]**  

**[Ding! Drawing in progress...]**  

**[Ding! Congratulations! You have obtained the Beast Taming Sect's Insect Rearing Secret Technique.]**  

**[Item Description: A closely guarded secret passed down for millennia within the Beast Taming Sect.]**  

**[Ding! Congratulations! You have obtained the Beast Taming Sect's Insect Control Art.]**  

**[Item Description: A perfected secret technique refined over ten thousand years by the Beast Taming Sect.]**  

Lin Yun processed the system notifications instantly before nodding, waving goodbye to Han Yunzhi, and returning to the pavilion with Han Li.  

Back home, Lin Yun handed the Golden Bamboo Brush and the damaged magic treasure fragment to Han Li.  

Han Li, however, hastily declined.  

Seeing this, Lin Yun feigned anger. "Brother Han, is our bond so shallow that a mere brush and fragment can measure it?"  

*If you don't take it, how am I supposed to get rewards?!*  

"Someone, serve Young Master Han some pie!"
