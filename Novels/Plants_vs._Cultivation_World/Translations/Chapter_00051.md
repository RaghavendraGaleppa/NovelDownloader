# Chapter 51: Inner Sect Attendants  

"Really?"  

Chu Feifei's heart raced with excitement when Gu Mo offered Water Spirit Rice as payment. This was something even spirit stones couldn't buy easily. Apart from exchanging a small amount with sect contribution points, there were virtually no other ways to obtain it.  

The Water Spirit Rice produced by the Spiritual Plant Hall was almost entirely reserved for inner sect disciples, leaving none for the outer sect disciples, let alone the servant disciples. Even outer sect disciples found it difficult to acquire without connections.  

"Of course!"  

Gu Mo nodded. While Water Spirit Rice was considered precious by others, it meant little to him. He didn't need it to boost his cultivation, and as for its effects of nourishing meridians and physique—could it possibly compare to the perfected-level Cleansing Technique?  

At most, he'd keep some to taste.  

With Gu Mo's promise secured, Chu Feifei immediately retrieved the formation disk buried in the spirit field. She then took out various tools and began repairing it for Gu Mo with utmost focus.  

Meanwhile, Yao Shifeng returned to the Mission Hall of the Talisman Peak.  

"Senior Brother Yao!"  

As soon as he arrived, several servant disciples greeted him warmly. If Gu Mo and the others were the team Yao Shifeng had assembled in the servant disciple area, then these disciples were his team on Talisman Peak.  

Yao Shifeng's purpose in forming this new group was clear—to secure investments. On the surface, Gu Mo and the others believed Yao Shifeng only had the 100 spirit stones they provided, but in reality, he had received funding from both groups. This significantly boosted his cultivation speed.  

Moreover, the Talisman Peak team could also help Yao Shifeng complete his daily missions, allowing him to focus solely on cultivation. For instance, the tasks delayed by today's gathering were delegated to others.  

Taking the blank talismans handed to him by a servant disciple, Yao Shifeng submitted his daily mission before leading the group out of the Mission Hall.  

Having gained benefits, Yao Shifeng naturally had to reciprocate. However, what he offered was guidance in cultivation and talisman-making—something invaluable to newly recruited servant disciples.  

With a senior brother willing to mentor them, these newcomers naturally chose to follow Yao Shifeng.  

Especially after Yao Shifeng broke through to the second level of Qi Refining, the servant disciples grew even more excited, convinced that following him would lead to a bright future.  

"Everyone, I've had a sudden epiphany today. Let's talk again after I finish my closed-door cultivation." Yao Shifeng cupped his hands in farewell. He needed to absorb his newfound insights as soon as possible—missing this opportunity would be a great pity.  

"Of course, Senior Brother Yao, your matters take priority!" The servant disciples quickly responded.  

After bidding farewell, Yao Shifeng returned to his quarters and took out a pill, swallowing it in one gulp. A violent surge of medicinal energy erupted, turning his face pale.  

To accelerate his cultivation, Yao Shifeng had purchased an extremely potent pill from a rogue cultivator in the market. Not only was it cheap, but its medicinal power was also several times stronger than that of ordinary pills of the same tier. The downside was its overwhelming intensity, which could easily damage meridians.  

Meridian damage was no trivial matter—it could weaken a cultivator's foundation. For example, Yao Shifeng had reached the second level of Qi Refining in just two years thanks to these potent pills, but the cost was damaged meridians, leaving his spiritual power at only 90% of an average second-level Qi Refining cultivator's.  

And this was with relatively minor damage. If Yao Shifeng continued taking these pills, his meridians would deteriorate further. Even if he eventually reached the third level of Qi Refining, his spiritual power might only amount to 70-80% of the norm.  

Yet, Yao Shifeng chose to keep using them. He refused to fade into obscurity—he wanted to break free from the shackles of being a servant disciple and prove his strength to everyone.  

Only by growing stronger could he obtain more resources. Then, he could consider repairing his meridians. Taking a deep breath, Yao Shifeng suppressed the excruciating pain caused by the violent spiritual energy surging through his meridians and began cultivating.

"Whew, done!"  

Chu Feifei wiped the sweat from her brow and handed the repaired formation disk to Gu Mo. After burying it back in the spirit field, Gu Mo activated it.  

First, the illusionary formation activated, enveloping the field in a hazy mist. Then, the defensive formation on the disk sprang to life, instantly covering the field in a thin, shimmering barrier.  

Though the barrier appeared flimsy, it could withstand attacks from a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator. While the spirit stones in the disk would deplete after a few strikes, the defensive power was undeniably solid.  

Against early or mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators, it could hold for much longer. If Gu Mo replaced the spirit stones in time, he could effectively keep intruders at bay.  

"Your skills are truly impressive, Fairy Chu."  

After testing the formation disk, Gu Mo nodded in satisfaction. "When the Water Spirit Rice matures, I'll set aside a few jin for you."  

"Deal!"  

Chu Feifei beamed. This was the first reward she had earned through her own craftsmanship. Though Gu Mo had provided significant help—even sponsorship—she was still overjoyed. After all, this meant she could now rely on herself to earn more cultivation resources in the future.  

Once the repairs were complete, Chu Feifei left. She still had her own tasks to attend to and couldn't stay away for long—such was the constraint of being a servant disciple, required to fulfill daily sect missions. Unlike outer sect disciples, they didn't enjoy the same freedom of time.  

Gu Mo, too, resumed his daily routine of farming, cultivating, and exploring the Black Mist Space.  

With the enhanced defenses of his spirit field, he planned to add five more Sunflowers, bringing the total to fifteen. Currently, with ten Sunflowers, he could gather enough Solar Essence for one new Sunflower in just five days—and the time required would only decrease further.  

While Gu Mo quietly cultivated in his spirit field, news spread among all the servant disciples in the sect.  

The sect master's newly accepted personal disciple—a genius with a superior spiritual root—was recruiting attendants from the servant disciples to handle miscellaneous tasks for him.  

The announcement sent waves of excitement through the servant disciples. It was common for inner sect disciples to recruit attendants to handle trivial matters, allowing them to focus entirely on cultivation. After all, wasting precious cultivation time on chores was an unforgivable loss.  

For many servant disciples, becoming an attendant to an inner sect disciple was a tremendous opportunity.  

Even some outer sect disciples were tempted. While serving an ordinary inner sect disciple held little appeal, being an attendant to the sect master's personal disciple was an entirely different matter.
