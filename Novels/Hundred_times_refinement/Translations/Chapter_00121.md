# Chapter 71: The Secret of Supreme-Grade Pills  

"Brother Ma has heard a thing or two about it by chance." Ma Tianxiong nodded, then showed a puzzled expression. "Junior Brother Ye seems quite interested in supreme-grade pills. Given your talent, with diligent effort, even low-grade pills should be enough for you to reach Foundation Establishment."  

"Ahaha." Lin Xian smiled on the surface, but inwardly, he was startled—he had let his emotions show too much. He quickly brushed it off casually, "Brother Ma, you're teasing me. I'm just naturally curious about all sorts of rare tales."  

"Hmm." Ma Tianxiong didn't suspect anything. Lin Xian's Heavenly Demon Disguise Art was incredibly profound—unless one was at the Core Formation stage, no one could see through his true appearance. Ma Tianxiong continued, "Brother Ma once read about supreme-grade Marrow-Cleansing Pills in an ancient text..."  

Since he saw no reason to hide it—after all, this wasn’t some valuable secret—he treated it as casual conversation and explained everything to Lin Xian.  

It turned out that the commonly accepted classification of pills in the cultivation world was incorrect.  

Lower-grade, middle-grade, and upper-grade pills were indeed ranked based on impurity content. However, the legendary supreme-grade pills were not just that.  

Supreme-grade pills possessed heaven-defying effects. Besides having an extremely high concentration of essence and minimal impurities, they also required a second refinement.  

What was a second refinement?  

As everyone knew, placing various rare spiritual materials into a cauldron and refining them under the guidance of an experienced cultivator would yield finished pills.  

This was the first refinement.  

But to obtain supreme-grade pills, one first needed to prepare already-refined upper-grade pills, then add several other spiritual herbs and refine them again—in other words, refining pills with pills.  

Because the process involved two rounds of refinement, it was called the second refinement.  

Just from the description, one could imagine the difficulty. Even for renowned sects with abundant resources and skilled alchemists, refining upper-grade pills was nearly impossible. The few upper-grade pills they had were passed down through generations, said to be "accidentally" refined under extremely fortunate circumstances.  

Since supreme-grade pills required upper-grade pills as ingredients, failure meant the upper-grade pills would be wasted. Who would be willing to take such a risk without feeling heartbroken?  

But for Lin Xian, this wasn’t a problem. At his current level, although the success rate of purifying upper-grade pills was low, he could still manage it with enough time and effort.  

However, what Ma Tianxiong said next presented him with a real challenge.  

"What? Besides needing upper-grade pills as the main ingredient, the second refinement also requires several rare spiritual herbs?"  

"Indeed." Ma Tianxiong nodded. "According to the ancient text, refining supreme-grade pills requires two supplementary ingredients: Silvermoon Flowers and Glowgrass."

The composition of supreme-grade pills differed slightly from those of lower grades, which was why Lin Xian had never succeeded despite his method of purifying and concentrating essence.  

Though he had learned the secret of supreme-grade pills from Ma Tianxiong, Lin Xian’s heart remained heavy. Upper-grade pills were manageable, but the two supplementary spiritual herbs...  

Lin Xian had read about them in the *Herb Compendium*. Unlike common herbs like ginseng or lingzhi, Silvermoon Flowers and Glowgrass were true treasures of heaven and earth—rarer even than ten-thousand-year-old ginseng.  

Where could he possibly find them?  

"Actually, these spiritual herbs do have known locations."  

"Brother Ma knows?" Lin Xian was both surprised and delighted. Despite Ma Tianxiong’s rough appearance, his knowledge was vast—almost like a walking encyclopedia.  

"They grow in the Leaping Stream Gorge."  

"Leaping Stream Gorge!" Lin Xian’s expression remained calm, but inwardly, he grimaced. The Leaping Stream Gorge was infamous as a den of demonic beasts—an extremely dangerous place.  

If it were just a demonic beast lair, Lin Xian might have dared to venture in. As the saying went, *men die for wealth, birds die for food*. Taking risks for rare spiritual herbs was only natural. Moreover, most of the demonic beasts there were only first-tier, which he could handle with his current strength.  

But the current situation was different. The Leaping Stream Gorge was located north of Yanzhou, less than a hundred miles from the Fire Spirit Sect—effectively their territory. With the two cultivation alliances locked in a war of attrition, Lin Xian, as a member of the opposing faction, would be walking straight into enemy territory if he went to gather herbs. Wouldn’t that make him a prime target for hunting?  

Staying in his sect was safe, but under these circumstances, there was no way he could achieve Foundation Establishment.  

Lin Xian was caught in a dilemma. He had initially considered another option—using the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art to shed his Piaoyun Valley robes and disguise himself as a rogue cultivator to sneak in. Although the ongoing conflict in Yanzhou had already claimed many rogue cultivators caught in the crossfire, they were still safer than sect disciples.  

But soon, even this plan fell apart.  

Though the war was currently a battle of attrition without large-scale clashes or attacks on each other’s headquarters, both sides were employing every underhanded tactic imaginable. One should never underestimate these cultivators who pursued immortality. While they might appear righteous and dignified on the surface, their methods could be more ruthless and deceitful than those of the mortal world.  

Aside from hunting down lone disciples, they also sent assassins to infiltrate enemy sects and eliminate high-ranking cultivators—a strategy to cut off the enemy’s lifeline. Though most of these assassins never returned, the tactic proved devastatingly effective.  

---  

A sect’s strength ultimately depended on its high-ranking cultivators. Spirit Awakening disciples were mere cannon fodder—no matter how many died, the sect’s foundation remained intact. But losing too many high-ranking cultivators would severely weaken a sect.  

Once the balance of power between the two sides was broken, the war of attrition would no longer be sustainable—it would escalate into a massacre until one side was annihilated.  

Naturally, neither side wanted their sect to fall. To prevent enemy assassins from infiltrating, both alliances developed identity-verification spells.  

By embedding these spells into their disciples’ bodies, they could instantly distinguish allies from spies, ensuring no enemy could slip through.
