# Chapter 27: A Sickly Complexion  

"Reaching mid-stage Qi Refining in just three months might draw too much attention."  

After burying the Sophora wood stake underground, Jiang Li didn't immediately leave the graveyard. Instead, he sat down to ponder.  

With his current mid-grade spiritual root aptitude, achieving upper-grade cultivation speed through graveyard cultivation would already be considered impressive in the eyes of ordinary people. If he were to skip straight to top-grade cultivation speed, it would undoubtedly raise too many eyebrows and invite unwanted scrutiny.  

If it led to him being valued and directly promoted to the inner sect, that would be one thing. But what he truly feared was ending up as "meat on the chopping block"—dissected and refined into pills. Given the Red-Haired Elder's dubious behavior, such an outcome wasn't entirely impossible.  

For safety's sake, it was best to suppress his cultivation progress. Ideally, he should wait until one or two of the upper-grade spiritual root disciples like Yu Banxia broke through to mid-stage Qi Refining before revealing his own progress.  

However, he still had to report to the Alchemy Hall every seven days for pill testing. The few concealment techniques he and Yan Hong had gathered seemed unlikely to fool a powerful sect elder.  

"Looks like I have to use this."  

Jiang Li pulled out a small porcelain vial from his robe. When he opened it, instead of a medicinal fragrance, a foul, burnt odor wafted out.  

**[Name: Failed Pill]**  
**[Type: Miscellaneous]**  
**[Grade: None]**  
**[Note: A pill that failed during refinement.]**  

The contents were a handful of lumpy, pitch-black pellets. These were the failed pills Jiang Li had obtained from the Red-Haired Elder. Since the elder was still dangling promises in front of him, he had no reason to refuse handing over these worthless duds.  

Though the elder had no idea what Jiang Li intended to do with them, he still warned him: "Whatever you plan, just don’t eat them."  

"If it weren’t absolutely necessary, I really wouldn’t want to eat this."  

Muttering to himself, Jiang Li reluctantly picked up one of the failed pills and swallowed it.  

**[Failed Pill consumed. Dan Poison applied to self.]**  
**[Dan Poison: All attributes reduced by 20%, spiritual energy potency weakened by 30%, spiritual energy recovery speed reduced by 30%, cultivation speed reduced by 10%. Duration: 2 years.]**  

*Gag—*  

The revolting, burnt taste triggered violent reactions in his gut, leaving him feeling utterly wretched.  

Dan Poison was notoriously difficult to expel from the body, and its effects lasted an excruciatingly long time.  

Failed pills weren’t merely accidental byproducts of botched refinement. Instead, they were deliberately created by alchemists to concentrate the majority of Dan Poison generated during the process into a subset of pills.  

Consuming failed pills was thus an extremely unwise decision. The Dan Poison accumulated from years—even a decade—of regular pill consumption could be matched by a single failed pill.  

"The consequences are severe, no wonder the cultivation world fears Dan Poison like the plague."  

"Too much of this stuff can genuinely cripple a cultivator. If not for my ability to remove status effects, I wouldn’t dare touch this."  

Still... the effect of one pill didn’t seem quite enough.  

With no other choice, he swallowed another failed pill.  

**[Dan Poison: All attributes reduced by 40%, spiritual energy potency weakened by 50%, spiritual energy recovery speed reduced by 50%, cultivation speed reduced by 30%. Duration: 5 years.]**  

Jiang Li’s aura had now completely regressed to pre-breakthrough levels. His complexion took on a sickly pallor, resembling someone who had overdosed on pills and ruined their body.  

*Even I feel sorry for myself looking like this.*  

Now, not even the Red-Haired Elder—let alone stronger cultivators—would be able to discern his true strength. After all, his current condition wasn’t a disguise; his cultivation had genuinely regressed to early-stage Qi Refining. Where was the flaw?  

The only downside was the reduced cultivation speed. He’d have to temporarily remove the status while cultivating and reapply it afterward—an excruciating cycle.  

*(This is the cheat version of concealment—it won’t affect actual cultivation speed.)*  

After leaving the graveyard, Jiang Li spent his usual two hours browsing the trading district. Yan Hong’s stall was already well-stocked, and their buy-low-sell-high business had finally begun turning a steady profit.  

Once he finished leveling up his Appraisal skill, Jiang Li headed to the mission hall.  

"Jiang Li!"  

The moment he stepped inside, a voice called out from behind, stopping him in his tracks.  

A group of fellow outer sect disciples—both male and female—hurried over. Jiang Li recognized them all.  

"We saw someone who looked like you from behind. I said it was you, but they didn’t believe me."  

"See? I was right."  

The speaker was none other than Yu Banxia, Lu Qianqian, and the others. They looked travel-worn, as if they’d just returned from a long journey.  

"Jiang Li, you’re here to take on missions too? Are you alone?"  

Yu Banxia and the others seemed surprised. Their group of seven or eight early-stage Qi Refining disciples had only dared to take on missions together to earn spirit stones. Yet Jiang Li was here alone—and didn’t seem like it was his first time.  

"Jiang Li, you look terrible. Are you sick?"  

His sickly complexion was impossible to miss. He looked like someone on death’s door.  

"Well... my cultivation method is a bit special. Prolonged exposure to the graveyard’s Yin energy caused this. It’ll improve once I break through to mid-stage Qi Refining."  

The group had once envied Jiang Li’s ability to cultivate in the graveyard, but now they saw it wasn’t as effortless as they’d imagined.  

Jiang Li brushed off their concern with a casual excuse before shifting the topic.  

"I’ve taken on a few simple missions. The sect’s resources alone just aren’t enough."  

"What about you? You look like you just returned from outside. Did you take an external mission?"  

Now it was Jiang Li’s turn to be surprised. External missions carried significant risks—most disciples wouldn’t dare attempt them.  

"Yeah. The top ten disciples who achieved Qi Refining first were all rewarded with a technique. With our upper-grade spiritual roots, our cultivation speed is faster than many senior disciples."  

"Yu Banxia is the strongest among us. He’s already completed several internal missions before leading us on this external one."  

"Between you and me, we made quite a haul this time."  

Their excitement was palpable as they proudly displayed their bulging packs.  

"Congratulations. Was it a gathering mission? If you have extra loot, Yan Hong’s doing well in the market district. He might offer you a better price."  

Jiang Li realized this group represented the most talented and powerful new disciples of their batch. Each had received a technique—a privilege granted to only ten disciples annually. Their strength was only natural.  

After congratulating them, he put in a word for Yan Hong’s business.  

"I was actually thinking the same thing."  

"Jiang Li, would you like to join us for a mission?"  

Yu Banxia scratched his head, bashful from the praise, before extending an invitation.  

"Another external mission? I’d love to, but I’m afraid I can’t right now."  

Jiang Li did the math—he still had unfinished business, and external missions often took ten days to half a month. Until the Red-Haired Elder’s project concluded, he couldn’t leave.  

"No worries. We were planning to rest for a while anyway."  

"Besides, I have a feeling I’ll break through to mid-stage Qi Refining in about a month. Then we can all take on a more rewarding mission together."  

Yu Banxia’s eyes sparkled with pride. Being the first in their batch to reach mid-stage Qi Refining was certainly something to boast about.  

"You’re about to break through?"  

"Then we’ll be counting on you from now on."  

Jiang Li’s words prompted a round of flattery from the group.  

"Then it’s settled. We’ll catch up later—we need to report our mission now."  

"Sure, next time."  

After making tentative plans, they parted ways.  

*"About a month, huh? I’ll ‘break through’ right after him then."*  

The sickly state was unbearable. The sooner he could shed it, the better.  

Jiang Li entered the mission hall and approached the counter of the inner sect senior sister he frequented.  

"Senior Sister Su Xuemei, please register me."  

He handed over his outer sect identity token without further explanation—she already knew the drill. After three months of weekly visits for the same mission, forgetting would be impossible.  

"It’s you again, Junior Brother Jiang Li. Heavens, you look awful! Are you sure you still want to take this mission?"  

*Jiang Li: Maybe I should start wearing makeup before leaving the house...*  

"Thank you for your concern, Senior Sister. But the pill formula is nearly complete—I don’t want to give up now."  

Su Xuemei nodded, though she privately lamented Jiang Li’s stubbornness—and his naivety. Even if the formula succeeded, what did it matter to him? Was it worth sacrificing half his lifespan?  

Still, she processed his registration without comment.  

The reason Jiang Li insisted on formally accepting the mission each time was to keep the Red-Haired Elder in check. While the elder would happily compensate him regardless, taking the mission ensured the sect kept records. Under the sect’s oversight, even an elder would exercise restraint. Without it, Jiang Li feared the elder might resort to extreme measures.  

"HAHAHA! Jiang Li, you’re here!"  

"I’ve revised and adjusted five new pill formulas this time. One of them must be correct. Come, come! Let’s test them!"
