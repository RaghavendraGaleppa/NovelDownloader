# Chapter 337: Complete Submission, Revealing the Truth, Shiji’s Humiliation, and the Madam’s Reward

Wen Caishang’s eyes rippled with emotion. She knew Li Xian possessed monstrous strength, enhanced further by his Double Pupil Physique and Perfect Physique. Combined with his solid foundation in the Dao of Martial Arts and a spine as sturdy as a divine mountain, he was invincible here, capable of facing a hundred or even a thousand enemies. However, seeing him combine spear and sword for the first time—his spear techniques unexpectedly exquisite, his swordsmanship self-contained and unfathomable—was a shock. The self-proclaimed righteous elders and disciples were defeated in a single exchange, crumbling like clay chickens and ceramic dogs, scattered like stray dogs, crushed and trampled. Their masculine pride, fighting spirit, and noble demeanor were shattered completely. Such power and momentum were unheard of in the world!

Thinking of her "little man" overturning enemies for her brought her indescribable joy.

Wen Caishang glanced at the female disciples of the Sword Sect. Their eyes shone with complex emotions—shock, admiration, and reverence. She pondered, "It hasn't been long since we parted, yet his abilities have grown even more unpredictable, beyond even my expectations. I pride myself on my talent, but I fall short of him. He merely lacks experience, opportunities,沉淀 (accumulation), and time. Given time, surpassing me will be no problem."

"My little man is more capable than me, protecting and loving me... naturally, I am delighted. I only fear he won't listen to me, and then I'll have no way to handle him. I know his nature all too well; how could he not attract butterflies and flowers?"

She couldn't help but waver between worry and joy.

Later, the enemy's cries of pain filled the air, and they were all spent. Wang Zongheng hung upside down from a tree branch, Hu Yueyue lay amidst a pile of rocks, Xiao Wanjian fell into the lake, Duan Yixin was stuck in a mud pit, and Hou Yuande was pierced by several spears and swords, blood flowing. He had to sit and stabilize his blood to keep his life.

The surrounding disciples were scattered everywhere, defeated and in disarray, crying out in agony and surrendering, throwing away their swords. They dared not shout anymore, looking at him with fear, viewing him as a ghost or god, their hearts shadowed with trauma. The female disciples of the Sword Sect were still in shock, exchanging glances, unsure whether to be happy or worried. Among the crowd, faint cheers of "Good!" could be heard, but they immediately realized it was inappropriate, blushing and covering their mouths, pretending nothing had happened...

Li Xian took a step forward. The disciples who had just managed to stand up scrambled away, crawling and rolling, no one daring to block his path. He mused, "This is quite marvelous. I heard long ago that the Five Mountains Sword Sect would form an alliance here, and I thought it would be a grand event in the martial world. I didn't expect that by some twist of fate, I ended up beating up the elders and disciples of the Five Mountains Sword Alliance. Well, my anger is vented, and now the problem needs to be solved."

Li Xian said to the crowd, "I kept my promise, injuring but not killing. But if you纠缠 (entangle) with me and my wife again, don't blame my sword for being merciless and my spear for being ruthless."

Everyone remained silent. Xiao Wanjian had the most domineering personality and was the most unyielding, always meddling in anything he found displeasing. However, Li Xian's power was imprinted in his heart; he had been defeated, his sword bent, and his courage shattered. Even he swallowed his anger now.

Li Xian said, "Now, the female disciples of the Sword Alliance have returned safely. The cause of this matter is not as simple as it appears. I, Li Xian, am not one to demand repayment for favors. It doesn't matter if you don't remember my kindness."

"But let me remind you: instead of seeking revenge on me and my wife, you should ask the female members of your sect who started this. Once the matter is clarified, if you still want to seek revenge on my wife, that's fine. I will naturally protect my wife."

Li Xian walked back to the pavilion in the middle of the lake and whispered in Wen Caishang's ear, "Madam, I've sent them off. Shall we leave?"

Wen Caishang was filled with tenderness and gently nodded. She thought, "My Li Lang's intention to protect me is genuine. It's not in vain that I... I... am solely devoted to him." She raised her hand, signaling Li Xian to support her.

The two walked side by side. Wen Caishang took delicate steps, leaving the pavilion and saying to the crowd, "I am in a good mood today. You all cursed, bullied, and humiliated me, and my little man has vented my anger for me. If you are not convinced, you can come find me after leaving this tomb. I will treat you with fine wine and discuss a mutually beneficial solution."

"But now, my little man and I have other important matters. If anyone is so blind as to cause trouble again, my little man only injures but does not kill, but I am exactly the opposite."

She flicked her sleeve. The White Snake Soft Sword extended. This soft sword was soft, tough, sharp, and cold... but it couldn't extend. Wen Caishang's "Void-Storage Demon Robe" could store items in the void and distort the properties of objects, making the soft sword extend and grow long. With this flick of her sleeve, the soft sword carved a falling leaf, leaving only its skeletal structure.

She said softly, "This will be your fate."

"Li Lang... come with me." She pulled Li Xian and walked away.

The Five Mountains Sword Alliance watched them go, only regaining their senses after they disappeared from sight. A disciple picked up the leaf skeleton and was so startled his hair stood on end. The lingering sword intent remained, pricking his fingers with countless sword marks, causing blood to gush out.

The female disciples quickly helped them up. The elders and male disciples groaned, "Ouch," "It hurts," "I'm falling apart"... The leader of the team clenched his teeth, refusing to make a sound, and was helped to rest on the grass.

The Sword Alliance members lay scattered, rarely gathered together. After resting for a while, they gradually recovered their breath, and议论 (discussion) began to spread:

"Unhuman, unhuman! I... I've never seen such a fierce person!"

"This man's strength is bizarrely great. The four or five of us practiced the 'Ox-Slaying Sword Art,' and our strength is not weak. We joined forces to wrestle with him, but he swept us away lightly, and it was instantly dispersed."

"More than that... this man's energy is like a dragon, growing fiercer the more he fights. I saw that although he is tall, he isn't particularly burly. How can he possess such monstrous strength?"

"We are truly not his opponents. Even if we have more men, it's useless. This man is too fierce."

"If it weren't for the invisible influence of the bell, and I could execute my sword techniques perfectly, I wonder if I could take him down."

The female disciples bandaged the others, hearing the discussions, and said, "If there weren't for the bell's influence, I think even if you fought him one-on-one, you still wouldn't be able to do anything to him."

Wang Dezhong of Jiushan Sword Sect saw that the speaker was a junior sister from his sect and asked, "Oh? Does Junior Sister know him well? How did you come to that conclusion? His spear and sword skills are indeed exquisite, and his strength is surprisingly great. But if it comes to martial arts evolution and sword style... we might not be able to make up for the disadvantage."

The female disciples chattered, "More than just knowing him, the one who saved us was just that young man. We originally wanted to introduce him, but who knew... who knew it would turn out like this."

Disciple Hua Wu asked, "Strange, this boy is a notorious womanizer. How could he save you? Could it be that the thief is crying 'stop thief,' deliberately putting on a big show? Senior Sisters, Junior Sisters, you must not be deceived. This womanizer looks slick and handsome, very pretty. When he speaks sweet words, even that尊王 (Venerable King) and Madam Wen listen with delight. He looks extremely dishonest."

Zhao Chunxia pondered, "Junior and Senior Sisters are easily deceived, but are the elders of our sects also unable to distinguish? Flower Cage Sect is not good at single combat; if they encounter an enemy, they must form a formation to围攻 (surround and attack). Just now, he fought against many alone. This kind of courage and strength... how could a womanizer have it? If he were a womanizer, wouldn't you all be even worse than a womanizer?" She was bandaging Wang Zongheng of Yueshan Sword Sect. Hearing that her peers had been defeated and dared not speak, and now that Li Xian had left, she finally vented her tongue and辩驳 (argued) incessantly.

Mu Hongchou said, "He... he... I don't know his background, but this kind of person... I think... I think he is definitely not a womanizer." She looked in the direction Li Xian left, her eyes slightly痴 (infatuated).

Tang Mengluo asked in surprise, "Where did you get this news? Why do you all curse him as a womanizer?" Wang Dezhong said, "Elder Tang, after you disappeared, we suspected the Flower Cage Sect was behind it, so we joined forces with Flying Dragon City to strictly抓 (arrest) the Flower Cage Sect bandits. We caught several bandits, and they all pointed out that the one who captured you was the 'Flower Without Fault' womanizer."

"Later, a notice was posted. Zhou Shijie, Brother Zhou, saw Flower Without Fault's appearance, recognized the red mole on his forehead, and told us his original name is Li Xian, a native of Qiong Tian Mansion. He is a local evil military officer, oppressing the people, doing all sorts of evil deeds, and is despised by all."

After speaking, everyone looked at Zhou Shijie. Zhou Shijie was startled, feeling like an outsider, and硬着头皮 (hardened his scalp) cupped his hands in acknowledgment.

Upon hearing the name "Zhou Shijie," the female disciples became furious, and various curses ensued. Zhao Chunxia raised her hand to silence them, saying, "Brother Zhou is not a disciple of our Sword Sect. It is indeed admirable that he braved danger with us. But is what this disciple just said true?"

Zhou Shijie said, "It is true."

Lin Aoshan said, "I don't think so." Zhou Shijie recognized Lin Aoshan and frowned, asking, "Is it you?"

Lin Aoshan said, "In my opinion, you, Zhou Shijie, are adding fuel to the fire, clearly out of jealousy. This Little Li is a decent person, how could he be an evil officer? Judging by your performance just now, you really like that尊王 (Venerable King)'s wife, don't you?"

Zhou Shijie panicked, "You... how dare you talk nonsense! How... how could that be possible." The disciples watching knew the truth. Wang Dezhong, Hua Wu... those who befriended Zhou Shijie early on and formed a good relationship, secretly thought, "As the saying goes, time reveals a man's heart. When I first met Brother Zhou, he was indeed elegant and dignified, possessing a bit of style and fortune, making people admire him. Later, upon further contact, I realized his martial arts were slightly lacking and his fortune was shallow. Although he is still a standout among his peers, his abilities are inevitably a bit insufficient. Moreover, he often shows off his strengths and hides his weaknesses when gathering for meals. Daily contact inevitably makes one feel he is narrow-minded."

"Now looking again... this Brother Zhou is really... really..." Considering their past friendship, he didn't want to say too much.

Lin Aoshan was extremely annoyed with Zhou Shijie and said, "Look at you, your appearance isn't bad, but your character is terrible. If you like that Madam, that's fine, but first, you don't dare to speak up, being sneaky and timid. Second, when the Madam was in trouble, you told her to废掉武功 (废掉武功). But Li Xian stood up to shield her from disaster. How could she possibly look at you?"

Zhou Shijie's heart was pierced, and he flew into a rage, immediately wanting to make a move. Lin Aoshan, Luo Feiyan, Mu Hongchou, and several other sisters glared at him. Zhou Shijie sheepishly retracted his stance and grumbled, "Groundless speculation, not worth arguing with you. Hmph, don't forget who injured your Five Mountains Sword Alliance. We may be injured, but our hearts are guiltless. You lot are just watching from the sidelines, and now you're making sarcastic remarks."

Several disciples were stirred up and felt extremely dissatisfied. Mu Hongchou said, "Hmph, being injured is better than dying. Tell me, which of you could block his spear?"

The resentment dissipated again, leaving a moment of silence.

Wang Zongheng of Yueshan Sword Sect pondered, "Elders, regarding this alliance matter, upon careful thought, there are indeed many strange points. Now that we are injured, let's use this time to rest and compile all the clues to clarify the matter."

Duan Yixin, Hou Yuande, Hu Yueyue, and Xiao Wanjian all agreed. Wang Zongheng said solemnly, "Piaoxue, I heard you say that the culprit was He Wentian. At the time, it wasn't that I didn't believe you, but... we had suspected He Wentian once before, but later he risked his life to save us. Encountering it a second time, we wanted to be steady and cautious, fearing another misunderstanding, so we dealt with it slowly. If He Wentian were really the bandit, Flying Dragon City is right here; could he really escape?"

Yang Piaoxue said, "Elder Wang's painstaking efforts, we all understand. But this matter... He Wentian is the bandit, that is undoubtedly true! The机关 (mechanisms) in the Worry-Free Tower were重重 (numerous). We were caught off guard, poisoned in the dishes, transported to this Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Cave, and imprisoned. If it weren't for He Wentian, who could have done it so easily?"

Xiao Wanjian said, "Flower Cage Sect's schemes are endless; it's not impossible for them to do it." Wang Zongheng said, "This matter must be handled carefully. We are not defending him, but if there are suspicious points, we must consider them in advance."

Hu Yueyue said, "You all should explain the details clearly. That way, we won't misjudge."

Zhao Chunxia said, "Alright, I'll speak first. Elders, you are wise and astute, you can judge right from wrong." She then recounted how she took her disciples to the meeting, how they killed the flower bandits, how they were captured and thrown into prison, how they were deceived, nearly losing their disciples, and then imprisoned in the幽谷 (secluded valley).

The elders fell silent upon hearing this, and words defending He Wentian were hard to utter. Yang Piaoxue, Tang Mengluo, Peng Sanluo, He Lijun, and other elders then spoke of how they were poisoned that day, how they were transported to the valley, and how they were imprisoned and had their blood drawn.

The disciples only realized the danger afterward. Duan Yixin asked, "There were玄铁栅 (titanium iron bars) imprisoning them, and琵琶锁骨链 (lute collarbone chains) piercing their bodies, with three-realm martial artists guarding outside. In such a situation... how did you escape?"

Tang Mengluo said, "This matter... it brings us back to that Li Xian. He潜伏 (lurked) among the crowd, seized the opportunity, and with the strength of the second realm,逆伐 (counter-attacked) the third realm. A fierce battle ensued, and he saved us."

Wang Zongheng said, "Counter-attacking the third realm? Tell us the situation at that time in detail, don't miss any detail."

Tang Mengluo, Yang Piaoxue, Peng Sanluo... the women corroborated each other's stories, recounting how Li Xian shot the enemy, how he maneuvered, how he化解 (resolved the crisis), and how he killed Zheng Dechun... one by one.

At that time, there was no bell ringing, and the danger inside was easily imagined. The disciples were amazed upon hearing this. The female disciples added more details, describing the perilous and unpredictable situation at that time. It was as if they were reliving the past, excited and振奋 (inspired), their blood boiling.

Zhao Chunxia sat quietly, listening, her thoughts drifting: "So he already has a woman he likes, that Madam. This man loves to flirt with words, making my heart flutter for no reason. Then he left, leaving me with added worries."

Wang Zongheng said, "This young man is indeed extraordinary. No wonder that Madam is so infatuated with him." Hu Yueyue sighed, "According to what you said, when fighting Zheng Dechun, he still held back."

Tang Mengluo said, "Oh? How does Elder Hu know?" Hu Yueyue said, "At that time, he only used his spear, not his sword. Isn't that obvious? His swordsmanship is far superior to his spear techniques, even... even surpassing us."

Xiao Wanjian sighed deeply, "This boy is a monster, an absolute monster. At his age, how can he have cultivated such profound swordsmanship? Truly... a heaven-defying genius."

Hua Wu let out a slight sigh of relief, saying, "Then, just now, when he used both spear and sword, he must have used his full strength, right?"

Zhao Chunxia said, "I'm afraid not." Everyone turned to look at her. Zhao Chunxia said, "This boy seems humble, but he is actually very proud. Don't forget, his archery is also称绝 (peerless). The terrain of the Nvxia Canyon is unique; more than thirty zhang above the ground, the wind and snow never cease. The cold is piercing to the bone. He hung there, shooting arrows and maneuvering, forcing the third-realm martial artist into a sorry state."

"If he had hidden far away and shot us with暗箭 (sneak arrows), how many of us, under the invisible influence of the bell, could have survived? With his archery skills, this situation would be most favorable for him. One arrow through three, one arrow through four, one arrow through five... it would be extremely easy. We may have many people, but we are not a thousand soldiers and ten thousand horses. How many arrows would he need to射 (shoot)?"

This remark awakened everyone, and they felt a sense of after-the-fact fear. Hu Yueyue frowned and asked, "Then why didn't he..." Zhao Chunxia said, "I suppose... his heart is relatively soft. If he really killed us like that, the matter would be irreconcilable. He knew there was room for maneuver, so he did it this way."

"He told us not to interfere, originally to avoid a killing disaster. If he hadn't, that 'Sword-Breaking Madam' has a ruthless nature and would have insisted he kill. That Madam also... also likes him very much. In the end, she didn't make it difficult for him and chose to依 (follow) him."

Zhao Chunxia said softly, "But if we cause trouble again and really try to harm his wife, he... he... will definitely not show mercy either."

Xiao Wanjian cursed indignantly, "Adulterer and bitch, indulging in lust. Even with great talent, it will be wasted in the future."

Wang Zongheng said, "In that case, this matter is highly suspicious. Junior Sisters, don't blame us for being negligent. Previously, He Wentian risked his life to save us. If he hadn't come, we would all have been trapped and killed in this tomb. But now that everything has been clarified, that He Wentian's schemes are deep, his calculations are profound!"

Zhao Chunxia said, "It really can't be blamed on you Senior Brothers. That He Wentian is extremely good at伪装 (disguise). Not only were you deceived, I was also deceived. Until the point of no return, I never believed he was evil."

Lin Aoshan said, "This man's mind is deep, and his poisonous schemes are insidious. That's one thing. He has even more schemes, and he wants to build momentum to称霸 (dominate)!" She then clearly explained the corpse soldiers and He Wentian's subsequent strategies.

This conversation lasted a full day. Finally, everything was explained clearly, the enemy and friend were distinguished, and the key points were understood.

On the other side.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang shook off the crowd and were no longer disturbed. The main hall stood quietly, the bells ringing continuously with an invisible vibration, inaudible to the ear but still affecting them. The Green Scenery Garden was vast, its scenery unchanged for thousands of years. Though there were colorful flower clusters, weeping willows, and green grass, walking through it felt lifeless.

The two escaped the dangerous situation, talking closely. Their conversation had a unique charm, so they didn't feel bored. Wen Caishang wore a white dress, her hair as thick as a waterfall, her stepswaying gently with each step, her demeanor graceful.

After leaving the lake, Wen Caishang pointed the way with her finger, walking side by side with Li Xian. Not far ahead, they saw a vermilion wall with an arched doorway for passage. Looking inside, a pale yellow stone blocked the view. But the space was spacious, and they could easily walk around it.

Wen Caishang knew Li Xian was eager to learn, and she was more than willing to teach him various miscellaneous knowledge and paths. She said, "This is a 'Blindstone,' a very common garden layout. If you cross that door without this huge stone blocking the view, the garden's landscape layout would be visible at a glance. It looks beautiful at first, but it quickly becomes boring."

Li Xian said, "I actually know this. I've seen similar garden scenery while wandering around before."

Wen Caishang said, "I think you don't really know. You're pretending to understand." She gently pushed him with her slender finger, giving him a flirtatious glance, and continued, "Martial arts are the same. If you suddenly get to learn all the powerful martial arts, it seems like a good thing, but hidden dangers are埋 (buried). Even in martial arts families and aristocratic clans with abundant resources, don't you see that the younger generation, all possessing profound martial arts, still need to endure hardships,深耕 (deeply cultivate) their family, and accumulate contributions to truly obtain profound martial arts?"

Li Xian said, "So that's how it is." He thought to himself, "Aristocratic families do have such rules, but the Madam's intention in hiding her abilities from me might not be the same."

She complained, "You resented me before for not teaching you swordsmanship. You ran off to secretly learn someone else's sword art." She seemed quite耿耿于怀 (harbored a grudge) about this.

Li Xian wiped his sweat slightly and said, "Madam, don't be angry. I apologize to you."

Wen Caishang said, "Alright, we'll talk about this later. I have benefits for you." She pointed at the huge blindstone and said, "With this stone blocking the way, garden visitors must walk around the stone, step by step, viewing the scenery, slowly appreciating the意境 (artistic conception)."

Wen Caishang said, "The tomb owner set up this scenery, indicating that after the tomb was built, he still lived here for a long time, occasionally walking in the garden to admire the view."

Li Xian had gone through many dangers along the way and couldn't help but ask curiously, "Why did he still live here for a while?"

Wen Caishang said, "This tomb belongs to the 'King of the Underworld, Dugu Boyuan,' the later ruler of the 'You State,' a small country during the Nanyang period. There are very few historical records about him. But I偶然 (chanced upon) reading the 'Southern Secret Classics,' so I know a bit more than the average person."

Li Xian took the opportunity to flatter, "Madam is mighty. Whoever gets Madam's help will know the past and present, and there will be no secrets left in the world." Wen Caishang laughed and scolded, "If you keep flattering, I won't continue."

She then continued, "This Dugu Boyuan was three years old when his country was destroyed, and his territory was吞并 (annexed) by another small country. Although it was recorded as a 'small country,' it actually had the territory of a prefecture. It wasn't small. Dugu Boyuan wanted to restore his country. But before he could succeed, he first made a name for himself in the martial world."

"Martial artists may be strong, but they only strengthen themselves and extend their own lifespan. They are of no benefit to government or the people. Although Dugu Boyuan had considerable ability, his talent was ultimately limited, and he failed to restore his country. More so, due to an obsession, he could have lived a carefree life, but he走火入魔 (went berserk), causing his lifespan to decrease drastically."

"He knew he couldn't become an emperor in his lifetime, so he planned to become an emperor after death, using his life's savings on this place. Before his death, he searched everywhere for the 'Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Cave' to build his tomb. This man was very resourceful. After finding the cave, he probably built a martial arts manor on the ground, secretly gathering craftsmen, and secretly cast this tomb."

"There is a place here that stores tens of thousands of corpse soldiers. They are made through special medicinal baths and refining. They can move and kill on the battlefield. Presumably, he thought that as an emperor, how could he have no army. So he secretly arranged this. If I am not mistaken, the tens of thousands of corpse soldiers were either his former subjects he tricked or captured. This tomb took decades to build, and the corpse soldiers were slowly accumulated, gradually forming a grand scale."

Li Xian suddenly understood, saying, "He didn't expect that his corpse soldiers would be coveted by later generations."

Wen Caishang smiled, "You are smart, but you are wrong on this point. He actually hoped that the corpse soldiers would be used by later generations. Controlling the corpse soldiers requires his old country's Tiger Tally. Whoever holds his Tiger Tally is his general. If they truly carve out a world, in his eyes, it is expanding his territory. So the Tiger Tally is placed where the corpse soldiers are stored, and it has long been taken by He Wentian."

"He Wentian used阴血 (yin blood) to nourish the corpse soldiers, making them stronger. This was also tacitly approved by Dugu Boyuan. If he didn't have this intention, the storage place for the corpse soldiers would be even deeper; how could He Wentian have found it?"

Li Xian said, "So that's how it is." Wen Caishang continued, "But whether it's Dugu Boyuan or He Wentian... their见识 (vision) is a bit shallow. Mere corpse soldiers are already dead things. Although they don't know pain or fear, they are indeed superior to ordinary armies. If they encounter a truly powerful army, like the Great Wu Dynasty's Canglong Army or Red God Army... they would be annihilated in an instant. A thousand men could defeat these tens of thousands of corpse soldiers. If they rely on corpse soldiers to achieve great things, it's simply wishful thinking."

Li Xian asked, "Madam, what is the situation with this bell? Do you know anything about it?"

Wen Caishang was silent for a long time, vaguely guessing, "Legend has it that Dugu Boyuan practiced a strange technique called 'Heart of Solitude.' The vibration of the heart's sound can消解 (dissolve) others' martial arts. Presumably, before his death, Dugu Boyuan practiced this technique, and his heart's sound vibrated, invisibly affecting the Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Cave. Because it was extremely compatible with this place, the martial arts evolution has been留存 (retained), and over thousands of years, it has intensified, far exceeding what it was during Dugu Boyuan's lifetime."

"I opened the heart chamber again, which caused this earth cave to跳动 (beat). It was equivalent to the Nine-窍 Dragon Heart Cave executing 'Heart of Solitude,' as if the natural terrain was executing 'martial arts.' Its power is stronger, and since we are inside the heart chamber, it is naturally even harder to resist."

Wen Caishang walked left and right, moving very quickly through the tomb, her skirt swaying, a fragrant breeze brushing the nose. They returned to the main hall. The structure inside was complex, but they had already passed through the机关 (mechanisms) and dangers, so there were fewer hazards now.

Wen Caishang took Li Xian to the "Bedchamber" and took the "Golden Dragon Stone Pillow" and the "Nine-Dragon Body Covering Blanket." These two items for the bed were the most precious, with many miraculous uses.

They went to the study and took the "Tip-End Brush" and "Mysterious Silk Paper"... and other items. If others didn't know their value, they wouldn't realize how precious they were even if they passed by. They visited several places like this, some for collections, some for strange treasures, some for tools.

Finally, they came to a secret room. She stood outside the door and said, "Li Lang, I know your intentions. The greatest opportunity in this tomb is inside. As long as you listen to me well in the future, good opportunities and good treasures will never be lacking for you."
