Chapter 462: Refining Treasures

He wanted me to come out of seclusion.

His divine sense swept over the mountains outside the pass. Although he couldn't be certain if that old bald donkey was still waiting, given the persistence of Buddhist cultivators, ten years was but a snap of the fingers for a Foundation Establishment true cultivator.

"Rashly leaving seclusion would be like throwing myself into a trap."

Xu Yunfan's eyes turned cold.

He was well aware of these bald donkeys' ways. They seemed compassionate but were actually relentless.

If he took half a step out of Cold Raven Pass right now, he would likely fall into an ambush immediately.

"Perhaps the moment I step out of the pass..."

He could already imagine the scene: Buddhist light flooding the sky, Vajra Pestles, Subduing Demonic Pestles, and other Buddhist artifacts tearing through the air.

Those bald donkeys had probably long since laid a heavenly net, just waiting for him to deliver himself to them.

"Can't take the risk."

Xu Yunfan withdrew his divine sense, his knuckles lightly tapping the table as he made a decision.

The path of cultivation is long; there's no need to put oneself in danger for the sake of temporary urgency. After all, he still had plenty of lifespan and could afford to wait for the right moment.

In contrast, according to the information he had, the Fulong Arhat had been famous for nearly three hundred years and was likely nearing the end of his lifespan. Rather than risk leaving the pass, it was better to use this time to secretly refine artifacts.

In any case, it would be that old bald donkey who couldn't afford to wait out the time first.

The Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven's Creation Scripture had already reached minor completion. Relying on the resources within Cold Raven Pass, he could refine a few artifacts.

After all, according to Hundred Peaks True Lord, Cold Raven Pass is one of the vents for primal clear and turbid qi. A major event is bound to happen within sixty years. When that time comes, he could search extensively and hand things over to Qingyuan True Lord, which would surely yield a generous reward. He might even be able to obtain the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiend qi from Qingyuan True Lord and take another step forward.

There was no need to be so anxious.

The advantage was his.

For the next ten years,

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged deep within his cave dwelling. Surging killing intent swirled around him. The accumulated Yin-turbid qi within Cold Raven Pass flowed through the Yin-accumulating array he had meticulously arranged, transforming into pure spiritual power that continuously poured into the furnace before him.

"The Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven's Creation Scripture has reached minor completion. Refining artifacts is now quite simple for me."

Xu Yunfan gazed at the Eight Sceneries Spiritual Flames dancing within the furnace, his mind already made up.

The path of artifact refining emphasizes the "harmony of material and method."

The quality of the material determines the foundation of the artifact, while the refining technique determines its final power.

Now that the *Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven's Creation Scripture* has reached minor completion, with the help of the attribute panel, he had a thorough understanding of this artifact refining method, and refining common artifacts posed no obstacle.

"Minor completion allows for refining artifacts. If I reach major completion, I can achieve perfect flawlessness..."

His fingertip lightly tapped the furnace fire, and the eight-colored spiritual flames flowed according to his will.

Although he had not yet reached the major completion realm, with the spiritual materials gathered within Cold Raven Pass, supplemented by the unique refining methods of the Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven method, it was enough to refine artifacts that suited the Three Heads and Six Arms manifestation of his Divine Martial Dao Base.

As for the higher-level "Spiritual Treasure" and even "Heavenly Spiritual Treasure," they required more profound artifact refining skills and support from heavenly treasures. There was no need to rush for that.

"Enough is enough."

Xu Yunfan retracted his thoughts, his divine sense sinking into the furnace.

Artifact refining is like cultivation; being greedy for too much can easily lead to stagnation. For now, he would use the existing materials to forge suitable artifacts. Later, when his realm improved and resources were abundant, he could pursue higher levels of artifact refining.

One can't become fat in a single breath.

Even with the attribute panel, he could only advance step by step.

His eyes flashed, and his fingertip lightly tapped. The flames in the furnace suddenly surged, transforming into eight different colored spiritual flames that circled the furnace.

This was the unique feature of the *Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven's Creation Scripture*.

Using the Eight Sceneries to forge the heavens, transforming the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth into artifact refining fire. Each flame corresponds to a fundamental force in the world, capable of melting all things and refining their essence.

The Divine Martial Dao Base manifests the Three Heads and Six Arms form. If the six arms do not have suitable artifacts, it is difficult to unleash their full power.

After all, from the records in the Primordial Origin Sect's classics, when the Divine Martial True Lord unfolded his Divine Martial Dao Base, his six arms moved in unison, allowing him to directly confront the sword cultivators of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, who specialized in killing sword paths, without falling behind.

Such might was precisely what Xu Yunfan sought. Since the Divine Martial Dao Base was already formed, he should follow the example of the sages and use martial arts to prove the Dao.

"Divine Martial True Lord, rest assured and go. I will naturally uphold your will, using the True武 Subduing Demons Scripture to seek a Golden Core fruit position."

Xu Yunfan feigned emotion. Some things require finding a proper justification for oneself to feel motivated and to do things thoroughly and satisfactorily.

With a thought, rare materials flew out from his storage bag.

Spiritual ores, demonic bones, and killing crystals gathered over the years from the Cold Raven Pass market, along with a few incomplete artifacts traded from rogue cultivators, were all thrown into the furnace.

"Rise!"

He formed hand seals, and his divine sense surged into the furnace like a tide. Each wisp of his spiritual will precisely controlled the melting, purification, and recombination of the materials.

Xu Yunfan's mind shifted, integrating the essence of the Heavenly Crafting Forging Technique into the artifact refining process.

This forging technique was inherited from the Divine Martial World. Although it was not as profound as the仙道 artifact refining methods, it excelled in having a solid foundation.

Its most unique feature was that it could be tailored to the cultivator's characteristics. It could forge standard artifacts conventionally, or it could be creative to achieve special designs.

After all, those mechanical ingenuities were something not found in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

The spiritual flames in the furnace churned. The materials quickly melted under the refinement of the Eight Sceneries fire, their impurities burned away, leaving only the purest parts.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were fixed. His fingertip lightly划动, and one by one, runes were imprinted onto the molten materials, gradually shaping them.

Although it was his first time refining an artifact, with the assistance of the attribute panel, the various key points of artifact refining from the *Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven's Creation Scripture* at minor completion were already engraved in his heart.

His ten fingers danced like butterflies, and hand seals were precisely injected into the furnace. The Eight Sceneries cloud energy flowed according to his will, pulling out the essence of all kinds of spiritual materials.

He refined for forty-nine days.

With a low shout, black light surged in the furnace. A long halberd, entirely black and entwined with Yin-killing intent, slowly took shape.

The halberd's tip was like a dragon's tooth, and the shaft was carved with profound patterns. It was refined using the unique Yin-killing intent of Cold Raven Pass. Once activated, the killing intent would surge like a tide, capable of eroding the opponent's spiritual power and artifacts. It was extremely lethal.

"Xuan Sha Heavy Halberd!"

*You have successfully refined a low-grade artifact. Your proficiency in Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Forging Heaven's Creation Scripture has increased.*
*Your Heavenly Crafting Forging Technique has gained a massive amount of proficiency.*
*Your Heavenly Crafting Forging Technique has reached perfection.*

Xu Yunfan felt the surging forging essentials in his sea of consciousness and couldn't help but feel a little emotional.

This Heavenly Crafting Forging Technique, in the Divine Martial World, was definitely the top secret method in the path of forging weapons and mechanisms. Yet now, just by successfully refining one artifact, it was pushed to perfection.

The level was a bit low.

After the Heavenly Crafting Forging Technique reached perfection, the naturally inherited essentials of weapon forging and mechanism design constantly lingered in his mind, which he quickly digested.

He stared at the Xuan Sha Heavy Halberd in his hand. As the Yin-killing intent flowed along the shaft, he suddenly understood several subtle flaws.

"So that's how it is..."

His fingertip lightly stroked the halberd's edge, and the Eight Sceneries Spiritual Flames flickered within its veins.
