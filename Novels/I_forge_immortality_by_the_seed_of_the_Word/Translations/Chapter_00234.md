# Chapter 232: Reactions from All Sides, True Inheritor Dharma Assembly in the Grotto-Heaven

In less than a month, news of Spirit Hub Mountain becoming a True Inheritor Daoist Temple of the Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect spread like wildfire within a million-mile radius centered around the mountain. As time passed, it even showed signs of propagating to more distant lands.

***

Tens of thousands of miles away.

Twilight deepened. In the eerie silence, ancient trees reaching for the sky on both banks faintly revealed grotesque forms, clawing and baring teeth like demons or ghosts, exuding a faint, blood-tinged murderous aura. The sight sent shivers down one's spine.

Suddenly, a flurry of panicked footsteps, accompanied by ragged breaths, echoed through the vast ancient forest. The silence was broken. Following the sounds, two rather disheveled figures came into view. Behind them, a dark demonic wind howled, obscuring vision and stirring up a tempest of sand and碎stone, relentlessly pursuing them. Within the demonic wind, two bright, blood-red eyes, as large as lanterns, slowly glowed.

"Hehehe, what a beautiful lass. How about you come back to White Fur Cave with this lord and have some fun? This lord will surely cherish you well."

"Niece, don't give up." The middle-aged man panted heavily while struggling to comfort the seventeen or eighteen-year-old girl beside him. He instinctively glanced back. The demonic wind was getting closer and closer! A faint, putrid stench began to waft into his nostrils. In an instant, the last shred of spiritual power in his dantian was squeezed out.

On the ancient path in the forest, long devoid of human traces, the two figures suddenly transformed into beams of light, streaking forward at a frantic pace. The surrounding scenery was rapidly left behind. However, the black demonic wind relentlessly pursuing them also accelerated, maintaining a distance of within a hundred *zhang*, as if toying with its prey.

Just as the father and daughter were on the verge of despair, "You vile beast, how dare you!" a mighty roar suddenly resounded through the forest. The next moment, a magical treasure flying sword, shaped like a swimming fish and imbued with a chilling killing intent, abruptly appeared in mid-air. It then transformed into a dazzling sword light and, with lightning speed, slashed towards the colossal figure within the dark demonic wind.

*Roar!*

An excruciating roar suddenly erupted from the desolate ancient forest.

Not long after, within a dilapidated temple, flickering firelight danced across the faces of the three people.

"You two, with mere Golden Core stage cultivation, dare to enter the Misty Ancient Forest forbidden zone? Don't you know how terrifying the demonic beasts here are?" a robust man, with five magical flying swords floating behind him, reprimanded the father and daughter with cold eyes.

Hearing this, a hint of terror flickered across the girl's face. The robust man's words seemed to have stirred up some unpleasant memories.

Beside the girl, the middle-aged man's face involuntarily showed a bitter smile. He cupped his hands and replied, "To answer your excellency, my daughter and I come from the Great Song Kingdom, tens of thousands of miles away. In our haste to save time, we inadvertently strayed into this forbidden zone and almost lost our lives."

"We must thank your excellency for your timely intervention!" Saying this, the middle-aged man stood up, leading the young girl beside him, and bowed deeply to the robust man.

Across from them, "No wonder!" A look of realization flashed in the robust man's eyes. He waved his hand, saying dismissively, "It was nothing, merely a small effort. That beast was my target for this trip anyway."

As soon as he finished speaking, he seemed to recall something and looked at the father and daughter with curiosity. "By the way, where are you two headed in such a hurry?"

Upon his words, the father and daughter both looked at him in surprise.

"Your excellency, don't you know? In two months, a True Inheritor of the Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect will open their Daoist Temple for a sermon. At that time, anyone, regardless of identity, can go and listen."

"This place is still about a million miles from that esteemed being's Daoist Temple, so time is pressing. My daughter is still young; she absolutely cannot miss this great opportunity." As he spoke, the middle-aged man looked at the young girl beside him with tender eyes.

"A sermon by a True Inheritor of an Immortal Orthodoxy – the Grand Unity Immeasurable Dao Sect? Anyone can listen?" A surge of excitement flashed in the robust man's eyes. He couldn't believe such an opportunity had fallen into his lap. In his early years, he had traveled to several other Human Race Heavenly Realms, gaining extensive knowledge. He naturally understood how terrifying the True Inheritors of the Seven Great Immortal Orthodoxies truly were.

It was no exaggeration to say that they were beings with the most transcendent talents and aptitudes among billions upon billions of humans. Their comprehension of the Dao and their cultivation experience—how precious were they?

Thinking of this, the robust man immediately stood up, glanced at the father and daughter still resting on the ground, and said, feigning calmness, "Alright, since time is pressing, let's depart quickly, shall we? Don't delay any further. I'll join you two this time!"

In an infinitely prosperous Immortal City.

Immortal light lingered, and immortal energy permeated the air. Among the bustling crowds in the city, Golden Core stage cultivators were ubiquitous, and Dharma Manifestation stage experts were not few. Powerful auras intertwined, making the vast immortal spiritual energy feel as if it were on the verge of boiling.

In the shops lining the streets, spiritual elixirs, immortal medicines, rare treasures, and exotic artifacts emitted immortal light that was dazzling to the eye. The largest immortal city Zhang Jing had seen before, Three Origin City, was like heaven and earth compared to this city. There was no comparison between the two.

Right in the center of the Immortal City, a thousand-story Sky-Piercing Treasure Pavilion rose from the ground, radiating a rosy glow visible clearly from thousands of miles away even in broad daylight. This was the renowned Grand Unity Pavilion!

At this moment, in the highest hall of the Grand Unity Pavilion, a handsome man, his entire body suffused with the terrifying aura of the Dao Integration stage, sat at the top. His eyes were half-closed, occasionally glinting with profound light. Below him, two other Dao Integration stage men sat facing each other, both with thoughtful expressions on their faces.

"Senior Brother, the Spirit Hub Mountain Daoist Temple has just been established. What kind of congratulatory gifts should our Grand Unity Pavilion prepare?" one of the men asked softly, smiling as he looked up.

"What are your thoughts, Junior Brother Long?"

Hearing this, the handsome man seated at the very top did not immediately reply. Instead, he directly looked at another cold-faced young man.

"This junior brother has no other opinions," the cold-faced man paused, then explained, "According to the information we've gathered, the True Inheritor who established the Daoist Temple on Spirit Hub Mountain is Zhang Jing of the Vermilion Bright Grand Clear Grotto-Heaven."

"Although his cultivation is only at the Golden Core stage, he is a direct disciple of Revered Yuan Ming. It's likely that his usual contacts are either other True Inheritors or Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs. What could we possibly have that would catch his eye?"

"Given this, it would be better to simply prepare some casual gifts to convey our sentiments."

Upon hearing these words, the handsome man above him's eyes flickered slightly. "Junior Brother's words are not without reason. However, the gift may not need to be precious, but it cannot be arbitrary. After all, that individual is, in the end, a True Inheritor!"

Yellow Sand Dharma Realm.

"Junior Brother Qiu Han, how did it go this time? Did you pass the Grand Unity Pavilion's assessment?" A man in a green robe slowly entered the cave dwelling, his gaze falling upon a young figure before him, asking with a smile.

Hearing this, Qiu Han forced a strained smile and sighed, saying,

***

"I've disappointed Senior Brother. There were ten spots, and over three thousand Golden Core stage disciples from seven major Dharma Realms, including our Yellow Sand Dharma Realm, competed for them. This junior brother truly was willing but powerless."

"Haha." The green-robed man chuckled as if he had expected it. Then he consoled him, "Junior Brother, don't be disheartened. You've only been in the Upper Realm for a few decades, and your cultivation has just broken through to the Golden Core stage. In terms of foundation, you are far behind many other junior brothers. It's perfectly normal not to win this competition."

"Anyone else in your shoes would have the same result."

"Thank you for your comfort, Senior Brother," Qiu Han cupped his hands, saying gratefully. The expression on his face eased slightly.

At one moment, a young figure flashed through his mind. "If it were Junior Brother Zhang Jing from Dragon Lake Daoist Academy, passing the assessment would surely be as easy as reaching into a bag for something. I wonder what his current cultivation is..."

Just as he was pondering, the green-robed man's words rang out again, pulling Qiu Han's thoughts back to reality. "Oh, by the way, Junior Brother, I specifically came to tell you some good news this time."

"Good news?" Qiu Han looked at him confused.

"Indeed!" The green-robed man nodded heavily, unable to suppress a hint of excitement on his face. "About a month ago, a True Inheritor from our Dao Sect descended upon a place nearby called Spirit Hub Mountain and established a Daoist Temple. In another two months, that esteemed one will give a sermon at the Daoist Temple."

"A True Inheritor personally lecturing on the Dao of cultivation—if you and I can comprehend anything from it, it will be a priceless treasure for the rest of our lives!"

"You absolutely cannot miss this opportunity, Junior Brother, remember that." The man said earnestly.

"This junior brother understands, thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother." Qiu Han took a deep breath, forcibly suppressing the excitement in his heart, and said gratefully.

It was the legendary True Inheritor! An existence whom even the Lord of the Yellow Sand Dharma Realm would greet with utmost respect, and now he had the chance to personally listen to their sermon?

At this moment, Qiu Han suddenly felt as if he had been struck by an immense surprise. The sense of loss he had felt earlier for not passing the Grand Unity Pavilion's assessment quietly vanished without a trace.

Tong Ming Blessed Land.

In a certain cave dwelling, a voice suddenly echoed, carrying an undeniable tone. "Junior Brother, make sure to arrange your time well. In two months, we are to go to Spirit Hub Mountain Daoist Temple to pay respects to True Inheritor Senior Brother. Do not delay."

***

"This junior brother understands!"

A month passed quietly.

In the main hall of Spirit Hub Mountain Daoist Temple's primary peak, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged at the top. Six layers of six-colored auspicious clouds floated behind his head, and bright, profound immortal light flowed, radiating an extremely abstruse essence. A mere glance at him gave one a wondrous feeling of profound clarity and enlightenment of the true Dao.

Below him, Deer Thirty-Eight and the Ice Crystal Immortal Spirit, Bing Liangliang, were reporting various matters, one after another.

"Master, I have already planted those immortal roots in the most suitable places on the immortal peak according to their respective characteristics. Currently, all the immortal root seeds are growing very well and will soon sprout immortal saplings."

"It's just—" Deer Thirty-Eight hesitated.

"Speak freely," Zhang Jing smiled faintly, his expression unperturbed.

"To report to Master, there are no spiritual springs here like there were on the immortal island before, so the growth of these immortal roots is still not as rapid as the Three-Light Flat Peach Tree and the Seven Treasures Gourd Vine on the immortal island."

After speaking, Deer Thirty-Eight unconsciously lowered his head.

"This is easy to resolve. Later, I will have the power of the earth veins beneath the Daoist Temple converge towards your immortal peak; the effect won't be much different," Zhang Jing said gently.

"Thank you, Master!"

"Master, the clan leader has already arranged for clan members to guard the immortal root spiritual peak! Also, our Daoist Temple's mountain gate and other main peaks will have clan members on duty and managing them," Bing Liangliang said eagerly, puffing out her small chest. As she spoke, her gem-like eyes blinked at Zhang Jing, seemingly awaiting her master's praise.

"Well done," Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction.

Then, his gaze swept over Deer Thirty-Eight and Bing Liangliang below. He was about to say something when, unexpectedly, a grand Daoist sound suddenly echoed in his mind: "Zhang Jing, come quickly to my Dao Palace."

Upon hearing this, Zhang Jing's expression froze slightly. Why would Master suddenly summon him at this time? It must be something important. But—

"There are less than two months left until the promised opening of the Daoist Temple for the sermon. I wonder if this will cause a delay? Never mind, I can't worry about that now; Master's matter is more important."

"I should have refined that Nine-Aperture Stone Embryo into a clone earlier," Zhang Jing thought to himself.

Not long after, "Master, you called for me?" Han Sheng gently walked into the main hall and bowed to Zhang Jing.

***

"I am going to the Grotto-Heaven for a trip. I cannot be certain how long this journey will take. If I have not returned in two months, Han Sheng, you are to open the Daoist Temple directly and have those who come to listen to the sermon wait. During this period, if anyone dares to cause trouble, say nothing more—just kill them!" Zhang Jing instructed. His tone at the end carried a chilling coldness.

"Please rest assured, Master, Han Sheng knows what to do," Han Sheng replied respectfully. He looked up. A finger, clear and jade-like, grew larger and larger in his vision.

"This—" Han Sheng's face immediately flashed with astonishment, but he did not retreat a single step.

The next moment, a terrifying grand formation encompassing the Daoist Temple appeared in his perception. The cold, vast killing intent permeating it made him even smell a rich scent of death.

"This is the Daoist Temple's guardian grand formation. I will hand its control over to you," Zhang Jing's calm voice echoed in the main hall.

"Yes, Master!"

Half an hour later, a bright beam of light suddenly flew out from Spirit Hub Mountain Daoist Temple, then pierced straight into the thick cloud layers and disappeared.

In the immeasurable heights of the Vermilion Bright Grand Clear Grotto-Heaven.

Within a bronze immortal palace, floating in the profound void, eight figures, their entire bodies wrapped in immeasurable immortal light, stood in two rows. The front row consisted of four formal direct disciples, including Senior Sister Kong, while the other four True Inheritors, who were merely registered disciples of True Monarch Yuan Ming, naturally sat in the second row. Four gazes occasionally swept over an empty futon in the first row, brimming with unconcealed envy.
