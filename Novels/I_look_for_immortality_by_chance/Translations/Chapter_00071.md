# Chapter 71: Strange Fragrance, Entering the Mountain (Combined)

As soon as these words were spoken, everyone's gaze turned toward the female disciple surnamed Yun.  

"Senior Brother Lin, our journey to Feilang Mountain is to compete for spiritual peaks. Although I may not be particularly talented, I still wish to become the master of a spiritual peak. If we encounter any disputes while traveling together, could you yield to me, your junior sister?"  

The female cultivator surnamed Yun turned her head with a charming smile, but her tone carried an aggressive edge.  

The disciple from the aristocratic family was momentarily stunned. He wanted to boast a few bold words but, remembering his family elder's instructions, he could only hold his tongue.  

A single spiritual peak could produce several hundred spirit stones annually, with long-term benefits. Over a decade, that would amount to thousands of spirit stones.  

While disciples from aristocratic families had higher starting points and better backgrounds than those from humble origins, not all aristocratic families were wealthy. How could thousands of spirit stones be casually given away?  

A few hundred spirit stones might be acceptable to win a beauty's smile, but an entire spiritual peak? He didn’t dare make such an offer.  

"Hmph, Senior Sister Yun is about to join the Alchemy Hall. Unless you’re from one of the Five Great Clans or the Seven Lineages, don’t spout nonsense here—it’s just embarrassing."  

Seeing the aristocratic disciple humiliated, the lively and charming young girl beside Yun smirked proudly, as if sharing in the glory.  

The humble disciples watching nearby also chuckled softly.  

"The Five Great Clans are all Golden Core families with profound foundations. Why would they compete for a first-tier spiritual peak?"  

"Exactly. The Seven Lineages’ direct disciples are prodigies who face no bottlenecks in Qi Refinement. They’re all waiting to break through to Foundation Establishment—why would they board the Dragonfang Treasure Ship?"  

"Some people, having inherited a bit of their ancestors’ legacy, think they’re heaven’s chosen. What a joke."  

On the Dragonfang Treasure Ship, several humble disciples who had already become apprentices to Foundation Establishment cultivators spoke up, their voices laced with mockery.  

Normally, they couldn’t stand the arrogance of these aristocratic disciples. Now that they finally had a chance to strike back, they wouldn’t let it slip.  

Meanwhile, in the corners, the humble disciples who hadn’t become apprentices closed their eyes and meditated, staying out of the conflict.  

"Empty words."  

"At Feilang Mountain, we’ll see who’s truly skilled."  

"We inherit our ancestors’ legacies, and we carry their brilliance. As for you, always boasting about your talent—let’s see how much of it is real."  

Among the aristocratic disciples, a tall young man coldly retorted, putting an end to the verbal sparring.  

Afterward, everyone returned to their small groups, chatting among themselves and ceasing the argument.  

However, several humble disciples who had already become apprentices gathered around the female cultivator surnamed Yun, laughing and chatting as if the atmosphere was quite harmonious.  

---

After witnessing that scene, the woman’s impression in their minds had greatly improved.  

Gu Yuan, sitting alone in the corner, couldn’t help but glance at her again.  

"Qi Refinement seventh layer, surnamed Yun, and about to join the Alchemy Hall… Could she be the one Xiao Cai’er tried to match me with?"  

"But… there’s something strange about her."  

Gu Yuan pondered silently.  

He had looked at her several times—not because of her beauty or alluring figure, nor because of any supposed fate between them, but because of the strange "color" he saw on her.  

The *Zhaotian Spirit Eye* could dispel illusions and see through the trajectories of many phenomena, making it incredibly profound.  

The moment this woman appeared, Gu Yuan noticed the "fragrance" she carried.  

The scent was faint but persistent, drifting slowly through the air and settling on the cultivators around her with the wind’s movement.  

The fragrance was extremely subtle, devoid of any spiritual energy, as if it were entirely natural. The others were completely unaware of it.  

Gu Yuan’s spiritual sense and nose hadn’t detected it either.  

But the *Zhaotian Spirit Eye* clearly saw the traces of the fragrance’s dispersion.  

"What a hidden fragrance—far more refined than the *Shi Po Xiang* I encountered at Moon Bamboo Market. Without the *Zhaotian Spirit Eye*, I doubt any Qi Refinement cultivator could detect it."  

Perfume-making was one of the hundred arts of cultivation.  

Good fragrances could enhance one’s spiritual power and awareness, acting as great supplements.  

Evil fragrances, however, were insidious and toxic—inhaling even a whiff could cause internal organs to rot and kill a cultivator.  

However, the art of fragrance was a minor path. Unless mastered to an exquisite degree, it couldn’t evade a cultivator’s spiritual sense, rendering it useless.  

This young woman’s skill in fragrance was already highly advanced, ranking among the upper echelons even in the *Bandit’s Treasure Codex*. It could conceal itself from the spiritual senses of cultivators at the same level or even higher.  

It had already grasped the essence of the "concealment" principle in the *Bandit’s Treasure Codex*.  

Yet, it still hadn’t escaped Gu Yuan’s notice.  

"Marking others with fragrance… Does she have some scheme in mind?"  

Gu Yuan felt both wary and curious, but he didn’t warn the others. He stopped looking at Yun Hanxiu, closed his eyes, and began meditating silently.  

The journey to Feilang Mountain was bound to be filled with all sorts of strange characters. But whatever came his way, he would face it head-on.

**Boom!**  

After an unknown amount of time, the roar of rushing water jolted everyone awake.  

Below the treasure ship, the clear and calm lake had been replaced by a raging, blood-red river.  

The river was crimson, winding like a crescent moon.  

"The Scarlet Moon River—we’ve entered the territory of the Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes!"  

Someone on the ship shouted upon seeing the scarlet river below.  

The water of the Scarlet Moon River wasn’t actually red—if scooped up, it would appear clear and transparent. The illusion of a blood river came from the crimson riverbed.  

Legend had it that in ancient times, a great demon had died in battle here. Its bloody skeleton collapsed into the mountains, forming the riverbed’s ore. After heavy rains, the Scarlet Moon River was born.  

On either side of the river stretched endless mountain ranges, covered in snow and echoing with the roars of beasts.  

As the treasure ship advanced, a massive and peculiar mountain range came into view.  

**Boom!**  

**Boom!**  

It was an imposing mountain, towering and majestic, with countless peaks—one hundred and eight in total.  

From each peak, a roaring waterfall cascaded down.  

The combined roar of one hundred and eight waterfalls made the entire mountain seem to tremble.  

Mist from the falls, mixed with snowflakes swept up by fierce winds, formed a surreal icy fog that shrouded the mountain like a celestial realm.  

"Waterfalls soaring into the clouds, mountains resonating in harmony—this is Feilang Mountain!"  

Someone on the ship couldn’t help but marvel at the sight.  

Gu Yuan stepped to the deck’s edge, momentarily entranced by the breathtaking scenery.  

How wonderful would it be if such a magnificent spiritual mountain belonged to him?  

"Feilang Mountain has been reached. The battlefield is divided into east and west by Spirit Ape Valley. The eastern sector is for disciples below Qi Refinement sixth layer, while the western sector is for those above."  

"Remember, you must plant a formation disk and maintain it for a full day to claim a spiritual peak!"  

"The Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes haven’t fully withdrawn—there are still powerful demons in the mountains. Do not let your guard down."  

"This campaign lasts ten days. May you all return safely."  

"Now, go!"  

A majestic voice echoed from the sky.  

The treasure ships split, carrying different disciples to the east and west sectors.  

Then, the sound of war drums erupted, urging them to move.  

"Senior brothers, I’ll take the first step!"  

A humble disciple who had already become an apprentice laughed heartily. Without even riding a Cloudsoar Crane, he summoned a cyan streak of light and shot toward a spiritual peak at incredible speed.  

One formation disk, one spiritual peak.  

Those confident in their strength acted alone, seeking no allies, aiming to claim a peak for themselves.  

But others, fearing they lacked the strength, sought companions.  

"Junior Sister Yun, why not join forces? First, we’ll subdue the demons and seize a peak, splitting the profits equally. Once we have strength to spare, we can take a second peak?"  

Someone on the ship proposed to Yun Hanxiu.  

"Thank you for the offer, Senior Brother, but I’d prefer to be the sole master of a peak."  

"Besides, the Dao is walked alone. If disputes arise, it would only sour things."  

"It’d be best if you didn’t compete with me for the same peak."  

Yun Hanxiu shook her head. She didn’t even team up with the girl beside her, instead riding a Cloudsoar Crane alone toward a distant peak.  

With one hundred and eight peaks, the numbers seemed vast, but the number of summoned cultivators was also large. It was impossible for everyone to claim a peak alone—competition was inevitable.  

However, some peaks were better than others, and choices varied, affecting the intensity of the struggle.  

Whether through alliances or sheer dominance, success depended on strength and strategy.  

The battlefield was set.  

Seeing Yun Hanxiu reject him, the disciple was taken aback but soon shook his head and teamed up with another companion to head for a different peak.  

Meanwhile, the aristocratic disciples gathered in small groups, heading toward their chosen targets as planned.  

The aristocratic disciple who had first invited Yun Hanxiu exchanged a glance with his companion, then smirked coldly and chased after her.  

Two humble disciples hesitated before following the pair’s trail.  

For that single peak, five cultivators had already descended.  

Before even encountering the demons, the situation had grown complicated.  

---

Some disciples on the ship hesitated, unsure which peak to choose.  

Feilang Mountain had one hundred and eight peaks, divided by Spirit Ape Valley. The eastern sector had fifty lower-tier peaks with modest yields and weaker demons, assigned to disciples below Qi Refinement sixth layer.  

The western sector had fifty-eight peaks, including eight top-tier, twenty upper-tier, and thirty mid-tier peaks.  

The eight top-tier peaks were destined for the fiercest competition.  

Not just Qi Refinement ninth-layer cultivators, but even some formidable aristocratic disciples at the eighth layer dared to challenge them.  

After all, at the Qi Refinement stage, exceptional techniques could bridge the gap between levels.  

Ordinary disciples could only compete for the fifty mid- to upper-tier peaks.  

Hundreds of cultivators vying for fifty peaks, plus the demons in the mountains—this was bound to be a chaotic battle.  

And the Dao Sect had given them only five days.  

In that time, they had to subdue the demons, defeat their peers, plant formation disks, and hold their ground for a full day. Time was tight.  

For ordinary disciples, choosing the right peak was crucial. Picking poorly could mean wasting effort fighting demons only to lose to rivals.  

But Gu Yuan didn’t hesitate. He casually selected an upper-tier peak and descended.  

No matter how complex the situation, it was still just a battle among Qi Refinement cultivators…  

As long as he avoided the top-tier peaks, Gu Yuan was confident.  

---

**Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!**  

Before Gu Yuan even landed, he was attacked.  

Dozens of water arrows, each as wide as a bowl, shot from beneath the waterfall, piercing through the icy mist to rain down on him.  

**Clang!**  

With a thought, the *Black Tortoise Seal* emerged, its heavy aura forming a barrier before him.  

But though the water arrows weren’t overwhelmingly powerful, their sheer numbers were daunting. After the first volley, a second followed—over a hundred arrows striking with considerable force.  

The *Black Tortoise Seal* groaned under the assault, struggling to hold.  

**Hum!**  

Gu Yuan remained still, merely activating the *Lesser Giant God Seal* in his dantian.  

The *Black Tortoise Seal* instantly glowed as if invigorated, its golden radiance intensifying. Runes flickered across its shell, bolstering its defense like an impenetrable curtain.  

**Clang! Clang! Clang!**  

The water arrows struck futilely.  

Gu Yuan’s descent didn’t falter. He landed at the mountain’s base and saw his attackers.  

Dozens of green toads, led by a blue-furred ape, stood in orderly ranks like an army, launching their assault.  

**Swoosh! Swoosh! Swoosh!**  

Behind the toads, yellow mountain deer extended their antlers, firing strange beams of demonic light.  

**Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!**  

Behind the deer, swarms of black bats exhaled dark smoke, swiftly forming a black cloud that enveloped Gu Yuan.  

Elsewhere on the peak, more demons watched cautiously from hiding.  

"Interesting. They’ve truly united… making me seem like the villain here."  

Gu Yuan chuckled at the sight of the demonic horde.  

But calling him the villain wasn’t entirely wrong.  

The Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes had previously ruled Feilang Mountain loosely, only demanding tributes of spiritual herbs from the mountain’s demons.  

Now, Gu Yuan and the others sought to plant formation disks, fully claiming the mountain for the Dao Sect and seizing all its resources.  

To the demons, the cultivators were the invaders. A few words from the Azurefire Golden-Eyed Apes had rallied them against the newcomers.  

"But in the struggle for the Dao, there’s no true good or evil. No one can blame the other…"  

Gu Yuan sighed inwardly, then exhaled sharply.  

Dense fog and torrential rain instantly engulfed the area within a ten-zhang radius.  

**Screech! Screech!**  

The demons panicked, their cries filling the air.  

The *Cloudwalking Mist Seal* was a formidable tool for chaotic battles. Unless their strength surpassed Gu Yuan’s, the demons couldn’t pierce the fog. Trapped inside, their techniques were suppressed.  

**Roar!**  

A crimson fire dragon coiled through the mist, striking and stunning the demons without killing them.  

These creatures were the mountain’s living assets—slaughtering them now would be shortsighted.  

In moments, the demonic forces at the mountain’s base were scattered.  

But just then, a golden light pierced the fog, carrying an overwhelming force as it shot toward Gu Yuan’s eyes.
