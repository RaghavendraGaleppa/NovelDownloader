# Chapter 1: The Child Scholar

"Last night the strong wind blew with a rain fine;  
Sound sleep did not dispel the aftertaste of wine.  
I ask the maid rolling up the screen.  
'The same crabapple,' says she, 'can be seen.'  
'But don't you know,  
Oh, don't you know  
The red should languish and the green should grow?'"

In Jiangzhou City, the pawnshop manager of Lin's Pawnshop carefully examined this short lyric written on a piece of hemp paper.

Though he hadn't studied for many years and hadn't even passed the prefectural examination, he could still appreciate the beauty of this lyric. It rolled off the tongue pleasantly, leaving a lingering fragrance. Unfortunately, the hemp paper couldn't absorb ink well, so the writing didn't fully convey the lyric's elegance. Yet each stroke was upright and classical, showing the writer's considerable calligraphic skill.

Looking at the thin, pale-faced youth in ordinary clothes before him, Manager Lin asked, "May I ask who wrote this lyric, young master?"

"My teacher was overcome by a craving for wine and composed this lyric in hopes of exchanging it for money to buy a jug of wine."

Manager Lin was surprised. "You're pawning this just for wine money?"

The youth nodded, appearing somewhat inarticulate and dull.

After some thought, Manager Lin said, "Then I'll offer two hundred coins for this lyric. Is that acceptable?"

Pawnshops didn't usually accept just anything, but he thought the young mistress might like this lyric. The people of Jiangzhou loved singing and dancing—wherever there was water, someone would be singing lyrics. This one was so catchy that if it were an old piece, he would have heard it before. Clearly, it was new.

Spending two hundred coins for a lyric to please the young mistress would benefit him as the manager.

The youth hesitated. "But this single sheet of hemp paper is worth thirty coins."

Thirty coins could feed an urban family for nearly two days. Though paper wasn't easy to make, hemp paper couldn't compare to finer Zuo Bo paper, which cost thirty coins. Moreover, this small sheet had clearly been cut several times, with the lyric taking up more than half its space, so its actual value was far below thirty coins.

But bargaining was normal in business. Recognizing the youth's attempt to raise the price, Manager Lin reconsidered. "How about I add another twenty coins?"

"Deal." The youth didn't bargain further.

Manager Lin was satisfied and paid from his own pocket. This transaction wouldn't go through the pawnshop's books—using shop funds to curry favor with the young mistress would be foolish.

The owner of Lin's Pawnshop was Old Squire Lin of the city. The young mistress was his granddaughter and now managed most of the family business. As his only descendant, the old squire wanted to find her a scholarly son-in-law with no family ties—a difficult condition, which was why the seventeen-year-old young mistress remained unmarried.

Money exchanged, the youth returned to a messy, remote alley. This was Zhou Qing's third day in this world. With his parents recently deceased and the funeral expenses paid, his family was now destitute.

The Zhou family had once had savings, spent on Zhou Qing's education and medical expenses during his elders' illnesses. After the funeral, they were left with nothing but bare walls. The hemp paper and last bit of ink were among the few possessions left by his body's former owner.

As a graduate in Classical Chinese Literature who had just finished school and hadn't yet taken civil service exams, arriving in this ancient world had been bewildering. Fortunately, the memories of his body's former owner helped him understand his situation.

The current dynasty, Great Zhou, wasn't part of any history he knew. Established 150 years ago, it selected officials through imperial examinations. Zhou Qing was now a child scholar. With these 220 coins, he could buy more ink and brushes to take the upcoming prefectural examination and become a xiucai (scholar), exempting him from corvée labor and making travel easier.

In this era, both studying and martial arts required significant wealth, but scholarship offered better prospects for commoners. The imperial examination system, though imperfect, was one of the few relatively fair paths upward.

Due to his transmigration and the fusion of two souls, Zhou Qing's memory had greatly improved, reaching near-photographic levels. Combined with his Classical Chinese background, his chances of passing the prefectural exam were high.

After eating a small pot of plain rice porridge, Zhou Qing considered his options. The 220 coins from pawning weren't much, but without first obtaining xiucai status, any other money-making venture would draw unwanted attention.

He had chosen Lin's Pawnshop deliberately. Old Squire Lin's granddaughter, who now managed the family business, was rumored to be a literary enthusiast. He was confident his lyric would impress her, and the manager would recognize its value—hence his successful transaction.

With three days left until the exam (for which he'd already registered), Zhou Qing focused on preparation. The mourning period for his parents was twenty-seven months, during which he couldn't marry, take office, or visit entertainment venues—but other activities, like examinations, were permitted.

Passing the exam would make him a xiucai, divided into stipendiary scholars (supported by the government) and supplementary scholars (unsupported). The so-called "poor scholars" usually referred to the latter. Both types could take the provincial examinations, but preparing for them was expensive—repeated failures could bankrupt even a well-off family.

A xiucai willing to abandon the examination path and find other work wouldn't be destitute, but without that status, Zhou Qing's situation would be dire.

"Sigh." He sighed. "Low qualifications make job-hunting hard in any era."

For the next three days, Zhou Qing only went out to buy examination supplies. The prefectural exam in Jiangzhou usually focused on poetry, while higher-level exams emphasized eight-legged essays (stereotypical examination essays). The palace examination tested policy discussions on state affairs. Thus, the examination path required both conformity to rigid essay structures and broad perspectives for policy discussions—like performing a religious ceremony in a snail's shell.

As Zhou Qing reviewed examination-related texts, memories from both lives flowed like water, with classical poems and essays surfacing vividly in his mind. His pale, malnourished face even gained some vitality. His clear reading voice from the shabby alley quieted the noisy surroundings. Neighbors who had thought Zhou Qing, now alone after his family's tragedy, would fail the exam and remain a child scholar subject to corvée labor, now felt a hint of respect and hushed their children.

The alley near Zhou Qing's home took on an air of propriety, though Zhou Qing paid no attention—soon, it was examination day.

If there were no surprises, it wouldn't be life.

Zhou Qing had expected this year's exam to focus on poetry as usual, but the entire examination hall erupted in groans—this year tested eight-legged essays.

Though the child scholars had some exposure to eight-legged essays, the prefectural exam had always emphasized poetry, so few had prepared for this. The Jiangzhou education commissioner, realizing the region's focus on poetry had reduced its success in provincial examinations, decided to change the prefectural exam's emphasis unexpectedly. Moreover, the passing rate had been reduced from 70% to 50%.

Thus, many poetry-proficient child scholars lost their advantage, and what seemed like certain xiucai status slipped away.

Amid the groans, a chubby boy laughed.

"Wang Hai, why are you laughing?" The commissioner, who seemed to know the boy, scolded him sternly for his impropriety.

"Uncle, I—"

"I've told you many times to address me by my official title outside. Never mind—just focus on your exam." Commissioner Lu rubbed his forehead in exasperation. He had married a merchant's daughter to fund his studies. While his wife was good, her nephew was hopeless. Though Lu avoided tutoring Wang Hai privately, he had suggested the Wang family have him study eight-legged essays.

Eight-legged essays focused on classical interpretations with parallel structures. Unlike the strict, formulaic essays of Zhou Qing's previous world's Ming and Qing dynasties, these allowed some creative freedom.

When the exam questions were distributed, Wang Hai—a merchant's son poor at poetry but not stupid—had been drilled in eight-legged essays by tutors. Though lazy, he could now compose passable essays, putting him ahead of half the unprepared candidates.

Restless by nature, Wang Hai glanced around and saw a candidate writing rapidly. Though he couldn't see the content from a distance, he was shocked. While others struggled, this candidate finished in under fifteen minutes.

The question, from the Analects, asked about Confucius telling Yan Hui, "When the time is right, act; when it's not, withdraw. Only you and I can do this."

Zhou Qing finished and submitted his paper within half an hour, astonishing the examiners. In his current obscurity, this bold move was calculated. The sudden change to eight-legged essays presented an opportunity. Though risky, impressing the commissioner could alleviate his dire circumstances.

The essay he wrote, recalled from his past life's studies, would have been competitive even in provincial exams. He gambled that the commissioner would value an eight-legged essay prodigy. Even if wrong, he'd still likely pass as a xiucai. Standing out might draw attention, but an aloof, talented persona fit his poor scholar image.

As the first to submit, Zhou Qing was summoned by Commissioner Lu for questioning—exactly as planned. A good impression could smooth his academic path, while a misstep might isolate him among scholars. But with his current rock-bottom situation, what did he have to lose?

Even among poor scholars, a destitute, unknown xiucai was vulnerable to bullying. The ancient saying "A true man dines from five tripods in life or is boiled in them after death" surely came from someone in Zhou Qing's position.

Zhou Qing wasn't that extreme. Nervous but composed, he bowed to the commissioner, whose influence as head of the region's education and scholar registry was substantial. As Zhou Qing bowed, Commissioner Lu quickly read his essay, his experienced eyes assessing its quality:

"The sage's adaptability in action and withdrawal awaits the capable to subtly reveal. Indeed, the sage's ways of action and withdrawal are hard to discern—only with Yanzi nearing understanding could they be discussed..."
