# Chapter 66: Possessed by Evil Energy? That's It?

Outside Shuangjiu City.

A battle between Immortals erupted abruptly!

The heavens and earth changed colors as winds scattered the clouds!
The already dim sky was churned into utter darkness by the overwhelming aftershocks of the battle!
Even the sunlight seemed to have been shattered!

Facing the master of Guyue Peak were three Immortal-level existences—three helmsmen of the Golden Ship of Salvation joining forces!

At this moment, the elders of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect within the city sought aid from various factions. With the Great Zhou Dynasty's approval, all parties reached a consensus to form a grand formation to assist the leader of Guyue Peak.

After all, the Yu Hua Immortal Sect was one of the three great orthodox sects. They had once collaborated with other factions to establish Shuangjiu City and jointly suppress the northern Yin-Evil energy, making them allies.

In contrast, the Golden Ship of Salvation was the common enemy of all factions and was likely the culprit behind the collapse of Fengdu Mountain in the past.

"Join forces to form the formation and aid the leader of Guyue Peak!"

Just as the leaders of various factions agreed to activate Shuangjiu City's formation to assist, columns of Yin-Evil energy suddenly surged from multiple locations within the city!

Booming sounds echoed as dark, malevolent energy shot into the sky like towering pillars.

Thirty-two eruptions of evil energy occurred simultaneously, all at critical points of the city's defensive formation.

"What's happening? How did evil energy appear inside the city?"

"Quickly expel the evil energy! If it corrupts the city's formation, the consequences will be dire!"

Chaos erupted as the factions scrambled to deal with the sudden crisis.

At that moment, a voice resounded across the heavens from a hundred miles away:

"These three demons are already trapped within my Daoist technique and cannot escape. There is no need for assistance..."

The voice of the Guyue Peak master continued: "Purge the evil energy in the city! The formation must not be compromised!"

Following the Immortal's command, the factions no longer hesitated and returned to their respective posts to suppress the evil energy.

The elders and disciples of the Yu Hua Immortal Sect also dispersed to deal with the crisis.

However, the timing and nature of the outbreak were so suspicious that it sparked countless speculations.

"Previously, the northern Yin-Evil energy would surge like tides, and we would work together to repel it, preventing it from spreading across the Great Zhou's territory..."

"But this time, the evil energy didn't come from the north—it erupted from within the city!"

"This was premeditated!"

"Are there 'Water Ghosts' or even 'Boatmen' from the Golden Ship hiding in the city?"

"Not all thirty-two outbreaks were caused by the Golden Ship. Other factions might have taken advantage to eliminate the leader of Guyue Peak..."

"Yet none expected the Guyue Peak master to be so powerful, single-handedly overpowering three enemies!"

Despite their suspicions, none dared delay further.

Meanwhile, the Yu Hua elder who had arranged accommodations for the disciples hurried to Li Zhengjing's courtyard, his expression grim as he watched the evil energy surge.

Soon, another elder arrived.

"Senior Brother, the evil energy's appearance is too suspicious. There must be traitors in the city. We can't afford to investigate now—we must use the formation to expel the energy northward immediately!"

"Agreed! Let's work together to push it out!"

The two elders joined forces, using their qi to suppress the evil energy while activating the city's formation.

The entire city trembled as if a giant dragon shaking off fleas.

From above, the thirty-two columns of evil energy were expelled northward, one after another.

Inside his courtyard, Li Zhengjing found himself engulfed in darkness. He quickly took out the luminous pearl he had obtained from Chen Youyu to illuminate his surroundings.

After grabbing the Parrot and determining the direction, he prepared to head south to escape the darkness.

But at that moment, the world spun upside down!

Both man and bird were thrown into disarray.

"Master! Hold on tight! Don't let go!"

"I know!"

Li Zhengjing clutched the Parrot with one hand and the Wutong Wooden Box with the other, feeling himself tumbling uncontrollably through the air.

"What the hell is happening?!" he cursed inwardly.

Suddenly, the Parrot's eyes gleamed like flames—its innate divine vision piercing through the darkness.

"Master! Let go! We're going to crash!" the Parrot shrieked, its feathers standing on end.

"Let go my ass! You want me to die?!" Li Zhengjing roared, channeling his internal qi. "Use your damn wings and fly!"

He tightened his grip on the Parrot's green dragon horns, refusing to release it.

The Parrot flapped its wings desperately, but the constant spinning made flying impossible. Still, it managed to slow their descent slightly.

Then—thud!

They crashed hard onto the ground, rolling apart.

Li Zhengjing felt as though his organs had been rearranged. He spat out blood, his vision swimming as he lay there, dazed and weak.

Back in Shuangjiu City, the courtyard where Li Zhengjing had stayed was now flattened.

The two elders sighed in relief. The older one hurried off to deal with other outbreaks, while the other—Elder Zhou—remained, his expression unreadable.

A disciple approached and whispered, "Elder Zhou, Elder Chen Xuan never returned to his quarters."

Elder Zhou frowned, glancing at the flattened ground. "Did Chen Xuan fail and perish at that boy's hands?"

He and Chen Xuan had been acquaintances. Learning of Chen Xuan's plan to assassinate Li Zhengjing, Elder Zhou had provided him with the "evil energy" to carry out the deed.

This way, if the outbreak was discovered, Chen Xuan would take the blame. If not, Elder Zhou could use this leverage to recruit Chen Xuan into the Golden Ship of Salvation.

If all had gone well, Chen Xuan should have been in his quarters by now, while Li Zhengjing's corpse would have been expelled with the evil energy.

The disciple beside him was meant to serve as Chen Xuan's alibi.

But Chen Xuan was missing.

"Was Li Zhengjing found?" Elder Zhou asked.

"No trace of him either."

"Good."

Elder Zhou exhaled. "If Chen Xuan is dead, so be it. Taking out that prodigy Li Zhengjing is still a victory. Once I report this, my accumulated merits over the past twenty years should earn me a 'Boarding Token.'"

With that thought, he left to suppress other outbreaks.

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing gradually regained consciousness.

"What the hell just happened?!" he groaned, vomiting up his breakfast along with blood.

His entire body ached as if his organs had been scrambled.

"If I hadn't cultivated internal qi, I'd be dead for sure..."

He struggled to his feet, thinking, "Thank the heavens for the Parrot. Without its wings slowing us down, the fall would've turned me into paste. Wait—where is that idiot bird?"

He grabbed the Wutong Wooden Box, took out a Creation Five Elements Pill, and swallowed it.

The pill's spiritual energy nourished his organs, healing his injuries and replenishing his depleted qi.

From the box, a small tree planted in a clay pot wobbled out, dizzy from the tumbling.

"Parrot! Where are you?" Li Zhengjing called out, slinging the box over his shoulder and holding the tree.

A weak voice answered from a hundred paces away: "Master... I'm cold..."

Li Zhengjing rushed over to find the green-horned, golden-feathered bird lying limp on the ground, shivering.

"What's wrong?" he asked.

"Evil energy... invaded my body," the Parrot whimpered. "It's so cold... Master, we're done for. They say the northern Yin-Evil energy can corrupt the living, turning them into the undead. Every year, people in Shuangjiu City die from this..."

Li Zhengjing's expression darkened. Rolling up his sleeve, he saw dark tendrils spreading across his skin, freezing his blood wherever they touched.

Both he and the Parrot had been exposed to the evil energy when they were expelled from the city. Injured and weakened, they were now vulnerable to its corruption.

Only the Five Elements Divine Tree, safely tucked inside the wooden box, remained unaffected.

"This..."

Li Zhengjing channeled his internal qi to resist the evil energy.

But before his qi could react, the golden page in his mind trembled.

The evil energy was instantly absorbed by the page and converted into pure spiritual energy!

To the golden page, the evil energy was no different from poison.

In an instant, warmth flooded Li Zhengjing's body, banishing all discomfort.

Meanwhile, the Parrot's body convulsed as the evil energy penetrated deeper, triggering its innate divine bloodline as a White Phoenix.

Suddenly, flames erupted from its feathers!

Moments later, the Parrot sprang up, fully revitalized.

"I thought I was a goner," it chirped, shaking its feathers. "But that was nothing!"

Li Zhengjing and the Parrot exchanged glances.

"That's it?" they said in unison.
