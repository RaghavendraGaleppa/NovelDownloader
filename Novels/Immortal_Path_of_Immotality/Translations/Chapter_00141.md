# Chapter 148: Flames Engulf the Camps

The vanguard advanced for an hour, gradually entering the depths of the jungle within the Poison Burial Great Canyon. The pitch-black night made it impossible to see one's hand in front of their face, with increasingly dense fog surrounding them and not a single star's light piercing through from above.

Fortunately, all the cultivators present had their cultivation to rely on. After spiritual transformation enhanced their senses, they could roughly perceive movements within a three-meter radius, though anything beyond that was beyond their capabilities.

Even Foundation Establishment cultivators like Lin Shan, who could extend their divine sense outward, found their spiritual perception severely hindered by the surrounding poisonous mist, reduced to a mere ten-meter range—equivalent to the sensory range of Qi Refining cultivators.

As the environment grew increasingly hostile and the toxic mist thickened, everyone kept Detoxification Pills in their mouths, advancing quietly with bated breath. No one dared to make a sound or cast illumination spells, all moving forward blindly in the dark.

To bolster the vanguard's strength, the camp had specially expanded Yan Yuanchun's forces to over a thousand. Most of the newcomers were rogue cultivators who had surrendered after recent incursions into the Great Song's territory—still cannon fodder in nature.

Their primary purpose was to pave the way—clearing paths through mountains, building bridges across rivers, and scouting ahead for dangers so the main force could avoid most threats by following the corpses and battle traces left behind, preserving their strength.

Yan Yuanchun had divided the vanguard's five Foundation Establishment teams strategically: one female cultivator led the advance team, two others protected the flanks, Lin Shan commanded the rear guard, while Luan Chun remained with Protector Yan at the center for coordination, forming a diamond-shaped formation.

No one objected to this arrangement—in the cultivation world, strength dictated authority. Luan Chun, as a direct disciple, naturally belonged in the safest position at the center; favoritism was simply human nature.

The most dangerous roles were leading the advance and guarding the rear—the former faced the highest risks as pathfinders, while the latter risked being isolated if they fell behind. This mission was arduous for everyone.

As the thousand-strong force advanced blindly, sudden screams erupted from the front, accompanied by sporadic flashes of spells—they had encountered trouble.

"Hold position! Stay alert!" Lin Shan immediately halted his hundred-strong team, all rogue cultivators who had followed him from his missionary work in the East Sea. They understood their envoy's commands perfectly.

At his raised hand, those nearby stopped instantly, the rest following suit and clustering around Lin Shan, drawing talismans and magic tools at the ready.

The surroundings remained shrouded in fog, with silence dominating the dark jungle. Only faint glimmers of light and indistinct shouts from the front occasionally pierced through the mist, barely audible to those in the rear.

---

A quarter-hour later, orders came from the central command: the advance team had encountered fierce beasts but had eliminated them. The rear guard was to proceed immediately.

Lin Shan nodded, took a headcount, and continued forward.

After advancing another kilometer or two, rustling sounds erupted from the surrounding trees as shadowy figures descended from above.

"What's that?"

"Ah! I've been bitten!"

"Get back!"

"It's poisonous!"

...

Instantly, countless protective spell barriers lit up as arrows and sword qi shot wildly in all directions.

Under the illumination, thousands of colorful venomous snakes shot from both sides, some even spitting poison.

Lin Shan didn't dare be careless—he had no idea how potent these toxins were or whether they could affect him. He immediately activated his defensive magic tool while summoning a flying sword to orbit him protectively.

The East Sea rogue cultivators, though appearing disciplined in training, were actually a disorganized rabble who scattered like startled birds at the first sign of danger. Only a few quick-witted individuals like Old Man Zhong stayed close to Lin Shan while the others fought chaotically, their screams filling the air.

His rear guard wasn't the only one in trouble—everyone ahead was similarly overwhelmed by the ambush.

After intense fighting, the ground became carpeted with snake corpses. Lin Shan darted about rescuing his men, relying on his high-grade magic tools and flying sword to protect them.

As the stench of blood and venom permeated the air, the snakes gradually dispersed.

When the battle ended a quarter-hour later, Lin Shan took stock: twelve lightly injured (all snake bites manageable with antidotes and spiritual energy suppression), five severely injured (mostly from friendly fire in the chaos), and two missing—likely lost in the dense forest with little hope of rescue.

Lin Shan sighed—mere moments into the canyon, and they'd already been battered by mere appetizers like venomous snakes, his subordinates proving utterly useless.

After regrouping, Protector Yan didn't bother with casualty reports before ordering the march to continue.

Subsequently, they faced swarms of venomous bees, mosquitoes, and ants—countless poisonous insects bred over countless years in the canyon's perpetually fog-shrouded depths.

Even cultivators weren't immune to trypophobia, flailing about with wind, fire, water, and earth spells until they finally broke through—only to stumble into a habitat of poison dart frogs.

---

"Ribbit, ribbit—"

These were no ordinary venomous creatures—each frog was equivalent to a Qi Refining-stage demon beast, with some leaders reaching Foundation Establishment.

A few were manageable, but when thousands of Qi Refining-level poison darts rained down, screams filled the air!

Protector Yan at the center could no longer remain passive. Unleashing her Golden Core cultivation, she slaughtered seven or eight Foundation Establishment frog leaders. Yet the cacophony of croaks only intensified, their synchronized calls actually affecting souls!

Many cultivators grew dizzy and weak, collapsing before they could defend against the incoming darts.

Lin Shan, helpless against such large-scale attacks, could only wrap himself and Old Man Zhong's group in his Descending Cloud Banner and Cloud-Copper barrier before charging forward.

Once they broke through, Lin Shan winced at his Cloud-Copper Mirror—now pitted and perforated by corrosive venom. Before he could ask the Black Skeleton Demon Lord hanging at his waist (an expert artificer) about repairs, he noticed spiders crawling on the damaged mirror!

"Look out! Poison spiders!" The barely-rested group erupted into panic again.

These spiders clung tenaciously to clothing and magic tools, secreting venom that corroded even defensive barriers. Webs shot out instantly, immobilizing everyone.

Lin Shan panicked—his high-grade defensive tool had been damaged for the first time ever! As more spiders emerged, clearly aiming to trap and exhaust them, every fire-aligned cultivator simultaneously resorted to flames.

Lin Shan joined in with his Five Elements Fan, but the fire spread via interconnected webs, igniting the entire formation.

"Who the hell is setting fires?!"

"Stop! Don't you see the webs connect everyone?!"

"We'll burn to death before the spiders get us!"

"My mid-grade armor's on fire!"

...

Lin Shan guiltily retracted his fan, silently apologizing to the cultivator whose robe he'd torched. Chains of fire erupted throughout the formation, turning the entire vanguard into a mass of fleeing human torches.

Not just his team—all five squads had encountered webs and resorted to fire, resulting in an inferno engulfing the entire camp.

While Qi Refining cultivators' flames were manageable (extinguishable by water or earth spells), Foundation Establishment flames—especially from Lin Shan's high-grade fan—left his subordinates miserable. Worst was the central command, where Protector Yan inexplicably unleashed her Samadhi Trueflame, roasting nearby cultivators until the scent of cooked meat filled the air...

---

After what felt like an eternity, they finally escaped the jungle into a grassy clearing, everyone sighing in relief.

The jungle behind them loomed like a terrifying black hole. None wished to retreat back into that hellish forest—they'd rather charge forward blindly.

The waist-high grassland ahead, free of towering trees, offered slightly better visibility. Though fog persisted, the openness provided some psychological comfort.

Protector Yan regrouped the forces, discovering they'd lost a third of their thousand-strong vanguard. Frowning imperceptibly, this exceeded her anticipated losses—with much distance still to cover.

Lin Shan's remaining seventy-odd subordinates glared at him resentfully, having suffered immensely from his flames. His later attempt to douse them with water spells only added insult to injury.

The march continued uneventfully for hundreds of li until a cascading waterfall appeared to their right, eliciting cheers.

"Finally! A waterfall to cool off!"

"Let's wash off this heat!"

Lin Shan's team held back, but Protector Yan's scorched subordinates rushed toward the stream—only to dissolve into fleshy sludge upon contact with the deceptively clear, fishless water.

"Poison spring! The water's toxic!"

The survivors recoiled in horror, the pristine stream now a deadly trap.

---

After regrouping, the vanguard pressed on. The eerie absence of wildlife in the grasslands raised suspicions—soon answered when cultivators began sinking into seemingly bottomless bogs that pulled victims down with unnatural force.

"Don't rescue them!" Protector Yan's icy command rang out—even her Golden Core strength couldn't extract them. The group could only watch as their comrades vanished beneath the mud, none daring to criticize the ruthless order from a demonic sect elder.

Her female disciples from Yichuan brothels—her elite forces—then deployed wooden puppets to scout ahead, preventing further bog casualties.

But soon, Lin Shan noticed some subordinates growing pale and bloated, like bloodless corpses soaked for months. When questioned, one collapsed instantly, his skin sloughing off to reveal swarming blood-sucking leeches that fled into the grass.

Panicked self-inspections ensued. Lin Shan found nothing—until chewing sounds came from his waist, where the miniaturized Black Skeleton Demon Lord was snacking on shrunken leeches.

"Disgusting!" Lin Shan flung the骷髅 away in revulsion (leeches being harmless to undead but terrifying to the living), forcing the chastened demon to return to his side.

After this ordeal, the visibly thinner group pressed on, reaching a vibrant flower field glowing radiantly in the canyon's darkness, filled with fluttering butterflies and busy bees.

Everyone halted—such beauty in this hellscape was undoubtedly a trap. Yet with retreat unthinkable, they had no choice but to proceed.

Protector Yan boldly touched a blossom, which nuzzled her hand affectionately. Under orders to avoid harming any flora, the group tiptoed through—unaware that trailing members were being silently devoured by suddenly carnivorous flowers.

When Lin Shan finally noticed his rear guard halved, a sunflower-like monster nearly swallowed Old Man Zhong whole. Enraged (the old man being his top missionary), Lin Shan severed the plant—only for the provoked flower field to erupt in violence, pelting the group with seeds and spores.

Amid the chaos, Lin Shan discovered some seeds were valuable spiritual materials perfect for his "Seed Soldiers" technique. He began collecting them even as his battered team fled, culminating in the awakening of ancient plant spirits—including a ten-meter-tall "Corn Cannon" whose projectile could likely flatten them all.

---

After escaping the floral deathtrap, the exhausted vanguard collapsed before a stone forest, their morale shattered. Having traversed only half the canyon's three-thousand-li length, many simply wished for death.

Protector Yan, equally battered by countless plant spirits (including seven or eight Golden Core-level entities), declared that beyond the stone forest lay only the final obstacle—the Yin Miasma Illusion Wind Belt. But with daylight breaking and the fog thinning, they opted to await the main force's arrival at dawn.

Unbeknownst to them, the vanguard had always been expendable bait.

At the canyon entrance, ten thousand Black Lotus Sect elites stood ready. The sect leader, after feigning preparation to follow the vanguard, instead boarded arcane battleships and headed south toward Dongmen Pass—their true target all along. The Poison Burial Canyon operation had merely been a diversion.
