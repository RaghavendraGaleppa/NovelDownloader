# Chapter 112: The Enchantress

Less than a breath after Li Shiming sensed that spiritual energy fluctuation, a streak of light arrived beside him.

Encased within the radiance was a girl of fifteen or sixteen, dressed in a peach-colored floral skirt. Her face was as pale as gold paper, clearly showing signs of severe injury.

Upon seeing him, the girl's expression relaxed before the light descended toward him—and at that moment, she gracefully fainted.

Li Shiming casually formed a spiritual energy hand to catch her.

He dared not let an unfamiliar cultivator get too close—he had witnessed enough dangers in the cultivation world.

Upon catching her, he realized she had already lost consciousness.

It seemed she had been fleeing while severely injured, and upon seeing him, her tension eased—perhaps believing the danger had passed—before collapsing.

Li Shiming didn’t underestimate the girl. Though young in appearance, her spiritual energy fluctuations indicated late-stage Qi Refinement.

After analyzing her condition with IBMz15, he confirmed she was genuinely unconscious.

"Am I really that trustworthy?" Li Shiming touched his face, musing that his current appearance was indeed striking—perhaps that was why the girl felt safe.

He studied her face. There was a sense of familiarity, yet he couldn’t recall where he might have seen her before.

Cross-referencing with IBMz15, he was certain he had never met her.

Since she was fleeing, someone must be pursuing her.

After a moment’s thought, he covered her eyes with cloth and placed her inside the Machine Room Space.

He left a sliver of consciousness there—if she awoke, she would be immediately ejected.

He hadn’t saved her because of her beauty—though striking, severe injuries diminished any allure. 

Li Shiming wasn’t someone easily swayed by appearances. That inexplicable sense of familiarity had compelled him to help.

The paper crane continued flying as he cautiously surveyed his surroundings. Whoever had injured the girl might still pose a threat to him.

Just then, a terrifying presence descended from above.

"Venerable Master Duyuan!" Li Shiming looked up and saw the old monk, immediately bowing in greeting.

Golden light flickered in Duyuan’s eyes as if he were using some secret technique, his expression puzzled.

"Young benefactor, have you seen a little enchantress pass by here?" Duyuan’s tone remained amiable.

At the mention of "enchantress," Li Shiming immediately thought of the girl—she must have been the one injured by Duyuan.

"I’ve been traveling nonstop and haven’t encountered anyone besides you, Venerable Master," Li Shiming replied with another bow, unwilling to betray the girl after saving her.

"That little enchantress escaped!" Duyuan’s expression remained unchanged as he shook his head. Then he warned, "If you encounter a young woman in peach-colored robes, be cautious. She is cunning and ruthless—you are no match for her. Stay far away."

Duyuan held Li Shiming in high regard, having even gifted him the "Lotus Speech" technique and a Buddhist relic in hopes of recruiting him into the faith.

In Duyuan’s eyes, Li Shiming was destined for Buddhism. His creative talents could greatly benefit the faith’s propagation.

Duyuan didn’t want the enchantress to jeopardize his investment.

Still, he didn’t suspect Li Shiming of hiding her. Though her aura had vanished abruptly, given her background, she might have used some special method.

Most importantly, Li Shiming’s cultivation was too low—Duyuan was confident the young man couldn’t conceal anything from him.

After issuing his warning, Duyuan chose a direction and flew off on his gourd.

Li Shiming watched him leave but made no move, continuing his journey on the paper crane.

He knew better than to underestimate such seasoned figures.

The girl was safe in the Machine Room Space, where the dense spiritual energy would aid her recovery.

His consciousness inside the space also sensed her stabilizing—likely due to prior medicinal treatment.

He only needed to ensure she didn’t wake prematurely while maintaining normal behavior.

Unbeknownst to Li Shiming, Duyuan stopped at a distance beyond his perception and followed him briefly.

Partly to protect him, partly to confirm whether he had truly not seen the enchantress.

Only after an hour did Duyuan deem Li Shiming safe and depart for good.

Li Shiming remained unaware. Without using his sword flight, he traveled on the paper crane until nightfall.

Finding a mountaintop, he released the copper corpse to excavate a temporary cave.

With prior experience, the excavation was swift—a single room was all he needed, completed in the time it took to drink tea.

Inside, he immediately retrieved the girl from the Machine Room Space.

After some thought, he also took out a Spirit Gathering Disk and placed it at the room’s center, creating a passable spiritual energy environment in the mundane world.

The girl lay on a stone bed while Li Shiming sat cross-legged at the cave entrance.

He wouldn’t have needed this shelter if not for her.

---

Ren Fei’er regained consciousness, the pain reminding her of her pursuit by the old monk.

A warm current in her body slowly alleviated the discomfort—she must have escaped.

"Wait… I think I saw Brother-in-law!" Her thoughts turned to Li Shiming’s face, and an overwhelming sense of grievance surged.

She had been injured protecting him—when had she ever suffered such injustice?

Never mind that she had sneaked away—her playful curiosity had outweighed any heroic intent.

Opening her eyes, she found her injuries healing rapidly thanks to medicine, but the residual Buddhist energy suppressed her spiritual power.

Duyuan’s casual strike had been mostly blocked by her protective treasures, but the remaining energy—amplified by its nature and his superior cultivation—left her with less than a tenth of her strength.

"Damn that old bald donkey! I’ll tell Mother when I get back—she’ll avenge me!" she fumed silently.

Her surroundings were a single room illuminated by a strange lamp embedded in the wall.

Her gaze settled on the figure sitting with his back to her at the cave entrance.

Perhaps due to her weakened state, or because she knew he had saved her, his silhouette filled her with an inexplicable sense of security.

"You’re awake. Have something to eat first." Li Shiming’s sharp senses detected her stirring, and he turned to speak.

Ren Fei’er had seen Li Shiming’s portrait in Tianhai Sect’s records. 

Seeing him now—backlit by darkness, his handsome features accentuated by the lamp’s glow—sent her heart racing like a startled deer.

"What’s wrong with me? Did that old monk poison me?" She checked her condition but found nothing beyond the Buddhist energy.

Unaware of her thoughts, Li Shiming retrieved spirit rice and a reserved stalk of spirit bamboo shoot from his storage pouch.

Stepping outside briefly, he returned with fragrant spirit cuisine—prepared in the Machine Room Space with micron-level precision.

He divided the meal, serving her with a spiritual energy hand when she winced at lifting her arms.

"Delicious!" she praised between bites, surprised by the exquisite flavors despite the ordinary ingredients.

The compliment pleased Li Shiming—a rare acknowledgment.

"Did that old monk find you?" she asked after eating, curiosity piqued.

She knew Duyuan wouldn’t give up easily—he and her mother were sworn enemies.

"You mean Venerable Duyuan? I hid you, so he left without noticing," Li Shiming admitted frankly.

"You’re amazing, fooling that old bald donkey!" Her eyes sparkled with admiration.

Her crude epithet for Duyuan irked Li Shiming slightly—the monk had treated him well—but given her injuries, he understood.

Still, hearing such language from a seemingly innocent girl felt odd.

"What’s your name? Why was Duyuan pursuing you?" he asked.

"I’m Ren Fei’er—call me Fei’er. Mother does. That old monk hates her, so he attacked me when he saw me…" She trailed off, then added, "Luckily, I met you!"

"Rest now. We’ll part ways tomorrow morning—I’m heading to the Southern Mountain Kingdom’s capital." He dimmed the LED lamp on the wall before returning to his seat.

As he reviewed the "Ice Heart Jade Thought Technique" with IBMz15, Ren Fei’er studied the lamp—a mundane yet flame-less oddity.

Curious, she extended a spiritual hand toward it. Li Shiming noticed but didn’t intervene.

The LED—powered by solar-rechargeable batteries—was one of his travel essentials, minimizing unnecessary retrievals from the Machine Room Space.

Playing with the touch-sensitive switch, she marveled as the light brightened and dimmed at her whim.
