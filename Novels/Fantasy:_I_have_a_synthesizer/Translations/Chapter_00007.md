**Chapter 7: Blood Energy 3! Cultivating Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist!**

Inside Liu Kuang's office at the Heng City Martial Artist Association, Su Yu stood quietly, waiting. Wu Ming, it seemed, had something to attend to and had already left.

"Congratulations on becoming a formal martial artist! This is your symbol of identity!" Liu Kuang handed Su Yu a badge. On its back were engraved a saber, a sword, and a peach blossom, while the front bore the words "Junior Martial Artist."

Liu Kuang's voice continued, "Since you've become a martial artist, I'll explain the classifications of martial artists to you." Su Yu's interest was piqued. In class, most of the lessons focused on how to become a martial artist, with little explanation of what comes after.

Liu Kuang explained, "When one's blood energy reaches 1, they can become a formal martial artist. Martial artists are broadly divided into the Blood Energy Realm, Blood Refinement Realm, Viscera Training Realm, Golden Body Realm, Flying Heaven Realm, and above Flying Heaven, the Grandmaster Realm! As for what comes after Grandmaster, you'll naturally find out once you've grown strong enough." He added, "These realms are collectively referred to as martial artists. For example, I am currently a Viscera Training Realm martial artist!"

Su Yu nodded, then looked at Liu Kuang, seeming to hesitate before speaking.

"What is it? Is there anything else?" Liu Kuang asked with a smile. He was quite willing to talk more with a genius like Su Yu.

Su Yu scratched his head, a little embarrassed. "Um, weren't there cash rewards too?"

Liu Kuang paused, then burst into laughter. "You've already become a martial artist; these external possessions are nothing. How about I have someone transfer 100,000 to your card in a bit?"

Su Yu was overjoyed. "Thank you, President Liu!"

Liu Kuang smiled, waved his hand, and said, "Alright, if there's nothing else, you can head back. Perhaps we'll meet again in a while!" Liu Kuang's gaze lingered on Su Yu meaningfully.

Su Yu nodded and turned to leave the office. After Su Yu departed, Liu Kuang's smile faded. He took out his phone, stared at a number for a long time, then dialed. "Hello, this is Liu Kuang."

Su Yu left the Martial Artist Association and headed home. Unbeknownst to him, a figure stood silently in the shadows, tapping their Bluetooth earphone.

"So painful!" Su Yu's face was contorted. Although the Synthesis Panel had provided a description, Su Yu hadn't expected the pain to be so excruciating.

Time slowly passed. An hour later, Su Yu finally felt the agony gradually subside. It was replaced by a warm energy that filled his entire body—the fluctuation of blood energy! Su Yu's eyes snapped open, a joyful expression bursting forth.

"My blood energy has reached 2!" Su Yu was ecstatic. One had to understand that after becoming a martial artist, without obtaining a formal martial artist cultivation method, it would take a considerable amount of time to increase blood energy by just 1 point. Even for martial artists who had cultivation methods, it would take at least more than ten days. Yet, Su Yu, relying on a Bone Quenching Pill, had increased his blood energy by 1 point in just an hour.

"As expected of a Level 4 medicinal pill, truly formidable!" He thought. "I still have one more." Su Yu gritted his teeth. "I might as well use them all! Only by improving my strength can I obtain more resources, and only then can I improve faster!" Su Yu understood clearly that in this world, effort and reward were always proportional. Only by becoming stronger could he acquire more abundant resources.

He then used the second pill. The familiar, intense pain surged through him once more, but he endured, knowing the benefits that awaited. An hour later, as the warmth spread through his limbs again, Su Yu felt his blood energy surge to a new peak. It was a good thing indeed!

"My blood energy has reached 3!" he thought, a sense of accomplishment swelling within him.

"Next, it's time to cultivate the Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist!" Su Yu retrieved the parchment scroll book from a corner.
