# Chapter 263: Departure for the Temple in the Sky, the Hope of the Water Clan!

The Blackwater Marshes were shrouded in endless, year-round drizzle, and today was no exception.

Pavilions and towers were indistinct behind the rain's beaded curtain, and the lake surface was covered in countless ripples.

In a certain courtyard, a face was reflected in the rippling water of a large basin—the face of a young man, the newly ascended Sky Flood Dragon of the Ming Flood Dragon clan who had made a name for himself throughout the Southern Border, along with his dark, gleaming body.

"The Three Treasures Lingzhi are all gone."
"The Spirit Tiger Strong Bone Pills...嗯, those are gone too."

Li Mo looked at the empty jade bottles and boxes in his system space and let out a silent sigh.

He had essentially bought out all the body-refining treasures from the Yunteng Commerce Guild in Yunzhou.

To be fair, the quality of the items from the Yunteng Commerce Guild was quite good.

Hmm... that is, unless you compared them to the feedback gained from the Ice Cube.

Even compared to the feedback from Princess Xiao Jiang, they fell far short.

So, Little Li had to make up for the lack of quality with quantity.

This, of course, led to an enormous consumption.

Furthermore, to go from Perfection to Transcendence in a Supreme Martial Art of the Physique Refining category required more effort than everything he had done before combined.

The progress in comprehending the Divine Will had also slowed significantly.

Little Li had hoped to make further progress before competing for the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens.

The current progress was less than ideal.

His progress was now equivalent to that of a wealthy, supremely talented, yet utterly ordinary person.

Oh, right.

Lately, he had received many gifts, but very few of them were actually useful...

*Knock, knock—*

Just then, there was a sudden knock at the door.

Opening it, he saw a young clam girl standing there, holding a luminous pearl in her hands. This pearl was clearly larger than the previous ones.

Zhen Bang's face was flushed crimson.

"Wu Mo, this is for you!"

"This pearl has excellent quality."

Li Mo nodded, intending to take out some gold from his system space to exchange for it.

But then he heard Zhen Bang say with her head lowered:

"This one doesn't cost anything. It was given to me by the clan elders to give to you, as a betrothal gift..."

"....."

Little Li's hand trembled, nearly dropping the pearl.

This wasn't the first time.

As everyone knew, the Demon Clan revered bloodlines. The stronger the bloodline, the more outstanding the offspring.

Therefore, as a newly ascended prodigy of the Ming Flood Dragon clan, Little Li's popularity was terrifying.

"The two of us are sure to produce an outstanding flood dragon-clam!"

"Wait, I am quite satisfied with this treasure, but..."

"Yay! Lord Wu Mo said he's very satisfied with me!"

"Can you let me finish my sentence? I'm from outside the Southern Border, a traditional flood dragon. We have no emotional foundation..."

After a great deal of effort, Li Mo wasn't sure if the other party could understand his meaning.

Zhen Bang certainly didn't.

In the Demon Clan's understanding, as long as a powerful bloodline is satisfied with a gift presented, it means they agree to leave behind their seed. That's how the Ming Flood Dragon clan operates.

What is this "emotional foundation" thing?

So, after all that talking, Zhen Bang only remembered one sentence:

"Lord Wu Mo said he's very satisfied with me!"

She turned around, her face red, and ran off in a flash.

Li Mo: "Σ( °△°|||)︴"

Is only hearing what you want to hear also a power of your bloodline? Are you doing this on purpose or was it an accident?

Sighing at the pile of gifts in the room, Li Mo took out the "Diagram of Sun Wukong Seeking the Dao" and began to contemplate the Divine Will.

In the afternoon.

There was another knock at the door. It was the family of three: Mu Rongxiao.

When he had first taken Mu Rongxiao to meet the couple, Mu Rongfeng and Wu Qing, something very unexpected had happened.

The couple, who had been pressured by the clan for a second child for a long time, were quite surprised by Mu Rongxiao's arrival.

It wasn't them who had sent the message for Mu Rongxiao to come to the Southern Border.

Adding to that, the rebel army that appeared so coincidentally, acting abnormally by not fleeing deeper into the Southern Border, and conveniently capturing Mu Rongxiao...

Little Li felt that this matter was suspicious.

This was also the reason he had been striving to improve himself every second recently.

Although he had no direct evidence, there were隐约 signs of the Demon Summoning Cult in the Southern Border. This trip to the Temple in the Sky was likely to be anything but peaceful.

The family of three naturally fussed over him and had a warm reunion for a while.

"If it weren't for you, we don't know when we would have been able to see Xiao'xiao again."

Wu Qing's eyes were red-rimmed; she had already learned of Mu Rongxiao's ordeal on the road. As a Fifth Grade Great Demon, she couldn't help but tear up again.

However, she did not know that the Sky Flood Dragon before her was originally a human.

"I was already planning to come to the Southern Border anyway. I was just traveling with Brother Mu Rong by chance."

Li Mo gave an embarrassed smile.

He had originally wanted Mu Rongxiao to return directly to the Qingyuan Sect.

"Thank you so much."

Mu Rongfeng also bowed in gratitude.

"You're too kind. I have long admired you, Uncle."

"You know of me? Although I made a bit of a name for myself when I was young, that was so long ago..."

Mu Rongfeng was a little puzzled as to where this admiration came from. Perhaps it was just a polite remark?

"Ah, I'm naturally happy that Xiao'xiao has returned, it's just... Xiao'xiao is a half-demon after all." Mu Rongfeng sighed again, his expression complex.

Li Mo pondered this.

That's not right.

As a half-demon, it would be better to stay within the Ming Flood Dragon clan in any case. Moreover, the Demon Clan doesn't hold prejudice against half-demons; in fact, they greatly admire their powerful strength.

But from the way Mu Rongfeng spoke, it was clear he felt Mu Rongxiao would be safer in human territory?

"The fact that he can learn Buddhist teachings is also Xiao'xiao's opportunity."

Wu Qing looked at her son's shaved head and the white jade sarira in his palm, and she seemed to let out a subtle sigh of relief.

The couple had something on their minds.

But perhaps they felt this wasn't something for a young person to worry about, so they didn't say more.

And this wasn't a recent issue.

The Eye of Fate wasn't mind-reading; it couldn't know what others were thinking.

"Coincidentally, Little Wu Mo and the others are also heading to the Temple in the Sky. We can just travel with them."

"When are we departing?"

"Naturally today, otherwise why would we come to inform you."

The Ming Flood Dragon clan's style of operation was extremely swift and decisive; when they said they were leaving, they left. This was likely why outsiders always said they had an impatient temperament.

That very day, including Wu Dameng, the other four Water Clan prodigies were already waiting by the lake.

The Temple in the Sky was quite far from the Blackwater Marshes, located at the far western edge of the Southern Border, but fortunately, there was a water route.

A massive ship made of fish bones was docked on the shore.

"Our Water Clan hasn't won the Divine Jade from Beyond the Heavens for many years."

"The Avian Clan's momentum is quite strong this time. The Great Peng clan has a half-demon named Zhituo. Possessing half-demon bloodline, he is not only powerful in bloodline but also knows human martial arts. If you encounter him, do you have confidence?"

The other four demons glanced at the young man not far away, who was examining the fish-bone ship.

Without hesitation, they all nodded.

"We do!"

"Good. There's also the Green Luan clan. A Green Luan Divine Maiden has emerged, slaying many ferocious disaster beasts. Her strength is even more terrifying than Zhituo's. Do you have confidence?"

The four demons, including Wu Dameng, were stunned.

This time, they pondered for a long while.

But then they suddenly remembered that Sky Flood Dragon Wu Mo had once said:

With just a slight move, the Green Luan Divine Maiden would be unable to resist!

"We do!"

"Brother Wu Mo has the potential of a Sky Flood Dragon!"

"They have their Green Luan Divine Maiden, but we have a Sky Flood Dragon presiding over us. What is there to fear!"

"The time for our Water Clan to hold our heads high is coming! We wonder what a magnificent battle of flood dragons and luan birds it will be."

All the Water Clan members were full of confidence.

"Huh?"

Li Mo turned back in confusion. After a moment of contemplation, he felt a bit of regret.

He should have kept a lower profile.

Suddenly becoming the hope of the entire Water Clan was a bit... balding.
