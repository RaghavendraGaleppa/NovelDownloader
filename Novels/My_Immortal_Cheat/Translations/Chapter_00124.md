## Chapter 124: Executing a Skill

Mu Su even felt a bit nauseous but managed to suppress it, thankfully not throwing up. Ling Yu, being from the Spider Cult and inherently on the evil side, was relatively fine, though she still harbored a fear of becoming like *that*.

He offered Mu Su and Ling Yu a reassuring glance, indicating he had everything under control, which nearly made their hearts, already lodged in their throats, leap out.

Looking at the Saint Devil, who sat cross-legged a few feet above the ground, eyes closed, a faint glow emanated from him. His snow-white hair was crystalline, and his body resembled glazed glass, exuding an incredibly sacred aura. Faint, ethereal chants, like the sound of Buddha saving sentient beings or gods praising, drifted from the void. The little pixies no longer bounced around but floated quietly beside the Saint Devil, utterly serene.

Zhou Tian couldn't help but inwardly scoff. *These people really know how to put on a show,* he thought. *I don't believe the Saint Devil can't completely conceal his aura without showing the slightest anomaly.*

Though disdainful of the Saint Devil's theatrics, Zhou Tian still managed a smile and moved slightly closer. Before he could take two steps, the little pixies beside the Saint Devil became agitated. They held golden spears, no longer than a fingernail, and glared fiercely at Zhou Tian.

"What is it?" the Saint Devil's voice came. He still hadn't opened his eyes, only his lips moved slightly.

"Um, could you give me some clothes? It's not ideal being naked like this." Zhou Tian said with a touch of embarrassment. His clothes were gone, and standing around naked felt a bit awkward.

The Saint Devil paused slightly, his finger moved, and with a flash of light, a set of purple robes appeared on Zhou Tian.

"Thank you, Saint Devil Senior." Zhou Tian thanked him politely.

The Saint Devil opened his eyes, and the entire world seemed to brighten. "You're quite interesting. I've 'killed' you more than once. Aren't you afraid of me?"

"It's not that I'm not afraid, but many things can't be solved by fear. Fear is useless, so it's better to find a way to solve the problem." Zhou Tian also found the Saint Devil quite interesting. According to his father, Zhou Yi, the Saint Devil was known to have a split personality, yet at this moment, he appeared quite normal, aside from some peculiar habits.

"I hope you can indeed resolve the issues between us, otherwise, I'll just have to resolve you." The Saint Devil smiled faintly, and immortal flowers bloomed one by one around him.

*That's quite an advanced way of thinking,* Zhou Tian muttered to himself.

"Saint Devil Senior, may I ask who commissioned you to attack me?" Zhou Tian stood for a moment, then couldn't help but ask. He was idle anyway, so he might as well try to learn something.

The Saint Devil was silent for a moment, then surprisingly, he actually spoke: "It's fine to tell you. He didn't say I couldn't reveal his information."

Zhou Tian was speechless. *Whoever hired you must have had truly terrible luck.*

"Actually, I don't know who he is. He was always shrouded in light. The objective was simply exchanged for payment."

Shrouded in light? Zhou Tian glanced at Mu Su. When "light" was mentioned, he immediately thought of the Lord of Holy Gods, but he couldn't rule out the possibility that the other party was simply hiding their identity.

"What price did they offer? My Zhou family will pay double. Saint Devil Senior, what do you say...?" Zhou Tian said with generosity.

"Haha, if it were anything else, I might actually agree. But unfortunately, the things I want, your Zhou family truly doesn't possess." The Saint Devil was amused by Zhou Tian and decided that if Zhou Tian's previous statement was false, he would turn him into a beautiful pixie.

"Alright then." Zhou Tian had merely mentioned it casually, not truly hoping to sway the Saint Devil.

"Then do you know about the ambush we encountered when we came to the Forsaken Land of Gods?" Zhou Tian treated the Saint Devil as an information broker and also asked him about the ambush in the Void Storm.

"You were ambushed? Who has the audacity to ambush a joint team of several major forces?" The Saint Devil was also somewhat surprised. He was familiar with the trials in the Forsaken Land of Gods and hadn't expected an ambush this time.

"It seems to be some ancient gods from the God Realm, and there was also interference from some Star Realm forces." Zhou Tian didn't hold back; this wasn't a major secret worth concealing.

"Star Realm forces interfered? Which one dares to court death like that? Or are several combined? No wonder such a big event happened in the Forsaken Land of Gods, yet none of the true big figures from Kyushu descended. So they were being held back." The Saint Devil exclaimed several times in surprise, simultaneously connecting nearby events, sensing a truly major storm brewing behind the scenes.

After a moment of contemplation, he glanced at Zhou Tian. "Don't worry about so much, child. When the sky falls, the taller ones will hold it up. You should focus on resolving our issue first."

Zhou Tian: "......"

Time passed quickly. The Saint Devil seemed to be contemplating something and no longer answered Zhou Tian's questions. Zhou Tian could only wait quietly for his resurrection count to refresh, as activating [Cultivation Replication] required one resurrection opportunity.

The moment his resurrection count refreshed, Zhou Tian suddenly stood up from the ground, patted his backside, and declared to the Saint Devil with high spirits: "Alright, I can use my divine ability now."

The Saint Devil lowered his legs and stood on the ground. A boundless aura surged forth, his body exuding a glazed light, and his white hair fluttered, piercing into the void. "Let me witness the great divine ability of a Heavenly Venerate!"

The Saint Devil employed his true power. His voice, like a golden bell, resonated across the heavens. Within a thousand-li radius, not a single breeze stirred; everything was suppressed by the Saint Devil's aura.

Zhou Tian activated the [Cultivation Replication] skill, targeting the Saint Devil before him. Instantly—

Boom!

A colossal aura erupted from Zhou Tian. Mu Su and Ling Yu, who were closest to him, immediately spat out a mouthful of blood, their faces turning deathly pale. Fortunately, a moment later, a gentle energy enveloped them, transporting them to a safe location.

Zhou Tian felt the surging energy throughout his body. Only after truly using this skill did he realize there was no discomfort or inability to control the rapidly increasing energy. The Undying System had arranged everything. Waves of insights flooded his mind, allowing him to wield the cultivation within him as easily as his own limbs, without any discomfort.

"Come on, Saint Devil!" Zhou Tian took the initiative to attack. With only 30 seconds, he didn't want to waste any time. He wanted to give this grandstanding lunatic a taste of his own medicine.

The moment he raised his hand, a massive hand entwined with lightning materialized in the void. The Saint Devil was a Heavenly King realm expert, so the power Zhou Tian replicated was naturally also at that realm, capable of wielding various forces. The massive hand grabbed fearlessly towards the Saint Devil, intending to suppress him.

The Saint Devil's eyes flickered, filled with shock. He hadn't expected a Heavenly Venerate to possess such a divine ability, capable of directly elevating a cultivation-less mortal to the Heavenly King realm. It was truly unimaginable. Though shocked, his reaction was not slow in the slightest. With a wave of his hand, *whoosh*, a white immortal sword appeared in his grasp. It shimmered brilliantly, originally white but radiating a myriad of colors, exceptionally dazzling.
