**Chapter 51: Mist-Root Water Ginseng**  

Zhang Jing retraced his steps back to the inn.  

Inside his room, he took out the address of the temporary market shop that Senior Brother Yan had given him and examined it carefully.  

"East City of Langya County, Mingdeng District, Shuangfeng Street."  

So the temporary market wasn’t located outside the city but had instead taken over a section of Langya County itself?  

*Knock knock—*  

Just as Zhang Jing was deep in thought, his door was suddenly rapped.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, may we come in?" Senior Sister Tong Yao's voice called softly from outside.  

"Please, Senior Sister, come in!"  

Hearing this, Zhang Jing put away the address and responded.  

The door creaked open, and four figures squeezed inside.  

"We heard footsteps earlier and guessed it was you returning," Senior Brother Zhou said, stepping forward. "But we didn’t want to disturb you right away since you’d just gotten back."  

"Ha! Junior Brother, you spent quite a while with Senior Brother Li. I’d say you must’ve gained a lot," teased Senior Brother Ding, who had been standing behind the others with only his head visible.  

"I have to thank Senior Brother Ding for the introduction," Zhang Jing replied politely.  

"No need for formalities, Junior Brother. It was only natural. Actually, we came to discuss something important with you."  

Senior Brother Ding pushed his way to the front and looked at Zhang Jing expectantly.  

"Please go ahead, Senior Brother."  

"Senior Sister Tong and I discussed it with the other two junior brothers, and we’ve decided to go hunting demons outside the city tomorrow. What do you think?"  

Zhang Jing’s expression turned slightly awkward. After a moment of contemplation, he spoke apologetically.  

"Senior Brother Ding, Senior Sister Tong, Senior Brother Zhou, and Senior Brother Xia—I’m truly sorry, but I have other plans. I won’t be joining you this time."  

Silence fell over the room.  

After a long pause, Senior Sister Tong asked hesitantly, "You’re not coming with us? But... how will you earn Dao Merits then?"  

Before Zhang Jing could answer, Senior Brother Ding interjected knowingly, "Junior Brother must be staying in the city because of talismans, right?"  

Zhang Jing nodded.  

"Haha, I had a hunch when I took you to meet Senior Brother Li. As a talisman master, you have a safer and more efficient way to earn Dao Merits. It’s understandable that you wouldn’t want to take unnecessary risks."  

"Thank you for understanding, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully, clasping his hands.  

"I’ll be setting up a talisman shop in the temporary market in the next couple of days. If any of you need talismans, feel free to come by. The prices will remain the same as before."  

"Junior Brother is too generous!" Senior Brothers Zhou and Xia exclaimed in unison.  

Among the four, only Senior Sister Tong still seemed downcast. Zhang Jing wanted to comfort her, but the words died on his lips.  

"In that case, I wish you prosperous business, Junior Brother! We’ll take our leave now. Take care."  

"Take care, Junior Brother," Senior Sister Tong said with a forced but sincere smile.  

At that moment, she realized they might never again fight side by side against demons as they once had.  

"Take care, Senior Brothers and Senior Sister!"  

With that, Senior Brother Ding led the others out of the room.  

Zhang Jing, who had originally planned to visit the market today, decided to stay another night. After all, he could craft talismans anywhere.  

---  

At dawn the next day, after seeing off the four senior disciples, Zhang Jing turned and headed toward the East City.  

Langya County was roughly the same size as Yong’an City, where he had lived for over a decade, and its layout was similar as well. This made navigating to the temporary market much easier.  

Half an hour later, Zhang Jing stopped in front of an archway bearing the words *Mingdeng District* and gazed at it with anticipation.  

The moment he stepped inside, he noticed a difference.  

Compared to the outside, the spiritual energy here was noticeably denser.  

As he ventured deeper, he saw more and more cultivators from the Dao Academy and rogue cultivators, while ordinary mortals were conspicuously absent.  

Rogue cultivators, in particular, outnumbered even those in Longze Market.  

Along the roadside, makeshift stalls set up by rogue cultivators displayed various demon materials.  

"It seems this demon uprising in Langya County isn’t just an opportunity for Dao Academy disciples," Zhang Jing mused. "For rogue cultivators—who lack resources and proper teachings—it’s also a rare chance."  

The more cultivators hunting demons, the better!  

After walking for another quarter-hour, Zhang Jing suddenly halted, his attention drawn to a small stall surrounded by a crowd of cultivators.  

Fragments of conversation reached his ears.  

"Mist-Root Water Ginseng?"  

At the stall, a young woman in her early twenties clutched a storage bag protectively to her chest, her expression wary as she faced the encroaching crowd.  

"Stop asking!" she shouted, her voice trembling with suppressed fear. "I’m not selling this Mist-Root Water Ginseng for spirit stones! If you want it, trade me something of equal value—spirit pills or life-saving treasures. Otherwise, forget it!"  

"Little girl, who sells things without accepting spirit stones? Just name your price," someone urged.  

The crowd quickly chimed in:  

"Yeah, listen to reason. No one’s going to trade life-saving treasures now!"  

"Be practical."  

"Fine, I’ll offer 120 spirit stones!"  

"130 spirit stones from me!"  

As they spoke, the crowd pressed closer.  

"What are you doing? This is a market! If I don’t want to sell, are you going to rob me? Aren’t you afraid of the Dao Academy’s punishment?"  

Her voice cracked, as if she were on the verge of tears.  

Yet the moment she mentioned the Dao Academy, the crowd recoiled as if doused in icy water, hastily backing away and leaving a wide berth around her stall.  

Silence fell over the scene.  

Then—  

*Tap tap—*  

A figure in a blue robe stepped forward from the crowd and stopped before the stall.  

The woman looked up, her eyes flickering with surprise before filling with hope.  

"Esteemed cultivator, do you... do you want to buy the Mist-Root Water Ginseng?"  

Zhang Jing didn’t answer immediately. Instead, he studied her and asked calmly, "First time at the market?"  

She nodded.  

*No wonder.*  

From what he knew, experienced rogue cultivators would sell rare herbs to the Dao Academy first rather than setting up a stall themselves.  

Other rogue cultivators either couldn’t afford the price or lacked the necessary resources.  

Moreover, Dao Academy disciples rarely took advantage of rogue cultivators—at least not too blatantly—unless the item in question was exceptionally valuable.  

"Let me see it."  

"Alright!"  

Fumbling, the woman pulled out a four-inch-long ginseng from her storage bag.  

The ginseng resembled a tiny human figure, and the moment it was exposed to the air, tendrils of mist began coiling around it.  

Soon, a faint mist had spread to Zhang Jing’s feet.  

A glimmer of delight flashed in his eyes.  

Due to his cultivation of water-based techniques, Zhang Jing was familiar with many water-attributed spiritual herbs.  

Mist-Root Water Ginseng grew under extremely rare conditions and was notoriously difficult to find in the wild because of its mist-concealing properties.  

Even the Dao Academy’s Thousand Techniques Pavilion rarely had any in stock.  

Though not a high-grade spiritual material, it was perfect for someone at the third level of Qi Refinement like Zhang Jing.  

Snapping out of his thoughts, Zhang Jing crouched and took the ginseng from her hands.  

"A forty-year-old Mist-Root Water Ginseng. What do you want in exchange?"  

"Spirit pills or life-saving treasures," the woman said firmly.  

"Understood."  

Nodding, Zhang Jing considered for a moment before producing a vial of Purple Spirit Pills, ten Star-Guide Talismans, and five Blazing Sun Talismans.  

After a brief hesitation, he also took out his Water Cloud Shield and erased his spiritual imprint from it. The shield was practically useless to him now, so he might as well trade it.  

He handed the items to the woman and explained:  

"This is a low-grade magical artifact, the Water Cloud Shield. Just imprint your spiritual sense to activate it. The Purple Spirit Pills aid cultivation—they’re decent."  

"These ten Star-Guide Talismans are of superior quality, exceedingly rare. When activated, they form a protective barrier of starlight around you. Even a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator or demon would struggle to break through it quickly."  

"The five Blazing Sun Talismans are also superior-grade, with power reaching the peak of third-level Qi Refinement."  

"Will this suffice for your Mist-Root Water Ginseng?"  

The rogue cultivators lingering nearby, unwilling to give up, first showed greed upon hearing Zhang Jing’s description—but it quickly turned to shock.  

*Ten superior-grade defensive talismans and five superior-grade offensive talismans?*  

What rogue cultivator would dare provoke someone with that?  

Most rogue cultivators were only at the early stages of Qi Refinement, and very few reached the third level.  

Envious gazes rained down on the woman as the crowd gradually dispersed.  

The woman’s eyes brightened with each item Zhang Jing listed.  

The moment he finished, she shoved the ginseng into his hands.  

"Esteemed cultivator, it’s a deal!"  

Without delay, she stuffed the shield, pills, and talismans into her storage bag, then hurried off, disappearing around a corner.  

Left holding the Mist-Root Water Ginseng, Zhang Jing continued on his way.  

This trade had been incredibly profitable for him—but the woman hadn’t lost out either.  

The same item held vastly different value depending on who possessed it.  

To Zhang Jing, talismans were trivial; he could make them anytime. But to rogue cultivators—and even ordinary Dao Academy disciples—they were precious treasures.
