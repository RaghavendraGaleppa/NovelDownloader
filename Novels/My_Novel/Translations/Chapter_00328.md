# Chapter 328: Finally Seeing the Youth

The night was deep, the moon bright and cold, the biting wind chilling to the bone. Zhao Chunxia, Luo Feiyan, and Lin Aoshan all found it impossible to sleep. Zhao Chunxia paced back and forth, walking to the iron bars of her cell and looking down.

Two mountains flanked the valley, the gorge wide and overgrown with dense vegetation. Zhao Chunxia’s cave cell was over twenty zhang high, quite elevated. Cold snow drifted through the bars into the stone cave. Dressed thinly, though she felt the biting cold, her mind was occupied, and she had no time to mind it.

From this cave, she had a clear view of the ground below. If a battle truly broke out tomorrow, she would be able to see the details clearly. She looked at the wide ground, covered like a blanket with snow.

Zhao Chunxia thought, “That Zheng Dechun is a vicious dog under He Wentian, loyal yet truly formidable. Since I was captured and brought here, I have never seen him slack off or be negligent. This man is old-fashioned and insidious, certainly not a good person. Li Xian... Li Xian... Though I have not seen him, I have seen his handwriting. I imagine he is a dashing young man, but fighting against Zheng Dechun is truly a situation where the odds are against him!”

She couldn't sleep all night, feeling the long night stretch on, her heart tormented. Yet, she harbored a bit of curiosity; tomorrow she would know the appearance and ability of this "Li Xian." But thinking deeper, she feared that their first meeting tomorrow might be their last.

Zhao Chunxia took out the note, admiring the calligraphy. She sketched a vague image of the youth in her heart, her feelings complex. This night, her mood was contradictory: she wanted time to speed up, yet also to slow down. If it went faster, she worried; if slower, she agonized. But time flows like water, and dawn eventually came.

A servant boy climbed the rope ladder to deliver food. Zhao Chunxia looked for the note but found it gone. She knew Li Xian’s determination was set; the arrow was already on the string, leaving no room for retreat. Zhao Chunxia sensed a "killing intent," calmed her mind, and quietly ate all the food. She sat cross-legged before the bars, regulating her breath.

Her long hair flowed freely; the bamboo hairpin used to tie it had long since fallen elsewhere. The cold wind scraped her bones, and frost condensed on the chains piercing her collarbones. She closed her eyes, meditating, banishing all distracting thoughts. Suddenly, she heard movement below: the cooks preparing food, the guarding soldiers, the archers in the watchtowers, and the martial artists who aided the tyrants... all seemed to receive a secret order to withdraw.

Zhao Chunxia knew the reason. Li Xian had informed her via letter that Feilong City urgently needed reinforcements and had to mobilize all available personnel. In the coming days, the Prisoner Women’s Gorge would see no smoke or fire, and the captive women would receive no food. The "Stone Gate" at the gorge entrance would slam shut, blocking the only way out, creating a dead end with no entry or exit.

Only Zheng Dechun would remain to guard them. The Stone Gate at the gorge entrance was as heavy as ten thousand tons; no human strength could push it. It required dozens of people working together to operate the mechanism, taking half an hour and utilizing various clever contraptions just to close it.

The servants left through the narrow gap in the Stone Gate, a gap only wide enough for one person to pass sideways. Nearly a hundred servants left in order, followed by the martial artists, guards, and archers...

The women didn't know the situation. Seeing the guards retreating one after another, they shouted questions, curses, and vented their anger... Panic set in as they didn't know what scheme the bandits were plotting or what treacherous tricks they would use.

This change drew all the women to the iron bars, looking down. Zheng Dechun, seeing the area cleared of miscellaneous people, shouted outward, "Close the gate!" His voice was sharp, but his internal energy was not weak; it carried a piercing resonance.

Outside the Stone Gate, the servants activated the mechanism. The ingenious parts of the mechanism were all embedded in the mountain wall. Dozens of servants pushed the "millstone." Every inch the millstone turned pulled the internal machinery, causing the Stone Gate to vibrate and shake off layers of dust with a "rustling" sound.

He Lijun of the Hushan Sword Sect cursed, "You dog, Zheng! What trick are you playing? Do you dare tell your grandmother!" Her collarbones were pierced, and her blood and energy were weak, but seeing many fellow sect disciples present, she didn't want to show weakness and tried to boost morale, forcing her voice to be loud and steady.

The Stone Gate moved inch by inch, the gap growing narrower. The noise was deafening and piercing. Zheng Dechun said, "What trick? You pampered flowers, now those with ability can't use it, and those without ability lament in vain. To deal with you, why would we need tricks? You overestimate yourselves and underestimate others." With that, he covered his mouth and laughed.

The women were instantly furious. Tang Mengluo, an elder of the Hushan Sword Sect, dressed in a white dress, stood out among the women with her refined looks. She said coldly, "He Wentian is a beast, but you, neither man nor woman, are even worse. If you hadn't plotted secretly and used poison to frame us, how could we have been captured? After your cheap success, you show the faces of villains, proud and complacent, thinking no shame, only glory. It is utterly disgusting!"

Mu Hongchou said, "The elder is right!" The women of the Hushan Sword Sect echoed in agreement, their clear voices washing over them, filled with curses.

Bao Hanhan, a female elder of the Lishan Sword Sect, said, "Everyone, please rest assured. Being trapped here is only a temporary predicament. Our five great sword sects have united here. Though He Wentian has captured us women, there are still male elders and disciples from the Jiushan, Yangshan, Lishan, and Yueshan Sword Sects outside. They certainly haven't left and will surely find a way to rescue us. It won't be long before we can drink the bandits' blood and eat their flesh to vent our hatred!"

The women of the sword sects were indeed heroines among women; their words were forceful and stirring, instantly uniting the women's hearts. They all praised their own sect's male disciples and elders: "I have a deep bond with my junior brother; he will never ignore my plight." "My senior brother and I have secretly pledged ourselves; he must be anxiously searching for me." "My sect's Senior Brother Yue Kai has exquisite swordsmanship and great ability; knowing we are trapped and captured, he will surely help." "Their brilliance as prodigies is dazzling. And there is Young Master Zhou Shijie; though not a disciple of our sword sect, his chivalrous heart is unmatched. If we could get his help, we would have luck on our side, so why worry about not finding us?"

The women whispered among themselves, their eyes bright with hope.

Zheng Dechun laughed, "I'm afraid it's hopeless."

He Lijun said, "Though this is a crisis for the sword sects, it is also an opportunity. Our five great sword sects are well-known in the martial world. Once we overcome this difficult situation, our bond will be stronger than gold, and our alliance firmer than iron! All sisters of the sword sects, or sisters from other sects, need not panic. This is a good thing, not a bad one!"

Zheng Dechun sneered softly, "You women of the sword sects truly carry a sharp edge. The more you are ground, the sharper you become, yet it is utterly meaningless. You speak with the narrow views of women; it is truly a pity. Your wishes are good, but they will ultimately come to nothing!"

He was tall and thin, his walking posture very strange. He said, "Since City Lord He dared to capture you, he naturally has foolproof means. Do you know where this place is? This is the 'Petal Heart Cliff' of the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Acupoint. Now I call it the 'Prison Women's Gorge.' Even if your sword sect experts were to enter the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Acupoint, how difficult would it be to find this place?"

"This place has no ventilation, no light, only favored by the cold snow and north wind. Now it is winter, freezing cold, making you suffer from the cold. If it were summer, the gorge would be stiflingly hot and humid, with moss growing on the walls, making it even more unbearable."

"Without the right opportunity or means, finding this place is difficult! Difficult! Difficult!"

His voice, combined with the heavy rumbling of the Stone Gate moving, crushed the women's morale. The elders knew the significance of the "Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Acupoint." The younger disciples didn't, but seeing Zheng Dechun's calm confidence, they guessed it couldn't be good.

Zheng Dechun continued, "Let's take a step back. Even if we told you the details of the five great sword sects and gave you a map, if you don't understand the great skill of Feng Shui and geomancy, it would be completely delusional to truly find this place!"

An elder of the Jiushan Sword Sect said, "Hmph, if it comes to Feng Shui and geomancy, my Jiushan Sword Sect's Elder Wang Tiexin has some knowledge of it!"

Zheng Dechun sneered, "It's a pity, a pity. That Elder Wang Tiexin is now on good terms with City Lord He and trusts him completely."

Yang Piaoxue, a female elder of the Yueshan Sword Sect, said coldly, "That's a joke. Are we sword sects foolish? Whatever He Wentian says, are we supposed to believe it? Does your City Lord He really have that ability?"

Zheng Dechun sneered, "Since you are so smart, why did you believe it before? Why did you become flowers in a cage?" The women were speechless and couldn't argue. Bao Hanhan of the Lishan Sword Sect said, "Our sword sect has many people; there are surely smart ones who will see through the bandits' words and come to rescue us. Even if we were deceived for a while, we will eventually wake up. If you don't want people to know, then don't do it."

Suddenly, there was a loud rumble as the Stone Gate slammed shut.

Zheng Dechun, seeing everything was secure, relaxed slightly. Zhao Chunxia was worried and had no intention of questioning him, but suddenly a strange light flashed in her eyes. She thought, "This man is extremely loyal to He Wentian and is fully confident in his plan. If I can lure him into revealing his plan, he will naturally lower his guard. If Li Xian... really wants to kill him, this would be a golden opportunity."

Zhao Chunxia asked clearly, "You are confident that we cannot be saved. What is your basis? If there really is one, tell us so we can give up hope. Wouldn't that be better?"

Several female elders of the Yueshan Sword Sect frowned and said, "Senior Sister Chunxia, how can you boost the enemy's morale?" Zhao Chunxia shook her head and said, "No, no. There is no perfect plan in the world. If he dares not say it, it proves he knows his plan has flaws and doesn't dare to speak. If he dares to say it, we can think it over in our hearts and break his villainous scheme. The sword sect brothers and senior brothers are in tune with our hearts and will surely rescue us."

The women fell silent, truly unwilling to hear the villain's plan. Zheng Dechun said, "Very well, very well. You can't escape anyway. It's boring here, so I might as well tell you."

He said, "Sigh, I really feel sorry for you. Some time ago, the Jieyou Tower collapsed. You were only a step away from being saved."

Zhao Chunxia didn't know about the "Jieyou Tower," but Lin Aoshan had experienced it personally, so she remained calm. Luo Feiyan and the other women captured from the "Phoenix Banquet," who hadn't seen the sun or heard outside news since their capture, were shocked to hear that the Jieyou Tower had collapsed. Some shouted in relief.

Zheng Dechun said, "The collapse of the Jieyou Tower revealed an opening in the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Acupoint. This was hard to hide. Even if your sword sect elders are stupid, they must have become suspicious. City Lord He tried his best to explain that the cave is dangerous and shouldn't be entered easily, and he tried to persuade them in every way."

"The sword sect elders didn't believe him and were extremely rude. At this point, they suspected that your disappearance was the doing of City Lord He."

The women felt this was very bad. Zheng Dechun continued, "The five great sword sects joined forces to enter the tomb to investigate the cause. They declared that City Lord He was not allowed to follow; if he did, they would turn against him instantly. City Lord He couldn't stop them, so he let them be. However, though the elders were capable, they underestimated the danger of tomb exploration. This Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Acupoint is a fierce acupoint nurtured by Feng Shui for countless years!"

"The person buried there is a famously fierce figure from ancient times. City Lord He discovered the tomb years ago but has never fully explored it. The elders of the various sects were indeed formidable, but they quickly hit a snag. They lost several disciples, and their morale took a big hit."

"At this point, the five great sword sects wanted to retreat. But they had already entered a very dangerous area of the Nine-Aperture Dragon Heart Acupoint: 'Palace Thundercloud.' Above this place, thunderclouds float. If you move, you will be struck by lightning. The elders, to save their lives, threw away their swords. They wanted to flee, but every time they moved slightly, the thunderclouds would envelop them."

"All the elders were trapped here. Only a few younger disciples who entered later were lucky enough not to be trapped. The elders used all their skills but couldn't break free, forced to stalemate for several days. At this point, people's hearts faltered. Hehe... these great men, when truly in danger, cried, complained, and got angry. They had no spirit; it was truly ridiculous."

The women looked grim, feeling their faces flush with shame. Zheng Dechun said contemptuously, "Those who could remain calm were only a handful. They thought they were going to die here, and some blamed themselves for not listening to City Lord He. Among them was a young hero named Zhou Shijie, who said: 'City Lord He is supremely virtuous; his character was praised by my teacher, Fu Haoran. Such a person warned you earnestly, but you didn't believe him. Now, you've dragged me down to die with you.'"

"Hahaha, this boy looks dignified but is actually the most cowardly. But I have to say, we really have to thank him. If he hadn't mentioned 'Fu Haoran,' those old foxes like Xiao Wanjian, Wang Zongheng, Hou Yuande, and Duan Yixin might not have believed it so easily."

"At that time, Xiao Wanjian asked: 'Is what you said true? Is Fu Haoran your teacher? Is it the Fu Haoran, the Heavenly Official, who cut his flesh to feed birds?' Fu Haoran's reputation was indeed impressive. City Lord He had endured and visited him daily, which really paid off."

"Zhou Shijie said: 'Naturally, he taught me literature and was upright. Even he said City Lord He was humble, studious, and of excellent character. How could that be wrong? Alas, I was so anxious to save people that I overlooked this. Tragic, tragic!'"

Hearing this, the women's faces darkened. Mu Hongchou, Luo Feiyan... and the other women who were quite familiar with Zhou Shijie felt a deep sense of disgust and contempt. Mu Hongchou cursed, "This man is extremely hypocritical, just a smooth talker. Not worth深交 (deep friendship)!"

Zheng Dechun looked up and saw the female elders' gloomy expressions, already defeated. Feeling even more pleased, he continued, "Wang Zongheng then said: 'Alas, we... we seem to have misunderstood City Lord He.' Hou Yuande said: 'This tomb is extremely dangerous and connected to the city market. Building a tower here to seal the opening is common sense. We only suspected because our female relatives went missing. We lost our composure and didn't investigate carefully. We hurt our friendship and lost our lives. It was truly wrong.'... Laughable, laughable. Then, from elders to disciples... they all started praising City Lord He."

"The noise reached City Lord He, who was truly heartbroken with laughter. You sword sect disciples are interesting, interesting. I imagine so-called heroes in the world are all just flashy on the outside. When faced with a dead end? Who can be calm? Who can be indifferent? Don't they all show their true nature?"

所谓的风采，皆不过恃强欺弱罢了。

The so-called brilliance is nothing but bullying the weak and fearing the strong.

The women had no way to refute. Zhao Chunxia and Lin Aoshan felt a bit of indignation. Hearing the words "bullying the weak and fearing the strong," they thought of something and their hearts stirred. Zheng Dechun continued, "That trapped disciple fled back to the city to plead with City Lord He. City Lord He treated him politely and didn't get angry at all. This magnanimity made others admire him even more. Actually, City Lord He想过 (considered) not rescuing them, letting all the elders die there. But to facilitate the alliance of the five sword sects and for his future grand plans, he not only had to rescue them, but had to do it grandly, saving them while covered in wounds."

"He immediately rushed to the 'Palace Thundercloud.' He used a苦肉计 (trick to gain sympathy by inflicting injury on oneself), rescuing the elders one by one. He ended up covered in injuries, almost losing his life. Given this, how could they not believe him? Several elders even wanted to结拜 (sworn brotherhood) with City Lord He."

Yang Piaoxue, He Lijun... Zhao Chunxia, Luo Feiyan... and the other sword sect elders wanted to cover their faces in shame. The five sword sects united, but the women were captured and the men defeated. Their emotions were very low. They knew Zheng Dechun was right, and hoping further was useless.

They thought of the senior and junior brothers they had just praised, who had become in Zheng Dechun's words, cowardly, foolish, and naive figures. The so-called "brilliance" was just showing off force. They couldn't help but feel sad and lost, yet secretly agreed. Many young women of the sword sects, some of whom had secretly admired Zhou Shijie, felt even more stifled, with grievances they couldn't express.

Zhao Chunxia saw Zheng Dechun becoming more and more pleased and said, "You villain, you say our sword sects are worthless. Is He Wentian very厉害 (formidable)? He is nothing but a卑鄙小人 (despicable villain)."

Zheng Dechun said, "Narrow view of a woman. In terms of talent and strategy, who among you can compare to City Lord He? Who can surpass him?" Zhao Chunxia sneered, "Then... is it also City Lord He's plan to leave you here alone to guard us?"

Zheng Dechun stood with his hands behind his back, calmly saying, "Of course. I alone am more than enough to guard you. Can you, a bunch of captives, still cause any waves?"

Zhao Chunxia felt the moment was ripe and continued, "It seems your City Lord He is not infallible. As the saying goes, there are people outside people, and heavens outside heavens. He总有 (always) has moments of oversight."

Zheng Dechun stared at Zhao Chunxia, seeing her face serene, completely without the颓气 (dejected air) of the past. He couldn't help but be curious and scrutinized her carefully. Just at this moment, Zhao Chunxia shouted coldly, "Zheng Dechun!"

At the same instant, on the high iron chain on the opposite mountain wall, about thirty-seven zhang off the ground, a figure hung, also shouting "Zheng Dechun." But the sound was louder, more chilling, and carried a sharp killing intent. A sharp aura shot straight towards him. The moment the word "Chun" left his mouth, a sharp arrow left the string, carrying an indescribable momentum!

Zhao Chunxia's heart beat inexplicably fast. She thought, "Sure enough... sure enough, he came! You, Zheng Dechun, look down on the heroes of the world, but this youth Li Xian is different. You said the heroes of the world are all bullies of the weak, not worth mentioning. Then this youth Li Xian, a second-rate martial artist,逆伐 (defying the odds to attack) you, a third-rate martial artist. Isn't that bullying the strong with the weak!" The shout just now was indeed to attract Zheng Dechun's attention. This plan worked; Zheng Dechun hesitated for an instant, and an arrow had already arrived!

Zheng Dechun couldn't dodge in time. He protected his heart meridian and reached out to grab it. But the arrow's trajectory slightly curved, aiming for his legs. With a "噗嗤" sound, the arrow pierced through his leg and钉在 (nailed into) the snow,震起 (stirring up) a large patch of snow.

Zhao Chunxia praised, "Good arrow!" She immediately looked towards the arrow's origin. She saw on the Prisoner Women's mountain wall, a youth hanging upside down on an iron chain, long hair垂下 (hanging down), expression calm and肃杀 (killing). Not fearing the strong, determined to kill the strong enemy. Sharp芒 (light) radiated out.

Zhao Chunxia was relatively far away and couldn't see his face clearly, but this scene filled her with excitement. She felt extremely痛快 (satisfied). She thought, "Good youth, he really dared to come! A second-rate youth, daring to shoot a third-rate! The sword sect heroes are already inferior to him."

The women all looked, unable to help exclaiming. They said one after another, "There's someone on the opposite mountain wall." "Who... who? Is it the senior brothers?" "I don't know... but it should be someone to save us."... The Prisoner Women's Gorge instantly became noisy.

Li Xian had been preparing for a long time. After shooting one arrow, he immediately swung away holding the chain. Zheng Dechun's right foot was already injured. He roared, "Who? How dare you injure me!" His voice was sharp, filled with anger, piercing the eardrums.

The snow on the mountain walls and branches shook loose. The iron chains on the mountain wall "clanged" and vibrated. His imposing aura enveloped the area.

Zhao Chunxia's heart beat inexplicably fast. She thought, "Sure enough... sure enough, he came! You, Zheng Dechun, look down on the heroes of the world, but this youth Li Xian is different. You said the heroes of the world are all bullies of the weak, not worth mentioning. Then this youth Li Xian, a second-rate martial artist,逆伐 (defying the odds to attack) you, a third-rate martial artist. Isn't that bullying the strong with the weak!" The shout just now was indeed to attract Zheng Dechun's attention. This plan worked; Zheng Dechun hesitated for an instant, and an arrow had already arrived!

The snow on the mountain walls and branches shook loose. The iron chains on the mountain wall "clanged" and vibrated. His imposing aura enveloped the area.

The women's hearts sank, but they felt even more admiration. It's easy to bully the weak, but hard to attack the strong. Zhao Chunxia's eyes were bright, watching his agile figure. She said, "A second-rate arrow,逆射 (defying the odds to shoot) a third-rate."

"The person... is far better than his words!"

(The author's note: First, let me apologize...

Today's chapter was supposed to be longer, estimated to be over 9,000 words, even 10,000. I originally wanted to finish it in one go. It could be considered a small burst of updates.)
