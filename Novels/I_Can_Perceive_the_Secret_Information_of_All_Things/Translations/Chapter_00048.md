# Chapter 48: Taoist at the Door, Demons Have a Plan  

The Bear King was furious.  

His first thought was of the roasted demon he'd prepared—he'd been certain that anyone who saw such a curious object would be tempted to poke at it, just as he had been. If anyone touched the foreign demon, the sensation would transmit to his skin through the special wine he'd fed it during their drinking session.  

With advance warning, he could have either fled or prepared for battle.  

But now, it seemed all his carefully laid plans—the foreign demon, the planted footprints, the scattered traces of demonic aura, the various traps—had failed completely.  

There was no doubt in his mind: a traitor lurked among them.  

"I swear, if I ever use imported goods again, I'll be a pig!" he roared.  

A nearby pig demon muttered, "Actually, being a pig isn't so bad..."  

The Bear King glared at him. "Why are you the only one who made it back?"  

His suspicion was impossible to hide.  

Just then, a voice called from outside: "Thank you for leading the way. Without you, it would've taken me at least half an hour to find this place. Your second cave is much harder to locate than the main one."  

So the Mad Demon Cave truly had a traitor.  

This was like someone stealing corn right under the Bear King's nose. He swore to make them pay.  

Testing the waters, the Bear King sent out a few of his strongest minor demons.  

But the Taoist outside cut them down one by one, his arrogance infuriating.  

The Bear King and the Eagle Demon quickly retreated.  

After this test, it was clear the Taoist far surpassed them in strength—they weren't even in the same league.  

"You must not be very influential around here, getting cornered by a Taoist like this," the Feather Nest Lord sneered, his disdainful gaze making the Bear King burn with humiliation.  

"Now's not the time for sarcasm," the Bear King growled. "Aren't you trapped here too? We should join forces and eliminate that Taoist."  

"The Taoist is strong. We need a strategy first," the Feather Nest Lord said, still haunted by the sight of the Taoist effortlessly slaying demons at the cave entrance.  

It was a fair point. Having never fought together before, they needed to coordinate.  

Even last-minute preparation was better than none.  

"Follow me."  

The Bear King led his trusted subordinates and the Feather Gang demons deep into the cave, entering a hidden chamber. Maps of the surrounding terrain hung on the walls, and a simple sand table stood in the center.  

It was obvious they were about to rehearse their tactics.  

Facing a powerful Taoist and an unknown number of martial constables, careful planning was essential.  

The Feather Nest Lord couldn't help but admire the Bear King's meticulousness. A demon who could plan so thoroughly and even dared to take human form to kidnap townsfolk was bound for greatness—if he survived, that is.  

*If I become his sworn brother, as the elder, I won't have to charge into battle first...*  

"To ensure better cooperation and eliminate distrust against our common enemy, I have a proposal," the Feather Nest Lord announced. "Let's become sworn brothers."  

Swearing brotherhood at death's door was unexpected.  

The Bear King studied the eagle demon carefully. *Is this bird playing games, trying to take over my territory and assets? Well, I wasn't planning to keep these mountains anyway. Might as well humor him and let the Feather Gang take the front lines while I slip away in the chaos.*  

He nodded solemnly. "An excellent idea. I was just thinking the same."  

As they prepared to seal their oath with blood—  

"Wait," the Bear King said, suddenly remembering the pig demon traitor. "We're missing something."  

...  

On the altar, a bloody pig's head blinked its eyes, wisps of incense curling around it. Through the smoke, it watched two figures kowtowing before it while the gathered demons embraced each other.  

"Though we were not born on the same day, we swear to die on the same day..."  

The Feather Nest Lord and the Bear King completed their oath, uniting their factions as family. Their gazes toward each other softened, and their morale lifted.  

On the sand table, the Bear King outlined three escape plans.  

"First tactic," he declared, as the local terrain expert. "Overwhelm them with numbers. Charge out in groups of five to exhaust the Taoist's spiritual energy and expose any hidden constables."  

"Unwise," the Feather Nest Lord countered. "The Taoist wouldn't blockade us without preparation. From how easily he killed our brothers, he's at least at the late Qi Refining stage, eleventh layer or higher. We don't have enough demons left to throw at him."  

"Brother, hear my second plan." The Bear King rearranged the sand table, planting flags and placing stones. "We all rush out at once, scattering in every direction to distract the Taoist. Then, you and I charge him together while the others circle back to surround him."  

"Still flawed," the Feather Nest Lord said meaningfully. "A good plan in theory, but getting everyone to regroup would be impossible... they'd just keep running."  

*You know our brothers well...* The minor demons hastily protested their loyalty, but none truly wanted to die by a Taoist's blade—such deaths were considered unclean.  

"Brother, don't worry. Third tactic." The Bear King smoothed his white chest fur calmly. "I'll take human form as a delicate woman, and you'll offer me as a hostage. When handing me over, you'll strike first, drawing the Taoist's attention. Then I'll attack from behind. Even if he's stronger, he won't expect it. The others just need to watch for hidden constables."  

"Then we'll follow this plan." The Feather Nest Lord felt he'd befriended a genius bear with a bright future. *All I need to do is shove him forward and fly away.*  

The Bear King smirked inwardly. *Once the bird attacks, I'll bolt in the opposite direction.*  

With the plan set, the Bear King swallowed a human-form pill. After rehearsing with the Feather Nest Lord until the minor demons saw no flaws, they marched toward the cave entrance.  

Demonic energy surged. Morale soared.
