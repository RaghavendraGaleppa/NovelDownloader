# Chapter 203: As I Would Wish

Having made their decision, they quickly gathered their belongings. Teams of skeletal soldiers returned with the remaining array materials, which the Black Skeleton Monarch collected entirely.

Though this was a remote wilderness, the earthshaking battle that had just occurred might attract passing cultivators investigating the disturbance, despite the concealment provided by the Absolute Evil Sky Pit. With the Black Skeleton Monarch's weakened soul state and Lin Shan's poor physical condition, it was unwise to linger.

Without hesitation, they boarded a hastily assembled bone skyship that shot through the skies with a "whoosh."

...

On the skyship, the Black Skeleton Monarch excitedly clutched a pile of "land deed jade slips" while pulling out an abacus. Its ten bony fingers nimbly clicked the beads in a flurry of calculations.

Lin Shan paid it no mind, focusing instead on recovering from his injuries. Fortunately, the Void Star Plate continuously provided him with celestial star power—an energy that nourished the soul and mended meridians, surpassing even some elixirs and talismans in efficacy.

"It's time to find a couple of star power cultivation techniques to practice."

The cultivation world offered a myriad of techniques, and cultivators weren't restricted to just one. No one would stop you from practicing multiple techniques, though it might slow your progress in your primary cultivation method and delay your advancement.

However, auxiliary techniques were sometimes necessary. More techniques meant more methods at your disposal—be it elemental techniques, healing arts, energy recovery methods, detoxification skills, perception-enhancing techniques, or foundational cultivation secrets.

Lin Shan had the Void Star Plate's power coursing through him but lacked the knowledge to maximize its potential—whether for array formation, defense, combat, spellcasting, or healing. He could only passively absorb its energy, barely scratching the surface.

Some cultivation techniques and divine abilities in the cultivation world could synergize with magical treasures, even becoming indispensable partners. If Lin Shan could obtain a star power divine ability, he might even wield the Void Star Plate's full might as a spiritual treasure, amplifying their combined power!

But now that they had left the Great Song Dynasty, opportunities would arise during their travels. There was no need to rush.

Meanwhile, the Black Skeleton Monarch put away its abacus, satisfied with its calculations. After organizing the scattered jade slips in the cabin, it noticed Lin Shan still sitting cross-legged, pale-faced and focused on recovery. Suddenly, something seemed to click in its mind.

The skeleton stood there dumbfounded, replaying every detail of its battle with the Dai family's Golden Core cultivator. The more it thought, the more something felt off. Unable to contain itself, it muttered aloud.

---

"Wait a minute... this kid didn't lift a finger the entire battle! It was all me and the Void Star Plate's artifact spirit controlling the arrays while he watched from the sidelines. How could he be so drained?"

"And the Three-Nine Heavenly Tribulation—twenty-seven heavenly strikes—should have come one after another without pause. Why did it nearly dissipate midway?"

"Not to mention, he kept gulping down pills and frantically absorbing spirit stones. Then, just as the tribulation was about to vanish, he recalled the spiritual treasure to gather spiritual energy and celestial star power... and the lightning pool reappeared..."

"Something's not right. Not right at all!"

"So there was no mysterious third-party tribulation transcender, no substitute technique... All of that was just my own imagination running wild."

"The truth is simple."

The Black Skeleton Monarch suddenly stood, grabbing Lin Shan by the collar and shouting in his face:

"You were the one transcending the tribulation!"

"Exactly!"

Lin Shan's eyes snapped open, twin beams of light bursting forth as he dropped a bombshell: "I've actually reached the Great Perfection of late Golden Core!"

"What?!"

The Black Skeleton Monarch immediately released him, falling backward onto its rear in shock. Its soul fire, already weakened from battle, flickered unsteadily, its intellect momentarily short-circuiting.

But after a brief pause, it scrutinized Lin Shan carefully, sensing him repeatedly before hesitantly asking, "Brother, don't joke around. You're clearly at late Foundation Establishment. How could you summon the Heavenly Tribulation's lightning pool and the Nine Heavens Astral Winds?"

Lin Shan lowered his eyelids, smoothing his collar before replying leisurely, "Guess."

"Guess?"

The skeleton stared at this infuriatingly enigmatic youth, its mind racing with wild speculations.

"You didn't chant any incantations or form hand seals when summoning that tribulation... Could you have already condensed a divine ability seed? First that curse divine ability, now this tribulation technique—there's no way you cultivated these yourself. Unless..."

"Was this another investment from that immortal realm powerhouse who made contracts with the underworld and studied the Witch Dao epoch?"

"Exactly!"

Lin Shan suddenly exclaimed with absolute certainty.

He then nodded approvingly, even brightening with an expression that seemed to say, "Why didn't I think of that?" as he praised the skeleton's imaginative reasoning.

---

The Black Skeleton Monarch studied his reaction, now even more uncertain. As Lin Shan grew older, his experience deepened, and his cunning became increasingly inscrutable. It was impossible to tell truth from lies.

Or perhaps this tribulation technique was an investment from another immortal realm powerhouse?

Just how many backers did this kid have?

Why were these supreme beings investing in him?

What returns did they expect?

...

The skeletal monster's thoughts spiraled further down this rabbit hole, completely unaware of the existence of something like an "Enhancement Panel."

Lin Shan secretly sighed in relief—he'd managed to bluff his way through again.

Having such a knowledgeable old monster by his side meant constant vigilance. If it ever discovered his golden finger secret, disaster would surely follow!

He couldn't keep it around much longer!

He needed to reach Golden Core soon and send it off to proselytize and harvest faith!

When he first enhanced the Void Star Plate spiritual treasure, he'd nearly been unable to explain it. Only the skeleton's own assumptions about the artifact spirit's innate wisdom and ability to conceal itself had saved him.

Now, the Nailhead Seven Arrow divine ability seed and this tribulation technique were adding layers to the deception. Fortunately, the paranoid skeleton loved overcomplicating things with its own theories.

But lies piled upon lies would eventually collapse. He couldn't afford to be careless.

...

They found a secluded spot to recover their strength over two days before discussing their next steps.

"We just killed a Dai family Golden Core cultivator. Is there enough time to return to Moonview City and claim the inheritance?" Lin Shan, though greedy, wasn't reckless—he always planned escape routes.

The Black Skeleton Monarch, its soul fire restored, resumed its role as strategist. "Relax, we have time."

"Two days ago, when we killed that Dai elder, their distant clan headquarters would've immediately noticed his soul lamp extinguishing or jade slip shattering. Their first step would be an internal meeting to discuss how to handle it."

"Next, considering their Golden Core elder died mysteriously, they wouldn't act rashly. They'd first send a team to Moonview City to gather information—what matters he was involved in, what enemies he might have made—before reporting back."

"Only after careful analysis and confirming they could handle the threat would they dispatch another Golden Core cultivator. No clan would act recklessly against someone capable of killing a Golden Core expert."

"How long do you think this entire process would take?"

The skeleton's step-by-step breakdown was logical and thorough. Lin Shan nodded repeatedly.

By their estimate, the Dai family would need at least ten days before sending another Golden Core expert to Moonview City—plenty of time for them to attend the high-end auction, liquidate their spoils, and make a clean escape.

Attempting to ambush another Golden Core cultivator would be suicidal. The next envoy would undoubtedly be far stronger than the novice they'd killed, and their sky pit trap wouldn't work twice.

Lin Shan and the skeleton knew their limits. Killing one Golden Core cultivator didn't mean they could repeat the feat!

Golden Core experts were already high-tier combatants in the cultivation world—each a genius who could live four hundred years, lead clans, or establish sects. Their previous target had been carefully selected—a newly advanced Golden Core weakling with subpar combat skills—yet they'd still nearly failed despite perfect conditions and overwhelming advantages.

In the cultivation world, defeating opponents a major realm above you was extraordinarily difficult. Those capable of such feats earned a prestigious title:

Heaven's Chosen of the Dao!

Such individuals were peerless talents, their ambitions soaring as high as the clouds, usually hailing from supreme sects.

They either remained silent or shook the world!

Of course, fame brought trouble. Those without powerful backing—especially rogue cultivators—would face relentless recruitment attempts or assassination.

Lin Shan, already labeled a demonic cultivator in the Great Song with no chance of redemption, couldn't afford exposure. His traces from the demonic sect battle in Lu Kingdom would never withstand scrutiny. Moreover, with his golden finger requiring him to harvest faith covertly, fame would only hinder him.

Still, killing a Golden Core cultivator as a Foundation Establishment cultivator was an incredible achievement.

"Does this make me a Heaven's Chosen now?"

"Absolutely!" The skeleton confirmed without hesitation.

Overcoming realm gaps required perfect alignment of circumstances—personal strength was just one factor. As long as the victory wasn't entirely fluke, it counted.

Setting aside such titles, they quietly returned to Moonview City on their bone skyship once sufficiently recovered.

...

On Moonview City's streets, Lin Shan and the skeleton split up, both cloaked in gray robes and hoods.

While the skeleton handled the Lin Trading Company's affairs, Lin Shan attended the high-end auction with the land deeds. Before parting, the skeleton gave him price benchmarks and a list of rare array materials to acquire.

Moonview City's monthly high-end auction always featured novel items to draw crowds, alongside networking opportunities in the cultivator communication network. Lin Shan used the "Scholar" jade slip from the Dai elder's storage pouch rather than his own to avoid detection.

Inside, he boldly liquidated all Dai family assets in Moonview City—properties, facilities, everything. This caused minor ripples, but most attendees—powerful figures from major factions—showed little interest.

Only a few engaged in heated negotiations through mirror artifacts. Lin Shan guessed these were rival mining magnates—the only ones capable of utilizing Dai's iron, copper, and cloud copper operations.

After haggling, the deeds sold for:
- 500,000 spirit stones
- Five fourth-tier array materials
- Miscellaneous items from the skeleton's list

Notably absent were any Jade Marrow or Golden Core formation aids—such treasures were never traded lightly, reserved for nurturing a clan's future.

...

As the duo busily maximized their gains, a group of cultivators approached Moonview City's eastern gate. Their uniform robes marked them as members of a cultivation clan.

Leading them was a young Confucian scholar—an old acquaintance of Lin Shan's from the demonic sects' headquarters:

Dai Budong of Cloudy River Academy.

Among his retinue was his childhood friend and confidant:

Zhu Duiyou of Jingyang Institute.

Having graduated a decade prior, Dai Budong had returned to his clan to prepare for succession struggles, with Zhu Duiyou as his chief advisor.

Seeing Moonview City's gates ahead, Dai Budong frowned, recalling his clan elders' grave instructions. This mission was his chance to prove himself.

"Brother Zhu, this investigation into our clan elder's death is shrouded in mystery. I'll need your wisdom."

Zhu Duiyou smiled, adjusting his scholar's scarf and waving his goose-feather fan, eyes glinting with intelligence:

"As I would wish, though I dare not ask!"
