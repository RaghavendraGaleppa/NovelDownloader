Chapter 68: Green Plums and Boiled Wine

This was an inexplicable skirmish.

As soon as Kang Zhengyan and his men rushed out of the cave, an arrow shot toward them.

The son of a soldier from the Feng'an Manor was struck and killed.

This left no need for further explanations; they immediately engaged in battle.

For a moment, blades flashed and shadows danced before the cave as the two sides clashed in a chaotic melee.

Kang Licheng was slashed on the arm during the fight, startling Kang Zhengyan into pulling him close.

This was the only son of his second brother. If he died, how could Kang Zhengyan face his brother again?

"Licheng, hurry back to the manor and tell your uncle what happened here!"

Seeing that both sides were evenly matched in number, but the对手's martial skills were clearly far superior, Kang Zhengyan knew the situation was grim.

"Third Uncle!"

"Go now!"

Kang Zhengyan didn't bother to persuade him further and kicked his nephew in the hip, sending Kang Licheng stumbling.

"Hurry!"

Kang Licheng gritted his teeth and, taking advantage of the darkness, plunged into the forest.

Kang Zhengyan and his men had no idea what kind of background these fierce outsiders had.

However, there were many bandits in Longshang who weren't professionals but rather part-timers.

When the opposition was strong, they were merchants.

When they encountered prey they could overpower, especially in the wilderness, they became bandits.

This situation was quite common in the ancient seas of Yang Can's world.

The reason was the same: in such desolate places, it was difficult to discover crimes like robbery and murder.

Kang Zhengyan and his men thought this group of bandits was just such a gang of merchants who had taken a liking to their goods.

That arrow, in fact, wasn't shot by the people transporting the mountain goods.

The archer was Wan Tai. As soon as he loosed the arrow, he knew he had succeeded.

By then, he had already made his escape.

Seeing those people rush out of the cave and attack without a word, the mountain goods transporters assumed they were merchant-bandits who had set their sights on their cargo.

These people didn't look like horse bandits either.

Professional horse bandits wouldn't bother with a goods transport team like theirs.

They had a symbiotic relationship.

So, what more was there to say?

They had to kill to keep the secret!

The battle finally ended, and Kang Zhengyan and his men all lay dead in a pool of blood.

The transporters搜出了 four carts of farm goods, which further confirmed their earlier judgment: these were just a group of merchants who had suddenly harbored evil intentions.

"Are there any survivors?"

"No, we took them all down!"

"Damn it, if news of this business gets out, the consequences would be unthinkable. Check again, and put a knife in each one!"

"Yes!"

Hearing the order, the men scattered immediately.

Each of the bodies already lying in the bloody puddles received another stab to the heart.

"We can't stay here long. We must travel through the night to get away from this place."

The leader gave the order, and the men didn't dare to delay. They immediately carried all their own dead and hastily prepared to leave.

The four carts of goods left by Kang Zhengyan and his men were also taken along.

Although not very valuable, it would still be a source of income when transported out.

Besides, the carts and horses were already there, so it wouldn't slow them down much.

A light rain was falling, the kind people liked best.

It wasn't heavy, but it drizzled for half a day, thoroughly moistening the soil and allowing the spring seedlings to grow stronger.

In a small pavilion, a rattan chair was set out, and Yang Can sat on it, watching the spring rain like a veil.

The Persian cat, Medusa, was squatting nearby, adding charcoal to a clay stove.

A small red clay stove was warming a pot of yellow wine.

On the table were a few small dishes to accompany the wine.

Qing Mei strained the boiled yellow wine to remove the ginger threads and poured it into Yang Can's cup.

Late spring and early summer, a rainy day. A small pavilion, a red stove, and a beautiful companion adding yellow wine. It was an indescribable sense of contentment.

Standing opposite Yang Can was Jingyao Shitai.

The sky on a rainy day was somewhat dim, but as she stood in the pavilion, the pavilion seemed to become brighter.

Her skin gave a semi-transparent impression.

It was as if a piece of fine white mutton-fat jade was illuminated from within by a soft light.

"Master Jingyao, I found a Manshu Nunnery at the foot of Maiji Mountain. I plan to send you there for cultivation. How would that be?"

Yang Can picked up his warm yellow wine, took a small sip, and spoke.

He had been secretly observing for several days and hadn't发现 this nun causing any trouble in his manor.

But Yang Can had no reason to keep her and have to guard against her; it would be better to send her away.

Qing Mei was very pleased to hear this.

This young master's temperament was too noble and pure, like a bright cloud in the sky that made people feel ashamed in comparison.

She was really worried that Yang Can might be tempted by her beauty and defile this bodhisattva-like master.

Fortunately, Executive Yang still had his principles.

The pleased Qing Mei picked up a piece of braised pig's ear with scallion and fed it into Yang Can's mouth.

She didn't notice that since the day she washed Yang Can's feet, serving him had become as natural and habitual as serving Suo Chanzhi in the past.

Send me to a nunnery?

Wouldn't I have to eat vegetarian food every day then?

And nunnerys are usually in remote places with few people around, so it wouldn't be easy for me to leave either?

Dugu Jingyao didn't want to leave anymore.

Ever since she discovered that her identity as a nun served as protection and the young master of the manor had no designs on her, she didn't mind hiding here anymore.

Here, she could occasionally sneak into the kitchen to steal some meat to eat. What could she eat at Manshu Nunnery? Rats?

"Master..."

Dugu Jingyao's gentle gaze fell on the roses outside the pavilion, which were swaying in the rain but hadn't broken their stems.

She clasped her hands together and let out a soft sigh: "Master's great virtue, this poor nun is deeply grateful. However..."

She changed her tone and said with compassion: "Master, in your opinion, is the path of cultivation found in the mountains and forests, or within the human heart?"

Yang Can blinked. He hated it when Buddhists spoke in cryptic phrases, wasting words with their roundabout talk.

Seeing that Yang Can didn't answer, Dugu Jingyao sighed again, her eyes filled with clear and gentle light.

"When the Buddha of the past attained enlightenment, it was not in a famous mountain or ancient temple, but under an ordinary Bodhi tree.

This shows that the Buddha is in the heart, not in the environment. If the heart is not calm, even in a quiet temple, it is like a bustling market.

If the heart is at peace, even in the mortal world, it is like a pure land."

Sure enough, she started speaking in metaphors. Did she mean... she didn't want to leave?

Yang Can's alarm bells rang loudly. If this fake nun didn't want to leave, then she must have an ulterior motive.

Dugu Jingyao's family had "household monks," and they supported more than one.

Her appearance and temperament were already elegant and holy, and she had been familiar with the speech and manners of those household monks since childhood. Pretending to be a nun with strict discipline was even more convincing than a real one.

She pointed to the roses outside the pavilion and said casually: "Master, look. The roses in this garden, troubled by wind and rain, are originally a tribulation.

However, the rain moistens their roots, and the wind tempers their stems. Isn't this swaying at this moment a form of cultivation?

Where is there no dust to stain, where can one not clarify the heart?

Here, with rain hitting banana leaves, boiling wine and listening to the Zen, this poor nun has been here for several days and feels that it is easier to see the pure original heart than in the desolate mountains."

Qing Mei listened and couldn't help but admire her even more.

No wonder this young master's temperament is so noble and pure; it turns out she pays attention to the cultivation of the heart at all times.

After experiencing a tribulation, she found that in this mundane world, it was easier to strengthen her Zen heart, and she actually chose to enter the world.

Such a lofty person with aspirations for cultivation in the mortal world, it wouldn't be right to send her away, would it?

Qing Mei couldn't help but tug on Yang Can's sleeve: "Master, there are still many vacant places in the fortress. Why not choose one to build a nunnery and invite Master Jingyao to cultivate here?"

To persuade Yang Can, Qing Mei added: "There are many believers in the manor. If a nunnery is built here, they would have a place to worship Buddha in their daily lives."

Dugu Jingyao panicked upon hearing this. If that were the case, she might as well go to Manshu Nunnery.

Leaving the Yang residence to build a separate nunnery?

Forget about eating meat, wouldn't she even have to cook her own meals?

She didn't know how to cook!

It wasn't her fault for loving meat. In wealthy families in Longshang, meat was the main part of their daily diet, and she was at an age where she was still growing.

She was used to that kind of diet, her body needed it, and this girl was naturally a "gourmand."

In her family, she was a little foodie. How could she stand having plain vegetarian food all day?

Dugu Jingyao immediately said: "Thank you, Benefactor Qing Mei. But, building a nunnery on our own, how is it different from cultivating in Manshu Nunnery?

If the Master doesn't mind the disturbance, this poor nun will just cultivate at your esteemed residence. A bowl of tea and rice, a place to sleep, that is enough."

Yang Can recalled the scene of her holding a pig's trotter and gnawing on it like a little hamster, and couldn't help but twitch at the corner of his mouth.

Dugu Jingyao continued: "This poor nun is good at making incense and has some research in medicine. I will not be a freeloader on the Master's support."

Qing Mei's eyes lit up upon hearing this and quickly tugged on Yang Can's sleeve.

Seeing that this fake nun was reluctant to leave, Yang Can immediately became alert: "This woman is indeed a spy; she came specifically for me!"

Now that he had confirmed the fake nun was a spy, Yang Can wasn't in a hurry to make her leave.

Otherwise, if he drove away this one who had been exposed, and the unknown enemy sent another, he wouldn't even know who that person was, so how could he guard against them?

Yang Can's eyes flickered, and he nodded with a smile: "I was being too insistent. Since Master Jingyao feels this place is beneficial for your cultivation, please feel free to stay. For any needs, just find Qing Mei."

Dugu Jingyao clasped her hands again and said calmly: "Amitabha, where the heart is at peace is where the body is at peace. Thank you, Master, and Benefactor Qing Mei, for your kindness."

As she spoke, her gaze swept quickly over a plate of "Drunken Wind Eel" on the table, and she secretly swallowed a mouthful of saliva.

Why eat pig's ear? Such a waste.

Catching fat sea eels in the East Sea, splitting them open from the back, and rubbing them carefully with sea salt.

Hang them under the eaves facing the sea, letting the sea breeze blow away the moisture and infuse them with the scent of the ocean.

When the eel meat is dried and firm, with a honey-colored sheen, immerse it in aged wine lees.

The salty and savory taste, paired with warm yellow wine...

Gulp!

Dugu Jingyao turned and walked calmly into the drizzle.

Yang Can watched her retreating figure. Hmm... this fake nun's hair seemed to be growing longer.

Once her hair grew to her waist...

No, to continue pretending to be a nun, she would shave her head, right?

But who on earth sent a fake nun to spy by my side?

Was it the Clan Head? Or Second Master Yu?

It seemed that aside from those two brothers, there was no one else.

At this moment, Kang Licheng stumbled into Feng'an Manor and collapsed at the deserted street corner in the rain.
