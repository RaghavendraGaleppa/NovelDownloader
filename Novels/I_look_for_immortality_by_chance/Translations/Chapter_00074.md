# Chapter 74: Plundering Six Peaks, Reusing the Stone Liquid

The young man was instantly furious. 

Born into a prestigious Daoist academy family—though not one of the Five Great Clans—his lineage boasted Foundation Establishment cultivators, ensuring an unbroken and prosperous heritage. Endowed with exceptional talent from childhood, he had received the full support of his clan, advancing smoothly through life with unshakable confidence. 

During this campaign against Flying Wave Mountain, he had ventured alone into the spiritual peaks. In just half a day, he had subdued the demonic beasts, repelled his fellow disciples, and settled cross-legged on the mountain, preparing to lay down his formation disk. 

Everything had gone smoothly. 

But never had he imagined that someone would dare to prey upon him like this. 

"Such audacity!" 

With an angry shout, he flicked his wrist, sending a dazzling golden circlet hurtling toward the thief. 

This golden circlet was a treasure bestowed upon him by a Foundation Establishment elder of his clan, capable of sealing the spiritual energy of Qi Refinement cultivators—a formidable weapon and one of his trump cards. 

With this artifact, he had rarely met his match in battles against peers of the same realm, even managing to defeat opponents above his level on occasion. 

Had he not been utterly enraged, he wouldn't have resorted to using it so quickly. 

"Who does this fool think he is? Does he truly believe himself some mighty dragon, daring to plunder spiritual peaks like this?" 

"Today, I’ll teach you a lesson—" 

A cold smirk played on his lips as he imagined the thief’s spiritual energy sealed, leaving him as helpless as a lamb for slaughter. 

*Clang!* 

But just then, the sound of metal striking stone echoed through the valley. 

The young man’s expression twisted as he saw his prized golden circlet ensnared by a mysterious golden ring. A deep, terrifying power surged from the ring, completely suppressing the circlet’s energy. 

All the inscribed Daoist runes on the circlet dimmed, rendering it as useless as a gilded toy before it plummeted from the sky and crashed onto the cliff below. 

*Whoosh!* 

*Whoosh!* 

Meanwhile, the thief on the mountain didn’t even glance back, continuing to gather spirit herbs from every corner of the peak. 

Not only that, he climbed higher and higher, eventually reaching the summit—standing face to face with the young man. 

"Such gall!" 

The young man’s face flushed crimson with humiliation. With a thought, two radiant talismans and two magical artifacts shot forth, hurtling toward the thief. 

*Rustle—* 

But in that instant, a dense fog and torrential rain suddenly descended, shrouding the entire area and obscuring the young man’s vision. 

"Cloud-Walking Mist Talisman?" 

His expression darkened. Without hesitation, he unleashed his spiritual sense, which surged outward like a black falcon, soaring and darting through the mist in an attempt to disperse it. 

---

*Roar!* 

Yet within the boundless fog, the roar of a dragon suddenly resounded. 

The young man’s face paled. He tried to retract his spiritual sense, but it was too late. Silver scales glimmered as an indistinct figure riding the mist and clouds took a single, effortless bite. 

The young man stiffened, standing motionless as if his entire being had been frozen. 

Seizing the opportunity, a pair of large hands emerged from the fog, plucking a verdant, serpent-like spirit herb from the ground at his feet. 

Even after taking the herb, the hands seemed unsatisfied, reaching next for the storage pouch and jade pendant at the young man’s waist. 

But a golden talisman hanging from his neck suddenly flared to life, casting protective golden light around him. 

"Oh? A life-preserving golden talisman crafted by a Foundation Establishment cultivator." 

"Pity..." 

A sigh echoed through the mist before it dissipated, taking the shadowy figure with it. 

A long while later, the young man finally regained his senses, his face as pale as paper. Staring at the now-empty cliff and touching the slightly dimmed talisman around his neck, he shuddered with lingering fear. 

"Dragon spiritual sense... a supreme-grade spiritual sense!" 

"Was that a disciple from a Golden Core lineage? Or perhaps a direct descendant of the Seven Veins?" 

"That was no petty thief—that was a true dragon in disguise..." 

His expression darkened as he surveyed the desolate mountaintop. 

---

"Impudent brat! How dare you trespass on my spiritual peak!" 

On a lotus-shaped peak, a burly, bearded Daoist clad in an eight-leaf robe bellowed at the sudden intruder. 

With a flick of his sleeve, a blazing crimson cloud descended like a fiery curtain, pressing down upon the figure. 

*Boom!* 

Peach blossoms swirled, mist billowed, and spiritual energy churned violently as a fierce but brief battle erupted. 

After what felt like an eternity, the Daoist stared at the thoroughly ransacked peak, his face darkening. 

Yet he dared not give chase, instead setting down his formation disk to claim the peak. 

---

The same scene played out on yet another spiritual peak. 

Eventually, a young man, his sleeves still smoldering, fled at breakneck speed atop a jade shuttle. 

Atop the peak, a formidable disciple from a noble clan watched the retreating figure and snorted coldly but ultimately chose not to pursue. 

Time was running short. Setting up the formation disk required another full day, and with other challengers likely to appear, he couldn’t afford to leave. 

---

In truth, once the Daoist academy disciples had subdued the mountain’s demonic beasts, the situation had shifted into a defensive battle. 

Each spiritual peak became a battleground—holding it for a single day without defeat meant securing its ownership. 

---

Gu Yuan finally came to a stop in a secluded ravine nestled among the peaks. 

After ensuring no one was nearby, he allowed himself a satisfied smile and retrieved the storage pouches from his sleeve. 

"Three peaks’ worth of treasures, plus the spirit herbs and rare fruits from three others... That makes six peaks I’ve ‘liberated’..." 

Gazing at the bulging sacks of loot, his grin widened. 

This single "campaign" had netted him at least a thousand spirit stones. 

Had the latter three peaks not already been partially stripped by demonic beasts and other cultivators, the haul would have been even greater. 

Still, it was a windfall by any measure. 

A thorough inventory of the storage pouches might yet yield more surprises. 

But now was not the time for that—his window of opportunity was closing. 

Despite his swift actions, this plundering spree had already taken over a full day. 

By now, the battles for the peaks had largely been decided. Those who held them were no pushovers, and Gu Yuan had noticed that further raids were becoming increasingly difficult. 

Most critically, word of his exploits seemed to have spread. 

Continuing would only provoke collective retaliation, making the risks outweigh the rewards. 

"Time to call it quits. I should claim a peak for myself." 

With a sigh, he flipped his palm, revealing the stone vial. 

Rather than relying on his own judgment to choose a peak, Gu Yuan had a better method. 

*Boom!* 

He unstoppered the vial and let a drop of the stone liquid fall into his eyes. 

Instantly, the world sharpened. Stars swirled, and everything became crystal clear. 

Countless white points of light flickered densely across his vision. 

But his gaze didn’t linger on these. Instead, he focused on a peak near the center of Flying Wave Mountain. 

There, a nearly pure silver opportunity pulsed, indistinct yet unmistakable—much like the one he had seen at Silverfish Island.
