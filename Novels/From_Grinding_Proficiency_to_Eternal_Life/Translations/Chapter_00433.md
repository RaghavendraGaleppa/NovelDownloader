# Chapter 433: Mere Ants

The sword-fire in the eyes of the Qingming Crone flared three feet high. The formless black shadow churned violently, and even the constantly crumbling "Mud Man" stopped coughing, craning his neck to stare with wide, greedy eyes at the Dao displayed by Xu Yunfan before him.

This undisguised intent was the very path of advancement.

Most stunned was the hemp-clothed old Taoist who had remained silent in the corner.

He slowly raised his head, revealing a face covered in corpse spots. This Supreme Elder who cultivated the *Scripture of Sitting in Oblivion* had long ago refined himself into a "living dead," relying on the closure of his five senses to delay aging.

Now, beneath his decaying eyelids, two lines of blood-tears actually seeped out.

"The root of Martial Dao... is actually an Immortal Scripture."

The hemp-clothed old Taoist's voice sounded as if it came from a tomb. He tremblingly extended his branch-like fingers.

Those fingers were covered in green hair, and his nails were curved like hooks, yet they accurately tapped upon the Dao patterns Xu Yunfan was displaying.

The instant the Tortoise-Snake Dao patterns made contact with the green-haired finger, a piercing青 light erupted, instantly melting away the other's nail.

The hemp-clothed old Taoist instantly retracted his hand; in that instant, he had already experienced the power of this interlocked Tortoise-Snake. If the other party were to crush him with this, he would have no way to block it.

Xu Yunfan cursed internally; just how many years had this old monster gone without washing his hands? That green hair had probably already cultivated into a spirit?

But on the surface, he maintained his respect: "Senior has keen insight. Martial Dao was indeed born from this scripture. Now, all of you have a method of continuation to cultivate."

Speaking up to here, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a bit of regret. If he had known it would be like this, he wouldn't have killed those disciples of the Five Great Sects. If he had placed restrictions on them instead, letting him command them, wouldn't that have been better? They were all excellent materials.

The twelve old monsters exchanged glances, falling into a silence. Finally, the紫-robed elder bound in chains stepped forward. Amidst the clattering of iron chains, every step he took left a black bloodstain on the ground.

"This old one is willing to go."

Just these three short words caused him to vomit a mouthful of foul, black blood.

But within those turbid eyes, a fierce light like that of a starving wolf erupted.

Xu Yunfan understood that these half-dead old fellows, down to their bones, were all those who had pushed Martial Dao to its absolute limit.

In a sense, it was the God Martial World, this realm, that had limited their path forward.

Compared to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, the God Martial World was originally a small realm. To be able to condense a single Seat was already not easy; any more would simply be a feast for the various sects of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Now, using various means to drag out their pathetic existence, they were waiting for a single chance to break through.

Now that Xu Yunfan had given them this chance, they naturally would not let it slip away.

Twelve streams of decaying yet mighty auras locked onto Xu Yunfan simultaneously. The beams and pillars of the Qingwei Hall groaned under the strain, as if承受ing some pressure that transcended the mundane.

Bi Yuan looked at his disciple with a bitter smile, transmitting his voice: "These Martial Uncles and Martial Aunts have all reached the end of their lifespans. Now that you've given them a chance, they naturally fear that you will run away... Although their temperaments are somewhat eccentric, they are all existences who have pushed their own Martial Dao to the extreme."

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over this group of the Dao Sect's foundation, and he nodded slightly.

The青-robed old Taoist sat silently in the corner, his fingertips lightly tapping his knee. Each tap conformed to a mysterious rhythm, actually rippling traces of varying depths through the air, sufficient to show that he had integrated his lifelong Martial Dao insights into his every movement.

Walking, sitting, and lying down were all forms of cultivation.

Another fat old man seemed to be burping, but in reality, every intake and exhalation of his breath drew the thin spiritual energy of heaven and earth around him into the flow of thunder and fire qi, faintly carrying the momentum of wind and thunder accompanying it. This was clearly the result of cultivating the Dao Sect's secret transmission, the *True Function of Nine Heavens Thunder Gang*, to the realm of returning to simplicity and truth.

This was definitely a top-tier martial art, said to have been created by the Pureyang Ancestor of the Dao Sect back in the day.

Xu Yunfan suddenly laughed.

These old monsters were indeed top-tier existences if placed in the God Martial World, but if judged by the standards of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World...

A Foundation Establishment cultivator could draw upon the spiritual energy of heaven and earth with a single breath, and a Golden Core True Person could move mountains and fill seas.

In comparison, these old, decrepit beings trapped in the Ninth Realm for hundreds of years were nothing but ants who hadn't even touched the threshold of the Immortal Path.

"I was overthinking things."

His fingertip flicked lightly. True Wu Sword Qi drew a streak of清 light within the hall. The twelve auras locking onto him instantly retreated like snow meeting the blazing sun.

No matter how eccentric these old monsters were, they would eventually have their edges smoothed down by the rules of the Taihua World.

And what the True Wu Peak needed was precisely the purity of these beings who had pushed Martial Dao to the extreme.

These, were his助力 (aid).

"Three days from now, I will use a Realm-Breaking Talisman to break through the realm. Do not be late, esteemed ones. Once this opportunity is missed, there will be no other."

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. A wisp of True Wu qi undulated around him. In an instant, the twelve aged faces showed expressions of shock under the illumination of this qi.

The紫-robed elder bound in chains felt his turbid pupils contract sharply. The Blood Dan within his body, which had been dormant for many years, actually trembled slightly under this qi, on the verge of shattering. It was as if he had encountered the suppression of a higher-level power, forcing him to guard his mind tightly just to barely stabilize it.

In the eyeless sockets of the Qingming Crone, the sword-fire danced violently. Her "Heart's Eye," which perceived the world through sword intent, felt a刺痛 for the first time.

Although Sword Heart Clarity was strong, it also depended on who the opponent was.

The Black Tortoise phantom hovering behind Xu Yunfan actually caused her sword dao foundation, cultivated for three sixty-year cycles, to waver.

Most shocked was the Mud Shell Elder. His cracked facial skin fell off in rustling flakes, revealing the青-grey terror beneath. The Wutu True Qi within him, which was connected to the earth's veins, was now acting like a subject bowing before a monarch.

Apart from Bi Yuan, the twelve thoughts of greed, shock, and doubt had just begun to surface when they were dispelled by a wisp of qi undulating around Xu Yunfan.

"Zheng..."

In the clear and resonant sword cry, all stray thoughts melted away like snow meeting the烈 sun.

These old monsters, who had lived to the very end, instantly sobered up. The person before them was no longer a junior needing their guidance, but a true Foundation Establishment Real Person who had set foot on the Immortal Path!

The紫-robed elder, or rather, Jue Zhen, was the first to lower his head, the chains clattering: "This old one humbly obeys the decree."

The twelve old monsters bowed in unison, their枯瘦 bodies trembling slightly under the pressure of True Wu.

Xu Yunfan's expression was indifferent, his gaze sweeping over these Martial Dao titans who had once dominated the world like water.

Which of these people was not a genius of breathtaking talent?

The紫-robed elder, whose Dao name was Jue Zhen, had once suppressed the Five Great Sects of the world with a single sword a hundred years ago. The Qingming Crone had slaughtered the Jianghu until it ran red with blood when she was young. Even that mud-covered old monster was once a ruthless character capable of tearing a Ninth Realm demon beast apart with his bare hands.

But now...

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth lifted imperceptibly.

Once they arrived at the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, these arrogant old fellows would naturally understand.

The spiritual energy of heaven and earth drawn upon by a Foundation Establishment cultivator in a single breath was enough to overshadow the Martial Dao true intent they had painstakingly cultivated for a hundred years.

A restriction casually placed would be enough to suppress a so-called "Supreme Grandmaster" so they couldn't move.

If they were to encounter a True Lord level existence, a single glance from that person would probably be enough to shatter the dao hearts of these old monsters.

But that was fine too.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, the True Wu Sword humming softly in its sheath.

What the True Wu Peak needed was precisely these geniuses who had pushed Martial Dao to the extreme.

Once their edges were smoothed down by reality, they would naturally become his sharpest swords.
