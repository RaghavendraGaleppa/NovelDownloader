# Chapter 25: Returning Spring

The Western Mountains stretched endlessly, a vast expanse of rolling peaks. The path to Qingfu Temple wasn't long but was hidden and treacherous, with several particularly dangerous sections.

Despite this, Zhou Qing found himself appreciating the long-missed scenery along the mountain trail. The towering peaks were majestic, and by the time they reached the mountainside, mist and clouds already swirled around them, endlessly shifting with the wind. Glancing toward the summit, he could just make out the faint outline of upturned eaves.

Miss Lin, still dressed in male attire, pointed into the distance. "Young Master Zhou, that's Qingfu Temple at the summit."

Though the mountain wasn't particularly high, the clouds rising from its midsection created a scene that stirred something in Zhou Qing's heart.

Would the revered Daoist priest of Qingfu Temple be the immortal cultivator he imagined?

The guards Miss Lin had brought were extraordinary—carrying a stretcher up the mountain along such a rugged, hidden path with steady, unshaken steps.

Zhou Qing, who had been diligently practicing the Deer Play technique, was particularly sensitive to this. He could tell the two guards had exceptionally solid lower-body foundations, likely having trained specifically in leg techniques.

How they compared to his current self would only be known after a match, though Zhou Qing certainly wouldn't pick a fight with Miss Lin's guards for no reason.

Moreover, despite being a woman, Miss Lin displayed remarkable stamina, navigating the steep and hidden mountain path with ease, as if taking a leisurely stroll.

As he had previously guessed, Miss Lin had some martial skills herself.

Counting them out—Blacksmith Hu, Miss Lin, the two guards, and the monk—they were all people Zhou Qing knew who possessed martial abilities.

In this world, martial practitioners were far from rare.

But just how powerful could the most skilled martial artists become? Could reaching the pinnacle of martial arts lead to immortality?

After passing the most treacherous section of the mountain, the path to the summit became much easier. Relaxing, Zhou Qing's thoughts began to wander.

Miss Lin, meanwhile, wore an unusually serene expression along the way.

Though the mountain path was difficult, for a young lady of the Lin family, it was a rare experience. The clouds and mist, the distant birdsong—it all felt like a cleansing of the soul.

She also observed Zhou Qing moving effortlessly up the mountain, though she couldn't discern his particular style.

"Young Master Zhou has his secrets," she mused.

Thinking of the Five-Spice Pills and Zhou Qing's claim of coming from a respectable family, she wondered: "Could his parents have been a branch of some prominent family that fell into hardship and settled in Jiangzhou? That would explain his inherited martial skills. Now that his circumstances have improved, he's likely resumed his family's training."

She knew that foundational skills honed from childhood, if properly supplemented, could be quickly regained even after a few years of neglect.

In her eyes, this was likely Zhou Qing's situation.

"Back when his family was poor, he had to choose between studying and martial training. Now that he has the means, he's naturally picked up his skills again."

"Though managing the Lin family business is hard work, I still have Grandfather's support. Compared to Young Master Zhou, my circumstances are much better."

The thought brought her some comfort, though she also pitied Zhou Qing's background.

At a steady pace, they finally completed the mountain path and arrived outside Qingfu Temple.

Everyone breathed a sigh of relief.

The mountain trail had been treacherous—not only the particularly dangerous midsection but also the dense foliage and swirling mist along the way.

Fortunately, apart from Butcher Hu on the stretcher, everyone else had martial training.

The journey had been uneventful.

An ordinary person would have surely trembled with fear at the midsection, possibly unable to pass.

That Butcher Hu and Blacksmith Hu had accidentally made it to Qingfu Temple as children was understandable—children often had no sense of danger when their courage flared.

This was also why Miss Lin had accompanied them.

She worried Zhou Qing might encounter trouble on the mountain, and with her presence, she could ensure nothing went wrong.

She hadn't expected Zhou Qing wouldn't need her protection.

Miss Lin kept this realization to herself.

From a merchant's perspective, the more capable and mysterious Zhou Qing was, the greater the potential rewards for the Lin family in the future.

The temple's main gate stood at the summit, with additional buildings scattered like stars down the mountainside toward the rear.

The temple's gate was visibly aged.

Miss Lin knocked.

Before long, a dark-haired, long-bearded Daoist with a somewhat simple demeanor opened the door, his expression puzzled—likely because visitors to Qingfu Temple were rare. Yet he also seemed relieved it wasn't bandits or wild beasts.

The temple was sparsely populated now, far from its heyday.

Temples and monasteries built outside cities, especially in mountainous areas, needed the ability to fend off wild beasts, bandits, and even evil spirits with talismanic arts to survive.

Naturally, more people meant better chances.

Thus, when temples grew understaffed, they often fell into ruin—not solely due to the solitude but also practical survival concerns.

"Is Abbot Fushan available? I have a letter from my grandfather, an old acquaintance of his."

The Daoist took the letter without opening it, instead holding it in his hand as he apologized to Miss Lin. "The abbot developed dementia and wandered into the mountains some time ago. Now, I fear... he may have fallen prey to the beasts."

Miss Lin was speechless with shock.

Zhou Qing felt his beautiful illusions shatter.

Before coming, Miss Lin had described Abbot Fushan as a highly skilled healer, deeply admired by her grandfather.

Zhou Qing had even wondered if the abbot might be one of those legendary immortal cultivators.

Now, the gatekeeper's words shattered that fantasy.

Dementia?

That was simply the modern term for Alzheimer's disease.

A revered master like Abbot Fushan, with his profound medical skills, could still succumb to Alzheimer's?

Even if Miss Lin's description was accurate, such a master likely had nothing to do with immortality. And without the old abbot, could the other Daoists in the temple treat Butcher Hu's leg injury?

Zhou Qing could certainly support Butcher Hu, but the man himself surely longed to walk again.

After a moment's thought, Miss Lin said, "I heard the abbot was exceptionally skilled in treating external injuries. Did he pass on his medical knowledge? This man has suffered a severe leg injury and needs expert treatment." She gestured to Butcher Hu.

The Daoist shook his head. "The Return to Spring Talisman Manual the old abbot studied is written in ancient, abstruse text. None of us disciples could decipher it, so we learned other manuals instead. There's likely no one left in the temple who can perform it."

"Return to Spring Talisman Manual? Pah! The Taiyue True Form Talisman Manual I practice is the most difficult in our sect! If our master hadn't favored him before passing, how could that old... senior brother have become abbot?"

A middle-aged, portly Daoist spoke up from atop the wall, hands clasped behind his back as he stood against the wind.

But the ancient wall couldn't bear his weight—perhaps his footing was too heavy. The spot beneath him crumbled, forcing him to slide down, his hands gripping the wall, fingers digging into the masonry to keep from falling.

"And this is...?"

The gatekeeper explained, "This is my uncle, Daoshi Fusong, currently the temple's deputy abbot."

"Zhishan! By the rules, your uncle is now the abbot! Not deputy!" The portly Daoist clearly took issue with the title.
