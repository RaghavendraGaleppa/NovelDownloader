# Chapter 36: A Lone Retreat Over Three Hundred Li  

"The Wang Family actually hired a Foundation Establishment external reinforcement?"  

Wei Qian was initially surprised, but quickly realized the situation.  

Of course. Given how things had escalated, the Wang Family had no choice but to go all out.  

Originally, Wang Shanyin's task had been to blockade the Li Family cultivators, preventing them from participating in the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City's auction. However, Wang Shanyin had acted on his own, attempting to lure out Li Xianyao and eliminate the Li Family in one fell swoop.  

What he hadn't expected was that the spies the Wang Family had planted within the Li Family had long been exposed by Li Xianyao, who had instead used Wang Shanyin's personality against him, turning the tables on the Wang Family.  

Truly, Wang Shanyin was still too young!  

In contrast, Wang Fengri was far more ruthless and decisive.  

Since the younger Wang had already bungled things, why not go all the way?  

With no turning back, he paid a hefty price to hire another Foundation Establishment external reinforcement. The three of them would join forces to encircle and kill the Li Family cultivators.  

Even if this violated the rules and would invite reprimands and sanctions from the higher sects, he didn’t care.  

As long as the deed was done, it would become an established fact.  

The higher sects would never go out of their way to avenge a few dead men!  

"At most, we’ll just have to give up some resources and endure some losses," Wang Fengri thought coldly.  

His tone icy, he ordered the men behind him, "Leave none of the Li Family alive. Chase them down and kill them all!"  

"Yes!" The six cultivators behind him responded in unison before leaping down from the flying vessel.  

In the next moment, their gazes locked onto the Li Family members as they pursued them one by one.  

The Li Family had only four cultivators, while the Wang Family had two extra.  

"Third Brother and I will deal with Li Wanqing."  

"Ninth Brother, Tenth Brother, you two handle Li Wanhai and that brat."  

"As for the one who runs fast, we’ll leave him to you two. How about it?" The leading Wang Family cultivator issued his commands, then turned his gaze to the two black-robed cultivators.  

They were not from the Wang Family but were disciples of that "Brother Shi."  

Hearing the suggestion, they didn’t move immediately.  

"Haha, fellow Daoist. That brat at the fifth level of Qi Refinement—what could he possibly have in his storage pouch worth our effort?"  

"Instead, we brothers will take on that one-armed man."  

A measly fifth-level Qi Refinement junior—what treasures could he possibly have in his storage pouch?  

On the other hand, those two family cultivators looked far more promising.  

Hearing this, the Wang Family cultivator frowned, but his expression smoothed out almost instantly.  

"Very well. Ninth Brother, Tenth Brother, you two go after that brat."  

"When you return, the family will credit you with merit."  

Family cultivators had far stronger cohesion than external ones.  

---  

Upon receiving their orders, the two Wang Family cultivators said nothing. Each slapped a Swift Movement Talisman onto their legs and immediately gave chase to Wei Qian.  

One li, two li, three li—Wei Qian ran without pause, covering ten li in a single breath!  

Even though he had trained in body refinement techniques, he was starting to feel the strain.  

"Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art—this body refinement technique must have an extraordinary origin!"  

"I feel like I can keep running!"  

The technique he had obtained from that burly man only contained the Qi Refinement portion, divided into three stages:  

The first stage corresponded to early Qi Refinement.  

The second stage corresponded to mid Qi Refinement.  

The third stage corresponded to late Qi Refinement.  

Wei Qian had initially thought that the complete Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art was merely a Foundation Establishment-level body refinement technique.  

But now, it seemed this technique's potential was far greater—it might even reach the third tier!  

A technique that could allow a pure body cultivator to rival a Core Formation expert!  

"If I get the chance, I must try to complete the rest of the Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art!" Wei Qian thought.  

He glanced back and sensed two surges of mana desperately closing in.  

In the next moment, Wei Qian’s legs churned like a whirlwind as he tore through the mountain forest!  

"Damn it!"  

The two pursuing Wang Family cultivators felt their legs were about to give out, yet all they could see was Wei Qian’s distant silhouette.  

"Even with a Swift Movement Talisman, I can’t catch up! What the hell did this guy eat to grow up like this?" Wang Jiu cursed from behind.  

These two were pure spellcasters. Though they had trained their bodies and practiced martial arts, compared to a body refinement technique, they were like fireflies trying to outshine the moon.  

If Wei Qian had been at the peak of Qi Refinement, it might have made sense. But he was just a measly fifth-level Qi Refinement nobody—someone they should have been able to crush with a flick of their fingers!  

Their confidence wasn’t unfounded.  

Both were at the sixth level of Qi Refinement and had trained in a joint combat technique that allowed them to contend with late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators when working together!  

"He stopped! He stopped!" Wang Shisan cried out excitedly when he saw the distant figure halt.  

"Quick, let’s catch up!" Wang Jiu urged.  

Wei Qian had run sixty li in one go—they had chased him for sixty li in one go!  

Just as they were about to close the distance, Wei Qian suddenly stood up and flashed them a mocking grin.  

---  

The distance between them was now less than a hundred zhang.  

With a cultivator’s keen eyesight, they could clearly see each other’s movements.  

And what the two Wang Family cultivators saw was Wei Qian pulling out another Swift Movement Talisman from his storage pouch and slapping it onto his legs.  

"Keep chasing, you two," Wei Qian taunted leisurely.  

"You bastard! When we catch you, we’ll tear you to pieces!" Wang Jiu’s eyes burned with fury.  

But no matter how enraged he was, he could only watch helplessly as Wei Qian’s figure grew smaller in the distance.  

"We can’t lose him. Ninth Brother, let’s use a flying artifact to chase him," Wang Shisan suggested.  

"But that’ll drain our mana..." Wang Jiu hesitated.  

"There are two of us. One can control the artifact while the other meditates to recover," Wang Shisan countered.  

Convinced, Wang Jiu nodded.  

"Fine. We’ll take turns. We *will* catch this brat!"  

Hearing the whistling of wind behind him, Wei Qian glanced back while sprinting forward.  

"Flying artifacts? Nice. But I wonder how long your mana will last!"  

His spiritual sense swept over his storage pouch, where a stack of Swift Movement Talismans lay—spoils from his earlier battle with the Sang Brothers.  

One hundred li, one hundred fifty li, two hundred li...  

As time passed, Wei Qian’s lead grew.  

The expressions of the pursuing Wang Family cultivators shifted from fury to disbelief, then bitterness, and finally despair.  

After chasing for so long, their mana was nearly depleted.  

Meditation alone couldn’t restore it fast enough—they had been stuffing themselves with Qi Restoration Pills. Now, even those were running out.  

If this continued, they’d have to start draining spirit stones for recovery.  

Another hundred li later, the two Wang Family cultivators wore numb expressions.  

"Ninth Brother, he stopped again," Wang Shisan muttered reflexively.  

At first, they had been thrilled whenever Wei Qian paused. But after repeated disappointments, they realized he was toying with them—every time they got close, he would sprint away again.  

But this time was different.  

"Ninth Brother! He’s meditating to recover his mana!" Wang Shisan’s voice rose sharply.
