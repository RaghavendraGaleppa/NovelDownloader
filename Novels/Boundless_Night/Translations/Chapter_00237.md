## Chapter 237: Elder Cui's Heartache

Qin Ming realized the situation was dire. Only those who knew and had studied him could find him.

Just like at the Luofu Immortal Mountain ruins, Wang Caiwei recognized him through small details.

Qin Ming furrowed his brow. He was clearly being comprehensively targeted by the Cui clan, who sought to completely eliminate him.

There were many spiritual birds flying above the plateau, most of them carrying memory crystals to transmit messages.

The blood of the auspicious beast had drawn various factions to contend for it. The Cui clan, recognizing Qin Ming's extraordinary nature, had also come to this place, and based on his striking combat achievements, quickly narrowed down a small group of suspicious targets.

Among the newly reborn, the number of young talents displaying exceptional abilities was limited, and a few individuals immediately stood out.

“It seems I was careless. The Cui clan is sifting through my actions, habitual movements, and so on…”

Back then, Wang Caiwei, using the subtle information provided by the Wang clan, had been able to "understand him thoroughly."

The Cui clan had people who attended to his daily needs, and even more "relatives and acquaintances" who could provide more detailed "information."

Evidently, the specific footage recorded by the spiritual birds in the sky via memory crystals had been carefully compared by the Cui clan. It was easy to filter him out from a small group of people.

Changing his appearance might fool outsiders, but it couldn't hide him from attentive "relatives and acquaintances."

Thinking carefully, as long as Qin Ming participated in the war on the plateau and displayed astonishing performance, he would be "like an awl in a sack." It would be abnormal if those who knew him best didn't discover him upon close scrutiny.

However, why had the Cui clan suddenly become so "attentive" to him?

Qin Ming's heart turned cold. It must be that some of his "achievements" had been exposed, making them restless and sensing a hint of threat.

In fact, that was precisely the case. The Cui clan had confirmed that he had consecutively slain ancient fiends of extraordinary blood in the world's edge region, which was severely beyond the expected scope of his abilities.

“And are they suspecting me of having mastered the Poshu Scripture?” Qin Ming knew that this matter would eventually be exposed.

The more extraordinary he appeared, the more the Cui clan would suspect, after all, he had not had access to techniques like Rulai Force or Yuqing Force before.

Only the Poshu Scripture was something he had been practicing since childhood.

With spiritual birds carrying memory crystals, discerning acquaintances could detect that his Heavenly Radiance Force was not among the well-known techniques.

After all, techniques like Sky-Supporting, Rulai, and Six Imperial Forces were known throughout the world.

Excluding the most powerful techniques in the world, everything else would be traceable.

Starting with his Heavenly Radiance Force, the Cui clan could make a significant discovery.

Qin Ming reflected that his recent path had been too smooth, making him a bit careless.

Actually, his caution was useless. As long as his performance astonished the plateau, those people, unless they were fools, would notice.

…

“It really is you!” Cui Changkong’s chest had a gaping hole xuyên through it, front to back, and his voice was weak.

Qin Ming made no attempt to conceal himself; his actions and words explained everything.

“Your grandson misses you.”

This plain sentence broke Cui Changkong’s composure. Veins bulged on his forehead, and his body trembled slightly.

He suppressed the turmoil in his heart, unwilling to die just yet, and even more eager to avenge his grandson.

He took a deep breath, calming himself, trying to buy time.

“You went to Black White Mountain and had a stroke of luck, mastering the Poshu Scripture, and even obtaining an Ethereal Bamboo Shoot.” At this moment, Cui Changkong even resented Cui Qi.

Qin Ming was speechless. The Cui clan actually believed it.

They thought he wasn’t restricted by the five rebirths per year because, as Meng Xinghai had said, he had consumed an Ethereal Bamboo Shoot.

Qin Ming smiled. Even if he told the other party that he was simply exceptionally gifted and that the so-called hurdles of the Path of Rebirth couldn’t stop him, they probably wouldn’t believe him.

He wasted no time, wielding his Mutton-fat Jade Iron Saber and closing in. “I’ll send you on your way.”

Cui Changkong’s face turned alternating shades of green and white. Under normal circumstances, he should have been looking down on a junior in the Second Realm.

Yet now, a mere youth was treating him with contempt!

His body rapidly transformed, and in an instant, he became a stout Moon-gazing Rhinoceros.

He had taken the path of mutation, capable of transforming into a demon.

Qin Ming paused, then understood. The old man only had half a heart left, his strength greatly diminished. He was now adopting a conservative battle strategy, waiting for reinforcements.

Cui Changkong looked at the saber in Qin Ming’s hand, as white and pure as jade, extremely wary, fearing a single slice would decapitate him. His current form was massive, with tough hide and thick flesh, capable of taking a few blows.

“Since you wish to suffer, I shall oblige you.” Qin Ming moved like a phantom god traveling through night mist, disappearing with each step, his speed incredible.

He circled Cui Changkong, striking with his saber. The white blade, like a carving of beautiful jade, shimmered with colorful mists. With every strike, blood splattered.

Cui Changkong was naturally not passively taking the blows. Various special symbols shimmered on his rough rhinoceros hide, and the horn on his head shot out beams of light, wishing to instantly kill his opponent.

Alas, with half a heart missing, every time he channeled power, his body was pushed beyond its limits and couldn't bear the strain.

And every time he exerted force, the large, burned-through hole in his chest would gush blood.

Cui Changkong foresaw his inescapable death and said, “Qin Ming, you ungrateful junior, if not for my Cui clan, would you be where you are today?”

Qin Ming’s face immediately darkened. He really wanted to say: I thank your eight generations of ancestors!

He struck like lightning, his speed increasing once more. In an instant, he cleaved the Moon-gazing Rhinoceros twenty-eight times, moving like a ghost.

Every strike drew blood. In a blink of an eye, this thick-skinned giant rhinoceros was covered in large cracks, constantly spurting blood.

Cui Changkong endured unbearable pain. This was essentially torture by slow slicing.

Qin Ming disappeared with each step, his long saber continuously slashing. In an instant, the Moon-gazing Rhinoceros looked as if its flesh was being flayed, exposing bones, like a master butcher dismembering an ox.

Cui Changkong howled miserably. He regretted it, wishing he had died quickly instead of suffering such torment!

With a clang, his rhinoceros horn was severed, and most of his cultivation base was ruined.

Qin Ming stood on his back, raising the Mutton-fat Jade Iron Saber, its bright blade light soaring into the sky.

Then, he swung the saber downwards. With a *thump*, a massive head fell to the ground, blood gushing out. Cui Changkong died in agony.

This was the first time Qin Ming had killed a Third Realm expert in their full state, which held extraordinary significance for him.

Regardless of the means used, the immense losses he had suffered in the past, and the lingering shadows in his heart, were gradually dissipating.

Under the night sky, an iron arrow tore through the air, another spiritual bird exploded, and blood-soaked feathers drifted down.

Qin Ming had eliminated all nearby "witnesses."

After swiftly cleaning up the battlefield, he left without looking back.

Among the few he killed, Cui Chongshheng had the most distinguished status, being the legitimate grandson of Grand Elder Cui Five.

“Old man, you bullied me when I was young. Today, I’ll give you a taste of heartache!”

Qin Ming could imagine the grim expression on Grand Elder Cui Five’s old face when he received the news.

In fact, a few months ago, Grand Elder Cui Five had attempted to harm him but was stopped by Li Qingyun.

Having finished his business, he shook out his robes, feeling a slight release of pent-up frustration.

…

Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and their small group of experts received urgent intelligence.

Cui Changkong’s group had attacked first. Based on the timing, the two sides should have engaged, and results would be imminent.

At the same time, they already knew that at least three groups, all radicals, were rushing to the location.

“Why do I feel a little uneasy? Nothing bad will happen, will it?” Cui Cheng frowned, feeling something was amiss.

“There might be a problem. Some spiritual birds have been shot down, and the remaining ones didn’t dare approach that area!”

“Investigate immediately!”

The expressions of Cui Changming, Cui Cheng, and the others changed.

Indeed, terrible news arrived!

A Thunder Falcon approached the area and found bloodstains and the headless corpse of a Moon-gazing Rhinoceros lying on the ground.

“They… are all dead?”

“Changkong was decapitated, and Fifth Brother’s grandson Chongshheng also died. Our Cui clan members didn’t die at the hands of demons, but at his hands?” Cui Changming’s fingers were clenched until they turned pale.

They knew that Grand Elder Cui Five would surely be furious. Cui Chongshheng was his highly favored legitimate grandson, and he would likely personally leave the clan to settle accounts.

“How old is he? Has he been on the Path of Rebirth for ten months? He absolutely couldn't have achieved that. He must have a powerful protector with him!”

They refused to believe this was something Qin Ming could have done.

Cui Changkong alone was an insurmountable hurdle for him!

They were convinced that a grand expert was accompanying Qin Ming.

“Can we contact the others? Stop them immediately, don’t let them get close!” Cui Changming said, then glared fiercely at Cui Cheng.

“It’s too late. By my calculations, the other group should have already approached him.”

Cui Cheng’s heart pounded with unease; he already regretted it.

Elder figures like Cui Changming were heartbroken. It was truly unacceptable for Cui clan members to bleed on the plateau in such a manner. No more people could die.

In truth, the more you fear something, the more likely it is to happen.

At this moment, deep within the vast grasslands, several corpses lay at Qin Ming’s feet. His pure white Jade Iron Saber dripped with blood. Four young men were already dead, their heads separated from their bodies.

One middle-aged man was still alive, but barely, his breath like gossamer threads, having lost all combat ability. There was a large, scorched hole in his chest and abdomen.

Undoubtedly, Qin Ming had used his old trick, temporarily fusing the Essence of Starfire with his Heavenly Radiance Force to inflict severe damage on the opponent.

The middle-aged man, Cui Qing, possessed light green long hair. He had reached the Third Realm, Spirit Field, around the age of forty, which was quite extraordinary.

Upon meeting Qin Ming, he had immediately reached out to grab him, believing that even if the youth before him had mastered the Poshu Scripture, or was even a reincarnated deity, he couldn't withstand a single strike from him.

However, reality was cruel. The hand he reached out was gone, and his body was now transparent from front to back.

Qin Ming recognized these people, and was even somewhat familiar with a few individuals. But since they were opponents, he had to act ruthlessly.

If not for the unusual color of Cui Qing’s hair, he would have already been decapitated.

Qin Ming looked at his green hair, knowing what cultivation technique he practiced.

Immediately, his eyes burned with desire, attempting to obtain the true scripture.

“You little brat, you still dare to covet the ‘Abiding World Scripture’? Dream on!” Cui Qing was uncooperative.

The Abiding World Scripture was very famous in the Night Mist World. It was a scripture that came after the Yi Wood Scripture, transcending the scope of mere miraculous techniques, making it an arcane classic.

It was renowned throughout the world not only for the miraculous methods it recorded, but primarily because, if one could master it, it could extend one’s lifespan by "half a lifetime"!

Although it was extremely difficult to learn, even some old ancestors were studying it.

Among them, the Cui clan's old ancestor, who had diligently studied the Abiding World Scripture and cultivated in seclusion for two hundred years, had surprisingly managed to emerge alive.

Qin Ming used the back of his saber to strike Cui Qing’s face, instantly mangling it and dislodging teeth.

In an instant, Cui Qing was enraged, his emotions fluctuating violently.

“It’s not like I haven’t practiced it before,” Qin Ming said, taking the opportunity to "guide" him, and began reciting the Abiding World Scripture.

Earlier, in Scarlet Glow City, he had won six or seven pages of the scripture from Cui He and Cui Shuning.

In the distance, a Thunder Falcon was delivering news: “Bad news, the second team has encountered the youth, and after a brief conflict, that area has fallen silent again.”

At once, Cui Cheng, Cui Changming, and other Cui clan elders from the middle and senior generations, made their guesses, all feeling boundless heartache.
