# Chapter 21: Formation Talisman  

After a while, Lin Xuan nodded, seemingly accepting Zhao Ming's explanation. This made Zhao Ming breathe a sigh of relief. Little did he know that despite Lin Xuan's calm expression, his heart was filled with overwhelming joy.  

Originally, becoming the manager of the Waste Pill Storage Room was only the first step in Lin Xuan's plan.  

The second step was to familiarize himself with the situation, examine the records, and figure out how to exploit loopholes to falsify accounts and discreetly divert waste pills—a process that required extreme caution to avoid detection.  

But to his surprise, things turned out to be much simpler than he had imagined.  

The storage and management of the waste pills were in complete disarray, with no proper records whatsoever. In other words, no one had any idea how many waste pills were stored here. This meant Lin Xuan didn’t even need to go through the trouble of falsifying accounts—he could freely take as many as he wanted without fear of discovery.  

At this thought, a faint smile crept onto Lin Xuan’s lips.  

"Immortal Master, Immortal Master."  

A voice reached his ears. Lin Xuan turned to see Zhao Ming looking at him with slight confusion. A jolt of alarm shot through Lin Xuan’s heart, and he immediately reminded himself: *I mustn’t be so careless in the future. Those who achieve great things must learn to conceal their emotions—no one should be able to read my thoughts from my expression.*  

"It’s nothing," Lin Xuan shook his head, feigning nonchalance. "I was just surprised that the duties of managing the Waste Pill Storage Room are so light. It seems I’ll be able to enjoy some leisure time."  

"Ah, don’t worry, Immortal Master. Our Waste Pill Storage Room barely has any work to begin with. Even if there are minor tasks, I’ll take care of them for you," Zhao Ming said ingratiatingly. From now on, Lin Xuan would be his direct superior, so it was only natural to curry favor.  

Lin Xuan neither agreed nor disagreed. He had Zhao Ming lead him around to inspect the rest of the area before selecting a quiet room as his personal quarters.  

Then, Lin Xuan gathered all the attendants and laid down some rules. First and foremost, no one was allowed to step within ten paces of his quarters without his permission.  

The attendants had no objections to this. Though they were merely outer sect disciples, they understood the customs of the immortal world. Typically, every cultivator had their own secrets. High-level cultivators possessed cave dwellings protected by layers of restrictions—unauthorized trespassers would be killed without mercy!  

Low-level cultivators might not have the power to own private cave dwellings, but their personal quarters were similarly off-limits to outsiders.  

Thus, Lin Xuan’s demand seemed perfectly reasonable to them, and they harbored no suspicions.  

After dismissing the attendants, Lin Xuan returned to his room. He lay on the bed, resting for a while as he mentally reviewed the day’s events, ensuring there were no flaws in his actions.  

---  

Everything had gone smoothly, and the source of the Body Tempering Pills was now secured.  

Different stages of cultivation required different pills. Body Tempering Pills were suitable for the Qi Refining Stage—the lowest tier of cultivation—while Foundation Establishment cultivators needed more advanced pills like Foundation Establishment Pills and Essence Nurturing Pills.  

Although the success rate of refining higher-tier pills was even lower, their waste products still had other uses and wouldn’t be carelessly discarded like the waste Body Tempering Pills.  

Nevertheless, at least for the Qi Refining Stage, Lin Xuan now had a steady supply of pills. As for the Foundation Establishment Stage, that was still too far off—he was only at the second layer of Qi Refining. There was no point in overreaching.  

After carefully considering everything, Lin Xuan sat up from the bed. He reached into his robes and pulled out a jade-green bracelet—Zhou Yan’s storage bracelet, now his.  

Of course, he wasn’t foolish enough to wear it openly, as that would be tantamount to admitting his involvement in the disappearances of Zhou Yan and Zhang Yu. Instead, he kept it hidden on his person.  

He channeled his spiritual sense into the bracelet and retrieved a talisman—a formation talisman.  

The world of cultivation was vast and all-encompassing, with not only miraculous techniques but also wondrous formations. For example, the protective formations of sects and the restrictions set up by high-level cultivators around their cave dwellings were mostly formations.  

Generally, setting up a formation required pre-prepared formation flags, formation disks, and other magical tools. However, such items were far beyond Lin Xuan’s reach—not only could he not afford them, but even if he could, his current cultivation level was insufficient to operate them. They were meant for high-level cultivators.  

So, what could low-level cultivators use as an alternative?  

Of course, there was one.  

Just as spiritual tools were simplified versions of magical treasures, formation talismans allowed one to set up formations without the need for formation flags or disks.  

Formation talismans were a type of talisman, but while ordinary talismans sealed spells within them, formation talismans sealed entire formations.  

Naturally, these formations were the simplest and most basic, with limited power. However, they had clear advantages—they were easy to use and consumed minimal spiritual energy, making them accessible even to low-level cultivators.  

Lin Xuan hesitated. Unlike formations set up with flags and disks—which could be reused if undamaged—formations activated through talismans were one-time use. Out of the twenty-some talismans he had obtained from Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan, only one was a formation talisman.  

After a moment’s thought, Lin Xuan still decided to proceed. He channeled spiritual energy from his dantian while chanting an incantation. In an instant, the talisman burst into radiant light and began to burn.  

With a flick of his wrist, Lin Xuan tossed it into the air and shouted, "Activate!"  

Immediately, the spiritual energy triggered the sealed formation. The burning talisman transformed into a small yin-yang Bagua diagram, which rapidly expanded and flew out of the room, enveloping the entire house.  

Soon, the glowing Bagua dimmed, and all traces of the phenomenon vanished. The surroundings returned to normal—but this was only an illusion. The formation had been successfully deployed around his quarters. If anyone dared to trespass, the restrictions would activate.  

After all, Lin Xuan harbored secrets he couldn’t afford to reveal. If someone witnessed his pill purification process, it would spell disaster. Though the attendants, as outer sect disciples, wouldn’t dare defy his orders and enter his quarters without permission, it was better to err on the side of caution.  

This formation might be simple, but ordinary people would never be able to breach it. And since no cultivators visited the Waste Pill Storage Room, this arrangement should be foolproof.
