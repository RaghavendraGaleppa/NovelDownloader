# Chapter 28: Mastering Five Spiritual Farming Spells  

Over the course of a month, the pea projectiles fired by the Peashooter had grown in power, advancing from the Qi Refinement First Layer to the Second Layer.  

Gu Mo's current combat strength was roughly at this level, meaning each Peashooter now effectively doubled his offensive output. Through his research, Gu Mo had also discovered additional functionalities of the Peashooter. It had two attack modes: the first was fully automatic, where it would attack all enemies within its range.  

Determining friend from foe was left to Gu Mo's discretion. For now, he had classified small spirit beasts like the Black Spirit Rat—creatures that posed a threat to the spirit fields—as enemies. Meanwhile, all human cultivators were whitelisted to prevent accidental attacks on visitors.  

However, if a cultivator attempted to harm Gu Mo, he could switch to the second mode—manual control—where the Peashooter would attack only the targets he specified.  

Of course, the Peashooter wasn't without flaws. Its two biggest weaknesses were its immobility and slow attack speed. Once planted, it couldn't move, leaving it vulnerable if discovered. Additionally, it required time to absorb spiritual energy and condense it into peas before firing. This also meant that in areas devoid of spiritual energy, the Peashooter would be unable to attack.  

Yet, these shortcomings weren't insurmountable. The slow attack speed could be compensated for with numbers. Currently, Gu Mo could acquire a new Peashooter with Qi Refinement Second Layer strength every twenty days. Planting a dozen or so would naturally resolve the issue.  

As for the problem of spiritual energy depletion in barren land, Gu Mo had a solution: planting the Peashooters in pots embedded with spirit stones. Before obtaining his own spirit field, he had used this method to cultivate Sunflowers. The pots also addressed the immobility issue, though at the cost of consuming more spirit stones.  

The Peashooters provided Gu Mo with a newfound sense of security. With just a few of them, cultivators at the early stages of Qi Refinement would pose little threat. And with enough Peashooters, he might even stand a chance against mid-stage Qi Refinement opponents.  

For Gu Mo—who couldn't cultivate at full capacity due to lacking a concealment technique—the Peashooter was nothing short of a treasure. Unlike the Sunflowers, which drastically accelerated cultivation and would draw unwanted attention if exposed, the Peashooter was merely an offensive plant in the eyes of others. While offensive spirit plants were rare, they weren't unheard of.  

Moreover, with the Peashooter's current power limited to the Qi Refinement Second Layer, mid-stage cultivators would likely dismiss it as an impractical combat plant. As for those below mid-stage, Gu Mo could handle them easily even without the Peashooters.  

Still, Gu Mo had no intention of revealing the Peashooters unnecessarily. After all, they differed significantly from conventional offensive spirit plants.  

Convinced of their effectiveness, Gu Mo dedicated all his Sun Essence to purchasing more Peashooters. Their true potential could only be realized in numbers. He settled on five—enough to deal with threats below mid-stage Qi Refinement. Mid-stage opponents were beyond his current capabilities, but they rarely bothered with mere outer sect disciples like him unless he possessed something truly valuable.  

Planting the five Peashooters in the spirit field—positioned north, south, east, west, and center—effectively eliminated small spirit beast intrusions. As for spirit insects, the Peashooters could intercept them before they entered the field.  

However, Gu Mo ordered the Peashooters to cease fire once insects breached the field. The reason was simple: the peas were too indiscriminate, and their attacks would damage the spirit rice. Thus, any pests that made it past the Peashooters had to be dealt with manually.  

Fortunately, with the Peashooters acting as the first line of defense, the number of invading insects dwindled drastically, reducing Gu Mo's workload. By the time he had five Peashooters, barely any insects made it through.  

Free from pests and rodent infestations, and with his mastery of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique steadily improving, the spirit rice flourished. The heavy, golden ears promised a harvest far surpassing the previous season's yield.  

What's more, the maturation period had shortened once again—from five months to just over four. Coincidentally, this marked Gu Mo's first full year as a spirit farmer in the Spirit Planting Hall.  

Within this year, he had mastered all five specialized farming spells, with the most challenging—Minor Revival Technique—being achieved just days prior. Mastering all five in a single year was nothing short of prodigious.  

In the entire Spirit Planting Hall, only three senior spirit farmers had accomplished this feat. Now, Gu Mo was the fourth.  

If he were to reveal his achievement, he would undoubtedly be promoted to an outer sect disciple immediately. While this was a goal Gu Mo desired, now wasn't the time. Mastering all five spells in a year would raise too many eyebrows, and attention was the last thing he needed given his secrets.  

Instead, he decided to wait a few more years before showcasing his abilities. By then, his progress would seem more plausible given his previously demonstrated aptitude. A few years meant little to cultivators with extended lifespans, where death often came not from old age but from conflicts and battles over resources.  

Aside from mastering the five spells, Gu Mo had also amassed considerable wealth: five Sunflowers, five Peashooters, a damaged array disk, 151 spirit stones, 50 catties of spirit rice, and a pseudo-spirit beast—a koi fish.  

Excluding the unique Sunflowers and Peashooters, these were substantial gains for a first-year outer sect disciple. And with the new harvest imminent, his wealth was set to increase even further.  

True to his expectations, the spirit rice ripened after four months—coinciding with his one-year anniversary at the Spirit Planting Hall. Just as he prepared to harvest, another letter from Yao Shifeng arrived.
