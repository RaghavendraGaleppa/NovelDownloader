**Chapter 25: Investing in Those Returning Home, The Realization of Accumulating Small Gains**

On the road from Autumn Water Pavilion to Divine Weapon Mountain.

After about an incense stick's time, the mountain gate was already visible ahead. At this moment, a long queue had formed in front of the mountain gate. An outer sect deacon sat there, greeting people and seeing them off, with a stack of identity tokens piled in front of him.

"Disciple Li," the old woman, upon seeing Li Mo, proactively bowed. Though True Disciples held no real power within the sect, their status was undeniably higher than that of an outer sect deacon. Li Mo found the old woman somewhat familiar; she was the one who had examined his bones that day and determined his talent to be C-grade.

The surrounding outer sect disciples, coming to hand in their tokens, all looked at his white cloud-patterned robe with envy and longing. Yet, no one hesitated; one by one, they handed their tokens to the old woman, shouldered their belongings, and walked out of the mountain gate.

"What are they doing?" Li Mo couldn't help but be curious. "Currently, it shouldn't be time to clear out outer sect disciples yet, right? Why are so many people lining up to hand in their tokens, looking as if they're leaving the Clear Abyss Sect?"

"Because the sect trial is imminent," the old woman replied. "Since it's called a trial, it naturally carries a certain level of danger." She extended her left hand, revealing only three fingers remaining out of five.

"So that's how it is." Li Mo pondered for a moment and understood the old woman's meaning. Not everyone had the confidence to contend for a spot in the inner sect. Those who remained would have to participate in the sect trial. If they ended up disabled and still failed to enter the inner sect, then were expelled from the sect, even their future livelihoods would be a problem. It wasn't impossible to die in the trial either.

"Many, after entering the sect, never even thought of joining the inner sect." The old woman shook her head, casually placing the freshly collected tokens aside. Learning some skills in the outer sect and returning home to open a martial arts hall, or perhaps becoming a constable—this was considered an excellent future in the eyes of many.

Li Mo couldn't help but feel a pang of emotion. The martial path was a river flowing against the current; most people weren't even fish swimming upstream, but merely grains of sand swept along by the river. If not for the 'cheat' he possessed, his future likely wouldn't be much better. He would probably return to the county, and under his father's arrangements, settle for being a city guard captain.

He was about to leave, but as if by some ghostly prompting, he still used his constantly active Heavenly Mandate Divine Eye to survey the crowd before him, one person at a time. Instantly, information about many people appeared before his eyes.

**[Name: Wu Bing]**
**[Age: 19]**
**[Root Bone: None.]**
**[Cultivation: Blood Qi Realm, Three Meridians.]**
**[Mandate: White]**
**[Evaluation: Ah Bing's martial arts achievements are not very ideal.]**
**[Recent Encounter: Recently received a letter that Widow Wang at the village head's third husband has died. He is preparing to return home to pursue love.]**

Looking around, among this group of outer sect disciples voluntarily leaving the Clear Abyss Sect, most had white or grey mandates. They also generally had no investment value. For example, this one named Wu Bing. If he helped him pursue Widow Wang, what reward could he possibly get in the end? At worst, a few copper coins; at best, perhaps a special item, such as Widow Wang's belly band...

Of course, there were exceptions to everything.

**[Name: Liu Hui]**
**[Age: 19]**
**[Root Bone: None.]**
**[Cultivation: Blood Qi Realm, Three Meridians.]**
**[Mandate: Black]**
**[Evaluation: A classic unfortunate soul, a magnet for bad luck.]**
**[Recent Encounter: On his way home, he will encounter a 'xianren tiao' (honey trap/scam). He will fail to be a hero saving a beauty, instead being stabbed in the back by the woman and thrown into the river to feed the fish.]**

After Li Mo finished reading, he let out a soft sigh. It's a life, after all. He told himself he couldn't just stand by indifferently to everything. Even for strangers, as long as there wasn't a deep-seated hatred, he wouldn't wish to see them die inexplicably.

"Liu Hui!"

"Uh... hmm? Disciple Li?" Liu Hui was stunned, pointing at himself, seemingly unable to believe that this Li True Disciple, who had ascended to prominence in a single step, had called out his name. He racked his brains but couldn't understand what connection he had to the other person.
