**Chapter 19: The Dagger Revealed, Killing Intent Explodes!**

"Hengcheng Martial Artist Association President, Dong Buwei!"

Dong Buwei calmly looked at the two experts from the Heavenly God Cult before him, his eyes devoid of emotion.

At this moment, Liu Kuang, who was battling another Viscera Tempering Realm expert, burst into laughter. "Hahahaha, you brats from the Heavenly God Cult, do you really think there are no experts left in our Hengcheng?!"

With that, his attacks became even more ferocious. Each punch tore through the air, emitting a sharp, piercing sound.

The two Heavenly God Cult experts' expressions darkened, but they didn't show much panic. They exchanged a glance, and one of them sneered. "Then let us see what the esteemed President of the Hengcheng Martial Artist Association is truly capable of!"

Having spoken, the two also made their moves, swirling spiritual energy as they engaged Dong Buwei in battle within the room. Yet, even with both of them attacking together, Dong Buwei remained at ease. As a peak Viscera Tempering Realm expert and the President of a city's Martial Artist Association, how could his combat strength be low? Moreover, the two Heavenly God Cult experts were not top-tier Viscera Tempering Realm practitioners. Dong Buwei could naturally handle them with ease.

But suddenly, several more shadowy figures rushed in from outside.

The moment the person's words fell, the five Blood Tempering Realm experts who had just charged in split into two groups. Four of them attacked Dong Buwei, while the remaining one shot straight towards Su Yu, who was currently in a state of enlightenment.

Dong Buwei's pupils constricted sharply. "You're seeking death!"

Rage surged in Dong Buwei's heart. He instantly unleashed terrifying power. However, no matter how strong Dong Buwei was, he was still only a single Viscera Tempering Realm expert. Don't forget, the Heavenly God Cult also had two Viscera Tempering Realm experts on their side! Although they weren't as strong as Dong Buwei, two Viscera Tempering Realm experts combined with four Blood Tempering Realm experts were enough to hold him back.

"Hahahaha, old man, even if you kill us, that brat will still die. Do you really think we'd dare to proactively attack a city without thorough preparations?!" A black-robed figure cackled, blocking the enraged Dong Buwei's path.

"You..."

Though Dong Buwei was seething with fury, facing the combined might of six individuals, even he found it incredibly difficult to break free in a short amount of time.

"It's just a pity, why did that figure disappear? And why did that figure feel so familiar to me?" Su Yu wondered, gazing into the distance with a hint of confusion.

However, time did not allow Su Yu to ponder. Suddenly, he felt a powerful surge of killing intent.

"Hm?"

Su Yu frowned slightly, a sense of unease rising within him. He immediately withdrew from his sea of consciousness.

In reality...

The Blood Tempering Realm expert from the Heavenly God Cult gazed fervently at the young man meditating on the ground, his heart pounding with excitement. "To think I would one day be able to kill a Golden Prodigy!"

"As long as I eliminate him, I will surely earn the favor of Lord Heavenly God. By then, even achieving the Grandmaster realm will be within reach!"

A Grandmaster!

One must know that he had only just stepped into the Blood Tempering Realm. Yet, the reward for slaying this Golden Prodigy before him would be enough to help him advance to Grandmaster!
