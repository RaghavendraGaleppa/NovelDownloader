Chapter 110: Death

Zhou Tian listened in silence the entire way, as Mu Su reminisced about the past: his father's broad shoulders, his mother's loving care, and their innocent childhood affection. Zhou Tian didn't interrupt. What Mu Su needed now was not someone to console him. He understood the situation better than anyone else; he had seen countless times how people treated those who believed in evil gods, and had even personally acted against them.

After walking for several hours, the two finally reached Mu Su's town. Zhou Tian and Mu Su stopped a short distance away. With Mu Su's keen eyesight, he clearly saw his own face among a row of images plastered below the city gates. Guards were meticulously checking every person entering and exiting the city.

"What now?" Zhou Tian asked. This was Mu Su's home; they couldn't just charge in and start a massacre.

"It's fine, we can sneak in. This is just a small town. The strongest people here are only two: my teacher, and myself." Mu Su frowned, unsure how his parents would react to him.

It was still night in the God-Forsaken Land. The two stealthily approached the city wall. Zhou Tian instantly teleported inside, and after confirming no one was present, he signaled for Mu Su to follow. The town was indeed very small, with a white-domed church standing in its center. According to Mu Su, his home was right behind the church.

They quickly reached the location. It was just as Mu Su said; there was no one powerful enough in this place to detect them. Although Mu Su's father was the town's bishop, his home wasn't lavish. It looked like any other house around it, save for a carving of a Man Tan flower on its door.

Currently, the two were crouching on the rooftop. Mu Su's eyes were somewhat lost, and a closer look revealed his body was trembling slightly.

"They are your parents, after all, they shouldn't..." Zhou Tian didn't know what to say, only offering comfort.

"No, you don't understand." Mu Su glanced at Zhou Tian, complex emotions swirling in his eyes.

Zhou Tian remained silent.

Taking a deep breath, Mu Su surveyed his surroundings, and after confirming no one was present, he jumped off the roof, pushed open the door, and walked inside. Zhou Tian stayed on the roof, unmoving. It was a family matter; why should he interfere?

Time passed minute by minute. Zhou Tian's brow furrowed. Not a single sound came from the house. No matter what, there should at least be scolding if not worse, but instead, an eerie silence prevailed. After waiting a little longer, footsteps echoed from the street. A figure emerged from the distance, a sword strapped to their waist, heading straight for the house.

A flicker of thought crossed Zhou Tian's eyes, and he instantly moved into the house. The moment he saw the scene inside, Zhou Tian was speechless. In the dim light, a white Man Tan flower statue stood in the center of the room. Two people knelt beneath it, dressed in white robes, their faces aged. They were embraced, eyes tightly shut, seemingly devoid of life.

Mu Su knelt beside them, tears streaming down his face, his eyes vacant. His right fingernails dug deep into his flesh, blood flowing onto the ground. His left hand clutched a note with a single line of writing: "May the Lord forgive our son; we are willing to atone for his sins." The identities of these two were obvious: they were Mu Su's parents. Unexpectedly, they had chosen to sacrifice their own lives to implore the Holy Lord for Mu Su's forgiveness. Between faith and familial love, they had chosen to sacrifice themselves.

Zhou Tian didn't know how to speak. It seemed whatever he said, Mu Su wouldn't hear it. But someone was likely to come; he would just deal with them later.

*Thump-thump*, a knock sounded at the door. Mu Su's eyes remained vacant, as if he hadn't heard it.

*Thump-thump!* The sound came again. Mu Su still didn't react.

*Creak*, the door was pushed open. Zhou Tian was speechless. *Brother, if they don't open the door, you leave! Why did you push your way in?*

"Who are you?!"
"Mu Su?!"
"Bishop Mulag?!"
"What have you done to Bishop Mulag?!"

A rapid-fire volley of startled shouts. Zhou Tian helplessly turned his head. "Could you be a little quieter?"

It was an old man, his face already showing many wrinkles, his eye sockets sunken, and his eyes bloodshot.

"Evil God worshiper!" The man roared, clearly recognizing Zhou Tian. "You're the one who seduced Mu Su into depravity!" Without another word, he drew his sword and attacked. The blade flashed with white light, incredibly sharp.

Zhou Tian caught the incoming longsword with his left hand, storing it away, then struck the opponent with his right. This opponent wasn't Boer; he was just an old knight.

*Thump!* With a muffled thud, the opponent flew backward. Zhou Tian didn't give him a chance. Fifteen fist-sized fireballs appeared and directly smashed into him. Although [Flame Burst] wasn't automatically tracking and was often dodged, it depended on who the opponent was. For a low-level old knight like this, it was quite difficult, especially after Zhou Tian had already countered his attack.

*Boom! Boom!* The fireballs slammed squarely into his body, each dealing 5% of his current health. Fifteen hits... Zhou Tian wasn't good at math, so he didn't bother calculating, but the old man was probably half-dead, vomiting blood uncontrollably.

"Zhou Tian, spare his life. He... he's my teacher." Mu Su's hoarse voice came from behind.

Zhou Tian shrugged. He only had these few simple tricks; it was actually quite difficult for him to kill people.

"Mu Su, are you still not clear-headed?! Bishop Mulag sacrificed his life for the Lord to forgive you!" The old knight, lying on the ground, shouted, his voice filled with disappointment. He had also seen the note clutched in Mu Su's hand.

"Begging for forgiveness?" Mu Su was like dynamite lit by a flame. "What did I do wrong that requires his forgiveness?! Colluding with Evil God worshipers? What is evil, what is righteous? Is it defined by the so-called Lord?" Mu Su now realized how ridiculous the Holy Church was.

Zhou Tian took two steps back. It looked like Mu Su was about to erupt; he ceded the stage.

"Blasphemy! You have been so deeply corrupted by the evil god that you can't extricate yourself!" The old knight struggled to his feet, trying to block Mu Su.

Mu Su's expression was cold. He sidestepped the incoming slash and punched the old knight several meters away, showing no mercy whatsoever. "Teacher, this is the last time I will call you that. Don't stop me again." Turning, he picked up the two old people and walked out with firm steps.

Due to the noise of the fight, many people were already rushing toward the house. When Mu Su exited, dozens of silver-armored knights were already waiting. There would have been even more if a portion hadn't been taken by him to Cela City to escort the Saintess. Zhou Tian followed behind him, casually picking up the old knight's sword.

"Put down Bishop Mulag!" someone among the knights shouted.

"These are my parents. I will bury them myself!" Mu Su said indifferently.
