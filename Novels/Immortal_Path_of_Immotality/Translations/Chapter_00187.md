# Chapter 185: Slaying the Merman

Deep in the vast East Sea, a massive magic vessel soared through the sky, its silhouette flickering among the white clouds.

For this retreat operation, the Black Lotus Sect had divided into over thirty teams led by Golden Core Protectors, breaking through the three northern seas of the East Sea to withdraw to the distant Lu Kingdom via the Yan Kingdom. Their allies, the Hundred Ghosts Sect and the Blood River Hall, had their own separate arrangements.

The Black Lotus Sect's Discipline Dharma King and the Nascent Soul cultivators from the other two sects remained at the East Sea headquarters with the remaining cannon fodder, buying time for the elite seeds to escape.

The most perilous part of this journey was breaking through the northern seas of the East Sea, where the righteous alliance was rumored to have set up an ambush waiting for the demonic cultivators to walk into their trap. However, once they reached the waters of the Yan Kingdom, they would be relatively safe.

Yan Yuanchun's team was tasked with breaking through the Tempest Sea, a region shrouded in violent storms for half the year. During these times, towering waves and torrential rains would obscure vision and spiritual senses with dense mist. While the natural disasters made the journey treacherous, the poor visibility also provided cover for their escape.

Standing at the bow of the magic vessel, Yan Yuanchun gazed into the distance, lost in thought. Behind her, Lin Shan and Luan Chun sat restlessly, unable to meditate as they worried about the dangers ahead, engaging in idle chatter.

"Five days have passed. I wonder how things are at the temporary headquarters in the East Sea."

"Dharma King Discipline will buy us time."

"Ever since the battle at the Purple Mist Sect's mountain gate, Master has often stood alone like this, gazing into the distance. It's a pity Sisters Yu Chun and Huan Chun aren't here..."

"May they rest in peace..."

The hundred or so low-level cultivators aboard were also distracted and despondent, their futures uncertain. Most were natives of the Song Kingdom or the East Sea, and now they were leaving their homeland to travel over a dozen kingdoms to the distant Lu Kingdom. The journey would be fraught with peril, and their hearts were heavy with reluctance and fear.

But having boarded the demonic path's ship, staying behind would likely mean facing the righteous faction's retribution. The righteous cultivators wouldn't care whether they had been coerced—they might simply slaughter them on sight as demonic scum.

According to the intelligence before their departure, the righteous alliance had already infiltrated the northern seas, anticipating the demonic faction's retreat. Some ambush points had been waiting for days. It was unknown which of the Black Lotus Sect's many teams would fall into their traps.

---

For the past two days, the Tempest Sea had been calm and clear. Sea beasts and birds frolicked freely on the waters and islands below, unthreatened by humans. The tension among the group gradually eased.

Yet Lin Shan couldn't shake a growing unease. The tranquility felt illusory, as if they were being watched and followed.

Two hours later, a group appeared ahead, seemingly having detected them long ago and deliberately intercepting them in the vast sea.

A massive white line stretched across the horizon. As they drew closer, they realized it wasn't the righteous cultivators they had expected but an indigenous tribe of the Tempest Sea—the Mermen.

As one of the dominant forces in the Tempest Sea, the Mermen had countless sea beasts and birds acting as their eyes and ears. The demonic cultivators had been spotted the moment they entered the region.

The Mermen were a sight to behold—slender figures with veiled faces, adorned with gold and silver headpieces, their lower bodies ending in shimmering, multicolored fish tails. They rode atop whales, surging toward the magic vessel.

The commotion on the sea naturally alarmed everyone aboard. They gathered at the bow, watching the approaching Mermen with tense apprehension.

Leading the group was a male Merman elder, exuding the aura of a Golden Core cultivator. Behind him were five Foundation Establishment Mermen—one male and four females. Among them, Lin Shan vaguely recognized a late-Foundation Establishment Merman maiden from his previous encounter in the Tempest Sea when ambushing the Water Bear tribe.

Yan Yuanchun stepped out of the magic vessel, advancing to meet the Merman elder. Noticing that the enemy's numbers vastly outnumbered their own, a flicker of concern passed through her eyes.

"Fellow Daoist of the Merman tribe, why do you block our path? We merely pass through the Tempest Sea with no ill intent. Please grant us passage!"

Her cold voice, amplified by magic, echoed across the sea for miles. The Merman elder responded with a mocking laugh, pointing at her accusingly.

"Noble demonic fairy, how quickly you forget! When your kind oppressed us with arrogance, where was this courtesy? Why the sudden change in attitude?"

Yan Yuanchun frowned, perplexed.

"What oppression? What arrogance? This is my first time in the Tempest Sea. When did we ever wrong you?"

The Merman elder threw his head back with a bitter laugh before glaring at the ship with venomous hatred.

"Ten years ago, a late-Golden Core Protector from your demonic faction came to our Merman tribe in the Tempest Sea! He killed one of our elders and abducted ten of our Foundation Establishment maidens as cultivation cauldrons! Have you forgotten all this?"

Yan Yuanchun was taken aback. She had been fighting in the Song Kingdom's interior a decade ago and knew nothing of events in this remote corner of the East Sea. She turned to the others aboard, but they too were clueless. Even Lin Shan wondered—which Golden Core Protector had nothing better to do than bully a backwater Merman tribe?

Truly, the sins of the predecessors were visited upon the descendants.

Though they inwardly cursed the perpetrator, they couldn't help but feel a twinge of envy. Was this the privilege of late-Golden Core power—to abduct ten Foundation Establishment maidens with impunity, while the Merman tribe could only swallow their humiliation?

Hearing the Mermen's grievances and seeing the genuine hatred in their eyes, Yan Yuanchun coughed awkwardly.

"I was unaware of this matter. It's deplorable that such a black sheep existed among the demonic path, bringing such injustice upon your tribe. But vengeance has its proper target—this was the act of one individual. Fellow Daoist, why punish us all? Not all of the demonic path are villains—we cannot be judged as one!"

Her words were reasonable, and the others nodded along, putting on their best "we're the good guys" expressions.

But the Merman elder wasn't fooled. After hearing her explanation, he laughed scornfully and turned to his people.

"Did you hear that? She says there are good people among the demonic path! As if we're children! Tell me, is there a single decent person among them?"

"NO!"

"Not a single one!"

"All scum!"

"My wife was taken by them!"

The chorus of curses from the Mermen left the demonic cultivators shifting uncomfortably. True, the demonic path had few virtuous members, but most of them had been rogue cultivators before this! If not for Yan Yuanchun rejoining the Black Lotus Sect, they would still be running their humble brothel business in Yi River. As for the East Sea rogue cultivators, hadn't they been free before being forcibly conscripted?

But there was no explaining this to the Mermen. They wouldn't believe claims of coercion now—the seeds of hatred had already taken root.

With a command from the elder, schools of flying fish leaped from the sea, carrying the Mermen into the air.

Weapons in hand, the Mermen charged forth, determined to settle the score.

Yan Yuanchun swiftly intercepted the Golden Core Merman elder to prevent him from slaughtering the weaker cultivators. The elder met her head-on, summoning his magic treasure to engage her in battle.

As the only two Foundation Establishment cultivators present, Lin Shan and Luan Chun had no choice but to leave the vessel and confront the five Merman Foundation Establishment experts. If the magic vessel were destroyed, the hundred Qi Condensation cultivators aboard—unable to fly—would be stranded and doomed. Falling into the sea would mean certain death, as the Mermen's sea beasts would devour them.

Meanwhile, the flying fish carrying hundreds of Mermen bypassed the Golden Core and Foundation Establishment battles, swarming the vessel. Merman warriors boarded the ship, engaging the demonic cultivators in close combat.

"Why isn't the ship's defensive formation active? How are they getting aboard?"

"How should I know? Only Protector Yan can control the formation!"

The panicked cultivators fought desperately while stealing glances at the sky, where two massive spiritual vortices clashed—Yan Yuanchun and the Merman elder were locked in battle, unable to spare attention for the underlings.

Lin Shan and Luan Chun ignored the chaos on the vessel, as the five Foundation Establishment Mermen had already locked onto them. The late-Foundation Establishment Merman maiden recognized Lin Shan instantly.

"It's you! The shameless one who ambushed our Water Bear vassals! If not for you, we wouldn't have drawn the demonic path's attention and suffered this calamity!"

Her words drew venomous glares from the other Mermen, who clearly trusted her account. Under Luan Chun's questioning look, Lin Shan couldn't help but doubt himself.

All I did was sign a summoning contract with the Water Bear chieftain. How did that lead to the Mermen's downfall? What kind of butterfly effect is this?

Little did he know, after their last encounter, the Merman maiden had reported to her grandfather—the Merman elder—about human cultivators trespassing in their territory and bullying their vassals, demanding justice.

Isolated from the outside world, this branch of Mermen had no idea the East Sea had fallen under demonic rule. In their ignorance, they sent an envoy to the demonic headquarters to protest.

The demonic faction, mistaking them for diplomatic envoys, forwarded their complaint up the chain of command. When it reached the nine Nascent Soul elders overseeing the war effort, they flew into a rage and dispatched a late-Golden Core Protector to suppress the Mermen.

The outcome was predictable.

Humiliated, the Mermen were forced to submit but began gathering intelligence on the outside world. They bided their time until, just a decade later, the demonic faction collapsed under the righteous alliance's assault.

Seizing the opportunity, the Merman elder turned the tables, hunting down fleeing demonic cultivators for revenge.

And Yan Yuanchun's team had walked right into their path.

Facing five Foundation Establishment Mermen, Lin Shan remained calm. Having advanced to mid-Foundation Establishment, he was far stronger than when he had subdued the Water Bear chieftain.

He didn't even summon Blackbone Demon Lord, instead instructing Luan Chun to take on two opponents while he handled three. With an air of arrogance, he pointed at his chosen foes.

"You, you, and you—come at me together!"

But the Mermen ignored his theatrics, their hatred focused solely on him as the root of their suffering. With bloodshot eyes, they each produced high-grade magic weapons—as a dominant tribe, they were well-equipped with multiple artifacts each.

Blades, spears, swords, axes—a barrage of high-grade magic weapons shot toward Lin Shan under spiritual control, completely ignoring Luan Chun.

"Uh-oh..."

Facing over a dozen high-grade magic weapons, Lin Shan's soul nearly fled his body! No one could withstand such an assault—even his Cloud-Copper Heart Mirror would be shredded.

The skull pendant at his waist let out a shriek and fled back to the magic vessel. Luan Chun covered her eyes with a gasp, unable to bear watching Lin Shan's gruesome demise.

I'd help, but a dozen high-grade magic weapons? No way!

The five Mermen watched with savage glee as the weapons closed in from all sides, sealing Lin Shan's fate.

"Whoosh—"

A sudden breeze swept past, and Lin Shan vanished.

"Clang! Clang! Clang!"

The weapons collided mid-air, their metallic clangs ringing out.

"Where is he?"

The Mermen looked around frantically, unable to comprehend his disappearance.

Luan Chun kept her hands over her face, mourning Lin Shan's tragic end. Such talent, cut down by five enemies at once—what a waste.

But then—

A figure materialized amidst the Mermen, right beside the sole male. In his left hand was a fading green talisman, while his right held a shimmering blue sword that swept down in an arc.

The male Merman barely had time to raise a shell-shaped defensive artifact before the blade cleaved through it—and him—like paper.

"Clang!"

The crisp sword hum faded, leaving only blood spraying through the air.

As the bisected corpse plummeted into the sea, Lin Shan calmly pocketed the conch-shaped storage artifact, his expression serene as if he'd merely swatted a fly.

The remaining four Mermen gaped in disbelief. Their comrade had been a late-Foundation Establishment expert with considerable physical cultivation and a high-grade defensive artifact—yet he'd been slain in one strike!

Could it be... that sword...

"A magic treasure?!"
