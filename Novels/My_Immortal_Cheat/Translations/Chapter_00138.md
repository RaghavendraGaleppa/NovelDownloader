Chapter 138: Counter-Kill

The two stepped into the arena. This arena was more like a formation, carved into the stone bricks, its interior space extending infinitely.

The Heaven's Chosen Ones all cast their gazes inside. The two individuals within were no weaker than them, in fact, stronger than most of them, so they had no right to be arrogant.

She Yin pointed at the alms bowl above his head. Immediately, a gigantic head emerged from it, startlingly sudden and terrifying. As it emerged, the head instantly magnified, becoming like a towering mountain, filling the void. Its scales were chillingly sharp, its face ferocious, and a single horn grew from its head.

Everyone was astonished that such a large head could emerge from a small alms bowl and grow to such an immense size.

"A Crimson Flood Dragon!"

Many, after careful identification, gasped in shock. Was this a Flood Dragon? Its entire body was blood-red, its scales seemed forged from metal, its physique robust and boundless, almost indistinguishable from a true dragon.

The crowd drew a collective cold breath, recalling a legend: She Yin had once subdued a Saint Realm demonic beast with a single Buddhist chant. This was likely that very creature. The rules of the competition did not forbid the use of such a demonic beast, especially since it was personally subdued by She Yin.

"Is that it? It's said to be an ancestral Crimson Flood Dragon, its bloodline already quite pure, and its power terrifying."

"Roar!"

The Crimson Flood Dragon burst out of the alms bowl, letting out a thunderous roar that shook the void. Carried by a fierce wind, it dove towards Zhou Xunchuan. Its colossal body astonished many; it was longer and more terrifying than a mountain range, causing the entire area to rumble and the void to rip apart. The contrast in this scene was too great; such an enormous body had been coiled within a tiny alms bowl.

Boom!

Sand flew, stones rolled, mud splattered, and the void tore open. Nothing could be seen in that area as a crimson hurricane, swirling like a vortex, swept through, devouring everything. Even multi-ton boulders were instantly reduced to dust upon entering. This was the power of the demonic flood dragon; with a single strike, it intended to suppress Zhou Xunchuan.

"Good timing!" Zhou Xunchuan laughed loudly. Facing this ancestral demonic flood dragon, which was a realm higher than him, he did not dodge or evade. Golden light burst forth from his entire body as he directly unleashed a punch. When his fist strike was launched, his fist erupted with boundless light, like a golden great sun exploding, its blazing divine radiance unparalleled.

Dong!

At this moment, heaven and earth overturned, and chaotic qi emerged. Accompanied by Zhou Xunchuan's punch, the entire arena space seemed to be overthrown and shattered, emanating a terrifying aura. Then, they saw Zhou Xunchuan's figure, like a god of war, bathed in golden divine flames, charging towards the Crimson Flood Dragon with immense power, his movements grand and sweeping.

Before his fist, it seemed as if countless great stars were revolving, and a golden divine dragon coiled around him, pulsating with his movements. His long hair cascaded down, his eyes were cold, and he possessed an aura that could swallow mountains and rivers.

Bang!

With a single punch, the void shattered as he collided with the Crimson Flood Dragon. However, something surprising happened: despite the disproportionate size between Zhou Xunchuan and the Crimson Flood Dragon, the flood dragon was sent flying backward, several of its crimson scales shattered. The body of a demonic beast was inherently stronger than that of a human, not to mention a Crimson Flood Dragon with true dragon bloodline, whose physical strength was even more astonishing. Furthermore, it was a realm higher than Zhou Xunchuan, yet it was defeated.

She Yin's expression remained unchanged. He sat cross-legged in the void, chanting profound scriptures. The scriptures transformed into symbols, each like a mountain forged from divine gold, leaping out from the void and pressing down towards Zhou Xunchuan. At the same time, the Crimson Flood Dragon flew forward again, tangling in battle with Zhou Xunchuan. Divine light flared and chaotic energy surged in the area.

"Eight Steps of the Celestial Dragon!" Zhou Xunchuan roared, his body glowing. He took strange steps in the void, transforming as if into a golden divine dragon. From afar, it looked as if two true dragons were battling, one crimson and one golden.

Sweat dripped from Zhou Xunchuan's forehead. He had already taken seven steps. This was a powerful divine ability, and each step required an immense amount of vital energy.

"The eighth step: Disrupting the Eight Directions!" Zhou Xunchuan's hair was disheveled, and he looked like a berserker, his vital energy surging like collapsing clouds as he took the final step.

The golden divine dragon seemed to have been injected with true dragon blood, its body glowing as it violently coiled around the Crimson Flood Dragon. The Crimson Flood Dragon let out a wail and was torn apart alive. A rain of blood fell from the sky, and its two halves of its body crashed to the ground, kicking up large clouds of dust.

Some were too stunned to speak. Why could someone else's Dharma Idol Realm counter-kill a Saint Realm demonic beast, while their own Dharma Idol was so pathetic? The true Heaven's Chosen Ones also had flickering gazes, their hearts not so calm. Yet, it didn't utterly shock them; a wild demonic flood dragon had no true dragon inheritance and could only rely on its physical strength. They, too, could achieve this, albeit at a cost.

"Om, Ma, Ni..." Just at this moment, a magnificent scripture chant resonated, as if capable of suppressing everything. Its mere appearance disturbed some balance in the universe.

The sound of the scriptures quickly brought everyone back to their senses. They turned their heads to look at She Yin, who was still seated cross-legged in the void, chanting profound scriptures.

The Luo Tian Temple inherited its traditions from the Ancient Buddhist Realm. Those who called themselves Buddhas could rely on scriptures, simply by chanting, to transcend their opponents and suppress all enemies. This was their most enigmatic and powerful trait. The Buddhist chant that had originally subdued the Flood Dragon was, in fact, a powerful scripture.

The chanting continued ceaselessly, transforming in the void into massive, mountain-like symbols that glimmered with cold metallic light, all flying towards Zhou Xunchuan to suppress him. At this critical moment, Zhou Xunchuan stumbled, his stance unsteady. She Yin had chosen his timing perfectly, acting instantly without a trace of hesitation. This was mainly because Zhou Xunchuan had just used an extremely powerful divine ability, consuming an enormous amount of his essence, qi, and spirit. Thus, he was temporarily a bit weakened.

Boom!

Terrifying divine flames erupted, and Zhou Xunchuan's figure blazed once more. He stabilized himself, a divine dragon coiling around him, as he swallowed vast amounts of vital energy. Heaven and earth shattered, ghosts and gods howled. Zhou Xunchuan continuously unleashed heavy blows, his true-dragon-infused fists striking repeatedly.

A colossal fist-seal struck towards She Yin, only to be blocked by the alms bowl. However, the ancient artifact vibrated violently before directly exploding, utterly destroyed! Although it was only a brief clash, an instantaneous exchange, not a prolonged peak duel, it offered a glimpse of their immense power.

At this, She Yin sighed. His skin was as smooth and radiant as jade. He pressed his palms together, lightly recited a Buddhist chant, his expression complex. On the ground, the alms bowl lay shattered into dozens of pieces, directly pulverized by Zhou Xunchuan's colossal fist-seal. This was an ancient treasure, yet it was destroyed just like that.

She Yin ceased chanting and rose from the void. His body stretched and glowed with golden light, as if cast from gold. This was the Luo Tian Temple's secret divine ability, the Golden Body of Manifestation—a powerful body-tempering method that only those with the highest innate potential could successfully cultivate.

Vital energy surged like collapsing clouds, and power fluctuated like an abyssal sea, shattering the very space. Two golden figures collided, and though both were merely physical bodies, their impacts produced sounds of clashing metal, tearing the void apart.
