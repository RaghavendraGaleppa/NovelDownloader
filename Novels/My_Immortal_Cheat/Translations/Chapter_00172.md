# Chapter 172: Anomaly

The moment Zhou Tian stepped through the portal, he lost consciousness. When he awoke again, he was in an unfamiliar world.

The sky was a deep blue, with white clouds gently drifting. A slight itching sensation came from Zhou Tian's palm. Beneath him was tender green grass, and in the distance were verdant mountains and clear waters.

Most striking was a colossal Buddha sitting cross-legged at the edge of the world, its head reaching into the clouds. Its hands were clasped in prayer, its face serene and benevolent. Numerous dharma seats floated around its body, with Bodhisattvas and Arhats seated upon them. In front of its body, a shimmering golden light emanated, seemingly accompanied by chants, as Buddhist disciples listened to its teachings. This place was practically a Buddhist Pure Land.

“Hmm? Where’s Saint Devil? It seems we’ve been separated.” Zhou Tian stood up from the ground, realizing Saint Devil was no longer near him, and murmured.

“It looks like the tomb of a Celestial Venerable Buddha.” Gazing at the gigantic Buddha, an unknown distance away, Zhou Tian muttered to himself, stating the obvious.

The size of this realm was unknown. Besides the immense Buddha anomaly, there was also a colossal golden lotus, large enough to obscure the sky, swaying gently. Perhaps because this lotus was relatively close to him, each sway of the golden lotus brought a peculiar fragrance that alleviated his fatigue. To the north, there was a place radiating Daoist light, half the sky dyed by its brilliance. There, streams of light cascaded, intricate symbols proliferated, celestial dragons roared, and myriad spirit phantoms manifested.

“Saint Devil wanted Wu Tian’s sarira, right? Who knows where that thing is?” Zhou Tian scratched his head, feeling a bit lost. He was in an unfamiliar place, and now they were separated. He didn't know where to go next.

“Forget it, I’ll just go to that giant lotus. Such a huge anomaly must be a good thing.” After thinking for a while, Zhou Tian couldn't come up with a better plan. Since the lotus was closest, he might as well go and see if there was an opportunity to profit.

But before he could take a step, a tremor echoed from the sky. An inexplicable chilling wind began to blow through the heavens and earth, imparting an unspeakable dread to the once sacred realm!

Zhou Tian frowned, looking up at the sky, wondering what was happening.

“Wooo…” Like a ghostly wail, piercing howls emanated from the chilling wind. Subsequently, an eerie grey wind swept through the world. The aura remained incredibly cold, and the entire world turned a monochromatic grey.

“What in the world is happening?” Zhou Tian’s frown deepened as he watched the sudden anomaly before him.

“Rumble, rumble!” At that moment, yellow clouds enveloped the sky, from which streaks of black lightning struck down, making the place even more sinister and eerie. Finally, a torrential downpour began, and shockingly, the rain was yellow!

A curtain of water covered the world. The heavy yellow rain appeared utterly sinister, like blood. “Isn’t this the tomb of a Celestial Venerable Buddha? How could such a sacred Buddha…” Before he could finish speaking, Zhou Tian froze, his pupils contracting. He saw that the supremely sacred Buddha, which had originally stood tall between heaven and earth, had completely changed. Its golden body had turned entirely jet black, its face hideous, and even black blood was dripping from the corners of its mouth, with half a torso hanging from its teeth. The Arhats and Bodhisattvas that had floated around its body had also transformed into Yakshas and Rakshasas, their demonic flames surging.

In front of the demonic Buddha’s phantom, as black mist churned, an ancient city emerged. This city within the mist was incredibly grand, exuding an immense aura. Its walls stood thousands of feet high, filled with the vicissitudes of time. It was as if these ancient walls had endured countless ages, appearing to transcend time from primordial antiquity. The colossal city gate, a hundred zhang high, stood wide open, facing outwards. Even with the pervasive black mist, it couldn't completely conceal the scene within the gate. Inside the city, squads of soldiers, like deathly Rakshasas, drilled in perfect formation, their ancient armor dilapidated. The Buddhist Pure Land had become a City of Shadows!

“This is Wu Tian’s tomb.” A sudden realization dawned on Zhou Tian. “Wu Tian wasn’t merely a Half-step Celestial Venerable at all; he was a Celestial Venerable.” Although he didn't know how Wu Tian had achieved Celestial Venerable status, when recorded as only a Half-step Celestial Venerable, there must be many hidden secrets involved.

The sky grew even darker. The sickly yellow clouds had completely transformed into ink-black clouds, making it darker than midnight. Thick black mist coiled like ghostly miasma, and the color of the lightning astonishingly turned a ghastly blood-red. That ghastly red was exceptionally blinding. Within the swirling demonic clouds, terrifying crimson lights tore through continuously, as if roaring rivers of blood cascaded from the heavens to the ground, painting this dark world in a horrifying, grim light. In the dark sky, dazzling and piercing lightning danced wildly. In the flashes, one could clearly see the overwhelming downpour of raindrops. The smell of blood assailed the nostrils; a curtain of blood hung over the world, and the rain had become blood!

The black mist was dispersed, revealing more of the ancient city's features. “That’s… a sword!” Zhou Tian exclaimed, for there was a colossal stone sword plunged fiercely into the ancient city wall. It already bore many cracks, but it had not yet disintegrated. The ancient city, with walls thousands of feet high, not only exuded an aura of ancient vicissitude but also appeared incredibly grim after being bathed in blood rain. It was like a monstrous beast that had torn through space from primordial antiquity, its ominous aura chilling to the bone. Coupled with the colossal stone sword embedded in the city gate tower, it became even more astonishing. It looked as if someone had brutally smashed it into place. Large cracks appeared on the ancient city wall around the stone sword, and the wall above the main gate had suffered severe damage.

The blood rain splattered on the demonic Buddha's body, its jet black and crimson hues intertwining, making it appear even more terrifying. This realm had completely transformed, from a sacred place into an evil domain.

“Hmm?” Zhou Tian felt an anomaly beneath his feet, as if something was trying to push its way out. He looked down to see that the originally tender green grass had turned blood-red, expanding and growing, absorbing nutrients from the blood rain.

Pffft! Zhou Tian felt a sharp pain in his chest. A blood-red withered branch pierced through his heart, draining all the blood from his body. He forced himself to turn his head and saw a strange, half-human-tall plant behind him, resembling a small tree, its blood-red branches swaying. Near it, a large clear area had formed, as all other blood-red grass had withered. It was actually plundering its companions' nutrients to grow, which was why it had grown so quickly.

“Holy crap, I actually got ambushed by a blade of grass…” His body grew cold, all his blood absorbed. Soon, Zhou Tian lost consciousness.

Then, in an instant, Zhou Tian's body reappeared, identical to how it was before he was injured.

Whoosh! The blood-red withered branch struck again, but when it hit Zhou Tian, it felt as soft and powerless as cotton.
