# Chapter 75: Jiang She's Dilemma

"Even with the [Deep Pit] skill, once the sect's Pulse-Nourishing Flowers enter their rapid growth phase, I'll barely have any cultivation time left. I might even have to pull all-nighters," Ding Rui said, then gave a self-deprecating laugh. "Other cultivators probably don't even have time to rest. Take Senior Brother Shuimen, for example; he's already quite old, and with his planting talent, he must have accumulated many resources over the years. This should be the time for him to focus on cultivation and breakthroughs, but with this incident, he has to devote all his energy and time to these Pulse-Nourishing Flowers, a task he has no experience with, and who knows how long it will last. How many cultivators like him are there across the entire sect domain? Compared to them, I'm doing well. It's all for the sect domain, and for ourselves too." Ding Rui understood all of this very clearly.

"I still have two skill slots left. However, if I need to comprehend new skills, when these Pulse-Nourishing Flowers reach their flowering period, I can just use [Cordyceps Kill] to absorb their spiritual energy. After all, the trickiest part of handling flowering Pulse-Nourishing Flowers is constantly monitoring the speed at which the 'Azurewood Art' absorbs spiritual energy and the state of the flowers. When I cast [Cordyceps Kill] using a skill slot, the speed of true essence absorption is completely fixed. I just need to keep an eye on the flowers' condition and stop absorbing at the right time," he mused about his future plans. "And I should have enough time. The gap between the rapid growth phase and the flowering phase isn't short. When using the [Deep Pit] skill, I don't need to worry about the flowering phase, and by the time the flowering phase arrives, the rapid growth phase will have long passed."

"If possible, I could even cast [Deep Pit] with both hands simultaneously. This 'Double Deep Pit' would require some practice, but once mastered, it would double my soil loosening speed!"

"Thinking about it, if I go all out, I might even be able to take care of more Pulse-Nourishing Flowers!"

"That's impressive!"

Since he had already proven he could manage the rapid growth phase of the Pulse-Nourishing Flowers, his next task was to demonstrate his ability to handle their flowering phase. In the cultivation of Pulse-Nourishing Flowers, the flowering period was undoubtedly more crucial. Only by ensuring a successful flowering period could sufficient Pulse-Nourishing Flower pollen be obtained, which was then used in the refining of Pulse-Nourishing Pills. However, Ding Rui was not worried at all. He had even begun spending time comprehending the [Double Deep Pit] skill.

Half a month quickly passed, and the Pulse-Nourishing Flowers planted by the sect reached their rapid growth phase. Ding Rui became even busier, waking early and sleeping late every day, dedicating almost all his time to the spiritual fields. It was worth mentioning that during this period, while caring for the sect's Pulse-Nourishing Flowers, he had completely fused the [Loosen Soil] skill with the [Cordyceps Kill] skill, naming it [Golden Wood Earth]. This freed up another skill slot. Originally, after comprehending [Deep Pit], he had two skill slots remaining. Now, with [Golden Wood Earth], three skill slots were open, allowing him to comprehend three new skills.

However, the entire sect domain was operating at full capacity. While spiritual field cultivators were busy planting Pulse-Nourishing Flowers, the number of cultivators responsible for spiritual rice cultivation had been reduced to its absolute limit; no more could be spared. The Pill Hall disciples, meanwhile, had to constantly refine Pulse-Nourishing Pills. The effects of these pills were temporary, requiring continuous replenishment. Without a steady supply of Pulse-Nourishing Pills, the sect domain's situation would have likely deteriorated much faster. The Artifact Hall disciples also needed to continuously provide spiritual artifacts to the Battle Hall disciples. In intense combat, spiritual artifacts were easily damaged, and both repair and replacement fell to the Artifact Hall disciples. As for the Battle Hall disciples, it went without saying they were all at the front lines, even more shorthanded than the spiritual field cultivators, yet no other cultivators could be reassigned to them. At this time, the Miscellaneous Hall disciples were also responsible for the operation of more than half of the sect domain.

There simply weren't enough people!

"The Miscellaneous Hall disciples might be able to squeeze out one or two more, but it's still not enough!"

"Are we just going to watch these Pulse-Nourishing Flowers fail to grow effectively, thus affecting the pollen yield?" Jiang She paced anxiously in his alchemy room. He was a core cultivator among the Pill Hall's inner disciples and was also responsible for managing many affairs.
