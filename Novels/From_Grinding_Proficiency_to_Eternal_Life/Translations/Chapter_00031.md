# Chapter 31: Pure Yang One Qi Art

The old Taoist heard the words, pondered for a moment, then nodded and pulled out a roll of silk brocade from his sleeve.

With a gentle flick of his wrist, the brocade floated through the air like a light feather, covering a distance of over ten meters before landing steadily in front of Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously reached out and caught it. Opening it, he saw the words "Pure Yang One Qi Art" written boldly on it.

He raised an eyebrow and was about to say something when Li Haomiao quickly shouted with all his might, "This one is better!"

Xu Yunfan closed his mouth, a smile appearing on his face. Even the ugly old Taoist looked a bit more pleasing to the eye.

The old Taoist then glanced at Fang Mushan beside Xu Yunfan, his expression shifting slightly. He said, "I am Bi Sheng of the Dao Sect. Young man, are you willing to follow me?"

Fang Mushan, standing to the side, was stunned. He pointed at himself in confusion. "Daoist Master, are you referring to me?"

Bi Sheng nodded slightly, a gentle smile appearing on his face. "You have excellent aptitude, born with divine strength and blood energy like a flood. You are truly gifted. Are you willing to join the Dao Sect?"

Fang Mushan had naturally heard of the Dao Sect's immense prestige and was overjoyed. He agreed without hesitation.

He took a step, then paused, turning to cup his fist toward Xu Yunfan with a hint of apology. "Brother Xu, thank you for your care along the way. If we have the chance, let us meet again in the future."

Xu Yunfan smiled and replied, "A light boat has passed ten thousand mountains. Go straight ahead, Brother Fang."

As Fang Mushan walked to Li Haomiao's side, Bi Sheng didn't even glance at Xu Yunfan. He reached out with two hands as wide as palm-leaf fans, grabbed one in each hand, and vanished without a trace in an instant.

They're gone!

Xu Yunfan gazed for a long time before slowly retracting his gaze. He composed himself and looked at the Pure Yang One Qi Art in his hand, pondering silently.

"Blind to true value. I have a cheat system... Is my aptitude really that bad?"

Xu Yunfan was about to turn and descend Mount Jiyun when his footsteps suddenly halted. His gaze shifted toward Li Miaoyun, who was almost completely fused with the snow and ice.

After Li Haomiao used his true force to seal her Qi, she was no different from an ordinary weak woman. In the environment of minus ten or twenty degrees at the mountain peak, she would freeze to death quickly without external intervention.

"This person is of great use..."

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but look up at the sky.

"If she's of great use, why don't *you* take her away!"

This left Xu Yunfan in a dilemma. He pondered for a moment, then decided to pretend he saw nothing and turned to leave quickly. Once he descended Mount Jiyun, the world was vast, and he could go anywhere. There was no need to bother with Li Miaoyun.

Li Miaoyun struggled to lift her head, looking at Xu Yunfan who was quickly disappearing from her sight, her expression somewhat dazed.

Since becoming the圣女 (Holy Maiden) of the Tian Shu Gate, she had been treated like a star held in the palm of her hand wherever she went. Everyone treated her with respect, and even the Empress treated her with great gentleness.

Now, she was being treated like garbage, too much of a bother to even look at.

She quickly composed herself, struggled to prop herself up, and slowly began to walk down the mountain.

The soles of her feet, which had never felt anything before, now transmitted a stinging cold, making her falter. The piercing cold around her made her shiver uncontrollably.

She took a moment to regulate her breathing, leaving one footprint at a time, moving forward slowly.

She didn't know how much time had passed when she suddenly felt her body grow warm, even feeling a wave of heat.

She stopped to rest, looking up at the sky as the heavy snow began to drift again.

She reached out, caught a snowflake, and looked at it quietly.

"Master, I have disappointed you. I failed to bring Li Haomiao back."

Li Miaoyun murmured to herself, muttering something inaudible. As time passed, her body was gradually covered by the snow until she was completely buried, her original form no longer visible.

"So pitiful!"

From behind a large boulder not far away, Xu Yunfan casually tossed the stone in his hand aside, his face full of emotion. If she hadn't died, he would have had to throw a couple more stones. Now, it was perfect.

It was his first time seeing someone die in such a way. Especially Li Miaoyun, who was extremely beautiful. With her Qi sealed, she was truly pitiable and lovely.

Good death, wonderful death!

Xu Yunfan suppressed his excitement. He still remembered clearly how Li Miaoyun had said she wanted to kill Fang Mushan and him.

Hearing those words made him uncomfortable. If he had just run away, he might have truly been unable to eat or sleep in peace, having to sleep with one eye open.

That was why he made up his mind to bring Fang Mushan back. It turned out his choice was correct.

Li Haomiao was a good person. As long as it was within his power, Xu Yunfan would naturally help.

As for getting close to kill Li Miaoyun, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't take the risk easily. This woman was too strange; who knew what kind of mutual destruction tricks she had.

He just had to wait patiently for her to die.

Xu Yunfan waited silently in place for an hour. The surroundings were dead silent, with only the occasional sound of the cold wind whispering in his ear.

Until the eastern sky turned pale and the sun slowly poked its head out.

In an instant, a golden light, like a sharp sword, slashed through the sky and poured down, enveloping the entire Mount Jiyun.

The originally dark Mount Jiyun was now镀ed (plated) with a golden edge, shining brilliantly. Every inch of land and every stone was bathed in the warm sunlight, turning golden.

Xu Yunfan slowly stood up, stretched his waist, and glanced at the spot where Li Miaoyun was buried in the distance. Confirming there was nothing unusual, he turned and left quickly.

Soon, the heavy snow covered and erased the traces of his departure.

As he left, the snow pile covering Li Miaoyun seemed to turn into eternity. The snow on the peak of Mount Jiyun never melts throughout the year. Without any accident, Li Miaoyun would sleep here forever.

On the other side of Mount Jiyun, the mountains stretched out continuously, like a sleeping giant dragon winding along the earth, or like surging waves of white and green interwoven, blending with the horizon.

Lush trees covered in snow were scattered among them. White, emerald green, and withered yellow interwoven, slowly constructing a picturesque beauty.

This was a completely different world from the eight hundred miles of barren ice plains behind Xu Yunfan.

"Truly a good environment."

In his previous life, such a scene was rare.

As the saying goes, going up the mountain is easy, but coming down is hard.

However, with the light body technique of "Flying Legs," Xu Yunfan descended very quickly. It took him only half a day to reach the foot of the mountain.

Along the way, Xu Yunfan kept practicing Flying Legs, and his proficiency rose rapidly.

*You exerted your legs, seemingly understanding the essence of Flying Legs, and your proficiency increased.*

*When you sprinted at full speed, the key points of Flying Legs flashed through your mind. In an instant, you broke through the speed bottleneck, and your proficiency increased significantly.*

*...*

Until he reached the foot of the mountain, Xu Yunfan glanced at the proficiency of Flying Legs in his vision.

779 points.

He looked back at Mount Jiyun, his heart stirring.

Perhaps if he ran back and forth a few more times, Flying Legs would enter the Great Completion stage.

Flying Legs is a muscle-refining martial art. Once it reaches Great Completion, it will also help his muscle-refining reach Great Completion.

(Asking for advice, actually, there is more plot for Li Miaoyun later, but I'm afraid you all will find it tedious. I wonder what the esteemed readers think?)
