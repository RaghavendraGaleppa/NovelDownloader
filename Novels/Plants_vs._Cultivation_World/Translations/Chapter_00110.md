# Chapter 110: Counter-Kill

The resource point contained second-grade spirit fields. As a true disciple, Gu Mo would become the highest-ranking figure stationed there, giving him full authority over those fields.

Moreover, being far from the sect, Gu Mo could boldly plant various vegetation without restraint. The other sect disciples stationed there likely wouldn't dare question the actions of a true disciple.

In truth, this assignment to the resource point wasn't a bad outcome for Gu Mo.

Of course, benefits came with risks—he would lose the sect's protection and face potential ambushes orchestrated by He Shaogang.

Gu Mo could roughly predict the ambush location. There was an unavoidable choke point along the route to the resource point. Any detour would lead into demon beast territory, which was far more dangerous.

As he approached the inevitable mountain pass, Gu Mo halted and cautiously extended his spiritual sense.

**Inside the Mountain Pass**

Three figures sat cross-legged, their auras concealed. They had remained motionless for an entire week.

"Senior Brother, it's been a week. Could the target have taken a detour?" one of the rear figures transmitted via spiritual voice.

"This is the only viable path. He won't detour," the leader replied impassively. They had received strict orders to eliminate the target.

The sect had deployed him—a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator—along with two early-stage Foundation Establishment juniors. Such a lineup to kill a mere Qi Condensation cultivator was overkill. Even if the target possessed unusual strength, how could a Qi Condensation cultivator possibly rival Foundation Establishment experts?

Even if the target somehow possessed combat power comparable to Foundation Establishment, facing three of them simultaneously would still mean certain death.

Their only concern was ensuring the target didn't detect them prematurely and flee. That was the sole factor that could jeopardize their mission.

Thus, the three sat silently, retracting their spiritual senses and auras. Intelligence suggested the target had developed spiritual sense, so any probing might alert him.

"Hmm? What's that?"

The third cultivator suddenly noticed a vibrant cherry rolling toward them from nowhere, his expression puzzled.

"Probably dropped by some nearby pseudo-spirit beast," the mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator said. He released his spiritual sense to investigate—while concealing it prevented detection, it also blinded them to their surroundings.

**The Trap Springs**

The moment the mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator extended his spiritual sense, he detected a figure rapidly retreating into the distance. Shock flashed across his face—someone had approached undetected!

"Stop him!"

Regardless of the stranger's intentions, their orders were clear: eliminate anyone approaching this area to prevent any mishaps.

But before the command fully left his lips, a blinding white light erupted from the innocuous-looking cherry.

**BOOM!**

Hearing the explosion behind him, Gu Mo couldn't suppress a smirk. Upon nearing the pass, he had carefully scouted the area and noticed anomalies in the valley. Rather than risk detection with spiritual probing, he employed his perfected concealment technique to infiltrate silently.

Discovering three hidden cultivators—all with suppressed auras and spiritual senses—Gu Mo seized the perfect opportunity. At optimal range, he hurled his most powerful weapon: a second-grade Cherry Bomb.

Against one mid-stage and two early-stage Foundation Establishment experts, direct confrontation was suicide. But with the element of surprise, the odds shifted dramatically.

After the explosion subsided, Gu Mo returned to inspect the aftermath. While the Cherry Bomb could obliterate early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators instantly, the mid-stage expert might have survived. He needed confirmation—letting any assassins escape would compromise his hidden trump card.

Just as Gu Mo neared the crater, his steps faltered. He leapt back instantly as a sword beam struck where he'd stood moments before.

Dodging the ambush, Gu Mo's gaze locked onto a bloodied figure staggering forward—the mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. In desperation, the man had activated a forbidden technique, burning all his spiritual energy to survive the blast.

The cost was severe: critical injuries and depleted spiritual power, barely sustained by copious medicinal pills. The meager energy he'd recovered had fueled that failed sneak attack.

Though Gu Mo was disguised and aura-concealed, the assassin recognized his target. This supposedly simple mission had gone horribly wrong. Still, even in his weakened state, killing a Qi Condensation cultivator should be effortless.

Gulping more energy-restoring pills, the assassin prepared to strike again.

But Gu Mo acted first. Never underestimating a Foundation Establishment expert—even a wounded one—he assumed his enemy might possess deadly talismans requiring minimal energy to activate. Swift elimination was paramount.

Gu Mo unleashed his full power, summoning the magic treasure-grade flying sword he'd been nurturing. Channeling a week's worth of liquefied spiritual energy into the low-grade magic treasure, the blade finally revealed its true might.

"You—you're a Foundation Establishment cultivator?!" The assassin paled. While he could ignore mere magical instruments, a magic treasure posed a genuine threat. When Gu Mo fully activated the sword's power, despair filled the wounded man's face. In his condition, he could handle a Qi Condensation cultivator, but not a Foundation Establishment opponent.

"Whoosh!"

As the assassin cried out, Gu Mo formed a sword seal. The magic treasure transformed into a streak of light, piercing the man's skull effortlessly. In his state, merely standing was an achievement—dodging was impossible.

With this, He Shaogang's assassination plot was thoroughly thwarted. While the young master might attempt another ambush, Gu Mo would likely reach the resource point first.

Once established at a location with second-grade spirit fields, eliminating Gu Mo would require more than a few Foundation Establishment experts—unless He Shaogang deployed a Golden Core cultivator.

Coincidentally, this region belonged to demon beasts, including a third-grade beast with Golden Core-level power. Since this was the only route to the resource point, any Golden Core assassin would first have to contend with the local beast overlord.

Considering this, Gu Mo decided to frame the demon beasts for the assassins' deaths, buying himself more development time. By the time He Shaogang realized Gu Mo required Golden Core intervention to eliminate, he might already be strong enough to face such opponents.

With second-grade spirit fields, Gu Mo could potentially cultivate third-grade vegetation through extreme frugality.

"Excellent—loot too!"

Gu Mo retrieved a storage pouch from the mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. These assassins clearly belonged to a major faction—their wealth far exceeded what ordinary rogue cultivators possessed. His two early-stage Foundation Establishment companions had been vaporized by the Cherry Bomb's annihilative force, a drawback of such explosives.

The storage pouch contained 100 mid-grade spirit stones—no pills remained, likely consumed during the battle. This doubled the 50 mid-grade stones Gu Mo had previously lost. The pouch itself was also magic treasure-grade.

Near the sword beam's impact site, Gu Mo found another unremarkable low-grade magic treasure flying sword, identical to his current weapon.

Killing a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator had yielded 100 mid-grade spirit stones, a storage pouch, and a magic treasure—a bountiful harvest. Ordinary rogue cultivators would have left nothing behind, likely perishing completely in the explosion.

After staging the scene to appear as a demon beast attack, Gu Mo continued toward the resource point.

**Green Dew Sect**  

As days passed without news of the assassination, He Shaogang grew increasingly agitated.

"Young Master, a new report!" Yao Shifeng hurried in with an encrypted letter.

Decrypting it, He Shaogang frowned. The message confirmed the assassination team's soul lamps had extinguished. Investigators concluded they'd fallen to demon beasts.

"Demon beasts? What an unlikely coincidence." Suspicion gnawed at He Shaogang, though the location did border demon beast territory, making such encounters plausible.

Regardless, the immediate problem remained: Gu Mo survived. With the target likely reaching the fortified resource point, another assassination would prove difficult. Moreover, several major sects coveted that location—any operatives might be mistaken for raiders, sparking conflict.

Alternatively, He Shaogang could manipulate those rival sects into eliminating Gu Mo, though this required careful planning.

"Shifeng, deliver this." He Shaogang handed Yao Shifeng another encrypted letter.

Though aware it contained schemes against Gu Mo, Yao Shifeng showed no hesitation. After learning He Shaogang's true background, he'd pledged absolute loyalty—his fate was now inextricably tied to his master's ambitions.

"Yao Shifeng remains reliably efficient." Watching his subordinate depart, He Shaogang nodded approvingly. With Yao Shifeng handling affairs, Qian Qiyi could focus on the next phase.

Having learned from the Gu Mo debacle, He Shaogang had placed multiple restrictions on Yao Shifeng to prevent another betrayal.

**The Resource Point**  

At last, a low hill came into view—Gu Mo's destination. He'd thoroughly researched this resource point beforehand.

Though not the sect's highest-grade outpost, its importance ranked highly because it produced a primary ingredient for Foundation Establishment Pills.
