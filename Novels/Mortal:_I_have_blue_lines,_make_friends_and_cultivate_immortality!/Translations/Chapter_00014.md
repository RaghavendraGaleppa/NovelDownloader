# Chapter 14: Full Mastery of Talisman Crafting!

Han Li's room.

Having stayed up all night, Han Li appeared somewhat exhausted as he stared blankly at the pile of ruined talisman papers on his table. 

He had devoted the entire night to drawing talismans, yet not a single one had succeeded. Even someone as composed as him couldn't help but look up at the ceiling and curse, "Damn heavens, you're mocking me! Out of twelve sheets of talisman paper, at least one should've worked. This is just a basic low-tier Calming Spirit Talisman! Did I pick the wrong day for this?"

After venting, Han Li felt slightly better, his frustration somewhat alleviated. 

He tilted his head in thought, glancing at the nearly depleted cinnabar box and the golden bamboo brush on the table. He wondered if the failure was due to subpar materials—perhaps the brush and cinnabar weren't good enough. 

Otherwise, after an entire night of attempting the simplest low-tier talisman, shouldn't he have succeeded at least once? 

The complete lack of success was a heavy blow—one he struggled to accept. 

This failure had left a deep psychological scar.

"Right! It must be the brush and cinnabar. Maybe the talisman paper isn't great either. It's not my fault!" Han Li asserted, convincing himself to ease his frustration.

Just then, Lin Yun walked in, overhearing Han Li's curses and his complaints about the materials. Unable to hold back, Lin Yun burst into laughter.

"Haha—Brother Han, you—haha—you're truly something else."

"You expected to succeed on your first try at talisman crafting?" Lin Yun shook his head in amusement.

"Is that not normal?" Han Li asked, puzzled.

"Among us cultivators, very few actually craft talismans themselves. Most buy what they need from trading markets. Even those from major clans do the same," Lin Yun explained.

"Why?" Han Li was surprised. The *Qingxi Notes* Lin Yun had given him hadn’t mentioned this.

"It's simple. Skilled talisman masters are rare, and training one is incredibly costly. Only the major sects can afford it," Lin Yun said with a smile.

"You think failing all night is bad? For beginners, failing a hundred times in a row is normal. Some with poorer talent might fail a thousand times before succeeding—that’s not unusual either!"

"Only after thousands of attempts does the success rate gradually improve—and that’s just for one type of talisman. If you switch to another type, the failure rate remains shockingly high at first, though not as bad as a complete beginner."

"Now do you understand, Brother Han? Talisman crafting is incredibly difficult, requiring vast resources. That’s why skilled artifact forgers are common, but skilled talisman masters are rare."

"If you ever become an intermediate talisman master, the Seven Sects would beg you to join them," Lin Yun said with a smile.

Han Li was stunned by this revelation.

"But if talisman crafting is so hard, why do people still sell cinnabar and talisman paper?" Han Li asked, still confused.

"That’s for those practicing *talismanic arts*," Lin Yun clarified.

"Talismanic arts?"

"Talismanic arts involve sealing a spell into a talisman. When you activate it, the spell is released, and the talisman burns away."

"To practice talismanic arts, you must first master the spell you want to seal. How else could you imprint it onto the paper?"

"True talismans, however, are special mediums. Even if you don’t know a spell, you can use a talisman to cast it. The talisman only burns away after its spiritual energy is exhausted."

"Most 'talismans' on the market today are actually talismanic arts products, not true talismans. Sealing spells into paper is costly, but since the variety is limited, it’s manageable."

"Thank you for the guidance, Brother Lin!" Han Li bowed deeply in gratitude.

**[Ding! Host has enlightened friend Han Li on talisman arts, broadening his cultivation perspective. Triggered: "One Good Turn Deserves Another!"]**  

**[Ding! Congratulations, host has obtained: Full Mastery of Beginner, Intermediate, and Advanced Talisman Crafting!]**  

**[Treasure Description: Han Li’s accumulated talisman-crafting experience, refined over countless trials with the Heaven-Stealing Bottle’s infinite resources.]**  

Seeing the system notification, Lin Yun’s eyes curved into crescents. He patted Han Li’s shoulder. "We’re brothers—no need for formalities."

"Practicing talisman crafting now is impossible. I’ll just buy some Calming Spirit Talismans later," Han Li conceded, realizing the futility of his efforts.

Then, he noticed Lin Yun’s aura had grown stronger. "Brother Lin, you broke through?!"

"Just luck," Lin Yun said modestly.

"Brother Lin has advanced, and I’ve reached the peak of the eighth layer with the subsequent techniques in hand. It’s time to break through to the ninth layer," Han Li resolved.

For the next half-month, Han Li became disciplined.  

By day, he consumed pills and meditated to cultivate the Evergreen Art.  

By night, he practiced newly learned spells in secluded valleys.  

His routine left Lin Yun with little to do, but the gains from Han Li were already substantial.  

"System, open my status panel," Lin Yun commanded.

"My defenses are decent, but offense is lacking," Lin Yun mused after reviewing his panel.  

He had top-grade defensive artifacts, even a supreme-grade shield like the Giant Tortoise Shield. But his offensive options were lacking.  

Using talisman treasures for every fight would be wasteful—especially since Qi Refinement cultivators couldn’t unleash their full power.  

He needed a proper offensive artifact.  

"Leave it to you, my sworn brother from another life—Han Li!"  

After ten days of rigorous cultivation, Han Li finally broke through to the ninth layer of the Evergreen Art just before the Tai Nan Gathering ended.  

Now at the ninth layer, Han Li felt invigorated—his demeanor exuded confidence, his steps light as wind.
