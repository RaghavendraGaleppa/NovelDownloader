# Chapter 194: The Golden Sun of Thoughts and the Heavenly Insight Eye

**[Ninth-Grade Immortal Seed: Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud]**

"The name remains unchanged?" Zhang Jing's eyes flickered with realization as new information emerged from the jade talisman in his mud pellet palace.

He shook his head slightly. "No need to change it. A name is just a name, and 'Dao Origin' is superior to others. But... a ninth-grade immortal seed?" A contemplative expression crossed his face.

The grading of immortal seeds didn't surprise him, but the criteria for classification puzzled him. Based on past experience, it likely correlated with the grade of corresponding divine ability inheritances. Yet, did the Dao Repository's secret realms in the Radiant Immortal World have such classifications? Had he overlooked this before?

Unable to resolve this immediately, Zhang Jing set the matter aside—he would find out upon returning. His attention returned to the transformed Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud, particularly its newly added sixth golden layer where a sun bathed in radiant light shimmered mysteriously.

"The Golden Sun of Thoughts!" he marveled inwardly. The evolution of his Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud into an immortal seed had dramatically enhanced his former Blazing Sun Auspicious Cloud divine ability.

This golden sun existed between reality and illusion, capable of absorbing scattered thoughts, desires, and delusions from surrounding beings, refining them into Postnatal Purple Qi—a supreme treasure for enlightenment and cultivation.

"Previously, the Blazing Sun Auspicious Cloud could only refine my own thoughts to aid enlightenment. Now it can process others' thoughts too," Zhang Jing mused with a wry smile. While powerful, this ability carried faintly demonic undertones.

A sudden realization struck him—this Golden Sun of Thoughts perfectly complemented his path of Primordial Beginning World Manifestation! Combined with his Twenty-Four Heavens divine ability, the countless beings within his manifested worlds would provide an endless stream of thoughts to refine.

If Postnatal Purple Qi existed, might there also be legendary Primordial Purple Qi? Perhaps further upgrading the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud would reveal this.

"Harvesting sentient beings as cultivation resources? How strange—the further I progress, the more I resemble those great villains from past-life stories," Zhang Jing thought with amusement.

The ground trembled suddenly, drawing his attention as the secret realm's spirit announced: "The Blazing Cloud Secret Realm will close in two hours, reopening after one thousand years. Future participants must be at Golden Core realm."

Zhang Jing looked up in surprise—wasn't it supposed to reopen every hundred years? And now restricted to Golden Core cultivators? Before he could ponder further, the realm spirit vanished.

On the Island of Talents, cultivators froze at the announcement, then sighed in relief at their timely participation. In the outer spectator stands, despair spread among those who had planned to join in the next cycle.

"Once every millennium? And only Golden Core cultivators? The competition will be unimaginable!" someone lamented.

"Congratulations, Brother Zhang, for claiming victory in the Blazing Cloud Secret Realm!" Voices approached—Qu Junhou, along with Ji Jiulin, Wang Wunian, and others from the Dao Enlightenment Gathering, accompanied by seven unfamiliar faces, all wearing expressions of deep admiration.

Other cultivators hesitated to approach, intimidated by the presence of these former top ten elite talents, whose prestige remained undeniable despite being overshadowed by Zhang Jing's rise.

As departure neared, the group extended enthusiastic invitations: "If you ever visit Supreme Nurturance Pole Emperor Heaven, I'll ensure you experience true hospitality!"

Zhang Jing responded graciously to each, maintaining humility despite his newfound status. These connections with scions of immortal lineages represented valuable future assets in the treacherous cultivation world.

Alone again, Zhang Jing examined a golden talisman before turning his gaze skyward. His six-layered auspicious cloud manifested, radiating immortal light as the Heavenly Insight Eye at its center opened, projecting divine radiance.

Through this enhanced vision, Zhang Jing beheld the secret realm's boundaries—void cracks exuding chaotic energy, interwoven with countless glowing dao principle chains that constantly broke and reformed. This was the intersection between the secret realm and the True Essence Exquisite Heaven!

"To think the evolved Heavenly Insight Eye can perceive the manifestation of heavenly dao principles!" Though excited by this revelation, Zhang Jing's current cultivation proved insufficient for deeper comprehension. As spatial expulsion intensified, he reluctantly withdrew.

Summoning an ancient stone gate, Zhang Jing stepped through—only to find himself not at the expected plaza, but in an unfamiliar space.

"Junior Brother, to think you've grown so remarkably in just days!" A familiar voice greeted him.

"Senior Brother Feng!" Zhang Jing smiled. "It's been over thirty years, not days."

Feng Wuyu chuckled. "For cultivators like us, decades pass like days—you'll understand in time." His eyes betrayed profound shock—his junior brother had actually mastered and fused all thirty-six dao concepts required for the Primordial Beginning World Manifestation path in just thirty years, far exceeding their master's expectations.

Behind Feng Wuyu sat eight formidable figures, their auras manifesting terrifying phenomena—some with blood seas devouring worlds, others with moons illuminating the heavens. Their curious gazes settled on Zhang Jing.

"Allow me to introduce Junior Brother Zhang Jing," Feng Wuyu announced proudly. "Upon returning to the sect, he will formally become a true disciple of our master, the Venerable Yuanming, and join the ranks of the Supreme Oneness Infinite Dao Sect's elite!"
