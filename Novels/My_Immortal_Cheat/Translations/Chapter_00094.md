# Chapter 94: World-Destroying, Earth-Shattering, Invincible Radiant Flame Fist

By the time Zhou Tian went out again, preparing to promote his unique prayer method, he found that the atmosphere on the streets was vastly different. There were few white-robed believers, and everyone walked with hurried steps.

He hadn't gone far when he ran into Musu, who was rushing in his direction.

Musu also spotted Zhou Tian, frowning as he asked, "What are you doing?"

"Just taking a stroll," Zhou Tian replied.

"Don't go out for the next couple of days. It's said that heretical cultists have infiltrated Sai Le City and blasphemed the God Lord..." Before Musu could finish speaking, he looked at Zhou Tian with a peculiar gaze, then glanced around and whispered, "It... couldn't be you, could it?"

Musu had just received the news and hadn't thought much of it, merely sighing. But at the sight of Zhou Tian, that bizarre thought instantly struck him: could this scoundrel actually be one of those "heretical cultists"?

"How could it be? How can you污人清白 (sully my innocence) like that?" Zhou Tian felt a little guilty, but then he remembered that he wasn't a member of any cult, and instantly became self-righteous. "Alright, you came looking for me, so you must have found out something. Come with me."

Seeing Musu about to babble on, Zhou Tian quickly changed the subject and turned towards his residence. Musu followed him.

"Your great enemy is imprisoned in the Tribunal," Musu told him after entering the room. Where they were held wasn't a big secret, and after two days of feigning cordiality with a guard, Musu had easily extracted the information.

"The Tribunal?" Zhou Tian looked at Musu with a hint of confusion.

"The Tribunal is beneath the Central Cathedral, guarded by numerous powerful figures from the sect."

"Beneath the Central Cathedral? Do you know the exact location?" Zhou Tian pressed, merely knowing it was beneath the Central Cathedral wasn't enough; he needed the precise spot.

"Exact location?" Musu frowned. "While everyone knows the Tribunal is beneath the Central Cathedral, few know its precise whereabouts."

"Alright," Zhou Tian didn't insist. Musu didn't have much influence here, and being able to gather this much information was already impressive. Expecting him to delve deeper was simply wishful thinking.

"Oh, right," Zhou Tian's heart stirred slightly, and he asked, "Do you know about the Vodou Cult?"

Musu looked up at him, silent for a moment before replying, "The Vodou Cult is a heretical cult that worships the Vodou Lord. Its doctrine preaches that the human body is merely a cage, and that true transcendence lies in the freedom of the soul."

"Oh," Zhou Tian nodded in understanding. No wonder that bald high priest had accused him of being a Vodou Cult follower; he must have thought Zhou Tian was using divine soul to control his body, creating the illusion of resurrection.

"Do you know how one can enter the Tribunal?"

"Why do you ask?" Musu was a little surprised.

"Nothing, just curious," Zhou Tian smiled, not elaborating.

"The Tribunal imprisons only heretical cultists. Except for those killed on the spot, all captured heretical cultists will be judged in the presence of all believers!"

"Understood," Zhou Tian nodded, deep in thought.

Musu watched Zhou Tian, who was lost in thought, and felt an unsettling premonition.

...

Later that evening, Musu left Zhou Tian's place, looking troubled. He couldn't shake the feeling that Zhou Tian was about to do something.

Zhou Tian, meanwhile, wandered around the Central Cathedral, eyes scanning the ground. He found an secluded spot, his figure blurring before vanishing. He instantly reappeared in the same place, a pained expression on his face. "What a huge loss, wasted a resurrection attempt."

Just now, he had teleported deep underground, trying to find the Tribunal, but was immediately crushed to smithereens by the incredibly dense earth. What sucked was that the system counted it as suicide this time, so it didn't increase his death count, which was quite annoying.

"Then there's only one way," Zhou Tian stroked his chin, recalling what Musu had told him.

He wasn't trying to directly rescue Zhang Yi right now, just to communicate with him, as blindly rushing in would be useless.

Taking out a mask, Zhou Tian put it on. He had noticed recently that these believers and cultivators didn't seem to use divine sense for some reason. At first, he thought it was a rule here, but later, in front of the bald high priest, he wore the mask, and the priest was unable to detect his identity. It was truly interesting.

He teleported to the steps in front of the Central Cathedral's entrance. Instantly, countless people who had come to pray turned their gazes to him, as his attire was far too attention-grabbing.

Zhou Tian steadied himself and took a deep breath. "Long live the Vodou Lord! The Holy Divine Sect is trash!"

A loud shout startled the nearby crowd, who then looked at Zhou Tian with fury. To dare to blaspheme the Holy Divine Sect in front of the Central Cathedral was simply courting death!

"Kill him!" a believer roared, his face contorted in anger. Milky-white light surged, and a holy sword tens of meters long appeared, slicing through the air with a fierce wind, heading straight for Zhou Tian!

"Just what I was waiting for!" Zhou Tian's eyes flashed. The holy sword that had just touched him instantly vanished, sealed away by him. At the same time, his figure disappeared from its spot, reappearing at the cathedral entrance. With a wave of his hand, a white holy sword emerged, radiating potent power, though its size was slightly diminished.

*Clang!*

A crisp sound echoed as the holy sword struck a stone pillar of the cathedral. Gravel splattered, and a large gouge was carved into the pillar.

"Who dares to act so presumptuously!" a booming voice rang out. A figure flew out from the cathedral, clad in silver armor adorned with intricate patterns, some even showing subtle cracks. His face was aged, exuding authority without needing to rage, yet his eyes were filled with fury, glaring at Zhou Tian, his eyeballs almost popping out.

"It's the Cathedral Knight, Lord Bohr!" someone exclaimed with reverence. Every cathedral had a Cathedral Knight responsible for its protection, and as the Holy City, the Central Cathedral's knight was exceptionally powerful.

"Long live the Vodou Cult! The Holy Divine Sect is a little brother!" Zhou Tian shouted, feeling his blood surge with excitement, only regretting that he didn't have two bombs on him.

"Courting death!" The old man was so enraged his whiskers bristled. How long had it been since such a brazen heretical cultist dared to appear in the Holy City? The Holy Divine Sect was a colossal power in the ancient era of the God Realm, and even in this God-forsaken land, it remained among the strongest of the surviving sects.

Light flared around him, his qi and blood like a rainbow. His figure shot forth instantly, tearing cracks in the air. Flames ignited on his fist, creating a sonic boom as he struck directly at Zhou Tian.

Zhou Tian did not dodge or evade, standing his ground. His fist slammed into Zhou Tian, but instead of the expected scene of a body exploding, it felt as if he had punched thin air. A sense of powerlessness washed over him, all the strength in his fist drained away, and even the flames extinguished.

Zhou Tian let out a "hehe" chuckle, then roared, "World-Destroying, Earth-Shattering, Invincible Radiant Flame Fist!" Flames ignited on his fist, carrying unparalleled might as it blasted into Bohr, who was now directly in front of him.
