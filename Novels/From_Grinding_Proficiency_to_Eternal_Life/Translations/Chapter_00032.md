# Chapter 32: Beiye City

At this point, once he had perfected both skin tempering and tendon training, he could already be called a Two-tempering Warrior. With his strength having reached this level, securing a livelihood would be effortless. He might even, as Li Haomiao had said, be able to join a powerful sect.

In the Great Zhou Dynasty, sects controlled a third of the world.

Although becoming a disciple with prior martial arts experience meant he wouldn't be part of the direct lineage, it was still far better than those who started as ordinary disciples at the bottom.

Whether becoming a guest elder or an outer gate elder, both were good options.

By then, he would truly have established himself.

In the woods at the foot of the mountain, as Xu Yunfan moved forward, he could already see signs of human activity and faintly hear the movements of hunters hunting in the distant mountains.

He had no intention of paying any attention to them now, simply following the increasingly chaotic footprints as he continued forward.

The more footprints there were, the closer he was to the town. This was no difficult task for him, who possessed hunting skills. In fact, just from observing these footprints, his hunting proficiency had increased by several points.

*‘You carefully observed the footprints and, through diligent differentiation, confirmed they matched your suspicions by about sixty or seventy percent. Your hunting proficiency has increased.’*

*‘You carefully searched for tracks, discovering they were left by a wild boar. You carefully deduced its direction of travel and found it was indeed as you expected. Your hunting proficiency has increased.’*

*‘...’*

Finally, upon crossing a small hill, what greeted his eyes was a village—a quaint village covered in pure white snow.

The houses were all wooden structures with green-tiled roofs, arranged in a staggered, orderly fashion. Thick snow pressed down on the tiles, and from some chimneys, wisps of green smoke curled upward, creating a particularly comfortable atmosphere.

The roads in the village wound曲折ly, their outlines blurred by the snow, occasionally marked by a few strings of footprints of varying depths or hoof prints left by livestock, extending into the distance.

Several villagers, wrapped in thick cotton-padded clothes, hunched their heads to avoid the cold wind, hurriedly walked past carrying hoes.

Seeing this peaceful scene, Xu Yunfan felt an urge to shed tears. Since arriving here, his vision had been filled only with desolate, frozen wastelands or the whips of overseers. Rushing along the way, he had never had the heart to appreciate any beautiful scenery.

Li Haomiao, on the other hand, had been extremely leisurely, commenting on how beautiful this place was or how marvelous that sight was, even becoming poetic enough to recite a few verses.

It had truly annoyed Xu Yunfan for a long time.

He touched the silk cloth in his chest, and his heart immediately settled. At least this trip hadn't been in vain. He needed to find a place to stay first.

Relying on the village, Xu Yunfan finally managed to ask an old man and found the direction to the city.

Watching Xu Yunfan's retreating figure, the old man caught his breath and tapped the ash from his old pipe onto the sole of his shoe.

"My goodness, that young man is really built sturdy. He walked over like a bear, scared this old man to death."

To be honest, Xu Yunfan was wearing thick fur clothing. Plus, with the perfection of the Red Copper Body and Cloak Hammer technique, his body had become extremely robust under the support of the attribute panel. From a distance, he looked very bulky. Moreover, the fur was only roughly tanned, greatly retaining its original characteristics. The hat on his head was even made from bear fur.

At a glance, one might really think a bear was swaying as it walked over.

"Beiye City!"

Looking at the plaque hanging above the city gate, Xu Yunfan's face showed emotion.

Looking up, the heavy city gate was made of simple, solid wood, with mottled copper nails on it. The soldiers holding long spears on both sides looked somewhat drowsy. The city walls were covered in green bricks and snow, with withered vines winding upon them.

Most of the surrounding pedestrians hurried past wrapped in worn-out cotton-padded clothes, some hunching their necks, some covering their ears.

A few men and women dressed in fine clothes were also in a hurry, not lingering.

However, without exception, everyone subconsciously avoided Xu Yunfan, who was standing in the middle of the main road observing the city. With skin tempering perfected, his height had been forcibly increased by several inches under the assistance of the attribute panel, approaching a height of 1.9 meters. Combined with the fur clothing he wore and the unpleasant smell emanating from his body, which hadn't been washed for many days, even in the cold winter, it made people frown and cover their noses to avoid him.

If it weren't for Xu Yunfan's terrifyingly large build, someone would have already complained out loud.

Xu Yunfan naturally noticed this situation and stopped looking around. Under the wary gazes of the two soldiers, he quickly entered Beiye City.

Only after Xu Yunfan left did the two soldiers let out a sigh of relief.

After a while, one soldier suddenly spoke.

"It seems we haven't collected the entry fee from him?"

The soldier opposite him replied impatiently, "If you want to collect it, go ahead. That guy, the smell of blood on him is too strong, he's a ruthless character."

"..."

As soon as he entered the city, Xu Yunfan quickly found a clothing shop and sold all his fur, leaving only the Extreme Path Remnant Skin wrapped around his body.

Under Xu Yunfan's obvious intimidation as a martial artist, the owner of the ready-made clothing shop dared not lower the price. Xu Yunfan got twenty-six taels of silver, spent four taels to buy a set of black clothes, and then, using a bucket of bath water generously provided by the owner, cleaned himself and put on the new clothes.

When Xu Yunfan walked out from the back courtyard of the clothing shop, the shop owner's eyes lit up. He cupped his hands and said, "Sir, you look exceptionally mighty."

Xu Yunfan's lips curled slightly, and he waved his hand. "Alright. I'll take care of your business if I have any mountain goods in the future."

The owner's face immediately beamed with joy, repeatedly cupping his hands.

"Thank you, Great Hero!"

The two bear pelts on Xu Yunfan, if tanned properly and made into coats, would net the owner at least ten taels of silver in pure profit.

What a good deal!

Xu Yunfan wandered aimlessly through Beiye City. The snow in the city had been trampled into mud by the往来 pedestrians, and the cold wind, carrying a piercing chill, freely seeped into his clothes.

With his skin tempering perfected, the blood and energy in his body were vigorous, and his vitality was strong, so he naturally wasn't afraid, and even felt quite leisurely.

Moreover, his Flying Leg skill had been increasing in proficiency rapidly these days and had now reached Minor Completion. As long as he practiced diligently, he might be able to reach the Great Completion realm in just over a dozen days.

An inch longer in tendon means an inch more in strength, and naturally, his blood and energy would become even more vigorous.

Suddenly, his footsteps halted, his brows slightly furrowed, and he subconsciously looked towards a dark corner of an alley.

What entered his eyes was two bodies huddled in the corner.

The larger one used its body to half-protect the smaller one. Both were dressed in rags, with patches upon patches, appearing exceptionally thin in this icy world.

The child's small hand tightly gripped the adult's clothes, its head buried in the adult's chest without moving. The adult looked up at the sky, a lingering despair on their face.

Xu Yunfan paused for a moment, then silently moved on.

This world, it seemed, was not as Li Haomiao had described, where the people lived and worked in peace and contentment, with ample food and clothing.

He found a restaurant, ordered a table of dishes, and listened to the boisterous discussions around him as he夹了一筷子菜 into his mouth.

It was sour and spicy, delicious, whetting his appetite.

This was the food meant for humans!

Xu Yunfan ate like a whirlwind, wiped his mouth after finishing, and, imitating the table next to him, called out.

"Waiter, the bill."

"Sir, hope you enjoyed your meal! That's two taels and three qian of silver."

Xu Yunfan's heart skipped a beat. He silently paid and walked out of the restaurant, looking back one last time.

*Newbie asking for reads, collections, investments, votes, asking for everything, thank you all!*
