Chapter 24: The Fiery Sea, Assembling the Team

"Indeed, ten years have passed. I'm not sure if that Blazing Sun Beast is still there," Huoyuan said, frowning slightly, uncertain.

"Let's go. Come with me out to sea. I'll go confirm it," Yang Ji suddenly declared.

"How will you confirm? Does Master intend to delve into that volcanic crater?" Huoyuan shook his head and quickly said, "Master, that dormant volcanic crater isn't large, but it's pitch black inside, frighteningly deep and dark, like an entrance to hell. Back then, I chased that Blazing Sun Beast right to the edge, but I just couldn't bring myself to go down."

Yang Ji could understand his fear of the unknown, but he had his own methods to probe the dangers within. He vaguely replied, "Just take me to see it; I have my own way."

"Alright, Master!" Huoyuan was also a shrewd man and didn't ask further. He immediately said, "Then I'll go arrange a large ship with Shopkeeper Jin for our sea voyage."

"Don't reveal too much to him," Yang Ji suddenly added.

"I understand that, Master, rest assured," Huoyuan chuckled, his eyes full of wisdom.

Yang Ji saw that he wasn't foolish and nodded. Indeed, having people under him made things much more convenient. It seemed giving him the pill recipe and some benefits earlier was not a mistake. Yang Ji felt quite satisfied.

Huoyuan was very efficient. With his status as the chief alchemist of the Myriad Treasures Pavilion, he encountered no obstacles. Half an hour later, the two were slowly sailing out to sea on a large ship.

After a day of rapid travel, the large ship stopped before a somewhat peculiar sea area. The sea ahead stretched out to the horizon in a reddish-yellow hue, clashing starkly with the deep blue behind them and refusing to blend.

"Master, this sea area is called the Fiery Sea. There are numerous volcanoes here, both on the islands and at the bottom of the ocean. It produces many unique spirit herbs and ores, but it's very dangerous," Huoyuan introduced from the side.

Without Huoyuan needing to say more, Yang Ji could already see the densely packed small islands ahead, arranged like chess pieces. There was no life on them, only raging red lava spilling out and black smoke rising into the sky. Thick smoke veiled the sky, and raging flames soared hundreds of feet high, resembling a scorched earth battlefield, a true purgatory. It truly was a place of flowing magma and raging flames for three hundred *li*, with black smoke billowing, furiously dyeing the sky. This was simply not a place for humans. The temperature was terrifyingly high; the air itself was severely distorted, creating visible ripples of heat haze. The entire Fiery Sea resembled a massive furnace, with boiling water and rolling heat waves. Even the slightest breeze carried a scorching heat that ordinary people would find unbearable.

Catching whiffs of pungent sulfur, Yang Ji instinctively furrowed his brows. He then looked to the side and asked, "Where is that dormant undersea volcano?"

"Not far from here. Master, follow me." Huoyuan, with a flick of his hand, produced a Water Skiff, sat in it first, and then submerged into the seabed. Yang Ji also took out his Water Skiff and followed. The two traveled ten *li* along the flowing magma-infused water before stopping. Below them was a dormant volcanic crater, a hundred *zhang* in diameter. It was pitch black inside, truly deep and dark. It was like a colossal deep-sea creature opening its mouth, quietly waiting for prey to walk right into its trap, inspiring awe and fear.

"Master, it's just below. I don't know if that Blazing Sun Beast is still inside," Huoyuan said, also uncertain.

Yang Ji didn't reply. Instead, he fixed his gaze downwards, and immediately, information appeared: [Dormant volcano, magma accumulating inside, will erupt again in one hundred years.] Magma inside? Yang Ji raised an eyebrow and continued to stare. His gaze seemed to possess a penetrative power, as various complex pieces of information burst forth before his eyes like code. Another piece of information was captured: [Hot magma inside breeds Flame Serpents.] Soon after, another piece of information was captured: [Deep within the magma lies a dormant Blazing Sun Beast, Level 10.]

Blazing Sun Beast! Seeing this information display, Yang Ji's heart swelled with joy, but his expression quickly turned solemn. Level 10? This Blazing Sun Beast was already more powerful than ordinary demonic beasts, and its fiery breath was unmatched. At Level 10, it could even contend with human Foundation Establishment experts. This seemed a bit troublesome. Yang Ji frowned, thinking to himself, "This Blazing Sun Beast was only a Level 7 demonic beast ten years ago. How did it break through so quickly?" He was somewhat confused because demonic beasts cultivated much slower than human cultivators. Furthermore, this Blazing Sun Beast was not of royal demonic lineage, yet it cultivated so rapidly. However, now was not the time to ponder such things. Yang Ji gave Huoyuan a look, then maneuvered his Water Skiff to burst out of the water.

On the large ship, Huoyuan asked, "Master, did you discern anything just now? Is that Blazing Sun Beast still down there?"

"It should still be down there, yes. Let's go, we'll head back and prepare," Yang Ji replied.

"Should?" Huoyuan's brow twitched, his small eyes darting around slightly. He looked at Yang Ji, then nodded in sudden realization. Right! Who cares if it's there or not, as long as we treat it as if it is! After all, this Blazing Sun Beast was a rare fire-attribute demonic beast. It would be a great pity to miss out. They had to go down and investigate. Yang Ji glanced at him but said nothing more.

"Master, ten years ago, that Blazing Sun Beast was already close to breaking through to Level 8. Now that so many years have passed, it's likely a Level 9 demonic beast. With our current strength, it would be very difficult to kill it," Huoyuan analyzed.

"Indeed, very difficult." That was a Level 10 demonic beast; it would certainly be difficult. It wasn't something a Level 7 Qi Condensation cultivator and a Level 9 Qi Condensation cultivator could handle. Yang Ji then said, "Ten years have passed; let's treat it as a Level 10 demonic beast."

"Level 10 demonic beast?" Huoyuan's expression paused, and he hesitated before saying, "If that's the case, wouldn't we need a Foundation Establishment expert to deal with it?"

"Precisely. So, I'll need Master Huoyuan's help. I'll pay the remuneration for you to gather experts under your name as a peak alchemist to go down and hunt it. Is Master Huoyuan willing to help me with this?" Yang Ji asked with a sidelong smile.

"Master, you jest. Forget just helping, I'd even be willing to jump down myself!" Huoyuan chuckled, glancing at the dormant volcanic crater beneath the distant sea surface. However, his expression quickly shifted into an imperceptible awkwardness. His small eyes subtly shifted, and a shiver immediately ran down his spine. [If I were to jump down, I'd genuinely be a bit scared. I'm almost at Level 10 Qi Condensation; I can still join a sect and fight for a chance. If I can reach Foundation Establishment, I'll have hundreds of more years of good life.] Huoyuan narrowed his small eyes, adjusted his robes, and after subtly puffing out his chest, smiled: "Master, we are alchemists, our status is noble. The task of hunting should be left to those rogue cultivators. You can rest easy on the ship later, waiting for them to bring up the beast fire."

"You're right, we must make good use of the alchemist's status," Yang Ji said, giving him a mysterious smile.

The two then returned to the Myriad Treasures Pavilion. On the second floor, in a luxuriously furnished room, seven people were seated around a table. Huoyuan sat in the main seat. To his left was Yang Ji, and to his right was Chen De. As for the other five, Yang Ji knew them: Xu Xiangsong, Liu Yongqing, Tan Guanghong, Fang Sheng, and his Dao companion Liu Furong. They had all met Yang Ji during his previous voyages. Over the past two years, besides cultivating, Yang Ji would occasionally go out to sea with the ships. Over time, everyone had become familiar with each other. Calling them now was for the purpose of hunting the Blazing Sun Beast. However, the one in charge was Huoyuan, as they were unaware of Yang Ji's identity as an alchemist. Jin Dafu and Huoyuan had not mentioned it to anyone outside.

"Master Huoyuan, you've even invited Senior Chen. Could it be that the demonic beast we're hunting this time is of the Demonic General rank?" Xu Xiangsong asked, his expression flickering slightly.

Huoyuan sat steadily in the main seat, his expression solemn and dignified. He leisurely straightened his robes before slowly beginning: "This time, I've asked Shopkeeper Jin to invite everyone here to help this old man hunt a Level 10 demonic beast. This beast's core is useful to me; I need it to refine a special batch of pills. After the task is done, there will definitely be generous rewards."

"Oh? What kind of Level 10 demonic beast is worth Senior Chen and the five of us, all Level 10 Qi Condensation cultivators, acting together?" Liu Yongqing asked, still uncertain.

"You'll know once we get there," Huoyuan didn't answer directly, instead saying, "This beast's strength isn't particularly formidable; it just hides very deeply, so we need more people."

"Where is this beast hidden?" Liu Furong asked.

"In the Fiery Sea, within a dormant volcano," Huoyuan replied.

The Fiery Sea? Hearing this, Chen De's expression paused. Suddenly, a glint flashed in his eyes as if he had thought of something, and he smiled gently: "Since Master Huoyuan has extended such a gracious invitation, then I, Chen De, will certainly go."

"Then I thank Fellow Daoist Chen. After the matter is concluded, the pills will definitely be presented," Huoyuan said, cupping his hands in thanks. With his status as a peak alchemist, he was certainly on equal footing with Chen De.

Seeing that Chen De, a Foundation Establishment expert, had already agreed, the others exchanged glances and then all nodded towards Huoyuan. With a Foundation Establishment expert joining, plus the five of them, no matter how strong a Level 10 demonic beast was, it wouldn't be able to stir up trouble. The risk was infinitely reduced, so they naturally weren't afraid. They were all rogue cultivators who had experienced life and death, accustomed to acting according to circumstances. If there was genuine danger, they would certainly slip away first.

"Then I thank you all," Seeing everyone nod, Huoyuan immediately clasped his hands and smiled, then added, "Although that place is a dormant volcano, there might be magma inside. Everyone should still prepare thoroughly. We'll depart in three days."

"Good. Coincidentally, I have matters to attend to these next few days, so departing in three days would be perfect. I will definitely rush to the Fiery Sea to meet you all then," Chen De said with a gentle smile.
