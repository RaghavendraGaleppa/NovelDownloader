# Chapter 29: Breaking Limits  

Zhou Qing detected a hint of disappointment and unwillingness in Fu Song's tone.  

At the same time, he grew increasingly curious about the so-called "True Qi" and "Innate Realm." He faintly sensed that these concepts were related to the mysteries, transcendence, and immortality he sought.  

But clearly, they were still far beyond his current reach.  

Zhou Qing didn't press further. Instead, he simply asked for the recipe for the Blood Qi Powder.  

One must eat bite by bite and cultivate step by step.  

Even if he knew the answers now, what good would it do?  

Focus on the present!  

Seize the moment.  

Fu Song then handed him the recipe. At a glance, Zhou Qing understood why Fu Song had said the formula would be difficult for others but not for him.  

Having spent this time refining Five-Fragrance Pills and Black Chicken Pills, combined with his original body's memories of medicinal prices, Zhou Qing was now well-versed in the costs of most herbs.  

None of the ingredients required for the Blood Qi Powder were cheap. Aside from the majority being blood-nourishing herbs, there were also several potent ingredients whose prices were beyond the means of ordinary people.  

Fu Song must have assumed that with the Lin family's support, Zhou Qing would have no trouble gathering these herbs.  

Historically, merchants without strong marital ties often chose to back promising but impoverished scholars. Once these scholars passed the imperial examinations and gained official titles, they could, in turn, protect the merchants and even offer generous returns.  

Starting with the Five-Fragrance Pills, Zhou Qing had inevitably grown closer to the Lin family in collaboration. This was indeed an excellent choice for him at the moment.  

In every respect, Miss Lin was a worthy partner.  

The recipe he received only listed the names of the herbs. Fu Song then explained the steps for refining the Blood Qi Powder in detail, including measurements, heat control, and other specifics, urging Zhou Qing to memorize them thoroughly.  

If he forgot anything, he could always return to Qingfu Temple to consult Fu Song directly.  

Zhou Qing agreed, committed the instructions to memory, and then bid Fu Song farewell without delay, heading straight to find Miss Lin.  

Mastering the Crane Form Technique wasn't just about completing the Rejuvenation Talisman Manual—it was also crucial for merging the Tiger Play and Crane Form techniques.  

This was the first time since obtaining the "Health Master" that the concept of fusion had appeared. He was eager to see what effects the combination of Tiger Play and Crane Form would yield.

**Lin Residence**  

Zhou Qing was already familiar with the Lin family. Miss Lin had instructed that whenever Zhou Qing visited, no announcement was necessary. As long as she wasn't in her inner chambers, he could go directly to her.  

In a garden, Miss Lin, dressed in plain martial attire with her hair tied up, was sparring with Old Master Lin.  

Noticing Zhou Qing's arrival, they gradually ceased their movements.  

Zhou Qing first bowed in greeting. "Greetings, Master Lin. Greetings, Young Master Lin."  

Old Master Lin smiled warmly. "Young Master Zhou, please, have a seat."  

Once seated, Old Master Lin said, "Young Master Zhou, you're already so familiar with our family. There's no need for such formality. My given name is Tai. As an elder, may I presume to ask you to call me Uncle Tai?"  

Among scholars, it was customary to address an elder with an official title as "Uncle." Directly using their given name would be somewhat disrespectful.  

By asking Zhou Qing to call him "Uncle Tai," Old Master Lin was showing humility and also sparing Zhou Qing any future awkwardness should he pass the provincial examinations.  

Of course, there was another layer to this: by addressing him as "Uncle," Zhou Qing would be of a higher generation than Miss Lin, his granddaughter.  

This would solidify their familial hierarchy and prevent any unsavory gossip.  

He was doing this for his granddaughter's sake.  

Though the Lin family was wealthy, they were still merchants. Even if the two were to marry now, if Zhou Qing later achieved high honors and caught the eye of a noblewoman, wouldn't he regret it?  

Young love was often impulsive and fleeting. It was common for youthful passion to turn into lifelong resentment.  

If the two didn't end up together, Zhou Qing would at least remember their bond fondly in the future.  

Understanding Old Master Lin's intentions, Zhou Qing obliged and called him "Uncle Tai."  

Miss Lin showed no sign of disappointment. Instead, she smiled slightly and said, "It seems I'll have to call you Uncle Zhou from now on."  

"Young Master Lin jokes."  

"Young Master Zhou has long known I'm a woman. Now that we're even closer, there's no need to stand on ceremony," Miss Lin replied with a faint smile.  

Zhou Qing said, "A lady of noble bearing is still a young master."  

"I suppose that's true."  

In truth, she preferred Zhou Qing calling her "Young Master Lin." It made her feel as though the Lin family's legacy had found its rightful heir.  

Seeing his granddaughter's reaction, Old Master Lin knew she preferred being addressed as "Young Master Lin" rather than having their ages and generations emphasized.  

The child had suffered enough.  

His heart softened. The major principles were settled; minor matters could be left to her discretion.  

"Then from now on, we'll each address the other as we please. It may lack propriety, but it suits our temperaments. You young people should communicate freely. By the way, Wan'er, since Young Master Zhou has called me Uncle Tai, I shouldn't take the title in vain. Find him a worthy gift. As for any other matters Young Master Zhou may have, attend to them as well."  

Miss Lin readily agreed.  

Old Master Lin then took his leave.  

"Young Master Zhou, state your business. While it's still light out, I'll see it done promptly," Miss Lin said straightforwardly.  

Since the Lin family had already invested in Zhou Qing, it was only natural to continue supporting him.  

Her only fear was that Zhou Qing might stop seeking their help—that would truly create distance between them.  

---  

Zhou Qing truthfully explained the matter of the Blood Qi Powder.  

Miss Lin smiled. "So that's it. Tell the steward what herbs you need. I believe we have them all at home."  

"Why? Because your family practices martial arts?"  

Miss Lin nodded. "Grandfather's Bagua Palm also requires similar medicines. The recipes are likely quite alike. If we're missing one or two ingredients, we can find them at Jishi Hall."  

"Good. Thank you."  

After expressing his gratitude, Zhou Qing went with the steward to collect the herbs, then returned to bid farewell to Miss Lin and Old Master Lin. As for the gift Old Master Lin had mentioned, Zhou Qing declined to accept it.  

It was one thing for them to offer, but another for him to ask.

**Jiangzhou City, Fierce Tiger Gang**  

Chen Hu, leader of the Fierce Tiger Gang, sat on a chair draped with tiger skin. Despite his imposing position, his attire was anything but fierce. He held a volume of the *Analects*, straining to cultivate a scholarly air.  

His last venture into the slums had yielded little beyond breaking Hu the Butcher's leg.  

Young Master Zhang Shen of the Zhang family hadn't thought more highly of him for it. Instead, he'd sent a servant to reprimand Chen Hu for his lack of decorum. Consequently, some of the gang's hidden privileges began to vanish, and their situation grew increasingly difficult.  

Chen Hu's mood darkened.  

He wasn't a true scholar and could never belong to that circle.  

Even as a lackey, a single misstep could earn him harsh humiliation.  

"Just wait. Your days won't be good for long," Chen Hu seethed. He also despised that scholar—a mere child prodigy not long ago, who had suddenly risen to prominence by attaching himself to a high-ranking official like the Education Intendant.  

Why?  

Because he could write a few essays better?  

What a damned world.  

Chen Hu, who had risked life and limb for his position, found it unbearable that a poor scholar could surpass him so easily.  

Born into hardship, he loathed Zhou Qing, who shared his humble origins.  

Recent events had further convinced him that failing to deal with Zhou Qing earlier would come back to haunt him. Once Zhou Qing passed the provincial exams and gained official status, the Zhang family wouldn't lift a finger to help the Fierce Tiger Gang if Zhou Qing sought revenge.  

Though the gang seemed dominant in Jiangzhou, they were merely the gentry's chamber pots.  

"Wait two months. Once this blows over, create an 'accident,'" Chen Hu resolved bitterly, his heart unsettled.  

Reconciliation with Zhou Qing was impossible now—it would openly antagonize the Zhang family.  

---  

On his way back to the Lin family's old residence with the herbs, Zhou Qing spotted Fierce Tiger Gang members clashing with canal workers at the docks. The gang itself was involved in canal transport.  

Countless small gangs along the canals relied on water transport for their livelihoods. There was no unified "Canal Gang."  

If one existed, it would be the Canal Transport Governor's Office, which oversaw the waterways.  

The various Transport Offices were essentially branches of this authority.  

Canal workers often formed factions based on hometown ties.  

For the Fierce Tiger Gang to profit from canal transport, they had to encroach on others' territories, targeting the most vulnerable—outsiders banded together as laborers.  

Most conflicts stemmed from this.  

Zhou Qing noted these details because he hadn't forgotten his grudges against both the Zhang family and the Fierce Tiger Gang.  

If Zhang Shen was a hypocrite, the gang's actions were outright villainy.  

He would hold their leader accountable.  

He also knew that even if he didn't act against the gang leader, the man would eventually come for him again. The leader had no choice.  

But with the incident still fresh, the gang wouldn't dare make another move soon.  

They would likely wait a month or two for things to cool down before seeking an opportunity. In the meantime, they'd undoubtedly devise more covert plans.  

Zhou Qing's hidden concerns surfaced slightly, adding to his sense of urgency.  

Improve. Keep improving!  

---  

A room in the Lin family's old residence had been converted into an alchemy workshop by Zhou Qing. Returning to the courtyard, he set aside all other thoughts and began refining the Blood Qi Powder without delay.  

The failed remnants of the Black Chicken Pills, which used black chickens as the main ingredient, were fed to the rooster, Mao Ri, while the rest were used to nourish the large mulberry tree.  

This time, the failed remnants of the Blood Qi Powder were mostly given to Mao Ri, with the remainder used to water the mulberry tree.  

Zhou Qing believed Mao Ri was a rare breed with potential. If he ever attained immortality, Mao Ri could become a spiritual familiar, and the mulberry tree, a spiritual plant.  

Together, the three of them somewhat resembled a cultivator's entourage.  

Unfortunately, reality was still far from it.  

"True Qi, the Innate Realm—these must be gateways to immortality. But I'm still a long way off," Zhou Qing mused, recalling Fu Song's mentions of True Qi and the Innate Realm.  

The day before his enrollment at the prefectural academy arrived.  

With the aid of the Blood Qi Powder, Zhou Qing successfully advanced the Crane Form Technique to "Proficient," increasing his remaining lifespan by three years to forty-two.  

Martial training was seventy percent nourishment, thirty percent practice.  

His previous month of hard work had only brought the Crane Form Technique to "Beginner." With the Blood Qi Powder, his progress skyrocketed.  

This was also due to his formidable mental strength.  

Recalling the surging, turbulent energy after consuming the Blood Qi Powder, which he had subdued with his will and guided into the Crane Form's movements to generate Crane Force, Zhou Qing even felt he might be a martial arts prodigy held back only by insufficient physical vitality.  

Under the influence of Crane Force, his body gained a peculiar lightness that enhanced the effects of the Breeze Talisman Manual.  

Thus, both the "Tiger Pounce" and "Deer Run" techniques could be amplified by Crane Force.  

Unlike the warm energy produced by practicing the Five Animals Exercises, Crane Force could be stored in the dantian but diminished with use.  

To replenish it, he needed more Blood Qi Powder.  

Essentially, Crane Force was derived from vitality.  

The vitality from the Blood Qi Powder was temporary and couldn't merge with Zhou Qing's body. However, converting it into Crane Force allowed it to be preserved.  

Yet Crane Force lacked the restorative properties of the warm energy from the Five Animals Exercises, which could heal physical injuries.  

The warm energy was a product of the unique connection between the Five Animals Exercises and the Health Master.  

Moreover, after developing Crane Force, Zhou Qing practiced the Crane Needle technique on himself to enhance the Crane Form. But while he could manage it on himself, applying it to treat others required greater finesse.  

Using Crane Force with the Crane Needle demanded extreme concentration.  

A patient's afflicted areas were delicate, requiring precise manipulation of the needles. Only with highly refined force could this be achieved.  

Zhou Qing was still struggling to perform the Crane Needle on himself.  

The needles used for treatment were too fine.  

Pondering this, Zhou Qing had an epiphany.  

Even when condensed, Crane Force retained its properties of enhancing speed and lightness.  

But the needles were too slender, requiring even more concentrated force.  

What if he used a different object?  

"The iron pellets for the 'Flicking Finger Art'?"  

Zhou Qing immediately saw the potential and retrieved the pellets.  

His Flicking Finger Art had already reached the "Skilled" level.  

Originally, improving it required enhancing his physique and strengthening his right hand's power. Now, combining it with Crane Force offered a superior method to boost its potency.  

But his idea needed testing.  

In the courtyard, with Crane Force activated, he flicked an iron pellet at the wall.  

Small dents appeared.  

As he practiced, Zhou Qing grew increasingly adept at integrating condensed Crane Force into the Flicking Finger Art's mechanics.  

*Whoosh!*  

From ten paces away, the pellet struck the iron-clad chest of a wooden training dummy, embedding itself halfway in.  

The power was formidable.  

Zhou Qing studied the result thoughtfully, then glanced at the large, canopy-like mulberry tree in the yard.  

A cool breeze rustled its leaves, making the shadows sway.  

It seemed to be saying, "Stay away."  

Zhou Qing chuckled, then focused on the Health Master.  

The evaluation for the Flicking Finger Art now included an additional note, capturing his attention.  

**Martial Skill: Flicking Finger Art (Limit Break).**  

The Flicking Finger Art, enhanced by Crane Force, had surpassed its limits—a development that greatly surprised Zhou Qing.  

Was "Limit Break" the stage beyond "Skilled"?  

The fusion of the Flicking Finger Art and Crane Force had achieved this breakthrough.  

What astonishing changes would the combination of Tiger Play and Crane Form bring?  

Zhou Qing grew even more eager to find out.  

In contrast, he felt little anticipation for the prefectural academy's enrollment, which the other scholars awaited eagerly.  

He hoped the ceremony the next day would pass quickly so he could return and continue honing the Crane Form Technique.
