# Chapter 124: Reactions from All Sides (Supplementary Update)

Zhou Qing buried the remains of the golden-robed cultivator, the female cultivator surnamed Hu, and the body cultivator surnamed Yuan in the coral forest where the Heavenly Origin Divine Water was hidden. 

He then began mapping out the areas of the Divine Water Palace he had explored, along with its various formations and restrictions. Simultaneously, he scattered spirit herb seeds across the medicinal fields. 

By the time the Divine Water Palace reopened, he would likely have reached the Golden Core stage. However, with the addition of his own fragment of the Black Water Divine Stele, he now possessed a total of seven fragments. 

Through studying these fragments, he might even discover a way to enter the Divine Water Palace ahead of schedule. 

The Black Water Sect and the Black Water Divine Stele—Zhou Qing suspected that the Black Water Sect might have originally been a branch of the Divine Water Palace's lineage, though it had since fully descended into the demonic path.

Additionally, Zhou Qing sent out the little snake to continue exploring, which led to an unexpected discovery: the cultivation method for "Primordial Heavy Water."

This water could be used to nourish one's magical instruments or temper embryonic artifacts. With prolonged use, it might even give birth to rare treasures. However, cultivating Primordial Heavy Water required vast amounts of water-attribute spiritual energy—precisely what Zhou Qing generated while practicing Kidney Water Thunder. 

The Primordial Heavy Water also carried an extreme cold attribute, making it perfect for use with his "Frost Envelops the World" technique. In sufficient quantities, it could even form a domain of extreme cold. 

The method Zhou Qing obtained only covered the first two layers: the first corresponded to Foundation Establishment, while the second required Golden Core cultivation. 

Zhou Qing also possessed the Azure Sun Spiritual Flame. By nurturing both the flame and the Primordial Heavy Water within his Dao Furnace, he wondered if the opposing forces could temper it, leading to further evolution. 

On the seventh day of the Divine Water Palace's opening, Zhou Qing used the Black Water Divine Stele fragment to teleport out. 

His first act upon leaving was to summon Immortal Luo and the others, using his divine sense to erase their memories of his inquiries about the Divine Water Palace. Naturally, they offered no resistance—such memory alterations were simple with cooperation.

**Jiangzhou, Qingfu Palace**  

Recognizing the immense utility of talismans in combat, Zhou Qing planned to establish a specialized course within the Dao Court. 

"Junior Brother intends to select disciples from the five branches with talent for talisman-making and focus their training on it," said Fushan. 

Zhou Qing nodded. "Each discipline requires specialization—not just talismans, but alchemy and formations as well. I've also brought back a considerable amount of spirit grain, which will require those with a talent for spiritual agriculture. However, talismans are the most immediately applicable in combat, so we'll start there. For alchemy and formations, you and Mingyue should first compile introductory texts—these will be mandatory for all disciples." 

Fushan asked, "If each discipline requires specialization, why make alchemy and formations mandatory?" 

Zhou Qing smiled. "One need not master all arts, but ignorance is unacceptable. For now, we'll only add alchemy and formations. As the Dao Court grows, we'll establish foundations in other areas, and our recruitment standards will rise. When the time is right, I'll have Mingyue set up illusion arrays to test the disciples' resolve." 

The Dao Court was still in its infancy; Rome wasn't built in a day. 

Talismans, however, could be standardized starting from the most basic low-tier variants. Zhou Qing taught only two: the Water Sphere Talisman and the Fire Sphere Talisman. 

The Fire Sphere Talisman could use the pelts of firelight beasts as paper, while after experimentation, Zhou Qing found that gold was the best medium for the Water Sphere Talisman—gold and water mutually nourished each other, and the gold could be recycled if damaged. 

Next, Zhou Qing handed Fushan some medicinal herbs from the Divine Water Palace to refine into pills for the disciples. These herbs were potent enough for Foundation Establishment cultivators, so their effects on Body Refining and Qi Refining disciples would be even more pronounced. 

As for Fushan, Zhang Jingxiu, and the others, Zhou Qing would personally refine their pills—he had more than enough to spare. 

Pills had diminishing returns, especially for Zhou Qing; after five doses of the same pill, they became ineffective. 

The Fallen Ridge Market primarily supplied low-tier cultivation resources for the Dao Court's disciples. 

After meeting with Fushan, Zhou Qing sought out Zhang Jingxiu. 

"Giant Spirit Mystic Art?" 

This was the body cultivation technique Zhou Qing had obtained from the cultivator surnamed Yuan, which led beyond the Furnace Realm to the True Body Realm. 

Having recently broken through to the mid-Furnace Realm after demonic seeding, Zhang Jingxiu was tasked with testing the technique and sharing his insights with Xiao Ruowang and Fushan. 

"I've studied this technique—it likely originates from an ancient orthodox Daoist sect in the Jingyang Dao Domain, serving as a guardian art. Those who practice it are essentially protectors of the Dao." 

Zhang Jingxiu laughed. "So I’m your guardian now?" 

He recalled Fushan's *Record of Zhou Zhenren's Path to Dao*, which listed Fushan as Zhou Qing's guardian. 

Zhou Qing smiled. "You’ll need to work hard, Elder Brother. Guarding my path won’t be easy." 

In the Divine Water Palace, Zhou Qing had slain a blood-sacrificed Foundation Establishment cultivator whose power had briefly rivaled a late-Foundation Establishment expert. 

(Of course, the red-faced cultivator had already been severely weakened when Zhou Qing struck. But the result spoke for itself!)

Returning to the Jiangzhou medicinal garden, Zhou Qing gave the female cultivator surnamed Hu's cultivation notes to Yuan Mingyue. The woman had been a formation master, though not a particularly skilled one—she had stumbled upon the inheritance of a predecessor by chance. 

Unfortunately, her talent was limited. 

Zhou Qing now had both Yuan Mingyue and Lin Wan'er reside in the medicinal garden. Lin Wan'er focused on practicing the *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture*, and her occasional zither playing subtly nourished Yuan Mingyue's soul. 

Yuan Mingyue even took up the xiao under Lin Wan'er's tutelage, and the two occasionally performed the *Clear Heart Universal Goodness Chant* together. 

The great mulberry tree, having frequently listened to Lin Wan'er's performances, had grown remarkably serene—almost benevolent—and now produced more mulberry dew. 

Zhou Qing continued using the dew to cleanse his eyes. Though its effects on his Eyes of Truth were diminishing, his physical eyes steadily evolved toward spiritual sight. Perhaps one day, they would fully absorb the Eyes of Truth's power, granting him true spiritual vision—the ability to perceive the world's truths, even the laws of heaven and earth. 

In the following days, Zhou Qing used the Heavenly Origin Divine Water to cultivate Kidney Water Thunder while simultaneously practicing a new divine ability: the Soul Bewitchment Art. 

This was the demonic technique Xu You of the Black Water Sect had used to ensnare the three cultivators. 

Though labeled a demonic art, the Soul Bewitchment Art wasn't entirely sinister—mastery of it passively increased others' goodwill toward the user, much like the dignified bearing of Buddhists or the transcendent aura of Daoists. 

Zhou Qing cultivated it to subtly improve his interactions with other cultivators in the Jingyang Dao Domain. 

Meanwhile, his Primordial Heavy Water cultivation progressed steadily alongside Kidney Water Thunder. He planned to use it to nourish the Green Bamboo Sword, enhancing its power. 

Currently a high-tier magical instrument, the sword might ascend to supreme-tier with prolonged nurturing—or even become a legendary treasure once Zhou Qing reached the Golden Core stage. 

He treated the Green Bamboo Sword as his lifebound artifact. According to ancient texts, an ancient Nascent Soul elder had once refined an ordinary bamboo branch into a world-shaking treasure through endless tempering. 

The quality of a treasure depended on both its materials and the refinement method. Lifebound artifacts also granted their wielders a 30% power boost. 

As for the Longevity Jade Liquid—which increased Golden Core formation chances by half a percent—Zhou Qing set it aside. In terms of value, this might be his greatest harvest from the Divine Water Palace. 

With only five Golden Core elders in the entire Jingyang Dao Domain (including Patriarch Tianxuan), any late-Foundation Establishment cultivator would go mad for such an item. 

A Golden Core elder could easily survive by establishing a cave dwelling in the wild, free from the burdens of protecting human cities—though without mortal foundations, long-term development would be difficult. 

Even the four demonic sects occasionally sought successors from Tianxuan City. 

Patriarch Tianxuan, having once sought guidance from Jingyang Zhenren, remained steadfast in protecting humanity. 

Jingyang Zhenren's words were widely circulated: *"As long as humanity endures, even if we perish, we will return."* 

Many interpreted this as proof of reincarnation—that high-level cultivators might one day reincarnate and reclaim their former glory. 

This was a form of immortality. 

If humanity perished, so too would their chance of return. 

Though some doubted, others, like Patriarch Tianxuan, believed fervently. 

Zhou Qing, having lived two lives, was inclined to believe in reincarnation. He pondered the connection between race and self—did a race's survival facilitate immortality? 

If one could return after death due to their race's endurance, it would be profoundly meaningful. 

After all, who could guarantee immortality? 

Demonic cultivators, however, grew increasingly demonic before reaching Golden Core. 

Fortunately, Lin Wan'er's *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture* could suppress demonic influences. 

As cultivation spread across the mortal realm, more individuals with her "Miaoyin physique" would emerge, reducing the risks of demonic seeding.

After Zhou Qing's departure from the Divine Water Palace, the extinguishing of the life lamps belonging to the cultivators who had entered sent shockwaves through the region. 

The Black Water Sect suffered devastating losses—the red-faced late-Foundation Establishment elder and core disciple Xu You. The latter's death was particularly crippling, as young core disciples held greater potential. 

For demonic sects, elders who failed to break through within a century would either flee or be executed by their sect leader—usually the latter. 

The incident sparked widespread speculation: who could have slain so many Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Divine Water Palace? 

The Black Water Sect, the Blood Demon Sect, and the Jin family of Tianxuan City offered bounties for clues. 

Suspicion eventually fell on the body cultivator surnamed Yuan—rumored to have reached the mid-Furnace Realm—as the only plausible culprit capable of ambushing a late-Foundation Establishment expert. 

Zhou Qing, upon hearing this, used the Thousand Illusions technique to briefly manifest Yuan's appearance in the wild, further cementing the narrative. 

Countless rogue and demonic cultivators mobilized to hunt the "human treasure," but Yuan had vanished without a trace.

**Blood Demon Sect**  

A middle-aged black-robed cultivator gazed at a dark wooden bowl containing a drop of condensed demonic blood, its surface flickering with soulfire. 

The soulfire bore the likeness of the female demonic cultivator Qin Qing. 

The bowl was crafted from soul-nourishing wood—a material said to grow only in extreme Yin lands, akin to the legendary Yellow Springs of the underworld. 

The man was the Blood Demon Sect's leader. "Qing'er, I refuse to believe a mid-Furnace Realm body cultivator killed you. Either the Black Water Sect was involved, or someone else entered the Divine Water Palace." 

Qin Qing was his descendant and most promising disciple, with Golden Core potential. Her unexplained death enraged him. 

The sect had expended immense resources to revive her using True Demon Blood. 

"Lord Sect Leader, investigations show eight stele fragments scattered across the Jingyang Dao Domain. Six were used to enter the Divine Water Palace this time. Of the remaining two, one is lost, and the other belonged to Huang Wenxiang of Tianxuan City's Huang family." 

"Where is Huang Wenxiang now?" 

"Dead. The Huang family was decimated in the last beast tide. Survivors fled—likely to the White Moon Wolf territory, where we cannot pursue." 

The trail had gone cold. 

Unless Qin Qing revived and identified her killer, the truth would remain elusive. 

True Demon Blood rebirth was a forbidden art. If successful, Qin Qing would emerge with ancient demonic bloodline traits, enhancing her demonic cultivation. 

The Blood Demon Sect possessed three drops: one for Qin Qing, one for the sect leader, and one in reserve. 

Their True Demon Blood was a diluted, purified version of the ancient demons' essence, stripped of residual will and repurposed for rebirth. 

While the Black Water Sect inherited a branch of the Divine Water Palace's legacy, the Blood Demon Sect also held fragments of its teachings. 

During the ancient cataclysm, many sects like the Divine Water Palace possessed demonic legacies. Modern body cultivators often descended from these remnants. 

Body cultivators who refined demonic beasts gained bestial traits, aligning with the ancient demonic path. 

However, body cultivators were more prone to demonic corruption due to weaker divine sense—unless they practiced orthodox Daoist mind-cleansing arts. 

Yet their vitality allowed deeper exploitation of demonic power, surpassing demonic cultivators in this regard. 

To the four demonic sects and Patriarch Tianxuan, the most orthodox path was Jingyang Zhenren's. 

"The Dao Furnace!" 

*"Heaven and earth are the furnace; creation is the craftsman. Yin and yang are the charcoal; all beings are the metal!"* 

The Blood Demon Sect leader's eyes shone with longing. Forging a Dao Furnace was merely the beginning of Jingyang Zhenren's path—a path without weakness, growing ever more formidable. 

A primordial spirit rivaling ancient immortals; a body matching primordial demons. 

This was Jingyang Zhenren's ultimate vision. 

The sect leader's master had once studied under Jingyang Zhenren. 

Steeped in these teachings, the sect leader revered Jingyang Zhenren deeply.

**Water Manor**  

"Qingzhi, you think one drop of water can defeat me? I don’t believe it." Fushan, reluctantly dragged into testing Zhou Qing's new technique, scoffed. 

Zhou Qing smiled. "Let’s find out."
