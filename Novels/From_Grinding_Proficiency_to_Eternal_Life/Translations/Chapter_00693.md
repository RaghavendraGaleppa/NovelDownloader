# Chapter 693: If the Benefits Are Great Enough, Even Enemies Can Become Friends

His voice turned cold, like thunder exploding.

"This world's Heavenly Dao is on the verge of death, its origin dissipating. If I do not drag it into my Taihua Spirit Void World to be devoured and fused, then once it completely collapses, the so-called billions of living beings, along with those countless minor thousand worlds, will instantly turn into chaotic dust—not even a trace of a soul will remain.

"My actions are not to cut off their path to life, but to break the inevitable dead end and fight for a slim chance of integration into a new Great World for the beings of this dying realm.

"This is true great merit and virtue. Yet you, Buddhist Sect, under the guise of false compassion, act to obstruct the Way. You merely wish to squeeze out the last bit of faith and desire power before this world completely perishes. It is the height of hypocrisy!"

Xu Yunfan's words struck like daggers, not only refuting Miao Di Bodhisattva's accusations but also using her own methods to expose the Buddhist Sect's hypocrisy.

His gaze swept over Tian Guang Zhenjun, whose expression was shifting unpredictably, and Miao Di Bodhisattva, who had a solemn appearance but coldness in her eyes. Finally, he fixed it on the Aitila World and spoke loudly.

"Tian Guang Daoist, Miao Di is here making a racket simply to disturb your mind, so she can reap the benefits from the sidelines, or perhaps swallow the scraps alone. I will ask you one last time: regarding the merit of this牵引 (traction), will you assist me, or continue to watch from the walls, watching the disciples of your Wansheng Sword Sect who have fought bitterly within the world finally pay for nothing? Or perhaps..."

His tone suddenly turned cold. The Star Spirit Banner shook violently again, pulling the Aitila World even closer. "Do you wish to join forces with this bald donkey to obstruct my affairs?"

The pressure instantly fell upon the Eternal Heavenly Light Zhenjun.

On one side was the aggressive Xu Yunfan, who held the initiative, and the temptation of massive merit right before his eyes. On the other side was the Miao Di Bodhisattva, who preached compassion but watched like a tiger, and the immense interests of his sect within the world.

Before Xu Yunfan's voice had even faded, a secret voice transmission entered Tian Guang Zhenjun's ear.

"Tian Guang, if the牵引 of this world succeeds, I can give you forty percent of the heavenly merit! The West Wild God's Corpse Ore Vein and the North Border Ice Essence Source Eye of the Aitila World shall all belong to your Wansheng Sword Sect. I only want the leadership and the first merit!"

Tian Guang Zhenjun's Dharma Form's eyes flashed slightly. Although he maintained a displeased expression on the surface due to Xu Yunfan's aggressive words, his expression softened upon hearing Xu Yunfan's secret promise.

Of course, maintaining a superficial pretense and a cold demeanor was essential.

Massive merit could wash away the luck lost by the sect due to the fall of Chi Yang, and the West Wild Ore Vein was an urgently needed resource for the North Polar Peak to temper and permanently fix their Sword Core.

Facing the naked benefits and the watchful hypocrisy of the Pure Land of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, the White Gold Glazed Dharma Form suddenly erupted with dazzling light.

"Divine Xiao Daoist, remember your promise!"

Xu Yunfan let out a long laugh. "There is nothing much I am good at, but the one thing I have is keeping my promises."

While others of the Primordial Origin Sect might treat vows and promises as farts to be released casually, as a person, one should have certain bottom lines.

Xu Yunfan naturally would not be limitless in his lack of principles.

"Everlasting Shine, emerge!"

Without the slightest hesitation, the Heavenly Light Seal on Tian Guang Zhenjun's Dharma Form vibrated violently. A ten-thousand-zhang giant sword, forged like black ice glazed pottery, with solidified time and light flowing along its spine, tore through the void.

It was his Lifebound Spirit Treasure, the Everlasting Shine Tribulation Light Sword.

Where the sword tip pointed, the *Heavenly Light Eternal Sword Canon* operated to its extreme.

"High-hanging since ancient times, all laws return to silence!"

The Sword Domain erupted violently.

White Gold Glazed light tides surged outward from the sword tip. Wherever they passed, the chaotic dark light of the World Sea instantly froze, turning into transparent crystals spanning tens of thousands of miles. Even the Buddhist light ripples spread by the Eight Treasures Lotus Platform under Miao Di Bodhisattva's feet were visibly slowed and solidified.

"Bald donkey, have you finished your noise!"

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan let out a fierce shout that rang out simultaneously.

The Ice Desert Form on his right arm formed a seal in mid-air.

"Five Elements Revolve, Yin-Yang Pivot, Divine Thunder Prison—Open!"

The Star Spirit Banner fluttered violently. The projections of the周天 (Heavenly) Stars on the banner surface suddenly collapsed.

Green Wood Birth and Death Thunder, Li Fire Burning World Thunder, Geng Metal Breaking Evil Thunder, Gui Water Sinking Abyss Thunder, and Wu Earth Suppressing Mountain Thunder erupted from the void.

The five-colored thunderbolts did not scatter to attack separately but were forcibly forged by the pure Yang fire power of the Chi Yang Dao Fruit, which was activated by the Angry Form on his left arm. They transformed into a chaotic thunder pillar entwined with Yin-Yang Annihilation Runes, fiercely crashing into the solidified Buddhist light.

"Insolence!"

Miao Di Bodhisattva's solemn expression changed drastically. She truly did not expect that the two who were preparing to fight to the death just a moment ago would join forces to attack her the next.

The Eight Treasures Glazed Pagoda shot into the sky. The Buddhist seal '万' (Ten Thousand) rotated at its base, spewing out limitless Golden Light of Conversion. Additionally, eighty-four thousand Guardian Heavenly Dragon phantoms coiled and roared, forming the Great Brahma Heavenly Dragon Flower Treasure World to forcefully clash with the thunder pillar.

*Boom-crack!!*

The chaotic thunder pillar and the Dragon Flower Buddha World collided.

Annihilation Thunder and Conversion Buddhist Light crazily annihilated each other.

Thunder and Fire shattered hundreds of Heavenly Dragon phantoms, while the Buddhist Light eroded and ground down the Thunder Runes.

However, the Yin-Yang Annihilation power ultimately prevailed, and the Buddha World barrier cracked inch by inch.

"Heavenly Stars, Lock!"

How could Xu Yunfan allow her to catch her breath? He immediately捏 (pinched) a hand seal.

The main banner of the Star Spirit Banner glowed with dark light. Three hundred and sixty-five Star Chains, like venomous dragons emerging from their holes, ignored spatial distance and instantly bound the Glazed Pagoda.

The authority of Great Light within the banner erupted with full force. The holy light burned the Buddhist patterns on the pagoda body in reverse, emitting a sizzling cracking sound.

"Bodhisattva, leave something behind!"

Tian Guang Zhenjun's killing move arrived.

The Everlasting Shine Tribulation Light Sword drew upon all the crystal dark light of the solidified Sword Domain, transforming into a killing sword light that froze the eternal space-time, aiming straight for Miao Di Bodhisattva's glabella.

Where the sword light passed, even the diffusing Buddhist light particles were permanently solidified.

Miao Di Bodhisattva's pupils constricted sharply.

Attacked from front and back, the Star Chain binding the pagoda牵制 (restricted) half her Dharma power, and the Everlasting Shine Sword light had already reached the critical moment of life and death.

She bit her tongue fiercely, spitting out a mouthful of light golden Buddhist blood onto her palm.

"My Buddha is compassionate, I shall sacrifice my body to feed the demons!"

The Buddhist blood ignited a glazed pure fire, instantly burning half the lotus platform.

The immense power of desire transformed into a [Prajna Sumeru Barrier] carved with the Sanskrit of the *Diamond Sutra*, blocking her front.

At the same time, she reversed the origins of the eighty-four thousand demons suppressed within the Eight Treasures Glazed Pagoda at the cost of heavy losses.

"Ten Thousand Demons Burn the Sutra, Reverse!"

The pagoda body shook violently and exploded where the Star Chains were burning.

Countless twisted demon shadows, carrying the backlash of Buddhist power, exploded, forcibly breaking dozens of Star Chains.

Borrowing the chaotic impact generated by the self-destruction of the spirit treasure, Miao Di Bodhisattva's golden body transformed into a dim glazed Buddhist light, forcibly breaking free from the absolute lock of the Everlasting Shine Sword light. She instantly fled into the depths of the World Sea, leaving only a resentful and sorrowful cry echoing in the void.

"This仇 (enmity)... the Pure Land of Bodhisattvas and Buddhas, Miao Di will definitely repay it!"

Xu Yunfan was completely indifferent to such acts of shouting threats while fleeing. The Zhenjuns of the Taihua Spirit Void World不知 (didn't know) where they learned such a temperament; every time they were beaten half to death, they always had to drop a line.

The World Sea returned to deathly silence, leaving only broken lotus petals and Glazed Pagoda fragments floating.

Tian Guang Zhenjun's Dharma Form's light was slightly dim. He withdrew the Everlasting Shine Sword. When he looked at Xu Yunfan, that face, as cold as eternal black ice, actually squeezed out a smile that could be called genial.

"Divine Xiao Daoist's divine might is startling. This joint operation was truly satisfying! For the牵引 of this world, this Daoist shall lend Daoist a helping hand!"

Xu Yunfan sneered in his heart, but a false praise surfaced on his face as well.

"Tian Guang Daoist's 'Eternal' Way is supreme in Taihua. If not for Daoist's Sword Domain trapping that bald donkey's retreat route, how could it have been so smooth? The merit of this world, let us share it together!"
