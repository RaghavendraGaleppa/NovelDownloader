# Volume 2: Stolen Immortal Herb  
Chapter 97: Nine Heavens Profound Technique  

It was a fiery red hook, ancient in design, exuding an alluring spiritual energy that marked it as anything but ordinary. This artifact was renowned throughout Yanzhou's cultivation world—it was none other than the personal protective treasure of Elder Qingling.  

A top-grade spiritual artifact, surpassing even the quality of the Jade Snow Ring, it was said to possess an innate fire attribute, capable of effortlessly unleashing several mid-tier fire-based spells during combat.  

Lin Xuan couldn't put it down, turning the hook over in his hands with admiration before reluctantly storing it in his pouch.  

Aside from spiritual artifacts and spirit stones, the pouch was filled with bottles and jars of various sizes. Opening them revealed some containing elixirs, while others held peculiar materials. Though Lin Xuan didn’t recognize most of them, given Elder Qingling’s status and cultivation, they were undoubtedly valuable treasures. He carefully stored them away.  

After sorting through the Fire Spirit Sect leader’s storage pouch, Lin Xuan retrieved two unexpected treasures from his storage bracelet: a jade slip and an emerald-green jade pendant.  

Curious, he channeled his spiritual sense into the jade slip.  

To his surprise, it contained a cultivation technique. It took him a full hour to peruse the contents. When he withdrew his spiritual sense, his face was alight with joy.  

As was widely known, cultivation was divided into eight stages from the Spirit Movement to the Tribulation Transcendence, each with its corresponding techniques.  

In other words, the Spirit Movement stage had its own technique, the Foundation Establishment stage another, and the Core Formation stage yet another, more advanced one.  

The technique recorded in this jade slip was unique—it spanned three stages of cultivation, divided into upper, middle, and lower volumes.  

The upper volume was for Foundation Establishment, the middle for Core Formation, and the lower for the Nascent Soul stage.  

On the surface, this might not seem extraordinary, but because the technique was a continuous lineage—unlike the fragmented methods most cultivators used—it granted slightly greater power compared to peers at the same stage.  

Take its previous owner, the Nine Heavens Sage, for example. A legendary figure in the cultivation world, he and his wife once turned the entire Zhao Kingdom’s cultivation realm upside down, a testament to the technique’s might.  

Interestingly, the jade slip Lin Xuan held contained only half of the *Nine Heavens Profound Technique*. The other half was in Qin Yan’s possession.  

Of the two shooting stars that had appeared that day, Lin Xuan had obtained one, while the other—the complementary half of the technique—was claimed by the Fairy of the Clouds.  

Yet Lin Xuan felt no regret. The other half was identical in content, covering the same stages from Foundation Establishment to Nascent Soul. The only difference was that his version was for male cultivators, while Qin Yan’s was exclusively for females.  

Setting the jade slip aside, Lin Xuan turned his attention to the jade pendant.  

The pendant was no larger than half a palm, its design ancient. The front was carved with intricate patterns, while the back bore strange symbols resembling archaic script—none of which Lin Xuan recognized. After examining it for a long time, he found nothing extraordinary.  

With a sigh, he set it down, though his expression remained untroubled. The Fire Spirit Sect had believed this treasure could dominate Yanzhou’s cultivation world, and it wasn’t just because of the technique. The *Nine Heavens Profound Technique*, while powerful, was a long-term investment. The true secret lay in the pendant.  

Unfortunately, he had the treasure but couldn’t decipher it.  

No matter. He could study it later. The simplest solution would be to capture a Fire Spirit Sect disciple and force the truth out of them, but Lin Xuan wasn’t that reckless. First, given his current strength, it would be suicidal. Second, the pendant’s secret was likely known only to a few high-ranking members of the sect.  

Lin Xuan harbored no illusions about defeating a Foundation Establishment cultivator—his victory over Elder Qingling had been pure luck.  

Storing the jade slip and pendant in his bracelet, his immediate priority was to find a way to reach Foundation Establishment.  

Three hours later, his spiritual energy was fully replenished. Instead of rushing off, he took another rest to restore his physical condition to its peak.  

Then, he turned his thoughts to Foundation Establishment. Though he had left Piaoyun Valley, his storage bracelet still held tens of thousands of discarded pills. With some effort, he could refine them into high-grade pills.  

He had also gathered Silver Moon Flowers and Firefly Grass—all the necessary materials were now in hand.  

To obtain supreme-grade pills, a second refinement was required. Though the process differed slightly from standard alchemy, it still required a cauldron and sufficiently intense flames.  

The cauldron wasn’t an issue—he had acquired a small one from Yan Tianheng’s belongings. The only missing component was the flame.  

For alchemy, ordinary fire wouldn’t suffice. There were two options: the innate flame, which only Foundation Establishment cultivators could wield, or the earth vein flame—a naturally occurring subterranean fire that matched the innate flame’s intensity.  

The first option was out of reach for Lin Xuan. Though he could barely summon the innate flame using his top-grade spiritual artifact, it wouldn’t last long enough for alchemy.  

The earth vein flame was equally problematic. It could only be accessed at natural volcanoes or through deep excavations—a feat requiring Core Formation-level power—and even then, it required arrays to harness and stabilize the flames. Such an undertaking was beyond a low-level cultivator like him; it was typically the domain of sects.  

That left only one viable path.  

In the mortal world, wealth could buy almost anything. The same held true in the cultivation world—with enough spirit stones, most resources were obtainable.  

Some sects specialized in selling earth vein flames, sealing them into talismans for use. With enough of these talismans, alchemy became feasible.  

Unlike the remote Yanzhou, the Youzhou cultivation realm was far more prosperous, boasting several markets dedicated to cultivation materials.  

Lin Xuan retrieved a jade slip containing information about Youzhou, which he had gathered during his time at Piaoyun Valley. It proved invaluable now.  

After pinpointing his location, he discovered, by sheer coincidence, a market just over two hundred miles away.  

Delighted, he packed his belongings and set off as a streak of light toward his destination.  

An hour later, he landed within the territory of the Hailong Sect.  

In Youzhou, the Hailong Sect ranked as a mid-to-upper-tier faction, slightly stronger than Piaoyun Valley—a testament to the region’s formidable cultivation power.  

This market was operated by the Hailong Sect, though cultivators from other sects and lone practitioners were welcome to set up stalls for a fee.  

A few miles from the market, Lin Xuan scanned the area with his spiritual sense. Finding no one nearby, he took a sip of Red Vine Grass extract and activated a transformation technique, altering his appearance.  

Though he was unknown in Youzhou, he understood the principle of not flaunting wealth. Since he intended to purchase a large number of earth flame talismans for supreme-grade pills, a disguise was necessary to avoid unwanted attention.  

With that, he cast the Wind Riding Spell and headed for the market.  

The Hailong Sect’s market was nestled within a vast valley, protected by simple illusion arrays to keep out mortals.  

Facing what appeared to be a sheer cliff, Lin Xuan extended a finger and traced a line through the air. The space rippled like water, revealing a hidden passageway to another world.  

Stepping inside, Lin Xuan exhaled in awe. This was the true cultivation world.  

Pavilions and towers stood amidst singing birds and fragrant flowers. Before him stretched hundreds of steps—not of stone, but of jade. At their summit lay resplendent structures more magnificent than any imperial palace.  

The entire market was housed within a single, sprawling complex, divided into individual courtyards—each a separate shop.  

Inside, young men and women moved about, though Lin Xuan sensed no cultivation aura from them. They were outer disciples of the Hailong Sect, serving as guides for visiting cultivators.  

Between the courtyards were exquisite gardens filled with rare flora and fauna, their beauty accompanied by ethereal melodies.  

This was no mere market—it was a paradise on earth.
