# Chapter 33: Fifth Level of Qi Condensation

Three storage bags lay before Lu Xu: his own, the one belonging to the Mo Family's Alchemy Elder, and the one from the Black Robe Society's rogue cultivator.

The three individuals who appeared later had no storage bags on them. A storage bag, costing at least three hundred spirit stones, was not something just anyone could afford.

"In the Beggar's Gang, this would make me a three-bag disciple—no, a four-bag disciple! I still have Mo Qingyuan's storage bag too!"

Lu Xu first opened his own storage bag. All the items he had obtained from the dwarf earlier were casually placed inside.

First, two high-grade magical artifacts appeared: a Blazing Fire Hook and a Golden Light Mirror, which had belonged to the two late-stage Qi Condensation experts. Lu Xu tried to infuse his spiritual energy into the Blazing Fire Hook, but the artifact merely flickered faintly on the surface, utterly unresponsive.

"It seems my Fourth Level Qi Condensation cultivation isn't enough to wield these two high-grade magical artifacts. Perhaps I can try when I reach the Sixth Level of Qi Condensation later!"

Although he couldn't wield them, Lu Xu was able to completely erase the spiritual energy imprints on both artifacts using his own spiritual energy. He then branded them with his own mark. After playing with them for a bit, he set them aside.

Next were three more magical artifacts: two mid-grade and one low-grade. Low-grade magical artifacts sold for a dozen to twenty or thirty spirit stones each, while mid-grade ones were around eighty to one hundred twenty spirit stones. These three artifacts combined could barely fetch two hundred spirit stones. They belonged to the three cultivators who appeared later. Lu Xu also found several cloth pouches on the dwarf, containing the spirit stones of those three individuals. However, these three were truly poor; their spirit stones totaled less than eighty. Talismans were also scarce, fewer than ten in all, mostly auxiliary ones like Concealment Talismans and Sound-Insulation Talismans. Their combat and defensive talismans had clearly been exhausted.

"The combined wealth of these three is less than three hundred spirit stones!" Lu Xu couldn't help but shake his head as he tallied the items. However, this was likely the normal wealth of an ordinary cultivator; giants like him were extremely rare.

The main event lay within the other two storage bags.

Lu Xu first opened the storage bag of the Black Robe Society's rogue cultivator. Inside was a pile of miscellaneous items, a few auxiliary talismans, and several cultivation technique manuals. Lu Xu glanced through them; they were all common cultivation methods, utterly worthless. In a corner were a few jade bottles, which, upon opening, contained detoxification and healing pills of little value. Generally, detoxification, healing, and fasting pills were not expensive; some bottles only sold for three to five spirit stones. Most cultivators venturing out or rogue cultivators could afford to carry some.

What was truly valuable were pills that increased cultivation and helped break through bottlenecks. Even at the same grade, pills related to cultivation could be ten, or even a hundred, times more valuable than ordinary pills. Lu Xu didn't find any cultivation-enhancing pills on this rogue cultivator; he assumed they had already been consumed. Besides these, the Black Robe Society rogue cultivator's storage bag also contained two mid-grade magical artifacts and four low-grade magical artifacts, likely plundered from others. There was also a pile of spirit stones, which Lu Xu counted to be over a hundred.

"This Black Robe Society rogue cultivator is quite poor too!" Lu Xu shook his head after looking through everything. This Black Robe Society member's wealth was even less than Mo Qingyuan's, whom he had killed earlier. But this was probably a common trait among rogue cultivators! Rogue cultivators were much like adventurous cultivators; these individuals who constantly lived a dangerous life, "licking blood from a knife's edge," simply didn't have the concept of "saving money." As soon as they got some spirit stones, they would immediately exchange them for items that could increase their cultivation or combat power. For example, the Fire Thunder Pearl and high-grade talismans that this Black Robe Society rogue cultivator used earlier must have cost a considerable amount of spirit stones.

"'Three Yin Art'? This must be a demonic cultivation method?" Lu Xu finally pulled out a cultivation technique from the storage bag. He quickly flipped through it, confirming it was indeed a deviant cultivation method. It was a cultivation method that could lead directly to the Foundation Establishment stage. According to its description, cultivating this art yielded extremely fast progress, even allowing those with poor aptitude to reach late-stage Qi Condensation. However, there was a price for everything. While progress was rapid, this cultivation method had some undeniable hidden dangers. For example, lifespan would drastically decrease; if one couldn't reach Foundation Establishment before sixty years of age, death was certain. Furthermore, the physical body's vital energy and blood would rapidly decay due to erosion by Yin energy, causing practitioners of this art to struggle with even walking in later stages. The difficulty of breaking through the Foundation Establishment bottleneck would also significantly increase.

"The methods that rogue cultivator used didn't seem like he practiced this art. It appears he was also afraid of those hidden dangers!" Lu Xu thought to himself. After reading for a while, he lost interest in this cultivation method. With his "golden finger" (cheat/system), there was no need for him to dabble in such risky paths. However, a secret technique he found after turning the page caught his attention.

"'Blood Plunder Great Method'!" Due to the drawbacks of cultivating the "Three Yin Art" making it very difficult to break through to Foundation Establishment, the creator of the art devised some solutions. The "Blood Plunder Great Method" was a product of that thought process. This secret technique aimed to increase the probability of breaking through Foundation Establishment by strengthening the physical body.

"By plundering the vital blood of others to strengthen oneself, continuously reinforcing the physical body's power and maintaining it at its peak state, thereby increasing the possibility of overcoming the physical body hurdle."

"So, it's a cannibalistic cultivation method?" Lu Xu generally understood the secret technique. Foundation Establishment required overcoming a physical body hurdle; the stronger the body's vital energy and blood, the higher the chance of success. This "Blood Plunder Great Method" was developed specifically for this purpose.

After pondering for a moment, Lu Xu carefully put the "Three Yin Art" away. He then burned all the miscellaneous items and neatly organized the useful ones into various corners of his storage bag.

Having completed all this, Lu Xu turned his gaze to the Mo Family elder's storage bag. "I hope you can give me some surprises!"

Upon opening the storage bag, Lu Xu was immediately thrilled! This Mo Family elder was truly rich! The pile of spirit stones in the storage bag nearly dazzled Lu Xu's eyes. A rough count revealed over a thousand pieces! He was even more delighted to find two spirit stones, about the size of walnuts, with noticeably purer spiritual energy within them.

"These are mid-grade spirit stones!" A single mid-grade spirit stone was equivalent to one hundred low-grade spirit stones.

"Excellent, excellent! Even mid-grade spirit stones! Truly worthy of a Mo Family elder!" Lu Xu's face was beaming as he looked at the pile of spirit stones.

More surprises were to come. Mo Changkong's storage bag also contained over a dozen bottles and jars.

"Cooling Pills? So-so! Fasting Pills? So-so! Limb-Reattachment Pills? Oh, these are healing pills for reattaching limbs, quite good! Qi Nurturing Pills! Qi Nurturing Pills! Qi Nurturing Pills!"

Lu Xu's smile grew wider and wider. He had found a staggering six bottles of Qi Nurturing Pills in Mo Changkong's storage bag!

"Excellent! Mo Changkong, I truly didn't misjudge you!" Lu Xu recalled what the elder had said when he tried to recruit him as a son-in-law, mentioning his skill in refining Qi Nurturing Pills. Now, it was clear his words were not empty.

A bottle of Qi Nurturing Pills could sell for one hundred fifty spirit stones; countless mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators might never be able to afford even one bottle in their lifetime. Lu Xu's former neighbor, Leng Quan, had painstakingly toiled for several years at the Fourth Level of Qi Condensation, fighting through life and death to save enough spirit stones to buy just one bottle of Qi Nurturing Pills. And now, Lu Xu had effortlessly obtained six bottles. The twists of fate in life were truly worlds apart.

"Alchemy furnace, spiritual herbs... this fellow carried a complete set of alchemy equipment!"

After his gaze moved from the jade bottles, Lu Xu looked at the other items in the storage bag. There were over a hundred jade and wooden boxes in total. Lu Xu opened each one, and inside, a spiritual herb lay quietly. Over a hundred spiritual herbs!

"These are for refining Qi Nurturing Pills, these for Limb-Reattachment Pills, and these for Beauty-Enhancing Pills..." Lu Xu had, after all, copied Mo Changkong's alchemy experience, so he recognized the purpose of these spiritual herbs at a glance. Limb-Reattachment Pills were excellent for healing, and Beauty-Enhancing Pills could preserve one's appearance and slow down aging. Lu Xu had copied the formulas for both types of pills from Mo Changkong. He had obtained over a dozen different pill formulas from Mo Changkong's experience, all of which Mo Changkong had previously refined.

"Ten sets of materials for Qi Nurturing Pills, two sets for Limb-Reattachment Pills, and five sets for Beauty-Enhancing Pills!"

"What was that old geezer preparing so many Beauty-Enhancing Pill materials for? His old face certainly doesn't need them!" Lu Xu muttered to himself. After careful inspection, he meticulously stored these jade boxes. Once he found an earth fire, he could try his hand at alchemy.

After inventorying all his gains, Lu Xu destroyed the temporary cave dwelling and then rode his magical artifact into the distance.

Half a month later.

Above the capital city of Wei, Lu Xu stood on his Azure Blade and arrived at the location. The capital of Wei was the largest city in Wei State, reportedly home to over five million residents. Standing high in the sky, Lu Xu looked down at the bustling crowds and carriages, a nostalgic look flashing in his eyes. He recalled how, in his mortal days as a Jianghu wanderer, his greatest wish was to visit this capital city and witness the heroes of the world. Now, he had finally arrived, but as a cultivator.

"Whoosh! Whoosh!"

In the distance, streaks of light rapidly swept past, flying towards the majestic mountains behind the capital. The number of cultivators here was immense!

The capital of Wei was built at the foot of a mountain range, with the grand mountains at its back and a vast plain stretching out before it. Looking down from high above, one could see countless farmers diligently toiling on the expansive plain. These were ordinary mortals, but their labor reminded Lu Xu of his past life as a spirit farmer.

Now, he had completely broken free from the Mo Family and no longer needed to be a spirit farmer. The spirit stones and pills he possessed would allow Lu Xu to cultivate steadily for a long time. Therefore, he temporarily set aside the thought of earning spirit stones, only wishing to find a place with abundant spiritual energy to cultivate in peace.

Lu Xu turned his gaze towards the vast mountain range behind the capital of Wei. Inside the mountains and outside were two different worlds. This mountain range was called Tianmen Mountain, and deep within it lay a Tier 3 spirit vein, around which Tianmen City was built.

Tianmen City was an immortal city, home to over ten thousand cultivators, making it one of the most prosperous places in the Wei State cultivation world. Interestingly, the owner of Tianmen City was also the ruler of the capital city at the foot of the mountain: the Emperor of Wei! The Imperial Wei Family was a crucial power in the Wei State cultivation world, ranking second among the nine major forces, surpassed only by the paramount power, Qianjue Sect. The strength of this clan far surpassed that of ordinary Foundation Establishment families like the Mo Family. Their controlled Tianmen City was also the most friendly place for rogue cultivators in Wei State; over sixty percent of the cultivators in this immortal city were rogue cultivators. It could be said that any rogue cultivator in Wei State desired to live here.

Lu Xu was no exception; after leaving Qinghu Market, he flew directly towards this place. Standing high in the sky, after observing the mortal city below, Lu Xu transformed into a streak of light and flew deep into the Tianmen Mountain range. Before long, he noticed thick mists appearing between the peaks ahead, enveloping the entire area. Lu Xu knew this was a formation to deter mortals; it seemed Tianmen City was close. This kind of formation was low-level and would not hinder cultivators. Lu Xu plunged into it, and after passing through layers of mist, his vision suddenly cleared.

Ahead, a wide valley appeared between the mountains. The valley was vast, covered in green grass and vibrant flowers, with white deer roaming within. Looking upwards, cascading waterfalls plunged down from the cliffs, sending up fine mists. Immortal cranes flew by, carrying cultivators upon their backs. This place was truly a scene of an immortal holy land.

Lu Xu looked towards the center of the valley, where a stone-built city appeared before his eyes. The city was not very large, appearing to be only seven or eight li in length and width, but a glance revealed its abundant spiritual energy. Lu Xu flew towards the immortal city. As he approached, a terrifying pressure suddenly descended from above, preventing him from continuing to fly. Lu Xu knew this must be an anti-flight formation. He quickly put away his magical artifact and landed on the ground, walking forward.

Soon, he arrived at the city gate, guarded by two Third Level Qi Condensation cultivators. One of them, after glancing at Lu Xu's hands, came forward with a smile: "Fellow Daoist, is this your first time in Tianmen City?"

"Indeed. Are there any rules for entering this city?" Lu Xu nodded and asked.

"There are no particular rules for entering the city, as long as you do not casually engage in combat once inside. City guards will patrol during the day!"

"You may stay in this immortal city for ten days. After ten days, you must leave!"

"What if I want to reside here long-term?" Lu Xu inquired.

"For long-term residence, you'll need to complete the procedures and pay an entrance fee of three spirit stones. This will allow you to stay in the city for ten years!"

Three spirit stones were not much. After paying the spirit stones, the cultivator at the gate gave Lu Xu a white thumb ring, telling him to wear it when entering and exiting the city in the future. Lu Xu noticed that the cultivators entering and exiting indeed wore similar thumb rings on their fingers.

Lu Xu put on the thumb ring and walked into the city. As soon as he stepped inside, several mortals who had been waiting by the gate rushed over, clamoring to introduce themselves:

"This humble one greets Immortal Master, may I ask if this is Immortal Master's first time in Tianmen City? Do you need a guide? This humble one is familiar with all the shops in Tianmen City!"

"This humble one is well-versed in the rental situation of residences in the city. Does Immortal Master need to rent a dwelling?"

"Indeed, upon arriving in this city, I certainly need to rent a suitable residence!" Lu Xu thought to himself. So, he pointed at the mortal who claimed to be well-versed in housing rentals and said, "You. Take me to the place where I can rent a house!"

"Thank you, Immortal Master, thank you, Immortal Master! Please follow this humble one!" The young mortal boy was overjoyed and quickly led Lu Xu deeper into the city. The other unchosen mortals dejectedly returned to the city gate to wait for customers.

"I need to rent a dwelling with abundant spiritual energy and the ability to draw in earth fire," Lu Xu stated his requirements.

The mortal pondered for a moment, then immediately cupped his hands and said, "Immortal Master, please rest assured. This humble one happens to know of such a courtyard. The spiritual energy at that courtyard's location is equivalent to a high-grade Tier 1 spirit vein, and it even has a dedicated earth fire room!"

"However, regarding the spirit stones..." The young mortal boy showed a hesitant expression.

"Oh, how many spirit stones per year?"

"That courtyard belongs to the Wei Family. The rent is thirty spirit stones per year. If you truly wish to rent it, you must rent for at least five years and pay a deposit of thirty spirit stones!"

"Pay one, deposit one? That's quite reasonable!" Lu Xu thought. He nodded and instructed, "Take me to see it!"

Soon after, Lu Xu paid sixty spirit stones to the Wei Family and moved into a detached courtyard.

After observing the courtyard, Lu Xu had to admit that the thirty spirit stones annual rent were well spent. The spiritual energy here, equivalent to a high-grade Tier 1 spirit vein, far surpassed Red Maple Alley where he used to live. The spiritual energy in Red Maple Alley might have barely reached the standard of a low-grade Tier 1 spirit vein.

Besides the spiritual energy, the most crucial thing was the earth fire room. With the earth fire room, Lu Xu could finally refine pills.

"However, there's no need to rush with alchemy. I'll focus on improving my cultivation first. I'll enter seclusion for the next few years."

After some consideration, Lu Xu called the mortal boy again and had him take him on a tour of the city to get a better understanding of the immortal city. He also bought several hundred catties of spirit rice and over a hundred catties of spirit beast meat, moving them all to his courtyard.

After giving the mortal boy a bowl of spirit rice and sending him away, Lu Xu closed his door, preparing for a long period of seclusion.

Arriving at the cultivation chamber in his new residence, Lu Xu nodded with satisfaction, feeling the rich spiritual energy surrounding him. He took out a bottle of Qi Nurturing Pills from his storage bag, tilted his head back, swallowed one pill, and began to cultivate diligently.

Qi Nurturing Pills were the most suitable pills for mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators to advance their spiritual energy. Each pill was worth fifteen spirit stones. Consuming such pills could significantly shorten the time required for cultivation. Those mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators who aspired to Foundation Establishment would try every means to purchase and consume these pills. If one didn't use pills for assistance, even a mid-to-high grade spiritual root would likely struggle to reach Qi Condensation Grand Completion before sixty years of age.

The difficulty of Qi Condensation cultivation, once one entered the mid-stage from the early stage, immediately increased by a significant margin. For example, individuals with extremely poor spiritual roots like Old Xu and He Qing would take about thirty to forty years just to cultivate to the Fourth Level of Qi Condensation. And from the Fourth to the Sixth Level, it was even harder, requiring at least a hundred years. This meant that, barring accidents, cultivators with their grade of spiritual roots could never hope to reach the Sixth Level of Qi Condensation in their lifetime.

Lu Xu's mid-to-low grade spiritual root was much better than theirs, so his speed was naturally much faster. But even so, from the Fourth to the Fifth Level, without relying on pills and solely on the spiritual energy in this courtyard, it would still take him five or six years. Fortunately, after inheriting the Mo Family elder's legacy, he was no longer short on pills.

Thus, with continuous consumption of pills, Lu Xu's cultivation rapidly increased.

Two years passed in a flash.

On this day, in the cultivation chamber, Lu Xu suddenly stood up, and a powerful aura burst forth from his entire body.

"Fifth Level of Qi Condensation!"

Lu Xu abruptly opened his eyes, two beams of azure light flashing within them. He let out a light breath, looking inward at his body, seeing a thumb-sized azure energy mass rotating and floating in his dantian.
