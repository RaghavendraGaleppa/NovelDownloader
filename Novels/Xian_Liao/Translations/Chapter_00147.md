# Chapter 147: Subhuti Advances, Divine Fire Refines True Body

Qingfu Palace.

Zhou Qing and Fusong were discussing the Longevity Immortal Pill.

"The spiritual dew from a Heaven and Earth Spiritual Root, the Natal Primordial Qi of a fire-attributed great demon, fused with the Three Lights Divine Water, plus eighty-one types of Core Formation level spiritual herbs, all refined for forty-nine years with Samadhi True Fire — only then can it be successfully completed."

This was the immortal pill recipe for an ancient Longevity Immortal Pill, derived by Fusong from ancient texts in Tianxuan City and the Mortal Realm, along with various alchemical knowledge. It was also the most feasible solution.

Currently, Zhou Qing possessed the spiritual dew from the Great Mulberry Tree. The Natal Primordial Qi of a fire-attributed great demon could be obtained once Subhuti advanced. As for the Three Lights Divine Water, it was rumored to be found deep within the Divine Water Palace. Regarding Core Formation level spiritual herbs, if they could re-enter the Divine Water Palace, they would certainly find them.

The last time Zhou Qing opened up only a medicinal garden for Foundation Establishment level spiritual herbs. The Divine Water Palace surely contained medicinal gardens for Core Formation level spiritual herbs as well. After all, ancient records in the Jingyang Dao Domain stated that the Divine Water Palace was renowned several millennia ago, always suppressed by Nascent Soul cultivators, and at its peak even boasted terrifying Late Nascent Soul existences.

Legend had it that the vast Jingyang Water Domain, spanning tens of thousands of li, was gradually carved out by generations of Divine Water Palace cultivators practicing the True Water Divine Art. Unfortunately, despite its power, the Divine Water Palace still perished in a Heaven and Earth Great Tribulation.

Regarding the Heaven and Earth Great Tribulation, the records in the Jingyang Dao Domain were vague. However, they all implied that these tribulations were curses borne by the human race. Once the human race in the Southern Barrens began to flourish, at a certain juncture, a tribulation would descend. Sometimes it was internal strife, sometimes external pressure, varying in form.

When the human race rose, it was, in another sense, a tribulation for the various non-human entities like demons, devils, and ghosts in the Southern Barrens. During the era of human rise, the Yellow Springs Ghost Realm also appeared, which was the origin of Spirit Cultivators. The legends of the cycle of reincarnation precisely spread from the Yellow Springs Ghost Realm. Moreover, there were not a few rumors of Spirit Cultivators successfully reincarnating with their memories intact.

As for the Samadhi True Fire, Zhou Qing was now only missing the final Fire in Stone to complete its refinement. This required a land of extreme Yin and Earthly Fiend. This matter would eventually come to light.

"The plan Senior Brother proposed is indeed the most feasible. With such demanding conditions, this Longevity Immortal Pill might even have longevity-extending effects for Nascent Soul level existences."

For human cultivators, a longer lifespan meant a more profound foundation, which was of great help for breakthroughs from the Core Formation to Nascent Soul stages. If this Longevity Immortal Pill could be successfully refined, even Zhou Qing himself would benefit immensely.

"These matters require long-term preparation, so there's no need to rush. However, Subhuti should attempt to advance now. Once Subhuti advances, not only will it fulfill some of the conditions for the Longevity Immortal Pill, but I can also cultivate the Yin-Yang Divine Light through Subhuti and Bright Moon. Furthermore, if Subhuti successfully advances, its Natal Divine Fire should be able to assist Dao Brother Zhang in breaking through to the True Body realm."

Zhou Qing calculated the chain reaction brought about by Subhuti's advancement.

Zhang Jingxiu cultivated the Giant Spirit Profound Art, but he also practiced the Fire Trigram left by True Person Jingyang. His cultivation with the wood-elemental essence of the Great Pine Tree made his fire attribute extremely fervent. Using Subhuti's Natal Flames to temper his physique would definitely help him break through bottlenecks. Moreover, Zhou Qing had already prepared Jade Liquid Reversion Pills for them.

Yuan Mingyue was cultivating in the Water Mansion, aided by the Foundation Establishment level pills refined by Zhou Qing, and was now at the Mid Foundation Establishment stage. Zhou Qing had originally planned to extract her Profound Nether Qi only after she reached Peak Foundation Establishment. Now, it seemed that after Subhuti advanced, they could try cultivating the Yin-Yang Divine Light earlier. Once the Yin-Yang Divine Light was formed, he would have another trump card.

If all went smoothly, besides himself, the Dao Court would have three Core Formation level existences: the Great Mulberry Tree, Subhuti, and Zhang Jingxiu. The Great Mulberry Tree was currently only five zhang tall; Zhou Qing's inner world could accommodate it for transport. In actual combat, using the Great Mulberry Tree to complement his Golden Core Domain would likely affect even Late Core Formation cultivators. With Subhuti and Zhang Jingxiu assisting, and also Golden Light, their group would be equivalent to five Core Formation level beings. Especially Zhou Qing, who was no weaker than a Mid Core Formation cultivator. Their combined strength would be comparable to when Old Ancestor Tianxuan was alive.

In fact, with five Core Formation level existences cooperating, even if the Four Great Demonic Sects combined their strength, they could contend with them. The crucial point was that while the sect masters of the Four Great Demonic Sects were all Mid Core Formation level, they would never truly unite. Qin Fang, the Blood Demonic Sect Master, had even backstabbed Meng Xuan, the Blackwater Sect Master, and was an ally of Zhou Qing and Golden Light.

Considering this, Zhou Qing's base was their Dao Court's four Core Formation cultivators, plus Golden Light as a firm ally, and Qin Fang as a slightly wavering ally. As long as Zhou Qing and their strength was displayed, Qin Fang would certainly not waver. A unified front could definitely be achieved. If six Core Formation level existences were united, they would completely surpass any other force in the Jingyang Dao Domain.

After all, the demon race itself was not a monolithic entity. The White Moon Demonic Race alone couldn't produce six Core Formation level great demons. While White Moon was Late Core Formation, as far as Zhou Qing knew, apart from himself, the White Moon Wolf Clan currently had only one Mid Core Formation great demon and two Early Core Formation great demons. While this strength certainly dominated the demon race in the Jingyang Dao Domain, it was only by relying on the threat of the Roaring Moon Old Monster that they could become the overlords of the demon race. According to Old Ancestor Tianxuan, the Roaring Moon Old Monster still had nearly a hundred years before it could break free.

During these hundred years, as Zhou Qing developed, first, the Longevity Immortal Pill might succeed. Second, Zhou Qing might have a chance to cultivate to Golden Core Third Revolution. With various trump cards, contending with Nascent Soul level existences would not be without a chance of victory.

After all, Zhou Qing's foundation and strength were considerably stronger than those of his peers. While there was a huge gap between Core Formation and Nascent Soul, after reaching Golden Core Third Revolution, Zhou Qing might not be without a chance to contend with an opponent a whole major realm above him. If he reached Golden Core Third Revolution and completed the Yin-Yang Divine Light, it might even be possible to transcend realms and kill the Roaring Moon Old Monster.

…

…

Upon returning to the Jingyang Dao Domain, Zhou Qing received news from Meng Xuan of the Blackwater Sect.

"Wants to set a trap to lure and kill a great demon?"

Zhou Qing read the letter and sneered. Demonic cultivators were fickle. Even if they truly set a trap, if they fell into a disadvantage, who knew what they would do then. However, Zhou Qing did not flatly refuse. After all, Blackwater Palace was desperate now. If Zhou Qing didn't help, under the immense pressure from the demon race, Meng Xuan might very well betray them to ensure the Blackwater Sect's survival.

There were still five years until the next beast tide, and fifteen years until the one after that. Zhou Qing wrote a reply, agreeing to cooperate with the Blackwater Sect, but only after fifteen years, as he needed to go into seclusion for another fifteen years to bring his various divine abilities and magical artifacts to a satisfactory stage.

This also conformed to the common sense of the cultivation world in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Generally, after Core Formation, the first twenty years were spent focusing on perfecting one's divine abilities, spells, and magical artifacts, thereby solidifying the Core Formation foundation. In short, he used a delaying tactic. Fifteen years would be enough time for his plan to be completed.

Moreover, Zhou Qing also demanded the last fragment of the Blackwater Divine Stele. But Meng Xuan's reply did not agree. He was also someone who wouldn't release the hawk without seeing the rabbit. However, he did believe Zhou Qing's explanation. It was indeed unrealistic to trick someone who had just entered Core Formation within their first twenty years out to explore ruins or similar.

While White Moon and others didn't fully trust Meng Xuan's sincerity in surrendering, they also knew that it was indeed unrealistic to trick Zhou Qing out in the next decade or so. At the same time, they would use this period to further ascertain the true situation of Old Ancestor Tianxuan. If they could confirm that Old Ancestor Tianxuan could no longer act, or had already passed away, they would use thunderous means to first destroy Falling Feather Ridge and Tianxuan City, leading to the demise of Zhou Qing and Golden Light. Once the demonic sects lost their preserved mortal foundation like Tianxuan City, they would eventually self-destruct even without the demon race's intervention.

White Moon also intended to use this opportunity to further divide and dismantle the Four Great Demonic Sects. Previously, with Old Ancestor Tianxuan present, the demon race couldn't unilaterally annihilate the Four Great Demonic Sects, because if they made a move, Old Ancestor Tianxuan wouldn't stand idly by. The Four Great Demonic Sects would also unite. Unless a Late Core Formation great demon was willing to self-detonate. But having cultivated to such a level, who would be willing to self-detonate to benefit other demons?

This was also why the Demon Race Alliance, despite having forty to fifty Core Formation great demons, including five Late Core Formation great demons, still couldn't eliminate Tianxuan City. White Moon racked its brains but only managed to unite the Ink蛟 King and the Profound Eagle King, two Late Core Formation great demons. And in real danger, White Moon believed that the Ink蛟 King and Profound Eagle King would certainly flee. As for the remaining two Late Core Formation demon kings, they would at most be willing to exert some effort during a beast tide to intimidate the human race. They knew the terror of the human race's rise, and they also knew that the White Moon Wolf Clan was not good news either. Although they were all demon races, their species were entirely different. If not for the hatred for humans ingrained in their bloodline, coupled with the influence of the beast tides, it would have been impossible to form a demon race alliance dominated by the White Moon Wolf Clan. Of course, this was also due to the Roaring Moon Old Monster being the only peerless great demon in the Jingyang Dao Domain. The Roaring Moon Old Monster's deterrent power was simply too great.

In contrast, the human race's cohesiveness was indeed much stronger than that of the demon race. In fact, if Old Ancestor Tianxuan had possessed his current strength three hundred years after True Person Jingyang's disappearance, he could have preserved more of the human race's vitality amidst the demon beast assaults. But Old Ancestor Tianxuan only broke through to Late Core Formation a little over a hundred years ago, by which time it was too late. However, during the beast tide offensives, the demonic path also rose, leading to the Four Great Demonic Sect Masters becoming rising stars.

Both the righteous and demonic paths of the human race, and the internal factions of the demon race, all had their own schemes. But Zhou Qing saw through the fog, knowing that vertical and horizontal alliances were merely superficial means. To truly establish oneself, one had to rely on hard power. Once Subhuti and Zhang Jingxiu successfully advanced, and he also cultivated the Yin-Yang Divine Light, his overall momentum would naturally accumulate. Everything else was illusory.

Zhou Qing temporarily stabilized the Blackwater Sect and the demon race by using the pretext of cultivating divine abilities and dao arts. These fifteen years were extremely precious. Moreover, the demon race might not wait for fifteen years, but Subhuti's advancement wouldn't take that long either. Every moment he could delay, Zhou Qing's advantage would increase. The worst-case scenario, of course, was to abandon Tianxuan City and Falling Feather Ridge. This was the contingency plan.

…

…

"Subhuti, the Great Mulberry Tree has already gone through a lightning tribulation and become a great demon," Zhou Qing said languidly to Subhuti in the Mortal Realm.

Subhuti trembled slightly under the tiger king's gaze.

At that moment, a Jade Liquid Reversion Pill was tossed before Subhuti. Subhuti knew it was a good thing and swallowed it directly. This was deep in the Western Mountains, next to Qingfu Palace, at the location of Subhuti's previous life's divine temple. Zhou Qing pondered over it, and decided this was the best place for Subhuti to advance to a great demon.

The two temple guardians were temporarily isolated by Zhou Qing. A great demon's advancement would surely cause a huge stir. The two temple guardians were both seventy or eighty years old; who knew what might go wrong.

The medicinal power of the Jade Liquid Reversion Pill was quickly activated by Subhuti. It spread its wings, and golden, sun-like flames erupted all over its body. Within the flames, the divine temple itself began to burn fiercely. The ground beneath Subhuti's feet gradually melted, turning into lava. A great sun floated in the depths of the mountain. The scorching heat made even Zhou Qing feel somewhat unaccustomed. Zhang Jingxiu also came along to observe Subhuti's advancement, trying his best to circulate his cultivation to resist.

While Zhou Qing felt a little uncomfortable, his robes fluttered gracefully, giving him the appearance of an immortal. In terms of demeanor, he truly surpassed Zhang Jingxiu. There was nothing to be done, for he possessed the Five Elements True Body. As long as fire-attribute cultivation techniques didn't reach the extreme limits his physical body could endure, they would naturally be transformed by him, preventing harm to his body.

Subhuti let out a proud cry, hovering in mid-air. Its form resembled a Golden Crow, yet also a Vermilion Bird, and even possessed the sacred, noble essence of a Phoenix. Zhou Qing mused that perhaps these were all the previous lives Subhuti had experienced. Each life was an extraordinary divine bird, and in this life, it began to combine the characteristics of all previous lives, transforming towards a more extraordinary existence? Starting its evolution from a great rooster?

Zhou Qing secretly pondered, and another new speculation popped into his mind: Could Subhuti be an experimental subject of some ancient grand cultivators, having inherited the bloodlines of various divine birds?

The sacred aura on Subhuti's body grew denser. The flames on its body deepened in color, subtly mixing with purple and blue.

"Southern Brightness Separation Fire?"

Zhou Qing felt the surrounding heat beginning to recede, but Subhuti's aura became increasingly domineering, yet also somewhat restrained. The Southern Brightness Separation Fire was renowned, incredibly effective against demonic and evil paths. Zhou Qing also cultivated the Divine Sword Lightning Control True Art. Once Subhuti successfully advanced, one man and one chicken could very well challenge and defeat the sect masters of the Four Great Demonic Sects. Their innate suppression of demonic and ghostly paths was simply too great!

Subhuti externally refined Solar True Fire and internally refined Southern Brightness Separation Fire, its momentum continuously climbing. It became increasingly spirited. Limitless spiritual energy converged towards the divine temple. Fortunately, the previous tribulation of the Great Mulberry Tree had significantly enriched the spiritual energy in Jiangzhou. Subhuti's advancement this time benefited from the abundant spiritual energy from the Great Mulberry Tree's earlier tribulation.

In the sky, a Core Formation phenomenon gradually appeared. Vermilion vortex clouds emerged, releasing terrifying great demon aura.

If this were in the Jingyang Dao Domain, it would surely cause a huge commotion. The great demon aura from the vermilion clouds continuously spread out, expanding further.

The disciples of the Dao Court naturally saw this phenomenon.

"Everyone, do not panic, this is True Person Zhou's spirit beast undergoing Core Formation," Xiao Ruowang transmitted, maintaining order.

But as soon as his voice came out, the Dao Court disciples exploded into an uproar. It truly was a case of "when one person achieves enlightenment, even their chickens and dogs ascend to heaven." True Person Zhou's spirit beast not only had the chance to go with him to the Immortal Realm, but it was now actually undergoing Core Formation. A Core Formation great demon! That was an existence on par with a Core Formation Old Ancestor.

"Alas, fellow daoist, in my next life, I wish to be a dog."

"Why?"

"I want to follow True Person Zhou."

"Uh."

Some disciples fell into a daze. But these words were quite hurtful, for they were not even as good as a chicken! Soon, some disciples consoled themselves, "Elder Fusong is so powerful, and he hasn't reached Core Formation yet!" They couldn't compare to Subhuti, and Elder Fusong couldn't either, so their minds immediately felt much more balanced.

…

…

On the fifth day of Subhuti's Core Formation phenomenon, its momentum began to slowly wane. Zhou Qing thought to himself, "It seems Subhuti's foundation is not as strong as mine. At this rate, it will probably conclude on the seventh day." Zhou Qing knew that his own nine-day Core Formation phenomenon was legendary even in the Jingyang Dao Domain, capable of being hailed as the foundation for ascension to immortality. His many years of cultivation and suffering had not been in vain.

Seeing Subhuti's momentum decline, Zhou Qing said, "Dao Brother Zhang, if you don't forge your True Body today, when will you?"

Zhang Jingxiu understood. He leaped to the divine fire where Subhuti was advancing. His body erupted with qi and blood, and he swallowed a Jade Liquid Reversion Pill. At the same time, the Great Pine Tree, which he had merged with his demonic cultivation, manifested. With the wood-attribute essence of the Great Pine Tree assisting, Subhuti's somewhat listless aura seemed to have taken a powerful tonic, and its Solar Divine Fire burned fiercely once more. The Core Formation phenomenon of the great demon surged again.

Zhou Qing, having started with the Five Elements, had long anticipated this step. This was precisely to allow wood to generate fire, which would also help Zhang Jingxiu further refine the essence of the Great Pine Tree and make Subhuti's flames even more powerful. Zhang Jingxiu displayed the Giant Spirit Profound Art, appearing like a giant chasing the sun. Subhuti, stimulated by Zhang Jingxiu's Core Formation aura, became wilder. The trace of purple and blue in its Southern Brightness Separation Fire became increasingly rich and pure. Zhang Jingxiu's flesh and blood also began to transform, advancing towards the True Body realm.

…

…

The celestial phenomenon triggered by Zhang Jingxiu's True Body transformation merged with Subhuti's Core Formation phenomenon. Looked at from afar, it resembled a giant chasing a great sun. "Kuafu chasing the sun?" a thought popped into Zhou Qing's mind. The Giant Spirit Profound Art inherently had a touch of the Mimicking Heaven and Earth ability. Kuafu was a giant in myths. Indeed, it could roughly be linked.

One was a great demon, the other a True Body. Both advancing simultaneously. This was an unprecedented event, even in the records of the Jingyang Dao Domain.

…

…

"It's Master's aura!" Xiao Ruowang was naturally very familiar with Zhang Jingxiu's aura. "Master has advanced to True Body!" Xiao Ruowang was overjoyed. The disciples, who hadn't yet calmed down from Subhuti's advancement to a Core Formation great demon, received another explosive piece of news. Zhang Jingxiu, Chief Zhang, had advanced to True Body! That was a body cultivation realm comparable to a Core Formation Old Ancestor.

…

…

Subhuti's Core Formation phenomenon subsided on the eighth day, while Zhang Jingxiu's True Body phenomenon ended one day after Subhuti's divine fire subsided. All in all, Zhang Jingxiu's phenomenon lasted four days, which was a notch stronger than Golden Light's.

Zhou Qing sensed the True Body aura from Zhang Jingxiu. Under the observation of his Delusion-Breaking Divine Eye, Zhang Jingxiu's Giant Spirit True Body surged with qi and blood. Aside from the vast power brought by the Giant Spirit True Body, there was also the enhancement of the Great Pine Tree as his natal demonic god, and the condensation of Blood-Burning True Fire.

"Congratulations, Dao Brother, your path to longevity has advanced another step!" Zhou Qing congratulated. He casually pointed to the soil, using Earth-elemental magic to rebuild a divine temple. Since the two temple guardians refused to leave the temple, they could continue to guard it. Everyone had their own aspirations, and one should not force them.

The appearance of two Core Formation level assistants was a great boon for Zhou Qing. Zhang Jingxiu naturally thanked Zhou Qing, then went to see Xiao Ruowang and Fusong, before impatiently urging Zhou Qing to let him return to Falling Feather Ridge in the Jingyang Dao Domain. His excuse was that the Great Pine Tree's vitality was greatly wounded by this True Body transformation and needed to quickly return to Falling Feather Ridge to replenish spiritual energy.

…

…

Falling Feather Ridge.

"Actually, the True Body is nothing to boast about," Zhang Jingxiu calmly told Fusong. But the spiritual pressure released by his True Body forced Fusong back a few steps.

"Dao Friend Fusong, I apologize. I just refined my True Body and can't control my spiritual pressure and qi and blood. Please forgive me." Zhang Jingxiu immediately apologized, then ran back to the cave dwelling he had carved out in the core spiritual脉 of Falling Feather Ridge to go into seclusion.

Fusong hadn't even had a chance to curse him out, and Zhang Jingxiu had already disappeared. The True Body was indeed remarkable, running so fast! Fusong muttered enviously.

Immortal Granny Luo and others didn't know what had happened, but they noticed a powerful spiritual pressure and terrifying qi and blood flash by, and hurriedly came to investigate.

"Senior Matsuyama, what happened?"

Fusong tidied his clothes and went out, saying calmly, "Nothing, just that my Dao Friend Zhang has broken through to True Body."

"Oh, oh." Immortal Granny Luo and the others first nodded, then reacted. She showed an incredulous expression, stuttering, "True... Body..."

Fusong nodded, "It's nothing to be surprised about; it's a natural progression. The path of cultivation lies in upholding one's original intention and firming one's resolve. I already explained this during my last sermon. You should not concern yourselves with Dao Friend Zhang's breakthrough to True Body, or it will easily affect you. I need to go out for a while. You should not disturb Dao Friend Zhang; he has just broken through and needs quiet."

Immortal Granny Luo and the others nodded repeatedly. Senior Matsuyama indeed had composure; such a major event as breaking through to True Body was understated in his mouth. Senior Matsuyama not rushing to break through to True Body must also be planning for a deep accumulation and natural progression. Cultivation should be calm and unhurried.

*Crack!*

Everyone was startled. It turned out that Fusong had accidentally snapped the threshold, made of Purple Gold Profound Wood, as he crossed it.

"Ah..."

"This is...?"

Immortal Granny Luo and the others exchanged glances. Fusong, however, left without looking back.

…

…

"Qingzhi, how do you think I can break through to True Body?" Fusong arrived at the Water Mansion, looking troubled, and found Zhou Qing, who was about to go into seclusion. Then he discovered Subhuti, emitting a great demon aura, and the "Heaven and Earth Spiritual Root," the Great Mulberry Tree. He suddenly felt like a lamb that had stumbled into a dragon's den.

"Didn't I say during the last sermon? The key is perseverance," Zhou Qing said with a helpless expression.

Fusong coughed, "Qingzhi, you can't just let that Old Daoist Zhang step all over me, can you?"

Zhou Qing nodded seriously, "You can, yes."

"Pfft." Yuan Mingyue couldn't help but laugh.

Fusong glared at Yuan Mingyue, "Niece, are you laughing at your Senior Martial Uncle?"

Yuan Mingyue quickly said, "Senior Martial Uncle, I wasn't laughing."

Zhou Qing smiled, then helped Yuan Mingyue out, laughing, "Second Senior Brother, once my divine abilities are perfected and I have time, I'll catch you a Core Formation level mount. Wouldn't that be stronger than you breaking through to True Body?"

Fusong: "You're just trying to fool me."

Zhou Qing smiled again, "Alright, no more jokes. Try refining this Mother Qi of All Things. If it works, when I have time, I'll try tempering your body with Heavenly Lightning Divine Light."

Fusong skeptically took the small jade bottle of Mother Qi of All Things, then thanked Zhou Qing and left.

"Master, didn't you say that ordinary cultivators find it extremely difficult to refine this Mother Qi of All Things?"

"Yes, not only is it difficult to refine, but the process will gradually stiffen the body and be incredibly painful."

"Can Senior Martial Uncle Fusong endure such hardship?"

Zhou Qing patted his disciple's head, "Don't underestimate your Senior Martial Uncle Fusong. Though he usually seems amusing, he is actually a person of great perseverance. Otherwise, do you think your Senior Martial Uncle could have achieved his current cultivation entirely by relying on others, old or young?"

Yuan Mingyue thought to herself, "Didn't Master often say that?"

After chatting with his female disciple for a while, Zhou Qing then said seriously, "Mingyue, next, I need your assistance in my cultivation."

Yuan Mingyue did not hesitate: "Disciple obeys."

Zhou Qing nodded, opening his Delusion-Breaking Divine Eye to examine his disciple's bone marrow and internal organs. He was about to begin the cultivation of the Yin-Yang Divine Light. Vast qi and blood power, along with immense pure Yang essence, drilled into Yuan Mingyue's body. For a moment, Yuan Mingyue's Profound Nether Qi was stimulated, her face alternately turning green and red, experiencing both ice and fire!
