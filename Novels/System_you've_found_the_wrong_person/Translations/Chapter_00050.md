# Chapter 50: Sister Dou - Dou Taizhen

Late at night.

The chaos gradually subsided, the raging flames slowly extinguishing. The great turmoil had completely dissipated.

Dou Changsheng sat upright on a long bench, the Hero's Sword resting horizontally across his knees.

Here's a joke.

He had personally stationed himself in the luxurious carriage to protect the Northern Yang Prince and Princess. The strongest enemy, Jin Sanming, had been slain by Dou Changsheng with a single sword stroke—so swiftly that the horses weren't even startled, and not a drop of tea had been spilled. Yet, Princess Chen Taizhen of Northern Yang had tragically perished at the hands of the Bloody-Handed Jin Sanming.

This wasn't just a rumor—it had been witnessed by countless people in broad daylight. The once-famous "Demon Consort," sister of Chancellor Chen Qingyao, had now met her untimely end.

Dou Changsheng's eyes were fixed on Ma Liren before him, scrutinizing every expression on the chief steward's face—down to the slightest movement of his eyeballs. Every subtle change was carefully observed. This chief steward was also a witness to Chen Taizhen's demise.

Damn it.

This guy's acting was too flawless.

Every detail of his account was impeccable. Dou Changsheng had already heard several versions of the story, all roughly the same. The only differences lay in minor details due to varying distances and angles from which people had witnessed the event.

Ma Liren looked nervous and spoke with bitter reluctance, "The princess was brutally killed by Jin Sanming. When this news reaches the capital and comes to the attention of His Majesty and the Chancellor... what are we to do?"

Dou Changsheng's face darkened as he listened to Ma Liren's lengthy lament. He really wanted to slap the man. There were no outsiders here—why keep up the act?

The sound of rustling footsteps approached. A refined middle-aged man holding a book and a brush walked over slowly. Upon seeing Dou Changsheng, he immediately praised, "The rumors in the martial world speak of Dou Changsheng—his strength unfathomable, always full of surprises. This time, he was merely accompanying the convoy back to Northern Yang on business. Who would have thought he'd encounter an attack from the Bloody-Handed Jin Sanming, ranked seventy-ninth on the Human Ranking List? A renowned expert on the Human Ranking List couldn't even withstand a single sword strike from Young Hero Dou."

"According to our records at the Martial Alliance Tower, Young Hero Dou, despite his unparalleled combat prowess, was only at the Xiantian realm. An eighteen-year-old Xiantian is rare in this world. Yet, it seems our information was incomplete—Young Hero Dou is not merely a Xiantian warrior, but a True Xiantian realm expert who has achieved the Five Qi Converging to the Origin. With such profound Xiantian true energy at his age, he can truly be called peerless under heaven."

"Tomorrow is the day the Martial Alliance Tower updates the Human Ranking List. Having received this news tonight, I've already sent a carrier pigeon to the headquarters in the capital. I'm certain that in tomorrow's ranking, Young Hero Dou will replace the Bloody-Handed Jin Sanming at the seventy-ninth position."

The visitor then expressed regret, "With Young Hero Dou's abilities, he certainly deserves higher than seventy-ninth. However, first-time entries on the ranking are usually not placed too high. After all, those ranked above have solid battle records to their names. Suddenly lowering their rankings would only invite trouble for Young Hero Dou."

"Since ancient times, there's no clear first in literature, but in martial arts, there's no second. Conflicts easily arise, escalating into bloody feuds—something that goes against the principles of our Martial Alliance Tower's Heaven, Earth, and Human Rankings."

Ma Liren glanced up at Dou Changsheng.

The Human Ranking.

He couldn't help but feel a sense of loss.

Thinking back to the past, he had once been on the Human Ranking too. But he had only hovered near the bottom, barely reaching eighty-second place by the age of thirty—lower than this young man's initial ranking. Yet even then, he had been hailed as a genius, enjoying the height of his glory.

For someone like him, this was already considered exceptional in the martial world. Countless others couldn't even make it onto the Human Ranking, let alone condense their divine intent, break through to the Divine Marvel realm, and become a grandmaster.

But compared to Dou Changsheng before him, what kind of genius was he? He was nothing but mediocrity.

An eighteen-year-old True Xiantian warrior, already possessing strength worthy of at least the top fifty on the Human Ranking—by the time he turned twenty, he would undoubtedly break into the top ten.

The words of Fire Cloud True Man held not an ounce of exaggeration.

The next decade belonged to Dou Changsheng.

The other geniuses born in the same era must be utterly despairing.

This was the next Demon Master.

Ma Liren sighed inwardly.

A single person could suppress all the mighty experts of the world, leaving them breathless.

Even the mighty Wolf Lord of the grasslands, commanding hundreds of thousands of cavalry, sweeping across the steppes and achieving unparalleled feats—hailed as a once-in-a-millennium ruler—was only ranked second on the Earth Ranking.

Such a terrifying figure, as long as he lived, was destined to stand above the four great nations.

Though Ma Liren's own strength surpassed Dou Changsheng's, he still felt an insurmountable chasm between them—one was heaven, the other earth.

The Martial Alliance Tower representative came and went quickly, soon disappearing from sight.

Only after the man's figure had vanished did Ma Liren turn back to Dou Changsheng and say, "After tonight's upheaval, Hero Dou must be exhausted. Your sister must have been frightened as well. Leave this matter to me—you should go check on her. If you need anything, just send someone to find me."

Dou Changsheng's expression remained impassive. If he could accept that Chen Taizhen had been killed by Jin Sanming, he could accept that he now had a sister.

After asking around, he arrived before a carriage. An elderly swordswoman lifted the curtain for him, and Dou Changsheng once again saw Chen—no, Dou Taizhen.

Dou Taizhen gestured for him to sit. Holding a scroll, she tucked a loose strand of hair behind her ear without looking at him, her gaze fixed on the text as she spoke:

"Your abilities are somewhat beyond expectations. Not only did the Martial Alliance Tower misjudge you—so did I. An eighteen-year-old True Xiantian surpasses ninety-nine percent of the world's population. In my lifetime, I've only seen a handful like you."

"You have the qualifications for me to change Chen to Dou. Since I'm borrowing your fortune to evade the Heavenly Tribulation, I won't treat you unfairly. Chen Qingyao once sought the Great Jin Empire, and I granted him that. He had the qualifications to replace the Liu family with the Chen name, to usurp the throne as an outsider."

"Master Jin was a stubborn man. I pestered him for years and agreed to many conditions before securing this opportunity for Chen Qingyao. You, too, may have a chance—but the drawbacks are significant."

"My last Heavenly Tribulation was barely survived, leaving my cultivation flawed. Evil thoughts frequently emerge, leading to vile behavior. You might not withstand it and perish midway. Cases like Chen Qingyao's—where one grows smoothly—are exceedingly rare in this world."

"Our fortunes are now intertwined. You're lucky that I'm currently in a lucid state. Otherwise, she wouldn't have given you this chance. Think carefully."

The four great nations, the grasslands, and even the world itself—behind such colossal powers, there must always stand a figure from the Heaven Ranking. But these experts rarely involve themselves in worldly conflicts due to the Heavenly Tribulation.

For the Chen family to replace the Lius without the support of the Undying Witch would be pure delusion. Yet with her approval alone, the qualifications were secured. Such was the power of a Heaven Ranking expert—the rise and fall of nations hinging on a single will.

Wait.

Fortunes intertwined.

Dou Changsheng had initially thought this was a stroke of bad luck. But now he realized—that wasn't the case at all.

His eyes burned as he stared at Dou Taizhen and said firmly, "Deal."

He knew his own circumstances.

Just one question.

Can you withstand my dozens of punches of misfortune?
