**Chapter 30: A Trap in the Inheritance—The Three-Life White Bone Path**  

The sky was just beginning to lighten.  

A crowd had already gathered in front of the Inheritance Pavilion. From time to time, people emerged wearing brand-new green cultivation robes, their spirits high and faces brimming with irrepressible joy.  

Zhang Jing stood quietly outside, observing the scene with calm eyes. Those around him instinctively kept their distance, though covert glances flickered toward him now and then. He paid them no mind, simply waiting in silence.  

Not far ahead, Shen Qingqing, who had arrived earlier, stood just as motionless. Anyone observing them from the front would have noticed the striking similarity in their expressions.  

Time passed slowly.  

Inside the Inheritance Pavilion, Zhang Jing stored the green cultivation robe he had received into his spirit jade space before scanning the surroundings. Soon, his eyes brightened as he spotted a familiar figure and hurried over.  

"Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother Liu."  

"Ah, Junior Brother Zhang," Senior Brother Liu said with a faint smile upon seeing him. "Congratulations on securing third place in the recent assessment."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother."  

After exchanging pleasantries, Senior Brother Liu asked curiously, "Is there something you needed from me, Junior Brother?"  

"Senior Brother, during my visit to Longze Market, I happened to acquire a complete lower-grade cultivation method. I came to ask if it could be exchanged for Dao Merits. If not, could it be traded for another inheritance here in the pavilion?" Zhang Jing asked hopefully.  

"Oh? A complete lower-grade cultivation method?"  

A trace of surprise flashed across Senior Brother Liu's face. It was rare for a complete cultivation method to appear outside the Dao Academy.  

Meeting Zhang Jing's gaze, Senior Brother Liu pondered for a moment before replying, "Junior Brother, are you certain it's a complete method? Do you have it with you now?"  

"Yes."  

Zhang Jing immediately retrieved the jade slip from his storage bag and handed it over.  

Senior Brother Liu took it, probed it with his divine sense, and then his expression darkened almost imperceptibly.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, you haven't cultivated this *Green Sparrow Qi-Grasping Method*, have you?" His voice carried a hint of tension.  

"I already have a mid-grade method, so I wouldn’t practice this one."  

Without another word, Senior Brother Liu scrutinized Zhang Jing intently, his divine sense sweeping over him.  

The aura was steady and pure—undoubtedly the spiritual energy cultivated through the *Five Organs Water Essence Method*.  

Only after confirming this did Senior Brother Liu relax slightly.  

"Senior Brother, is there something wrong with this cultivation method?" Zhang Jing asked cautiously, having noticed the odd reaction.  

"It *is* a complete lower-grade method," Senior Brother Liu admitted, "but it’s been altered. Heh, anyone who practices it will progress even faster than with a mid-grade method—provided they have sufficient resources. However, the moment they reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement, their essence, qi, and spirit will spontaneously condense into a *Three-Life White Bone Elixir*, ripe for harvesting."  

"Junior Brother, you must forget everything about this method."  

Zhang Jing froze, a chill running down his spine.  

Who could have guessed that a seemingly ordinary cultivation method was actually a deadly trap? From now on, he would have to be far more cautious.  

Senior Brother Liu pocketed the jade slip and said, "Junior Brother, I’ll take this. In return, I’ll credit you with 300 Dao Merits—the standard exchange rate for lower-grade methods. Does that suit you?"  

"Thank you, Senior Brother."  

Though Senior Brother Liu didn’t explicitly say so, Zhang Jing understood this was a special favor.  

After agreeing, Zhang Jing hesitated before asking another question:  

"Senior Brother, how many Dao Merits are required to exchange for an upper-grade cultivation method?"  

With his imminent entry into the Outer Academy, Zhang Jing wanted to clarify these matters early to plan accordingly.  

But instead of an immediate answer, silence followed.  

Zhang Jing looked up to find Senior Brother Liu regarding him with an amused expression.  

"Junior Brother, ever since you claimed third place yesterday, I knew you’d ask about upper-grade methods eventually. I just didn’t expect it so soon."  

With a sigh, Senior Brother Liu continued, "Well, no harm in telling you. An upper-grade method costs a full 9,000 Dao Merits. Few in the Outer Academy can amass such a sum—not even the top-ranked teams."  

"Not even them? Why is it so expensive?" Zhang Jing asked, stunned.  

"Junior Brother, do you know what an upper-grade method truly is?" Senior Brother Liu’s voice turned solemn.  

"Please enlighten me."  

"Upper-grade methods involve Dao Rhyme, and channeling Dao Rhyme is the foundation for forging the Dao Foundation. Thus, an upper-grade method is essentially a path to Foundation Establishment—though it encompasses Qi Refinement as well, given its higher perspective."  

"Junior Brother, heed my advice: focus on mastering the *Five Organs Water Essence Method* in the Outer Academy. Once you reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement and pass the Radiant Light Wall trial to enter the Inner Academy, you’ll have enough Dao Merits in three to five years to exchange for a suitable upper-grade method."  

"This is the safest path for someone of your talent."  

"If you divert your attention to accumulating Dao Merits and delay your cultivation, failing to reach the tenth level before forty, you’ll never enter the Inner Academy. Even if you somehow exchange for an upper-grade method and achieve Foundation Establishment, what then? Without stepping into the Golden Core and the Great Dao of Divine Abilities, two hundred years later, you’ll still be nothing but a handful of dust."  

Senior Brother Liu’s words were earnest. He genuinely didn’t want to see such a promising junior waste his potential over mere Dao Merits.  

"I see... Zhang Jing is grateful for your guidance."  

With that, Zhang Jing bowed deeply. Though disheartened, he recognized the sincere concern behind Senior Brother Liu’s words.  

"Good, good. Your talent lies not in the trivialities of Qi Refinement but in the decades ahead—Foundation Establishment and beyond. Don’t let momentary pride lead to lifelong regret."  

Senior Brother Liu’s gaze grew profound.  

Exhaling softly, Zhang Jing said, "Thank you for your counsel, Senior Brother. By the way, I plan to return home for a couple of days. Could I hitch a ride on the academy’s transport for those who failed the assessment?"  

"Simple enough. Since you’re from Linshan Prefecture in Huizhou... Pack your things and return here in an hour. The Azure Sky Crane will be waiting."  

"Many thanks, Senior Brother. Zhang Jing takes his leave."  

"Safe travels, Junior Brother."  

Only after Zhang Jing had vanished did Senior Brother Liu retrieve the jade slip again, his divine sense plunging ruthlessly into it.  

A moment later, the image of a green sparrow appeared before him. Unfazed, he delved deeper.  

In an instant, the sparrow’s feathers and flesh sloughed away, leaving behind a skeletal avian monstrosity. Its tattered wings, barely clinging to rotting sinew, spread wide, exuding an aura of profound decay.  

"So it *is* this..."  

Senior Brother Liu’s eyes turned icy.  

"The Three-Life White Bone Path—the Rotten Bone Crow!"  

---  

A mournful wind howled.  

A vast shadow slowly enveloped Zhang Jing, who had been waiting patiently.  

"It’s here!"  

His eyes lit up as he stepped forward. Beneath his feet, rippling water coalesced into a frosty platform, lifting him into the air.  

Within moments, he stood atop the broad back of the Azure Sky Crane.  

A green-robed Daoist sat cross-legged nearby, watching him intently, while curious gazes peered from the small cabins dotting the crane’s back.  

"Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother."  

Approaching the Daoist, Zhang Jing clasped his hands respectfully.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, no need for formalities. Please, sit." The Daoist—Senior Brother Qiu—smiled warmly.  

As Zhang Jing settled in, the crane let out a clear cry, pivoted, and soared into the distance.  

"How should I address you, Senior Brother?"  

"Call me Senior Brother Qiu. Heh, your performance in yesterday’s assessment was truly impressive."  

Zhang Jing blinked in surprise. "You were there?"  

"Naturally, and I saw everything. This year’s ranking battles were fiercer than ever. The new rules worked splendidly!"  

Senior Brother Qiu chuckled meaningfully before adding, "Junior Brother, given your talent in spellcraft, have you considered mastering a Dao Art upon entering the Outer Academy?"  

"A Dao Art?" Zhang Jing looked puzzled.  

"Indeed. As the saying goes, 'A hundred arts in cultivation: formations, alchemy, artifacts, and talismans.' The Dao encompasses all things—it’s not just about cultivation and spells. These arts are also paths to the Great Dao. Mastering even one is a remarkable achievement."  

He sighed. "Alas, true masters are rare."  

Zhang Jing’s interest was piqued. "Senior Brother, are these arts truly so scarce and valuable?"  

"Absolutely. For ordinary Outer Academy disciples, the quickest way to earn Dao Merits is by accepting demon-subjugation missions from the Spirit Mission Hall—which inevitably involves combat. Thus, artifacts, pills, and talismans are indispensable. The higher their quality and grade, the more precious they become. As for formations... most disciples can’t afford them."  

Senior Brother Qiu explained patiently.  

Across from him, Zhang Jing’s eyes gleamed brighter.  

He recalled the talismans he’d found in those rogue cultivators’ storage bags—carefully stored in jade boxes, a testament to their value.  

If even they prized them so highly, the same must hold true in the Dao Academy.  

After all, he had the Five Methods Spirit River, but others didn’t.  

"When you return to the academy, Junior Brother, visit my Thousand Arts Pavilion."  

"The Thousand Arts Pavilion..." Zhang Jing mused before nodding firmly. "I will. Thank you for the suggestion, Senior Brother."  

---  

Time flowed steadily.  

Night deepened, yet Yong’an Academy remained brightly lit.  

A sudden gust of wind announced the Azure Sky Crane’s descent.  

"Liu Sanyi welcomes Senior Brother!"  

Elder Liu, who had been waiting below, bowed respectfully.  

A streak of light flew to him as Senior Brother Qiu’s voice rang out:  

"Elder Liu, no need for courtesy. Yong’an Academy performed exceptionally this year—here are the Dao Academy’s rewards. These unsuccessful candidates are now in your care."  

A dozen figures disembarked from the crane’s back, Zhang Jing among them.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, I’ll take my leave now."  

Senior Brother Qiu waved farewell.  

With a beat of its wings, the crane vanished into the night.  

Elder Liu pocketed the rewards before turning to Zhang Jing, his expression complex.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, congratulations. Third place in the assessment—your path to immortality is now boundless!"  

"I owe much to your earlier guidance, Elder."  

Zhang Jing responded politely before excusing himself. "I’ll return home now. I’ll visit another day."  

"Of course, of course. Your parents have missed you dearly."  

Seeing Zhang Jing’s unchanged demeanor, Elder Liu broke into a warm smile.
