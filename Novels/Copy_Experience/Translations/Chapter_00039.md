# Chapter 39: Qi Condensation Sixth Layer (Two-in-One)

Lu Xu took out five mid-grade magical artifacts, preparing to sell them all at this trade fair. He had a total of eight mid-grade magical artifacts on him. Of the remaining three, one was his Azure Glow Sword, which he intended to use. The other two were Mo Qingyuan's folding fan and Fatty Mo's crimson small sword. He still had some concerns, so he didn't intend to bring out these two magical artifacts from the Mo family.

The magical artifacts, one by one, shone brightly on the table in the middle of the stone chamber, immediately attracting many gazes. Although everyone present had mid-grade magical artifacts on them, many people still came forward with interest to examine them after Lu Xu displayed so many.

"What is the name of this artifact?" a black-robed cultivator asked, pointing at the Xuan Rock Seal in front of Lu Xu.

"The Xuan Rock Seal. This is a rare top-tier item among mid-grade magical artifacts. If a fellow Daoist were to buy it at a large shop, you wouldn't get it for less than 120 spirit stones!" Lu Xu introduced.

"Then how many spirit stones are you selling it for here?"

"110 spirit stones!"

"Too expensive!" The black-robed cultivator shook his head. "Buying this artifact carries a risk; it needs to be cheaper."

Someone nearby leaned over and added, "The rule of our secret market is that all artifacts obtained through irregular means must be 20% cheaper than in large shops!"

"If fellow Daoist offers 95 spirit stones, I'll take it!"

"Ninety-five? I can't possibly sell it for such a low price! A top-tier item like this is surely worth a little risk, isn't it?" Lu Xu shook his head.

"Someone who can use this kind of artifact must be at Qi Condensation Sixth Layer, right? Fellow Daoist actually killed a Sixth-Layer cultivator!" A woman wearing a veil suddenly chuckled and said.

"What? Is this fairy interested in how I obtained this artifact?" Lu Xu immediately turned to look at her, his tone quite unfriendly.

"Fellow Daoist, please calm your anger. I was just speaking casually, with no intention of prying," the woman immediately apologized.

Since no one present could use spirit-sight techniques, and everyone had basically concealed their cultivation, no one could tell what realm others were in. Because of this, they were all extremely cautious. When Lu Xu displayed such a strong stance, it immediately made others wary, as he could potentially be someone who had killed a Qi Condensation Sixth Layer cultivator.

"How about I offer 98 spirit stones? This is already higher than the secret market price!"

"I quite like this artifact. 100 spirit stones, fellow Daoist, please sell it to me!"

The Xuan Rock Seal, being a top-tier item among magical artifacts, was quite popular, and was eventually taken by the veiled woman for 105 spirit stones.

However, the other four mid-grade magical artifacts that followed weren't as lucky; they were all very common artifacts. Even if sold in large shops, their price would at most be around 80 spirit stones. Most people present likely had one such artifact on them. There were truly few people interested in buying them. Lu Xu had no choice but to lower the price again and again to sell them all. In the end, these five artifacts sold for a total of 360 spirit stones.

After selling the artifacts, Lu Xu returned to his original seat and waited quietly. People continuously stepped forward to conduct transactions in the middle of the stone chamber. After Lu Xu, several large transactions of three to four hundred spirit stones successively occurred. Whenever a transaction was completed, someone would hastily push open the stone chamber door and leave. And after these people left, occasionally others would follow, perhaps intending to engage in some 'black-eating-black' schemes.

Thus, Lu Xu waited until a dozen more transactions had taken place before quietly getting up, pushing open the door, and leaving the stone chamber. After so many large-sum spirit stone transactions, the impact of his earlier few transactions on the crowd was no longer as strong. Everyone's attention was diverted to others. Nevertheless, when he left, several gazes still fell upon his back. Some people were stirring. Lu Xu had just acquired 360 spirit stones; who wouldn't be tempted by such a large sum? Someone was about to get up, but then suddenly remembered that this tightly wrapped individual had just bought a Fire Thunder Bead. In an instant, it was like a basin of cold water poured over their heads, extinguishing all fantasies. Thinking further, how could someone who could produce so many mid-grade magical artifacts of unknown origin be an easy target? Every mid-grade magical artifact could represent a fellow cultivator at the mid-Qi Condensation stage killed by him. This was a tough character! He might even be a late-Qi Condensation cultivator; it's best not to provoke him!

After these ill-intentioned cultivators pondered for a moment, they all gave up their covetousness towards Lu Xu. There was no need for them to risk messing with such an obvious tough character. Thus, Lu Xu left the secret market trade fair without any disturbance.

Weidu was a prosperous city, with several million inhabitants, and its streets were never deserted during the day. With a few shifts of his body, Lu Xu merged into the crowd and then disappeared. He circled around several times, then quickly changed his disguise, using the bronze mask to mold a new face.

After circling Weidu a few more times, he flew towards Tianmen City. "No one followed. It seems I don't need to use the Fire Thunder Bead I just acquired!" Lu Xu nodded in satisfaction. It seemed the underground trade order in Weidu hadn't completely collapsed.

He arrived safely in Tianmen City, and seeing the cultivators coming and going, Lu Xu finally relaxed completely. He didn't rush back to his residence but instead turned and walked towards an alley in the northern part of Tianmen City. Upon reaching this street, Lu Xu immediately smelled a strong medicinal fragrance. This was where all sorts of spirit medicine shops in Tianmen City gathered.

Walking up to a spirit medicine shop, Lu Xu asked for the names of several spirit medicines.

"Fellow Daoist wants to buy spirit medicines for refining Qi Nurturing Pills? These are very expensive!"

"How many sets can you provide here?"

"Let me see!"

A moment later, the spirit medicine shop owner came out and said to Lu Xu, "We should be able to put together two sets!"

"That little?"

"Is this little? Fellow Daoist, do you think these spirit medicines are common cabbage? You're an alchemist, aren't you? Don't you know how precious the main ingredients for Qi Nurturing Pills are?" the shopkeeper said grumpily. Then, a hint of confusion appeared on his face: "Speaking of which, since you're buying this kind of spirit medicine, you must be a mid-grade alchemist, right? I know all the mid-grade alchemists in Tianmen City, and fellow Daoist seems unfamiliar!"

Hearing the other party trying to inquire about his identity, Lu Xu quickly said: "I'm buying medicine for a friend. Never mind, two sets it is, I'll take them all!"

Spending 40 spirit stones to buy two sets of Qi Nurturing Pill ingredients, Lu Xu left the alley. After circling around, he changed his appearance and came back to another shop to buy one more set of Qi Nurturing Pill ingredients. He repeated this several times, almost visiting every spirit medicine shop in the city. It took him a full day, and he bought a total of eight sets of Qi Nurturing Pill ingredients. This cost him a total of 160 spirit stones.

Upon returning, he immediately began secluded alchemy. The temperature in the earth-fire room rapidly rose. Roaring flames scorched the fiery red alchemy furnace. Lu Xu kept his eyes fixed on the furnace, occasionally forming hand seals. Thus, a month passed.

The door of the earth-fire room opened. Feeling the cool air outside, Lu Xu smiled. This time, after exhausting eight sets of ingredients, he had thirty-three Qi Nurturing Pills. "Not enough, I need to go buy more!"

Lu Xu changed his appearance again and made another trip to various medicine shops. This time, he was lucky; he happened to find a shop that had just received five main ingredients for Qi Nurturing Pills. Adding the stock from other shops, Lu Xu obtained ten sets of ingredients in one go. A month later, these ten sets of ingredients transformed into forty-two Qi Nurturing Pills. With this, the total number of Qi Nurturing Pills in Lu Xu's possession reached twelve bottles.

"That's about enough!"

"Secluded cultivation!" Lu Xu muttered to himself, taking the newly refined pills into the cultivation chamber. He first closed his eyes to meditate for several hours, adjusting his entire being. Then, he took out a pill, swallowed it, and began his arduous secluded cultivation! The gate of this courtyard closed tightly once more. Only a few months had passed since his last seclusion, and Lu Xu once again entered seclusion.

Day by day, time passed. While Lu Xu cultivated peacefully, the outside world gradually became turbulent. Among the Wei Kingdom's nine major powers, the Imperial Clan Wei Family, the Chen Family, and the White Mountain Sect jointly attacked the Black Robe Society, which occupied Qinghu Market. These three parties each sent out a Foundation Establishment expert, leading a formidable army of over five hundred cultivators, and charged forward. Everyone originally thought that in the face of such a powerful force, the Black Robe Society would inevitably be defeated, perhaps even wiped from the history of Wei Kingdom.

However, to everyone's surprise, the Black Robe Society actually held its ground. Facing the attack of three Foundation Establishment experts, another Foundation Establishment cultivator surprisingly appeared from the Black Robe Society's side. Two Foundation Establishment cultivators, plus the Black Robe Society leader who possessed a Thousand Soul Banner capable of summoning a Foundation Establishment-stage evil ghost, constituted three Foundation Establishment-level combat strengths. Furthermore, the Black Robe Society, for some unknown reason, suddenly obtained a second-tier formation, which they used to defend Qinghu Market. With three Foundation Establishment-level combat strengths and a second-tier formation, the three-family allied army was utterly helpless against them. This punitive expedition, which everyone expected to be a sweeping victory, thus fell into a stalemate. The three-family allied army couldn't just retreat ignominiously, yet they couldn't overcome the Black Robe Society either. They could only blockade Qinghu Market, resulting in a prolonged standoff.

"Why have grain prices risen again? If this continues, who can afford spirit rice? Everyone will have to eat mortal food and spend all day relieving themselves!"

"Fellow Daoist, please calm down. This can't be helped; the battle at Qinghu Market still has no outcome!"

"How can the Wei family not be able to defeat a mere Black Robe Society? What are they even doing?"

In front of a spirit rice shop, a group of cultivators, seeing the increased price of spirit rice, couldn't help but grumble discontentedly. By now, even the cheapest Qinghu Spirit Rice could only be bought for eight catties per spirit stone. The price had risen fivefold!

Tianmen City was located amidst mountains and did not produce spirit rice itself. However, over ten thousand cultivators resided there, creating an annual demand for over a million catties of spirit rice. Without the Mo family's supply, a massive shortage of several hundred thousand catties immediately appeared in the spirit rice market. At first, the Wei family could use some previously hoarded spirit rice to stabilize grain prices, but now they were also helpless. Grain prices rose day by day, and many cultivators could no longer afford it, so they could only buy some mortal food and mix it with spirit rice. It was likely that many people were now considering leaving Tianmen City and choosing another place for cultivation.

"Sigh, it seems Qinghu Market might truly be be completely occupied by rogue cultivators in the future. Wei Kingdom will lose an important granary!"

"Those big figures at the Foundation Establishment stage have long been able to abstain from grain, so they don't care how scarce food becomes. What about us small Qi Condensation cultivators?"

"This whole thing is strange! Where did the rogue cultivators get a second-tier formation? There are only a few second-tier formation masters in the entire Wei Kingdom!"

"Hehe, don't you know that the Black Robe Society has a master behind them—" An old man stopped speaking mid-sentence, suddenly as if he were concerned about something.

"A master? What master?"

"Haha, I just spoke casually. Fellow Daoist, don't mind it. These are just street rumors, not to be taken seriously!" The old man laughed it off.

"Hmph, is there a need to act so mysterious? Isn't it just the Thousandfold Absolute Sect? Most of the Wei family members are currently holed up in two cities, not daring to go out, precisely because they fear the Golden Core patriarch of the Thousandfold Absolute Sect making a move, aren't they?" a young man sneered a few times and said.

"Shh! You can't just blurt that out. Fellow Daoist, have you forgotten we're in Tianmen City?"

The standoff between the three-family allied army and the Black Robe Society gradually reached three years. During this period, multiple major battles occurred between these parties, but no clear victor emerged. The Wei family clearly possessed powerful forces that could easily destroy the Black Robe Society, yet they seemed to be wary of something, completely daring not to unleash them. The stalemated war caused the situation in Tianmen City to worsen progressively. Over three years, more than a thousand rogue cultivators gradually left Tianmen City. This was just the beginning. If the Wei family couldn't quickly resolve the spirit rice shortage, more and more cultivators would leave. In the end, prosperous Tianmen City might decline significantly because of this. The entire cultivation world of Wei Kingdom was watching the Wei family, waiting to see their next move.

While the outside world constantly churned, Lu Xu continued to develop peacefully. As bottle after bottle of pills were consumed, his cultivation grew daily, and his spiritual power became increasingly abundant.

Until this day.

Lu Xu, who had been sitting cross-legged peacefully, suddenly trembled all over. The constantly rotating azure qi mass within his body suddenly stopped turning. With a single surge and contraction, the azure qi mass rapidly expanded, suddenly swelling to the size of a thumb. After pausing for a moment, it resumed rotating, and wisps of spiritual power, much denser and more robust than before, were transported through his meridians to every part of Lu Xu's body. Lu Xu suddenly opened his eyes, a sharp glint flashing within them.

He had broken through to Qi Condensation Sixth Layer!

He inwardly examined himself and immediately saw the changes on the bluestone tablet:

*   **Name:** Lu Xu
*   **Lifespan:** 27/126
*   **Cultivation:** Qi Condensation Sixth Layer
*   **Spirit Root:** Wood (Mid-Lower)
*   **Cultivation Method:** Azure Wood Art (Great Perfection): 1000/1000
*   **Replication Points:** 239
*   **Skill - Alchemy:**
    *   First-tier Low-grade Alchemist: 91/100
    *   First-tier Mid-grade Alchemist: 47/100 (3x)
*   **Skill - Talisman Making:**
    *   First-tier Low-grade Talisman Master: 44/100
    *   First-tier Mid-grade Talisman Master: 12/100 (3x)
*   **Skill - Spells:**

Cultivating for twelve years, he had entered Qi Condensation Sixth Layer. If he hadn't relied on pills, with his mid-lower spirit root, it would have taken him approximately thirty years to achieve this.

"No wonder reaching Qi Condensation Tenth Layer before sixty years old is a chasm; too few people can meet this requirement!" Lu Xu mused. "If one doesn't rely on external aids like pills, then perhaps only cultivators with high-grade spirit roots can meet this most basic requirement for Foundation Establishment!"

Cultivation was difficult, even at the Qi Condensation stage. Of course, if it weren't so difficult, if there weren't those few bottlenecks in the Qi Condensation stage, and cultivation were easy, then the cultivation world would be full of Qi Condensation Grand Perfection experts. Anyone slightly older could cultivate to Qi Condensation Grand Perfection, and all the resources in the cultivation world would be monopolized by these old fellows. For newcomers to the cultivation world, that would simply be hell. But ultimately, cultivation was not that easy. For someone with the worst spirit root, like Old Man Xu, just cultivating to Qi Condensation Sixth Layer would take at least one hundred and fifty years. Not to mention Qi Condensation Grand Perfection. His lifespan couldn't support him in cultivating further, so after understanding this, he placed his hopes on the next generation, remaining only at Qi Condensation Third Layer himself.

This was the reality of cultivating with low-grade spirit roots. Even if they cultivated arduously their entire lives, most of them would be unable to enter the late Qi Condensation stage. Their peak was the pinnacle of Qi Condensation Sixth Layer; the bottleneck to the late Qi Condensation stage was an insurmountable chasm for them. For mid-grade spirit roots, the bottleneck to late Qi Condensation could still be overcome after decades of struggle. Their lifelong endpoint was Qi Condensation Ninth Layer, or Qi Condensation Grand Perfection. But without external aid, they could not meet the basic requirement of reaching Qi Condensation Tenth Layer before sixty years old for Foundation Establishment. Only cultivators with high-grade spirit roots could meet this requirement without external aid. Based on spirit root aptitude, the cultivation world thus drew cruel dividing lines. This ensured that a large number of cultivators, regardless of age, could only remain at the bottom of the cultivation world. This kept the structure of the cultivation world in a pyramid shape, rather than an inverted thumbtack shape.

"With my cultivation speed, reaching Qi Condensation Tenth Layer before sixty years old will definitely not be a problem!" Lu Xu's eyes narrowed slightly. "At that time, I should start considering how to obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill!"

Foundation Establishment Pill! This was an obstacle that all cultivators who could meet the most basic conditions for Foundation Establishment could not bypass. Without the aid of a Foundation Establishment Pill, even those with high-grade spirit roots would find it difficult to establish their foundation. Only Heavenly Spirit Roots could ignore bottlenecks and directly advance. Foundation Establishment Pills were hard to obtain. Especially for those without the backing of a major power, obtaining a single Foundation Establishment Pill was as difficult as ascending to the heavens. However, Lu Xu's situation was somewhat different; he had his cheat. Currently, he already had a vague plan in mind, just waiting until his cultivation reached Qi Condensation Ninth or Tenth Layer before implementing it.

Stepping out of the courtyard, Lu Xu soon appeared in a teahouse. He sipped on spirit tea while listening to the cultivators around him engaging in lively discussions. Soon, various matters that had occurred in the Wei Kingdom's cultivation world over the past few years gradually reached Lu Xu's ears.

"The Black Robe Society actually held on? It seems my guess was absolutely correct; the Black Robe Society definitely has ties with the Thousandfold Absolute Sect!"

"Why do I feel that Tianmen City will soon become unstable too? That Golden Core True Man is about to pass away, isn't he? If he wants to eliminate potential troubles for his sect before he dies..."

"Why is it that wherever I go, turmoil breaks out?" Lu Xu stroked his chin, feeling a little speechless. "It can't be that I'm a jinx, can it?"

The Wei Kingdom's cultivation world had been stable and peaceful for three hundred years, with almost no major events occurring during that time. Yet, in the few years since he embarked on the path of cultivation, various turmoils had sprung up like mushrooms after rain.

Shaking his head, Lu Xu temporarily stopped worrying about these chaotic matters. He walked into a room in the teahouse and met the old man he had seen last time.

"May I ask how to address fellow Daoist?" the old man asked with a smile upon seeing Lu Xu.

"My surname is Bai. This time, I came to ask fellow Daoist for some advice regarding the various high-grade Talisman Masters in our Tianmen City..."

Half an hour later, Lu Xu left a spirit stone and turned to leave the teahouse.
