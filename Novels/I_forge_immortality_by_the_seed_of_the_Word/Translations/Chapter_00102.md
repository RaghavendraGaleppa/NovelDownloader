# Chapter 100: The Sixth Void Heaven

A roar that seemed to echo from ancient times resounded through the skies.

On the final step of the Fourth Void Heaven's Celestial Stairway, the guardian spirit deity was instantly crushed the moment it appeared, without even a shred of resistance.

Without pausing for breath.

Zhang Jing controlled the wildly violent several dozen zhang-long black flood dragon as it continued coiling its way upward.

Compared to the desolation of the Fourth Void Heaven.

The Fifth Void Heaven was exceptionally lively.

From this point onward, the presence of inner sect disciples became increasingly common.

At this moment.

In the central area of a temporary settlement spanning several li, where numerous stone houses had been erected.

About twenty people sat around a stone table, enthusiastically exchanging information—where spirit beasts were abundant, which areas' spirit beasts were best avoided, and so on.

Laughter and conversation rose and fell in turn.

However.

Though these people sat together, appearing close on the surface, in reality they were clearly divided into three distinct factions.

Undercurrents swirled between them.

"Look at the Celestial Stairway!"

Someone suddenly shouted in alarm, having noticed something.

All eyes immediately turned toward the Celestial Stairway.

In their line of sight.

A several dozen zhang-long black flood dragon seemed to be traversing through void space as it slowly emerged from a dark rift in midair, then flew directly toward the first step of the Celestial Stairway.

Without pausing for even half a breath.

First step, second step, third step...

Half an hour later.

Silence returned to the Celestial Stairway.

The black flood dragon had already broken through the ninth step, ascending to the next Void Heaven.

Gulp—

Someone swallowed hard and exclaimed incredulously: "That must have been one of the junior brothers from the Fourth Void Heaven below, right? Did his Dao Foundation undergo transformation?"

As the words fell.

The group exchanged glances, their faces filled with undisguised astonishment.

To ascend directly from the Fourth Void Heaven to the Sixth Void Heaven in one go—there could be no explanation other than the transformation of one's Dao Foundation.

A Dao Foundation transformation!

Wasn't this precisely the slim chance that all of them had entered the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven hoping to achieve?

And it had only been two months since they entered.

Someone had already accomplished it?

The envy in their eyes was nearly impossible to conceal.

Just then.

"You all should take a look at the Spiritual Essence Ranking!"

"That junior brother who just 'whooshed' past wasn't one of the five inner sect junior brothers from below—it was Dragon Lake Academy's outer sect disciple, Junior Brother Zhang Jing!"

Someone who had noticed the changes on the Spiritual Essence Ranking spoke up, their voice suddenly turning hoarse.

The scene fell into complete silence.

Before long.

Over a dozen pairs of eyes focused on the Dragon Lake Academy inner sect disciples present.

As if waiting for their explanation.

After a long silence.

A Thousand Methods Pavilion inner sect disciple spoke with complex emotions in his eyes: "He's the next Chief Inner Sect Disciple of our Thousand Methods Pavilion. Isn't it normal for him to be a bit stronger?"

Meanwhile.

Outside.

On the Spiritual Essence Ranking, Zhang Jing's abnormally rapid climb in ranking finally drew the attention of all the academy heads and pavilion masters present.

They shifted their focus from the top-ranked inner sect disciples to Zhang Jing's name.

Discussions erupted!

"Tsk, Fellow Daoist Qi, Dragon Lake Academy has hidden its cards well. If not for the opening of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven, how much longer did you plan to keep this 'Zhang Jing' hidden?"

"Even more shameless—you even put forward two Class A disciples to divert attention?"

"What's wrong? Have you given up on immortality and started studying mortal military tactics instead?"

The head of Mystic Light Academy sneered disdainfully.

Yet beneath that disdain lay deep-seated envy.

For a Qi Refinement cultivator to reach the Sixth Void Heaven could only mean Zhang Jing's comprehension of Dao Intent had far surpassed mere fragments.

The key was that less than a quarter of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven's duration had passed.

In the remaining ten months.

No one dared predict how far this young man could go.

If he continued growing at this rate, his chances of forging a Golden Nature Dao Foundation would be extremely high.

By the time the next opening of the Clear Void Profound Heaven arrived.

He might very well reach the upper ranks of the True Spirit Ranking—perhaps even break into the top hundred!

"Dragon Lake Academy has truly hatched a dragon among men!"

The Mystic Light Academy head sighed inwardly.

Opposite him.

Hearing these words, and noticing the resentful gaze from the Divine Thunder Academy head.

The Dragon Lake Academy head was equally bewildered, though this was quickly followed by quiet delight.

Of course he knew Zhang Jing.

But he distinctly remembered the Thousand Methods Pavilion reporting only the young man's extraordinary talent in formation talismans—not mentioning such formidable aptitude in true techniques.

But that hardly mattered now.

It seemed Dragon Lake Academy would stand unrivaled during the next opening of the Clear Void Profound Heaven!

Elsewhere.

The Thousand Methods Pavilion master trembled with excitement, his beard quivering.

At this moment, only one thought filled his mind:

To hell with formation talisman Dao Foundations.

Who decreed that the Thousand Methods Pavilion chief must be a formation talisman specialist?

If anyone dared bring this up again, he—as Pavilion Master—would be the first to object!

Sixth Void Heaven.

Seventh Step of the Celestial Stairway!

Zhang Jing's gaze momentarily lost focus, a trace of helplessness flashing through his eyes.

In the next instant.

The ferociously roaring black flood dragon beneath him dissipated, and he transformed into a streak of light, swiftly departing.

Behind him.

Roar!

The guardian spirit deity wreathed in violent battle intent could only release a frustrated howl before reluctantly returning to its position, reverting into a shadowy statue.

Midair.

The scenery of the Sixth Void Heaven gradually came into view.

Zhang Jing finally exhaled in relief.

An endless expanse of jungle and wilderness stretched before him.

Though the density of spirit beast auras here couldn't compare to the boundless desert sea of the Fourth Void Heaven, it far surpassed that of the Third Void Heaven.

As if remembering something.

Zhang Jing immediately connected with the Dao Mark on his palm.

[Spiritual Essence: 293,850]

His previously exhausted Spiritual Essence had recovered to nearly 300,000. Whenever he wished, he could return to the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault to comprehend Dao Intent.

A significant portion of this essence.

Came from slaying the guardian spirit deities of the Fifth and Sixth Void Heavens.

Especially those of the Sixth Void Heaven.

Each slain guardian yielded 30,000 Spiritual Essence.

"Based on previous experience, the average spirit beast here provides about 3,500 Spiritual Essence."

At this thought.

The fire in Zhang Jing's eyes burned brighter.

Though the competition here seemed rather intense.

Frowning, he directly checked the Spiritual Essence Ranking.

With just a glance.

Zhang Jing counted 243 names marked with "Sixth Void Heaven."

His own name sat squarely at the very bottom.

Seeing his ranking didn't surprise him.

This was the Spiritual Essence Ranking—it measured accumulated essence, not progress on the Celestial Stairway!

These senior brothers had arrived before him, naturally amassing more essence.

These were mid-to-upper tier inner sect disciples from the three great academies—not the mediocre talents he'd encountered in the Fourth Void Heaven.

Of course, Senior Brother Song Ci was an exception.

Having perfected his Dao Rhyme, he would likely soon advance to the Fifth or even Sixth Void Heaven.

As he descended further.

A valley containing clusters of stone houses came into view.

"This must be the gathering place for inner sect disciples."

Zhang Jing's eyes brightened.

He adjusted his course, flying directly toward the valley.

Landing gently.

Zhang Jing surveyed his surroundings as he strolled forward.

Perhaps because most disciples were out hunting spirit beasts during the day.

Few people remained here.

Only scattered traces of powerful auras emanated from various corners.

Just as he was looking around.

"Junior Brother Zhang?"

A voice tinged with surprise suddenly called out behind him.
