# Chapter 96: Senior Brother, What Exactly Did You Do Before Joining the Daoist Academy? (Combined)

"Screech! Screech!"

In the narrow mountain path, a group of black-furred monkeys with crimson eyes leaped down from the ancient trees on either side. Their limbs were wreathed in dark demonic energy, resembling black shadows as they silently advanced toward a man and woman walking along the path.

The woman had skin as fair as snow and wore a long emerald-green dress adorned with tinkling jade ornaments. A gentle smile seemed perpetually gracing her lips. The man was tall and broad-shouldered, his sleeves fluttering in the breeze, his handsome features exuding an air of effortless grace.

The two walked along the path, engrossed in conversation, seemingly oblivious to the black monkeys suddenly descending upon them. The monkeys' faces twisted with bloodthirsty excitement as they raised their palms, dark demonic energy swirling with corrosive power, mere inches from striking their targets.

"Clang!"

At that moment, a massive illusory blue lotus suddenly bloomed around the pair. The petals shimmered with a golden luster, as though forged from unbreakable metal. The monkeys' attacks landed on the lotus, producing metallic clangs—utterly incapable of breaching its defense.

Not only that, but a powerful purifying force surged from the lotus, like a spring breeze melting snow, intent on obliterating all demonic corruption.

"Screech!"

Before the black monkeys could react, they were sent flying by an unseen force, crashing to the ground with shattered meridians, their lives extinguished.

Witnessing this, Bian Chuyao couldn't help but sigh:

"Back then, the Zhongshan Kingdom spanned tens of thousands of miles, boasting multiple Golden Core cultivators. Though not as formidable as our Qingfeng Daoist Academy, it was still a renowned power in its own right, its mountain gates filled with jade palaces and spiritual beasts. Who would have thought it would end up like this?"

"Even the once-spiritually enlightened Golden-Backed Apes have turned into demons..."

That great battle had claimed countless cultivators' lives. With the battlefield hastily cleared and the entire Zhongshan Kingdom subsequently cast into the Land of Annihilation, the corpses of those cultivators became food for the beasts and demonic creatures of the mountains. Feeding on these remains, they grew stronger, but were also corroded by the lingering resentment, gradually transforming into demonic abominations—even the spiritual veins became tainted.

"Fortunately, cultivation realms are locked in the Land of Annihilation. Though these demonic creatures are numerous, none can surpass the Qi Refining stage. With Senior Brother Gu here, I'm sure we'll safely obtain the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit!"

As she spoke, Bian Chuyao looked up at Gu Yuan, her eyes sparkling with admiration.

Unmoved by her feigned admiration, Gu Yuan frowned and asked, "Junior Sister, why haven't you made a single move this entire journey?"

Since entering Yunlan Mountain, they had already faced several attacks of varying scales. Though none of the creatures were particularly powerful, Bian Chuyao had yet to lift a finger—even when the beasts were mere inches away, she waited for Gu Yuan to protect her.

While Gu Yuan was certainly capable of shielding her, her persistent reluctance to act left him puzzled. Was she waiting for something?

Faced with his questioning, Bian Chuyao merely tilted her head and smiled. "These minor demons are no match for you, Senior Brother! I'm saving my strength to protect you when the time comes!"

"What do you mean by that, Junior Sister? Is there some unforeseen danger here?"

"I can't say for certain, but it's best to be prepared. Rest assured, if danger arises, I will act. As for these lesser demons along the path, I trust they pose no challenge to you, Senior Brother."

Gu Yuan wasn't so easily fooled. He keenly grasped the implication in her words. "Does that mean... others are also coming for the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit?"

Bian Chuyao hesitated briefly before sighing. "I can't confirm it, but it's wise to be cautious. Don't worry, Senior Brother—I'll assist from now on and not leave you to face everything alone."

Gu Yuan nodded silently, though his gaze toward Yunlan Mountain flickered with suspicion.

---

In the Land of Annihilation, magical artifacts couldn't be used. Without them, Qi Refining cultivators attempting to fly via hand seals alone would expend tremendous energy. Compounded by the miasmic clouds shrouding Yunlan Mountain and the remnants of Zhongshan Kingdom's anti-flight formations, flight was impossible. Thus, Gu Yuan and Bian Chuyao had no choice but to ascend the mountain step by step along the stone path.

After a long journey—and numerous skirmishes with mountain demons repelled by Gu Yuan—they finally entered the miasma-covered depths of Yunlan Mountain.

"Whoosh!"

The moment they stepped onto the path, black miasma surged toward them like a tide, relentlessly corroding their spiritual energy and minds. Fortunately, both possessed superior spiritual sense and the protection of Miasma-Breaking Pills, allowing them to traverse the black fog unharmed.

"Screech!"

Suddenly, a shrill fox cry pierced the air. Within the miasma, a dilapidated black temple materialized before them. A black fox stood atop the ruins, howling skyward. Its eerie wail carried an invisible spiritual assault, rushing toward the duo. An ordinary cultivator would have been paralyzed by such an attack.

But a silver dragon and a golden phoenix soared forth, effortlessly intercepting the fox's spiritual assault. Yet the black fox moved like lightning, its limbs wreathed in thick demonic energy as it lunged for Gu Yuan's throat.

This was the scene from the Crossing the True Stars Formation—but the fox before them was far stronger, having reached the ninth level of Qi Refining. However, Gu Yuan had also grown significantly more powerful.

"Roar!"

The silver dragon not only blocked the fox's spiritual attack but twisted midair, tearing it to shreds. With its spiritual sense damaged, the fox's movements faltered. In the next instant, a flurry of pink peach blossoms reduced its head to pulp.

The fox's corpse collapsed, but within moments, it dissolved into black smoke, vanishing into the temple.

"In that great battle, Golden Core cultivators perished, their blood and corpses tainting the spiritual veins here. Some of these creatures are born from the corrupted veins. Even if slain, they will reform over time as long as beasts roam these lands, returning to guard these ruins."

"This is why the demonic creatures of Yunlan Mountain never truly perish."

"But don't worry, Senior Brother—nothing beyond the Qi Refining stage will appear. Once we eliminate the demons along the way, we can enter Yunlan Valley and claim the Flowing Flame Golden Fruit."

Seeing Gu Yuan's puzzled expression, Bian Chuyao offered an explanation. Gu Yuan nodded in understanding.

Without further words, they bypassed the temple and pressed onward. In the distance, a densely forested peak came into view—its trees teeming with shadowy wraiths dangling from the branches.

This was undoubtedly the White Tiger Ridge from the Crossing the True Stars Formation.

Bian Chuyao moved forward without hesitation, but Gu Yuan suddenly halted, his sharp gaze locking onto a spot beside the forest.

"Senior Brother Gu?"

Bian Chuyao extended her spiritual sense, scrutinizing the area, but found nothing amiss. Puzzled, she turned to Gu Yuan.

"Bandits," he stated coolly.

"What? Bandits? Where?"

Bian Chuyao's expression shifted to surprise as she scanned the area again with enhanced spiritual vision—yet still detected nothing.

"The soil beneath our feet has been sprinkled with Soul-Severing Demon Powder. It's a rare substance refined from miasma, blending seamlessly with it. Nearly undetectable to Qi Refining cultivators' spiritual sense, it marks anyone who steps on it like a beacon to those who know how to look."

"Moreover, it agitates the minds of lesser demons, amplifying their bloodlust."

"This powder requires a Foundation Establishment cultivator to refine. Those at Qi Refining can't perceive it."

Bian Chuyao blinked. "Then how did you notice it, Senior Brother?"

Gu Yuan didn't answer.

"Since bandits are lying in wait, they must be expecting someone to pass through. But we entered Yunlan Mountain directly with the Azure Jade Token—we're likely not their targets. Follow me..."

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan moved toward a different path, sprinkling a substance into the air before concealing himself with a Void-Concealing Jade in a secluded grove. Bian Chuyao followed suit, activating a concealing treasure of her own.

For a time, the mountain forest fell eerily silent, save for the mournful howl of the wind.

Before long, a group emerged from the miasma—two white-robed cultivators at the ninth level of Qi Refining, followed by two at the eighth level, their faces weary from travel.

"Brother Ma, after such a long journey, we've finally reached Yunlan Mountain!"

"Once we slay these demons, we can enter Yunlan Valley. There, we'll surely gather enough resources to attempt Foundation Establishment!"

The group conversed in hushed tones as they cautiously advanced.

"Roar!"

Yet before they could even approach the forest, a thunderous roar erupted. A white-furred tiger with vertical pupils emerged, leading a horde of wraiths in a sudden assault.

The cultivators' faces paled.

"Whoosh!"

At that moment, a faint breeze stirred, carrying an unseen powder. Then, from the opposite side of the forest, two concealed figures abruptly materialized—seemingly startled by their sudden exposure.

"Fang Bai!"

"It's you!"

The white-robed cultivators' expressions twisted in shock and fury.

"Roar!"

The tiger demon paid no heed, commanding its wraiths to attack indiscriminately.

"Boom!"

"Crash!"

In an instant, a chaotic three-way battle erupted in the forest.

Bian Chuyao watched the spectacle in stunned silence, her gaze repeatedly darting to Gu Yuan, who stood with his hands behind his back, observing calmly.

The skirmish raged for some time before finally concluding. The tiger and its wraiths lay slain. Of the initial white-robed cultivators, two had perished, while the survivors were grievously wounded. The two bandits, though injured, wore expressions of vicious triumph.

"Fang Bai, you've become a bandit?!" one of the white-robed cultivators spat.

"So what if I have? Without turning to this, how could someone of my talent reach the ninth level of Qi Refining?"

"Only fools like you would rush into Yunlan Valley. Ambushing you here is far more efficient!"

The lead bandit sneered, gathering energy for a final strike.

"Roar!"

"Clang!"

But then, an invisible roar and the hum of sword energy filled the air. The bandits' faces contorted in panic as they tried to defend—but their injuries left them sluggish. The silver dragon was upon them in an instant, churning their spiritual seas into turmoil.

Stunned, they stood frozen as peach blossoms swirled around them, reducing them to mincemeat.

"Whoosh!"

The surviving white-robed cultivators gaped at the sudden turn of events—only for a crimson dragon to descend, incinerating the bandits' remains to ash. A tall, handsome figure in Daoist robes stepped forward, collecting the fallen storage pouches.

"Yunlan Mountain is perilous. The two of you are too naive—leave at once."

With a wave of his hand, a gust of spiritual energy sent the wounded cultivators tumbling down the mountain. Helpless, they could only watch as Gu Yuan's figure receded into the distance—their companions' bodies reduced to ashes, their belongings now in his grasp.

Bian Chuyao stood dumbfounded, as though struggling to process what had just occurred. Meanwhile, Gu Yuan efficiently cleared the battlefield in mere moments before continuing onward.

Only then did Bian Chuyao snap out of her daze, hurrying after him.

But shortly before reaching a jade pavilion, Gu Yuan stopped again. Without explanation, he strode to an ancient tree ten zhang away and yanked out a short figure hiding within. In less than a dozen breaths, the would-be ambusher was dead, their corpse burned, their storage pouch claimed.

"Senior... Senior Brother," Bian Chuyao finally murmured, her voice trembling slightly, "what exactly did you do before joining the Daoist Academy?"

"A cultivator's only occupation is secluded meditation in the mountains..." Gu Yuan shook his head before turning toward a secluded path, avoiding the pavilion entirely.

"Senior Brother, that's the wrong way! Yunlan Valley isn't there!"

Bian Chuyao's thoughts were in disarray, but she managed to voice the correction.

"No matter. I know a shortcut..."

Without looking back, Gu Yuan strode forward confidently.
