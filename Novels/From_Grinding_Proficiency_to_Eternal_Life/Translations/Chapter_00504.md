# Chapter 504: The Clone's Assistance in Cultivation

The shock and fear left in the hearts of all witnesses within the pass were as deeply imprinted as a brand.

From that moment on, those who had been restless due to the Garrison Commander's long-standing neglect of worldly affairs, or who had secretly planned to test his limits, pay lip service while acting contrary, or even scheme in the dark—be it local cultivation families, traveling merchant guild stewards, or unruly rogue cultivators—all instantly retracted their petty thoughts. Each became more well-behaved and cautious than ever before.

These people finally understood completely.

That Garrison Commander was not powerless to govern, nor was he cowardly or easily bullied.

He was simply too lazy to bother with those trivial matters. As long as the annual taxes and tributes were delivered to the Garrison Treasury in full and on time, without disturbing his secluded cultivation or undermining his fundamental control over the pass, he couldn't be bothered to expend energy dealing with them personally.

Naturally, Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to pay any mind to this. Even if he knew of these petty thoughts, he didn't care.

In this gathering place of myriad demons and unruly true cultivators of the demonic path like Cold Crow Pass, Xu Yunfan was well aware. If these demonic path true cultivators didn't have a few petty thoughts of testing limits, paying lip service while acting contrary, or even secretly plotting, it would be strange and abnormal.

If they were truly honest and obedient, Xu Yunfan would have to spend extra effort to see what they were really doing. If they ended up causing a huge mess, the trouble would be immense.

Xu Yunfan's logic was simple.

Behave and pay your fees, and everything will be peaceful.

Dare to cause trouble, and Xu Yunfan will naturally deal with it.

With his current cultivation and strength, he was fully capable of suppressing everything in Cold Crow Pass.

For Xu Yunfan, this was merely an interlude. If the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect dared to send more people, Xu Yunfan would naturally seek aid from the Primordial Origin Sect. If this sparked a great war between the two sects, he would be very pleased.

Being able to muddy these stagnant waters meant he could find a way to fish in troubled waters. With his clones, Sun Wukong and Han Shi, there might be some unexpected gains.

During the intervening ten years, the vast majority of his mind was devoted to the arduous cultivation of his main body, but his attention to his clones never ceased.

And Xu Yunfan's clone, Sun Wukong, was no longer alone, thanks to the full support of the Bodhi Pure Land.

After Sun Wukong, Sanzang took on a second disciple, Sha Wujing. Originally a formidable water demon causing trouble in the Flowing Sands River of the Western Deserts, he was subdued by Sun Wukong using the *Great Mightiness Bright King Battle Buddha Sutra*. Moved by the Buddhist connection, he converted and took the dharma name Wujing. He wields a Crescent Moon Treasure Spade and excels at controlling water.

Later, they took on another disciple with the daoist name of Wuneng.

When Xu Yunfan first observed Wuneng's traces, he was quite surprised.

This demon's original form was a strange black-maned boar demon, but its origins seemed rather extraordinary.

It dwelled in a place called Cloud Ridge Cave on Fuling Mountain in the Eastern Wastes, calling itself "Zhu Ganglie." Not only did it possess immense strength, but it also harbored a few strange techniques for movement and transformation, as well as a devouring ability. Its temperament was quite lazy, slippery, yet shrewd.

Sun Wukong had quite a bit of trouble fighting it.

Although this boar demon was fierce and stubborn, it hadn't committed any great evil or accumulated heavy karma. Instead, it got along "harmoniously" with some local minor spirits.

Following Sanzang's guidance, Sun Wukong used the grand Buddhist intent of the *Great Mightiness Bright King Battle Buddha Sutra*, supplemented by Buddhist teachings to enlighten it. He also promised it the positive outcome of being a protector on the eastward journey, finally managing to subdue this lazy creature. He bestowed the name Wuneng and taught it part of the secret arts of a Vajra Protector.

Wuneng wields a Nine-Toothed Rake. Although its appearance is strange, it conceals profound magical restrictions.

Thus, with Sanzang in the lead and the three disciples Sun Wukong, Wuneng, and Wujing following, the group of four hacked through thorns and brambles. They traveled along a route that seemed pre-planned yet full of variables, traversing the vast and chaotic Eastern Wastes.

Xu Yunfan naturally watched silently from the sidelines, feeling in his heart a sense of déjà vu reminiscent of the *Journey to the West* he had read in his previous life.

"Both involve Buddhism spreading eastward, both feature a master and three disciples, both undertake a journey with grand vows."

He pondered deeply. There must be some significance to this, but with his current strength, he couldn't probe into it yet.

As the group of four, Sanzang and his disciples, journeyed, they slew demons and subdued monsters, cleansing turbid energy and resolving resentment.

What moved Xu Yunfan's main body the most was the terrifying combat instinct displayed by his clone, Sun Wukong.

Sun Wukong's foundation, built upon the *Great Mightiness Bright King Battle Buddha Sutra*, was incredibly solid.

But his true terror lay in his combat prowess.

That seemed to be an innate battle consciousness, etched into his very essence. His movements were devoid of flashiness, yet precise to the extreme. Dodging, attacking, and bursting with power—he launched lethal attacks from the most impossible positions.

The "Purple Gold Sea-Subduing Staff" in his hand seemed to come alive. Poking, thrusting, sweeping, and smashing, it was wreathed in the flames of the Bright King and the power to subdue demons. His techniques were simplified from complexity, pursuing only the most direct and efficient damage.

Having just entered the Foundation Establishment stage after refining the Heavenly and Earthly Evils, he could already identify the weaknesses of mid-stage Foundation Establishment demons. Using his supreme strength and speed to forcefully break through their defenses, he fought against higher realms, displaying ferocity unparalleled. His formidable physical body was like divine iron.

It was as if he was born for battle, completely inheriting the combat experience and divine consciousness accumulated by Xu Yunfan's main body through countless panel enhancements and the extreme optimization of cultivation techniques.

But then again...

"His talent... isn't it my talent?!"

Xu Yunfan's clone, Han Shi, also possessed unimaginable potential in the Way of the Sword. Part of that potential, in Sun Wukong's comprehension of the *Great Mightiness Bright King Battle Buddha Sutra* and his battles, transformed into a battle prowess that shook antiquity and astonished the present!

The resources invested by the Bodhi Pure Land further catalyzed this potential to its extreme.

The clone's feedback, in turn, caused Xu Yunfan's own strength to increase significantly.

Although his Daoist cultivation hadn't risen, his actual combat power far surpassed that of the past.

On this day, after Xu Yunfan's main body finished a round of tempering his golden body with thunder and fire, he habitually extended his mind towards the location of his clone.

The vision-sharing connection was instantly established.

What greeted his eyes was not the familiar barren mountains or demon nests, but an ancient Daoist temple perched atop a mist-shrouded peak.

This temple had an extraordinary aura.

It was built according to the mountain's terrain, with upturned eaves and bucket arches, green tiles and red ridges, appearing and disappearing amidst the swirling spiritual energy.

A winding stone staircase stretched down from the depths of the clouds before the temple, with moss faintly visible, exuding a sense of vicissitudes.

The area around the Daoist temple was lush with trees, mostly sturdy pines and cypresses, coiled like dragons and serpents. Their branches and trunks seemed to contain ancient spirituality, radiating vibrant life.

Even more strangely, pure energy swirled both inside and outside the Daoist temple. A single breath made one feel refreshed and cleansed of worldly dust, completely different from the chaotic turbid energy common in the Eastern Wastes. It was truly like a celestial abode fallen into the mortal world.

Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly.

The Eastern Wastes were filled with demons, and chaotic, turbid energy flowed freely. Something as conspicuous as this celestial sanctuary was definitely abnormal.

Sun Wukong, the clone, also felt the place was abrupt and was secretly on guard. Just then, he heard Sanzang's voice beside him, calm yet carrying a hint of imperceptible gravity.

"Amitabha. Sun Wukong, Wuneng, Wujing."
