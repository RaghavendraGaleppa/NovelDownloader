# Chapter 29: The Dilemma  

Having mastered the most challenging Ice Needle Technique, the final Wind Riding Spell proved much easier—relatively speaking, of course. It still took Lin Xuan nearly a week to perfect.  

Cultivators who reached the Foundation Establishment stage could ride spiritual artifacts, covering thousands of miles in a single day. Disciples at the Qi Refining stage lacked such capabilities, but the Wind Riding Spell was still extraordinary. For Lin Xuan, a single movement could carry him nearly fifty meters, and he could leap effortlessly to heights of twenty meters.  

To ordinary people, traveling with the Wind Riding Spell was akin to flying. Moreover, mastering this auxiliary spell also greatly enhanced his physical agility—calm as still water, swift as a fleeing hare. The benefits were undeniable.  

The perfect combination of offensive, defensive, and auxiliary spells had significantly boosted Lin Xuan's strength.  

After over a month of cultivation, breaking through to the fifth layer and entering the late Qi Refining stage still required time. However, with the dual support of elixirs and relentless effort, the spiritual energy within Lin Xuan's body had grown considerably. Each day, after his cultivation sessions, he continued experimenting with his spiritual artifact.  

Day after day, time flew by.  

Lin Xuan held the Golden Binding Rope, giving it a light flick as he channeled his spiritual energy into it. Instantly, the rope elongated, twisting and coiling through the air like a serpent under the guidance of his divine sense.  

"Strike!"  

With a point of his finger, the Golden Binding Rope accurately coiled around a large tree ahead. This was the secluded valley—practicing with spiritual artifacts indoors was too restrictive, so Lin Xuan had secretly come to this desolate place.  

After painstaking effort, he had finally mastered this mid-grade spiritual artifact. Yet, as he gazed at the rope coiled around the tree, Lin Xuan remained silent.  

Standing still for a long moment, he finally raised his hand and recalled the Golden Binding Rope, his expression thoughtful.  

"It seems the Object Manipulation Technique truly isn't enough."  

On the surface, Lin Xuan wielded the Golden Binding Rope with apparent skill. However, according to written records and tales from the sect elders, the true power of a mid-grade spiritual artifact far exceeded what he could currently unleash—he was barely tapping into ten to twenty percent of its potential.  

The issue wasn’t a lack of spiritual energy but rather the method of control.  

The Object Manipulation Technique, while functional, was the most basic and rudimentary method—merely an entry-level skill. To truly unleash the artifact’s power, a more advanced technique was required.  

Yet, a dilemma now stood before Lin Xuan: such techniques couldn’t be learned in the Novice Pavilion.  

The next step up from the Object Manipulation Technique was the Spirit Control Technique, a mid-level skill in the cultivation world, stored on the second floor of the Scripture Pavilion. Access required meeting one of two conditions:  

1. Successfully reaching the Foundation Establishment stage and becoming a high-ranking cultivator within the sect. Lin Xuan immediately dismissed this option—the path of cultivation wasn’t so simple. Even with his ample supply of elixirs, reaching Foundation Establishment would still take considerable time.  

2. As a Qi Refining disciple, if one possessed exceptional talent and owned a spiritual artifact, they could petition the sect leader for permission to access the second floor and study the Spirit Control Technique.  

On the surface, this seemed feasible. However, given Lin Xuan’s circumstances, it was a dead end. If he petitioned the sect leader, he would undoubtedly face an evaluation. While his current cultivation level placed him among the top disciples who had entered the valley with him, barely meeting the requirements, there was one glaring issue:  

Lin Xuan wasn’t a genius. On the contrary, he was utterly ordinary—lacking even a spiritual root.  

A disciple without a spiritual root surpassing most of his peers? If word spread, the shrewd elders would undoubtedly grow suspicious.  

What if they discovered the Star Sea within his dantian?  

Lin Xuan wasn’t foolish enough to walk into such a trap.  

His original purpose in scheming to become an overseer at Danxia Mountain was primarily for the discarded pills, but that wasn’t the only reason. Another was to disappear into obscurity, drawing no attention.  

The discarded pill repository was rarely visited, and those who volunteered to oversee it were typically low-level disciples with no hope of advancing. Hiding among them, Lin Xuan aroused no suspicion—safe and free to cultivate in peace.  

His decision had been a stroke of brilliance, serving two purposes: securing a steady supply of pills while improving his cultivation unnoticed.  

Of course, it wasn’t foolproof. The only potential risk was attending lectures at the Novice Pavilion.  

But that was unavoidable—he had to learn the techniques. Still, Lin Xuan was cautious, always choosing the most secluded spots.  

To discern another’s cultivation level required using divine sense, an act considered hostile in the cultivation world. Thus, few dared to do so.  

Months had passed, and Lin Xuan’s cultivation had soared from the first to the fourth layer, yet no one had noticed.  

Now, faced with the two conditions for accessing the Scripture Pavilion—either unattainable or too risky—Lin Xuan encountered an unprecedented dilemma.  

Should he continue using the Object Manipulation Technique to control his spiritual artifact? Though functional, it barely unleashed a fraction of its power—a waste of its potential. Lin Xuan refused to accept that.  

Moreover, even disregarding the artifact, as his cultivation progressed, he would inevitably need more advanced techniques. For cultivators, spiritual energy was the foundation, but techniques dictated its application. Only by combining the two could one display true prowess.  

Though Lin Xuan lacked a spiritual root, his mind was sharp—otherwise, he wouldn’t have planned his every move so meticulously. But now, he was truly stumped.  

Of course, unlike others who might wallow in frustration, Lin Xuan knew despair solved nothing. Each day, he continued his routine—cultivating, refining pills, progressing step by step.  

Only in his spare moments did he ponder how to overcome this obstacle.

**Glossary of Terms:**  

- **Spells:** Techniques used by cultivators to attack, defend, or assist, categorized as low-tier, mid-tier, or high-tier. Typically employed by Qi Refining or Foundation Establishment cultivators, as higher-level cultivators rely on more powerful spiritual artifacts or treasures.  

- **Cultivation Techniques:** Unlike spells, these are methods for refining spiritual energy. Different techniques correspond to different stages, from Qi Refining to the Tribulation Transcendence stage. To draw a parallel with martial arts novels, spells are akin to specific fist, palm, or leg techniques, while cultivation techniques are like internal energy formulas. Though any formula can generate internal energy, rarer ones produce purer, more potent energy. Similarly, in cultivation, advanced techniques refine spiritual energy more effectively, with distinct circulation paths through the meridians at each stage.
