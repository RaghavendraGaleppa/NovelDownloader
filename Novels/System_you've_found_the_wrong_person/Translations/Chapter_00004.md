# Chapter 4: The Peerless Patriot  

The world was in decline, and people's hearts were no longer as pure as before.  

Dou Changsheng admired the Black Eagle Venerable as a senior figure. However, this elder was now using his decades of cultivation to coerce a helpless eighteen-year-old youth.  

The Black Eagle Venerable’s slender hand clamped down on Dou Changsheng like an iron vise, rendering his struggles futile. Despite his efforts, Dou Changsheng couldn’t break free. The elder’s frail appearance belied his immense strength, as if he possessed the power of nine bulls and two tigers. In a contest of brute force, Dou Changsheng was utterly outmatched.  

This also made Dou Changsheng realize that the Black Eagle Venerable was primarily an external martial artist who had only recently stepped into the postliminary realm.  

What rotten luck.  

Dou Changsheng felt a deep bitterness in his heart.  

The situation was clear: the Black Eagle Venerable had mistaken him for a disciple of the Wang Clan of Xiangzhou, here to lend support. His denials were dismissed as mere attempts to distance himself from the Wang Clan.  

But the truth was—he had no connection to the Wang Clan whatsoever!  

Well, not entirely.  

In the future, he would marry a Wang Clan daughter, earn their favor, and be taught the *Triple Origin Reunion Art*, which would grant him a month’s worth of cultivation—specifically, the innate qi produced by the art.  

Now, even if he jumped into the Yellow River, he couldn’t wash himself clean of this misunderstanding.  

Dou Changsheng wanted to sigh at the heavens. Why did the Black Eagle Venerable have to be so sharp-eyed?  

Once again, he had been dragged onto a pirate ship. This time, the danger was far greater than when he had joined Wang Xiong in plundering military pay.  

In the future, his alternate self had enjoyed countless strokes of luck, breezing through life on easy mode. But now, he had sacrificed that fortune to gain the system’s favor.  

The harsh reality was cold and unyielding, yet Dou Changsheng had no choice but to accept it. He could only console himself with pretty words.  

The conflict ended as abruptly as it had begun, the crowd dispersing in less than an hour. It was still morning—breakfast time.  

The Black Eagle Venerable led Dou Changsheng through a maze of winding alleyways until they vanished into the labyrinthine streets. Dou Changsheng had no idea where they were going, his mind a blur.  

The Black Eagle Venerable explained slowly, “Right now, we’re carrying the military pay for the Sword Gate Pass garrison. Everyone’s eyes are on us.”  

“Countless people are watching. Don’t be fooled by Ling Qianxu’s smooth talk. The fact that a Golden Feather Guard commander is stationed in a small town like Jun County is suspicious in itself.”  

“The military funds for Sword Gate Pass have strained the Northern Command’s treasury. They could’ve barely scraped it together, but with the Grand General imprisoned, chaos erupted. Opportunists seized the moment, spreading panic and creating a financial shortfall.”  

“It was the Invincible Iron Fist, Elder Yuan, who sacrificed himself—cutting his own flesh to fill the gap.”  

“He was a Pure Yang Grandmaster!”  

“Already advanced in years, that self-inflicted wound drained his Pure Yang blood, shortening his lifespan drastically.”  

“The Grand General exhausted himself, and countless righteous souls sacrificed everything. The border armies fought to the death to secure a decade of peace.”  

“But the emperor is a fool, bewitched by his concubine, allowing treacherous ministers to ruin the state. If the late emperor were still alive, none of this would’ve happened.”  

Dou Changsheng listened to these insider revelations, finding them absurd. He couldn’t help but ask, “Isn’t Sword Gate Pass the court’s? Aren’t the border troops the court’s? Doesn’t the court allocate funds?”  

The Black Eagle Venerable suddenly halted, turning to glare at Dou Changsheng with fury. “Of course the court allocated funds!”  

“But the shipment was buried under a landslide less than a thousand li from the capital. When they dug it out, every last tael of silver was gone.”  

“The court isn’t refusing to pay—it’s just that the sum is enormous, and they need time to gather it again. But how long that takes depends entirely on the treacherous minister’s whims.”  

“He can wait. The northern border can’t. Sword Gate Pass can’t.”  

“The previous Khan of the Hu barbarians launched countless invasions, only to be repelled by the Grand General every time. Deemed incompetent, he was killed by the new Khan, who turned his skull into a chamber pot.”  

“The new Khan has conquered all before him, uniting hundreds of tribes under his banner. He’s hailed as a once-in-a-millennium conqueror.”  

“Having consolidated his power, he now turns his gaze southward. With a flick of his whip, hundreds of thousands of cavalry will descend. If Sword Gate Pass falls, the north will be overrun—and the court will crumble.”  

“Damnation!”  

“Our enemies grow stronger by the day, while we grow weaker.”  

“The Great Jin has stood for centuries, yet now teeters on the brink. The foolish emperor indulges in pleasure while imprisoning the only man who could save us—the Grand General!”  

The hearts of the northern people were lost.  

Dou Changsheng studied the Black Eagle Venerable’s twisted, almost demonic expression. It was clear that the Grand General’s decade of peace had won him the loyalty of the north—commoners, noble clans, martial sects, all revered him.  

It was also proof that the Grand General was a man of action. Otherwise, why would the northerners trust him so?  

The Black Eagle Venerable led Dou Changsheng into a secluded courtyard. “The treacherous minister has been appointing outsiders to govern the north these past years.”  

“What do they know?”  

“If the north falls, they’ll just pack up and leave. It’s us northerners who’ll suffer.”  

“Yet some have been bribed into serving the treacherous minister. That Ironclad Mad Lion, Wang Xiong—don’t believe his claim about joining the Southern Chen’s Heavenly Demon Sect.”  

“The north is thousands of miles from Southern Chen. A wanted man like him, with no backing, couldn’t possibly make it there.”  

“No mere postliminary martial artist could. Wang Xiong has likely been recruited by the treacherous minister—now one of his lackeys.”  

“That’s how he tracked me down to ambush and steal the military pay.”  

“The fate of millions in the north now rests on our shoulders.”  

Dou Changsheng sighed inwardly. He had somehow become the Great Jin’s weightlifting champion.  

His tension eased slightly when he spotted another figure—a man in white robes, around twenty-five or twenty-six, with sharp brows and bright eyes. He held an ornate sword sheath adorned with gemstones, impossible to overlook.  

The Black Eagle Venerable introduced him. “This is Tang He from the Southern Chen, who joined the Northern Command three years ago.”  

“He’s a disciple of the Heavenly Sword Sect, a major martial school in the south.”  

Despite his noble bearing, Tang He was unpretentious. “As a child, I heard tales of the Grand General’s legendary campaign against the Hu barbarians and was inspired.”  

“After mastering my skills, I traveled the world and realized the Hu were even more brutal than I’d imagined. So I came north to join the fight.”  

Dou Changsheng studied Tang He. This southerner, born in the lush lands of the south, was more passionate about defending the north than he was.  

Of course, Dou Changsheng knew why—he was a transmigrator with no attachment to this land. If it were the Japanese instead, he’d be far more fervent than Tang He.  

The Black Eagle Venerable continued, “This is Dou Changsheng from the north. Like you, he’s an innate realm martial artist.”  

“But Brother Dou’s situation is unique—he only knows innate qi and no martial techniques, so his combat power is limited.”  

Tang He smiled. “I understand, Elder. The Heavenly Sword Sect’s techniques can’t be shared.”  

“But I’ve acquired other legacies during my travels. I can teach Brother Dou a thing or two.”  

“Since he uses a sword, I happen to have a manual—”  

Before he could finish, the Black Eagle Venerable coughed. “Do you have anything compatible with the *Triple Origin Reunion Art*?”  

“This young friend stumbled upon the art and focused solely on it, reaching the innate realm at a young age. But his lack of versatility is a weakness.”  

Tang He’s eyes widened. “The *Triple Origin Reunion Art*? The Wang Clan’s signature technique?”  

He quickly changed the subject, his gaze now filled with admiration. A Wang Clan disciple! All his doubts about Dou Changsheng vanished.  

In these turbulent times, only a southerner like himself could be trusted. Everyone else was suspect—except the Wang Clan. The *Triple Origin Reunion Art* ensured their integrity. The clan’s rise was built on aligning their martial path with their virtues.  

You could deceive others, but not yourself.  

Martial arts revealed the truth.  

Tang He grew friendlier. “The *Triple Origin Reunion Art* is a top-tier technique. Starting is easy, but progress requires embodying one of three virtues: courage, loyalty, or love.”  

“To master it, you must embrace all three, unifying them into one.”  

“Which virtue guides you, Brother Dou?”  

Dou Changsheng wanted to say he didn’t know the art, but he knew they wouldn’t believe him. This misunderstanding brought great risk—but also immediate benefits. Tang He’s warmth was proof of the Wang Clan’s influence.  

Thinking of his future self—standing alone against Wang Xiong, battling demons with nothing but a sword—it all spoke of one word:  

“Courage.”  

Tang He nodded. “As I thought.”  

“Only a man of courage would dare transport military pay.”  

“The journey is perilous. Even if you reach Sword Gate Pass, you’ll face the garrison commander’s scrutiny. Surviving all that still earns you the enmity of the treacherous minister and the Hu barbarians.”  

“Not like me—once this is over, I’ll return to Southern Chen.”  

“No matter how powerful the minister or the Hu, they can’t touch a Heavenly Sword Sect disciple there.”  

“That’s why I admire you, Brother Dou. For your selfless sacrifice—forsaking your clan’s protection, risking your life for the north.”  

“Men like you are the pillars of righteousness.”  

Dou Changsheng raised a hand to stop him. He hadn’t done anything yet, and here he was being eulogized.  

Damn it all.  

Reputation and reality should match. When reputation outstripped reality, disaster followed.  

If he were truly an innate realm expert, he’d have little to fear. But he was a fraud—his innate qi was real, but his skills were nonexistent.  

Martial arts were simple in classification: postliminary and innate. Postliminary practitioners, whether internal or external, had to unblock their meridians step by step before breaking through to the innate realm.  

Dou Changsheng’s predicament? He had innate qi without a single unblocked meridian. Stronger than postliminary, weaker than innate—and utterly lacking in techniques.  

With a year of proper training, he could’ve been a rising star. Instead, he was caught in a vortex of national upheaval.  

He glanced at his system—no changes.  

No help there.  

The system had just arrived, granting him innate qi with its first task. Expecting more was unrealistic—but hope lingered.  

The Black Eagle Venerable spoke gravely. “The city’s crawling with spies. We can’t leave yet, and Brother Dou needs time to train.”  

“Jun County is only ten days from Sword Gate Pass. We have a month—I’ll lay false trails for ten days to mislead our pursuers before we depart.”  

“I’ll handle the outside world. Brother Tang, you’ll train him here.”  

As the elder left, Tang He smiled. “After some thought, I have an innate sword technique—one only a man of great courage, ready to die, can learn.”  

“It’s perfect for you.”  

“I could never master it myself. It seems fate reserved it for you.”  

“Let’s begin with the first stance: Charge Forward!”  

“Then the second: Stand and Die!”
