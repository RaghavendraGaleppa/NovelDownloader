# Chapter 35: Boarding the Ship, Unexplained Hostility

A dazzling golden light shot straight up, radiant and brilliant, burning so intensely in Gu Yuan's vision that it nearly blinded him.

Golden legend!

Gu Yuan never expected that a simple turn of his head would reveal such a spectacular sight.

A pure golden light spot, devoid of any impurities, hovered quietly in the depths of the great river, exuding an extraordinary aura.

"There's actually a golden light spot!"

"This is an opportunity that can defy fate and change destiny!"

Gu Yuan couldn't help but take a sharp breath.

He had sought survival, joined the prestigious Daoist academy of the Southern Mountain Region, and formed a karmic connection with a Golden Core elder—yet all he had obtained was a silver light with a faint golden hue. Now, a pure golden opportunity lay before him. What kind of fortune could this be?

Could it be the chance to directly rely on a Dao Embryo's influence and become a personal disciple under their tutelage?

Or perhaps some extraordinary treasure or immortal seal capable of defying the heavens?

Countless thoughts raced through Gu Yuan's mind, his imagination running wild.

It had been a long time since his composure had been so thoroughly shaken.

After taking several deep breaths, Gu Yuan finally calmed his turbulent emotions, only to furrow his brows immediately after.

"The location of this golden opportunity... seems too deep?"

Although the Yunya Shell Field bordered the Nine Rivers Great Marsh, it was itself a vast territory. From Gu Yuan's perspective, the golden light spot was hidden extremely deep, seemingly penetrating beyond the field's boundaries into the underground depths.

The distance was considerable.

Gu Yuan silently estimated it and felt a sense of foreboding.

"It seems to have already passed through the shell field and lies deep within the water veins?"

If it were merely within the shell field, Gu Yuan might still have some chance. But if it were deep within the water veins, the water pressure alone could crush a Qi Refinement cultivator to death—it was no place for ordinary people to venture.

"Haah!"

Gu Yuan exhaled deeply, suppressing his unease, and continued observing.

The shell field was filled with dense white light spots, growing brighter the deeper they went.

Amidst the sea of white light spots, occasional green lights shimmered, particularly eye-catching.

Gu Yuan knew these were the shell jades that could enhance cultivation.

In the shell field, ordinary shell jades could enhance a month's worth of cultivation, hence their white color, while shell kings—capable of breaking through cultivation bottlenecks—were green.

But soon, Gu Yuan made another discovery.

Among the dense light spots, a silver glow shone brilliantly, radiating a divine luster.

Though all the light spots were overshadowed by the dazzling golden light, this silver gleam still captivated the mind.

"There's even a half-silver light spot?!"

"Is the shell field truly so abundant with opportunities?"

---

Gu Yuan couldn't help but murmur as he took in the sight before him.

Golden and silver opportunities appearing together—truly rare.

"Haah!"

As the effects of the stone liquid faded, the world before Gu Yuan's eyes returned to normal. The distant marsh and great river were no longer visible to his naked eye.

Yet, the spectacular scene he had just witnessed lingered in his mind.

Had it been ordinary white or green opportunities, Gu Yuan would have undoubtedly stayed in the mountains to cultivate—after all, it was safer.

But how could he pass up such an opportunity?

"Enough hesitation—Yunya Shell Field, here I come!"

With his mind made up, Gu Yuan wasted no time. He mounted his Cloud-Treading Shuttle and returned to the Hidden Dragon Hall to register his name in the Crimson Gold Jade Register.

---

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Inside his White Egret Island cave abode, Gu Yuan sat cross-legged with two bronze cauldrons placed before him.

One emitted a fragrant aroma, its milky-white fish broth rich and appetizing, making one's mouth water.

The other contained grayish-white powder mixed with black miasma, bubbling with a pungent odor.

"Gulp, gulp, gulp!"

A fair and slender hand, infused with spiritual energy, lifted the delicious fish broth and drank it all in one go.

The fish meat melted like water in his mouth, devoid of any bones. The scalding, savory broth transformed into surging spiritual energy that flowed through his dantian. Gu Yuan's face immediately flushed red, only returning to normal after a long while.

"Senior Brother Ding is truly generous. These three silver fish are all top-grade—just these alone are equivalent to two months of hard cultivation."

Feeling the abundant spiritual energy within him, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile.

With only three days left before departure to the Crimson Moon Great River, there wasn't much for Gu Yuan to prepare.

His pockets were empty, leaving him unable to acquire any powerful magical tools.

There were only two things he could do.

First, naturally, was consuming these three silver fish to gain two months' worth of cultivation and further strengthen his spiritual energy.

Second, was the pungent bronze cauldron before him.

"Spirit-Eroding Lime."

"This is a special lime refined from the residue of the Demon Star Stone Mine and demonic miasma. It can corrode spiritual energy and erode flesh. Back in the Demon Star Stone Cave, even though Senior Brother Yang was restrained by the Spirit-Severing Ring, this substance could still penetrate the defenses of a ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivator—its potency is evident."

"Though somewhat underhanded, having this on hand will provide extra security for this journey."

Watching the boiling "Spirit-Eroding Lime" in the cauldron finally condense into gray powder, Gu Yuan couldn't help but chuckle.

The trip to Yunya Shell Field was somewhat risky, so Gu Yuan had to prepare as thoroughly as possible.

Not only would he face the demonic creatures in the shell field, but he might also have to contend with "fellow cultivators."

After storing the "Spirit-Eroding Lime," Gu Yuan left his cave abode, mounted his Cloud-Treading Shuttle, and flew toward the Hidden Dragon Hall.

---

Nine treasure ships floated silently before the Hidden Dragon Hall.

Each ship was enormous, covered in spiritual inscriptions and restrictions, with strange Daoist patterns carved into their hulls. The prows bore a single sharp, sword-like "fang."

It was precisely because of this fang that these ships were named "Fangtooth Treasure Ships."

Though recently, they seemed to have been renamed "Dragonfang Treasure Ships."

The nine ships were arranged in order from left to right, each carrying disciples of different cultivation levels—from the first to the ninth level of Qi Refinement.

Following his own cultivation level, Gu Yuan boarded the middle ship.

Dozens of disciples were already aboard, standing in small groups. They glanced at Gu Yuan as he arrived, but since he was new to the sect and had kept to himself, no one recognized him. After a brief look, they averted their eyes.

This journey to demon territory carried risks, and unless they were acquainted, no one would strike up conversations.

But one person's eyes lit up.

"Senior Brother Gu!"

He stepped forward and greeted Gu Yuan enthusiastically.

"It's you?!"

Gu Yuan turned to see a tall but extremely thin man who seemed malnourished, yet his smile carried a hint of unrestrained charm.

It was the other fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator present when Gu Yuan and Lan Tianlu had competed for the cave abode.

At the time, Gu Yuan had played the role of a "Golden Core disciple," while Lan Tianlu had acted as the "Lan family's direct descendant." Both had ignored this man.

But a cultivator's memory was sharp—even a passing glance was enough to remember him.

"I never expected Senior Brother to also be heading to Yunya Shell Field? Noble families and Golden Core disciples usually have their own trial grounds."

"Only us common disciples from the Hidden Dragon Academy take on these grueling missions to subdue demon territories."

"Even under these special circumstances, the noble families and direct disciples are traveling on 'Stellar Cloud Treasure Ships.' With Elder Hu's recommendation, why are you here?"

"Could this be Elder Hu's trial for you?"

The man spoke with evident surprise.

Before Gu Yuan could respond, a fair-skinned youth wearing a jade pendant at his waist, standing behind the man, suddenly paled at the mention of "Elder Hu."

"So you're the one Elder Hu recommended for admission?"

The youth's gaze turned sharp as he glanced between the tall man and Gu Yuan, then sneered.

"Senior Brother Yang, if you're trying to climb the social ladder, you've knocked on the wrong door. This guy merely got lucky solving the mystery of Aunt Linglong's death and earned Elder Hu's favor."

"Do you really think Elder Hu has any real connection with him?"

"He's just a lucky survivor from a wiped-out minor sect!"

As he spoke, his eyes turned cold, a faint trace of killing intent flickering within them.
