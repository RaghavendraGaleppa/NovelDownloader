# Chapter 53: Robbery Without Money

The old woman’s eyes widened in horror; she instantly realized she was doomed. Her feet scrambled beneath her, desperate to turn and flee. As she prepared to fling the toxic sand from her sleeves, she suddenly saw Xu Yunfan retract his hammer and extend a claw-like hand.

Bloodshot eyes stared as the palm, as large as a cattail fan, clamped onto the head of her staff. The old woman felt a searing pain in her tiger’s mouth; the century-old ironwood staff was actually cracking under the crushing force of five fingers.

The ringed muscles on Xu Yunfan’s arm contracted violently, and the old woman was swung around and smashed into the cliff face. Before the sound of her skull cracking against the stone could fade, a whip-like leg swept out and shattered her left wrist, the one meant to deploy poison.

Gritting her teeth against the agony, the old woman spewed a mouthful of blood and spun her staff into a defensive circle protecting her face. However, the ironwood could not withstand the subsequent impact of the heavy hammer; with a sharp crack, it snapped into four pieces.

Xu Yunfan spun and kicked up a section of the fallen staff. A three-foot-long wooden stake pierced the old woman’s chest, carrying a spray of blood as it nailed her firmly to a cypress tree.

She was clearly dead.

Knowing he couldn't outrun Xu Yunfan, the Iron-Faced Man realized that fleeing was a death sentence. Suddenly, the judge’s writing brush in his left hand exploded, sending twelve bone-piercing needles shooting out in a "Heavenly Maiden Scatters Flowers" formation.

"Coming back for more?"

Xu Yunfan’s laughter shook the pine needles loose from the trees. His entire skin took on a bronze luster. He didn't dodge or evade but charged straight through the barrage of hidden weapons. The needles scraped sparks off his copper-like body. His lotus-pod-sized feet stomped the frozen earth into cracks as he charged across the snowy field like a war chariot.

By the time the Iron-Faced Man took his eighth panicked step backward, Xu Yunfan’s heavy hammer had already shattered his chest mirror. The residual force turned his internal organs into mush, sending him flying into the distance where he lay motionless.

The hemp-clothed youth had already begun to madly scramble down the mountain the moment the Iron-Faced Man’s fingers were broken, his deer-skin boots leaving chaotic tracks on the ice.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath. As he pushed his Copper Body Technique to its limit, the vital energy and blood within him boiled like water, enveloping him in a steaming white mist.

He took a step forward. A sudden, immense force surged from the heel of his rear foot, passing layer by layer through his body as his muscles writhed, transmitting up to his arms.

The sound of the heavy hammer tearing through the air was like a thunderclap. The War Drum Gold Hammer shot out like a bolt from a heavy crossbow, snapping three white birch trees in half without losing its momentum.

Hearing the vicious wind behind him, the hemp-clothed youth’s soul nearly fled his body. In the instant he clumsily threw himself to the ground, the two-hundred-and-twenty-pound refined steel heavy hammer grazed his hair bun, reducing a boulder the size of a sleeping ox into dust.

"Grandfather, spare me!"

The youth wailed as he collapsed into a snowdrift, a pungent, yellow stain spreading beneath his crotch.

Xu Yunfan trudged through the snow, approaching slowly. Every step left a deep inch-deep footprint in the heavy accumulation.

He lifted the heavy hammer with one hand. The wolf-tooth spikes on the hammer head were still挂着半片带血的肺叶 (half a bloody lung lobe).

With a slight shake of his wrist, a surge of force vibrated the refined steel hammer as if it were a spring, shaking the shredded meat off the wolf-tooth spikes.

"You run fast."

The hammer handle suddenly swept horizontally; the youth’s knees shattered with a crisp sound.

Amidst the agonizing screams, Xu Yunfan stepped on the youth’s thigh. Adding pain to pain, the hemp-clothed youth’s scream turned into a sound as凄厉难听 (harsh and unpleasant) as a beast crying blood.

"If you keep screaming, you’ll really die."

The hemp-clothed youth’s wailing cut off abruptly. Even though his body trembled uncontrollably with pain, he clenched his teeth and remained silent.

Xu Yunfan’s expression was indifferent. He reached into his怀里 (bosom) and took out the manual recording the Iron Bridge Suppressing Gate bone-refining essential technique.

"Is this thing real?"

"It's real, truer than real gold!" The hemp-clothed youth’s lips trembled as he endured the pain. "We dug it up from the ruins of the Iron Clothes Sect at Beimang Mountain. The situation was too chaotic back then, and I only managed to grab this one fragment."

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s eyes suddenly turn cold, he hurriedly said, "Master, Grandfather, I have an important clue! The Iron Clothes Sect was said to have been wiped out overnight, but actually, like a cunning rabbit with three burrows, they had another hiding place. I just happen to know it, I just happen to know!"

Xu Yunfan said, "Tell me. If it satisfies me, I might spare your life."

The hemp-clothed youth didn't dare to hesitate. He was certain that if he showed the slightest delay, the heavy hammer hovering above his head would crash down.

"Behind Iron View Mountain in Qingzhou, there is a cliff. About sixty meters down, there is a circular platform. Inside is hidden the foundation of the Iron Clothes Sect. There is definitely the complete Iron Bridge Suppressing Gate essential technique there, and perhaps the accumulated wealth of the Iron Clothes Sect over the years!"

"Does anyone else know about this?"

"No, absolutely no!"

The hemp-clothed youth forced a smile that looked worse than crying.

"I got this clue from digging through the ruins at the Iron Clothes Sect's old site. It came from a笔记 (notebook) left behind by Yuan Zheng, a true disciple of the Iron Clothes Sect, that wasn't completely burned.

Originally... originally, I planned to do a bit of business in the black market here in Beiye City, then go back to Beimang Mountain to gather a group of people to go check it out."

Hearing this, the hemp-clothed youth seemed to realize he’d said something wrong and quickly added, "But now that you know, Great Hero, I naturally won't bother. I am a disciple of the Eagle Gate at Beimang Mountain, skilled in all kinds of ancient tomb mechanisms and clues. If you keep me alive, Master, you will definitely make a profit."

Xu Yunfan looked thoughtful and slowly moved the War Drum Gold Hammer away from the hemp-clothed youth’s head.

The hemp-clothed youth couldn't help but feel a slight relief in his heart.

As long as he could survive, as long as he survived, he would immediately pass the information to his master!

He lowered his eyelids, not daring to look up, afraid that Xu Yunfan would see through him.

"I'll find time to go take a look."

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s voice, devoid of any emotional fluctuation, accompanied by the sound of air tearing, the hemp-clothed youth couldn't help but look up. He was horrified to see the heavy hammer, which should have been taken away, falling like a cannonball.

*Thud!*

The hemp-clothed youth’s head exploded instantly.

When Xu Yunfan tore open the youth's blood-stained lined jacket, his brow suddenly furrowed.

Where did the silver bills he had given him go?

After searching thoroughly and finding nothing useful, Xu Yunfan straightened up and couldn't help but let out a breath.

He had lost one thousand taels tonight.

He inexplicably felt a pang of heartache.

He shouldn't have given so much.

He was still too young!

He had let his emotions get the better of him when provoked by that hunchback old man just now.

This was a big taboo; he needed to pay attention in the future.

This kind of "immortal trap" could happen once, but not twice.

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly. Confirming that there were no other people around, he turned and quickly returned to the scene of the fight, searching the bodies of the Iron-Faced Man and the others thoroughly.

However, just like the hemp-clothed youth, he couldn't find anything on them.

Coming out to rob people without carrying anything deserved to be beaten and killed!

Xu Yunfan muttered to himself for a while. Not hesitating any further, he used snow to roughly wash the filth off the Gold Hammer, picked up the black cloth, and covered it again.

Then, with large strides, he quickly left the battlefield.

"Miss, we've arrived. We've arrived at Beiye City!"

A team of about twenty to thirty people stood quietly at the foot of the city gates of Beiye City.

Next to a sedan chair, a fair and slender hand lifted the curtain. Looking at Beiye City, which stood silently in the darkness like a crouching giant beast, quietly lingering on the earth.

Standing next to the sedan chair was a burly man wrapped in a jacket, a sheathed sword hooked at his waist. He looked up at the city ahead and sighed.

"No matter how you look at it, it always looks a bit terrifying in the dark."

Beside him, a youth with a lean body landed as lightly as a cat, making no sound, his movements extremely agile.
