# Chapter 93: Complete Victory, Unrivaled Heroism

On the other side of the mountain, around noon, the Fourth Master, Niu Liang, returned to the stronghold with a fierce aura, his body covered in wounds.

Over the past few days, Niu Liang had clashed with the Blackwater Gang several times but gained no advantage, instead losing several of his top fighters.

It was no one's fault but his own.

He knew the Blackwater Gang excelled at naval and ship battles, but blinded by rage, he still led his men in a headlong charge.

He attacked the enemy's strength with his own weakness.

The result was predictable.

"Damn it!这群王八羔子, a bunch of water rats, how utterly despicable!"

"They hide in the water. If they had any guts, they'd come down and fight! Let's see if I don't chop their heads off!"

Although Niu Liang was a brute, he still knew fear. After suffering several heavy defeats, including one where he nearly lost his life, he no longer dared to go into the water.

But he couldn't lose face.

So he cursed them out from the mountain, challenging the Blackwater Gang to come up and fight. The situation devolved into a shouting match, with neither side able to do anything to the other.

Niu Liang returned to the stronghold, his belly full of suppressed rage, with nowhere to vent. Despite his frustration, he didn't forget to visit his Third Brother.

"Cough, cough..."

Peng Huli coughed a few times and regained consciousness.

He had survived thanks to his quick thinking. Upon realizing he was poisoned, he immediately sealed his blood flow and pores to stop the toxin from spreading. He then took an antidote pill, which saved his life.

However, the arrow poison was extremely potent. Peng Huli had walked through the gates of hell and was now severely depleted of Qi, blood, and spirit.

Without a miraculous encounter, he wouldn't be leaving his bed for the next few months.

"Third Brother, you're awake!" Niu Liang exclaimed in surprise.

"Fourth Brother," Peng Huli said, his voice weak as a thread. "Have... have the Black River Village... been destroyed?"

Niu Liang corrected him, "Third Brother, you got it wrong. It's the Blackwater Gang. Damn it, just talking about this pisses me off!"

"First, Second, and Fifth Brothers are tied up. After all, Mountain Wind Pass is by the river; those little bastards might try to raid it at any moment. I'm the only one here, and I can't do anything to them."

"What Blackwater Gang?" Peng Huli was confused.

"Weren't you attacked by the Blackwater Gang?" Niu Liang took out the arrow, the fletching clearly marked with the words "Blackwater Gang."

"So, you went to cause trouble for the Blackwater Gang?" Peng Huli coughed a few times, his breath weak. He wanted to be angry but lacked the energy.

He cursed inwardly, *Fourth Brother, Fourth Brother, how could you fall for such an obvious frame-up?*

"Yeah," Niu Liang scratched his head.

"You're wrong, you're wrong!" Peng Huli said. "The ones who attacked me were from Black River Village, Black River Village!"

He was agitated. For a patient, the most important thing was to preserve their breath. If the breath散(dissipates), the person is gone. When Peng Huli said "wrong" and "wrong," he exhaled sharply and almost couldn't catch his breath again.

After finishing his sentence, his Qi dissipated further. He immediately began circulating his energy to regulate his breathing, not daring to speak loudly again.

"For real?!"

"Those bastards from Black River Village dared to trick us?!"

"Damn it! If I can't take down the Blackwater Gang, I can surely take them down?!"

Niu Liang flew into a rage and, without another word, walked out of the room. Peng Huli thought to himself, *this is bad*. He figured that although Fourth Brother's martial prowess exceeded his own, he was reckless and brainless. If he went now... normally speaking, a great victory wouldn't be hard to achieve. But considering his own intelligence had led him to this state, with Fourth Brother's meager plans...

There might be another accident. He should call back the Fifth Brother and attack together; that would be the safest course of action.

He wanted to stop him, but his breath was weak and his blood was low, so his shout wasn't loud. And Niu Liang wasn't listening anyway. He was used to going to Black River Village and didn't take it seriously at all.

"Forget it," Peng Huli consoled himself. "Fourth Brother is gathering his elite forces. With their overwhelming power, they shouldn't lose."

Niu Liang led thirty elite bandits and fifty ordinary ones, their momentum fierce, and set off for Black River Village.

The thirty elite bandits all had horses, axes, longswords, and other weapons. They were fully equipped and had decent martial arts attainments, each knowing at least one basic martial art.

They had Qi in their dantian.

The ordinary bandits were slightly weaker.

"Damn it!"

"Bring me all their heads!"

Niu Liang roared and took the lead, galloping forward. By now, the sky was growing dark, approaching evening.

As they were riding...

Suddenly, the horse under Niu Liang was tripped by a hidden rope and fell forward. The scene instantly descended into chaos.

Then, a series of explosions boomed.

The gunpowder, buried in advance, was secretly ignited. The charging momentum was immediately thrown into disarray. Before a single blow was struck, the bandits' formation was already broken.

Li Xian channeled his Qi and shouted, "Hahaha, the Mountain Wind Stronghold is truly brainless, falling for the Blackwater Gang's scheme just like that."

"This time, you'll jump right into our trap, hahaha."

He was clear on his opponents' origins. By borrowing the name of the "Blackwater Gang," his goal wasn't to frame them, but to intimidate the bandits' morale.

This plan worked perfectly.

Many of the ordinary bandits turned pale with fright. They were good at bullying villagers, but when facing a proper gang, they felt a sense of dread. Hearing that they had fallen into a "scheme" terrified them completely.

"Drop your weapons and you shall live! The rest will be cut down!" Li Xian roared.

Some cowards immediately threw down their weapons. The villagers of Black River Village, seeing that the bandits were nothing but bullies who feared the strong and preyed on the weak, lost their fear and their fighting spirit soared.

They formed their lines and charged out from both sides of the road. They captured some of the bandits and killed the others.

If one had to say who was the most troublesome...

It would be the mounted elite bandits. They had some martial arts training and were used to a life of violence.

They were still putting up a desperate resistance.

"Throw the nets!" Li Xian roared.

From the hillside, several young men threw out fishing nets, trapping the bandits along with their horses.

They pulled and tugged, restraining them.

Then, spears thrust forward.

"Ah!"

A series of screams echoed.

Several elite bandits, bleeding profusely, fell from their horses, their fate unknown.

In the darkness, Li Xian directed the battle from behind the scenes, commanding the hundreds of villagers with the ease of using his own arm.

Though still young...

It had to be said, the scene today already hinted at the style of a hero rising in a chaotic world.

So what if he was born from humble origins?

He would use his own fists to break through each and every difficulty!

"Damn you!"

Niu Liang snapped back to his senses. His entire force had been defeated. He was the only one who had reacted quickly enough to avoid the net.

He caught sight of Li Xian. Though he was a fool, he knew the principle of capturing the leader to subdue the bandits. He charged straight at Li Xian.

"Bring it on!"

Li Xian channeled his Qi and struck out with a palm. The palm wind, like a great wave, surged forward. This kind of palm wind had little killing power, but at this moment...

He had hidden iron darts in the ground beforehand. With this gust of wind, the darts, carried by the force, shot straight at his face.

Niu Liang raised his hands to block. At the same time, Li Xian leaped into the air, executing the "Gentle Breeze Legs" with all his might.

His figure hung suspended in the air, his legwork extremely agile. He kicked several times in mid-air, sending the darts flying out with explosive force, forcing Niu Liang to shut his eyes as the darts came at him one after another.

Li Xian, having gained the upper hand, showed no mercy.

He continued his assault, his legwork mixed with the darts. The trajectory of the darts was bizarre, their angles unpredictable and nearly impossible to defend against.

In that brief moment...

He pushed his knowledge of schemes, the Gentle Breeze Legs, the Four Directions Fist, the Jade Green Palm... everything he had learned, to its absolute limit.

His final kick landed squarely on Niu Liang's head.

Niu Liang's eyes rolled back, and he collapsed, unconscious.

Li Xian landed. This battle... was a complete victory, and a beautiful one at that!

"Bring the horses back! Strip the dead and collect the bodies! Tie up the living and bring them back to the village!" Li Xian commanded.

"Yes!" the villagers replied in unison, their obedience absolute.

Just then, an unexpected turn of events occurred.
