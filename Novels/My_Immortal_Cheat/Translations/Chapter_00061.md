# Chapter 61

The golden light was incredibly fast. The black mecha brought its two arms together in front of it. *Clack, clack*, the sound of parts combining echoed. The two mecha arms actually formed a diamond-shaped shield. Golden veins extended across the shield, forming a symbol that protected its body.

*Sizzle!* The golden light struck the shield. The golden afterburner on the mecha's back spewed out a *zhang* long flame, but its body still couldn't stop retreating. The golden vortex in its abdomen spun even more intensely, like a galaxy flowing within it. The golden veins on the shield glowed with golden light, and a complex rune empowered the shield. This mecha was not only equipped with technological means but also with rune array techniques!

The golden light lacked sustained power, and the mecha stopped its retreat. Before it could catch its breath, a shadow enveloped it. Without even looking up, the observation systems on its visor already showed what it was.

After using its divine ability, the gigantic beast let out a roar. Its massive foot stomped on the ground, creating cracks hundreds of *zhang* long. Its enormous body actually leaped into the air.

A mountain-sized fist glowed with golden light, imbued with an unstoppable momentum, and violently smashed towards the black mecha.

Cracks appeared along the mecha's sides. *Boom!* Blazing afterburners erupted, trying to move it out of the fist's range, but it was too late.

*Bang!* The ground trembled violently. Dust and fallen leaves were shaken several *zhang* high. Cracks like spiderwebs radiated out from where the fist landed, extending for a full thousand *zhang*.

Among the fifty names floating in mid-air, one also lost its luster.

The scene flickered. Inside a tidy room, the black mecha appeared out of thin air, covered in cracks, its abdominal golden vortex also dim and lifeless.

In this competition, Tianqin would certainly not allow the prodigies of other forces to die inside. Therefore, as long as a participant was judged to be in life-threatening danger, the secret realm would teleport them out, though they would lose the qualification to continue the competition.

*Clack, clack*, the visor split open, revealing a rather delicate face. It was actually a woman. At this moment, her face was filled with vexation. Her luck truly was terrible, to be directly teleported in front of a fierce beast like the Golden-furred Youwei.

This kind of fierce beast was a subspecies of the Battle Saint Ape. Although it didn't possess many divine abilities, its immense strength was comparable to that of a Saint. There was simply no way to contend with it!

"General Fogg, don't look so glum. To be able to entangle with the Golden-furred Youwei for so long is already a glorious defeat..."

The Taoist sitting beside Fogg raised his amethyst wine cup, took a sip, and said with a look of intoxication. This Taoist was the leader of the Dao Alliance's delegation for this trip, proficient in all manner of debauchery: eating, drinking, whoring, and gambling.

Sitting beside him was the leader from the Nation of Artifacts. The person in the black mecha just now was one of his subordinates. Losing a major combatant without even doing anything at the start, how could he not be vexed?

"Indeed, indeed..."

"How many people in this era could contend with a subordinate of the Golden-furred Youwei for so long?"

The friendly forces also offered their consolations.

"Cough, cough..."

A sudden coughing sound broke the silence. Everyone turned their gaze to see Zhou Tian engrossed in gnawing on a pig's trotters. This pig's trotters was truly not small; others' battles had already ended, but he still hadn't finished gnawing on it...

Everyone fell silent, having forgotten this individual who made even Saint Kings kneel...

Li Lingyi's face was as black as the bottom of a pot. "We're all peers here, don't think I can't feel your sidelong glances!"

Zhou Yi's face was beaming, and he was equally delighted inside.

And Fogg's face was almost as long as a donkey's.

The previous battle occurred just as they entered the secret realm. Due to the time acceleration array within the secret realm, by the time the mecha woman's battle ended, several days had actually passed for the participants inside the realm.

Aside from this truly unlucky individual, others did not encounter such a situation. Everyone was carefully exploring the map, looking for any large creatures they shouldn't provoke. Each competition's secret realm was different, so there were no prior experiences to rely on.

The map of the secret realm wasn't too large. After the initial exploration, people had already begun to encounter each other. At this early stage, most people who met those from their own faction would simply turn and leave; there was no need to fight. As for forming alliances, that was even less likely. A group of bigshot elders were watching outside; this was just a small competition, forming alliances would be utterly disgraceful...

Battles were continuously breaking out, and people were eliminated from time to time. Every cultivation realm had its strong and weak, and the Dharma Idol realm was no exception.

The participants brought by the other provinces were generally among the top tier within their respective forces. Although not the absolute strongest, they were good enough, and battles rarely ended in instant kills. However, one battle did feature such a scenario.

One side of the battle was a monk from Luotian Temple, and the other was a person from Tianqin, not from the imperial capital, but someone dressed with strong barbaric flair. His hair was casually disheveled, he wore a tiger-skin skirt, his upper body was bare, his muscles were like gnarled old roots, and his body was covered in old scars. On his back was a blood-red longbow, seemingly crafted from blood crystal, with sharp protrusions on the bow tips, appearing to also have close-combat capabilities.

Zhou Tian overheard a few bigshots nearby discussing him. This guy was named Nan Qing, a member of the Southern Wilderness Barbarian Tribe, and the son of the Barbarian King. He was two years older than Zhou Tian and his companions, and had been at the Dharma Idol realm for a long time, making him extremely powerful. Zhou Tian seemed to have a vague impression of seeing this name on an unreliable ranking list, but hadn't paid close attention at the time.

Strictly speaking, it wasn't really a battle. It was unknown how Nan Qing's eyes worked; the monk opposite him was a thousand *zhang* away, completely outside the detection range of a Dharma Idol realm cultivator's divine sense, yet he somehow saw him with his bare eyes. Can you believe it?

Upon seeing the monk, Nan Qing immediately strung his bow and shot an arrow. The blood-red bow emitted a captivating glow. The arrow was also specially made, forged from an unknown black metal, its fletching red, like a burning flame.

Blood-red runes converged, and various enhancing arrays emerged on the longbow. The moment the arrow was loosed, it vanished into the void.

The monk, to his credit, wasn't slow to react. He sensed something when he was targeted. Golden scriptures swirled around him, and a golden Buddha instantly manifested outside his body, appearing substantial, as if to liberate the world. Chanting sounds rose, and a Buddhist Pure Land seemed to descend. However, it was all for naught. The arrow directly blasted through the Buddha's head, eliminating the monk...

In the grand hall, Monk Zhikong of Luotian Temple's eye twitched. He pressed his palms together and loudly declared, "Damn it all... *ugh*... Amitābha."

After Nan Qing blasted the great Buddha, his rugged face remained expressionless. He caught the returning arrow, placed it in his quiver, and then casually picked a direction and left...

It felt as if this guy had a grudge against monks. Because when he blasted the great Buddha, he had just been in a standoff with a person in a mecha for a moment before leaving, perhaps lacking confidence. But then he turned around and blasted the monk's head off...
