# Chapter 35: Old Acquaintances

The battle in the forest was intense. Two Qi Refining Sixth Layer masters wielded their spiritual artifacts and talismans, flying around, colliding, and erupting in brilliant light.

Coincidentally, both these individuals were people Lu Xu knew.

One was Fatty Mo, the Mo family's steward at the Qi Refining Sixth Layer, who had exploited and oppressed Lu Xu for many years.

The other was Gao Tianqiang, the fishmonger Lu Xu had always suspected.

"How did these two end up fighting? Could it be true, as I suspected, that Gao Tianqiang is also a member of the Black Robe Society?"

"They've chased each other all the way to a place like this? That can't be right, can it?"

Lu Xu's heart stirred, and he quietly approached.

*Bang!*

*Clang!*

The sounds of the battle had weakened. The lights flickering on their spiritual artifacts began to dim, and they clearly had few talismans left.

"You Black Robe Society members dare come to Tianmen City? Aren't you afraid the Wei family will catch you?"

"The Wei family? Heh heh, do you think the name of the Wei family can scare me?"

"Hmph, the Wei family has already allied with the Chen family and the White Mountain Sect to attack the Black Robe Society. Just wait for your annihilation!"

"You? Even ten more Wei families couldn't hope to destroy our Black Robe Society!"

"Arrogant!"

"Whether I'm arrogant or not, you'll find out soon enough. For now, you'd best look after yourself. Last time you managed to escape my grasp, but this time you might not be so lucky!" Gao Tianqiang said with a cold laugh.

"It really is someone from the Black Robe Society!" Lu Xu thought to himself, watching their battle from a distance.

"Since the friend over there has already arrived, why not come out and meet?" Gao Tianqiang suddenly turned his head to look at the large tree where Lu Xu was hiding.

Fatty Mo was startled. He hadn't noticed anyone else present and looked over with a mix of surprise and suspicion.

A moment of silence passed. There was no reaction from behind the large tree.

"Come out, Fellow Daoist. We are old acquaintances from Green Lake Market City. Don't make me call out your name!" Gao Tianqiang said again, his expression calm.

*Clap clap clap!*

A moment later, Lu Xu clapped his hands, slowly emerging from behind a large tree.

"A truly splendid battle, both of you!"

"Brother Lu, it really is you!" Seeing Lu Xu appear, Gao Tianqiang showed no surprise.

On the other hand, Fatty Mo's eyes widened in astonishment, his face filled with disbelief.

"How could it be you?"

"Not only are you not dead, but your cultivation has reached the Qi Refining Fourth Layer? How is that possible?"

Fatty Mo was utterly shocked. He knew Lu Xu's background better than anyone. He was just a spiritual farmer, and although he had a mid-grade spiritual root, without sufficient cultivation resources, he should at most be at the Qi Refining Third Layer right now.

How could he have directly broken through the bottleneck and reached the Qi Refining Fourth Layer?

Gao Tianqiang suddenly burst into laughter. "You're mistaken, Fatty Mo! Brother Lu here isn't at the Qi Refining Fourth Layer, but the Qi Refining Fifth Layer!"

Fatty Mo was startled again upon hearing this. He quickly activated his Spiritual Eye Technique to look at Lu Xu and, indeed, he was at the Qi Refining Fifth Layer.

He instantly gaped, exclaiming loudly, "Qi Refining Fifth Layer? How is that possible? This isn't—"

Lu Xu ignored Fatty Mo's shouting and instead looked at Gao Tianqiang.

"I'm very curious, Fellow Daoist Gao, how did you discover my approach?"

Gao Tianqiang chuckled, patting a pouch at his waist.

"I possess a spiritual beast that can perceive everything within a five-li radius and can also remember the spiritual energy characteristics of everyone it has met. Fellow Daoist, you were discovered the moment you passed by this place!"

Lu Xu immediately thought of Gao Tianqiang's fish tank, wondering if the spiritual beast was one of the fish he often saw in that tank.

"To possess such a spiritual beast, Fellow Daoist truly has impressive methods!"

"Heh heh, how can my meager methods compare to Brother Lu's? Brother Lu even killed one of our Black Robe Society members when he was only at the Qi Refining Third Layer!"

Gao Tianqiang looked at Lu Xu with a calm expression, a faint light flowing deep within his eyes.

"You mean Tan Hu? I didn't kill him. At the time, a friend happened to be with me and helped me deal with Tan Hu. How could I, a Qi Refining Third Layer cultivator, cross so many realms to kill someone at the Qi Refining Fifth Layer?"

"A friend? Is Brother Lu implying you have a powerful backer? Heh heh!"

Gao Tianqiang smiled indifferently, then turned to Fatty Mo.

"Fatty Mo, you don't need to keep yelling. There's no one else here besides us. You can scream until your throat is hoarse, and no one will come to help you!"

Fatty Mo's body stiffened, his wide-open mouth opening and closing a couple of times before finally shutting.

A hint of embarrassment flashed across his face. He stopped shouting but immediately looked at Lu Xu and spoke eagerly:

"Little Fellow Daoist Lu, the Black Robe Society are the criminals who breached the market city. If you and I join forces to kill him, our Mo family will reward you handsomely!"

"Handsomely? Heh heh, what do you think the Mo family would do if they knew you only took nine years to cultivate to the Qi Refining Fifth Layer? Fellow Daoist Lu, you must be very clear about what you've done, right? The Mo family will never let you off!"

"Nonsense! Our Mo family is in dire need of talents right now! No matter what happened in the past, we can bury the hatchet!" Fatty Mo shouted.

He looked at Lu Xu with eager anticipation, wishing he would join forces with him against the Black Robe Society member opposite them.

Although both of them were at the Qi Refining Sixth Layer, after battling for so long, their spiritual energy was running low. Lu Xu's sudden appearance was undoubtedly a fresh force; whoever he joined would win.

As for how Lu Xu's cultivation had suddenly leaped so much, Fatty Mo already had a vague suspicion.

It must be that after Green Lake Market City was breached, this person took advantage of the chaos to obtain a large amount of benefits, taking away an unknown amount of the Mo family's wealth, thereby rapidly increasing his cultivation to such a level.

Fatty Mo deeply resented such a person, who like a vulture, pecked at the Mo family's corpse, but now he dared not show any of it.

"Fellow Daoist Lu, you must think clearly. In the eyes of the Mo family, you're a rat who stole their wealth. He's only saying nice things to you now because he needs you. What he'll do in the future, well, that's hard to say!"

"Oh, right, I forgot to remind you, the Mo family has a deep relationship with the imperial Wei family. You could even consider the Mo family an auxiliary force of the Wei family!" Gao Tianqiang said with a smiling face.

Both of them tried their best to state facts and reason, attempting to persuade Lu Xu to side with them.

"Tsk, this is really troublesome. How did I just happen to run into you two?" Lu Xu shook his head helplessly.

The Azure Radiance Sword silently slid out from his sleeve, ready to shoot out at any moment.

Lu Xu lowered his gaze, looking at the azure glow flickering at his fingertips, his voice deepening.

"However, this is also a good thing. If I can kill a Black Robe Society member here, it can be considered revenge for my friend who died in the market city!"

As soon as he finished speaking, Gao Tianqiang's eye twitched immediately, while Fatty Mo burst into laughter, instantly urging his crimson small sword to attack Gao Tianqiang.

Gao Tianqiang quickly pointed a finger, and a golden hammer suspended in the air fiercely smashed towards Fatty Mo.

Their spiritual artifacts tangled together.

"Brother Lu, please reconsider!" Gao Tianqiang quickly shouted.

But immediately, a green sword light shot out, slashing at the shield formed by the Vajra Talisman on his body.

Close behind it, several head-sized fireballs surged forward, heavily striking the golden shield, causing it to shake continuously.

"Not good!"

Gao Tianqiang was greatly alarmed. He had very few talismans left on him. If his shield were breached, there would be no escaping. Under the fierce attack of a mid-Qi Refining cultivator, the Vajra Talisman couldn't last much longer; its breach was only a matter of time.

Gao Tianqiang's heart hardened. He fiercely flicked his large sleeve, and three talismans shot out, transforming into streams of light that exploded, forcing back Fatty Mo's crimson small sword.

At the same time, he slapped the pouch at his waist, and a black carp emitting a First-Grade Low-Tier demonic aura burst out. It opened its mouth and spat out a water arrow, rushing towards Lu Xu.

Using the talismans and spiritual beast to cover his retreat, Gao Tianqiang immediately retreated violently, fleeing madly with his golden small hammer.

*Shing!*

Sword qi shot out, Lu Xu cut the water arrow with one slash, and with another descending slash, the spiritual fish was cut into two pieces.

Silence returned to the forest. In the darkness, only the light of spiritual artifacts and talismans flickered.

Neither Lu Xu nor Fatty Mo went after Gao Tianqiang. Instead, they stood still, subtly confronting each other.

A tense atmosphere permeated the air. Cold sweat slowly seeped from Fatty Mo's back.

He was no match for Lu Xu now. If the other party were to make a move, he could only desperately flee.
