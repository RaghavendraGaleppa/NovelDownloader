# Chapter 23: The Ancient Battlefield  

Qianbao Peak truly lived up to its reputation as one of the five major inner peaks.  

As soon as Zhang Yan passed through the protective formation, he was immediately struck by the dense spiritual energy within. The concentration here was at least a third higher than in the outer sect. If he could cultivate here long-term, his progress would undoubtedly accelerate significantly.  

"Mu Ling Peak must be similarly rich in spiritual energy," Zhang Yan mused, recalling Mu Sen's promise to introduce him to his master once his Wood Element Technique reached the Great Perfection stage. Now, not only had Zhang Yan achieved Great Perfection, but he was also on the verge of reaching the Complete stage.  

If he wished, he could join Mu Ling Peak at any time.  

However, Zhang Yan had deliberately delayed his move for two reasons.  

First, while it was acceptable to be recognized as a genius, standing out too much could invite unwanted attention.  

Second, becoming an inner disciple on Mu Ling Peak would mean losing the relative freedom and leisure of the outer sect. Moreover, Mu Ling Peak was home to a Golden Core elder, which would make his actions more scrutinized.  

Thus, Zhang Yan decided to wait a while longer before approaching Mu Sen. By then, he would downplay his progress, presenting himself as merely a minor talent. That way, he could enjoy the benefits of being a genius without drawing too much notice.  

After all, he had heard of someone who mastered a spell to the Complete stage in a year and was hailed as a prodigy. By comparison, Zhang Yan achieving Great Perfection in a year wouldn't seem too outrageous, right?  

The thought of being a modest genius—reaping the rewards without the spotlight—was immensely satisfying.  

Following the alluring female cultivator, Zhang Yan soon arrived at a grand hall bustling with activity. She introduced him to an elderly steward.  

"Elder, this disciple has taken on the task of sorting through discarded magical artifacts," she said.  

"Sorting artifacts?" The elder glanced at Zhang Yan and nodded. "You'll categorize them by material. Be sure to identify any that are still functional and set them aside."  

"Understood," Zhang Yan replied.  

"Payment is based on progress—ten contribution points per artifact sorted. If you find one that's still usable, you'll earn one hundred points. You'll also have priority to purchase any functional artifacts at eighty percent of the market price.  

"But be warned: some artifacts may still carry residual restrictions. You'll understand once you see them."  

The elder's tone was indifferent as he explained.  

Zhang Yan nodded again and followed the instructions to the artifact sorting area.  

Unclassified artifacts were stored in a sunken valley on Qianbao Peak.  

Inside the valley, countless magical weapons were embedded in the ground—flying swords, banners, and even massive stone-like weapons Zhang Yan couldn't identify, all piled haphazardly. The sheer number was staggering.  

"Why are there so many?" Zhang Yan murmured, sensing the chaotic fluctuations of spiritual energy emanating from the artifacts even before entering the valley.  

"These were all collected from outside," the disciple guiding him explained casually. "Most are discarded artifacts from the Ancient Battlefield."  

He pointed at the massive stones nearby. "Ignore the ones stuck in the ground—they're useless. Focus on those rocks. They were excavated from the Ancient Battlefield. Some might still contain intact artifacts, but most are probably ruined and depleted."  

"Ancient Battlefield? What is that place?" Zhang Yan eyed the enormous piles of stones with awe. The quantity was overwhelming—and this was just what the Qingheng Sect had gathered. If one considered the entire cultivation world, the scale would be unimaginable.  

The thought of visiting the Ancient Battlefield made his heart race. How many equipment attributes could he collect there?  

The senior disciple chuckled. "It's said to be the battleground between the immortal and demonic paths. Tens of thousands of cultivators perished there every year—though that was over a hundred thousand years ago. Now, it's just ruins and endless raw stones. Still, it's not a place for low-level disciples like us. You'd need at least Foundation Establishment cultivation to venture there."  

"I see. Thank you for the explanation, Senior Brother."  

After expressing his gratitude, Zhang Yan eagerly entered the valley.  

The moment he stepped inside, he felt the surrounding spiritual energy turn turbulent, making cultivation impossible. Even the occasional breeze carried a faint sting against his skin—a side effect of the lingering power within the artifacts.  

These weapons, as the senior had said, were remnants of the great immortal-demon war from over a hundred millennia ago. The fact that they had endured for so long spoke volumes about their original quality.  

Now, Zhang Yan understood what the elder had meant by "cleaning."  

The task involved removing the outer layers of raw stone encasing the artifacts. These stones, formed in the Ancient Battlefield, were incredibly dense and resistant to spiritual sense. As a result, they could contain anything—not just artifacts, but also pills, jade slips with cultivation techniques, and more.  

However, due to their material properties, artifacts were the most likely to survive the passage of time.  

The stones Zhang Yan and the other disciples were tasked with processing had already undergone multiple rounds of screening. The most promising ones had long been cracked open, leaving behind the dregs nobody wanted.  

"Go pick a set of tools," the supervising disciple said, gesturing to a nearby room.  

Inside, Zhang Yan found an assortment of hammers and chisels.  

"These stone-breaking hammers and chisels come in pairs for cracking open the raw stones. Figure out the rest yourself."  

With that, the supervising disciple left Zhang Yan alone with the tools.  

"All of these are equipment…"  

There were over a hundred hammers in the room.  

Zhang Yan examined the nearest one.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Stone-Breaking Hammer  
**[Quality]**: Gray  
**[Effects]**: Stone-Breaking (Minor Achievement), Stone-Breaking Experience +20%  

"Mediocre. Next!"  

Unimpressed, Zhang Yan moved on, confident that among so many hammers, he would find one with superior attributes.  

His eyes soon landed on a hammer tucked away in a corner.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Stone-Breaking Hammer  
**[Quality]**: Green  
**[Effects]**: Stone-Breaking (Complete), Stone Appraisal (Minor Achievement), Stone-Breaking Experience +20%  

"Now this looks promising!"  

A grin spread across Zhang Yan's face as he reached for the hammer.
