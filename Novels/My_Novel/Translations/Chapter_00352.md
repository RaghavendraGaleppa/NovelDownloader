Chapter 352: The White-Faced Red Bow

The ship cracked loudly, splitting in two. Gu Nianjun snapped back to reality, leaping into the air. Her tiptoes brushed the water's surface as she vaulted to a nearby boat. Zhou Shijie lay sprawled inside the cabin; as the hull broke, he was immediately submerged.

A martial artist of the Second Realm sinks instantly upon hitting the water. His body felt like a heavy weight dragging him down into the depths. Gu Nianjun was preoccupied with other matters and failed to notice for a moment. It wasn't until the splashing water and the alarmed cries of others that she was startled into action. She immediately called for three ordinary men who were excellent swimmers to rescue him.

It wasn't long before the three martial artists hauled Zhou Shijie out of the lake. One carried his legs, one his waist, and one supported his head. Zhou Shijie felt a great sorrow in his heart. He thought, "Zhou Shijie, Zhou Shijie, the world is vast, yet none are as pathetic as you. Gu Nianjun cares nothing for you; she didn't even notice you falling into the water. What have you gained from your desperate pursuit?"

Although he had just been pulled from the water and was severely injured, his lightness skill remained unimpeded. He slapped the water with his left palm, using the force to leap out, then utilized his lightness skill to return to Gu Nianjun's side. The martial artists who had just dived in to save him, however, were suddenly swept away by a massive wave and sank instantly into the lake.

Fortunately, they were excellent swimmers. Once the waves calmed, they swam back to the surface. They looked at Zhou Shijie with displeasure, seeing that he had no intention of thanking them. Their sympathy vanished instantly. They thought, "This young master looks modest and gentle, but in reality, he looks down on us. Fine. It's no wonder he was defeated by someone more capable. Thinking about it now, he deserves it. If I had the ability, I wouldn't tolerate him either."

Gu Nianjun frowned slightly. She rowed over, rolled up her sleeves, and leaned down to pull the three men out of the water. They thanked her, "Ah! Miss Gu, thank you for saving us!" Gu Nianjun smiled and said, "I should be thanking you for the rescue! I only gave a small pull; I dare not claim to have saved you."

Zhou Shijie, realizing his mistake late, stepped closer and said indifferently, "Thank you for the rescue. I, Shijie, am eternally grateful. If there is anything I can help with in the future, I will go through fire and water without hesitation!"

The three men thought, "He speaks polite words quite skillfully. Looking at him, it seems he doesn't have us in his eyes at all. He'll forget this immediately. If we really sought his help in the future, we'd probably be chased away." They replied, "It was a trivial effort, no need for thanks."

After this brief interaction, their goodwill toward him plummeted. Zhou Shijie paid them no further mind. Seeing Gu Nianjun looking into the distance with a complex and confused expression, he hesitated to speak. He knew she was suspicious, so he said, "Nianjun, my right arm is severely injured; it likely cannot be saved. I need to amputate it to treat the wound. Will you help me bandage it?"

Gu Nianjun saw how severe Zhou Shijie's injuries were. Though she felt no romantic feelings for him, she found it hard to refuse. She said, "I am not skilled at treating wounds. I remember there are several physicians among the traveling martial artists. Let them handle the wound. Chatting with you to distract you and ease the pain would be better."

Zhou Shijie said, "Alright!" When the physician rowed over, Zhou Shijie offered his right arm. The injury was terrifying; flesh was clinging to shattered bone, and it was impossible to save. The forearm had to be cut off before further treatment could be done.

The physician raised his knife and brought it down. Zhou Shijie let out a blood-curdling scream, his head covered in sweat. The physician said, "Young Master Zhou, the subsequent treatment will be very painful. Please endure it!" He immediately applied a family-heirloom golden sore medicine to the wound.

Zhou Shijie was in agony. Seeing that Gu Nianjun's gaze held concern but was also clouded with distracting thoughts, he realized that even his screams couldn't win back her heart. He had a sudden idea and slapped out violently with his palm. The physician, not expecting Zhou Shijie to attack suddenly, was sent flying into the lake. Zhou Shijie exclaimed in feigned shock, "My deepest apologies, I... I was in too much pain to control my limbs!"

The physician's life was not in danger, but he was severely injured. Gu Nianjun frowned deeply and said in a low voice, "If this happens again, no one will treat you." Zhou Shijie said, "This... this wasn't my intention. It's just that the villain struck too hard, and the pain is unbearable! Nianjun... please talk to me to distract me, so the pain lessens. My friend, I am truly sorry, please forgive me!"

The physician, severely injured and fallen into the water, was rescued and brought ashore.

Another physician approached cautiously. Gu Nianjun sighed, "Fine!" She turned her attention back, stood guard beside the physician, and spoke with Zhou Shijie.

Zhou Shijie said, "Nianjun, your archery just now was truly formidable. It seems much stronger than before. How did you improve so rapidly in such a short time?" Gu Nianjun said, "When I was in Flying Dragon City, I befriended a divine archer. His understanding of the Way of the Arrow is profound. He taught me daily, so naturally... naturally, I improved quickly."

Her heart pounded with anxiety, and her mind was in turmoil. She glanced sideways in a certain direction. Zhou Shijie said, "Is that the one with the white face and red bow?"

Gu Nianjun said, "Yes. He... he..." A strange feeling lingered in her heart. Zhou Shijie said, "I admire this good brother very much. Why didn't you introduce me to him back then?"

Gu Nianjun said, "I didn't think much of it at the time. In the future..." She was about to say, "If there is a chance in the future, I will invite him to drink," but her mind was too unsettled to say more.

Zhou Shijie said, "To be honest, during the time you were missing, I saw that hero again." Gu Nianjun said, "Ah? Really? Why didn't you tell me sooner?" Li Xian's figure flashed through her mind, but he was too far away to see clearly. And based solely on his archery posture, it was difficult to confirm his identity. She had been in contact with the "White-Faced Red Bow" for a long time and found it hard to believe that he would act as a flower thief. She was unwilling to believe they were the same person. But she felt a lingering connection that tugged at her spirit, making her feel uneasy. She didn't want to think about it, but she couldn't help it. Hearing that Zhou Shijie had seen the White-Faced Red Bow, she immediately shifted her focus.

Zhou Shijie smiled bitterly and said, "At that time... at that time... damn it..." Suddenly, a sharp pain shot through his arm. He gritted his teeth and smiled. "To be honest, at that time, I truly had feelings for you. Out of selfishness, I didn't want to mention it. But after what just happened, I know your martial arts are far superior to mine. I know I have no hope. My obsession is let go."

Gu Nianjun saw his sincere expression and smiled. "That is for the best. Brother Zhou is talented in both literature and martial arts. There are many women better than me. Although we have no romantic fate, our friendship in the prefecture city will last forever. We can definitely be very good friends!"

Zhou Shijie smiled. "To hear you say that, Nianjun, I am content." Gu Nianjun suddenly thought of something and said, "Brother Zhou, your arm injury... actually, severed limbs can be regrown."

Zhou Shijie said, "The world is full of wonders; there are surely ways to regrow a limb. But if I don't know the method, what use is it?" Gu Nianjun said, "Where the Three Paths converge, there is a wealthy city-state called Jade City. They have a product called 'Jade Saliva Muscle Restoration Cream' which is enough to regrow severed limbs!"

Zhou Shijie memorized this secretly. Gu Nianjun said, "Right, back to business. After you met that hero, what did you talk about?"

Zhou Shijie said, "That hero's grace and style truly made me bow in admiration, prostrate myself in respect, and admire him immensely. Nianjun, you know me; I rarely admire anyone. But I admire that hero alone."

Gu Nianjun said proudly, "That is natural. It's not just you; even I..." Her pretty face flushed slightly. Remembering a woman's reserve, she said no more. Zhou Shijie said, "He is as warm as jade, generous to others, and has terrifying talent, yet shows not a trace of arrogance. Such a person... makes me extremely envious. He is truly a pride of heaven, a dragon among men."

Gu Nianjun felt something was off. She thought, "When I first met him, he treated me coldly and indifferently. 'Warm as jade'... that's hardly the case. But what I like most about him is his free-spirited and wild nature, his disregard for rules, like an arrow breaking through, dazzlingly brilliant, incomparable."

She was already suspicious and stared at Zhou Shijie, asking, "You didn't see wrong? Wasn't it someone pretending to be him?"

Zhou Shijie knew he had revealed a flaw. His schemes were not as good as Gu Nianjun's, and it was very difficult to fool her. But using his severed arm and injury as an excuse, he twitched his face in feigned, unbearable pain, unable to speak for a moment, using the time to think of a counter-strategy.

He remembered that a few days before Gu Nianjun went missing, she seemed to have a worried look on her face, wanting to find the White-Faced Red Bow.

He calmed himself and said, "I didn't see wrong. That hero told me he had already left on business and was not in Flying Dragon City. He suddenly heard of the great change in the city, that a flower thief was causing chaos and women were missing. He was worried about your safety, so he returned to the city to check. You were already gone, and I thought you had been captured by the Flower Cage Sect. I told him about it."

Gu Nianjun's face flushed with joy. She thought to herself, "So that's how it is." Then she worried again: "If he thinks I was captured by the flower thief, does he think my innocence is lost? This... my reputation... isn't it already ruined?" Her hatred for the Flower Cage Sect deepened.

Zhou Shijie said, "That young master was very concerned about you upon hearing this. He decided to help capture the flower thief. That's why I told you earlier that if we capture the flower thief, we might encounter that young master again."

Gu Nianjun let out a huge sigh of relief, her worries slightly eased. But she also looked forward to meeting him again. She asked, "Then... what else did that young master say to you?"

Zhou Shijie saw that he had dispelled Gu Nianjun's suspicions and was quite satisfied. Suddenly, he thought, "I have no hope with Gu Nianjun anymore. She looks like she is emotionally moved. She can be with anyone, but she absolutely cannot be with Li Xian. This villain cut off my arm and did all sorts of evil deeds; how can all good things go to him? He wants to win the beauty? Hmph, impossible." Consumed by jealousy and hatred, he said, "There is one thing... I hesitated to tell you. I hope you won't blame me, Nianjun."

"When we met that day, we were afraid he was a flower thief in disguise, deliberately fooling us. So we demanded he remove his mask and reveal his identity and origin. That's how I know his identity!"

Gu Nianjun said urgently, "Why didn't you say so earlier!"

Zhou Shijie said, "His appearance is more handsome than Li Xian's by a thousand, ten thousand times. His strength is stronger than Li Xian's by ten thousand, ten thousand times."

Gu Nianjun thought, "Zhou Shijie holds a deep grudge against Li Xian. To say his appearance is superior to Li Xian's is already hard enough; to say it's a thousand, ten thousand times superior, how could such a person exist in the world? I admire him for his character, not his looks. Even if his face is ordinary under the mask, I would still admire him. But... his looks definitely aren't bad." Her heart fluttered as she recalled the events of hunting foxes in the snow.

Zhou Shijie said, "As for his family background and wealth, they are also very rare. He is the Golden Boy of Dao Xuan Mountain: Taishu Chunfeng. His surname is Taishu, and his given name is Chunfeng."

Gu Nianjun exclaimed in shock, "So he is the Golden Boy of Dao Xuan Mountain? No wonder... no wonder he is so powerful!"

Zhou Shijie thought, "Dao Xuan Mountain is not within Yu Nan Dao; it is very far away. I deliberately made it sound remote so you have no way to verify it. Gu Nianjun, Gu Nianjun... since you don't like me, don't blame me for tricking you. You should experience the pain of unrequited love. I will continue to instigate things. I observe that Li Xian has no special feelings for you either. When he comes to despise you, or is completely killed, I will tell you the truth then, so you can experience the pain of a broken heart." He said, "Nianjun, although that villain Li has temporarily escaped, he is a great menace and must be pursued and captured!"

Gu Nianjun thought, "Since I know his origin, I'm not in a rush for the moment. If I want to find him, I can always meet him. Right now, I should focus on Xiao Fan's future!" She said, "You are right. If necessary, and if Li Xian refuses to atone for his sins, it would be better for him to disappear without a trace."

"Otherwise, people will use this to attack Xiao Fan's Red Heart in the future. All our efforts would be wasted."

Zhou Shijie said, "Exactly! Although I am injured, I am willing to help." He thought to himself, "When the truth comes to light in the future, don't blame me for interfering. If it weren't for your deep prejudice, how could you be swayed by my instigation?" Having suffered repeated setbacks and blows, his heart had become twisted. Although Gu Nianjun did not accept his affection, she had never wronged him. For him to scheme so anxiously was a case of biting the hand that fed him, a cynical betrayal.

Gu Nianjun regrouped and led the crowd back to the shore by boat. It was nearly dusk. They had captured over thirty flower thieves and killed more than ten. The harvest was plentiful. Some disciples with the "Print" mark were captured, bound by ropes and iron chains, unable to move.

Gu Nianjun interrogated the flower thieves. Some tried to trick their way through, using clever words to defend themselves, but to no avail and were severely punished. They were stripped naked, their limbs bound, and a noose hung around their necks, suspended from trees to slowly watch them die.

Some confessed frankly. The wandering martial artists, driven by strong righteousness and a hot-blooded martial spirit, became enraged upon hearing of their crimes and killed them with a single palm strike. They were beaten to death in a group. The deaths were miserable, leaving no intact corpse.

The "Print" disciples were involved in secrets. Their tendons were severed, and they were castrated on the spot, losing their manhood forever, to be kept for questioning about the Flower Cage Sect's affairs. Gu Nianjun had left the government estate; she was the legitimate daughter of the Gu family in the "Dragon Court Prefecture" of Yu Nan Dao. Her status was high, she was decisive in killing, and her methods were formidable.

This matter gradually came to light. Zhou Shijie, admitting he was inferior, felt even more inferior. After all matters were settled, Gu Nianjun wanted to pursue Li Xian again. But Li Xian was as cunning as a fox. Even Wen Caishang, with all her schemes and strategies, had fallen into his trap and remained unable to move. Gu Nianjun's methods were excellent, but trying to catch Li Xian was futile.

She tried several times but was always toyed with. With the vastness of the crowd, there was no hope of catching him. Gu Nianjun was deeply worried. She knew Li Xian was making a name for himself in the Flower Cage Sect, gradually showing his edge. If not stopped, he would inevitably become infamous, a great flower thief. Gu Nianjun had prejudice against Li Xian, but no hatred. She only worried that Xiao Fan's future would be ruined by him.

In the blink of an eye, two more days passed. Li Xian was like a fish in the sea, leaving no trace. Numerous obstacles could not trap him. Various hardships could not block his path.

Meanwhile, at the Blue Fragrance Pavilion.

Xiao Tuan had no worries about food or clothing and had grown a little taller. She was originally a poor village girl, her father having died early. The mother and daughter depended on each other. Fortunately, her mother was skilled and knew embroidery and needlework, earning praise from the surrounding villages.

Gradually, villagers came to have her mother mend clothes or add embroidery to garments. Although they couldn't pay money, they occasionally exchanged for a steamed bun or a bowl of soup, barely keeping food in their stomachs.

As the chaotic times approached, the common mortals were sinking into a sea of suffering. Their fates were bitter. Xiao Tuan, influenced by her surroundings, learned embroidery, needlework, and sewing from her mother. She was naturally intelligent and far superior to ordinary people. She learned quickly and helped her mother with her work.

Unfortunately, her mother's life was hard. The world was becoming chaotic, and it was difficult for a widow and her daughter to survive. Although they had a skill, they were inevitably bullied. They endured humiliation and swallowed their grievances, managing to get by. Xiao Tuan saw this and matured early, knowing she had to adapt.

When Xiao Tuan was five, her mother, overworked, fell seriously ill. Although it wasn't fatal, her hands and feet trembled, and she could no longer do embroidery or sewing. Xiao Tuan had to take over her mother's work, mending clothes for others to exchange for food.

Her mother, unable to bear being a burden, wanted to hang herself. But cloth was expensive, so she turned to the method of "swallowing a needle" to end her life. When Xiao Tuan returned home and saw her mother's tragic death, all sorts of emotions surged in her heart. She wailed for several days, trying to wake her mother, but the dead were gone, and her grief was useless.

Xiao Tuan thought, "My mother and I have been bullied so much. It's a good thing she's dead. As long as she can sleep peacefully in death, it's a joyous event." She immediately helped her mother prepare a resting place.

When Xiao Tuan was three, she vaguely knew one thing: her late father was buried on a barren hill. Next to her father's grave, there were several evergreen trees. It seemed the feng shui was good. To be buried there, she would have shade from the heat and trees to block the wind.

Unfortunately, someone had their eye on it. They dug up the grave and the body, throwing the bones elsewhere. That grave was occupied by a family from the same village. Her mother knew about it and went to reason with them. That family had three sons, all tall and strong, truly the village tyrants.

They beat her mother out. The mother and daughter were extremely frail and sought justice. But the village chief and villagers were unwilling to mediate, afraid of offending the tyrants. The mother and daughter had no choice but to work together to move her father's grave.

They chose a remote place to rebury him.

This incident offended the village tyrant. Occupying the grave wasn't enough; he often relieved himself on the new grave, an extreme provocation. The mother and daughter endured the bullying, swallowing their anger. But from that incident on, Xiao Tuan deeply felt the importance of peace in death. She thought, "The living, when bullied, can curse back. The dead, however, cannot fight back or talk back. Mother said that when Father was alive, he was tall and strong and had a chance to be elected village chief. But after death, people defecated on him, and he could do nothing about it. Mother... Mother must not suffer this fate!"

So she tried to give her mother a grand burial. But she had no savings and no strength. She couldn't even dig a grave. She was so worried her head spun. And the village tyrant's family wouldn't stop; they were still bullying Xiao Tuan. They wanted to forcibly take her into their home to be a child bride.

Finally, a villager couldn't stand it anymore and secretly found Xiao Tuan. He said to her, "Xiao Tuan, you're not bad-looking, very fresh and pretty. It's hard to stay in this village. Tomorrow, I'm taking a ox cart to deliver firewood to a master in the city. You hide your mother's body in the firewood pile on the cart."

"You... look for a way to sell yourself. This way, you can bury your mother, and it's better than being taken by that family as a child bride to be bullied for a lifetime."

Xiao Tuan agreed. She dragged her mother's body, hid it in the ox cart, and waited miserably all night. The plan went smoothly, and she was successfully transported into the city. Xiao Tuan laid out the body and used a relatively clean piece of cloth.

She embroidered the words "Selling myself to bury my mother" on it. The handwriting was graceful, hoping to catch the eye of a city master. Her looks were not bad, and she was very young with excellent skills. She was quickly chosen as a servant girl.

The steward of the Liu family in the city wanted to buy her for a hundred copper coins, but she had to return to the mansion immediately. Xiao Tuan pleaded, "Master, if I enter the mansion now, what about my mother... my mother? Can you give me a few days to bury my mother first..."

The steward said arrogantly, "Tsk, tsk, tsk, she's dead, what's there to bury? Or are you also precious, like those big masters, needing to pick and choose after death? Must you be buried in a feng shui treasure land?"

"You come with us to the mansion, and before long, someone will help you take care of it."

"Just throw her on the mass grave, heh, that's much more convenient."

Xiao Tuan said, "No, no, I just want my mother to rest in peace."

The steward cursed, "Ungrateful! Heh, then just wait and see. You'll be begging me to buy you soon." He turned and left. Two Liu family guards came over, standing one on each side of Xiao Tuan.

With this, who dared to buy her? Xiao Tuan dragged her mother and could only change locations. But the Liu family guards followed closely. The world was cruel, preying on the weak. Xiao Tuan felt hopeless. Just then, she heard the sound of approaching hoofbeats.

A gentle female voice came from inside the carriage: "Xiang Shu, stop."

Xiang Shu pulled the reins, and the carriage slowed to a stop. Xiang Shu asked, "Madam, what are your instructions?"

The gentle voice said, "Let me see that girl." Xiang Shu immediately jumped off the carriage and looked at Xiao Tuan's face. "Her appearance is delicate and acceptable."

The Liu family guards said sternly, "We don't know who you two are, but this girl has already caught the Liu family's eye."

The gentle voice spoke again: "Feel her knuckles. Does her middle finger have four joints?" Xiang Shu did as he was told and said, "Madam, you were right."

From inside the carriage came a soft murmur: "She will have to do."

The Liu family guards said sternly, "If you two don't know what's good for you, don't blame us for being impolite!"

The two made a move to intimidate. But they didn't know that the lady in the carriage, thinking of past events and having just been betrayed by her lover, was in an extremely foul mood. She said casually, "Noisy."

Xiang Shu immediately struck out. With two "thud" sounds, he hit the guards in their livers. The two guards flew backward, writhing in agony, screaming continuously. The Liu family steward heard the commotion and rushed to the scene. Seeing the situation, he didn't dare to show his face.

He immediately went back to the Liu family to get help. The lady sighed, "It seems my luck is bad. Buying a little girl has brought about such a scene."

Xiang Shu hurriedly said, "Madam has supreme luck, how could your fortune be bad? I'll get rid of these scoundrels right away." He flew up, his palm strikes fierce. He beat them all severely injured.

He even beat the Liu family steward half to death. Xiang Shu returned to the carriage. The lady said, "You, come with us."

Xiao Tuan was smart and knew this was directed at her. She stepped forward and said, "I need to bury my mother."

The lady said, "If you pass the test, what's difficult about burying your mother?" Xiao Tuan, having been bullied all her life, was surprised. "Ah? You... you agree? You must be a good person."

The lady couldn't be bothered to reply. Burying someone was a trivial matter to her. She treated her subordinates with clear rewards and punishments, so she didn't refuse. She said indifferently, "Follow us." Xiang Shu had already driven the carriage forward slowly. Xiao Tuan gritted her teeth and dragged her mother, following slowly behind.

They arrived at a mansion. Xiao Tuan saw the lady's figure from a distance. Her white dress fluttered, her hair like a long waterfall, her skin fair. She was exquisite, noble, and very beautiful. Every move was elegant and appropriate, but she seemed to be in a bad mood, with a slight resentment between her brows.

Xiao Tuan had never seen such a beauty and was instantly filled with admiration. She dragged her mother to the vicinity, getting closer to the lady, and felt she looked even better up close than from afar.

She knelt honestly in front of Wen Caishang. Seeing the lady sitting in a pavilion, legs crossed, skirt swaying gently, embroidered shoes exquisite, the clothes she wore were of extraordinary quality, a faint fragrance wafting from.

Wen Caishang asked about her identity, origin, and experiences. Xiao T一一 spoke, telling everything.

Wen Caishang nodded slightly and ordered Xiang Shu to prepare a hundred red sands, a hundred green sands, and a hundred yellow sands, placing them in a black clay pot. She said, "I give you one night to separate the sands. If you can complete it, I will bury your mother for you and choose a good feng shui grave site. If you can finish an hour early, I will kill that village tyrant's family for you."

She said indifferently, "If you cannot complete it, then leave."

Xiao Tuan felt as if she had been granted a great pardon and immediately set about separating the sands. She took out a silver needle and worked through the night, completely forgetting herself. When she finished separating the sands and went to ask Xiang Shu, there was still an hour until dawn.

Wen Caishang was slightly satisfied and said, "Not bad. Since that's the case, I will choose a place to bury your mother. Lead the way."

Xiao Tuan asked, "Lead the way where?" Wen Caishang said as usual, "I promised you one thing last night: if you finished early, I would help you kill the village tyrant's family."

Xiao Tuan hated the village tyrant extremely, but when it came to actually killing them, she hesitated. Wen Caishang said, "Lead the way." Xiao Tuan had no choice but to lead the way. Wen Caishang went to their door to claim their lives, and the entire village tyrant family was killed.

There was a young boy, about the same age as Xiao Tuan. Wen Caishang showed no mercy either, striking him dead with a single palm strike from mid-air. Xiao Tuan stared blankly. Seeing the village tyrant family dead, she felt neither pleasure nor joy. She silently took back the words, "You must be a good person."

Fear began to stir in her heart. Later, her mother was given a grand burial, and her father's grave was moved to be buried together. Xiao Tuan followed Wen Caishang away. Only later, upon reflection, did she realize the lady's methods were seasoned; she was establishing her authority at the time. Because Li Xian had left, Xiao Tuan was a candidate for the "Silk Garment" and needed to be trained with some methods.

Inside the Blue Fragrance Pavilion.

Xiao Tuan recalled the past and quietly slipped out through a side door. She thought to herself, "I wonder what kind of opportunity the Madam will give me. If it's a set of divine skills, hehe, that would be wonderful."

"The Madam is so powerful. If I could learn even half of it, that would be enough."
