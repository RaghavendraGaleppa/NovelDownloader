# Chapter 88: Sudden Change

Down the mountain, with the Wuzhou Army present, it was impossible to pass messages due to the need to prevent incursions by the Incense Fire Sect. News could only be transmitted through specific channels controlled by the Wuzhou Army.

Now that the grand situation was settled, in the days that followed, Xu Yunfan devoted himself entirely to cultivation.

He rose before dawn each day to practice, only resting when the moon reached its zenith.

Immersed in arduous training, deaf to the affairs of the outside world, and aided by ample Blood Qi Pills, he was rapidly pushing the Red Refining Copper Body Cloak Hammer to its perfection.

After practice that day, Xu Yunfan looked at the data on his system panel.

The proficiency of the Red Refining Copper Body Cloak Hammer had reached four thousand, just one final step away from perfection.

He took out a Blood Qi Pill and swallowed it, feeling the medicinal power dissolve within him, nourishing every inch of his bones and sinews.

He had completed eighty percent of the five thousand proficiency points, with less than a thousand remaining to be honed.

With the assistance of the Heavenly Cicada Sect's pills, his daily proficiency increase was around twenty to thirty points.

At most, within two months, his skin tempering would reach perfection, manifesting a golden skin state.

As for the Heavenly Cicada Strength, Xu Yunfan glanced at the attribute panel in his vision.

It was not far from mastery.

According to his progress, it would definitely reach mastery within half a month.

***

The Wuzhou provincial city remained steadfast.

At the third quarter of the Yin period (3:45 AM), the horn blast tore through the morning mist.

One hundred thousand Xuanjia Army soldiers transformed into seven steel torrents, surging along the waterways of Wuzhou.

Ning Wuque stood at the camp gate, watching the contingent belonging to the Heavenly Cicada Sect. One thousand two hundred heavy cavalrymen wore black scale armor, with specially made city-breaking crossbows hanging beside their saddles. The arrowheads were spiral-shaped—Cloud-Piercing Arrows specifically designed to counter hard body training.

The core martial arts of the Heavenly Cicada Sect naturally possessed hard body effects.

"Commander Ning, please."

The eunuch supervisor pointed his horsetail whisk toward the southeast, where the silhouette of Thunder Accumulation Mountain flickered in the dawn.

Twelve Golden Blade Guards behind the eunuch stepped forward simultaneously, the iron soles of their boots scraping sparks from the ground. These twelve Golden Blade Guards all had pale faces with no beards, their features carrying a feminine air—they were all eunuchs.

Ning Wuque remained silent for a moment, tugged his reins, and accepted the order to depart.

Passing by the Green Mist Sect camp along the way, Ning Wuque smelled a thick scent of blood.

The Green Mist Seven Masters, who had still been sparring sword techniques yesterday, were now being dragged behind war horses as human road markers, their bones pierced by iron chains.

Their swords were插在 the camp gate, the tassels dripping blood droplets in the wind.

The disciples of the Green Mist Sect, one of the five ridges and seven mountains of Wuzhou, had refused to submit last night and were slaughtered by the Xuanjia Army.

Ning Wuque's gaze shifted to a corner where two men lay with wide, furious eyes, dying with their eyes open.

They were the true disciples of the Heavenly Cicada Sect, Pi Zhi'an and Zhu Yi.

They had refused to surrender initially, so he had pierced their hearts with his sword to offer a pledge of loyalty.

He turned his head to look at the remaining Heavenly Cicada Sect disciples following him. Ning Wuque's expression, flickering with unspeakable light, quickly calmed down, his gaze deep.

"Don't blame me. If you must blame something, blame your bad luck."

Standing atop Thunder Accumulation Mountain, Xu Yunfan looked up at the ever-present dark clouds ahead. Lightning flashed and thunder rumbled in the center, with startling thunderbolts occasionally falling.

He stretched his arms like a crane, and as he swayed, tremors actually emanated from within his body. As his entire skeleton vibrated simultaneously, it actually sounded like cicada chirping.

The sound began like fine rain hitting tiles, instantly transforming into a downpour, and finally sounded like thousands of golden cicadas chirping madly within his body.

In just three months, the Heavenly Cicada Strength martial art had reached mastery, and it was happening today.

He was in no hurry to break through to the Outer Three Unions realm. Although he had read the Pure Yang One Qi Technique repeatedly and could almost recite it backwards, he had not practiced it yet, merely continuously accumulating perfection in his muscles, bones, and skin.

Today, with the Heavenly Cicada Strength reaching mastery, it would naturally add a point to his strength.

'You practiced the Heavenly Cicada Strength diligently. Threads of strength vibrated with your bones, producing cicada chirps. Under high-frequency bone vibration, you unleashed unimaginable attacks. Heavenly Cicada Strength proficiency increased.'

'Through constant practice, you grasped the essence of Heavenly Cicada Strength. The frequency and intensity of bone vibration reached a new height. Heavenly Cicada Strength proficiency increased.'

'...'

Until the sun slanted west, Xu Yunfan was bathed in the crimson sunset, his body glowing red, his bulging, diamond-shaped muscles like a sculpture.

The blood vessels under his skin suddenly knotted into a network, and dark red blood lines ran wildly along the muscle textures.

Xu Yunfan could clearly feel his blood surging faster, the pounding of his heart even overpowering the thunderstorm above his head. This was the sign of Heavenly Cicada Strength breaking through its critical point.

'Your Heavenly Cicada Strength has reached mastery.'

'Heaveny Cicada Strength 0/5000 (Mastery)

Special Effects: Bone-Penetrating Thunder Pattern, Cicada Strength, Thousand Chirps Forming Blade, Pulse Uniting Cicada Rhythm,金刚 Iron Diaphragm, Myriad Bone Armor, Startling Cicada Piercing the Void'

Instantly, warm currents generated within his body, soaking his bones. Originally, due to the Iron Bridge Fortification Bone Tempering Chapter, he had tempered an iron skeleton. Under the Heavenly Cicada Strength, it began to gradually transform into a jade-like quality. At the same time, the changes in his bones began to have a rapid impact on his body.

The right arm's humerus mutated first; the originally hard bone quality actually writhed and reorganized like a living thing.

The bone membrane surface浮现细密的蝉翼纹路, and every tremor triggered a chain reaction in the tendons.

Xu Yunfan clenched his fist fiercely. The muscles of his forearm instantly contracted into a block of iron, and the knotted muscle fibers actually pushed the skin out to form distinct grooves.

With his previous foundation, Xu Yunfan felt no pain. On the contrary, some areas that hadn't been fully trained began to slowly be filled in.

"Crack!"

He tentatively stepped forward half a step, the sound of his foot arch crushing the blue rock mixing into the thunderstorm.

At this moment, his entire skeleton seemed to have turned into a resonance cavity. Every time his heart beat, new shockwaves spread from his chest to his limbs.

In his mind, memories of cultivating Heavenly Cicada Strength to mastery continuously surfaced. The scenes of arduous and cruel training in those memories made Xu Yunfan grit his teeth just looking at them.

"Bang!"

His right fist struck the rock wall without any flourish. At the moment of contact, the bones of his entire arm completed seven high-frequency vibrations.

The hard granite first showed spiderweb cracks, then exploded into stone powder from the inside.

Xu Yunfan looked at his right arm buried in the rock wall up to the elbow. The surface of his skin was fading from an abnormal crimson. After Heavenly Cicada Strength reached mastery, when exerting force, fine red lines would appear on the skin.

"Hm?"

Standing atop the mountain peak, he looked down and saw a small, snake-like line of troops at the foot of the mountain, advancing toward Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

***

When the army arrived at Flying Eagle Gorge, the morning sun was hanging over the main peak of Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

Suddenly, a earth-shattering roar came from outside the mountain gate.

On the training ground, disciples who had just finished their morning practice were thrown into chaos.

Someone's sword tangle got caught in their hair bun. A stumbling disciple hugged a copper furnace and fell to the ground, spilling scalding charcoal all over themselves.

A mountain guard scrambled into the main hall, a half-broken Cloud-Piercing Arrow stuck in his back.

"Xuanjia... It's the Tiger Vanguard Xuanjia! Enemy attack!!!"

The desperate cry of "enemy attack" instantly resounded throughout the entire sect.

Chu Xuan shot out from her room, grabbing the collar of an outer disciple who was fleeing up from halfway down the mountain. "Speak clearly! What's happening?"

Before she finished speaking, the mountain gate collapsed with a rumble. Eight hundred Xuanjia heavy cavalry surged in like a black tide. Amidst the tremors caused by three thousand iron-clad soldiers trampling the mountain gate, Ning Wuque's voice, as gentle as ever, made his declaration.

"By imperial decree, I am here to eliminate the rebels. I request the Master to accept death."
