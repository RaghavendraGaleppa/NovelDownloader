# Chapter 14: Selecting Ink Spirit Bamboo Seeds and Obtaining the Complete Cultivation Manual  

"That guy has nerves of steel!"  

Chu Ning sighed to himself but didn't hesitate. With swift hand seals, he cast his own Blade Edge spell.  

"Clang!"  

The two magical blades collided with a metallic ring. In the next instant, Qiu Shunyi's blade dissipated into nothingness, while Chu Ning's continued forward, slicing through several stalks of Red Spirit Rice before vanishing.  

Seeing this, Qiu Shunyi finally breathed a sigh of relief and called out apologetically, "Chu Ning, I'm sorry! I... I don't know what came over me just now."  

But after witnessing Chu Ning's spell, Qiu Shunyi couldn't deny the truth of Shang Zhaoxiang's words. His face filled with envy as he said, "Chu Ning, you've really reached the second level of Qi Refinement? We started cultivating at the same time, and I haven't even touched the threshold of the second level yet."  

"It was just luck. Maybe the Evergreen Wood Technique suits me well," Chu Ning replied casually, offering a plausible excuse.  

Of course, he couldn't reveal that he was already nearing the threshold of the fourth level of Qi Refinement. Still, his explanation wasn't entirely false—his Yin Wood Spiritual Body was indeed well-suited for wood-element techniques and spells, making the Evergreen Wood Technique a natural fit.  

Chu Ning's reasoning convinced the other three present. Compatibility with cultivation techniques was a known phenomenon, though it usually only became apparent after actual practice. They could only sigh in admiration at Chu Ning's good fortune.  

After Chu Ning and Cao Dongxin left, Shang Zhaoxiang couldn't help but remark again, "Reaching the second level of Qi Refinement in three months might not compare to those with exceptional talent, but among outer disciples, it's quite impressive. After the assessment in a few days, Chu Ning should be assigned better spirit fields. He might not even need to cultivate Red Spirit Rice anymore."  

Hearing this, Qiu Shunyi's eyes once again brimmed with envy.  

They all knew that better spirit fields and higher-grade spiritual plants meant greater income. But for him, there was no catching up now—the assessment was only four days away.  

Meanwhile, Chu Ning reflected that he needed to learn more spells, especially offensive and defensive ones. Qiu Shunyi's reckless Blade Edge spell had caught him off guard, and though he'd countered in time, Blade Edge wasn't his forte. He resolved to focus on wood-element spells, which he could master more quickly.  

Four days passed in the blink of an eye.  

---  

The group gathered once more, joined by He Changyou and Zhuang Yunde, who had escorted them three months prior.  

"Elder He!"  

Amidst the greetings, He Changyou nodded and surveyed the nearly thirty disciples. His gaze settled on Chu Ning and another named Yuan Guang.  

"You two have reached the second level of Qi Refinement? Not bad!" A faint smile crossed He Changyou's face.  

At his words, the other twenty-eight disciples, including Qiu Shunyi, looked at Chu Ning and Yuan Guang with envy. Chu Ning had already noticed that Yuan Guang was the only other disciple to reach the second level among those who had begun cultivating at the same time. He breathed an inward sigh of relief—standing out as one of two was far better than being the sole exception.  

Displaying the second level was necessary to obtain the complete Evergreen Wood Technique, but Chu Ning had worried about drawing too much attention. Fortunately, the situation worked in his favor.  

He Changyou continued, "Let's begin the assessment. First, demonstrate your proficiency in the Growth Spell."  

He distributed a seed to each disciple.  

"This is a basic Red Spirit Rice grain. Since you've all cultivated it before—having just harvested the early crop and preparing for the late season—try sprouting it."  

As He Changyou finished speaking, the disciples took the seeds and began casting the Growth Spell. Red Spirit Rice was relatively easy to sprout, and Chu Ning, already skilled in the spell, deliberately moderated his spiritual energy while still showcasing his ability.  

He had decided beforehand to demonstrate competence in the Growth, Purification, and even Wood Spring spells, while downplaying his Rain Blessing and Blade Edge skills. By crafting an image of someone naturally attuned to wood-element techniques, he could avoid suspicion while paving the way for his future plans.  

Thus, Chu Ning's seed was the first to sprout and grow.  

"Stop!"  

He Changyou's command brought the test to an end. The disciples' expressions varied—most had succeeded in sprouting the seed, though only a few had achieved significant growth.  

Chu Ning and Yuan Guang led the group, with Chu Ning's seedling reaching nearly an inch in height and Yuan Guang's half that.  

He Changyou recorded the results before moving on to the other spells.  

Chu Ning excelled again in the Purification Spell but performed slightly worse than Yuan Guang in Rain Blessing and Blade Edge. Overall, their spellcasting abilities were roughly equal.  

Finally, He Changyou announced the results.  

"Out of thirty disciples, twenty-two have passed. Chu Ning, Yuan Guang, Chen Youdao, Zhang Hui, Qiu Shunyi..."  

After listing the twenty-two names, the remaining eight looked crestfallen. He Changyou dismissed them with a wave.  

"Return to your senior brothers for further training. You'll be reassessed in a year."  

"Aside from Chu Ning and Yuan Guang, the remaining twenty will each be allocated five mu of spirit fields—three mu of lower-grade and two mu of mid-grade in the D-tier—for cultivating Red Spirit Rice."  

"Chu Ning and Yuan Guang will each receive ten mu—five mu of upper-grade and five mu of mid-grade D-tier fields."  

This announcement naturally sparked envy among the other twenty. Chu Ning and Yuan Guang not only received double the land but also started with mid-grade and upper-grade fields, a significant advantage.  

He Changyou then turned to Chu Ning and Yuan Guang.  

"You've both gained some understanding of spiritual plants. What do you intend to cultivate?"  

Yuan Guang, clearly prepared, answered eagerly, "Elder He, I plan to grow Purple Spirit Potatoes and Spirit Rice."  

He Changyou nodded—these were common choices for upper and mid-grade D-tier fields. He then looked at Chu Ning.  

"And you?"  

After a brief pause, Chu Ning replied, "Elder He, for the mid-grade fields, I'll cultivate Spirit Rice. For the upper-grade, I'd like to grow Ink Spirit Bamboo."  

He Changyou raised an eyebrow in surprise. Ink Spirit Bamboo, used to make basic talisman paper, was more challenging to cultivate than Purple Spirit Potatoes and was typically reserved for experienced D-tier cultivators.  

"Are you certain?" he asked with a slight frown.  

When Chu Ning confirmed, He Changyou didn't press further. After all, disciples were free to choose their crops as long as they met the sect's quotas.  

Finally, he retrieved two booklets from his storage pouch and handed them to Chu Ning and Yuan Guang.  

"According to regulations, those who reach the second level of Qi Refinement are entitled to the complete version of the Evergreen Wood Technique..."  

Chu Ning eagerly accepted the booklet. It resembled the one he'd received upon joining the sect, bearing the title *Evergreen Wood Technique*, but was noticeably thicker.  

*The complete Evergreen Wood Technique—including the fourth-level cultivation method!*
