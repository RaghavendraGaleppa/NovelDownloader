# Chapter 178: What Kind of Monster Is This Kid?

“You’re the one who chose him.”

Bai Jinghong spread his hands and laughed helplessly.

The other was still using a sword, yet you’re already sweating buckets?

Cao Mu was meditating nearby, not even lifting his eyelids. His meaning was clear.

*No exchange.*

“Heh, do you really think I’m afraid? I never planned to switch people anyway.”

“He stepped onto the stage on the first day. He probably won’t even run into me before his Soul Energy and True Essence are depleted.”

Wu Chushu snorted coldly.

The Sword Trial lasts for three days.

Even if his opponent’s True Essence runs out, it doesn’t mean Wu Chushu would necessarily win.

Besides.

Although Li Mo’s swordsmanship is astonishing, at least he could hold his own against him. It would be much harder to deal with Ying Bing or Jiang Chulong.

...

On the stage.

Sensing countless gazes falling upon him, Little Li let out a long breath.

*Ah, satisfying.*

Previously, he had some slight regrets. In reality, the martial arts insights he had poured into the *Solitary Nine Swords* had exceeded the scope of mere "business."

However, at this moment, his heart was filled with joy. He felt that if one couldn't even do what makes oneself happy, what meaning would life have?

He didn't have any mortal enemies he *had* to defeat, nor the heavy responsibility of saving the world.

Li Mo spoke clearly to the crowd again:

“Is there any other hero who wishes to step onto the stage and exchange a few moves?”

“The reward I mentioned earlier will remain valid for these three days.”

The crowd immediately boiled with excitement.

Most people came here, after all, to broaden their horizons and learn from others.

The qualification to observe the Hengyun Sword Mark had little to do with them to begin with.

Challenging Li Mo not only offered monetary rewards but also allowed them to discover their own shortcomings.

Could there be such a good thing?

“I’ll go!”

“Brother Li Mo is indeed just like Brother Jiang Chen’s persona—a kind-hearted gentleman who loves to help others...”

“Who said that? The male lead in the picture books doesn’t have such strength.”

“After this, who knows how the Hidden Dragon List will change.”

A long line formed in front of Li Mo’s arena.

Even Zhong Zhenyue from the next arena couldn't help but glance over frequently, clearly interested in him.

However, arena masters were not allowed to fight each other.

Besides, if he went down now, he wouldn’t even be able to get a spot in the queue.

There were many challengers to Li Mo.

Little Li was quite authoritative in the field of teaching.

When he spotted a flaw, he would explain it to his opponent one by one, while simultaneously deconstructing their martial arts and incorporating them into his own sword style.

Now, relying solely on his swordsmanship, he was confident he could defeat opponents two or three acupoints higher in realm than himself.

Not far away.

Bai Jinghong felt that whether he stretched his neck out or retracted it, he was bound to get chopped.

Thus, he sighed and stepped onto the stage.

“I am Bai Jinghong.”

He cupped his fists slightly, suppressing his aura to the Internal Qi Realm.

The purpose of the Sword Trial segment was to select martial arts geniuses.

After all, the higher one's martial arts talent, the better the martial arts one could comprehend from the Hengyun Sword Mark. He had to follow the rules and suppress his realm.

“Please advise.”

“I dare not... I dare not.”

Jiang Chulong shook her little head like a rattle drum.

Being treated with such courtesy, she was at a loss, secretly glancing at Li Mo from a distance.

Then, imitating Li Mo’s manner, she said:

“Please... please go ahead and... make the first move.”

“Alright.”

Bai Jinghong dared not show any contempt, putting his mind on full alert.

Seizing the initiative meant seizing the opportunity!

With a wave of his hand, he activated his Hanguang Sword Body with his Internal Qi.

Sword Qi surged like a tide—it was the Hengyun Sword Qi.

And within the Sword Qi, multiple changes were contained.

This was a move his Eldest Senior Sister had悟悟ed after sitting silently before the Sword Mark for three years.

Exclamations rose from below the stage. Before the vast Sword Qi, Jiang Chulong’s petite figure seemed incredibly fragile and insignificant...

The furious tide swept forth.

A rare look of seriousness appeared on Jiang Chulong’s little face.

She did not dodge or evade.

Facing the Sword Qi tide that would wound her at the slightest touch, her delicate body resembled a withered grass dancing in the wind, or a small fish swimming freely in the river and sea. No matter how violent the Sword Qi was, it could not harm her in the slightest.

She was like wild grass.

Weak yet tenacious.

*Slap—*

A light sound rang out. A peach wood branch slapped onto the back of Bai Jinghong’s hand.

The famous sword clattered to the ground.

Bai Jinghong stood frozen in place, disbelief in his eyes. He had never imagined his Sword Qi would be broken in such a way. It completely exceeded his understanding!

---

He suddenly began to doubt his life.

He used to think that aside from his Eldest Senior Sister, no one had a better talent for the sword than him.

“Are you... are you okay?”

“Sorry... Actually, you... you aren’t... particularly weak...”

“It’s mainly... mainly because my teacher... taught me well...”

Jiang Chulong apologized clumsily, unsure of how to comfort him.

Bai Jinghong: “...”

He doubted his life even more.

...

The onlookers were already dumbfounded.

One of the Three Heroes of Hengyun, a genius on the Hidden Dragon List, had lost in such a manner?

The Elders were frowning as well. If they suppressed their realm to the Internal Qi Realm, it seemed... they couldn't achieve what that little girl did either?

Just moments ago, Cao Mu had also lost.

Facing that god-like swordsmanship, he didn't even last until the third sword.

Talent is hard to judge.

However, Ying Bing’s performance seemed even superior to that little girl’s!

If the Elders hadn't seen the world, they would almost think the world had turned upside down.

“In the historical records, when the Ancestral Martial Emperor studied in Sword City, was there ever such a stunning performance?”

“If he didn't hide his strength back then, probably not.”

“By the time they comprehend the Divine Realm through five or six acupoints, the Hidden Dragon List will undergo a great change.”

“It is our fortune that they came to Sword City to comprehend the Sword Mark.”

At this moment.

Almost no one went up to challenge Ying Bing or Jiang Chulong.

Why go up? Even Hidden Dragon List geniuses had lost. Were they going up just to get beaten?

However, Little Li’s side was still lively.

“This little guy, *tsk*... how to put it, he’s strange.”

Elder Zeng put down the picture book *The Overbearing Empress Falls for Me*, stroked his long beard, and said:

“Saying he’s strong, yet it seems he’s only good at sword techniques.”

The Elders nodded. They felt this strange sensation too.

To put it in an analogy.

They were like mathematics professors seeing someone who has applied formulas to the extreme.

Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, Sword Intent—he has none of them.

He relies purely on superior technique.

要知道, even if one doesn't deliberately practice Sword Qi, Sword Momentum, or Sword Intent, one would inevitably have a trace of them.

What kind of monster is this kid?

...

On the stage.

【Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Huang Donglai', preventing him from returning to a small county town and missing out on the grand era.】

【Investment Feedback: Seven-Striped盈Void Pill.】

That’s right.

Little Li had just stopped Huang Donglai, making him change his mind and come challenge on his stage.

The two had a fairly exhilarating exchange.

“I yield.”

Li Mo handed over a gold bill.

“I am ashamed.”

Huang Donglai looked at the gold bill, feeling a bit embarrassed.

But he still carefully checked it to make sure there were no tracking devices or poison on it before carefully putting it away.

Li Mo: “......”

He saw many bottles and jars inside Huang Donglai’s inner shirt, quite a few of which were clearly not healing medicines.

There was even a jar of quicklime.

During their earlier exchange, he clearly saw Huang Donglai subconsciously reach to dig for it, though he held back.

Bringing quicklime to a fight at the Divine Realm level... isn't that just pure muscle memory?

After Huang Donglai left.

Li Mo let out a light breath.

He had exchanged moves with at least eighty people just now.

And he used Martial Arts Insights simultaneously.

He was just one step away...

*Solitary Nine Swords* is not merely a sword art; it can also be used to improve one's realm.

If he used the *Celestial Stars Mysterious Pill Sutra*, wouldn't he have to forge another Mysterious Pill?

He wondered if that would still count as a Mysterious Pill...

At this moment.

A figure stepped onto the stage.

“I am Wu Chushu. Please advise.”

It was Wu Chushu in his blue robe.

He had no choice but to go up.

Because he realized that as time passed, Li Mo’s True Essence seemed endless, showing no signs of weakening!

True Essence couldn't possibly be endless.

That only meant the opponent's recovery speed was unimaginable!

While his True Essence hadn't weakened, his swordsmanship was becoming increasingly unpredictable and stronger!

If he didn't go up now, he really wouldn't have any chance left.
