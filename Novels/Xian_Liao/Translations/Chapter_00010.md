# Chapter 10: Flicking Fingers

Cloves, sweetgrass, costus root, patchouli... Zhou Qing visited several herbal shops to gather these ingredients, along with some common medicinal herbs for nourishment.

The next step was to grind the processed herbs like cloves and patchouli into powder, mix them with honey, and knead them into pills. The simplicity of making Five Fragrance Pills was precisely why Zhou Qing had chosen to start with them.

The tools for grinding herbs were already available in the storage room, so there was no need to purchase anything extra. Zhou Qing began practicing the art of pestling herbs.

After a while, the medicinal powder was ready. His right hand had grown considerably stronger, and the Tiger Play exercises had significantly improved the flexibility and steadiness of both hands.

As Zhou Qing repeatedly ground the herbs into powder, he paid close attention to how different amounts of force and varying directions affected the outcome. Each type of herb he processed gave him new insights and understanding. It felt almost divinely guided.

"My observational skills and concentration seem to have improved significantly," Zhou Qing mused.

After finishing with all the herbs, he sat on a stone bench in the courtyard to rest. The cool evening breeze of early summer quickly dried the sweat on his face, leaving him with an indescribable sense of satisfaction.

He had once heard that physical exercise could be addictive but never quite believed it. Now, after his experience with the Five Animal Frolics, he was convinced. Any activity related to physical training had become a source of joy for him.

Transforming oneself was difficult, but strengthening oneself brought happiness.

Whenever he felt mentally exhausted after training, Zhou Qing would silently recite passages from classical texts:

"When Heaven is about to confer a great responsibility on a man, it first exercises his mind with suffering, his muscles and bones with toil..." 

Reciting this passage from Mencius's *Born in Worry, Die in Ease* gradually replenished his spirit, washing away all traces of fatigue. If practicing the Five Animal Frolics nourished the body, then silently reciting these ancient texts seemed to nourish his mind. In fact, he felt as though he could absorb the wisdom embedded within these words.

Zhou Qing analyzed this phenomenon: perhaps his soul was stronger than most people's due to that out-of-body experience, while the subsequent weakness was simply his body struggling to handle the toll of such an event.

"Should I try it again after I've fully recovered?" he wondered.

Regardless, physical health was the foundation of everything. For now, Zhou Qing had no intention of attempting anything as extraordinary as soul projection again.

After resting and regaining his energy, Zhou Qing began mixing honey into the medicinal powder to form pills. Thanks to Jiangzhou's thriving commerce and beekeeping techniques imported from overseas, honey was relatively affordable.

Staring at the unsightly pills in his hand moments later, Zhou Qing shook his head. He shouldn't have used his right hand. The imbalance between his hands was stark—not just in strength but also in the toughness of his skin. While his right hand excelled at heavy labor, it wasn't suited for delicate tasks like pill-making.

Switching to his left hand proved more successful. Thanks to the Tiger Play exercises, his left hand had become quite dexterous, while his right hand had lost some finesse from practicing Black Tiger Steals the Heart. The contrast was now reversed, with his left hand surpassing the right in agility.

Soon, Zhou Qing smiled with satisfaction at the smooth, round Five Fragrance Pills before him. The first attempt was clumsy, but the second was much better. With each pill he made, his skill improved.

Eventually, one hundred perfectly shaped pills lay neatly on a piece of gauze. He placed them in his room to dry for a full day and night. Since the pills contained insect-repelling ingredients, he wasn't worried about pests interfering.

Night had just fallen, and under the bright moonlight, Zhou Qing wasn't ready to sleep yet. The courtyard was secluded, so he didn't have to worry about disturbing any neighbors with his activities.

Gathering small stones from the yard, he stood ten paces away from the large mulberry tree and began flicking them at the trunk with his right hand.

*Thud... thud... thud...*

As his right hand grew stronger from practicing Black Tiger Steals the Heart, Zhou Qing recalled a fictional martial art called "Flicking Finger Divine Skill" from a novel he'd once read. Stones were readily available, cost nothing, and were easy to carry—making them an ideal weapon for his current situation.

Though his scholar status allowed him to carry a sword, he couldn't afford one. While swordsmanship might be more elegant, stone-flicking was far more practical at this stage. Zhou Qing was nothing if not pragmatic.

The mulberry tree in the courtyard was unusually large—over fifty feet tall with a canopy like a grand pavilion. It was quite peculiar, but Zhou Qing had yet to notice anything supernatural about it. The ghostly incidents that had occurred in the yard before his arrival might not have been related to the tree at all.

In fact, he hadn't encountered anything strange since moving in. He suspected it might have something to do with his Tiger Play practice. Tigers that cultivated into human form became Mountain Lords, capable of commanding spirits. Any ordinary ghosts or supernatural beings would naturally fear the tiger's aura emanating from him.

As he continued practicing his flicking technique, his accuracy improved steadily. He wasn't using full strength—the stones didn't even leave marks on the thick bark.

First, he focused on precision, then gradually increased the force. With relentless practice, his aim became sharper. By daylight, he could use the tree's leaves as targets.

Finally, when one stone flew out with perfect fluidity, Zhou Qing exhaled in satisfaction. Rubbing his slightly sore fingers, he turned his attention to the *Nourishing Life Manual*.

Sure enough, a new entry appeared:

**Martial Skill: Flicking Finger Divine Skill (Novice).**

"Novice" meant he had grasped the basics, but that was all. To reliably hit targets within ten paces, he needed much more practice—at least until he reached the "Proficient" level, like his Black Tiger Steals the Heart.

Now he had two self-defense skills: Black Tiger Steals the Heart for close combat and Flicking Finger Divine Skill for mid-range engagements. Given his current level, the stones' power was still limited. He would need to refine his technique to increase their force, perhaps drawing inspiration from the Tiger Play and Black Tiger Steals the Heart.

Maybe one day, he could make the stones as deadly as bullets from a handgun. For now, that goal remained distant. Still, acquiring a new skill was always cause for celebration.

Zhou Qing loved this gradual sense of growth.

He resumed practicing the Tiger Play, though progress had slowed significantly since reaching the initial stage. He noticed that practicing the Deer Play seemed to slightly enhance his Tiger Play advancement. The Five Animal Frolics likely complemented each other—focusing solely on one would inevitably lead to bottlenecks.

For now, Zhou Qing would still prioritize the Tiger Play, as its physical benefits were the most pronounced.

Under the moonlight, he continued his training. Even if progress was slow, his heightened perception and the feedback from the *Nourishing Life Manual* assured him that his efforts were bearing fruit. 

People weren't afraid of hard work—they were afraid of hard work without results. No one liked disappointment.
