# Chapter 42: A Share of the Spoils, Dragon’s Roar Charcoal is Precious

In the southeast corner of the manor, there was an open space surrounded by large reservoirs. In the very center stood a massive red-copper cauldron.

It was here that the refined food was boiled. As soon as Pang Long announced the start of the refinement, everyone was immediately invigorated.

A group of over a dozen men gathered in front of the cauldron.

“Remove the lid!”

Pang Long ordered.

Li Xian and the other guards climbed a wooden ladder to the top of the cauldron. The cauldron was a full three meters high, and its body was incredibly heavy.

It had four ears, and the rim of the cauldron was thick enough for several people to stand on.

Once they had a firm footing, Li Xian bent over, grabbed the lid with both hands, and looked at the others around him.

After exchanging glances, everyone nodded and began to exert their strength together.

*Rumble...*

The lid was moved half an inch, a heavy sound echoing all around.

Including Li Xian, there were five people lifting the lid. With their combined strength, they could only barely raise it slightly. The sheer weight of this object was truly astonishing.

“Internal Qi can be considered a type of strength. By circulating Internal Qi and wrapping it around a heavy object, it becomes much easier to lift.”

“But this thing is huge and thick. My Internal Qi is difficult to envelop it with, making it extremely strenuous to lift.”

Li Xian gritted his teeth, using all his strength to raise the lid another three inches.

The lid was square. Seeing how much the group was struggling, Pang Long shouted, “Bring a rope!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a guard threw a yellow rope. Pang Long reached out and caught it, whipping the rope like a lash toward the lid.

With a *snap*, the rope coiled around the lid. Pang Long then flicked his wrist and pulled back.

He tied a knot in mid-air, securing the lid firmly.

“Excellent skill!”

Li Xian praised.

Pang Long smiled, passed the rope to the other guards, and said, “You lot pull with all your might. Work together to take the lid down.”

This turned into a tug-of-war. Li Xian and the others pushed from above, while a dozen or so guards pulled from below.

With their combined effort, it took a tremendous amount of strength before they could finally remove the lid.

It crashed into the snow, shaking the ground for three tremors.

Li Xian’s hands and feet trembled slightly, a normal condition from expending too much energy.

“Just opening the cauldron is already such a hassle.”

“When I was a servant, I never had the chance to touch these things.”

He couldn't help but feel a sense of emotion. The last time refined food was boiled, Li Xian had been waiting outside the manor, fetching water back and forth.

Times had changed. This time, he could get a share of the spoils.

“Be careful with your movements.”

“This is Dragon’s Roar Charcoal. A single palm-sized piece costs one tael of silver.”

“If you damage any, according to the manor rules, it will be deducted from your salary. Keep your hands and feet light!”

After opening the cauldron, it was time to arrange the charcoal.

Placing the fire charcoal at the bottom of the large cauldron, this “Dragon’s Roar Charcoal” was cylindrical, with hundreds of tiny holes on its body.

One piece could burn for a very long time, and the heat was extremely high, with a penetrating fire quality. It was a common type of charcoal used for boiling refined food.

When burning, it would make a “whooshing” sound, like the breath of a great dragon, hence the name “Dragon’s Roar Charcoal.”

“One tael of charcoal is worth one tael of gold.”

Li Xian clicked his tongue.

It seemed that anything related to the Madam was incredibly expensive. He now had a much deeper understanding of the phrase “spending money like flowing water.”

There were about a thousand pieces of charcoal, arranged in a shape that was wide at the bottom and pointed at the top. Then, Pang Long ignited the fire.

The great fire roared, scorching the air until it distorted. The fire from the “Dragon’s Roar Charcoal” was extremely special; the flame was a pale yellow mixed with purple. Although it burned vigorously, it clung tightly to the cauldron walls.

At first glance, it looked as if the cauldron was adorned with a layer of flame patterns.

After finishing this, Li Xian and the others’ work finally came to an end for the time being. Pang Long walked straight to the inner courtyard and returned with four pieces of meat in his hands.

The meat had a strange color, a grayish-brown.

One large piece and three small ones. The large one was about the size of three fists, while the small ones were about the size of a small thumb knuckle.

Once the cauldron was heated to scorching, Pang Long threw the meat into it, producing a “sizzling” sound.

A green smoke rose from the cauldron. Li Xian took a strong sniff and found it very pungent.

“Don’t sniff!”

“That stuff is poisonous.”

Pang Long warned. Li Xian was startled and immediately took three steps back, moving away from the roaring fire of the cauldron.

“Commander Pang, was that the meat of the Snow Demon Monkey you just threw in?” Li Xian asked curiously.

“Correct.” Pang Long nodded.

“The Snow Demon Monkey isn’t that small, why not cook it all?” Li Xian asked.

“It can’t be cooked.” Pang Long pointed to the ‘Dragon’s Roar Charcoal’ and said, “Everything has to do with cost.”

“Theoretically, the entire Snow Demon Monkey can barely be considered [Refined Food], but... the meat that is truly suitable for stewing is only the piece from the back of the neck.”

“I’ve already thrown all of it in just now.”

“Commander Pang, please explain.” Li Xian was very eager to learn. He felt the explanation on “cost” was still unclear, so he humbly asked for guidance.

Pang Long didn’t understand these things either, but he had heard the Madam say it before, so he recited it all now: “As long as you are willing to spend the effort, the flesh and blood of a demon can always have its toxicity removed and boiled into ‘Refined Food’ to be consumed.”

“It all depends on whether it’s worth it. A demon like the Snow Demon Monkey emerges in winter and hibernates in summer. It likes to eat human livers and gallbladders, and its movements are unpredictable. Among its flesh and blood, the piece on the back of the neck has the least toxicity.”

“Boiling it for two days and one night can remove all the toxicity.”

“However, other parts have their toxicity multiplied. It would require six days and six nights to remove the toxicity and consume it as refined food.”

“这样一来，却很不划算。因为烧六天六夜，这其中所损耗的‘龙鸣炭’，价值便有上万多两。”

“且这雪妖猴，并非很贵重的精食，食用效用有限，不必为此大费钱财。”

Li Xian secretly took note. It turns out that martial artists also care about [cost] and [cost-effectiveness].

He looked at the burning copper cauldron and secretly estimated that this pot of refined food was worth over a thousand taels of silver.

Warriors, warriors who have undergone a complete transformation... the expenses involved are truly unimaginably large.

“Right now, I’m just a mere guard...”

“From this perspective, the realm of [Eating the Essence] in the martial path is truly a world away.”

This distance cannot be bridged simply by bitter training.

It requires opportunity, luck... all sorts of things. It made Li Xian feel like he was a frog at the bottom of a deep well looking up at the vast sky. To become the frog that leaves the well was as difficult as ascending to the heavens.

After half an hour of boiling, Pang Long began to call out to the servants to shovel snow, sift snow, and transport snow.

The sifted snowflakes were crystal clear. When poured into the large cauldron, they would sizzle and turn into splashes of water. As the splashes increased, they condensed into boiling soup.

Boiling in the great fire, it was consumed at an incredibly fast rate. To prevent it from drying out, they could only continuously sift snow, transport it, and pour it in.

Constantly replenishing the water supply to maintain a dynamic balance, keeping the contents of the cauldron in a constant state of boiling.

The evaporated water vapor would carry away the toxicity of the flesh.

With snow piled up everywhere, it would be a waste not to use it.

When refining refined treasures, “water” is the biggest consumable.

It needs to be supplied continuously and in large quantities. It cannot stop for a moment, otherwise the refined food will be burned dry and lose its efficacy. All the hard work would be wasted.

A large amount of silver would be lost.

The One Union Manor had many water sources nearby. Within three miles, there were several mountain lakes, water veins, and streams.

These were all factors that “Madam Wen” had carefully considered before establishing the manor.

“Transporting water is a long process, and accidents can easily happen along the way, leading to a shortage of water supply and causing all efforts to be in vain.”

“Boiling refined food in an icy and snowy weather can greatly reduce water usage.”

“But it will increase the consumption of charcoal.”

“This is called increasing costs to improve efficiency. Conversely, if it were a hot summer day, boiling refined food would save on charcoal consumption but increase the demand for water. This is called reducing costs and reducing efficiency.”

“Both have their pros and cons. It depends on how you choose.”

Li Xian pondered the operating rules of the manor.

Perhaps in the future, he could manage a manor himself?

Although it was far away, it wouldn’t hurt to learn in advance.
