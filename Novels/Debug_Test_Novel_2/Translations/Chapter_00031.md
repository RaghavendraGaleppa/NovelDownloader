# Chapter 31: One Punch Kills a Late-Stage Ninth-Rank Demonic Beast, And You Call Yourself a Swordsman?

At the same time.

In the mountain forest.

"A Ninth-Rank early-stage demonic beast couldn't even scratch my skin."

Li Mo looked at his fist.

They say to strike a snake at its seven-inch weakness.

But he had just intentionally tried to test the limits of his physical body.

The result was that without even using qi-blood power, he had shattered the python with small wings in one punch.

It was strange.

Li Mo had never even killed a chicken before.

Yet, when he killed his first demonic beast, there was no tension or discomfort in his heart; his punch was calm and unwavering, as if he had countless similar experiences.

"Is this also a benefit of the Profound Womb Immortal Physique?"

Li Mo couldn't help but inwardly complain.

It seemed that besides practicing swordsmanship, he was incredibly quick to master everything else.

Shaking the blood off his fist.

"Moon-Gazing Abyss..."

Li Mo glanced at the map.

Then he drew his Azure Steel Sword and walked deeper into the forest.

In the vast dense forest, scattered shouts could be heard.

Occasionally, new disciples could be seen fighting demonic beasts.

Li Mo didn't stop.

He encountered several more early-stage Ninth-Rank demonic beasts along the way, but their fate was the same as the winged snake's.

All were instantly killed with a single sword strike; Li Mo didn't even use a sword technique.

Soon, he arrived at the area marked 'Stream Stone Forest' on the map.

Strange-shaped stone pillars stood tall, like withered trees without branches, with a river more than ten meters wide flowing through the middle.

"This river flows down from the Moon-Gazing Abyss."

"I just need to go upstream."

Li Mo pondered.

Footsteps approached from the front, and he looked up to see an inner sect deacon returning, dragging the carcass of a goat-like demonic beast covered in scales with black horns.

An old friend.

The Black-Horned Ram.

Although it often appeared on the dining tables of Autumn Water Pavilion, it was actually a late-stage Ninth-Rank demonic beast. Despite being herbivorous, it was exceptionally aggressive and immensely powerful.

Now, it had been cut down by a single sword.

"Ying Bing killed it?"

Li Mo immediately recognized the work.

A clean, decisive cut to the throat, and the wound was frozen, not a single drop of blood spilled.

The Black-Horned Ram probably didn't even know it was going to die before it died.

"Indeed, it is the work of True Disciple Ying."

The deacon nodded.

He stood in place, watching Li Mo, not moving his feet.

Li Mo was initially puzzled, then his brows relaxed.

He had sensed it too.

The next moment.

Suddenly, a massive dark shadow emerged from the water, leaping high.

It was a huge, bumpy-backed turtle!

A late-stage Ninth-Rank demonic beast, the Spined-back Turtle.

Turtle blood could be used in medicine, its meat was extremely delicious, and even its shell was a good material; the bathtubs in Autumn Water Pavilion were made from it...

Of course, as a late-stage Ninth-Rank demonic beast, the Spined-back Turtle was also extremely ferocious. In waters it inhabited, there were basically no other fish.

"Another late-stage Ninth-Rank demonic beast."

The inner sect deacon watched with interest.

These two true disciples had entered Clear Abyss Sect at the same time and both climbed a hundred steps on the Heaven-Ascending Staircase.

True Disciple Ying could instantly kill a Black-Horned Ram with one sword.

He wondered how True Disciple Li would fare against the Spined-back Turtle.

Of course, among late-stage Ninth-Rank demonic beasts, the Spined-back Turtle was definitely harder to kill. If it retracted all its limbs into its shell, a Qi-blood Realm martial artist could probably only stare helplessly.

Just as he was thinking this.

Li Mo across from him had already moved.

The Azure Steel Sword suddenly burst forth with dozens of sword lights, each imbued with restrained qi-blood power.

"Excellent swordsmanship!"

The inner sect deacon couldn't help but show a hint of admiration in his eyes.

Even among the Clear Abyss Sect's true disciples throughout history, this display of swordsmanship was stunning.

If he hadn't seen Ying Bing's swordsmanship, he might have been even more surprised.

Sensing danger.

The Spined-back Turtle opposite let out a low growl and immediately retracted its limbs.

The dozens of feather marks, formed by the Fire Crane Thousand Feathers technique, exploded on the turtle's shell, instantly covering it with tiny cracks.

Not only was the turtle shell damaged.

The Azure Steel Sword also chipped in several rice-grain-sized places.

Li Mo: "..."

This sword was a common weapon issued by the sect; logically, it should have been perfectly sufficient to kill a Ninth-Rank demonic beast.

But he had encountered a tough nut, an iron turtle.

If he had used a bit more force just now, he feared the sword would break before the turtle shell did.

"Roar..."

The Spined-back Turtle seemed to have chickened out, flipping over and fleeing back into the water.

"Don't run!"

Li Mo unhesitatingly gave chase.

You were so aggressive just now, and now you chip my weapon and try to leave?

"True Disciple Li!"

"That beast is cunning!"

Before the deacon's words had fully landed, Li Mo had already plunged into the water in pursuit.

Watching a string of bubbles rise, the deacon felt a surge of anxiety.

In the water, the Spined-back Turtle was more than ten times harder to deal with; even peak Ninth-Rank demonic beasts wouldn't dare to tangle with this creature underwater.

Li Mo's swordsmanship was good.

But in the water, he probably couldn't exert even half of his full power!

Just as he decided that if the situation turned sour, he would immediately go down to rescue Li Mo.

Gurgle—Boom!

The river surface suddenly erupted with muddy waves, and a huge figure was tossed into the air.

Li Mo's figure followed closely.

He descended like a meteor hitting the earth, flying down.

The Spined-back Turtle's pupils were filled with terror; it seemed to have smelled the scent of death at this moment.

But this time, it couldn't retreat back into the water, so it resorted to its old trick, retracting its limbs and head into its shell once more.

"!"

The inner sect deacon watched with wide-open mouth, utterly dumbfounded.

The Spined-back Turtle was thrown out of the water?

But that wasn't all.

The next moment, something even more horrifying happened.

Li Mo didn't use his sword this time; his entire body's muscles were tensed to their extreme.

The Six Harmonies Penetration of the perfected Six Harmonies Fist, combined with the Qi-blood power of the ten meridians, was pushed to its limit, also carrying the martial path killing intent from the Body-Slaughtering Weapon Art.

He threw a punch!

That fist landed on the turtle shell.

The turtle shell was like a fragile eggshell, forcibly dented and shattered.

The force even penetrated through the turtle shell, shaking the ground and creating widespread spiderweb-like cracks.

"I really..."

"Wanted to be a swordsman!"

Little Li clenched his fist, his heart filled with incomparable grief and indignation!

Hearing his roar.

The deacon's already stiff face twitched violently.

He looked over, and dark red blood slowly flowed out from the shattered turtle shell.

The Spined-back Turtle had clearly been killed by a single punch.

And it did not die peacefully.

Looking at Li Mo again, the sleeves of his clothes were completely ripped apart, his entire body steaming with hot vapor, and the muscles inadvertently exposed looked like they were forged from gold and iron.

You... a swordsman?

It's a good thing the Spined-back Turtle was smashed to death by you; if it were still alive, it would surely jump up and protest.

...

After about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

The carcasses of two demonic beasts were laid out at the base of the platform near the entrance.

One of them, everyone immediately recognized as a Black-Horned Ram, and it was certainly killed by Ying Bing.

But upon seeing the 'lump' of a thing behind it.

The elders, in their haste, couldn't identify what species it was.

"Is that a Spined-back Turtle?"

"To the elders, it was, in its previous life."

"This..."

The expressions of the elders were more spectacular than the last.

Ying Bing was astonishing; so far, she had faced all demonic beasts with precise, single-strike kills.

As if she knew exactly where their weaknesses lay.

Li Mo... they truly didn't know how to evaluate him.

"Nephew Shang Wu, you did teach him swordsmanship, right?" Xue Jing confirmed again.

"Why would I lie to you?"

Shang Wu sniffed her delicate nose.

The inner sect deacon also testified:

"True Disciple Li did use a sword, and his swordsmanship was extraordinary. It's just that the weapon's quality was too poor to break through the Spined-back Turtle's shell."

"When he punched the Spined-back Turtle to death, he was even shouting something about wanting to be a swordsman."

"..."

Doesn't that imply his fist was harder than the turtle shell?

The elders fell into silence once more.

After a long while, Elder Cold Crane slowly spoke:

"After the trial, have Li Mo go to the Divine Edge Cave to pick a weapon. Among the renowned weapons, swords are the most numerous, and we don't lack one for him. If he's truly not satisfied, he can pick two from my private collection."

"Hmph, you still need your permission."

Shang Wu raised her chin and said:

"Alright, whoever is in charge, tally the scores!"

The deacon standing in front of the scoreboard wiped his sweat and began writing and drawing on it.

Everyone glanced over.

On the scoreboard.

Li Mo and Ying Bing were almost crushing the competition, leaving everyone else far behind.

The gap between the two of them was very small.

Ying Bing led by a mere 5-point advantage.

As for the third place...

Wang Hu?
