**Chapter 57: Comprehending Sword Dao**

Sword Dao Peak.

In the secret chamber, Yang Ji examined himself.

[Name: Yang Ji]
[Root Bone: Low Grade]
[Lifespan: 28/200]
[Cultivation: Foundation Establishment Early Stage (1800/102400)]
[Cultivation Method: Ling Shui Art (Low Grade), True Adamant Divine Art (Dao Grade)]
[Great Divine Ability: Humanoid Weapon [Volume 1] (Mastered)]
[Great Divine Ability: Gui Zang Sword Art [Li Sword Dao] (Six Tenths Sword Intent)]
[Spells: Xun Shui Sword Art (Perfected), Lightness Art (Perfected)]

Previously, he enjoyed the treatment equivalent to a quasi Nascent Soul True Monarch, allowing him to consume Demon Essence Pills refined from Demon General level demon cores paired with 300-year-old demon companion herbs. Such pills provided him with 60 cultivation points per day.

Now, his treatment had been elevated by Supreme Bai Mei to the level of a Soul Transformation cultivator, granting him Demon Essence Pills refined from Demon Commander level demon cores paired with 400-year-old demon companion herbs. These pills provided 80 cultivation points per day. This meant that, as long as this supply of pills continued, he could reach the Foundation Establishment Mid Stage in about three years, certainly less than four. Such a cultivation speed was something he could never have imagined before.

If he were to cultivate by consuming Spirit Bloom Pills, he would only gain 5 cultivation points per day. With a lifespan of only two hundred years, it would be utterly impossible for him to break through from Foundation Establishment to Core Formation. On the path of cultivation, if one's root bone was poor and cultivation resources were lacking, it truly was a dead end. Fortunately, Yang Ji possessed a "golden finger," allowing him to carve out a path to survival amidst the mundane.

Although he currently possessed only low-grade root bones, the Demon Essence Pills he enjoyed made even most high-grade root bone disciples envious. One must understand, Demon Commander level demon beasts were powerful existences comparable to human Core Formation cultivators. How many could afford to consume Demon Essence Pills refined from such demon cores paired with demon companion herbs? In the entire Azure Mist Sect, only the Nascent Soul Old Ancestors and a dozen or so others, including Yang Ji, had access to them.

Daoist Yuan Jian had told him that even a quasi Void Refinement seed like Li Changxiao consumed pills of this specification. This was because Demon Kings were hard to find; it was extremely difficult to hunt one down and refine it into even faster-acting Demon Essence Pills. Generally, Supreme Bai Mei himself had to personally hunt them. But the vast ocean was boundless, and Demon Kings left no trace. If one chose to hide, even a Supreme might struggle to find them. This was why, when True Monarch Ling Gu and True Monarch Chi Huo encountered three Demon Kings during their venture into the underwater waterfall, they immediately harbored intentions to hunt them. Unfortunately, at the Demon King level, they could transform into demon qi, gathering and dispersing at will, making successful hunts incredibly difficult.

Since Demon King Cores were unavailable, the Demon Essence Pills providing Yang Ji the fastest cultivation speed in the entire Thousand Island Sea Region still only yielded about 80 cultivation points per day. Of course, this was based on his low-grade root bone's absorption rate. If it were a high-grade or even supreme-grade root bone, that rate would double or triple. For such geniuses, consuming the same pills as him could easily yield one or two hundred cultivation points a day. Otherwise, Li Changxiao, who was only a few years older than him, wouldn't have reached the peak of Core Formation at such a young age. That was the power of a true genius.

Nevertheless, Yang Ji was quite satisfied with his current cultivation speed. He immediately took out a Demon Essence Pill and consumed it. The surging spiritual energy of the pill dissolved, quickly drawn by the Circulatory Force within his meridians into his Dantian. Inside his Dantian, the spiritual energy vortex condensed by the True Adamant Divine Art was even sharper now, resembling a tornado formed by thousands of flying swords. As soon as the pill's spiritual energy was drawn in, it was rapidly refined by the vortex into pure True Adamant spiritual energy. Then, after several cycles of refinement and purification, it transformed into even purer liquid spiritual energy.

Yang Ji sensed it briefly; the speed at which the spiritual energy vortex refined on its own was already fast enough, no different from when he fully urged his cultivation method with his full concentration. Dao Grade cultivation methods were indeed powerful, with endless benefits. This discovery delighted him, as it meant he could dedicate more time to cultivating spells and arts. His choice of a Dao Grade cultivation method had truly been correct, essentially granting him extra time.

After consuming a pill, Yang Ji paid it no further mind, allowing the spiritual energy vortex to refine it on its own. With a flick of his hand, he produced a jade slip, which contained the Li Sword Dao. Previously, he had no proper sword dao scriptures; he had only comprehended the Li Sword Dao based on a trace of artistic conception hidden within a Sword Dao Projection. Now with a Sword Dao Scripture to study, he believed his cultivation speed would be even faster.

As his divine sense delved into it, the jade slip's world was chaotic and hazy. Just as he was about to investigate further, a deep voice echoed in his ears.

"The Gui Zang Sword is divided into the Innate Eight Swords: Qian, Kun, Xun, Kan, Li, Gen, Dui, and Zhen. According to the principles of Gui Zang, they mutually generate and evolve, transforming into all phenomena of heaven and earth. All things in the universe are contained within them."

"This is the Li Sword Dao. The Li Sword Dao embodies the Fire Aspect, utterly domineering and unhindered. Once unleashed, it is like a wildfire spreading across the plains, unstoppable."

Accompanied by the rumbling Daoist chant, characters resembling both fire and swords, emitting a domineering and sharp aura, rapidly approached from the hazy distance. They arranged themselves into a square formation, floating before Yang Ji's eyes. The surface of each character blazed with flames, appearing like miniature flying swords, radiating a potent Li Fire Sword Intent. Yang Ji knew that these few hundred characters were the essence of cultivating the Li Fire Sword Dao, requiring his careful perception and comprehension.

He quickly absorbed this sword dao scripture. Each character transformed into a sword dao rune, imprinting itself deep within his soul. As he delved deeper into comprehension and grasped the profound meanings, the sword dao characters within the jade slip transformed. Each character crashed into another, forming a massive flying sword that stood upright before him. The Fire Aspect Sword Intent emanating from this sword was more than a hundred times more potent than the sword intent contained within the Sword Dao Projection. The scripture, supplemented by this sword intent, made comprehension significantly easier.

Yang Ji immersed himself in comprehending the scripture and perceiving the sword intent. Ten days passed in a single session of comprehension. When he opened his eyes again, boundless white sword light bloomed from them. The translucent sword intent in his mind, which had previously been only at six parts, violently solidified. His sword intent surged, instantly reaching ten percent.

Feeling the elevation of his sword intent, Yang Ji merely flashed a satisfied smile. This result surprised him, yet it was also within his expectations. He had spent three years comprehending the Sword Dao Projection, truly accumulating deeply to erupt thinly. Now, with proper scriptures, his comprehension was unstoppable and incredibly swift.

With his Fire Aspect Sword Intent now at ten percent, he temporarily set it aside. With a flick of his hand, he took out another jade slip, which contained the Xun Sword Dao. As his divine sense entered it, a deep Daoist chant likewise resonated in his ears.

"The Xun Sword Dao. Xun means wind. Wind is the qi of heaven and earth, arising from the tip of a green duckweed, dancing beneath pines and cypresses. The Xun Sword Dao is ever-changing, the most versatile of the Gui Zang Swords. When gentle, it possesses the subtlety of fluttering flowers and caressing willows, but when it rages, it unleashes immense power capable of shattering stones, felling trees, splitting mountains, breaking heavens, and overwhelming all in its path."

Just like the Li Sword Dao, hundreds of sword dao characters flew in from the hazy distance. They appeared disordered, yet contained myriad rules, imparting a sense of extreme speed, ethereal grace, and fierce power. Truly, sometimes a gentle breeze, sometimes a raging hurricane. Erratic and hard to grasp, it was indeed the most variable sword dao among the Gui Zang Swords.
