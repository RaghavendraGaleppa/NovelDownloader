Chapter 314: Little Fan in Hand, the Contest is Won; Li Xian, the Little Thief, is a Turtle in a Jar

"Xiao Tuan," Wen Caishang said softly, "please guide City Lord He into the pavilion to take a seat. Wait a moment while I make myself presentable." She walked toward the bedroom, her sleeves fluttering, leaving only a trail of fragrant wind in her wake.

The pavilion was situated in a picturesque landscape, as warm as spring, with mist dispersing. On the second floor, a waterfall cascaded down, intertwined with vines and blooming flowers, all arranged with exquisite taste.

He Wentian wore a pleasant smile. Dressed in brocade, with a square face and an elegant, handsome demeanor, he surveyed the surrounding scenery and couldn't help but admire, "Lady Wang is truly a remarkable person! The layout of this pavilion is incredibly ingenious."

Xiao Tuan explained, "My Lady has always loved beauty. Since she is meeting Master Fu, she cannot afford to be careless, so she is spending some time on her appearance. I hope City Lord He will not mind."

City Lord He laughed, "The second greatest joy for a man in this world is waiting for a woman to get ready. This is my honor, how could I possibly mind?"

Xiao Tuan asked curiously, "If there is a second greatest joy, then there must be a first. City Lord He, what is the first greatest joy?" She was still young, her words naive and straightforward.

City Lord He couldn't help but laugh, "Naturally, it is when a woman dresses up especially for him."

Xiao Tuan said, "Then City Lord He, aren't you joyful every day? You have so many wives and concubines, all beautiful and dignified. Each one waits for your favor."

City Lord He said, "Hahaha, you could say so. For one so young, you know quite a lot." He sat in a stone pavilion by the waterfall. Xiao Tuan poured tea and replied with a grin, "Hehe, it's all from learning from my Lady."

City Lord He took a sip, raised his eyebrows, and casually asked, "Xiao Tuan, how long have you been following your Lady? Have you learned any skills?"

Xiao Tuan just smiled and remained silent. Anything related to her Lady, she wouldn't discuss. City Lord He took the hint and didn't press further. He sipped his tea, savoring the delicate fragrance. About an incense stick's time later, he suddenly smelled a wave of fragrance, and a voice came from behind him, "City Lord He, I have kept you waiting."

Wen Caishang was already behind him. City Lord He laughed, "Not long, not long," and stood up to greet her. He saw the Lady with her high bun and cascading hair, three silver hairpins askew, a light touch of makeup on her face. A simple bit of dressing up had already made her breathtakingly beautiful. She was cool yet enchanting, seductive yet ethereal. Her red lips were like blood, as gorgeous as a flower, yet it was all just right, never overshadowing the main purpose.

He trembled slightly, his heart skipping a beat, the back of his neck breaking out in goosebumps. Looking at her exquisite face, flawless temperament, and tasteful decorations, it was like a painting, a dream, yet he only felt a sense of dread. He hadn't even noticed when Wen Caishang had approached.

City Lord He thought to himself, "This woman's origins are mysterious, and her martial arts are unfathomably profound. In our few encounters, I had Duan Ni follow her orders and assist her with all her might. I did want to befriend her, but also secretly probe her background. To this day, I still haven't figured out her details. It's clear this woman is deep-minded and her actions are watertight. And now she wants to pay a visit to Master Fu. What on earth is she planning?"

Wen Caishang smiled, "City Lord He, please lead the way." City Lord He said, "Good, good, please follow me."

Two carriages traveled side by side down the road, stopping at the side gate of the Emerald Bamboo Residence. City Lord He got out and straightened his clothes. Wen Caishang lifted the carriage curtain, her eyes narrowing slightly. "This is the Emerald Bamboo Residence? It seems not far."

He Wentian said, "As the saying goes, 'Though it is a humble abode, its virtue is fragrant.' For a figure like Master Fu to live amidst the bustling markets of my Flying Dragon City, I feel incredibly honored just thinking about it. Sometimes, a single wall separates two different worlds. If you didn't step inside, who would know Master Fu lives here?"

Wen Caishang nodded. "Indeed." The two entered the residence. He Wentian was already familiar with the way, turning through several long corridors and heading straight in. The courtyard was filled with serene green bamboo, extremely elegant.

Wen Caishang was calm and graceful, walking with light steps. Her dress was made of fine material, called the "Lotus Swaying Skirt." As she walked, the hem swayed gently, hiding infinite beauty. He Wentian walked beside her, thinking to himself, "If this woman weren't so dangerous, she would be an exceptionally rare beauty. Though I have a house full of wives and concubines, none can compare to even a fraction of her."

He Wentian said, "Lady Wang, why do you have such an elegant interest today, wanting to pay a visit to Master Fu?" Wen Caishang said, "This young woman has long heard of Master Fu's reputation and holds him in high esteem. Hearing that he is here, how could I not come to pay my respects? However, this young woman is of little renown and shallow talent. Master Fu surely does not know of me. I will have to trouble City Lord He to make a proper introduction for me. This young woman thanks you in advance."

He Wentian's heart stirred, and he laughed, "Of course, of course."

Wen Caishang said, "Fu Haoran... Grand Historian of the Great Wu Dynasty, later demoted to the Qiong Tian Mansion. He is skilled in calligraphy, painting, poetry, music, history... all paths. He possesses seven strands of fortune. It can truly be said that his spirit is as vast as the heavens, reflecting through all ages."

He Wentian was shocked. "Lady Wang, just who are you? Your knowledge is truly..."

Wen Caishang smiled. "I am but a frail woman. What is my identity? It is not worth mentioning. City Lord He, Master Fu is right there. Please, you go in first."

They arrived at a circular archway. Inside, the grass was lush, with tables and cushions arranged. An old man and two young men sat inside. It was Fu Haoran, Li Xiaofan, and Zhou Shijie. Each was occupied with their own tasks.

Fu Haoran was painting with his brush, Li Xiaofan was reciting texts while shaking his head, and Zhou Shijie was memorizing classical texts. Originally... Zhou Shijie and Gu Nianjun had come to visit Fu Haoran and were temporarily staying in the residence. They studied on the spot, reading poetry and books.

Gu Nianjun had matters to attend to in the morning and had already left the courtyard. Zhou Shijie and Li Xiaofan were studying in the main hall, refining their knowledge. Each was lost in their own world, unaware that guests had arrived.

He Wentian straightened his clothes and stepped through the archway. Zhou Shijie immediately noticed and stood up to greet him with a cupped fist salute. Li Xiaofan came to his senses and stood up to follow suit. Fu Haoran was engrossed in his painting and paid no attention.

Zhou Shijie said, "City Lord He, you have come!"

He Wentian said, "Since we are in an academy, there is no distinction of rank. We are all students of Teacher Fu. Do not address me as City Lord. Just call me Wentian."

Zhou Shijie felt immensely proud. "Brother Wentian!" He Wentian said, "Where is Miss Nianjun? Why isn't she here today? Ah... look at my memory. She must have gone hunting."

Zhou Shijie said, "Oh? I didn't even know what Nianjun went to do so early in the morning. How did Brother Wentian know?"

He Wentian said, "She sought me out privately last night, directly stating she wanted to hunt a spiritual fox and asked for my help. A small matter like this, of course, I would help. I gave her a map of the mountains and told her all about the spiritual fox's habits. She must have already tried her hand."

Zhou Shijie said, "Why didn't you call me to help with such a thing?" He Wentian said with a meaningful smile, "Miss Nianjun is incredibly capable and has great pride in her heart. If you want to win her favor, you still need to improve yourself."

He Wentian said, "Xiaofan, what are you reading?" Li Xiaofan said, "I'm reading the 'Ming Xin Jing' (Scripture of the Bright Heart)." He Wentian said with a sense of shame, "Even I find it difficult to read the 'Ming Xin Jing' in its entirety. Though Xiaofan is young, his future is limitless."

Li Xiaofan smiled. "Brother Wentian is joking. I don't think about my future or anything so far-reaching."

He Wentian said, "Quite right. I came today to introduce you all to a person."

Li Xiaofan and Zhou Shijie both thought that although He Wentian had an easy-going personality, his status and position were by no means low. This person must be extraordinary, and they were extremely curious. He Wentian said, "Chao Huanglu... have you heard of her?"

Zhou Shijie said, "Of course I have."

He Wentian said, "That person is Lady Wang."

Zhou Shijie said joyfully, "Ah, has Lady Wang come? I've met her once before." He looked up and peered outside.

He Wentian laughed, "What a coincidence. You must treat Lady Wang with the utmost respect, not as casually as you treat me..."

A clear, indifferent voice came from outside the archway: "City Lord He, you make me sound so difficult to get along with. I have already met this talented young man before. Would I cause any trouble?"

Then, a skirt swayed, and a woman entered their sight. Zhou Shijie had seen "Lady Wang" before and remembered her voice and appearance. But upon hearing the voice, he felt it was subtly different, and he vaguely recalled a certain figure.

He looked up and was instantly dumbfounded, losing his composure completely. Seeing the Lady's graceful steps and swaying skirt and hair, he felt a sense of inferiority and dared not look directly. Wen Caishang approached and said, "Sorry to disturb you!"

Zhou Shijie was lost in a daze. Li Xiaofan cupped his fists and said, "No disturbance, no disturbance. But this Lady Wang seems a bit different from last time?"

Wen Caishang said softly, "Last time I did not wish to show myself, so I asked City Lord He's wife to appear on my behalf. This is my true self. Are you Li Xiaofan?"

Li Xiaofan nodded. "Yes. Good morning, Lady Wang!" Wen Caishang nodded. "You are a well-behaved child."

Zhou Shijie thought to himself: "So... so that Lady Wang and that Madam Wen are one and the same person. She... she is truly a rare and extraordinary woman, her style of doing things different from any other woman. I must be careful with my words. If I offend her, it will be bad." He cupped his fists and said, "Good morning, Lady Wang!"

Wen Caishang said, "Since we parted at the provincial city, Young Master Zhou has become even more handsome and extraordinary. It brings joy just to look at you."

Zhou Shijie's face immediately turned red, and he almost started dancing. He said casually, "Lady Wang, what about the young master by your side?" Wen Caishang said, "His aptitude is dull, so I sent him away. No need to mention him again."

Zhou Shijie's expression remained normal as he shook his head and sighed, as if in regret. But in his heart, he was overjoyed, feeling as if the world had suddenly brightened. Wen Caishang, without a trace, glanced at Li Xiaofan. Then she looked towards Fu Haoran.

He Wentian said, "Master Fu is lost in his painting. Let's go take a look, but we must not disturb him."

The group approached Fu Haoran and observed his painting. Fu Haoran's brushwork, with its varying speed and pressure, was truly that of a master. The tip of the brush outlined the form of bamboo, sometimes visible, sometimes hidden. His painting skill was truly world-class.

He possessed fortune. As he painted with full concentration, the world seemed to resonate with him. When he painted the bamboo leaves, it was as if a real wind blew through them, making a rustling sound. When he painted the bamboo stalk, it stood tall and straight, as if it had the momentum to pierce the sky.

It was truly magnificent. Though he was only painting bamboo, it seemed as if he was painting all the myriad things of the world. Everyone was captivated. Unconsciously, it was midday. The snow had stopped, and the noon sun slanted down, shining directly on the painting.

The subtle charm within it was difficult to describe. Fu Haoran tossed his brush aside, picked up the painting to examine it, and was very satisfied. He laughed heartily, "Hahaha, I haven't painted such a work in a long time. Alas, what a pity, what a pity."

He Wentian said, "Congratulations, Teacher Fu, on creating a masterpiece that will be passed down through the ages!"

Zhou Shijie quickly echoed the sentiment. Fu Haoran was startled by the voice, then came to his senses and laughed, "City Lord He, you're here. And this is..." He looked at Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang smiled. "I am Wang Yiyi. I have long admired Master Fu's name and have come especially to pay my respects."

Fu Haoran said, "Forgive my rudeness, forgive my rudeness. I vaguely heard mention of Lady Wang earlier. You must be that Lady Wang. It is truly better to see you in person than to hear of you. Your grace is exceptional, rare in both ancient and modern times. Your actions of moving wood to establish trust, and praying at the temple fair... I have heard of these matters. You are a woman of great skill..." He stroked his beard and smiled.

The second half of his sentence went unsaid: You have come to seek me out for a purpose.

Wen Caishang smiled. "You flatter me, Master Fu. The world is growing chaotic. As a frail woman, if I had no skills, how could I stand my ground? My visit today is purely out of admiration. I have no other intentions. Please do not think too much of it, Master Fu."

Fu Haoran said, "We are strangers who meet by chance. What thoughts could I have?"

Li Xiaofan and Zhou Shijie both thought: Teacher Fu doesn't seem to like Lady Wang very much.

Fu Haoran said, "This painting is fresh off the easel, hahaha. Come, take a look."

Li Xiaofan, Zhou Shijie, He Wentian, and Wen Caishang all examined it. After a while, Fu Haoran asked, "What do you see? Xiaofan, Shijie, you speak first."

Zhou Shijie said, "There is snow in the painting, and bamboo. The wind and snow howl, but the bamboo does not fall. Teacher Fu's pride is unyielding!" Fu Haoran said, "Superficial. You are just trying to please me."

Li Xiaofan scratched his head and said, "Teacher, I have the same opinion as Brother Zhou."

Fu Haoran said, "Not bad. If you don't understand, you don't understand. That is how one should be in their studies. This painting is not something you can comprehend yet. City Lord He... what about you? If you can see something in it, I will give you the painting. That would be no problem."

He Wentian said joyfully, "Please allow me to examine it carefully." He took the painting, looked it over repeatedly, and pondered. He said, "I recall that Teacher once wrote a poem praising the bamboo, extolling its nobility. What Shijie said earlier has some truth to it, but it is not entirely correct. The bamboo stalk in this painting is emerald green, exuding a rare, vigorous power. Though the wind and snow howl, they are not aggressive."

"I see that Teacher's meaning is one of resilience, a desire to face difficulties and forge ahead through the wind and snow. You see the wind and snow as a whetstone, which makes the bamboo stalk even more emerald and resilient. You are also joyful and proud to have found a successor to carry on your legacy."

"I wonder if my words are correct?"

Fu Haoran smiled without speaking and rolled up the painting. Wen Caishang smiled. "Why don't you let this young woman take a look?"

Fu Haoran said, "Oh? Lady Wang also knows how to appreciate paintings?"

Wen Caishang smiled. "I have a slight understanding, I would not dare claim to be an expert." Fu Haoran handed over the painting. Wen Caishang smiled after looking at it.

Fu Haoran said, "What are you smiling at?" Wen Caishang said, "I am smiling because though this painting is good, it is destined to have no one who can appreciate its true worth."

Fu Haoran let out a soft sigh. Wen Caishang held the painting, her steps light and graceful, bringing with her a wave of fragrance. She laughed, "Master Fu, are you mourning someone?"

Fu Haoran was startled, his eyes flashing. He stepped forward and asked solemnly, "What do you mean by this?"

Madam Wen held the painting, walking slowly, her gaze sweeping over it. The rhythm was now in her hands. Fu Haoran, He Wentian, Li Xiaofan, and Zhou Shijie were all curious and followed behind her, waiting for her explanation.

Wen Caishang said, "The person you are mourning is quite a taboo subject. You dare not speak of them openly."

Fu Haoran shuddered and looked at Wen Caishang seriously. "Lady Wang is indeed extraordinary. Please, elaborate." Wen Caishang said, "Earlier, Master Fu said that if someone could see the hidden meaning in this painting, you would give it to them. Does that still stand?"

Though Fu Haoran felt reluctant, he thought that if it were to fall into the hands of someone who truly understood it, it would not be a disgrace. So he said, "It does."

Wen Caishang said, "I will not take what you cherish. There is no need to give me the painting." Fu Haoran knew that behind these words, there must be another condition. It was his first time witnessing this woman's methods, and he was startled to find that he had already lost the initiative, but it was not easy for him to break free.

Wen Caishang's posture was elegant as she spoke slowly and deliberately: "Though this is a painting of bamboo, its meaning is not in the bamboo. It is not difficult to see this point. But the world says that Master Fu loves bamboo. When they see him paint bamboo, how could they think of anything else? This is Master Fu's deliberate ploy to mislead."

"If someone were to appreciate the painting according to his stated preferences, they would only see a few bamboo stalks for the rest of their lives."

Li Xiaofan asked, "Teacher, is that so?" Fu Haoran nodded. He Wentian felt incredibly ashamed, a cold sweat breaking out on his back. Zhou Shijie touched his nose awkwardly.

Wen Caishang said, "With City Lord He's strategy, you should have been able to see the clue. But your knowledge in this area is slightly insufficient. The brushwork in this painting is strong and bold. On the top of this bamboo stalk, there is a leaf whose lower edge is thick and upper edge is thin. This is the painting method of the Great Yu Dynasty's Painting Sage, Ji Yuan."

"It has been a long time. Ji Yuan's paintings have been copied by later generations. If someone imitates him, it is nothing special. But the other bamboo leaves are not painted this way. I imagine that when Master Fu was painting, you held a sliver of hope that someone would see the true meaning of the painting. You deliberately gave a hint."

Zhou Shijie said, "Ah. Is Teacher Fu mourning Ji Yuan?"

Wen Caishang said, "I think not. If you were mourning Ji Yuan, why would you hide your talent and not show it? The details here, deliberately using Ji Yuan's method, actually point to something else... The person you are mourning is from the Great Yu Dynasty."

Fu Haoran said with admiration, "Lady Wang's talent is outstanding. I, Fu, am in awe."

Wen Caishang said, "If I am not mistaken, this bamboo is called 'Sword Bamboo.' Its growth has the meaning of piercing the sky. It grows in the Northern Heaven Domain and is a rare type of bamboo that fears both cold and frost. The so-called 'unafraid of wind and snow'... is the exact opposite of this bamboo. Once this bamboo grows, it can reach for the sky within a year, but it withers and decays rapidly upon encountering wind and snow."

"The emerald bamboo in the painting, though it stands firm, is actually on the verge of death. It will decay in an instant."

"Combined with Master Fu's noble character. The one you are mourning should be 'Zhong Lianshan.' The prime minister who died for his country in the Great Yu Dynasty. This man died in the snow."

"How similar he is to this bamboo. As the saying goes, heroes emerge in troubled times. This Zhong Lianshan was known for his lust and had many wicked deeds that were criticized. But in order to save the collapsing Great Yu Dynasty, he exhausted all his energy. Even dying for his country in the end, he was still a hero."

"Master Fu wants to say... that only in such troubled times can a figure like Zhong Lianshan, who died for his country, be nurtured. And such figures often die because of it. You think that when the Great Wu is about to fall, if it is to be completely overturned, Master Fu's choice will be the same as his."

"That is why you suddenly felt the need to mourn. However, Zhong Lianshan was the prime minister of a previous dynasty. Though Master Fu has been demoted, you were once a Grand Historian. To mourn a prime minister of a previous dynasty, how could that be justified? So you were extremely obscure."

Fu Haoran said with admiration, "He who knows me... is Lady Wang!"

It turned out that...

Fu Haoran had traveled the world with Li Xiaofan, learning more and more about the lives of the people. He saw the suffering everywhere, with many people's clothes not even covering their bodies. With the separatist forces of the martial clans, he felt even more that the Great Wu was on the verge of collapse.

Officials everywhere aided the tyrants, and natural and man-made disasters were rampant. His heart was filled with darkness. He had tried several times to find a way to turn the situation around, but felt powerless to do so. The trend was already set. He usually kept this matter buried deep in his heart and never spoke of it to anyone.

That day, he settled in the Emerald Bamboo Residence.

With his usual leisure, distracting thoughts grew strong. By chance, while watching the snow outside the window, he suddenly thought of the past events of the Great Yu Dynasty. His heart was filled with complex emotions. In the blink of an eye, the Great Wu had walked into a similar situation as the Great Yu.

He also thought... at that time, the Great Yu Dynasty's Zhong Lianshan, though he had many flaws, his intention to save the country was genuine. Now, the treacherous ministers of the Great Wu Dynasty are even worse than those of the past. He couldn't help but feel a sense of mourning.

He felt a deep connection to Zhong Lianshan's fate.

As time passed, his desire to mourn grew stronger, and his mood became extremely complicated. With nowhere to release it, he wanted to paint to relieve his boredom, hiding all his emotions in the painting. Thus, the "Sword Bamboo Facing Snow" was born.

When the painting was finished, he laughed heartily, feeling very satisfied. Later, he repeatedly said "what a pity" and "what a pity," believing that the true meaning of the painting would be seen by no one.

It was exactly as Wen Caishang had said.

He Wentian clapped his hands in amazement, admiring her completely. This appreciation of the painting, unraveling it layer by layer, was not just a matter of a quick mind. It also required a rich knowledge as a foundation. It required proficiency in historical theories, painting schools, botanical knowledge, and psychological analysis...

He Wentian admitted he couldn't even come close. Fu Haoran said, "Lady Wang's knowledge is in no way inferior to mine."

Wen Caishang smiled. "It is far from it. My humble opinion, I hope it does not make a fool of myself." Fu Haoran said, "Lady Wang is too modest. With your erudition and talent, how many people in the world could match such an achievement?"

Wen Caishang said, "I loved reading as a child and did accumulate some knowledge. But I believe knowledge is not just 'accumulation.' I am somewhat capable in martial arts, but in the field of knowledge, I would not dare to be arrogant."

Fu Haoran said, "Lady Wang, please come inside and sit. I have many private collections of paintings. I invite you to appreciate them."

Wen Caishang smiled. "Good." For about half a day, they were all occupied with appreciating the paintings. He Wentian was feasting his eyes and was overjoyed.

When the painting appreciation was over, Wen Caishang asked, "By the way, Master Fu's beloved disciple looks quite handsome. May I ask where he is from?"

Zhou Shijie, not knowing the relationship between "Li Xian" and "Li Xiaofan," didn't think much of it. Fu Haoran said, "My little disciple is from Qiong Tian Mansion."

Wen Caishang said, "I see his temperament is extraordinary. Could he be from a great clan?" Zhou Shijie quickly said, "Little Fan is quite remarkable. Though he is not from a great clan, he passed the winter examination and won a place in Teacher Fu's tutelage on his own."

He was feigning praise, but was actually pointing out Li Xiaofan's humble origins. Li Xiaofan remained calm and composed.

Wen Caishang feigned surprise. "That is not easy." She scrutinized Li Xiaofan and thought to herself: "This boy does have a bit of his brother's demeanor. This calmness is truly disorienting."

They had now walked to a stone pavilion. Wen Caishang patted her dress, sat down gracefully, and waved to Li Xiaofan. "Little Fan, come here and let me have a good look at you."

Fu Haoran said, "Lady Wang, you..." Wen Caishang said, "Master Fu is allowed to mourn old friends, but this young woman is not?"

Fu Haoran asked curiously, "Lady Wang is..." Wen Caishang said, "This child, Little Fan, looks very much like my late husband. Let me look at him up close."

Li Xiaofan walked over obediently. Wen Caishang looked him up and down, thinking to herself: "His eyebrows are a bit similar. He must be that little thief's younger brother. This boy is fair and handsome, but far from being comparable to Master Li. Everything matches up. Good... with this boy in hand, even if he has a thousand tricks and is as cunning as a fox, he is already a turtle in my jar. I originally wanted to compete with him a bit more, but with this, I have already won a great victory."

She raised the corners of her mouth and waved her hand. "Go on."

Li Xiaofan retreated behind Fu Haoran. Wen Caishang said, "Master Fu, how long do you intend to stay here?"

Fu Haoran said, "I plan to leave soon." He Wentian's eyes welled with tears. "Teacher, your student still wishes to learn from you. Please, you must stay!"

Fu Haoran said, "Xiaofan and I still need to travel for our studies. This matter is..."

Wen Caishang said, "Master Fu, I have been reading since I was young and have a belly full of questions that no one has been able to answer. By chance, I have met a figure like you and I am truly unwilling to miss this opportunity. Please stay a few more days and allow me to seek your guidance."

"This..." Fu Haoran said, "Very well!"

Wen Caishang smiled and bowed. "That is settled then. I will take my leave for today. Starting tomorrow, I will come every day to seek your guidance." She cast an imperceptible glance at Li Xiaofan and turned to leave.
