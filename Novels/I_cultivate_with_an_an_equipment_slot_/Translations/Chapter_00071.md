# Chapter 71: Breakthrough in Cultivation, Cultivating Third-Grade Spiritual Plants  

"Mid-stage Qi Refinement!  

And with four perfected spells?  

Are you trying to fool me?" Upon hearing Zhuge Wan's words, Lei Kunhai's expression shifted as he searched for a rebuttal. But upon reflection, four perfected spells were an undeniable fact, leaving him no choice but to question their validity.  

Not just Lei Kunhai, but everyone else also stared eagerly at Zhuge Wan and Mo Changqing. The selection of a true disciple didn't directly concern them.  

However!  

If this true disciple candidate truly had four perfected spells, his future would be boundless. He might even lead them to expand their territory in the future.  

Thus, it was essential to establish connections early.  

"Elder Lei, do you think I would fabricate such an absurd lie?" Zhuge Wan's expression darkened as she countered.  

"This..."  

Lei Kunhai's words caught in his throat. Indeed, four perfected spells were an outrageous claim, but any rational person wouldn't dare to falsify such a thing.  

Spell mastery was fair to all.  

It didn't vary based on one's cultivation level, nor could external forces influence it.  

If you were at the minor achievement stage, that was your level.  

If you were at the major achievement stage, that was your level.  

Unlike cultivation, where consuming more pills could rapidly boost one's progress.  

Spell cultivation depended on comprehension—like solving math problems. You either knew it or you didn't!  

There was no faking it!  

So, if he were in Zhuge Wan's position, he wouldn't dare to fabricate such a claim.  

"But...  

But my grandson is also a blacksmith!" Lei Kunhai continued his futile struggle.  

"My disciple is also a spiritual planter, and he won first place in the Floral Palace's Spiritual Planting Competition," Zhuge Wan retorted without backing down.  

Though spiritual planters weren't as prestigious as blacksmiths,  

winning first place in the competition still carried weight.  

Moreover, everyone knew Lei Kunhai's grandson, Lei Wanbao, was only capable of forging high-grade magical artifacts.  

He was still far from crafting top-grade artifacts, let alone spiritual tools.  

On the other hand, though Zhang Yan was merely a spiritual planter, he could already cultivate second-grade spiritual plants and was even attempting third-grade ones.  

This was not something an ordinary first-grade blacksmith could compare to.  

"But..."  

"I..."  

Lei Kunhai opened his mouth, wanting to argue further, but in the end, he found himself speechless.  

There was simply no way he could advocate for his grandson!  

---  

"Sect Master, regarding the true disciple selection, I believe we should verify this matter ourselves." Just as Lei Kunhai racked his brain for a solution, another Golden Core cultivator spoke up.  

"That's only natural." Mo Changqing nodded lightly. He believed that once these people witnessed Zhang Yan's talent, they would undoubtedly agree to his promotion as a true disciple.  

"Indeed, the true disciple must still undergo an assessment. Moreover, even if we approve, we must also publicize Zhang Yan's achievements." Another Golden Core cultivator chimed in.  

He wasn't targeting Zhang Yan.  

Rather, true disciples were different from inner and outer disciples—they had to be selected fairly and justly, earning the respect of all disciples.  

Why hadn't Lei Kunhai's grandson become a true disciple yet?  

Because if he were promoted, other disciples wouldn't accept it.  

Currently, Zhang Yan had little reputation within the sect. Everyone only knew he was Zhuge Wan's inner disciple, but his actual abilities remained unclear.  

Why should he become a true disciple?  

This needed to be demonstrated to maintain sect unity.  

"Normally, to become a true disciple, one must hunt ten demonic beasts of the same level and three of a higher level.  

But I recall Zhang Yan isn't skilled in combat, right?  

He's a spiritual planter?  

Then forget hunting demonic beasts—have him cultivate spiritual plants instead." The Qingheng Sect's approach to nurturing true disciples was flexible.  

Not everyone needed to excel in combat.  

Take Zhang Yan, for example—he was clearly a production-oriented talent. Sending someone like him to the battlefield would be madness!  

Moreover, for a sect, production-oriented talents were the most valuable, as they could continuously generate resources.  

As for fighters?  

With ample resources, finding fighters was never a problem.  

"Fine. If he can cultivate ten first-grade high-quality spiritual plants and one second-grade spiritual plant, then the true disciple position is his." After some thought, Lei Kunhai reluctantly conceded.  

"By the way, I'd like to meet this Zhang Yan." Lei Kunhai suddenly added.  

"Of course. However, Zhang Yan is currently in seclusion. Once he emerges, I'll have him pay you a visit."  

Zhuge Wan smiled faintly at Lei Kunhai.  

"Good!"  

With that, the meeting concluded. Lei Kunhai stormed out of the sect hall with a darkened expression, returning to Thousand Treasures Peak.  

As soon as he arrived, he saw a burly young man who bore a striking resemblance to him—about seventy percent similar—approaching.  

What stood out most was the young man's body, adorned with magical artifacts from head to toe—his robes, necklace, waist jade, and even the ribbon in his hair were all enchanted items.  

Most eye-catching were his hands.  

They shimmered with a dazzling array of colors.  

He wore ten rings—each one a magical artifact.  

Truly, he lived up to his name, Lei Wanbao (Thunder Myriad Treasures).  

"Greetings, Grandfather! Grandfather, how did it go?" Lei Wanbao eagerly asked as soon as he saw Lei Kunhai return.  

"Grandfather?  

Who's your grandfather? I don't have such a useless grandson!" Lei Kunhai exploded at the sight of Lei Wanbao. How could he have such a worthless descendant?  

Unable to even master two spells for Foundation Establishment!  

After teaching him blacksmithing for so long, he could only forge high-grade magical artifacts—utterly pathetic!  

Lei Wanbao was dumbfounded by his grandfather's outburst. What had happened?  

Before leaving, his grandfather had confidently promised to secure him a true disciple position.  

Why had he returned in such a rage, calling him worthless?  

His grandfather had never been like this before!  

Previously, his grandfather had called him a heaven-sent treasure!  

Though inwardly baffled, Lei Wanbao wasn't foolish. He immediately turned and fled—Old Lei's fists were notoriously painful!  

---  

**Wood Spirit Peak.**  

Inside Zhang Yan's cave abode.  

After consuming the Clear Heart Lotus, Zhang Yan suddenly opened his eyes. The effects of the lotus were beyond his expectations—far superior to his previous spiritual tea.  

With just one lotus seed, his spiritual sense had increased by at least thirty percent.  

More importantly, his thoughts had become clearer, and his previous anxieties had vanished.  

"Is this the effect of dispelling inner demons?" Zhang Yan marveled. The potency of this third-grade spiritual item was undeniable.  

"Now it's time to focus on breaking through to late-stage Qi Refinement." Seizing the clarity of mind, Zhang Yan swallowed a pill and began cultivating.  

The Evergreen Art he practiced was a wood-attribute technique, known for its gentle and stable nature, eliminating concerns about qi deviation.  

All he needed to do was refine and purify his spiritual energy.  

Additionally, his Pure Yang童子功 (Pure Yang Virgin Technique) had also progressed.  

The technique had three stages, each granting three strands of pure yang energy. Nine strands could form a pure yang true essence, increasing the success rate of Foundation Establishment.  

Previously, Zhang Yan had only condensed three strands.  

But now, he had reached seven—the third stage of the technique—and was close to forming the pure yang true essence.  

"I wonder if I can continue condensing pure yang energy after forming the true essence." Zhang Yan mused curiously.  

Normally, once a cultivator formed the pure yang true essence, they would focus on Foundation Establishment.  

But...  

Zhang Yan's comprehension was far superior to ordinary cultivators, further enhanced by the six Enlightenment Cushions.  

Thus, his progress was naturally faster.  

"What if I condensed nine pure yang true essences? Would Foundation Establishment go even smoother?" Zhang Yan pondered. Others might not have the means, but he did!  

As the saying went: "When poor, make do with simple tools; when rich, drown the enemy in firepower."  

Zhang Yan also suffered from a fear of insufficient firepower—whether in spell cultivation or Foundation Establishment aids, he wanted everything covered. Sometimes once wasn't enough; he needed redundancy.  

But this wasn't urgent. His current priority was breaking through to late-stage Qi Refinement.  

---  

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.  

During this time, Zhang Yan remained in seclusion, while the outside world—especially the Zhou Kingdom—was in turmoil.  

News had spread that the major sects had discovered a secret realm—an ancient assessment realm of the Taiyi Sect. Everyone wanted a piece of the pie.  

Crowds gathered outside the realm, eager to enter, only to find it divided into inner and outer layers.  

The outer layer was a resource-rich realm.  

Some rogue cultivators ventured in, hoping for fortune, only to be slaughtered by the major sects. These realms were the sects' lifelines—off-limits to outsiders.  

Rogue cultivators?  

Dreaming of entering a secret realm?  

Not a chance!  

The major sects dispatched Golden Core cultivators to sweep the outer realm, reaping bountiful rewards.  

Once the outer resources were exhausted, they would turn to the inner realm.  

Overall, the entire Zhou Kingdom was abuzz due to this discovery.  

"Finally, late-stage Qi Refinement." On this day, Zhang Yan pushed open the stone door of his seclusion. He had finally reached late-stage Qi Refinement.  

However, he was still some distance from Qi Refinement perfection.  

But he wasn't in a hurry—cultivation couldn't be rushed.  

"Young Master!" Seeing Zhang Yan emerge, Liu Yiting hurriedly prepared hot water for him to bathe, burn incense, and change clothes.  

"Has anything happened during this time?"  

After changing, Zhang Yan asked Liu Yiting.  

"Young Master, there are rumors in the sect that you're to become a true disciple. Is it true?" Liu Yiting asked admiringly as she adjusted his collar.  

"True disciple?  

I don't know yet, but it's possible." Zhang Yan pondered. The rumor might have been spread by his master.  

"Also, the Grandmaster sent word for you to visit."  

"Master is summoning me?  

Understood."  

Leaving his cave, Zhang Yan headed straight for Wood Spirit Peak to see Zhuge Wan.  

"Master!"  

"Good, late-stage Qi Refinement. But your cultivation is still too low—you must aim for Foundation Establishment soon." Zhuge Wan glanced at Zhang Yan, immediately discerning his level.  

"Yes, Master. I'll work hard."  

Zhang Yan nodded earnestly.  

"Good. I called you here to discuss the true disciple matter."  

"The sect requires you to cultivate ten first-grade high-quality spiritual plants and one second-grade spiritual plant as your assessment task.  

Additionally, you must visit the elders to demonstrate your talents."  

"Yes, Master."  

Zhang Yan was surprised that the task involved cultivation rather than combat, but upon reflection, it suited him perfectly.  

This way, he wouldn't have to fight.  

And leaving the sect was genuinely dangerous!  

As for showcasing his talents to the Golden Core elders, that was only natural.  

He needed to make a strong impression—otherwise, his position as a true disciple wouldn't be secure!  

Returning from Wood Spirit Peak,  

Zhang Yan didn't immediately visit the Golden Core elders.  

Instead, he focused on the spiritual plant cultivation task.  

For others, this might be challenging, but for Zhang Yan, it was trivial.  

Especially with Zhuge Wan's spiritual planting set,  

Old Weng's spiritual hoe,  

and the Floral Palace's Transplanting Art.  

Ten first-grade high-quality spiritual plants?  

He could even cultivate ten second-grade plants if needed.  

The Transplanting Art excelled in mass production—making difficult-to-cultivate plants thrive and yield abundantly.  

Though it was a Floral Palace secret technique, he wasn't worried about sect elders reporting him.  

And...  

"Ah, the Clear Heart Lotus." Zhang Yan recalled the lotus he'd planted before seclusion. During his absence, Liu Yiting had arranged for others to water it.  

Approaching the pond, he saw the jade-like seed had sprouted tender roots and tiny leaves.  

"It germinated?" Delighted, Zhang Yan knew this was just the beginning.  

The real challenge was nurturing the lotus to maturity—any misstep could kill it.  

But Zhang Yan wasn't worried. With his vast knowledge, he could easily cultivate the lotus.  

"Using this third-grade Clear Heart Lotus to fulfill the second-grade task should suffice, right?"  

As for the first-grade high-quality plants, Zhang Yan planned to skip them entirely and focus on second-grade spiritual fruit trees.  

This was a massive undertaking, so he enlisted Mu Sen's help.  

"Junior Brother."  

Mu Sen was usually stoic, but Zhang Yan never failed to astonish him.  

This time, assisting Zhang Yan, he once again widened his eyes in disbelief.  

Surveying Zhang Yan's spiritual garden, he finally uttered, "Junior Brother, did you rob the Sect Master's garden?"
