# Former Acquaintances Gather Again

Qin Ming had been running "Blending with Light and Dust," making his body's aura almost indistinguishable from an ordinary person, yet his gaze was still noticed by the other party, showing how powerful their perception was.

As night deepened, the volcanic spring glowed exceptionally brightly.

A gentle breeze stirred, lifting Cui Chonghe's glowing hair. He was as radiant as jade, with faint motes of light flowing around him, as if standing in the immortal path, severing all worldly ties.

Qin Ming stood on the dim slope, nodding slightly in that direction.

By the volcanic spring, beneath the black and white twin trees, Cui Chonghe's feathered robe fluttered, trailing wisps of white mist. His face was carved like flawless jade, warm and delicate, his eyes deep. He nodded back towards the slope.

Qin Ming realized that Cui Chonghe did not recognize him.

He could understand this, as he had researched Cui Chonghe somewhat. This person had a noble and distinguished identity, highly regarded by an elder renowned throughout the Night Mist world since childhood. He was born with early wisdom, possessing unparalleled talent. Every wish he had made along his journey had come true, making him incredibly confident.

How could such a person pay attention to a fake Cui Chonghe?

The last time Qin Ming recovered his memories, he had already realized, while reviewing his past, that this person had completely ignored him.

Cui Chonghe had only lost his temper once, blaming his family for not paying attention to their influence, believing the fake Cui Chonghe had overstepped his bounds and would easily become a laughingstock.

Meng Xinghai had once reminded Qin Ming of Cui Chonghe’s true feelings towards him.

Putting himself in the shoes of Cui Chonghe, a direct descendant of a millennium-old aristocratic family, Qin Ming was merely a servant who could be used as a stand-in, a retainer raised by the Cui family to be expended at any time.

At that time, Qin Ming had been furious.

Today, however, his heart was at peace.

On the slope, Qin Ming even faintly smiled. This was good; for them to meet and not recognize each other saved unnecessary trouble. If the other party knew who he was, there might even be some commotion.

Cui Chonghe returned a smile, his entire being glowing, ethereal and brilliant. Then he turned his gaze to the black and white twin trees and said, "It's a pity, without the experience of crossing the Heavenly Light Life-and-Death Tribulation, such young relic species are useless."

Qin Ming turned, leaped onto the red eagle's back, and as it spread its wings, it instantly scattered the night mist and flew into the distance.

Yu Que stood on his shoulder, still trembling with fear. "That young man is terrifying. His gaze just swept over me, and it felt like I was sent back from the current early spring season to the deepest winter when all things wither and blizzards rage most fiercely."

"You felt that?" Qin Ming was surprised; he hadn't experienced it.

Yu Que nodded, still lingering with fear. "Yes, it might be because I quietly used my newly formed divine perception to peek, and suffered a backlash."

Qin Ming realized that Cui Chonghe was even more formidable than he had imagined, with exceptionally high cultivation in consciousness.

"My mind stirred, and I suddenly felt something, as if connected to someone or something." Beneath the black and white twin trees, Cui Chonghe, enveloped in white mist and motes of light, suddenly spoke.

He was accompanied by nearly ten people: young disciples from the Outer Realm, Golden Armored Guards, Jade Armored Guards, and unfathomable master-level experts from his sect.

These people immediately scanned the surroundings vigilantly, then looked towards the nearby village.

"That young man rode off on a red eagle, could it be related to him?" someone asked.

An Outer Realm disciple said, "Judging from him carrying a dark gold hammer, his strength is only a little over four thousand catties. While excellent in the eyes of ordinary people, he doesn't even qualify to be a Golden Armored Guard."

"To be safe, should we investigate thoroughly?"

Cui Chonghe was highly valued both in his millennium-old aristocratic family and in the Outer Realm.

...

Qin Ming stood in the wilderness, waiting for news. Once the experts from Crimson Cloud City arrived, he planned to leave; it was not advisable to stay here long.

As the early night faded, the mountains slowly became swallowed by darkness. Various wild beasts roared ceaselessly, and the cries of strange birds echoed through the forest.

"Mountain Lord Qin, the experts from Crimson Cloud City have arrived and wish to hear the details from you," Yu Que flew back from Silver Vine Town.

Qin Ming nodded, letting out a sigh of relief. Nothing should go wrong now. He didn't want the leader of the Golden Bandits to pass through here, otherwise, his subordinates might stir up a bloody storm in this remote area.

He vaguely suspected that the Golden Bandits had endured for so many years perhaps because they were a money-making tool for a certain super organization.

But unfortunately, he had killed several Golden Bandits in one day and found no valuable items. Could it be that everything was entrusted to their leader?

Outside Silver Vine Town, Qin Ming met two top experts.

Ling Xu, the former City Lord of Crimson Cloud City, was dressed in white, appearing to be in his early forties, with a handsome and very scholarly demeanor.

He smiled faintly. "So you're Little Qin? Good lad."

Seeing his smile, Qin Ming's heart immediately skipped a beat.

He knew well that this former City Lord had superb methods. It was said that he once colluded with high-level异类 (supernatural beings) in the mountains to stage a performance, luring hidden observers to rush en masse towards a special node where five-colored auspicious light shone, only for the latter to be tricked into an unspeakable predicament.

Although some were enraged afterwards and shook his position as City Lord, he merely moved to another, larger city to serve as City Lord there.

"Greetings, Senior Ling," Qin Ming saluted.

City Lord Ling's smile was gentle. "Meng Xinghai and I are good friends. You're his nephew, so there's no need to be so formal with me."

"We have a certain obsession with the Golden Bandits and want to eliminate them ourselves. We rushed here immediately upon receiving the news." From the forest, a three-foot-tall tabby cat walked over with elegant feline steps, carrying a crimson sword on its back, its scabbard nearly dragging on the ground.

Qin Ming also saluted this grand expert and quickly informed both of them of the information Yu Que's bird-brothers had gathered from various major towns.

Ling Xu frowned. "All signs indicate they really intend to break out from Black-White Mountain. It seems the large nets laid elsewhere are just for show?"

"Brother Ling, it's been a long time since we last met. I didn't expect to see you here again," someone called out with a hearty laugh from afar.

A group of people emerged from the thick night, approaching Silver Vine Town.

"Brother Zhao, why are you not cultivating in seclusion in the Outer World but have come to a remote place like Black-White Mountain?" Ling Xu greeted a middle-aged man with a smile.

"For my junior brother, I specifically came here to seek a Yin-Yang Great Medicine. I didn't expect that Mountain Lord to be so formidable, his identity is not simple, but it was worth the trip after all," the middle-aged man surnamed Zhao walked over.

Close behind him was a young man, tall and strong, somewhat unlike an Outer Realm person. His name was Zheng Maoze.

Qin Ming recognized him; this was a direct descendant of the Zheng family, and also the elder brother of Zheng Maorong, whom he had once impersonated in the Night Mist's black market.

"Brother Ling, I heard you also obtained a Yin-Yang Great Medicine in Black-White Mountain. I wonder if you could bestow one or two upon us?" the middle-aged man surnamed Zhao asked.

Ling Xu shook his head. "Rumor! You wouldn't actually believe it, would you? The Black-White Great Medicine was all snatched by that white-furred old beast. If you ask me for it, I suspect you're trying to recruit me as your divine armored guard?"

The middle-aged man surnamed Zhao shook his head. "How dare we? Others may not know, but I do, don't I? You are an expert of the Esoteric Sect, very good at keeping secrets."

Qin Ming was surprised. The former City Lord actually walked two paths. It seemed no famous expert was a simple individual.

At the same time, he sighed inwardly, the path of bodily mutation had completely become a mere backdrop, often used by experts of other paths to conceal their true origins.

The group approached, clearly not from a single lineage of Dao; there were many different inheritances among Outer Realm individuals, with competition existing between them.

Qin Ming saw some familiar faces: Lu Zhenyi, Zeng Yuan, Chen Bingyan. Some were direct descendants of aristocratic families, while others had unknown identities but had once stayed in Clear River City, waiting for Outer Realm individuals to accept them as disciples. They all knew each other, some quite well.

Behind them were other Outer Realm disciples whom Qin Ming did not recognize.

"Cui Chonghe, um, my apologies, I didn't mean to, I just got used to calling you that. To think we'd meet here, after more than two years apart, are you doing well?" The tall and sturdy Zheng Maoze was the first to approach.

He walked at the very front, naturally spotting his "old acquaintance" first.

"I didn't expect to meet Young Master Zheng here," Qin Ming said.

Though Zheng Maoze was stout, his words weren't crude. He shook his head and pointed at Qin Ming with a smile, saying, "You're being too formal. We're old friends, is it appropriate to call me Young Master? What would others think? They'd misunderstand that our statuses are different, and that I'm being disrespectful or looking down on you."

"Alright, Big Zheng, you really haven't changed!" Qin Ming laughed heartily.

Zheng Maoze's expression immediately stiffened slightly. Because of his slightly stocky build and tall stature, some people in the past had called him "Zheng the Stout."

Back then, Cui Chonghe was very affectionate, calling him "Big Zheng."

This was not exactly derogatory, as he was indeed very tall, and his family had once wanted him to pursue the path of a Divine Giant, but thankfully he was more destined for immortality.

Now, for the other party to actually dare to call him "Big Zheng" again, it did show some courage.

How could Qin Ming not understand him? Despite his seemingly frank demeanor just now, this person had a rough exterior but a meticulous mind; he was not easy to deal with.

Just considering how sinister his younger brother Zheng Maorong was, he definitely wouldn't be a benevolent character either.

Ning Siqi had already told Qin Ming to be wary of Zheng Maorong; it was this person's subtle hints that had recently caused others to target him.

If the younger brother was like this, what about the elder brother?

"You, ah, your personality really hasn't changed. It's truly better this way, not being formal, it shows our relationship can stand the test of time," Zheng Maoze said with a随和 (easygoing) smile. He asked, "So what do you call yourself now? How should I address you?"

Qin Ming naturally understood that "Zheng the Stout," while smiling at him, was also reminding him that their statuses were now different.

He didn't believe that the other party didn't know his current name; Ning Siqi had said that his younger brother often corresponded with him.

Qin Ming smiled. "I also feel you're still as friendly as ever. Just call me Qin Ming. It's only been two years since we last met, but I see you're already ethereal and immortal-like, your temperament greatly changed. You must be dominating your generation, just as you wished!"

"Chonghe, no, Qin Ming, don't talk nonsense like that in front of so many people, flattering me to death and putting me in hot water!" Zheng Maoze quickly and seriously stopped him.

He deeply understood the principle that "the most outstanding tree in the forest will be destroyed by the wind." Even ordinary people knew that "the protruding rafter rots first." He immediately looked around and said, "I'm still just a small disciple, insignificant as a feather in front of so many senior brothers and sisters."

Qin Ming said, "Big Zheng, you're being too modest!"

Zheng Maoze did not get entangled with him, immediately changing the topic. "Did you not see Wang Caiwei?"

"No!" Qin Ming replied with a simple word.

"She should show up in a moment," Zheng Maoze smiled.

"Qin Ming."

"Still well?"

"How are you?"

Lu Zhenyi, Zeng Yuan, and Chen Bingyan walked over, all former acquaintances, greeting him here.

Soon, several other old friends came from afar. Regardless of what they truly thought, since some had stepped forward to speak, others couldn't be too shallow-minded. They all greeted him with smiles and asked about his recent situation.

They had naturally noticed that Qin Ming was carrying a blood-stained hammer, understanding his current predicament: his immortal destiny had been severed, and he was no longer on the same path as them.

"In a moment, Li Qingxu, Wang Caiwei, and Cui Chonghe might also arrive successively," someone whispered, unsure if it was to remind Qin Ming or to provide a topic for others, knowing it would inevitably stir up ripples.
