# Chapter 180: In the Next Life, I'll Still Be Your Big Brother

As luck would have it, the person Zhou Tian chose was none other than the Sword-Wielding Heavenly King who had attacked first.

The Sword-Wielding Heavenly King had lost all his former dignity. Seeing Zhou Tian approach him, his body shone brightly, energy surged within him, and his heart trembled. Zhou Tian's speed was clearly faster than his, and he was about to catch up.

“Fellow Daoist, it’s just a stroke of luck, why go to such extremes?!” he shouted. Golden blood spewed from his mouth as a bloody aura ignited around him, his speed escalating a notch. He had used a forbidden technique, attempting to escape Zhou Tian.

“I’m a person with too much pride. If I don’t beat you all to death, I’ll be too ashamed to face my little brothers! I might as well die!”

Zhou Tian’s speed also escalated, becoming even faster than the Sword-Wielding Heavenly King’s.

The Sword-Wielding Heavenly King couldn’t help but cough up a mouthful of old blood. *What kind of freak have I encountered?* he thought. *And he’s ‘too proud’? Isn’t crushing seven of us enough? He actually wants to kill us, does he really think we’re trash? But the most crucial thing is, he’s actually trying to self-destruct now!* He felt that he was having a string of bad luck; perhaps someone had cast a curse on him to bring about such a disaster.

Seeing that he couldn’t create any distance no matter what, a surge of hatred welled up in his heart, fueling his courage. He, too, chose a Heavenly King, changed direction, and flew towards him. *I can’t be the only one to suffer this calamity!*

“You son of a bitch!”

That Heavenly King’s face turned as ugly as if he had eaten shit. He quickly headed towards another Heavenly King, his thoughts mirroring those of the Sword-Wielding Heavenly King.

It seemed to form a loop: in an instant, it became Zhou Tian once again chasing the seven Heavenly Kings. In reality, if even one person hadn’t harbored the thought of ‘If I’m miserable, you won’t be happy either,’ this situation wouldn’t have formed. But they were mere acquaintances, and their recent alliance was only to deal with Zhou Tian and the Saint Devil; no one would have such a mindset.

Zhou Tian’s body swelled larger and larger. The few people ahead ran without looking back, because there was no point in turning to fight. It was better to run as far as they could.

While everyone was playing hide-and-seek with Zhou Tian, no one noticed that the two phantoms behind the Saint Devil had completely merged. The lotus seed floated at the Saint Devil’s glabella, almost fusing into his skull. A mysterious aura overflowed from his body, and various phenomena were unfolding.

Zhou Tian continuously devoured heterogeneous energies, turning his body into a reaction furnace. This was a very ineffable sensation, different from his last mutual destruction with the King of Gods. That time, he was rushed, fearing unforeseen changes, but this time was different; he had ample time. His body was almost transparent, revealing thunder, flames, chilling winds, and heavy water surging within. Zhou Tian was both pained and delighted.

The Heavenly Kings ran headlong, all using forbidden techniques for acceleration. Zhou Tian’s body suddenly trembled, like a shiver from urination, and an inexplicable feeling surged into his heart. Zhou Tian knew he could no longer suppress it.

Suddenly, he accelerated again. This was Zhou Tian’s true speed, which he had never exposed, fearing the opponents might have some tricks. Now, unleashing it, he caught them off guard.

The seven Heavenly Kings’ faces all changed dramatically. They hadn’t expected Zhou Tian to still hide such a move. *He must be insane,* they thought. *He’s about to self-destruct, yet he’s still thinking about how to trap others!* They wanted to use their forbidden divine arts again, but it was too late.

“Little brother, in the next life, I’ll still be your big brother!” Zhou Tian roared, and his body completely split open.

The phenomena evolving around the Saint Devil paused; he was disgusted.

A massive explosion occurred in that place. Dazzling light flashed, obscuring everything. Even more terrifying were the waves of light blasted forth, shattering the void itself. Heterogeneous energies surged out, thunder transforming into dragons, scarlet flames into phoenixes, intertwining and mutating, raging wildly. Heavy water from the Nine Heavens poured down, smashing through space. This was just a glimpse of the scene.

The seven Heavenly Kings gathered together, casting aside their previous grievances. Various exotic treasures were brought out: a golden scroll, a small purple pagoda, a crimson censer, and several divine abilities were unleashed: an earthy yellow mountain, a shield of thunder, all deployed.

Rip! The scroll shattered. This was a Dao character personally inscribed by a Dao Lord, possessing immense power, yet at this moment, it was torn apart like a thin sheet of paper.

Crack! The small pagoda shattered, and a Heavenly King spat out blood, his face pale.

Boom! The censer exploded, scarlet flames scattering everywhere. A red-haired Heavenly King showed a pained expression.

The mountain teetered, and the divine thunder shield trembled, but they barely managed to block the first wave of impact. However, the faces of those Heavenly Kings grew even uglier, because deep within the raging heterogeneous energies, there was a black, murky mass—that was chaotic energy, and the true main force had yet to erupt.

“Do your best, and leave the rest to fate!” the Heavenly King holding the divine thunder shield roared, actually producing a ball of lightning from his hand. He held it carefully, as if it were a delicate piece of porcelain. Although lightning bolts shot out, a powerful life force resonated in the area.

Someone’s pupils constricted as they recognized the item. This was a life force nurtured from ultimate destruction, capable of bringing the dead back to life and regenerating flesh and bone. The others also successively pulled out their most valuable hidden treasures, preparing for the true impact that was to come!

Boom! The second wave of explosion began. The mass of chaotic energy gently swelled like a bubble, then burst. Though seemingly subtle, it was actually like a million volcanoes erupting simultaneously. The immense energy exploded, causing the entire space to pause, then shatter.

The surging energy annihilated everything. However, this energy, capable of destroying all, was blocked by an invisible barrier when it reached close to the Saint Devil, unable to advance even an inch. At this moment, the lotus seed had truly fused into his forehead. His hair flowed loose, each strand as dazzling as obsidian. His body was lustrous, as if water could be squeezed from it. His brows and eyes trembled slightly, as if he were about to awaken.

When the dust settled, within the protective circle formed by the seven Heavenly Kings, only four barely managed to stand. Their clothes were tattered, and their bodies were covered in blood, but energy circulated within them, repairing their forms.

“What a pity for those fellow Daoists,” the Thunder Heavenly King said. He was still alive, and in just a moment, his skin had already regrown, becoming fair and tender. The life lightning had a miraculous effect, and coupled with the chaotic energy’s insufficient sustained power, he barely managed to endure.

“Indeed,” the Red-haired Heavenly King said, though there was no regret on his face. The trump cards of those who survived were more formidable, but the three who died weren’t so fortunate. They were just a hair short compared to the others and could only turn to ash.

“Where did such a lunatic come from?!” someone cursed loudly, holding half a broken blade in his hand. He had just exhausted almost all his wealth; how could he not be angry?

“However, we’ve finally escaped this calamity,” someone sighed in relief. No matter how good the treasures, they weren’t as important as one’s own life. Being alive was the best.
