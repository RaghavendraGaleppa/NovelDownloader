# Chapter 94: Reconciliation

"My apologies, Senior, but I am not a disciple of the Sacred Sect."

Facing True Monarch Chongguang's inquiry, Lu Yang shook his head and said, "I am merely a rogue cultivator who was fortunate enough to obtain the inheritance of the ancient Witchghost Dao."

"...Oh?"

Upon hearing this, True Monarch Chongguang's brows immediately furrowed, his formerly amiable expression gradually shifting.

However, the very next second, Lu Yang's tone changed:
"However, I would be quite willing to join the Sacred Sect. I can also leave a copy of the Witchghost Dao inheritance in my possession for the Sacred Sect, considering it Lu's welcome gift."

As soon as these words were spoken, True Monarch Chongguang's brows instantly relaxed:

"Hahaha, why be so polite, fellow Daoist?"

It seems this True Monarch had many enemies in the Sacred Sect in their previous life, to the extent that even after reincarnation, they wish to cut ties with their past and avoid bearing the karma of their former life. Thinking this, True Monarch Chongguang immediately calmed down. After all, there were quite a few True Monarchs in the Sacred Sect who cut ties with their past lives and pretended to be newcomers; it wasn't particularly rare. He immediately laughed heartily and said, "The Sect naturally welcomes fellow Daoist's willingness to join us. May I inquire about fellow Daoist's intentions?"

"I wish to guard the Northern Marches."

Lu Yang said without hesitation, "As I am new to the Sacred Sect, I wish to guard Skeleton Mountain, repel the Divine Martial Gate from the north, and return to the Sacred Sect to report once the task is complete."

"...Good!"

True Monarch Chongguang immediately nodded in satisfaction, his gaze towards Lu Yang growing even more appreciative. "Since that is the case, it shall be as fellow Daoist wishes."

To be honest, he didn't care at all about Lu Yang's true identity. Although he was over ninety percent certain that Lu Yang was a True Monarch of the Sacred Sect, it actually didn't matter if he wasn't. The key lay in the value Lu Yang demonstrated. Whether he was useful to the Sacred Sect. As long as he was useful, many things would be overlooked. And Lu Yang's initiative in proposing to "guard the Northern Marches" was undoubtedly a display of his value. This attitude was the reason True Monarch Chongguang was satisfied.

'No doubt about it, he's definitely a reincarnated True Monarch of my Sacred Sect.'

At the same time, seeing True Monarch Chongguang readily agree, Lu Yang also breathed a sigh of relief. After all, with his current cultivation, he truly dared not return to the Sacred Sect. Although True Monarch Chongguang and the Patching Heaven Peak Master both believed he was a reincarnated True Monarch, Lu Yang knew very well that his so-called reincarnated identity couldn't withstand scrutiny. If it were to alert a Golden Core True Lord within the Sacred Sect, a single glance would surely expose him, and he would have no choice but to 'reopen' (restart his life/reincarnate again). Therefore, the current outcome was good for everyone.

Just then, the void beside True Monarch Chongguang cracked open, and a black-robed man stepped out, who was none other than True Monarch Yinshan, familiar to Lu Yang.

"Yinshan?" True Monarch Chongguang asked in surprise, "Why have you come here?"

"You make me laugh, Senior Brother."

True Monarch Yinshan first glanced at Lu Yang, then cupped his hands and said, "Fellow Daoist, I am Yinshan. I have an impertinent request for coming here this time. These eight hundred li of Skeleton Mountain, having been refined by the Witchghost Dao in the past, possess extremely peculiar earth veins. They are connected to the Witchghost Dao's secret realm and have been nourished by countless witchghosts for a thousand years, likely giving birth to a trace of [Heavenly Corpse Malice]. This object is located in an Earthly Fiend position, specifically [Zhixu], and it pertains to my cultivation. I implore fellow Daoist to part with it."

As soon as these words were spoken, True Monarch Chongguang's expression subtly changed. Lu Yang, however, was momentarily stunned, then quickly realized: this was the very item True Monarch Yinshan had painstakingly plotted to obtain from the secret realm in his previous life.

It pertains to a Foundation Establishment True Person's cultivation?

Upon hearing this, Lu Yang sensed the earth veins of Skeleton Mountain and indeed saw a trace of extremely Yin and gentle, turbid and unfathomable Netherworld Qi deep within the earth veins. This is the [Heavenly Corpse Malice]? Regarding the cultivation of Foundation Establishment True Persons, the Witchghost Dao inheritance also contained an overview, but due to the sheer size of the inheritance, Lu Yang hadn't had time to examine it in detail before. Thinking this, Lu Yang secretly noted down the item in his mind while smiling, "This matter is simple. I can certainly decide to gift it to fellow Daoist. However, this item is located deep within the earth veins and cannot be disturbed lightly; it needs to be slowly extracted... It will take approximately thirty years to refine a single trace."

"No matter." True Monarch Yinshan immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Mere thirty years, a flick of a finger. As long as he could break through to the mid-Foundation Establishment stage with the aid of the [Heavenly Corpse Malice], this amount of time was nothing to him.

"Good!"

True Monarch Chongguang was also overjoyed at this sight and secretly transmitted his voice, "Many thanks, fellow Daoist, for assisting Yinshan. After this matter, fellow Daoist need not worry about Patching Heaven." The implication was that he would mediate a reconciliation for Lu Yang. Although in Lu Yang's view, he wouldn't have to worry about the Patching Heaven Peak Master's threat for the next three to five decades, as by the time the Peak Master recovered from his injuries, Lu Yang would have long since reached Foundation Establishment. However, since True Monarch Chongguang offered this favor, he naturally couldn't refuse it, and immediately cupped his hands in thanks.

For a time, both host and guests were delighted. Afterward, the three chatted extensively for a long time before True Monarch Chongguang finally left with the Patching Heaven Peak Master. Lu Yang, on the other hand, returned to his loyal Skeleton Mountain Market.

"A familiar place..."

Lu Yang transformed into a streak of light and directly chose the Blood-clothed Tower, his retreat location from his previous life. His vast spiritual sense instantly swept across the entire market. Sensing his spiritual sense, the entire market immediately became fervent.

"Greetings, True Monarch!"

Countless people respectfully saluted, their voices filled with deference and fanaticism. Lu Yang even spotted a peerlessly beautiful woman among them.

'She's here too? So early?'

Lu Yang's expression was strange, for the woman who stood out like a crane among chickens in the crowd was none other than Fairy Feixia, with whom he had a deep acquaintance in his previous life. Her expression was as cold as ice, seemingly showing no warmth to anyone. However, Lu Yang knew that once one peeled back that cold exterior and entered her heart, one could fully experience the warmth beneath her chill.

.

Withdrawing his gaze, Lu Yang had no intention of rekindling old flames. Rather, in his previous life, it had simply been a mutually beneficial arrangement, and they had parted on good terms. In this life, he had more important things to do. Thinking this, Lu Yang immediately waved his hand to dismiss the crowd, then chose a quiet room. With a shake of the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, he summoned his Dharma Protector Deity, Sunü, once more.

"Your servant greets Master."

"Kneel."

At Lu Yang's command, Sunü immediately knelt, prostrating herself completely. Her taut outer garment outlined a graceful curve on her body. However, Lu Yang paid no mind to the undulating beauty before him. Instead, he focused intently on studying Sunü's Dharma body. After all, this Dharma Protector Deity had been immediately put into combat after he refined her, and he hadn't had the chance to fully comprehend many of her profound mysteries, which required in-depth research.

"A Dharma Protector Deity can bear karma on one's behalf."

With a thought, Lu Yang packaged all the remaining thoughts of Patriarch Tingyou and the entire inheritance of the Witchghost Dao, then directly threw them to Sunü. The next second, Lu Yang looked up at the sky. Originally, by accepting the inheritance, he had formed karma with the Witchghost Dao, and even with that Golden Core True Lord far away in the heavens. However, now the karma had been transferred. It had fallen upon Sunü.

"Speaking of which, the karma of the Witchghost Dao isn't as terrifying as I imagined. Otherwise, that True Lord from the Sword Pavilion would have long since smacked me dead with a single palm." Lu Yang pondered, "It makes sense. The Witchghost Dao is merely a Foundation Establishment lineage. The only one that truly made that True Lord wary was Patriarch Tingyou himself. Now that Patriarch Tingyou is dead, and I am just a nobody whose Dharma Protector Deity, Sunü, also has a broken path, how could I attract the attention of a True Lord?" At most, it would only attract the karmic targeting of that sword qi. However, in this life, the sword qi has dissipated. Even if carrying the Witchghost Dao's karma might invite the sword qi's targeting, that would be a matter for the next life. And even then, he had a countermeasure.

"Once I 'reopen' using the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes and select things like cultivation, talent, or even treasures, they cannot be traced back to any karma!" Lu Yang had personally tested this point long ago. Any cultivation obtained through the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes, no matter who deduced it or how, all karma would be severed on the very first day of his 'reopening'. There would be no cause or effect, nor any trace to follow. All the karma of his previous lives would be cleansed by the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes after a 'reopen'. Of course, this was limited only to the parts selected by the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes: cultivation, treasures, talent. For instance, with the 《Nine Transformations Dragon Manual》, although no one could deduce the origin of his cultivation after he selected it, this cultivation method itself would not be concealed. The result was that he was almost locked onto by the Patching Heaven Peak Master right after 'reopening'.

"If I can break through to Foundation Establishment in this life, then so be it. If not... next life, I'll choose a treasure!" Thinking this, Lu Yang looked at the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner in his hand. He planned to transfer his Dharma Protector Deity, and even the myriad witchghosts of the Witchghost Dao, all onto the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner. Since it's called the Ten Thousand Spirits Banner, the true spirits on the banner should naturally be part of the magic treasure itself. This way, perhaps he could both sever ties with the Witchghost Dao using the power of the Book of a Hundred Lifetimes and also claim benefits like the [Yamalord Hall] for himself.

"First, let's see if this works. If it doesn't work, then at worst, after 'reopening,' I'll just hide within the Sacred Sect and not come out. I refuse to believe that sword qi can cleave its way into the Sacred Sect's Cloud Sea Connecting Heaven!"
