# Chapter 20: The "Frostlight Needle" Magical Artifact

Not only was Wei Qian satisfied with Bai Fugui, but Bai Fugui also had a favorable impression of Wei Qian.

Wei Qian had previously commissioned Bai Fugui to collect various illustrated books, biographies, essays, and other miscellaneous writings from the cultivation world, paying him thirty spirit stones upfront—pure profit!

These miscellaneous books were practically worthless, requiring only time to gather. Others might not bother, as those dedicated to the Great Dao wouldn't take on such tasks. But who was Bai Fugui? A disciple of a minor cultivation family with inferior spiritual roots, destined never to attain the Great Dao in this lifetime.

What was a little time to him?

Over two years, Bai Fugui collected thousands of miscellaneous books for Wei Qian, totaling over a hundred million words. During this time, Wei Qian split his days between cultivation and reading, relying on a cultivator's extraordinary memory to skim through hundreds of lines at a glance—yet he had only managed to read two-thirds of the collection.

"But this has actually been greatly beneficial to me," Wei Qian mused, setting down an illustrated book in his residence and gazing at the greenery outside to rest his eyes. His knowledge and insight had far surpassed what they had been two years ago.

Take one simple example. Two years ago, he had only known that the sudden appearance of the Golden Core demonic cultivator, Wuchang Zhenren, came from a demonic sect in the far northern lands—Soulshaking Mountain. Beyond that, he knew nothing.

Now, he knew that Wuchang Zhenren hailed from the far northern nation of "Liao," meaning "vast" in their tongue. And indeed, the Liao Kingdom spanned hundreds of millions of miles, all under the rule of the Seven Demonic Sects. Soulshaking Mountain was merely one of them.

Each demonic faction had at least one Nascent Soul cultivator overseeing it!

When Wei Qian first read this, he was deeply shaken. The strongest sect in the entire Zhao Kingdom, the Myriad Stars Sect, had only one Nascent Soul True Monarch. No wonder, a thousand years ago, when the Seven Demonic Sects invaded, the various cultivation nations had to unite to resist.

Wei Qian's thoughts drifted further as he stared at the greenery outside.

"The Seven Demonic Sects share a common origin. This is because, two thousand years ago, they split from the same great demonic sect." The demonic practitioners referred to it as the "Sacred Sect," while the book recorded the righteous cultivators' name for it—the "Primordial Demonic Sect."

"If each of the Seven Demonic Sects has at least one Nascent Soul, then the Primordial Demonic Sect two thousand years ago must have had at least seven Nascent Souls?" At this thought, Wei Qian shuddered and forced himself to stop pondering.

For mortals, Qi Refining cultivators were already immortals—but to Qi Refining cultivators, Nascent Souls were immortals too! For a mortal to speculate about immortals was futile.

"Better to focus on matters appropriate to my current level," Wei Qian thought. "Like the upcoming expedition."

Two years ago, Wei Qian had slain the bandit cultivator and reaped a windfall. Out of caution, he had hidden some of the valuables elsewhere, though he had long since retrieved them. Yet he hadn't sold them.

Exchanging them at distant markets was too risky. Entrusting them to Bai Fugui? The sum was too large—Wei Qian didn’t trust him enough. Instead, he waited for the trade fair, held every three months. After two years, next month would finally see the Li Family of Mist Ridge Mountain hosting it again.

"The high-grade spear artifact can't be sold. The three spirit herbs—can't sell them all. The second-grade talismans—also can't sell them." Wei Qian carefully calculated what he could part with. He intended to gather enough spirit stones to purchase cultivation-enhancing pills and a mid-grade offensive artifact. He also wanted to see if he could find poisons or venom for sale.

Time passed swiftly, and soon the trade fair arrived. The venue was the same broad training ground as before. Last time, Wei Qian had been a guest. This time, he was a vendor.

As a quasi-member of the Li Family, he enjoyed a small privilege—no stall fee. He set out a jade box containing the spirit herb "Frostgrass" and waited patiently for interested buyers.

One by one, cultivators approached to inquire.

"Fellow Daoist, how much for this Frostgrass?"

"Two hundred spirit stones? Too expensive! This herb has been stored for years—even with the jade box, I'd say it's lost ten percent of its potency. Lower the price."

Wei Qian haggled with each visitor. By the end of the day, he sold the Frostgrass for 183 spirit stones. Combined with the stones he had taken from the bandit and his earnings from working for the Li Family—minus expenses—he had 129 left. In total, 312 spirit stones.

More than enough for a mid-grade artifact. With a little extra, he could even afford a high-grade one.

On the second day of the fair, Wei Qian became a buyer, scanning the stalls for artifacts that caught his eye. At one female cultivator's stall, he paused.

She had three artifacts on display, one of which was a needle-like artifact as clear as white crystal.

"Fellow Daoist, how much for this needle artifact?" Wei Qian asked.

The woman was engrossed in a book and only responded after Wei Qian called twice. "This 'Frostlight Needle' costs 300 spirit stones," she answered after glancing at it.

"Three hundred?" Wei Qian frowned. "That's far too expensive."

A typical mid-grade artifact priced above 200 was already considered high quality.

"This was a keepsake from my elder—" she began.

Wei Qian cut her off. "Are you saying the price includes sentimental value?"

"No, no," she clarified. "My elder told me this Frostlight Needle is nearly a high-grade artifact. Three hundred is fair."

She then allowed Wei Qian to inspect it. He channeled spiritual energy into the needle and confirmed her claim—it was indeed close to high-grade.

"But 'close' isn't the same as actually being high-grade!" After a fierce round of bargaining, Wei Qian secured it for 280 spirit stones.

Once the transaction was complete, the artifact was his. He tested it, manipulating the Frostlight Needle through the air.

"Perfect for ambushes," Wei Qian mused. Paired with poison and his Wish Power, a surprise attack could easily fell a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator.

With that in mind, his next goal was clear: find stronger toxins. After scouring the fair, he indeed found what he sought.
