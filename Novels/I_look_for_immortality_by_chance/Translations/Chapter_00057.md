# Chapter 57: Qian Yuan Cave and Planting the Spirit Tree  

Under the jurisdiction of the Hidden Dragon Academy were three islands: White Egret Island, Azure Light Island, and Golden Origin Island.  

Among them, White Egret Island housed cultivators below the fifth layer of Qi Refinement, while Azure Light Island was generally reserved for those between the fifth and eighth layers.  

Golden Origin Island, with the most abundant spiritual energy, was almost exclusively occupied by ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators—those just a step away from Foundation Establishment.  

Given Gu Yuan's current cultivation level, he should, in principle, only be permitted to cultivate on Azure Light Island.  

But rules were never absolute—there was always room for maneuvering.  

Golden Origin Island's spiritual energy was exceptionally dense, reaching the upper second-grade spiritual vein standard. Outside the academy, such a spiritual vein would only be enjoyed by the Foundation Establishment elders of minor sects.  

Even within the academy, the spiritual veins of some smaller clans weren't as rich—or at least, they wouldn’t be so extravagant as to allocate such resources to Qi Refinement disciples.  

Golden Origin Island wasn't large, and the number of ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators was limited, so some cave dwellings often remained vacant. These empty caves became the targets of those with the right connections.  

This was precisely why Gu Yuan had come to seek Qiu Mingshan today.  

To nurture the Small Colossus Spirit Tree, he needed a place rich in spiritual energy. The denser the spiritual energy, the faster the tree would grow—perhaps even producing a leaf in less than a month.  

This would significantly accelerate his cultivation progress.  

"Golden Origin Island?"  

Upon hearing Gu Yuan's request, Qiu Mingshan's brows furrowed slightly before relaxing again.  

Originally, the vacant caves on Golden Origin Island were prime opportunities for him to extract benefits—each one could bring in substantial bribes.  

If an ordinary person had come offering just twenty spirit stones and a Fire Flame Fruit, Qiu Mingshan would have long since kicked them out.  

But when his gaze fell upon the Eight Winds Treasure Ring at Gu Yuan’s waist, he made up his mind instantly.  

*"A mere cave in exchange for the goodwill of a Golden Core elder—definitely worth it!"*  

Without hesitation, he thumped his chest and declared loudly, "Junior Brother, rest assured! Leave this matter to me—I guarantee your satisfaction."  

"Then I must thank Senior Brother!"  

Gu Yuan smiled and bowed in gratitude, inwardly marveling at how useful the influence of a Golden Core elder could be.  

"However, Junior Brother, before that, there’s one small matter I must trouble you with. Only then can I arrange a cave for you."  

Qiu Mingshan suddenly spoke again.  

"What matter might that be?"  

Gu Yuan asked curiously.  

"The sect has its rules. Strictly speaking, as a sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, you aren’t qualified to reside on Golden Origin Island. Even I can’t directly arrange this."  

"But if you’ve rendered service to the sect—or to the Personnel Hall—then there’s justification to promote you to Golden Origin Island."  

Qiu Mingshan smiled meaningfully.  

"How might I render such service?"  

Gu Yuan inquired humbly.  

"The Fate Hall has a task issued by the Personnel Hall—they seek a spiritual artifact called the 'Bone Mirror.' This mirror can assess a cultivator’s innate talent, physique, and potential, making it invaluable to the Personnel Hall. If you can procure this mirror, you’ll have rendered a great service, and your promotion to Golden Origin Island will be justified."  

Qiu Mingshan grinned, opening his palm.  

Gu Yuan looked down to see a shimmering mirror engraved with sun and moon patterns, glowing with an unusual radiance.  

The two exchanged a glance before bursting into laughter.

### Golden Origin Island  

Before a cave dwelling near the Great Marsh, Qiu Mingshan handed a jade token to Gu Yuan.  

"Junior Brother Gu, this is the cave’s token. From now on, this Qian Yuan Cave belongs to you."  

"The caves on Golden Origin Island are unique—each comes with ten earth spirit puppets imbued with earth and wood spiritual energy. They can modify the cave according to your needs."  

"You’re a bit unlucky, though. In previous years, each cave also came with three pearl maidens to handle miscellaneous tasks. But after some disciples were reported for indulging in pleasure, the sect abolished the maidens. If you want them now, you’ll have to acquire them yourself."  

Qiu Mingshan explained as he handed over the token.  

"No matter."  

Gu Yuan shook his head.  

He didn’t care about pearl maidens—as long as he had a spiritual site for cultivation, that was enough.  

"True. Junior Brother has great fortune ahead of him and should focus on advancing his cultivation. Indulgence is beneath you."  

"I only hope that when Junior Brother rises to prominence, you won’t forget this Senior Brother!"  

Qiu Mingshan nodded approvingly before adding a reminder.  

"Senior Brother, rest assured—as long as the elder doesn’t forget me, I won’t forget you."  

Gu Yuan turned with a smile, giving a solemn promise.  

*But whether the elder remembers me or not… well, that’s up to your luck, Senior Brother.*  

Gu Yuan added silently in his heart.  

"Excellent, excellent!"  

Qiu Mingshan had gone to great lengths to secure this connection. With Gu Yuan’s assurance, his mood soared.  

In his eyes, since Gu Yuan had been bestowed the Eight Winds Treasure Ring, the elder would never forget him.  

His presence in the Hidden Dragon Academy was surely part of the elder’s hidden plans.  

The influence of the Eight Winds Treasure Ring was truly overwhelming—no matter what Gu Yuan did now, Qiu Mingshan would interpret it as the elder’s grand design.  

After exchanging a few more pleasantries, Qiu Mingshan departed, and Gu Yuan entered the cave with the token in hand.

### Qian Yuan Cave  

Qian Yuan Cave was several times larger than the nameless cave Gu Yuan had occupied on White Egret Island.  

It wasn’t just a cave—it was more like an entire estate.  

By the Great Marsh, nestled among bamboo groves, stood a secluded and luxurious courtyard complete with reception halls, alchemy rooms, sleeping chambers, and a kitchen.  

Behind the courtyard rose a cliff face, within which lay the true Qian Yuan Cave.  

The spacious cavern was filled with thick, mist-like spiritual energy, giving the cave an ethereal, immortal aura. After just a few steps inside, Gu Yuan felt his spiritual power stirring with excitement.  

This was a spiritual site fit for Foundation Establishment cultivators.  

Even without employing any special techniques, Gu Yuan—still at the sixth layer of Qi Refinement—could feel his cultivation speed increasing significantly just by standing here.  

"Truly a treasure of a place. Only an institution like the academy could afford such extravagance."  

Gu Yuan couldn’t help but marvel.  

The most important measure of a sect’s strength was its spiritual veins.  

Those who occupied lands with overwhelming spiritual energy were invariably powerful sects.  

The academy’s greatest benefit was precisely these spiritual veins, which surpassed the usual standards for cultivators of their level.  

Even Azure Light Island would have been sufficient for Qi Refinement disciples—Golden Origin Island was outright luxurious.  

Had it not been for his borrowed influence, Gu Yuan would never have been able to reside here.  

Such a precious place couldn’t be wasted.  

With that in mind, Gu Yuan wasted no time. After familiarizing himself with the cave, he sat on the central meditation mat and retrieved the Small Colossus Spirit Tree.  

The sapling hadn’t yet been planted, so its spiritual essence was faint. But sensing the abundant spiritual energy in the cave, it began to glow faintly, as if eager to absorb it all.  

Gu Yuan took out a jade-green slip, carefully studying its contents several times. Once fully prepared, he pricked his fingertip and let a drop of his essence blood fall.  

He would use his blood to plant the tree—and deceive the heavens!
