# Chapter 132: The Meeting  

As Li Shiming controlled the bronze corpse to clear out sea beasts on Qingyi Island, his spiritual sense detected a terrifying aura rapidly approaching.  

The speed was unlike anything he had ever experienced.  

In an instant, a shadowy figure appeared before them, reaching out to grab Ren Fei'er.  

Li Shiming didn’t even have time to command the bronze corpse to block the figure—it was simply too fast. The only thing he could do was activate his fastest technique, the "Sword Control Art." The Green Kite Wooden Sword transformed into a streak of sword light, intercepting the shadow.  

The shadow’s hand moved as if plucking a flower, effortlessly catching the sword light. The light reverted to the wooden sword, writhing in the figure’s grasp before being crushed.  

Li Shiming felt as if his mind had been struck by a heavy hammer. The destruction of the sword severed his spiritual connection to it, and the backlash from losing a refined artifact struck his consciousness.  

He spat out a mouthful of blood but still stepped forward to shield Ren Fei'er.  

By then, the shadow had solidified into the form of a beautiful woman clad in black robes.  

Her sharp gaze locked onto Li Shiming as her hand reached toward him. The sheer pressure of her movement paralyzed him completely, leaving him unable to resist.  

The energy radiating from her hand was overwhelming—Li Shiming was certain that even the slightest contact would mean instant death.  

Though filled with unwillingness, he felt no regret. To his surprise, Ren Fei'er suddenly stepped in front of him again.  

But her next words stunned him.  

"Mother! Big Brother saved me! If not for him, you wouldn’t have seen me again!" Ren Fei'er cried out, shielding Li Shiming.  

The woman known as the "Ren Demoness" of the Xuanming Sect, a formidable Golden Core cultivator, softened immediately in the presence of her daughter.  

"You’re getting bolder by the day! If not for the protective spiritual energy I placed on you activating, I wouldn’t have found you!" Elder Ren scolded, though her anger was mixed with relief.  

She had dispatched search parties the moment Ren Fei'er ran away, even enlisting Yin Shilan’s help. When she sensed the protective barrier activating, her heart nearly stopped—it was only triggered when Ren Fei'er faced mortal danger.  

"I didn’t expect the Spirit Attraction Liquid to be so effective!" Ren Fei'er muttered sheepishly.  

At the mention of the liquid, Elder Ren couldn’t hold back. She rapped Ren Fei'er on the head, making her eyes well up with tears.  

Li Shiming stood awkwardly to the side. It wasn’t his place to interfere in a mother disciplining her daughter—especially when said mother could crush him with a flick of her finger.  

He averted his gaze from Ren Fei'er’s pitiful expression and surveyed the surroundings.  

The battle had already ended—not because the bronze corpse had finished the fight, but because Elder Ren’s mere presence had annihilated all the sea beasts.  

This made it clear that she had held back against Li Shiming. Recognizing his efforts to protect Ren Fei'er, she could have easily killed him with her aura alone.  

"You’re going into seclusion for a year when we return. No leaving before then!" Elder Ren declared sternly.  

Ren Fei'er looked even more devastated than when she had been hit. Tears streamed down her face as she kicked Li Shiming’s leg in frustration.  

*Because of this jerk, I’m grounded for a whole year!*  

Li Shiming didn’t understand why she had kicked him, assuming it was just misplaced frustration.  

Elder Ren’s eyes flickered knowingly. She knew her daughter too well.  

"Young man, you saved Fei'er, but I destroyed your artifact. Since that wooden sword didn’t suit your attributes, I’ll compensate you with this metal-attribute sword." She tossed aside the fragments of the Green Kite Wooden Sword and handed him a sleek, small blade.  

Though unrefined, Li Shiming could already sense its superior quality and compatibility with his own spiritual energy.  

"Mother, you’re so stingy! Big Brother saved me, and all you give him is a high-grade artifact?" Ren Fei'er pouted.  

"You’re one to talk! Let’s see how many of your life-saving treasures are left when we get back!" Elder Ren glared at her before turning to Li Shiming. "Your cultivation is too weak. Giving you anything stronger would only bring trouble."  

She scrutinized him, making him feel as though his entire being was laid bare—even his bones.  

"Your spiritual roots are mediocre. Stop wasting time on miscellaneous techniques and focus on strengthening your foundation. Only those with heavenly spiritual roots can afford to diversify. With your aptitude, even reaching Foundation Establishment will be difficult."  

"However, I’m surprised you’ve cultivated spiritual sense. And your intact primordial yang is an advantage—it increases your chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment by ten percent, and even aids in forming a Golden Core."  

She glanced at the bronze corpse and the mid-grade Gatling artifact in its hands before adding dismissively, "But don’t overreach."  

As a Golden Core elder, her guidance was an invaluable gift to a Qi Refinement cultivator—her way of repaying him for protecting Ren Fei'er.  

She didn’t mention the Buddhist relic she sensed on him, privately amused that some eminent monk had likely marked him for conversion.  

*Good. Once he becomes a monk, Fei'er will forget about him.*  

The year-long seclusion would also allow her to replenish Ren Fei'er’s protective spiritual energy and restock her life-saving treasures.  

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior," Li Shiming bowed deeply.  

However, he disagreed with her advice against broadening his cultivation.  

Heavenly spiritual roots allowed cultivators to train in multiple disciplines because their innate speed was at the maximum.  

Li Shiming’s own cultivation speed, though only at 27, was also at its peak.  

Moreover, he had the opportunity to cultivate the *Diamond Body Protection Divine Art* and *Sword Demon Secret Codex*. Not pursuing them would leave his Dao heart unstable.  

As he bowed, Elder Ren paid no further attention to his thoughts. Grabbing Ren Fei'er, she vanished in an instant.  

Left amidst the corpses on Qingyi Island, Li Shiming summoned his primary soul from the *Soul Control Division Technique* to harvest the lingering souls.  

Meanwhile, he collected the sea beast carcasses—valuable resources he could sell for spirit stones.  

His storage pouches quickly filled, forcing him to transfer the excess into the storage bracelet within his machine room space.  

After clearing the battlefield, he regretfully gathered the fragments of his Green Kite Wooden Sword, storing them in the machine room as a memento.  

Boarding his jade flying boat, he prepared to depart.  

As he flew away, a high-tier sea beast leaped from the water, spewing toxic black mist. The bronze corpse’s Gatling unleashed a barrage of ice bullets, shredding the mist before riddling the beast’s body.  

Li Shiming collected the corpse, realizing something odd.  

His earlier rescue had been reckless. At Qi Refinement fourth layer, even with the bronze corpse and six Gatling artifacts, facing a horde of sea beasts should have been suicidal.  

The dead cultivators must have noticed something amiss to charge in so boldly.  

None of the beasts had used their innate abilities—unlike the sea boar he’d encountered earlier, which had conjured a shield.  

He checked his haul: over ten thousand sea beast corpses, including a thousand high-tier ones.  

Saving Ren Fei'er had netted him not just a metal-attribute sword but immense wealth.  

Though most were his kills, the strongest had been annihilated by Elder Ren’s aura.  

Now, recalling Ren Fei'er’s mention of Spirit Attraction Liquid, he understood why the beasts had been so easily subdued.  

*Why overthink it? Fei'er wouldn’t care about these scraps.*  

The thought of her tearful face made him smile, though he felt a pang of loneliness knowing he wouldn’t see her for a year.  

Returning to the sect unharmed, he purchased intelligence on Elder Baili of the Sacred Ice Sect.  

The news reassured him: Elder Baili had abruptly gone into seclusion without explanation, rumored to be making a breakthrough.  

Li Shiming knew the truth—the elder was recovering from the backlash of his destroyed artifact.  

No wonder the Sacred Ice Sect hadn’t pursued him. Golden Core seclusions lasted years, buying him time to grow stronger.  

The next day, Yin Shilan returned to the sect and contacted him.  

But Ren Fei'er remained silent—likely forbidden from using her communication token during seclusion.  

Settling into routine cultivation, Li Shiming partially heeded Elder Ren’s advice.  

He reduced his studies in spiritual botany and abandoned plans to branch into other professions.  

Focusing solely on cultivation and阵法, he dedicated himself to building a solid foundation before Foundation Establishment.  

Months passed. The Yun Trading Company dominated the market with *Thousand-Mile Vision*, but as demand plateaued, sales dwindled.  

After six months, they stopped purchasing from Li Shiming altogether.  

Their attitude toward him cooled—even Yun Ze, though apologetic, couldn’t mask the rift forming between them.  

Orders for mundane supplies were rejected, and prices for other materials rose sharply.  

Li Shiming’s relationship with the Yun Trading Company had undeniably fractured.
