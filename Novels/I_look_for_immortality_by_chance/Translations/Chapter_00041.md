# Chapter 41: Lan Tianlu's "Revenge Plan" and "Fortuitous Encounter"

On the treasure ship, most passengers gathered in small groups, forming their own circles. Only Lan Tianlu stood alone in a corner, isolated.

News about the Lan family had spread. With Lan Tianming in seclusion and his wife seemingly ostracizing Lan Tianlu, his resources had dwindled, making recent days particularly difficult for him.

Noble families were quick to shift allegiances. Once pushed out of the inner circle, one's status changed dramatically.

Though his face darkened at the thought, Lan Tianlu remained silent.

Steering his silver magic boat, he swiftly landed at an uninhabited cave entrance on the fifth level of the Water Caverns.

"That thief Gu Yuan, who stole everything from me—I'll start with you!" Lan Tianlu gritted his teeth in anger as he recalled recent events, venting his fury in the solitude.

"That little thief absorbed the Spirit Flood Dragon's Heavenly Water, so his strength must be considerable within the Hidden Dragon Academy. Unless something unexpected happens, he'll likely attempt to find the Shell King. If I wait there, I'm bound to encounter him."

"Damn those foolish noble families, insisting on having Hidden Dragon Academy disciples test the monsters first! Otherwise, I could've ambushed him earlier!"

"You all may look down on the Shell King, but I need it!"

Thinking of the treasure ship's sluggish pace, Lan Tianlu seethed with silent rage, though there was nothing he could do.

Without boarding the noble families' treasure ship, his only alternative would have been the Hidden Dragon Academy's Dragon Fang Treasure Ship—after all, this was an expedition organized by the academy, and private travel was prohibited.

But had he boarded the academy's ship, he feared Gu Yuan might spot him and avoid the Shell Field altogether, complicating matters.

He needed to ensure Gu Yuan died by his hand to reclaim the Four Spirit Jade Pillars and secure a bright future for his Foundation Establishment phase.

"A slight delay doesn't matter. The Shell Field is vast, with countless cave passages. Ordinary people wouldn't find the Shell King in just a few days. With my Spirit-Seeking Paper Cranes and compass, I'll definitely track that thief down!"

After cursing a few more times, Lan Tianlu sorted through his thoughts, and his mood gradually improved.

"Go!"

He flung dozens of green paper cranes from his sleeve. These cranes were lifelike and vivid—unaffected by water, unburned by fire, and incredibly fast, capable of covering hundreds of miles in half a day.

They were the perfect tool for tracking enemies.

"If only I had that thief's hair, I could find him in moments," Lan Tianlu muttered regretfully before retrieving a golden compass from his robes.

"At least my father left me this Shell-Seeking Compass, giving me an advantage!"

He caressed the slightly tarnished compass, his eyes filled with nostalgia.

---

Internal strife among noble families was brutal. Those outside the core lineage often lived in hardship.

The thought deepened his resentment toward his second uncle.

"First, kill that thief. Then, nurture the Star Spirit. Sooner or later, I'll surpass Second Uncle!"

"I'll make him regret everything!"

"Who cares about the so-called 'Lan Family Prodigy'? I am the true prodigy of the Lan family!"

As he manipulated the compass, ambition swelled in his heart.

"Hmm?"

Suddenly, his expression shifted.

"Why isn't the compass moving?"

"Has it lost its spiritual energy over time?"

The golden compass trembled faintly before freezing in place, as though its spiritual power had dissipated.

Anxious, Lan Tianlu channeled more spiritual energy, forcing the compass to react.

"Whirr—"

Perhaps due to the increased energy, the compass finally stirred. The golden spoon wobbled lazily in a circle before hesitantly pointing in one direction.

Then, as if uncertain, it shifted slightly, indicating another direction before stopping completely.

"Huh?"

"Has it really lost its power?"

Doubt flickered across his face.

He had meticulously planned his revenge and envisioned a glorious future.

Yet the very first step of his plan had already hit a snag.

"But it did point somewhere. It can't be completely broken, right?"

After testing it repeatedly, the compass's spiritual patterns remained intact, showing no signs of damage.

"Let's check it out!"

Resolved, Lan Tianlu activated a blue lightning seal and sped toward one of the directions deep within the cavern.

Meanwhile, in a secluded corner of the Water Caverns, Gu Yuan sat cross-legged, refining a shell jade.

The area was devoid of any shell pearls—and thus any guarding beasts—making it an ideal spot for undisturbed cultivation.

His spiritual energy surged like a raging river. With each breath, his power multiplied. In mere moments, his energy reserves had increased by ten percent.

Everything was proceeding smoothly.

As for the Shell-Seeking Compass, no matter how powerful, it couldn't locate a Shell King's jade pearl that had already been consumed and refined. The only thing it could possibly detect was...

---

"Boom!"

"Brother Yang, hold on! If we kill the last two Face-Spiders, not only will we survive, but we might even get the Shell King!"

By the time Lan Tianlu arrived at the compass's indicated location, a fierce battle was nearing its end.

Two ragged, exhausted cultivators desperately fought the remaining two Emerald Face-Spiders.

Beneath their feet lay over a dozen corpses—Red-Tailed Apes and two other cultivators.

The scene was gruesome.

"So many Face-Spiders and Red-Tailed Apes guarding the Shell King!"

"And these Hidden Dragon Academy commoners actually found it in just an hour? Unbelievable luck!"

Lan Tianlu was both shocked and delighted.

Shocked by the formidable defenses around the Shell King, yet delighted at the prospect of reaping the rewards of others' struggles.

"Before dealing with that thief, I'll take some minor spoils first!"

Qi Refinement disciples had no life tokens, and outside the academy, battles—even fratricidal ones—were unregulated. As long as no one witnessed it, killing fellow disciples carried no consequences.

Thus, the "darkness" in a cultivator's heart often grew unchecked.

Every year, Qi Refinement disciples perished at the hands of their peers.

The academy was aware but did nothing to stop it.

Perhaps learning to avoid ambushes was part of the trial.

"Blame your own bad luck!"

Seizing the moment when the battle reached its climax, Lan Tianlu struck without hesitation.

Lightning-fast, his attack shattered the weakest points of Yang Yue and the other cultivator's dantians, crippling them instantly.

Then, his spear shot forth like a dragon, its overwhelming force obliterating the two Emerald Face-Spiders and ending the "brutal yet pitiable" battle.

"Finally!"

Lan Tianlu exhaled deeply, as though releasing days of pent-up frustration.

After looting the battlefield, he hurried toward the Shell King's lair.

But the moment he stepped inside, his face stiffened.

On the stone platform, the massive Shell King lay with its shell shamelessly open, revealing empty flesh.

The jade pearl was gone—vanished without a trace.

"Damn it all!"

"Who?!"

"Who stole my Shell King's jade pearl?!"

Fury erupted within him. He slammed the stone platform, unleashing his rage.

"Boom!"

Empowered by the Star Spirit, his strike shattered the platform, exposing a strange passageway.

Unlike the horizontal tunnels of the Water Caverns, this one descended sharply, leading to a hidden location in the sixth layer of the Shell Field.

"Hmm?"

Staring into the pitch-black abyss, an ecstatic thought flashed through Lan Tianlu's mind.

"Could this be... another fortuitous encounter?"

"Just like the White Worm Frost Prison?"
