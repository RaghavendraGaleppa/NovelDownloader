**Chapter 100: Earth Spirit Crystal**

During this period of time with Chu Ning, Ling Xiaobai's ability to understand and communicate through spiritual sense had greatly improved. From Ling Xiaobai’s intermittent messages, Chu Ning finally got the gist of it. Ling Xiaobai said that when it came out of the mountains a few days ago, it was chased all the way by these two demonic beasts. So, upon seeing Chu Ning’s breakthrough in strength, it invited him to help it get revenge. The little creature added that there was an even more powerful “big fellow,” and suggested they go find it after both Chu Ning and it had grown stronger.

Chu Ning, who had just been squatting next to the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's corpse, blinked a few times after hearing these words. He then asked Ling Xiaobai, "Did you run out of the Qingxia Mountain Range? Which part?" Ling Xiaobai chirped twice, generally confirming Chu Ning’s guess, but the exact location remained unclear to the little creature. At this moment, Chu Ning finally confirmed that the previous beast horde was indeed related to this little creature. The powerful "big fellow" Ling Xiaobai mentioned was very likely the Foundation Establishment stage demonic beast that Lin Changqing had spoken of. This further cemented Chu Ning’s judgment that Ling Xiaobai's origins were indeed extraordinary.

Chu Ning stopped asking questions for now, confident he would figure it out later. He resumed examining the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's corpse before him. This type of high-grade First Rank demonic beast had not yet formed a demonic core; its valuable parts were limited to certain body sections. The most valuable part of the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape was undoubtedly its horn, followed by its highly defensive hide. However, when his gaze fell upon the horn, he slightly frowned. Blood-Spotted Unicorndapes were known for their thick hide and tough flesh, making them difficult to extract. This was evident from the fact that his spells earlier had inflicted little external damage on the beast.

Thinking this, Chu Ning first tried to cut it with his spells. However, neither the Blade Edge Art nor the Verdant Wood Sword Manual could sever the horn from the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's head. Frowning, he looked at his storage bag. He did have a few magic tools in there, such as the slender thorn from the effeminate young man and the short spear from the yellow-faced man, but none of them looked particularly sharp. As expected, Chu Ning tried them out, but they were all ineffective.

Finally, his attention fell on Old Man Sun's black dagger, which he then took out from his storage bag. Chu Ning hadn't touched these items since he put them in his storage bag last time. As he pulled out the black dagger, he couldn't help but let out a surprised "Oh?" To his astonishment, the dagger, which had previously lost its spiritual essence, had now returned to normal. The moment Chu Ning held it, he could feel its high grade and sense spiritual power flowing through it.

"Could it be that after being left for a while, this black dagger can be used again?" Thinking this, Chu Ning tried to gather spiritual power in his hand and infuse it into the black dagger. Unlike last time, the dagger now allowed spiritual power to flow in easily the moment Chu Ning's spiritual power touched it. Immediately, the black dagger began to tremble slightly, emitting a humming sound, as if it was about to fly out at any moment. Chu Ning quickly withdrew his spiritual power, and the black dagger instantly returned to normal.

"It truly is so," Chu Ning thought, pleased. He had clearly felt that if he continued to inject spiritual power, he could fully activate the dagger. Moreover, the black dagger gave him a feeling of immense destructive power, though it also required a considerable amount of spiritual power. "It seems this is indeed an exotic treasure, but it has significant limitations in its use, whether due to damage or some other reason. No wonder Old Man Sun never used it back then."

Chu Ning held the black dagger and tried to cut the base of the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's horn. To his surprise, it effortlessly sliced the horn off the unicorndape’s head. "This dagger is incredibly sharp!" Chu Ning held the unicorndape's horn in one hand and the black dagger in the other, feeling overjoyed. He made a direct cut across the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's body, and a blood-red mark immediately appeared, followed by that section of hide being torn open. Without using any spiritual power, the black dagger could easily cut through the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's hide, which made Chu Ning marvel. If activated with spiritual power to attack a target, its destructive power would indeed be formidable.

Chu Ning put the Blood-Spotted Unicorndape's horn into his storage bag. Then, he peeled off the complete beast hide. The freshly peeled hide looked somewhat gruesome, but it wasn't a big problem. Chu Ning cast a Cleansing Art, and the hide became perfectly clean. After storing the hide in his storage bag, Chu Ning went to the corpse of the female Blood-Spotted Unicorndape. He repeated the process, cutting off its horn and stripping off its hide, which he also stored in his storage bag.

At this point, Chu Ning looked at the two demonic beasts’ cave. After a moment's thought, he used his spiritual sense to scan the interior and, finding no other demonic beasts, he gestured to Ling Xiaobai and entered. Since both Blood-Spotted Unicorndapes had been killed and nothing else had emerged, entering the cave was likely safe. However, he had never actually seen a demonic beast’s cave before.

Upon entering, a strong, fishy smell unique to demonic beasts assailed him. Chu Ning frowned slightly and glared at Ling Xiaobai, saying, "You can't be this smelly in the future, or you won't be allowed to stay with me." Ling Xiaobai whimpered an aggrieved "Ying," which seemed to mean it wouldn't be like them. Chu Ning looked around and indeed found no other demonic beasts inside. However, the cave was littered with the skeletal remains of many low-grade First Rank demonic beasts. Chu Ning even saw the remains of one or two mid-grade First Rank demonic beasts. Among them, there were quite a few demonic beast materials that could be directly sold, such as Iron-Armored Ox horns and Wild Spirit Pig tusks. Although these materials were not very valuable, Chu Ning didn't mind the small gains and simply collected everything he could sell. Anyway, his storage bag was large enough now, and there was no reason not to take advantage of such an easy way to earn spirit stones.

Chu Ning also noticed that the spiritual energy inside the cave seemed quite good. After a moment's thought, he continued to pick up items while simultaneously releasing his spiritual sense to scan more carefully, hoping to find other good things. Before long, his gaze fell on a spot that was clearly where the two demonic beasts usually rested. He cast a Clearing Art, sweeping away the debris on the surface. Immediately, a fist-sized yellow crystal was revealed. Chu Ning walked over and instantly felt the rich spiritual energy contained within it. He examined it for a while, then suddenly realized something and excitedly crouched down.

"Is this an Earth Spirit Crystal?"

So-called spirit crystals were actually similar to spirit stones; both were formed by the long-term condensation and fossilization of spiritual energy. However, the spirit stones cultivators usually used had no specific attribute. Spirit crystals, on the other hand, referred to spirit stones that contained pure, attribute-specific spiritual energy. For example, an Earth Spirit Crystal contained pure earth-attribute spiritual energy. For cultivators practicing earth-attribute cultivation techniques, absorbing spiritual energy from such crystals was far more effective than from ordinary spirit stones. Furthermore, some special earth-attribute magic tools also required them, making them very popular in the market. Chu Ning didn't know the exact value of such an Earth Spirit Crystal, but he assumed it wouldn't be low.

Chu Ning once again took out the black dagger and carefully dug out the spirit crystal from the ground. When he fully excavated it, the smile on his face grew even wider. Earlier, he had only seen a fist-sized portion of the Earth Spirit Crystal exposed on the surface. But as he dug deeper, he discovered that the crystal was actually elongated. The fist-sized Earth Spirit Crystal was nearly eight inches long. "No wonder these two earth-attribute demonic beasts chose this place as their lair. It turns out there's such a large Earth Spirit Crystal here. It seems the earth spiritual energy here is relatively denser." Chu Ning smiled as he directly put the Earth Spirit Crystal into his storage bag. After another thorough search of the cave, confirming nothing was left behind, Chu Ning finally exited the beast lair.

He called Ling Xiaobai, mounted his Wind-Chasing Shuttle, and flew back the way they came. "Xiaobai, once I become stronger, you can take me to the place you came from," Chu Ning said with a smile to Ling Xiaobai in the air. "Ying!" was Ling Xiaobai's reply. It seemed the little creature was also quite excited.

The Wind-Chasing Shuttle flew all the way out of the mountains. Chu Ning didn't return directly to the market town but landed at his spiritual field. Inside the spiritual field, Chu Ning cast the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art on all the Golden Yuan Fruits. After observing the growth of the Golden Yuan Fruits, Chu Ning smiled. "In about half a month, the Golden Yuan Fruits will be ripe. At that time, they might even believe me if I said I planted twenty mu worth." Although he had only planted ten mu of Golden Yuan Fruits, his yield might not be inferior to someone who planted twenty mu. The Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art, wielded by his Verdant Wood Spirit Body, truly provided significant help to these spiritual plants; he didn't even need Ling Xiaobai to hasten their ripening. The adjacent ten mu of spiritual field, no longer needed for Purple Crystal Bamboo, remained temporarily empty. Leaving the Golden Yuan Fruits to grow slowly under the effect of the Verdant Wood Spring Bloom Art, Chu Ning then flew directly back to the market town.

Upon arriving at the market town, as Chu Ning was about to enter his door, Gu Xiaoqing, from the opposite door, seemed to hear the movement. She walked to her door and called out to him. "Junior Brother Chu, you're back. Deacon Lin just came to collect the quota from us. You weren't here, so he asked me to inform you that he's currently selecting disciples from various immortal cultivation families. He'll be back tomorrow morning."

"Selecting disciples from immortal cultivation families?" Chu Ning asked Gu Xiaoqing, immediately curious. "Senior Sister Gu, what kind of selection process is it for these immortal cultivation family disciples to enter the sect?" Chu Ning was genuinely curious about this. He had previously entered through the selection from a mortal city and didn't know much about how disciples from cultivation families affiliated with the Qingxi Sect joined the sect.

Gu Xiaoqing smiled and began to explain. "Actually, the selection within immortal cultivation families is similar to the sect's selection of mortals. It's essentially the sect arranging deacons or elders to go to the families to test spiritual root talent. Then, based on the talent level, they are assigned to different places." She continued, "Of course, there are some differences too…"

As Gu Xiaoqing explained, Chu Ning finally gained a general understanding. For the various immortal cultivation families affiliated with the sect, the sect had assigned deacons from the External Affairs Hall to maintain contact. So, under normal circumstances, they wouldn't conduct large-scale selections. These deacons would usually assess aptitude and bone structure when visiting cultivation families, and if they found excellent prospects, they would directly bring them back to the sect. As for family juniors with quad-spirit roots or quint-spirit roots, they generally weren't brought into the sect. After all, they could still cultivate within their families and handle duties like spiritual plant cultivation.

"If that's the case, then why is Deacon Lin specifically conducting a selection this time?" Chu Ning asked, somewhat puzzled. Gu Xiaoqing also looked a bit confused as she replied, "I'm not entirely sure either, but I did hear Senior Brother Du mention something the other day. This selection seems different. This time, the disciples selected from the various immortal cultivation families are all at Qi Condensation stage six, or Qi Condensation stage five with the potential to reach Qi Condensation stage six. It doesn't seem to depend on spiritual root aptitude; as long as they reach this cultivation level, they can be brought into the sect for cultivation."

Qi Condensation stage six again? Chu Ning’s eyes flickered upon hearing this. What exactly did the sect need so many disciples at Qi Condensation stage six or above for? Was it related to that secret mission again?

Or were they trying to fill vacancies within the sect? Thinking this, Chu Ning didn't ask Gu Xiaoqing further, as she probably wasn't entirely clear herself. He might be able to gather some information from Lin Changqing. Over the past few months, as Chu Ning occasionally offered spirit stones or talismans, his relationship with Lin Changqing had grown closer. While not as familiar as he once was with Zhuang Yunde, the stoic deacon treated Chu Ning quite well.

However, thinking of Zhuang Yunde, Chu Ning recalled that the service disciple from District Ding had left for some secret mission several months ago, and he wondered about his situation. Perhaps he could try asking Lin Changqing about it tomorrow.

Early the next morning, shortly after Chu Ning opened his door, Lin Changqing indeed arrived. Chu Ning presented the spirit stones he had prepared long ago; besides the 500 he was to hand over to the sect, he gave an additional 30 spirit stones to Lin Changqing. Seeing the two piles of spirit stones, a hint of warmth softened Lin Changqing's stern face. Instead of taking all the spirit stones directly, he took 40 spirit stones from the 500 and handed them back to Chu Ning. "Recently, fewer people have been coming out from the various families, so there aren't many people in this market town. Your cultivation is low, so let's give you a small discount on these spirit stones."

Chu Ning took back the 40 spirit stones and thanked him profusely. Then, remembering what Gu Xiaoqing had said yesterday, he asked with some curiosity, "Deacon Lin, I heard that the sect is currently recruiting a large number of disciples from cultivation families. What's the reason for this?"

Lin Changqing glanced at Chu Ning, pondered for a moment, and then replied, "It's still due to the previous sect mission. This time, the sect dispatched too many people, and after several months, it was found that many areas were not functioning smoothly. That's why the sect decided to select some Qi Condensation disciples from the cultivation families to join the sect." He paused, then continued, "It's not just cultivation families; the sect also plans to adjust the mortal selection to once every two years. Well, none of this has much to do with you. Since you've been assigned here to the market town and can submit the monthly quota on time, the sect won't assign anyone else."

Chu Ning nodded, then pretended to ask casually, "Deacon Lin, when I was in District Ding, I received a lot of care from a Senior Brother named Zhuang Yunde. He mentioned he would come to see me after participating in a sect mission. I wonder if he has returned."

"Junior Nephew Zhuang? I do know him. He went to participate in a sect mission…" At this, Lin Changqing shook his head. "Most likely, he hasn't returned. Usually, even if they do return, it takes one or two years, some even ten years. But if he returns, he'll become an inner sect disciple, and it might not be as convenient for him to visit you."

Chu Ning wanted to speak further, but Lin Changqing waved his hand, saying, "I know you want to ask about the sect's mission, but you're truly asking the wrong person. Even we deacons aren't privy to such matters. Probably only the elders and the Sect Master know. Even if you ask me, I can't answer." Lin Changqing finished speaking and left in a hurry.

Chu Ning shook his head. He hadn't expected that even a Foundation Establishment deacon like Lin Changqing wouldn't know about the sect's mission. He wondered why the sect was keeping it such a tight secret. It was probably better for him to inquire less about it.

In the following days, Chu Ning cultivated steadily. He continuously strengthened his tendons by practicing the Nine Evolutions Body Tempering Art while consolidating his Qi Condensation stage seven cultivation. Of course, he didn't neglect his Spirit Refining Art. At the same time, he intensified his efforts in nurturing the Golden Yuan Fruits in his spiritual field. After all, the spiritual plants were nearing harvest. He was also contemplating whether to make a trip to Fengxia Market.

In fact, Chu Ning had wanted to go to Fengxia Market more than once. The main reason was that almost no one bought high-grade pills in Yanji Market, so Gu Xiaoqing only had the Essence Gathering Pill available for cultivation enhancement. While the Essence Gathering Pill still had an effect on Chu Ning's current late-stage Qi Condensation cultivation, it was no longer as significant as it had been during the mid-stage. Ideally, he needed a high-grade low-tier pill suitable for late-stage Qi Condensation to accelerate his cultivation. Additionally, after experiencing the effects of body tempering last time, Chu Ning wanted to see if there were any body-tempering items for sale. Although the Iron Stem Orchids he planted had already grown Iron Orchid Fruits, they were still one or two months away from full ripeness.

Previously, he couldn't make the trip because he had to go to the cave daily to use the Earth Spirit Spring Water for body tempering. Now that the Golden Yuan Fruits were almost ripe, Chu Ning thought it wouldn't be too late to go after they were harvested.

During this period, something slightly unexpected happened to Chu Ning. Ling Xiaobai, the little creature, silently advanced to become a high-grade First Rank demonic beast. What made Chu Ning feel particularly incredible was that Ling Xiaobai was simply sleeping in the courtyard that day while Chu Ning was cultivating the Verdant Wood Evergreen Art. However, after Chu Ning finished cultivating, he discovered that Ling Xiaobai had already advanced from a mid-grade First Rank to a high-grade First Rank. The fact that its cultivation could advance just by sleeping made Chu Ning sigh inwardly, feeling that Ling Xiaobai had an even bigger "cheat" than his own.
