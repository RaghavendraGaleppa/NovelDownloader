Chapter 53: Li, the Benevolent, Mo? Cui Peng Appears, Stuttering Sister

The next day, Li Mo woke up early to find the Murong mansion bustling with activity. Servants and maids were scurrying about, and Murong Hai, the patriarch, was personally overseeing the commotion.

"Li Xiaoyou, you're awake," Murong Hai said, turning around with a face that showed no signs of the previous night's intoxication. "I've arranged for grain from the Hengtong Trading House to be delivered today, and we'll set up the charity hall."

"Thank you for your trouble," Li Mo said, taking out a silver ticket from his sleeve. "Since we're following the family precept to do good, we shouldn't be generous with others' money. I hope you won't decline."

Murong Hai nodded, calling out to a passing steward. "Go fetch Xiao'er to help. And send someone to announce it to the city... Ah, let Xiao'er do it."

As the day went on, a figure appeared on the streets of Ziyang City, beating a gong and drawing attention from passersby. "Qingyuan Sect's Li Zhenchuan has come down the mountain to distribute alms! Refugees, come and receive porridge and rice at the Murong mansion!"

Muyong Xiao's booming voice echoed through the streets, his face red with excitement. Li Mo had not intended to seek fame, but Murong Xiao was eager to broadcast his kindness to the world.

In a nearby teahouse, people were discussing Li Mo's actions. "Isn't he the Qingyuan Sect's true disciple who obtained the Xuanbing?" someone asked. "Maybe he's on a sect mission to aid the refugees?"

Outside, a ragged beggar watched Murong Xiao's retreating figure with a calculating gaze. Cui Peng's eyes gleamed with malice beneath his dirty hair. "Qingyuan Sect... Li Zhenchuan. Setting up a soup kitchen, specifically for refugees and beggars... Could it be that my whereabouts have been leaked?"

Cui Peng's thoughts swirled with killing intent. He had been careful to conceal his identity, but it seemed that Li Mo was onto him. He decided to join the Xiyu Lou, a secret organization of assassins, and saw Li Mo's head as a potential offering to gain entry.

Meanwhile, at the Murong mansion, a long line of people had formed outside the charity hall. Li Mo was busy distributing food and using his Tianming Shenyan (Divine Eye of Fate) to scan the crowd.

As he handed out a bag of rice to a beggar, Li Mo said, "You should return home. It's better to humble yourself before your family than to struggle for survival on the streets." The beggar's hand trembled as he took the rice, and he thanked Li Mo.

Li Mo asked, "Have you seen a beggar with a scar on his chest, bright eyes, and a stutter?" The beggar shook his head and left.

A young beggar, about seven or eight years old, approached Li Mo, his eyes wide with gratitude. As Li Mo handed him a bag of rice, he noticed a small claw mark on the boy's clothes. The boy seemed prepared to be scolded, but Li Mo just smiled and said, "It's okay, I'll wash it later."

The boy's information appeared in Li Mo's Tianming Shenyan: Meng Can, a 7-year-old with a black fate, indicating a life of hardship. Li Mo's inquiry about the stuttering beggar was met with a surprising response: "You know Stuttering Sister?"

Li Mo's curiosity was piqued, but the boy suddenly covered his mouth, looking panicked, and ran into the crowd. Li Mo's Tianming Shenyan revealed that Meng Can had encountered Cui Peng, who had marked Li Mo, and was now in danger of being silenced.
