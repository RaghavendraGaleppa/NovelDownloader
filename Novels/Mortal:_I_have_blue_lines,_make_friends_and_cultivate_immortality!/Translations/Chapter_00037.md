# Chapter 37: Free Talismans? The Fainting Talisman Elder!

On the way to Thundercliff Ridge, the two young brothers who had bought talismans from Lin Yun's stall earlier were humming his catchy advertisement jingle.

"Yue Country~ Jianzhou!! Yue Country~ Jianzhou!"

"The Yellow Maple Valley Talisman Hall~ has gone bankrupt!"

"The largest talisman hall in Yue Country's Jianzhou~ has collapsed!"

"That bastard! That bastard! The hall master~ Old Fu gambled and whored~ racking up 350 million spirit stones in debt, then ran off with his sister-in-law~!"

"What nonsense are you spouting!" A beautiful woman in blue robes suddenly appeared and scolded them sternly. "How can you spread such rumors about the Yellow Maple Valley Talisman Hall?"

"Senior Sister Nie!" The brothers trembled upon seeing the intimidating woman.

The stunning blue-robed woman was none other than Nie Ying, who had come to fetch the brothers. They were twin brothers from the Murong family, a minor clan under Yellow Maple Valley's jurisdiction, both possessing rare lightning spiritual roots known for their destructive power.

The appearance of these twins had attracted the attention of the sect's higher-ups. Even Lei Wanhe, who had been in seclusion, emerged to examine their talents. After assessing their potential, he publicly declared that he would personally take them as disciples once they achieved Foundation Establishment.

"Senior Sister, we're not lying," the Murong brothers explained. "That's what Senior Brother Lin said at his stall. He called it 'advertising.' They say Senior Brother Lin is some kind of deputy hall master of the Talisman Hall."

"Senior Brother Lin? Deputy hall master?" Nie Ying's expression softened at the familiar name. "Is this Senior Brother Lin extremely handsome, named Lin Yun?"

"Yes," the brothers nodded.

Nie Ying's face brightened at the news. Since their last meeting, Lin Yun's whereabouts had become a mystery.

"By the way, what was Senior Brother Lin doing there?" Nie Ying asked curiously.

"Giving away talismans for free! He said it was for the benefit of everyone in Yellow Maple Valley."

"What?!" Nie Ying was stunned. "Giving away talismans for free?!"

"Indeed! And they're high-grade primary talismans!" One of the brothers handed Nie Ying a Three Lightning Talisman they had received. "See, Senior Sister Nie? This is what Senior Brother Lin gave us."

"Though not everyone gets one," the other brother added. "Each person only gets one chance, and one talisman is given for every eleven people to distribute among themselves."

Nie Ying nodded in understanding. If Lin Yun were truly giving away high-grade primary talismans to everyone, the cost would be astronomical—over ten thousand talismans for Yellow Maple Valley's disciples would amount to nearly a million spirit stones! Even her wealthy Nie family couldn't afford such extravagance.

But even distributing one talisman per eleven people meant over a thousand high-grade primary talismans—worth around a hundred thousand spirit stones.

"Are they really free?" Nie Ying couldn't believe it.

"Yes! Many people have already received them. Senior Brother Lin has given away dozens today and said he'll continue tomorrow until everyone in Yellow Maple Valley has had a chance. You can ask anyone—it's common knowledge now."

Nie Ying was deeply moved. "Junior Brother Lin... How could there be someone so selflessly generous in this world? A thousand high-grade primary talismans... You're exactly the kind of person Yellow Maple Valley needs! Why would anyone sacrifice so much for others?"

If Lin Yun's earlier defense of Han Li had earned Nie Ying's respect, now she was genuinely intrigued by his character. She wanted to understand why he would give away such valuable talismans. Didn't it pain him? Didn't he have any self-interest as a cultivator?

"Junior Brother Lin... why?" she wondered silently.

As disciples who received talismans from Lin Yun's stall returned to their residences, news of his generosity spread like wildfire through Yellow Maple Valley. Beyond the allure of free high-grade talismans, no one had ever seen such selfless behavior—not even free talisman paper was commonly given away. Everyone planned to visit Lin Yun's stall the next day to see for themselves.

Meanwhile, back at the Talisman Hall...

The talisman masters were casting strange looks at Old Fu.

"I thought Old Fu ran away?"

"Me too!"

"I heard he owed over 350 million spirit stones. Why is he back?"

"Hey! Why are you all staring at me instead of working?!" Old Fu bellowed.

Though the talisman masters returned to their tasks, some still stole glances at him.

"Hmm? Do I have something on my face?" Old Fu muttered, pulling out a mirror to check. "No... Still as handsome as ever, full of mature charm!"

"You there!" He pointed at one disciple. "Tell me! What's everyone looking at?"

"Elder Fu... has our Talisman Hall gone bankrupt?" the disciple asked hesitantly.

"Bankrupt? What nonsense! Who's spreading these rumors?" Old Fu roared.

"What other rumors? Out with it!"

"Elder Fu... didn't you run off with your sister-in-law after owing 350 million spirit stones? Why did you come back?" another disciple asked curiously.

Old Fu nearly choked on his own breath.

"WHO SAID THAT?!"

"Deputy Hall Master Lin!" the disciples chorused.

"Deputy Hall Master Lin said our hall went bankrupt, that you ran off with your sister-in-law, and now he's giving away high-grade primary talismans for free outside!"

Old Fu's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull. In all his years, he had never been so shocked. Was he going mad, or had the world gone insane? Free high-grade primary talismans?!

"Elder Fu, it's true. The whole valley knows by now."

"Here, listen." A disciple activated a sound-retaining talisman.

"Yue Country~ Jianzhou!! Yue Country~ Jianzhou!"

"The Yellow Maple Valley Talisman Hall~ has gone bankrupt!"

"That bastard! That bastard! The hall master~ Old Fu gambled and whored~ racking up 350 million spirit stones in debt, then ran off with his sister-in-law~!"

"THAT LITTLE—!" Old Fu felt his head splitting.

With a strangled cry, he collapsed to the ground.

"Elder Fu! Elder Fu!"
