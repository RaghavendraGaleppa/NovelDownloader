# Chapter 70: The Perfect Fool Who Walked Right In  

The Original Deity Temple remained as usual, with sparse worshippers and incense sales that weren't particularly thriving.  

However, the temple no longer relied on incense sales for survival. Xiao Ji had been exceptionally busy throughout the previous winter, accumulating enough silver for the temple to ensure Liu Haizhu could retire comfortably.  

Upon returning from Taigu City, Xiao Ji had brought back many things.  

For his master, he had prepared dried beast meat and nutrient-rich beast milk as snacks. The beast milk was a gift from Qian Duoyu.  

For Ying Xiao, he had brought back brushes, ink, paper, and inkstones—everything she needed to comfortably write her diary at the Original Deity Temple.  

Though Lin Musheng had only recently arrived, Xiao Ji hadn’t forgotten him. He had picked up a small gift from a street vendor—a copy of *Wildfire Spreads the Plains Sword Technique*.  

This technique wasn’t some heaven-tier martial art, but for Lin Musheng’s revenge, it was more than sufficient.  

The sword techniques Lin Musheng had previously practiced were flawed, and since his uncle practiced the same style, if both reached the Foundation Establishment stage, Lin Musheng would be at a disadvantage in a direct confrontation—experience simply wasn’t on his side.  

Thus, to ensure his revenge was more certain, he needed a stronger sword technique.  

After returning to the temple, Xiao Ji was in high spirits. Just a few small gifts had lightened the atmosphere considerably.  

His master and Old Liu had been playing chess daily, with the master winning a few more games than usual.  

But today, the master had returned early, looking rather melancholic.  

"Master, did you lose at chess?" Xiao Ji asked with concern.  

The master shook his head and sighed without speaking.  

Finally, after Xiao Ji pressed him, he spoke: "Old Liu is gone. I’ve lost a worthy opponent. I feel... lonely."  

Fate was unpredictable, and mortals all had their ends.  

Just then, Ying Xiao walked over and, upon hearing Liu Haizhu’s words, said, "So, does that mean you’ll have to attend a funeral feast?"  

Xiao Ji shot her a sharp look. This girl had no filter—how could she say something like that so carelessly?  

"Yes, and he didn’t even invite me for a meal when he moved away," the master replied, even more dejected.  

Oh... *that* kind of "gone." Ying Xiao realized her mistake and quickly changed the subject. "Master, how about I play chess with you from now on? I used to play with my father all the time—I’m not bad."  

"No, your skills are terrible," Liu Haizhu said bluntly. "A new old man named Zhang just moved into town. I’ve already challenged him to a match."  

Xiao Ji had no intention of getting involved in his master’s daily affairs—that would only lead to trouble.  

Instead, he headed to the backyard and found Lin Musheng in his room, studying the new sword technique.  

"How is it? Does the technique suit you?"  

"It’s quite profound," Lin Musheng said. "But it does fit my fire spiritual root. The only problem is... this technique seems to require a lot of space to practice."  

*Wildfire Spreads the Plains Sword Technique* appeared weak at first glance, but once unleashed, the opponent would suffer increasing agony, quickly engulfed in sword flames.  

Just from the name, it was clear this was a technique meant for grand displays.  

Xiao Ji pulled up a chair and took the manual to examine it. He had already studied it thoroughly—it was precisely because it suited Lin Musheng that he had picked it up.  

"You haven’t grasped the essence of this technique," Xiao Ji said. "What you see is only the surface. The true focus of this sword art is the *Heart Sword*."  

"Heart Sword?" Lin Musheng was puzzled.  

"Exactly, the Heart Sword," Xiao Ji continued. "This means you don’t need a large space to practice. You cultivate it in your mind, refining the sword with the fire of your heart—that’s the core of this technique. Once your Heart Sword is complete, that scrap metal in your hand can be sold to a blacksmith."  

This was beyond Lin Musheng’s understanding.  

But under Xiao Ji’s guidance, he gradually comprehended the manual’s contents and began to form a faint, blurry sword in his mind.  

It was like a sapling—it needed constant nurturing to grow.  

"Daoist Xiao, I see it," Lin Musheng said, sitting in meditation with his eyes closed. "The outline of the sword has appeared in my heart."  

"Excellent. In the coming days, focus on refining the Heart Sword. Once it takes shape, you can unleash its wildfire across the wilderness of your mind."  

Leaving Lin Musheng’s room, Xiao Ji stood in the backyard, pondering what to have for dinner.  

Suddenly, he sensed someone entering the Original Deity Temple—someone suspicious.  

**[Wang Dafeng, the Hooked-Blade King—the most ruthless assassin under Lin San of Lin Family Fort. Lin San, having lost track of Lin Musheng, sent him to investigate the last place Lin Musheng was seen: Willow Town’s Original Deity Temple.]**  

"He’s here already?" Xiao Ji thought. "If I kill this man, Lin San will lose all traces of Lin Musheng."

### Original Deity Temple, Front Courtyard  

After surveying the courtyard, Wang Dafeng strode into the main hall, where he saw a young Daoist sitting on a meditation cushion.  

He had been sent by his master, Lin San, to search for a person in Longxiang County.  

Wang Dafeng had been involved in the upheaval at Lin Family Fort from the very beginning—he had even participated in the assassination of the fort’s lord and had been severely injured that day.  

Some time ago, one of Lin San’s swordsmen had located Lin Musheng and, before dying, sent a message via a black crow. Coincidentally, Wang Dafeng had just recovered from his injuries, so Lin San dispatched him. That was how he had ended up here.  

Lin San was currently preoccupied with breaking through to the Foundation Establishment stage and had delegated all matters to his subordinates.  

As the most vicious assassin under Lin San’s command, Wang Dafeng wouldn’t miss this opportunity to distinguish himself—though no one knew his true intentions.  

Lin San had betrayed his own brother, the fort’s lord, all for the sake of that *pipa lute head*—a treasure of immense value.  

Thus, once he killed the fugitive Lin Musheng and obtained the treasure, Wang Dafeng planned to take it and vanish—far away, to lands beyond the sea.  

"Would you like to offer incense, kind sir?" Xiao Ji asked amiably.  

"No," Wang Dafeng sneered. He had nothing but disdain for temples and monasteries in ordinary towns. "I’m here to find someone."  

He pulled out a portrait from his robe—the face on it was unmistakably Lin Musheng’s.  

Xiao Ji glanced at it but said nothing.  

"Have you seen this man?" Wang Dafeng’s gaze was cold. "I suggest you tell me the truth."  

Unfazed by the hostility, Xiao Ji replied calmly, "Yes. He was injured and stayed here to recover."  

"Where is he now?" Wang Dafeng pressed, his tone threatening—as if he would draw his blade if the Daoist refused to answer.  

"Outside the city, in a desolate mountain," Xiao Ji said. "He paid me for some help... Since you seem acquainted, if you wish to see him, you can go there tomorrow. I’ll give you the exact location."  

Wang Dafeng stared at Xiao Ji, growing increasingly irritated. The Daoist clearly knew where Lin Musheng was but was playing coy.  

Still, this was a town—killing someone outright would be troublesome. He suppressed his anger.  

Xiao Ji had the same thought.  

*No need to rush. Just wait one more day...*  

"Fine," Wang Dafeng said through gritted teeth. "Give me the address. Tomorrow, I *will* see him. His family is *very* eager to reunite with him."
