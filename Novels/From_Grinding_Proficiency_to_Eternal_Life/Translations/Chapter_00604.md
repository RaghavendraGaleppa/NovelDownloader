# Chapter 604: Audacity is the Standard Operating Procedure of the Primordial Origin Sect

Lu Chuan arrived at just the right moment.

Seeing how reasonable Lu Chuan was being, Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed slightly, though his face maintained an air of respect.

"Thank you for your understanding, Senior Brother."

Xu Yunfan then cupped his fists toward the Nine Immortal Mountain high in the heavens.

"My thanks also to the True Lord for his grace."

This sycophant is even better at bootlicking than I am.

Lu Chuan cursed inwardly, but he nodded slightly on the surface before his expression shifted, his gaze landing on Xu Yunfan's face.

"Since you've emerged from seclusion, your foundation is solid and your aura refined. This is somewhat surprising to me. It seems the gains from the Heavenly Realm have been of immense help."

He didn't directly point out that Xu Yunfan had already reached the late Foundation Establishment stage, but his scrutinizing gaze and slightly surprised tone made it abundantly clear.

How long has it been since Xu Yunfan was at mid Foundation Establishment?

To condense a proto-heaven and break through to late Foundation Establishment, Lu Chuan had to cycle through an entire lifetime, exhausting all his resources just to transform his Dao Foundation into a proto-heaven.

This bastard actually got a huge advantage in the Heavenly Realm.

Lu Chuan couldn't help but feel a pang of jealousy. If he had known, he would have gone himself.

He shifted the topic again, getting straight to the point.

"I called you here today because there is indeed a matter at hand. The True Lord's decree has been issued: there is a crucial task this time, and you have been specifically designated to participate."

At this point, Lu Chuan couldn't help but add, "The True Lord is truly good to you this time. If this task is completed, you might just be able to successfully condense an Immortal Gold Essence and achieve full Foundation Establishment."

Upon hearing it was a True Lord's decree and seeing the envy in Lu Chuan's eyes, Xu Yunfan was almost certain this was a benefit granted to him by the Qingyuan True Lord.

However, on the surface, he showed no hesitation in displaying solemnity and obedience, saying in a deep voice, "Since it is the True Lord's decree, this disciple will naturally do his utmost and spare no effort. May I ask Senior Brother, what exactly is this task?"

Lu Chuan got straight to the point. With a tap of his finger, an invisible ripple spread from beneath his phantom's feet, completely severing the last connection between the cave dwelling and the outside world.

This was an extremely sophisticated projection of a Divine Sense shielding array.

Xu Yunfan saw this and his heart chilled slightly; he knew the matter being discussed was of great importance.

At the same time, however, a third of his attention was focused on this shielding array. In but a moment, he understood the nodes and the method to break it.

*Interesting, the array can be connected like this.*

Xu Yunfan was slightly surprised; he had learned a new trick.

"Xu Shidi."

"Senior Brother, please speak," Xu Yunfan said deeply, his attention fully focused.

"A few days ago, we happened to intercept a piece of important information," Lu Chuan's phantom said with sharp eyes. "It came from a female sword cultivator surnamed Ye of the Tianji Peak of the Wansheng Sword Sect."

A female sword cultivator surnamed Ye.

If she belongs to the Tianji Peak of the Wansheng Sword Sect, then based on the intelligence gathered by his clone, Han Shi, there is only one famous female sword cultivator with that surname.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly. "Tianji Peak? The direct disciple under the Xuanji Sword Soul Profound True Lord, Ye Xuan?"

The names of the seven Peak Lords of the Wansheng Sword Sect were no secret within the Primordial Origin Sect, especially the Lord of Tianji Peak, whose sword Dao was unpredictable and strange.

"Precisely."

Lu Chuan nodded. "This person is a core disciple of the Ye family and bears a heavy responsibility. Under our methods, we pried a precise coordinate of a new界天 (World Realm) from her.

This realm has not been anchored by any major sect or power; it should be a masterless land."

A new World Realm.

Xu Yunfan's heart shook.

This represented endless resources, the possible existence of先天灵根 (Heavenly Spiritual Roots), and even...

Unplundered Dao Fruits.

Especially for cultivators preparing for Golden Core verification, this was undoubtedly a heaven-sent opportunity.

He now finally understood why the Heavenly Realm always cursed the Taihua Spirit Ruins World as an Outer Realm Demon.

Invading other worlds and implementing various forms of plunder—how could that not be considered demonic?

"Does the Wansheng Sword Sect know their clues were intercepted?"

Xu Yunfan pressed; this matter was of too great a relation. A slight carelessness could trigger a great war between the two sects.

Lu Chuan and the others were truly audacious, daring to kidnap a direct disciple under a True Lord.

*Oh, these seem to be old traditions of the Primordial Origin Sect.*

*Then there's no problem.*

A smile curled up at the corner of Lu Chuan's mouth.

"They don't know yet. As for how we got the information out..."

He paused, his tone nonchalant but carrying a hint of chill.

"Our Primordial Origin Sect's foundation has millions of ways to make someone talk. Whether it's true or false has already been verified. The imprint spoken from the depths of that female sword cultivator's soul cannot be faked."

Xu Yunfan remained silent.

He naturally understood the implication behind Lu Chuan's words.

The methods of the Primordial Origin Sect, especially when dealing with disciples of other sects, involved soul searching and torture of the true spirit as a daily routine. Memories stripped away by secret techniques could indeed not be forged by illusions.

That female sword cultivator surnamed Ye was likely in a state where she couldn't live or die, reduced to something like a puppet or cauldron for some True Person in the sect.

If it were Xu Yunfan doing the interrogation, he would naturally have the other party lose themselves in ecstasy and confess the truth personally.

The *True Scripture of Heaven and Earth Interaction, Yin-Yang Separation and Union* was no joke.

"However, this World Realm is still an unknown quantity. What lies inside and what dangers exist require preliminary investigation," Lu Chuan's tone shifted. "But this kind of nascent World Realm is the easiest to孕育 (nurture) Immortal Gold Essence. For a cultivator like Shidi who urgently needs to forge a complete Golden Essence, it is a rare opportunity. The True Lord's eyes are like torches, specifically naming you to participate in this matter. This is a heaven-sent opportunity. How many Foundation Establishment True Persons have racked their brains trying to condense Immortal Gold Essence, even cycling through several lives without finding the method."

In his words, Lu Chuan couldn't help but carry a hint of jealousy.

Xu Yunfan's talent and luck were truly good.

It was a pity. He was favored by a True Lord, and the other party was both a Master of the Dao of Arrays and a late Foundation Establishment cultivator. If he couldn't take him down in one strike, the consequences would be disastrous.

Pausing for a moment to suppress the various thoughts in his heart, Lu Chuan's voice turned slightly heavy.

"There are inherent risks, of course. There might be先天神圣 (Heavenly-born Saints) nurturing within this World Realm, but their power is mostly suppressed by the realm's boundaries, making it difficult to truly compare to a Foundation Establishment cultivator from the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

As long as we plan carefully and advance step by step, with your current cultivation and magical powers, plus your attainments in the Dao of Arrays, the possibility of successfully obtaining the treasure and retreating safely is extremely high."

A new World Realm.

Immortal Gold Essence!

These two words naturally made Xu Yunfan's heart surge with emotion.

Although the Attribute Panel allowed him to proceed step by step, and even water-grinding功夫 (effort) could eventually condense Immortal Gold Essence and step into full Foundation Establishment, the *Xuanxiao Nine Chen Profound Heavens Indestructible True Scripture* was now already complete.

Its next stage required breaking through a barrier to condense the true Immortal Gold Essence capable of bearing the favor of a Dao Fruit. Given the current speed of proficiency growth on the Attribute Panel...

It would still require a considerable amount of time to accumulate.

He couldn't wait.

The Bodhisattva Pure Land's ceremony to guide the King Buddha position in the Eastern Wasteland—the impending three-way chaotic battle was the only opportunity for him to use the situation to seek the Golden Core and verify the Dao.

By then, he would have his clone, Han Shi, infiltrating the Wansheng Sword Sect to wait for an opportunity, and his clone, Wukong, who had already been lurking in the Bodhisattva Pure Land for a long time.

If he could find a piece of先天 Immortal Gold Essence in the new World Realm, completely stabilizing his Dao Foundation and stepping into the realm of full Foundation Establishment...

Then, when the ceremony begins, the Eastern Wasteland is turned upside down, and the True Lords of the three sects—or perhaps even more existences—are tied down or unable to care for themselves, he would be able to seize that fleeting opportunity and initiate the ultimate ritual to guide the *Xuanxiao Yuqing Nine Chen Profound Heavens Myriad Transformation Indestructible Dao Fruit*.
