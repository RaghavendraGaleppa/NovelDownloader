# Chapter 37: Precious Materials

Xu Yuan continued speaking:

"In my opinion, rather than chasing the elusive path of immortality—only to toil one's entire life and end up losing both wealth and life—"

"It's better to live in the present, pursuing material and spiritual abundance to improve the quality of one's life. What do you think, Master Han?"

Han Yue pondered for a moment before replying:

"I completely understand your perspective, Master Xu. However, I still harbor an unyielding spirit in my heart. Without giving it a try, I would never be satisfied. I hope you can understand."

"Hahaha, well said, Master Han! But from my merchant house's viewpoint, the path of cultivation cannot be separated from material support!"

"Even if you have higher aspirations, there's no harm in using our platform to accumulate sufficient cultivation resources."

"You could stay with our merchant house for a few transitional years—we would gladly accommodate you!"

Xu Yuan continued to persuade him.

Han Yue decided to be forthright. He took out a Beast Taming Sect token and said directly:

"To be honest, I've already obtained a Beast Taming Sect token, which grants me direct entry into their inner sect. I originally planned to resign and depart after the Dharma Assembly, but I might as well inform you in advance today."

"Moreover, I'll be preparing for my journey in the near future and won't be going out to hunt for the time being. I appreciate your understanding!"

The Beast Taming Sect token proved highly effective. The moment Han Yue produced it, Xu Yuan's attitude shifted immediately, and he ceased his attempts at persuasion.

"Very well. The Beast Taming Sect is indeed an excellent choice—a top-tier sect with formidable strength, and conveniently close to our Flesh Market. You've made a wise decision, Master Han!"

"In that case, I won't take up any more of your time. I only wish you success in achieving your aspirations!"

"Thank you, Master Xu."

With that, their meeting concluded.

After retrieving over forty thousand mid-grade spirit stones with Xiao Qing, Han Yue returned home.

Meanwhile, behind the screen in Xu Yuan's chamber, the scene was starkly different.

A massively obese man sat in a wheelchair forged from Geng Metal.

The man had snow-white hair, a bloated body, and limbs swollen to an unnatural size. His belly was as large as a millstone, rendering him unable to stand on his own. Yet, his skin was as smooth as a baby's, and his delicate facial features resembled those of a youth.

This grotesque figure was none other than Merchant House Master Xu Yuan.

His appearance was a jarring contrast to his refined voice. Had he received guests in this form, it would have been nearly impossible to gain their trust and respect.

His expression turned cold and stern after Han Yue left, and he issued a command:

"Han Yue's connection may be severed."

"Have the underlings prepare alternative plans immediately."

"Send someone to pressure Xiao Qing—she must find a way to keep Han Yue here, even if she has to offer herself."

A young girl nearby responded:

"Yes, Master."

"However, Han Yue already has the opportunity to join a prestigious sect, and he's already taken tens of thousands of spirit stones from us. There's little left we can tempt him with."

"Moreover, is it really worth going to such lengths just to increase the number of second-rank demon beasts?"

"Our merchant house has maintained its current operations for over a thousand years and has always passed down its legacy steadily."

Xu Yuan didn't conceal his motives and replied bluntly:

"Large quantities of second-rank demon beast flesh can help our merchant house establish a secret connection!"

"Through this channel, I may obtain a new longevity-extending technique!"

"As the only third-rank cultivator in the Flesh Market, prolonging my lifespan is the top priority!"

"Yes, Master!"

Had Han Yue met Xu Yuan face-to-face in this state, his impression of the merchant house master would have been drastically different.

For now, Han Yue's relationship with the merchant house remained amicable.

By promptly using the Beast Taming Sect as a shield, Han Yue hoped to avoid damaging ties with the merchant house.

After all, he still had many matters that required their assistance in the near future.

Upon returning to his room, Han Yue resumed his seclusion.

Though he and Xu Yuan hadn't reached an agreement, Han Yue still felt he had gained much from their meeting.

Through Xu Yuan's words, Han Yue glimpsed a mindset entirely different from Xiao Luo's—one focused on the present, driven by profit, and weighed by pragmatism.

Undoubtedly, this was the path chosen by the vast majority of cultivators in the world.

Yet Han Yue couldn't help but feel disappointed.

Xu Yuan controlled an entire merchant house with immense resources at his disposal, yet he lacked the conviction of a true cultivator. Instead, he resembled nothing more than a shrewd businessman—a waste, in Han Yue's eyes.

Han Yue even felt that compared to Xu Yuan, someone like Fang Yi—a penniless but ambitious young merchant—was far more deserving of his respect.

Setting aside these unproductive thoughts, Han Yue retrieved the gold-embroidered manual on precious materials and began studying it carefully.

During his year with Xiao Luo, Han Yue had acquired much foundational knowledge about the cultivation world.

One crucial aspect concerned third-rank treasures.

Third-rank materials occupied a unique and highly significant position in the cultivation world.

Below the third rank, first- and second-rank treasures were abundant but lacked profound mysteries and complete properties, making them unable to endure for long.

First-rank materials could potentially be refined and elevated to the second rank.

However, second-rank items could never be forged into third-rank ones.

Only third-rank materials could be crafted into third-rank treasures.

This distinction formed a natural barrier, completely separating third-rank materials from lower-rank items.

Compared to lower-rank items, third-rank materials possessed vastly greater power, along with sturdy and stable properties that made them difficult to destroy—qualities that allowed them to be passed down through generations.

In truth, third-rank materials represented the highest tier of naturally occurring resources.

The natural world contained no fourth-rank materials.

This was because anything that reached the fourth rank would develop its own spiritual essence and consciousness, becoming a living being rather than mere material.

Any naturally formed object that advanced to the fourth rank would develop a primordial spirit, making it no different from fourth-rank demons or cultivators.

In the cultivation world, all fourth-rank and above materials were collectively referred to as "Immortal Spirit Treasures." These treasures shared the lifespan of heaven and earth and were nearly impossible to refine.

When cultivators forged artifacts from third-rank materials, if they continuously refined and nurtured them over years, these artifacts could eventually develop a spiritual essence and ascend to the fourth rank.

Legends abounded in the cultivation world of Immortal Venerables refining their lifebound treasures to the fourth rank, thereby adding a formidable fourth-rank combatant to their sect's strength.

Thus, artifacts below the second rank were merely transitional, with limited potential.

Fourth-rank and above innate spirit treasures were beyond the reach of anyone below the Immortal Venerable realm and could be disregarded.

Only third-rank materials were the common pursuit of all cultivators.

Among the four essential elements of cultivation, the "artifact" aspect was largely defined by which third-rank material a cultivator used to forge their third-rank artifact and how thoroughly it was refined.

The unique properties of third-rank materials, combined with their scarcity, resulted in their exorbitant value and the extreme difficulty in obtaining them.
