## Chapter 23: The Stone Heavenly Book Seal, Opening Another Meridian

Inside the room.

Li Mo was soaking his feet, checking today's investment feedback.

**[Congratulations, Host, you have successfully invested in one portion of Icefire Wine and one portion of Roasted Exotic Beast Meat.]**
**[Investment Feedback: One jar of Hundred Flowers Dew Cream.]**
**[Investment Feedback: One Night-Luminous Pearl.]**

**[Hundred Flowers Dew Cream]**: "A high-grade healing medicine, made from the first drops of dew from a hundred rare flowers and exotic herbs. It contains excellent vital growth essence and has miraculous effects on external injuries."
**[Night-Luminous Pearl]**: "Produced in the North Sea, it shines eternally. An essential item for a master's cave dwelling."

…

"These rewards must be from Master."

A round, fist-sized pearl appeared in Li Mo's palm, emitting a soft glow. He had seen this item before. At the Hengtong Auction House in Ziyang Prefectural City, a Night-Luminous Pearl hung on the auction stage. Judging solely by its luster and color, it was inferior to the one in his hand.

In any case, it was quite valuable. Its actual use, however, couldn't compare to the Hundred Flowers Dew Cream. Li Mo applied a small amount to himself; it felt cool and refreshing. The minor scratches he had sustained from body tempering in the Divine Edge Cavern during the day almost instantly began to heal.

**[Congratulations, Host, you have successfully invested in one portion of Icefire Wine and one portion of Roasted Exotic Beast Meat.]**
**[Investment Feedback: Twenty years of Martial Dao comprehension.]**
**[Investment Feedback: One Profound Crystal.]**

…

"Ice Lump is still the most rewarding," Li Mo couldn't help but exclaim. Just treating her to some wine yielded twenty years of Martial Dao comprehension. This was something one could never have too much of. Clearly, with the same investment, even though his Master seemed to favor wine and meat more, the rewards obtained from Ying Bing were still significantly better. One could only say this was the terrifying power of a Red Destiny.

Yes, for the sake of rewards, he must cling to Ice Lump's jade legs. Was he holding onto legs? No, he was holding onto a shining money tree!

**[Host still has one feedback pending collection. Do you wish to collect it?]**

Li Mo remembered. He had saved Murong Xiao earlier today. This should count as a significant change to her destiny, right? What good stuff would it yield?

Little Li felt a small thrill of anticipation. With a thought, he said, "Collect."

**[Congratulations, Host, you invested one bottle of Serene Heart Pills, successfully saving Murong Xiao and preventing her from falling into demonic corruption.]**
**[Investment Feedback: One Stone Heavenly Book Seal.]**

**[Stone Heavenly Book Seal]**: "Stamp it on any martial art to allow it to be deduced, refined, and thus elevate its grade. It can elevate a martial art to a maximum of High-grade."

"Refine martial arts?" Li Mo was startled, almost dropping the Night-Luminous Pearl.

The next moment, a small, thumb-sized seal appeared in his left hand. The seal was bronze-colored, yet it was unlike any brass or bronze Li Mo had ever seen. Tadpole-like characters were carved on its four sides, exuding an ancient charm.

"There's a stone Heavenly Book Seal, so does that mean there are also bronze, silver, and gold ones?" Li Mo mused.

Among the techniques he currently practiced, the highest-grade should be the *Extreme Soldier Body Slaughtering Art*, which belonged to the Peerless-grade. The *Fire Heart Lotus Birth Technique* was a High-grade martial art. Above Peerless-grade were Divine Arts. If he were to acquire silver or gold Heavenly Book Seals in the future, he could upgrade the martial arts he had already learned. Upgrading existing martial arts would be much more convenient than switching to other cultivation methods.

"I'll worry about that when I get one," Li Mo decided. He took out the *Prairie Fire Sword Art* his Master had just given him. Besides this Mid-grade sword art, he currently had no other martial arts that could be upgraded.

He gently pressed the Heavenly Book Seal onto a page of the book. Immediately, the tadpole characters on it shimmered faintly, all 'drilling' into the book and moving among the text. Some characters were rearranged by the small tadpoles, while others were swallowed and new characters were spat out. Li Mo watched in fascination.

After about five minutes, the tadpole characters completely lost their light and vanished. The sword art recorded in the book had also changed to:

**[Fire Crane Myriad Feathers Sword]**.

"I just gained 20 years of Martial Dao comprehension."
"If I were to apply it all to my other two cultivation methods, it might not even be enough to break through from Great Accomplishment to Perfection."
"I'll learn the sword art first."

Little Li reasoned with himself. Well, truthfully, he just wanted to learn the sword art. Who wouldn't want to be a graceful, handsome sword-wielding hero, riding the wind and moon? Whether it was strong or not was secondary; being cool was for life.

Filled with anticipation, Li Mo poured his Martial Dao comprehension into the *Fire Crane Myriad Feathers Sword*.

**[Twenty years of Martial Dao comprehension successfully injected.]**
**[Year 1: Your interest is strong; you diligently begin learning the Fire Crane Myriad Feathers Sword and successfully achieve入门 (Initiation).]**
**[Year 5: You are still eager to learn the sword art. The practice process goes smoothly, and you finally achieve初熟 (Beginner Proficiency).]**
**[Year 8: You enter a bottleneck. For a long time, there is no progress whatsoever, and you begin to doubt yourself.]**
**[Year 20: After a long period of stagnant meditation, you finally, through painstaking effort, summarized your sword art experience and barely achieved小成 (Minor Accomplishment).]**

Li Mo opened his eyes. Instantly, twenty years of day-and-night practice, impervious to cold or heat, became vividly clear in his memory. He looked at a branch outside the window. No, this was clearly an peerless divine sword!

Breaking off the branch, he eagerly brandished it. The branch in his hand faintly carried a clear, ringing sound of wind. The *Prairie Fire Sword Art* originally emphasized explosive power. The *Fire Crane Myriad Feathers Sword*, refined from it, inherited this advantage and elevated it to a higher level. Each hit on an enemy would leave behind vital energy within their body, causing red marks to appear on them, like burning crane feathers. When this vital energy accumulated to its limit, it could be unleashed all at once. At Minor Accomplishment, one could stack this vital energy up to nine layers.

"Once I reach the Internal Breath realm, I can replace the vital energy with internal breath."

Discarding the cracked branch, Little Li was very satisfied. After calming down, he couldn't help but ponder. Twenty years, only Minor Accomplishment? Was it because martial techniques were harder to study than cultivation methods or body tempering arts, or did he simply lack sword art talent?

"If I get other martial techniques in the future, I can add some Martial Dao comprehension to them. Then I'll know." Li Mo pulled his thoughts back.

He sat cross-legged on the floor and began his cultivation method practice. "The speed of opening meridians needs to accelerate."

"My Mysterious Yin Immortal Physique seems to have more main meridians, and my path in the Qi-Blood realm is longer than others'."

A hum— Following a strange resonance between heaven and earth, Li Mo once again entered a state of unity with nature. The purest vital energy from heaven and earth flowed into his body like water. His consciousness slowly sank, entering his own body.

Inner vision. This didn't require specific training. After Li Mo comprehended the *Fire Heart Lotus Birth Technique* to Great Accomplishment, he could naturally achieve it. Of course, for others, it would probably take until the Internal Breath realm to master it. Ordinary Qi-Blood realm cultivators could only rely on diet, practice, and continuous tempering of their own qi and blood, then blindly冲击 (charge) through the meridians.

But with inner vision, Li Mo could not only use vital energy to temper his qi and blood but also use it to precisely guide his qi and blood into the meridians. For example, the former was like splashing a bucket of water indiscriminately, while the latter was like connecting a hose, precise and efficient. Therefore, Li Mo's meridian opening process could only be described as 'naturally flowing'. There were no bottlenecks, and injury was impossible.

It looked simple, but achieving this was due to multiple factors. The Mysterious Yin Immortal Physique, a Great Accomplishment Peerless-grade cultivation method, and the increased meridian strength from the *Extreme Soldier Body Slaughtering Art*—none could be lacking.

"Sigh, it's a bit slow."
"It'll probably be midnight before I can fully open the 'Yang Wei meridian'."

Li Mo sighed inwardly. He could only say this in his heart. Because if he voiced it, and others heard it, he would likely get a beating. Even the outer disciples within the sect were elites chosen from an entire prefecture. Each generation replaced the last, all striving to enter the inner sect. The condition was to open all twelve main meridians and enter the Internal Breath realm within three years. Yet, ultimately, only one-tenth of them succeeded in entering the inner sect. And he was complaining about being slow?

Unconsciously, night deepened. The moon, more than ten times larger than Blue Star's, shone high in the sky, bathing the Clear Abyss Mountain Range in silver light.

In the room, the fluctuations of heaven and earth vital energy slowly ceased.

"The Yang Wei meridian is open." Li Mo looked up; the moon had just moved directly overhead. It had taken... about three hours? If others knew, they would probably think they'd seen a ghost. But within Li Mo's body, that newly opened meridian was truly filled with vigorous qi and blood.

Of course, this was within Li Mo's expectations. What truly surprised him was the number of meridians in his body.

"I should have thirty-six main meridians?" Li Mo was both surprised and delighted. For a martial practitioner, the main meridians in the body were equivalent to engines. This meant that the qi and blood he could mobilize in the future would be three times that of an ordinary Qi-Blood realm cultivator? The disparity in combat power would be even greater.

"There are still about ten days until the sect trial."
"I wonder if any accidents will occur."

After all, Ying Bing's evaluation clearly stated that she had a troubled destiny. So, if nothing went wrong, something was bound to go wrong with her. If something happened to her, then he, living under the same roof, probably couldn't avoid being dragged in. Li Mo felt a sense of urgency. He craved power!

"The qi and blood accumulated from vital energy should still be enough to open one more meridian," Li Mo murmured to himself. After a quick trip to the latrine and a glass of water, he sat down again. The heaven and earth vital energy once again began to fluctuate. It was strange. Whenever he cultivated, he seemed to feel no fatigue or exhaustion at all. If not for the limitation of the conversion speed between vital energy and qi and blood, it wouldn't be impossible to cultivate for twenty-four hours a day...

…

Next door.

Many things in Ying Bing's room were already frozen. She never lit candles. Because when she practiced, candles had no right to burn. In Gui Palace, all lighting throughout the palace used jade crystal lamps made from merfolk fat.

"Two meridians."
"Still not fast enough."

Ying Bing lowered her gaze and calculated briefly. The inheritance site she intended to visit required at least eight meridians in the Qi-Blood realm. This meant that within these ten-plus days, she still needed to open at least six more meridians.

Suddenly, Ying Bing seemed to recall that this year's sect trial had not been peaceful. At that time, she hadn't successfully opened her meridians yet and was not a participant, only having heard some rumors. It was said that a small number of disciples had gone missing during this trial. That's right, not dead, but missing—no body found, no trace left. What exactly happened remained unknown.

"A few points stronger means a few points more certainty."
"One of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix's life-souls, I must obtain it."

Ying Bing's snow-like eyes flickered slightly. In her previous life, she had, by chance, entered a secret realm that was born in response to the 'Rosy Plume Soul,' one of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix's nine souls. It was through this that she displayed her talent and changed her destiny. Throughout her subsequent life, this inheritance remained inextricably linked to her. Later, through various fortuitous encounters and other means, she gathered all nine souls of the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix, which became one of her crucial foundations on her path to invincibility. It could be said that among the major opportunities in her life, the Nine-Colored Primordial Phoenix ranked among the top three. The Divine Art she created—the *Nine-Colored Profound Phoenix Scripture*—also required possessing all nine souls to cultivate.

"Li Mo, is he still cultivating?"
"He certainly has some perseverance."

It was strange. Whenever Ying Bing thought of Li Mo being next door, her heart, once like solid ice, stirred with a faint ripple. She didn't dislike this feeling, but she disliked being affected by it. What displeased her even more was that she didn't understand the origin of this emotion.

"Is it because I still owe him a favor?"

After some thought, Ying Bing made a decision. She would bring Li Mo to the inheritance site. Any random opportunity obtained there would be enough to change an ordinary person's destiny. Perhaps it could allow him, in his lifetime, to step out of Ziyang Prefecture, or even the Eastern Desolation Region. If he could witness even a fraction of the true wonders of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, it would not have been a wasted life.
