# Chapter 114: Ling Yu

“Sorry about this,” Zhou Tian mumbled, apologizing silently as he instantly appeared before the creature.

Whoosh!

Before Zhou Tian could even make a provocative move, the creature’s wings twitched slightly, and a dark storm surged forth. Zhou Tian didn’t dodge; he was instantly torn to shreds.

But in that same instant, Zhou Tian’s stark naked body reappeared.

The creature possessed extraordinary intelligence and didn’t hesitate. Its wings vibrated wildly, dark hurricanes gathered, and two massive dark wind blades formed, cleaving towards Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian neither dodged nor avoided, absorbing the attack before vanishing from his spot.

The creature wielded the power of wind and was incredibly fast, but Zhou Tian used spatial teleportation. With his accumulated death count, his teleportation range was now immense. He took a wide detour, careful not to lead the creature toward Mu Su.

The distance between them steadily grew until they reached the territory of another fierce beast. The creature hesitated for a long time but ultimately did not enter, perhaps deeming the effort unworthy.

Having shaken off the creature, Zhou Tian headed back towards Mu Su and quickly arrived.

However, the moment Zhou Tian appeared, he froze. Standing before Mu Su was a woman, provocatively dressed, with large expanses of skin exposed. Her chest was unfathomably deep, with a formidable cleavage. It wasn’t intentional provocative attire; rather, her clothes were tattered in many places, making her appear very exposed.

She had a beautiful face, with all her curves in the right places, and her face was streaked with tears, giving her the appearance of a pear blossom bathed in rain. Upon seeing Zhou Tian, she too froze.

Zhou Tian’s mind raced and then abruptly stopped. The scene was incredibly awkward; one wrong move and he could be labeled a pervert or an exhibitionist. But he was a quick-witted fellow. Almost instantly, Zhou Tian bellowed:

“Pervert! Peeking at my naked body!”

Mu Su sighed, closing his eyes. He knew this would happen.

The woman also froze, her face flushing crimson with anger. But seeing Zhou Tian’s current state, she couldn’t say anything. She turned her back and softly scolded, “Put your clothes on quickly!”

Zhou Tian gave Mu Su a triumphant look. See? This is the importance of taking the initiative.

“I say, Miss, while I know my naked body is astonishingly tempting, you can’t scheme so meticulously to gaze upon it, can you?” Zhou Tian said as he got dressed.

The woman didn’t speak, but her body seemed to be trembling continuously.

“Alright, young lady, you can turn around now,” Zhou Tian said to the woman, patting his clothes one last time.

The woman cautiously turned around, as if checking if Zhou Tian had truly put on his clothes. Seeing that he had, she sighed in relief and fully turned around.

“I’ve never seen a man as shameless as you!” the woman finally delivered her counter-attack.

Zhou Tian shrugged indifferently. “The feeling is mutual.”

“You…” The woman’s chest heaved with anger.

“Mu Su, aren’t you going to introduce this young lady?” Zhou Tian turned to Mu Su and asked.

Mu Su shook his head. “I don’t know her either. She appeared shortly after you left.”

Zhou Tian nodded. If she wasn’t an old acquaintance of Mu Su, then this was interesting.

“Miss, won’t you introduce yourself?”

The woman sneered, “Why don’t you introduce yourself first?”

Mu Su glanced at the woman and spoke, “Young lady, weren’t you just distraught from being pursued by fierce beasts? Are you alright now?”

The woman’s face stiffened.

Zhou Tian secretly chuckled. Mu Su had learned how to add insult to injury.

“Is that so?!” His voice suddenly three decibels louder, Zhou Tian put on a look of tender pity for a beautiful woman, spread his arms, and walked towards her. “Such a beautiful young lady suffering such a great ordeal! Don’t be afraid, Miss, come, a hug…”

“No… no need, I’m much better now,” the woman dodged backward, saying softly, cursing endlessly in her heart, *Where did this lunatic come from?*

Fearing Zhou Tian would pull another stunt, she quickly spoke, “My name is Ling Yu. I saw an anomaly appear on Mount Wanshen, so I wanted to investigate. I didn’t expect this mountain range to be so dangerous. My friends all…”

Before she could finish, two lines of clear tears flowed down again, making her appear incredibly pitiful.

Zhou Tian chuckled to himself. She’s good at crying on command. He stepped forward again. “Don’t cry, little sister Ling Yu, come, a hug.”

Ling Yu’s body stiffened. She was so used to acting that she forgot about this lunatic. *She cursed him inwardly.*

She dodged again, wiped away her tears, and Ling Yu said softly, “Sirs, I’m much better now, thank you for your concern.” Her voice was mournful, able to evoke a protective instinct in others.

“Since you’re much better, then go. We still have to travel,” Zhou Tian’s face suddenly turned stern, and he spoke indifferently.

Ling Yu froze again. This wasn’t how the script was supposed to go! How could they just watch a weak woman like her walk alone in the forest? Just a moment ago he was asking for hugs, now he’s indifferent to women? *You change too quickly!*

“I want to leave too, but how can a woman with low cultivation like me leave this perilous mountain range alone?” Ling Yu could only continue the script herself.

“Oh,” Zhou Tian nodded, indicating he understood.

“Oh”? What does “oh” mean? Say something more! Ling Yu looked at Zhou Tian expectantly.

“I want to ask you two sirs to take me to where my friends died. I want to collect their remains. After all, we came out together, and now…” Ling Yu wanted to cry again, but remembered Zhou Tian beside her and forced the tears back.

“What a truly touching story! Since you have a request, Ling Yu, we are duty-bound to help!” Zhou Tian was once again full of enthusiasm, leaving Ling Yu dumbfounded.

She wasn’t foolish. After this series of events, she suspected Zhou Tian might have seen through her, but since they agreed to go, she was sure they wouldn’t cause any major trouble once they arrived at the location.

After a moment of thought, with no flaws showing on her face, she whispered, “Thank you both. After this is done, Ling Yu will surely repay you handsomely. May I know your names?”

Zhou Tian smiled and said, “My name is Anduin, and he’s Saman, my younger brother. Don’t mind him, I’m in charge here. Just give the generous reward to me, secretly.”

“Heh heh.” Mu Su just watched Zhou Tian spouting nonsense.

Anduin? Saman? These names sound a bit familiar. Ling Yu felt a little doubtful, as if she’d heard them somewhere before. Could these two men be someone important? Although she didn’t understand Zhou Tian’s method of appearance, she believed her own forces could definitely handle everything. She would capture them once they arrived at the location.

“Let’s set off now, lest too much time passes and your friends, Miss Ling Yu, become nothing but dust.”

Ling Yu didn’t know how to respond. “Nothing but dust”? *You certainly have a way with words!* She could only nod, her cleavage prominently displayed.
