# Chapter 540: Crushing Defeat

She spoke, her phoenix eyes glinting with a captivating light as she casually sized up Xu Yunfan. Yet, beneath the surface of her gaze lay a barely perceptible scrutiny and an air of condescending superiority.

In her eyes, this junior brother from the Divine Thunder Peak, though his aura was more stable than in the past, still possessed a youthful face. The spiritual fluctuations she sensed were mediocre at best, seemingly stuck at the early Foundation Establishment stage.

This fellow must have stumbled upon some fortuitous opportunity to enter the Foundation Establishment realm.

She still remembered how, when Xu Yunfan first emerged from the Divine Martial Realm, she could have ended his life with a casual word. Who would have thought that sixty years later, he would have actually reached the same stage as her.

At least, he had finally graduated from being mere "material" and gained some independence.

His aura lacked the profound sense of an impending inner world, the hallmark of a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. This confirmed her certainty.

Xu Yunfan was definitely a fresh-faced True Person who had only entered the Foundation Establishment realm for two or three decades. His foundation was shallow, making him the perfect prey.

With her mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivation, her extensive battle experience, and her deep understanding of soul-entangling arts, handling a Divine Thunder Peak disciple who had barely shed the Qi Condensation stage would be as easy as taking candy from a baby.

She could also use the opportunity to drain the foundation he had inherited from the "Legacy of the Divine Thunder True Lord." Ever since she learned that the True Martial Peak had been renamed the Divine Thunder Peak and that Xu Yunfan had switched to cultivating the Nine Heavens Thunder Monarch Sutra, she had been keeping a close watch.

The Divine Thunder was supremely Yang and formidable, his spiritual power vast and righteous. If she could drain it properly, she might just be able to step into the late Foundation Establishment stage.

If this supreme sutra hadn't been taken by the Pure Yang True Lord of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, she would have made her move long ago.

Now that Xu Yunfan had returned, it was only natural for her to put her plans into motion.

By then, even if her lifespan in this world came to an end, she could quickly awaken her past wisdom after reincarnation. Stepping back into Foundation Establishment would be a certainty.

This was her chance to truly walk the path of cultivation.

The time until her reincarnation was not too far off.

The trap she had laid in the Morning Star Sword was meant to be the bait to draw out the faint trace of Divine Thunder Qi within him.

She never expected Xu Yunfan to be completely unaffected by her charm, but in the end, things still turned out the way she wanted.

Thinking of this, the Hundred Flowers True Person's smile grew even more alluring and charming, like a blooming man-eating flower.

"Junior Brother Xu, if you are interested in the Dao of Dual Cultivation, why bother with those junior disciples? Your Senior Sister has been immersed in this path for many years and is most proficient. If you don't mind, I can personally guide you today and let you experience the supreme, ecstatic wonder of Yin and Yang's union, the harmony of Heaven and Earth. What do you say?"

Her words had barely faded when her eyes, which seemed to contain swirling galaxies, suddenly lit up with a strange pink glow.

The aura around them subtly changed, as if an intoxicating, spring-like atmosphere was spreading through the air.

*Hum!*

Following that, an invisible yet immensely powerful wave of enchanting spiritual force, like a tangible sound wave mixed with an aphrodisiac and bone-eroding spiritual power, shot straight towards Xu Yunfan's face.

This type of fluctuation, which acts upon the consciousness, is not primarily for killing. It is more like forcibly prying open the opponent's mental defenses to inject seeds of confusion and desire, stirring the primal, instinctual desires within their body. It aims to make them instantly fall into depravity, willingly kneeling at her feet and becoming a puppet for her to drain as she pleases.

This is the Secret Foundation Establishment Art of the Hundred Desires Peak: The Myriad Desires Enchanting Passion.

It is the most enchanting Foundation Establishment innate divine ability from the *Classic of the Intersection of All Desires, Yin-Yang, and Separation-Reunion*. If cultivated to its ultimate peak, it might even be able to charm the heavens themselves, making Heaven and Earth open a path for her, and the sun and moon shine upon her.

Then, she could truly be said to have the timing and the support of Heaven and Earth.

The Hundred Flowers True Person was confident this attack would hit its mark.

She could already picture Xu Yunfan's dazed eyes, his heavy breathing, and his flushed face as he lunged at her.

Even a fellow mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, if caught off guard by her full-powered use of this art, would have their mind shaken and fall prey to her. Against an opponent of the same realm, this innate divine ability had never failed. Even if someone managed to break free, they would generally flee in panic, let alone Xu Yunfan, who was merely at the early Foundation Establishment stage.

However.

Xu Yunfan stood his ground, not moving a single inch.

The bewitching pink ripples, powerful enough to charm countless cultivators and ignite the fires of desire, seemed to melt into the sea the moment they touched the space three feet before him, without even stirring a single ripple.

The natural and open smile on his face remained unchanged. His eyes were as clear as the cold pond beneath the Nine Heavens'玄冰 (mysterious ice)—deep, calm, and cold. There wasn't a trace of lustful confusion.

He simply watched the Hundred Flowers True Person quietly, his gaze holding no anger, no surprise, only a barely perceptible... amusement?

As if he were watching a self-written and self-directed clown show.

"Senior Sister Liu has put in quite the effort with all this preening. I, your Junior Brother, do have some interest in mature women. If you don't mind, why don't you come up to my Divine Thunder Peak for a chat?"

"正好我之前修行的百欲吞元大法还有几处疑惑，说不得是要请教师姐了。" (I just happen to have a few questions about the Myriad Desires Devouring Yuan Art I cultivated before, and I might need to ask for your guidance, Senior Sister.)

"?!?"

The charming smile on the Hundred Flowers True Person's face instantly froze.

It was as if an invisible hand had gripped her throat. Her风情万种 (a thousand charms) instantly froze on her face, leaving only deep shock and disbelief.

Her meticulously crafted *Myriad Desires Enchanting Passion*, which contained a massive surge of spiritual and spiritual power, had actually failed?

It was like a stone sinking into the sea. The opponent didn't even bat an eye.

How was this possible? He was just a "junior" who had just entered Foundation Establishment!

Even if he had cultivated some kind of Calm Mind Art, he shouldn't have been able to completely ignore the secret art of her Hundred Desires Peak.

Unless...

A chilling thought flashed through her mind like lightning.

Under her suspicious and uncertain gaze, the smile on Xu Yunfan's face seemed to deepen slightly. With an air of seeing through everything, he slowly spoke.

His voice was calm and even, but it struck the Hundred Flowers True Person's heart like a heavy hammer.

"Senior Sister Liu Yunhua," he accurately called out the Hundred Flowers True Person's name. "Did you know that it has been nearly fifty years since I first entered the Foundation Establishment realm?"

As his words fell, Liu Yunhua's pupils constricted violently!

Fifty years?!

Not twenty-plus years?!

Liu Yunhua instantly realized that the information Chu Chengnan had given her was completely wrong. The other party seemed to have used some kind of knowledge-obscuring technique to lead her thoughts astray.

A chilling寒意 (cold intent) instantly shot up from her tailbone, rushing straight to the crown of her head.

A sense of foreboding grew wildly like a venomous vine.

That Chu Chengnan, a true smiling tiger, had planted a thorn in her path with just this one move.

But before she could make any reaction.

She didn't even have time to fully express the horror on her face.

*BOOM!*

A silent thunderclap exploded between the two of them.

A terrifying roar that could only be felt on the level of the consciousness.

Xu Yunfan moved.

He did not form any seals, nor did he chant any incantations. Not a single trace of the spiritual light that a typical Foundation Establishment True Person would erupt with was released from his body.

He simply took a single step forward.

But it was this simple step.

Within that small space, the heavens and earth underwent a dramatic transformation.

Centered on him, a projection of a "world," extremely minute yet boundlessly vast, suddenly descended.

At its core was a seed phantom, the size of a grain of rice, entirely ink-black, its surface covered in an infinite number of profound silver thunder patterns.
