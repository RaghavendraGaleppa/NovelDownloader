# Chapter 162: Spiritual Treasure

Lin Shan stared dumbfounded at the little figure clinging to him—a girl about five or six years old with large, crescent-shaped eyes, a delicate, rosy nose, and a slightly parted mouth, looking up at him with innocent curiosity. 

Dressed in a small blue dress, her tiny hands clung tightly to his waist. The lively sparkle in her eyes was indistinguishable from that of a real child!

*Gulp—*

Lin Shan swallowed hard. He could sense the girl's aura and vitality, but he couldn't feel her weight or touch. In other words, she was merely a spiritual entity—or more precisely, a *treasure spirit*.

"The spirit of the Void Star Disk?" Lin Shan asked cautiously.

The little girl seemed startled by his sudden question. Perhaps shy, she lowered her head timidly, avoiding his gaze.

Having previously refined the Void Star Disk with his divine sense, Lin Shan had already established a master-servant bond with the treasure spirit. Through this connection, he could sense her nervousness, her wariness of the unfamiliar surroundings, and her innate curiosity.

After steadying himself, Lin Shan attempted to communicate with the spirit. With gentle coaxing, the girl gradually warmed up to him. Though she couldn't speak, she clearly understood his words.

Excited, Lin Shan exercised his first privilege as her master: naming her.

"Since your true form is the Void Star Disk, I'll call you... Little Void!"

"..."

The girl pouted, clearly displeased with the unoriginal name.

Lin Shan reconsidered. "How about Little Disk?"

She shook her head vigorously, as if lamenting her misfortune in having such a tasteless master.

"Little Star, then?"

After much negotiation, the spirit reluctantly accepted the name "Little Xin."

Next, Lin Shan turned to his most pressing questions: What made a spiritual treasure different from a magic treasure, and what could the treasure spirit do for him?

"Little Xin, can you control the Void Star Disk?"

At his words, the girl waved her hand, and the silver compass flew into her arms. Without waiting for further instructions, she formed a series of hand seals. Suddenly, a fierce wind howled through the chamber as countless whirlpools of spiritual energy converged violently.

Visible storms of spiritual energy filled the room in an instant.

At the same time, a thick beam of starlight descended from above, and silver cascades poured down as if from the heavens, transforming the space into a sea of stellar energy—all while leaving no trace of disturbance outside.

---

Lin Shan stood amidst the swirling spiritual storms on his left and the surging stellar waterfalls on his right. As the energies washed over him, he felt his physical density, bloodline purity, spiritual refinement, and divine sense strength all gradually improving.

Within just a few breaths, his entire body felt warm and weightless, as if he had stepped into a celestial paradise.

"Is this the power of the celestial stars?"

Experiencing stellar energy for the first time, Lin Shan observed through internal vision as impurities, medicinal residues, hidden ailments, and even blocked meridians were purified. His blood vessels became translucent, and his blood shimmered with flecks of starlight.

"If I could temper my body with stellar energy every day, wouldn't my strength, constitution, spirit, and charm all improve comprehensively?"

He marveled at the revelation, realizing for the first time that the Void Star Disk could serve as a cheat for cultivation. Carrying this spiritual treasure was like having an ultra-efficient spirit-gathering array combined with a stellar energy conduit.

Moreover, stellar tempering was a gradual process. Over time, his body would transform into a rare special constitution in the cultivation world—the *Celestial Star Body*.

This acquired spiritual constitution might not be inferior to some innate ones. Beyond its comprehensive, steady enhancements, if Lin Shan could find cultivation techniques or divine abilities that harnessed stellar energy, his progress and power would skyrocket.

Back then, why had Thunder Rain Child been groomed as the Purple Cloud Sect's "Nascent Soul Seed"? His top-tier spiritual roots were one factor, but his *Lightning Mother Body* was the true reason for the elders' high expectations.

"To think that one day, I too could alter my physical aptitude... But I've never heard of stellar-based techniques or divine abilities in the Great Song Dynasty. I'll have to search for them elsewhere in the future."

Still, this was just the Void Star Disk's most basic function. According to the enhancement panel's description, its other abilities had also evolved.

As if sensing his thoughts, Little Xin formed another series of hand seals.

A dazzling nebula materialized above the silver compass, dotted with stars of varying brightness and size. Tiny serpentine streaks of light slithered through the cosmic display.

"Is this... the spiritual veins and terrain within a thousand-mile radius?"

Through Little Xin's gestures, Lin Shan roughly understood that the stars and serpents represented the spiritual veins and geographical features of the nearby volcanic island chain in the East Sea.

This archipelago naturally housed several spiritual veins, making it a rare spiritual haven in the East Sea. Moreover, its layout resonated with the celestial patterns of the Big Dipper. Thus, demonic path experts had leveraged this terrain to establish an impregnable defensive formation around their temporary headquarters.

---

The Void Star Disk could assess geomancy and celestial phenomena, allowing it to deduce such details. In the future, it could identify perilous locations to avoid deadly formations, locate treasures in auspicious lands, harness ghostly energy in yin-converging areas, or even facilitate tribulation transcendence in dragon-and-tiger terrain.

Of course, mastery of formations would be ideal—knowing how to set up various killing arrays based on different terrains and spiritual veins could amplify their power by severalfold.

"This function is great, but... I don't know formations."

"Ya-ya!" 

Little Xin pointed at herself and formed more hand seals. Ripples of restriction patterns emerged around them as starlight descended once more. In a dazzling display, she conjured a radiant array woven entirely from stellar energy.

Lin Shan's eyes nearly bulged out of his skull. *She can set up formations without materials? Just using starlight? Even the Black Skeleton Demon Monarch can't do that!*

After some clarification from Little Xin, he learned that this was only a temporary array. For more powerful formations, material components would still be necessary.

Lin Shan sighed in relief. If she could manifest grand formations out of thin air, the Void Star Disk wouldn't just be a spiritual treasure—it would be a bona fide *immortal artifact*!

"Any other abilities?" he asked, his anticipation growing.

"Ya-ya..."

Little Xin tilted her head, unsure how to demonstrate. After some animated gesturing, Lin Shan grasped the final function: within a thousand-mile radius, if an enemy's aura was present on an object, the Void Star Disk could sense their location and guide him to them.

Lin Shan nodded. This feature had existed before, but its range had now expanded tenfold.

The difference between a hundred and a thousand miles was immense, as evident in cultivation benchmarks:

- Foundation Establishment cultivators' divine sense could span hundreds of meters.
- Core Formation experts could scan several miles.
- Nascent Soul elders' senses extended up to ten miles, with late-stage grandmasters specializing in divine sense possibly reaching nearly a hundred miles.

With a thousand-mile detection range, the upgraded Void Star Disk provided unparalleled reconnaissance depth—a hunter's ultimate tool.

"Impressive."

The Void Star Disk's four functions were all practical. While celestial geomancy wasn't immediately useful, the other three—gathering spiritual and stellar energy, analyzing and deploying formations, and tracking enemies—were all auxiliary capabilities Little Xin could manage for him.

---

This spiritual treasure covered detection, cultivation, formations, and combat, making it remarkably versatile.

Moreover, Little Xin's formation expertise was at the level of a grandmaster—equivalent to a Nascent Soul cultivator in status!

"If Little Xin knows formations, what do I need the Black Skeleton Demon Monarch for?" Lin Shan muttered without thinking.

Still, he acknowledged the skeleton's value. Its Nascent Soul-level knowledge, combat prowess, and esoteric techniques could prove invaluable in critical moments. The old bone simply had a habit of hoarding its secrets, leaving plenty of untapped potential.

Having familiarized himself with the Void Star Disk's capabilities and bonded with Little Xin, Lin Shan prepared to end his seclusion. Before closing up, he had assigned the Black Skeleton Demon Monarch a task—he wondered if the lazybones had actually done it.
