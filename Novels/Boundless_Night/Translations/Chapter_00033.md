**Chapter 33: Striving for a Future**

Under the night sky, the dark silhouettes of distant mountains were faintly visible.

“The information was wrong!” someone in the mountain forest cried out in alarm.

Deep within the dense woods, the few individuals cornering Qin Ming were stunned. They swiftly retreated, having already lost two companions in the blink of an eye. The young man had transformed from simple and serene into a raging killer in an instant, even his clear eyes changing, as if two bolts of lightning shot forth from them.

Especially now, Qin Ming held his spear with one hand, having pierced the chest of one of their comrades and impaled him mid-air, letting the blood flow and drip, staining the snow.

This scene made the hair of those who had first surrounded him stand on end. Had it been them standing there just now, they likely wouldn't have dodged it either.

The young man's aura was entirely different now. His black hair was blown by the cold wind, his handsome face was filled with a cold intensity, and his entire being began to exude an oppressive presence.

The few couldn't help but continuously retreat. How could someone who had just undergone their first rebirth possess such powerful strength? One of the two who died had already stepped into the secondary rebirth domain over ten years ago.

“This truly exceeds my expectations. You harbor no small secret; you’ve achieved secondary rebirth so quickly. Most people would need to stabilize for a period, yet you don't need to pause, advancing directly again.”

Qi Huaien walked forward, his figure well-proportioned, powerful and agile like a tiger or leopard. His relatively handsome face was etched with coldness, and he frowned.

He disliked the feeling of being out of control. This young man, who had been under observation, had exceeded his grasp and become a dangerous variable. But since the deed was done, he had no other choice.

His family was currently searching for a very rare spiritual substance, preparing to formulate a mysterious elixir that could alter one's root bone, enhancing his aptitude and potential, making him one of the chosen candidates.

If that happened, he could spend several more years listening to secret methods beside that elder in Liuguang City, which would be enough to change the trajectory of his entire life.

If Qin Ming and You Liangyun had similar aptitudes, he would have been happy to show goodwill in advance and befriend him. But he realized this young man was destined to block his path, and he couldn't hold back any longer.

Qin Ming violently swung the long spear in his right hand. The impaled corpse, like a scarecrow, flew off the spearhead and hurtled towards Qi Huaien with extreme speed.

Qi Huaien swiftly drew his long saber with a *shua* sound, a flash of lightning seeming to streak across the dim forest. He used the flat of his blade to strike the rapidly approaching corpse. His movements were nimble, yet the corpse seemed to have suffered a heavy blow; the part touched by the blade completely deformed and was easily deflected, crashing into a large tree nearby.

*Crack!*

Many withered branches snapped. The corpse hit the tree trunk high up, its body mangled, and then it fell to the ground.

During this process, Qin Ming calmly shifted a few steps, re-grasping the long-handled Wujin Hammer that had fallen to the ground. Now, he held a long spear in one hand and a great hammer in the other.

Neither of these weapons was suitable for ordinary people to wield with one hand, but he possessed two thousand jin of strength in his arms, making both weapons feel light as a feather even when held individually.

He was a little surprised. This Qi Huaien truly had some skill. With a light flick of his long saber, the corpse was sent flying six or seven meters, as if struck by an armored vehicle, its bones shattered and tendons torn.

Qi Huaien looked at the other four, saying, “What are you still standing there for? Are you waiting for me to act personally while you watch?”

These were all people he had brought from his family. Some were loyal to him, while others were intimidated by his background and dared not disobey. This time, the few of them became extremely vigilant, slowly circling Qin Ming, ready to attack at any moment.

This time, all those besieging Qin Ming were highly concentrated. A secondary rebirth expert took the lead in the main assault, wielding a gleaming long *suo* (a type of polearm), suddenly chopping down. His essence, spirit, and vitality surged, mobilizing all the power in his body.

At the same time, the others also attacked, including Qi Huaien, who unleashed a terrifying blade light, subtly concealed amidst the weapons of the crowd.

Qin Ming's long-handled Wujin Hammer in his left hand swung directly upwards. With a *clang*, the heavy *suo* was smashed into the air.

The secondary rebirth expert could hardly believe it. He had held the *suo* with both hands, yet he couldn't grip it at all. The soft flesh between his fingers was torn by the shock, and the weapon flew out of his grasp. What horrifying strength was this? Was he still a secondary rebirth expert?

At the same time, the others had also collided with Qin Ming's long spear and long-handled hammer, all of them severely shaken. However, unlike the *suo* wielder, they had some room for buffer and didn't go all out, so although their arms were numb, their weapons remained in hand.

Qin Ming's strength was not just terrifying; his speed also surpassed theirs by a large margin. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to block all the sharp weapons assaulting him in an instant.

Qi Huaien "tested the waters" and retreated after a brief contact. He had already realized that this young man was completely "out of control" and could not be "grasped" at all.

Even though he had already overestimated the opponent, he now saw that he had still been conservative.

Without any hesitation, he took out a three-inch tall crystal vial, pulled out the stopper, and poured the bright red liquid inside into his mouth, drinking it without a second thought.

Today, he had no other choice. Even fleeing was not an option. If he didn't silence the other party, he would face a terrible end. That crow, once it knew the truth of this place, would surely kill him.

Even though he knew this liquid would harm him afterward, Qi Huaien couldn't care less. He had to significantly boost his strength right now.

In the field, Qin Ming did not pause at all. In the momentary clash, engaging everyone, he naturally pinpointed the weakest point first.

The secondary rebirth expert whose *suo* he had sent flying became his immediate primary target.

His body was like a phantom, avoiding the long sabers, iron maces, and sharp swords that others attacked with again. He was practically teleporting, smashing his hammer towards the secondary rebirth expert whose ten fingers were bleeding and who was rapidly retreating.

The man dodged with all his might, aided by a companion nearby, but he still couldn't completely avoid it. The lower part of his right shoulder suffered a heavy blow from the long-handled Wujin Hammer. It instantly collapsed and burst open, breaking the bones on his right chest and piercing his internal organs. He screamed and flew sideways.

Although he was not yet dead, he had lost all combat ability, gasping for air on the ground, unable to get up. His right shoulder was gone, an entire arm severed and flung away.

This dominant, ferocious strength and terrifying fighting style turned the faces of the other few pale. What kind of monster had they encountered?

Even though they were loyal to the Qi family and their entire family, old and young, resided in that city, they were now terrified, sensing an insurmountable opponent and desperately wanting to retreat.

What kind of golden foundation had the opponent laid during his first rebirth? Now, after his secondary rebirth, his strength and speed were beyond their reach, as if they were people from two different levels.

“Don’t be afraid, I can handle him. You all just cooperate from the side and help me hold off this fiend!” Qi Huaien said, walking forward with his long saber.

Not only was his face flushed and glowing, even his body seemed to glow, with all exposed parts radiating a crimson light mist.

Qin Ming stared at him, completely unafraid. The opponent was a secondary rebirth expert. Even if he drank some mysterious elixir, could his body really manifest "divine light" and step into the tertiary rebirth domain? That was simply unrealistic. Even if his body was to transform, it would take one or two days to complete.

“This powerful and extraordinary strength, it’s truly wonderful, utterly intoxicating,” Qi Huaien sighed.

He stared at Qin Ming and said, “I admit, greed has blinded me, my eyes are no longer clear, and my heart is clouded. But even if I had to do it again, I would probably still choose this path.”

At such a critical juncture, he actually needed an emotional outlet.

Qi Huaien's well-proportioned body flowed with red light, and his not-yet-mature face carried a sense of unwillingness and a longing for power. He continued, “Do you know, I come from a city much smaller than Chixia City, but when I first underwent rebirth, I could lift a tripod weighing seven hundred and twenty jin. I was truly exceptional in my region, far surpassing the second-best of my age. Yet, when the esteemed noble passed through, I was even somewhat lacking in the qualifications to be a candidate. I was very disappointed!”

Qin Ming did not act, listening quietly.

Qi Huaien looked up at the night sky and said, “Now, I finally have a chance. My family gave up a mineral vein for me, in exchange for an astonishing spiritual item that can help me alter my root bone and enhance my aptitude. I have the opportunity to study with that noble teacher for five to ten years. Do you know what that means? I will change my destiny because of it, stepping forward into a boundless world, a splendid life. But your appearance has cut off my path upward. You will become a candidate, and I will lose my qualification. And if I take a step back, I will be rootless like a drifting duckweed, going there only as an attendant, only able to audit for one to four years, unable to completely change my destiny. I have no other choice!”

Qin Ming calmly looked at him and said, “You are striving to improve, fighting for yourself, wanting to step into a broader world and see an infinitely brilliant life. Whereas I am here simply to save my life, to survive.”

Qi Huaien raised the long saber in his hand and said, “Yes, our positions are different. Our encounter here is a mistake. But I have no retreat. Either I kill you, allowing me to leap up like a fish from a babbling brook into a boundless golden sea, stirring up my own golden waves, or I die here today, putting an end to everything. Kill!”

He bellowed the word "kill," and with a single leap, he was close, his long saber cleaving out with an exceptionally dazzling light that shattered the surrounding tree branches.

The others also cooperated, lunging forward together in a fierce assault.

In that lightning-fast moment, Qin Ming faced four experts alone, completely composed, without the slightest sense of urgency, continuously clashing with them.

“How is this possible?!” Qi Huaien couldn't believe it, finding it hard to accept the fact that even after drinking the red elixir with side effects, which significantly boosted his strength, he still couldn't sweep aside the opponent?

When he first underwent rebirth, he could lift a tripod weighing seven hundred and twenty jin. After his secondary rebirth, his arm strength doubled, and now it had reached eighteen hundred jin.

Even at this level, he still couldn't suppress the opponent; instead, his right hand was numb from the shock. What kind of monster was this opponent? Far beyond his imagination.

“This… Is he even human?” The faces of the other few turned pale. They knew Qi Huaien's background well, coming from the same place, and understood how terrifying he became after drinking the red elixir. Yet, he was still no match, still unable to suppress the young man!

Qin Ming spoke, “Unless you immediately manifest divine light after drinking the stimulating elixir and step into the tertiary rebirth domain, everything you do is futile.”

At the same time, he showed no mercy. The long spear in his right hand pierced through one man’s heart, flinging him away to hang on a large tree.

*Boom!*

The next instant, he used his hammer to send another opponent's long saber flying and smashed his chest until it caved in. Though the man didn't immediately die, he certainly wouldn't live.

Qi Huaien went mad, clashing with him repeatedly, but his saber-wielding hand trembled slightly. The opponent's long-handled Wujin Hammer was simply unmovable; he couldn't block it anymore.

At this point, Qin Ming threw the long spear in his hand, and Qi Huaien’s last helper was impaled. The man collapsed in the snow, gasping for breath, finding it hard to believe that their group, led by Qi Huaien, had failed in their ambush against one person and would all die here.

Qin Ming calmly employed the fighting techniques from the blade manual. He wasn't simply performing fixed blade forms, but flexibly adapting them based on his own understanding, without any mechanical stiffness, often delivering unexpectedly brilliant strokes.

After multiple clashes, Qi Huaien despairingly discovered that even if he employed techniques, engaged in clever moves, and unleashed various trump cards against the opponent, he still couldn't win, being completely overwhelmed.

With a *bang*, Qi Huaien flew sideways. He was smashed on his right shoulder by Qin Ming's hammer, and it burst apart amidst a mist of blood.

“What level have you reached? How great is your strength?” Qi Huaien asked, unwilling to accept his defeat.

Qin Ming ignored him, preparing to advance to deliver the finishing “hammer strike.”

Qi Huaien gave a tragic laugh, “You don't have to tell me, I already know. To be able to suppress me in this state, your arms must have possessed at least a thousand jin of strength during your first rebirth, and naturally, two thousand jin after your secondary rebirth, am I right?”

The others who hadn't yet died, even as they coughed blood and struggled for life, all tried to raise their heads and look at the valiant young man. Their hearts were utterly shaken; they were hearing such news right before their deaths, that someone could actually reach such a level!

“I'll send you on your way,” Qin Ming said calmly, walking over and delivering a finishing hammer blow to each of them, thoroughly ending their lives.

He carefully cleaned the battlefield, tidying up the mess, ensuring all traces were erased, before turning and leaving, heading towards the crevice from earlier days.

“Hmm?” Qin Ming felt something peculiar. The special node that had once made him severely ill now, as he approached, made his body feel relaxed and light. A trace of fatigue that had appeared after the battle quickly receded in this place.

After carefully scanning the nearby mountain forest, he hesitated no longer, entering the crevice and once again seeing strands of silver light intertwined underground.
