# Chapter 307: The Power of the Inner Scene, Seventy-Two Transformations Perfected

The rosy hues washed over the scene, dazzling and magnificent, like rainbows descending upon the mortal world.

These rays of light condensed into threads, precisely connecting every soldier in the formation. Though intangible, they linked each warrior's Qi and spirit, turning them into a single, unified whole.

Under the coordination of the rainbow light, the thousand soldiers embodied the meaning of "Swift as the Wind."

The Wind Force was complete!

"Is she using some kind of martial art to link every soldier?"

"Otherwise, how could she command such a massive formation as easily as moving her own arm?"

"Even the王爷 (Prince) would find it difficult to achieve such a level..."

On the command platform, the proud generals looked on with expressions mixed with shock.

It was all because of the young girl not far away.

Standing amidst the snow, her white dress fluttering, her slender fingers plucking the clouds and mist. Yet, this breathtakingly beautiful figure could command the ten thousand soldiers and countless changes within her heart.

"Her commands are refined down to the individual level," Zhong Ling muttered to himself, finally realizing just what kind of monster he had been playing against.

Qu Sheng stared intently at the movements of the soldiers. From his tightly clenched fists, it was clear that the leader of the Green Wood Army was holding his breath.

The history of changing military formations now rested entirely on the shoulders of this young man and woman.

Ying Bing's side was flawless.

But could Li Mo endure it?

Inside the Formation.

"It's comparable to the World Force I accepted when I was at the Inner Qi Realm," Li Mo thought.

Watching the surging soldiers and the gradually solidifying True Spirit of Wuzhiqi behind him, Li Mo adapted slightly and exchanged a barely perceptible nod with the Ice Cube.

He had never truly possessed a Field before, but fortunately, he had some experience with it thanks to his beautiful Master.

Now that the Wind Force was formed, it still wasn't quite like a true Field, which forms its own cycle.

Three more Forces were needed!

Ying Bing narrowed her phoenix eyes. A company of soldiers moved according to her orders, flowing into the military formation under the guidance of the Phoenix Qi.

The surging power of flesh and blood rose once more.

The entire formation gained a temperament of "Fierce as Fire."

"Fierce as Fire, the wind aids the fire," Li Mo's handsome, sunny face turned serious as he closely watched the changes in the formation. The next moment, the immense power ignited the blood and True Yuan within his body.

The military momentum was changing, and naturally, the core of the formation was not static. After all, he had never studied military formations. Fortunately, his long-term practice of the *Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body* made him particularly sensitive to the changes in the Qi of slaughter, allowing him to barely keep up with the Ice Cube's rhythm.

Another ten companies of soldiers entered the formation.

The addition of this thousand people brought a sense of stillness within the movement of the formation. The combination of motion and stillness made the situation increasingly unpredictable.

"Steady as the Forest," the forest aids the wind.

The three Forces were now complete. Only the Mountain Force was left to complete the self-sustaining cycle of the Inner Scene Field.

Li Mo couldn't help but feel his body grow heavy.

However, the power of thirty companies of soldiers was already comparable to the World Force he could currently withstand.

Ying Bing's gaze quietly fell upon him once more.

Li Mo understood the unspoken question within it.

*Continue?*

"I'm fine," he signaled back.

After Ying Bing's meticulous organization and the tacit understanding developed from their dual cultivation, this military formation wasn't as crude and violent as pure World Force.

"En."

The final company of soldiers was integrated into the formation.

The thousand soldiers took a single, unified step, adding the final piece to the Zhong family's military formation.

The Mountain strengthened the Forest.

Swift as the Wind, Steady as the Forest, Fierce as the Fire, Immovable as the Mountain.

At the center of the formation's core, Li Mo felt the countless clashes of gold and iron, the ferocity of the battlefield. It was dozens of times stronger than what he had faced against Zhong Zhenyue.

His physical body and spiritual will were at their absolute peak!

But a strange feeling arose in Li Mo's heart.

Within the range of the military formation, he felt like an omnipotent god, able to control everything that happened within it.

This was the Inner Scene that Ying Bing had constructed for him using four thousand soldiers!

*Boom—*

Li Mo immersed himself in the grand and magnificent power of the formation. The already solidified True Spirit of Wuzhiqi stared at him with burning golden eyes.

---

With a hint of human-like desire.

Li Mo clenched his fist.

"Is it still not enough?"

...

On the command platform.

Everything happening in the training ground was witnessed by all the generals.

"It's done! The military formation can actually manifest as an Inner Scene Field!"

"If it can become an Inner Scene, what about an Outer Scene, or even a Dharma Body's Dharma Form? If the王爷 knew this method..."

Everyone was getting excited at the thought.

But Qu Sheng shook his head with a complex expression.

"This method, if outsiders can barely get some reference from it, that would be considered a success."

They finally realized.

For the Observation of the Gods Realm, to find a physique like Li Mo's, and a commander with whom he has perfect coordination and outstanding talent, is simply a fantasy.

"Brother Li still isn't ending it?" Zhong Zhenyue asked, stunned.

明明 (Míngmíng) Li Mo and Ying Bing had already successfully used the power of the military formation to manifest the Inner Scene.

Continuing on would only add unnecessary strain to his body and spirit. He had seen his father's vanguard commander, who once bore the power of ten thousand soldiers, require at least a month of rest afterward.

Zhong Ling was also confused, not knowing what the two intended to do next.

He was not alone in this.

Even the soldiers in the formation didn't know.

But military orders are as heavy as mountains. Since their commander had not given the signal to withdraw, they could only continue to maintain the formation.

Qu Sheng looked at the True Spirit shadow behind Li Mo, deep in thought.

In the field.

There was one person who knew exactly what Li Mo wanted to do!

Ying Bing lowered her eyes to look at him, seeing a gaze as resolute as a star's fire.

*When the system ranks my power, it shouldn't count the military formation into my combat power, right? After all, the formation is being controlled by her...*

This thought flashed through her mind for no apparent reason.

Ying Bing gave a barely perceptible nod.

She took out the ancient green zither from the big-headed doll's storage.

*Zheng—*

The sound of the zither flowed out, brimming with killing intent.

It added a layer of metallic resonance and rain-like killing intent to the already fervent atmosphere above the training ground.

This was one of the three tunes she had learned from Shang Qinqing.

*The Heavenly King's Break Formation Melody*

As soon as the zither notes began to sound, they poured fuel onto the fire of the killing intent within the Wind, Forest, Fire, and Mountain formation.

*Roar—*

Wuzhiqi's True Spirit swelled in size, its桀骜 (arrogant) and fierce nature fully displayed before everyone, like a true ancient fierce god descending upon the world.

This most powerful True Spirit finally, at this moment, completely acknowledged Li Mo's power.

It turned and merged into the Stone Monkey's divine pattern!

Li Mo's chest boiled with热血 (hot blood),难以自制 (hard to control).

So, he threw a punch!

*Boom—*

This punch was thrown with his pure physical body, the power from the Inner Scene gathered by four thousand soldiers, and contained Wuzhiqi's battle intent to tear down the very heavens.

*Hum—*

The Whale Breath Coral Stone, connected to the earth's veins, trembled violently, causing the ground to shake and the mountains to sway.

The purple color on it grew rapidly deeper, until a hint of crimson appeared...

It was at the moment this crimson appeared that the coral stone let out a faint cracking sound.

Seventy-Two Transformations, Perfected!

Qu Sheng looked on in astonishment, only to see the Whale Breath Coral Stone split in two.

...

PS: The flu is truly a killer, my head is splitting with pain.
