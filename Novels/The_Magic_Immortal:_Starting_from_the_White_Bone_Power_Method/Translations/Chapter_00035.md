# Chapter 35: Narrow Road Encounter

Seeing Wang Chan's flustered and helpless expression, the beauty mark woman secretly rejoiced. So this man responded better to soft approaches than hard ones—no wonder he'd been as stubborn as a rock when she'd tried to assert her authority last time.

"Don't worry, I'm quite busy these days—I might not get a day off even once a month," the beauty mark woman said, tilting her face slightly and casting a sidelong glance at Wang Chan before laughing lightly and walking away. "And I'll definitely come in disguise, under cover of night."

"..." Wang Chan stood frozen for a long while before finally muttering to himself, "Woman, you're playing with fire!"

Meanwhile, outside Cave No. 68.

Zhang Tuozi, who was sweeping the area, saw the beauty mark woman descending the mountain and couldn't help but feel disheartened. 

He'd gotten up before dawn to show off Wang Chan to Luo Bing, but... before he could even enjoy it for half a day, he was nearly depressed by the outcome. Remembering his earlier smugness, he now felt as if his face was being slapped repeatedly.

Seeing Zhang Tuozi's expression, Luo Bing approached from the courtyard, pinched the soft flesh around his waist, and giggled softly, "Still looking? She's already gone."

"Who dares to look too much? Someone like me isn't worthy," Zhang Tuozi said with a self-deprecating laugh.

"That female patrol guard is so elegant and dignified, so noble and beautiful. Who would've thought our neighbor Wang would know someone like her?" Luo Bing said enviously.

"I always thought men didn't need to be handsome, as long as they were capable," Zhang Tuozi mused. "Ah, I guess I just haven't seen enough of the world..."

"Pah! A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory," Luo Bing said, suddenly blushing as if recalling something. "Besides, how do you know Wang isn't capable? Maybe he's even better than you—"

"Ah, you shameless little—you're asking for a spanking!"

On the road from Lotus Mountain to the Black River Market, Wang Chan moved swiftly like the wind.

With his magic power channeled into his legs and the effects of his body tempering, he could run at full speed without being slower than those on horseback or riding goats. But there was no need to be so conspicuous—just slightly faster than before would suffice.

Along the way, he occasionally encountered other cultivators, though far fewer than two months prior. Most traveled in groups, rarely alone like him. 

Strangely, whenever these groups crossed paths with lone travelers like Wang Chan, they would instinctively step aside to let him pass first. 

The reason was simple—anyone daring to travel alone in these chaotic wilds either had the skills to back it up or was a fool with a death wish. Clearly, in their eyes, Wang Chan, tall and striking, belonged to the former.

Though he encountered few people on the road, Wang Chan remained vigilant, his eyes and ears alert as he advanced.

After the time it took two incense sticks to burn, Wang Chan followed the river and rounded a cliffside corner. Before he could even see what lay ahead, a scream reached his ears.

He halted abruptly and looked over. About thirty feet ahead, by the riverside bamboo grove, a burly cultivator with a bald head stood under the sunlight filtering through the leaves, his scalp gleaming.

The bald man and a lean but extremely lecherous-looking cultivator had stripped the clothes off a bloodied woman tied to a thick bamboo stalk. The woman, curvaceous and trembling, screamed in terror as the two men made beastly noises.

Noticing Wang Chan's approach, the bald man and the lecherous cultivator turned their heads in unison. 

All three froze for a moment.

"Damn it, these two bandit cultivators again," Wang Chan thought, exasperated. 

And it was the same scenario, the same script. Did all bandit cultivators have a thing for this kind of twisted performance art? Couldn’t they come up with something more sophisticated?

The only difference was that this victim was much more voluptuous than the last, though her cultivation was similarly at the early Qi Refining stage. 

As for the lecherous cultivator, he was still at the early stage but had grown slightly stronger—probably around thirty-four or thirty-five strands of magic power. Clearly, his recent pillaging had paid off.

Just like last time, Wang Chan remained motionless, his expression blank, his stance neutral.

After about ten breaths of tense silence, the lecherous cultivator grinned savagely and took a step forward as if to attack—only to be pulled back by the bald man.

"Mountains and rivers bring us together again—it must be fate. If you wish to pass, friend, go ahead without worry. We won’t stop you," the bald man said with a hearty laugh, clasping his fists.

The riverside path was only about thirty feet from the bamboo grove. At that distance, a quick dash would likely allow safe passage. 

Yet Wang Chan didn’t move. He didn’t respond either, his gaze fixed on them with cold focus. 

Strangely, though, a faint anticipation stirred in his heart—an urge to charge in and slaughter them all. But with their strength still unclear, he forced himself to suppress the impulse.

The two men exchanged uneasy glances under Wang Chan’s stare. The bald man clasped his fists again. "Since you won’t move, we’ll withdraw."

As he spoke, the bald man made to retreat.

Meanwhile, the bound woman struggled desperately, her muffled cries pleading for help. 

Wang Chan pretended not to notice.

Just then, a leaf-shaped flying artifact appeared in the sky about fifty feet above, carrying a female cultivator in green robes.

Hearing the commotion below, she had initially ignored it. But when she caught sight of the bloodied, half-naked woman bound in a humiliating pose, her icy expression darkened with fury—as if recalling something painful.

She studied the captive more closely. The woman’s voluptuous figure, now at the mercy of these bandits, would soon meet a tragic end. How pitiful. 

Wouldn’t it be better to rescue her and sell her as a furnace cauldron to those lustful male cultivators? Not only would it fetch a tidy sum, but it’d also give the woman a proper… home.

With that thought, she swiftly formed a hand seal and sent it into the leaf, which trembled before descending rapidly.

The woman had long legs and a fair neck adorned with a white jade pendant, giving her a valiant air. 

She retracted the leaf artifact with one hand. Despite being only at the peak of early Qi Refining, she dared to intervene—likely because she had some hidden advantage.

Seeing the captive’s struggles, she erupted in rage. "How bold! To commit murder and robbery in broad daylight!"

Her words immediately put the bald man and the lecherous cultivator on guard. Each slapped a low-grade protective talisman on themselves and summoned a low-grade magical artifact.

The bald man wielded a shield with sixteen phantom chains—sixteen layers of artifact restrictions. The lecherous cultivator brandished a red trident with nineteen layers.

Standing shoulder to shoulder, one defending and the other attacking, their positioning and angles revealed their seasoned teamwork.

Faced with this display, the green-robed woman grew solemn. After applying her own protective talisman, she turned to Wang Chan. "Friend, care to join forces?"

Wang Chan didn’t react. He didn’t even glance at her, his gaze still locked onto the two men—though his spiritual sense remained wary of the woman.

He couldn’t tell if she was genuinely a passerby acting chivalrously or if she was in cahoots with the bandits. What if this was a trap?

Either way, staying still and adapting to the situation was his best move. From his position, he could advance to attack or retreat to escape.

As for saving the woman… she was a stranger. There was no need to get involved.

Seeing Wang Chan’s indifference, the green-robed woman sneered deliberately, her tone mocking. "For a man to cower like this is truly pathetic."

Wang Chan narrowed his eyes but remained unmoved.
