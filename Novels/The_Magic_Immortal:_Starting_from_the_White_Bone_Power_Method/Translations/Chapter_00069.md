# Chapter 69: Only the Strong Deserve It!

Hearing the conversation between the Golden Snake Sisters, Zhang Tuozi's expression changed slightly. He then glanced at the already dead Ma Kang and finally had an epiphany.

Back when he first entered the world of cultivation, he and Ma Kang had farmed and trained together, sharing life and death experiences. Once, during a drunken conversation, he had carelessly mentioned possessing a low-grade talisman-making technique. At the time, he thought Ma Kang was too drunk to remember, and considering their friendship, he didn't dwell on it. Little did he know that momentary slip would lead to today's tragedy.

Seeing the elder Golden Snake Sister about to charge toward Cave No. 69, Zhang Tuozi, still panting heavily, urgently called out, "Elder Sister, wait!"

The elder Golden Snake Sister halted and turned to Zhang Tuozi with a dark expression, puzzled.

"You can have the low-grade talisman-making technique, but spare the cultivator next door. He's innocent," Zhang Tuozi said, his voice trembling with pain but firm.

The elder Golden Snake Sister smirked. "A prisoner like you has no right to negotiate with me."

"Then try it. If you harm the person next door, you won't get the technique," Zhang Tuozi retorted, his demeanor shifting from timid to resolute despite the poison coursing through his veins.

The Golden Snake Sisters exchanged glances. The elder sister asked, "I don't understand. Why would you risk your lives to save an outsider?"

Zhang Tuozi replied bluntly, "The Golden Snake Sisters, ranked 69th on the Wilderness Wanted List, raise mid-grade spiritual snakes—the Golden Leaf Snakes—and excel in the mid-grade divine ability, 'Golden Hook Silk.' Since my companion and I are already poisoned with Golden Hook Silk, which has reached our hearts, how can we survive?"

The younger sister chuckled. "To think a small-time rogue cultivator like you knows so much about us."

Zhang Tuozi smiled wryly. "Though I'm insignificant, I'm well-versed in the wilderness's secrets."

"You only know half the story," the elder sister said, glancing around before turning back to Zhang Tuozi. "We can withdraw the Golden Hook Silk poison. But one low-grade talisman technique only buys one life. Who will you choose?"

At this, Luo Bing, who had been despondent, suddenly perked up. Clutching Zhang Tuozi's arm, she pleaded, "Brother Zhang, I don't want to die! I'm carrying your child—I'll raise them well—"

*Sssst!*

Another low-grade golden blade shot from the younger sister's sleeve, circling Luo Bing's neck and slicing it open. Blood sprayed everywhere.

"Groveling before a man is disgusting. You deserve death!" the younger sister spat, retracting her blade.

The elder sister nodded in approval.

Blood splattered across Zhang Tuozi's face, but he didn't flinch. He merely looked at the younger sister before addressing the elder. "Spare the cultivator next door."

"You'd give up your own life?!" the elder sister exclaimed.

"The Golden Hook Silk can't be withdrawn," Zhang Tuozi said calmly. "Why lie to me?"

The younger sister laughed. "Rumors say Lotus Mountain's Zhang Tuozi is a cowardly pushover, but you're surprisingly bold."

"I've been soft all my life. Might as well be firm before I die," Zhang Tuozi replied. "Make your choice quickly. Lotus Mountain's patrols have both overt and covert teams. The covert team will arrive soon!"

The sisters exchanged uneasy glances. They had researched Lotus Mountain beforehand—while the existence of covert patrols was unconfirmed, they couldn't afford to take risks.

After a brief silence, the elder sister relented. "Fine. We'll spare your neighbor. Hand over the technique."

"Words alone mean nothing," Zhang Tuozi said.

"Then let's sign a blood contract," the elder sister offered, pulling out a crimson scroll.

"I'm no match for your schemes," Zhang Tuozi grinned. "No contract. Take me a thousand miles away. Once we're there, I'll give you the technique."

"You're trying to lure us away!" the younger sister snapped. "What if you refuse then?"

"I've never broken my word. Bet on it," Zhang Tuozi said. "But if you don't, you'll never get it."

The younger sister fumed, but the elder sister agreed. "Fine. But if you betray us, we'll hire someone to extract the technique from your mind—and then return to kill your neighbor."

As the younger sister prepared to seize Zhang Tuozi with a spell, the ground trembled. A yellow light burst from below, forming a protective dome around him, shattering her spell.

A tall, handsome figure emerged from the ground inside the dome—Wang Chan, the low-grade alchemist from next door.

"Brother Wang!" Zhang Tuozi cried. "Run! They're the Golden Snake Sisters!"

Wang Chan glanced at Luo Bing's corpse and sighed. He then activated two more mid-grade Earth Prison Talismans, reinforcing the dome.

The sisters frowned at the triple-layered defense.

Wang Chan's expression darkened as he sensed the Golden Hook Silk poison in Zhang Tuozi's heart. Unless Zhang Tuozi had a protective parasite like Qu Lian's Corpse Ghost Worm, there was no saving him.

"Impressive skills," Zhang Tuozi said weakly. "But the poison has reached my heart. Not even a god could save me now."

Wang Chan remained silent, then chanted and summoned a white lightning net, sealing Zhang Tuozi's body. The sisters gasped—a mid-grade lightning sealing technique!

"Elder Sister, what do we do?!" the younger sister panicked, retreating and activating a defensive talisman.

The elder sister made a swift decision. "Forget the gamble. Kill him, then take the hunchback to Sister Liu for soul extraction. We'll share the technique with her."

The younger sister nodded, her eyes turning serpentine as she unleashed a soul-piercing gaze at Wang Chan. But instead of collapsing, her own eyes exploded, and she fell unconscious. Her Golden Leaf Snake also went limp.

Seizing the moment, Wang Chan summoned three black needles that transformed into lightning needles. The first shattered her defense, the second broke her Golden Yuan Talisman, and the third pierced her forehead. Her snake exploded into bloody mist.

"Little Sister!" the elder sister shrieked. She summoned her own Golden Leaf Snake and prepared to attack but hesitated. Seeing Wang Chan's unyielding stance, she suddenly turned into a whirlwind and fled with her snake.

Wang Chan didn't pursue. Instead, he looted the younger sister's corpse with practiced efficiency, leaving Zhang Tuozi stunned.

As Zhang Tuozi coughed up blood, the poison flared uncontrollably. Wang Chan realized the younger sister's death had disrupted the poison's control.

"Brother Wang," Zhang Tuozi rasped. "Am I a joke?"

Wang Chan shook his head. "You're a good man."

Zhang Tuozi laughed bitterly. "My father and grandfather always said cultivation wasn't about strength but connections—to be kind and make allies. So I tried to be good. But where did it get me?!"

His face twisted in agony. "Why do good men get no rewards?!"

Wang Chan sighed.

"It wasn't until you stepped in that I understood," Zhang Tuozi whispered. "In this world... only the strong deserve it."

He handed Wang Chan his storage pouch and a blood-stained undershirt inscribed with text. With a weak chuckle, he said, "You're destined for greatness, Brother Wang. When you rise, experience the pleasures of noblewomen for me... That portrait of Lady Mo Jingchun—you kept it, didn't you? Was she... fair and plump?"

Zhang Tuozi's head lolled.

Wang Chan murmured, "I tried her... Very fair, very plump, very... satisfying."
