# Chapter 82: Battle Unending!

The divine spear pierced out again, tearing through the cosmos, heading straight for the ancient ship where Zhou Tian was, its tip unbreakable.

However, the owner of the black-gold mech inside the Mechanical War Buddha was well aware that his success depended entirely on Zhou Tian's divine abilities. Without hesitation, the massive Mechanical War Buddha rumbled into motion, extending its colossal palm. Its shoulder split open, revealing a huge jet nozzle from which purple energy surged.

Boom!

The colossal palm moved with extreme speed. The fingertips on its palm split open, revealing five clear blue gems. Undefinable fluctuations emanated from them, firmly locking onto the spear-wielding figure.

Sensing the formidable power, the Dao Master could only withdraw his spear and thrust back.

Clang!

Terrifying fluctuations surged. The spear's tip struck the center of the colossal palm, voiding space and unleashing blinding radiance from the point of impact!

Sizzle!

The five gems on the Mechanical War Buddha's colossal palm sparked with arcs of electricity. Five thick bolts of lightning struck him squarely in the face. The chaotic mist that shrouded his face dissipated, revealing an incredibly grim countenance. His snow-white hair, slightly singed and curled at the ends, flowed behind him. He wore a set of purple armor, shaped like an unknown exotic beast, with a beast's head adorning his chest, radiating an inexplicable power.

"Seeking death!"

He roared, his body expanding to ten thousand zhang tall, matching the height of the colossal Buddha. The divine spear in his hand also swelled, becoming as immense as a sky-supporting pillar.

Wielding a battle-saint technique, he closed in, his divine spear chopping down like a blade, annihilating a section of space.

The Mechanical War Buddha was no ordinary object either; it was the crystallization of the Instrument Nation's wisdom. Nine orbs behind it rotated and combined, forming a massive shield that solidly blocked the spear. Then, a gap opened in the center of the great shield, and *boom!* a giant purple energy cannon blasted forth. The Dao Master's magic power surged, and the beast head on his chest armor surprisingly came alive, swallowing the energy beam in one gulp.

The man and the colossal Mechanical Buddha engaged in battle, instantly becoming incredibly fierce. Figures were everywhere, and divine power fluctuations rippled throughout, causing chaos to churn, constantly tearing open great fissures and forming new worlds.

Cracks appeared all over the Mechanical Buddha's body, and countless bolts of lightning entwined around it. This was a world-destroying lightning tribulation, chaotic lightning interweaving densely.

The Dao Master unleashed the divine ability of three heads and six arms, boosting his combat power.

The Mechanical War Buddha then assembled a thousand arms. Its energy core hummed, and energy beams scattered in all directions.

In this great battle, both unleashed all their divine abilities, fighting desperately. Erto and Baal simply watched from the sidelines, unable to intervene. Even a slight proximity to the residual energy would tear them apart.

"Your body's burden is nearing its limit. How much longer can you sustain this?"

The powerful Dao Master unfurled a pair of wings from his back, wreathed in flames. This was a potent divine ability that not only boosted speed but also possessed immense destructive power.

With a slight tremor, two fire dragons roared forth, almost resembling true dragons, yet distinctly different.

"Heaven's Gate will also soon detect our abnormality. How much longer can you hold on?"

Inside the Mechanical War Buddha, the owner of the black-gold mech was already covered in blood, with blood seeping from his pupils, ears, and nose. The Mechanical War Buddha was a combat armor of Dao Master-level, every movement carrying immense tearing force, far beyond what he could bear. Already severely wounded, every action now was a struggle, even as his body shattered incessantly, yet he could not retreat a single step.

The lightning great hammer in his hand transformed instantly into an ice crystal hand cannon. Two intensely cold blasts erupted, freezing and shattering the two fire dragons.

With a rattling and clanking sound, the ice crystal hand cannon dissolved into countless parts. Electromagnetic energy surged, and instantly, they reassembled into a massive six-barreled machine gun. The Mechanical War Buddha hoisted the machine gun, its head gleaming.

Tat-tat-tat!

Blue light erupted from the muzzle, and energy bullets poured down like a curtain of rain, each infused with lightning power.

Behind the powerful Dao Master, his fire wings flapped, sweeping up a vast sea of flames. His wings enveloped him, serving as a shield against the storm of bullets.

While the two great powerful beings battled, Baal and the others were not idle. Although they couldn't intervene in such high-level combat, they could certainly harass the tortoise-shell formation formed by the eight ancient ships.

The golden light array vibrated unceasingly. Holy flames burned, and countless departed souls roared, extending skeletal arms to strike the array. Thick bolts of lightning and corrosive shadow energy assailed it.

Although this golden light array was a Heavenly King-level formation, under the simultaneous assault of four Heavenly Kings, it was teetering.

Wei Chuan's grandfather, the Purple-robed Daoist, and the White-robed Assassin were all severely wounded and preoccupied with their own safety, utterly unable to help them.

Whoosh whoosh whoosh!

Four missiles, emitting terrifying fluctuations, flew towards Baal and his group. It was the Mechanical War Buddha, having discovered their predicament, that had extended a helping hand.

However, before they could show delight, the bronze divine spear swept across the sky—

Bang! Bang! Bang! Bang!

All four missiles were pierced and exploded. Reaching out, the Dao Master caught the returning divine spear with a cold snort, his fire wings flapping as he surged forward.

"You'd best look out for yourself first!"

On the deck, Zhou Xunchuan frowned deeply. Cracks had already appeared in the formation; it was only a matter of time before it was breached.

He looked up at the nearby Land of the Forsaken Gods, then back at the endless void storm behind them, and said in a deep voice, "We can only enter the Land of the Forsaken Gods. The path back is too far, and Heaven's Gate hasn't detected anything unusual yet. Any further delay means waiting for death!"

"We have to take a gamble. We've been preparing for a long time in the Land of the Forsaken Gods; we have strongholds to fight from!" Zhou Ying chimed in, agreeing. This time, their bait strategy was actually very well-prepared, with eight Saint King-level masters accompanying them, making it practically foolproof. However, they hadn't expected the Divine Blight to contact star-realm powers. They didn't know what price had been paid, but it was enough to invite two Heavenly Venerates to smuggle a Dao Master into the Nine Provinces, and even bring a formation capable of concealing them from Heaven's Gate's detection. It could be said that a significant portion of an entire power's accumulated heritage had been used.

Decisive action was taken. Zhou Xunchuan informed the others on the ancient ships of his suggestion, and as they were also prodigies, their thoughts almost perfectly aligned.

Zhou Xunchuan's fingers moved lightly, tracing several runes. The ancient ship vibrated, and three beast-hide sails ignited with golden flames. This was a sacrifice for speed. The other ancient ships also employed similar methods.

Boom!

The eight ancient ships advanced and retreated in unison, suddenly exerting force and bursting forth with unmatched speed. The myriad divine chains wrapped around the external formation shattered, completely breaking free from their restraints, and headed towards the Land of the Forsaken Gods.

"How dare you!"

Baal roared in fury, his six pairs of feathered wings shaking incessantly, feathers drifting. A wreath made of branches appeared in his hand. Although it was merely woven from branches and only had a few green leaves, it exuded an incomparably holy aura. Shadok, the Shadow God Lord, frowned and moved a little further away.

Baal slowly put it on. Sacred hymns resonated, and countless angels appeared around him. A white-robed figure materialized behind him, arms outstretched as if embracing the world.
