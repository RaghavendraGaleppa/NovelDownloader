# Chapter 235 Guest Alchemist  

Li Yuanba sat atop the mountain peak, facing east as a sliver of red light emerged from the horizon.  

Instantly, 1,500 Fresnel mirrors reflected the first rays of sunlight onto his body. The "Purple Qi from the East" technique absorbed the innate purple energy, transforming his physique.  

He had been cultivating "Purple Qi from the East" for over a month now, and the changes to his Dao Body were remarkable.  

The "Sword Demon Codex" body-refining technique utilized the third-grade sword foundation to influence and strengthen his Dao Body, but such an intense method inevitably left some damage. After a month of continuously absorbing the innate purple energy, the damage to his Dao Body had nearly vanished.  

His spirit was also steadily growing—a noticeable improvement. He believed that with a little more time, he could attempt to cultivate the "Thousand Refinements Spirit Forging Art" to advance his spiritual sense into divine sense ahead of schedule.  

These changes mirrored those of his main body's cultivation of "Purple Qi from the East," so they weren't entirely unexpected.  

The true surprise was a unique transformation in Li Yuanba—the evolution of his sword intent.  

His main body, Li Shiming, cultivated thunder techniques, nurturing Five-Element Thunder spiritual power within him, which imbued his sword intent with a thunderous effect.  

Li Yuanba's sword intent, however, absorbed the supreme yang energy from the innate purple qi, granting it a demon-dispelling effect.  

This development was somewhat ironic.  

As a disciple of the Netherworld Sect—a demonic sect—his sword intent now carried a purifying effect, making it more righteous than even orthodox righteous sects.  

Of course, while the demon-dispelling effect countered yin-cold energy and suppressed demonic cultivators, it was also highly effective against ordinary techniques.  

After all, the supreme yang energy, though only a trace was present, influenced all energies it encountered—though the degree of effect varied depending on the amount of yang energy infused in the sword intent.  

Li Yuanba had informed his master, Sword Elder, that he needed at least a year of secluded cultivation. Thus, Sword Elder wouldn't disturb him with sect missions.  

This was a period of relative stability. Both Li Yuanba and his main body, Li Shiming, were under the protection of their masters, shielding them from external disturbances.  

Li Shiming had begun accepting private alchemy commissions within the Shu Mountain Sect. These requests came from disciples connected to his master, Elder Su. Other sect members had no chance to meet him, let alone request his services.  

One day, Elder Su summoned him to Tianmu Peak.  

Once again, they met in the pavilion. This time, Elder Su was already standing there, accompanied by an unfamiliar cultivator.  

Li Shiming's spiritual sense was exceptionally strong, and since the stranger wasn't concealing his cultivation, he could tell the man was at the early Golden Core stage. However, there was something peculiar about his aura—something Li Shiming couldn't quite place.  

"Greetings, Master!" Li Shiming stepped forward and bowed.  

"Shiming, this is Fellow Daoist Cai Hong from the Northern Shu Trading Company. I'm merely introducing you—you two can discuss matters directly." Elder Su glanced at his disciple with slight embarrassment before turning to leave.  

However, Li Shiming heard his master's voice transmitted directly into his ear:  

"Shiming, this is a personal favor. I'm only facilitating this meeting—the outcome doesn't matter. Don't feel pressured on my account."  

Li Shiming maintained a polite smile, but inwardly, he understood that the Northern Shu Trading Company must have learned of his alchemy skills and sent someone to recruit him.  

The Northern Shu Trading Company was the largest merchant guild on the continent, spanning even the Heavenly Sea Islands. Maintaining a good relationship with such an organization would only benefit him, so he wasn't opposed to this meeting.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, I apologize for the sudden visit," Cai Hong said with a bow once Elder Su had left.  

The Northern Shu Trading Company's vast influence relied heavily on its extensive network.  

Upon discovering Li Shiming's rapid rise, the company had immediately dispatched Cai Hong—the nearest high-ranking manager to the Shu Mountain Sect.  

Their urgency stemmed from the fear that Li Shiming might sign an exclusive contract with a rival guild, which would be a significant loss for them.  

Since becoming an alchemist, Li Shiming had only crafted pills for the sect and a select few individuals. Yet, according to the company's investigations, he had never failed a single commission—regardless of the pill's grade—and maintained a 100% success rate for high-grade pills.  

The company's analysts unanimously agreed that Li Shiming was destined to become an alchemy master—one with exceptionally high productivity.  

While many alchemy traditions included techniques for simultaneous multi-cauldron refining, such methods were typically limited to low-grade pills.  

Even high-level alchemists could only use such techniques when refining first-grade pills.  

For second-grade pills, attempting multi-cauldron refining would lead to a drastic drop in success rate and quality.  

Yet, the company's investigations revealed that Li Shiming employed multi-cauldron refining even for mid-to-late Foundation Establishment second-grade pills—otherwise, he couldn't possibly complete such large orders in such short timeframes.  

Li Shiming was precisely the kind of alchemist the Northern Shu Trading Company needed—one who could significantly boost their pill business.  

"Senior, there's no need for such courtesy. May I ask what brings you here?" Li Shiming returned the greeting with a smile.  

"Please, just call me Fellow Daoist. 'Senior' is too much for me," Cai Hong replied with a wry smile, noticing Li Shiming's confusion. He added, "My Golden Core realm is actually a 'False Core.'"  

"What is a False Core?" Li Shiming wasn't in a hurry to discuss business. Instead, he seized the opportunity to learn something new.  

"A False Core is a last resort for those who can't break through to the Golden Core realm. It involves refining a great demon's Golden Core into one's own through a secret technique, granting some Golden Core power. However, once formed, a False Core can never advance further—it's a permanent state," Cai Hong explained.  

"Does it have to be a great demon's core? Can a cultivator's Golden Core be used?" Li Shiming pressed.  

He wasn't considering this path for himself. Even if his talent had been lacking, his Dao Body—enhanced by "Purple Qi from the East"—had forcibly elevated his aptitude to genius levels.  

His interest stemmed from the two Golden Cores stored in his machine room space. Until now, he hadn't found a use for them. Hearing about this application piqued his curiosity.  

"Using a cultivator's Golden Core is possible, but that's the domain of demonic cultivators. Even among them, those who dare to form a False Core this way risk rejection by the demonic Golden Core," Cai Hong answered honestly, eager to build rapport.  

The two conversed in the pavilion, with Cai Hong sharing esoteric knowledge of the cultivation world and Li Shiming asking questions.  

After finishing a pot of spirit tea, Cai Hong set down his cup and carefully chose his words.  

"Fellow Daoist Li, I assume you're familiar with the Northern Shu Trading Company. On behalf of the company, I'd like to invite you to become a guest alchemist," he said solemnly.  

"What does being a guest alchemist entail?" Li Shiming set down his cup and inquired.  

Cai Hong's spirits lifted—the lack of immediate refusal meant there was hope.  

"The guest alchemist position has no obligations—otherwise, the Shu Mountain Sect wouldn't have allowed this meeting. The company offers an annual stipend of 100,000 spirit stones, and guest alchemists receive priority access to the company's resources," Cai Hong explained with a smile.  

"Such generous terms—what would be expected in return?" Li Shiming asked. Though he wasn't impressed by the 100,000 spirit stones, the priority access to resources intrigued him.  

As the largest merchant guild in the Northern Shu Continent, the company controlled vast resources—including third-grade materials.  

Take the third-grade "Shepherd Sun Three-Leaf Grass," for example. He had once risked his life to retrieve it.  

Had Elder Ji's faction not preemptively purchased the herb, the Northern Shu Trading Company had it in stock.  

This alone demonstrated the company's immense resources.  

"Guest alchemists may choose whether or not to refine pills for the company at their discretion. The company won't interfere with private commissions, but guest alchemists cannot serve other guilds. Additionally, compensation for company commissions matches private rates," Cai Hong clarified.  

Li Shiming finally understood: guest alchemists were exclusively tied to the Northern Shu Trading Company but weren't obligated to take on their work.  

The company's pill orders far outnumbered private commissions, and matching private rates served as an incentive.  

"I accept," Li Shiming said after some thought. He had no intention of working with other guilds anyway.  

Previously, Zhuo Rui from the Tianmu Trading Company had approached him. However, the company's limited resources couldn't sustain his refining capacity, making collaboration impossible.  

Tianmu was an internal sect guild—it couldn't even guarantee sufficient second-grade pill materials, let alone compete with the Northern Shu Trading Company.  

"On behalf of the Northern Shu Trading Company, I welcome you, Fellow Daoist Li. This is your guest identity token. The company collaborates with major sects—this token enables communication across the entire Northern Shu Continent.  

"You can also view pill commissions at any time. Once you accept a task, materials will be delivered, and finished products will be collected by designated personnel," Cai Hong said excitedly, handing over a jade token.  

The token had been prepared in advance, with all formalities completed beforehand to avoid complications.  

The Northern Shu Trading Company, though the largest, faced fierce competition from rival guilds.  

"This is a small gift from the company. Another will follow once you become an alchemy master," Cai Hong added, offering a storage pouch.  

"Thank you," Li Shiming said with a smile, accepting both items.  

A scan with his spiritual sense revealed a pill formula and dozens of jade boxes containing spirit herbs.  

The formula was for the Mountain-Shattering Pill—different from the Netherworld Sect's version. His clone, Li Yuanba, had also received a Mountain-Shattering Pill formula and materials.  

Li Shiming knew that while pill names might be the same across sects, the actual formulas varied due to regional resource differences, resulting in distinct refining systems after centuries of research.  

The Netherworld Sect's Mountain-Shattering Pill relied heavily on materials from the Endless Mountains—particularly a third-grade herb exclusive to the region.  

The formula itself wasn't particularly valuable—countless variations existed. Without access to specific resources, gathering the required ingredients was nearly impossible.  

The real prize was the complete set of materials, including the third-grade main herb—a genuine Golden Core resource.  

The company's generosity was evident. Among breakthrough resources, the Mountain-Shattering Pill was the most crucial.  

Meridian Protection Pills could be substituted with specialized techniques to strengthen meridians.  

Mind-Calming Pills could be replaced with spirit items that stabilized the mind. Revival Pills had inferior alternatives.  

But the Mountain-Shattering Pill was irreplaceable.  

Centuries of experience showed that missing any one pill reduced the chances of forming a Golden Core. Thus, cultivators aimed to gather a complete set before attempting a breakthrough.  

Seeing Li Shiming's satisfied smile after inspecting the gift, Cai Hong relaxed.  

Selecting the gift hadn't been easy. He had even worried that the Mountain-Shattering Pill materials might not impress Li Shiming.  

This wasn't paranoia—Li Shiming's potential and status demanded careful consideration.  

Many knew Li Shiming was Elder Ma's nominal disciple, but few were aware that Elder Ma had imparted the "Shu Mountain Alchemy Codex" to him.  

Mastering the codex implied Li Shiming possessed spirit fire and Elder Ma's endorsement of his potential as an alchemy master.  

Any sect would heavily invest in such talent, sparing no expense on breakthrough resources.  

Cai Hong was relieved that his timing had been perfect—the Shu Mountain Sect evidently hadn't provided Li Shiming with breakthrough resources yet, or the gift's value would have diminished.  

In truth, he had anticipated this. At Li Shiming's early mid-Foundation Establishment stage, the sect wouldn't have prepared such resources so soon—making the Mountain-Shattering Pill materials an ideal choice.
