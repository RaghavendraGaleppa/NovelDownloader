# Chapter 2: The Ultimate Friendship System!

Hearing the system notification in his mind, Lin Yun was momentarily stunned.

Finally, his day had come!

Wuwu┭┮﹏┭┮!!

Twenty years!

Do you know how I've suffered these twenty years?!

After enduring hardships comes sweetness!

Sweetness at last!

Lin Yun had finally waited for this day!

Lin Yun was a transmigrator, though it would be more accurate to say he was a reincarnator with memories of his past life. When he first learned he was in the Yue Kingdom, he was thrilled, thinking he had returned to the Spring and Autumn period. He was ready to make his mark, crushing Goujian under his palm and conquering Xi Shi—until he realized this Yue Kingdom was just a tiny bit different from the one he knew!

As Lin Yun grew older and began reading books, he discovered this Yue Kingdom had neither Goujian nor Xi Shi. Instead, there were places like Jianzhou, Lanzhou, and Jingzhou...

What were these?

Scratching his head in confusion at these unfamiliar geographical names, Lin Yun later encountered a wandering Taoist who visited his home. The Taoist claimed Lin Yun had spiritual roots suitable for cultivation and took him away, giving him the Taoist name "Qingwen."

Through the old Taoist, Lin Yun learned about the cultivation world—the Seven Sects of Yue Kingdom, Yellow Maple Valley, Moon Mask Sect, and Sky Fortress—and realized he had been reborn into the world of "A Record of a Mortal's Journey to Immortality."

From the age of eight when he began cultivating to now at twenty-three, fifteen long years had passed!

Fifteen years! How many fifteen-year spans does a person even have? He had already wasted one!

If you're not heartbroken, brother, I certainly am!

Later, his master passed away, and Lin Yun became a resident Taoist at Ox-Lying Mountain.

As a transmigrator, Lin Yun naturally had his own golden finger—the "Ultimate Friendship System." By befriending others, he could draw rewards from them. The quality of the rewards varied, sometimes good, sometimes bad, and Lin Yun had no control over it. Moreover, the rewards weren’t necessarily what the person currently possessed; they could also be things they might obtain in the future.

When the system first awakened, Lin Yun was overjoyed. In his grand plan, he would reach Foundation Establishment in three years, Core Formation in five, Nascent Soul in ten, Soul Transformation in fifteen, and ascend to the Spirit Realm in twenty!

But ideals are beautiful, while reality is brutally harsh! Despite Lin Yun's efforts to build connections and earn an excellent reputation among rogue cultivators, a rogue cultivator was still just a rogue cultivator. The only friends a rogue cultivator could make were other rogue cultivators!

The rewards Lin Yun obtained from them were extremely limited—mostly just a couple of spirit stones. Getting a single spirit herb or a mid-grade magical artifact was like hitting the jackpot!

But today, he had obtained an immortal artifact from Old Man Han!

At this moment, Lin Yun finally understood the saying more deeply: "The heights you reach in life are directly tied to the company you keep."

From now on, Han Li, you are my sworn brother, my closest friend!

Aside from the unexpected joy of obtaining the Mystic Heaven Gourd, there was also the Ascension Token. With this token in hand, Lin Yun could finally enter the Seven Sects and befriend the disciples of major sects—drawing rewards from them!

Top-tier magical artifacts! Talisman treasures! Magic treasures! Here I come, Lin Yun!

The "friendship" criteria of the Ultimate Friendship System were simple. All it took was verbal acknowledgment from the other party—no actual effort required from Lin Yun.

"Woo-hoo~! Time to soar!"

"Fellow Daoist Lin?!" Han Li called out loudly, snapping Lin Yun out of his daze.

"Ah? Haha! My apologies! I felt an instant connection with you, Little Brother Han, and got lost in thought." Lin Yun laughed, masking his awkwardness.

Han Li eyed Lin Yun suspiciously. Due to Mo Juren's persecution, he had developed a bit of PTSD and now viewed everyone with distrust.

"Haha—Fellow Daoist Han, no need to be so tense. Brother Lin is just a warm-hearted person. All us rogue cultivators know his reputation—that’s why we joined his group," another rogue cultivator chimed in.

Han Li nodded.

"Is everyone in your group here?" Han Li glanced around and changed the subject.

"No, there are two more. One is off playing around, and the other is deep in slumber due to his cultivation technique," Lin Yun explained.

After some more small talk, Lin Yun took the initiative.

"Little Brother Han, since you're new to the Tai Nan Gathering, let me take some time to show you around. Don’t be fooled by the many stalls—most of what they sell is useless, just flashy trinkets."

"Also, the currency we cultivators use is called spirit stones. They’re extremely precious among rogue cultivators, and most people don’t have many, so bartering is common."

"That just makes it easier for swindlers to take advantage."

"If you want to buy anything later, I can help you assess it so you don’t get scammed."

Lin Yun enthusiastically left his group and approached Han Li.

Han Li hesitated. He preferred to act alone, and though Lin Yun seemed friendly, having someone shadow him was uncomfortable. Yet, he couldn’t outright refuse.

Lin Yun’s advice made sense—Han Li had no idea about the value of items here and was vulnerable to scams. He had never even heard of spirit stones before.

If he stuck with Lin Yun, he could also gather more knowledge about the cultivation world.

After weighing his options, Han Li nodded in agreement.

Lin Yun waved to Hu Pinggu and the others. "Fellow Daoists, go on ahead. I’ll show Little Brother Han around and bring him back later."

The other rogue cultivators exchanged glances. They knew Lin Yun was sociable, but they hadn’t expected him to be this attentive to a complete novice.

Still, they said nothing—it was Lin Yun’s business.

As the groups parted, Han Li clasped his hands. "I’ve troubled you, Fellow Daoist Lin, wasting your time on my account."

"Ah, don’t be so formal! Little Brother Han, I feel like we’re brothers from another mother!"

"If you don’t mind, call me Brother Lin, and I’ll take the liberty of calling you Brother Han. How’s that?"

Han Li wasn’t sure why Lin Yun was so eager, but a closer relationship would make it easier to gather information. He nodded.

"Then I’ll trouble you, Brother Lin."

[Ding! Han Li’s favorability +1.]

[Host obtained Yellow Dragon Pills ×5, Golden Marrow Pills ×5.]

"Brother Han, no need for formalities—we’re family now." Lin Yun smiled faintly.

"Let’s walk and browse."

The two then strolled through the Tai Nan Gathering.
