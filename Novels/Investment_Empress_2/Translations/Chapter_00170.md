# Chapter 170: Don't Be Afraid, I'm Not a Good Person

At the border between the Donghuang Domain and the Ningcang Domain.

Crossing the border and moving further ahead, one would reach the famous Jinghai Dense Forest. It was the final county city before entering Yunzhou from Zhongshenzhou. Many traveling merchants and wandering martial artists would rest here, making it quite a sizable settlement.

The wind picked up.

The rustling of endless leaves truly sounded like the waves of the sea.

Senior Brother Shen Yunfei's hometown was here. It was a large, three-entry courtyard house.

The arrival of the Clear Abyss Sect members was naturally met with a warm reception by the Shen family.

At this moment, Shen Yunfei was introducing his junior brothers and sisters to his parents.

"This is Junior Brother Ouyang. The chief disciple of Ruyi Peak, he not only possesses formidable strength but also has exquisite painting skills."

"Greetings, Uncle."

Ouyang bowed and then pulled a picture album from his sleeve. "Uncle, I heard you are in the book business. I have a picture album here..."

"We can discuss business matters later," Shen Yunfei said, lightly coughing and lowering his voice as he introduced, "By the way, this is Li... Huh? Where are they?"

"They went to interrogate those assassins," Ouyang replied.

"The 'Storm Approaching' Order..."

Shen Yunfei frowned and sighed. "Whenever this order appears, it signifies that the Drizzle Tower has grand ambitions. Junior Brother Li probably won't get anything out of them."

Most assassins from the Drizzle Tower would rather die than reveal the tower's secrets. Once they become traitors, their fate would be worse than death.

Ouyang nodded and said, "That's why Junior Brother Li has Pu... Pu what? Oh, Plan B."

"What is Plan B..."

"It's the second plan."

Ouyang lowered his voice, gesturing for a few junior brothers to come closer. As he spoke, he couldn't help but let out a strange, cackling laugh.

The more they listened, the stranger their expressions became.

Not far away, Shen's father and mother exchanged a glance.

"Dear, the Clear Abyss Sect is a righteous sect, right?" Mrs. Shen asked worriedly.

Mr. Shen scratched his head. "I thought so..."

He recalled the "Overbearing Empress Falls for Me" that Ouyang had slipped him, and the strange, burly men who had just been tied up and dragged into the woodshed with cloth stuffed in their mouths, looking like they had been kidnapped.

Old Shen felt a little uneasy.

Just then, Shen Yunfei walked over. "Father, we'll need you two to cooperate with us later."

"Huh?"

...

Inside the woodshed.

Li Mo sat on a stool drinking tea, while Ying Bing stood at the door, holding her sword.

"So you're the Blood-Handed Vulture? You kill one person and lose a hair; you've plucked all your hair and eyebrows clean. Does that mean you've killed countless people?" Li Mo said righteously.

"This... Actually... Actually, when I was soaking in a medicinal bath, I mistook the body-tempering potion for hair removal cream, which is why my hair and eyebrows fell out," the Blood-Handed Vulture said sheepishly.

"And you? The Blind-Eyed Absolute Blade? Your reputation in the black market is quite loud; whoever you see dies?"

"My eyes are prone to... congenital dry eye syndrome. When the wind is strong, I can't help but squint."

"The Jade-Faced Flying Dragon, I heard you even dared to intercept the birthday tribute of the King of the South? You're quite arrogant."

Li Mo, not having a big-headed doll to slam, simply slapped the table with his hand.

The Jade-Faced Flying Dragon lowered his head. "How would I dare touch the King of the South's birthday tribute? When running in the Jianghu, one needs a decent story to their name..."

Li Mo's mouth twitched. These guys could actually be mistaken for mass murderers? It seems every organization has its mix of good and bad, even the Drizzle Tower is no exception.

"The Clear Abyss Sect upholds justice for a prefecture and shares no ground with evil. What are the Drizzle Tower's plans in Yunzhou, and for what purpose? You will confess honestly. Considering your sins are not deep, I might show leniency."

As his words fell, the assassins exchanged glances, all extremely hesitant.

The assassin wrapped head-to-toe in bandages snorted coldly. "Daring to interrogate us, you yellow-mouthed brat? Kill or slice us, do as you please! Otherwise, when the experts from our tower arrive, you will all be buried without a grave!"

As an emotionless assassin, being tied up in such a manner was a profound humiliation!

The others also had flushed faces, filled with indignation.

Huh?

Ying Bing's gaze swept over, seeming unfriendly.

They became honest. But they still exchanged glances, not daring to speak. It was fine to mess around in the tower, but if they leaked secrets, their fate would be worse than being killed by Li Mo—at least that would be a quick end.

"Since you are stubbornly unrepentant..."

Li Mo patted his sleeves, stood up, walked to the door, and made a gesture to Ying Bing. Then, he walked outside.

Ying Bing, expressionless, drew the Frost Sword and walked over slowly.

Looking at the young girl, the assassins felt a hint of regret. The Jade-Faced Flying Dragon was so scared he started crying, shaking his head frantically.

But at that moment—

*Clang, clang, bang!*

The sound of a fight suddenly erupted from outside, mixed with voices.

"Who are you?!" It was Li Mo's voice.

"Heh heh, someone here to take your life."

It was a deep, bubbly voice.

Sensing something was wrong, Ying Bing also flew out.

*Boom—*

*Bang, bang—*

*Crackle and pop—*

...

The entire courtyard seemed to have fallen into a fierce battle.

Not long after, a hammer flew through the air and smashed the main gate to pieces.

A man in a black robe, holding a strange short-handled hammer, stood there. Surrounded by a sharp, killing aura, his presence was incredibly fierce and terrifying.

"Don't be afraid, I'm not a good person," he said in a deep voice.

"May I ask who you are..."

"The Hammer King of the Northwest."

The man took out a 'Hall前燕' (Hall Swallow) token to prove his identity.

"What about outside..."

"Taken care of. Let's go quickly."

*Clang—*

The Crimson Sky Sword was thrown to the ground, motionless, as if its spirit had been lost.

The Blood-Handed Vulture was greatly shocked. When did the tower produce such a powerful new member? Even that terrifyingly strong, cold少女 was no match for him? But the Hall Swallow token was undeniably real!

The others no longer doubted. After the Hammer King of the Northwest undid their restraints, they followed him.

Midway, the Clear Abyss Sect disciples stepped forward to block them.

"Arrogant fool, don't think you can leave!"

Ouyang was the first to rush forward to block him.

Then he was sent flying with a single hammer strike.

*Pfft—*

He spat out a mouthful of blood, fell to the ground, and his limbs twitched. It looked like he couldn't be saved.

The Clear Abyss Sect disciples who tried to block him were not even a match for a single hammer strike!

Soon, they escaped into the Jinghai Dense Forest. The forest stretched for a thousand miles. Without a guide, it was impossible to navigate. By twisting and turning, they could evade any pursuit.

Finally, they followed the Hammer King of the Northwest to a safe place.

"Brother Hammer King, thank you for your rescue," the Blood-Handed Vulture said, bowing with immense gratitude. A ruthless character like this, once he grew up, would probably be no less formidable than the Heavenly Demon Saintess. If they could cling to this big thigh...

"We are colleagues in the tower, no need for thanks. I was just passing through," the Hammer King of the Northwest said calmly.

He then spoke quite naturally, "By the way, are you going to Yunzhou? Did something happen in the tower?"

"Brother Hammer King, you didn't know?" the Jade-Faced Flying Dragon asked, puzzled. A ruthless character like this would be a core figure in any branch tower. He shouldn't be unaware of the 'Storm Approaching' Order.

"I was the champion of the Wujian Trial in Ziyang Prefecture. The Ziyang branch tower was destroyed, and I haven't found the organization since."

"I see."

They had all heard of the incident in Ziyang Prefecture and looked at him with sympathy.

"If it weren't for that Shang Wu, Brother Hammer King, you would have already risen to great heights."

Recalling their own experiences, the Blood-Handed Vulture and the others were filled with rage.

The Hammer King of the Northwest nodded and actually let out an indignant cold snort. "That Shang Wu, she humiliated me several times and beat me up repeatedly! She even unleashed her Inner Scenery Domain, beating me while roasting me over a fire!"

"Even... even forced me to cook for her!"

The group: "!!!"

That's too tragic, isn't it? An assassin reduced to cooking for someone and getting beaten up every day. It was enough to make anyone who heard it sad and anyone who saw it cry. What was even more惊人 was that after falling into the hands of that female demon, Brother Hammer King had actually managed to escape alive?

Right then and there, the empathetic group felt an urge to swear brotherhood with the Hammer King of the Northwest.

"Brother Hammer King, don't panic. Once you return to the organization, you are bound to soar to the heavens. Then you can personally wash away your耻辱!"

And so, in the接下来, the group poured out everything they knew like beans from a bamboo tube. This included the locations of the Yunzhou Drizzle Tower branches, the experts from the tower who had gone to Yunzhou that they knew of...

Finally, the Blood-Handed Massacre added regretfully, "Brother Hammer King, you killed that Clear Abyss Sect Li Mo, but it's a pity you didn't leave any proof. Otherwise, you could have claimed the bounty, which would have been a handsome sum of silver."

"Oh?" The Hammer King of the Northwest seemed intrigued. "That Li Mo has a bounty on his head? Is he worth a lot?"

"Indeed, but..." The Blind-Eyed Absolute Blade advised, "The county is already under martial law. The garrison troops have probably arrived. If we go back now, it might be too late."

"That's right, it's too late."

"By the way, is that Li Mo dead or not?"

"It's a pity. I wanted to finish him off myself."

...

The group was brimming with killing intent, a complete change from their previous pitiful and helpless demeanor.

But then the Hammer King of the Northwest in front of them laughed. "No need for the trouble. Why go back to look for him?"

The group of murderers and assassins froze.

He took off the Azure Dragon Iron Mask and removed the Phaseless Gauze, smiling. "Meeting again, is it a surprise, is it unexpected?"

As his words fell, the senior brothers and sisters of the Clear Abyss Sect also emerged from the forest, including the 'severely injured and dead' Ouyang.

...

The dense forest fell into a dead silence.

This Hammer King of the Northwest was none other than Li Mo.

The group's scalps went numb, their eyes wide with shock.

How... how could this be a sting operation?
