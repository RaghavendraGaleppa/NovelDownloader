#73, Yellow Turban Warrior

"Halt, traveler."

On the mountain road, a horse-drawn carriage approached, accompanied by over a hundred people, their attire disheveled but their demeanor imposing. Tang Jing stepped forward, his hand grasping the hilt of his sword, "The Seven Mystic Gate lies ahead; outsiders are not permitted to pass."

Tang Jing's brow furrowed, his lips pursed. Beside him, four members of the Seven Mystic Gate advanced, their hands on the hilts of their swords. These individuals were clearly members of the Sea Sand Gang, and their presence here today indicated that their leader was on the mountain. Otherwise, they would have clashed with the gate's disciples long before reaching this point.

A burly man emerged from the rear of the carriage, a sword in hand, and strode forward with an air of nonchalance, a hint of a smile on his face. "Brothers of the Seven Mystic Gate, we come bearing gifts for your esteemed gate."

He gestured toward the carriage, where a compartment was tightly sealed, its contents unknown. "This is a letter from our leader."

Tang Jing's expression remained taut, his eyes narrowing slightly as he signaled to his companions not to advance. He stepped forward, halting about three meters from the man, and accepted the letter. For a moment, he was too engrossed in examining the letter to notice the man's eyes, which held a mixture of impatience and mockery.

"This is the Seven Mystic Gate; we do not recognize your leader's handwriting." Tang Jing's voice was firm, his eyes scanning the letter. "If you are here to pay your respects, you may all stay here, and we will report your visit."

"However, you may not all proceed; leave eighty of your people here, and the rest may ascend."

Upon opening the letter, Tang Jing's countenance changed, his face darkening in anger. "What is the meaning of this?"

The letter was blank, devoid of any writing, not even a token gesture of courtesy. It was simply a piece of white silk.

As Tang Jing's anger flared, he cocked his head, his ears picking up the sound of a scuffle in the distance. With his acute hearing, he detected the unmistakable clash of steel on steel.

"What's going on?"

Before he could finish speaking, the burly man lunged at him, sword flashing in the light. Tang Jing, anticipating the attack, swiftly parried the blow and bellowed, "Alert, we are under attack!"

Unbeknownst to Tang Jing, the same scenario was unfolding at all twelve entrances to the Seven Mystic Gate, with attackers targeting the guards at each wooden bridge.

The surrounding areas were swarming with Sea Sand Gang members, who were launching a full-scale assault on the gate. Parts of the gate were already embroiled in fierce battles.

Lei Wangniu, a renowned expert, clashed with Tang Jing. The latter, outmatched, fell to Lei's blade in less than three exchanges. The other three gate members, sensing danger, fled across the wooden bridge, severing it behind them, leaving a chasm of over ten meters, with a precipice stretching a thousand feet below.

The bridge's destruction did not faze Lei Wangniu. He picked up the blank letter and calmly wiped the blood from his blade. The men behind him surged forward, revealing crates filled with silver and, more crucially, black talisman papers shaped like warriors.

As they extracted the talisman warriors, Lei Wangniu cut his palm and applied the blood to the talisman's forehead, incanting, "Ding chou yan wo shou, ding hai ju wo hun, qi jia qi ding, ji ji ru yu lu, qi!"

Upon completing the incantation, Lei Wangniu stepped back, a fervent glow on his face. The talisman warrior began to take form, its body materializing into a gigantic being, ten zhang in height, known as the Yellow Turban Warrior.

The Yellow Turban Warrior, devoid of facial features, moved mechanically toward the chasm, eventually falling and forming a makeshift bridge. The Seven Mystic Gate disciples on the opposite side, terrified by the apparition, fled in panic.

Meanwhile, Meng Wei Zhi had retained Li Zhi Ming, intending to discuss Han La's matter, but Li Zhi Ming, observing Meng's busy schedule, chose to remain silent, awaiting a more opportune moment.

The initiation ceremony for Li Zhi Ming and Han La had concluded, marking their transition to adulthood within the sect. Meng Wei Zhi had other matters to attend to, including a meeting with Su Zong Guang, the leader of the Sea Sand Gang, who had brought his followers to the Seven Mystic Gate.

Su Zong Guang proposed a friendly competition between the two sects, to which Meng Wei Zhi agreed, suggesting that each side present a representative. Su Zong Guang, however, proposed a different arrangement, presenting a disheveled, ugly man known as the Golden Light Reverend, who exuded an air of arrogance.

Meng Wei Zhi scrutinized the Golden Light Reverend, attempting to discern his abilities, but found nothing remarkable about him. Su Zong Guang's confidence in the Reverend's prowess was evident, and Meng Wei Zhi wondered if the Reverend was indeed as skilled as claimed.

"Is Su Zong Guang this confident?" Meng Wei Zhi mused, a hint of a smile on his lips. "However, expertise in Taoist rituals does not necessarily translate to proficiency in martial arts."
