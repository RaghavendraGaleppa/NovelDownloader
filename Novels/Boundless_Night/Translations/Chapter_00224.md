# Chapter 224: The Major Event Shaking the Night Mist World (Merged Chapter)

The thick night mist was like viscous ink, dyeing the entire world. The cities on the land were like scattered candle flames, dotting the darkness.

Today, unusual birds constantly took flight between the various candle-lit cities, flying back and forth, delivering the latest news. All letters were marked with a bloody symbol, indicating urgency and severity.

The disappearance of Grandmaster-level figures swept through the lands like a hurricane, an impact immeasurable!

The entire Night Mist World was in an uproar.

In every city, people were sleepless. From initial disbelief to shock, the clamor and uproar threatened to tear apart the night sky.

This was like a super earthquake, shattering all previous tranquility.

From the leaders of major sects to peddlers and porters, everyone knew of this news and was discussing it.

Soon, after the initial shock, the high-ranking members of some major powers felt a strong unease.

At what level did that small group of vanished individuals stand? Roughly speaking, they all stood at the very peak.

Among them were newly rising powerhouses and veteran Grandmasters, each more formidable and legendary than the last, capable of forging new paths.

Even such figures were lost in the Kunling region, possibly annihilated. This was no longer a simple battle defeat; its profound impact could dictate the overall direction of the Night Mist World.

Within the imperial dynasties and great sects, many high-ranking officials went from initial bewilderment to utter terror, unable to sit or sleep peacefully.

How many years had passed without such a major event? Even the most recent Grand Reclamation hadn't started so tragically, had it?

The most crucial point was that no one knew what exactly happened in Kunling!

Now, all parties sought to uncover the truth.

However, some who had already gone in also disappeared.

Subsequently, the nearby Three Great Imperial Dynasties—Yu, Qian, and Rui—began organizing forces, dispatching regular armies to attempt to push inward.

Then, factions from the Lands Beyond and Esoteric Sects successively sent out powerful experts to Kunling to investigate the fate of their respective Grandmasters.

Undoubtedly, some branches of the Outer Pure Lands and Esoteric Sects were in a state of panic, as the disappearance of their standard-bearers would lead to various problems.

If this continued to fester and became severe, some forces might decline or even be 'taken over' as a result!

Batch after batch of forces, riding high-grade exotic birds, rushed in from all directions, entering that suffocatingly silent region.

"Latest intelligence: The five-hundred-strong team from the Great Rui Dynasty has lost contact, vanishing without a trace."

This disappearance made it difficult for all parties to relax.

Late at night, there was new information from the Great Qian Dynasty: the regular army unit they dispatched had also disappeared.

This time, experts immediately pursued them, only to find their abandoned camp along the way.

All tents were empty; the people were gone.

There were no signs of struggle on the ground, and all items were intact. The people seemed to have evaporated into thin air.

For a time, even in the dead of night, various places were restless, all discussing this matter.

"Kunling has inexplicably become incomprehensible. What exactly happened?"

Hundreds of living people, appearing to have rested there after marching late into the night, then inexplicably vanished.

The next day, as dusk arrived, a piece of breaking news caused an uproar.

Sun Taichu's third disciple, a true master, after delving deep into the Kunling region, eventually stumbled out, covered in blood.

But he only uttered two words before dying, his Pure Yang consciousness light extinguished.

This was a direct disciple of a Grandmaster, yet he lost his life after going in to explore, shaking everyone to their core and filling them with awe for that place.

In his final moments, he actually gasped out the words "Good Fortune."

These were words that stirred the hearts of all parties. However, knowing the truth made people hesitate, filled with fear. With Grandmasters missing and direct disciples dead, who would dare to easily venture in?

Subsequently, some interpreted it differently, believing he might not have said "Good Fortune" but rather "Disaster."

After all, he was critically wounded and dying, his consciousness light chaotic, and his speech unclear, having suffered such tribulation. How could he have had the presence of mind to tell others about good fortune within?

But many also disagreed, believing he indeed said "Good Fortune." How could such a figure misspeak?

This implied that in the Kunling region, risks and opportunities coexisted. Those Grandmasters might not all be dead; it was highly possible they had discovered something.

On that very day, another explosive piece of news arrived: Pu Heng, Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple, had a wisp of Pure Yang consciousness light pierce through clouds and mist, cutting through the darkness, and emerge.

During the great battle, he hadn't left, remaining there. Was this him breaking out to deliver a message?

"What a pity. His wisp of Pure Yang light, just as it broke out of the Kunling region's edge, burned to its end, unable to truly escape."

Evidently, he had fought desperately to return but ultimately failed.

This both shocked and sent shivers down people's spines.

Setting aside the mystery of the Grandmasters' lives and deaths, the fate of Sun Taichu's third disciple and Cao Qianqiu's eldest disciple alone was enough to prove how incredibly dangerous that place was.

At this point, everyone felt somewhat uneasy.

Forbidden Zones were historical legacies; during the Great Expansion of the past, these regions were left unmanaged if they couldn't be resolved at the time.

People hadn't anticipated that Kunling's sudden eruption would be so severe, astonishing the world.

All high-ranking officials had solemn expressions and suppressed hearts. An incident at such a critical juncture made it hard not to draw various associations.

This time, losing some Grandmaster-level figures meant a sharp reduction in combat strength at the pinnacle of the pyramid, leading to a lack of external deterrence.

Originally, people from all paths had negotiated and were preparing for a Grand Reclamation, advancing into the depths of the Night Mist World to open up new territories and acquire more resources.

But now, the entire plan had to be interrupted.

Now, if some terrifying beings from the depths of the Night Mist World were to attack in reverse, it would undoubtedly be extremely troublesome.

The only consolation was that no Demon God Imperial Court or Evil God Kingdom had been discovered ahead yet. Although there were rumors of similar deities, they were likely extremely far away, so there was no immediate need to worry.

On the third day, someone ventured deep inside, then returned alive, bringing back Auspicious Beast Blood!

Immediately, this caused a huge sensation.

This was an expert from the Outer Pure Land. Even before nearing Kunling City and that plateau, he saw a puddle of glowing golden blood on the ground.

Ultimately, he personally refined a portion and confirmed it was indeed Auspicious Beast Blood.

In an instant, this ignited the enthusiasm of some adventurers. A perilous boundary region with great fortune—this made some want to take a gamble.

Many people were asking those from the Outer Pure Land what that expert had seen in the Kunling region and if he had uncovered the truth.

As a result, the Pure Land responders said that the expert hadn't approached the battle zone, retreating when he felt it was inappropriate. He was also ambushed outside by those trying to seize the Auspicious Beast Blood and was currently recovering from his injuries.

"One thing, though: he mentioned a new discovery. The terrain of Kunling seems to be changing."

Indeed, as deep night arrived, rumbling sounds echoed ceaselessly within the Kunling region, faintly accompanied by lightning and thunder, an incredibly astonishing scene.

Many people gazed from afar.

Faintly, people actually saw many blurred scenes emerging within the night mist.

"Kunling has changed!"

People saw what looked like giant ancient trees appearing, and even further away, a magnificent immortal city flickered in and out of sight, with mountains undulating and figures indistinct.

Then, amidst the lightning and thunder, they all shattered.

Immediately, this region shook; towering mountains rose, vast lands sank, large lakes formed, deserts expanded—various landforms appeared simultaneously.

Furthermore, as the Kunling land shifted, in some areas, when massive peaks broke through the earth, golden blood was shaken high into the sky, then transformed into golden mist scattering back towards the ground.

"My goodness, there really is Auspicious Beast Blood! Did everyone remember the direction? This is an enormous fortune, capable of extending life, enhancing innate talent, and even altering bone structure!"

"This old man also wishes for Nirvana! If I could obtain that blood, even if it doesn't allow me to emerge as an immortal fetus or experience a second spring, I reckon I could live for another hundred years!"

No one who witnessed this scene could remain calm; Auspicious Beast Blood was genuinely discovered.

This implied that those Grandmasters had once heavily wounded, or even slain, an auspicious beast. In many areas of the Kunling region, golden blood still remained.

"That blood is incredibly viscous; every drop could form a great pill on its own. It won't dissipate in a short time. We must find a way to extract it!"

Subsequently, an incredibly dense fog covered the entire Kunling region. The night was vast, and nothing could be seen.

After this day, many people rushed to attempt exploration, and two more individuals successively obtained Auspicious Beast Blood, causing a huge stir.

Everyone knew that the Kunling region had problems and dangers. However, all parties could no longer sit still and successively dispatched teams to investigate.

"Auspicious Beast Blood! Even the Grandmasters from all paths desire to refine the heart blood of an auspicious beast to extend their lives. For us, it's an even more priceless treasure."

Wealth moves hearts, let alone a substance like this. Expedition teams arrived one after another.

Earlier, people were still alarmed, wary, and speculating about the Grandmasters' whereabouts. But now, many were somewhat agitated, more concerned with the good fortune inside, neglecting other matters.

"Perhaps the Grandmasters have already entered the ultimate land of fortune, and what's left for us are just leftovers."

"I hope so. What I'm most worried about is that all the Grandmasters are dead, and their great battle tore open a corner of hell, releasing things that shouldn't appear in this world."

While some were frenzied, others naturally worried, fearing that something bad might happen, because the changes in Kunling now exceeded everyone's expectations.

Currently, that place had become unpredictable, with daily changes.

"What about hell or the underworld? Kunling used to be a legendary place, associated with quasi-divine beings and near-immortal creatures. If anything was released, shouldn't it be something sacred?"

"What are you thinking? Do you really believe that anything related to gods or immortals is glorious? It might even be colder than the Yin soil, who knows?"

Recently, various discussions and analyses emerged endlessly. Imperial dynasties and great sects all wanted to join in, hoping to enter the Kunling region and seize the good fortune.

"Ancient texts record that Kunling connects to the Jade Capital, where quasi-gods appear and disappear, and near-immortals wander freely... Could the Jade Capital have appeared?"

Throughout the Night Mist World, people were discussing Kunling.

Some elders were deeply worried. They believed that a major event influencing the future trajectory had already occurred, yet they couldn't grasp its essence.

They wanted to dispel the mist and see the truth clearly. Why had this happened?

Some revered seniors frowned deeply. Could the great battle a few days ago have been caused by an auspicious beast colluding with forces from the depths of the Night Mist World, leading to this shocking change? Otherwise, how could it have come to this?

Otherwise, the combined Grandmasters should have swept aside everything.

"It has nothing to do with external forces. This time, something merely happened to Kunling itself. It seems to be restructuring, possibly returning to its legendary form," a prominent figure said with certainty.

Several days later, the Kunling region stabilized; there were no more earthquakes, and its geomorphology had indeed undergone earth-shattering changes, completely different from the past.

Even people who lived in this area would not recognize it if they saw it again now.

Of course, people could only observe the external areas; they couldn't see far into the distance because the night mist here was so dense it couldn't dissipate, making the world like ink, far surpassing its former state.

"Brother, when do we go in and take a look?" Little Wu asked.

He and Qin Ming lived in Qionghua City, a massive city of the Great Yu Dynasty near the Kunling region, making it quite convenient to reach their destination.

Qin Ming said, "Let's wait and see. So many major powers are at their wit's end; we're in even less of a hurry. Safety first. Better to forgo the Auspicious Beast Blood than act rashly."

Half a month later, Kunling no longer changed. Various parties arrived successively, embarking on explorations. Some brought out Auspicious Beast Blood, while others obtained miraculous arts or mysterious inheritances.

Of course, many also died inside.

"Kunling has completely become an unfamiliar place, no longer as we remember it!"

"Some of the buildings inside are dilapidated, others grand. One might encounter living creatures or monstrous, muddled beasts, making it extremely dangerous!"

Those who escaped were still trembling with fear, their faces pale to this day. Ninety percent of those who went in died at the hands of those abnormal creatures.

"The most crucial thing is that you truly cannot defeat those creatures; they are simply too strong!"

"An expert from the Immortal Path fought desperately against a monster and eventually won, obtaining a beast hide scroll inscribed with a powerful technique."

Upon discovering this situation, some immediately invited revered seniors, hoping for a master to act, sweep through the monster hordes, and acquire miraculous arts, special scriptures, and the like.

However, this battle was tragic.

When that revered senior appeared, an elderly monster also emerged from the black mist. Its spiritual senses seemed incredibly keen, as it came rushing over, seemingly drawn by scent, specifically to hunt him down.

The revered senior fought desperately until the end, only to be slain by the old monster.

Moreover, people noticed that the old monster, once dull, had become somewhat different; its eyes began to show vitality.

That day, the old monster successively killed three elders of a certain Dao tradition, gradually gaining sentience, as if resurrected from a walking corpse.

"The Kunling region is full of ghosts!"

In an instant, the news spread.

"In the black mist, those figures are vengeful spirits, wandering specters seeking substitutes. After killing living people, they seem to recover and will reappear in the world!"

This was explosive news!

All sects were shocked, causing an uproar.

The Three Great Imperial Dynasties were even more worried. If this claim was true, they would bear the brunt.

If countless vengeful spirits emerged from the Kunling region and entered the Three Great Imperial Dynasties seeking substitutes, the consequences would be catastrophic and unimaginable.

"This news is rather chilling. All those Grandmasters disappeared; could they have been replaced too?"

"Don't even say it. I feel like the sky of the Night Mist World is about to collapse!"

Even some elder seniors were deeply shaken, because Kunling was related to mythology. If it started pulling substitutes, the level of beings escaping from there would be unimaginable.

The only consolation was that no monsters had actively run out of the fog-shrouded Kunling region.

"Unless it has already revived and is no longer a walking corpse. In that case, if it came out, we wouldn't be able to distinguish it."

The current situation was grim. No one knew whether the vengeful spirits in the ancient Kunling land would wreak havoc, so all parties entered the fray to devise countermeasures.

As people continuously probed, they gradually summarized many experiences.

When a team entered the dense fog for exploration, whoever had the highest cultivation level would generally attract ghosts and monsters of a similar tier.

"Therefore, when choosing teammates, it's best to select people of the same realm. Absolutely do not walk with those of higher realms, otherwise you'll die tragically, utterly defenseless!"

"You simply don't know where these vengeful spirits emerge from; they're impossible to guard against!"

Besides the near-death experiences, there truly were opportunities, and the living would gain something.

"For some unknown reason, a portion of the vengeful spirits carry inheritances. As long as you slay them, you can obtain it!"

After Qin Ming and Little Wu waited quietly in Qionghua City for many days, hearing many rumors and gathering enough information, they finally couldn't resist entering.

Because they heard that some core disciples from various sects, even immortal seeds and divine seeds, had begun to venture in. They had figured out a pattern: not teaming up with elders made it less dangerous, and occasionally yielded great rewards.

Even so, they lay low for several more days. Only after not hearing of any core disciples dying suddenly, nor any immortal seeds encountering trouble, did the two set off.

The two formed a team by themselves, not joining any unknown groups, as they trusted each other the most.

The two entered the outer regions of Kunling, somewhat lost in thought. What they saw was indeed completely different from the past: dense fog everywhere, and even in shallow night, boundless darkness.

If an ordinary person walked in, they would surely be no different from a blind person with eyes wide open.

Qin Ming said, "The region we are about to enter might not be Kunling, but the legendary land of myths!"

Little Wu nodded heavily, saying, "A dead mythical land where all the creatures of old have become vengeful spirits!"

"Just two of you dare to enter? We all form large teams to attract a monster of the same tier and then surround and kill it. You two are too reckless." A kind-hearted person warned the two.

Qin Ming replied, "Thank you. We'll just wander around the periphery. If things become unmanageable, we'll retreat immediately."

A moment later, they ventured deeper and found themselves in a desolate Gobi desert, utterly barren, with nothing but black mist and gravel as far as the eye could see.

"Don't go over there! That's a small forbidden zone that just appeared yesterday. There's no coming back from it; the vengeful spirits there are ferociously tearing through the sky!" Someone shouted from behind.

However, the black mist surged, cutting off their voices.

"Hmm?" Qin Ming faintly heard a shout. When he looked back, he only saw a vast expanse of fog.

He concentrated, and a warm current immediately surged in his eyes. He instantly saw through the deep fog that someone was waving at them, but he couldn't hear any sound.

"Is something wrong with this area?" He frowned.

"Huh?!" Just then, he was startled, a chill running down his neck as the black mist inexplicably transformed into ropes, hoisting him up.

"The ghostly things are really here, trying to make me a substitute, to become a hanged ghost?!" Little Wu was also startled and enraged, because he too was lifted off the ground, suspended in mid-air.

This was very strange; there was no leverage in the void, yet black ropes formed out of nowhere, suddenly locking onto their necks and hoisting them up directly.

Naturally, neither of them would surrender without a fight, both retaliating with full force.

In an instant, dazzling Heavenly Light burst forth from Qin Ming's body. He abruptly shook, and the Heavenly Light energy, like blades, severed the black ropes, allowing him to fall from mid-air.

However, from all directions, from the unknown depths of the void, dozens of black ropes extended, locking onto various parts of his body.

This was clearly an attempt to immediately give him a harsh welcome.

Golden mist surged around Qin Ming's body, his hands like blades. Each strike shattered several black ropes, causing them to finally explode.

Little Wu also dealt with the black ropes around him. The two exchanged glances; this place was truly bizarre. Ordinary cultivators entering here would indeed quickly have their lives claimed by vengeful spirits.

Not far away, a figure walked towards the two. It was a young man, clad in tattered armor, holding a long blade, approaching them.

"Let me handle this!"

Little Wu charged forward, striking repeatedly. His fists clashed with the long blade, producing clangorous sounds and scattering sparks. After several exchanges, he blasted the figure apart.

Qin Ming frowned. He knew how extraordinary Little Wu was, the sole 'seed' of the Fourth Forbidden Zone, equivalent to an immortal or divine seed, yet he couldn't instantly kill this person.

"A blade manual?" Little Wu picked up a beast hide scroll from the ground and examined it closely.

Then, he handed it to Qin Ming, asking him to appraise it.

"Not bad. This blade technique is quite remarkable." Qin Ming had considerable research in the way of the blade. He memorized this blade technique, casually practicing a few moves.

The two proceeded forward, finally seeing other sights. Amidst the dense fog, a dilapidated palace stood on the Gobi desert. It was empty and quiet.

"Withered Hall?" Qin Ming was surprised, seeing the two characters on the palace's plaque. They flowed with an ancient, weathered charm, their imprint self-revealing their meaning.

In front of the dilapidated palace stood an old tree, sparsely hung with yellow leaves. Now, as they swayed and fell with the wind, the leaves instantly turned into sharp blades, slashing towards Qin Ming.

Heavenly Light surged around his body, blocking the withered leaves. However, it didn't shatter them. Instead, it emitted clangorous sounds, as if clashing with heavenly blades.

Qin Ming was startled. Few could attack him with falling leaves like this. This place was truly bizarre. How overbearing was his Heavenly Light energy, yet it didn't immediately shred the withered leaves.

Boom!

Finally, those yellow leaves exploded, shattering into powder.

However, in mid-air, they formed a withered, bony hand, reaching for Qin Ming's neck.

At the same time, the entire old tree revived, opened its eyes, pulled itself from the ground, and stretched its branches, attacking Qin Ming.

Each branch ultimately transformed into a withered, bony hand, like a ghostly claw.

Qin Ming was surprised. Just an old tree, yet it was so troublesome to deal with.

To finish the fight quickly, he didn't hesitate to use a trump card: he circulated the Dragon-Serpent Scripture, whereupon dragon roars echoed. Two lights, one black and one white, shot forth. The dragon and serpent transformed into shears, and with a *ka-cha* sound, they tore open the old tree's main trunk.

Qin Ming continuously activated it, only causing the old tree to fall and be completely severed after three attempts.

Then the old tree exploded, leaving behind a plaque on the ground with the character 'Wither' written on it.

"With this token, you may enter the hall to listen to the True Scripture." A voice emanated from the dilapidated ancient hall.

Qin Ming looked towards the hall, immediately feeling a sense of awe. There was a patch of prayer mats, and countless figures appeared on them, as if located in different temporal spaces.

He gritted his teeth, walked in, and sat on a prayer mat.

On the high platform at the very top of the ancient hall was a nearly decayed body, old skin clinging to its face, disheveled hair, and clothes on the verge of rotting. It was actually a vengeful spirit about to lecture on true scriptures here.

Little Wu waited outside, fully prepared to provide support at any moment.
