# Chapter 21: Seven-Star Spirit Fruit  

"You're absolutely right, fellow Daoist," Shopkeeper Song immediately agreed.  

"We have ten Spirit Breath Grass plants here. Activating one costs one tael of broken spirit stones, totaling ten taels."  

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning felt slightly puzzled.  

*This price seems quite good. With ten Spirit Breath Grass plants, I could probably activate them all with just one use of the Activation Technique and earn ten taels of broken spirit stones?*  

*Though ten taels might not be enough to exchange for a single low-grade spirit stone, theoretically, it's as if I've earned one.*  

Perhaps noticing Chu Ning's confusion, Shopkeeper Song explained:  

"Fellow Daoist, the seeds of the Spirit Breath Grass have an extremely peculiar nature—they are highly sensitive to fluctuations in spiritual energy.  

"Each plant must be cultivated separately, so these ten plants require you to perform the Activation Technique ten separate times.  

"Moreover, the technique must be cast instantly. If you slowly gather spiritual energy through hand seals and don't inject the energy all at once, the activation will fail."  

Chu Ning finally understood.  

*No wonder it's not ten taels for one go, but one tael per activation. That explains why the disciples from the C-tier area weren’t interested.*  

*Well, one tael is still one tael.* Chu Ning wasn’t too bothered. The Activation Technique didn’t consume much of his spiritual energy, so this was still easy money.  

"Alright, I’ll take the job," he said to Shopkeeper Song.  

"Excellent! Please wait a moment while I make some preparations."  

Shopkeeper Song left briefly and soon returned, leading Chu Ning to an open space in the backyard.  

There, a transparent box sat on the ground, inside of which was a black seed.  

"Fellow Daoist, shall we begin?" Shopkeeper Song asked.  

Chu Ning nodded. Shopkeeper Song immediately opened the lid of the box.  

Without hesitation, Chu Ning cast the Activation Technique instantly, sending a surge of spiritual energy into the Spirit Breath Grass seed.  

Before long, the seed sprouted and broke through the soil.  

Shopkeeper Song quickly closed the box and had it carried away.  

Then, another transparent box was brought out.  

Chu Ning repeated the process, performing the Activation Technique ten times in total.  

Shopkeeper Song promptly handed him a small pouch. "Fellow Daoist, here are ten taels of broken spirit stones. Please accept them."  

Chu Ning weighed the pouch briefly before tucking it into his robe.  

After a moment’s hesitation, he asked, "Shopkeeper, are there any other spirit plant-related tasks available?"  

Ten taels of broken spirit stones were still far too little.  

If he wanted to buy anything in the market, it wouldn’t be nearly enough.  

Shopkeeper Song shook his head. "At the moment, this is the only one I have."  

After a pause, he looked at Chu Ning and asked, "Have you cultivated the Verdant Wood Spring Technique? If so, I might be able to introduce you to another job."  

Chu Ning thought for a moment before nodding. "I can give it a try."  

There was no need to hide the fact that he knew the Verdant Wood Spring Technique—after all, cultivating Ink Spirit Bamboo required it.  

Shopkeeper Song didn’t seem surprised. Given that Chu Ning was at least at the third level of Qi Refinement and could cast the Activation Technique instantly, it wasn’t unusual for him to know the Verdant Wood Spring Technique.  

He instructed a clerk to take over the counter and then led Chu Ning out of the backyard. After a short walk, they arrived at a small shop.  

"Old Sun, I’ve brought you a customer!" Shopkeeper Song called out as soon as they entered.  

A short, lean old man rose from a reclining chair. His gaze swept over Shopkeeper Song before settling on Chu Ning.  

"What does this guest require? This old man specializes in wood-attribute items."  

His voice was soft, but it immediately caught Chu Ning’s attention.  

*Wood-attribute items.*  

Due to his Yin Wood Spiritual Body, Chu Ning had a special affinity for wood-attribute objects.  

Looking around, he saw that the shelves were lined with wood-attribute artifacts and flying swords, which greatly intrigued him.  

Meanwhile, Shopkeeper Song introduced Chu Ning.  

"This guest just demonstrated the Activation Technique at my place. I heard he’s proficient in the Verdant Wood Spring Technique, so I brought him here."  

"Oh? You can perform the Verdant Wood Spring Technique?"  

Old Sun glanced at Chu Ning but didn’t seem particularly impressed, as if it wasn’t a big deal to him.  

This surprised Chu Ning slightly.  

From their conversation, it seemed Old Sun was specifically looking for someone who could perform the Verdant Wood Spring Technique.  

*Why is he so indifferent now that I’ve confirmed it?*  

Despite his confusion, Chu Ning nodded.  

Old Sun then said indifferently, "Follow me, fellow Daoist."  

Shopkeeper Song excused himself and left, while Old Sun led Chu Ning to the backyard.  

Once there, Old Sun asked Chu Ning to demonstrate the Verdant Wood Spring Technique.  

After watching the impressive results, Old Sun looked at Chu Ning and asked,  

"How many times can you cast the Verdant Wood Spring Technique in succession?"  

"Several times in one go?" Chu Ning wondered. *Does he need me to cover a large area with the technique?*  

But judging by the size of the courtyard, it didn’t seem like there was much space for large-scale cultivation. If the job required traveling far, Chu Ning wasn’t interested.  

Instead of answering, he asked, "How many times do you need?"  

"Ten!" Old Sun raised a finger.  

"If you can’t cast the Verdant Wood Spring Technique ten times in a row, you can’t take on this task."  

His tone remained flat. Chu Ning responded just as calmly,  

"Perhaps you should first explain what the task is, and then I’ll decide whether to take it or not."  

"Can you really cast it ten times in a row?"  

Old Sun’s voice finally carried a hint of change—a mix of doubt and faint excitement.  

Chu Ning remained silent, which was answer enough.  

Old Sun hesitated for a moment before finally gritting his teeth and speaking.  

"To be honest, I happened to obtain a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and transplanted it here.  

"Unfortunately, the spiritual energy in this place is insufficient.  

"Even though I’ve used high-quality spirit soil and tried many methods, the fruit has only formed—its growth has stalled.  

"At this point, only the Verdant Wood Spring Technique can stimulate its growth and improve its quality."  

Chu Ning grew more interested.  

At least it wasn’t a distant location, and the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit sounded intriguing—he had never seen one before.  

Recalling Old Sun’s earlier questions, he asked curiously,  

"Does the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit require multiple consecutive casts of the Verdant Wood Spring Technique?"  

"Exactly," Old Sun nodded.  

"The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit requires ten consecutive casts of the Verdant Wood Spring Technique without interruption.  

"This must be repeated for ten days—a total of a hundred casts—to ensure the fruit’s quality.  

"That’s why I haven’t been able to find someone suitable for this task until now."  

Chu Ning fell into thought. Casting the technique ten times in a row was no problem—he could even do more.  

But coming here for ten consecutive days was a bit of a hassle.  

Old Sun studied Chu Ning’s expression, his gaze flickering.  

He had previously approached several early-stage Qi Refinement disciples, but none could meet the requirement, so the deal had never materialized.  

Of course, higher-level cultivators could easily accomplish it.  

But he didn’t want such a treasure to be known by stronger individuals.  

Now, he wasn’t sure if Chu Ning was genuinely capable or just probing for information.  

Chu Ning nodded slightly, then shook his head.  

"I can cast the Verdant Wood Spring Technique ten times in a row, but it will drain my spiritual energy completely. Coming here every day would be too troublesome."  

Old Sun quickly responded, "That’s simple. After each session, I’ll give you a Replenishment Pill to restore your spiritual energy.  

"On top of that, I’ll pay you two low-grade spirit stones per day for your efforts."  

Chu Ning’s heart raced at the offer.  

Earlier, ten casts of the Activation Technique had earned him only ten taels of broken spirit stones.  

Now, ten casts of the Verdant Wood Spring Technique would net him two low-grade spirit stones.  

Ten days of work would mean twenty stones.  

With twenty low-grade spirit stones, he could buy some decent items in the market.  

"Alright, let’s start today," Chu Ning agreed.  

Old Sun’s face lit up with joy. He led Chu Ning to a spirit fruit tree nearly half a person’s height.  

The tree had a straight, slender trunk and exuded an intoxicating fragrance.  

Its leaves were small but shimmered in seven colors.  

Beneath the vibrant foliage hung several green fruits. Though not yet fully plump, their spiritual energy was already palpable.
