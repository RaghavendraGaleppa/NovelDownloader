# Chapter 126: Time's Up

"Super Golden Bell Cover!"

Radiant light overflowed as streams of golden energy converged. This was Geng Metal Qi, not only incredibly sharp for offense but also exceptionally strong for defense. A golden, bell-shaped phantom enveloped Zhou Tian, appearing substantial and rotating slowly, imbued with unparalleled defensive power.

*Buzz!*

The Saint-Demon's black halberd shattered the air, heavily striking the golden bell, intending to grind Zhou Tian into dust. Ripples spread across the bell's surface, and cracks extended from the halberd's point of impact. The Demon's offense was peerless and relentless; the black halberd, capable of collapsing space, was wielded as if weightless, its strikes so dense as to be impenetrable. *Clang clang clang* sounds continuously echoed in the void. In an instant, the golden bell covering Zhou Tian was covered in cracks and on the verge of shattering.

Zhou Tian, already at the Heavenly King Realm and on the verge of becoming a Half-step Dao Master, reacted without a moment's delay. He clenched his right fist, and chains of order emerged from the void, wrapped in purple lightning. This was lightning power condensed to its extreme, which, after extreme sublimation, possessed not only immense destructive force but also powerful suppressive might. "Thunder Chains!"

The Demon's eyes narrowed. Its black wings emitted a dark glow as countless fiends surged forth: giant one-horned bats, three-headed flaming hellhounds, nightmares with skeletal frames burning with cerulean flames—each roared as they charged towards the Thunder Chains. At the same time, the Demon's hands did not stop. The black halberd glowed with twisted, crimson patterns, like flowing magma.

The Thunder Chains originated from the void, and thick lightning surged through the area, transforming it into a domain of thunder. The fiendish creatures were struck into ash and smoke, but the Demon, wielding its halberd, continuously shattered several Thunder Chains. Yet, despite this, many Thunder Chains still coiled around its body. The lightning coursed over the Demon's form, intertwining with the demonic mist surrounding it.

A wave of helplessness surged in the Demon's heart. It could only use half of its inherent power, which limited its strength. Facing an opponent on the verge of becoming a Half-step Dao Master made him difficult to deal with. Gritting its teeth, demonic flames flared in the Demon's eyes. It completely ignored the increasing number of Thunder Chains缠绕 it. The halberd floated above its head, and its hands formed a profound mudra before its chest. Its ferocious face gradually became serene.

Zhou Tian's eyelid twitched. Something out of the ordinary must mean trouble. It was clear the Saint-Demon was not preparing to surrender but was instead about to unleash a powerful ultimate technique. Zhou Tian's entire body surged with energy, and the nearby celestial domain turned gloomy as thick purple lightning churned. More and more Thunder Chains shot out from the void, coiling around the Saint-Demon.

*Rumble!*

These Thunder Chains acted as conductors. Countless lightning bolts struck the Saint-Demon, completely engulfing it. There was virtually no gap, like a sea of thunder. However, Zhou Tian's face showed no joy. In his perception, the Saint-Demon's aura was soaring, showing no signs of weakening.

"Saint-Demon Unification!"

Two distinct voices emanated from the sea of thunder. A strange power erupted from within the lightning, and all the Thunder Chains shattered, causing the lightning sea to dissipate. The Saint-Demon's figure reappeared before Zhou Tian. Although it was the same face, Zhou Tian strangely felt as if there were two people on that face—an inexplicable sensation.

"This is the power I have long pursued."

Two distinct voices came from its mouth: one belonged to the Saint, and the other to the Demon. Zhou Tian frowned deeply. The Saint-Demon now felt terrifying, a being completely different from before, like a primordial behemoth.

It could only be said that Zhou Tian's encounter with the Saint-Demon was extraordinary. The Saint-Demon's original realm was at the peak of Heavenly King, on the verge of Half-step Dao Master, but it usually couldn't fully exert this power, which was why Zhou Tian could suppress him. However, once "Saint-Demon Unification" was activated, it was as if he had one foot directly into the Dao Master Realm, allowing him to completely suppress Zhou Tian. This wasn't the Saint-Demon's inherent power but a fusion achieved through special methods, which meant Zhou Tian's skills could not replicate it. Thus, it was truly extraordinary.

The Saint-Demon extended its palm and gently clenched its hand. A hazy gray hand appeared. Although there were no astonishing phenomena, it instantly locked onto Zhou Tian. Zhou Tian unleashed endless energy—a sea of lightning and fire, Geng Metal and Yin-Yang—as if recreating the world. Yet, it was all to no avail. The hazy gray hand firmly gripped him, and all energy that came into contact with it was annihilated.

A look of helplessness flashed across Zhou Tian's face, not because he was captured, but because his transformation time was up. As the last instant passed, all his energy was drawn away. Before Zhou Tian could even form another thought, now reduced to a mortal body, he was instantly annihilated by the energy inherent in the gray hand, not even a speck of dust remained. Since Zhou Tian had already used his "Cultivation Duplication" skill, which consumed his revival count for the day, he could only revive after his revival count refreshed tomorrow.

The Saint-Demon was momentarily startled by this sight, but instantly understood. This must be the time limit Zhou Tian had mentioned due to his own restrictions.

Exiting that state, the Saint aspect once again took control. The Saint descended from the sky, a thoughtful expression in its eyes. With a wave of its hand, space and time shifted, and the figures of Mu Su and Ling Yu instantly appeared beside it.

"Where do you want to go?" the Saint-Demon, its smiling face reappearing, asked the two.

Mu Su and Ling Yu exchanged a glance, remaining silent. They hadn't foolishly stayed to watch the battle; instead, they had immediately tried to leave. They thought they had run a considerable distance, but unexpectedly, they were pulled back. The Saint-Demon didn't seem to mind. With its hands clasped behind its back, it pondered Zhou Tian's earlier words, its gaze flickering.

"Do you think what Zhou Tian said is true?" the Saint-Demon suddenly asked, then added, "You must answer, you know."

"Yes!" Ling Yu replied without hesitation. She understood it very clearly: they could only survive by relying on Zhou Tian. She had never known why Zhou Tian would strip naked and disappear for a period every day, but when Zhou Tian revived, naked, before them just now, she finally understood.

The Saint-Demon showed no reaction, staring intently at the spot where Zhou Tian had vanished, its eyes deep, and it let out a soft sigh, "A Celestial Venerable..."

Ling Yu and Mu Su were utterly bewildered and dared not speak, remaining silent.
