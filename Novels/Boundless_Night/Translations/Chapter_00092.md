# Chapter 92: Shifting Sands of Time

Everyone present who knew Qin Ming, Wang Caiwei, Cui Chonghe, and Li Qingxu was aware of the delicate relationship between the four. It seemed they had never gathered in the same place before. Some wore unreadable expressions, quietly anticipating a good show.

"Perhaps you should leave first," Lu Zhenyi whispered to Qin Ming.

"Some things are better resolved by talking," Zheng Maoze approached, placing his large, thick hand on Qin Ming's shoulder, appearing both intimate and righteous. He spoke earnestly, "I heard you were injured two years ago; it was just a misunderstanding. I'll talk to Li Qingxu about it later; it truly wasn't your fault."

The old acquaintances knew the history. Li Qingxu had known Wang Caiwei for a long time, but the Wang family had arranged a marriage alliance with the Cui family. That noble young lady had once toured with Qin Ming, but Cui Chonghe was the official fiancé. Involving ancient noble families with such a complicated relationship, if word got out, it would certainly become a favorite topic of gossip among ordinary folk in the streets and alleys. Even the old friends present couldn't suppress their "gossip fire" and yearned to see the four meet.

Lu Zhenyi and Chen Bingyan were fine, but the others who arrived later had not interacted much with Qin Ming back then. These less familiar individuals made no effort to conceal their fervent gazes, eagerly awaiting a spectacle that was bound to be undignified.

Qin Ming's expression remained calm. Zheng Maoze's intimate gesture of placing his hand on his shoulder, while claiming to help him, was in fact an attempt to hold him back, to prevent him from leaving.

"Da Zheng, since you're bringing up old matters, I might as well mention something too. Your younger brother has been very active recently, constantly fanning the flames, giving hints. I wonder if he's trying to find someone to eliminate me, or perhaps lure Cui Chonghe out of the extra-mundane realm to harm him? What exactly does your brother want?" Qin Ming spoke plainly, in front of everyone.

"What's going on?" Some extra-mundane practitioners were surprised. This involved Cui Chonghe? Even some young men and women who didn't know them turned their heads to look.

Zheng Maoze felt a little regretful. Even if this young man had been knocked down from the clouds into the mud, his core essence hadn't changed; he was still not to be trifled with. "Qin Ming, don't talk nonsense!" He no longer spoke with a jocular tone, his expression slightly cold. Such matters really couldn't be spread loosely.

Qin Ming simply wanted to reciprocate; some things were best left unsaid beyond a certain point. He sighed inwardly, actually not wanting to reunite with this group of people. At this stage, he didn't want to get involved with this circle at all. He was only here to see Ling Xu, to report the latest news collected by Yu Que's bird-brothers, and would leave immediately after discussing official business. Who would have thought that a group of extra-mundane practitioners would appear so opportunely? It seemed a bit too coincidental. Qin Ming suspected that some people might have deliberately come here to intercept Ling Xu. He realized that these waters ran deep and were quite turbid. If certain individuals in the extra-mundane realm were supporting the Golden Bandits, then tonight would be difficult!

Qin Ming's original intention in returning to Black White Mountain was only to resolve the lingering issues at Golden Chicken Ridge and ensure that Twin Tree Village remained safe. He didn't want to get caught up in the complex situation unfolding before him. This was already a "dangerous territory" beyond his ability to navigate!

"If you have something urgent, go ahead, I'll see you off," Chen Bingyan said to Qin Ming.

"What's the rush? It's rare for old friends to gather," Zeng Yuan said with a smile, having been mostly quiet earlier. Qin Ming gave him a deep look. Their relationship had been decent back then, but now he, like Zheng Maoze, wanted to stop him from leaving. Everyone present knew that Zeng Yuan and Li Qingxu were now very close.

There were also a few less familiar faces, all quietly observing. Although they knew Qin Ming's immortal缘 was severed, they wouldn't shallowly put on airs. They simply wanted to see the upcoming "four-person stage" scene.

In the distance, Ling Xu looked over and said, "Little Qin, you should go. We're short-staffed tonight, you'll have to make another trip." Qin Ming responded, then faced his acquaintances, saying, "Everyone, duty calls, I must leave first."

Though Zheng Maoze and Zeng Yuan wanted him to stay for "old times' sake," they dared not provoke a city lord, let alone someone as notoriously "infamous" as Ling Xu.

"See Little Qin off," Ling Xu beckoned, and a gray-clothed man quickly approached from a distance.

"This child is good, I'll see him off too," the calico cat said, carrying its red sword on its back, taking light, nimble steps and walking ahead.

Qin Ming knew that if even he had suspicions, Ling Xu and the others must surely understand that the appearance of the extra-mundane practitioners was no coincidence; someone was waiting for him here. After the three-foot-tall calico cat reached outside the town, its figure instantly transformed into a flash of lightning, searching nearby. Soon, it brought a blood-soaked black-clothed man out of the forest.

"We were ambushed. There are people nearby providing support for the Golden Bandits. They'll probably take this route," the black-clothed man weakly informed them.

"It's time to act, you take him away!" the calico cat turned to the gray-clothed man who had followed.

Qin Ming didn't hesitate, immediately calling over the Red Eagle and leaping onto its back. At a time like this, he wouldn't talk about staying to contribute. It was unnecessary; one more person would just mean one more pool of blood. Top-tier battles naturally had to involve high-level powerhouses. The gray-clothed man stood on the back of a slightly smaller but more spirited silver raptor, escorting Qin Ming away from the Silver Vine Town area.

*Clang!*

Under the dark night sky, amid the continuous mountain ranges, a bell sound pierced through the clouds. The bell sound surged, wave after wave. On the ink-stained mountains, purple mist steamed, and the constant ringing of bells erupted, like thousands of troops charging. It was like a set of chimes, stirring up mysterious energy, sealing off that mountain range.

The gray-clothed man on the silver raptor looked back, somewhat nervous, watching intently. "Has a major battle erupted? Aren't you short-staffed?" Qin Ming asked.

"The main problem is we don't know whether one or two factions from the extra-mundane realm are supporting the Golden Bandits," the gray-clothed man replied, his brow deeply furrowed.

"Then go back. Don't worry about me. High-level experts won't even bother with a novice like me," Qin Ming said.

"City Lord Ling Xu told me to escort you," the gray-clothed man hesitated.

Qin Ming urged, "I'm extremely familiar with this area of Black White Mountain. Go back, rest assured, I'll be fine."

"Alright!" The gray-clothed man was unsettled, worried about their side being short-staffed and facing major problems in the end.

In Silver Vine Town, some extra-mundane practitioners were gazing at the distant mountains. Someone spoke, "City Lord Ling Xu, who is ringing the bell?"

"How would I know? Just listen quietly," Ling Xu replied. The experts involved with the Golden Bandits were agitated. Their original intention was to intercept Ling Xu, but unexpectedly, the other party also wanted to tie them down here, while others were going to eliminate the Golden Bandits' leader. It didn't matter if the bandit leader died, but crucial items had to be handed over and not fall into others' hands.

...

The scouting Yu Que flew back, very anxious, saying, "The situation is bad. I saw a very fast, silly bird carrying someone chasing us!"

Qin Ming frowned from the mountaintop. Someone was actually "targeting" him? Clearly, the high-level experts had no idea who he was and wouldn't bother with a youth like him. He sighed softly. Times had changed, and hearts were unpredictable.

Qin Ming did not head towards Scarlet Mist City but instead traveled in the opposite direction, hoping to avoid this storm. "Wait, I'm going to dig for a treasure." As he passed a certain area, he remembered something and told the Red Eagle to wait on a mountain peak. He entered a dense forest, carefully identified the spot, and began to dig. The Black White Mountain area was at a higher elevation, so the snow melted slower, and at two meters deep, the ground was still slightly icy.

"Fortunately, it hasn't rotted." Qin Ming pulled out a still-frozen wild rabbit, carefully inspecting it for any unpleasant changes. On the contrary, it seemed to retain wisps of fresh aura. "Beneficial to a flesh-and-blood body?" Qin Ming took out a small piece of cloth from the frozen soil. It was only palm-sized, with metal threads woven into it, embroidered with cloud patterns. There should have been other patterns, but the fragment was too small to discern the main design. In the past, he had slain a young man who could turn into mist and obtained this cloth fragment; the man had used it for protection and almost escaped.

"Since there's no problem, I'll take it." Qin Ming reunited with the Red Eagle.

Yu Que flew from afar, saying, "Oh no, some of my bird-brothers were forced to betray me. Some of my little brothers are now searching for us in reverse, constrained by the extra-mundane cultivators' methods; they have no choice."

Qin Ming's expression changed. These birds could serve as effective information nodes, incredibly useful, but now they were being used against him. "Enter Black White Mountain!" Qin Ming commanded. He didn't go to find Ling Xu or the calico cat, because he knew it would be more dangerous there. He could already faintly see towering red sword light coming from the direction of Silver Vine Town.

"Fly close to that mountain ridge, head towards the desert!" Qin Ming was like a tightrope walker, treading along the red lines of dangerous zones. Soon after, the Red Eagle soared into the night sky, using the night mist to conceal their tracks.

"The Cloud-Piercing Crane is completely controlled and has been following us. It's over! That guy is a master tracker, we can't escape," Yu Que cried out anxiously.

Behind them, a Cloud-Piercing Crane was leading the way, flying extremely fast. Qin Ming drew his bow and notched an arrow. With a *bang*, he shot one of the Cloud-Piercing Crane's wings, causing a burst of blood mist and scattering feathers. It wobbled and plummeted downwards.

"Mountain Lord Qin is indeed kind. Even at such a critical moment, he didn't go for a kill, leaving my crane brother a chance," Yu Que said. Then it whispered, "A thousand-mile journey must eventually end in separation. I too..."

"You should go quickly," Qin Ming waved his hand.

"Then I... I'll hold on a bit longer!" Yu Que gritted its teeth and said.

A black raptor followed them down, an graceful figure standing on its back; it seemed to be a woman. Qin Ming drew his bow again. The arrow he shot was terrifying, dispersing the night mist as it flew towards the black raptor's head. Under the night sky, the woman's fingers glowed, conjuring a stream of light that actually enveloped the immensely powerful iron arrow.

"An extra-mundane cultivator!" Qin Ming's pupils constricted slightly. He urged the Red Eagle, "Hurry, we only have a chance if we reach the desert, otherwise we might die here."

"Hmm? There's another raptor in the distance, and the man on its back is gleaming gold; is he a Golden Armored Guard?" Qin Ming knew tonight would be extremely difficult.

...

Outside Silver Vine Town, Ling Xu and the calico cat had gone far, pursuing the extra-mundane cultivators who intended to enter the mountain.

"Tonight is truly lively," the feather-robed youth Li Qingxu appeared, holding a purple-glowing bamboo staff, his white shoes unstained by dust, exuding an ethereal grace. His arrival caught the eye of many extra-mundane practitioners; many greeted him, knowing he was truly a prodigy of unparalleled talent.

"Just now, Cui Chonghe's stand-in, that Qin Ming, appeared," Zeng Yuan told him, then chuckled, "He has no immortal affinity. He's embarked on that crude new path of physical mutation."

"It's hard to imagine that he once walked with us, but now he can only carry a blood-stained warhammer, toiling in remote areas."

"I estimate that his current physical prowess is still insufficient to qualify him for the Golden Armored Guards." The few people surrounding Li Qingxu spoke one after another.

...

This night was exceptionally arduous for Qin Ming. The pursuers behind him were getting closer and closer. The Red Eagle possessed powerful flight capabilities, but the raptors behind them had undergone more mutations. Qin Ming continuously drew his bow and fired arrows, effectively slowing down his pursuers; otherwise, he would have been caught long ago.

"My iron arrows can consume her strength. This person can't overwhelm me!" Qin Ming made a judgment. But the situation was grim. This extra-mundane cultivator's level was not low, plus there was an inscrutable Golden Armored Guard further away. As things stood, it was extremely dangerous!

"Why haven't there been a few more grand spring thunders recently?!" Qin Ming had never yearned for that terrifying lightning so much before. Not every time it rained would lightning strike the Thunderfire Alchemy Palace; many times, it was just a few rumbles in the sky, and then it was over.

"If I survive this calamity, I'll find someone to erect a tall iron pole at the Thunderfire Alchemy Palace. I refuse to believe it won't attract lightning!" He knew this was unrealistic; if he dared to destroy the Alchemy Palace like that, Meng Xinghai would beat him first. Qin Ming was simply longing for power. If he could safely return to Scarlet Mist City this time, he was determined to master the miraculous techniques Ning Siqi gave him and the rare ancient texts Meng Xinghai was about to send, rapidly enhancing his physique.

"We've reached the desert!" A look of joy appeared on his face. The front was pitch black, like an abyss, ready to swallow everything. The Red Eagle was terrified, not daring to enter, because if it went slightly deeper, it would become blind, unable to see anything.

"It's alright, descend quickly, we'll stick to the ground!" Qin Ming commanded. The black raptor behind them suddenly erupted in dark light, accelerating. It actually landed on the ground before them, and the woman leaped off, blocking their path.

Qin Ming stood in the desert, dropping his warhammer, laying down his bow and arrows, and slowly drawing the sheep-fat jade iron blade from his back. "You won't give me a way out, huh?" He knew the masked woman was terrifying, surpassing any opponent he had fought before.

In an instant, Qin Ming accelerated, unleashing his strongest Heaven-Severing Blade Intent. It was like a rainy night descending, with lightning and thunder, tearing through the night sky. He slashed out his most powerful blade light.

"You don't even quite qualify to be selected for the Golden Armored Guards, yet you dare..."

The veiled woman lightly waved her right hand, and a golden light flew out, attempting to confine the dark iron blade. The next instant, the black blade in Qin Ming's hand suddenly cracked, its coating peeling off, revealing a pristine white blade body. Its brilliant light was like a great sun burning, dispelling the night.

*Pfft!* In the desert, blood splattered!
