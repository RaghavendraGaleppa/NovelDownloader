# Chapter 495:先天石胎 (Primordial Stone Embryo)

Lu Chunyang’s profound gaze pierced toward the True Body Dao Form like a sharp sword. He flicked a finger toward the center of its forehead, and the tip of his finger burst forth with a condensed, dazzling light.

This profound light was not an attack, but rather a creation containing the power to sever karma and reshape origins. In essence, it was a Sword Intent of Life and Death.

To say that one Sword Intent gives birth to ten thousand laws would not be an exaggeration.

Most other Golden Core True Lords of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect cultivate a single extreme Sword Intent, but Lu Chunyang was not like that. To date, he had revealed no less than twelve different Sword Intents, all of which he had comprehended to their absolute peak.

*Buzz!*

The True Body Dao Form, which had been floating in the air and was an exact replica of Xu Yunfan’s appearance, suddenly trembled violently.

Its facial features rapidly blurred and melted away under the scouring of the profound light, and its delicate skin texture instantly transformed into rough stone.

The surging Profound Yellow Primordial Qi and the hazy Purple Qi within the Dao Form were forcibly restrained and compressed, as if encountering the great creation force of the primordial chaos. The entire body collapsed inward and condensed.

In the blink of an eye, a rough, giant stone, a full zhang in height, replaced the humanoid Dao Form. It pulsed with the color of chaotic Profound Yellow and hazy Purple Qi.

Faint Primordial Dao Patterns appeared on the surface of the boulder, while inside, countless tiny stars flickered and floated. The immense, primitive life force of a primordial embryo was firmly locked within the core of the stone embryo, as if it had returned to the ignorant state before the heavens and earth were born.

The dark golden “卍” (wan) character Buddhist rune and the Black Water Xuanwu Dao Rhyme had transformed into two entangled, brilliant specks of light deep within the stone embryo, becoming the only light source for this Profound Yellow boulder.

Xu Yunfan watched from the side as Lu Chunyang effortlessly manipulated life and death, creating and destroying with a casual gesture. Especially seeing the fully formed True Body Dao Form being pressed back into a boulder, he couldn't help but click his tongue in astonishment. Such an operation was simply unbelievable. It was no less shocking than seeing a grown adult being forcibly pushed back into the womb by Lu Chunyang.

Lu Chunyang examined the boulder for a good while before finally speaking.

“The karma of the Buddhist connection is bound entirely to this body; it has no further connection to your main body. This is a good thing. However, the clone technique derived from the *Xuandu Bajing Liantian Zaohua Yunji*终究 (ultimately) has innate flaws...”

He paused, glanced at Xu Yunfan, who was brimming with anticipation, and continued, “This body has been so deeply tainted by Buddhist karma and has taken root in the Eastern Wilderness. If this continues for a long time, it will inevitably develop its own independent will. With the passage of years, it will inevitably develop the confusion of ‘Who am I? Who is the true self?’. If it then receives the guidance and assistance of the Buddhist sect to turn against and replace its main body... this is no empty threat.”

He stared intently into Xu Yunfan’s eyes, his words decisive and firm: “This Lord advises you to treat this body as if it were already dead.”

Although he said it was ‘advice,’ his tone carried an indisputable authority.

Xu Yunfan’s heart chilled. He immediately lowered his head deeply, hiding the fleeting glimmer of stability in his eyes brought by the certainty of his Attribute Panel trump card. “This disciple understands. I dare not hold any attachment to this body. From this day forward, I shall act as if I never severed this clone!”

Just as he lowered his head, a line of system information silently appeared on the Attribute Panel, visible only to him.

‘The Yunji Clone cultivated from the Xuandu Bajing Liantian Zaohua Yunji has succeeded.’

His gaze shifted to the Skills column on the Attribute Panel.

The Yunji Clone characteristic of the *Xuandu Bajing Liantian Zaohua Yunji* now showed the words: ‘Strong Control x2’.

With a slight movement of his mind, the True Body Dao Form that had merged into the stone embryo was fully under his control. It was like a marionette; as long as he willed it, he could take control at any time. Even if separated by an infinite void, everything the True Body Dao Form saw, heard, thought, and felt was clearly reflected in his Sea of Consciousness.

Every flow of Primordial Qi within the Profound Yellow Stone Embryo, the flickering frequency of the Buddhist rune specks, and even the tremors of the Martial Dao True Intent deep within the stone core were all under his absolute control.

The golden words ‘Strong Control x2’ on the Attribute Panel shone brilliantly, clearly indicating that the Attribute Panel’s Strong Control attribute had completely surpassed the authority barriers of the Yunji Clone technique itself.

Now, he was relieved.

Even if Lu Chunyang used the手段 (methods) of a Golden Core True Lord to recast the stone embryo and completely sever the threads of karma. Even if the Bodhi Pure Land were to use the incense and offerings of the Buddhist nation to soak it day and night. Even if the True Body Dao Form were to truly孕育 (give birth to) an independent intelligence, and the clone Han Shi was full of rebellious intent, the deep binding of its origin to the Attribute Panel had already become an established law.

To him, the stone embryo was now merely a living vessel storing Buddhist karma. Even if a Vajra Buddha personally descended to guide it, they could not erase the强制指令 (compulsory instructions) imprinted by the Panel on the root of the True Body Dao Form.

Perhaps it could be of great use later.

随后 (Subsequently), Lu Chunyang gently swept his sleeve, wrapping up the now fully formed True Body Dao Form—which faintly shone with spiritual light—and the residual Profound Yellow Primordial Qi around it.

The sword light tore through the spatial barrier of the Dongxu Heavenly Realm. Like a meteor falling toward the mortal world, it transformed into a dazzling流光 (streak of light) and shot directly toward the demon-qi-wreathed Eastern Wilderness, vanishing in the endless void in the blink of an eye.

***

Bodhi Pure Land, Summit of Mount Sumeru, Bodhi Spirit Platform.

Sanzang, who had returned not long ago and was seated in meditative concentration on his lotus throne, suddenly opened his eyes. The golden Buddhist light flowing within them trembled violently.

He looked up toward the Eastern Void, and rare suspicion arose between his eyebrows. “The牵引 (pull) of the Buddhist connection... has it been completely shifted to the Eastern Wilderness? That wisp of ‘Dao Seed’ aura, which is vital to the王佛 (King Buddha), why has it suddenly taken root in the barbaric, demon-infested land?”

“Good indeed.”

The shadow of a Twelve-Petaled Lotus Throne bloomed in the void beside him, and the Bodhisattva Miaodi manifested her Dharma Form. Her jade fingers moved in calculation, and boundless Sanskrit characters were born and destroyed at her fingertips, causing the incense and offerings of the surrounding Buddhist nations to surge like tides.

Her eyes reflected a scene spanning an infinite distance.

On an unnamed mountain peak in the Eastern Wilderness, a zhang-high Profound Yellow boulder was greedily swallowing the purple qi of the early morning. At its core, the dark golden “卍” character Buddhist rune and the Black Water Xuanwu Dao Rhyme intertwined and shone.

“Excellent手段 (methods)!”

A ripple of emotion passed through the usually tranquil eyes of the Bodhisattva Miaodi, as if she recalled the world-shaking Sword Intent wielded by Lu Chunyang during the great slaughter of the war between the three sects.

“Lu Chunyang used the ‘No-Return Sword Intent’ as a blade to forcibly peel away the Buddhist karma of that junior named Xu. Furthermore, he refined the fundamental Dao Rhyme of the *True武 Subduing Demons True Sutra* into nourishment, sealing it entirely within this ‘Profound Yellow Embryo Stone’ born from the void’s creative marvel. Sword Intent transformed into an embryo, karma changed its master... This method of stealing the sky and replacing the sun has already touched the extreme realm of the Sword Dao, the origin of creation!”

Sanzang abruptly rose, his moon-white monk’s robe fluttering without wind. “Severing karma alone is already unbelievable, yet he was able to refine an entire Martial Dao True Sutra into nourishment for a Dao Embryo? Could it be that Lu Chunyang...”

He took a deep breath, his voice trembling with disbelief, “has already touched the threshold of the late Golden Core stage?!”

“The late Golden Core stage?”

The Bodhisattva Miaodi shook her head slightly. The wisdom light flowing on her lotus throne reflected a profound depth that saw through the secrets of heaven. “With the foundation of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, all ‘Sword Dao Seats’ that point directly to the late Golden Core stage are locked down by the other True Lords using their own Sword Domains. In the Taihua Lingxu World, the number of seats is limited. Even if Lu Chunyang is shockingly brilliant and his Sword Intent reaches the heavens...”

She paused, her voice carrying a tone of finality, “He will ultimately be unable to break through that iron-barrier-like enclosure of seats.”
