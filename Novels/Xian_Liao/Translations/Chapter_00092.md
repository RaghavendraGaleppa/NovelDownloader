# Chapter 92: Ascending Dragon Pill

"Leader, the capital's sudden upheaval presents us with a perfect opportunity."

The Anping Dao sect leader had four kings under his command: the Snake King, Eagle King, Turtle King, and Lion King. All under thirty years old, each had already cultivated their martial arts to the Gangjin level.

The prime period for martial cultivation was between eighteen and thirty years old—a time of vigorous advancement when one's vital energy continuously rose to its peak.

In terms of combat prowess, each of the four possessed strength ranking within the top ten of the Black List.

More remarkably, all four had followed the Anping Dao leader since childhood, personally trained by him, and each possessed independent military and political capabilities. The rapid establishment of Anping Dao's foothold in the north owed much to their contributions.

Even now, with each wielding considerable power, they still regarded their leader with godlike reverence.

For the leader possessed a rare spiritual constitution—naturally able to communicate with spirits, perceive what ordinary people could not, and most importantly, foresee fortune and misfortune.

He had long sensed great danger in the capital, thus refraining from directly attacking this most prosperous region under heaven.

Since Anping Dao's uprising began, every life-or-death crisis had been navigated under the leader's guidance.

"Though you all possess remarkable skills, your hopes of breaking through to the Innate Realm remain slim—as do mine. Now, with four Innate masters appearing simultaneously, I believe this may present an opportunity for us," the leader calmly assessed.

Previously, the only known Innate masters were the Profound Yin Patriarch and the Grassland Martial Sage. Due to conflicting positions, alliance with either was impossible. During the barbarian invasions, Anping Dao had even ambushed them several times, suffering significant losses.

Now with the Profound Yin Patriarch dead and four new Innate masters emerging, this was truly an opportunity.

Previously, Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu's Innate status was known, assumed to be like the Profound Yin Patriarch and Grassland Martial Sage—achieved through rare opportunities and heavenly tribulations. But four Innate masters appearing simultaneously suggested deeper secrets to a perceptive mind like the Anping Dao leader's.

"Leader, are you suggesting cooperation with them?"

"With no clear ruler, the world finds peace. I believe this is an unprecedented turning point. Someone like Zhou Qing likely has broad vision—this dynasty's fall may herald a new era unlike any before." The leader possessed extensive records on Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu.

"How could it differ? 'Emperors take turns, this year it's our family's turn.' That's how it's been for millennia," grumbled the Lion King, a blunt man.

The leader smiled faintly. "Each year grows colder. Let the people cultivate wastelands while spring lasts. At least we needn't fear wartime disruptions to spring planting now."

The assembly obeyed the leader's decree.

After they departed, the leader pondered. His spiritual constitution made him acutely sensitive to omens—the capital felt like a man-eating beast best avoided. Initially he attributed this to the Profound Yin Patriarch, but now suspected the four Innate masters were the true cause.

Innate masters in their early twenties—he understood better than the imperial court's incompetents what this signified. Having wandered half his life across mountains and rivers without finding his own path to the Innate Realm, how could four achieve it so young without extraordinary means?

"Ancient legends speak of inheriting primordial Qi cultivators' techniques to reach the Innate Realm. Could Zhou Qing have obtained such? But how explain four Innate masters? Could their predecessors' legacy be so profound? Or is he perhaps a celestial reincarnation?"

Recalling Zhou Qing's legendary memory, becoming a provincial scholar at fifteen, vast knowledge, authoring the Treatise on Plagues, and peerless medical skills—these traits mirrored another Jingyang Zhenren reborn. It was said Jingyang possessed innate wisdom, like a celestial incarnation.

"After spring planting, I'll send a letter proposing a meeting. If he proves extraordinary, why not make Anping Dao his wings?" the leader resolved.

Though he could foresee fortune, inevitable death couldn't be altered. If the four Innate masters proved overwhelmingly powerful, he'd have to abandon Anping Dao for the mountains—though this would betray his followers and the people he'd saved during the uprising.

Without reaching the Innate Realm, immortality remained out of reach. But even without eternal life, leaving behind a glorious legacy would make his earthly journey meaningful.

Zhou Qing's group dissected the demonic tree, extracting its blood core. With Fushan, Zhou Qing researched using the tree as spiritual firewood, discovering it enhanced alchemy when combined with True Qi.

Previously, Zhou Qing learned the tree's essence concentrated in its blood core could accelerate herb maturation via the Evergreen Immortality Technique. Now they found the remnants served as excellent alchemical fuel, improving pill quality.

Six-leaf ginseng refined with this fuel and subterranean fire produced Elixirs of Vitality approaching one-third the potency of seven-leaf versions. While six-leaf ginseng was rare, the imperial court's century of stockpiling through tributes still yielded five remaining specimens—this after the emperor's wasteful alchemical experiments.

Zhou Qing estimated this corresponded to Fushan's physical cultivation level—the threshold of the Innate Realm. Simultaneously, reaching Qi Refinement's fourth layer enhanced his spiritual sense to the peak of the fifth layer, nearing breakthrough.

This rapid progress stemmed not just from cultivation but from integrating the Formless Mind Technique with Pure Heart Mantra and reciting sage texts—especially after his transformative battle with the old eunuch.

If Zhou Qing had obtained the Formless Mind Technique years earlier, he suspected his spiritual sense might have reached the seventh or eighth layer by now.

After reaching the fourth layer, the Ascending Dragon Pill's effects diminished significantly—less than half potency initially, weakening further with each subsequent dose. "Time to research new formulas," Zhou Qing mused. With the imperial house eliminated, theoretically all of Great Zhou's cultivation resources now lay open to him—pending secular consolidation.

Then arrived the Anping Dao leader's letter.

Fushan interrupted their banter: "Enough chatter—prepare for alchemy." The group focused intently. As Zhou Qing noted, while he had time for trial and error, each missed opportunity for cultivation-enhancing elixirs represented significant loss.

After three days and nights, the Ascending Dragon Pills were successfully refined. "The spiritual firewood truly improves success rates and quality," Fushan remarked, inhaling the medicinal aroma appreciatively.

Zhou Qing smiled. "We're still inexperienced. Perhaps we'll hunt another giant serpent for practice." The group eagerly envisioned slaying an even mightier serpent-dragon.

Distributing the pills, Zhou Qing naturally took the largest share before retiring to meditate. Currently, the pills benefited Zhou Qing and Zhang Jingxiu most—Qi Refinement heavily depended on spiritual cultivation. Without sufficient spiritual strength, breakthroughs risked losing control over one's power.

The Ascending Dragon Pill, refined from a demon beast's core, also possessed body-transforming properties, benefiting both physical and Qi cultivation.

Upon consuming his first pill, Zhou Qing encountered the red serpent's residual spirit within—instantly crushed by his formidable spiritual power. He observed his Health Preservation System absorbing the purified spirit energy, partially replenishing his Intermediate Literary Core.

This discovery suggested pill refinement could purify spirit energy like the Great Mulberry Tree's soul fruits, benefiting his Health Preservation System. Zhou Qing recognized the Literary Core's importance in overcoming cultivation bottlenecks—higher realms would require more advanced cores.

Suddenly concerned for his martial brothers' weaker spiritual cultivation, Zhou Qing rushed to guard Fushan and Fushong during their pill consumption. Thanks to their shared Evergreen Immortality Technique roots and Zhou Qing's Formless Mind mastery, he easily suppressed the serpent spirits within them, transferring the energy to his own system.

However, one pill left their True Qi unstable—they'd need stronger spiritual foundations before further consumption. Checking on Zhang Jingxiu, Zhou Qing found the old master had effortlessly refined the serpent spirit via his Sun-Moon Spirit Refining technique, even expanding his spiritual range.

"Expected—repeated pill use diminishes effects," Zhang Jingxiu remarked philosophically when Zhou Qing expressed concern about decreasing returns. Zhou Qing left expressionless—annoyed the typically unreliable elder had proven competent this time.

Returning to solitary cultivation, Zhou Qing easily broke through to the fourth Qi Refinement layer with the pills' aid. "I truly only lacked proper elixirs," he reflected. Though stranded in this spiritual wasteland, with sufficient resources, progress remained possible.

The fourth layer represented mid-stage Qi Refinement, equivalent to second-stage physical cultivation. The breakthrough enhanced his physique beyond the pill's effects alone—Qi Refinement inherently tempered the body, though less effectively than dedicated physical cultivation.

As Green Spiritzi had noted, even with marrow-cleansing elixirs and vitality-enhancing pills, he'd only achieved first-stage physical cultivation upon reaching fourth-layer Qi Refinement—comparable to Fushong's level at the Innate threshold.
