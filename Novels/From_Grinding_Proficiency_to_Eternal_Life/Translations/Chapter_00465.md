Chapter 465: Discovery

He was actually going to enter the Divine Martial Realm again?

His thoughts churned.

The True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture and the Martial Dao Eye of Providence obtained in the Divine Martial Realm back then were still the foundation of his security and livelihood to this day.

Now that the opportunity had reappeared, was there truly a karmic connection at play?

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred.

Xu Yunfan paced to the window, looking out at the gradually dissipating afterglow of the Buddhist light beyond the pass.

Since the Fulong Arhat had left, there would be no major troubles in the short term. The timing for exploring the Divine Martial Realm had already matured.

It had been less than a hundred years since the end of the great war of the three sects. Under Xu Yunfan’s relaxed management for the past twenty years, Cold Goose Pass had seen its market scale expand to more than three times its original size since he first arrived. The monthly tax revenue had skyrocketed from the initial 100,000 to over 230,000.

The loose cultivators even spontaneously built a "Ghost Market" outside the city walls, specifically trading strange treasures and rare goods collected from all over the Northern Continent.

Xu Yunfan did not stop them upon seeing this; he simply sent Zhou Lu to collect taxes.

Although those loose cultivators cursed "Xu the Skinner" behind his back, grinding their teeth in hatred, not a single one had ever left Cold Goose Pass.

This border fortress was located at the forefront of the Primordial Origin Sect’s territory, forming a tripartite confrontation with the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect of the Southern Continent and the Bodhi Pure Land of the Western Continent.

Its unique geographical location made it an important hub for the exchange of goods between the three continents. Every day, merchant caravans from all sides traded here, transporting Northern Continent specialties to the South and bringing Southern Continent rarities back to the North.

Even after being skinned by Xu Yunfan, there was still profit to be made.

What was even more rare was that the tax revenue submitted over the years had risen steadily. From the initial 100,000 spirit stones per month to the current stable level of over 230,000, this report card even drew rare praise from True Lord Qingyuan.

Even more rare was that the three major sects had remained at peace for these twenty years.

The Primordial Demon Sect was busy digesting the newly acquired Suspended Mountain in the Northern Continent; the Bodhi Pure Land seemed to have turned its focus to preaching in the Eastern Wasteland; and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, having just fought the Primordial Origin Sect not long ago, naturally needed to catch its breath.

This delicate balance gave Xu Yunfan a rare breathing spell.

He calculated with his fingers; according to True Lord Baiyue’s prophecy, there were still twenty to thirty years before the eruption of the Primordial Clear and Turbid Qi.

This period of time was neither too long nor too short. To a mortal, it was almost half a lifetime, but to a Foundation Establishment cultivator, it was merely a medium-sized seclusion.

"There is no need to rush for now..."

Xu Yunfan’s gaze swept over the densely packed buildings within the pass. The shopkeepers in the stores flying the Primordial Demon Sect flags were busy tallying today’s profits.

Such a peaceful scene was already a world apart from the oppressive atmosphere when he first arrived twenty years ago.

Suddenly, his divine sense sank into his storage bag. The six magic treasures he had refined over the past twenty years were quietly floating inside. Among them, the Azure Chain Sword suddenly trembled slightly, resonating subtly with the aura of the Divine Martial Realm from his deduction.

"So that's how it is!"

A sharp light flashed in Xu Yunfan’s eyes.

The Heavenly Work Forging Technique obtained in the Divine Martial Realm back then, when combined with the Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture, actually secretly aligned with the artifact refining ways of that realm.

The Gang and Sha qi he needed to find now could likely only be found in the Divine Martial Realm.

After returning from crossing realms last time, he discovered the time difference between the two sides was roughly one to three. If he went again this time, he wouldn't have to worry about the situation in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World changing drastically. However, to be safe, he still needed to leave a backup plan in his cave dwelling.

Xu Yunfan pointed his fingers like a sword, drawing seven talisman seals in the void. He then took out quite a few spiritual materials from his dimensional ring.

As the Eight Sceneries Cloud Qi surged, extracting the spiritual marrow from these materials, a doppelgänger with an aura identical to his own gradually took shape.

This was the "Cloud Scripture Doppelgänger Technique" recorded in the Xuan Du Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture. Although it was only an artifact-refining physical body, it was enough to deceive the inspection of a Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator.

Seeing the doppelgänger that was identical to him, even down to the aura, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but silently praise it. The Xuan Du Eight Sceneries was truly miraculous; he wondered where Li Baichuan had obtained it. He had a gold mine but didn't know it!

"Fellow Daoist!" The doppelgänger bowed to Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan returned the bow. "I hope Fellow Daoist will guard Cold Goose Pass."

The doppelgänger said solemnly, "It shall be so."

"It is time to depart."

He took one last look at the darkening sky outside Cold Goose Pass and turned to walk toward the inter-realm array platform deep within the cave dwelling.

Cold Goose Pass was a strategic town, so naturally, it had a传送 array platform set up. As long as one used an inter-realm talisman to make slight adjustments, it could achieve the effect of crossing realms. It was simply a matter of expending more spiritual power to connect to the Primordial Origin Sect’s realm gate.

As the True Martial spiritual power surged, the inter-realm runes carved on the array platform lit up one after another.

Xu Yunfan could feel the karmic line of his Martial Dao in the Divine Martial Realm now exerting a strong pulling force.

Xu Yunfan felt the space and time in front of him twist, with eight-colored streams of light rapidly swirling by his side.

By the time his vision cleared, he was already standing in a gray, misty world.

He subconsciously activated the Martial Dao Eye of Providence. As the vertical mark on his forehead opened and closed, the true appearance of the entire Divine Martial Realm was revealed in minute detail.

This realm was actually suspended in the Chaos like a glass cup, with spiderweb-like cracks covering its boundaries. The trends of the earth veins were shallow as a painting, and the spiritual energy was so thin it was almost dried up. Only in a few places where martial artists gathered did some blood energy still churn.

What shocked him most was the structure of the sky. The boundary membrane, which should have been thick, was as thin as a cicada’s wing. Through it, he could vaguely see the Clear and Turbid Qi flowing from the outside constantly seeping in.

"So that's how it is..."

Xu Yunfan lightly touched the void with his fingertips. The unique divine sense reflection of a Foundation Establishment cultivator allowed him to understand instantly.

The last time he came, it wasn't like this. Now, as his cultivation level has deepened, he finally has a different perspective.

This was no complete world; it was clearly a subsidiary small realm attached to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

No wonder the Primordial Origin Sect could use it as a trial secret ground.

The Dao of this realm was incomplete; it couldn't even withstand a full-force strike from a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Now, looking back from the perspective of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he discovered that the rules of this realm had many traces of artificial modification.

The so-called "practicing the fake to become real" by martial artists was merely a superficial method of simulating the Qi absorption of the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

And those so-called martial arts masters at the Land Immortal Realm were, at best, equivalent to Qi Condensation Great Perfection cultivators.

"Eh?"

Xu Yunfan’s pupils suddenly constricted.

Under the illumination of the Martial Dao Eye of Providence, the core of the Divine Martial Realm was actually entangled with dozens of golden chains, each extending into the unknown depths of the void.

These chains were not physical; they were some kind of restraint on rules that only high-level cultivators could perceive.

It was absolutely a sealing method laid down by a True Lord!

A True Lord of the Primordial Origin Sect!

He immediately felt a chill run down his spine.

When he obtained the True Martial Subduing Devil Scripture back then, because he had entered the Lin state using the Lin character mantra and his mind had reached the Supreme, he had sensed a pair of eyes watching him from the void.

Now that he thought about it, that probably wasn't an illusion.

A certain True Lord had long treated this place as a nursery, and the so-called "Primordial Gold Nature" was merely bait they had deliberately left behind.

After all, according to the records of the Primordial Origin Sect, the Divine Martial Realm opens once every sixty years. Each time, disciples obtain opportunities, but no one has ever truly touched the core secret.
