# Chapter 455: The Demon Sect's Blessed Land

"He also mentioned that Manager Mo keeps a separate set of three-tenths of the hidden accounts... The net commission she collects each month is no less than one hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones."

One hundred thousand spirit stones?!

And they were mid-grade!

Xu Yunfan secretly sucked in a cold breath. No wonder the Primordial Origin Sect had expended countless personnel here. This place was a blessed land that naturally aligned with many of the sect's techniques, so much so that even the True Lords had clashed several times to seize it.

One hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones.

Even in the eyes of a True Lord, this was an extremely substantial income.

No wonder there was a rotation system. If a single True Lord were to guard it, the others would naturally be dissatisfied. A rotation was indeed the best option.

"Who is managing the marketplace now?"

"It's... it's Manager Mo from the Hundred Desires Peak," Zhou Lu said with his head bowed and eyes lowered. "Her niece is married to the cousin of the White Cliff Peak's deacon disciple."

Xu Yunfan's eyebrows raised slightly upon hearing this, and he casually glanced at Zhou Lu.

Zhou Lu bowed his body even lower.

This old fox...

"Starting tomorrow," Xu Yunfan's voice made everyone shudder. "All cultivators will work in three shifts. Zhou Lu, you will take people to repair the array patterns on the eastern side."

He paused, then said indifferently, "As for the marketplace... have that Manager Mo bring me all the commissions collected tomorrow."

It was very simple. Since Manager Mo hadn't come to see him on his first day of duty, he would just lay it all out. If she handed it over obediently, he might spare her life out of consideration for the Hundred Desires True Lord. If not, they would meet inside the Ten Thousand Souls Banner.

After gaining a general understanding and dealing with matters according to his preferences, he left Zhou Lu in full charge.

Watching the old man walk out of the palace, Xu Yunfan retracted his gaze coldly.

This old man was not honest in his heart and had concealed much. If Xu Yunfan hadn't been a martial artist who entered the Dao and could observe the human body at a microscopic level, he might not have discovered it.

The words Zhou Lu had just spoken carried a hint of instigation.

His fingertips silently formed a seal within his sleeve.

A wisp of his spiritual sense, like a venomous snake, silently coiled around Zhou Lu's hunched back. The spiritual pressure of a Foundation Establishment True Master silently spread along the threads of cause and effect.

The moment the gray-robed old man stepped out of the palace gate, his figure paused imperceptibly.

His murky eyes clouded over with a hint of confusion, as if a thin mist had covered his mind. Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense gently plucked within his sea of consciousness, like plucking a zither string. Zhou Lu's originally tense back gradually relaxed, and his breathing became even.

This was the method of a Foundation Establishment True Master's spiritual sense reflection. It wasn't fatal, but it could cloud a person's mind without them knowing, gradually leading them into an abyss.

To be more specific, it was falling into a killing trap.

Zhou Lu stood outside the palace, dazed for a moment, then suddenly felt that the new garrison commander's arrangement was natural and even developed the illusion that he had "met a wise master."

He touched the account book in his sleeve and actually ran through the locations of several hidden accounts in his mind, preparing to present them all tomorrow.

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up imperceptibly.

When he withdrew his spiritual sense, he deliberately left a mark on the thread of cause and effect.

From now on, every time Zhou Lu harbored a trace of greed or a sliver of treacherous intent, it would feel like a thorn in his back. In the end, he would only become more dependent on the garrison commander's "grace and might."

The moonlight outside the palace was pale, casting a long, distorted shadow on Zhou Lu's receding figure, like the strings of a puppet.

After settling matters, Xu Yunfan naturally went to inspect the city wall of Cold Crow Pass.

The moment he ascended the city wall, the scene before him made his pupils contract sharply.

Below the pass lay a black river over a hundred miles wide. The ink-like water was so viscous it seemed almost solid, reflecting an eerie oily sheen under the pale moonlight.

Most terrifying were the countless pale arms floating densely on the river's surface. They would sometimes stretch out as if to claim lives, and sometimes curl up as if in struggle, just like thousands of drowning people endlessly flailing.

When the mountain wind swept across the river surface, those arms trembled in unison, and waves of piercing wails rose from the bottom of the river.

The sound was layered, as if thousands of vengeful spirits were crying out simultaneously, making the hair on the back of one's neck stand on end.

These were mostly the souls of cultivators who had fallen in the great battles at Cold Crow Pass over the years and were sunk into the Nether River by the Primordial Origin Sect.

There weren't that many at first, but Cold Crow Pass had existed for too long and was a blessed land that naturally aligned with the Primordial Origin Sect.

Over ten thousand years, the number of cultivators and mortals sunk into the Nether River was innumerable.

The river water corroded both bone and soul, yet it made them unable to die, repeating the cycle of sinking and floating day after day.

Several newly discarded corpses on the shore were slowly sinking. The rotting flesh was eroded away by the river water, revealing white bones.

And the arms that had sunk to the bottom would soon float to the surface again, continuing this eternal torture.

Those who were sunk into this Nether River would generally never be reborn. To escape this sinking, only salvation could help.

The next morning, as the first wisp of purple energy passed over the surface of the Nether River, Xu Yunfan was seated in the Xuanming Pavilion at the highest point of Cold Crow Pass.

The spiritual energy here was so dense it almost turned tangible. Gray-black spiritual qi, like living things, coiled around him, making it a perfect yin-attributed land.

He cultivated the True Martial Subdue Demon Sutra, which involved the seamless circulation of yin and yang and the method of the Turtle and Snake. This extreme yin land was indeed an excellent place for his cultivation.

The True Martial Subdue Demon Sutra circulating within Xu Yunfan's body was automatically breathing the extreme yin spiritual qi of the Xuanming Pavilion. The shadows of the turtle and snake flickered in his Dantian.

At this moment, the gray-black spiritual qi flowed into his meridians like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, condensing into the image of a coiling black snake at his spine.

The Nether River's Yin energy, accumulated for ten thousand years at Cold Crow Pass, was actually the best nourishment for cultivating the 'Turtle Coiling Snake' divine form. This was somewhat unexpected.

Suddenly, the sound of delicate jade pendants came from outside the pavilion.

Before an announcement could be made, a woman in a crimson dress was already kneeling below the jade steps. The nine-luan golden hairpin on her head swayed gently with her kowtows, casting scattered specks of light on the bluestone ground.

"Hundred Desires Peak's Mo Qingtang greets the Garrison Commander True Master."

Her voice was as soft as if soaked in honey, each word carrying a perfectly measured tremor.

Xu Yunfan opened his eyes. With a thought of his heart, the gates of the Xuanming Pavilion opened on their own without wind. His first sight was of the woman below the steps maintaining a full prostration, her hands raised high above her head, holding a gold-trimmed storage bag.

From his angle, he could just see the faintly visible pink lotus tattoo on the back of her neck. It was the mark of a core disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak.

If he wasn't mistaken, this person should be a true-disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak. Three inches below her navel, there should also be a demonic tattoo formed by the Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Great Method.

"Rise and speak."

Xu Yunfan hooked his fingertip, and the storage bag flew into his palm through the air. A sweep of his spiritual sense confirmed that this month's one hundred thousand mid-grade spirit stones were all present, and on top were three extra pills emanating a peach-colored mist.

He couldn't help but sneer. The Hundred Desires Peak had truly grasped the rules of "atonement" thoroughly.

Only then did Mo Qingtang dare to straighten her body, but she still knelt without daring to stand up.

The morning light now slanted in, finally illuminating her appearance.

Below her distant mountain-like eyebrows were slightly upturned phoenix eyes, the corners of which were outlined with gold powder in the shape of a butterfly about to take flight. Her lips were as red as if she had just drunk blood, yet the corners of her mouth naturally carried a hint of a smile.
