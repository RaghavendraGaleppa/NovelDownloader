# Chapter 56: Fellow Disciples at Each Other's Throats

Apart from Ye Tian, there were three junior disciples following him. Two of them were identical in appearance—short and stocky—clearly twin brothers. The third was tall and lanky, with an ordinary and somewhat dull-looking face.

Hidden in the bushes, Lin Xuan remained motionless but began pondering. Among the disciples who entered the valley at the same time, Ye Tian stood out with his exceptional talent, ranking easily within the top five in cultivation. He was a genius favored by the elders, usually arrogant and disdainful toward weaker fellow disciples. Why was he acting so unusually today?

The Song brothers and the tall, lanky youth possessed spiritual roots, but they were of the inferior kind. Their current cultivation was only at the third layer of the Lingdong Stage. Given Ye Tian's temperament, he would never associate with such "fools" as his junior brothers. What scheme was he plotting?

Lin Xuan's curiosity was piqued, and he quietly extended his spiritual sense to observe more closely.

"Senior Brother Ye, shall we roast our catch here? I'll go hunt some game," said the elder of the Song brothers excitedly. Usually, they endured no shortage of scorn and disdain from their fellow disciples. Today, they had unexpectedly managed to ingratiate themselves with an elite disciple like Ye Tian. Naturally, they wanted to make a good impression, hoping that with his favor, they might suffer less bullying in the future.

"No need to rush." Ye Tian smiled and patted his shoulder, then took out a gourd from his storage bracelet. "After climbing such a high mountain, you must be thirsty. This is an immortal wine I brewed myself, infused with many rare medicinal herbs. It greatly aids cultivation. Why don't you three try some?"

"This..." Song Xiong was stunned, his face filled with astonishment. Ye Tian's invitation alone had already left him and his brother flattered beyond measure. After all, Ye Tian was an elite disciple cherished by their masters. They had originally planned to curry favor, but now he was acting even more warmly than they had expected.

Hearing that the wine could enhance cultivation, a flash of greed crossed his face, though he pretended to decline. "Senior Brother, this is your treasure. I haven't done anything to deserve such a gift..."

"Haha, we're fellow disciples—why stand on ceremony? Drink!" Ye Tian waved his hand with a magnanimous expression.

"Then I'll humbly accept." Song Xiong had never truly intended to refuse. Taking the gourd, he gulped down several large mouthfuls.

Ye Tian smiled gently, his expression serene, but deep in his eyes, a vicious glint flickered briefly before vanishing.

Song Xiong wiped his mouth and handed the gourd back, but Ye Tian didn’t take it. "I can't favor one over the other. Junior Brothers, you should have some too."

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

The younger Song brother, Song Hu, was even more impulsive than his elder sibling. After a quick word of thanks, he grabbed the gourd and drank deeply.

"Hey, Senior Brother Song, save some for me!" The tall, lanky youth, worried the wine would run out, quickly urged Song Hu to stop, who reluctantly put the gourd down.

The lanky youth then drank greedily.

Watching coldly from the sidelines, Lin Xuan curled his lips in a mocking sneer. Though he didn’t know Ye Tian’s exact scheme, it was undoubtedly harmful to the trio. They were eagerly leaping into a trap he had set. 

Lin Xuan saw this clearly but had no intention of intervening. While he could likely handle Ye Tian, why meddle in others' affairs? 

Trouble comes from speaking too much; sorrow stems from forcing oneself into the spotlight. Lin Xuan wasn’t inherently wicked, but he was far from a saint. Unless there was sufficient benefit, he wouldn’t lift a finger.

The world of cultivation was bloody and ruthless. Lin Xuan had long learned the wisdom of self-preservation.

Whatever consequences arose would be borne by those three alone. Besides, they had no ties to him. In fact, despite their poor spiritual roots and slow progress—and the ridicule they suffered from fellow disciples—they had once enjoyed bullying those even weaker than themselves, including Lin Xuan. 

Not kicking them while they were down was already an act of great mercy on his part. To repay their malice with kindness? Dream on. He wasn’t that foolish.

"Senior Brother Ye, we've finished the wine. I'll go hunt now. Please rest here," Song Xiong said, still eager to please. But as soon as he finished speaking, his expression twisted. He swayed, then collapsed with a thud.

"Brother!" Song Hu cried out in shock, but as he moved to help, he too felt the world spin around him, his legs giving way.

The lanky disciple, having drunk plenty of the medicated wine, met the same fate.

"Senior Brother Ye, you—!" The three weren’t fools. By now, they realized he had tampered with the wine.

"Senior Brother Ye, I’ve never wronged you! There’s no grudge between us!"

"That’s right, Senior Brother! If there’s been some misunderstanding, I’ll apologize!"

Panic and fury warred within them, but they knew better than to provoke a stronger opponent. They pleaded desperately, bewildered. They were only at the third layer of the Lingdong Stage—even combined, they stood no chance against Ye Tian’s fifth-layer strength. 

If he merely wanted to teach them a lesson, drugging them was unnecessary. His true intentions were unclear, making their terror all the greater.

They tried channeling their spiritual power, only to find their dantians sealed. Not a wisp of energy could be summoned, deepening their dread.

"Don’t waste your effort," Ye Tian said smugly, his mask of kindness finally slipping to reveal cruelty. "You’ve drunk Forbidden Spirit Wine. For three hours, your cultivation is useless."

"Haha, Senior Brother, why joke like this?" Song Xiong forced a smile, though Ye Tian’s murderous aura prickled his skin like needles. He couldn’t recall ever offending him, but he clung to a sliver of hope.

"Joke? Do I look like I’m joking?" Ye Tian’s gaze was icy. "Blame your bad luck. My Hundred Souls Banner requires the souls of three cultivators to reach completion. You’ll have the honor of becoming its sacrifices."

"Sacrifices? A demonic artifact?" 

At those words, the trio’s faces twisted in terror. They trembled, trying to flee, but the Forbidden Spirit Wine not only sealed their power—it sapped their strength. Every effort was futile.
