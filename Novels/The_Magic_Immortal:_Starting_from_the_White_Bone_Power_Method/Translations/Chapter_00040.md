# Chapter 40: White Mountain Token  

The flying vessel glided over mountains and rivers without a sound, far quieter than the one Wang Chan had rented last time—he much preferred this one.  

Though slightly smaller, it boasted decent defenses and remarkable silence.  

The price of fifty spirit coins for a round trip did sting a bit, especially since the previous rental had only cost ten.  

Since Ning Jingming had agreed to split the travel expenses for their medical excursions, Wang Chan couldn’t very well let Ning cover the entire cost.  

After all, maintaining a long-term partnership required mutual consideration.  

Truthfully, running the three hundred li from the Black River Market to Green Bamboo Mountain wouldn’t have been too strenuous—a good sweat would’ve been pleasant, even, and a chance to temper his body.  

But Ning Jingming had insisted on taking the safer flying vessel.  

The wilderness had grown restless lately.  

To accommodate this, the rental service had even provided a dedicated cultivator to pilot the vessel—a mid-stage Qi Refining male cultivator who, unfortunately, seemed rather awkward. He had already shot Ning Jingming three covert glances.  

With a thick beard, a buzz cut, and narrow eyes...  

Attention was flattering, but not when it came from another man. Ning Jingming’s expression darkened further.  

Noticing this, Wang Chan grinned and instinctively retreated to a corner of the deck, putting as much distance between himself and the pilot as possible.  

He respected personal preferences, but self-preservation came first.  

Conversation between two men was already sparse; adding a peculiar third made it even more unnecessary.  

Bored after a while of watching the scenery, Wang Chan turned his attention to his status panel.  

**Divine Abilities (1/3):** *Dragon’s Vigor, Tiger’s Ferocity* (Mid-grade, Divine Patterns: 10/54)  

This month, despite wind and rain, he had trained relentlessly, earning a full thirty experience points—all invested into *Dragon’s Vigor, Tiger’s Ferocity*.  

The sooner he maxed it out and ascended it to high-grade, the sooner he’d gain a formidable trump card.  

This ability excelled in offense, defense, and speed—a rare and potent combination, equivalent to mastering three separate spells or wielding three distinct magical artifacts.  

It was the first time Wang Chan had encountered such a versatile divine ability.  

Truly, the system’s products were of exceptional quality.  

As expected, advancing a mid-grade ability required three experience points per divine pattern.  

Back when he first upgraded *Withered Glory Needle*, he had anticipated this.  

Low-grade abilities cost one point per layer.  

Mid-grade, naturally, demanded more.  

The power difference between low and mid-grade was significant—it wouldn’t make sense otherwise.  

By his calculations, 162 points would be needed to fully upgrade *Dragon’s Vigor, Tiger’s Ferocity* to its 54-layer limit.  

Less than half a year’s effort.  

The real question was how much experience would be required for its divine ascension.  

Even at ten layers, the ability had surpassed expectations—three punches had been enough to obliterate that voluptuous female cultivator, despite her mid-grade protective talisman.  

The sheer exhilaration of shattering her defenses with his fists had been intoxicating.  

How much stronger would it be at full power?  

And after ascension to high-grade?  

“Heh…”  

Wang Chan couldn’t help but chuckle.  

Next, he checked his spells:  

**Spells (1/3):** *Revitalizing Cloud-Pushing Art* (Low-grade, Spell Seals: 3/27)  

This low-grade spell had become somewhat redundant for Wang Chan now. Its ceiling was mid-grade at best—hardly impressive.  

Yet it occupied a slot, leaving only two more available for new spells. Unfortunately, there was no way to remove it.  

Back when he first awakened his golden finger, he had haphazardly registered it without much choice.  

---  

The flying vessel arrived smoothly at Green Bamboo Mountain.  

After passing inspection by the local guards—organized by resident cultivators to counter the growing unrest—Wang Chan and Ning Jingming made their way to Qu Lian’s residence.  

Seated.  

Sipping tea.  

Qu Lian remained as gentle and radiant as ever.  

But this time, their meeting took place not in the courtyard, but in an underground chamber.  

The chamber resembled an elegant study, suffused with the fragrance of spirit incense and tea. Warm yellow spirit stones embedded in the walls and shelves cast a cozy glow.  

Compared to his own dingy cave, Wang Chan almost wished he could move in.  

Most striking was the formation enveloping the chamber—layers of illusory mountain peaks swirling around them, exuding a profound sense of security.  

This was the *Minor Mountain Chain Formation*, a renowned mid-grade defensive array. Wang Chan discreetly counted about forty-nine mountain illusions, indicating forty-nine layers of formation seals.  

Mid-grade formations were even pricier than mid-grade artifacts.  

Market prices started at five thousand spirit coins, with each additional seal adding another two hundred.  

This single formation was worth over ten thousand coins.  

Suddenly, Wang Chan’s recent windfall felt insignificant.  

Even if he liquidated all his spoils, he’d barely afford a few of this formation’s array flags.  

Spirit beasts, formations, pills, talismans, artifacts, abodes… Cultivation was a bottomless pit.  

“These are identity tokens for White Mountain City.” Qu Lian gently placed two jade tokens before them.  

Wang Chan and Ning Jingming exchanged glances, impressed. To secure city entry permits in just a month—Qu Lian’s connections were formidable.  

They picked up the tokens eagerly.  

Wang Chan examined his closely.  

The front bore his likeness and details, while the back displayed the White Mountain emblem, beneath which was an expiration date—stamped with the city’s unique forging method.  

“Three years from now?” Wang Chan frowned.  

That meant three more years in the wilderness.  

And it was only getting more chaotic.  

Ning Jingming checked his token, then looked questioningly at Qu Lian.  

“Aside from a Yin God family among the factions migrating from Blackwater City’s south, at least five other forces with Foundation Establishment experts have arrived—including the Wei family. White Mountain City’s undercurrents are no calmer than the wilderness.”  

“That’s precisely why entry is stricter now. Securing permits for three years later was no small feat.” Qu Lian’s smile remained serene as she set down her cup. “Besides, by then, the turmoil should have settled.”  

“What makes you say that?” Ning Jingming asked neutrally.  

“Rumor has it the Mist Cloud Sect will dispatch another group—including a Yin God Realm elder—to oversee the region in a year.”  

Hearing this, Wang Chan and Ning Jingming nodded thoughtfully before placing their tokens back on the table.  

The matter wasn’t concluded yet—they couldn’t take the tokens home just like that.  

“As a gesture of goodwill, you may keep them now.” Qu Lian offered generously.  

Surprised, the two exchanged glances, their regard for Qu Lian rising further. Without hesitation, they pocketed the tokens like treasured prizes.  

“Now, regarding the remaining compensation—how would you like to proceed?” Qu Lian sipped her tea, her eyes twinkling with amusement.
