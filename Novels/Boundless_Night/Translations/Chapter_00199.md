Night Without Borders - Chapter 199 How High Is Ancestral Mountain

The young man in azure robes fluttered in the arena, his dark hair streamed behind him. Wielding a long saber that flowed with five-colored mists and clouds, he was like an immortal taking flight, his speed astonishing.

Ling Yu’s heart pounded. Who, exactly, was the outer saint here? The opponent’s wide sleeves fluttered, yet he was incomparably dominant. That five-colored saber was too dazzling, arriving in the blink of an eye!

Crackling sounds filled the air as his entire body glowed with rune-infused crimson light. His Heavenly Light Energy surged, and Soul-Suppressing Thunders were unleashed instantly without restraint, desperately trying to block his opponent.

Around Qin Ming’s body, five-colored mists surged, accompanied by wondrous phenomena. This was Five Elements Spiritual Light, ceaselessly regenerating, like a five-colored galaxy revolving rapidly around him.

Each and every Soul-Suppressing Thunder was cut down by the Five Elements Spiritual Light.

Outside the arena, Qian Chuan, Cheng Rui, Tang Jun, and others were dazzled and awestruck. The Soul-Suppressing Thunders affected them greatly even from a distance, making their souls feel unstable, threatening to leave their bodies.

Yet, someone moved as if strolling through a garden, observing the clouds roll and unfurl, easily traversing the thunderous zone. Wherever he went, the Soul-Suppressing Thunders could not block his path!

Ling Yu moved as swiftly as lightning, continuously teleporting. However, his opponent appeared effortless and natural, like a banished immortal. As his robes billowed, he perfectly matched Ling Yu's rhythm.

The five-colored saber in Qin Ming’s hand, indistinct and shrouded in mist and clouds, nevertheless pierced into the Pure Yang Soul-Illuminating Mirror with an unstoppable force, letting out a sharp *chi* sound.

At that moment, even Xin Youdao’s heart pounded faster. This was truly too dangerous, and a cold sweat ran down his back for Ling Yu.

The five-colored saber pierced through the Pure Yang Soul-Illuminating Mirror, and directly behind it was Ling Yu’s forehead. It was a suffocating sight.

However, Qin Ming let out a soft ‘hmm?’. The five-colored saber had been blocked. This was the first time he had felt something amiss since he began fighting Ling Yu.

He shook it forcefully, and the Pure Yang Soul-Illuminating Mirror shattered into pieces.

Yet, behind the mirror, directly in front of Ling Yu’s forehead, was a brilliant spiritual light, extraordinarily dense. It was a special pure yang consciousness!

It had actually blocked the five-colored saber. Unlike the pure yang spiritual light from earlier, this one was far more concentrated, as if a fragment of the blazing sun had been captured and refined into consciousness.

This was a wisp of consciousness spiritual light personally refined by Tang Jin’s master for Ling Yu, unique and different, like the rising sun, intent on purifying the darkness.

It looked like a viscous golden liquid, incredibly dazzling, causing everyone outside the arena to show looks of shock, sensing its extraordinary nature.

“Hmm?!” The five-colored saber in Qin Ming’s hand slashed forward again. Although it slowly pierced in, it was also stuck, as if trapped in a swamp.

At the same time, dozens of golden threads flew out rapidly from this golden pure yang consciousness spiritual light, shooting towards Qin Ming’s body.

However, they were blocked by the five-colored spiritual light.

Five Elements Spiritual Light appeared on Qin Ming’s body, flowing like sword energy, yet also like saber qi, preventing anything from getting close.

However, these dozens of special pure yang consciousness spiritual lights were not aimed at his physical body, but rather to draw out his consciousness, to pull his soul forth.

A Grandmaster, a figure infinitely close to the Patriarch realm, personally helped a disciple refine this pure yang consciousness. It was indeed terrifying, astonishing everyone outside the arena.

“Hmm?” This time, it was Ling Yu who was astonished, because no matter how many times he tried, he couldn't draw it out!

This was a trump card of their lineage: using the purest pure yang consciousness spiritual light to fish for the opponent’s soul light, hoping to pull it out of their body.

“This…” Qian Chuan and Cheng Rui both retreated rapidly, deeply realizing the ‘gold content’ of the ‘Young Ancestor’ title. When the golden blazing sun shone towards them, their consciousness and soul light were actually swaying, like rootless duckweed!

It wasn't that Ling Yu wasn't strong enough, but simply that his opponent was even more abnormal.

Little Wu really wanted to say: *No one knows better than me how hard it is to pull out Big Brother Ming’s consciousness spiritual light!*

Back then, he had tried to bring Qin Ming’s consciousness into the strange small town multiple times. In the end, only by transforming the rainbow light within his body into a golden divine bridge was he able to painstakingly draw it out, along with his Heavenly Light Energy.

Qin Ming’s consciousness spiritual light was rooted in his flesh and blood, and had merged into one with his Heavenly Light Energy.

He deliberately opened up an area and retracted the five-colored mist. The golden threads continuously glowed, persistently pulling, yet still unable to shake him.

Ling Yu was shocked. The young man from Black and White Mountain allowed him to pull at his soul, yet he couldn’t extract it!

Behind him, Tang Jin, dressed in black, couldn't help but take two steps forward, wanting to see clearly. A look of shock appeared on her delicate, flawless face for the first time.

*How is this possible?* She found it hard to believe.

People on the Newborn Path were weak in the spiritual domain, and Ling Yu was in the Second Realm. His pure yang consciousness spiritual light was refined by his master. With such a peerless art, he couldn't fish out the opponent’s soul light? This was outrageous!

“Indeed, facing the strength of the Immortal Path with the weakness of the Newborn Path, and for even a sun-like consciousness spiritual light to find it difficult to invade – this is truly incredible!”

Even the two old men were astonished. Their snow-white long eyebrows trembled, and the sparse strands of hair on their heads once again fluttered.

Xin Youdao, Tang Jun, and others were all greatly shaken. For such senior figures to be surprised and praise someone in this manner, one could imagine how extraordinary it was.

In an instant, Ling Yu changed his target. His entire body’s Heavenly Light Energy surged, fusing with that golden pure yang consciousness, and then he began to fish for Qin Ming’s Heavenly Light.

He wanted to pull the rug out from under him, to suddenly extract it from his body.

However, he failed again, unable to move it!

He couldn't quite understand it. This was a trump card of their lineage, so why had it failed? The crucial point was that he was even one realm higher!

Qin Ming’s Heavenly Light Energy, divine wisdom, and consciousness spiritual light had fused, all rooted in his flesh and blood. No matter how one tried to fish for them, it would only amount to trying to lift his entire person; it was simply impossible to separate any single one of them.

With a *whoosh*, Qin Ming suddenly exerted force, pulling the five-colored saber out of the sun-like consciousness spiritual light. He lightly swung it, and all dozens of golden threads were severed.

Ling Yu swiftly retreated. His next move was extremely unconventional and unexpected.

He actually used that golden liquid-like pure yang consciousness spiritual light to fish for the Heavenly Light within his own body, and truly pulled it out.

In a flash, that mass of Heavenly Light took shape, continuously condensing, only three feet long, like a ruler for discipline, yet also like a brilliant divine whip. Wielded by his pure yang consciousness, it struck towards Qin Ming.

“Hiss, is this the secret art developed by Grandmasters—the God-Beating Whip?” Zhao Minghui was surprised; she had heard of this method.

Qian Chuan, Tang Jun, and others were all dumbfounded. *Could it actually be used like this?*

The condensed Heavenly Light Energy was like lightning. It could strike consciousness spiritual light and also harm the physical body. Its power was immense, feared by those on the Immortal Path, who called it the God-Beating Whip.

Ling Yu had practiced several wondrous arts, and the Heavenly Light Energy born within him was already astonishing, far surpassing his peers. Now, after condensing it, it was even more terrifying.

“It can be used like this? Indeed, there’s some profoundness to it,” Qin Ming said in surprise. He was very interested. That Grandmaster truly researched many unconventional methods.

The two old men secretly sighed. *A quasi-Patriarch cannot be fathomed.*

The dazzling whip shadow flew forth, even more astonishing than lightning.

Qin Ming met it with his saber. Immediately, clanging sounds filled the air, and divine light scattered everywhere. Brilliant light burst forth, wave after wave, as if two immortal artifacts were colliding.

Ling Yu’s heart was greatly shaken. This was condensed Heavenly Light Energy, fished out by pure yang consciousness. *Could it still not sweep away everything?*

*What level had his opponent’s Heavenly Light Energy reached?* He truly found it hard to believe; it felt like a dream!

Ling Yu was certain that even legendary energy arts, such as the Second Imperial Energy of the Six Imperials Ancestral Court, might not be able to block this peerless wondrous art—the God-Beating Whip.

Because this was a temporary grand burst of his entire body’s Heavenly Light Energy!

However, his opponent was simply that incredible, directly withstanding the God-Beating Whip with conventional Heavenly Light Energy, shaking the dazzling whip body until it hummed and trembled violently, on the verge of exploding.

Ling Yu seriously suspected that after cultivating such Heavenly Light Energy, his opponent could be comparable to the Three Imperials Embodied cultivators of the Six Imperials Ancestral Court, the Golden Body Nirvana cultivators of the Tathagata Sect, and the Heaven-Shaking cultivators of the Heaven-Propping Sect!

However, such a peak, in the Newborn stage, has been rarely reached in history, apart from the founders themselves.

*Was he witnessing ‘history’?*

Ling Yu refused to believe it and continuously wielded the God-Beating Whip. This was Heavenly Light condensed from his entire body; if not invincible, it was close to it. It should be able to break through all kinds of Heavenly Light Energy and consciousness spiritual light.

The most effective way to deal with the God-Beating Whip was to temporarily avoid its edge, because it simply couldn't last long.

However, his opponent, wielding a five-colored saber formed from Heavenly Light, wanted to sever his God-Beating Whip, hoping to shatter it. Qin Ming was unbelievably dominant, constantly counter-attacking him.

Ling Yu couldn't stand it. The dense Heavenly Light returned, instantly submerging into his flesh and blood, because he feared his entire Heavenly Light Energy being scattered!

This was merely a burst method for a short period. His true Heavenly Light Energy was far from reaching that level just now.

“It can actually break the God-Beating Whip, and it’s a never-before-seen Heavenly Light Energy. Could it be comparable to legends? No weaker than the Three Imperials Embodied cultivators, Golden Body Nirvana cultivators, or Heaven-Shaking cultivators,” even Master Wu couldn't help but speak.

Such an evaluation shocked the young people present. Even a prodigy of Xin Youdao’s level was dumbfounded.

Qian Chuan murmured, “I still… don’t understand.”

“This is just Big Brother’s normal performance, awesome!” Little Wu shouted. He knew how truly powerful Qin Ming was.

After all, this was someone who could enter a divine temple and walk out unharmed.

Ling Yu retreated, his expression complex. What had he experienced today? Was he about to witness history? A completely new Heavenly Light Energy, comparable to legendary energy arts.

*Is this what an Ancestral Master was like in their youth?* More than one person on the scene had this thought.

“Excellent! I knew it, the Newborn Path hasn’t reached its end yet. We would eventually await later path-breakers!” one old man said with immense emotion.

“Minghui, when are you going to call our daughter back from the Immortal Land?” another old man secretly transmitted.

Zhao Minghui: “…”

Tang Jin was lost in thought. Several peerless arts in a row couldn't do anything to the young man from Black and White Mountain. He had simply ‘devoured’ them. It was clear that his innate talent was far too extraordinary.

Ling Yu realized that even if he used the power of the Second Realm, he still couldn't overcome this ‘Ancestral Master Mountain’, not knowing how high it truly was!

He took a deep breath, deciding to make one last move. If he still couldn't shake his opponent, then he would have to concede.

Ling Yu’s entire body bloomed with four kinds of light, revealing faint and hazy wondrous phenomena.

Some methods could only be fully unleashed in the Outer Saint realm, just like his current state.

His four most proficient wondrous arts corresponded to the Four Symbols domain. Vague tiger shadows, crimson bird shadows, and other forms seemed to appear around him. If explained by the Five Elements, they corresponded to Wood, Fire, Metal, and Water.

Furthermore, outside his body, five-colored lightning also burst forth, connecting with the Four Symbols.

Ling Yu erupted with 120% of his power, unleashing the Four Symbols Fist. It carried a momentum that could shake heavens and earth, with four virtual shadows circling his body, accompanied by a grand explosion of five-colored lightning energy.

In addition, his golden consciousness spiritual light transformed into a Pure Yang Sword. It seemed to carry the might of heaven and earth, like a Golden Crow streaking across the sky, slashing towards his opponent. Advancing on two paths simultaneously, he used all his trump cards.

Clang, clang, clang!

The five-colored mist around Qin Ming transformed, instantly becoming a Five Elements Halo, radiating divine light. The halo enveloped him, spinning rapidly.

At the same time, Earth energy surged, crimson blazing fire shot up, water mist churned, and wind and thunder raged.

He used several wondrous arts to manifest the momentum of heavenly thunder drawing forth earthly fire.

With the Five Elements Halo protecting his body and holding the five-colored saber, Qin Ming charged forward with a momentum that could sweep through all things. Wielding heaven and earth’s thunder and fire, he fiercely battled his opponent.

In an instant, Four Symbols Fist light, five-colored saber light, Pure Yang Sword light, Five Elements Halo… continuously collided in a grand fashion. The two figures moved at high speed like phantoms in the night mist, yet also like entangled lightning, constantly teleporting.

Boom!

Finally, the Four Symbols exploded, the five-colored lightning dispersed, and Ling Yu’s body was sent flying. After landing, he coughed up mouthfuls of blood, staggering and on the verge of collapsing.

In the arena, water vapor and blazing fire steamed, Earth energy flowed, and a vibrant mist rose, like colorful clouds swirling. Within the five-colored halo, Qin Ming’s dark hair danced, his azure robes flapped, and he stood with his saber sheathed.

“I’ve lost,” Ling Yu sighed forlornly. In the end, he could not overcome this mountain.

Outside the arena, Qian Chuan and Tang Jun both felt dizzy. The prominent figure actually lost just like that. Someone truly could transcend realms and defeat a Young Ancestor!

“Gak…” Master Wu let out a choked sound, then fell silent.

Tang Jin was lost in thought. This result truly exceeded her expectations!

At this moment, she felt that Flying Immortal Mountain had developed cracks.

One old man looked at the young man standing tall in the arena and said with absolute certainty, “Protect him!”

Another old man was even more direct: “The Cui family can scram! At least don’t cause trouble in the Kunling territory, or if they dare to reach out, we’ll break their claws!”

“Miss Tang… please!” Qin Ming said.
