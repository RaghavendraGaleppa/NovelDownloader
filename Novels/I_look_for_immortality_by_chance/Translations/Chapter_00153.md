# Chapter 152: The Statue of the Dharma Master!

About three hundred li from Thunderwood Island, on a serpent-shaped isle, a lizard-tailed earth demon with a snake's head lounged lazily on a boulder, basking in the sun. Minor demons diligently served it fresh venison, fish, and shrimp, creating a scene of utter contentment.

Suddenly, a streak of golden light streaked across the sky, landing just beyond the island.

The earth demon's eyes narrowed warily as it studied the approaching figure.

"Pardon the intrusion. I am Su Huazheng, Island Master of Thunderwood Island. I'm on my way to the White Flame Market and happened to pass by. I hope you'll forgive my unannounced visit."

The figure within the light was a handsome, upright young man who clasped his hands in greeting, speaking politely to the demon.

"If you're going to the market, just go. It's barely a thousand li away. What business do you have here?" the demon growled.

"I didn't mean to disturb you, but I find myself short on funds. I came to borrow some spirit stones and treasures for my journey," the young man replied with a faint smile.

"Borrow spirit stones and treasures? For your journey?" 

The demon was momentarily stunned before erupting in fury. "You impudent human brat! Trying to rob your Grandpa Lizard-Snake while pretending to be all refined? If you want spirit stones and treasures, you'll have to prove you're worthy!"

With a roar, it lunged at the human.

...

A dozen breaths later, the lizard-snake watched the retreating streak of light with a mix of fear and lingering terror. Its once-prized scales were now riddled with sword marks, one of which had nearly pierced through to its belly.

"Damn it all! When did another powerful figure move into the area? And right next to me! Is that white worm dead or what?" 

Though it cursed angrily, its eyes betrayed deep unease.

"Someone! Gather all the spirit fruits and ores on the island immediately! Grandpa's moving out!"

...

...

A day later, Gu Yuan weighed three bulging storage pouches in his hand and smiled faintly.

"This should be enough for the market trip..."

Though he had lost the protection of the Dao Academy after teleporting to the Ten Thousand Islands Sea, many things could now be done without restraint.

This was a lawless region, a paradise for rogue cultivators and demons. Unlike the Southern Mountain Domain, where major sects and demon kings maintained strict order, acting recklessly here was entirely possible. 

For instance, in the Scarlet Moon Great Marsh, countless earth demons and minor demons roamed, yet few cultivators dared to venture deep and act with impunity.

But the Ten Thousand Islands Sea was different. Most of these earth demons had no powerful backers—they relied solely on their bloodline talents to cultivate independently. It was common for islands to change hands every so often.

Gu Yuan had spent these days scouting the surrounding waters. His actions today had long been part of his plan.

Having left the Dao Academy and lost access to its resources, he had no choice but to "borrow" from his neighbors.

He felt no guilt plundering demons. The only regret was that he hadn't encountered any rogue cultivators during this time—otherwise, things might have been easier.

With a slight sigh, he stowed the pouches and soared toward the White Flame Market.

...

...

The White Flame Market, also known as White Flame City, was founded centuries ago by an exceptionally formidable alchemist who had mastered the rare White Flame True Fire. It was located on Flying Fox Island, a third-tier spirit island.

Dozens of smaller islands dotted the surrounding waters, teeming with mortals and Qi Refinement cultivators. This was the most populous region in the Ten Thousand Islands Sea.

Thanks to its dense population and strategic location at the heart of the archipelago, the market had grown into the largest trading hub in the region. Every day, countless rogue cultivators and demons gathered here to barter and exchange resources.

From time to time, grand events like spell conventions, alchemy gatherings, and auctions were held, making the place perpetually lively.

As soon as Gu Yuan arrived, he saw countless streaks of light coming and going. A vast formation enveloped the entire island, its radiance blotting out the sky. Within the formation, white-robed cultivators wielding enchanted swords patrolled diligently.

On the island itself, a majestic city sprawled across the mountainside. Atop its walls stood a towering watchtower, from which an overwhelming presence emanated—a guardian force ensuring order.

Though nominally just a market, White Flame City had long evolved into a formidable power in the Ten Thousand Islands Sea.

The island was protected by the third-tier formation, the "Azure Sea Blazing Sky Array," capable of resisting even Golden Core cultivators to some extent.

The market employed three late-stage Foundation Establishment experts as enforcers, along with a well-trained disciplinary squad, making it one of the most secure locations in the region.

While outer islands changed hands every decade or so, White Flame City had remained stable for six centuries.

"Esteemed senior, is this your first visit to White Flame City? I am Xiang Di, a guide here, specializing in assisting Foundation Establishment seniors. If you have any needs, I'd be happy to introduce the city to you."

Just as Gu Yuan landed outside the formation, a young man at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement approached respectfully on a magical tool. His robes were pure white, with a flame emblem on the sleeves.

Given the constant influx of rogue cultivators and demons into the Ten Thousand Islands Sea—and the high turnover due to fierce competition—White Flame City maintained a team of guides to help newcomers. 

Of course, only Foundation Establishment cultivators and earth demons or higher received this courtesy. Qi Refinement cultivators either paid for the service or figured things out themselves.

"Lead the way," Gu Yuan said, waving his sleeve. He didn’t refuse the offer.

Though he had gathered some information about White Flame City from the Flying Fish Market, he had never actually been here. A guide would save him a lot of trouble.

"Right this way, senior!"

The young man produced a token, opening a passage through the formation before escorting Gu Yuan into the city.

"Senior should know that White Flame City is vast and meticulously organized. It’s divided into six specialized districts: Spells, Alchemy, Artifacts, Formations, Beast Taming, and Miscellaneous. Each has its own treasures."

"You’ve come at an auspicious time, senior. Today happens to be the biannual 'Minor Myriad Convention,' where all six districts hold auctions. Though not as grand as the triennial Myriad Convention, it’s still guaranteed not to disappoint."

The guide handed Gu Yuan a catalog as he spoke.

Gu Yuan remained noncommittal. His visit today was no coincidence—he had timed it precisely.

Of the materials needed for cultivating the Six Ren Alchemical Gold Manual, demon cores were the rarest. The rest were merely supplementary. The Minor Myriad Convention should suffice for his needs.

As he flipped through the catalog, his eyes paused in surprise.

On the "Spells" section, a one-foot-tall statue shimmered brilliantly in the illustration, radiating a faint glow.

Beneath it was a line of small text:

**"Statue of the Dharma Master!"**
