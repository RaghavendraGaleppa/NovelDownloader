**Chapter 164: Gluttonous Feast**

"Who's ringing that bell?" Even from afar, Qin Ming heard the bell tolling in the dead of night, like a rumble in his heart.

He gazed into the distance, where violet light surged at the edge of the sky, accompanied by other expanding halos, each as terrifying as the earlier blue light that had torn through the clouds.

He whispered, "Old Rags, hurry and absorb the divine essence from the pool! We can't stay here much longer!"

Qin Ming looked up and saw a large black rat emerge from the end of a street cloaked in dense fog, followed by a horde of yin spirits, charging rapidly and menacingly.

Far outside the Divine City, Li Qingyun was practically "gazing until his eyes were worn out," watching a group of minor demons enter the city. He wrung his hands, sighed, and then glared fiercely at a few old men.

"You guys are utterly shameless!" he fumed.

He had been fortunate enough to encounter the "Divine City" descending here, only for several sly old men to appear simultaneously and prevent him from bringing Qin Ming into the city.

The old fogies told him it wasn't their turn yet; first came the "young ones," then the middle-aged generation, and finally them.

In an instant, Li Qingyun understood. These old guys came from different orthodoxies, and all were equally shameless, having quietly sneaked over. They had anticipated that the Divine City might appear in this region and intended to violate the rules, secretly entering the city. However, they discovered each other, which was awkward. None trusted the others, fearing someone might report them, so they ended up restraining each other and, ironically, adhering to the rules together.

Li Qingyun had just crashed his bird when they spotted him.

The old men thought, *This old rascal is too reckless! To save time, he actually dared to traverse the night sky during the God-Blocking War. We must stop him!*

Thus, Li Qingyun was filled with resentment, drooling over the Divine City but unable to approach.

The old men, however, paid no mind to the boy unconscious on the ground at the time. They merely escorted Li Qingyun away, naturally taking his mount with them as well.

"You are truly shameless! Two of you are even old acquaintances of mine! Who are you trying to fool with those masks?!" Li Qingyun, a person who walked two paths and had extensive connections, pointed at two of the old men.

Inside the Divine City, by the blue fire spring, the ground around Qin Ming was littered with debris: black rat fur, silver fox tails...

Currently, of the "Five Immortals" of folklore, besides the great snake, he had killed many of the other four types.

"You really lack discernment. It would have been better if we all just got along. Did you think being numerous would allow you to kill me...?" Qin Ming muttered to himself, clutching his mutton-fat jade iron blade.

Despite his words, he was serious and vigilant. Even with the jade iron blade, which countered yin spirits, he dared not be careless in the slightest.

Because more and more yin spirits were entering the city, shadowy and indistinct, the commotion caused by the Divine City was shaking the entire region.

After his "achievements" on the ground accumulated sufficiently, almost no other strange beings dared to provoke him, and they temporarily coexisted peacefully.

"Why is this divine essence not as effective as I imagined? Strange!" a black tiger yin spirit spoke, coming from the distant mountains.

It wasn't that their physical bodies couldn't enter, but rather that their yin spirits could depart their bodies faster, traverse the night sky, and arrive here immediately to seize the divine fortune.

Qin Ming also played along, blending in with them. He placed his bow and blade into the fire spring for nourishment, and even discreetly put his pendant in.

The most noticeable improvement was on the precious bow he had obtained from the silver-white giant hedgehog in the Divine Desolation Plains; it now gleamed brilliantly, flowing with a hazy silver light.

The mutton-fat jade iron blade and jade iron arrows had some effect, but not very significant. When Meng Xinghai refined them for Qin Ming, he had carved some runes using Esoteric Sect techniques, but he wasn't a professional, and Qin Ming hadn't tempered them himself on a daily basis.

As for the snowy-white sword-shaped pendant, it showed no reaction at all. This was because Meng Xinghai couldn't even inscribe runes on it; the material of this strange metal was too unique.

Several giant birds appeared on the horizon, traversing the sky and heading straight for the Divine City.

Qin Ming's pupils contracted. He saw familiar faces. The first to catch his eye was Li Qingxu, standing on the back of the leading giant bird, holding a shimmering purple bamboo staff.

Since his master, Cao Qianqiu, was acting on behalf of the Otherworldly Pure Land, Li Qingxu was naturally brought along to seize this significant opportunity. He even intended to use this place to become an "Immortal Seed" like Cui Chonghe and Li Qingyue.

"Wang Caiwei, Zheng Maoze, Zeng Yuan, Lu Zhenyi..." Qin Ming saw several acquaintances. He wondered if Li Qingyue would also appear.

Time was pressing, and he sighed inwardly, knowing he couldn't grasp all the benefits.

However, he glanced at the fire spring pool. The rich blue color had faded considerably; at least sixty percent of its divine essence was gone.

He felt he shouldn't be too greedy and ought to stop now. From here on, he would simply watch the storm unfold; he had already secured the lion's share of the benefits.

Then, to his astonishment, Qin Ming discovered that the area was indeed in turmoil. Dense black fog billowed, almost obscuring all the buildings.

He sensed it: it was that tattered cloth again!

Qin Ming immediately realized it had changed once more.

"What's happening? Why is it getting foggy?"

"Could it be... the divine being isn't dead and is enraged, blaming us?!"

Some yin spirits were terrified, their conscious radiance trembling.

Qin Ming took the opportunity to retrieve the tattered cloth. Once removed from the fire spring, it returned to its dull, unremarkable appearance, but unlike its previous lifeless state, it was now "subdued."

It had indeed changed a bit, becoming two palm-sized pieces. The incomplete golden sun within it was now more exposed.

Moreover, on the opposite side, a black fog region appeared at its edge, seemingly capable of shrouding the sky and sun. It was the expansion of this pattern woven from black strange metal that had caused the dense black fog to rise here.

Qin Ming carefully tucked it close to his body, quite satisfied. This was truly an unexpected surprise!

The material of this cloth was no weaker than the Eight Trigrams Furnace, which was a quasi-immortal item. Its origin was truly intriguing.

He couldn't test it now, but he imagined it must possess wondrous uses.

Qin Ming believed that when the tattered cloth was lifeless, the young man who could transform into mist likely didn't know its true nature and hadn't unearthed its proper value.

It was just unclear whether this tattered cloth was brought out by that young man from the Otherworldly Yang Land or found in the underground great rift valley of Black and White Mountain.

After all, that young man had spent several days messing around underground in Black and White Mountain and had even set up an altar.

Qin Ming lowered his head and saw that the fire spring's color had faded further, though it wasn't entirely clear soup; blue light still flowed within it.

He quietly left the area and entered a building, wrapping his bow and long blade, and slinging them over his back, not planning to use them for the time being.

His joints popped and cracked as he adjusted his appearance, making it different from before.

Such a change was enough to fool a group of young disciples.

Li Qingxu and others quickly entered the city, driving out the unruly strange beings and directly killing any who dared to resist.

"Tang Xumi, Hu Tingwen, you've really come too! You still owe me a Divine Ape Art manual!" Qin Ming did not approach them, but rather moved closer to another group of people.

Among the Esoteric Sect members, he found Yu Zhuohan, who was Zhuoya's cousin and with whom he had once fought outside Scarlet Cloud City—a case of "no discord, no concord."

"Old Yu!" Qin Ming greeted him.

Yu Zhuohan had a high recognition factor: a strong, powerful physique, with every strand of his shoulder-length silver hair gleaming like crystal, and very chiseled facial features.

"Old Yu?!" Yu Zhuohan noticed someone waving at him and calling him that. He immediately strode over, wanting to slap the kid.

How old was he? Not even seventeen!

"Brother, it's me," Qin Ming quickly sent a secret voice transmission, wanting to join their team.

Overall, he wanted to "blend with the light and dust," not drawing attention.

From now on, no matter what dragon-and-tiger struggle or bloody storm ensued, he could watch with detachment.

"How is it you?" After a brief secret exchange, Yu Zhuohan was slightly surprised.

Soon, Qin Ming learned the "truth."

Various factions were hunting a creature, interrupting its path to godhood.

This Divine City and the surrounding region were constructed by it using its essence, qi, and spirit. It was originally meant to merge with the true Scarlet Cloud City, but it had been ambushed.

At that moment, the heavens and earth suddenly trembled violently, and the distant sky was scorched blue.

A wounded creature, its conscious radiance blazing, tore through the clouds with a roar, charging towards them from the edge of the sky.

Instantly, a blazing sun appeared, blocking its path. Within it was a six-tusked elder elephant, which swung its trunk, shattering the clouds and swatting the creature back.

Qin Ming was shocked. What kind of power was this? Shaking heaven and earth!

Even a strange creature with the potential to become a god could not compare in strength to that elder elephant.

That elder elephant definitely didn't have false tusks. Moreover, it actually had a pair of dragon horns on its head, indicating it was likely a six-tusked dragon elephant.

When Qin Ming learned from Yu Zhuohan that among the "four suns" traversing the sky in the divine creature hunting party, one of them was none other than Li Qingxu's master, Cao Qianqiu, he became even quieter.

This old fellow was overly protective of his own and often disregarded his status to intervene, even causing Peerless Overlords to die tragically at his hands.

"If you stay with us, and we need to act, will you use the techniques of the New Life Path?" Yu Zhuohan secretly asked.

"I also know a bit about the Esoteric Sect's techniques," Qin Ming said, instantly conjuring a mist of water, then unleashing Wind-Thunder Qi, with lightning crackling nearby.

"You... when did you learn that?" Yu Zhuohan was dumbfounded. A young disciple like him truly couldn't discern what path this was.

"Oh, that venerable elder is here too," Qin Ming noticed. In one of the blazing suns in the distant sky was a tall elder, none other than Meng Xinghai's martial grand-uncle, who had been fishing alone in the abyss for a hundred years. This put Qin Ming's mind at ease considerably.

"You know that elder?" Yu Zhuohan asked.

"Yes, he's the one who taught me how to improve my divine wisdom," Qin Ming said, which wasn't entirely a lie.

Yu Zhuohan told him that many of the Esoteric Sect disciples who came this time were from the orthodoxy to which that old senior belonged.

In the front, a conflict erupted among the young disciples; they had already started fighting.

Qin Ming witnessed for the first time a clash between the Esoteric Sect and the Otherworldly lands. The battle was quite dazzling and spectacular.

Soon after, the strange beings also surged forward.

Qin Ming not only spotted the Violet Lightning Beast but also saw the oriole from Black and White Mountain that constantly clamored to follow him. That fellow was incredibly cunning, having joined the ranks of the strange beings, and it was quite eloquent, blending in remarkably well!

Even the Violet Lightning Beast's personal oriole and mynah birds looked up to it.

A deafening elephant trumpet sounded, and the four-tusked white elephant from the strange beings' ranks also joined the fray, seeking to seize the divine power from the fire spring pool.

A chaotic battle erupted here!

In the distant night sky, "five suns" traversed the heavens, too blinding to look at directly. One of these blazing suns was a giant centipede.

Earlier, it was this creature that had approached the threshold of godhood, tearing the night veil from the ground and scattering the clouds across the sky.

Yet, a creature as strong as this, considered a "great existence" in the eyes of the scarecrow and the great snake, had also become prey for others and had been severely wounded.

It was not currently in its flesh-and-blood state but was a divine form condensed from conscious radiance, like a blazing sun itself, incredibly dazzling, illuminating both heaven and earth.

"You have no small amount of courage, trying to 'subdue' this mountain and river region of Scarlet Cloud City. You must have heard the legends of god-like beings appearing here during the Great Wilderness Era, haven't you?"

From within a blinding sun, a bald old man spoke. He was precisely Meng Xinghai's martial grand-uncle, tall and ruddy-faced.

"The enmity of obstructing my Dao is irreconcilable!" the centipede roared. It had completely lost contact with the Divine City, and the dazzling blue light on its body burned fiercely.

From within a silver blazing sun, a woman's cool voice resonated, saying, "If we didn't obstruct you, would we let you swallow Scarlet Cloud City and all the surrounding villages and towns?"

"When one creature falls, everyone else can eat their fill, hahaha..." From within a fiery red sun, an old man with white hair and beard laughed boisterously, immensely powerful and domineering. In his hand, he held a bell wreathed in purple qi.

He was Li Qingxu's master—Cao Qianqiu, a famous formidable figure from the Otherworldly Pure Land!

With a gentle shake, the purple bell instantly emitted a colossal sound, more terrifying than thunder, reverberating across heaven and earth. The bell waves carried frightening patterns, like immortal swords sweeping across the night sky.

"Ah..."

The giant centipede's body vibrated loudly, as if forged from blue "strange metal," solid and indestructible. It actually withstood the sweeping bell waves.

However, it was still wounded. In the blue blazing sun, cracks appeared on its hundred-legged body, and dazzling blue "divine blood" flowed out.

Undoubtedly, apart from the weapons, the five blazing suns in the sky were all forms manifested from conscious radiance.

"Cao Qianqiu, I'll turn you into Cao 'Half-Autumn'!" the centipede hissed chillingly, emitting a vast mist of light that instantly awed heaven and earth. All living beings in the realm below trembled, wanting to prostrate themselves.

It traversed the night sky like a blue bolt of lightning, causing all clouds to explode!

Cao Qianqiu laughed loudly. Though a white-haired elder, he was arrogant and incomparably domineering, directly tossing out the weapon in his hand.

In an instant, the bell, radiating brilliant purple light, dispelled the boundless night fog, piercing the firmament. Moreover, it continuously expanded, its grand and prolonged ringing capable of suppressing the sound of thunder as it hurtled towards the divine creature.

Simultaneously, the other three blazing suns surged forth, jointly suppressing the blue giant centipede.
