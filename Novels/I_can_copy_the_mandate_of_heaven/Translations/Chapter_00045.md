# Chapter 45

Li Zhiming strolled through the tranquil Medicine Valley, umbrella in hand, inspecting the fields. The continuous drizzle had him worried that the medicinal herbs might rot, but to his relief, the soil had absorbed most of the rainwater.

"It would be wise to dig a drainage canal to prevent flooding during heavy rainstorms," he thought, chuckling at how his mindset had shifted to resemble his father's. As a young apprentice, he never had to concern himself with such matters, but now, as the master of the Medicine Valley, he felt responsible for its upkeep.

With his mentor's passing, Li Zhiming had gained a new status within the Seven Mystic Gate sect. He decided it was time to write to his family, informing them of his new position and the improved financial situation. His monthly stipend of thirty taels of silver would ensure his family's well-being and provide for their future.

As he exited the valley, Li Zhiming was surprised to see a group of workers busily constructing houses, fencing, and pigpens. A sturdy, dark-skinned foreman approached him, bowing and kneeling to show respect.

"We're here to build accommodations for the team that will protect you, Young Master Li, around the clock," the foreman explained, awaiting Li Zhiming's feedback.

Li Zhiming nodded, "Carry on with your work," before returning to his quarters.

The next day, several sets of well-tailored clothes arrived, courtesy of the sect's seamstresses. Li Zhiming changed into one of the outfits, a long, azure robe, and felt a transformation in his demeanor, embodying the spirit of his late mentor, Mo.

Soon, a visitor arrived - Yang Jingxian, also known as Yang Fragrant Master, the one who had brought Li Zhiming to the sect. Yang entered, dripping with rain, and greeted Li Zhiming with a deep bow.

"Yang Fragrant Master, please come in," Li Zhiming said, as Yang took a seat, chatting about various topics while avoiding any mention of Li Zhiming's past.

The conversation turned to Li Zhiming's living arrangements and his adjustment to life in the Medicine Valley. Li Zhiming shared his feelings of loneliness since his mentor's passing.

Yang Jingxian nodded sympathetically, sharing news about his own experiences and the sect's conflicts with the Sea Sand Gang. The gang controlled the local transportation and smuggling operations, boasting a massive population and a significant number of fighters.

The tension between the Seven Mystic Gate sect and the Sea Sand Gang had escalated when the sect discovered a lucrative copper mine. The gang's surprise attack on the mine's guards sparked a brutal conflict, resulting in heavy losses on both sides.

Yang Jingxian mentioned that the Sea Sand Gang had been rebuilding its strength, and Li Zhiming realized that his presence in the sect was, in part, a consequence of the gang's actions.

"They're recovering well, and I fear they might become restless again," Yang said, his expression a mix of concern and resignation.
