# Chapter 32: Immortal Sect Conspiracy, Ambush on the Road  

Xingqi Prefecture, Wanlin County.  

Elder Shi was in a wretched state, drenched in blood. A gruesome wound ran from his shoulder down to his ribs, flesh torn open, a horrifying sight.  

"Pavilion Master, the Guardian's power is unfathomable. A single strike from him could slay immortals and butcher gods!"  

"Then why aren't you dead yet?"  

Pavilion Master Yan glanced at him coldly. "Since when have you surpassed gods and immortals?"  

Elder Shi paused, then rolled his eyes back, collapsing onto the ground, limbs twitching, his breath faint as a thread.  

Pavilion Master Yan looked at him and said, "You truly are useless."  

With that, Pavilion Master Yan reached into his robe, took out a contract, and tore it to shreds. He turned his gaze toward the direction of Guigu Lingguan and spoke calmly, "The Sect Master has sent word. You are being given a chance to redeem yourself."  

Elder Shi quietly opened his eyes, then quickly shut them again.  

Pavilion Master Yan clasped his hands behind his back and walked toward the street, his voice echoing through the medicine shop.  

"Guigu Lingguan was once one of the helmsmen of the Golden Ship of Salvation, serving as its physician."  

"Now that he has left the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, he will inevitably return to the Golden Ship."  

"Thus, the Sect Master only ordered me to delay him slightly before letting him go."  

"Among us, you are the most skilled in movement and tracking. Follow his trail and locate the foundation of the Golden Ship of Salvation..."  

"Upon success, the Sect Master has promised you three years of control over the 'Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed'!"  

"You are old, and your path of cultivation is nearly hopeless. This is your only chance to attain enlightenment. Seize it well."  

By the time his voice faded, Pavilion Master Yan had already vanished.  

Elder Shi lay on the ground, his eyes flickering with uncertainty. After a moment, he gritted his teeth, flipped to his feet, and chased after Guigu Lingguan's departing figure.

Meanwhile, on the return journey, Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page to confirm there was no danger before removing the ghost-faced mask.  

He hung the longsword at his waist, slapped on a Swift Movement Talisman, then grabbed the Five Elements Creation Tree's clay pot in one hand and the green-horned wall-clinging bird in the other.  

He raced back toward the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's mountain gate, kicking up clouds of dust in his wake. The billowing earth trailed behind him like a yellow dragon in motion!  

"Why the rush to return, Master?" the wall-clinging bird couldn't help but ask. "We finally left the mountain—shouldn't we visit the Dark Flower Alley?"  

"You're a bird. What business do you have in such a place?" Li Zhengjing scolded. "The sect's mountain is a place of purity, brimming with spiritual energy, where cultivation is twice as effective! Now that the demon in Wanlin County has been dealt with, we must return to report!"  

Though he said this, a sliver of worry lingered in his heart.  

He had already subdued the demon in Wanlin County days ago but hadn't returned to the sect. If he were to stand out in the future, would someone connect him to the "Guardian"?  

Such a possibility needed to be nipped in the bud!  

With this thought, he pressed onward.  

Ahead, the mountain path narrowed, flanked by sparse trees and earthen mounds.  

Suddenly—BOOM!  

A thunderous crash echoed as boulders tumbled down from both sides of the path!  

His expression darkened. Unable to stop in time, he channeled his inner energy into his legs and leaped forward with all his might.  

The deafening roar of collapsing rocks filled the air behind him—a dozen massive stones now blocked the path.  

Had he been any slower, he would have been crushed to paste!  

"Who dares ambush me here?"  

Li Zhengjing's killing intent flared as he drew his blade.  

At that moment, two figures emerged from either side of the path.  

"We've waited three to five days for you, nearly losing patience."  

The speaker wore white robes and a silver token at his waist, his face twisted in a cold smirk. "Originally, Junior Brother Zhou and I had decided to give up if you didn't show today. But alas, your luck ran out—you came right to us."  

It was none other than Chen Bing!  

The other man was Zhou Mo.  

"Junior Brother Li, you earned merit in Wanlin County. You should have returned to the sect that day. Why linger until now?"  

Zhou Mo drew his sword, smiling. "But no matter. A few extra days of life won't change anything. Take a good look—the scenery here is quite nice. Burying you here should bring you peace."  

"So it's you two?" Li Zhengjing raised an eyebrow. "In Wanlin County, we competed for merit, and there were a few words exchanged. But that's hardly a deep grudge. Was it worth lying in wait for days?"  

"You were never worth my attention. But you had the gall to offend my elder cousin, Chen Yang."  

Chen Bing stepped forward, sword in hand, his voice icy. "I was already on my way to Bailing Prefecture to investigate the murder of that useless old man Chen Youyu when Senior Brother Chen Yang sent word, ordering me to intercept and kill you. I had no choice but to obey."  

"Didn't you see me cut down that black-robed demonic cultivator with one strike?" Li Zhengjing asked, puzzled. "What gave you the courage to ambush me?"  

"Trying to scare us?"  

Zhou Mo sneered. "That black-robed demonic cultivator already confessed—he was severely injured, missing an arm. Though his cultivation was at the seventh layer of inner energy, less than a tenth remained. You just got lucky!"  

Li Zhengjing fell silent.  

He remembered that before he had confronted the black-robed demonic cultivator, Chen Bing and Zhou Mo had interrogated him first.  

Had the demonic cultivator deliberately misled them, knowing there was tension between them?  

To that demonic cultivator, all three of them were his enemies.  

If conflict erupted, no matter who died, one of his foes would be gone.  

And if the sect later investigated, the truth of fellow disciples killing each other would come to light—ensuring all three perished!  

The demonic cultivator's scheme wasn't sophisticated, but if the worst came to pass, all three would die, avenging him.  

"These two idiots..."  

Li Zhengjing sighed inwardly and tightened his grip on the blade, stepping forward.  

"You're not running? You dare come at us?"  

Chen Bing raised his sword, grinning savagely. "You think cutting down a crippled, half-dead demonic cultivator makes you invincible among inner energy cultivators? Today, your senior brothers will teach you what true sect techniques look like!"  

Li Zhengjing's eyes gleamed with killing intent.  

Just then, the green-horned, golden-feathered wall-clinging bird flapped its wings and cried out, "Master, let me! Let me! I've never killed anyone before—leave one for me!"  

The ambush was over in three breaths.  

The wall-clinging bird sulked.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree tried to console it. "Don't be sad, Bird Lord. So what if you didn't get the kill? Your Blazing Fire still scorched their legs—better than nothing..."  

Then, waving its roots, the tree let out a sob. "Poor me, so innocent and kind, never harmed a soul in all my years. Yet people keep plucking my fruits, and some even hacked off half my body! Truly heartless, utterly inhuman!"  

A certain unnamed, upright individual tightened his grip on his sword, his murderous gaze sweeping over.  

"Master, don't misunderstand! I wasn't talking about you!"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree trembled, roots flailing. "You're virtuous and wise, a paragon of—AH! MY ARM!"  

A flash of the blade—two roots fell to the ground.  

"I've lost two more arms..." The tree whimpered, extending two new roots.  

"Those are clearly legs!" the wall-clinging bird corrected.  

"Does it matter? They're still severed!" the tree wailed.  

"They'll grow back. What's the big deal?" the bird said.  

"Unlike you, growing horns for fun—and dyeing them green, no less!"  

"Tree demon, I swear I'll never share the same sky with you!"  

The bird dove into the clay pot, burrowing into the soil and tying all the tree's roots into knots.  

The Five Elements Creation Tree howled in agony for a long while before its newly sprouted roots stiffened and then drooped limply, as if passing out.  

Li Zhengjing silently picked up the two severed roots, thinking they could brew two more batches of Five Elements Creation Paste. His anger subsided.  

After gathering the belongings of the two dead men, he buried them temporarily, planning to retrieve them later.  

Then he slapped on another Swift Movement Talisman and resumed his journey toward the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  

Upon reaching the foot of the mountain, he tore off the talisman and ignited it with a flame from his left arm, reducing it to ashes.  

"Why do that?" the wall-clinging bird poked its head out. "Swift Movement Talismans aren't easy to come by. What a waste!"  

"You'll see soon enough."  

Li Zhengjing ascended the mountain on foot, presenting his inner disciple token to the gatekeepers before returning to Guyue Peak.  

Before he could reach his residence, he was intercepted.  

"Enforcement Hall business!"  

The inner elder blocking his path was none other than Xie Changqing, whom he had met once before!  

Xie Changqing's expression was grave as he declared, "Li Zhengjing, you are suspected of murdering fellow disciples. Come with us!"
