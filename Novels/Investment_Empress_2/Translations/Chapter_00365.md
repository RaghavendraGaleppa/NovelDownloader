Chapter 365: The Moon in the Well Enters the Palm, The Old Ying Mansion

What does it feel like to be treated like a thief in your own home?

At the lunch table, Li Mo lowered his head and shoveled rice into his mouth, feeling that something was off with his parents. He had only been back for a few days; was the speed at which parental love vanished really this fast?

"Is it just my illusion?"

Li Mo remained calm, subtly moving his chair closer to the Ice Cube.

Hmm?

Old Li and his beloved wife, Gu Xueqin, twitched their eyelids, their gazes immediately becoming scrutinizing.

"???"

Little Li was completely baffled. He knew love could fade, but did it have to turn into looking at him like a thief?

What in the world was going on?

At that moment, however, Ying Bing habitually and naturally took a sip from his cup, bit her chopsticks, and picked up a piece of food for him.

It was a close call; those jade-like lips almost called him "stinky little brother" or "immature brat" out loud.

"Li Mo, eat."

Parents: "?"

"!!!"

Little Li executed a tactical retreat.

What was with his parents' look? It was as if small flames were burning inside their eyes. The pressure from their gaze was even stronger than the suppression from the Golden Crow Projection.

This, my friends, is called the suppression of bloodline.

So, Li Mo quickly finished his rice. He couldn't stay in this house any longer.

"Where are you going?"

"Just, going out for a stroll. Bing'er and I haven't been home for a long time; we want to look around."

"Go ahead, but be back before dinner."

Watching the backs of Li Mo and Ying Bing as they left together, the couple exchanged a glance, both seeing the seriousness in each other's eyes.

Little Bing'er drank tea from someone else's cup?

And used her own chopsticks to pick up food for him???

This is ninety-two percent suspicious!

Li Dalong looked solemn. "My intuition was right. These two little brats are different from when they came back last time."

"They grew up together since childhood; these things don't seem like a big deal."

Gu Xueqin couldn't adapt to the situation for a moment.

"Have you forgotten how they were when they went to the Qingyuan Sect together? They couldn't even say a full sentence to each other for half a day."

"Hmph, this stinky boy, even hiding things from his own mother."

"Tonight, let's go check his room. If he's not there, we'll have to go burn some incense at the old Ying Mansion."

......

On the other side.

Li Mo let out a breath of relief only after walking out of the street leading to the Li Mansion. He strolled along the street with Ying Bing.

Winter had set in. Even the sunlight felt devoid of warmth when it shone on them. However, the streets were bustling and noisy. There were many commoners pulling New Year's goods in carts and carriages; some were even beating gongs and drums, setting off firecrackers to welcome back relatives returning from afar.

The smell of the New Year was already in the air.

"Why does my birthday always coincide with the New Year?"

Li Mo thought about how his birthday always fell on the New Year every year.

It resulted in his family prioritizing the New Year, treating his birthday as secondary.

Ying Bing looked at the bustling street, unconsciously pursing her lips and lowering her eyes.

She actually didn't like the New Year.

"Then, when the time comes, I'll celebrate your birthday for you."

"!"

Little Li was stunned, looking at her blankly. Even though the surroundings were incredibly noisy, he felt as if it were completely quiet.

"Let's go." Ying Bing turned her face to the side.

And so, they strolled through Qinghe County, where they had grown up. They walked from the noise into silence, and gradually, there were fewer people around.

Li Mo glanced at the slightly swaying, slender hand. Suddenly, it seemed like the moon in a well, making one want to fish it out.

But the difference was that the moon in the well could not be fished out, while Bing'er's little hand could.

Wait.

Just as he reached down, the little hand moved to the other side and slipped away.

"Huh?"

Li Mo looked up and glanced at her flawless profile, but only saw a look as if nothing had happened.

Was it a coincidence?

Little Li tried to fish for the moon again, but every time he was just a tiny bit away, the little hand would slip away.

"?"

Li Mo took a deep breath.

He gathered his spirit, flexed his hand, and waited for the right opportunity...

But this time, before his hand even went down, the "moon in the well" delivered itself into his palm.

"?????"

"Immature brat."

Ying Bing felt the warmth in her palm, and the corners of her beautiful mouth curled up slightly, no longer suppressing her smile.

Li Mo was stunned, realizing he had been ambushed by the bad Ice Cube.

How could he tolerate this?

But the soft, warm touch made his hand develop a mind of its own.

How useless!

So, the two held hands and walked along the riverbank for a while longer. The buildings around them became noticeably sparser and much quieter, allowing the sound of the flowing river to be heard clearly.

"Li Mo? Ying... Miss Ying?"

"You two..."

A voice of surprise suddenly came from opposite them.

Li Mo looked up and saw a figure enter his vision.

"Fengzi? You've gotten a lot fatter."

Zou Yongfeng was a childhood playmate. They had climbed trees to steal bird eggs and thrown firecrackers into other people's water vats together. Although they had sold each other out later on, their relationship was still good.

But later, Li Mo was sent to a private school by his family, so they saw each other less.

Meeting again, Zou Yongfeng seemed somewhat awkward, standing up at a loss.

For example, if one day you suddenly heard that a childhood friend with whom you used to mix mud and pee suddenly became the richest man, and appeared before again in front of you, anyone would find it somewhat unreal and unfamiliar.

"Quick, call him Big Brother."

Zou Yongfeng pulled the woman next to him, who first called out "Big Brother."

She looked at Ying Bing and试探性地 asked:

"Sister-in-law?"

Li Mo felt the little hand in his palm curl up slightly. He smiled and greeted:

"Fengzi, you're quite something. Are you preparing to get married?"

"Get married? I got married at the beginning of the year. I'm about to be a dad soon."

"Ah?"

Li Mo noticed that Old Zou's wife seemed to have a slightly bulging belly...

Although Old Zou called him Big Brother, he was actually a year older than him.

In Li Mo's impression, Fengzi was still that brat with two streams of snot who was hated by everyone and their dogs along with him. But in the blink of an eye, he was almost a father.

It was just... so sudden.

"Why did you move here?" Li Mo remembered that Zou Yongfeng didn't used to live on West Street.

Zou Yongfeng hesitated for a moment and said:

"Mo-ge, are you and Sister-in-law planning to... go take a look at the old Ying Mansion?"

The hand in his palm suddenly clenched tightly.

Seeing the side of the Ice Cube's face turn a little pale, Li Mo understood.

Going further up West Street was the edge of Qinghe County.

It was also the location of the old Ying Mansion.

Many years ago, on the New Year's Eve of the same era, his father had left the house temporarily. From the ruins and the blood-soaked ground there, he had brought back the only survivor, Ying Bing.
