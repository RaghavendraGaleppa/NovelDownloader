Chapter 198: Skinning!

It was a very interesting turn of events. Zhou Tian had assumed that the Blood River and the Ancient City, both left behind by Wutian, must be aligned. However, judging by the current situation, it seemed that not only were the Blood River and the Ancient City not allies, they were likely fiercely antagonistic.

The engorged human skin surged with towering blood waves, surrounding the skeleton soldiers. The skeleton soldiers emitted a black light, resisting the erosion of the blood waves, thus reaching a stalemate. The Blood River in the sky still periodically sent down branching streams, entering the body of the human skin.

At this moment, from the northwest direction, a colossal, jet-black chain appeared horizontally across the sky, gleaming with a chilling radiance. Runes were inscribed upon it, and then it lashed down fiercely. Zhou Tian even felt a slight tremor—that was Huang Qi. With such an obvious signature divine ability, he didn't even need to guess.

Perhaps this anomaly siphoned off some energy from the Ancient City, disrupting the balance between the skeleton soldiers and the engorged human skin. The towering blood waves broke through the black light, seeping into the crevices of the skeleton soldiers' bones, severing their connection with the Ancient City. The engorged human skin then wrapped around the skeleton soldier's body and retreated back into the residence.

Zhou Tian could clearly see two deep blood-red glows emanating from the darkness—a pair of sinister and terrifying eyes! Immediately after, a gust of cold wind swept past. The two large doors, which had been knocked away, flew back from an unknown place, and then the ancient door slammed shut with a "clang!" From behind the blood-red door came a series of "crunching" sounds.

"He's gnawing on those bones?" Zhou Tian wore a strange expression. The odd sounds he had heard earlier were, in fact, the human skin gnawing on bones.

Zhou Tian stood rooted to the spot for a long time, looking up at the Blood River in the sky, seemingly lost in thought. Then, he changed direction and headed towards the source of the Blood River. He had changed his mind. Instead of searching for Huang Qi and Sacred Demon, he decided to first investigate the source of the Blood River. He had initially believed this place to be a unified demonic lair, full of traps everywhere, but it now seemed that the Blood River and the Ancient City were at loggerheads, which might make it less dangerous.

His figure flickered, and Zhou Tian's body vanished from his original position. He directly used [Teleport] to travel, though he kept the distance of each teleportation relatively short, fearing he might teleport into a dead end from which he couldn't even manage a second teleport, resulting in a huge loss. Many Yin Soldiers roamed the Ancient City. These Yin Soldiers were empowered by the city and would charge at any living person they saw, making them very difficult to deal with. Zhou Tian avoided entanglement, directly bypassing them. If the Yin Soldiers pursued relentlessly, he would lead them into a residence, letting the Blood River and the Ancient City fight it out.

Boom!

In one residence, a golden light soared into the sky. In the courtyard lay a tattered human skin, its entire body burning with golden flames. A figure suddenly appeared in the space before it, butt naked. It was Zhou Tian, who had just been killed by the human skin. The last time he self-detonated, he had lost his clothes. Although he now possessed cultivation and could open a personal spatial dimension, he hadn't found the time to study it. He had gotten addicted to using self-detonation, forgetting last time that it didn't count towards his death tally. This time, he hadn't forgotten; he had truly died when his heart was ripped out.

Having used up his revival count for the day, Zhou Tian chuckled, waving at the human skin, which had just summoned a pillar of blood before him. "Farewell then!" he said. He then instantly teleported away from the location.

Behind him, rumbling sounds echoed, and blood-red and black lights flickered. The human skin had rushed out but, failing to find Zhou Tian, instead engaged in a fierce battle with the wandering skeleton warriors. Zhou Tian smiled, paying them no mind. He closely monitored the time within his undying system because the revival count refresh time was fast approaching, which was why he had used up his remaining revival count for the day.

"Three, two, one..."

His revival count refreshed. Zhou Tian looked up and realized he was still within the Ancient City. "It seems the Ancient City and the Buddha Kingdom are indeed two different spaces," he mused. Given that it was time for the Buddha to appear, this location should have been the Buddha Kingdom by now. Their continued presence in the Ancient City proved that the Buddha Kingdom and the Yin City were not connected.

Zhou Tian continued forward, and it wasn't long before he arrived at a stone bridge. Ahead, the roaring sound of surging water could be heard, accompanied by a soaring baleful aura and a pungent scent of blood drifting through the air. Scarlet blood mist swirled, and a turbulent Blood River flowed forth.

The area ahead seemed to be the central part of the Ancient City, a vast central plaza. What drew attention was a glowing blood-colored substance floating in mid-air, from which the massive Blood River flowed out. The expansive plaza was incredibly open. Aside from the blood-colored substance in the center, the railings around the plaza were also peculiar; they were made of long, tombstone-like stone blocks.

Stepping over the stone bridge, Zhou Tian approached the central plaza. Many skeletons still roamed here, but the Blood River did not actively attack them. Unseen forces seemed to surge around the blood-colored substance. One skeleton warrior attempted to approach; initially, there was no danger, but just a few meters in, it suddenly dissolved into a puddle of bloody sludge on the plaza.

Zhou Tian walked towards the black long stones that resembled tombstones. The stone tablet railings seemed to record many ancient events, but they were too abstruse and difficult to understand. He couldn't comprehend them at all. Not a single carving on any tablet was intact, as if key parts had been deliberately erased.

He looked up at the substance glowing with blood-red radiance, wanting to see clearly what it was. The moment he focused his gaze, a vast, ocean-like fluctuation surged through the plaza. Although it wasn't a destructive aura, it carried an immense spiritual pressure, a fear originating from the very soul. It was like a weak ant submitting before the master of all things. That mighty pressure, that ancient and profound aura, truly shook one's soul!

The blood-colored luminous substance floating high in the sky instantly retracted all its divine light. However, in that fleeting moment, it manifested layer upon layer of spectral images. Zhou Tian's pupils suddenly constricted. In the depths of his eyes, he could see a blood-red bound book slowly opening. He felt his body was out of his control, his blood and qi surging. Without hesitation, he immediately used his [Teleport] skill, breaking free from the control and returning to the stone bridge. Yet, he still felt the strange change in his body. Blood began to seep from all over his body, and his body was expanding—more accurately, his skin was expanding, threatening to peel off his flesh.

"Human skin!" Zhou Tian suddenly understood where those human skins came from. Nine times out of ten, they were peeled off those skeleton warriors, just like what was happening to him now.
