# Chapter 4: Leopard Head

**Author: Yue Guan**

"Mr. Yang."

"Madam Tu."

"Mr. Yang, you are a smart man. You should understand that if this matter is exposed, the Yu family will be the first to want you dead."

"I... understand."

"That's good. Young Master Yu's death is something no one wanted to see. But the dead are gone, and our Miss Chanzhi is still a girl in the prime of her youth. If she were to waste her entire life away, how could this old woman bear it? I had no choice but to resort to this desperate measure..."

Madam Tu sighed, smoothing her brow to appear more amiable.

"Fortunately, this isn't a loss for you, Mr. Yang. Once our Miss has an heir, she will be able to stand firm in the Yu family. At that time, you will also reap immense benefits. Think about it—with the Young Mistress of the main Yu household secretly looking out for you, won't you be able to rise to prominence?"

Yang Can's face was a mask of anxiety and hesitation. "I understand, Mr. Yang. For me, this is indeed a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. However... if this is ever exposed, we are all dead for sure. With the Yu family's power, even if I fled to the ends of the earth, I'm afraid..."

Madam Tu smiled faintly and interrupted him. "Only I, Miss Suo, and her personal maid, Qing Mei, know that Young Master Yu and our Miss have not yet consummated their marriage. As long as the four of us keep our mouths shut, how could it possibly be exposed? As the saying goes, fortune favors the bold. Mr. Yang, you must seize this opportunity."

*Only the four of us know?* Yang Can felt a wave of relief.

Yang Can's reaction—a mix of desire and fear—was exactly what Madam Tu had anticipated.

She knew Yang Can would eventually yield after a little persuasion.

The temptation of a stunning beauty and the chance to leap through the dragon gate—who could resist such a thing?

Besides, Yang Can's only way out was death.

"Very good, Mr. Yang. You must be clear: your life and future depend entirely on whether Miss Chanzhi can establish herself in the Yu family. And whether she can establish herself depends on whether you can make her pregnant. So, starting tonight, you must come every evening."

"Huh? Every night?" Yang Can was greatly surprised by this.

He thought it was just a one-time thing last night. He even thought that once the matter was done, someone would come to kill him immediately.

So, filled with grief and despair... he had given it his all at the time, pedaling with all his might...

At that moment, he had only one thought: *If you leave me no path to survival, I will carve out a bloody path right here.*

But now, hearing Madam Tu's words, it seemed that before arriving at the Yu family, he would not be in any mortal danger...

"That's right. Miss Chanzhi must have a child! And your only chance is on the journey to Tianshui."

"Yes... I understand," Yang Can replied.

With this, he had much more time to find a way to break the situation. This was indeed good news.

Madam Tu was very satisfied that Yang Can agreed without much hesitation.

Yang Can was indeed the right choice.

A smart man is suitable for participating in her plan, because a smart man will weigh the pros and cons and know how to choose.

But this person couldn't be *too* smart, because a less smart man could be used by her and be tempted by the pie she drew.

Yang Can was clearly the ideal candidate in her heart. That's why when Miss Suo Chanzhi shyly chose Yang Can as the substitute groom, Madam Tu did not object.

After finishing her admonishment of Yang Can, Madam Tu walked away with peace of mind. She wasn't worried that Yang Can would confess this to the Suo family.

Yang Can stood in place for a while. After Madam Tu's warning, he felt even more that she was the mastermind behind the entire "borrowing seeds" plan. But what was her motive?

If Madam Tu was the leader, then the one unwilling to give up this marriage alliance probably wasn't the widow, Suo Chanzhi, but the Suo family itself?

However, the Suo family was clearly more powerful than the Yu family. Why did they go to such lengths to maintain this marriage alliance?

Yang Can had only been Yu Chengye's retainer for a little over half a year. He had just become familiar with and adapted to his new identity when he began preparing for the wedding of the two families.

The wedding of two great clans was no less grand than a peace marriage between two nations. Yang Can had been buried in rites and ceremonies all day and never had the chance to learn about other matters.

But now, he urgently needed to know more about the Suo and Yu families...

Suddenly, Yang Can's gaze fell upon an exceptionally tall figure among the crowd down the slope.

His eyes lit up immediately. Perhaps from that person's mouth, he could get the answers he wanted.

Thinking of this, Yang Can brushed the wrinkles on his round-collared robe and straightened his black folded scarf before walking down the slope.

The Yu family's wedding procession was camped at the bottom of the slope, while the area on the slope was the Suo family's domain. The two were clearly divided.

For the Suo family, this marriage was entirely a case of marrying down. Therefore, the Suo family members always felt a sense of superiority when facing the Yu family.

This arrogance and distance could also be seen in the layout of their camp.

As he went down the slope, Yang Can felt his thighs a bit sore. It seemed he was a bit tired from last night's three visits to the thatched cottage and the trekking over hills and waters.

Down in the camp, the Yu family members were making a fire to cook. Everyone's spirits were low, and the atmosphere was unusually heavy. In particular, "Leopard Head" Cheng Dakuan's expression was especially despondent.

Suddenly, Leopard Head saw Yang Can coming down the slope and his heart leaped with joy. He quickly stepped forward to meet him.

"Mr. Yang, you're back! Why did the Suo family people keep you for a whole night? Didn't they give you any trouble?"

The moment he saw Yang Can, Leopard Head couldn't wait to speak.

Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan was the captain of the guards for the Yu family's main household. He was a tall and imposing man with a wide nose and broad mouth, a pair of thick, heavy eyebrows, and a beard as messy as steel needles. His appearance and aura were strikingly similar to the Leopard Head Lei Bao played by Xu Jinjiang.

Coincidentally, his nickname was "Leopard Head."

Yang Can had personally witnessed this Leopard Head crush a pebble to pieces with just his thumb and index finger. What would be the result if such finger strength were used to lock a throat? Yang Can had also seen him leap over the backs of four horses standing side by side without a running start, as if taking off from dry land.

But such a master with unique skills and such a majestic, domineering appearance, at this moment facing Yang Can, was actually bending over and smiling fawningly, like a leopard with a face full of flattery.

Since Yu Chengye was assassinated, Leopard Head had been restless. He was the captain of the guards for the main household. How could he escape responsibility for the eldest young master's assassination?

But in fact, he was truly wronged. Because Young Master Yu was assassinated in the center of the camp, an area responsible by the Suo family, his own Yu family members couldn't even get close.

However,道理 is like this, but he was afraid the clan leader wouldn't reason with him.

Seeing that Yang Can had been invited by the Suo family for a whole night, Leopard Head couldn't help but overthink things. He worried that the Suo family was joining forces with Master Yang to shift the blame onto him, and his heart was naturally very tense.

Yang Can shook his head slightly. "Thank you for your concern, Captain Cheng. The Suo family people didn't make things difficult for me. The Young Mistress asked me to go over just to inquire about some follow-up matters regarding the Young Master."

Leopard Head widened his eyes and asked urgently, "Then why did you stay out all night, Mr. Yang? What matter was so time-consuming?"

Yang Can sighed. "The Young Mistress hadn't even officially entered the family, and the Young Master died. She is naturally heartbroken. I couldn't bear it seeing her like that, so I used all my skills and spent half the night trying to persuade her, which finally allowed her to come to terms with it a bit."

Leopard Head's heart pounded even faster upon hearing this.

If you said the Young Mistress cried her eyes out, I'd believe you!

But you say you persuaded her for half the night?

Bah! Are you trying to fool a ghost?

What is the Young Mistress's identity? Does she need a grown man like you to comfort her in the middle of the night?

If you're going to lie, at least make it believable! You're just trying to make me nervous!
