# Chapter 43: The Grand Opening

"How dare they charge ten spirit stones for such a shoddily made book?"

Zhou Tian's face was filled with displeasure as he looked at the book on the table. Although the calligraphy on it was elegant, it couldn't hide the fact that it was made of papyrus. While his family was wealthy, being rich and being a fat sheep were two different concepts!

"Reporting, Young Master," the servant beside him bowed and said, "this information was provided by the Wanderer organization, a subordinate of the Fool. Their spies are spread across the Nine Provinces, and their intelligence is highly reliable. It was then published by the Treasure Gathering Pavilion. You know those people are obsessed with money; after all, the value lies in the information, not the materials, so they cut costs wherever they can!"

"Alright, I understand..." Zhou Tian waved his hand. Due to the matter with the Imperial Advisor, the Fool had many disagreements with the Sky Qin Empire. While they wouldn't cause major troubles, they never hesitated to upset them with petty things. Thus, they chose not to cooperate with the Sky Qin Empire's official forces, but rather with the Treasure Gathering Pavilion.

The servant withdrew, and Zhou Tian opened the book. The very first page was titled [Dharma Idol Level], right at the top.

The person ranked first was not someone from the Imperial Capital, but a lone cultivator.

"Exiled Immortal: Peerless under the heavens, an immortal exiled through the ages! Name unknown, bone age verified 17. Undefeated since their first battle, countless divine abilities at their fingertips. Three Treasures divine abilities unknown. Suspected to be an ancient grand figure returning after transcending the heavens!"

"Interesting," Zhou Tian was slightly surprised. He hadn't expected such a person to be ranked first; he wouldn't have known about them if not for this book. He continued reading.

"Zhou Xunchuan, third son of the Qin Emperor, seventeen years old. Cultivates imperial secret arts. Dharma Idol forms with a dragon's roar spanning ten thousand li. Three Treasures realm divine abilities unknown."

Zhou Xunchuan was second, followed by the younger generation of the Imperial Capital: Zhou Zui, Gu Feng, Li Xuanyi, and others were all listed, except for Zhou Tian.

Besides these individuals, there were also other lone cultivators, most of whom had participated in a previous Youth Grand Competition. There were a total of 20 people. At the very end of the ranking, Zhou Tian saw a sentence that made him chuckle.

"The above rankings are not in any particular order!" If they're not in order, how can they be called rankings? Zhou Tian shook his head and flipped to the [Three Treasures Realm] section.

It began with a sentence: "Provisional ranking, subject to change at any time!" It seemed this ranking was indeed in order. This was the main event, after all, as most of the participants this time were in the Three Treasures Realm. The Dharma Idol realm cultivators mentioned earlier were for the elite competition, not directly related to them.

The first place was held by someone from the Southern Barbarian Tribes, at the peak of the Three Treasures realm, ready to break through to the Dharma Idol realm at any time. But this had nothing to do with Zhou Tian.

After flipping through several pages, Zhou Tian finally found Tian Ling's information, ranked 358th.

"Tian Ling, disciple of the Haotian Sect Master, fiancée of Zhou Tian, the Third Prince of Qin. Earth Treasure realm. Heavenly Treasure divine ability is an offensive one. Earth Treasure divine ability unknown."

"Alright, alright!" Zhou Tian nodded with a smile. The Fool was quite sensible, listing Tian Ling as his fiancée. He was very satisfied. The Wanderer's intelligence was indeed sharp; Tian Ling had only been out for a day after breaking through to the Earth Treasure realm before they captured her information. The rest was trivial. He had scanned the entire book and only found his name mentioned in Tian Ling's entry, but Zhou Tian had no complaints. After all, he was just a "mortal," wasn't he?

...This was just a small interlude, briefly passing Zhou Tian's idle time. Days passed, and soon it was time for the Imperial Capital segment of the Youth Grand Competition to begin.

As it was a quadrennial grand event for the entire province, the opening ceremony was quite grand.

Since he was idle anyway, Zhou Tian took Tian Ling, who had just emerged from seclusion, with him. Tian Ling had not broken through to the Human Treasure realm during this period; half a month wasn't enough for such a simple breakthrough.

Inside the carriage, Zhou Tian poured Dragon Heaven Tea into a glazed zisha cup, handed it to Tian Ling, and asked with a smile, "Ling'er, do you remember last time, when you drank too much?"

Tian Ling took the teacup and paused slightly. Her skin was crystal clear, a flush spread across her cheeks, and her eyes lowered. Her hand tightened around the cup as she lowered her head and took a sip of the golden tea, nodding.

"Then... can you tell me what happened back then?" Zhou Tian leaned closer to Tian Ling, inhaling her faint fragrance, and softly asked the girl who seemed to have stepped out of a painting.

"The specific things... I don't remember... I only remember that I drank too much..." Tian Ling was too shy to lift her head, her voice like a mosquito's buzz. Last time, it was all Sister Liu's fault for making her drink so much, which led to such a loss of composure. What happened afterward was simply something she couldn't have done. Just thinking about it made her blush, and she hadn't even cultivated well lately.

"Then let me help you remember~" Zhou Tian extended a finger and gently lifted Tian Ling's delicate chin. Her large, limpid eyes, long eyelashes, eyebrows like distant mountains, and skin as smooth as jade, flushed with crimson, and her shy, dodging gaze further ignited Zhou Tian's mischievous streak.

Tian Ling didn't know what was wrong with her. Zhou Tian's finger didn't exert much force, yet she involuntarily lifted her face with it. Zhou Tian was clearly just a mortal, and she could push him away with a light touch, but she simply couldn't muster any energy. Her two small hands intertwined tightly.

Her eyelashes trembled slightly. Tian Ling looked at Zhou Tian's half-smile and gently closed her eyes...

Zhou Tian watched Tian Ling close her eyes, a faint smile on his face. He leaned his face close to hers, leaving only a tiny gap, but he didn't kiss her.

Tian Ling waited for a long time but nothing came. Puzzled, she opened her eyes. The moment Tian Ling's eyes opened, Zhou Tian kissed her, his tongue swirling...

Their eyes met. Zhou Tian's eyes were full of playful mischief, while Tian Ling's were filled with astonishment, followed by helplessness. She truly had no way to deal with Zhou Tian's mischievousness...

The competition venue was located in the eastern part of the Imperial City, a place specifically set up for the Youth Grand Competition and usually not open to the public.

It was an edifice similar to a stadium from Zhou Tian's previous life, but magnified more than a hundredfold. Its exterior was entirely white, with over a hundred combat stages in the center. Each stage was inscribed with a space-expansion formation, making their interiors immensely vast, yet the external view could always focus on the two combatants, truly wondrous.

Nearby were circles upon circles of spectator stands, capable of accommodating hundreds of thousands of viewers. The second level comprised VIP seats, reserved for the prominent figures of the Imperial Capital.

When the carriage arrived, the two descended. Zhou Tian wore a lewd grin, while Tian Ling's face was still slightly flushed.

By the time they arrived, the competition venue was mostly full, with many more people still queuing outside, all looking excited, discussing something with those next to them, and occasionally bursting into laughter.

Fortunately, there was a dedicated VIP channel, so the two didn't have to queue to enter.
