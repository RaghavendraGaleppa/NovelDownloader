# Chapter 67: A Troublesome Matter

“Master, actually, you’re a bit late. I’ve been back for a few days.”

“You... you ate it?!”

Shang Wu was instantly stunned. Watching her beloved disciple nod with a look of melancholy, then clasping her hands behind her back and sighing at the sky, the Autumn Water Pavilion fell silent.

They looked at each other without a word.

The wind today suddenly feels rather noisy.

Seeing his beautiful Master covering her mouth, her almond-shaped eyes trembling violently, Li Mo didn't feel too good about it. He felt as though her gaze was rather impolite. He remembered when he was little, comparing himself with other kids and blurting out, "My brother dares to eat poop," the kid opposite him had looked at him with almost the same expression.

“Master, actually, if Ying Bing’s cooking isn't bad, then it's still...”

“I get it, you don't need to say anymore. You’ve returned, and you’re alive and well. That’s double happiness. Let’s have a drink, our master and disciple, it’s all in the wine.”

Shang Wu pulled the stopper from the small gourd and took a couple of sips to celebrate. Then she casually stuffed the gourd into Li Mo’s hand and patted his shoulder heavily.

“Good job.”

“......”

How did things develop to the point where the two of us are having a drink together?

With the crisis resolved, Shang Wu happily lay back in her rocking chair, her almond eyes narrowing. The sun was intense today. As she lay down, the sunlight outlined a scroll of a painting. There is a poem that says: *Viewed horizontally, it is a range; viewed vertically, it is a peak...*

Seeing Li Mo about to leave, she turned her head again and asked drowsily, “By the way, my precious disciple, what are we eating tonight?”

The meaning was, since you’re going out anyway, I might as well place my order.

Li Mo couldn't help but grin. “Leftovers. You know, the Nine Peaks Martial Competition is coming up, so I'm quite busy practicing.”

“Hmm?”

“That day, I actually didn't finish eating. There's some Nine-Turn Intestines and stir-fried meat with chili peppers left...”

“!”

Seeing his Master’s sleepiness vanish completely, Li Mo suppressed his laughter and slipped away like an eel.

As his footsteps faded into the distance, Shang Wu glanced at the spot by the water tank where the vegetable basket used to be, now empty. She spat lightly, “Hmph, wicked disciple...”

***

At the same time.

The External Affairs Hall.

“Verification is correct.”

“Inner Disciple Xiao Qin, for hunting down and killing a criminal at the peak of the Blood Transformation Realm, rewarded with 1,000 Contribution Points!”

The Elder of the External Affairs Hall carefully verified the token and nodded with a smile at the young man in front of him. Having just entered the inner sect, he was able to kill a criminal at the peak of the Blood Transformation Realm in actual combat, indicating that the disciple before him was a good seedling. Many of the disciples coming to turn in tasks cast looks of interest at him. Bounty missions offered rich rewards, but they also had high failure rates and significant danger. Thus, not many disciples took on such tasks. A considerable portion of those who did took them to hone themselves.

“1,000 Contribution Points...”

“May I ask the Elder, how many Contribution Points are needed for treasures beneficial to the Soul Will?”

Xiao Qin didn't show much joy on his face.

“Treasures for the Soul Will?”

The inner sect Elder was taken aback and shook his head. “I can tell you without checking: there are none below 30,000 Contribution Points. Those are items used at the Divine Observation Realm. It is too early for you to touch them now. Don't aim too high. I suggest you exchange for some healing items first to avoid leaving hidden injuries.”

The inner sect Elder had a good impression of him, so he said a few extra words.

“Thank you!”

Xiao Qin cupped his fists in thanks and couldn't help but sigh. As expected, it was just as he thought. When he went down the mountain to take tasks, he had inquired about similar items, but either they weren't available, or the price was completely beyond his imagination. Exchanging with Contribution Points within the sect was indeed more cost-effective, but it was still beyond his capacity...

“Child, don't be anxious. I am merely weak; I haven't reached the point of dissipating yet.” The voice of the Thousand Form Martial Sovereign sounded, much weaker than before.

“It’s all my fault. I wasn't careful for a moment.”

Xiao Qin’s face filled with guilt. When he apprehended that criminal, he didn't investigate the other party's information and didn't know the criminal had accomplices, resulting in him being surrounded. This caused his Master to consume a great deal of Soul Will to save him.

“Everyone has their youth. You fought a life-and-death battle for the first time and performed like this; it is already commendable. You are already at the peak of the Blood Transformation Realm, but unfortunately, I am too weak to refine the Tiger Sinew Condensing Qi Pills for you.”

Although the Thousand Form Martial Sovereign was weak, his tone carried a sense of relief.

The Nine Peaks Martial Competition was approaching. Xiao Qin had wanted to break through to the Internal Breath Realm before then and achieve a decent ranking. He never expected to encounter such a misfortune...

“Senior Brother Xiao? You’re here too.”

He had just walked out the door when someone called out to him. Xiao Qin subconsciously turned his head. It was Li Mo, who had arrived at some point, smiling at him.

“Junior Brother Li, are you here to turn in a task too?”

“Yeah, I also took a bounty mission.”

Li Mo nodded. He could also see that Xiao Qin had been in a battle not long ago and some of his injuries hadn't fully healed.

“Apart for three days, one must look at the person anew.”

Xiao Qin couldn't help but feel a bit emotional. Looking at Junior Brother Li’s appearance, he clearly completed the mission easily.要知道, bounty missions are heavy; the targets pursued are at least at the peak of the Blood Transformation Realm. Those below that level are handled by local authorities and wouldn't be reported to the Clear Abyss Sect. Recalling when the two first met, Junior Brother Li had just opened his meridians, and now he can easily kill those at the peak of the Blood Transformation Realm.

“I was lucky. That criminal was injured; he could only exert sixty or seventy percent of his strength.”

“Is that so?”

Hearing Li Mo say that, Xiao Qin relaxed slightly.

“By the way, Senior Brother Xiao, I actually came looking for you yesterday.”

“Junior Brother Li, what is it? Just say it. As long as it's something I can do...”

“I obtained an item by chance. I don't know its specific function. Senior Brother Xiao, you are known for being knowledgeable, so I wanted to ask you to identify it.”

As Li Mo spoke, he reached into his sleeve. He took out a piece of wood that looked neither like wood nor stone and handed it to Xiao Qin.

“I’m afraid I can’t...”

Xiao Qin showed a bitter smile. Usually, when he didn't recognize something, he would ask his Master. But his Master had just spoken a few words to him and then fell into a slumber...

“It’s the Heavy Yin Soul Nourishing Wood!”

An aged voice suddenly sounded in his heart, actually somewhat excited. Wasn't the Master in hibernation? Why did he suddenly seem to wake up abruptly? But immediately after, the Thousand Form Martial Sovereign spoke with an accelerated pace, “This is a rare and excellent item for nourishing the Soul Will. It requires a rare spiritual wood that has been struck by lightning, then happens to sink into a water vein, nourished for many years, until the wood turns to stone and the stone turns to jade before it is formed. Many strong ones who cannot hope to break through a realm will use this wood to make a coffin, seal their physical body, and nourish their Soul Will, waiting for the next era to break the seal and emerge.”

“This piece of Heavy Yin Soul Nourishing Wood has already reached the stage where the wood has turned to stone.”

Xiao Qin understood. His Master meant that this item was very precious and of great use to him. He wanted it. But this was Junior Brother Li’s item...

Xiao Qin took a deep breath and said solemnly, “Junior Brother, this is Heavy Yin Soul Nourishing Wood. It is an item for nourishing the Soul Will and is very precious. You must keep it well. It will be of great use when you reach the Divine Observation Realm later.”

*Oh no.*

*Old Xiao, if you just said this thing isn't worth much, I would have just casually tossed it to you.*

*But then, he wouldn't be him...*

Li Mo could only ask again, “Since it is used for the Divine Observation Realm and is an item for nourishing the Soul Will, why do I see Senior Brother Xiao looking somewhat tempted?”

“To be honest, I do need a similar item.”

Xiao Qin scratched his head awkwardly. His Master was currently cursing him as a wicked disciple in his heart.

Li Mo pondered for a moment. “Then, how about I lend it to you to use first?”
