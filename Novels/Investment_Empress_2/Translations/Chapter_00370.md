# Chapter 370: A Direct Challenge, Drawing the Ice Cube Again (1/2)

The嬴 family courtyard was shrouded in a grey haze.

"Where are Bing'er and Little Mo?"

Mother嬴 scanned the surroundings, but she didn't see her daughter or the Li family's boy. She felt a bit worried; after all, Little Li Mo had the "glorious" history of teaching the little girl how to pee standing up...

"Over there," said嬴 Xuliang, who had just returned from his study, gesturing with his chin toward a corner of the courtyard under a tree.

There was a small table just brought out by a servant, with brushes, ink, paper, and inkstone on it—things Little Li Mo had just asked him for.

Little Li Mo had spread out the paper, letting the sunlight fall on it, looking as serious as a master painter.

Little嬴 Bing sat beside him, grinding the ink with her small hand, adding fragrance to the red sleeves.

"Bing'er is interested in painting?"

"I should learn painting too when I have time," said嬴 Xuliang, watching the two little ones. He felt a bit sour-toothed, then couldn't help but laugh at himself.

It was true his daughter had never ground ink for him, but why should he envy a little kid?

"The ink is ready," said the little ice cube expressionlessly, glancing at Little Li Mo with a cold side-eye.

A child of the same age—how good could his brushwork be?

Thinking of this, Little嬴 Bing's interest suddenly waned.

"Rest assured, I won't let you call me 'Big Brother' for nothing."

Little Li Mo smiled, grabbed the brush, dipped it in ink, and began to write on the blank paper. At first, because his hands were smaller, he felt a bit unaccustomed to it.

But as he painted, he gradually got into the flow, with a style as if dragons and snakes were dancing, a marvelous brush creating flowers.

The little ice cube's eyes grew brighter and brighter.

"This is the street in Qinghe County."

"During the New Year, there will be lion dances, sugar figure vendors, and firecrackers on the street..."

As Li Mo spoke, he painted.

With his introduction, a lively New Year scene came to life.

Unfortunately, he couldn't use his soul force now; otherwise, he could learn from Senior Brother Ouyang and make the painting move, making it even more immersive.

But even so, for Little嬴 Bing, who had never seen the outside world, it was already a fascinating new world.

"How is it?"

Little Li Mo raised his silkworm-like eyebrows.

"So lively..."

嬴 Bing's face looked a bit dazed. Then she withdrew her gaze, her little face quiet, and said softly:

"It's okay."

"J-j-just okay?"

Little Li Painter widened his eyes, doubting his own painting skills. Although this wasn't a God-Viewing Painting, as a meticulous brushwork painting, it was pretty good, right?

After all, he had painted so many insights into martial arts.

But the little ice cube didn't clap and say, "Big Brother is amazing," and actually thought it was just passable?

"Wait, I was just warming up!"

Little Li Painter, not believing it, picked up the brush again.

"Look, this is the Qingyuan Sect. Do you know the Qingyuan Sect? It's the largest sect in the Ziyang Prefecture, and the masters inside are very interesting."

"This is Elder Xue. He's a genius alchemist. He once took a lantern to the latrine to look for pills..."

"This is Elder Qian. When eating with him, don't talk. I suspect he has two mouths; he can talk and eat and still finish all the dishes on the table..."

Landscapes and figures appeared vividly on the paper.

Little嬴 Bing's eyes shimmered with frost and snow, looking a bit misty.

"Hmm, not bad..."

"?"

Little Li Mo noticed something was off. The little ice cube was already pursing her lips, her eyes glistening, but her little mouth kept evaluating: "Okay," "Not bad," "Decent."

He suspected the little ice cube was doing it on purpose!

She was deliberately saying his paintings were average, so he'd paint more like he was pumped up.

So she hadn't suddenly become a bad ice cube; she was a little bad ice cube even as a幼崽 (cub)...

"Forget it, if it's embarrassing to paint, then let's just stop."

Little Li Mo pretended to sigh and started slacking off.

---

"?"

The little ice cube saw that Little Li Mo had caught on to her trick. She lowered her eyes, the sunlight coloring her long eyelashes with a shimmer, a lively blush appearing on her fair face.

"Big Brother... paint another one."

"!"

Li Mo felt a shock all over, his skull almost flying off, and the brush dropped to the ground with a plop.

How could she start at zero frames and directly unleash a big move right in his face?

Cute like this—is there no law? Is there no justice?

This is a foul!

For such an extremely foul act... of course, he would satisfy her.

Little Li Mo didn't withstand this test, so he slapped his uncooperative little hands twice and continued painting.

Bro... Big Brother?

Just as嬴 Xuliang came to see the two little ones, his body shook like he'd been struck by lightning.

The mindset he had just adjusted shattered into pieces all over the ground.

Why? What does this kid have to make my daughter so cute?!

Just because of a not-so-good painting... Huh?

Little Li Mo held the brush, and a quiet, beautiful world gradually emerged from his brush: a small courtyard under a bright moon, a river flowing quietly, a banyan tree lush and green...

The plaque on the gate read:

'Autumn Water Pavilion'

Is this the brushwork of a child?

"By the way, do you want to see what you'll look like when you grow up?"

Little Li Mo finished painting and sneezed. The little ice cube was leaning too close, almost touching heads, and her hair brushed past his nose tip with the breeze.

"Grown-up... me?"

"Yes."

"I want to see." ×2

Little嬴 Bing hadn't spoken yet, but嬴 Xuliang and his wife behind her said in unison.

Li Mo was startled by the voices behind him.

You just wanted to secretly elope with the little girl, now you're holding her little hand painting, and you got caught by her parents—how scary is that?

But it seems Uncle and Auntie's attention is all on the "Big Ice Cube."

Thinking of this, Li Mo suddenly got lost in thought.

Which parents, when looking at their little beans at home, haven't fantasized about what their children would look like when they grow up?

But Uncle嬴 and Auntie will never see it...

嬴 Xuliang went to get his treasured paper and ink stick and prepared them for him again.

"Okay," he rolled up his sleeves and took the brush with utmost seriousness.

He used the method of drawing a God-Viewing Painting. Although his soul strength wasn't enough now to draw a real God-Viewing Painting.

Under the banyan tree, the four people—painting and watching—held their breath.

After a while.

Sunlight filtered through the tree shadows, dyeing the scroll with mottled golden fragments.

The少女's (maiden's) exquisite shadow appeared vividly on the paper, bright and clear, with interplay of light and dark.

It was as if, through the scroll, she was looking back at you.

"Bing'er's grown-up... appearance?"

Mother嬴 looked at the maiden in the painting, stunned, complex emotions of joy and complexity surging in her heart, tears flickering in her eyes.

"Hahaha, my daughter has grown up to be graceful and beautiful, so beautiful..."

嬴 Xuliang laughed heartily, feeling that his daughter should look just like this in the future.

"This is... me?"

Little嬴 Bing felt very strange.

This painting gave her a feeling of crossing time and space and looking at her future self. An inexplicable sense of familiarity, like a light dispelling the fog, lit up over her heart's lake...

"It's not finished yet."

"What's missing?"

"Of course, me. I'll grow up too. Aren't you curious what I'll look like in the future?"

Little Li Mo smiled and pointed at himself.
