# Chapter 61: Setting the Trap

This Ye Tian was truly full of surprises—not only was he a demonic cultivator with a treasure like the Hundred Souls Banner, but he even possessed a spirit artifact. 

Yet Lin Xuan remained calm, his emotions a mix of concern and delight. His worry stemmed from the realization that his opponent was even more formidable than expected, armed with multiple treasures. His delight came from the knowledge that Ye Tian's wealth would soon be his once he killed him.

Though Ye Tian was strong and well-equipped, Lin Xuan was confident in his victory. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators couldn't match his resources, so defeating Ye Tian was a certainty—though it would require some effort.

The fiery serpent in the air was intimidating, but Lin Xuan's spiritual sense had already determined it was merely a low-grade spirit artifact. This was unsurprising—not everyone was as fortunate as him, blessed with extraordinary encounters.

For a low-level cultivator in the Qi Refining stage, possessing even a low-grade spirit artifact was remarkable. The only exception had been Senior Sister Zhou Yan, who had reached the Great Perfection realm, enjoyed her sect's favor, and hailed from a powerful cultivation family. Her wealth had ultimately fallen into Lin Xuan's hands.

With a flick of his sleeve, Lin Xuan summoned a golden rope about a foot long, sending it to intercept the oncoming fiery serpent.

Ye Tian's eyes nearly bulged out of their sockets, his expression darkening as he stared at Lin Xuan as if he were a monster. He couldn't fathom how a supposed "ordinary person" without spiritual roots could possess such wealth—beast soul talismans, spirit artifacts...

Though he didn't recognize the rope's exact nature, its spiritual pressure confirmed it was a mid-grade spirit artifact. His fiery serpent was in danger.

Gritting his teeth, Ye Tian poured his spiritual energy into the serpent, hoping his "superior" cultivation level could compensate for the artifact's lower grade.

Lin Xuan feigned distress but inwardly sneered. He saw through Ye Tian's plan—his use of Red Silk Grass to conceal his true cultivation had led Ye Tian to miscalculate. The Hundred Souls Banner and the beast soul talisman were evenly matched, and now Ye Tian was foolishly pitting his low-grade artifact against Lin Xuan's mid-grade one.

Ye Tian believed that with his sixth-layer cultivation, he could outlast Lin Xuan, who was supposedly only at the fourth layer. Even if his low-grade artifact consumed more energy, his superior cultivation would ensure victory.

The fish had taken the bait. By playing along, Lin Xuan could easily exhaust Ye Tian's spiritual energy before finishing him off. But Lin Xuan had other plans.

First, he didn't want to waste the beast soul talisman's energy. Second, though they were far from the main road, the area wasn't entirely secluded. Prolonging the fight risked drawing unwanted attention.

If someone came to investigate, the situation could turn disastrous. Lin Xuan preferred to avoid complications—striking swiftly was the best course of action.

Lin Xuan reached into his robe again. Though Ye Tian grew wary, he remained confident. In his mind, Lin Xuan, at the fourth layer, was already straining to control both the beast soul talisman and the mid-grade spirit artifact. Even if he had more treasures, he wouldn't have the energy to use them.

At most, he might activate a few low-level talismans.

With a cold laugh, Ye Tian waved his Hundred Souls Banner, summoning a dense ghostly mist that formed a protective black barrier around him.

While the banner's offensive power was slightly inferior to a top-grade spirit artifact, its dual offensive and defensive capabilities made it invaluable.

The situation seemed clear—Lin Xuan's beast soul talisman would soon deplete, and his mid-grade artifact would drain his spiritual energy. Victory was assured.

Ye Tian's face twisted into a cruel grin, his eyes gleaming with bloodlust. Demonic cultivators thrived on slaughter, and killing Lin Xuan would grant him even more treasures. Though he didn't know what else Lin Xuan had, the mid-grade artifact and beast soul talisman alone were enough to make him salivate.

Lin Xuan observed Ye Tian's expression and inwardly scoffed, though he outwardly feigned panic, as if he had exhausted all his resources and was cornered.

"Junior Brother Lin," Ye Tian said with a pleasant tone that belied his malice, "I don't know how a rootless disciple like you reached the fourth layer, but it doesn't matter. Today, I'll send you to the afterlife. Don't thank me—I won't waste your soul. It'll make a fine addition to my Hundred Souls Banner."

Lin Xuan's face paled further, beads of sweat forming on his forehead as if terrified by Ye Tian's threats. The golden rope trembled in the air, giving the fiery serpent an opening to press its advantage.

Ye Tian grinned. Novices were so predictable—panic weakened their focus, reducing their combat effectiveness. He prepared to seize the moment and crush Lin Xuan in one decisive strike.

But then, Lin Xuan tossed something into the air.

At first, Ye Tian paid it no mind. His ghostly barrier was incredibly sturdy—even high-level spells or the most powerful mid-level Ice Needle Technique could only breach it once. Given Lin Xuan's depleted energy, he could only activate low-level talismans at best. What was there to fear?

But he soon realized his mistake.

The object hovered midair, releasing an overwhelming spiritual pressure that instantly eclipsed both the fiery serpent and the golden rope.

"A... a top-grade spirit artifact?" Ye Tian's voice was dreamlike, his eyes wide with terror.

Lin Xuan no longer concealed his cultivation. His aura surged, revealing power that surpassed even Ye Tian's.

"No... impossible!" Ye Tian's voice cracked with hysteria. "You've been in the valley for less than four years. A rootless disciple can't possibly reach the sixth layer of Qi Refining!"

His confidence shattered. He had been so sure of victory, only to realize Lin Xuan had been playing the fool, luring him into a carefully laid trap.
