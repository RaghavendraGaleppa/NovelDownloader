# Chapter 84 Buddha Shell

The black-gold mecha vanished without a trace, having turned to dust.

But in the time it bought, on the ancient ship's side, all the metal parts that had detached from the Mechanical Battle Buddha reassembled, forming a massive elliptical shell that protected the eight warships. Erto's eyes flashed with lightning, and Thor's Hammer vibrated in his hand. He had just wielded the hammer, unleashing a lightning storm, but he couldn't stop the incoming mechanical parts. After all, it was a Dao Lord-level battle mecha; although it was only a semi-finished product, all the materials used to create it were genuine Dao Lord-level materials, inherently possessing immense power, making it difficult for even Heavenly Kings like them to stop. The milky-white light beam unleashed by Gabriel struck the metal shell formed by the Battle Buddha, leaving not even a single mark.

Finally, the metal cage that had separated from the Dao Lord during the explosion transformed back into nine mechanical orbs. These orbs then assembled into nine massive thrusters on the elliptical shell of the Mechanical Battle Buddha.

Boom!

Thick energy jets spewed out, and the elliptical shell shuddered, almost transforming into a streak of light as it shot towards the Land of the Forsaken Gods. Wherever it passed, the void was torn apart.

Gabriel and the others' faces were grim. They had paid such a heavy price, yet the opponent still escaped, only losing one Heavenly King-level individual. Thinking of this, they all, by unspoken agreement, glanced at the Dao Lord-level mighty figure beside them. It was all his fault. If he had gone all out from the beginning and suppressed the opponent with the power of thunder, there wouldn't have been so many unexpected complications. He just had to show off and messed up, didn't he?

The Dao Lord's expression was also displeased. The people behind Gabriel and the others had paid a price to enlist his faction's help. His failure didn't just cost him his own face, but also that of the powerful figures behind him. With a "rumble," thousands upon thousands of scarlet flame divine feathers emerged from his body, transforming into peerless immortal arrows, densely packed. These were Dao Lord-level feather arrows, formed from his divine ability's feathers, possessing infinite power. A single feather arrow was enough to shatter a region of heaven and earth, let alone so many.

The bronze divine spear in his hand emitted a faint glow, and various intricate symbols appeared on its shaft, floating before him. His two hands erupted with endless runes, and he frantically spat out golden essence blood from his mouth. This was his heart essence blood, containing immeasurable vital energy. This was a forbidden grand divine ability, requiring a great sacrifice. The bronze-colored divine spear was stained crimson, emitting a monstrous malevolent aura, instantly—

Boom!

Thousands of feather arrows, along with the crimson divine spear, shot out. In this place, the ripples unleashed could annihilate worlds. The endless scarlet flame feather arrows cleared the path, with the crimson divine spear following closely behind. Their speed continuously escalated, almost imperceptible to the naked eye, surpassing space itself.

After the elliptical metal shell of the Mechanical Battle Buddha was empowered by the nine mechanical orbs turned thrusters, its speed became incredibly fast, completely surpassing the full-speed travel of a Dao Lord-level mighty figure. This was because the Mechanical Battle Buddha had abandoned all other functions, dedicating all its energy supply solely to acceleration. This was also why that Dao Lord hadn't caught up. It was extremely difficult to catch up, and even if he paid the price to burst his speed and catch up, it would be hard to break through the metal shell. It was more reliable to use his energy to unleash a forbidden divine ability from the start.

The distance to the Land of the Forsaken Gods was rapidly shortening. What would have originally taken almost a full day to reach was now reduced by dozens of times. At this rate, they should arrive in about fifteen minutes.

Inside the elliptical metal shell, the golden light array enveloping the eight warships was riddled with cracks. It had almost been breached by Gabriel and the others, and now the Mechanical Battle Buddha's terrifying speed brought immense tearing forces, making its situation even worse. However, before Zhou XunChuan and the others could worry about the tearing forces that would directly shred them if the array broke, they noticed the Mechanical Battle Buddha's speed was slowly decreasing.

"This Battle Buddha is just a semi-finished product; many parts are incomplete. It's difficult to maintain that speed without anyone controlling it!"

Worman's face was filled with pain. The Saint King who had just sacrificed himself was from their faction and had countless ties to him. How could he not be sad? But he also knew this was the only way. If he hadn't been ordered to bring the Battle Buddha to collect divine cores, they would probably all have been lost here.

"Can any of us control it?" asked Wei Chuan's grandfather. He was currently being supported by Wei Chuan, barely holding on. He, the purple-robed Daoist, and the white-robed assassin had taken advantage of the black-gold mecha's self-detonation and the fireball attacks to use the Mechanical Battle Buddha's parts and their own divine abilities to reach the ancient ship.

"No, this Battle Buddha has been restricted. It can only be controlled by Mech-force. I don't have high enough authority to lift the restrictions." Worman was helpless. When he brought the Mechanical Battle Buddha, the higher-ups of the Artifice Nation had set permissions for its AI. It could only be controlled by Mech-force. It wasn't impossible to lift the restriction, but it required very high authority, and he didn't possess enough.

Mech-force was a unique path developed by their Artifice Nation, combining spiritual energy and the way of machinery. It almost perfectly integrated with machines and provided great amplification, and only people from the Artifice Nation could cultivate it. If he were to control it, he would probably be torn apart instantly, with no second possibility.

Before they could contemplate more countermeasures, the space inside the mechanical shell vibrated violently.

Clang! Clang!

Outside, as the Mechanical Battle Buddha decelerated and the scarlet flame divine feathers continuously accelerated, they finally caught up. The divine feathers struck the metal shell repeatedly, producing clanging sounds. The sound waves alone repelled the nearby void storms. Although a single feather couldn't cause much damage, there were tens of millions of feather arrows behind it.

The Dao Lord also understood the principle of breaking a point to break the whole. He did not disperse the power; all the feather arrows struck the same spot. A clean metal surface developed a white mark, which then expanded into a small pit. The scarlet flame divine feathers struck it like a rain curtain, and soon the pit grew larger and deeper. The blood-colored patterns within the metal became visible—this was a renowned metal in the outside world. The shell formed by the Mechanical Battle Buddha was very thick, but under the continuous barrage of scarlet flame divine feathers, it was almost penetrated. Finally, all the scarlet flame divine feathers were exhausted, and only a sliver of the metal shell remained unpunctured.

Boom!

The crimson divine spear followed closely. The scarlet flame divine feathers had been used solely to clear a path for the spear. The divine spear struck the metal shell, now only a sliver thick, creating dazzling sparks. But how could such a remaining thickness withstand the powerful crimson divine spear? It couldn't hold on for long, and the metal shattered.

The people on the ancient ship changed color, all staring at the incoming crimson divine spear. To facilitate its penetration of the metal shell, the spear had already shrunk to its original slender thickness. Though just over ten feet long, everyone felt a lump in their throat, a chill down their spine, and their scalps tingling.

By unspoken agreement, the purple-robed Daoist, Wei Chuan's grandfather, and the white-robed assassin unleashed surging magical power from their bodies. Runes poured forth, and disregarding their injuries, endless energy surged into the golden light array.
