# Chapter 297: Bridging the Gap

Bai Zhi’s Frost-Clad Sword was like an arctic chill; wherever its blade passed, the air condensed into spiderweb-like frost cracks.

*Clang!*

At the thirteenth clash between the heavy mace and the long sword, Xu Yunfan was forced back three steps. With each step on the black stone, he left a footprint three inches deep.

This black stone was mixed with black gold; a normal Cleansing Marrow expert’s full-force strike could only scratch it, yet Xu Yunfan left such deep imprints, showing just how terrifying the force he was withstanding was.

But what was truly frightening was that he actually used the rebound force to twist his waist and hips. His spine undulated like a great dragon, and the "Mountain Splitting Stance" of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique was顺势劈出. This completely defied the common sense of a martial artist’s energy recovery!

Xu Yunfan’s martial arts characteristics were already far beyond what an ordinary martial artist could compare to. Even after being forced back three steps by a single sword strike, he instantly clashed with Bai Zhi again.

Bai Zhi’s pupils contracted. She clearly saw that the moment the opponent was invaded by the Xuanming energy into his muscles and skin, several strands of pure yang true energy surged. The chilling energy was actually forcibly expelled from his pores, turning into fine ice crystals that burst forth.

The two were locked in a fierce battle. Xu Yunfan felt exhilarated as he fought, becoming more and more excited. It had been a long time since he had encountered someone who was so evenly matched with him.

The thirty-six peak disciples watching from below were already silent. Only the rustling of snow on pine branches and the sound of snowflakes bursting forth from the shockwaves created by the continuous clashing of metal remained.

A Cleansing Marrow realm expert clashing head-on with a Mid-Viscera realm expert should have been like an ant shaking a tree. Yet, not only did Xu Yunfan not show any signs of defeat, he grew fiercer the longer he fought. His body was truly like forged steel; having taken so many heavy hits, he showed no signs of discomfort!

"This defies the principles of martial dao!"

A true disciple from the Flowing Cloud Peak crushed the railing, his knuckles turning white.

He clearly saw that every time the Xuanming energy invaded Xu Yunfan’s meridians, a faint red glow of pure yang true energy would flash beneath his skin. The cold poison that was enough to freeze refined steel was actually forcibly expelled by the pure yang true energy, exploding into ice crystals.

"He's completely cheating. If it weren't for that pure yang true energy, he would have been frozen into an ice sculpture long ago."

A disciple from the Mysterious Sky Peak beside him sneered upon hearing this. "Every peak has the Pure Yang One Qi Art. If you have the ability, you should cultivate it to perfection and turn your inner breath into pure yang true energy. Then you can go up too."

The Flowing Cloud Peak disciple instantly shut his mouth.

If turning inner breath into pure yang true energy was that easy, why had only Bi Yuan, the Sect Master, achieved it in the past few hundred years?

With true energy and a perfected physical body, as long as the opponent didn't die young, the gate to the Ninth Realm was undoubtedly open to him.

In the Azure Dark Peak camp, the jade folding fan engraved with "Mountains and Rivers in a Painting" in Lu Wuchen’s hand suddenly snapped in two with a *crack*.

The cross-section of the fan bone was as smooth as a cut by a knife, reflecting his suddenly contracting pupils.

On Xu Yunfan’s bulging right arm, the dragon scale armor plates moved rhythmically. The small scales appeared as the blue-black muscles writhed like living things. Every swing of the mace caused the air to emit a dragon-like roar.

"Dragon Marrow Transformation... Jade Bone Resonance..."

His Adam's apple rolled, his voice dry with disbelief. "This is clearly the sign of the Minor Achievement of the Mi Tuo Temple's Muscle and Marrow Transformation Technique!"

The trip to the Northern Desert three years ago suddenly flashed before his eyes. He had personally witnessed the Chief of the Disciplinary Hall of Mi Tuo Temple use this very technique to blast the Great乾 cavalry, men and horses alike, into blood mist.

But this temple-guarding supreme technique was never taught to outsiders. Yet, this kid in front of him...

"Minor Achievement of the Muscle and Marrow Transformation Technique... This guy actually dared to snatch food from a tiger's mouth, using Mi Tuo Temple's supreme technique!"

His voice was hoarse. "Combined with the golden fire furnace protection of pure yang true energy, he can actually forcibly bridge the gap in realms!"

Lu Wuchen’s gaze swept like lightning across the viewing platform, pausing abruptly as it passed the several chiefs of the Mysterious Sky Peak. That usually cold-faced elder of the Punishment Hall showed no surprise at all. The Chief of the Scripture Pavilion, sitting next to Bi Yuan, didn't even notice his tea cup tilting, letting the water soak his Daoist robe. These old monsters who had lived for decades were clearly more aware of what this meant than he was.

The various forces within the Dao Sect were jostling for power; this person was a pawn pushed out by Sect Master Bi Yuan to fight in this arena!

"So that's it..."

Lu Wuchen lowered his eyelids, grinding the remnants of the fan into dust in his palm.

He finally understood why Xu Yunfan could clash with a Viscera realm expert while being at the Cleansing Marrow realm.

Flowing through that body was clearly a fusion of Mi Tuo Temple's body-forging supreme technique, the Pure Yang One Qi Art, and some ancient aura that even he couldn't see through.

It was like melting Black Iron, Star Sand, and Dragon Blood Gold into one furnace, forcibly building an iron chain bridge over the chasm of realms!

If Bai Zhi was a genius among geniuses, then the Xu Yunfan before her was a monster who had gathered a body full of divine techniques and supreme arts.

On the擂台, at the seventy-third move, Bai Zhi suddenly changed her stance, finally finding a flaw.

Her left hand sword finger thrust out, slicing through the air. The tip of her finger broke through the shockwave, faintly glowing blue as a Xuan Yin Bone-Piercing Finger aimed straight for Xu Yunfan’s navel.

Yunfan’s abdominal muscles bulged suddenly like thousand-refined steel. The Hundred-Refined Steel Technique and the Muscle and Marrow Transformation Technique formed interlocking golden patterns beneath his skin, while pure yang true energy formed a half-inch thick energy armor on his surface.

Sensing the danger, the Dragon Scale Armor, having devoured two divine armors, instantly contracted the countless scales, emitting a crisp sound like the striking of jade and gold, wrapping Xu Yunfan’s body tightly without a gap.

*Clang!*

Bai Zhi let out a muffled groan and retreated violently, her left sword finger already bent at a strange angle. The sword finger she had cultivated for twenty years felt as if it had been smashed by a thousand-Jun heavy hammer. Fine blood beads seeped from under her fingernails, but before they could drop, they were vaporized into red mist by the residual pure yang true energy on the Dragon Scale Armor.

"Senior Sister Bai, a mortal body usually can't clash head-on with a divine weapon!" Xu Yunfan grinned.

He could cross a major realm to fight the Viscera realm Minor Achievement Bai Zhi; the Dragon Scale Armor he wore was indispensable.

In the next instant, he abandoned defense for offense, using the killing move of the Eight荒 Dragon Fall with the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace.

As Bai Zhi raised her sword to block, she was startled to find that a spiral force coming from the mace made it difficult to hold her sword steady. The variation that fused the Nine-Transformations亢 Dragon Mace Technique left her momentarily unaccustomed to it.

The collision of sword and mace burst forth a shockwave. Bai Zhi’s tiger's mouth split open, and her long sword bent into a full moon shape.

"Break!"

Xu Yunfan’s roar was like thunder. The muscles on his right arm suddenly swelled to twice their size, and his upper body robe exploded completely.

The Dragon Scale Armor plates fluttered rapidly, spewing hot breath, and pure yang true energy spewed forth with the Blazing Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace.

Under the immense pressure, fine cracks appeared deep within Bai Zhi’s Ice Muscle and Jade Bone, yet she remained silent and activated the forbidden chapter of the Xuan Ming Jade Manual, "Freezing a Thousand Miles."

Her body emitted an unimaginable energy. The擂台 beneath their feet instantly froze into an iceberg, and countless snowflakes turned into ice spikes erupting from the ground.

Xu Yunfan showed no fear. Such an area-of-effect secret martial art might have great destructive power against groups, but for him, wearing the Dragon Scale Armor and cultivating a body of extreme hardness, it was nothing.

But he knew clearly that if he let the opponent gain the upper hand in this move, he would face Bai Zhi’s true killing move in the very next moment.
