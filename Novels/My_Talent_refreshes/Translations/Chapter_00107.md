Chapter 107: Incomplete Artifacts, Earth Spirit Bracelet

The Treasury Pavilion was a three-story building, located not far from the Spirit Talisman Pavilion in the outer sect. Chu Ning had seen it from a distance when he went to the Spirit Talisman Pavilion before, so he knew its location.

Chu Ning entered the Treasury Pavilion and scanned his surroundings. Similar to the main hall of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, there was only a young man of twenty-seven or twenty-eight years old sitting behind a table, leaning lazily on a chair, seemingly feigning sleep.

Chu Ning walked up to him, sensing that the other party was likely in the late-stage Qi Condensation, not yet at Foundation Establishment. He clasped his fists and bowed in greeting.

"Greetings, Senior Brother. I have returned from Yanji Market, and today I have come to..."

"I know," the young man said, still in a lazy manner. "You're here to collect your rewards today; they've already informed me. You came quite early. Go up to the second floor from the east side and find Elder Tong."

Chu Ning wanted to ask more, but the young man had already closed his eyes again. Seeing this, Chu Ning did not press further. He clasped his fists once more towards the young man and then walked up to the second floor directly from the east side.

The Treasury Pavilion seemed to have internal divisions with different staircases. When Chu Ning reached the second floor, he found himself directly outside a room. By the door, an elder with white hair and beard, and numerous wrinkles on his face, was staring at him as he came up the stairs.

Chu Ning looked around and didn't see anyone else, so he immediately bowed and asked, "May I ask if you are Elder Tong?"

"Indeed, that would be this old man," the elder said, stroking his long beard as he looked at Chu Ning. "Are you here to collect your reward? What's your name?"

"Chu Ning!"

Upon hearing this, the elder took out a jade slip and began to examine it. Seizing the opportunity, Chu Ning also observed Elder Tong, and was greatly surprised to find that the elder appeared to only be at mid-stage Qi Condensation.

"To be called an elder, even if just an elder of the Treasury Pavilion, their rank shouldn't be low. How could they only be at mid-stage Qi Condensation? Could it be that this senior also has some secret technique to conceal their aura, only revealing their mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivation?" Chu Ning mused inwardly. His own Yinwood Spirit Physique had such an ability, and while others might not possess this spirit physique, he knew of some special secret techniques that also offered this function.

"Do you think my cultivation is very low?" Elder Tong suddenly asked while Chu Ning was pondering this.

Chu Ning was startled. After a moment's thought, he still answered honestly, "This disciple is indeed a little surprised. Your cultivation base appears to only be at mid-stage Qi Condensation. Could it be due to some secret technique?"

Elder Tong glanced at Chu Ning. "You are quite honest. Many people who think the same way would try to make up all sorts of excuses to fob off this old man. What secret technique or not, this is my true cultivation base right now. It's good enough that I managed to save my life after a severe injury; how could I still think about cultivation..."

Perhaps because Chu Ning had been quite truthful, the elder even offered a brief explanation. However, he quickly picked up the jade slip again.

"Chu Ning, one damaged mid-grade defensive magic tool, killed 3 Yin Demon Sect disciples."

After speaking, Elder Tong put down the jade slip and looked at Chu Ning. "You can select another defensive magic tool of the same grade, and I will also reward you with a mid-grade offensive magic tool. Come with this old man."

"Senior," Chu Ning did not immediately follow but quickly called out to Elder Tong. When the elder looked back, Chu Ning swiftly continued, "May I choose a magic tool, but instead of this offensive magic tool, opt for a higher-grade defensive magic tool?"

"Exchange for a high-grade defensive magic tool?" Elder Tong stroked his long beard. "Alright, considering you killed three Yin Demon Sect disciples this time, I'll allow it. These high-grade defensive magic tools are truly precious."

Saying this, Elder Tong continued to walk forward. Chu Ning immediately followed. He thought for a moment, then gritted his teeth and said, "Senior, if this disciple wishes to exchange for a peak-grade defensive magic tool from the sect, I wonder..."

"Peak-grade defensive magic tools?" Elder Tong shook his head slightly. "Even Foundation Establishment cultivators scramble for those; don't even think about it. Among cultivators below the Core Formation stage, apart from certain special magic tools and incomplete artifacts, these are the most sought-after. The inner sect might have them, but our outer sect's Treasury Pavilion does not."

Chu Ning felt a slight disappointment upon hearing this, but he also caught Elder Tong's mention of "incomplete artifacts."

"Incomplete artifacts?" Chu Ning couldn't help but murmur the term. This was the second time he had heard it; previously, in Wind Gorge Market, that pair of swindlers had mentioned it.

However, at the time, Chu Ning had dismissed it, assuming the two were merely tricksters. Now, hearing Elder Tong mention it again, he couldn't help but feel a surge of curiosity.

Elder Tong had already led Chu Ning to a stone door. He pressed a spot on a certain restriction, and the stone door slowly opened. He stepped in first, and his voice drifted back.

"Core Formation cultivators can refine artifacts, which are divided into two types: one is a Natal Artifact, refined with one's own Pill Fire. The other is a common artifact, not refined with Pill Fire. Such artifacts are more prone to damage than Natal Artifacts. Therefore, there are often some incomplete artifacts that still possess part of their former power, but have numerous restrictions on their use."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he quickly pressed, "Senior, what are the common restrictions?"

Elder Tong seemed quite willing to explain things. He didn't hide anything now and answered directly, "For instance, common limitations include immense spiritual energy consumption, requiring essence blood to activate, or losing a portion of their power with each use. Some have limited uses, perhaps only one or two times. Others require a certain period to recover their power after a single use, and so on."

Chu Ning immediately thought of the small black dagger that Old Man Sun had used to kill that yellow-faced man. He had tried using that dagger once when retrieving the Blood-Marked Unicellular Ape, and found it could be activated. Although he hadn't fully unleashed its power, he felt it was extremely potent. Moreover, that very item required a period of recovery after each use. Could this small black dagger also be an incomplete artifact? Chu Ning felt this judgment was very likely.

Of course, at this moment, he couldn't take it out for the elder to examine, so he remained silent and followed the elder into the room.

"This chamber is specifically for storing high-grade defensive magic tools. Their number is not large. There are corresponding introductions on each, so choose for yourself. Once you've made your selection, I will retrieve it for you." After entering the room, Elder Tong said to Chu Ning, then sat down leisurely on a reclining chair in the room.

Chu Ning, seeing this, walked towards the shelves lined with magic tools.

"Azurewood Shield, wood-attributed defensive magic tool, effective against poisonous gas."

"Blazing Fire Shield, fire-attributed defensive magic tool, can conjure a flame barrier around the body."

"Earth Spirit Orb, earth-attributed defensive magic tool, can form an earth-attributed defensive shield when activated."

Chu Ning looked at them one by one, finding that the shelves contained defensive magic tools of various attributes. Among them, earth-attributed ones were the most numerous. Chu Ning wasn't particularly picky about this. Although defensive magic tools had attributes, for most of them, there were no attribute requirements for spiritual energy, except for a few with special demands. So, in Chu Ning's view, they were all similar. He hoped to find one with stronger defensive capabilities.

After looking at about thirty or so items, Chu Ning suddenly stopped before a particular magic tool: the Earth Spirit Bracelet.

Before Chu Ning was a bracelet-type magic tool, but it was much wider than a normal bracelet, nearly two inches wide. On this two-inch wide bracelet were numerous small square holes, as many as ten. When Chu Ning looked at the introduction for the bracelet, his eyes immediately lit up.

"Earth Spirit Bracelet, earth-attributed high-grade magic tool. When activated, it can form an earth-attributed spiritual energy shield around the entire body. Adding Earth Spirit Crystals provides spiritual energy, increasing defensive power. Each crystal adds ten percent, with a maximum of ten Earth Spirit Crystals. When ten Earth Spirit Crystals are activated simultaneously, the defensive power can reach approximately sixty percent of a normal earth-attributed peak-grade magic tool. After a single activation, the spiritual energy from all Earth Spirit Crystals on the bracelet will be completely consumed."

Earth Spirit Crystals, he had those! Chu Ning had harvested a large piece of Earth Spirit Crystal from the Blood-Marked Unicellular Ape's cave. Looking at the size of the ten square holes on the bracelet, even if he cut a few hundred pieces, the Earth Spirit Crystal would still be more than enough.

"Elder, I've made my choice!" Chu Ning exclaimed with almost no hesitation.

Elder Tong heard Chu Ning's words, rose, and walked over. When he saw that Chu Ning had chosen the Earth Spirit Bracelet, he seemed slightly surprised.

"Although this Earth Spirit Bracelet's defensive power is not weak, its true potential can only be unleashed with the aid of Earth Spirit Crystals. Otherwise, its power offers no advantage over other magic tools." Elder Tong said, shaking his head. "But Earth Spirit Crystals, let alone ten, even one would cost a significant amount of spirit stones, and it might not even be available for purchase. Are you sure you want this one?"

As he spoke, Elder Tong glanced at Chu Ning. Chu Ning nodded lightly.

"Elder, I will take this one. If push comes to shove, I'll just spend more spirit stones to buy more Earth Spirit Crystals." Chu Ning then smiled and added, "If my life is gone, no amount of spirit stones will be of any use."

"What you said is not wrong," Elder Tong replied, taking out a restriction token from his person and immediately deactivating the restriction. "I also had the same thought as you back then: if my life is gone, what good is this cultivation base? That's why I'm able to stay here."

Elder Tong then took out the Earth Spirit Bracelet and handed it to Chu Ning. "Here you go. With this high-grade magic tool, if you can find Earth Spirit Crystals, it will indeed provide an additional means of self-preservation in future battles. Oh, and these spirit crystals, like spirit stones, are extremely hard, but they are surprisingly easy to cut with a jade knife. If you acquire spirit crystals in the future, you can use a jade knife to cut them into small pieces to embed in this bracelet."

As he spoke, Elder Tong gave Chu Ning a meaningful look. Sensing the elder's gaze, Chu Ning immediately had a feeling of being seen through. "Could this Elder Tong have guessed that I possess Earth Spirit Crystals?" Chu Ning mused inwardly, maintaining a calm expression on the surface. He gratefully clasped his hands towards Elder Tong. "Thank you for the information, Elder."

Elder Tong nodded slightly, then strode towards the outside. "Since you have chosen, let's go."

Chu Ning saw that Elder Tong seemed quite willing to explain things, so he thought for a moment and couldn't resist asking, "Elder, if one wishes to cultivate a higher-grade cultivation technique in the sect, how does one exchange for it?"

"Cultivation technique?" Elder Tong shook his head. "The sect's cultivation techniques are not available for any exchange. When you cultivate to the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, go find a steward or elder within the hall. They will naturally allow you to choose a subsequent cultivation technique based on your situation."

Upon hearing Elder Tong's words, Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly. He was already at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation. Reaching the ninth layer might take a long time for others, but for him, combined with medicinal pills, spirit stones, and the Azurewood Spring Bloom Art, this time would be greatly shortened. The problem was, even if he reached the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, he couldn't immediately display it to others. How then could he request subsequent cultivation techniques from the sect through the Spirit Talisman Pavilion or the Spirit Plant Chamber?

"Unless..."

Just then, Elder Tong added another sentence. Chu Ning quickly pressed, "Elder, unless what?"

"Unless you become an inner sect true disciple," Elder Tong looked at Chu Ning with a faint smile. "If you can become an inner sect true disciple, you can choose higher-grade cultivation techniques. These techniques often include cultivation methods for the Foundation Establishment stage."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning smiled wryly and shook his head. "This disciple is dull-witted and lacks talent; I have no chance of becoming an inner disciple." After saying this, he immediately changed the subject. "Elder, this time, after killing the Yin Demon Sect members, this disciple also acquired some magic tools. I wonder if the sect will reclaim these magic tools or allow them to be exchanged for other items."

Elder Tong nodded. "That is indeed possible. What magic tools do you have?"

Chu Ning immediately took out three magic tools from his storage bag that he had obtained from the Yin Demon Sect disciples but felt he wouldn't use: the mid-grade Black Wheel, which could both attack and defend, the powerful mid-grade long saber, and a low-grade magic tool. As for the magic tools he obtained from Old Liu and his group, Chu Ning did not take them out.

"These magic tools cannot be directly used by our sect's cultivators, but they can be modified in the Artifact Forging Hall," Elder Tong said, then asked Chu Ning, "What do you wish to exchange these magic tools for?"

Chu Ning quickly replied, "If possible, this disciple would like to exchange them for an offensive magic tool with greater destructive power." He already possessed a Divine Wood Longbow, primarily used in conjunction with his Azurewood Sword Art for attacks. Chu Ning thought that he should have more offensive options. It would naturally be better if he could also acquire another high-grade offensive magic tool of a different attribute.

"A high-grade offensive magic tool with greater destructive power," Elder Tong mused for a moment. "It might barely be possible to exchange for one, but these are not magic tools rewarded by the sect, so you won't have a choice. I'll find one for you, and you can see if it's suitable."

Saying this, Elder Tong led Chu Ning out of the room, then told Chu Ning to wait while he entered another room. After a short while, Elder Tong reappeared, holding another bracelet-like object.

"I saw that you just took an Earth Spirit Bracelet, so I might as well give you this Blazing Flame Bracelet too." Elder Tong handed the dark-red bracelet to Chu Ning, explaining, "This bracelet has two magic arrays. If spiritual energy is injected into one, it can unleash ten fire blades with decent destructive power. If you encounter an enemy at close quarters, you can also directly inject spiritual energy into the other array to condense and unleash a stream of blazing flames to scorch the enemy, which will have even greater destructive power."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning felt greatly satisfied. "Thank you, Elder. I will take this one."

Elder Tong accepted Chu Ning's bow, then directly returned to where he was originally sitting. Chu Ning then took his leave.

Downstairs, Chu Ning saw Gu Xiaoqing, Shen Zhengquan, and Lu Miaoying also downstairs, along with a few other people Chu Ning did not recognize.

"Alright, he's come down. The first one of you who arrived can go up now," the lazy young man said casually after seeing Chu Ning.

Shen Zhengquan heard this and walked up to the second floor. Gu Xiaoqing continued to wait, then smiled at Chu Ning. "Junior Brother Chu came quite early, otherwise, you'd have to wait here like us."

Only then did Chu Ning realize he was the first to arrive, so he smiled and said, "It was just a coincidence. Senior Sister Gu, I have other places to go, so I'll take my leave first." Saying this, Chu Ning also greeted Lu Miaoying, then left the Treasury Pavilion.

Yesterday, Chu Ning hadn't found Liao Yunming and He Changyou. He still needed to look for them today. Since this place was close to the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning naturally walked in that direction.

Entering the Spirit Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning immediately saw Liao Yunming holding a book. He quickly walked over and bowed. "Steward Liao!"

Liao Yunming looked up, and upon seeing Chu Ning, a smile appeared on his face. "Ah, it's Chu Ning. Come, come. I heard you were back, and I guessed you might come over, so I specifically waited for you here this morning."

Chu Ning was slightly surprised to hear Liao Yunming's words. Before he could speak, Liao Yunming had already started. "I heard you did well in Yanji Market, even breaking through to the fifth layer of Qi Condensation! The low-grade mid-quality talismans you produced had even better sales than those from Wind Gorge Market. And this time, you even killed several Yin Demon Sect disciples! Good! Very good! This truly brought honor to our Spirit Talisman Pavilion, and indeed, to the Spirit Plant Chamber too."

As he spoke, Liao Yunming took out several talismans from his storage bag.

"I heard you damaged your defensive magic tool when you encountered the Yin Demon Sect disciples this time. The sect must have given you compensation, right? Well, the pavilion has also prepared several different defensive talismans for you." Liao Yunming took out the talismans one by one, introducing each as he did so. "Look, earth-attributed, fire-attributed, water-attributed... defensive talismans of every attribute are here, and none of them are recorded in the standard talisman catalog. These low-grade high-quality talismans will absolutely increase your defensive capabilities."

Chu Ning watched Liao Yunming, who seemed afraid he would speak, with a slightly stunned expression, his gaze subtly shifting. "Could this steward be afraid that I'd ask him for something? But these are just low-grade high-quality talismans; isn't that a bit too stingy? The ones he drew aren't even as good as mine."
