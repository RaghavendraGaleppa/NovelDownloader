# Chapter 47: The True Power of the Divine Weapon and a Trip to the Scripture Pavilion

Ying Bing knew there was a Divine Weapon in the Divine Blade Cave.

In fact, she only knew about it because of Shang Wu.

When the Clear Abyss Sect was on the verge of destruction, Shang Wu paid a great price to pick up that Pan Jie Meteor Hammer.

Later, when Ying Bing went to the Central Divine Continent, she also saw several Divine Weapons that were no less impressive than the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer.

But in the end, none of them ever gave her that feeling of boundless, immense power again.

That's right.

Even with her perspective, Divine Weapons were not common items.

A Divine Weapon was two full levels above a Xuan Artifact.

It was the ultimate embodiment of the forging path, the ceiling that humanity could reach with its skills and craftsmanship.

What lay beyond that?

That would be Dao Weapons, which seize the transformations of heaven and earth and are born with the flow of destiny.

For example, the ‘Mountain and River Seal’ held by the emperors of the Great Yu Dynasty.

Speaking of which.

She remembered that in her previous life, the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer had no master.

Shang Wu had barely managed to activate it once. After a brief, dazzling appearance, both she and the hammer vanished without a trace.

When Ying Bing had just taken charge of the Moon Palace, she had inquired about this matter.

But she only got some vague, unreliable rumors that were hard to verify.

"Elder Shang Wu... Hm?"

There was no answer from across the table for a long time.

When Ying Bing looked up, she discovered that at some point, Shang Wu had fallen asleep on the rocking chair, even letting out soft, even snores.

Not long after.

"Roast lamb."

Li Mo came out with the prepared lamb. He placed it on the rack and started the fire.

The young man's face was illuminated by the warm light of the flames.

It was also reflected in Ying Bing's cold, clear eyes.

Could it be... that this has something to do with him?

At that time, the Nine-Colored Phoenix's soul seemed to have taken a special liking to him as well...

"Give me a hand."

Just then, a brush was handed to her by the young man.

Ying Bing tilted her head in confusion.

But Li Mo brought over a clay pot, from which a pungent, spicy aroma wafted.

Ying Bing understood.

He wanted her to brush the sauce onto the lamb.

"This is my specially crafted 'Soul Sauce'."

"A glutton would eat it and not be able to stop talking. I'll leave it to you."

As he spoke, Li Mo slowly began to turn the grill.

Thus.

The Empress Ying Bing narrowed her eyes, her gaze shifting slightly.

In the end, she took the brush, dipped it in the so-called 'Soul Sauce,' and began her first-ever cooking experience.

Later, Little Li Mo干脆 simply handed the task of turning the grill over to her as well.

Before long.

The roast lamb was sizzling with oil.

Watching Ying Bing from a distance as she carefully applied the sauce, her expression carrying a hint of seriousness, Li Mo couldn't help but smile.

When the ice cube cooks, she gains a bit of mortal, worldly warmth. She's not so cold anymore.

"Maybe in the future, I can achieve full automation when it comes to feeding the ice cube?"

But.

Little Li Mo quickly changed his mind.

"What's that smell?"

While preparing the side dishes, Li Mo smelled something burnt.

He turned around and found that the perfectly good lamb had fallen victim to her skills.

One side of the lamb was burnt to a crisp, while the other side was still raw.

The young woman was still turning the lamb, seemingly completely unaware that anything was wrong.

Li Mo: "..."

He looked at Ying Bing with a helpless, amused expression.

*No way, Sister, it's burnt.*

*You're still furiously roasting the burnt side?*

Sensing his gaze, Ying Bing looked back at him calmly.

"What's wrong?"

She asked with perfect confidence.

Alright.

The ice cube does have her shortcomings. For instance, in this life, she has basically no connection to the kitchen.

"I'll do it, I'll do it."

...

After finishing this meal—which could be considered either breakfast or dinner—the sky had already brightened.

Inside the room.

"Master's meal was worth five hundred taels of gold? Far exceeding the value of that jar of Green Bamboo Brew."

"The ice cube's feedback was even more fragrant..."

Lying on the bed, Li Mo took the rare opportunity to count his money.

Eight Xuan Crystals.

He already had over ten thousand taels of gold.

Silver... he couldn't be bothered to count it. He had plenty of silver and silver bills; counting them would be tedious.

---

He also had a few miscellaneous precious items.

Various six-patterned pills, minerals, and rare flowers and herbs.

"Dispelling Filth Pill, can neutralize a hundred poisons."

"Summon Wind and Rain Talisman? Can make it rain for three days. I probably won't need it for now."

"Ancient Pine Ring, looks exquisite and grand. It can serve as a decoration to increase my prestige..."

It took him about half an hour.

Li Mo finally finished sorting through the miscellaneous items.

Then he entered the World Seed.

Compared to when he left, there were some changes here.

The area seemed to be a few zhang larger than before.

In front of the empty ground's chessboard, the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer hung silently.

Not far from the hammer, the Chixiao Sword huddled in a corner, not daring to approach.

*Hum—*

Sensing Li Mo's arrival, the hammer trembled slightly twice.

The sharp, killing intent of a weapon was still there.

But it could no longer exert any pressure on Li Mo.

After all, he was the master of this place.

"Limitless Strength," Li Mo silently recited.

He then walked over and grabbed the hammer's handle, actually lifting it up with one hand.

Effortlessly.

He couldn't even feel any weight.

If not for the joyful emotion transmitted by the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer, one would think this Divine Weapon had been swapped for a fake.

*Whoosh—*

Li Mo swung it a couple of times.

Instantly, the fierce, sharp, killing intent caused the winds and clouds within the small world to change, as if the heavens were enraged.

One hammer strike down, truly like a meteor falling to the earth, carrying infinite power.

At this moment, he seemed like a god capable of shattering the earth and sky.

In Li Mo's current understanding, Elder Han He was already a very powerful existence.

He had a feeling.

The hammer wind he could stir up now, even just a sliver at its very edge,恐怕 would be something Elder Han He couldn't withstand.

"Truly worthy of being a Divine Weapon."

"This is its true power."

Li Mo let out a long breath.

The Pan Jie Meteor Hammer hummed incessantly, growing even more excited. It seemed it had not been used to its full potential for a long time.

"Want... to go out..."

Vaguely.

Li Mo seemed to hear a childish voice.

Was it the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer?

He lowered his head and confirmed the source of the sound.

"Fight..."

He understood what this Divine Weapon meant.

It wanted to smash something.

Be it people or exotic beasts.

As long as it wasn't used to forge other weapons.

Li Mo: "..."

*I want to too.*

*But my strength doesn't allow it.*

*Hum—*

The Pan Jie Meteor Hammer felt a bit wronged. Its faint intelligence couldn't understand such complex matters.

Why was its master sometimes strong and sometimes weak?

Why, if its master could unleash its power to the fullest, wouldn't he take it out to play?

"When the time is right, I will surely let you shine brilliantly," Li Mo comforted it softly.

After pacifying the Divine Weapon, he began to seriously think.

"I already have a Divine Weapon hammer."

"Should I... also go look for a hammer technique?"

Having experienced the power of a Divine Weapon, Li Mo felt a hint of longing.

*I'm a swordsman, but it's perfectly reasonable for me to know a thing or two about hammer techniques, right?*

But among the investment feedback he had received, there really wasn't any martial art related to hammer techniques.

"That's right."

"The first place in the sect trial can go to the fifth floor of the Scripture Pavilion to choose a martial art, right?"

"Let's go take a look."

With this thought in mind.

Li Mo restored the small world to its messy state and waved his hand at the Chixiao Sword in the distance.

"Come here."

*Hum—*

The moment he spoke, the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer trembled twice, like a father disciplining a mischievous child.

Only then did the Chixiao Sword slowly fall into his palm.

Taking the sword, Li Mo exited the World Seed.

He said a few words to the half-asleep Shang Wu and then headed out toward the Scripture Pavilion.
