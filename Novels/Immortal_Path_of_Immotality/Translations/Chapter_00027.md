# Chapter 27: Borrowing Power from the Mighty

Lin Shan had just returned to the third-floor exchange hall when Manager Jiang hurried over to meet him. The old man looked visibly relieved, nearly blurting out "Thank goodness you're alive," as he patted Lin Shan's shoulder and muttered reproachfully.

"If I'd known you'd be so reckless, this old bones would never have agreed to take you up there. Youth these days..."

Without wasting words, Lin Shan pulled out the Guardian Token and waved it before the old man's eyes.

"???"

Manager Jiang's eyes nearly popped out of his head. "A Guardian Token? How in the world did you get this? Are you Guardian Jiang's long-lost son or something?"

Lin Shan rolled his eyes in exasperation. "Keep your voice down! If you want to die young, don't drag me with you. The Guardian lent this to me temporarily to get two copies of Xiantian-level techniques from you."

It took Manager Jiang a while to process this. He looked at Lin Shan with a complicated expression—this kid always managed to surprise him, or more accurately, give him heart attacks. Remembering how the youth had killed the notorious Fat Li at such a young age, the old man muttered "The younger generation is formidable" as he turned to retrieve the manuals from the vault.

After a short wait, Lin Shan took the copied Xiantian techniques from Manager Jiang and stuffed them into his robe without examining them closely. As he turned to leave, the old man called after him, "Memorize them thoroughly before burning the copies! Don't let anyone else see them!"

"Got it!"

"That kid..." The old man shook his head with a smile. Though unfathomable at times, the impetuousness of youth still needed tempering.

Wait a minute—the manuals were given, but shouldn't the Guardian Token be returned? Why did he take that too? Manager Jiang rushed to the stairway, but Lin Shan was already gone.

At an antique shop in the western district, crowds came and went, most drawn by the recently unearthed golden bell from the Yelang ancient tomb. A white-robed youth carrying a bundle entered—none other than Lin Shan, who had returned home after leaving the Nightingale organization to retrieve some antiques before coming here.

Shopkeeper Huang, who had served Lin Shan before, glanced over and immediately lost interest upon recognizing him. Last time this kid had only looked without buying, shattering the shopkeeper's initial favorable impression.

Undeterred, Lin Shan approached the counter directly. "Shopkeeper, I have some big business for you."

"Oh? What kind of big business?" The shopkeeper continued fiddling with his abacus without looking up.

Seeing he was being ignored, Lin Shan had no choice but to take out a vase from his bundle and place it right under the man's nose. "Here, take a look first."

"Move that—wait, what's this...?" The shopkeeper's attention was instantly captured by the unusual vase—its unique shape, flowing curves, elegant patterns, and long-lost craftsmanship.

"This is an antique from the Yelang Kingdom a thousand years ago!" The shopkeeper reached out eagerly to cradle it, only for the vase to suddenly vanish from his grasp.

"Who—who took it?" Shopkeeper Huang cried out frantically, drawing curious looks from other customers and attendants.

"Had enough of a look? Shall we find somewhere quiet to talk?" came Lin Shan's amused voice from beside him.

Realizing his lapse, the shopkeeper quickly composed himself and gestured obsequiously. "Young master, please come inside!"

---

In the private room, Shopkeeper Huang cradled the vase with drunken delight, his face flushed as if intoxicated by fine summer wine. He even began making strange noises until Lin Shan, unable to bear it any longer, coughed several times to no avail before resorting to shaking the man awake. Then he emptied his bundle, spilling over a dozen antiques onto the table.

"So many?" The shopkeeper was astonished. After examining each piece, he pointed shakily at the collection. "Young master, are you planning to..."

"Do business."

Lin Shan leaned back with an air of nonchalance.

"This is beyond my authority. Let me fetch the owner who backs our shop so you can discuss directly." Knowing this was too big for him to handle, the shopkeeper hastily arranged tea for Lin Shan before rushing out.

---

After about half an hour, a hearty voice sounded outside. "I wondered who was bringing such business to our shop—a most distinguished young master! Haha, I'm surnamed Zhao. People honor me as Master Zhao. And how may I address you?"

"This humble one is Lin Shan. You honor me too much."

"The pleasure is mine. Please, be seated!"

The two exchanged pleasantries like long-lost friends, carefully avoiding any mention of the antiques on the table. Eventually, the younger Lin Shan broke first. "I've come today to arrange the sale of these artifacts recently unearthed from the Yelang tomb."

Master Zhao nodded—Shopkeeper Huang had already briefed him. While his family could certainly afford these antiques (who in Nan Kingdom hadn't heard of Master Zhao?), as chief advisor to the Zangke County governor and head of the prestigious Zhao family—himself a renowned top-tier martial artist—he first wanted to probe Lin Shan's background regarding how he'd acquired them.

When Lin Shan evaded these questions, Master Zhao shifted to inquiring about the youth's origins. This was the opening Lin Shan had been waiting for. Sitting up straight, he produced the Guardian Token from his robe.

"Actually, I'm just running errands for Guardian Jiang. Please examine this."

He didn't specify which Guardian Jiang, knowing Master Zhao's connections would fill in the blanks. After interrogating Squire Wu that night, Lin Shan had secretly investigated the antique shop's backer. As expected, Master Zhao hesitated before asking, "Guardian Jiang of the Nightingale organization?"

"Exactly."

Master Zhao nodded, returning the token. This made sense—he'd never believed a mere Houtian-stage youth could retrieve so many artifacts from that dangerous tomb. His own family's expedition after acquiring the golden bell from Squire Wu had ended disastrously, and he'd later posted Nightingale missions to explore the tomb.

If Guardian Jiang (a half-step Xiantian expert, among the county's strongest—his own Zhao family lacked even a full Xiantian master) had obtained these artifacts, the story held together.

---

After more conversation, Lin Shan steered the discussion back to appraising the antiques. Master Zhao, deeply knowledgeable as the shop's financier, soon quoted a staggering price.

"Three thousand taels of gold. Does this suit you, young friend?"

Lin Shan's initial elation quickly gave way to doubt—as an amateur, he couldn't gauge the fairness of this offer for artifacts won through life-risking effort in the tomb. Noticing his hesitation, Master Zhao chuckled.

"Since we've hit it off, I'll add a personal gift—another hundred taels of gold for your trouble as courier."

Still believing the artifacts belonged to Guardian Jiang with Lin Shan merely as messenger (albeit one with authority to sell), Master Zhao sweetened the deal to ensure cooperation. Lin Shan immediately realized the initial quote was below market value, but with suspicions to avoid, he played along.

"Deal."

Master Zhao's wealth proved formidable—within moments, a maid presented a tray of silver notes. Lin Shan took only ten hundred-tael notes (equivalent to one hundred taels of gold at 10:1 exchange), pushing the rest back with a smile.

"Young friend, this is...?" Master Zhao looked thoughtful.

"Guardian Jiang is quite interested in that golden bell from the same tomb. Might Master Zhao part with it?" Lin Shan smiled.

Though suspecting hidden significance (his own studies of the bell had revealed nothing), Master Zhao agreed—selling it for three thousand taels while currying favor with Guardian Jiang was worthwhile.

Lin Shan finally relaxed internally. Borrowing Guardian Jiang's authority had kept him on edge—without backing from a major power, he'd have been swallowed whole. Master Zhao's cooperation stemmed entirely from that borrowed prestige.

---

At the shop entrance, they bid farewell. The conspicuous golden bell would require a carriage to transport discreetly to Lin Shan's residence—a service Master Zhao arranged, unlikely to renege with Guardian Jiang's influence in play.

Lin Shan then hurried to the Nightingale branch at Jing'an Residence, returning the Guardian Token to Manager Jiang for proper return. With this weight off his shoulders, he strolled home leisurely.

Two Xiantian manuals. Sixteen points of Ancient Charm. Enough to enhance two Qi Condensation cultivation manuals.

Whether he could truly cultivate immortality—it all came down to this.
