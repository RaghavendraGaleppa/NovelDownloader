## Chapter 54: The Swift Knife King

Outside the grand hall, the cold wind howled. Paopao, feeling chilly, ran in with its rear end sticking out, crouched beside Li Zhiming to warm up by the fire, and soon fell asleep on the ground, with one foot from each of them snuggled under its belly for warmth.

A hot pot was placed on a stove, with Li Zhiming and Han Li eating with great relish, their faces dripping with sweat. Two pairs of chopsticks were busily scooping out bamboo rat meat from the pot. Today, Paopao had brought back one of its pets, which didn't seem too healthy. Li Zhiming decided to cook it.

As they were about to finish the last piece of meat, a pair of chopsticks from across the table swiftly snatched it. Li Zhiming's eyebrows furrowed, and he countered with a tap of his chopsticks, sending the meat sliding back into the pot.

The two then engaged in a fierce chopstick battle, with Li Zhiming eventually getting angry and shouting, "You unfilial son, I'm still growing!"

Han Li retorted, "I'm growing too!" The argument escalated, with the chopsticks clashing and the meat falling into the hot broth.

Just as they were going at it, a groan came from the entrance, where a stretcher was being carried in. Tong Huazhi, known as the Swift Knife King, slowly opened his eyes, having thought he was done for.

He had been on a mission to investigate a case involving a flower thief who had molested several respectable women in Qingyuan City, including the family members of a prefect. After setting a trap, he had caught the culprit but was gravely injured in the ensuing fight due to the thief's dirty tricks.

Li Zhiming and Han Li, still arguing, turned around upon hearing the groan and saw Tong Huazhi standing up, having recovered from his near-death state. They awkwardly put down their chopsticks.

Tong Huazhi, with a serious expression, attempted to bow to Li Zhiming, acknowledging him as the little divine doctor of the Seven Mystic Gate. Li Zhiming downplayed his abilities, attributing his recovery to the medicine from his own Medicine Valley.

As Li Zhiming and Han Li continued their argument over the remaining meat, Tong Huazhi was invited to join them for a meal. Despite his initial hesitation, his hunger got the better of him, and he accepted.

After being served a bowl of porridge by Jiang Yun, a beautiful and elegant maid, Tong Huazhi felt a mix of gratitude and embarrassment. Li Zhiming, having treated his wounds, told him he could leave once he was fully recovered.

Upon hearing this, Tong Huazhi thanked Li Zhiming profusely, acknowledging that he owed his life to him. Li Zhiming, having grown accustomed to such gratitude, simply nodded and turned to leave, carrying a rabbit he had caught.

As Li Zhiming walked away, he caught a glimpse of Tong Huazhi's destiny grid, which was fully exposed to him. Li Zhiming was astonished to see that he could copy Tong's destiny, including his mastery of the "Yōumíng Dāo Fǎ" (Mysterious Darkness Blade Technique) and other skills.

This revelation struck Li Zhiming as he realized that he had never been able to copy someone's destiny so easily, not even with people he had known for years. The fact that he could do so with Tong Huazhi in just three days was astounding and made him ponder the implications.
