# Chapter 6: The Primordial Jade Wall

The man’s face paled, and just as he was about to speak, he saw Xu Yunfan advancing aggressively. He hurriedly unbuckled the饼子 (flatbread) and water pouch from his waist and fled without hesitation.

When the second man saw Xu Yunfan’s gaze fall upon him, his body trembled. Enduring the intense pain in his abdomen, he also unbuckled his rations and water, scrambling away on all fours.

He Changgong, whose face had been beaten into a swollen mess, quickly took out his food and water and set them down.

"Master Xu, please, let me go."

Looking at He Changgong, who had once been arrogant and even dared to argue with Jiang Yu, now kneeling and begging for mercy, a faint smile appeared on Xu Yunfan’s face.

"I remember you saying that I was short-sighted, a coward, and a lazy bum. You wanted Jiang Yu to execute me. Because of that, Jiang Yu nearly beat me to death when he returned, saying I had ruined his reputation."

A forced smile appeared on He Changgong’s swollen face. He had no recollection of this incident whatsoever; he had pulled similar stunts countless times.

"Master Xu, why bring up old grudges? You are the master now, and I will follow your lead."

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly. He picked up his iron pickaxe and walked over to Cui Ye, who was struggling on the ground. Meeting Cui Ye’s terrified gaze, Xu Yunfan’s expression remained cold. He raised the pickaxe and brought it down.

*Thud!*

The sound of the pickaxe tip piercing flesh echoed within the narrow mine tunnel, making everyone’s hearts skip a beat.

Cui Ye, who had been struggling just moments ago, fell silent instantly.

Xu Yunfan pulled the iron pickaxe out of Cui Ye’s body and walked up to He Changgong.

He Changgong, witnessing this scene, was so terrified he nearly wet himself. His lips trembled as he shrank back.

"Master Xu, spare me, Master Xu!"

Xu Yunfan’s face was calm. He stood right before He Changgong, looking down at him from above.

"Tell them this: from now on, you must deliver a portion of food and water to me every day. Otherwise, I will go from tunnel to tunnel, and for every one I find, I will kill."

"Yes, yes, yes!"

He Changgong’s heart eased slightly. He knelt on the ground and kowtowed rapidly like捣蒜 (pounding garlic).

"Get out."

Upon hearing this, He Changgong scrambled to his feet and fled the mine tunnel in a panic.

Li Haomiao, who had been watching everything quietly from the corner, maintained a calm expression.

"If you hadn't killed them, you would have had some trouble in the future."

"If I killed them all, where would I get the food and water to sustain myself? If I relied only on those few flatbreads, I’d work myself to death without making any progress."

Li Haomiao’s expression became slightly subtle. He nodded slightly.

"These people are nothing but clay chickens and mud dogs. Their character is terrible; after being frightened like that, they are terrified out of their wits. They will most likely obey. I misjudged you; I didn't expect a mere servant to think so far ahead and not lose himself after gaining a bit of strength."

Xu Yunfan glanced at Li Haomiao.

"Everyone says the Prince of Yan is benevolent and unparalleled, generous and charitable. But back then, these few scourges in Yujing harmed the common people quite severely."

Li Haomiao fell silent for a moment. "Some things, some people, require mutual checks and balances to maintain stability and ensure the safety of the vast majority. If those people die, the balance is broken. I intended to settle the score later, but I didn't expect that witch to strike suddenly..."

At this point, Li Haomiao stopped talking, his expression filled with desolation. He had sacrificed too much and done too much for this.

Xu Yunfan’s face showed no emotion as he silently loaded the ore into the mine cart.

*You used the Copper Body Technique to exert force and successfully killed a man with the iron pickaxe. Copper Body Technique proficiency has increased.*

*While circulating the Copper Body Technique, you successfully dodged a fatal blow. Copper Body Technique proficiency has increased.*

"..."

Glancing at the skill notifications in his field of vision, Xu Yunfan was a bit surprised. It seemed that fighting against others was much more efficient for improving martial arts than labor.

Time passed unknowingly in the mine. The torches on the mine walls had gone out three times. He Changgong and the others had delivered food and water three times. Xu Yunfan had also traded several carts of high-quality ore for ample water and food.

Rather than becoming emaciated from the heavy labor, he had grown even stronger.

*Copper Body Technique 132/500 (Entry Level)*

*Special Effect: Initial surplus of Qi and Blood, Qi flows through the whole body, Strength gathers in the meridians, Can withstand light impacts without injury.*

Xu Yunfan sat on the ground, munching on a flatbread, looking at the proficiency of the Copper Body Technique in his vision. It felt incredibly satisfying.

He only needed to persist a little longer, and this martial art would reach the Minor Accomplishment realm. Moreover, his mining skill had also seen a significant increase in proficiency.

It was similar to gaining proficiency in a video game, with the benefit of "once proven, forever proven," making him addicted and unable to stop.

He swallowed the flatbread in his mouth in a few bites, feeling unsatisfied.

Next to him, Li Haomiao said, "It's a pity. If you had enough meat and medicinal supplements, with your aptitude, you could have reached the Minor Accomplishment of this martial art within three months."

He watched Xu Yunfan’s changes every day. Now, wielding the iron pickaxe was as smooth as flowing clouds and water. Every time the pickaxe fell, powered by the Copper Body Technique, it was like a heavy hammer, possessing immense might.

It could be said he had already grasped a fraction of the technique.

Xu Yunfan didn't mind much. He took a large gulp of water, stood up, and began swinging the pickaxe again.

Before long, a sound like pearls and jade falling onto metal rang out abruptly.

*Ding!*

The sound was crisp, melodious, and echoed endlessly.

Li Haomiao, hearing this sound, changed his expression drastically, looking both excited and somewhat disbelieving.

"What is that?"

Xu Yunfan looked at a corner of a jade wall that had appeared before him.

Deep in the excavated mine tunnel, a corner of a jade wall was exposed. It was extremely peculiar. Just looking at it, an aura of antiquity and vicissitudes, having traversed a long river of time, rushed toward them.

The sedimentation of time and a mysterious charm, as if containing endless life force. Beneath the mottled surface of the jade wall, a faint light flickered, vaguely revealing a divine and unusual aura.

Xu Yunfan shuddered, retreating several steps in succession, quickly moving behind Haomiao.

Li Haomiao: "..."

Li Haomiao took a breath. Although he tried his best to maintain a calm expression, he couldn't hide the excitement in his eyes. He slowly moved closer, raising his remaining left hand to touch the corner of the jade wall. His expression could no longer suppress his agitation.

"This should be the Primordial Jade Wall. Legend says that if one is buried within it, after endless years, one can shed the physical body and ascend to immortality."

"...Really?"

Ascension to immortality—who wouldn't want that?

If one could truly become an immortal in this world, he naturally wanted to pursue it.

It took a long time for Li Haomiao to calm his emotions. He stared at the Primordial Jade Wall with a subtle expression. He sighed and shook his head slightly.

"It's a pity, the timing is wrong. There are records in the Great Zhou's inner treasury: to bury oneself in the Primordial Jade Wall, one must enter a state between life and death. The timing, the location, and the celestial phenomena must all align perfectly. Then, using a secret medicine to coat the entire body to induce the jade wall to liquefy, one can enter it to slumber. Subsequently, one draws upon the secret energies of the world to wash the body, beginning the ascension ceremony."

Li Haomiao stepped aside.

"Keep digging and see what else is there."

Xu Yunfan: "Won't we dig up some great evil?"

"It shouldn't be. Even if we do, it would be dead. The timing isn't right."

He stared intently at the jade wall emitting a faint green light, wanting to see through it.
