Chapter 91: Golden Crow Blood, the Beginning of the Wujian Trial, and Zuo Qiu Yang

Several days passed quickly.

During this time, Little Li's daily routine became quite regular.

In the mornings, he attended his master's combat training sessions. Although he still couldn't withstand Shang Wu's "intent," he managed to endure for longer periods, and even developed a sort of "sixth sense" that seemed to guide him.

This newfound sense made his nighttime dual cultivation with Bing Tuozzi more effective.

As they practiced "Phoenix Cry Heavenly Marsh" together, Li Mo discovered that their progress was nothing short of astonishing.

Originally, even after achieving unity with heaven, he needed to absorb heavenly and earthly energies to transform them into his own "qi."

With Bing Tuozzi by his side, this process became more than ten times faster.

The combination of unity with heaven, spiritual elixirs, his master's brutal training, and dual cultivation with Bing Tuozzi propelled Li Mo's progress in the Internal Energy Condensation Realm at an incredible speed, akin to riding a rocket.

However, there was some bad news.

Li Mo had initially misjudged the time required to achieve his goal.

His dantian's capacity was too strong, akin to a sea that could contain hundreds of rivers. What he thought would take ten days to a month now seemed to require more effort.

Little Li wasn't anxious, though. After all, the process of cultivation was still quite enjoyable.

Meanwhile, in the World Seed, Jiang Chu Long was busy practicing her tree-branch-wielding skills.

The Primordial Heavenly Venerable, Yuan Shi Tian Zun, took out a crystal bottle containing a few drops of light golden liquid. These droplets didn't mix together; instead, they burned with distinct, gorgeous flames, releasing a warm glow.

"This is Golden Crow Blood," Yuan Shi Tian Zun explained with a gentle smile, as if it were a trivial matter.

"Teacher, this little bean... it's so warm," Jiang Chu Long said, crouching beside him, her eyes sparkling with the reflected flames.

Jiang Chu Long then shared a story about her past. She used to sneak out of the Cold Palace and once saw a black three-legged bird pecking at the statue of the founding emperor in the ancestral hall. When the bird was caught and killed, its blood resembled the Golden Crow Blood in the crystal bottle.

Li Mo realized that the bird Jiang Chu Long saw was likely not a true Golden Crow but had a trace of its bloodline. A true Golden Crow could transform into a great sun.

Jiang Chu Long looked thoughtful, then puzzled, and asked, "But isn't the sun... the founding emperor?"

This question fell into Li Mo's knowledge blind spot. Historical records did state that the founding emperor transformed into the sun with his body, but the truth behind this remained unclear.

Jiang Chu Long didn't dwell on the question for long. She took out a sachet she had made herself and offered it to Yuan Shi Tian Zun.

The sachet was made of decent material, stitched neatly without any embroidery. Jiang Chu Long was hesitant, not daring to look at her teacher's expression.

"I made it myself," she said. "I learned from the palace maids."

Yuan Shi Tian Zun was surprised. "You can do this?"

Jiang Chu Long nodded. "Yes, I bought the materials."

She explained that she had been finding various items like knives and swords in fixed locations every day. Yuan Shi Tian Zun was puzzled but soon understood that the Wujian Trial had begun.

Jiang Chu Long had been waiting for people to fight and kill each other, then cleaning up the battlefield and burying the losers.

Li Mo was taken aback. He hadn't expected Jiang Chu Long's "hobby" to evolve into something like this.

Yuan Shi Tian Zun decided to teach Jiang Chu Long a technique to conceal her aura for safety.

"When will Brother Li return?" Jiang Chu Long asked, a question she had been asking every day.

"Today," Yuan Shi Tian Zun replied.

As they prepared to head to Zi Yang Mansion City, Li Mo, Bing Tuozzi, and Shang Wu set off together.

At a relay station about a hundred miles away from Zi Yang Mansion City, a torrential rain was pouring down. The atmosphere inside the station was lively, with people drinking and chatting.

A young man wearing a bamboo hat and carrying a broken sword sat in the corner, occasionally glancing at the door. He was waiting for someone.

The old man beside him, Qian Xing Wu Zun, grumbled about the "Fine Rain Building," a group of notorious assassins.

"Fine Rain Building has thirty-six Heavenly Killers, seventy-two Earthly Fiends, and three hundred sixty Man Slaughterers, not to mention countless unranked killers," Qian Xing Wu Zun explained.

The young man, Xiao Qin, asked if their assassinations ever failed.

Qian Xing Wu Zun replied, "Failure means you didn't pay enough. They'll ask you to pay more."

Just then, a figure burst into the station, dripping with blood. He sat down across from Xiao Qin and ordered a bowl of beef noodles.

The atmosphere in the station turned deadly silent. The bloodied man didn't touch his food, saying, "I don't eat beef."

The station erupted into chaos. The waiters, customers, and even the grooms were revealed to be killers, attacking the bloodied man.

Xiao Qin watched in surprise. "It seems I'm the only non-killer here," he thought.

The bloodied man, Zuo Qiu Yang, was targeted by everyone. "Zuo Qiu Yang, today is your death day!" they shouted.

The scene was set for a bloody confrontation.
