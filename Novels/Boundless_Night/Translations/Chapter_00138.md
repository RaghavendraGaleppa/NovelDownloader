# Chapter 138: Entering the Legends

In the spacious hall, numerous crystal lamps were pure and flawless, each containing a sunstone, reflecting dazzling light.

At the Qingtan wood table, acquaintances and old friends drank wine and reminisced about the past. Jade cups glowed with a warm luster under the fiery glow, and the fragrant wine reflected colorful light and shadow.

Sharing drinks and laughter, they recalled the past and discussed the future. Time flowed like water; the faces were still familiar, yet not entirely as they were back then.

The youths had all matured, their cups raised with a mix of worldliness and stories. Even the once-naïve maidens were now graceful and refined.

Qin Ming, slightly tipsy, stepped out to see off his old friends.

Meng Xinghai, also smelling of alcohol, waved goodbye to a group of acquaintances, whether genuinely or feigned.

Upon returning, Qin Ming's tipsiness gradually faded, and his eyes regained their clarity. He was ready to study the *Yi Wood Scripture* and the *Everlasting World Scripture*, eager to improve his strength.

In the Night Fog World, personal strength was the foundation for everything.

Meng Xinghai said, "Don't be so quick to practice. You should find some experienced old monsters on the path of Rebirth to study it with. If a cultivation method has flaws, it can easily lead to serious problems."

Qin Ming nodded, saying, "I'll just browse it roughly."

In fact, he had some confidence in judging whether a scripture was authentic. This was because the hand-copied manuscript, filled with the scent of ink, carried strong emotional fluctuations.

Soon, Qin Ming realized it was Cui He's "resentment." Old Fourth Cui didn't want others to see the cultivation method he practiced, so he copied it himself.

"This *Yi Wood Scripture* indeed has some flaws. Although the defects aren't obvious, practicing it this way would certainly make it difficult to achieve perfection." Qin Ming corrected it himself, resonating with the correct sections of the scripture.

Cultivation methods of unknown origin certainly couldn't be practiced carelessly. The *Everlasting World Scripture* also had some issues, which Qin Ming manually corrected. Not only that, but he also resonated with an additional page of scripture from Cui He's "resentment," turning it from six pages into seven.

Unfortunately, Old Fourth Cui's various negative emotions far outweighed his thoughts on the scripture.

Qin Ming studied the *Everlasting World Scripture* and found it profound. His current cultivation realm wasn't high enough to practice it yet; it required him to first master the *Yi Wood Scripture*.

He could feel that this scripture was extraordinary, offering unique insights into extending life, renewing vitality, and maintaining one's peak state. Although it didn't cover as many areas as the *Fate Altering Scripture*, it had similarities. Perhaps in the future, they could be mutually verified and practiced in combination.

Three days later, Qin Ming discovered that his jet-black hair was tinged with a hint of green. His face stiffened instantly. "Will I glow green like Cui He when I circulate my energy in the future?" he wondered.

He tried to integrate it with the Silk Script Method, and found that his unified Tian Guang Strength had no issues, which made him sigh of relief.

"It's been a while since I returned from Mount Luofu. Once my body has fully recovered, I can consider my seventh Rebirth!" Qin Ming was full of anticipation. Each physical transformation significantly boosted his strength.

He was evaluating his Tian Guang Strength. He had once fought Cui Chongxuan, who practiced the Six Imperial Strength, back when he had just mastered the *Li Fire Scripture* and *Golden Silkworm Scripture*.

"When I mastered two wondrous arts, my Tian Guang Strength underwent a qualitative change, allowing me to suppress Cui Chongxuan, who had only mastered 'One Imperial Strength'. And according to him, in the Rebirth domain, a gifted individual of the Six Imperial lineage is only considered qualified after mastering 'Two Imperial Strengths'."

Qin Ming pondered, "If that's the case, then in the Rebirth stage, I must master at least four wondrous arts to not be weaker than the legendary strength methods!"

Of course, this was just the most simplistic superposition. He hadn't considered the issues of fusion and conflict between various wondrous arts.

He had exchanged the *Li Fire Scripture* with Xiang Yiwu, a disciple of the Ru Lai Sect, for the *Wu Ji Scripture*, and now he had obtained the *Yi Wood Scripture*, already gathering four wondrous arts.

As for the *Fate Altering Scripture*, it was a miraculous book for extending life and improving innate talent, probably not offering much additive effect to Tian Guang Strength.

"Ning Siqi came through for me when I needed it most, traveling thousands of miles to bring me the *Li Fire Scripture*. It helped me tremendously," Qin Ming murmured. "Without the *Li Fire Scripture*, I wouldn't have gotten the *Wu Ji Scripture*, and my transformation in the Mountain River Spiritual Nest wouldn't have been so complete."

Next, he actively practiced the *Yi Wood Scripture*, preparing for his next Rebirth.

Qin Ming had won twenty consecutive matches, already meeting the requirements to enter the Six Imperials. He could go there to undergo the trials. Meng Xinghai found someone to retrieve his "Golden Scroll" for him.

Not long ago, he was still busily traveling, fighting against the "first" practitioners from different cities to qualify. Now he held two "Golden Scrolls" and was suffering from choice paralysis.

Meng Xinghai said, "From what I understand, this time, the Six Imperials, Sky Pillar, Jade Purity, and other Daoist traditions have all loosened their new disciple admission standards. Even non-gifted individuals can compete for core disciple positions. It's said that this is because people with inverse aptitude can develop later, or find ways to improve their foundational bones and alter their innate talents."

Qin Ming was surprised, saying, "These great ancestral grounds are all making moves, either releasing their top disciples into the world or rapidly expanding. They must all be preparing for the Great Era of Creation."

In recent days, Meng Xinghai had heard many rumors. The Beyond-the-world regions and Esoteric Sects were also actively recruiting top talents.

He handed some information to Qin Ming, saying, "Jade Purity, Sky Pillar, Six Imperials, these Daoist traditions all require two assessments to select their final core disciples. And each time there are benefits, attracting top prodigies to participate. The conditions of the several traditions are similar, seemingly having communicated with each other to avoid malicious competition."

Qin Ming humbly asked him which Daoist temple would be more suitable.

Old Meng also frowned, as it was genuinely hard to judge.

He sighed, "In this era of great expansion, the major Daoist traditions all seem to be in great need of gifted individuals and top prodigies, acting as if the more the merrier. I just worry that when the Great Era of Creation arrives in the future, some people might become cannon fodder. One must consider this carefully."

Moreover, some great sects had almost become family Daoist temples. If they were both core disciples, the allocation of resources would definitely have some preferential treatment; closeness and distance would matter.

Qin Ming said, "Looking at it this way, special high-level academies might not be bad either."

Meng Xinghai said, "Anyway, there's still time. Let's research it further."

The next day, he brought new news: the assessments for several powerful Daoist traditions were becoming clearer.

Meng Xinghai chuckled, "You can go 'shear the sheep' first, get the benefits, and then make your final decision!"

The initial assessments of Sky Pillar, Jade Purity, and Six Imperials would all provide some Tian Guang Strength methods, which were their unique secret scriptures, to test whether the enrolled geniuses were suited for their paths.

"Several Daoist traditions also said that their assessment locations contain extremely rare spiritual substances. Whether one can obtain them depends entirely on one's own strength. This is also considered a benefit for participants."

Qin Ming was about to undergo his seventh Rebirth, and hearing such news instantly moved him.

Meng Xinghai also smiled, saying, "The spiritual substances in the ancestral grounds of great sects are definitely much stronger than those outside. It's worth looking forward to. Don't risk running to the Thunder-Fire Alchemy Hall these days."

Qin Ming immediately nodded. Going to the legendary Daoist traditions to learn Tian Guang Strength methods and acquire spiritual substances, even if he didn't ultimately choose to stay there, it wouldn't be a loss.

He was genuinely curious about the ancestral grounds of the Six Imperials, Jade Purity, and Sky Pillar sects, wanting to delve deep and take a look. If he could mentally resonate with some of their scriptures, he'd gain immensely!

"When does it start?" Qin Ming asked, eager to go immediately.

Meng Xinghai informed him that he still had to wait a few more days. He took out six small cloth bags and handed them over, saying, "Here, these bags are all Fallen Fruits."

He knew that Qin Ming's foundation far surpassed ordinary people, and he was worried that the bag of Fallen Fruits won from Qi Daoming in the Chasing Light City might not be enough for his seventh Tian Guang Strength fusion.

Recently, he had made a fortune. Some of these Fallen Fruits were winnings from bets, others he had bought with Day Gold.

"Meng uncle and I won't say thank you," Qin Ming accepted them. He had already comprehended the *Yi Wood Scripture* and cultivated Shao Yang Strength, Dragon Claw Strength, Metal Severing Strength, Wind Fire Strength, and others. He was just waiting for his seventh Rebirth to use the Fallen Fruits for fusion.

The mother tree of the Fallen Fruit was rooted in the Tian Guang Pond, absorbing the essence of the otherworldly Tian Guang, almost condensing into a "liquid." Its "medicinal effect" was astonishing.

In the following days, Qin Ming actively "prepared for battle," making various preparations. Whenever he circulated the Yi Wood cultivation method slightly, his hair would be tinged with wisps of green.

Additionally, he asked Meng Xinghai for help in grinding some jade iron and exotic metals into weapons.

The Overlord's Spear had been dismantled by Li Qingyue. The essence within it was Black Jade Iron, not in large quantity. These fragments could be used to forge more than a dozen arrowheads.

Qin Ming felt that the mutton-fat jade iron saber, slightly shorter than his arm, was quite handy, so he didn't add Black Jade Iron to re-refine it this time.

Then, he solemnly took out a small piece of pure white, warm, jade-like exotic metal. At first glance, it resembled mutton-fat jade iron, but it was more restrained, containing an inexplicable divine charm.

The Immortal-proximate Eight Trigrams Furnace was cast from a mixture of various exotic metals, including this snow-white, jade-like exotic metal!

Qin Ming had dug out a handful from the bottom of the giant pit, but afterward, when the old monsters collected them, they only gave Li Qingyue two pieces, one purple and one white.

Now, he and Li Qingyue each had one piece of exotic metal.

Several days later, Qin Ming had twelve more jade iron arrows, though only the arrowheads were made of Black Jade Iron. They were dark and glossy like jade, but extremely dangerous.

In addition, he had a new pendant, thumb-length, pure white and crystalline, shaped like a small hiltless sword, also somewhat like a cone, with a very sharp tip.

Exotic metal weapons were priceless; even a small piece was hard to find. They could pierce Tian Guang Strength, spiritual consciousness, and divine wisdom. To block them would require extremely powerful means.

The reason it took several days this time was that polishing it was quite difficult. Relatively, the very rare Black Jade Iron was forged into arrowheads on the same day.

Meng Xinghai's eyes were a bit red with envy. He reminded Qin Ming, "This pendant is many times more precious than all the jade iron weapons on your person combined. Don't accidentally lose it."

Qin Ming laughed, "If Uncle Meng likes it, then take it."

Meng Xinghai shook his head, "What are you talking about? I'm an old man like this, why would I covet your things?"

In recent days, Qin Ming felt his body had fully recovered, and there would be no problem even if he underwent his seventh Rebirth immediately.

He eagerly anticipated entering the legendary great sect ancestral grounds.

Finally, there was the latest news: the Six Imperials would be the first to start assessing disciples.

"This is quite a coincidence. The Cui family wouldn't think I'm deliberately opposing them, would they?" Qin Ming began packing his belongings.

The Six Imperials Daoist tradition held a transcendent status. Its mountain gate was located within the Great Yu Dynasty, where no one dared to cause trouble around it, truly deterring all types of beings.

From Scarlet Cloud City to the Six Imperials' location was about fifteen thousand li.

This time, Li Qingyun personally appeared and used his own flying mount to transport him there.

Ahead, mountains rose and fell, shrouded in immortal mist, with spiritual light faintly visible. Each mountain peak resembled a dragon's head extending from underground.

Setting everything else aside, just the area around the Six Imperials' mountain gate was extraordinary.

Li Qingyun said, "Perform well. I hope you can seize some opportunities. It's said that if the Six Imperial Mind Scripture is cultivated to its final step, even the great figures from the Beyond-the-world regions will be wary."

He had already sent Old Fifth Cui back. He was tired of seeing that old face every day. Mainly, he had practically delivered Qin Ming into the Six Imperial Ancestral Grounds, so he didn't have much to worry about.

Qin Ming laughed, "Elder Li, please rest assured. Whether I ultimately stay here or not, I certainly won't bring shame to you."

Outside the Six Imperials' mountain gate, there were already many people, most of them young faces, all top prodigies who had traveled from various parts of the Night Fog World.

...

These past few days, Qin Ming's name had circulated within the smaller circles of millennium-old aristocratic families, causing particular distress to some members of the Cui family.

When they learned that Qin Ming had already entered the Six Imperial Ancestral Grounds, some people's expressions changed.

The next day, a core figure of the Cui family, and one of its actual power-wielders, Old Fifth Cui's elder brother, Cui Changqing, the Second Master of the Cui family, personally ascended to the Six Imperials' mountain gate.

He was a person from the Beyond-the-world region, exceptionally powerful. He also practiced the *Everlasting World Scripture* to extend his life, possessing long emerald green hair, a fair complexion without wrinkles, showing no signs of age.
