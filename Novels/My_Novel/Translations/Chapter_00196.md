Chapter 196: The Recipe of Essence Treasures, A Heart Moved to Mercy

The wind howled and snow screamed.

South of the Prefecture City, the official road was wide. After traveling dozens of miles, the path narrowed. It had long been left untended, full of potholes and muddy ground.

Winter arrived early in the Prefecture City. After the first snow, it snowed heavily for days on end. The snow along the road piled up like a blanket, gradually threatening to seal off the mountains.

The carriage traveled for about half a day. Entering a continuous mountain range, looking out, the mountain terrain stretched for over a hundred miles. Dangerous peaks and strange mountains were endless, with ancient, sturdy trees inside.

Roughly estimated, it would take four days to travel out of the mountains.

In the mountain path dotted with white and green, the White Clouds galloped past. The snow on the ground was already thick, but it left no footprints, truly strange.

The carriage was circular with a hip-and-gable roof, like a narrow room. Jade beads and silk ribbons hung from the carriage's edge, fluttering in the wind, its form unique.

Li Xian asked, "Shuyun? What is this? What is 'Shu'?"

"So-called 'Shu'..." Madam Wen said, "Is the authority granted by Heaven and Earth. There are thirty-six Heavenly Essences; swallowing them grants Heavenly Shu. There are seventy-two Earthly Glories; drinking them enlightens Earthly Shu."

Li Xian reasoned by analogy, saying, "Then, if one finds a way to consume the one hundred and eighty Human Yellows, they could also obtain Human Shu? If someone were to consume all the Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Essence Treasures, wouldn't they be omnipotent and all-powerful?"

Madam Wen said, "How difficult is it to find such Essence Treasures? And even if you obtain them, it does not guarantee you can comprehend Shu."

"You just spoke of gathering all the Heavenly, Earthly, and Human Essence Treasures; that is like a frog talking about the sky, making one laugh."

Li Xian gave an embarrassed smile.

Madam Wen said softly, "But speaking with me is fine. I am willing to teach you."

"Thank you, Madam," Li Xian said gratefully.

Madam Wen smiled lightly: "Heavenly Essences are rare in the world, whether true or false is unknown. Earthly Glories do exist, but hearing a slight whisper of them every hundred or several hundred years is already extremely fortunate. Whenever one appears, conflict is inevitable."

"Earthly Glories do contain Earthly Shu, but since ancient times, Earthly Glories have been shared among many heroes; it is rare for anyone to obtain a complete one."

"As for Human Yellow... although they appear from time to time. But look at the clans of the Prefecture City; they scheme for decades just to barely share a single Golden Scale. How difficult. And the Prefecture City clans are favored by Heaven, coincidentally having the Golden Scale fall into their pond. As long as they guard the pond, they can always obtain Golden Scales. Such a great thing only happens in this one place."

Li Xian said, "I see. Then, Madam... how does one obtain Shu?"

"Speaking of this, it involves the [Recipe]," Madam Wen said. "Anyone who has shared in Heavenly Essence, Earthly Glory, or Human Yellow has their own unique Recipe."

"A single Human Yellow Essence Treasure is not enough to obtain Shu. One must consume several, piecing together a unique Shu technique."

Li Xian asked, "Does Madam have a Recipe?"

"You," Madam Wen laughed lightly. "The matter of a Recipe is a great secret for martial artists; how can you ask directly? I have my own Recipe, but your cultivation is shallow, it is useless to tell you. Warm yourself up, go out and see if there is any situation. If nothing is wrong, come back in and massage me."

Li Xian nodded in agreement. He approached the stove, his whole body warm. His mind thought of the "Way of Shu," and he couldn't help but feel great longing. Madam Wen said, "You have just heard of the Way of Shu, it is inevitable to be moved. But I must warn you, the Way of Wushu is the foundation."

"Today we have leisure, and the journey is long. Let me tell you a story of the Jianghu, listen well."

Madam Wen said softly, "Long ago, there was a great thief of Heaven and Earth: Bu Jingfeng. This man entered and exited the imperial palace as if strolling in a courtyard."

"He experienced several opportunities, consuming [Earthly Glory] and [Human Yellow] several times, comprehending the Shu [Shrink the Earth]. Combined with his own lightness skill, his speed was incredible, inconceivable. For a time, his reputation was unmatched. Countless people in the Jianghu went mad seeking the Recipe for [Shrink the Earth]."

"Later, Bu Jingfeng died. He had a disciple. Relying on the [Shrink the Earth Recipe], spending a hundred years, following the same sequence, he successively consumed several Earthly Glories and Human Yellows, finally obtaining [Shrink the Earth]. But he could not reproduce Bu Jingfeng's might. Even... his lightness skill speed could not compare to some long-famous lightness skill masters."

"Only later did people know... originally, he was obsessed with [Shrink the Earth]. His long life was spent searching for Essence Treasures. Thus, he neglected his lightness skill practice. When he finally achieved his wish, pieced together the [Shrink the Earth] Shu, and consumed the Recipe..."

"Only then did he know that although the Way of Shu is wonderful, it requires a very high foundation in lightness skill to unleash its power. Time was wasted, the opportunity was gone, regret was too late. He empty obtained a treasure Shu, but regretted it for life."

Li Xian said, "I understand."

Madam Wen said, "You are very smart, very good."

"Madam," Li Xian asked curiously, "If in this world, someone had [Reborn Physique], [Wushu], and [Way of Shu], and the three complemented each other perfectly... just how terrifying would their strength be?"

Madam Wen was startled, thinking to herself: "This boy catches on quickly." She smiled: "Thinking about such things is useless. Go out and see if the White Clouds have gone the wrong way."

After Li Xian went out.

Madam Wen calculated in her heart: "The secrets of my clan's Recipes are all recorded in my mind. Over the years, piecing things together, I have already consumed seven or eight. The most important one... will be obtainable soon!"

Her eyes flickered, unable to contain her joy.

Li Xian held the reins, galloping between Heaven and Earth. Looking out, the world was white with snow, dotted with green leaves. The winter wind blew against his face, condensing frost and dew.

But it wasn't very cold.

Li Xian thought to himself: "So between Heaven and Earth, there are such divine things as Heavenly Essences, Earthly Glories, and Human Yellows. Besides the Way of Wushu, there is also Shu."

"Madam said the Way of Shu is the authority granted by Heaven and Earth. Although Shu is fantastical and has a hundred uses, it seems to be just an additional means for martial artists, not... directly increasing combat power."

"It can never replace martial practice. We martial artists must still focus on practice. This is the foundation of strength."

"When my strength is powerful in the future, perhaps I can also... become a Shu-holding martial artist. But that is still far away. I must walk the path beneath my feet well, bringing the Gang Thunder Finger to its peak and the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword to perfection!"

"This kind of improvement is real and solid! Those illusory matters are hard to touch and not controlled by myself. No need to think too much."

Li Xian saw the vast world, Wushu, strange arts, the Way of Shu, the Way of Literature, luck, and Essence Treasures. He did not lose himself. Although his experience was shallow, his mind was broad. He desired to learn all the various gates and paths, to be omnipotent.

But he knew the distinction between primary and secondary, and the difference between urgency and slowness.

The Way of Wushu is the foundation; the rest are merely icing on the cake.

Li Xian looked inward. His Qi Lake was thirty-four zhang wide. The Four Directions Fist, Breeze Legs, and Great Luo Sword Method shaped its foundation. Azure Luo Palm, Iron Copper Skill, and Gang Thunder Finger increased its momentum. The Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword protected the root...

"Although I have much Wushu, it is not systematic, nor comprehensive," Li Xian murmured. "When should I... also get a lightness skill?"

Midnight.

The carriage stopped. A warm stream flowed through the mountains.

The surrounding trees were dense, the wind and snow were lighter. The White Clouds' steps were light, the carriage was stable in all directions. But traveling day after day, it was not good regardless.

Madam Wen sat cross-legged in the carriage. She lifted the curtain and practiced "Silk Garment Misplaced Jade Skill" internally. However, her power slowly retreated, which was very improper.

"I came to this Prefecture City, and although I obtained the Golden Scale as I wished, my Silk Garment Misplaced Jade Skill has regressed quite a bit. Truly helpless... Forget it, this strange skill is already at the edge of a breakthrough. When I return to the manor, I will go into seclusion a few more times, and I will be able to break through."

She saw Li Xian practicing martial arts diligently and nodded slightly, saying: "This boy has a firm nature. When I first heard of the Way of Shu, I neglected my martial practice for three days, my mind full of fantastical, ever-changing techniques. Only later did I regain my focus and practice Wushu diligently. The so-called Way of Shu... is merely an aid to the Way of Wushu."

"A powerful martial artist, holding a strange technique, is truly powerful. An ordinary mud doll, even if he could digest Essence Treasures and comprehend the Way of Shu, would still be extremely weak."

[You practiced finger techniques diligently, Gang Thunder Finger Proficiency +13]
[Wind and snow do not change his will, cold does not weaken his intent. The finger points, thunder startles, the majestic thunder might, Gang Thunder Finger Proficiency +16]

The essence of the Thunder Sound Finger lies in the "Sound" character, its principle opposite yet complementary to the Shock Thunder Finger. It is extremely subtle.

The Shock Thunder Finger, at the moment of pointing, the chest drums with thunder sound, shock force transmits into the finger. The finger points without sound, yet the shock force is extremely strong, incomparably rigid. The Thunder Sound Finger's principle is opposite; at the instant of pointing, it uses "finger force" to counter-shock the chest drum.

The chest drum thunder sound, originally loud and vigorous, like thunder rumbling. Using the Thunder Sound Finger to shake the drum, this thunder sound becomes sharp and piercing. It stabs the eardrums and disturbs the spirit.

The Wushu manifests strangely, like附着 lightning arcs. The surroundings are pitch black, but at the moment the finger points, as if thunder and lightning strike, the area is instantly illuminated.

[Gang Thunder Finger]
[Proficiency: 8655/10000 Great Completion]

Li Xian practiced martial arts diligently, possessing his own style.

After traveling for several days like this, they exited the continuous mountain range. A vast plain stretched out endlessly.

Wild geese flew across the sky.

Li Xian wore a fox fur coat to keep out the cold and warmth, the wind and snow could not invade. Whenever he had free time, he would practice the Way of Wushu hard.

Along the road, the houses grew lower, transitioning from wealthy to poor. By the halfway point, Li Xian's [Gang Thunder Finger] was nearing perfection. The Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword was slightly slower, but not far behind.

Madam Wen raised her eyebrows slightly and suddenly thought of something, calling out: "Xiao Xian, come into the carriage."

Li Xian lifted the curtain, a slight sweat on his body. Madam Wen said, "I have something to ask you. You must answer truthfully."

"Please ask, Madam," Li Xian said.

"The Wushu you use, why can all of them reach the pinnacle?" Madam Wen said softly. "Answer well, do not lie to me."

Li Xian thought: "I have been with Madam for a long time. Since moving into the inner courtyard, I sometimes practice Wushu in the courtyard. The Four Directions Fist, Breeze Legs... have all been revealed to Madam to some extent."

"Madam did not know I had reached the pinnacle in all of them. It seems that although Madam's Wushu cultivation is deep, she cannot see through Wushu that has reached the pinnacle."

The thought flashed by. Li Xian said, "Madam, I... I don't know."

"You don't know?" Madam Wen said softly. "Is it truly that you don't know, or are you hiding something else?"

"Li Xian is hiding nothing," Li Xian said. "If... if I must explain why I can reach the pinnacle, I suspect... I suspect it might be related to a dream?"

"A dream?" Madam Wen was stunned.

Li Xian said, "Yes. A while ago, I practiced martial arts day and night, as if mad. I felt no obstruction. Sometimes when I practiced frantically, I actually fell asleep while practicing."

"In a daze, it seemed I was dreaming. I first dreamed of Madam teaching me the Four Directions Fist, instructing me on the essentials of the fist technique. Later, I dreamed of a martial master kicking legs under a willow tree. Then I dreamed of Madam... you were in the Azure Luo River, tied up..."

Madam Wen lowered her eyes, thinking secretly: "Could it be the Initial Scene of Wushu. It is said that when one practices to the point of madness, one might sense it vaguely and touch the Initial Scene. Anyone lucky enough to see the Initial Scene means they are extremely compatible with this Wushu. And extremely compatible with the creator of the Wushu. It is as if two worlds resonate with each other."

"Ah! The Four Directions Fist, Azure Luo Palm... were all created by me. This boy said I was bound in the Azure Luo River. That was when my Silk Garment Misplaced Jade Skill had just entered the third layer, and I was bound by ropes, very unaccustomed."

"Yes, this boy also has a [Perfect Physique], similar to mine. He also practices my Wushu, so vaguely, he is extremely compatible with me. This makes sense. This boy... truly is my lucky star. He is my..."

Her pretty face flushed slightly, but she said coldly: "Since that is the case, why didn't you tell me?"

"This illusory dream, I dared not speak wildly. And every time I dreamed, it involved Madam. I... I myself don't know why I didn't dare tell Madam," Li Xian said. He cursed inwardly: "If Madam knew about the Heaven's Reward for Diligence, she would surely find a way to control me completely. I need to keep some trump cards."

"Hmph!" Madam Wen said, "Raise your hand." Li Xian did as told, and a bloodstain appeared on his palm.

Madam Wen said, "What else are you hiding from me? Things related to me, related to you, whether dreams or reality, tell me everything."

Li Xian thought: "The matter of the Dual Pupils is even harder to mention." He shook his head quickly, pretending to be panicked: "No more, I have never thought of hiding anything from Madam."

Madam Wen looked at him with cold eyes, her peripheral glance falling on the Heaven and Earth Treasure Box on the table. She thought coldly: "You are a rare Golden Scale, but how can you escape from my Heaven and Earth."

Seeing Li Xian's panicked appearance, ripples rose in her heart again, and she felt some reluctance to be harsh: "I always scold and punish him, whether angry or happy. If he truly becomes my husband in the future, being obedient is important, but this spirit... is also very important."

Her voice softened, and she no longer scolded.

The Broken Sword Madam was famously ruthless. Breaking people's limbs and snapping people's swords was as common as eating and drinking.

Today, she actually felt reluctant to be harsh; it was truly rare, truly strange.
