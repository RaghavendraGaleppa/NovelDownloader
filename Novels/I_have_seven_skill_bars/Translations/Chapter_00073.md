# Chapter 73: Pardon the Interruption

Suimen was very glad that he hadn't appeared too arrogant just now.

Dongfeng, hearing the number 1.7 million, was genuinely startled. But after a moment of stunned silence, he finally let out a sigh of relief, thinking, "They said 2 million, so as long as it's not 2 million, it's fine. There's still 300,000 difference. Luckily, luckily." Although he thought this, Dongfeng still felt a pang of bitterness. Having once been a spiritual field cultivator himself, he naturally understood the significance of 1.7 million for a spiritual farmer's first harvest.

Just as Dongfeng was feeling melancholic, suddenly, another harvesting disciple patted his thigh and chuckled, "Old Bai, you got it wrong, didn't you? I think this junior brother was asking about Junior Brother Ding Rui's *total* harvest from his spiritual field this time!"

"Ah? Wasn't he asking how much Junior Brother Ding Rui received this time?"

"No way! Junior brother, tell us, what were you asking about?"

As the conversation between the two harvesting disciples came out, the entire 520 spiritual field fell silent for a moment. Dongfeng froze, and Suimen also froze. But Suimen quickly reacted. As a spiritual farmer with considerable seniority, he had already caught the crucial information from their words.

"So, Senior Brother, you mean that the 1.7 million grains of spirit rice were the spirit rice that the sect returned to Junior Brother Ding, which you brought here on the floating ship?" Suimen tentatively asked.

They wanted him to guide Ding Rui! But now...

Suimen couldn't help but look at the Purple Vein Flowers swaying in the wind within the 520 spiritual field. That sea of purple flowers was so vivid, so dazzling in Suimen's eyes. This was no longer a question of strong talent or not! What kind of immortal power was this! Fortunately, decades of spiritual field life, enduring wind and sun, had given him a tanned face, so no matter how red or embarrassed his face got, others couldn't easily notice.

But Dongfeng was completely unable to stay calm. Especially when he remembered what he had just said: if Ding Rui exceeded 2 million, he would ask an inner sect senior brother to help Ding Rui make a request! He had originally thought this was an impossible condition for Ding Rui to meet. Who knew, it turned out he had dug a pit and buried himself in it! Dongfeng deeply closed his eyes. At this moment, his feelings were too complex to express.

"That's naturally not a problem, thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother!" Ding Rui quickly said, "The Purple Vein Flowers I planted myself have been growing for nearly a month now. In a few more days, they will likely enter their rapid growth phase. By then, the Purple Vein Flowers planted by the sect probably won't have even sprouted. So, even if I can't sustain it at that time, it won't affect the sect's plans. It's precisely because of this that I dared to make such a request, simply to allow the sect to free up more manpower for other spiritual fields."

"When the sect's planted Purple Vein Flowers enter their rapid growth phase, my own planted ones should be nearing their flowering stage. I can completely use this head start to prove myself!" Ding Rui spoke these words sincerely and with full confidence, because that was exactly what he intended.

"That would be for the best!" Dongfeng said, then turned and left, leaving only, "Wait for my news tomorrow." He didn't want to stay in this place any longer. He had come to show off, so how had Ding Rui ended up showing him off instead?

After watching Dongfeng leave, Ding Rui looked at Suimen and bowed, saying, "Senior Brother Suimen, I'm truly sorry. I have great respect for you; I was just thinking about how I could provide the greatest help to the sect."

Suimen no longer had any trace of arrogance or the condescension of a senior. He quickly returned the bow: "There's nothing to be sorry about! It's Junior Brother's talent that is too high. To be able to meet such a rare genius today is truly a blessing for three lifetimes. If there truly is any spiritual farmer who can cultivate Purple Vein Flowers alone, I believe it can only be you, Junior Brother!"

"Junior Brother Ding, I'll take my leave now. We'll wait for the notification tomorrow. Pardon the interruption!"

"Oh?" Jiang She couldn't help but widen his eyes. "2.78 million grains of spirit rice, as a newly-become spiritual farmer's *first* harvest? Are you sure?"

"I'm sure. I've asked several senior brothers in charge of harvesting."

Jiang She frowned, thought for a while, and his expression also became serious. He looked at Dongfeng and said, "Is there more? Continue."
