# Chapter 223: Wariness

Wealth stirs men's hearts. For cultivators, powerful techniques equate to resources, and resources equate to wealth.

The Divine Footstep inheritance is one of the Thousand Leaves Temple's divine ability legacies, the same one obtained by the Buddha Jueyuan. Normally, Jueyuan would have Arhats secretly protecting him, but this rare battle provided Li Yuanba the opportunity to kill him. Thus, there was a certain probability that the Divine Footstep inheritance had fallen into Li Yuanba's hands.

Elder Lü was at the Golden Core stage, but he too had ambitions. His greed for a divine ability—something even Nascent Soul cultivators pursued—was immense.

Though rumors claimed that inheriting divine abilities was extremely difficult—with the Thousand Leaves Temple producing only one inheritor every few centuries—even a one-in-ten-thousand chance was worth grasping. As long as he held the Divine Footstep inheritance, there was always that sliver of hope.

Moreover, even if he couldn't comprehend the Divine Footstep himself, it was still an incredibly precious resource that could be exchanged for vast amounts of Golden Core-level resources to enhance his own strength.

When it came to his own advancement, Elder Lü no longer cared about maintaining his carefully crafted persona within the sect.

As for whether to kill Li Yuanba or not, it depended on whether the young man was sensible. If he proved uncooperative, Elder Lü would simply have to ensure the deed was done cleanly, leaving no traces for Sword Elder to uncover.

"Senior Brother Li, the contribution points for the Thousand Leaves Temple's true disciple Jueyuan are 2,400!" the attendant announced after completing the formalities.

Those present who had heard of Jueyuan's reputation now looked at Li Yuanba with fear in their eyes, no longer merely lowering their heads out of respect for his status as a true disciple. Even those unfamiliar with Jueyuan were stunned by the sheer number of contribution points.

Since the mission's rewards were doubled, this meant the original reward for killing Jueyuan was 1,200 points—whereas slaying a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator would only net 800 points. The comparison alone made it clear that Jueyuan's strength far surpassed that of an ordinary late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

"Elder Lü, I'll take my leave to rest now," Li Yuanba said, nodding to the attendant in thanks before turning to bid farewell to Elder Lü.

"Go ahead," Elder Lü replied with a faint smile, waving dismissively.

Once outside the mission hall, Li Yuanba withdrew his spiritual sense from his storage bracelet. Throughout the entire encounter, his awareness had remained fixed on the Sword Intent Prayer Beads. Had Elder Lü made any suspicious moves, he would have immediately activated them.

This was his safeguard against a Golden Core elder—at the very least, it could delay Elder Lü long enough for him to call for help from other Golden Core elders.

He exhaled deeply. The Demon Sect was truly troublesome, requiring constant vigilance against all manner of threats.

Lost in thought, he arrived at an open area on the most prominent part of the mountain pass. There, he set up thirty-six formation flags and stepped inside.

---

First, he sat cross-legged and emptied his mind, entering a meditative state.

Meanwhile, his true body—Li Shiming—used the IBMz15 to transmit the Divine Footstep's inheritance diagram, the "White Lotus Diagram," through their connection, loading it directly into Li Yuanba's consciousness.

Seated in meditation, Li Yuanba suddenly felt as if his brain had been struck by a heavy hammer. His vision swam, and he collapsed to the ground, unable to maintain his posture.

A torrent of data flooded his mind. Steam rose from his head—a sign of his brain working overtime.

He lay unconscious for an hour before finally stirring. Groggily, he sat up and shook his head vigorously.

In terms of spiritual strength, he was roughly on par with Jueyuan, though the Buddha might have been slightly stronger. 

Top-tier geniuses, provided they were nurtured with full resources from the beginning, didn't differ much in foundational aspects. At least at the Foundation Establishment stage, with both cultivating top-tier techniques, their physical bodies, spiritual power, and qi were nearly equal. 

Jueyuan's higher cultivation stage naturally meant his spiritual strength was slightly superior.

After receiving the Divine Footstep inheritance, Jueyuan had spent years successfully visualizing the "White Lotus Diagram." During that time, the Thousand Leaves Temple had provided immense support, including memory-enhancing spiritual items and specialized Sanskrit guidance.

Yet, what took Jueyuan years to visualize was transmitted to Li Yuanba in a single breath by the IBMz15. The sheer overload triggered Li Yuanba's mental defenses, causing him to faint.

However, Li Shiming had calculated this carefully—having endured a similar impact himself, he was the best judge. 

Though Li Yuanba suffered momentarily, this method allowed him to master the basics of the Divine Footstep in an incredibly short time.

Ask any cultivator in the world: would they trade an hour of unconsciousness—with no lasting harm—for the chance to learn the foundational techniques of a divine ability? Even if it caused injuries that required healing, they would gladly accept.

Li Yuanba shook his head again, his mind still foggy. 

After another incense stick's worth of time, his thoughts finally cleared.

Sensing the "White Lotus Diagram" in his consciousness, he broke into a smile.

"Worth it," he murmured. "Finally, a proper means of self-preservation."

Li Yuanba's combat prowess was already formidable. The "Sword Demon Secret Codex" granted him exceptional defensive and close-combat abilities, while his flying sword provided ranged attacks, and he could employ sword teleportation for movement.

However, due to his cultivation stage, his sword teleportation speed was only relatively fast among peers of the same level. Against opponents specializing in speed from higher realms, his advantage diminished.

His physical defenses and melee attacks were last resorts—each use carried significant risk. There was no guarantee an enemy wouldn't possess means to breach his defenses or match his close-quarters combat prowess.

The "Sword Demon Secret Codex" granted him resilience against ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators' spiritual tools, but true disciples or those wielding powerful spiritual tools could still penetrate his defenses.

With the Divine Footstep, he could now outpace any cultivator in speed. If he couldn't win a fight, he could kite his opponent—and if even that failed, he could simply flee.

Moreover, as a demonic cultivator, he was inherently at odds with the Thousand Leaves Temple. Even if he used the Divine Footstep openly, he needn't fear reprisal from them.

Still, he knew caution was necessary. Elder Lü's odd behavior today made him suspect it might be related to the Divine Footstep.

With this in mind, he modified the formation, expanding its interior space. The formation prevented outsiders from spying—whether through spiritual sense or divine sense—and even the mountain's grand array couldn't penetrate the barrier created by the thirty-six flags.

Li Yuanba stood on the ground, focusing on the "White Lotus Diagram." From Li Shiming, he had already gained knowledge on how to use the Divine Footstep.

His body lifted from the ground, a white lotus blooming beneath his feet. Then, nearly a hundred meters away, a second white lotus appeared.

Li Yuanba's figure vanished from his original position, reappearing atop the second lotus. This was the maximum distance he could currently achieve with the Divine Footstep—only slightly less than Jueyuan's range.

Having mastered the technique, his earlier worries eased considerably.

He didn't linger. Right now, the battlefield was the safest place for him. He resolved to minimize future interactions with Elder Lü.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he collected all the formation flags and flashed out of the pass, heading straight for the battlefield.

---

Elder Lü stood atop a higher vantage point, watching Li Yuanba coldly.

He had once held high hopes for the young man—provided their interests didn't conflict. A faint sneer curled his lips. Did Li Yuanba truly think he could escape his grasp?

Of course, he would first attempt to trade Foundation Establishment-level resources for the Divine Footstep inheritance. But if Li Yuanba refused... well, he couldn't be blamed for what came next.

From the very beginning of their cultivation journey, demonic cultivators thrived on slaughter and competition. When resources beneficial to oneself appeared, how could they possibly be ignored?

He needed to act before Li Yuanba returned to the sect. Once back under Sword Elder's watchful gaze, making a move would be tantamount to suicide.

---

Li Yuanba traveled using sword teleportation, not daring to underestimate the Thousand Leaves Temple. Their Buddha's methods were formidable.

This time, luck was on his side. After covering just over forty li, he sensed intense spiritual energy fluctuations ahead.

Canceling his sword teleportation, he switched to flight magic, skimming the ground as he approached the source of the disturbance.

Soon, the battlefield came into view: twelve Buddhas encircled by fifteen demonic cultivators launching relentless assaults.

The twelve Buddhas defended with remarkable coordination, using their defensive spiritual tools to form two concentric rings. When the outer ring was breached, the inner ring would take over, allowing their comrades to reestablish defenses.

Such teamwork was rare among cultivators, most of whom trained alone and seldom placed complete trust in others. 

In the Demon Sect, it was nearly impossible to find cultivators willing to cooperate so seamlessly. While some might have close allies, absolute trust was unheard of.

In contrast, the fifteen attacking demonic cultivators showed no coordination whatsoever. They simply relied on numbers, employing various methods to break the Buddhas' defenses.

Originally, this battlefield hadn't hosted so many combatants. Initially, it was just two squads—four Buddhas and six demonic cultivators—clashing. 

Neither side could gain the upper hand, and as the battle dragged on, it attracted more cultivators from both factions. With demonic cultivators scouring the battlefield in greater numbers, the current situation had formed.

"I'll take four Buddhas. The rest are yours," Li Yuanba announced as he arrived at the battlefield's edge.

"Who do you think you are, making such demands?" a demonic cultivator retorted angrily.

Li Yuanba didn't respond, instead locking eyes with several demonic cultivators who recognized him—fellow disciples from his batch.

"Senior Brother, we have no objections!" those cultivators quickly declared, their voices loud and clear.

The others caught on. Among those who had spoken were mid- and late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, yet they addressed this early-stage Foundation Establishment youth as "Senior Brother." That could only mean one thing—a true disciple had arrived.

"Senior Brother, my mouth runs ahead of my brain. Please forgive my rudeness. This matter is yours to decide!" the previously defiant cultivator hastily backtracked.

"Then let's finish this quickly. More Buddhas showing up would complicate things," Li Yuanba said, brushing off the earlier remark.

With a wave of his hand, sword light imbued with sword intent shot toward the encircled Buddhas.

"Beware! A true disciple approaches!" the trapped Buddhas warned each other, though their words were more for morale than information.

True disciples of major sects were never ordinary. With their powerful inherited techniques, formidable spiritual tools, and multiple life-preserving methods, they were the stuff of ordinary cultivators' nightmares.

The sword light struck a robe-shaped spiritual tool, which transformed into a golden wall shielding a wide area—the strongest defense among the twelve Buddhas.

A single strike was enough to make the robe's owner pale.

"Sword intent! It's a sword cultivator!" he cried out in alarm.

The second and third strikes came in quick succession—three attacks in barely over a breath's time. The high-grade robe spiritual tool lost its defensive properties, severing its connection with its owner and falling to the ground.

The Buddha spat blood. As he fumbled for another defensive tool, the sword light was already upon him.

The twelve Buddhas' coordinated defense was indeed effective—each guarding their sector with concentrated spiritual energy ensured collective safety.

But this strategy had a flaw: if the defense was breached and the enemy's attack speed was overwhelming, all cooperating Buddhas would be left vulnerable in an instant.

The sword light became a deadly serpent, first slaying the robe's owner, then weaving through the remaining Buddhas. Half had fallen before the others could react and scatter into individual defenses.

By then, it was too late. Even if Li Yuanba stopped attacking, the six surviving Buddhas stood no chance against fifteen demonic cultivators.

Li Yuanba showed no mercy. His sword light pursued one Buddha, piercing through the man's defensive spiritual tool and extinguishing his life under a gaze of despair.

The other demonic cultivators ganged up on the remaining five—three against one. If they couldn't end the fight swiftly after this, they had no business being on this battlefield.

When the dust settled, all demonic cultivators regarded Li Yuanba with awe. In less than two breaths, he had broken the deadlock and slain seven Buddhas single-handedly, showcasing the terror of a sword cultivator.

Li Yuanba nodded, collecting the corpses of four Buddhas—all mid- or late-stage Foundation Establishment. None dared protest.

Only after he left did the demonic cultivators begin dividing the spoils—a matter that no longer concerned him.

---

Over the following days, Li Yuanba roamed the battlefield, cutting down Buddha after Buddha.

His sword intent grew sharper with each battle, its killing aura thickening from the countless lives taken.

Once, when facing an early-stage Foundation Establishment Buddha, the sheer killing intent in his sword aura paralyzed the man with fear. The Buddha froze, making no move to counter before being pierced through the heart.

As Li Yuanba's storage bracelet filled with Buddha corpses, his reputation as a killer spread across the battlefield.
