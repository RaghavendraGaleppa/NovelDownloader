# Chapter 5: The Seventh Provisional Academy  

A sharp pain pierced between Zhang Jing's brows.  

In his sea of consciousness, the glow of the Mind's Eye Seed flickered, the illusory eye teetering on the verge of collapse.  

*Just hold on a little longer!*  

Gritting his teeth, his face contorted with effort, Zhang Jing desperately maintained the Mind's Eye state. His thoughts raced at full speed, wisps of white mist rising from his forehead.  

Though he didn’t understand what the jade talisman’s display of **[Remnant of the Nether Python Devouring Void Dao Rhyme]** meant, his instincts told him it was something extraordinary—a rare opportunity just for him.  

Finally.  

At the ninth breath, darkness flooded Zhang Jing’s vision as the illusory eye vanished. He withdrew from the Mind's Eye state, a pang of regret gnawing at him.  

*If only I could have held on a little longer...*  

Regaining his bearings, he peeked through the door crack and saw the immortal still deep in cultivation, seemingly oblivious to his actions.  

*Good—he didn’t notice!*  

Zhang Jing exhaled in relief. Dragging his heavy head and exhausted body, he slowly shuffled back to his original spot and sat down. A quick check confirmed his bundle remained untouched. Only then did he close his eyes in relief.  

He could sense a faint, elusive rhythm swirling in his heart, as if he could summon it at will.  

*This must be the **[Remnant of the Nether Python Devouring Void Dao Rhyme].***  

A glimmer of understanding flashed in his eyes.  

He yearned to test it out, but the thought of the immortal cultivating outside stopped him cold. Unlike the silent activation of the jade talisman’s seeds, this might make noise.  

*If he notices, how would I explain it? "Oh, I just happened to learn this by watching you cultivate"?*  

Even if that was the truth, who would believe it?  

He’d have to wait until entering the academy to explore the **[Remnant of the Nether Python Devouring Void Dao Rhyme]** properly.  

As exhaustion crept over him, drowsiness swallowed his thoughts.

**BOOM!**  

A thunderous roar erupted, followed by violent tremors.  

Inside the room, screams and shouts erupted in chaos.  

Amid the crowd, Zhang Jing blinked in confusion, utterly lost. His gaze landed on Ji Bochang and the other three in the center, who remained calm—as if they’d expected this.  

Noticing Zhang Jing’s stare, Ji Bochang fanned himself theatrically, the picture of smug superiority. His lips moved, but the noise drowned out his words. Zhang Jing could only read his lips:  

*"We’re here!"*  

His heart leapt.  

*Here? The Dragon Lake Academy!*  

Grabbing his bundle, he scrambled to his feet.  

Just then, the immortal’s serene voice cut through the clamor:  

**"Dragon Lake Academy has arrived. All of you, exit the room at once."**  

Silence fell instantly.  

Soon, Zhang Jing and the others stepped out onto the Azure Phoenix’s back, marveling at the sight before them.  

The sun hung low, a crimson half-disk melting into the distant lake. Fiery twilight merged seamlessly with the rippling water.  

As the Azure Phoenix’s cyan glow faded, moist air rushed into Zhang Jing’s pores, washing away his fatigue.  

An endless lake sprawled before them, dotted with islands and countless pavilions.  

*Dragon Marsh Lake!*  

Zhang Jing recalled the description from *The Three and Five Immortal Chronicles*:  

*Dragon Marsh Lake spans fifteen hundred li in the eastern Nanli region, teeming with islands, spiritual energy, and mystical creatures. It is the sacred ground of the Dragon Lake Academy—impassable for mortals.*  

More importantly, the lake housed *dragons*.  

Moments later, the Azure Phoenix soared into the lake’s depths and vanished.  

On a nearby island, a gruff voice rang out:  

**"Stop staring. That senior brother was only tasked with delivering you here."**  

Turning, they saw a middle-aged man smiling at them.  

Clearing his throat, the man continued:  

**"Young ones from Huizhou, welcome to the Seventh Provisional Academy of Dragon Lake. I am Instructor Wang, one of those overseeing your assessment."**  

**"Greetings, Instructor Wang!"** the sixty-five youths chorused.  

Nodding, Instructor Wang said, **"You’ve likely heard of the academy’s rigorous selection process. In truth, it’s even stricter than you imagine."**  

**"Though you’re all prodigies handpicked from across Huizhou, I assure you—fewer than ten of you will pass."**  

**"The path of immortality demands talent, intellect, perseverance, and fortune. None can be lacking."**  

**"Enough talk. Tonight, settle into your lodgings. They’re divided into three tiers—A, B, and C. Choose wisely."**  

He gestured toward a cluster of buildings.  

While the others craned their necks, Zhang Jing analyzed the island’s layout.  

They stood on a hundred-foot-square plaza paved with seamless stone. At its center loomed a stele inscribed with *Seventh Provisional Academy*.  

Surrounding the plaza were lecture halls, dining halls, and training grounds. The residential area formed three concentric arcs:  

- The innermost tier: secluded courtyards nestled among trees.  
- The middle tier: neat rows of cottages.  
- The outermost tier: shabby stone huts.  

**"Rest well tonight. Assemble at the lecture hall at mao hour tomorrow."**  

With that, Instructor Wang strode away, leaving the group bewildered.  

Soon, a mad dash erupted as candidates sprinted for the courtyards.  

**"Futile effort,"** Ji Bochang remarked, fanning himself.  

Zhang Jing frowned. **"Brother Ji, what do you mean?"**  

**"Brother Zhang, these lodgings aren’t first-come-first-served."**  

**"The inner courtyards have spirit-gathering arrays but cost spirit stones. The cottages require silver. The stone huts? Free."**  

His tone turned grave. **"Brother Zhang, the academy’s test has already begun."**  

**"My thanks for the warning."**  

Zhang Jing’s heart sank.  

*The academy doesn’t lack silver—or spirit stones, the currency of cultivators.*  

*So...*  

He recalled Instructor Wang’s words:  

**"Talent, intellect, perseverance, and fortune."**  

*So being born wealthy counts as fortune too. Interesting.*  

Watching Ji Bochang’s group stroll leisurely toward the courtyards, Zhang Jing hurried to the cottage area.  

With only twenty-seven taels of silver, he’d have to settle for the stone huts if the price was too steep.
