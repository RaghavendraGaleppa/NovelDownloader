# Chapter 147: True Intent

"Shi Lan has grown so much!" After concluding official matters, Elder Lu of the Water Cloud Sect smiled warmly at Yin Shilan.

"Aunt Lu!" Yin Shilan stepped forward to bow before greeting each of the Golden Core elders in turn.

Li Shiming stood to the side, unsure of how to proceed.

"Shi Lan, who is this young man?" Elder Lu asked, looking at Li Shiming.

In truth, the perception range of these Golden Core elders was vast. Having been on Seven Stars Island all along, they had long noticed the intimate relationship between Yin Shilan and Li Shiming.

"Aunt Lu, this is Li Shiming. Like me, he's an intermediate formation master!" Yin Shilan, unable to withstand Elder Lu's gaze, introduced him softly before retreating behind her father, Elder Yin.

"Stop staring at the children!" Elder Yin waved his hand dismissively.

"This child carries the aura of the Vajra Relic. Li Shiming, were you the one who composed 'Soul-Snatching Chant' and 'First Light of Buddha'?" Master Duhai's eyes lit up as he interjected.

He was already certain—the Vajra Relic had belonged to the late monk Duyuan. News from the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect indicated that Duyuan had gifted it to the composer of those two Buddhist hymns.

"Reporting to the master, it was indeed me," Li Shiming replied with a bow.

"This child has deep ties to Buddhism!" Master Duhai said with a smile.

Yin Shilan tugged nervously at Li Shiming's sleeve, afraid he might be whisked away by Master Duhai.

Her small gesture drew knowing smiles from the Golden Core cultivators, who had all been young once themselves. Seeing Yin Shilan and Li Shiming reminded them of their own youthful days.

"Li Shiming is a disciple of our sect, Master Duhai. Don't get any ideas!" Elder Yin said, though displeased by his daughter's intimate gesture with Li Shiming, he still stepped forward to assert his claim.

"Elder Yin, you may not realize this, but 'Soul-Snatching Chant' and 'First Light of Buddha' are no ordinary hymns. To compose such works, one must possess profound understanding of Buddhist teachings. Look at the young man's pure Vajra strength—our sect's 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' is widely circulated, but how many can reach such a level at the Qi Refining stage?" Master Duhai explained with a smile.

Li Shiming wanted to clarify that his 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' was unique. Enhanced by the Vajra Relic and supplemented by the 'Sword Demon Secret Codex,' his cultivation had reached the pinnacle of his current realm. 

In other words, his 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' was constrained only by his cultivation level. He was waiting for his realm to advance, as his mastery of the art had already surpassed it.

"Since Master Duhai thinks so highly of Li Shiming, why not offer him some guidance?" Elder Yin, familiar with Li Shiming's background, knew he was not one to be swayed by Buddhist teachings. He smiled as he spoke.

Though this was his first meeting with Li Shiming, Elder Yin had thoroughly investigated the young man's past, from his days in the Great Xia Dynasty to his entry into the sect. 

Li Shiming was indeed talented in literature, but any suggestion of Buddhist inclinations was unfounded. His secular life had been marked by decisive action, and aside from practicing the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art,' there was no evidence of Buddhist leanings.

Elder Yin's words were meant to secure some benefits for Li Shiming from Master Duhai. The Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect was vast and well-established, its foundations even deeper than those of the Heavenly Sea Sect.

"Very well. I observe that the young man's 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' is incomplete, differing from our sect's secret version. I shall impart to you the Qi Refining to Golden Core stages of our sect's 'Vajra Protection Divine Art.' Master it fully, and you could stand firm among Golden Core cultivators with this art alone!" Master Duhai nodded slightly.

He understood Elder Yin's intent but had his own motives. Both the hymns, which demonstrated Li Shiming's grasp of Buddhist teachings, and his refined Vajra strength convinced Master Duhai of the young man's deep Buddhist affinity. 

With proper guidance, Li Shiming would inevitably become a part of the Buddhist community. The late monk Duyuan's gift of the Vajra Relic reflected a similar belief. Master Duhai saw no harm in giving him a nudge.

When Master Duhai claimed that the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' alone could establish Li Shiming among Golden Core cultivators, the young man initially thought it an exaggeration. But the lack of dissent from the other Golden Core elders confirmed its truth.

Intrigued, Li Shiming regarded Master Duhai with eager anticipation.

"This 'Vajra Protection Divine Art' is a secret transmission. Sharing it is forbidden, punishable by pursuit from the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect," Master Duhai declared before lightly tapping Li Shiming's brow with a finger.

The brow was a vital point, and Li Shiming instinctively flinched, but the finger's motion, deceptively slow, was unavoidable. A stream of knowledge flowed into his mind, which he absorbed intently while IBMz15 recorded it.

Master Duhai's method was mysterious—Li Shiming could only perceive the Qi Refining portion of the art; the rest remained obscured.

Even IBMz15 couldn't record the obscured sections, a first for Li Shiming. However, he was quickly captivated by the Qi Refining content, particularly the True Intent Contemplation Diagram unique to the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect's secret version.

The diagram depicted a wrathful Vajra guardian. Though merely an image, it conveyed the guardian's defiance against the world's constraints, radiating fury. 

This diagram was a key. Li Shiming, already deeply versed in the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art,' found new understanding through it. He began practicing the art spontaneously, guided by IBMz15's recitation of the 'Diamond Sutra' and its precise alignment of the diagram's details with his body.

Before the Golden Core elders, Li Shiming assumed an unusual stance, his muscles subtly adjusting. As his posture aligned perfectly, his Vajra strength flowed smoothly, and a faint glow emanated from him.

The elders, rarely gathered together, watched with amusement as Master Duhai guided the young man.

"Impressive comprehension!" Elder Lu praised, noting Li Shiming's awkward but effective movements, which clearly indicated newfound insight into the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art.'

Li Shiming's focused expression suggested he had entered a state of enlightenment.

As the elders nodded in approval, Li Shiming suddenly roared, his robes billowing as his muscles bulged. The fury in his cry matched his stance, creating a perfect harmony with the wrathful Vajra's intent.

Master Duhai's eyes narrowed. He recognized the flawless embodiment of the wrathful Vajra from the diagram. If this was deliberate, it would be mere imitation. But in an unconscious state of enlightenment, it was extraordinary.

The elders' smiles faded as they focused intently on Li Shiming.

Transformed into the wrathful Vajra, Li Shiming's Vajra strength surged, enhancing his physique beyond previous limits. Behind him, an apparition of the wrathful Vajra materialized.

"True Intent Manifestation!" Master Duhai murmured, his lips twitching.

This phenomenon occurred when a cultivator's comprehension of the True Intent Diagram achieved perfect resonance, greatly amplifying the art's effects. Even Master Duhai had only achieved this with his primary cultivation method, despite centuries of practice with others.

True Intent Manifestation wasn't a matter of time but of innate talent. For a Qi Refining cultivator like Li Shiming to attain it was unheard of. Among the gathered Golden Core elders, most had never experienced it.

Li Shiming's success stemmed from Master Duhai's flawless transmission of the True Intent Diagram and IBMz15's objective analysis, which allowed perfect execution of the diagram's details—something no ordinary cultivator could achieve.

As Li Shiming's enlightenment deepened, his spiritual energy vortex spun uncontrollably. Unaware, he continued his exploration of Vajra strength.

"Channel spiritual energy here!" Elder Yin crushed ten mid-grade spirit stones, flooding the area with dense spiritual energy.

Zhuge Xuan and Yin Shilan adjusted the island's formation, directing spiritual energy from the caves to Li Shiming's location.

The energy condensed into a mist, obscuring Li Shiming's form while the wrathful Vajra apparition remained vivid.

Li Shiming's vortex contracted, then expanded, absorbing the surrounding energy to compensate for the expansion. His cultivation surged from the sixth to the seventh level of Qi Refining, stabilizing at mid-seventh level.

The elders weren't surprised. Li Shiming's profound physical cultivation, combined with True Intent Manifestation and enlightenment, naturally propelled his advancement. The wrathful Vajra's intent, guiding him, bridged the gap between his physical and spiritual cultivation.

However, constrained by his 'Five Elements Absorption Art,' his progress halted at mid-seventh level. He would need time to refine his spiritual energy to match this new stage.

True Intent Manifestation was a rare phenomenon, interpreted differently across sects. Buddhists saw it as one of the Buddha's myriad forms, Daoists as the embodiment of natural laws, and demonic cultivators as the convergence of countless beliefs.

Regardless of interpretation, it was unheard of for a Qi Refining cultivator to achieve it. Most of the present Golden Core elders had never experienced it.

Li Shiming's success was due to Master Duhai's perfect transmission and IBMz15's unparalleled analytical precision, enabling flawless execution of the True Intent Diagram's intricacies.

Awakening from his trance, Li Shiming felt the changes in his body. His physique had improved, nearing that of his avatar. Though still a gap remained, he anticipated parity upon reaching the same realm.

He underestimated this opportunity. The True Intent Manifestation of the 'Vajra Protection Divine Art,' combined with the 'Sword Demon Secret Codex' rooted in third-grade sword foundations, would surpass his avatar's pure 'Sword Demon Secret Codex' cultivation. 

Were it not for the drop of Golden Core blood in his avatar, Li Shiming's physique might already rival it.

"How did I reach mid-seventh level Qi Refining?" he wondered, noticing his advancement.

But his surprise was cut short as he realized the elders' intense scrutiny, particularly Master Duhai's fervent gaze.

A chill ran down his spine under the old monk's stare.

"Thank you, Master Duhai!" Remembering the source of his transformation, Li Shiming bowed deeply.

"Young benefactor, your connection to Buddhism is undeniable. Visit the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect when you can. Here is my token," Master Duhai said warmly, offering a Buddhist talisman.
