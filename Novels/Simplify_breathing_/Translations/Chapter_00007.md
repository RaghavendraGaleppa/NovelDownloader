# Chapter 7: Talent

The Blood-Vitality Pill's experience indeed increased by 1 point, and Chen Fei felt a slight sense of relief. Indeed, there were more insights regarding the refining of Blood-Vitality Pills in his mind.

He ate the stir-fried pig liver on the plate in a few bites. Chen Fei hadn't put many pieces of pig liver into the wok. Since there was no specific amount required for stir-frying pig liver, Chen Fei naturally picked the smallest amount. Based on the amount he bought previously, Chen Fei could still stir-fry pig liver dozens of times. But dozens of times wouldn't be enough to cultivate the Blood-Vitality Pill refining to the proficiency level.

Chen Fei carefully cut off a tiny bit of pig liver and threw it into the wok. He wanted to test how small an amount of stir-fried pig liver the panel would acknowledge. A moment later, stir-fried pig liver, almost the size of a fingernail, came out of the wok. Chen Fei smiled, and another insight regarding the Blood-Vitality Pill emerged in his mind.

Chen Fei looked at the remaining pig liver. A hundred practices would be enough! Full of motivation, Chen Fei enthusiastically threw himself into the process of stir-frying pig liver, completely engrossed. An hour later, all the pig liver was stir-fried. Chen Fei felt a bit sick of eating it; after all, it was all stir-fried pig liver, and Chen Fei's cooking skills were indeed rather ordinary. But these were secondary. The most crucial thing was that the Blood-Vitality Pill displayed on the panel had reached the proficiency level. With proficiency in refining Blood-Vitality Pills, he could now guarantee the success of every batch, with no more furnace explosions or wasted pills.

Chen Fei set his strategy in his mind, tidied up the scene briefly, and then rushed back to the medical hall, finding Zeng Defang in the alchemy room.

"Just put the pill formula on the table," Zeng Defang said, looking up at Chen Fei, then lowering his head again to the medical book in his hand. He thought Chen Fei had returned to give back the pill formula.

"Elder Zeng, I tried refining the Blood-Vitality Pill these past two days, and I succeeded," Chen Fei said with a smile, placing the pill formula down.

"Hmm?" Zeng Defang frowned slightly, looking at Chen Fei with a hint of dissatisfaction. He said, "I should have told you a few days ago that the medical hall will not provide you with free medicinal ingredients."

"Yes, I will pay to buy a set of Blood-Vitality Pill ingredients and refine it on the spot. I hope Elder Zeng can give me some guidance," Chen Fei said, cupping his hands.

"I don't have time. Find someone else to guide you." Zeng Defang pouted. This kid was simply baffling. After looking at the pill formula for two days, he claimed he could refine Blood-Vitality Pills? Who did he think he was? "And he wants this old man to watch him refine? Do you think I have that much free time!"

The first few steps were unfamiliar, but Chen Fei remained calm. Proficiency in Blood-Vitality Pill refining was equivalent to an alchemist who had been refining pills for several years. From the moment the medicinal ingredients entered the pill furnace, everything fell into Chen Fei's rhythm. Every change within the pill furnace was within Chen Fei's response and expectation. There were only a few types of medicinal ingredients for refining Blood-Vitality Pills, so the changes in their properties were not significant. Mastering these changes meant mastering the guaranteed success of every batch.

However, Chen Fei couldn't display his proficiency level right now; that would be too much. Therefore, when some changes occurred in the pill furnace, Chen Fei intentionally didn't adjust immediately. This would affect the quality of the pill but wouldn't cause a furnace explosion, making it a tolerable minor error.

Zeng Defang watched Chen Fei, moving from initial suspicion to slight surprise, and now he was somewhat stunned.
