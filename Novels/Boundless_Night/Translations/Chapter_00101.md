# Chapter 101: All Parties Arrive

Qin Ming's words were not false; he had truly just seen an ancient Grandmaster walking towards him. The Grandmaster held a large lance that stirred up surging dark clouds across the sky, drawing down lightning. His peerless, heroic figure shook heaven and earth.

Unfortunately, the Overlord ultimately died, and tragically so. After he stabbed the elder's fair, jade-like hand, making it bloody, he was locked down by the opponent's golden immortal runes. The elder, renowned throughout the Night Mist World, struck him with six palm strikes from afar, corresponding to the Overlord's four limbs, torso, and head. Each strike caused one part of his body to explode.

In the moment before his head shattered, the Overlord remained silent, glaring with fury, two golden bolts of lightning shooting from his eyes.

However, the elder, with hair white as snow and a complexion like a child's, merely waved his jade-like hand gently, and the flying lightning bolts dispersed, vanishing without a trace.

The Overlord's cultivation realm was lower than the elder's, yet he managed to injure a great figure from the Outer Realms, causing blood to stream from their right hand. This feat had shaken all corners of the world over a hundred years ago.

After the Overlord's death, the fresh red blood that landed on the ground actually emitted light, shining for a long time without fading, like clusters of immortal divine flames. It was only when the elder stepped down, turning that area into scorched earth, that all the strange phenomena completely disappeared.

Before this, the Overlord's ability to escape all the way and write down the culmination of his life's efforts certainly spoke to his extraordinary qualities. However, it was also related to the elder's unhurried pursuit.

"I see some hope on this path, and I wish to do something for future generations. I want to record what I've seen and heard, write down my insights, and pave a path for those who come after me, hoping they can go further than I did..."

This was the reason why the Overlord, even while heavily wounded and fleeing, still wanted to write down everything he had learned in his life.

In fact, he wrote down all his accumulated knowledge, but half of the manuscript was torn away by the elder, who, after reading it, crushed it into dust.

The blood-stained black beast-hide book currently before them was personally thrown out by the elder. He wanted to see who would study it, and whether the Overlord still had any relatives or disciples.

"A hundred years of vicissitudes, everything has returned to dust. The Overlord was left with only regret, his legacy severed. Yet that elder is still alive, high above all. In recent years, he has even begun to take on disciples again."

Qin Ming naturally dared not voice these thoughts aloud, merely sighing with emotion in his heart.

At the same cultivation realm, under most circumstances, people from the Outer Realms could suppress those on the Path of Rebirth. Yet the Overlord was able to defeat those above him in cultivation, which, in that era, many saw as "defying heaven."

An Outer Realm disciple spoke up, "Though the Overlord was brave, he ultimately passed away. Only a little over a hundred years have flowed by, and already not many people remember him. Yet that elder remains at the peak of his power. This is the difference between immortals and mortals."

Tang Xumi nodded, saying, "What you said makes sense. We must strive diligently, to reach the level of the predecessors as soon as possible, to approach immortality and seek truth!"

Then, he placed a two-inch tall small jade jar into Qin Ming's hand, saying, "Brother Li, are you injured? You can take this medicine to strengthen your vital energy, spirit, and essence."

"I'm fine," Qin Ming courteously refused.

Tang Xumi forcefully pressed it into his hand, implying: you're not fine.

Seeing Tang Xumi so enthusiastic, Qin Ming found it difficult to insist he was fine. This wasn't merely receiving a spirit medicine, but an acknowledgment and acceptance. Refusing further would be impolite.

Tang Xumi smiled slightly, "Brother Li, is this your first time in Luofu City? Let Junior Sister Li show you around those ancient thousand-year-old ruins; they are worth seeing. We'll be going now, so as not to disturb your enjoyment. Let's gather properly another day."

"Are all people from the Outer Realms so enthusiastic?" Qin Ming had a good impression of these elite disciples. Without them, he might not have even been able to access the Overlord's遗书.

"Tang Xumi's nature isn't bad, but he's not as simple as he appears. He's testing me," Li Qingyue said.

By this time, they had already reached the street, preparing to head to the ancient architectural district for a meal.

Li Qingyue said, "This jade jar is made of a special material and carries a strand of Tang Xumi's spiritual light of consciousness. Once it's in your hand, it will quickly merge into your flesh and blood."

Qin Ming was startled, but he didn't feel any discomfort. With his mind highly concentrated, his special resonance ability immediately activated, detecting a faint glow at the bottom of the jar.

"He doesn't know that I have cultivated a special Spirit Eye and saw that strand of light. He wants to see how long it takes for me to become aware after the spiritual light enters your body," Li Qingyue explained.

If she remained unaware, then after entering the spirit cave, Qin Ming would be used by Tang Xumi for pinpointing their location, allowing Tang Xumi to clearly sense him within a certain range.

Then, her expression changed slightly, and she said, "Your Heavenly Light Energy is very unique, one might even say incredibly powerful. It actually blocked his light of consciousness."

Qin Ming naturally knew what was happening. At his current stage, his Heavenly Light Energy was imbued with spirit, capable of automatically protecting his body. Not even a mosquito could approach his body, nor could a speck of dust settle on his hair.

"My Heavenly Light Energy is indeed extraordinary. If I carry the jar like this, I'm afraid I might accidentally disperse that strand of conscious light." He took out his Dragonscale Armor and temporarily wrapped the jade jar in it.

Qin Ming said, "And here I thought he was genuinely enthusiastic, trying to curry favor with you through me, believing him to be a simple, good person. I never expected him to plot against me."

Li Qingyue nodded, "To rise among the Outer Realm disciples, he certainly isn't a simpleton. He and I are both popular candidates to contend for the near-immortal artifact, so it's normal for us to test each other."

Qin Ming said, "Later, let's buy a slightly spiritual bird. After we enter the spirit cave, we can release it and let Tang Xumi go chase it like a young boy."

"That could work."

"Heh heh."

Subsequently, Li Qingyue gravely informed him that an abandoned disciple of Tathagata might have been invited this time, posing a significant threat to the golden-armored guards.

"A successor of Tathagata Energy?" Qin Ming was truly surprised. Ever since embarking on the Path of Rebirth, he had been very interested in this lineage, as he frequently heard people mention it, making it renowned.

Li Qingyue shook her head, "Not a true successor. It's said he was expelled right after only learning the basics, but I've heard he integrated other Heavenly Light Energy arts, and is still very formidable, capable of injuring people from the Outer Realms."

"An abandoned disciple of Tathagata who only learned the basics? I'd like to see that," Qin Ming said, then asked which other formidable individuals were among the golden-armored guards.

"Cui Chongxuan, that junior of yours, should not be underestimated. He cultivates the Six Imperial Heart Sutra. Once his energy arts achieve minor mastery, his power becomes very domineering, also capable of injuring people from the Outer Realms."

The Six Imperial Heart Sutra was a legendary manual that even people from the Outer Realms were somewhat wary of.

When he was at the Cui family, Qin Ming had been less than three feet away from that book, but he was not permitted to read it.

This time, Cui Chonghe was unable to participate because some old masters from the Outer Realms, after discussion, decided to only allow disciples who had entered within the last three years to compete.

Their reason was simple: conflicts among new disciples were controllable. Even if there were accidents, bloodshed, and casualties, it wouldn't cause significant losses for any of the families.

"If old disciples were allowed to participate, then we old masters might as well compete ourselves. That near-immortal artifact is currently special; it's most suitable for younger disciples."

When Cui Chonghe heard the news, he immediately went to his master, asking how he could be considered an old disciple.

Although his master was renowned throughout the Night Mist World, some individuals in the Outer Realms could contend with him, so the opposition had no effect.

Cui Chonghe greatly desired the legendary item in the spirit cave. Thus, he supported a junior fellow disciple, personally helping him seek out the Great Yin-Yang Medicine to enhance his strength.

In fact, for the sake of that item, Cui Chonghe even brought his own younger brother, Cui Chongxuan, whose Six Imperial Heart Sutra could injure people from the Outer Realms and even break others' Heavenly Light Energy!

Li Qingyue said, "This time, old disciples are not allowed to participate. There are also age restrictions on the golden-armored guards accompanying the new disciples, also requiring them to be youths."

Otherwise, some aristocratic family scions might dare to bring their elders along.

Qin Ming asked, "Even so, aren't some of these relatively young golden-armored guards at the Outward Saint stage?"

Li Qingyue nodded, "Most are just beginning to step into the Outward Manifestation Realm, while a few who cultivate special Heavenly Light Energy might still be in the Rebirth Realm."

"I won't be the lowest-ranked, will I?" He felt a bit ashamed.

Li Qingyue smiled faintly, "You started late, only just beginning on the Path of Rebirth, but Uncle Meng said you have boundless potential. This time, I'll protect you. You only need to act when countering Heavenly Light incursions."

Qin Ming was unsettled. He was temporarily serving as a golden-armored guard; how could he let Li Qingyue protect him?

The abandoned disciple of Tathagata, and Cui Chongxuan, who cultivated the Six Imperial Heart Sutra, could both injure people from the Outer Realms and break others' Heavenly Light Energy. Qin Ming felt that his own wasn't bad either.

The two ate some local delicacies, then headed back to their lodging.

"How can I let you see me off? I should be seeing you back to your inn first," Qin Ming said with some helplessness.

"There are many people from the Outer Realms here, with unpredictable methods. You haven't yet delved into the realm of consciousness, making you easily susceptible to being spied on. It's better if I see you back to your inn first," Li Qingyue said. As Qin Ming walked with her, they inevitably attracted the attention of some people.

With Meng Xinghai at the inn, she felt reassured, as long as nothing happened on the way.

Qin Ming was escorted back to the inn by the graceful and peerless Li Qingyue, which drew frequent, surprised glances from some of the young people.

After returning, Qin Ming began to study the Overlord's遺书. In the early stages, it didn't seem particularly outstanding, but upon reaching the Spirit Field Realm, complex changes appeared.

Although he couldn't practice it deeply yet, he already knew that this was a precious manual, immensely valuable, and something he should take seriously in the future.

In the courtyard, Qin Ming used a bronze staff to substitute for a large lance, wielding it like the wind, as if to cleave mountains and sunder seas, piercing through the night sky.

"This Wind Energy is quite special; it must have been integrated with other energy arts."

In the beast-hide book left by the Overlord, the early stages mainly focused on cultivating Wind Energy and Overlord Energy. Qin Ming had already begun practicing them overnight.

Over the next two days, Li Qingyue accompanied Qin Ming, exploring Luofu City, visiting various ancient ruins, and sampling many local delicacies.

During this time, Qin Ming also meticulously studied those two special energy arts, especially the peculiar Overlord Energy. He had already grasped extraordinary insights from it. Though unremarkable in its early stages, it was destined to become incredibly terrifying when combined with the Spirit Field.

"The early stages aren't difficult to cultivate; the challenge lies in the various transformations later on," Qin Ming said, having initially cultivated two types of Heavenly Light Energy.

"It's time to depart," Meng Xinghai said, pleased to see Qin Ming still cultivating diligently at the inn.

"Where's my golden armor?" Qin Ming asked. He had already put on his Dragonscale Armor, strapped twelve short spears to his back, brought his bow and arrows, and picked up his bronze staff.

"They're all at the Luofu Mountain Ruins," Meng Xinghai replied, accompanying him.

That day, Luofu Immortal Town was exceptionally lively. Disciples from various orthodox lineages had arrived, as well as those from Blessed Lands, with no small number of practitioners.

"Outer Realm disciples are gathered in Luofu Immortal Town. A fierce competition is likely to begin soon!" News spread to all regions.

Now, countless people were following this contest, which had been a hot topic for many days.

"No need to rush. We'll officially enter the Immortal Mountain Ruins and that spirit cave tomorrow morning," Meng Xinghai said.

Li Qingyue was called away by her sect members for various reminders and guidance.

Luofu Immortal Town was situated right next to the ruins. It boasted fire springs and numerous remnants of ancient structures, exuding a strong sense of history.

Qin Ming successively saw some familiar faces: Cui Chonghe, Wang Caiwei, Zheng Maoze, and others. Additionally, after more than two years, he once again saw Li Qingxu.

He didn't pay too much attention, returning to his room in the Immortal Town to play with a spiritual bird, quietly awaiting tomorrow's entry.
