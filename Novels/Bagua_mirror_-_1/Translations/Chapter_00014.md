# Chapter 14: Pingyang City

However, moments later, as a faint stinging sensation spread, streams of information began flooding Qin Chong's mind.

A full hour passed before Qin Chong fully absorbed all the information and organized it roughly. Yet his expression remained unusually grave.

After all, this was merely a Qi Refining sixth-level cultivator, so the information obtained wasn't extensive. But several key pieces made Qin Chong's scalp tingle.

The tree may crave calm, but the wind won't subside. He only wanted to cultivate in peace, yet external storms seemed determined to disrupt his tranquility. How could someone like him withstand such impending turmoil?

The three major sects of Yan Province were the Qingxuan Sect, Canglong Valley, and Chiyan Gate. Among them, Chiyan Gate was the most powerful, occupying two commanderies alone, while Qingxuan Sect and Canglong Valley each held one.

Qingxuan Sect and Canglong Valley had always been at odds. Though they dared not act overtly under Chiyan Gate's overwhelming pressure, covert conflicts were frequent.

Both sects sought to annex the other to become strong enough to rival Chiyan Gate.

The cultivator who had pursued Qin Chong was from Qingxuan Sect. This time, they had dispatched over a hundred members disguised as rogue cultivators into Canglong Valley's territory with one clear purpose—to stir trouble.

As a mere disciple of a minor family, how could he afford to get entangled in such sect conflicts?

Whether in his past life or this one, this weakling had already endured enough hardships. Yet life kept throwing chili peppers at him, as if dissatisfied with his blandness.

With matters having reached this point, Qin Chong had no choice but to focus on escaping his current predicament. Afterward, he would return to his family and dedicate himself to cultivation, striving to improve his strength as quickly as possible.

Leaving the stone chamber now might lead to another encounter with Qingxuan Sect members. It seemed he would have to hide here for a while. But since this person had found the place, others might follow the same trail.

Qin Chong returned to the pool's depths and began searching around.

After the time it took to drink a cup of tea, he dragged over a millstone-sized boulder to block the entrance, finally easing his mind slightly.

As long as the boulder concealed the faint glow of the restriction barrier underwater, even if someone dove in, they would struggle to find this place.

Back in the stone chamber, Qin Chong first incinerated the corpse before inspecting the newly acquired storage pouch. His eyes lit up with joy as he tallied the contents.

This Qingxuan Sect cultivator's possessions were far superior to Huo Yuanliang's.

There were over 450 low-grade spirit stones, a black flying sword (a mid-grade magical artifact), and an iron shield—also a mid-grade defensive artifact with an earth attribute, perfectly suited to his cultivation technique. Additionally, there were two or three low-grade artifacts.

Two bottles of Qi Gathering Pills, one bottle of Condensed Qi Pills, and even a single Harmonizing Qi Pill—a premium elixir used to break through Qi Refining bottlenecks, extremely rare.

The deceased had clearly been preparing to advance to the late Qi Refining stage, but now his preparations benefited Qin Chong instead.

Dozens of miscellaneous materials remained, including several mid-tier ones, along with over a dozen jade slips. One slip contained a detailed map of the entire Song Kingdom, with particularly thorough descriptions of Yan Province's regions.

In Pingyang City, obtaining a basic Yan Province map from a shop wouldn't be difficult, but such detailed versions were usually expensive. As for a complete Song Kingdom map, it was beyond Qin Chong's current means.

The other slips—containing cultivation techniques, secret arts, or records of anecdotes—also proved useful.

"Murder and arson line the pockets with gold." No wonder treasure hunting through killing was so common in the cultivation world. Just the gains from these two individuals alone would have taken him who-knows-how-long to acquire under normal circumstances.

For a fleeting moment, Qin Chong even considered deliberately hunting for treasures this way, but he quickly regained his senses.

As the saying goes, "Even thieves have their codes." How much more so for a cultivator like himself?

Qin Chong ended up hiding in the stone chamber for over three months. With the aid of the two Qi Gathering Pills, his cultivation actually advanced another level.

Anticipating future needs, he also used the Eight Trigrams Mirror's space to cultivate three mid-grade earth-attribute spirit stones.

The mirror's space possessed such incredible capabilities that, theoretically, Qin Chong could continuously produce mid-grade stones to exchange for low-grade ones, ensuring an endless supply.

But he understood clearly that recklessly displaying mid-grade stones at his current level would only invite trouble and covetous eyes.

With nearly 800 low-grade spirit stones already in his possession—enough for now—plus additional materials and herbs that could be traded later, Qin Chong considered himself quite wealthy for a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator.

"Greed leads to downfall." One's possessions must align with their strength. Exceeding that boundary would inevitably bring disaster.

Under cover of night, Qin Chong emerged from the pool. After carefully surveying his surroundings, he summoned his escape light and flew toward Pingyang City.

Silently, he prayed to avoid further complications.

What was supposed to be a two-month training excursion had stretched into over half a year.

Pingyang City, as the provincial capital, naturally hosted many cultivators. Yet most mortals living there remained unaware of their existence.

A cultivator might brush past you on the street or ask for directions without revealing their true nature.

Most visiting cultivators gathered in the city's northeastern corner, where markets—even underground black markets—operated.

Shops there were predominantly owned by Canglong Valley, with the rest divided among major families and renowned merchant alliances (though the latter maintained limited presence).

Familiar with the route, Qin Chong headed straight to the northern district and settled into an inn.

Before returning home, he needed to offload excess materials, acquire powerful artifacts, and stock up on pills.

Back at his family, he planned to enter seclusion and attempt breaking through to the late-stage bottleneck.

Despite recent dangers, his gains had been substantial, and his rapid cultivation progress would surely raise eyebrows. Thus, Qin Chong decided to conceal his advancement from his family until necessary.

At his current sixth-level Qi Refining stage, hiding his progress would be easy—unless his father or granduncle personally inspected him, which was unlikely.
