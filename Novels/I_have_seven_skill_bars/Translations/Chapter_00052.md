# Chapter 52: Life's Ups and Downs Are Too Fast

Everyone naturally had no choice but to agree. Although they were very reluctant to give up the days when they could be lazy, have more time to cultivate, and not have to spend too much spirit rice, Ding Rui's complete package of pest control and weeding was essentially a favor; doing it was an act of kindness, not doing it was simply fulfilling his duty. No one at this point would demand that Ding Rui continue doing it. But since that day, every spirit field cultivator in the Xuanfu Sect's spirit field area sighed, lamenting that their good fortune was over.

Another month passed. Ding Rui mastered the "Condensing Yang Art" and condensed two skills: [Condensing Yang Art] and [Condensing Yang]. Mastering his fourth cultivation method allowed Ding Rui to claim a reward of four hundred portions of spirit rice from the logistics department. One portion was a hundred grains of spirit rice, so four hundred portions amounted to a full forty thousand grains, which was even more than the reward he received after the previous harvest of Spirit Field 377. At this point, the spirit rice in Ding Rui's room was almost piled into a mountain; even his bed was covered with several large sacks of it. Looking at his cramped room, Ding Rui felt it was necessary to suggest to the sect that they establish something like a bank as soon as possible.

However, Ding Rui specifically applied to the logistics department to have all "Condensing Yang Art" cultivators sent away, and "Rain Dew Art" cultivators as well. He would complete all four tasks—rain application, weeding, pest control, and photosynthesis—by himself. So, since yesterday, Spirit Field 377 was left with just Ding Rui and two other "Earth Qi Art" cultivators, making a total of three people. Although Ding Rui's workload seemed immense, he knew that he would always have to face such a workload eventually. At this point, he only had one last cultivation method left. Once he officially became a spirit farmer, all the work in the entire spirit field would fall solely on him. So he was currently adapting. This was to avoid being as overwhelmed as Liu Yun later on. The last time Ding Rui went to find Liu Yun, he was startled by Liu Yun's appearance. Gone was the former senior brother's demeanor; the man looked like a dirt monkey. For the sake of his spirit field, Liu Yun had completely given up cultivation during this initial period, even compressing his eating and sleeping times to the extreme. Yet, even with all this, Liu Yun was still under immense pressure, saying he couldn't guarantee the first harvest of his spirit field, and was even considering spending some spirit rice to find other cultivators to help him manage it. He was simply too exhausted!

A phrase often on the lips of the Xuanfu Sect's spirit field cultivators was: "Enjoying the good life again!" However, last time it was the "Green Wood Art" and "Golden Radiance Art" cultivators who said this, and this time, it was all the "Rain Dew Art" and "Condensing Yang Art" cultivators. Ding Rui's name, along with his irreplaceable importance in the spirit fields, became a hot topic once again! For these spirit field cultivators, life's ups and downs were simply too rapid and too exciting. Naturally, this time there were also those whose business was disrupted by Ding Rui, much like Dongfeng previously. However, after the previous incident with the evil cultivator Yang Shou, and other events like the saddle and stirrup, Ding Rui's reputation and prestige in the entire spirit field had soared. No one dared to cause trouble for Ding Rui like Dongfeng had before. Moreover, these people also knew that Ding Rui's monopoly wouldn't last too long, and a significant number of them guessed that Ding Rui was doing this for his cultivation, so they weren't in any hurry.
