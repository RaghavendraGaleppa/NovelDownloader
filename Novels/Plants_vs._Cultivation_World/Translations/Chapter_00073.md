# Chapter 73: Testing the Medicine  

There was a time when Yao Shifeng's greatest desire was to rise from a menial disciple step by step to become an inner sect disciple. But in the end, he failed.  

Gu Mo, however, walked the very path Yao Shifeng had once dreamed of and successfully advanced from a menial disciple to an outer sect disciple. At that moment, Yao Shifeng's heart was filled with envy.  

But soon, Yao Shifeng suppressed his emotions and turned his gaze toward the cave dwelling behind him. After becoming He Shaogang's attendant, he finally understood what a true prodigy was.  

He Shaogang was the legendary genius Yao Shifeng had only heard of in stories. He felt that as long as he followed He Shaogang, his future achievements would not be inferior to Gu Mo's—perhaps even greater.  

Once his emotions had fully settled, Yao Shifeng took the intelligence he had gathered that day and headed into the cave dwelling. Collecting information for He Shaogang was one of his duties as an attendant.

**Formation Peak**  

"Gu Mo has become an outer sect disciple?" When Chu Feifei heard the news, her eyes flickered with both surprise and a sense of inevitability.  

"Senior Sister Chu, it's time to go!" A junior sister from Formation Peak called out to her.  

"Coming!"  

Chu Feifei responded and quickly ran over.  

Gu Mo had become an outer sect disciple, and she wasn't far behind. Now, Chu Feifei was already able to participate in Formation Peak's maintenance tasks for the sect's arrays.  

This was proof of her rapid progress in formation techniques over the past few months. In just a few more years, she would become a full-fledged formation master and advance to an outer sect disciple of Formation Peak under that title.  

This time, Chu Feifei was accompanying her senior brothers and sisters to inspect the arrays on Alchemy Peak. Perhaps she could find some time to share the news of Gu Mo's promotion with Hu Hai.  

She might even be able to gather everyone again to celebrate Gu Mo's achievement.

**Spirit Field Cottage**  

Gu Mo looked at the second second-tier Sunflower and smiled. After half a year of slow cultivation, the second one had finally advanced successfully.  

Of course, his goal was five second-tier Sunflowers, and achieving that would only take another six months.  

The more second-tier Sunflowers he had, the faster he could cultivate new ones. Therefore, in the next half-year, Gu Mo could easily upgrade three more.  

With five second-tier Sunflowers aiding his cultivation, he could quickly reach the peak of Qi Refining.  

Today also marked the fourth year since Gu Mo joined the Spirit Planting Hall. If he included his year as a menial disciple, he had been in Qinglu Sect for five years.  

If Yao Shifeng hadn't disbanded their team, Gu Mo would have gone to the market to meet everyone today. But alas...

**A Sudden Message**  

Just as Gu Mo was lost in thought, a message talisman suddenly appeared outside the spirit field's barrier. He took out the barrier control talisman and allowed the message inside.  

"Could it be news about the concealment array?"  

Grabbing the talisman, he saw it was from Chu Feifei. Gu Mo had previously asked her to help him acquire a concealment array.  

"Hmm."  

He channeled spiritual energy into the talisman and read the message. His expression immediately changed. He swiftly stored the Sunflower in his black mist space and then flew toward Alchemy Peak on his sword.  

The message was indeed from Chu Feifei, but Gu Mo wasn't heading to Formation Peak—he was going to Alchemy Peak.  

The message wasn't about the concealment array. Instead, it was about Hu Hai—he was in trouble.  

Though their small group had disbanded, the bonds formed over the years remained. If Hu Hai was in trouble, Gu Mo wouldn't stand by and do nothing.

**Alchemy Peak**  

After about half an hour, Gu Mo arrived at Alchemy Peak. If he were still a menial disciple, visiting other peaks would have been troublesome. But now, as an outer sect disciple and a spirit planter, he could move freely.  

Especially on Alchemy Peak—they would welcome him eagerly. Spirit planters were crucial partners for alchemists. High-quality spirit herbs cultivated by planters allowed alchemists to refine superior pills.  

Without any hindrance, Gu Mo arrived at the menial disciples' quarters on Alchemy Peak, where he found Chu Feifei, her face filled with anxiety.  

"What happened? Tell me everything."  

Gu Mo asked. The message talisman hadn't provided details, so he needed to understand the situation.  

Chu Feifei led him toward Hu Hai's residence while explaining what she knew.  

The situation wasn't complicated. She had taken advantage of a break during array maintenance to visit Hu Hai and discuss Gu Mo's recent promotion.  

After asking around, she found Hu Hai's residence, but the door was shut tight. She called out a few times but received no response. Unsure if Hu Hai was in seclusion, she didn't press further.  

Just as she was about to leave, she overheard other menial disciples mention that Hu Hai had recently taken on a pill-testing task for Alchemy Peak.  

Alchemy Peak's alchemists didn't just refine established pill recipes—they also experimented with new ones. Creating a brand-new pill could bring immense wealth to the alchemist.  

But new pills were untested. To understand their effects, test subjects were needed.  

Pill-testing was a high-risk task, but the rewards were equally high. Many menial disciples, tempted by the generous compensation, chose to participate.  

Hearing that Hu Hai had taken such a task, Gu Mo immediately understood the situation. Clearly, something had gone wrong with the pill test.  

But if the problem wasn't severe, Hu Hai wouldn't have avoided seeing Chu Feifei.

**Hu Hai's Condition**  

Soon, Gu Mo and Chu Feifei arrived at Hu Hai's residence. The protective barrier around it was now active—when Chu Feifei had come earlier, it hadn't been.  

This meant Hu Hai knew she was here.  

To enter now, they would either have to forcefully break the barrier or ask someone with higher authority to open it.  

Forcibly breaking it was out of the question—that would violate sect rules and earn them a trip to the Discipline Hall.  

Their only option was to seek out the Alchemy Peak supervisor in charge of the menial disciples' quarters.  

The process went smoothly. Gu Mo was now one of only three spirit planters in Qinglu Sect. If he were still a menial disciple, he might not have even been able to meet the supervisor.  

With the supervisor's help, the barrier was quickly deactivated. The supervisor entered first, and upon seeing Hu Hai's ashen face, he sighed in relief. After nodding to Gu Mo, he left.  

His duty was to oversee the menial disciples' quarters. If a disciple died mysteriously in their home, it would be a headache for him. But since Hu Hai was still alive, it wasn't his problem.  

As for Hu Hai's terrible condition—that was a consequence of taking the pill-testing task. Nothing to do with him.  

"Thank you, Senior Brother Zhang." Gu Mo clasped his hands in gratitude as the supervisor left. Then, his gaze turned to Hu Hai.
