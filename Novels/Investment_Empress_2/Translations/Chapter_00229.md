# Chapter 229: The Genius Ouyang, The Wanted Poster (1/2)

In the dead of night, the tavern was shrouded in silence, leaving only the rustling of leaves and the sound of water splashing in the courtyard.

Even the dogs were asleep at this hour, but Li Mo couldn't rest. He should have been cultivating with the Ice Cube right now, but that was impossible for him at the moment.

What man could withstand such a test?

After washing up with cold water to cool his head, he calmed down slightly and checked his system rewards.

**[You have two unclaimed rewards.]**

**[Congratulations, Host. You have received Investment Feedback: Secret Silver Creation Seal.]**

"This is the feedback from Yin Mianmian."

A small, cold, and mysterious seal fell into his palm, exuding a nimble and obscure aura.

Li Mo's expression turned slightly strange as he calmed down.

He had never truly seen the Extreme Form of Divine Intent. Even for a long-established sect like Hengyun Sword City, being able to observe the Upper Form was already considered excellent.

This showed that the Creation Seal lived up to its name; it could upgrade Divine Intent and seize the creations of heaven and earth.

The irony was that the feedback provider was a powerful enemy. One could only say fate was strange and creation was a cruel master.

"It's a pity I couldn't keep him today."

Compared to the reward, Li Mo was more concerned about being targeted by a powerful assassin.

He then checked the reward from the Ice Cube:

**[Congratulations, Host. You have received Investment Feedback: "Earth Store Fundamental Vow Sutra, Part One."]**

"A Buddhist sutra?"

Li Mo was slightly taken aback.

The Ice Cube had feedback many heavenly treasures and strange artifacts, but this was the first time for a scripture.

It was just right, as Li Mo was currently full of fire.

He took the sutra in his left hand. The words were all legible, but he couldn't understand their meaning at all. He only felt that the material was special, smooth and delicate to the touch, like fine brocade. The sensation was somewhat...

"Wait, what am I thinking?"

Li Mo scolded himself inwardly, thinking it might be more effective to use it together with the Sarira.

So he took out the White Jade Sarira.

The Sarira emitted a faint Buddhist light, its texture as warm and moist as top-quality mutton-fat jade, and it seemed to have a watery sheen...

It was as if the Hundred Fruit Heavenly Fragrance Oil had dripped onto...

A moment later.

Li Mo confirmed that he had no Buddhist roots and was destined to have no connection with Buddhism in this life.

"The aftereffect is too strong."

Li Mo clapped his hands, making his left hand slap his right to dispel the guilt in his heart.

The clap was quite forceful, making a loud sound.

*Slap—*

A window not far away was pushed open, and Ouyang, with a head of messy hair like a bird's nest, poked his head out.

"Junior Brother Li, I was almost asleep. Why aren't you sleeping at this hour?"

"I usually don't sleep."

"What do you usually do then?"

"Dual cultivation."

"......"

Senior Brother Ouyang's smile froze, and his eyelids twitched uncontrollably.

He knew Junior Brother Li wasn't lying.

So he clenched his fists even tighter, sweating profusely in the summer heat, trembling with cold fury.

"Then, Junior Brother Li, why are you in the courtyard today?"

"Cough, something just happened. I'm just... cooling off."

Li Mo didn't want to go into detail, because just thinking about it would cause trouble.

Did you have a fight?

Otherwise, why would he need to cool off?

Ouyang figured that was probably the case, so he didn't feel so bad anymore.

"Junior Brother Li, I just drew some 'good stuff.' Since you seem to understand art too, want to take a look?"

"Good stuff?"

Li Mo leaned back slightly.

Wait, Senior Brother Ouyang wasn't relying on side hustles for money anymore.

"Senior Brother, why are you back to your old trade? Did you run into some trouble?"

"No, didn't I say long ago, this is my hobby."

"......"

Looking at Senior Brother Ouyang's dark circles, Li Mo nodded.

"I can see it, Senior Brother. Your interest is indeed strong and your passion is deep."

"It's mainly to improve aesthetics. Let's exchange ideas and make progress together."

Ouyang took that as a compliment.

So, borrowing the pale moonlight, Ouyang spread out an album under the moon.

"What do you think? Be honest." He raised his eyebrows.

"Emmm, not bad?"

Li Mo was quite honest.

"?"

Ouyang glanced at the album, which featured figures with alluring bodies dressed in revealing outfits, feeling a bit confused.

"Junior Brother Li, you don't like this type? Wait a second..."

He flipped through the album.

"And this one?"

"Passable."

"This one?"

"Mediocre... I guess. It should be enough to challenge Brother Mu."

"Wait, Junior Brother Li, look again carefully. You call this mediocre?"

Ouyang's eyes widened. He stared intently at Li Mo, but found the latter's eyes were exceptionally clear, without a trace of being flustered or trying to act tough.

Junior Brother Li was genuinely unmoved.

The main reason was...

His aesthetic threshold had been raised by Ying Bing. Now, everything seemed inferior to the Ice Cube.

"It seems I can only use my latest creation!"

Ouyang suddenly channeled his true energy into the album.

Li Mo was taken aback.

In a daze, he actually saw the scantily clad figures in the album move, becoming even more lifelike!

They could move?

"Amazing, right? Hmph, I got inspired after seeing your comic book last time."

"If the Divine Manifestation Diagrams can move, then if I apply the technique of drawing Divine Manifestation Diagrams to this album, I can achieve the effect of a comic book!"

Ouyang raised his chin, his words resounding with conviction, as if he had made some incredible breakthrough!

"Animation!?"

Li Mo gasped.

Thinking of merging the technique for drawing Divine Manifestation Diagrams with realistic, appealing little picture books... he was indeed a rare genius!

But something still felt off.

"Shocked, aren't you?"

"I'm more shocked by your research direction, Senior Brother."

Li Mo shook his head and returned the album to Ouyang.

"But aesthetically, there's still room for improvement."

"??!"

Ouyang was petrified on the spot. The words echoed in his mind like a thunderclap out of nowhere.

Aesthetics... still room for improvement?!

...

The next morning.

The sky was bright and clear, without a cloud in sight.

On the mountain path of Hengyun Sword City, Li Mo held a hot donkey meat bun in his hand, eating as he walked. Ying Bing was not far beside him, her head slightly lowered as she walked slowly with her sword in her arms.

The two of them remained silent the entire way.

Jiang Chulong, holding onto the hem of Li Mo's clothes, watched with her grayish-white eyes, a flicker of confusion within them.

Today, the atmosphere between Big Brother Li and Sister Ying was a bit strange...

It was as if there was something between them that she couldn't see.

Not long after, a fork in the road appeared ahead, and there were noticeably more Sword City disciples. A few people were walking towards them, seemingly heading out for external affairs.

"The Shadowless Pavilion has just settled down, and there's trouble again."

"Yeah, you'd think that after becoming a traitorous general, he'd run south to the Southern Frontier, but instead, he's wandering around our Yunzhou."

"Hope they can capture him soon and bring him to justice, so he doesn't cause any major chaos."

"Young Master Li, Fairy Ying?"

The few men who were going out to post notices greeted them. By now, they were quite famous in the Sword City.

Li Mo had spent a fortune to donate for the repair of the Sword Pool's formation.

Ying Bing had lectured at the Sword Pool and was revered by countless people as a fallen fairy.

Even the little girl with the cloth strip over her eyes had gained the attention of all the elders, who were willing to openly display the Sword Pavilion's legacy for her.

After a brief exchange, Li Mo also got a clear look at the wanted poster.

Chang Bolong.

Sixth Heaven of the Inner Scene Realm, a traitorous general of the Southern Army. Anyone who discovers his whereabouts and provides information will receive a reward of five hundred taels of silver. Anyone who captures or kills him will receive five thousand taels of silver and may enter the Sword Pavilion to choose a martial art.

Such a reward would surely attract many bounty hunters.

Li Mo wasn't very interested in the bounty; he just glanced at it casually.

Soon, they arrived at the fork in the road.

Li Mo was going to the Sword Pavilion, while Ying Bing and Jiang Chulong were going to the Sword Pool, so they had to part ways.

"What do you want for dinner tonight?"

"Just buy whatever."

"Okay..."

Li Mo walked forward a few steps, then, as if possessed, turned his head back.

He then saw the graceful figure of the Ice Cube.

He couldn't help but laugh at himself. It wasn't like they were parting for a long time.

So Li Mo strode towards the Sword Pavilion.

He didn't know that the moment he turned back around, the girl, brushing a strand of black hair behind her ear, suddenly looked back from the steps, capturing the figure of the boy, who was walking with his head held high, in her eyes.

Ying Bing's gaze lowered for a moment before she continued towards the Sword Pool.

Princess Jiang blinked.

Something was definitely off...
