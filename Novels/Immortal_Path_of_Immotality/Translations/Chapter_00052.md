# Chapter 52: Fellow Practitioners in the Capital

"Yichuan!"

This was the second immortal cultivation market Lin Shan had heard about! He immediately pressed for more details with eager impatience.

Immortal Huang sighed and slowly explained the situation in Yichuan, which was quite similar to what the Guangnan Wanderer had described about Yinchuan—comparable in both scale and foot traffic.

Lin Shan quickly asked about Yichuan's location. Immortal Huang didn't withhold the information, telling him it was situated somewhere in the Yan Mountain Range and explaining the method to enter and exit the market's protective formation.

Seeing Lin Shan's eager expression, Immortal Huang still advised him against going alone. The northern Yan region was far from peaceful, with rogue cultivators often resorting to robbery and murder.

"But how did you go there, old brother?"

Lin Shan was skeptical. Immortal Huang was only at the early Qi Refining stage, seemingly weaker than himself.

Immortal Huang hesitated for a moment. Considering he didn't have many years left and that the Grand Elder seemed to hint at keeping Lin Shan to replace him in the Nightingales, he decided to share his past experiences to help Lin Shan avoid pitfalls.

It turned out that Immortal Huang had only obtained a rogue cultivator's inheritance at the age of fifty, barely reaching the Qi Refining stage. After three years of cultivation, he reached the peak of the third layer of Qi Refining but hit a bottleneck. He estimated it would take him twenty years to break through.

Lin Shan was stunned—this was the first time he'd heard of someone cultivating so slowly! Both he and the Guangnan Wanderer had taken only a year and a half. Truly, there was always someone with worse talent.

Immortal Huang ignored Lin Shan's expression and continued. Back then, with no other choice, he had to travel in search of opportunities. That was when the Nightingales' Grand Elder took notice of him—he glanced at the elder, who remained expressionless, sipping tea.

The rest was predictable. The Grand Elder hired Immortal Huang as a retainer at the market rate of five spirit stones per year.

At this point, Lin Shan's expression darkened. If Immortal Huang was worth five stones, why was he only getting three?

The Grand Elder coughed awkwardly but, being old and thick-skinned, merely chuckled.

Unaware of the tension, Immortal Huang continued. Before completing a year as a retainer, he heard from fellow rogue cultivators in the capital about the northern immortal market, Yichuan. Excited, he resigned immediately and rushed there.

But when he reached the Yan Mountain Range, he couldn't find the entrance. Another rogue cultivator offered to guide him, only to deceive him terribly.

---

That man led Immortal Huang to Yichuan and convinced him to take out a loan—yes, even the immortal world had loan sharks!

Immortal Huang, being penniless, thought he had nothing to lose. If someone wanted to kill him, they could have done so in the mountains—why bother bringing him to Yichuan? So, he fell for the scam.

But that rogue cultivator turned out to be a trafficker—specifically, a trafficker in the immortal world! After spending the loan within a month, Immortal Huang couldn't repay the mounting interest and was forced into a twenty-year indenture.

For the next two decades, he became part of the immortal world's slave market, serving other cultivators like a lowly servant. After his term ended, his master—perhaps deeming a seventy-year-old no longer useful—released him.

From then on, Immortal Huang's story mirrored the Guangnan Wanderer's: drifting from job to job until he had no choice but to return to the mortal world.

Shamelessly, he went back to the Nightingales and the Grand Elder. After vanishing for twenty years, he still had the audacity to return! Though displeased, the Grand Elder reinstated him as a retainer.

Since then, Immortal Huang abandoned his cultivation dreams, indulging in worldly pleasures for another twenty years.

---

After hearing this, Lin Shan was speechless. Not only were there traffickers in the immortal world, but Immortal Huang had even dared to take a loan! Truly reckless.

Still, the story served as a warning—the immortal world was far more treacherous than he'd imagined, with low-level cultivators often seen as prey.

But Lin Shan was determined to go.

Seeing he couldn't dissuade him, Immortal Huang gave the Grand Elder a helpless look but offered Lin Shan another piece of advice.

"Every ten years or so, a small group of cultivators in the capital travels to Yichuan to trade. You could join them—safety in numbers."

Lin Shan's eyes lit up. "How soon?"

"Within a month," Immortal Huang said urgently. "I'm going this time too. I can take you along."

A month was manageable, and traveling with others would indeed be safer.

Still, Lin Shan had reservations. "What cultivation levels are these fellow practitioners?"

Immortal Huang chuckled. "Don't worry. Those lingering in the mortal world are mostly at the early or middle stages of Qi Refining. Late-stage cultivators usually stay near spirit veins, striving to reach perfection and seize the slim chance to break through to Foundation Establishment."

He then took out a stack of paper talismans from his pouch, whispered something, and sent them flying out of the hall.

Lin Shan watched in amazement.

"Messaging talismans," Immortal Huang explained, stroking his beard. "Cheap—one spirit stone buys a hundred. They can fly to a designated location within ten miles, though they can be intercepted."

Lin Shan then asked how many cultivators were in the capital.

Immortal Huang hesitated. "Openly, maybe thirty or forty. Including those in hiding, seventy or eighty?"

"That many?"

Lin Shan suddenly felt the capital wasn't so safe after all.

The Grand Elder chimed in, "The capital houses the headquarters of major factions. The Nightingales hide in the Earl of Bowang's estate, while other noble and even princely mansions have their own forces. Many can afford to retain immortal masters."

Lin Shan thought of the Song Dynasty's most powerful faction—the imperial family.

"What about the royal family? They must have even more immortal masters."

The Grand Elder and Immortal Huang exchanged grave looks.

"They don't need retainers. The royal family was established with the support of the immortal sects. Three major sects take turns stationing Foundation Establishment cultivators in the palace. No one dares trespass."

Lin Shan's heart sank. Foundation Establishment cultivators in the palace? So much for his fantasy of sneaking a peek at the imperial concubines bathing.
