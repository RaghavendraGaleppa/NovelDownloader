# Chapter 122: Departing from the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven

"Take you away?"

Zhang Jing looked at the being before him in surprise, his tone questioning as if seeking confirmation.

"The Myriad Gods Treasure Vault?"

The infant-like figure nodded repeatedly, its gaze carrying a trace of pleading as it looked at Zhang Jing.

"But..." Zhang Jing's expression turned troubled. "I'm afraid I can't do that."

Seeing this, the being—known as Infant Lord—hastened to explain, realizing Zhang Jing had misunderstood:

"Zhang Jing, you can! Since you've grasped the fundamentals of the 'Great Dao of Celestial Immortality,' you'll definitely be able to take me away from here. Of course, I don't mean now, but in the future when you're capable."

So that's what it meant?

But how could Infant Lord be so certain that Zhang Jing would one day have the ability to take it out of the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault? Just because he'd comprehended the Primordial Beginning World? 

Could it be... these nine inheritances held another significance?

A flicker of doubt passed through Zhang Jing's eyes.

Opposite him, Infant Lord continued explaining eagerly.

"Ever since I gained consciousness, I've been stuck here, never once leaving. By your human reckoning, it's been over two hundred thousand years."

"Zhang Jing, I truly want to see the outside world."

"I want to see the blue skies, white clouds, rainbows, little birds, and grass you speak of—to know what they really look like."

"Two hundred thousand years? All spent in the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault?"

Zhang Jing stared at Infant Lord in astonishment.

Now he understood why the being clung to its 'transformation blocks,' playing with them almost incessantly without progress yet never giving up.

"Yes! I really want to go out and see."

Infant Lord gazed at Zhang Jing with pitiful eyes.

As if afraid Zhang Jing might refuse, it quickly added:

"I'm very capable—talisman crafting, pill refining, artifact forging, I can do it all! Once we're out, Zhang Jing, I'll do whatever you ask without complaint."

Seeing the hopeful expression on Infant Lord's face and recalling how it had helped him before, Zhang Jing felt an unexpected stir of compassion.

After a moment of contemplation, he spoke seriously:

"Infant Lord, I don't know why you're so certain I can take you out someday. But I promise you this—if I ever gain the ability, I will bring you out of here."

"Really?" 

Joy instantly bloomed on Infant Lord's face as it threw its arms around Zhang Jing's leg, crying out happily:

"Zhang Jing, you're truly a good person!"

Time flowed steadily within the Myriad Gods Treasure Vault.

---

Zhang Jing suddenly stood up, his gaze turning outward.

The time had nearly come.

"Take care, Infant Lord. I must bid you farewell for now."

He clasped his hands in salute.

"Zhang Jing, don't forget to come back for me!" 

Infant Lord's eyes brimmed with tears.

"I won't forget!"

As the words faded, Zhang Jing's figure vanished from the spot.

---

Outside, the various courtyard masters and pavilion leaders had already risen from their meditation cushions, their solemn gazes fixed on the tightly sealed gates of the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven.

"The time has arrived!"

Dragon Lake Courtyard Master murmured, a glimmer of anticipation flashing in his eyes.

One Golden Nature Dao Foundation, and another future Golden Nature Dao Foundation.

This opening of the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven had brought tremendous gains to their Dragon Lake Dao Academy.

As he pondered this—

BOOM!

The massive gates of the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven began slowly parting, streaks of rainbow light continuously flashing forth.

The lights touched down on the ground, transforming into figures wearing expressions of excitement, disappointment, or world-weariness.

The first to emerge were naturally the outer courtyard disciples from the First Void Heaven.

As time passed, the figures appearing on the open ground gradually became Foundation Establishment cultivators.

More and more people gathered.

Yet not a single voice broke the silence.

Every cultivator present—whether outer courtyard disciples or inner courtyard members—kept their eyes riveted on the gates, as if collectively awaiting something.

Among the crowd, Shen Qingqing quietly made her way to where the Dragon Lake outer courtyard disciples had gathered.

Instantly, spiritual senses began stirring.

"Congratulations, Fairy Shen, on comprehending Dao Intent! You'll surely rank among the True Spirit List's great figures in the future."

"Congratulations, Junior Sister Shen... no, Senior Sister Shen now! With Dao Intent comprehended, the immortal path lies open before you!"

Hearing this, Shen Qingqing couldn't help but offer a bitter smile.

"Senior brothers flatter me too much. Compared to Senior Brother Zhang Jing, my meager achievements aren't worth mentioning."

"Haha, Junior Sister Shen, why compare yourself to that monster?"

"If we follow your logic, the ones who should feel worst right now are our inner courtyard senior brothers."

A male cultivator from the Rosy Clouds team at the tenth level of Qi Refining laughed heartily as he comforted her.

Hearing this, Shen Qingqing's smile gradually brightened.

"You're right, senior brother. I was being too narrow-minded."

At that moment, Chen Xiandao approached.

Seeing Shen Qingqing's radiant demeanor, he forced a strained smile onto his despondent face.

"Congratulations, Fairy Shen."

Observing his dispirited appearance, Shen Qingqing couldn't help but offer consolation:

"Brother Chen, don't be disheartened. Failing to comprehend Dao Intent isn't the end—look at Chief Nong of the Spirit Dao Pavilion. He didn't comprehend Dao Intent initially either, yet still established a superior Dao Foundation and made the True Spirit List."

"Moreover, I heard from Senior Sister Qin Nian of the Divine Thunder Dao Academy that the Upper Realm will reopen in about one hundred eighty years. Before then, the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven will open once more. That will be your best opportunity!"

"And besides—" 

Shen Qingqing's eyes curved with amusement as she continued comforting him:

"Look at that monster Senior Brother Zhang Jing. Even he has to wait like the rest of us for the Upper Realm's opening in one hundred eighty years."

"Thank you for your kind words, Fairy Shen."

Chen Xiandao's face twisted into something between a smile and a grimace.

The logic made sense.

But the bitterness remained!

As their spiritual sense conversation continued—

BOOM!

The entire plaza suddenly erupted in commotion.

Realizing what was happening, the two immediately turned their attention to the gates.

Four streaks of rainbow light slowly emerged, landing directly beside the assembled courtyard masters and pavilion leaders before transforming into human figures.

Among them, one clad in cyan robes stood out conspicuously.

Whispers immediately reached Shen Qingqing and Chen Xiandao's ears.

"That cyan-robed one—isn't that that freakish Junior Brother Zhang Jing?"

"Tsk—"

"Truly terrifying. I heard he fully comprehended Dao Intent in just nine months. Such comprehension talent... he's practically born for immortality!"

"Indeed. Who knows where Dragon Lake Dao Academy found him."

"Heh, I heard Junior Brother Zhang Jing comprehended the Lunar Dragon Python Dao Intent, which perfectly matches my cultivation method. Perhaps..."

"Senior brother, I'm starting to think our decision to avoid Junior Brother Zhang Jing might have been... rash."

Hearing this, Shen Qingqing and Chen Xiandao could only exchange bewildered glances.

Inner courtyard seniors had been actively avoiding Zhang Jing inside the Myriad Gods Miniature Void Heaven?

They could scarcely imagine what kind of overwhelming pressure this senior brother Zhang must have exerted on the inner courtyard members!
