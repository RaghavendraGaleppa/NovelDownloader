# Chapter 86: The Last Sect Master of the Witch Ghost Dao

Grandmaster Ting You's aura was still rising, but Lu Yang remained calm, because he knew very well that the other party's state was actually not much different from his own.

They had lost their physical bodies, leaving only their souls. Their combat relied entirely on the rank amplification brought by their great divine abilities. They were invincible against weaker opponents, but once they encountered an opponent of similar rank, their disadvantage would become apparent.

The reason they were evenly matched now was purely because Lu Yang had also done it. To cultivate into a [Corpse Dissolution Immortal], his physical body was still in a state of "death and subsequent transformation," making his condition only slightly better than Grandmaster Ting You's. However, since he dared to take the initiative and come to their door, he naturally had full confidence.

"Nine Heavens Capital Register Secret Demonic Yin Thunder!"

Grandmaster Ting You's expression turned cold. He uttered a Daoist incantation, and with a hand seal, thunder instantly erupted in the void, lightning flashing and striking down upon Lu Yang.

This time, Lu Yang did not resist head-on. Instead, he silently activated a sword art, manifesting a sword light beneath his feet. At the same time, he summoned the Blood Sun Sword Pellet to fly a hundred *li* away, then split off another sword light, and finally, using the "Divine Firmament Sword Control True Art"'s sword light displacement technique, he instantly appeared a hundred *li* away.

Boom!

With a loud crash, Lu Yang saw the lightning strike the City of the Dead below, instantly pulverizing several districts and unleashing a sea of corpses and blood. Yet, from the sea of corpses and blood, not a single soul emerged; they had all been completely annihilated!

"Lightning magic specifically counteracting souls."

Lu Yang's eyes narrowed slightly. Thunder was originally the most Yang and rigid substance in heaven and earth, but when pushed to its extreme, it could reverse, and the most Yin and soft energy could also give birth to immense thunder. Grandmaster Ting You's "Nine Heavens Capital Register Secret Demonic Yin Thunder" was clearly such a divine ability. He likely saw through Lu Yang's true state, which was why he targeted it specifically, attempting to defile his soul with this lightning magic. If he were struck by it, he would probably lose this fight.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang once again divided his sword light, scattering it in all directions.

"Sword escape technique?"

Grandmaster Ting You looked over, but scoffed, "While the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion's sword escape is indeed the fastest under heaven, any divine ability must have a counter-method. How could my Witch Ghost Dao not understand this path, having clashed with the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion multiple times in the past? Furthermore, you don't seem particularly proficient in swordsmanship. How dare you show off such petty tricks before this Seat?"

Having spoken, he extended a finger. Where his fingertip pointed, rolling dark light surged forth, overwhelming the sky and earth. Upon closer inspection, they were all Witch Ghosts, their numbers in no way inferior to Lu Yang's sword lights! Each Witch Ghost closely followed a sword light.

And when Lu Yang once again used his sword escape to leave the battlefield, he saw Grandmaster Ting You also form a hand seal, then swayed his body, similarly vanishing from his original spot. The next second, as Lu Yang emerged from a sword light, the Witch Ghost next to that sword light also changed its form, revealing Grandmaster Ting You's figure!

Boom!

The next second, another Yin Thunder struck down directly. In the nick of time, Lu Yang shook the Myriad Spirit Banner in his hand, and hundreds to thousands of Five Thunder Talismans immediately flew out from the banner, then activated simultaneously, transforming into a brilliant Yang Thunder, which collided violently with the Yin Thunder in mid-air.

"Talismans?"

Grandmaster Ting You frowned upon seeing this, but quickly relaxed. "Though a bit troublesome, how many do you have? It's still just a drop in the bucket...?!"

His voice abruptly stopped. Because the next second, Lu Yang completely unfurled the Myriad Spirit Banner. Streaks of talismans flew out from it, instantly covering more than half of the sky and earth!

In his previous life, with the aid of the Clear Dao Jade Slip, Lu Yang had already advanced his talisman arts and array formations to the limit of the Qi Condensation realm, reaching the seventh rank. Coupled with the Myriad Spirit Banner's industrial production line enhancement, he directly formed arrays with talismans, shifting and transforming, instantly activating the power of heaven and earth within a hundred *li*. Not only that, array patterns also lit up around the City of the Dead.

For a moment, flying lights and streaming flames, wind and thunder rolled across the sky, firmly enveloping the entire City of the Dead and trapping Grandmaster Ting You right in the center of the array!

"Did you really think I came uninvited, having done nothing?"

When dealing with an old senior, Lu Yang had come prepared. Long before he arrived at the City of the Dead, he had already set up a grand array around it. The moment the array activated, it immediately unleashed earth-shattering power.

In the past, Lu Yang, relying on a single "Blood Washing Heavenly River Sword Array Diagram," could resist a Great Perfection Qi Condensation expert with only an eighth-layer Qi Condensation cultivation. The amplification of combat power by arrays was undeniably significant. Grandmaster Ting You naturally understood this, and his expression instantly changed. He then formed a hand seal, attempting to escape the array's range.

"Hmph, trying to escape?"

Lu Yang waved his sleeve, and the sword lights he had previously split off immediately rolled back and attacked. Previously, to track Lu Yang, Grandmaster Ting You had made every Witch Ghost follow a sword light. Now, he had lifted a rock only to drop it on his own foot. In the blink of an eye, the sword lights swept away the Witch Ghosts still lingering outside the array. Without the Witch Ghosts as a medium, Grandmaster Ting You naturally couldn't escape through space. He could only watch with an ugly expression as he fell into the array's encirclement.

Lu Yang gave a cold smile upon seeing this, and immediately activated a spell. In an instant, the array shifted, countless talismans vibrated in unison, and wind, thunder, water, and fire poured out, submerging Grandmaster Ting You's figure.

If it were just a simple array, Grandmaster Ting You wouldn't have feared it. But the one controlling the array was Lu Yang, amplifying it with his own rank, making it a truly deadly method. When the wind, thunder, water, and fire dispersed, Grandmaster Ting You reappeared, his previously dazzling soul brilliance significantly dimmed.

"Good, good, you little junior!"

Grandmaster Ting You's hair was disheveled, his eyes filled with grimness as he whispered, "I truly didn't want to expose it, but it seems there's no other way now."

Before his words faded, his aura suddenly changed! He formed a hand seal, and the Xuanming Netherlord apparition behind him expanded once more. The [Yama Hall] became increasingly real, and eight treasured thrones successively appeared.

"Return to your positions!"

A chilling demonic sound spread in all directions. The next second, Lu Yang saw eight crimson streaks of light that had just escaped into the distance now flying back. Within the streaks of light, the utterly terrified faces of the eight elders of the Ting You Sect were reflected. Lu Yang immediately activated the array to try and intercept them, but they seemed to be in another dimension, ethereal and unstoppable, arriving beside Grandmaster Ting You in a blink of an eye.

"Black and White Impermanence, Civil and Military Judges."

"Ox-Head and Horse-Face, Day and Night Roaming Gods."

Each time Grandmaster Ting You uttered a name, an elder would land on one of the treasured thrones manifested by the [Yama Hall], until all eight elders were seated—

Boom!

Grandmaster Ting You, transforming into the Xuanming Netherlord apparition, directly took the main seat in the [Yama Hall]. The entire [Yama Hall] instantly seemed reborn, tens of thousands of ghosts roaring, each performing their duties, as if a true Underworld had descended upon the human realm, instantly breaking free from the talisman array Lu Yang had set up!

Almost simultaneously, above the sky, a sword hummed! The sword hum echoed, carrying an unmatched, vast divine consciousness, causing everyone who heard it to involuntarily conjure a scene in their minds.

It was a cliff reaching to the heavens and standing on the earth. On the cliff, an heroic young man in a Daoist robe sat cross-legged, gazing towards the north bank of the river, a magic sword resting before his knees. Then, he pointed two fingers northward and slashed:

"Witch Ghost Dao Master, the primary evil must be slain!"

Clang! Clang!

The next second, all images vanished. Lu Yang only saw a sharp sword light; it was none other than the Golden Core Sword Qi within the secret realm, finally awakened!

At this moment, Lu Yang finally understood Grandmaster Ting You's identity.
