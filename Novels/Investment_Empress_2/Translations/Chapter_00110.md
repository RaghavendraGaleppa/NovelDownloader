# Chapter 110: "Divine Form Chronicles," a Senior Brother Who is Four Thousand Years Old?

The sixth floor of the Scripture Pavilion.

There were very few people here. The space between the massive bookshelves was vast and empty.

Light, slow footsteps echoed.

This was Li Mo’s second time on the sixth floor. The first time was when he retrieved the *Sun Wheel Sword Manual*. He had been somewhat surprised then by how many books were stored here.

"Will there be Divine Observation Diagrams here?"

Li Mo stopped in front of a bookshelf.

This area was filled with illustrated books.

The fifth floor was already filled with high-level martial arts. The contents of the sixth floor must be even more core and precious.

Li Mo was quite curious about the Divine Observation Realm.

So, he casually picked up an illustrated book.

Unlike other illustrated books, this one was spotless, clearly frequently flipped through.

Not many people could come to the sixth floor. They were either true disciples, elders, or those who had made significant contributions to the sect.

Even they frequently browsed this illustrated book.

"The contents recorded within must be extraordinary."

Li Mo看清了画册的名字.

*Eighteen Odes of Yin and Yang*

Li Mo: "!"

Just looking at this grand and imposing title, it wasn't simple!

His luck was quite good. He had just come to the Scripture Pavilion and already found a treasure.

He flipped to the first page, which read:

*'Lust is the first trial for a young man—Ouyang.'*

Ouyang?

Is this the author of this illustrated book?

"One must cultivate the heart before observing the divine. That makes sense."

Li Mo was stunned for a moment, then nodded.

However, when he flipped to the actual diagrams, he couldn't help but fall into deep thought.

The content was a bit... NSFW.

To be honest, the drawings were quite good, even the details were in place. In two words: vividly realistic.

Li Mo realized something was wrong and frowned as he flipped to the last page.

There was also a sentence there:

*'A man remains a youth until death—Ouyang.'*

"So why did the Imperial Uncle have to choose such a high-sounding name!"

"And why couldn't he just say it all at once? One sentence at the beginning and another at the end."

Corner of Li Mo's mouth twitched.

Even a novelist who cliffhangers wouldn't dare to do it like this.

This author had some skill, just like his surname without the radical (a play on words implying he's a pervert).

Shoving *Eighteen Odes of Yin and Yang* back, he picked up other books to browse.

Illustrated books as improper as this one were relatively rare.

But true Divine Observation Diagrams were also few, and they didn't touch upon the core high-level, let alone supreme, techniques.

Thinking about it, that made sense.

Those were mostly the signature skills of the elders of various peaks, unlikely to be placed here.

But Li Mo did see some interesting things.

"Great Yu Martial Emperor observed the Heavenly Fate Dao Tool, the Map of Rivers and Mountains, using the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths as the scene, allowing descendants of later dynasties to observe the Great Sun's Divinity, in hopes of the dynasty's eternal prosperity."

This was from a history book named *Divine Form Chronicles*.

It even had a vivid illustration of the Heavenly Fate Dao Tool, the Map of Rivers and Mountains.

Of course, it only had its form, not its spirit.

This was already quite impressive. Being able to copy its form meant the author had at least seen the real thing.

According to the records, the Map of Rivers and Mountains was a type of Divine Form.

Li Mo grew a bit interested. He flipped to the next page and saw a diagram of a bronze divine tree.

*'Bronze Fusang, the Heavenly Fate Dao Tool of the previous Great Shang Dynasty. It was roosted by a hundred birds, possessing many divine wonders. Observing it could condense the divinity of the Vermilion Bird, Azure Luan, Blood Phoenix, Golden Crow, and other hundred birds. It was shattered during the Yu destruction of Shang and its whereabouts are unknown.'*

"This would be quite suitable for the Ice Cube."

Li Mo read with great relish.

Everything recorded here was 'Divine' Forms, spanning two dynasties, all with detailed accounts, as if the author had personally experienced them.

He flipped to the author's name:

Han Zhen.

Never heard of him.

"I wonder what form I will observe and what divinity I will condense when the time comes."

Li Mo reluctantly put the book down.

---

He was a bit confused about this aspect.

Someone like Murong Xiao, with the Ming蛟 bloodline, would find it easier to condense divinity by observing forms like flood dragons.

Similarly, those with physiques like a tiger's back and a bear's waist would find it easier to achieve both form and spirit by observing tiger or bear forms.

This is the importance of physique in the path of martial arts.

Li Mo still didn't understand what kind of physique he had and what method would be suitable for him to enter the Divine Observation Realm.

No wonder the elders, who had watched him climb the Ascending Heaven Stairs to the top, were all hesitant to take him as a disciple.

"When the boat reaches the bridgehead, it will naturally go straight."

"With the Ice Cube and Princess Jiang Chulong, I'm not afraid of not finding something suitable for me."

Thinking of them, Li Mo couldn't help but feel reassured.

For now, he needed to go pick out sword manuals to feed Jiang Chulong.

He himself was also walking the path of 'Skill Approaching Dao'.

Hmm, forced to...

Although he still very much wanted to be a dashing and handsome swordsman, he was truly lacking in martial arts comprehension.

The *Lotus Bloom from Karmic Fire* consumed too much comprehension.

He only had about seventy years left.

It was too much for hammer arts, but too little for the sword path...

But there was no other choice. He had to farm the investment feedback.

Finally, Li Mo took a few decent sword techniques.

Three, all fine examples among high-level sword techniques.

Li Mo was just holding the sword manuals, preparing to go register them.

"Li Shidi."

Li Mo turned back, looking puzzled.

Who called him?

"Li Shidi!"

The person jumped, and Li Mo finally saw him clearly.

An old acquaintance.

"Xiao Bao Shixiong," Li Mo greeted with a smile.

Before even entering the Qingyuan Sect, he had met this Senior Brother Tang Xiaobao once, at Xue Jing's clinic.

During the Nine Peaks Martial Tournament, he had also voluntarily jumped off the stage, bringing a perfect end to the rumors that he had thrown a match.

Right now, he was standing on his tiptoes, trying to reach a book on the shelf, but he was still too short.

It was said that Senior Brother Xiao Bao was born with a deficiency and couldn't grow tall, always maintaining this childlike appearance, as if carved from jade.

That's why, although his surname was Tang, no one called him Senior Brother Tang.

Wasn't Senior Brother Xiao Bao at the Jade Liquid Realm?

"Li Shidi, could you trouble you to get that book on the third row to the left for me?"

"Sure."

Li Mo took it down and found it was a classic text related to pill refining.

"Finally got it."

"Now there's hope for me to enter the Mysterious Pill Realm."

Tang Xiaobao hugged the book, very happy.

"Senior Brother Xiao Bao, this is a pill refining book, you didn't grab the wrong one, did you?"

Li Mo thought he was taking this classic to learn about pill refining.

"Hehe, for me, it *is* a book for practicing cultivation."

Tang Xiaobao said with a smile.

Seeing Li Mo's confusion, he thought for a moment before speaking.

"Anyway, Li Shidi isn't an outsider, I'll tell you. This is something only my master and I know about."

"I'm not human."

Li Mo: "?"

Senior Brother Xiao Bao, please don't do this.

We were having a good conversation, why did you suddenly start insulting yourself?

However, seeing the serious look on the other's face, Li Mo couldn't help but raise an eyebrow.

You're not joking?

He activated his Heavenly Fate Divine Eye.
