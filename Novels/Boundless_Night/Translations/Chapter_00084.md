# Chapter 84: A Little Stronger Than the Variants

By the river, the two were still sparring, their movements ceaseless, only conversing when they drew close.

Qin Ming had previously said that he didn't shoot Ning Siqi down from the sky out of past friendship, but rather out of respect for someone else. This was clearly not the truth. Had it been anyone else, he would have long since blown them apart with an arrow, without uttering a single word. In fact, when Ning Siqi saw his flying mount struck by an arrow, he was indeed frightened, almost crying out to tell Qin Ming not to get serious. Only when he realized Qin Ming merely intended for him to fall into a mud pit did he hold back.

"I've researched the Hall of Loyalty and Trust. People like Ge Qianxun deserve to die, so I arranged for him to be dealt with," Ning Siqi said. Before coming here, he had already sent a message to Meng Xinghai, ensuring Old Ge's demise. Still, he was somewhat uneasy, and as the hidden employer, he personally came to the scene.

"Among our old acquaintances, Zheng Maorong is the most ruthless. While he won't get directly involved, a single glance or hint from him will set others to work on his behalf." Ning Siqi warned him to be wary of certain people. Qin Ming understood, well aware of Zheng Maorong's nature. Second Master Cui had, when drunk, once blurted out "the truth": that Cui Chonghe possessed near-immortal potential and would be taken as a disciple by an elder renowned throughout the Night Mist World. Qin Ming, having been the center of attention because of this, wouldn't be surprised by anything that happened once his halo was shattered. What's more, some people had harbored enmity towards him from the start.

"One of my cousin Wang Caiwei's paternal cousins is the most foolish," Ning Siqi actually cursed one of his more distantly related cousins. He whispered, "Zheng Maorong has a strong agenda. He's subtly fanning the flames with malicious intent, possibly hoping to use you as a line to provoke the true Cui Chonghe from the Outer Realm. But my short-sighted cousin wants to personally hire someone to kill you, believing that by eliminating you, your past with Wang Caiwei will be completely erased, leaving no trace. He must have been bewitched and driven mad, not considering that doing so would only create more talk afterward. Of course, he could also be rotten to the core and intentionally..."

Qin Ming listened silently, learning various hidden details to prepare for potential future troubles.

"As long as I advance quickly enough on this path of Rebirth, these people and matters will simply be scenery along the way, possibly fading away before I even have a chance to see them clearly," Qin Ming said. To thank Ning Siqi, he sent him into the mud again.

"There shouldn't be any Spy Birds nearby!" Ning Siqi, being a germaphobe, found this filth somewhat unbearable.

"Your perception isn't enough," Qin Ming said, then asked about Ning Siqi's path of Rebirth with concern.

Ning Siqi replied, "I've reached my limit with seven Rebirths. My family prepared a high-grade spiritual substance for me, but it couldn't trigger an eighth Rebirth." To advance further, he would need to consume grand medicines and step into the domain of Manifested Heavenly Light. While seven Rebirths was an ultimate dream for others, it wasn't enough for Ning Siqi. If he were to enter the Outer Saint level with such a foundation, his prospects within his clan would be unclear. Qin Ming frowned upon hearing this.

Ning Siqi continued, "Over the past year, my father has taken me to visit the six great Secret Sects. One path among them suits me very well. After the regional unified examinations are completely over, I will travel far. I don't know when I'll see you again after that, because that path often requires entering special territories, approaching certain extraordinary 'phenomena'. So, coming here this time is also a farewell."

Qin Ming expressed concern, "Secret Sects ultimately deal with terrifying creatures akin to deities. While it's a powerful path, it's also very dangerous."

Ning Siqi shrugged it off, "You'd only attract the attention of such terrifying creatures after reaching the peak of cultivation yourself. There's no danger in the early stages." Then he smiled again, "In the future, if I have the chance to reach the peak and get targeted by god-like beings, you can come and save me then. From now on, you'll have to fight tooth and nail. We'll meet at the summit!"

"Alright, if you ever need anything in the future, just send a message," Qin Ming nodded, then sent him into the river.

Ning Siqi came ashore, face dark, and finally warned, "Even if you are now a young Variant, you must be cautious. Thousand-year-old aristocratic families certainly have them too."

"You don't know the full extent. I'm actually a bit stronger than other Variants my age," Qin Ming admitted, having held back before.

Ning Siqi was instantly greatly astonished. Based on his understanding of his old friend, that "bit" surely wasn't simple. Had he surpassed the level of young Variants? He warned, "Never become complacent. Those from the Outer Realm begin by activating the power of consciousness to advance, whereas our path of Rebirth is far too simple and rustic."

As if remembering something, he said, "Oh right, Li Qingyue has begun to shine brightly in the Outer Realm. And Li Qingxu also seems extremely formidable, making his teacher immensely satisfied, saying that for him to enter the Outer Realm in his teens is perfectly suitable, no need to rush. This is the greatest affirmation for him, and it's also hinting at something."

"Competition in the Outer Realm is fierce," Qin Ming remarked.

Ning Siqi said, "Of course, different factions are constantly vying. By the way, the atmosphere among the most outstanding disciples in the Outer Realm has been tense recently. Many are saying that they are competing for a legendary item, which, if acquired, could bring them close to immortality in the future and influence their entire lives. On that path, a group of core disciples are actively preparing for battle, all eager to obtain it. Some of our old friends will likely get involved as well."

"Their world sounds quite spectacular," Qin Ming felt a touch of emotion.

"There are other territories that are actually very splendid too; you just haven't had the chance to approach them. You should join a powerful dao tradition, or enter a special high-level academy to experience it firsthand. Secret texts need to be thoroughly studied, and this world also needs to be experienced and understood."

Finally, Qin Ming, carrying a mud-splattered Ning Siqi, entered the City Lord's Manor. This outwardly "hot potato" needed Meng Xinghai to "send away." This wasn't difficult; the "performance" just needed to be convincing.

"Take care!"

"You too, take care. We'll meet at the summit!"

In the end, Ning Siqi departed.

***

In the purple-bronze censer, a calming incense, capable of extinguishing restlessness and brushing away the dust from one's mind, slowly burned.

Meng Xinghai sipped his tea and said, "You truly astonished me. To blast an experienced master apart with just three hammer blows and two palms — and that was with you holding back."

This time, Qin Ming didn't act humble. "Ge Qianxun may be old, but he certainly doesn't count as a master. By the way, Uncle Meng, he was a Gold Thief."

Meng Xinghai nodded, "I've already sent people to interrogate him." He looked at Qin Ming and asked, "What level has your physical Rebirth reached?"

"I've undergone Rebirth four times. I'm a bit stronger than the Variants described in books," Qin Ming informed him.

Meng Xinghai abruptly rose. Such information made his heart uneasy. He meticulously scrutinized Qin Ming, then finally chuckled, "What a pity, I don't have a daughter."

Qin Ming also chuckled.

Meng Xinghai sighed, "Such talent already approaches the near-immortal potential of those from the Outer Realm. But it's a great pity that our path cannot reach immortality; what we cultivate is completely different from theirs." After his initial shock, he felt deeply, "You truly gave me a surprise; you're even more outstanding than I imagined."

He stood up, pacing back and forth in the quaint living room, finally placing his hand on a large bronze cauldron, and said, "When you get back, stop practicing those messy, low-level Heavenly Light Arts. I'll help you find a relatively rare secret tome soon." Qin Ming realized that after demonstrating his unique value, Old Meng indeed relied on him more, already beginning to make arrangements for him.

Meng Xinghai said, "During this Rebirth stage, ordinary people don't research it thoroughly, but thousand-year-old aristocratic families know very well that it's best not to undergo more than five bodily mutations within a year, otherwise it will affect your future path."

Qin Ming was startled. Would his plan for rapid rise be restricted?

Meng Xinghai asked, "You should have felt it, right? Every mutation brings countless benefits, not to mention feeling like you've returned to the womb. But there are also other discomforts in the short term, requiring a period of adjustment. Those are the accompanying side effects."

"Uncle Meng, I don't feel anything," Qin Ming shook his head.

Meng Xinghai tapped a chimes, "Your situation, surpassing young Variants, isn't unheard of in ancient texts. I once saw a document discussing this condition. You should be fine even with six Rebirths in a year. Actually, there's no need to rush. The Rebirth stage is when we make the fastest progress; there's no need to accelerate further."

But Qin Ming felt that time was pressing, and he was unwilling to delay even a single day. He believed he truly had no problems. Other books mentioned not casually fusing Heavenly Light Arts, insisting they had to be compatible, yet the silk manuscript encouraged it. Most crucially, the silk manuscript contained no mention of being limited to five or six Rebirths per year.

Meng Xinghai said, "Don't be impatient. Recently, you should cultivate peacefully. I've asked someone to prepare some higher-grade spiritual substance for you..."

Qin Ming didn't retort. While he wanted to display his strength, he couldn't reveal certain core secrets.

He returned to the inn to tally his spoils. In Ge Qianxun's pouch, there were a total of 421 Daytime Gold pieces. This wealth was quite astonishing, but it seemed a bit meager for his status as a Hall Master.

"This old fox definitely has more than one den," Qin Ming concluded. As a Gold Thief, he must frequently visit distant strongholds. Most importantly, he had no family or dependents in this area.

Ge Qianxun had five books on him. Three of them were for new cultivators of the Hall of Loyalty and Trust, and surprisingly contained some cryptic language, which Qin Ming wasn't interested in. The fourth book recorded a hammer technique from the Sun family. Unfortunately, it was of little use to Qin Ming as he had already fully mastered it.

"Vajra Armor?" Qin Ming flipped through another ancient book that could resonate with his spirit. It was bound with unknown beast hide, clearly an ancient artifact with signs of significant wear, yet the emotional fluctuations it carried were still intense. Without a doubt, it was the crystallization of the predecessors' painstaking efforts!

"A hard qigong technique that greatly increases defense, and can also be used for offense." Qin Ming quickly scanned it and realized this cultivation method was truly not simple. No wonder Ge Qianxun was filled with resentment. With this hard qigong technique, entering the Outer Saint domain would have been no problem for him, but his foundation was shattered when he was only at minor accomplishment.

"A swollen body indicates it's not yet perfected. At an advanced stage, one can ignore sword and saber slashes, and upon full mastery, the body's appearance will be no different from an ordinary person's." Qin Ming had a premonition that this cultivation method was formidable. Highly interested, he focused intently, fully immersing himself, resonating with the residual emotions.

He saw an old man who ignored the overwhelming attacks of variant birds, casually swatting them to make the mutated creatures explode. The scene shifted; the old man used his physical body to ram a massive variant turtle into pieces. Next, Qin Ming saw him battling a gigantic beast like a small mountain. Heavenly Light erupted all over his body, and he used his physical form as a weapon, crashing into the beast's body and passing through its heart.

"This is... truly hard!" he exclaimed in admiration. The old man appeared extremely emaciated, yet his body was as hard as vajra, displaying an aesthetic of brute force. He charged fearlessly, unstoppable by any monster.

During this period, Qin Ming left the inn once, quietly retrieving the secret text Ning Siqi had left for him. "Very advanced. It can cultivate special 'Departing Fire' even in the early stages. Quite difficult, most suitable for training in the Thunder-Fire Alchemy Hall!" Qin Ming temporarily put it away. He realized that this was an extraordinary art, its value immeasurable.

For the next few days, he fully devoted himself to practicing that hard qigong technique. The book contained only one Heavenly Light Art — Vajra. Without a doubt, it was a composite art, exceptionally domineering, truly a marvelous body-protection technique.

A few days later, Qin Ming tried it. He swelled up significantly, like an inflatable object; that was the Heavenly Light flowing, expanding his muscles and skin. "Only at minor accomplishment, it can't block powerful attacks yet, but it can slightly alter one's appearance." Qin Ming looked at himself in the mirror. With his efforts, his face had rounded out, and his body had plumped up a bit.

Two more days passed. He studied the terrain map of the great mountain and decided to enter alone. Although Meng Xinghai told him not to rush and to wait, he always felt that time waited for no one and that he had to become stronger as quickly as possible to survive better. Ning Siqi had also used connections to send a message to Cui Hao in the Outer Realm. If Uncle Cui Seven were to emerge, it should be able to change Qin Ming's dangerous situation. But he didn't pin his hopes on others; becoming stronger himself was his true confidence. Besides, what if Cui Hao didn't receive the message, or remained in seclusion? Then his situation wouldn't change at all.

This time, Qin Ming applied makeup, affixed a bushy beard, and wore loose clothing. He didn't carry his large hammer, only his Mutton Fat Jade Iron Saber, as he entered the mountain. In some areas of the great mountain, fiery mist filled the sky, utterly beautiful, as fire springs were fully reviving, bubbling forth. In some areas, not only were plants sprouting, but flower buds were also about to bloom.

"Hmm, that thief?" Qin Ming had no mind for scenery. Not long after entering the mountain, he spotted a grey-clad figure, the one who had previously snatched the Snow Lotus from him, Xu Sheng, and Sister Fangfang. With a whoosh, he immediately gave chase. The grey-clad figure was highly alert, sensing him instantly. He turned and plunged into the forest, extremely familiar with the mountain, turning left and right, very elusive.

When he chased to a lake area, Qin Ming found a variant beast in the distance, glowing purple all over. It had just emerged from a steaming lake, admiring itself in the water, a picture of self-admiration. "Aren't Violet Lightning Beasts rare variants? How come I've encountered two recently? Is this species about to proliferate?"

Qin Ming was as fast as lightning. He dashed over from behind and mounted the variant beast. "You've been temporarily conscripted by me! Go quickly, help me chase someone!" The Violet Lightning Beast, now having undergone four mutations, had just been blissfully enjoying its hot spring bath. But now, its entire being felt terrible; this wasn't the first time it had heard that accent!
