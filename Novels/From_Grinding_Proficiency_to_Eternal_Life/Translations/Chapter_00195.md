# Chapter 195: The Prohibition of Martial Arts Decree

Zhao Duanhai’s iron spear tore a bloody path through the chaotic army, its tip piercing the throats of three heavily armored infantrymen.

Just as he was about to flip the fourth tower shield away, the cold gleam of a battleaxe劈向 his face.

The moment his spear shaft crossed to block the blow, the blue bricks beneath his feet exploded into dust, and his knee joints emitted a grating, teeth-clenching friction sound under the immense pressure.

"Seeking death!"

Tuoba Lie suddenly sank his waist and sat his hips, transitioning his axe movement from a chop to a drag. Zhao Duanhai was pulled forward, stumbling, as the spear shaft scraped against the blood groove of the battleaxe, sending out a string of sparks.

The next instant, in the gap between the old force expiring and the new force rising, Tuoba Lie’s great axe crashed down.

Looking at Zhao Duanhai, whom he had split in two, Tuoba Lie let out a disdainful sneer.

"A mere Blood Transformation Realm dares to..."

He abruptly raised his giant axe, his expression indifferent.

"The Great Qian Prohibition of Martial Arts Decree: Commoners are forbidden to practice martial arts privately. Martial ambition is akin to minting copper coins without authorization. If one severs their own meridians before the midnight hour, they may avoid the punishment of being torn apart by chariots!"

Tuoba Lie’s voice rolled through his throat like muffled thunder, instantly echoing across the city wall.

"Go to hell, you bastard!"

A white-haired old martial arts master, holding a great saber, hacked down a Great Qian soldier who had climbed up, and spat toward Tuoba Lie.

Tuoba Lie’s eyes flashed sharply, and the blood energy around him billowed like mist,缭绕 around his body.

"Kill!"

The city wall suddenly trembled violently.

The Iron浮屠 Cavalry began their charge; the sound of the fully armored warhorses’ hooves striking the ground was like a heavenly thunder knocking at the door. The leading rider squeezed his legs tight against the horse's belly; the scaled warhorse was squeezed so hard it foamed at the mouth, while the rider's thigh muscles pushed the iron armor into hideous protrusions.

The spears thrown by the Northern Liang warriors struck the horse armor, the shafts snapping into three pieces under the recoil.

Tuoba Lie stepped over the corpses to leap onto the city tower; the trajectory of his battleaxe formed a net of cold light in the air.

The old headmaster of the Northern Liang martial arts hall blocked with his ring-headed saber. When the blades collided, the muscles in his arms bulged like the twisted roots of an old tree, yet the bricks beneath his feet cracked like a spider's web.

The axe blade slid down three inches along the saber body; suddenly, the steel spike at the end of the axe handle shot out like a viper's tongue, killing him instantly.

When the setting sun dyed the blood flags a dark red, the Northern Liang city walls were already covered in axe chisel marks.

Tuoba Lie undid his chest armor, revealing a body full of scars. Every wound displayed the terrifying regenerative power of his muscles; the chest muscles slashed open by the spear tip curled back and healed, while the gap left by the斩马刀 was squeezed into a thin line by his knotted back muscles.

Thirty siege ladders were raised simultaneously at the bottom of the city, while his battleaxe was chopping the last resisting Northern Liang dead warriors like mincing meat, each swing bringing up a mist of blood mixed with bone fragments.

Suddenly, Tuoba Lie stood on the crenel and looked back at a hill six hundred zhang outside the city, where several figures in black clothes stood.

He split his mouth open, revealing cold white teeth, pointed his giant axe at them from afar, and drew a line across his throat with his other hand, then paid them no further attention.

"Arrogant!"

The Seventh Elder of the Nine Shine Sect clenched the fist in his sleeve, making a cracking sound; the veins on his body jumped like the collision of gold and jade. Just as he was about to charge forward, he was pressed back by the Grand Elder's withered palm.

The old man tapped the mouth of the long sword at his waist.

*Clang!*

The long sword automatically unsheathed three inches; a visible Sword Qi instantly shot out, crashing toward Tuoba Lie's brow center. The speed was as fast as thunder and fire, and before Tuoba Lie could even react, he was struck by this Sword Light, forced back three steps with a sound of metal striking metal, and sat down on the ground with a thud.

Tuoba Lie flew into a great rage, but was forcefully pulled back by the tall general following closely beside him, preventing him from advancing.

The Grand Elder's eyes brightened slightly, somewhat surprised that the other party was unharmed.

"Let the killing aura of this Dragon Scale Guard be nurtured a bit more. The spiritual energy of the heavens and earth is rare these days; let it brew for three more days to refine the Sword Pill for my sect."

The sneer beneath the Third Elder's玄 iron mask shook the pine needles loose. He lightly flicked the scabbard at his waist with his finger; the sea of clouds at the mountain peak split apart in response, causing the bodies of the Great Qian soldiers on the city wall to pause.

"The Nine Shine Stars have not yet arrived; the general's head is temporarily lent to this brute's skin."

The words, wrapped in broken snow, crashed toward the city wall, but upon touching Tuoba Lie's armor, they strangely condensed into ice spikes. A strange force instantly rushed into Tuoba Lie's body, but was washed away by the blood within him and quickly dissipated.

"So it is True Blood."

The Third Elder was somewhat surprised and shook his head gently.

"The Great Qian values bloodline over the Dao of Martial Arts; practicing martial arts privately within its borders is like being burned by fire. They are abandoning the root for the branch."

"Let us leave for now. Since that Empress does not wish to intervene, let the Yanbei Dao City send troops. My Nine Shine Sect needs to preserve its strength; we will cooperate slightly. With the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth rising, we need to seize the time to open the Nine Shine Secret Realm. The Xuanzhen Sect has indeed seized a good opportunity."

Watching the several figures on the hill leave like phantoms, Tuoba Lie couldn't help but suck in a cold breath.

Those two strikes just now had shaken him until he saw stars.

"Such lawless, unbridled scoundrels should be the first to be eradicated."

The tall, thin general beside him carried a hint of gloom and a bit of mockery on his face: "This Great Zhou is merely a name remaining in existence; the actual rulers are these various sects."

"They are very strong." Tuoba Lie rubbed his brow; if it hadn't been for his True Blood emphasizing the toughness of his body and physique, and if it had been someone else, they would likely have been torn in two like paper.

"That is why my Great Qian attacks mountains and breaks temples, prohibiting all martial arts among the people."

The tall, thin general turned, looking at the smoke-filled city interior, where cries, wails, and battle shouts intertwined like a movement. The heavy cavalry of the Dragon Scale Guard were using斩马刀 to flatten the eaves of the ancestral hall; the sound of broken tiles falling and blades entering flesh actually formed a resonance of energy.

The general let out a satisfied hum from his throat, as if listening to a drum of iron and blood: "On the day the King's flag插遍 the Six Dao and Seventy-two States, what is the Dao of Martial Arts..."

He closed his eyes enjoyably, listening intently: "Since my Great Qian has arrived, these sects, these martial artists, will naturally be washed away clean."

In an underground chamber in the Divine Weapon Ridge, Zhan Yan, bare-chested, his hair and beard bristling, held a heavy hammer covered in flesh scraps. Behind him, a group of women and children huddled silently.

The knotted muscles on his back surfaced with the patterns of the Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength; at every bulge of muscle, wisps of strength flowed like blood snakes.

However, there was a extremely gruesome blood wound on his chest, which he forcibly closed by writhing his muscles.

Only when temporary safety was achieved did he turn his head to look at the sturdy old man beside him.

It was precisely the old man Xu Yunfan had met at the mountain gate when he went to the Divine Weapon Ridge.

"Junior Brother, I didn't expect you to still be alive!"

Zhan Yan's expression was a mix of shock and joy; this was Lu Cheng, his junior brother from the Divine Weapon Ridge back in the day.

His expression was complex; the face that once radiated vitality, which made the female disciples of the Divine Weapon Ridge's Medicine Valley stare intently, and caused the threshold of the courtyard to be worn down several times by matchmakers.

Now, the hunched old man, with his tattered lapels fluttering, looked so aged and decrepit; how could one see the grace of the flowing clouds and wide sleeves of the past?

That was once the face of the Divine Weapon Ridge, welcoming and seeing off guests; how many female disciples from other sects had secretly cast glances of affection.

He rolled a sound of metal and stone from his throat: "They said you were buried in the Weapon Burning Pool of the Divine Weapon Ridge; I didn't expect you to still be here, only..."
