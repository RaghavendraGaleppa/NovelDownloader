# Chapter 108: The Eighth Void Heaven  

One and a half months later.  

At the summit of Tongtian Mountain, the abyssal sky seemed within reach.  

The bone-chilling gales howled like blades, ceaselessly lashing against the iron-hard mountain rocks.  

The extreme environment left no room for any form of life.  

Yet at this very moment—  

A flash of light streaked across.  

Zhang Jing's figure abruptly appeared.  

The fierce gales struck him, yet they felt like nothing more than a gentle spring breeze, merely lifting the corners of his robes and a few strands of his raven-black hair.  

A jade talisman materialized before his eyes.  

**[Moonlight Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (83/1000)]**  

A complicated expression flickered across Zhang Jing's face.  

Two months!  

He hadn't expected to linger in the Seventh Void Heaven for a full two months.  

"As the Void Heaven tiers increase, the speed of gaining spiritual essence has greatly improved, but the strength of the guardian spirits on the Heavenly Staircase has also grown increasingly terrifying," Zhang Jing mused.  

"Perhaps the time spent in the higher Void Heavens will be even longer. I can only hope that the inheritance I sensed earlier is in the Ninth Void Heaven."  

For some reason, he suddenly felt a lack of confidence about reaching the Tenth Void Heaven.  

"Should I first accumulate experience for the Pure Origin Breath Visualization Technique? Once the skill evolves into a Dharma Seed, its effects will far surpass the original skill traits. The speed of comprehending Dao Intent should improve significantly."  

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed thoughtfully.  

But when he considered the amount of spiritual essence required—  

Never mind.  

He dismissed the idea.  

At his current rate of spiritual essence accumulation, he couldn't afford the River of Time Sand needed to upgrade his skills.  

All of it had to be devoted to comprehending the Moonlight Dragon Serpent Dao Intent.  

Otherwise, it would be a waste of several months.  

Zhang Jing couldn't afford to be careless—after all, only six months remained before the closure of the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven.  

Regaining his focus, he took one last look at the magnificent Tongtian Mountain.  

It was a pity that even after two months here, he hadn't encountered a single senior from the Inner Court.  

Zhang Jing glanced at the Spiritual Essence Ranking, which clearly showed that seventy-nine Inner Court disciples were in the Seventh Void Heaven.  

"Perhaps the mountain is just too vast," he thought regretfully.  

The next moment, a several-zhang-long obsidian dragon emerged and soared straight toward the distant ninth step of the Heavenly Staircase.  

As time passed, tranquility returned to the Seventh Void Heaven's Heavenly Staircase.  

---  

The obsidian dragon had vanished without a trace.  

Suddenly, as if by prior agreement, seventy-nine auras flickered to life across various corners of Tongtian Mountain.  

At the mountainside, a purple-robed man exhaled in relief as he watched the overwhelmingly powerful dragon's aura disappear. A relaxed smile spread across his face.  

"Finally, he's gone. No more awkward encounters."  

"These past two months, hiding my aura while hunting spirit beasts has been quite restrictive."  

Indeed, long before Zhang Jing had even entered the Seventh Void Heaven, the Inner Court disciples there had noticed his abnormally rapid progress on the Heavenly Staircase. Naturally, they began worrying about how to face him if he ever arrived.  

Their presence in the Seventh Void Heaven was proof enough of their strength. Even the weakest among them had mastered three or four perfected Dao Rhythms—seniors whom other Inner Court disciples would respectfully address as "elder brother."  

If they were to meet Zhang Jing, a junior, wouldn't it be utterly embarrassing?  

It might even shake their Dao hearts.  

Thus, a certain "genius" came up with a solution:  

If Zhang Jing truly entered the Seventh Void Heaven, they would simply avoid him—out of sight, out of mind!  

At worst, their efficiency in hunting spirit beasts would drop slightly.  

This was why Zhang Jing hadn't encountered any of his senior brothers.  

It wasn't because Tongtian Mountain was too large—it was purely because they didn't want to see him.  

---  

Meanwhile, in the Eighth Void Heaven, near the Heavenly Staircase—  

Two bright streaks of light flashed into existence.  

As the radiance dissipated, two purple-robed figures stood quietly. Their faces revealed them to be none other than Liu Lizhi from the Inheritance Pavilion and Yang Bai from the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing will be here soon," Liu Lizhi said with a faint smile.  

A complex expression flickered in his eyes—anticipation, melancholy, and even a trace of regret, all intertwined into a profound sigh.  

In contrast, Yang Bai's face was brimming with joy.  

He had been the first to advocate for reaching out to Zhang Jing early and inviting him to join the Thousand Techniques Pavilion.  

Looking back, how wise that decision had been!  

What?  

Zhang Jing wasn't pursuing the path of formation talismans but rather the True Dharma?  

Did that matter?  

As long as he was part of their Thousand Techniques Pavilion, nothing else was important.  

"With just over six months left, let's see how far Junior Brother Zhang Jing can go!" Yang Bai thought excitedly.  

He no longer felt surprise at Zhang Jing's arrival in the Eighth Void Heaven—only anticipation and curiosity.  

Just how far could this monstrous junior go?  

Before long, an obsidian dragon surged out from the void, materializing in the Eighth Void Heaven.  

"Moonlight Dragon Serpent Dao Intent!"  

The same thought flashed through Liu Lizhi and Yang Bai's minds.  

Immediately, the two stepped forward in unison to greet him.  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, it's been a while."  

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, welcome to the Eighth Void Heaven."  

On the other side, Zhang Jing retracted the Five Treasures Spirit River and turned toward the voices. A smile tugged at his lips.  

"Junior greets Senior Brother Liu."  

Then, his gaze shifted to the other purple-robed figure.  

Before Zhang Jing could speak, the man introduced himself with a smile:  

"Junior Brother, I've long admired you. I am Yang Bai. It was I who sent Junior Brother Qiu to invite you to join the Thousand Techniques Pavilion."  

So that was the case.  

Understanding dawned in Zhang Jing's mind.  

"Junior greets Senior Brother Yang."  

Yang Bai hastily reached out to support Zhang Jing's arm, saying warmly,  

"Junior Brother, you flatter me. We should treat each other as equals. In the future, I may even have to address you as Chief Senior Brother!"  

"Haha, Junior Brother Zhang Jing, no need for formalities," Liu Lizhi chimed in. "Your arrival in the Eighth Void Heaven already places you on equal footing with us. As Junior Brother Yang said, treating you as an equal is already our privilege."  

Unable to refuse, Zhang Jing reluctantly agreed to their request.  

After some more pleasantries, under the guidance of the two senior brothers, Zhang Jing was led toward the gathering place of the Dragon Lake Dao Academy.  

He had originally intended to challenge the Heavenly Staircase first, but that would have to wait.  

There would be plenty of opportunities later.  

---  

Time flowed like a quiet stream.  

A month passed in the blink of an eye.  

In a land of rolling mountains—  

"ROAR!"  

A savage roar suddenly erupted, sending transparent shockwaves rippling outward. The ground was torn open, revealing jagged rocks beneath as towering ancient trees collapsed in succession.  

The source of the sound was a towering, bear-like spirit beast standing on its hind legs like a small mountain, exuding an aura of primal ferocity.  

Its eyes gleamed with a sinister light, and its thick fur was a deep crimson.  

"Haha, Junior Brother Zhang, what luck! To encounter a treasure spirit beast on your turn!"  

Opposite the bear, Liu Lizhi laughed heartily.
