# Chapter 405: Severing the Monkey of the Heart and the Horse of the Mind, Capturing the Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends

The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was currently incredibly rich. Although it could not compare to the spirit-gathering cave dwellings rented on the Hundred Desires Peak, for the barren Divine Martial World, this place was no different from the Immortal Realm.

Xu Yunfan let out a breath, exhaling a mouthful of turbid qi that had accumulated in his chest. As it condensed, it actually formed an arrow of breath that lingered in the courtyard for a long time without dissipating.

He stood up and stretched his limbs, preparing to loosen his joints and bones.

According to the Foundation Establishment requirements in the *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra*, he still needed to reconstruct the Three Treasures of Essence, Qi, and Spirit; sever the Monkey of the Heart and the Horse of the Mind; practice the Heavenly Spirits and capture the Earthly Fiends. Only by step-by-step pushing his will and body to the extreme could he then use the Martial Dao Mystic Crystal to forge his Dao Foundation.

Xu Yunfan had already easily completed the stage of reconstructing the Three Treasures of Essence, Qi, and Spirit. After breaking through the shackles of the Ninth Realm and achieving the Land Immortal Realm, this was naturally already accomplished.

As for severing the Monkey of the Heart and the Horse of the Mind, to be honest, for Xu Yunfan, who practiced the *Kan* Mantra, it was simply too easy. In the *Kan* state, the Monkey of the Heart and the Horse of the Mind provoked by Foundation Establishment could be extinguished in an instant.

The only difficult hurdle was practicing the Heavenly Spirits and capturing the Earthly Fiends.

The Thirty-Six Heavenly Spirits are ethereal and hard to find; they cannot be obtained without a Cavern Heaven or Blessed Land.

The Seventy-Two Earthly Fiends are deep and dangerous; one must go deep into the Nine Hells to have a chance of seeing them.

These Heavenly Spirit and Earthly Fiend auras are all innate primordial origins left over from the beginning of the heavens and earth. Each one can be called a Foundation Establishment opportunity.

The Heavenly Spirits are clear, ethereal, and lofty. For example, 'Purple Thunder Heavenly Spirit' must be guided at the core of a thunderstorm, and 'Mysterious Ice Heavenly Spirit' can only be gathered from beneath the ten-thousand-year-old glaciers of the extreme north.

The Earthly Fiends are Yin-turbid and violent. 'Nine Hells Yin Fiend' requires going a thousand zhang deep into the earth's veins, and 'Burning Heart Earthly Fiend' needs to be tempered in volcanic magma.

Every time one refines one, the physical body undergoes a rebirth. At the very least, one needs to prepare one Heavenly Spirit and one Earthly Fiend to forge a flawless Dao Foundation.

Even more rare is that Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends mutually generate and restrain each other.

To obtain the 'Azure Dark Heavenly Spirit,' one must pair it with the 'Mysterious Yin Earthly Fiend' to harmonize it. To obtain the 'Scarlet Flame Earthly Fiend,' one needs the 'Cold Marrow Heavenly Spirit' to neutralize it.

With the slightest error, the lighter consequence is the destruction of the meridians, while the heavier consequence is the death of the body and the scattering of the soul.

Back in the day, the Primordial Origin Sect had a genius who collected twenty-four Heavenly Spirits but failed to find matching Earthly Fiends. In the end, his body exploded, and the ruins of his cave dwelling still exude rampaging Heavenly Spirit auras to this day...

After closing the miscellaneous records in his hand, Xu Yunfan's eyes sparkled. The Divine Martial Dao Foundation cultivated from the *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra* naturally possessed the most suitable Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends for him.

When the Divine Martial True Person established his foundation back then, he plucked the True Martial Heavenly Spirit to become the Northern Polar Subduing Demon Qi. It required going to the bottom of the Extreme North Mysterious Ice Abyss and utilizing the night when the Big Dipper aligns in a string to trigger it. It contains the True Meaning of the Black Tortoise Star Lord subduing demons. The Heavenly Spirit aura appears as black with gold trim patterns. When refining it, a Dharma Form of a turtle and snake coiling around each other will appear around the body.

The so-called Black Tortoise Star Lord, according to Xu Yunfan's understanding, is determined by the Nine Heavens Star System. The star positions change, and the transformations of the star positions are infinite, naturally deriving infinite power.

The second was the Subduing Demon Earthly Fiend. When he explored the fragmented memories of the Divine Martial True Person, the other party had once gone deep into the Ninth Layer of the Earth Veil Magma Prison and subdued the Karma Fire Essence using Martial Dao Will.

"The *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra*..."

Xu Yunfan pondered it carefully, and finally smiled wryly. Presumably, the path of True Martial was also forged using these True Martial Heavenly Spirits and Subduing Demon Earthly Fiends.

"I must start preparing to search for Heavenly Spirits and Earthly Fiends..."

Currently, the True Yuan within Xu Yunfan's body was so abundant that it far exceeded that of ordinary Qi Refining Perfection cultivators by several times.

Although the *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra* had not yet reached the state of great completion and perfection, it perfectly integrated with his Martial Dao foundation.

This body, tempered a thousand times, was something even the Divine Martial True Person would have coveted. With the assistance of the Attribute Panel, every stage of his Martial Dao was incredibly solid.

From the 'Golden Marrow Jade Bones' of the Marrow Cleansing Realm to the 'Ten Extremes Return to Origin' of the Ninth Realm Qi Refining, every step secretly conformed to the True Martial Subduing Demon Way.

Even more rare was that the 'Zhou Tian Millstone' evolved from the Ten Extremes True Qi in his body happened to secretly match the 'Turtle and Snake Coiling' Dharma Form in the sutra.

Every time the True Yuan vortex in his Dantian rotated, it would surface other cloud patterns on his body surface, and even the dragon scale armor leaves would emit a clear and resonant chime.

Such a state of cultivation, where milk and water blend, is rare even among the true disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect over the generations.

Even the turbid Fiend Qi lurking in the Hundred Desires Peak's earth veins would spontaneously condense into Mysterious Ice Crystals when touching the three zhang around his body. This was precisely a sign that the *True Martial Subduing Demons Sutra* was about to break through to Minor Completion.

Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that he was only two innate auras away from the Foundation Establishment threshold of 'Tempering the Body with Heavenly Spirits and Refining the Soul with Earthly Fiends'.

"What? Junior Brother wants to go to the Extreme North to find the Snow Heart Lotus?"

Before the Green Jade Table in the Hundred Affairs Hall, Xu Yunfan's smile appeared exceptionally gentle under the illumination of the sharkskin candle.

The female disciple across from him, dressed in a lotus-pink gauze skirt, however, slightly shrank her pupils.

This newly entered Junior Brother seemed to be at the Fourth Layer of Qi Refining, having just entered the mid-stage, but his aura was as stable as an abyss. The vast majority of Primordial Origin Sect disciples have the habit of hiding their means.

But with her eyes that have seen countless people, she naturally could tell that the other party was hiding something. However, no matter how she secretly applied her methods, she couldn't see a single clue.

The more this happened, the more serious the female disciple felt in her heart, and she even regretted speaking to Xu Yunfan.

"Senior Sister is perceptive."

Xu Yunfan pointed to the mission jade slip he had just received from the Hundred Affairs Hall. "I heard that Snow Lotus Seeds can help the success rate of the 'Severing Heart Pill' increase by two percent. Coincidentally..."

"Do you know about the Mysterious Ice Heavenly Wind on the Extreme North Ice Plains?"

The female disciple suddenly interrupted, her thoughts churning. Looking at Xu Yunfan's robust physique, she finally couldn't suppress the restless desire in her heart. She looked at Xu Yunfan with seductive eyes like silk and pointed her white, onion-like finger three inches from his brow.

"With this meager cultivation, you can't even pass the Cold Crow Pass."

A subtle fragrance drifted from her sleeves, and the Heart-Ensnaring Technique unique to the Hundred Desires Peak had quietly enveloped Xu Yunfan.

The other disciples in the hall sneered upon seeing this.

Newcomers always have to suffer a bit, especially since this Senior Sister Liu Ruyan loves to play with new faces. Last year, there was a naive fellow who was bewitched by her into accepting a Netherworld Cave mission, and his bones are still not cold yet.

"Senior Sister's Thousand Threads of Passion are quite exquisite."

Xu Yunfan suddenly raised his eyes, and a golden pattern flashed deep within his pupils.

Liu Ruyan retreated three steps as if struck by lightning, and the jade hairpin in her hair bun "cracked" with fine lines.

The Thousand Threads of Passion she had cultivated for ten years were actually shattered by the counter-shock!

Amidst the uproar of the hall, everyone realized that Liu Ruyan had kicked an iron plate. No one among the Primordial Origin Sect disciples would easily expose their trump cards. The aura revealed by the person in front of them was likely that of a crouching mountain tiger.

Xu Yunfan still smiled harmlessly: "By chance, Junior Brother obtained half of the *Ice Soul Heart-Cultivating诀*. I have a slight resistance to cold energy."

Liu Ruyan's expression changed不定.

Anyone who could silently break her seduction technique must be at the very least late-stage Qi Refining, at least the Sixth Layer of Qi Refining.

Yet this guy actually broke her Thousand Threads of Passion so casually...

"I suddenly remembered I have pills being refined in the pill room. I'll take my leave first."

She forced herself to remain calm and turned around. As her embroidered shoes stepped out, an invisible Qi momentum quietly spread out. This Seventh Layer Qi Refining late-stage disciple was considered a figure on the Hundred Desires Peak.

Several disciples who wanted to watch the excitement bowed their heads and pretended to study the missions upon seeing this.

Seeing Liu Ruyan leave, Xu Yunfan didn't care. He had done this on purpose. Although reaching the late stage of Qi Refining was still considered "material," it would eventually receive attention. If he accidentally killed her, it would likely cause a lot of trouble.
