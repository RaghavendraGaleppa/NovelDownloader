# Chapter 549: The Celestial Talisman of the Abyss and the Solar-Lunar Pivot

Xu Yunfan presented the True Lord's Edict. The blood-colored light flashed on the bone tablet, and the seemingly massive stone doors slid open silently to either side, revealing a deep, winding corridor within.

The walls on both sides of the corridor were inlaid with skull lamps that burned with a dim light. The flames emitted a greenish-white phosphorescence, casting long, eerie, and swaying shadows.

The air was filled with a rich scent of old scrolls and the smell of ancient decay, mixed with a faint hint of blood and an indescribable echo, like the murmurs of souls.

“……”

Xu Yunfan let out a breath. This environment truly made him frown slightly.

Stepping into the true scripture repository area, his vision suddenly opened up.

The vast space seemed boundless. Countless towering bookshelves stood like a forest, reaching up to the chaotic ceiling formed by distorted light from spiritual power.

Not all items on the shelves were paper books or jade slips.

There were also formation diagrams sewn from human skin,符册 (talisman books) carved with demonic script on polished skulls, and living runes sealed within transparent crystal pillars, constantly changing form.

Xu Yunfan was already accustomed to such sights.

The foundation of the Primordial Origin Sect was its inclusiveness. The methods of demons, ghosts, the Dao, and spirits all had their place here.

He showed the True Lord's Edict to the guardian elder of the scripture repository.

The elder's turbid eyes glanced at the edict, then looked deeply at Xu Yunfan. His withered lips moved, but no sound came out. He simply gestured with his hand, seemingly pointing toward a specific area.

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, and his spiritual sense spread out like a tide.

His goal was clear.

A secret art capable of disturbing the heavenly secrets and concealing karma.

A powerful body-fortifying true method to compensate for the deficiencies in his physical cultivation.

If he had possessed a secret art to disturb karma and heavenly secrets earlier, he wouldn't have had to worry about anything else and could have simply killed Liu Yunhua on the spot.

The process of searching for the heavenly secrets secret art was quite time-consuming.

Such secret arts were particularly precious and rare in the Demonic Sect, and most were incomplete fragments or imperfect methods.

Most were held by Golden Core True Lords as rewards.

However, the Primordial Origin Sect was an ancient sect that had been passed down for over a hundred thousand years, so it naturally had quite a few heavenly secrets secret arts.

He avoided those sinister methods that required sacrificing lifespan or blood sacrifices, and after carefully distinguishing them for a long time, he finally found a scroll recorded on the unknown, faint leather of a star beast in an inconspicuous corner near the shadow of the chaotic ceiling.

Unfurling the scroll, the text was silver-white, like fragments of a star river, recording an abstract of a secret art called the "Celestial Talisman of the Abyss."

This technique was neither offensive nor defensive. It specialized in blinding, disturbing, and eroding the threads of deduction, confusing perception, and distorting causal connections.

Although it was extremely difficult to cultivate and prone to heavenly retribution—meaning it would attract lightning strikes—it also placed a very high demand on the practitioner's foundation, which perfectly met Xu Yunfan's current needs.

To be fair, his aptitude was quite good.

Moreover, if lightning strikes were to occur during cultivation, he could use them to temper his physical body and nourish his soul.

He immersed his spiritual sense into it, sensing that profound and unfathomable aura that seemed capable of devouring the trajectory of heavenly secrets, and his heart settled.

"This is the one."

As for the body-fortifying true method, it was relatively easier to find.

There were many such methods in the scripture repository, and Xu Yunfan's goal was exceptionally clear.

He did not need anything flashy, nor did he need any accompanying divine abilities. He only sought extreme focus on the tempering and defense of his physical body and soul.

He filtered out those unorthodox cultivation methods that relied on evil qi to temper the body, required the fusion of special exotic beast bloodlines, or even needed to devour certain precious minerals to refine into the body. Finally, he locked onto a bookshelf composed of several interlocking giant ribs and found a墨黑色玉简 (ink-black jade slip) imprisoned within a fist-sized, transparent crystal stone core.

On the surface of the jade slip were only four simple ancient seal script characters.

"Sun and Moon Pivot"

As his spiritual sense probed in, a true meaning that was desolate and majestic, stirring the power of yin and yang, the sun and moon to temper his own body, rushed toward him.

The core of this true scripture lay in visualizing the rotation and alternation of the sun, moon, and stellar power, transforming it into the Pivot's force to draw in the ambient spiritual energy of the universe to scour his own body.

During the day, it draws in the essence of the blazing sun to burn and refine the skin, flesh, and bones, making them as tough as divine iron.

At night, it draws in the yin essence of the moon, blending it with the stellar radiance of the heavens to moisten the internal organs and bone marrow, allowing them to contain stellar light and be as supple as profound jade.

When the technique is perfected, yin and yang are harmonized, and the dragon and tiger converge. One's body can become a Vajra, containing the universe within, with strength enough to pull up mountains and rivers, capable of clashing with magical treasures without being damaged.

It follows the most essential and pure path, directly targeting the foundation of the physical body.

It lacks the myriad transformations of the Profound Capital Cloud Qi, and it is not as fierce as the True Scripture of the Celestial Thunder which requires drawing in the evil qi of thunder, fire, and metal. However, it excels in having a solid foundation, pure and vast, perfectly complementing his current main offensive direction of the True Scripture of the Celestial Thunder and the Profound Capital Cloud Qi.

Moreover, the Yin-Yang Separation and Union True Scripture could also provide support and complementarity.

"One conceals the heavens, the other refines the body. Not bad, not bad."

The trip was not in vain.

Both of these secret arts could be considered top-tier. They were only available within the Three Great Sects. If they were to appear in the outside world, such secret arts would inevitably cause a bloody scramble.

Only a few can enter the Three Great Sects; most are ordinary sects, and it is the norm for wandering cultivators.

If not for the long-standing heritage of the Primordial Origin Sect, these two secret arts would truly be unattainable.

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate. Using his spiritual sense as a guide, he injected the power of the True Lord's Edict and carefully extracted the star beast leather scroll for the "Celestial Talisman of the Abyss" and the ink-black crystal core containing the "Sun and Moon Pivot Body" from their restrictions.

The process seemed calm, but the deep space of the scripture repository seemed to respond with a low hum, as if a certain rule had been touched, coupling with the True Lord's Edict to confirm his identity.

After completing his selection, Xu Yunfan turned to leave.

He felt quite uncomfortable in this place. The Blood Elder's heart was twisted, and if he were to run into him, a fight might be necessary to settle things.

The scripture repository was as deep as an abyss, with light and shadow shifting不定. The only sound was the faint "tap, tap" of his boots on the cold石板 (stone slabs), which seemed to have been soaked in blood, echoing in the vast emptiness.

Just as he was about to step out of the end of the corridor filled with ghostly phosphorescent flames, a figure, carrying an air of just the right amount of heartiness, happened to emerge from between another row of giant, forest-like shelves and came straight toward him.

The man was dressed in brocade with a jade belt, his features handsome. His demeanor was steady, carrying a sense of worldly sophistication from being in a high position for a long time, but beneath that sophistication, there was a faint, chilling sense of control.

He was Li Wei, a disciple of the current sect leader, Heavenly Derivation True Lord, and a trusted aide of the Universal Salvation True Lord. He was at the late stage of Foundation Establishment, nearly at perfection.

The powerful aura he exuded, however, was completely contained within, showing no external pressure, appearing calm and introverted.

"Peak Master Xu, what a coincidence."

Li Wei said with a beaming smile, cupping his hands in salute. "From afar, I sensed the profound, abyssal thunderous aura of the Celestial Thunder Peak Master. I was just thinking of finding some free time to pay my respects, but I didn't expect to run into you here.

Peak Master Xu, you have been in seclusion for years. It seems your cultivation has greatly advanced, and your aura has become even more stable and vast. This is truly a great fortune for our Primordial Origin Sect!"

His words were full of intimacy and flattery.

Xu Yunfan was on guard internally, but he had no choice but to stop his steps. A natural and open smile appeared on his face as he returned the salute.

"So it is Senior Brother Li. You flatter me, you flatter me!

It is merely a small progress. It does not deserve such praise from you, Senior Brother. As the envoy of the Sect Master, you are busy with affairs. It is my honor to meet you today."
