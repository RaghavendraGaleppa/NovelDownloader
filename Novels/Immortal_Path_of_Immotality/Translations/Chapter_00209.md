# Chapter 207: I'm Innocent!

Outside Moonview City, within the fishpond compound.

The Dai family members surrounded Bear Mountain Sage, listening to his enthusiastic introduction about their merchant association's future plans, layouts, and prospects for the aquaculture industry, eager to secure their clients' loyalty.

His earnest demeanor made one think the Lin Merchant Association was his own family business—until everyone realized, wasn't it exactly that?

What a performance! This guy was a true drama king!

The Dai family members, already biased, thought they had seen through everything. Faced with this scene, they found Bear Mountain Sage utterly ridiculous, like a clown putting on a show, and sneered one after another.

"Therefore, our association will expand more channels in the future, striving to cultivate a greater variety of fresher aquatic products..."

Bear Mountain Sage talked until his mouth was dry, finally pouring out all his knowledge, thinking he had this in the bag.

When the Dai family members returned to the city and reported to their higher-ups, they would surely praise his capability and diligence. A promotion and raise would be just around the corner!

But the next moment, everyone around him pulled out their magical artifacts, their expressions turning hostile.

"Enough already! Are you done?"

"Blah blah blah, our ears are about to fall off!"

"Stop pretending! Let's see what you're really made of!"

"Bear Mountain Sage, we acknowledge your talent in aquaculture, but today, you won't escape."

Bear Mountain Sage was startled by the sudden hostility.

Why the sudden aggression? He had just settled in the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world, penniless and alone. Picking a fight with the locals was the last thing he wanted—outnumbered and outmatched, it would only lead to endless trouble.

Moreover, these were disciples of a cultivation family. He was still unfamiliar with the local powers and didn't know the Dai family's standing. Provoking them would be unwise.

He quickly raised his hands in surrender.

"Everyone, calm down! There must be some misunderstanding here. Let's talk it out. There's no need for violence. As scholars, we pursue immortality, not bloodshed. I'm new here and unfamiliar with the customs. If I've offended anyone, please forgive me! I'm all ears for your guidance."

The Dai family members ignored his pleas, instead hurling insults.

"Misunderstanding my ass! You dare act but won't own up to it? Where's that ruthless attitude from before? Don't make us look down on you!"

"Exactly! Daring to ambush our family's Golden Core elder—this debt must be repaid!"

"We thought you were some formidable figure, but you're just a coward!"

"Brothers, don't let your guard down. He might be feigning weakness!"

Amid the jeers, the two leading young scholars unleashed their spiritual pressure—signs of Foundation Establishment, and both at the late stage at that. Bear Mountain Sage's legs trembled.

Late-stage Foundation Establishment while still looking young? These two were geniuses! Even back in the Great Song, they'd be top disciples of major sects!

How did I get tangled up with this mess?

Dai Budong was a contender for the Dai family's leadership, a mining giant in the cultivation world. Someone who dared compete for succession couldn't be ordinary!

Zhu Duiyou, rising from humble origins to excel in Jingyang Academy and become a top graduate, was no less talented. These two weren't here without confidence.

What terrified him even more was their accusation—that he had ambushed a Dai family Golden Core elder?

That's absurd! A Foundation Establishment cultivator killing a Golden Core? That's a fairy tale! If I had that ability, I'd already be a renowned prodigy!

Yet the crowd was adamant.

"Bear Mountain Sage, save your breath. Brother Zhu has already uncovered your aliases. There's no fooling us."

"Since we've tracked you down, you should know we have all the evidence. Your excuses are useless. No more lies."

"And don't think about a desperate fight. Without time to set up your skeleton puppet's formations, what can you do against us?"

Dai Budong's voice boomed, each word striking fear into his enemy and bolstering his own side. The Dai family disciples tightened their grips on their artifacts, their spirits roused.

Bear Mountain Sage kept pleading.

"You've got the wrong man! Please, investigate properly!"

"It's you, no mistake!"

"I just arrived! I couldn't have done it!"

"Nonsense!"

"Use your brains—how could a Foundation Establishment cultivator kill a Golden Core?"

"Still lying!"

"I'm innocent! Who framed me? I swear vengeance!"

"Prepare to die!"

In an instant, artifacts flew, spells erupted, and colorful spiritual lights clashed.

The fishpond Bear Mountain Sage had painstakingly dug that morning was soon reduced to ruins. But he had no time to care, barely managing to defend himself.

Dai Budong stood with one hand behind his back, his scholar's robe fluttering without wind.

A large inkstone hovered above Bear Mountain Sage, its weight impossible to withstand. The ink it spilled was thick and black, dulling artifacts and sapping spiritual energy.

A hidden weapon box shot out spikes, nearly turning him into a pincushion.

Incantations summoned dark clouds, but it was a feint—a pangolin spirit beast attacked from below!

Bear Mountain Sage dodged frantically, cursing inwardly. This scholar was a sneaky bastard, righteous on the surface but underhanded in action.

Had he not honed his survival instincts through years of hardship, he'd have been finished.

Unbeknownst to him, even Lin Shan had nearly fallen to Dai Budong during the Demon Sect's headquarters battle. Now, years later, Dai Budong had grown even stronger.

But Dai Budong had a problem—Zhu Duiyou.

They'd agreed Zhu wouldn't intervene, but seeing the fierce battle, he couldn't resist lending a hand, itching to join.

Thanks to Zhu's "help," Bear Mountain Sage narrowly escaped death several times.

"What are you doing?"

"Helping you."

"You're helping him, not me!"

"Fine."

Zhu Duiyou reluctantly withdrew.

Bear Mountain Sage was baffled—why was there a traitor aiding him? But the assistance vanished as quickly as it came.

Without Zhu's interference, Dai Budong unleashed his full prowess, pressing Bear Mountain Sage relentlessly.

Meanwhile, the Dai family elites combined their powers into a joint attack, their coordinated spiritual light equivalent to two or three Foundation Establishment cultivators. As blood relatives raised together, their synergy added immense pressure.

"Bang! Bang! Bang!"

"Whoosh—"

"Thud! Thud! Thud—"

Bear Mountain Sage leaped and dodged, but surrounded, he had to focus on Dai Budong while fending off the others' attacks. His beard was singed off in patches.

Fury and confusion filled his heart.

I just got here! Why am I being targeted?

What did I even do?

Who framed me?

Just wait till I find out—I'll kill you!

Inside the Lin Merchant Association headquarters in the city, three figures huddled in the basement.

Lin Shan dared not show his face, intent on laying low, finishing his scheme, and leaving without complications.

Beside him was Lü Xiuming, the nominal general manager, reporting to him and Blackbone Demon Lord.

"We've recruited over twenty new members. Positions are nearly full."

"The fishpond outside the city is under construction. I hired a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator to handle the labor. It should be ready in two days for the handover."

"Here's the roster. Please review it, honored leaders."

Lin Shan skimmed the list absentmindedly until one name caught his eye—Bear Mountain Sage, the newly hired "Fishpond Manager."

The entry read:

[Bear Mountain, late-stage Foundation Establishment. Claims graduation from Shangyang Academy, participated in Lu Kingdom's cultivation battles. Verification: no academy endorsement, a rogue cultivator. Behavior suggests bandit tendencies, self-proclaimed "Bear Mountain Sage."]

Lin Shan and Blackbone Demon Lord exchanged glances.

"Could it be the same Bear Mountain Sage we know?" the demon lord asked uncertainly.

Lin Shan pulled out a broken spiked club—a "trophy" from their encounter in the Eastern Sea's虾夷海域. Years had passed, and with his focus on cultivation and distance from old enemies, Lin Shan had ignored Bear Mountain Sage, especially since the latter had a Nascent Soul cultivator's protection against curses.

Now, a possible sighting surprised him, but he had means to verify.

His spiritual treasure, Void Star Compass, had long-range tracking abilities—previously unused.

Closing his eyes, he activated the compass, linking it to the club's owner's aura. A blue dot appeared about ten miles away.

"It really is him?!"

Lin Shan's eyes snapped open in disbelief.

"What's going on?" Blackbone Demon Lord pressed.

Ignoring him, Lin Shan asked Lü Xiuming, "What's at the foot of the mountain by the river, a mile west of the city?"

"That's the site of our fishpond compound," Lü Xiuming replied, puzzled. "I chose it for its water access. The manager there is the newly hired late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator—Bear Mountain Sage."

"Audacious!"

Lin Shan stood abruptly, his spiritual pressure flaring. Lü Xiuming, still at Qi Refining after years of managing the association, staggered back.

"Brother, is it really him?"

"Yes! He walked right into our hands. Since he's delivered himself to me, I won't hold back!"

Lin Shan turned to leave, intent on killing Bear Mountain Sage immediately. Normally hard to find, now he'd stumbled into his grasp? Perfect timing!

Lü Xiuming was baffled. What grudge did the president have against this man?

Blackbone Demon Lord, unaware of the Void Star Compass's function but trusting Lin Shan's judgment, stopped him.

"Wait, no need to rush."

"Why not? He's right outside the city, where fighting isn't forbidden. With both of us at late-stage Foundation Establishment, killing him would be effortless! And his master, Pure Lotus Scholar, has fled Lu Kingdom—no one to protect him."

"I don't doubt your strength, but the association's sale to Treasurer Qian is in two days. Why not wait until after the handover to kill him?"

Lin Shan paused, understanding.

With Bear Mountain Sage laboring to complete the fishponds, the association's sale would go smoothly. Then, after being sold out, he could dispose of the oblivious fool.

"Good point. Let him live two more days!"

Lin Shan sat back down, and the trio resumed planning.

---

Outside the city, the battle neared its end. Bear Mountain Sage was faltering.

Dai Budong, a true elite among Foundation Establishment cultivators, overwhelmed him, especially with the Dai family's formation support. Without Zhu Duiyou's interference, it was a one-sided beatdown.

"Bam! Bam! Bam!"

"Creak—"

Bear Mountain Sage was battered by the inkstone, trapped in a golden net, and finally subdued, bound so tightly he nearly suffocated.

"You hypocrites! Fight me one-on-one if you dare! Ganging up is cowardly!"

Dai Budong sneered, ignoring the taunt.

One-on-one? You'd still lose.

Initially thought to be a formidable foe capable of ambushing a Golden Core elder, Bear Mountain Sage turned out to be mediocre without his puppet formations. How did he even become a Nascent Soul cultivator's disciple?

Wait—where was that puppet?

Zhu Duiyou stepped forward, kicking the bound man and rifling through his storage pouch. His expression turned odd.

"What's wrong?" Dai Budong asked.

Wordlessly, Zhu Duiyou handed over the pouch. Inside was nearly empty—just a few spirit stones, pitifully few for a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Even a mouse would turn away in pity.

This was a Nascent Soul elder's disciple? A penniless bum?

"Where's the million spirit stones from selling our family's assets? Or the treasures and jade slips from ambushing the Golden Core elder?"

Dai Budong was dumbfounded.

Bear Mountain Sage, bruised and bloody, wailed.

"What million spirit stones? What treasures? What are you talking about?"

"I turned over a new leaf, came to Lu Kingdom to work honestly! Why am I still so unlucky?!"

"You cultivation family brats bully us rogue cultivators, oppressing the weak for fun! Why? Why?!"

The Dai family members were equally confused.

Did we catch the wrong guy?

Or... are there two Bear Mountain Sages?
