# Chapter 171: Autumn Moon Betrays the Manor, the Madam’s Great Secret

The moonlight was as dark as ink.

The two men, one tall and one short, entered the mountain path. After walking several miles, they turned onto a smaller trail. They twisted left and right, winding around and around in circles. They used the trees and vegetation to mask their movements, making them incredibly difficult to track.

Lin Aoshan was anxious, having already lost sight of the two men. Li Xian, however, remained calm, relying on his keen vision to keep the situation under control.

The Flower Cage Gate was a sinister sect of the Jianghu, known for its bizarre methods. They naturally had their own ways of surviving. The mountain-running technique they used now was called the "Coiled Intestine Step." It was especially terrifying in areas with lush vegetation and complex terrain.

It could disorient a person, causing them to lose their senses and faint. Li Xian was watching from a distance with a clear view. Whenever the two men turned or circled, he would stop to observe, refusing to follow blindly.

Because of this, he avoided the effects of the Coiled Intestine Step, keeping his mind clear. The tall and short men circled while advancing, gradually moving deeper into the woods until they reached an open area.

There stood an abandoned mansion. The nameplate on the gate had long since rotted away, and the ground was overgrown with weeds taller than a man. The two men entered the ruins, and from deep within the mansion, the faint flicker of firelight drifted out.

Having tracked them this far, Lin Aoshan didn't dare to rush in recklessly. She looked at Li Xian. Li Xian said, "Go back first and notify Luo Xia. Have her lead the officers to the outskirts of the mountain."

Lin Aoshan had long felt that Li Xian was smart and decisive, and she was willing to listen to him. With the situation being urgent, she nodded without saying much and used her lightness technique to leave.

The weeds around the abandoned mansion were like a natural barrier. About thirty paces outside the mansion stood a towering tree.

It was over a dozen zhang tall, with a trunk so thick it took seven or eight men to encircle it, and its branches were lush and leafy. It was the perfect place to hide.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Waiting is useless. It's better to hide in this tree and use my Pupil of Yin and Yang to peek inside." He used the "Light Word Technique" to climb the trunk and skillfully hid himself in the dense canopy.

A venomous snake was crawling on the branch. Startled, it raised its head to bite. Li Xian's hand moved like lightning; he used the "Soaring Cloud Hand" to grab the snake's three-inch vital point and squeezed hard, killing it instantly.

After settling himself, he used his Pupil of Yin and Yang to peer through the roof tiles and observe the scene inside.

Inside the abandoned main hall, about seven or eight people were sitting around. They had lit a fire and seemed to be chatting casually.

Suddenly, one person, holding a torch, took some dry biscuits and a water bag, left the main hall, crossed a corridor overgrown with thick weeds, and arrived at a side room in the back courtyard.

This mansion was completely abandoned. Only this room remained relatively intact; the roof tiles were whole, and the vermilion paint was still visible. The man pushed the door open, and immediately, several cries were heard.

Li Xian focused his gaze and thought, "The kidnapped women are indeed hidden here. These people are definitely from the Flower Cage Gate. All that's left is to gather the officers and wipe them out together."

There were five women in the room, all of them good-looking. They were tightly bound and couldn't move. The beautiful wife of the Wang family, the Third Madam, had been kidnapped first. She had been here for several days and was the most adapted to the situation. She had delicate features and neat clothes. Even in this situation, she maintained a graceful appearance. She was truly a lady from a great family, extremely dignified.

There was a wooden chair in the room, and she was tied to it, hands and feet bound. Her expression was sorrowful, but she had already accepted her fate. Seeing a disciple of the Flower Cage Gate enter, she merely let out a soft sigh.

Li Xian muttered, "Although the Flower Cage Gate commits many evil deeds, their taste isn't bad."

He then looked elsewhere. The beautiful wives of the Zhao and Luo families did not receive such treatment. They sat in the corners, their hands tied behind their backs. Their ankles were free, but knowing there was no hope of escape, they didn't struggle.

The young lady of the Lin family, Lin Qingwan, was captured last night. The Flower Cage Gate was very experienced in capturing women. They knew that younger women would resist more fiercely. The first two days were the most intense, so they gave her special attention, binding her even tighter.

She was tied to a pillar, with seven or eight ropes binding her whole body, as if she were stuck to the pillar. Now, her eyes were drowsy, her long hair scattered, looking extremely pitiful.

In the corner of the room, there was another woman wearing colorful clothes. She had also been captured recently and received special attention. However, there was only one wooden pillar in the room, and she was the most miserable. The other women could sit or stand, but she was the only one lying face down, her hands and feet bent backward, tied together.

Li Xian suddenly felt she looked familiar and looked at her more closely. But the woman's face was pressed to the ground, so he couldn't see her features. Her hands and feet were bent backward, so he couldn't see her figure either. With no basis for judgment, he didn't speculate further.

The Flower Cage Gate member said, "Come on, eat some dry food. Brother Gu has given the order. We're leaving tomorrow. You all... are coming with us."

"Be honest, you got that? You may be ladies from noble families. But... they all think you're dead. They have no intention of looking for you."

Hearing this, the sobbing grew louder.

"Cry, cry, cry. What are you crying for?"

"Get your spirits up. Eat well and fill your stomachs."

The man swept his gaze over the women's beautiful faces and couldn't help but curse, "Damn it, a bunch of little vixens. If Brother Gu hadn't given the order, telling us to save our energy for emergencies, I would have already shown you how tough I am!"

A big battle was coming soon. Li Xian averted his gaze and turned to observe the members of the Flower Cage Gate.

There were about three powerful ones among them.

It was hard to see their cultivation level with the naked eye. However, their martial arts foundation and depth of skill could be seen from their walking, movements, voice, and status.

One of them had an imposing aura, holding his breath in his chest, and exhaling like a snake... He must have cultivated a powerful martial art, and his realm was likely at the Food Essence stage.

"This guy is quite strong. He's probably that 'Brother Gu.' Hmm... I'll leave him to Lin Aoshan."

"I'll pick one who isn't too strong or too weak to practice on."

Li Xian pondered. Lin Aoshan's martial arts skill and cultivation were both extremely formidable. Her cultivation was higher than Li Xian's. As for martial arts skill... she had been exposed to them since she was a child and had practiced many. Although her depth in any single martial art might not be as deep as Li Xian's, her range was broader.

And the quality was higher.

An hour later, Li Xian jumped down from the tree, left the forest, and met up with Luo Xia and Lin Aoshan, informing them of the situation in the abandoned mansion.

Lin Aoshan exclaimed, "You have such a big胆! Daring to infiltrate the enemy's lair. If your figure had been exposed, you wouldn't have survived. The Flower Cage Gate doesn't kill women, but they never said they wouldn't kill men. You... Brother Li, you mustn't do that again."

She didn't know that Li Xian possessed the Pupil of Yin and Yang, which had the power of透视 (x-ray vision). Li Xian smiled and didn't explain, but he thought to himself, "This Lin family grandmother has a pretty good personality. Although she's a bit spoiled, she doesn't delay serious matters and knows how to care for people."

"Fourteen people, huh? That's not many. We can handle it," Luo Xia said. They had brought forty men this time, all clad in armor, more than enough to take them down.

Luo Xia took out a map and divided the forty men into four teams. They would infiltrate from the east, south, west, and north, finally forming an encirclement to wipe out the villains in one go.

The operation began immediately.

Li Xian's Golden Leopard Bow and Lingyu Arrows were both left at the One Union Manor. Luo Xia knew his archery was excellent and specially brought an ordinary bow for him.

It only had the power of two stones, but it was enough for this situation. After waiting for another half an hour, all the officers were in position, surrounding the abandoned mansion.

Luo Xia shouted, "Kill!" and the officers charged.

The Flower Cage Gate members were startled. Each picked up their weapons and looked at "Gu Shuntong." He was their big brother, with the strongest strength and the deepest schemes.

Gu Shuntong frowned tightly. Hearing the loud commotion and the approaching footsteps, he really couldn't figure out when they had been discovered or who was attacking them.

But since things had come to this, Gu Shuntong rushed out of the hall. The other Flower Cage Gate members followed closely, and the two sides confronted each other. Gu Shuntong shouted, "Kill!" and struck first.

The two sides became entangled, and flashes of sword and blade light filled the air.

Lin Aoshan shouted, "Little thief, take this!" She targeted Gu Shuntong and迎战 (engaged him).

Gu Shuntong was taken aback and didn't dare to be careless, raising his moves to counter. They fought several rounds, and it was hard to tell who was winning, with each gaining and losing ground.

In terms of talent, status, and background, Lin Aoshan was naturally superior. But Gu Shuntong was already in his forties, having lived twenty more years. How could this accumulation of experience be ignored?

He relied on his experience to avoid the heavy and strike the light, avoiding his weaknesses while using his strengths. He had plenty of room to maneuver with her. Moreover, in his entire life, he was most skilled at fighting women. Seeing Lin Aoshan's beauty, he taunted, "Little sister, did you call these people here?"

"I am your grand-aunt!" Lin Aoshan挑眉 (raised her eyebrows) and said.

"Little sister, if you wanted to see me, why bring so many people?" Gu Shuntong fought while retreating, laughing. "You just had to call out, and I would have come."

Lin Aoshan's anger was ignited, and her attacks became more urgent. She drew a long sword from her waist and used the Lin family's inherited martial art, "Thirty-Six Cotton Wind Sword."

This sword technique was soft and moderate. Precisely because of this, it showed no flaws. Even if she encountered a master several levels stronger than her, she could use this sword technique to hold on for a while.

Her swordsmanship was perfect. As she executed the second sword move, a strange phenomenon formed around her. The wind blew gently, seeming light but actually sticky and lingering.

No matter what move the opponent made, it felt like hitting cotton.

Lin Aoshan swept her sword. The withered branches and fallen leaves around her were all blown up and suspended in the air. They stayed there for a long time without falling, showing a terrifying might.

Don't be fooled by Lin Aoshan's rage; she was actually on guard. Her intention in using this sword technique wasn't to defeat the enemy, but to entangle him.

Gu Shuntong frowned. He looked relaxed, but he already felt his situation was unfavorable.

He frowned coldly, took several steps back, and laughed, "Little娃娃 (brat), try this move of mine." He struck a palm from a distance.

Lin Aoshan had been chasing him. Seeing the palm's power was not trivial, she stopped her steps. She hesitated for a moment because although this palm was powerful, it seemed like Gu Shuntong had struck it in a panic. He had just stepped back, already creating distance. They were several steps apart; how could this palm reach her?

Gu Shuntong sneered. His shoulder suddenly shook. His bones made a "cracking" strange sound. His arm suddenly extended by double its length, instantly closing the distance and slapping Lin Aoshan's shoulder.

It turned out that Gu Shuntong possessed a special physique. This physique was called [Snake Bone Physique]. People with this physique had one more snake-like vertebra than ordinary people.

There were many variations of the Snake Bone Physique. Some grew in the lumbar spine, some in the neck.

Gu Shuntong had great luck. His snake bone connected his upper and lower arms. Normally, with just the physique, his hand couldn't grow longer out of thin air.

After all, even if the bones were long, the flesh, blood, and meridians couldn't keep up. Gu Shuntong, combining his own characteristics, specifically practiced the "Snake Shifting Hand." This was a lower-grade martial art. During practice, he used snake venom to temper his arms.

Then he soaked them in special medicines to soften the meridians and flesh of his arms. At this time, the [Snake Bone Physique] and the "Snake Shifting Hand" were combined. This resulted in the effect of his arm growing longer out of thin air.

He then used this feature. He deliberately stepped back to lure the opponent into chasing. Then he施展 (executed) the "Snake Shifting Hand." At this time, the opponent, seeing the distance was far, would inevitably relax or hesitate.

But they didn't know the arm would suddenly grow long and bite up like a venomous snake. Lin Aoshan felt a sharp pain. When she lifted her shoulder, there were already two snake fang holes.

Gu Shuntong said, "Little sister, you should be thankful. If you weren't a woman, and a beautiful one at that, I would have used deadly poison to kill you long ago."

"It's a pity, such a pretty face. Today, you have too many people. I can't take you, so I'll leave first. Hahaha."

Gu Shuntong leaped and fled, abandoning his Flower Cage Gate companions, and ran far away. Lin Aoshan wanted to chase him, but she felt her body go weak and numb, and she couldn't summon her strength.

The poison in her shoulder wasn't fatal, but it was very uncomfortable. She had already sealed her blood and blocked the holes, trying to stop the poison from spreading. But the poison contained internal energy (Qi), which pushed it, and it was still spreading.

Gu Shuntong secretly breathed a sigh of relief, having escaped the encirclement. Just then, a sharp arrow shot towards him. Gu Shuntong bent over and rolled, narrowly avoiding it.

"小子 (小子), you're here to stop me too?" Gu Shuntong saw Li Xian and cursed.

Li Xian said nothing, nocking an arrow and shooting. Gu Shuntong's heart skipped a beat, his hair stood on end, and he instinctively felt danger. He dodged with all his might, but it was very difficult to avoid. He barely dodged, but before he could catch his breath, the second and third arrows came.

This guy's archery was godly!

Gu Shuntong thought, "If I don't kill this guy, I definitely won't escape. I'm twenty zhang away from him. His flying arrows are hard to avoid. I might as well not dodge. I just need to protect my chest and kill him forcefully!"

He immediately charged forward, bracing himself against the flying arrows. He had already entered the "Food Essence" stage, and his body had undergone several transformations. Each transformation made his body stronger, and the snake bone in his arm would grow another segment.

He took ten arrows, which pierced through his body. Yet his momentum remained strong, showing no signs of weakness. By now, the distance was close. He let out a furious roar and struck a palm.

His arm suddenly grew long, aiming for Li Xian's chest. Two venomous spikes protruded from Gu Shuntong's palm, containing extreme poison. He used his internal energy to force the poison out and inject it into the opponent's body. It could cause a person to die from poisoning very quickly!

Li Xian observed meticulously and possessed the [Tracing Yin and Yang] trait. He saw through Gu Shuntong's intention, anticipated the enemy, and had already raised his sword in advance. Gu Shuntong felt a great sense of danger and quickly retracted his palm. As he retracted his palm, Li Xian顺势 (took the opportunity) to thrust his sword forward.

This sword pierced through the arm, stabbing straight into it. Gu Shuntong wailed in agony. Li Xian thought to himself, "Yang Origin Sword Qi." A firelight burst from the sword body, and the entire arm exploded. Li Xian executed a horizontal slash, finishing off Gu Shuntong.

Li Xian stood a zhang away, having witnessed many strange techniques of martial artists. Lin Aoshan was stronger, but she had suffered a great loss to this man, which was why she had been defeated.

He immediately shot three flying darts.

From a distance of several zhang, he executed three "Green Luo Palms" in a row. He waited a moment to confirm the man was dead, then went forward to search the body.

"This is a Flower Cage Gate token?"

He first found a token with strange patterns and some kind of design. Li Xian didn't have time to look closely and put it in his chest.

He searched again.

He found a martial art manual. Li Xian was very surprised: "I've killed quite a few strong Jianghu fighters, but finding a martial art manual is truly rare."

He didn't have time to look closely. But he saw the cover, which had the words "Gang Thunder Finger" written on it. It was a martial art of lower grade but extremely high quality.

Li Xian heard the sound of weapons clashing and remembered that the chaotic battle was not yet over. He immediately returned to the abandoned house and killed the rest of the Flower Cage Gate members.

The chaotic battle was quelled. Li Xian helped Lin Aoshan force out the snake venom, then went to the side room in the back courtyard to rescue Lin Qingwan and the other women.

The women were saved and wept with joy. Lin Aoshan, being a woman, naturally sympathized and comforted them a few words. Luo Xia then cleaned up the aftermath, searched the bodies for valuables, and counted the casualties.

Li Xian stared at one of the figures and frowned: "Qiu Yue?"

When Qiu Yue saw Li Xian, she looked as if she had met a fierce bandit, scared out of her wits. "Li... Li... Li Xian, why... why are you here? Could... could it be... that the... the Madam sent... sent you?"

As soon as the words left her mouth, she realized something was wrong and quickly covered her mouth.

Li Xian had already sensed something was off. Qiu Yue was the Madam's personal maid and usually lived in the manor. Even if the Flower Cage Gate was powerful, it would be impossible for them to kidnap Qiu Yue.

The only way Qiu Yue could have been captured was if she had left the manor on her own. She must have encountered the Flower Cage Gate on the way and suffered this misfortune.

Li Xian thought, "This Qiu Yue is usually arrogant, but today she's scared of me like a tiger, suspecting I was sent by the Madam. If that's the case... there must be a big secret."

He immediately said coldly, "That's right. I was sent by the Madam to take you back!"

"Ah!?" Qiu Yue's eyes rolled back, her legs went weak, and she was scared into a faint.

Li Xian sent some internal energy to wake her up. As soon as Qiu Yue woke up, she hugged Li Xian's leg and pleaded, "Master Li, Master Li, please... don't... don't take me back. The Madam's methods... you... you know them."

"I... I'll tell you a secret... a secret, the Madam's secret, a huge secret. Please... just... just let me go!"
