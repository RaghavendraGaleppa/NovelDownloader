Chapter 461: I'll Just Cower

Zhou Lu suddenly clenched his fists, his fingernails digging deep into his palms.

When he looked inward with his spiritual sense, he indeed found a faint trace of a foreign spiritual thought remaining in his Niwan Palace. It was like a spiderweb entangled with his thoughts of greed, and it was slowly dissipating now that he was clear-headed.

"Someone used a mind-confusing technique to stir my mind!"

He felt a chill run through his body, recalling the rumored methods of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

There was no need for direct control. By merely stirring the karma and spiritual sense fluctuations, one could quietly incite the greed in the other's heart, making them jump into the trap themselves.

Someone must have used his mouth to set up a plot just now, intending to lure Xu Yunfan out of seclusion!

"I almost became a disposable pawn..."

Trembling, Zhou Lu fumbled for his message talisman, intending to immediately apologize to Xu Yunfan, but he saw the paper talisman ignite without any wind.

A strange, unfamiliar seal faintly appeared in the ashes, startling him into quickly letting go.

This was clearly a warning. If he dared to say more, the next person to have their "karma stirred" would likely be more than just their greed.

Xu Yunfan was definitely aware of this matter, but he hadn't made any move.

Zhou Lu was covered in a cold sweat, the clothes on his back already soaked through, sticking to his skin with a sticky feeling. He trembled as he wiped the sweat from his forehead, only to find his palms were so slick he could barely hold onto anything.

"It's over."

His legs went weak, and he could barely stand. He had to cling tightly to the cold stone wall. As a disciple of the Demonic Sect, he naturally knew the ruthless methods of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

If one doesn't reach Foundation Establishment, they are ultimately just a disposable tool.

The image of Xu Yunfan's inexplicable gaze kept replaying in his mind—it was the look of someone who had seen through everything!

"I've actually become bait..."

Zhou Lu's face was deathly pale, and his lips trembled uncontrollably.

He was far too clear on the rules of the Primordial Origin Sect. For a minor character like him, once caught in the struggle between Foundation Establishment cultivators, the best outcome would be a quick death.

"Senior Brother Xu is trying to use me to lure out the mastermind behind the scenes..."

His throat tightened, as if he could already see the gruesome scene of himself being torn apart by the forces of both sides. On one side was the mysterious Foundation Establishment cultivator who could silently manipulate karma, and on the other was the unfathomable Xu Yunfan.

"Death is inevitable either way..."

Zhou Lu closed his eyes in despair, suddenly wanting to burst out laughing.

He had painstakingly built his foundation for decades, finally managing to gain a foothold in Cold Crow Pass, only to now become a sacrifice in the game of high-level cultivators.

"If only I had known..."

He bit his lip hard, only waking from his stupor when he tasted the metallic flavor of blood.

Now was not the time for regret; he had to find a way to save himself. But looking around, the night in Cold Crow Pass was still deep, yet it made him feel an unprecedented sense of suffocation.

"What should I do..."

Zhou Lu muttered to himself as he left in a daze.

"Xu Yunfan isn't taking the bait."

At the same time, on a secluded cliff outside Cold Crow Pass, a figure stood with his hands behind his back, his eyes cold as he looked at the continuous buildings within the pass.

"He's cautious... Unfortunately, you can hide for a while, but not forever."

He raised his hand, fingers slightly spread. Spiritual light flowed at his fingertips, tracing profound trajectories within a small space. His spiritual sense reflected upon them, revealing countless threads of karma intertwined within.

However, as soon as the divination began, his expression changed drastically.

The spiritual light at his fingertips suddenly became chaotic, as if it had touched some invisible barrier. All the tracks of heavenly secrets were completely twisted.

"Heavenly secrets are being obscured?!"

His pupils contracted. Unwilling to believe it, he circulated his magical power again.

But no matter how he pushed his divination technique, everything related to Xu Yunfan remained as blurry as looking at flowers through fog.

"The heavenly secrets have been masked."

He snorted coldly, a chilling light flashing in his eyes.

There were no more than three possibilities for a method capable of obscuring a Foundation Establishment cultivator's divination.

First, possessing a supreme treasure of heavenly secrets. Such treasures often contain the laws of heaven and earth and can naturally disrupt divination.

Second, having a True Lord personally出手 to provide cover. A True Lord has forged their Golden Core and attained their fruit of attainment; a casual act from them can reverse yin and yang.

Third, cultivating a rare method to mask heavenly secrets. Such methods are extremely rare in the Divine Martial World and cannot be obtained without great fortune.

"It seems..."

His gaze turned grimly towards the direction of Cold Crow Pass.

"This junior either possesses a strange treasure, or has cultivated some kind of secret technique to mask heavenly secrets."

Whichever the case, it meant Xu Yunfan's foundation far exceeded what was visible on the surface.

As for a True Lord personally stepping in, that would be breaking the rules.

Xu Yunfan sat quietly in his cave dwelling, his fingertips gently stroking the edge of the True Martial Sword. The cold light flowing across the blade reflected his stern face.

"Damn beasts..."

He wondered who he had provoked. Why did everyone who saw him want to step on him?

His gaze deepened, his mind churning with thoughts.

Zhou Lu's unusual behavior today was no coincidence.

He thought of the many anomalies recently: the sudden appearance of the Fulong Arhat outside Cold Crow Pass, the strange movements of certain cultivators within the pass, and those faint, probing gazes...

All these signs indicated that there were undercurrents surging within the Primordial Demon Sect. Because of the matter of his Divine Martial Foundation Base, it had likely already spread completely.

It wasn't just the Bodhi Pure Land; even the Myriad Chariot Sword Sect would likely have people interested.

A single empty spot would make people willing to fight tooth and nail to get it.

"Wanting to use the Buddhist sect's hand to get rid of me? Letting the fisherman reap the benefits?"

A cold smile appeared at the corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth.

Those fellow sect members who coveted his Divine Martial Foundation Base were probably already unable to hold back.

After all, in this Divine Martial World, opportunities to touch upon Golden Nature were rare and few. The Foundation Base he had displayed was, for those Foundation Establishment cultivators with no hope for the future, nothing short of a great fortune.

"Unfortunately..."

Xu Yunfan glanced at the progress of the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture on his attribute panel.

The night grew deeper, and the wind howled mournfully outside Cold Crow Pass.

Xu Yunfan closed his eyes and focused his mind, the aura around his body gradually merging with the True Martial Sword.

"Fulong Arhat..."

He silently repeated the name in his heart, a chilling light flashing in his eyes. Since the opponent dared to block his path, they must be prepared for their own demise.

"This Dao struggle will eventually have to be settled with a fight..."

He thought no more of it, sinking his mind into meditation.

Inside the cave dwelling, only the cold light of the True Martial Sword flickered in the darkness, lying in silent ambush.

Ten years passed in Cold Crow Pass like grains of sand slipping through fingers, quietly flowing away.

Xu Yunfan never once stepped out of his cave dwelling, spending his days with the True Martial Sword.

The Yin煞qi that perpetually lingered in Cold Crow Pass was transformed into pure spiritual power within the Yin Gathering Array he had meticulously arranged, continuously nourishing his cultivation.

"Another increase in proficiency..."

He stared at the jumping numbers on his attribute panel, a satisfied arc appearing at the corner of his mouth.

Over the past ten years, he had not only pushed the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture to a deeper realm, but his attainments in the Dao of Arrays had also advanced by leaps and bounds. With the resources from the marketplaces in Cold Crow Pass and the assistance of his attribute panel, the Profound Capital Eight Scenes Refining Heaven Creation Scripture had reached a minor success.

"I still need one more Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil to enter the mid-Foundation Establishment stage..."

Sensing the increasingly profound magical power within his body, Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed.

To break through to mid-Foundation Establishment, one must gather the purest Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil qi from heaven and earth.

And within the Northern Continent, only some strange places might yield pure Gang and Evil. Once one refines the Heavenly Gang and Earthly Evil qi, it is natural to gain another divine ability. With two great divine abilities, plus the sheer magnitude of his Martial Dao Eye divine ability, entering the mid-Foundation Establishment stage would naturally be a matter of course.
