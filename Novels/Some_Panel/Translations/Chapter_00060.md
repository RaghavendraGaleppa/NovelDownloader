# Chapter 60: Unbeatable Daoist Attire

"Disciple, their expressions seem a bit strange. Do you know why?" Jian Yuanzi glanced at True Monarch Changye and asked via telepathic message.

Yang Ji smiled and then telepathically recounted the events of that day to Jian Yuanzi.

"So that's it. It seems Senior Brother Changye brought him here to apologize." Jian Yuanzi secretly nodded and transmitted, "Since Senior Brother Changye has gone to such lengths, perhaps it's best to let the matter rest, Disciple?"

"Since Martial Uncle Changye has done this much, it wouldn't be right for me to press the issue," Yang Ji transmitted. However, he still wanted to give Changyuan a scare, so he chuckled aloud, "Senior Brother Changyuan, you look somewhat familiar. Have we met before, perhaps in the Flowing Fire Sea Region?"

True Monarch Changye's hand suddenly paused.

Changyuan's heart also tightened inexplicably. He took a deep look at Yang Ji, then outwardly maintained his composure and smiled, "There are many people with ordinary appearances like mine. Junior Brother must have mistaken me for someone else. But consider us acquainted from today."

"Oh? Is that so?" Yang Ji smiled meaningfully.

"Father, he seems to have recognized me," Changyuan transmitted, his voice grave.

"He's certainly recognized you," True Monarch Changye sighed.

"Father, what do we do now?" Changyuan secretly frowned, transmitting.

"What else can we do? Apologize properly!" True Monarch Changye said sternly.

"Haha, Nephew Yang, you are all young people. You should interact more in the future; Canglan Sect will depend on you all later on." True Monarch Changye laughed heartily and took out a teapot. "Changyuan, go pour tea for your Martial Uncle and Junior Brother."

"Martial Uncle, please have some tea!"

"Junior Brother, please have some tea!"

Changyuan took the teapot and poured tea for Jian Yuanzi and Yang Ji, then poured tea for Changye himself.

Jian Yuanzi smiled, glanced at Changye, then picked up his tea and took a sip, praising, "Excellent tea!"

Yang Ji looked at the tea, then at Changyuan, intentionally pausing for two breaths before also smilingly picking up his cup and drinking it.

Seeing this, both True Monarch Changye and Changyuan couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.

This sip was truly a "drink to bury past grievances." Everyone understood the unspoken agreement; their hearts were clear.

"Haha, Nephew Yang, what do you think of this tea?" True Monarch Changye laughed heartily.

"The tea brewed by Martial Uncle is naturally good!" Yang Ji smiled slightly.

"Haha, since Nephew likes it, I'll have someone buy more from the cultivation continent another day," True Monarch Changye said with considerable ease.

"The journey is long, Martial Uncle needn't trouble yourself," Yang Ji said, shaking his head with a smile.

"No trouble at all, no trouble. Drinking more of this spirit tea can make one's thoughts clear and profound, meticulous and agile, and also cause cultivation insights to gush forth like a spring, making the path ahead clear and bright. Nephew, you should drink more of it."

True Monarch Changye smiled, looked at Yang Ji, and suddenly asked, "By the way, Nephew, with your outstanding comprehension, have you ever considered creating an 'Unbeatable Daoist Attire'?"

"Unbeatable Daoist Attire?" Yang Ji's expression paused.

"An Unbeatable Daoist Attire simply means that all your cultivation techniques, movement techniques, offensive spells, escape techniques, defensive spells, and so on, are all Dao-grade. Currently, the True Adamant Divine Art you cultivate is Dao-grade. You could practice other Dao-grade arts to create the strongest Daoist Attire," True Monarch Changye explained.

"Yes, Junior Brother," Changyuan added, "I've heard that Dao Sect is filled with geniuses, each with extraordinary backgrounds. Almost every one of them cultivates several Dao-grade arts, making them utterly without weaknesses in all aspects, their strength formidable and unbeatable."

"The difference between ordinary people and geniuses, besides root bone, lies in comprehension. An average person might find it difficult to even begin cultivating a single Dao-grade art for decades or even a century. But geniuses are different; in the same amount of time, they might cultivate several types of Dao-grade arts and achieve great mastery in all of them. Being proficient in both offense and defense, with profound spiritual energy—these are the reasons why those geniuses are powerful and why they can establish themselves in the Dao Sect," True Monarch Changye said.

"Indeed, Dao Sect does not lack powerful cultivation techniques and arts. Those geniuses are almost unbeatable in all aspects, their combat power immense. I had originally intended to find a day to discuss this with you, but since your Martial Uncle has brought it up, I shall explain it in detail."

Jian Yuanzi continued, "To establish yourself in the Dao Sect, besides cultivation techniques, offensive and defensive arts are indispensable. The True Adamant Divine Art you cultivate is Dao-grade, and your offensive art, Returning Hidden Sword, is also Dao-grade. Additionally, the sect has a Dao-grade movement technique. However, you lack a Dao-grade defensive art and a Dao-grade speed art. If you can master all of them, passing the first round of Dao Sect's assessment should be very easy, and the second round would also be no challenge. It's just a pity that our sect lacks Dao-grade defensive arts and Dao-grade speed arts." Jian Yuanzi spoke with unreserved regret.

True Monarch Changye suddenly said, "Indeed, our sect doesn't have these two types of arts. However, Evergreen Gate possesses a Dao-grade speed art, and Southern Origin Sect has a defensive art, though it's only a top-tier art. If the Supreme Being could effectively negotiate, perhaps they could all be acquired."

Jian Yuanzi, however, shook his head. "Back then, the Supreme Being took Changxiao to Evergreen Gate and even intended to exchange two Dao-grade arts for that 'Earth-Shrinking Golden Light.' Unfortunately, Evergreen Gate simply wouldn't budge. Their own geniuses weren't outstanding, and they didn't want to see our Canglan Sect flourish."

"What? The Supreme Being once took Changxiao to Evergreen Gate to exchange arts?" True Monarch Changye frowned.

Jian Yuanzi nodded, "This matter is very secret. I only knew about it because I was Changxiao's master. That year, besides our Supreme Being, the Supreme Being of Southern Origin Sect was also present at Evergreen Gate. The three sects' high-ranking officials held a meeting, and our Supreme Being proposed exchanging arts to complement each other. Unfortunately, the other two sects were selfish and greedy, and the negotiations ultimately broke down, leaving our Supreme Being to return in disappointment. If everyone were a bit more open-minded, our Thousand Islands Sea Region wouldn't have failed to produce a single Void Refinement Realm expert for so many years."

True Monarch Changye's expression slightly hardened, "So, the other two sects are unwilling?"

Jian Yuanzi sighed and nodded.

*Earth-Shrinking Golden Light?*

Yang Ji's expression shifted. He wasn't interested in Southern Origin Sect's top-tier defensive art, as he possessed the superior body-refining art, Humanoid Weapon. However, this Dao-grade speed art, Earth-Shrinking Golden Light, had piqued his interest.

He immediately asked, "Master, what conditions did Evergreen Gate propose back then?"

Jian Yuanzi's expression slightly darkened. "That Evergreen Gate wanted our sect to exchange all our Dao-grade cultivation techniques and arts for it, and the Supreme Being agreed. But Evergreen Gate played a trick, changing their stance at the last minute. When it came time for the exchange, they actually claimed that all our Dao-grade arts and cultivation techniques could only be exchanged for the first volume of Earth-Shrinking Golden Light. Not only were they insatiably greedy, but their attitude was also condescending, as if they were bestowing a favor. Changxiao was unwilling for the Supreme Being to suffer such humiliation, so he proactively suggested abandoning the transaction, and thus they returned to the sect."

True Monarch Changye immediately raged, "All of our Dao-grade cultivation techniques and arts could only be exchanged for the first volume of Earth-Shrinking Golden Light? That Evergreen Gate is simply going too far! Since they agreed to the exchange beforehand, why act so disgustingly?"

Jian Yuanzi sighed, "Who can blame them? Their sect has no genius! If they had a genius like Changxiao, then the Evergreen Gate's Supreme Being, in order to complete their arts, would probably have worn down our sect's threshold from all their visits."
