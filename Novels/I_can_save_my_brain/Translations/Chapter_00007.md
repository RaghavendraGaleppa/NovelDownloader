# Chapter 7: The Birth of the Spirit Fusion Furnace

That's it!

The spirit ore smelting furnace!

Chen Daoxuan suddenly remembered the most pressing issue currently troubling him—the Spirit Fusion Array on the spirit ore furnace. Having previously invented an entirely new array—the Drive Array—he believed his talent in array formations was exceptional. Thus, he sought to create another new array to solve the problem of spirit essence fusion during ore refinement.

Yet after a year of intense contemplation, he still had no breakthroughs.

Within his sea of consciousness space, Chen Daoxuan gazed at the dense clusters of light floating before him. Each cluster represented a piece of knowledge he had acquired, some profound, others simple. In his consciousness, this manifested as variations in the size and brightness of the clusters.

For instance, the cluster he had just activated, representing the "Return to Origin Art," contained all his insights and experiences from five years of practicing this technique. Consequently, it was the brightest and largest among all the clusters.

The second-largest cluster contained his knowledge of artifact forging. Chen Daoxuan immediately activated it. Sure enough, it recorded the crafting techniques and insights for twelve first-grade magical artifacts, along with an incomplete artifact—the spirit ore smelting furnace he had painstakingly researched over the past five years.

"So that's it! That's it!" Chen Daoxuan's consciousness surged with waves of joy and satisfaction. "My previous approach was entirely wrong. Spirit fusion through divine sense uses a forceful suppression method to merge the spiritual essences of multiple ores. Attempting to achieve this suppression through an array is impractical."

"After all, arrays lack intelligence and can only function based on the user's control. Without divine sense, mortals cannot properly gauge the 'intensity' of the suppression. Too much force causes the spiritual essence to collapse; too little prevents fusion."

"Thus, the key to the Spirit Fusion Array lies in guidance, not suppression! Yes, that's it! This is the essence of the Spirit Fusion Array. Following this logic, the array should be arranged like this..."

With the tenfold boost from the merged stardust, Chen Daoxuan's comprehension increased tenfold. What had eluded him for a year was now resolved in less time than it took an incense stick to burn—he had successfully devised the complete Spirit Fusion Array.

Soon, the incense stick burned out. Chen Daoxuan felt darkness envelop him as his consciousness withdrew from the depths of his sea of consciousness.

"It's over." Opening his eyes, he realized the epiphany had ended. "What a pity. If only it could have lasted a little longer," he murmured regretfully.

But thoughts of the Spirit Fusion Array quickly consumed him. The spirit ore smelting furnace was the project he had poured the most effort into since arriving in this world. He had studied forging techniques diligently, aiming to combine knowledge from both lifetimes to create a magical artifact even mortals could use. Only then could the vast mortal population realize their true potential, rather than serving merely as breeding stock for cultivating immortal seeds, as his clansmen in Changping County did.

Now, this artifact was finally about to come to fruition. Unable to contain his excitement, Chen Daoxuan immediately cast the Wind Riding Spell and flew straight from his cave abode toward the mountain housing the Earthfire Chamber. In his haste, his speed was two or three times faster than usual.

In less time than it took to drink half a cup of tea, the three buildings of the Earthfire Chamber came into view. Descending, he pushed open the laboratory door and gazed at the massive silver-white metal furnace at its center, lost in thought.

According to the smelting method he had just conceived during his epiphany, this furnace was clearly a failure. In fact, based on his family's forging traditions, any successful magical artifact should not have visible array patterns on its surface—all inscriptions should merge into the artifact during the final fusion stage. Yet this furnace was covered in array lines.

"Fine, I'll just have to start over," he sighed. He knew it was impossible to add new arrays to this furnace. Artifact forging required a seamless process—one couldn't forge halfway and resume later. This was because of spiritual essence. During the fusion stage, the forger had to perfectly merge the spiritual essence with the shaped artifact blank using arrays to unleash its power.

For any artifact, the dissipation of spiritual essence meant its destruction. Even if the main materials remained intact, rendering it usable as a weapon by mortals, to cultivators, an artifact without spiritual essence was merely a sharper version of ordinary weaponry.

Though his mind raced, his hands moved swiftly. His laboratory was stocked with various spirit ores and ordinary iron ores—yes, iron ores. Such a massive furnace couldn't possibly be made entirely from spirit ores. In truth, the main material of this furnace was ordinary iron ore, with only a small addition of a spirit ore called Moon Silver Stone. Thus, its cost wasn't exorbitant, comparable at most to a first-grade high-tier artifact.

Upon reflection, this made sense. Otherwise, the sheer amount of spirit ore required for such a massive furnace might exceed the entire output of the Chen family's copper mine, defeating its original purpose.

"Thankfully, there's still some Moon Silver Stone left." After rummaging through the laboratory, Chen Daoxuan finally found the spirit ore he needed in a corner. As for ordinary iron ore, that was even less of a concern—the Twin Lakes Island had a sizable iron ore deposit, ensuring an endless supply.

By the time Chen Daoxuan gathered all the necessary materials, it was already noon. Patting the storage pouch at his waist, he pushed open the Earthfire Chamber's bronze door. A wave of heat rushed out as he stepped inside, striding resolutely toward the central Heat Gathering Array.

Though no flames were visible, Chen Daoxuan could sense an immense concentration of heat above the array, ready to melt any materials placed within. He retrieved the iron and Moon Silver ores from his storage pouch, piling them into two mounds—one large, one small.

For a furnace artifact, refining the materials wasn't difficult. The iron ore melted almost instantly upon entering the Heat Gathering Array, transforming into molten metal. Compared to the stubborn spirit ores, ordinary ores were as docile as sheep.

Refining and shaping proceeded without a hitch. Before him, a colossal structure weighing dozens of tons floated mid-air, suspended by his qi.

"Now comes the hardest part—array fusion." Taking a deep breath to steady his surging dantian qi, Chen Daoxuan channeled his energy and began inscribing array patterns onto the furnace.

First layer: Drive Array!  
Second layer: Heat Gathering Array!  
Third layer: Levitation Array!  
And finally, the most crucial fourth layer—Spirit Fusion Array!

"It's done!" As the last array line was completed, the furnace emitted a golden glow that gradually receded as all the patterns merged seamlessly into its structure. Overjoyed, Chen Daoxuan leaped into the air, his excitement rivaling even the moment he had first obtained the "Primordial Enlightenment Scripture."
