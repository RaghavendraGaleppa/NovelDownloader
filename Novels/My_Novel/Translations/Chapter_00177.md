Chapter 177: For My Victory, Affection Grows

The group toured the streets, passing through Red Candle Street and Green Lamp Street, circling around Green Peace Lake. They took a grand tour, admiring the beauty of Green Peace County, and finally arrived at the Yamen.

This place had seen several chaotic battles, and all the constables had been replaced.

Li Xian patted Yuwen Chengji on the shoulder and said solemnly, "Brother Yuwen, in your position, you must plan for your duties. Since you are the County Magistrate, you should think for the people of the county. Put the people first, and do not invent arbitrary charges to extort money for your own enjoyment."

"I am the Military Captain, and I will supervise you on this point. You only need to be worthy of the people, not worthy of me. Do your duty well, and do not worry about anything else."

Yuwen Chengji agreed repeatedly. Rumors from the Prefecture City claimed Li Xian was a scourge to the area, but upon contact, he realized the rumors were untrue. He took office smoothly and settled down in the Yamen from then on.

Li Xian returned the way he came, strolling leisurely around Green Peace Lake. His mood was relaxed; this time, the County Magistrate was not a major trouble.

"The Yuwen family sent Yuwen Chengji, who has no foundation in martial arts and doesn't seem particularly talented. Their purpose is already obvious."

"I didn't expect that before I even arrived at the Prefecture City, my infamy had already spread far and wide."

Li Xian did not fear insults or gossip. Hearing the rumors from the Prefecture City, he found them amusing and forgot them instantly.

He was carefree and content.

Returning to the Military Captain's Hall.

"Military Captain, the Thunderclap Ore you wanted, I have bought it for you." Zhang Hou hugged a black box and happened to run into Li Xian.

Li Xian said, "It has finally arrived!"

To practice "Gang Thunder Finger," one needs to temper the body with the thunder force of "Thunderclap Ore." Li Xian, relying on the Heavenly Dao rewarding diligence, could make progress through sheer hard practice. However, with external aids, the progress could be faster. Several days ago, he had arranged to purchase the Thunderclap Ore, and it arrived today.

Deep in the inner courtyard.

Uninterrupted, Li Xian held the Thunderclap Ore. This item was not cheap; a box of seventy catties cost twenty-four taels of silver.

The minerals came in various shapes. Holding them in his palm, he felt a slight numbness, but they did not electrocute him. The thunder force was hidden in the stone's core and needed a special method to be drawn out.

Li Xian's chest rumbled with thunder. However, it did not sound externally but transmitted to his fingertips, tapping onto the Thunderclap Ore. Electric arcs溢出, crackling.

He drew it into his body.

[You drew thunder force to temper your body, Gang Thunder Finger proficiency +12]

Li Xian practiced diligently, his martial arts progressing gradually, and his food essence was increasingly refined. Recently, Green Peace County had been stable and peaceful, with no major affairs throughout the day.

He practiced martial arts in the Military Captain's Hall during the day and rushed back to Yihe Manor in the evening. Sometimes he accompanied his wife drinking tea and admiring flowers, sometimes practicing swordplay with her, and sometimes helping her with "Silkworm Cloak" seclusion.

Naturally, there were some amorous encounters during these times.

Several days passed like this.

[Food Essence]

[Proficiency: 37/100]

The goal of a martial artist is to exist as enduringly as heaven and earth. Martial arts are derived from heaven and earth, and the essence of heaven and earth is also taken from heaven and earth. Practicing martial arts, exchanging moves, and comprehending heaven and earth all help in digesting the essence.

While advancing in various matters, Li Xian specifically sought out treacherous and fierce criminals to exchange moves with. This sped up the digestion of the heavenly and earthly essence, and the progress was considerable.

[Food Essence realm, proficiency +1]

[Proficiency +1]

Two days later, he took the fourth step, accumulating [40] points of proficiency, reaching the fourth transformation of Food Essence.

Li Xian's body showed abnormalities; the power of the double pupils and the perfect appearance force had both improved. He became more handsome, and his temperament was hard to conceal.

His wife looked at him with increasing satisfaction and joy, her actions becoming more affectionate.

One day.

A message came down from the Prefecture City. Everyone in Green Peace County, from top to bottom, was discussing it. Storytellers in teahouses, casual talks in taverns, and discussions in families were all related to this matter: The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion of Qiongtian Prefecture had released the "Hero List."

The list included the prodigies of the Prefecture City.

In literature, there is no first place; in martial arts, there is no second.

Those who practice martial arts should strive for dominance.

Looking at the world, the four major lists are unquestionably the most authoritative: the List of Heroes, the List of Beauty, the Red List, and the List of Divine Weapons.

Each list is subdivided into "Heaven," "Earth," and "Human" tiers. The Heaven List refers to the whole world, regardless of age or background; those on the list are all hegemonic figures in their own right. The Earth List refers to a specific region, and the Human List is a level below that.

This Hero List, issued by the Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion, holds a certain authority. Upon careful calculation, it should be considered a derivative list of the List of Heroes and the Human List. It收录 those who are under twenty-five years old and are the young prodigies of Qiongtian Prefecture.

Li Xian entered the county early in the morning to buy buns. Hearing others discuss it, he became curious and managed to get a copy of the list. In the Military Captain's Hall, he ate his buns while reading the list:

Hero List, First Place... Wen Wu Zhe Gongzi, Zhou Shijie... Age 25, born with divine strength... In literature, he is blessed with fortune; in martial arts, he can contend for the top.

"What a formidable character," Li Xian thought in surprise. Such a figure does not exist in Green Peace County. He became even more interested and looked further down.

Cao Xiuxiu, Ji Yanhong, Chu Huaiyi, and other women were all on the list, and their rankings were not low. There were also young prodigies like Yuwen Wenhou, Cao Chongmei, and Lin Zhan.

The list only showed names, titles, ages, and deeds. The martial arts used by those on the list, their strengths and weaknesses, could not be seen.

Li Xian felt a bit disappointed but understood: "Martial artists also have weaknesses. If the strengths and weaknesses of the martial arts they use were clearly marked, no one would dare to be on the list. The Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion that issued the list would surely be overturned."

He read with great interest, treating it as a storybook for entertainment. But as he looked through the list, he suddenly saw the name "Li Xian."

[Forty-fourth place, Evil Captain, Li Xian.]

Li Xian raised an eyebrow; he was actually on the list. He immediately looked closely:

"Evil Captain Li Xian, a native of Green Peace, seventeen years old. Deeds: Took the head of a Yellow Dragon Army general. Master unknown, arrogant personality, born with a strange appearance, rumored to be ugly."

"I didn't expect 'Evil Captain' to become my title," Li Xian laughed. "Well, let them do as they please, what does it have to do with me?"

He closed the list and tossed it aside.

Zhang Hou and others spoke out in indignation: "This damn Heavenly Mechanism Pavilion is completely inaccurate. The Military Captain's appearance is described as ugly, it's simply nonsense."

Luo Xia looked at the list with great interest: "I'm curious, if you really go to the Prefecture City, what a spectacle it would be."

Li Xian's face turned dark. "You just want the world in chaos. This time, I won't let you have your way. I definitely won't go to the Prefecture City."

The second day after the list was released.

At noon that day.

A messenger rode a fast horse near the Military Captain's Hall, shouting, "Military Captain Li Xian, here is your token!" He leaped from his horse and shot an arrow, nailing it to a jujube tree in the hall. The messenger turned his horse and immediately left.

Li Xian was practicing martial arts in the hall. He took the token from the arrow, snorted coldly, pulled the arrow out, nocked it to his bow, jumped to a high place, and shot it back, saying loudly, "I have received the token, take this arrow back!" The arrow划过 a弧线, startling the messenger and knocking him off his horse.

The messenger was furious. But seeing this archery technique was exquisite and unparalleled, he dared not say more.

Li Xian examined the token.

It was an invitation, with a simple content: On the twenty-fifth of October, when the first snow falls, let us appreciate a grand banquet together.

Li Xian couldn't help but frown, feeling that it harbored malicious intent.

"If it were a good thing, why would they notify me from thousands of miles away?"

"If I go, how can I return when I am in your territory?" Li Xian sneered and burned the letter right there.

He paid it no more mind and focused on practicing martial arts.

Yihe Manor.

Autumn is deep, and the weather has turned cool.

Li Xian looked at the red gate of the manor and suddenly felt a daze. At this time last year, he was afraid he wouldn't survive the winter and sold himself into the manor. To preserve himself and also to help his younger brother go to the Prefecture City and seize fortune.

Everything... started from here.

Times have changed. Over the past year, many things have happened, and Li Xian has changed greatly. But the situation remains the same; there are still many poor people outside the manor. Seeing that winter is coming, they want to join the manor to seek a way to survive.

Zhao Han, the steward of the servant quarters, was selecting suitable servants to enter the manor.

"Master, please show mercy and let me enter the manor."

"If I don't get money, my little grandson won't survive this winter."

An old woman knelt down and begged, her family in a miserable situation, wanting to sell herself to save her family.

Zhao Han frowned: "But the servant quarters mostly recruit strong men. You don't meet the standard, please go back."

The old woman begged in every possible way, finally falling into despair. She dragged her dirty, tattered clothes and stumbled away. Li Xian remembered himself a year ago and saw a similar tragedy. However, that woman and her child had already become枯 bones on the roadside, frozen and starved to death.

At the time, he watched helplessly, wanting to help but being utterly powerless.

Li Xian quietly followed her and said, "Old lady, can you tend a fire and cook?"

The old woman was stunned and quickly knelt down: "Yes, yes, I can."

"Good, the kitchen needs someone to tend the fire, you come," Li Xian added. "Winter is coming, it's inconvenient for you to walk back and forth. You might as well bring your child here."

After saying this, he left quickly.

How could he help all the tragedies in the world. All he could do was try to see as few as possible.

The old woman kept kowtowing, full of gratitude. This winter, she wouldn't have to die.

Inner courtyard.

The setting sun was like blood. His wife had finished her seclusion yesterday and was free today, sitting in the inner courtyard to pass the time. Seeing Li Xian return, she asked, "Xiao Xian, a Hero Tower Banquet has been held in the Prefecture City, and your name is on the invitation list. What do you think?"

"You know about it too,夫人?" Li Xian said. "This Hero Tower Banquet is full of schemes and calculations. I should stay far away from it."

Madam Wen said, "I naturally know. The invitation was even delivered to my manor."

"It seems they not only invited you but also want to invite me."

"Then,夫人..." Li Xian was puzzled.

既然邀请了，自是走一着。"Since we are invited, we should go," Madam Wen said with a light laugh. "Are you afraid?"

"No," Li Xian shook his head.

"Since you are not afraid," Madam Wen said with a smile, "This Madam wants you to win the championship for me, to suppress all the prodigies of the Prefecture City. Can you do it?"

Li Xian said, "I can definitely do it."

"Oh?" Madam Wen said, "Although the Prefecture City is small, there are quite a few prodigies worth looking at. You have a big mouth."

"Since it is the Madam's request," Li Xian cupped his fist. "Then I will surely be able to do it."

"Good, very good," Madam Wen couldn't hide her joy. "Go rest now. Don't practice martial arts tonight. After bathing, go straight to sleep."

After Li Xian returned to his room to rest, Madam Wen said to the shadows, "Come out."

"Madam," Uncle Xiang came out respectfully, knelt on both knees,叠 his hands, and touched his forehead to the ground. His whole body prostrated itself.

"Have you gathered them all?" Madam Wen's tone was gentle, but those who knew her well could hear the coldness hidden within.

"No..." Uncle Xiang said, "Except for the One Heart Gu, the remaining medicinal herbs have all been collected."

"This Gu is rare. It's within my expectations that you couldn't find it," Madam Wen crossed her legs. "It doesn't matter. If necessary, I will personally go to the Southern Frontier."

"Madam... This old servant... presumes to ask," Uncle Xiang said. "Do you really want to help that boy reshape his spine? Even if you reshape his spine, why use... that method? That is a clan heritage. There is only one set. That Li Xian is just a poor child, what virtue and ability does he have to receive such an honor? It's somewhat... inappropriate."

"There is nothing inappropriate. I have my considerations. There is no need to say more," Madam Wen said softly.

"Allow this old servant to ask one more thing," Uncle Xiang said. "Madam, how do you treat Li Xian..."

Madam Wen remained silent and flicked her sleeve. A strong wind enveloped Uncle Xiang, throwing him out of the inner courtyard and slamming him heavily onto the ground.
