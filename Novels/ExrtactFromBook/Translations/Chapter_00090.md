# Chapter 88: Riding the Bear  

The swarm of Gold-Devouring Bees circled Wu Bing repeatedly, yet none dared approach.  

If any accidentally fell into the gravity trap, they would be utterly unable to escape—their fate far worse than that of the Iron-Eating Beast.  

Though unable to attack directly, the bees had no intention of letting Wu Bing go. The lead bee ascended higher, then angled its venomous stinger toward the bear’s head. A surge of spiritual energy pulsed as it launched the stinger like a projectile.  

The massive bee stood as tall as a person, and its stinger, shimmering with a sinister iridescence, was nearly a meter long. The stinger shot forth with terrifying speed, only for its trajectory to warp as it entered the gravity field. Instead of piercing Wu Bing’s skull, it embedded itself deep into the earth beside him.  

Wu Bing flinched in alarm. Though unable to retaliate, it instinctively raised its massive paws to shield its head.  

After this first trial, the swarm adjusted their aim. One by one, they unleashed their stingers, raining them down upon Wu Bing’s back.  

"ROAR! IT HURTS!"  

Every stinger found its mark, sinking into the bear’s thick hide. Wu Bing let out a deafening howl of agony.  

The Iron-Eating Beast possessed formidable vitality—these venomous needles alone wouldn’t kill it. But the metallic neurotoxin they carried burned like fire, inflicting excruciating pain. Wu Bing collapsed to the ground, writhing and wailing.  

Soon, another volley of stingers followed.  

As long as their spiritual energy held, the Gold-Devouring Bees could unleash an endless barrage.  

Before long, Wu Bing’s back bristled with countless stingers. The sheer volume of toxins left the great bear disoriented and barely conscious, its cries reduced to instinctive whimpers of suffering.  

Han, who had been observing the battle from a distance, knew that without intervention, the bear would be reduced to a pincushion with no hope of survival.  

Without hesitation, he summoned *Xianxian*, his flying sword. A violet arc sliced through the air as the blade, infused with his *Thought-Severing Slash* technique, cleaved effortlessly through all seven bees.  

A metallic *clang* resounded as the swarm was bisected midair, their severed bodies plummeting to the ground in fourteen pieces.  

With its first strike, *Xianxian* had proven its might before returning to Han’s sea of consciousness.  

The battle had been forcibly ended, leaving only the whimpering bear behind.  

By now, Han had mostly recovered. Two-thirds of his skin had regenerated—smooth, fair, and deceptively delicate, yet tougher than steel. In three more days, his wounds would fully heal.  

Once he had consolidated his strength, he could wield the *Lightning Summoning* technique again.  

As he continued meditating, Wu Bing’s cries persisted. Before long, another swarm of bees—thirteen this time—arrived, drawn by the noise.  

Han wasted no time. *Xianxian* flashed out once more, reducing the newcomers to twenty-six lifeless segments.  

The ground was now littered with insect corpses and spilled ichor.  

Yet the bees kept coming.  

Wave after wave descended upon them. Han dispatched them all—eleven swarms in total, amounting to over a hundred and ninety first-tier demonic beasts. Their bodies formed a grotesque mound.  

Only after the final wave fell did the onslaught cease.  

After a long wait, Han finally emerged from hiding, his injuries fully healed. He landed atop the pile of corpses and called out to the still-groaning panda:  

"Enough already. Aren’t you tired of howling?"  

To his surprise, the bear immediately fell silent.  

It had been faking its distress all along.  

"No more bees are coming. Save your breath and figure out how to escape this gravity trap."  

The panda twisted its neck with difficulty, peeking at Han before speaking:  

"Are you a cultivator from Iron-Eating City? Why did you help me? I don’t recognize you."  

Han responded by slashing his sword near the bear’s head, carving a deep gash into the earth. The panda shuddered violently—this weapon was far deadlier than any bee’s stinger.  

"*I’ll* ask the questions. Who are you, and can you escape this gravity trap?"  

Though Han bore no killing intent, he wouldn’t tolerate insolence from this unruly bear.  

"Esteemed sir, I am Wu Bing, a member of Iron-Eating City’s beast clans! I’ve always been on good terms with human cultivators—everyone adores me!"  

The bear’s tone instantly became more respectful.  

"I need to chew through this gravity field, disrupting its energy to escape. It’ll take years, but if you could lend a hand, I’d be eternally grateful!"  

"Also, I know where these bees nest. I can lead you to their honey!"  

Escaping a gravity trap was no easy feat. Only by thoroughly destabilizing the area’s energy field could the gravitational pull weaken enough to break free. This required immense destructive power—something the Iron-Eating Beast lacked.  

However, by consuming metals to replenish its energy, Wu Bing could slowly gnaw its way out. The process would just take an absurdly long time.  

Han smirked.  

"I’ll free you—on one condition."  

"You have to let me ride you."  

The idea struck him on a whim. With a lull between *Lightning Summoning* sessions, a majestic panda mount sounded like excellent entertainment.  

Wu Bing’s face twisted in conflict. But after glancing at the mountain of bee corpses and the sword scar beside it, the bear relented.  

"Very well, sir! You may ride me. My fur is soft—you’ll find me quite comfortable!"  

Truly, this bear knew when to bend and when to stand firm.
