**Chapter 143: Bloodshed**

“Howl…”

Under the night sky, wolf howls echoed one after another. Through the thick fog, hordes of wolf monsters approached, their green eyes eerily menacing, surrounding the area.

Outside the Wolf Hall, Qin Ming stood silently, blade in hand. He was completely surrounded by dangerous creatures on all sides, truly unable to escape, as even the sky above was overlooked by the strongest Black Roc.

“Who tipped you off?” Qin Ming asked, a strong emotion swirling in his chest. The four old demons had seemingly anticipated his arrival. Had he been sold out, or had something gone wrong in his plans? The four old demons had set up a killing trap in advance, waiting for him.

The four-meter-tall Silver Wolf King, its bright fur gleaming as if bathed in moonlight, clutched a wolf-tooth club. It bared a mouthful of stark white teeth and said chillingly, “It’s better for you to die bewildered and confused. You struck me twice today, and you still dream of dying as an enlightened ghost? Dream on! I’ll make sure you die utterly frustrated!”

The giant beast covered in scarlet scales spoke, “Fourth Brother, you are truly disappointing. You were heavily wounded in just a moment. If we had been any later, your Wolf Hall would have been removed from the map.”

“Second Brother Fire-Scaled Lion, this young man is very troublesome. Be careful later,” the Silver Wolf King warned, blood still dripping from its neck and chest.

The giant beast had an extraordinary lineage, with a trace of Fire Qilin’s true blood flowing within its veins, ranking second among the four old demons.

Qin Ming frowned. Would he die here today? He had gone all out, yet failed to kill the fourth-ranked Silver Wolf King. The other three old demons would only be stronger.

“Little brat, was it you who killed one of my sworn brothers a few days ago?” The Old Donkey spoke, sitting in a sedan chair, its donkey face taut and looking profound. The four creatures carrying its sedan chair were grotesque: a pig demon, a dog demon, a sheep demon, and a rat demon. This combination hardly looked benevolent.

“I haven’t killed any donkeys!” Qin Ming retorted, observing the terrain and analyzing the power disparity between them, figuring out which direction would be best for a breakthrough.

“Impudent! How dare you disrespect Master Lü?” the dog demon carrying the sedan chair barked.

The Old Donkey stepped out of the sedan, standing upright, also nearly four meters tall. Dressed in luxurious silk and satin, it resembled an old patriarch if one ignored its pitch-black donkey face. It said coldly, “My sworn brother was Master Huang.”

With that, it suddenly lunged forward, directly attacking!

“Third Brother, watch out for his blade!” the Silver Wolf King shouted loudly.

The Old Donkey was fierce. Its four-meter-tall body was incredibly imposing. Its fist and leg techniques were astonishing. As it charged, standing upright, sand and stones flew, accompanied by strong winds and rolling black mist, truly like a great demon passing through, its aura powerful!

Qin Ming dared not be careless in the slightest, exercising extreme caution. In an instant, the sheep-fat jade iron blade in his hand burst forth with dazzling light, tearing open the thick black mist as he engaged in close combat with the Old Donkey.

One had to admit, the Old Donkey’s boxing was formidable. It immediately unleashed sonic booms. It excelled at smashing punches, striking downwards with its hooves from above with resounding thuds. Each of its hoof-punches broke the sound barrier, terrifyingly, its two hooves enveloped in white mist. The Old Donkey’s patriarch’s robe flapped violently as it moved at high speed.

Its footwork was also intimidating and extremely lethal, occasionally lashing out with a hoof. With a clang, the ground itself cracked from its kicks.

The Old Donkey was a master of pugilism, kindred spirits with the weasel blade master, Master Huang. Now, with a punch from its left and a kick from its right, it wished it could immediately smash that human youth to smithereens.

However, in just a moment, it rapidly retreated. It wasn't that it was outmatched; its cultivation was profound, and its Heavenly Light Qi was terrifying. It was mainly Qin Ming, who, breaking through its released demonic qi and fist-light, counterattacked with his sheep-fat jade iron blade, trimming its hooves.

The Old Donkey looked down at its two front hooves, each missing more than half, having been shaved off slice by slice by that human youth, almost bald. Some wolf monsters wanted to laugh, but held back.

“Bring me my gauntlets!” the Old Donkey said gravely. As a party involved, it was very meticulous and serious, as if it would never smile in its life.

The dog demon immediately stepped forward and put on the Old Donkey’s special metal gauntlets, which contained a small amount of jade iron.

The Fire-Scaled Lion spoke, “Your donkey temper, it’s truly stubborn. We are here to kill, not to spar. Why are you fighting him alone?”

The Old Donkey was receptive to advice and immediately said, “Second Brother is right. We should all attack together and kill him as soon as possible. This human youth is only a teenager, yet he possesses such strength without even stepping into the Outer Saint realm. It is truly something I have never seen in my life.”

Qin Ming’s expression turned grim. If the donkey demon had worn its alloy gauntlets earlier, it could have fought him to a standstill. He didn’t even need to think to know that the Fire-Scaled Lion and the Black Roc were even more powerful; he probably wasn’t their match. If all four old demons were to attack simultaneously now, normally, he would have no way out.

In an instant, Qin Ming moved, pouncing towards the Silver Wolf King, who had been struck twice by him earlier and was already severely wounded. The bright, gleaming blade in his hand radiated chilling light.

In mid-air, a deafening roar sounded as the Black Roc, bearing the might of thunder, swooped down, emitting a booming sound. It wasn’t immensely huge, perhaps ten meters long, but its aura was incredibly terrifying. The Black Roc was like a burning black sun, emitting astonishing energy fluctuations. It arrived in an instant like lightning, its sharp claws seeming to twist space, shattering the night fog.

Even with his jade iron blade, Qin Ming did not dare to confront it head-on, rapidly moving sideways to evade. The Black Roc’s speed was too fast, surpassing all living beings present, and it was incredibly agile. When its claws missed, it swept horizontally with its black wings, following through.

The nearly ten-meter-long Roc wings carried dark light, like black flames burning. Demonic qi, fiendish qi, and Heavenly Light surged from its body, mixed together. Although only about a meter away from its body, it was exceptionally terrifying. Qin Ming used his jade iron blade to cleave, barely cutting into the aura. It was still a foot away from its wing, but it felt like sinking into a quagmire, and a horrifying fluctuation churned the blade, nearly making it slip from his hand.

With a crash, he was sent flying by the Black Roc’s wing, hit by the mixture of Heavenly Light and fiendish qi. Even his Heavenly Light Qi was nearly scattered. Qin Ming flew more than twenty meters, blood at the corner of his mouth, landing on the ground and stumbling, almost falling.

In mid-air, the Black Roc stood upright, its wings like two arms held to its sides. Its entire body was steaming with dense black light and fiendish qi, like raging black flames.

Qin Ming’s crisis had only just begun. As soon as he landed, the Fire-Scaled Lion charged over. Its momentum was astonishing, causing earth and stone to crack and the ground to shake. Its lion-like body was covered in scarlet armor, glowing with fire. It was even larger than a giant elephant and incredibly fast.

Qin Ming continuously dodged. However, although the Fire-Scaled Lion was like a small mountain, it was extremely agile and nimble, following his movements. When it opened its massive maw, fire rolled out, and Heavenly Light surged forward like waves.

Qin Ming gritted his teeth, activating his Wind Qi, swiftly moving to its side, and swung his sheep-fat jade iron blade at it. The Fire-Scaled Lion had a wide mouth and tusks, its mane quivering, its entire body’s scarlet armor clanging. Demonic qi and Heavenly Light burst forth, and crimson radiance shone in all directions, exceptionally dazzling. It sneered, taking the blade strike head-on.

Qin Ming’s expression was grim because his blade strike once again failed. Although it sliced into the dense crimson radiance and fire, as it barely touched its scales, the blade’s momentum dissipated, its power gone. Amidst the clang, sparks flew, and he failed to break through the scarlet scales.

With a boom, the Fire-Scaled Lion swung its paw, as large as a small winnowing basket, carrying crimson flames, and swatted it down at Qin Ming’s head. Even an elephant standing there would be crushed by its single paw. Qin Ming had nowhere to dodge, so he activated his Heavenly Light Qi again, thrusting his long blade forward. Although he blocked the paw, he himself was sent flying more than ten meters away.

Qin Ming was well aware that the Fire-Scaled Lion’s strength also surpassed his. As he landed on the ground, the Old Donkey had already rushed over, unleashing its boxing techniques on him. At the same time, the Black Roc swooped down, carrying endless black light. When the mixture of fiendish qi and Heavenly Light touched the ground, it pulverized rocks and caused the earth to crack, sweeping everything away. The Old Donkey retreated, making way for the Black Roc.

Qin Ming faced a life-or-death crisis. At this moment, his three wondrous techniques and eighteen perfected Heavenly Light Qi merged into one. His body hummed, erupting with brilliant and sacred light. However, even using the Silk Script to merge all the Heavenly Light throughout his body and displaying his strongest means, he was still sent flying by the Black Roc, spitting mouthfuls of blood.

Although the sheep-fat jade iron blade in his hand broke through the opponent’s black light and struck its wing, only a few black feathers drifted down; it didn't wound the flesh. The Heavenly Light and fiendish qi emanating from the Black Roc, though only extending a little over a meter, were terrifyingly potent, far surpassing any Outer Saints Qin Ming had seen.

Roar!

A lion’s roar shook the heavens, sending sand and stones flying. The Fire-Scaled Lion arrived, its massive paws slamming down. Although Qin Ming fought with all his might, he still couldn’t withstand it. Blood covered his mouth and nose, and he was sent flying. The Heavenly Light Qi on his body, even after merging into one, dimmed, almost scattering.

The Fire-Scaled Lion glanced at the scarlet scales that had been broken by the sheep-fat jade iron blade. It bled slightly, but it was far from a serious injury. When Qin Ming fell to the ground about ten meters away, this time not only the Old Donkey attacked, but the heavily wounded Silver Wolf King also approached, swinging its wolf-tooth club to smash him. Qin Ming had no time to get up, quickly rolling away. The wolf-tooth club grazed his ear as it slammed into the ground, causing earth and stone to burst apart, leaving a deep crater.

The Old Donkey leaped even higher this time, using all four hooves simultaneously to unleash its boxing techniques, smashing downwards. Qin Ming rolled again, dodging the heavy four hoof-punches, and finally found an opportunity to get up.

However, the most powerful Black Roc reappeared, its wings unmoving, as if it could stand still in the void. It extended a claw, and black light shot out. Qin Ming’s blade failed to cut through all the dark light emitted by its sharp claw, and his protective Heavenly Light also failed to block everything. With a *thump*, blood splattered on his arm and chest, with a bloodied hole appearing in each location, nearly wounding his internal organs.

The Fire-Scaled Lion followed up, its winnowing basket-sized paw striking down, carrying raging flames and surging, fiery red light. Qin Ming could not dodge. He once again held his blade with both hands, activating his Heavenly Light Qi, and clashed head-on with it. With a crash, he was slammed downwards, the ground collapsing and then bursting open again.

At the same time, the Silver Wolf King swung its wolf-tooth club to strike, while the Old Donkey, with its back to Qin Ming, kicked out with its hind hooves. The Black Roc was too large to attack simultaneously with the Fire-Scaled Lion. It stood still in mid-air, two cold bolts of lightning shooting from its eyes as it looked down.

Qin Ming was violently slammed into the large pit by the giant lion’s paw, fire accompanied by Heavenly Light covering him. With a *bang*, the Silver Wolf King’s wolf-tooth club swept across, hitting his chest. If not for the Fire-Scaled Lion’s massive paws covering and suppressing him from above, it surely would have smashed Qin Ming’s skull.

Qin Ming spat out a large mouthful of blood, his Heavenly Light almost dispersed. This time, he bore the attack head-on because the Fire-Scaled Lion’s two massive paws descended, eager to crush him. He swung his jade iron blade with all his might to counter. He felt intense pain in his chest, part of his Heavenly Light was scattered, and a wolf fang embedded itself in his flesh, breaking off inside. This was actually a "True Wolf Fang" club! The large iron rod had fangs embedded in it that the Silver Wolf King had shed over the years as its cultivation advanced. It had once almost become a silver-tier creature and had a glorious past, but ultimately failed its evolution.

Qin Ming took a deep breath. He had never suffered such a heavy loss before, with a wolf fang stuck in his chest and the Fire-Scaled Lion bombarding him from above. Meanwhile, his back was in severe pain, having been kicked twice by the Old Donkey, breaking two ribs on his lower back.

Roar! The Fire-Scaled Lion let out a low growl, revealing a mocking smile. Clearly, it had not yet unleashed its full power. Now, it suddenly swung its massive paw. With a boom, the ground shattered, and Qin Ming, covered in blood, was smashed underground, his Heavenly Light Qi on his body scattering.

However, he quickly erupted with Heavenly Light again and rushed out. The second terrifying lion's paw did not miss but swept across, hitting him. With a *thump*, Qin Ming suffered severe injuries, with at least four fractures on his body, specifically his left arm and three ribs on his left side. At the same time, he spat out large mouthfuls of blood and fell far away.

The Silver Wolf King grinned ferociously, clutching its wolf-tooth club, ignoring its own injuries, and pressed forward. The Old Donkey also wore a cold expression, intending to avenge its sworn brother, Huang Yuan.

Qin Ming struggled, quickly getting to his feet. He had one last resort, which he most wanted to use on the Black Roc. Otherwise, even if he managed to break through, he wouldn’t be able to outrun it. If he didn't kill or heavily wound the Black Roc, he would surely die today!

At this moment, Qin Ming was covered in blood, surrounded by the four old demons. The Black Roc was like a setting sun, casting its black light everywhere. That was its protective light screen, terrifying and impenetrable to outsiders. Now, it was very close to Qin Ming. And it took the initiative to attack, extending its sharp claw.

Qin Ming took a deep breath, adjusted his state, and, regardless of the cost, gathered his merged Heavenly Light Qi, concentrating it all into the jade iron blade in his hand. He looked like he wanted to fight the Black Roc to the death, determined to battle to the very end.

Rumble!

As the Black Roc approached, the ground cracked open; the scene was somewhat astonishing. The black light emanating from its body was too incredible. Qin Ming fought with all his might, barely avoiding its sharp claw. Then, with all his strength, he used the jade iron blade to cut open the black light and stabbed towards its abdomen. However, even with all his might, he only managed to touch the Black Roc’s surface, unable to shake the black light any further.

“Do you know what it means for an ant to try to shake a tree?” the Fire-Scaled Lion asked, its massive body causing the ground to tremble slightly as it approached.

At this moment, Qin Ming felt a sense of relief. He had already done his best, using his blade to cleave open the Black Roc’s protective black light and touching its body. He was covered in blood, enduring immense pressure within the black light, his bones creaking as if they might collapse at any moment. The Black Roc was crushing him with its fiendish qi and Heavenly Light, looking down coldly! The Heavenly Light on Qin Ming’s body was already very dim.

Suddenly, a strange light burst from his body, carrying a sword-shaped pendant resembling a piece of mutton-fat jade. It shot rapidly along the jade iron blade. The black light in that area had already been dispelled by the jade iron blade in advance.

With a *plop*, the strange light propelled the thumb-sized white sword to pierce into the Black Roc’s body, twisting forcefully. The small sword was forged from a unique metal, the same material found in the Bagua Furnace, a near-immortal artifact. It could pierce through Heavenly Light, divine wisdom, and spiritual consciousness!

In a flash, the pure white small sword flew through the Black Roc’s body and out. Although the strange light had dimmed, it still pierced into the forehead of the Fire-Scaled Lion, which was standing close by. The incident was sudden; no one expected the dying Qin Ming to still be able to launch such a fierce attack.

“Argh…” The Black Roc shrieked, rapidly flapped its wings, and flew towards the night sky.

The Fire-Scaled Lion let out a roar, fully activating its power to shake out the pure white small sword. However, a small amount of brain matter clung to the sword’s body. The Fire-Scaled Lion frantically shook its head, screaming, and rapidly retreated, covering its head with its massive paws. It, too, was heavily wounded.

This was a new ability that emerged during Qin Ming’s sixth rebirth. That strange light was equivalent to his strongest attack at his peak state, capable of traveling several meters away from his body, unaffected by his physical weakness. The strange light dimmed, and Qin Ming, utilizing its last glow, retrieved the pure white small sword. He desperately wanted to rush forward and finish them, but he knew that his own condition was terrible. Even if the Fire-Scaled Lion was heavily wounded, he couldn't kill it.

Qin Ming, holding the silver small sword, charged towards the Old Donkey, which was so frightened it turned and fled. With two of its sworn brothers inexplicably heavily wounded by this sword, how could it not be scared? Qin Ming ignored it, swinging his blade to strike the Silver Wolf King.

“You…” After several clashes, both heavily wounded figures stumbled. Finally, the Silver Wolf King’s head was severed. It despaired, unwilling, its eyes dimming.

Qin Ming cut open its body with a single stroke and found a silver heart. It carried a bloody scent, yet also a faint fragrance. He took the silver heart and quickly rushed into the distance.

“Howl…” The wolf monsters, who had been ordered to retreat, howled and charged at Qin Ming, but they couldn't stop him at all.

“Third Brother, go chase him! That human youth is at the end of his rope!” The Black Roc stumbled as it landed. Its internal organs were severely damaged, and it needed time to recover.

“Old Donkey, go quickly!” the Fire-Scaled Lion also roared. Its head was splitting with pain, and it dared not move recklessly for now.

Qin Ming fled for his life across the Divine Demise Great Plains.
