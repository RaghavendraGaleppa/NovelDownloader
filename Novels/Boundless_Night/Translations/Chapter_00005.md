# Chapter 5: Rebirth

Qin Ming nodded solemnly. It was time to figure out how to achieve "Rebirth." This was a major event, concerning one's entire life and influencing future destiny. Fifteen or sixteen was the golden period; "Rebirth" at this age yielded the most benefits, and missing it would be a great pity. But it was difficult. The elite of Twin Tree Village all achieved "Rebirth" after twenty, and some even succeeded past thirty. Even so, with over forty households and more than two hundred people in the entire village, those who achieved "Rebirth" totaled less than ten.

Lu Ze spoke, "Er Bingzi from the neighboring village succeeded, right within the golden period."

Qin Ming had an impression of Er Bingzi: thin, sallow, looking somewhat sickly, with sparse, withered-grass-colored hair. He was deeply surprised that the seemingly frail youth had actually achieved "Rebirth" during the golden age.

"When did this happen?"

"Almost a month ago," Lu Ze informed. After achieving Rebirth, Er Bingzi had directly lifted the four-hundred-jin black donkey in the courtyard, completely transforming from his former weak self.

"That's truly rare." Qin Ming hadn't expected so many ox-strong youths to fail repeatedly, while Er Bingzi succeeded at the first attempt.

Lu Ze also felt something: he was strong and robust, considered formidable among young adults, yet he was twenty-three and still hadn't achieved "Rebirth."

"It's said to be related to one of his relatives." Lu Ze knew some inside information. Er Bingzi's not-so-close relative, who had been traveling for years, saw him upon returning this time and deemed him a good prospect. That person said Er Bingzi had minor health issues before, failing to lock in his essence, qi, and spirit, which was why he was sickly, but his potential was actually immense. Most crucially, that person brought back a high-level "Intent Qi Art" and had Er Bingzi switch to practicing it. The effects were remarkably significant, ultimately leading to his "Rebirth."

Qin Ming was lost in thought; human fortunes were indeed unpredictable.

"Afterward, that person said Er Bingzi's innate 'foundation' was far more solid than he had initially guessed, and he might go very far."

Lu Ze had never expected someone who had been sickly for years to become so powerful.

"Although we don't have high-level Intent Qi Arts, we do have viable methods. Little Qin, I think you should change your special training method," Lu Ze advised. In his opinion, Qin Ming's physical quality was very strong, even stronger than his own, far surpassing ordinary people. However, despite such excellent conditions, Qin Ming had been slow to achieve "Rebirth." The problem most likely lay in his self-cultivation method, which failed to nurture the power of rebirth and couldn't carry him forward. He was now just over sixteen. If he continued like this, he would truly miss the golden period.

Liang Wanqing also advised, "Little Qin, why not switch to practicing your Brother Lu's 'Night Meditation Art'?"

Eternal Night enveloped the world, and the wilderness was extremely dangerous. In such an environment, various places had publicly available strength manuals to allow everyone to improve their physique for self-preservation. Of course, these books were far from high-end, and even further from rare secret texts.

Qin Ming wasn't stubborn; knowing their good intentions, he nodded, "I'll give it a serious try next."

Lu Ze sighed lightly, believing Qin Ming had been delayed by the "wild method" he usually practiced, which was far inferior to the low-level "Elementary Night Meditation Art" he himself practiced. It was just that switching now would make time too tight. He mused that only a high-level Intent Qi Art could help Qin Ming change his current situation in a short time.

Lu Ze exhaled a turbid breath, saying, "Sigh, even a mid-level secret manual would be good. It would be such a pity if someone with your conditions missed the most precious golden period."

However, the only widely circulated books in this area that could help people achieve "Rebirth" were a few like "Floating Life Art: Introductory Chapter" and "Elementary Night Meditation Art," all of similar caliber.

Qin Ming wasn't anxious, mainly because the movements he had practiced for years were showing effects. There was a faint silver ripple flowing on his body surface; though subtle, it had genuinely manifested, unlike in the past. His refined face carried a healthy flush, and his eyes were bright as he said, "Brother Lu, Sister-in-law, just wait a while longer, I think I can succeed."

Rebirth: On the basis of one's original physical quality, vibrant vitality surges, like returning to the womb, re-nurturing vigorous new life force. In the mundane world's turbid qi, one's physical conditions are usually solidified. If one's "foundation" undergoes another development, it's akin to a postnatal womb transformation. Who wouldn't be tempted by this?

For instance, Er Bingzi, originally somewhat frail, could, after Rebirth, grab hundreds of jins of living creatures with both hands and lift them above his head. This kind of change was truly astonishing, no less than changing one's fate. Imagine, after practicing the Night Meditation Art, Lu Ze could already break green bricks and snap wooden dummies. If he underwent "Rebirth" and his strength greatly increased, how terrifying would his fists and feet become?

"After all my old ailments are gone, I feel different; my physical state is better than ever before." Qin Ming was very confident now.

Lu Ze and Liang Wanqing hadn't said anything yet when five-year-old Wen Rui was already nodding earnestly, his rosy little face full of anticipation. He said, "Little Uncle is the strongest! After Little Uncle succeeds, catch some mountain beasts to stew for meat. I... I'm craving it."

Little Wen Hui, just over two, toddled closer and echoed, his words unclear, "Little Uncle... strong, eat meat."

Qin Ming immediately smiled, "No need to wait. I can satisfy you today." Saying this, he took down the red squirrel hanging on his hunting fork. The mutated squirrel's large, black-gem-like eyes seemed about to pop out, then it showed a look of terror.

"Huh, it's alive again. This is even better; the meat will be much fresher than if it were frozen." Qin Ming held it up, examining it.

"This squirrel is so beautiful, and a little cute," Wen Rui said, his big eyes blinking, genuinely fond of the fluffy little animal.

"It'll be even cuter when stewed, I guarantee you'll enjoy eating it," Qin Ming chuckled.

Wen Rui immediately became conflicted. He was indeed craving meat, having not eaten it for a long time, but seeing such a small creature with fiery red, glowing fur, he couldn't tear his eyes away. He wanted to get close to it, hoping to keep it as a pet. Little Wen Hui followed his older brother, mimicking him, his bright eyes reflecting the red squirrel's image as he mumbled indistinctly, "Squirrel... cute."

Lu Ze and Liang Wanqing looked at the two children and both smiled.

Qin Ming agreed, saying, "It truly is cute and capable. Look, it has so much food for winter: pine nuts, walnuts, hazelnuts, red dates, everything imaginable, no less than a dozen kinds. It even stored mushrooms. This is great, stewed squirrel with mushrooms, delicious and very nourishing!"

"R-really? But... I don't want it to die." Wen Rui tugged at his clothes, his little face filled with a conflicted expression, though he didn't forget to swallow his saliva.

"Of course! Look, among these mushrooms, there are even tiger paw mushrooms and sun sparrow mushrooms. These are well-known mountain delicacies! You're in for a treat now. Indeed, mutated creatures always select the best." Qin Ming praised.

The red squirrel was extremely agitated, its fur standing on end.

Qin Ming drew his short knife, picked it up, and prepared to go to the courtyard to skin it. Such a bloody sight was not suitable for the two children to see.

"Squeak, squeak!" The small mutated mountain beast was instantly terrified, squeaking non-stop in panic, struggling violently. The wire wrapped around it was almost cutting into its flesh.

"Little Uncle, why don't you... leave it alive?" Wen Rui stopped him, trying hard to forget the taste of stewed meat, as if he had made up his mind, pleading here.

"What excellent ingredients! The meat of mutated creatures is the most delicious," Qin Ming said, smiling alluringly.

"We won't eat it this time. After Little Uncle achieves Rebirth, he'll definitely be able to hunt ferocious, big mutated creatures. I'll wait for Little Uncle to succeed." Wen Rui's compassion arose, resisting the temptation of food.

The mutated squirrel was very nervous, looking at the knife in Qin Ming's hand one moment, then squeaking at Wen Rui the next, as if seeking help.

Liang Wanqing was surprised, "This little mountain beast is incredibly intelligent. It seems to understand what you're saying; look at its little face, all wrinkled with tension."

Qin Ming put away his short knife. Such a small creature didn't have much meat, and it was originally just to satisfy the children's cravings. Since they liked living animals, he might as well keep it.

Lu Ze slightly furrowed his brows, "This winter is unlike before; where would we get extra food for it?"

The mutated squirrel gazed longingly at the bulging animal skin bag; it contained all its savings!

Qin Ming also noticed that this little mountain beast was indeed remarkably intelligent. He picked out some acorns from the pile of dried fruits and said, "These nuts need to be processed before eating, otherwise they're slightly toxic and bitter. They'll be perfect for feeding the squirrel."

The red squirrel didn't squeak, just stared at him with wide eyes, its breathing slightly coarse.

"Aren't you satisfied just to live? Also, if you dare to bite anyone, I guarantee I'll stew you," Qin Ming warned, placing it into an iron cage used for birds.

Lu Ze felt it would be better to sell the mutated squirrel. After all, its fiery red, brilliant fur was valuable, and keeping it would waste food and energy. But when he saw the two children's immense joy, laughing and jumping, he no longer voiced his opposition. As they parted, Lu Ze took the iron cage and a pile of acorns, declining other dried goods. Without saying more to him, Qin Ming slipped a cloth bag filled with walnuts and pine nuts into Liang Wanqing's hand, for the two children as snacks.

***

After temporarily escaping the predicament of food scarcity, Qin Ming began to seriously consider the issue of Rebirth. Lu Ze saying that his "wild method" had delayed him indeed stirred some ripples in his heart. He vaguely remembered some blurry fragments from his childhood; someone had once told him that while those movements had origins, they likely couldn't be mastered.

A moment later, he came to the courtyard. He decided to follow his own rhythm first. The "wild method" he had practiced for over a decade was clearly different now; there was no reason not to continue. Qin Ming moved his joints, stretched his muscles and bones, twisting, rotating, turning, flipping, all fluidly and without stagnation. He suddenly leapt from the ground, swift as an iron arrow shot forth, yet landing as light as a swallow, without a sound. He shifted between stillness and motion: sitting like a tiger crouching, walking like wading through mud, and turning as smoothly as he pleased. Then he spun, swinging his leg like lightning, akin to a dragon-python lashing its tail in mid-air, producing a dull thud.

After a simple warm-up, Qin Ming began performing various high-difficulty movements. "Inhale and exhale, expel the old and take in the new, bear's stride, owl's gaze..." He stretched his form, strong and powerful, actually stirring up fierce winds that whirled the snow on the ground, swirling and dancing around him.

Soon, the familiar sensation came. In Qin Ming's pores, incredibly faint silver threads intertwined, rippling into waves, forming a very light stream of light on his body surface. Gradually, white mist steamed from his entire body. A warm current flowed through his flesh and blood, like sweet rain falling after a great drought, with cracked earth greedily absorbing raindrops. Qin Ming's movements consumed a great deal of energy, but he felt no fatigue; instead, he was refreshed. His body seemed to be cheering, as if it had been hungry for a long time and now wanted to be full, continuously absorbing the silver ripples. His flesh and blood tingled, and his whole body was gaining strength. Was this Rebirth about to happen?

Qin Ming's body felt hot and agitated; he had an urge to run and fully expend his vigorous energy, and so he acted on it. He galloped through the wilderness, like a meteor streaking across the night sky, going far, almost reaching the mountain forest area.

In the distant snowy expanse, a tall and slender woman stood still. Her black fur cloak flowed with a faint dark luster, covering her fair neck, revealing only her delicate chin, exuding a mysterious, cold demeanor.

A crow perched on a clump of thorns beside her, speaking in human tongue: "Oh, self-initiated Rebirth, with unusual phenomena in the initial stage, like moonlight scattering across his body, stirring up layers of fragmented golden ripples."

"I sense this is a good prospect, very rare, to appear in such a remote place." Its entire body of black feathers gleamed like dark gold, and it had a pair of purple eyes, watching ahead, saying, "Isn't your teacher selecting a final disciple? This youth might be suitable."

The woman stood on a large blue stone. The cold wind blew, and her loose cloak clung to her body, barely concealing her exceptionally beautiful curves. Her voice, however, was slightly cold: "There is someone more suitable than him."

Qin Ming seemed to sense something, turning his head to look into the distance, bow and arrow already in hand.

"Very keen intuition," the crow commented. By now, it was in the dense forest, speaking to the woman beside it, "Your teacher's path is very special. Don't genuinely miss a seed with potential for vigorous growth."

"Not being chosen is a regret he won't know about. What can I miss? I already have the best candidate." The mountain wind howled, the woman's glossy black hair fluttered, obscuring one side of her pale cheek, her black clothes rustling. Amidst her pure and ethereal beauty, she appeared even more cold and stunning. She walked forward, saying, "Currently, investigating the mountains is more important."
