# Chapter 163: Unexpected Changes Upon Emerging from Seclusion

The stone door of the secret chamber creaked open, and Lin Shan stepped out after a decade of closed-door cultivation. The glaring sunlight made him instinctively raise a hand to shield his eyes—after ten years in darkness, his vision needed time to adjust.

Counting the years, he was now thirty-three years old. In this world where adulthood came at sixteen, he had fully transitioned from youth to manhood. This realization made him sigh—despite his relentless cultivation efforts, copious pill consumption, and the assistance of his enhancement panel to break through bottlenecks, he still hadn't matched the natural talent of Qi Zhong, the former core disciple of Qianyun Pavilion. That prodigy had maintained a youthful bone structure even while at mid Foundation Establishment stage.

As expected, the Black Bone Demon Lord in the courtyard had also recovered to mid Foundation Establishment strength. With its original body being at the Nascent Soul stage, breaking through minor bottlenecks like Foundation Establishment was as effortless as drinking water—only forming a Golden Core or Nascent Soul posed any real challenge.

A small sapling darted playfully around the courtyard while the Black Bone Demon Lord's unknown flowers and herbs, planted out of boredom over the past decade, swayed gently in the nearby spirit fields.

"You've hidden your talents well—a master alchemist, no less," the skeleton remarked, its jaw clacking as if still savoring the wisps of purple mist that had escaped the chamber earlier. But when it sensed Lin Shan's cultivation level, its skeletal frame stiffened. How had this kid progressed so rapidly, matching its own recovery speed as a former Nascent Soul expert?

Lin Shan chuckled and settled onto a stone bench, immediately asking about the tasks he'd assigned. The demon lord tossed him a long wooden box containing over a dozen small vials and several green twigs.

"Ten years' worth of Illusion Spirit Liquid and Illusion Spirit Wood. I only kept a small portion for myself."

Lin Shan nodded without comment. It was only fair to leave some benefits for his skeletal companion—after all, a skeleton had no use for the liquid anyway. His gaze drifted to the carefree sapling playing in the fields, confirming it hadn't been bled dry. He silently approved of the demon lord's restraint in harvesting—the art of shearing sheep without harming them.

Applying the liquid to his eyes, Lin Shan felt a warm, soothing sensation as his vision swam with shifting colors before stabilizing. When he reopened his eyes, the hidden formations around the cave became faintly visible.

"Consistent use builds resistance to illusions over time," the skeleton explained. "Eventually you'll see through most veils and detect hidden arrays before stumbling into them."

Lin Shan nodded regretfully. With proper formation knowledge, these spirit-enhanced eyes would be even more powerful. Then he remembered—while he lacked such expertise, Little Xin, the artifact spirit of the Void Star Disk, possessed it!

As if summoned by his thoughts, the Black Bone Demon Lord suddenly froze, its hollow eye sockets fixed intently on him.

"Why are you staring?" Lin Shan asked, rubbing his face self-consciously. Unless flowers had bloomed on his cheeks, this scrutiny seemed excessive.

At that moment, a pigtailed girl materialized behind Lin Shan, peeking out curiously—especially at the playing sapling—before ducking back nervously.

But to the demon lord's perception, this was no ordinary child.

"Holy—an innate artifact spirit!"

The girl yelped and hid completely while Lin Shan jumped at the outburst. The skeleton's eye sockets burned with undisguised greed as it lunged forward, bony fingers clutching his collar.

"You've been hiding an innate spirit treasure all this time!"

Lin Shan scrambled for an explanation. His enhancement panel was an absolute secret, soul contract or not. But since the spirit treasure couldn't be concealed forever...

"I only recently discovered the Void Star Disk was one," he lied.

"Show me! Now!" The demon lord vibrated with excitement, behaving like a starved addict. Lin Shan reluctantly produced the disk, admonishing, "Be careful! You couldn't afford to replace this if you tried."

The skeleton handled the treasure with trembling reverence, its bone fingers scraping across the surface in a way that made both Lin Shan and the artifact spirit cringe. After enduring this sacrilege as long as possible, they snatched it back.

"My original body possesses a spirit treasure," the demon lord admitted when pressed, "but it's an acquired one—far inferior to your innate treasure."

This piqued Lin Shan's interest. He hadn't realized spirit treasures had such classifications.

The demon lord explained that most spirit treasures were created by binding a recently deceased Nascent Soul's spirit to a magic treasure—a difficult and time-consuming process. Even after centuries, such acquired treasures' spirits remained dim-witted, only marginally enhancing the artifact's power.

Innate treasures, however, birthed their own spirits naturally—perfectly attuned to unleash the artifact's full potential. Their mature spirits could operate independently, even concealing themselves, as Little Xin had demonstrated.

"Yours is already highly intelligent," the demon lord said enviously. "If only it were an offensive-type innate treasure with this level of sentience..."

Lin Shan felt no regret—an auxiliary treasure suited his current needs perfectly. Offensive treasures required more cultivation than he currently possessed to wield effectively.

The pigtailed spirit perched on Lin Shan's shoulder, swinging her legs thoughtfully as she listened. The demon lord's covetous gaze never left her, and it eventually made a shameless offer:

"Name your price! My original body commands armies and treasures! I'll even trade my own spirit treasure and pledge this avatar's eternal service!"

But Lin Shan refused—he'd invested 64 points of ancient charm to create this treasure. The demon lord's avatar was bound to him anyway, destined to labor indefinitely.

As the discussion turned to the Illusion Spirit Tree's maintenance schedule, the demon lord produced a stack of messages accumulated over the decade. The sheer volume from the past six months alone shocked Lin Shan.

Messages from Protector Yan, Luan Chun, Old Man Zhong, and even his sworn brother Lin Fan all carried the same urgent news: The demonic sects' offensive had collapsed. The righteous alliance had rallied, reversing their previous losses.

Lin Fan's covert letter warned that the righteous factions had regained confidence and advised Lin Shan to flee his demonic affiliation immediately.

Standing dumbfounded, Lin Shan struggled to process this reversal. "A decade ago we were winning—half the territory seized, defenses shattered, the capital fallen... How did a guaranteed victory turn into defeat while I was in seclusion?"
