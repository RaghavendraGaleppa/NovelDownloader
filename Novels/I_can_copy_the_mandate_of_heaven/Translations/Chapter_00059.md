Chapter 59

For Li Zhiming, treating the injuries of the disciples wasn't a particularly challenging task, just a bit tiring. After a long day of working tirelessly in the grand hall, he was now being served a bowl of yellow rice porridge by Zhong Jun, slowly regaining his breath.

The aftermath of the treatment was taken care of by other members of the Xuanzi Gate, with some being sent to rest in the side hall and others being assigned to keep watch. It wasn't befitting for a young master like Li Zhiming to be bothered with such mundane tasks.

Tonight, Li Zhiming had single-handedly saved over a dozen lives, solidifying his reputation as a "little divine doctor." The doubts that had once surrounded him had now dissipated.

Zhong Jun's face was flushed as she gazed at Li Zhiming, who was struggling to even out his breathing while drinking his porridge. She couldn't help but think that he was incredibly handsome, with his red lips, white teeth, and thick, black eyebrows.

In the eyes of the nobility, being a doctor was considered a lowly profession. However, Li Zhiming's exceptional medical skills had earned him a revered status within the Xuanzi Gate.

As Zhong Jun watched Li Zhiming, she felt a sense of delight and her face grew even redder. She began to tug gently at her skirt, feeling that her fate had taken a turn for the better.

Li Zhiming, oblivious to Zhong Jun's admiration, finished his porridge and put down the bowl. "I'm tired, I'm going to bed," he said, yawning.

Zhong Jun was startled, "Y-yes, young master." She curtsied, "I-I'll go prepare a basin of hot water for you to soak your feet."

After a few days of rest, the Xuanzi Gate had returned to a state of tranquility. Li Zhiming would visit the injured disciples in the side hall daily, and their conditions were improving.

Upon seeing Li Zhiming enter, the injured disciples, including the burly martial artists, would smile warmly, their faces filled with gratitude and admiration for the young doctor.

Zhou Jin, the leader of the Xuanzi Hall, greeted Li Zhiming with a gentle expression, "Li young doctor, thank you again for your help. The brothers' injuries are mostly stable, but a few are still unconscious."

Li Zhiming examined the unconscious disciples and concluded that they would awaken within a couple of days.

As Li Zhiming observed the martial artists, he noticed that more than half of them had lowered their guard, allowing him to see their fate grids. Zhou Jin, the leader of the Xuanzi Hall, was among them.

Zhou Jin's fate grid read "Toxic Snake Sword Technique," and his guard was down, making it possible for Li Zhiming to copy it. Li Zhiming also saw other techniques, including " Misty Steps" and "Surrounding Sword," which were also available for copying.

Li Zhiming's discovery was significant, as it revealed the potential for him to acquire new skills and techniques from the martial artists.
