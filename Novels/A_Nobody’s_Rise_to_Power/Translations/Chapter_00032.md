Chapter 32: The Signs of Pregnancy

The gift of timely assistance is the most touching thing of all.

Of course, the fact that Yang Can stood up to the Suo family and consequently earned the favor of the Clan Master was also a crucial reason why he had won over Bao Zitou.

Bao Zitou didn't understand why this was the case, but he knew that his lack of understanding was simply because his mind wasn't sharp enough.

That was alright, though. He had no intention of using this rusty brain of his anymore in the future; from now on, he would let Young Master Yang do the thinking for him.

Bao Zitou's mind was indeed simple, but he had his own survival wisdom.

Yang Can visited Bao Zitou. After Cheng Dasao returned to her room holding her daughter, he comforted her some more and told her to seek him out if she ever ran into trouble before taking his leave.

Returning to his own residence, Yang Can found Zhang Yunyi, the Lord of Feng'an Manor, already waiting for him.

Yang Can didn't think much of this Zhang Yunyi.

In his mind, the man was nothing more than a wealthy rural landlord.

Zhang Yunyi's demeanor was exactly what Yang Can pictured a rural landlord to be: cunning and scheming, capable of lowering himself when necessary, but nothing more. He didn't seem to have much vision.

Zhang Yunyi presented Yang Can with a gift: a small box containing four gold ingots.

It wasn't a light gift, but it wasn't exceptionally valuable either. It left the impression that this landlord was quite wealthy and generous with his money.

Yang Can was the Steward in charge of the six major manors, making him Zhang Yunyi's direct superior. Naturally, he assumed this gift from Lord Zhang was the most valuable he would receive.

After some polite refusal, Yang Can accepted the generous gift and saw Lord Zhang off. With that, a period of leisurely and comfortable days began.

Inside the inner residence, Suo Chanzhi and her maid Qing Mei were making sweeping changes and adjustments, striving to gain complete control of the inner residence.

In the outer residence, the majority of the stewards were still from the "Ghostly Young Master Faction," whose leader was Chief Steward Li Youcai.

With Chief Steward Li around, Yang Can didn't even have the qualification to "follow the old rules." He simply went along with the flow.

As for the account books for the manors and pastures that Li Youcai had handed over to Yang Can, Yang Can had repeatedly approached Li Daxiao.

Each time, Li Daxiao would put him off with a long face, claiming he was busy handling the account books needed by the young mistress.

Yang Can wasn't in a hurry. After his daily "nagging" of Li Daxiao, he would take a walk around to show his presence, then retreat to his study to "read."

After just seven or eight days of "reading," Yang Can had sorted out the accounts for the six manors and three pastures from the last few years.

If it were about composing poetry, playing chess, or painting, Yang Can would indeed be inferior to the scholars of this era.

However, when it came to management and practical matters, once he was familiar with the basic rules, he was more than capable.

Those accounts were ledgers of flowing transactions, a method of bookkeeping that was originally the easiest to alter and falsify.

One could alter the dates by backdating or filling in entries after the fact, or cover up deficits by recording overdue transactions.

By adding false items or deliberately omitting certain ones, one could mislead others, thereby fabricating expenses, embezzling public funds, and intercepting differences.

However, even without Yang Can's impeccable method of tallying accounts, the ledgers were full of holes and easy to find problems with.

Because the accounts Yu Huanhu handed over were done in a great hurry, there was no time to tamper with them.

Of course, it was very likely that Yu Huanhu didn't even want to cover his tracks; he was practically hoping that the main branch would find the flaws in the accounts.

Once problems were found, would they manage them or not?

If they didn't, how would they deal with the deficits from previous years?

If they did, it was the season of spring plowing. By causing panic in the manors, they would lead to a sharp drop in the autumn harvest. How would they explain this to the entire clan?

This was an unsolvable dilemma that Yu Huanhu had thrown at the main branch.

However, Yang Can didn't seem to care. He marked all the problems he found on a statistical table, locked the table away in a cabinet, and continued his "daily nagging" of Accountant Li.

One morning, as usual, Yang Can took Wangcai to the small kitchen for breakfast.

As the personal servant of a Steward, Wangcai's food待遇 was much higher than that of an ordinary servant.

Every day, there was a bit of meat in his meals, though not much.

Therefore, Wangcai was very enthusiastic about mealtime. Every morning, when Yang Can got up to wash, Wangcai would already be waiting under the corridor, like a dog waiting for its meal.

As soon as he entered the dining hall, Yang Can felt that the atmosphere was a bit off. The stewards weren't chatting and laughing as usual; the hall was unusually quiet.

Li Youcai was also there today. When he saw Yang Can, he only managed a strained smile.

Yang Can was a bit puzzled. He sat down next to Li Youcai and whispered, "Chief Steward, what happened?"

Li Youcai also lowered his voice. "Early this morning, the Clan Master and Second Master Suo went to the inner residence."

Yang Can was slightly startled. "What happened in the inner residence?"

Li Youcai shook his head. "The Clan Master and Second Master Suo brought three famous physicians from Longxi."

Yang Can immediately understood. "They are here to take the young mistress's pulse?"

Li Youcai nodded and let out a long, worried sigh. "I hope the young mistress can live up to everyone's expectations."

Yang Can rubbed his nose. The fact that everyone was so concerned about whether Suo Chanzhi was pregnant put a lot of pressure on him. After all, he was the one who had plowed and sown the field.

To be honest, after learning about this, Yang Can lost his appetite.

The others had no heart to eat because they were worried about the future of the main branch, as the main branch's future directly influenced their own.

For Yang Can, however, this moment was even more critical. It determined whether he would have to walk on the edge of a knife from now on to fight for a prosperous future.

After breakfast, the stewards all headed, without prior agreement, toward the area connecting the outer and inner residences, where some buildings were located.

The architectural layout of a wealthy, influential family emphasized the distinction between the outer and inner domains.

Therefore, the part connecting the outer and inner residences wasn't just a high wall. Instead, buildings were constructed against the wall on both the inner and outer sides.

This design not only served to separate the front and back, maintaining good privacy, but also had the effect of gathering wind and energy in terms of Feng Shui.

Thus, on the side of the inner wall of the main branch's connecting area, flanking the ornamental gate, were the inner study and the women's kitchen courtyard.

On the outer wall side, there were the accounting office and the stewards' hall.

Today, Li Youcai, Accountant Li, and the other stewards of the outer residence had all gathered in this area, coincidentally without prior arrangement.

They each had their own excuses, going to different rooms to pretend to be busy, but their entire attention was fixed on the inner residence.

Later on, they stopped bothering to hide it. They gathered in small groups, sitting absentmindedly and drinking tea, just waiting for news to come out from the inner residence.

"Steward Niu, our Second Steward is really holding his composure. Everyone is here waiting for news, but he actually isn't here to listen," Accountant Li remarked to Steward Niu, noticing that Yang Can was the only one absent.

Steward Niu shook his head and stroked his beard. "Mr. Li, our Steward Yang is deeply disliked by the young mistress. If the young mistress isn't pregnant, our main branch will be disbanded sooner or later, and he'll have to find a new path. But if the young mistress is pregnant, heh! Then the young mistress will have full control. At that time, she'll still kick him out, and he'll have to find his own way again. What do you think he's doing here?"

Accountant Li was speechless for a moment, then he laughed. "That's true. Among all of us in the main branch, the one who cares the least about whether the young mistress is pregnant is probably Steward Yang."

Yang Can indeed did not go to the gate of the inner residence to wait for news. Firstly, everyone knew he was not favored by the Suo family, so it wasn't appropriate for him to be there waiting.

Secondly, he was more nervous than anyone else. The nervousness of possibly becoming a father, the nervousness of deciding the path he would have to walk from now on... This was the first time in his two lifetimes that he was facing such a significant change and decision.

Finally, unable to bear it any longer, Yang Can sent Wangcai away. He told Wangcai to wait outside the inner residence for any news.

He himself opened a book and sat in his study. He tried to calm himself down, but even though the doors and windows were wide open, he still felt a burning heat all over.

Inside the orchid room in the inner residence, a white-haired physician in his seventies was using the "Three Sections and Nine Pulse-taking" method, his two fingers resting steadily on Suo Chanzhi's fair wrist.

Four inner residence matrons, Qing Mei, and the clever maid Qiao She, along with the physician's assistant—his fifty-something daughter-in-law—were all standing by, watching intently.

Su Chanzhi was very nervous, her heart pounding like a startled deer, which made her pulse beat violently. She tried to steady her breathing, but the more she thought about it, the more rapid her breath became.

The physician naturally sensed Suo Chanzhi's nervousness, but to him, this was very normal. The very existence of the main branch and the young mistress's future all depended on this matter. How could she not be nervous?

Because of this, the physician became exceptionally cautious. Although he was already confident in his medical skills, he still took her pulse several more times.

Finally, the physician withdrew his fingers and said with a smile, "Congratulations, Young Mistress. You are with child."

As soon as these words were spoken, the maids and matrons in the room all showed expressions of joy.

The Clan Master and Second Master Suo had each invited a physician, bringing in a total of three renowned doctors from the northwestern region.

The one before them was the last of the three to make a diagnosis and also the most famous of the lot.

The first two physicians had already confirmed that the young mistress was pregnant. Now that this elderly physician had said the same, a great weight finally lifted from their hearts.

The physician stood up and bowed. "Young Mistress, I will go meet with my two colleagues and then report to the Clan Master together. I take my leave."

"Thank you, sir," Suo Chanzhi said, still feeling dazed.

For the past few days, she had been hoping day and night that she could conceive a child.

Now that her wish had finally come true, she didn't feel the sudden relief and joy she had expected. Instead, she felt even more nervous.

Gently placing her hand on her lower abdomen, Suo Chanzhi seemed to sense that a new life was taking root there...
