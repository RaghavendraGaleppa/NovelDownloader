# Chapter 32: Comprehending Dao Patterns, Forging the Dharma Seal  

The entire marketplace stood frozen, not a soul daring to move.  

After what felt like an eternity, the ceaseless thunderclaps finally faded away. The colossal shadow slowly receded, and sunlight once again bathed the world. Yet by then, the sun had dimmed, and it was impossible to tell how much time had passed.  

Gu Yuan lowered his head and touched himself, realizing the blood rain had vanished without a trace. However, the few spiritual herbs along Silvermoon Bay seemed to have thrived under its nourishment, growing even more luxuriant.  

"Whoosh! Whoosh!"  

The marketplace's occupants snapped out of their daze as if waking from a dream. Without a word, they hastily summoned their escape lights and returned to their respective caves.  

The fall of a True Dragon bore no direct connection to Qi Refinement disciples. Yet, this was undoubtedly the most earth-shattering event the cultivation world had witnessed in tens of thousands of years. The ripples it created would inevitably affect everyone.  

Gu Yuan had no idea how this event would impact him—whether for better or worse.  

"But no matter what, the most crucial thing now is to focus on growing stronger as quickly as possible."  

Taking a deep breath, Gu Yuan steadied his mind, then mounted his Cloud-Treading Shuttle and continued toward the Alchemy Cauldron Hall. He needed to obtain the Azure Turtle Shell to forge his Dharma Seal without delay.  

---  

The disciple guarding the Alchemy Cauldron Hall was also in a daze. Gu Yuan had to call out several times before the man snapped back to attention.  

Fortunately, procuring the Azure Turtle Shell went smoothly. The Dao Academy's vast resources meant they had reserves of nearly every treasure. Since Gu Yuan only needed fragments of the shell's patterns, he obtained them easily—though at the steep price of forty spirit stones.  

This made Gu Yuan sigh once more at the allure of wealth. Without the Stone Marrow and the favor of a Golden Core elder, he had no idea how an ordinary cultivator could ever stand out in the ruthless world of cultivation.  

Once he secured the materials, Gu Yuan wasted no time and immediately returned to his cave abode to begin preparations for forging the Dharma Seal.  

---  

Forging a Dharma Seal was not the hard part—the true challenge lay in comprehending the Dao Patterns.  

It was like building blocks: the materials remained the same, but the real skill lay in assembling them into the desired structure. Knowing his aptitude was far from exceptional, Gu Yuan resigned himself to a painstaking, step-by-step process of comprehension.  

Ten days passed in this manner.  

"Buzz..."  

On a translucent shadow tablet, Gu Yuan's spiritual sense flowed like water, meticulously weaving golden threads and jade strands in an attempt to outline the Dao Patterns. Yet, each time, the fusion of patterns lacked the final touch of harmony. At the critical juncture, the tablet would explode into dust.  

---  

The shadow tablet was an essential tool for forging Dharma Seals.  

When paired with golden threads and jade strands, it could simulate the formation of Dao Patterns. If the patterns were successfully inscribed and resonated with the natural order, the tablet would remain intact. If it shattered, it meant the patterns were incomplete or flawed.  

Nearly every cultivator used this method when forging Dharma Seals to ensure their comprehension of the patterns. After all, spiritual materials could only be used once. A single failure meant starting from scratch.  

Even a single shadow tablet for Qi Refinement cultivators cost one spirit stone. Repeated failures could quickly drain one's resources.  

At this moment, ten shattered shadow tablets lay scattered at Gu Yuan's feet. His heart bled at the sight, but he steeled himself and pressed on.  

Thankfully, the income from feeding the spirit fish every three days kept him afloat—otherwise, he would have long been in the red.  

---  

"Buzz..."  

Hair-thin golden strands danced under the guidance of his spiritual sense, twisting and turning in intricate patterns. For a fleeting moment, the shadow tablet shimmered with the illusion of wind, rain, and swirling mist.  

A peculiar resonance lingered in the air.  

"It's done!"  

"Finally, I've comprehended the Mistwalking Dharma Seal!"  

"Now, it's time to forge it."  

Gu Yuan exhaled deeply, a trace of joy flickering across his face. The Dao Patterns were intricate and elusive, like trying to discern flowers through fog. It had taken him thirteen days of relentless effort to grasp them fully.  

This experience gave him a clearer understanding of his own aptitude—he was no genius.  

Yet, it also deepened his yearning for those rare "Body Seals" or "Destiny Seals" that could alter one's innate talent.  

But for now, such thoughts were meaningless. He needed to focus on forging the Dharma Seal.  

"Clang!"  

With a flick of his finger, a jade-green turtle shell appeared in his palm. The shell bore the marks of countless years, its surface etched with emerald-green patterns that glowed faintly in the dim light of the chamber.  

These were the Dao Patterns.  

Though naturally formed, Dao Patterns did not inherently possess power—they had to be refined and fused.  

Gu Yuan had always wondered why humans lacked Dao Patterns while all other living things—plants, animals, even objects—bore them. But the scripture pavilion held no answers, so he had no choice but to set the question aside.  

"Mist Spirit Grass!"  

"Jade-Dispersing Flower!"  

With another wave of his hand, two more spiritual materials appeared in his palm. One was a grayish herb exuding faint mist, its veins resembling a yin-yang pattern. The other was a jade-like flower, its petals translucent and shimmering.  

After arranging the primary and auxiliary materials, Gu Yuan retrieved a small bronze cauldron. Inside, a silvery liquid shimmered, emitting an indescribable scent—not pungent, but intoxicating, like fine wine.  

---  

This was a crucial step in forging the Dharma Seal: "Pattern Extraction."  

The spiritual materials had to be immersed in specially prepared spirit liquid to extract their Dao Patterns before the seal could be formed.  

"Gurgle…"  

Following the proper sequence, Gu Yuan placed the Azure Turtle Shell, Mist Spirit Grass, and Jade-Dispersing Flower into the liquid.  

This step lacked any semblance of elegance or mystique—it reminded Gu Yuan of his past life's laboratory experiments.  

But when the silver liquid brightened and began peeling the Dao Patterns from the materials, everything changed.  

"Whoosh!"  

"Rustle…"  

An inexplicable force stirred the spiritual energy. Rain materialized out of thin air, mist coiled, and faint thunder rumbled in the distance.  

A profound Dao resonance emerged.  

Gu Yuan felt as though the most fundamental forces of heaven and earth were beckoning to him. But he paid them no heed—this was a common phenomenon during Dharma Seal formation. Dao Patterns were, after all, fragments of the natural order.  

His spiritual sense surged forth, coiling around the three Dao Patterns like an agile dragon.  

Extracted Dao Patterns could only linger for a brief moment. Missing this window meant they would dissipate into the void.  

Thankfully, Gu Yuan had already mastered their comprehension, and his spiritual sense was exceptionally strong. In mere moments, he fused the three patterns into one.  

A peculiar, Dao-infused seal script hovered in the air.  

"Now!"  

But the process wasn't over yet. Steeling his will, Gu Yuan channeled his mana like a surging tide.  

At the Qi Refinement stage, mana was normally as diffuse as mist. But under Gu Yuan's forceful compression, it thickened into a semi-solid state.  

"Clang!"  

The condensed mana collided with the seal script.  

A golden chime seemed to reverberate through the void as an extraordinary resonance rippled outward.  

"Success!"  

Gu Yuan couldn't help but laugh aloud.  

Floating in the air was a palm-sized jade seal, its surface adorned with wind, rain, and mist motifs, while Dao Patterns shimmered beneath it.  

"Whoosh…"  

With a thought, heavy rain suddenly poured within the chamber, and thick mist swirled, obscuring everything like a sudden storm.
