## Chapter 202: Obtaining the River of Time Gold Crystal

A line of small text appeared before his eyes.

[Zhang Jing (Named Disciple of Crimson Heaven Grand Clear Grotto-Heaven): 4.02575 billion Qi Luck]

Seeing the suddenly reduced Qi Luck, Zhang Jing felt a momentary daze, a faint ache in his heart.

In the blink of an eye, a billion — equivalent to the entire Qi Luck reward painstakingly obtained by a top 100 genius in the Pridesky Secret Realm — was gone just like that.

It was truly spent too quickly.

Moreover… Zhang Jing realized after a moment's thought that the Qi Luck spent on acquiring a divine ability was merely a small fraction compared to the consumption required to level up skills and evolve them into Immortal Seeds by "grinding experience."

As for not buying River of Time Gold Sand or River of Time Gold Crystals to grind experience, and instead relying on slow, arduous self-cultivation to level up – this idea was immediately rejected by Zhang Jing the moment it surfaced.

The reason was simple: time!

Perhaps in the future, when his cultivation reached the realm of a Grotto-Heaven True Immortal like his master, he might be able to spend tens or even hundreds of thousands of years delving into and studying a divine ability, slowly accumulating experience to upgrade it.

But… definitely not now!

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing's gaze fell upon the jade slip in his hand.

His fingertips gently caressed it.

The jade slip was pure white and warm to the touch, imbued with a faint immortal glow, appearing quite extraordinary.

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn't even damage it in the slightest, a testament to its terrifying durability.

"As expected of a legacy worth a billion, its specifications are completely different from the previous Dao Intent legacies," Zhang Jing thought to himself.

For a moment, the item in his hand felt as heavy as a myriad jin.

Then, he took a deep breath and solemnly put the jade slip away.

"This is a good opportunity to investigate how the various divine ability and immortal art legacies recorded in the Dao Repository Realm are classified," Zhang Jing's eyes flashed.

The next moment, the chaotic-colored Dao Seal reappeared between his brows, and his mind reconnected with the vast consciousness within the Dao Repository Realm.

Instantly, three large stars slowly descended.

…

Two hours later.

"All cultivation methods are categorized as Minor Divine Abilities, Major Divine Abilities, Supreme Divine Abilities, and even Grand Dao Divine Abilities… Based on their type, power, the Dao principles and Dao intents they contain, and various other factors, the human race broadly divides all legacies into nine grades. Grade One is the highest, and Grade Nine is the lowest."

"Beyond these are various unrated legacies."

A sharp glint flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

It matches! There truly is a classification similar to nine grades. As for those unrated legacies, he estimated that they corresponded to the Dharma Seeds within him.

Although these unrated methods varied in strength, the human race in all major Heavenly Realms uniformly classified them as unranked.

Even the high-grade cultivation method he had desperately acquired in the lower realm was no exception.

In contrast, "rated" meant Immortal Seeds!

"The lower three grades, namely Minor Divine Abilities, account for ninety-nine percent of all human legacies."

"Based on their strength, their value ranges from hundreds of millions to tens of billions of Qi Luck. Generally speaking, those under a billion are Grade Nine, those from one billion to three billion are Grade Eight, and those from three billion to ten billion are Grade Seven."

Zhang Jing's understanding gradually became clear.

Of course, he also understood that this was just a broad classification method for legacy grades, and it didn't mean that a higher grade necessarily implied a higher value.

For instance, cultivation and enlightenment-type divine ability legacies could not be simply compared with offensive-type divine ability legacies.

And within the Dao Repository Realm, the types of divine abilities were myriad!

"It still depends on the specific price!" Zhang Jing thought with certainty.

However—

A strange look suddenly appeared on his face.

Looking at it this way… the most valuable thing he possessed might well be the Grand Ascension Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade he had just received from Teacher Seven Desires Divine Monarch.

At the very least, it should be a Mid-Grade Major Divine Ability.

As for the Upper Three Grades — according to Zhang Jing's current understanding, it might not reach that level.

"Too bad I can't sell it!"

Zhang Jing shook his head.

And at this point, he finally understood why the Path of Origin World Creation in the Grand Beginning Primeval Realm was so highly revered.

After all, the Innate Primordial Immortal Light was a genuine Major Divine Ability!

And this was a divine ability that cultivators of the Path of Origin World Creation could spontaneously condense upon first entering the Core Formation realm.

Not to mention the cultivation methods for nine other Major Divine Abilities.

Coming back to his senses, as if remembering something, Zhang Jing's heart stirred.

In an instant, a somewhat illusory figure slowly appeared beside him.

"This old man greets Your Excellency. May I ask if Your Excellency has any questions that require my assistance?" the suddenly appearing elder asked with a smile.

"Why aren't there any Mid-Grade or even Upper-Grade legacies in this Dao Repository Realm? Are they not located here?" Zhang Jing asked bluntly.

After learning that the various legacies were divided into nine grades and ten ranks, he was surprised to find that he couldn't locate even a single Mid-Grade legacy.

And Upper-Grade legacies were even more out of the question.

Opposite him, the elder replied, "Reporting to Your Excellency, all Mid-Grade legacies are on the upper level. With your current authority, you cannot ascend there on your own."

Pausing, the elder continued, "If Your Excellency wishes to enter the upper level of the Dao Repository Realm, you must apply to the Dao Sect in advance. Does Your Excellency have any other questions?"

"No more, thank you for clarifying," Zhang Jing said with a smile.

"Your Excellency is too kind; it is this old man's duty," the elder smiled faintly, and his figure slowly faded away.

On the spot, the expression on Zhang Jing's face returned to normal.

"Insufficient authority, huh? True Disciples shouldn't have this restriction, right?" He recalled what Senior Brother Feng Wuyu had explained about True Disciples and speculated.

The next moment, his figure slowly disappeared from the Dao Repository Realm.

…

Inside the cultivation chamber at the center of the Grotto-Heaven Immortal Island.

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on the futon, his eyes half-closed.

Before him, the jade slip containing the Twenty-Four Heavens divine ability legacy, purchased from the Dao Repository Realm, floated impressively.

At this moment, it was as if an invisible tether linked Zhang Jing and the jade slip, their auras perfectly integrated.

Inhale—Exhale—

Gradually, a subtle and profound essence of void creation and spatial generation slowly permeated the entire cultivation chamber.

After an unknown period.

In the very center of his Niwan Palace, the mysterious jade talisman vibrated slightly once more.

[Twenty-Four Heavens · Not Yet Mastered (0/9999)]

Zhang Jing suddenly opened his eyes, a flicker of enlightenment in his gaze.

The so-called Twenty-Four Heavens involved opening twenty-four layers of void heavens outside the body, drawing in immeasurable heaven and earth primeval qi, and various spiritual lights to augment oneself.

It could be used for cultivation as well as for offense.

It was extraordinarily divine and endlessly versatile.

Just by looking at its exchange price, it was clear that this divine ability was a top-tier Grade Nine legacy, just half a step away from reaching Grade Eight.

His gaze shifted.

"Cultivating to mastery only requires less than ten thousand experience points? That's not too bad," Zhang Jing thought to himself.

While this experience requirement was still high, compared to the Grand Ascension Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade, it seemed much more normal.

After all, it was a ranked Immortal Dao divine ability legacy; difficulty in upgrading was to be expected.

He kept comforting himself.

Then, as if remembering something, Zhang Jing extended his hand, and a VIP Gold Talisman from the Myriad Heavens Auction House instantly appeared on it.

Since the legacy was already in hand, it was time to consider grinding experience points.

With a thought, five auction listings for River of Time Gold Crystals immediately appeared before him.

…

River of Time Gold Crystal (6 liang)
Note: A wondrous treasure crystal from the secret realm [River of Time], containing vast amounts of temporal power, usable for cultivating divine abilities or comprehending the Dao of Time.
Current Bid: 90.3 million Qi Luck
Buyout Price: 200 million Qi Luck
Time Remaining: 7 days

…

River of Time Gold Crystal (1 jin, 9 liang, 7 qian)
Note: …
Current Bid: 330 million Qi Luck
Buyout Price: 600 million Qi Luck
Time Remaining: 10 years and 9 months

…

His gaze swept across the only five available River of Time Gold Crystal auction listings one by one.

Zhang Jing's expression suddenly turned serious.

The last time he checked the auction information for River of Time Gold Crystals, he found only a handful of sellers.

Now, looking again, there were still only a few scattered River of Time Gold Crystals.

Compared to River of Time Gold Sand, it was a complete opposite.

What this implied was obvious.

Either River of Time Gold Crystals were extremely difficult to obtain, or they were exceedingly precious, so much so that even their owners found them insufficient for their own use.

It was more likely a combination of both.

But no matter the situation, it constantly reminded Zhang Jing that he must seize every auction opportunity.

…

Time passed bit by bit.

Zhang Jing's gaze finally settled on the six-liang River of Time Gold Crystal.

Firstly, its auction was about to end.

Secondly, it was the cheapest, perfect for a trial purchase.

If the River of Time Gold Crystal's effect on skill experience gain wasn't ideal, he would have to find another method.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing's gaze deepened as he looked at the steadily climbing price of the River of Time Gold Crystal.

…

Time flowed silently.

On this day, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes from the futon, letting out a sigh.

The six terrifying Dao intents, including the Universe Devouring Bashe and the Fiery Desolation Vermillion Bird, wrapped around him, began to dissipate and recede little by little.

Inside his Niwan Palace, the mysterious jade talisman flickered erratically.

[Twenty-Four Heavens · Not Yet Mastered (517/9999)]

Unconsciously, seven days had passed.

During these seven days, Zhang Jing had been monitoring the auction of the River of Time Gold Crystal but had not placed a bid; on the other hand, he had been attempting to cultivate the newly acquired Twenty-Four Heavens divine ability.

As for his progress, it was entirely within expectations.

After all, whether or not he activated the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud Immortal Seed made a world of difference to his cultivation speed.

The only pity was that with his current cultivation, it was truly difficult to maintain the Dao Origin Auspicious Cloud for long periods.

"Accumulating roughly seventy experience points a day is already quite good, considering it's a ranked divine ability," Zhang Jing thought to himself.

At this rate, he would only need less than half a year to master the Twenty-Four Heavens.

From what he understood, such a cultivation speed would be astonishing for anyone.

However… it wasn't enough, far from enough!

Zhang Jing's eyes narrowed slightly.

This wouldn't allow him to quickly upgrade the Twenty-Four Heavens skill to an Immortal Seed.

Therefore—

He lowered his head and looked at the VIP Gold Talisman of the Myriad Realms Auction House in his hand.

River of Time Gold Crystal (6 liang)
Note: …
Current Bid: 110.2 million Qi Luck
Buyout Price: 200 million Qi Luck
Time Remaining: one hour

…

"Still have to grind for experience, huh!" A helpless smile flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

As the auction deadline approached, the price began to flash madly.

Clearly, many people thought like Zhang Jing and understood that earlier bidding was pointless, so they all made their moves at this moment.

As for the buyout price, no one wanted to be a fool.

Tap! Tap!

Zhang Jing's fingertips tapped against his knee, his gaze fixed on the wildly changing bid price, his expression utterly calm.

He knew that now was still not the time to bid.

Time passed by slowly.

With only a dozen breaths remaining until the end, the bid price had stopped fluctuating.

"Now!"

The tapping sound echoing in the cultivation chamber suddenly ceased.

Without any hesitation.

"125 million!"

After stating the price, Zhang Jing stared unblinkingly at the auction.

One breath, two breaths, three breaths…

At the final crucial moment of bidding, it paradoxically died down, becoming utterly peaceful.

Finally, a familiar vortex appeared before him.

Immediately afterward, a grey immortal crystal, about the size of a fingernail, slowly flew out, carrying an extremely rich aura of time.

Whoosh—

Zhang Jing's gaze unconsciously fell upon the grey immortal crystal, and in that instant, a majestic long river seemed to appear before his eyes, stretching through endless chaotic void worlds.

"Is this the River of Time Gold Crystal?"
