# Chapter 27: The Lake's Secret and the Stone Book

"Swish—"

Ripples spread across the water's surface as countless silver fish gathered in a frenzy, fighting over what appeared to be food. Yet the leading fish suddenly flicked its tail upon sensing the common fish bait's odor and swam away disdainfully. 

What a joke—without the prized "Water Deer Grass," this lord won't eat!

The other fish soon caught the scent and scattered in disappointment. 

Just then, a wisp of white mist drifted from the shore into the water, dispersing like ink and enveloping the school of fish. 

A strange power rippled through the water, and the silver fish suddenly swam back as if intoxicated. In their eyes, the ordinary bait had transformed into the fragrant, delectable Water Deer Grass they craved. 

"Swish—"

Excited, the fish swarmed forward, devouring the bait ravenously. 

"Moo—"

But from the depths came a sound like a bull's bellow. A massive silver fish, three feet long with armor-like scales and small horn-like protrusions on its head, surfaced. Its eyes burned with intelligence as it glared furiously at the bait floating in the water. 

Feeding my kin this filth? 

You little thief!

The Silverfish King's eyes blazed with anger. With a flick of its mouth, it shattered the illusion cast by the mirage mist. 

This Silverfish King was no ordinary creature—its power surpassed that of most Qi Refining cultivators. 

Yet from the lake's surface came only a light chuckle: 

"I was waiting for you!"

"Boom!"

Three massive clouds of mirage mist descended like white dragons, coiling around the Silverfish King in an instant. Sensing danger, the king thrashed violently, trying to escape. But the spiritual energy controlling the mist was overwhelming. In moments, the Silverfish King succumbed to the illusion. 

This isn't filth—it's Water Deer Grass!

Without further prompting, the Silverfish King began gulping down the ordinary bait with gusto. 

"The wonders of Golden Core techniques are truly extraordinary," Gu Yuan murmured as he watched from above. 

The Silverfish King's intelligence and strength made it a formidable opponent underwater. Yet with the Golden Core seal in hand, Gu Yuan could make it feast on mere scraps without effort. 

This only heightened his anticipation for the lake's hidden opportunity. 

"Let's hope this yields something worthwhile," he mused, though the faint cyan glow in his vision left him uncertain. 

Still, this was merely an attempt—failure wouldn't be the end. 

After scanning the surroundings with his spiritual sense to ensure no observers, Gu Yuan dove into the lake. 

---

This was his second time feeding the silver fish. During the first attempt, Senior Brother Ding had supervised, but after seeing Gu Yuan's mastery of the technique, he no longer bothered. 

Senior Brother Ding was at a critical juncture in his cultivation and couldn't afford distractions—hence delegating the task to Gu Yuan in the first place. 

This worked in Gu Yuan's favor. 

"Swish—"

Though he hadn't learned any water-repelling techniques, Gu Yuan's mana surged around him like an invisible barrier, parting the water effortlessly. 

While a cultivator's mana couldn't interact with the natural world without seals, it was still a formidable force. A fifth-level Qi Refining cultivator could lift thousands of pounds with pure mana, tear apart tigers and leopards barehanded, or shatter stone tablets. 

Here, Gu Yuan's mana barrier easily withstood the lake's modest depth. 

"The stone liquid's guidance points here," he thought. 

The stone liquid was mysterious—though it only displayed as glowing dots, Gu Yuan could intuitively grasp the exact location of opportunities. Unless they were in forbidden or dangerous areas, he could find them with ease. 

After swimming for about twenty breaths, Gu Yuan reached the lake's center. 

Lush aquatic plants swayed as silver fish and other exotic species darted about. Occasionally, a large green shrimp would emerge from the lakebed, stirring up mud and ripples. 

The fish showed no fear, bumping into Gu Yuan's mana barrier with dull thuds. 

Pushing aside the vegetation, Gu Yuan discovered a small mound on the lakebed. Amidst the silt lay fragments of shattered jade artifacts. 

"Whoosh!"

Gu Yuan unleashed his spiritual sense and mana, churning the water like a dragon's fury. In moments, the mound was swept aside, revealing its contents—a shattered skeleton. 

The bones glowed faintly, indicating they had been tempered by mana—this had been a cultivator. 

Yet every bone was broken, as if struck by a devastating force, with ribs shattered into fragments. 

Beside the skeleton lay a book seemingly carved from bluish stone. 

Its pages bore bold, angular characters—as if etched by someone's fingers. 

Gu Yuan scanned the area thoroughly with his spiritual sense, confirming no other items, before using a mana-formed hand to retrieve the stone book. 

"Is this the opportunity the stone liquid hinted at?" 

With nothing else of note in the lake, and maintaining the mana barrier taxing his energy, Gu Yuan resurfaced without delay. 

The setting sun cast golden hues across the sky as he emerged. After ensuring no one was nearby, he examined the stone book. 

The book was indeed made of stone—heavy and dense. Without mana, Gu Yuan doubted he could lift it with sheer physical strength. 

On its pages, bold characters proclaimed: 

"Ten Great Renowned Physiques!" 

"Throughout the world, countless extraordinary physiques have emerged—each with unparalleled talent and renown. From the Sun-Melting Gold to the Yin-Yang Chaos, these are the darlings of heaven, known to all." 

"Yet few realize that beyond these Dao Physiques exist Ten Great Renowned Physiques—equally terrifying in potential, no less formidable than the heavenly Dao Physiques. However, these Renowned Physiques are exclusive to female cultivators and come with fatal flaws. Once discovered, they invite calamity!" 

"In my travels across the four domains, scouring ancient texts, I have compiled records of these Ten Great Renowned Physiques herein." 

"Vermilion Beauty and Jade Bones—this physique is innately ruthless. Its bearer cultivates a Skeleton Dharma Form, possessing supreme talent. Mass slaughter accelerates cultivation exponentially." 

"Yet this physique forbids loss of virginity. Once deflowered, the bones turn to mere beauty, talent dissipating like water, leaving the bearer a mere花瓶 (ornamental vase), incapable of further progress." 

"Jade Skin and Ice Bones—this woman's complexion surpasses all, as if an immortal descended. Any Yin-based cultivation techniques progress at staggering speeds, reaching pinnacle realms." 

"But this physique's flaw lies in its jade-like skin—any blemish, even a minor cut, shatters the innate Dao patterns, destroying the talent instantly." 

To Gu Yuan's surprise, the stone book didn't contain the expected "methods to seek a master" or cultivation techniques. Instead, it detailed these unheard-of physiques—Renowned Physiques, not Dao Physiques. 

He couldn't fathom their connection to the opportunity he sought. Yet the records were utterly novel, broadening his horizons as he read on. 

Upon turning to the third page, one entry caught his attention: 

"Thousand Charms and Hundred Graces!" 

"This physique only manifests in descendants of fox and human unions. Bearers are devastatingly beautiful, with enchanting pink eyes that captivate all who meet their gaze."
