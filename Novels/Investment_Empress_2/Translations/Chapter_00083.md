# Chapter 83: The Frozen Heart in Utter Chaos, Punishment Begins Tomorrow (1/2)

The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are vast, with all kinds of wonders.

But this is merely the ranking of the Eastern Wilderness Region.

It does not include the Great Yu Dynasty, nor those transcendent sects; it is but a single corner of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

In that instant, Ying Bing’s mind went blank.

But the system did not stop because of her confusion and bewilderment.

**[Eastern Wilderness Region Genius Ranking, First Place: Li Mo.]**

The remaining words appeared silently.

Li... Mo?

These two characters were reflected in Ying Bing’s eyes, stirring up a storm of waves.

Unconsciously, images surfaced in her mind: the boy’s spring-like expression, his figure bustling about in the kitchen, his words of trust spoken at Qingyuan...

How could it be him?

How could it be him?

Indeed, Li Mo had changed much from what she once knew.

His personality had improved, making him pleasant to be around; his talent had increased, giving him the资格 to discuss the Dao of the Sword with her; he had even obtained some kind of inheritance.

But.

He had clearly just lost to her today!

On the擂台 (dueling stage), Ying Bing hadn't been completely serious; she mostly wanted to see just how strong he had become.

The result was indeed surprising.

But Li Mo’s strength was clearly still a great distance away from hers.

Furthermore, since the two had entered the Qingyuan Sect, they had been together day and night.

Right under her very nose, she hadn't seen him have any other miraculous encounters.

In the same realm, there might exist beings capable of matching her, but those are all famous, notable figures.

Why?

Why is it him?

At this moment, the image of that youth was shrouded in a thick layer of mystery.

The air seemed to freeze.

Ying Bing’s feelings were strange.

Shock, confusion, suspicion, unwillingness...

To be suppressed by someone else—so this is what it feels like?

**[Comparison has ended, rewards are being distributed.]**

**[Host ranks second in the ranking.]**

**[Reward 1: Three bottles of Emperor’s Fluid Slurry.]**

**[Reward 2: One True Phoenix Feather.]**

**[Reward 3: One Cold Marrow Jade Bed.]**

The system’s rewards were all extremely rare treasures, and they happened to be perfectly suited for her use; they were undeniably precious.

For example, the Emperor’s Fluid Slurry.

This is the essence of heaven and earth, born from the heavens, scattering upon touching the ground. Vegetation touched by it turns into spirits, beasts consume it to gain intelligence, and humans take it to cleanse their entire body, allowing their martial dao to advance a thousand li in a single day.

Once every sixty years, Emperor’s Fluid Slurry falls in certain places within the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

As for the specific locations, only the Yantian Sect knows.

Therefore, aside from the Yantian Sect, very few people possess this item.

Then there is the True Phoenix Feather.

True Phoenixes, True Dragons—these former rulers of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are still extremely rare today, and whenever they appear, they inevitably carry a great destiny.

There is a silent, self-regulating rule in the world.

Neither Phoenixes nor True Dragons are allowed to exist in the world simultaneously in numbers exceeding nine.

Of course, many times, the combined total of these auspicious beasts does not even reach a handful.

A Phoenix’s feather is its intrinsic object; after integrating it into one's body, one can possess many miraculous properties, similar to a True Dragon’s inverse scale.

Compared to True Dragons, the Phoenix clan is even rarer and has long been extinct in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

As for the final Cold Marrow Jade Bed, she had possessed one in her previous life in the桂宫 (Guigong).

Lying on it doubled the effectiveness of one’s cultivation.

Undoubtedly.

Even for her in her previous life, these rewards were not common items.

But...

**[Detected that the host has activated the Loser’s Punishment.]**

**[The system will temporarily hold all rewards, waiting for the host to complete the punishment conditions before distributing them.]**

**[If the challenge fails, the system will automatically unbind, and all rewards will be destroyed.]**

**[Current Punishment Condition: Share a bed for one month with the person who has surpassed you.]**

**[The challenge begins tomorrow.]**

Complex emotions churned in her heart.

Ying Bing stared blankly at the rewards and the punishment condition.

When she chose to increase the rewards and activate the challenge, she never imagined that she would actually face a day of punishment.

Because of her intense emotional fluctuations, the suppressed Taiyin power within her body momentarily lost control.

The room grew even colder.

Cold enough to stop a person’s thoughts and freeze their mind.

---

Her eyelashes, dusted with ice crystals, fluttered lightly before finally closing heavily.

Ying Bing’s consciousness sank into darkness, falling into a dream.

......

In the dream.

Above the vast, wild sea, no sun, moon, or stars could be seen.

Only thunder danced wildly, dyeing the world in only black and white.

Waves towering to the heavens churned, forming an endless vortex that swallowed everything without a trace.

Hazy, Ying Bing remembered she had been here before.

The Ruins of Return.

In her previous life, she had searched several times for the last place in the world hiding the opportunity to become an immortal. It was also the place where many legendary figures, including the Taizu Wu Emperor of the Yu Dynasty, disappeared in the end.

**[Those who desire to become immortals, enter here to undergo tribulation.]**

This was the only thing on the surface of the sea.

A huge stone tablet towering into the clouds.

She had been here.

And she had come with the other eight of the Nine Heavens.

They had joined forces to kill the guardian of the Ruins of Return and entered the Path to Immortality within the Ruins together.

But.

She had failed.

At this moment, Ying Bing finally remembered the reason for her failure in the tribulation.

“A flaw in the heart.”

.........

Morning.

Sitting on the already frozen meditation mat, Li Mo slowly exhaled, the corners of his mouth unconsciously curving upwards.

He was sinking his mind into his Dantian.

Within his Dantian, the originally hair-thin internal energy had grown tenfold; if he dispersed it, it would fill the entire Dantian.

With a thought, the internal energy gathered and dispersed according to his will, occasionally taking on various shapes.

Li Mo pushed the door open and walked out to the frozen lake surface, punching down.

The pervasive internal energy钻入 (drilled into) the thick layer of ice.

A moment later, he lightly tossed a stone onto the ice layer.

*Crackle, crackle—*

The frozen stream instantly fell apart and began flowing again.

“Not bad.”

Li Mo was quite satisfied.

If it were before, doing this would have probably required some effort, right?

“The Frozen Heart hasn’t gotten up yet?”

Li Mo疑惑地 (puzzledly) glanced at the room upstairs.

Normally, Ying Bing would definitely be drinking tea at the stone table at this time.

But after seeing the state of the Autumn Water Pavilion, he understood.

After such a big commotion last night, she might need some time to rest.

“Eh?”

Shang Wu walked out,眯缝着杏眼 (squinting her almond eyes), scratching her flawless, snowy white shoulder, looking dazed.

Seeing the scene in the courtyard, she looked confused.

“It’s the Frozen Heart.”

Li Mo said casually.

“Oh, oh.”

Shang Wu nodded lazily, stomping her foot on the ground.

A furnace-like heat swept through.

The Master-as-a-little-sun effect was excellent.

She then looked at her precious disciple.

“Uh? Master, is there something?”

Li Mo was不解 (uncomprehending).

“Ahem! From today onwards, I will begin seriously teaching you.”

Yesterday, the elders had held a criticism meeting for her. Several elders were highly agitated, accusing her of being unworthy of being a teacher.

Shang Wu thought about it and realized it was true.

She had been letting her disciple run wild for almost a month.

As a master, she really should teach her disciple something. If she had taught Li Mo earlier, perhaps her precious disciple wouldn't have lost to Ying Bing.

And consequently, she wouldn't have lost so much money.

So, starting today, she decided to earnestly instruct her precious disciple, letting him enter the Internal Energy realm as soon as possible.

For this sake, she had even特意 (特意) gone to the library to review the classics on how to break through the Vital Energy Realm. After all, she had broken through after a single drink of alcohol; she couldn't let her precious disciple learn from her.

Shang Wu was rarely this serious.

“Today, I will teach you how to condense Internal Energy.”

“But Master, I’m already in the Internal Energy Realm.”

“You damn...”

“??”
