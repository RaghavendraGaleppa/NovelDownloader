# Chapter 179: A Glimmer of Hope

No matter how Lin Shan tried to explain, Elder Pei shook his head resolutely like a rattle-drum, refusing to make any vow of conviction. 

Not only had the boy stirred up immense trouble—enough that no one could withstand the wrath of the Qianyun Pavilion—but more importantly, Elder Pei simply didn't dare harbor such a walking calamity! 

Causing chaos everywhere was one thing, but acting completely unfazed afterward? Just how thick-skinned was this kid? 

Unbelievable. Absolutely unbelievable.

Lin Shan, with a pained expression, argued: First, he had never actively provoked anyone. 

Everything had been forced upon him—he had no choice. 

Second, many of the consequences were merely chain reactions he couldn’t have foreseen. He truly hadn’t intended to deceive Elder Pei.

Though Elder Pei was usually easygoing—perhaps owing to his current dependent circumstances—he still sighed helplessly: 

"You're beyond saving, boy. There's no washing your hands clean in this lifetime. Since you're already drowning in debts, why not just embrace the demonic path and walk it to the bitter end?"

Tears welled in Lin Shan's eyes as he clasped his hands in supplication. "Elder, save me!"

Elder Pei's expression softened with pity. He patted Lin Shan's shoulder with a gnarled hand. "Child, in your next life, remember to choose a better fate. You're truly beyond redemption."

Just then, Instructor Wu happened to pass by. Spotting the two slacking off, he bellowed, "What are you doing?!"

Both Lin Shan and Elder Pei jumped in fright, quickly assuming proper stances—one teaching earnestly, the other learning diligently, their performance convincing enough to fool the instructor.

Instructor Wu watched for a moment before nodding in approval and moving on to inspect the next group.

Despite Elder Pei’s reluctance, Lin Shan didn’t slack in his duties. He continued teaching martial arts with dedication, while Elder Pei studied just as earnestly, as if their earlier conversation had never happened.

By noon, the sun blazed overhead. 

The group trained until they were drenched in sweat, dizzy and barely able to stand. 

Finally, as the clock struck the hour, the crimson-robed "Instructor Wu" shuddered, his demeanor shifting entirely.

"*Diligence is the path to the mountain of knowledge; hardship is the boat to the endless sea of learning.* If you don’t study hard now, how will you ever secure titles for your wives and children, or rise to become ministers and kings in the future?!"

"???"

"???"

"???"

Everyone stared in bewilderment. The familiar, aged voice triggered memories—this was one of the three most frequently heard voices during the past two days and nights. One belonged to "Instructor Wu," and this one was unmistakably...

Master Cen.

A scholar from a private academy.

This man loved to ramble, his droning worse than a monk’s chanting. He was notorious for lengthy moral lectures, unbearable in their tedium.

---

The demonic cultivators collectively groaned. *This is it.* With "Instructor Wu" gone, they had hoped for some protection if orthodox reinforcements arrived. But now, with this frail old scholar in charge, wouldn’t they be sitting ducks?

The orthodox cultivators, however, smirked. *Lectures? Fine by us. The longer we stall, the better. Sooner or later, our allies will arrive.*

The newly emerged "Master Cen" paid no heed. He ordered everyone to sit cross-legged on the spot and began his lesson.

Pulling out an ancient tome from who-knows-where, he started reciting verbatim.

"*The demonic black sky, death rests like night; Rahu descends, heaven and earth collapse; gathering miasma and filth, blood sacrifice begets calamity...*"

"*Pah!* What heresy!"

This seemed to be a demonic scripture, originally stored in the Protector Demon King’s spatial pouch, mistakenly retrieved by Master Cen as teaching material.

Flustered, Master Cen hastily flipped through another pouch and produced a different book, reciting with a scholarly air.

"*Jade dew returns to elixir, golden liquid at the crown; pearls descend to the Yellow Court, spirit settles in stillness; the primordial spirit gazes silently, breath continuous and soft...* Huh? What nonsense is this?"

This appeared to be a Daoist scripture on breaking through the Golden Core bottleneck, originally belonging to Thunder Silver from the Violet Heaven Sect’s true inheritance. Another mistaken choice.

Now thoroughly panicked—clearly not well-read beyond basic texts—Master Cen rummaged desperately before finally producing another book.

This one was gilded, ancient, and exuded scholarly refinement. The cover bore four bold characters: *The Rites of Duke Zhou*—a classic of Confucian propriety.

Master Cen sighed in relief. At last, a proper text to educate these "students"!

"*The union of yin and yang, the supreme principle of heaven and earth; the male’s primal yang, blazing like fire; the female’s primal yin, cool and yielding as water. When the two merge in harmony, it embodies the great joy of creation and enlightenment...* *Ahem!*"

"*What vile drivel!*"

Master Cen erupted in fury, leaping three feet in the air and hurling the book to the ground. The title *The Rites of Duke Zhou* now seemed to burn his eyes.

"*Obscene words! Vulgar sounds! Disgraceful!*"

The "students" below, witnessing the scholar’s outrage, hastily voiced agreement—though their eyes kept darting toward the discarded "Great Joy Art," curiosity gnawing at them.

"*Wonder whose collection this was—the Protector Demon King’s or Thunder Silver’s? If it’s the latter... tsk tsk...*"

---

Gossip swirled as they speculated about the deceased owners’ histories.

Meanwhile, Master Cen found himself in a dilemma, his mind in turmoil.

In life, this pedantic scholar had been a village tutor with limited erudition, barely capable of teaching children basic literacy. Expounding profound philosophies of statecraft was beyond him.

Now, with hundreds of eyes fixed on him, his mind blanked. The classics eluded him, and humiliation loomed.

Just then, as if by fate, another group of cultivators passed Mount Yimeng.

The orthodox cultivators rejoiced—*reinforcements at last! We’re saved!*

But their joy was short-lived.

The newcomers weren’t allies but fleeing demonic cultivators, led by a gloomy middle-aged man—another Golden Core elder.

This demonic elder, surveying the scene, was struck by sheer absurdity.

Hundreds of orthodox and demonic cultivators gathered together... attending a lecture?

And the lecturer was just a crimson-robed youth?

Wait...

He looked familiar.

After a closer look, the demonic elder recognized him—despite the changed demeanor, this was his old battlefield rival, the Violet Heaven Sect’s Nascent Soul seed, *Thunder Silver*!

*This brat actually dares block my path in Qingzhou, capturing demonic cultivators and putting on this charade!*

*Very well. Today, we settle this once and for all!*

"*Thunder Silver! Do you remember Yin Wuming of the Blood River Hall?!*"

A thunderous roar echoed from above. The demonic cultivators below recognized the speaker—Yin Wuming was infamous in their ranks.

As leader of the demonic alliance’s joint enforcement squad, he had hunted down fugitives in the Eastern Sea, captured the Huishan Ghost, slain the Zhangtai Trio, and expelled the Turtle Sage. Ruthless beyond measure.

During the invasion of the Great Song, he had clashed multiple times with Thunder Silver, their battles ending in stalemates. Both were rising stars of the conflict.

But as the demonic forces waned, their eastern territories became heavily infiltrated. Yin Wuming was reactivated to root out spies.

After the frontline collapse, he purged several cultivation families and sects before retreating to the Eastern Sea.

---

Meanwhile, Thunder Silver—possessed by the Protector Demon King’s Nascent Soul—had kept a low profile, avoiding further encounters with Yin Wuming.

Now, meeting under these circumstances, Yin Wuming assumed his old rival was blocking his path and prepared for a decisive battle.

A bloody palm imprint materialized in the sky, reeking of gore, its shadow engulfing not just the crimson-robed youth but all orthodox cultivators below.

Panic erupted. Elder Pei paled—even at full strength, he stood no chance against Yin Wuming, whose hands were stained with countless orthodox lives.

The demonic cultivators, however, cheered. *Our reinforcements arrived first! With "Instructor Wu" gone and "Master Cen" in charge, how could they resist Yin Wuming?*

But reality proved cruel.

Though Master Cen had been mortal, he had assimilated the Protector Demon King’s vast combat experience. Instinct took over.

Soon, Yin Wuming and his men were captured.

Bruised and battered, Yin Wiming sat cross-legged on the grass, locking eyes with Elder Pei in silent dismay.

Master Cen, after much searching, finally found a passable text and resumed his droning recitation.

Both factions of cultivators slumped, struggling to stay awake. None cared for the lecture.

The pedantic scholar, true to his beliefs, wielded a ruler mercilessly against inattentive "students," leaving them seething but helpless.

The Skeletal Demon Lord suffered most. With hollow eye sockets and only flickering soulfire within, it was an easy target for the ruler.

*Why always me?* it lamented, staring at its shattered bones. *I just want to return to the Netherworld!*

But it endured. For the sake of the Primordial Spiritual Treasure, it would bear this humiliation.

---

As dusk fell, Master Cen remained enthusiastic, occasionally applauding profound passages. The others had resigned themselves to the farce.

At nightfall, the crimson-robed youth shuddered again. "Master Cen" faded reluctantly, making way for a new persona.

"*Heaven would be devoid without Ma Yuanjue; the path of swords would languish in eternal night!*"

"..."

"..."

"..."

This time, the introduction fell flat. The crowd simply stared silently.

Most could guess this figure’s identity—the third and final persona, following "Instructor Wu" and "Master Cen."

Ma Yuanjue, a wandering swordsman once hailed as the "Sword Saint."

Unexpectedly, his first act wasn’t to drill them in martial arts or force-feed them knowledge. Instead, he picked up the discarded *Rites of Duke Zhou* and began reading—with evident relish, nodding and smiling to himself.

Seeing this, the cultivators’ hopes stirred.

*This one seems... lax. Maybe we can escape?*

The demonic cultivators, desperate to avoid impending orthodox reinforcements, grew restless. Even with the crimson-robed youth’s power, could he withstand a Nascent Soul elder?

Yin Wuming subtly signaled his subordinates.

Understanding, they rose to test the waters.

But before they took three steps—

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

Three sword beams flashed. With their cultivation sealed, the men fell dead instantly.

Gasps erupted. *This persona actually kills!*

Unlike "Instructor Wu" and "Master Cen," who had only disciplined them, this "Sword Saint" showed no mercy.

The crimson-robed "Ma Yuanjue" spoke coolly, addressing the crowd.

"Since you’re their students, I can’t let you leave. When they return tomorrow and find everyone gone, how would I explain?"

*Murder is your solution?!* they inwardly screamed.

Ma Yuanjue shrugged, tossing the book aside. "That was just a warning. Stay put, don’t trouble me, and I won’t act."

Then, as if struck by inspiration, he faced them.

"Unlike those stubborn two, I’ve no interest in mediocrity. I seek only the elite."

His eyes gleamed with arrogance.

"*And I’ll take just one personal disciple.*"

"In two days, once I’ve suppressed their personas and gained full control, my disciple and I will roam the world freely..."

"*Hmm... the outcome should be clear by tomorrow.*"

The orthodox cultivators were indifferent, but the demonic ones saw a glimmer of hope.

*Become his disciple, and escape is guaranteed!*

But only one would survive. The rest, their cultivation sealed, were doomed.

Even among the orthodox, some grasped the implication—though they had no reason to compete. Staying put meant rescue.

Besides, who could rival Yin Wuming for the spot?
