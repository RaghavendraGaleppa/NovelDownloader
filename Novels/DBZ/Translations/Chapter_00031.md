# Chapter 31: The Protection of Wishes  

Li Wanqing was the first to charge forward, but the second wasn't the second-strongest Li Wanhai—it was Wei Qian!  

Fourteen days of wish-granting power indicated that the journey to the [Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City] would undoubtedly be fraught with danger, likely claiming the lives of at least three or four people.  

*"First, I need to break away from the group. With the protective power of the Dragon Pearl's wish, this trip will be perilous but ultimately safe."* Wei Qian thought to himself.  

Thus, he acted boldly, urging his horse forward and deliberately separating from the group.  

Under normal circumstances, traveling alone would be a death wish, but for Wei Qian...  

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*  

Several black-clad figures appeared behind the group, swiftly closing in.  

Though the young Foundation Establishment ancestor of the Wang family hadn’t come personally, he had sent a squad—not to annihilate the group, but merely to delay them.  

Once the Wang family’s Foundation Establishment expert killed Li Xianyao and arrived here, the Li family would be finished.  

"Commander, there’s a Qi Refinement fifth-level junior over there. Should we chase and kill him?" one of the black-clad men asked.  

"What’s the point of killing him? Can he reach Foundation Establishment?" the leader coldly retorted.  

"Stop Li Wanqing! Today, anyone else can escape, but Li Wanqing must not get away!"  

The Wang family had prepared thoroughly for this operation, having already identified the Li family’s peak Qi Refinement cultivators.  

Thus, the moment this group arrived, they immediately targeted Li Wanqing.  

"Brother Wanqing, go ahead! I’ll hold them off!" Li Wanhai roared, charging forward to block the attackers.  

"Good! I’m counting on you, Brother Wanhai!" Li Wanqing wasn’t foolish—he didn’t even stop for his son, merely instructing him to follow Wei Qian before sprinting desperately toward the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City.  

*Just one more day—no, half a day—and we’ll make it!*  

The outer regions of the [Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City] were patrolled by the Xiao family’s guards. The Wang family wouldn’t dare act there.  

*"As expected, no one is chasing me."*  

After galloping sixty li in one breath, Wei Qian finally glanced back—no pursuers in sight.  

The Dragon Pearl’s wish-granting power had worked.  

Breaking away from the group had ensured no one came after him, allowing him to escape unscathed.  

Well, that wasn’t entirely true.  

After waiting a dozen breaths, Wei Qian finally spotted a figure following him—Li Guchen.  

A faint smile tugged at Wei Qian’s lips. *This kid followed me—he bet right this time.*  

He waited briefly for Li Guchen to catch up before urging his horse onward again.  

---  

*This kid has only gone on two missions, yet both times he encountered danger. I don’t know whether to call him lucky or unlucky,* Wei Qian mused silently.  

With pursuers behind them, Wei Qian and Li Guchen traveled by night and hid by day, running for ten days straight before finally reaching the Xiao family’s territory.  

Only after being inspected by the Xiao family’s patrol did Wei Qian finally relax.  

For now, they were temporarily safe.  

"Brother Qian, do you think the Ancestor, the family head, and my father…" Li Guchen, visibly downcast, suddenly spoke up.  

Wei Qian immediately cut him off. "Don’t overthink it. By the time we enter the city, Elder Wanqing might already be there."  

"If the Ancestor sent people out, he must have a backup plan. The Li family has stood for over two hundred years—they won’t fall so easily."  

Then, he nearly laughed at himself.  

*I’m an outsider, while Li Guchen is a true Li family member. Yet here I am comforting him.*  

*"I hope things are as I say."*  

But regardless, he and Li Guchen weren’t completely safe yet.  

So, they pressed on. After another two hours of travel, they finally saw a sprawling black silhouette in the distance.  

A terrifying pressure emanated from it!  

*"What level of formation is that?!"* Wei Qian was stunned.  

The sensation was all too familiar—it was the same as when a mountain-protecting formation was activated. But this formation was hundreds, if not thousands, of times more powerful than the one on Mist Ridge Mountain!  

"They say the [Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City] has a fourth-grade formation. I thought it was just a rumor…" Li Guchen murmured in awe.  

"Seems like it’s true," Wei Qian replied.  

The Alchemy Cauldron Xiao family was a lineage of alchemists, boasting hundreds of in-house pill refiners and an equal number of hired ones.  

Pill trading was immensely profitable. With the Xiao family’s wealth, constructing a fourth-grade formation wasn’t surprising.  

As they drew closer, the "black silhouette" revealed its true form—a towering wall that stretched into the heavens!  

This was the [Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City]!  

In both his past and present lives, Wei Qian had never seen a man-made structure as grand as this.  

A city built by immortals through divine arts.  

Even with prior mental preparation, the sheer magnificence of the city still left him breathless.  

---  

"Let’s go inside," Wei Qian said to Li Guchen, who was equally stunned.  

"Once we enter this city, the Wang family is nothing but trash."  

Li Guchen nodded unconsciously.  

Indeed, compared to the "Alchemy Cauldron Xiao family"—one of the five great immortal clans of the Zhao Kingdom’s cultivation world—the "Blackwater Pool Wang family," with its two Foundation Establishment experts, was utterly insignificant.  

Rumors claimed the Xiao family had over a hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators—and that was just the publicly known number. It wouldn’t be surprising if they had another dozen or so hidden away.  

The Blackwater Pool Wang family was nothing here, and neither was the Mist Ridge Mountain Li family.  

So, Wei Qian and Li Guchen obediently joined the queue at the city gates, submitting to the formation’s inspection before being allowed entry.  

"Entry into the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City requires one low-grade spirit stone per person. Staying or residing within the city costs an additional low-grade spirit stone every ten days," a black-armored guard at the gate announced.  

Judging by his aura, he was at least at the seventh level of Qi Refinement.  

In the Li family of Mist Ridge Mountain, such a cultivator would be considered high-ranking.  

But here, he was just a lowly gatekeeper.  

The two naturally complied, each receiving a token after paying.  

The token had a jade embedded in its center, currently glowing green.  

Seeing their compliance, the guard’s tone softened slightly. "If the token’s light turns yellow, it means the ten-day deadline is approaching. You must pay the fee promptly."  

"If the deadline passes, the token will glow red. At that point, do not move—stay where you are and wait for the law enforcement team to arrive—"  

Before the guard could finish, Wei Qian heard a familiar voice from behind.  

"Guchen?!"
