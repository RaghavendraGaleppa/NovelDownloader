Chapter 105: The Golden Crow Contemplation Diagram, Able to Manifest the Scene of Nine Suns in the Sky

Xiao Li's current most powerful move was "Shaking People." The judge and the Earth煞 assassin didn't die peacefully. Shang Wu was now extremely angry. She had a bad temper when woken up, and just now, she had been having a dream about falling onto a gold mountain before being rudely awakened.

With a "gudong" sound, the judge stiffly turned his head and saw the tall, palace-attired woman standing behind him, looking down at him with a gaze that was both condescending and menacing. Her peach blossom eyes burned with a red and white flame. He smelled the charred scent of his own body, struggled to breathe, and felt his mouth dry up.

"Good...good man, actually I'm..." he tried to explain.

"Hmph..." Shang Wu sneered, her lips curling up. "You can do whatever you want, I don't care." With a loud "peng" sound, she punched the judge, making him shrink by half as his head was smashed into his chest.

The black-robed man saw the situation was not good and summoned countless vengeful spirits, creating a scene like the opening of hell, while he himself retreated rapidly. However, the surging black tide was evaporated into nothingness before it could even touch the palace-attired woman.

"Hmph, you want to escape?!" Shang Wu glanced at the unconscious young children and flew into the air. Flames mixed with white fire radiated from her body, and behind her appeared a lotus flower made of crystal. Although the lotus hadn't bloomed yet, it carried the aura of purifying all the filth in the world, like a new sun driving away the darkness.

The great sun transformed into a meteor, illuminating the boundless night. As Shang Wu punched out, the lotus petals gently swayed, and a pleasant female voice, which was also Shang Wu's, echoed between the clouds: "The phoenix cries out on the high hill. The wutong tree grows in the morning sun."

The flames blazed, and the clouds shone. Wherever Shang Wu passed, the vengeful spirits were burned, leaving only the purest spiritual essence, which returned to the heavens and the earth. Zuo Qiu Yang swallowed hard, thinking that this woman, who spent her days drunk and idle in a hot pot restaurant, was actually so fierce.

Just as everyone was in awe, Qian Xing Wu Zun's voice suddenly echoed in Xiao Qin's mind. "Little one, what's your aunt's surname?" Xiao Qin replied, "She's surnamed Shang, from the ancient Shang dynasty." Qian Xing Wu Zun's voice was filled with contemplation and puzzlement, "Surnamed Shang... Southern Ming Li Fire... but she's so young..."

Before Qian Xing Wu Zun could finish, the flames completely consumed the black tide. Shang Wu's fist smashed into the black-robed man, instantly igniting him and turning him into a rain of fire. Li Mo watched the fireworks explode, thinking that his master's strength was the one thing he could always rely on.

Jiang Chu Long slowly regained consciousness, unsure of what had happened. She knew that a bad guy had appeared, trying to take her away, but Mei Yi had protected her. Then, Li Da Ge had arrived, bringing a fierce big sister. She was safe now.

"Mei Yi, are you okay?" Jiang Chu Long asked, supporting the middle-aged woman. Mei Yi shook her head, trying to smile calmly, "I'm fine." However, her gaze fell on the ring on Jiang Chu Long's hand and then on Li Mo, filled with confusion and contemplation.

Li Mo was also looking at her, using his Heavenly Mandate Divine Eye. The information revealed: Name: Mei Yun, Age: 39, Root Bone: Astonishing Sword Body, Realm: Inner Scene Nine Heavens, Heavenly Mandate: Blue, Evaluation: Originally one of the four sword servants of Tian Shan Jian Zhuang's Xuan Nu, originally an Outer Scene Realm, self-destructed Tian Shan Jian Zhuang's absolute skill and left the sect. Recent Experience: Escaped from Xun Tian Wei's pursuit, returned to Zi Yang Fu City, secretly protected the master's only bloodline, currently injured, Inner Scene almost depleted.

Li Mo realized that Mei Yun was the one who had been protecting Jiang Chu Long. He had been puzzled by how he could sense an Inner Scene expert, but it turned out she was injured. "Senior, your injury is quite severe," Li Mo said, taking out a bottle of Wu Yun Zi Ling Dan. "This should be useful to you." Mei Yun silently accepted the medicine, her eyes flashing with gratitude.

As they conversed, figures appeared in the sky, powerful experts from various sects, including Qing Yuan Zong's elders. They were drawn by Shang Wu's display of strength. Li Mo suggested, "Since we're all here, why don't we discuss this over a meal at my hot pot restaurant?" The elders looked at him, speechless.

After the chaos subsided, Li Mo returned to his room, lay on his bed, and thought, "It's time to claim my rewards." In his mind, he said, "Claim." The system responded, "Claim successful. Reward one: Green Wood Vital Liquid. Reward two: Golden Crow Transformation Sun Contemplation Diagram." The Green Wood Vital Liquid could revive the dead and contain vigorous vitality, while the Golden Crow Transformation Sun Contemplation Diagram allowed the user to manifest the scene of nine suns in the sky upon contemplation.
