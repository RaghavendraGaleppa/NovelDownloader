# Chapter 77: A One-Sided Beating

On the arena stage.

Meeting an enemy face-to-face, their eyes burned with hatred, and the air was thick with tension.

But upon hearing those familiar voices cheering for him, Li Mo felt so awkward he could have dug a hole in the ground with his toes. He could no longer ignore Wang Hao’s gaze, which looked as if it wanted to devour him.

*Please, stop chanting.*

“Let me see what you’re made of, Junior Brother Li.”

Wang Hao’s internal energy surged, his aura locking onto Li Mo opposite him.

The moment Qian Bufan shouted “Begin,” Wang Hao shot forward like an arrow leaving the string.

His fist emitted a faint black light, clearly wearing a special pair of gauntlets.

As he threw his punch, a whistling wind sounded like the roar of tigers and leopards, and the sound of his churning internal energy was like a thunderclap.

Many within the Clear Abyss Sect recognized this technique. It was the signature move of the Inner Sect Steward, Butcher—a top-tier martial art known as the Tiger and Leopard Thunderclap Hand.

“Here it comes.”

Excitement surged within Li Mo.

This was, in fact, the first time he had engaged in a proper fight with someone. Last time, he fought Cui Peng when the latter was already on his last legs; Cui Peng hadn’t even exchanged a few moves before being beaten to death.

He did not draw his sword.

Instead, he shook his bones, and the energy of his thirty-six meridians surged. Twisting his waist, he threw a punch straight at Wang Hao’s.

Wang Hao was taken aback for a moment, then a vicious smirk curled his lips.

*So, he is relying on his reputation and refuses to use the Chixiao Sword, trying to fight me with bare hands?*

He had been worried that his gauntlets wouldn’t withstand the edge of a Mystical Weapon for long. Li Mo’s action was exactly what he wanted.

Facing an opponent of a higher realm, he didn't use his full strength immediately and was even arrogant enough to care about saving face.

Today, he would make this guy experience what true cruelty was...

But could he really do it?

“Huh? A Blood Energy Realm fighting an Internal Energy Realm, and he’s not even using a weapon?”

“Not only is he not using a weapon, it seems he isn’t even using a martial art.”

“Senior Brother Li has a background in body refining. I often see him at the Divine Blade Cave; he might have other tricks up his sleeve?”

“Even if body refining reaches the extreme of the Blood Energy Realm, it shouldn’t be that exaggerated. Otherwise, everyone would just practice body refining; who would bother learning other martial arts?”

“Isn’t he renowned for his swordsmanship?”

...

A Blood Energy Realm practitioner fighting an Internal Energy Realm practitioner who is armed, without even using a weapon himself?

Anyone watching would be baffled.

However... the two fists collided in an instant.

*Clang—*

A bare fist against a gauntlet actually produced a bell-like chime.

A circle of dust billowed out from the center of the two.

A figure stumbled backward, leaving a series of deep craters in the ground.

When everyone saw who had been forced back, they were all stunned as if they had seen a ghost.

It was Wang Hao!

Wang Hao’s face was pale, his smile frozen at the corners of his mouth.

The arm he had just used to clash was trembling uncontrollably.

He hadn’t practiced body refining, but that didn’t mean his physical quality was poor. Even without internal energy, his body was no weaker than that of a common exotic beast. And he had just used his internal energy.

How could Li Mo’s strength be so immense?

Before the thought could settle, the figure of the youth opposite him vanished from its spot.

Of course, it wasn’t actual teleportation.

Shadow Wind Step.

Wang Hao also utilized a footwork technique.

However, Li Mo’s figure was like a raging wind sweeping through, following him like a shadow.

What was Little Li thinking right now?

Hmm... On the arena, intentional killing was not allowed. He was wondering if it was a bit inappropriate to beat the other to death.

He didn’t even need to take out his hammer.

Even if he used his sword, the sharpness of the Chixiao Sword, combined with the swordsmanship he had gained from sparring with the Ice Cube and Jiang Chulong, was absolutely something Wang Hao couldn’t withstand.

Furthermore, he wanted to test just what the upper limit of this body—which couldn’t even be pierced by a supreme martial art against an Internal Energy Realm practitioner—truly was.

In an instant.

Li Mo appeared before Wang Hao.

Their eyes met for a split second.

Being stared at by those fiery pupils, Wang Hao felt an inexplicable chill in his heart and swallowed hard.

But then, shame and anger rose within him.

In the history of the Nine Peaks Martial Competition, no Internal Energy Jade Liquid Realm practitioner had ever looked so pathetic before a Blood Energy Realm practitioner.

He was angry, but it was useless.

A sharp pain shot through his waist, temporarily robbing him of the ability to think.

“An inner armor?”

“So, you’re quite durable.”

---

Li Mo frowned.

He had just punched Wang Hao, but the sensation wasn’t that of hitting the other’s body.

“Wait...”

A bad premonition rose in Wang Hao’s heart, but he didn’t even get to finish his sentence.

“Senior Brother Li was caught by Wang Hao?”

“No, it’s Wang Hao who was caught by Senior Brother Li!”

Once again, the Tiger and Leopard Thunderclap Hand collided with a normal punch.

*Crack—*

The gauntlet was dented.

Seizing the opportunity, while Wang Hao’s mind was shaken, Li Mo pressed his advantage like a mad dog beating a drowning one, driving an elbow strike into the other’s chest.

He used the “One Qi Through” of the Six Harmonies Fist as if it were “One Fluid Motion.”

Fists, elbow strikes, knee strikes...

*Bang, bang, bang—*

Wang Hao, wearing his inner armor, was beaten down onto the arena stage by Li Mo. His liquid internal energy was completely useless, only able to protect his vital points.

He wasn’t without attempts to counterattack.

But... he simply couldn’t break the defense!

“Wait... wait...”

*Bang, bang, bang, bang—*

“I... I sur...”

*Bang, bang, bang, bang, bang!*

The ground cast from bluestone was now covered in web-like cracks.

This was less like a duel between experts and more like a street brawl.

And it was a one-sided beating, like an adult beating a child.

The scene was momentarily extremely brutal.

“Gulp... Holy... Holy crap...”

“Is Senior Brother Li... even human?”

“Good thing he told me not to relieve myself anywhere last time. I agreed; otherwise, it’s hard to say if I’d be incontinent right now...”

“Senior Brother Li usually looks so gentle and refined, like a pushover. Why is he so terrifying when he fights?”

“Don’t forget who his master is...”

...

Many gazes couldn't bear to look at the stage anymore.

Especially when they saw Wang Hao trying to crawl off the stage to admit defeat, only to be grabbed by the ankle by a hand and dragged back, his fingernails scratching ten marks into the ground. Everyone couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat.

It was too brutal.

Those who brought their families quickly covered the children’s eyes.

“Whew, good thing I didn’t fight Brother Li...”

Xiao Qin let out a long sigh.

To be fair, Wang Hao was currently stronger than him. If he fought Wang Hao, without his Master’s help, he wouldn’t even have a ten percent chance of winning.

“Master, is this the benefit of the Blood Energy Realm having a stronger foundation than ordinary people that you spoke of?”

“Were you this strong when you were in the Blood Energy Realm?”

The unworldly Old Xiao asked.

“Uh... Yes, s-similar.”

The voice of the Thousand Forms Martial Sovereign sounded a bit distant.

“Master, why does your voice sound weak?”

Xiao Qin was confused. Hadn’t the Master recovered a lot after using the Soul Nourishing Wood?

“Cough, cough, oh, this Little Li friend has slightly exceeded my expectations.”

“And the Soul Nourishing Wood doesn’t work that fast.”

The Martial Sovereign’s aged voice had yet to regain its former profundity.

He was also dumbfounded.

Just how many meridians does this kid have?

Did I misjudge him?

“Living is such a good thing...”

Lin Jiang swallowed hard, wiping his sweaty palms frantically on the hem of his clothes.

Although Brother Li’s fists didn’t land on him, just thinking about it made his spine tingle.

“Yeah, yeah!”

Murong Xiao nodded vigorously.

Good thing he reacted quickly back then. Thinking back, that was truly the wisest decision of his life.

By now, the looks from the people around them were no longer filled with doubt, only admiration and praise.

Where was there any match-fixing?

This was called foresight!

On the high platform.

Shang Wu waved her pink fists, her apricot eyes blinking with satisfaction. She really hadn’t picked the wrong precious disciple.

She suddenly stood up, her gaze sweeping over the many stunned elders.

She gathered her breath to her dantian and shouted:

“Haters, speak up now!”
