# Chapter 386: The Couple's Scam (1/2)

Li Mo was teaching Bing Duzi his mother's ultimate bargaining skills.

"Bing Duzi, what's the most important thing about bargaining? It's the momentum! You have to be fierce!"

"Like this?"

Ying Bing furrowed her delicate brows, her snow-touched eyes filled with a deep, profound light.

Little Li leaned back slightly:

"Uh, it doesn't have to be *that* fierce. We're bargaining, not beheading people."

"....."

Ying Bing felt that the expression she and Li Mo made was exactly the same.

To be precise, Li Mo's ice-cold face was learned from her...

"I've got it!"

Li Mo raised a finger, his genius mind coming up with a solution!

He took the white cat fur hat he had just bought and plopped it onto Bing Duzi's head.

Ying Bing wore the fluffy hat, her high-and-mighty jade countenance wrapped in white fur. Her expression remained cold and clear, but it lost the kind of aggressive look that made you feel like she was about to cut you down with a sword.

After all, a high-and-mighty cat is still cute.

Limited Edition Bing Duzi with Cat Hat!

"It suits you quite well."

"....."

And so, Li Mo pulled Ying Bing along as they strolled through the market.

Mom's Bargaining Divine Skill, First Style: The Dragon Slayer's Blade, Second Style: I Know My Stuff, Third Style: Make Less Profit, Fourth Style: If You Won't Sell, I'll Leave. These moves were originally unrivaled under heaven.

Now, there was a new move added!

Bing Duzi, be fierce!

And so, the Tiger Vanguard and the White Cat King set out on their campaign, leaving the entire street in a state of wailing.

A series of smooth, small combos made every vendor on the street remember that peerlessly beautiful face.

Later, a rumor even spread throughout Qinghe County!

The Young Mistress of the Li family was even more ruthless at bargaining!

Peeking out from under a tree and seeing this scene, the Hengyun Three Heroes once again fell into deep contemplation. They were on the tree of confusion, under the tree of confusion, you and I.

Are prodigies usually this... down-to-earth?

What happened to transcendent martial arts, arduous training, and secret weapons?

They even bargained over buying candied haws!

After a while, the New Year's market had been mostly explored by the two. They had bought quite a few things, and had also used the Bargaining Divine Skill on items they ultimately couldn't get.

Li Mo looked at the sky, carrying large and small bags, intending to go home for the New Year's Eve dinner.

"That's about enough, let's head back."

"Wait for me a moment."

"What are you going to do?"

Li Mo was stunned. That figure wearing the white cat hat had already turned around and gone back into the market.

Perhaps there were a few things she wanted to buy, and she was going back to get them?

"Haa..."

Looking at the market as dusk approached, Li Mo stood in the snow and exhaled a puff of white breath.

A moment later, Ying Bing returned, holding a big-headed doll in her hand, and carefully hung it back at her waist.

"What did you go buy?"

"I'm not telling you."

"Tsk, I didn't really want to know anyway..."

The Li Mansion.

The whole family was busy with the New Year's Eve dinner. Mom and Dad were personally cooking, bustling about in the kitchen.

The entire Li Mansion was decorated with lanterns and colored banners, dispelling the darkness of the cold night, with fine snow falling in the courtyard.

Li Mo, wearing a tiger-head hat, was organizing the New Year's goods he had just bought at the entrance. He found some firecrackers and was playing with them, lighting them with his Profound Fire.

Ying Bing sat on the clean steps, her head tilted under the white cat hat. The bottom of her eyes was illuminated by the figure of the少年 (young man) setting off firecrackers. The entire scene of snow seemed gentle.

Li Dalong clicked his tongue. Looking at the two of them, he suddenly felt his heart ease. He turned to Gu Xueqin, who was cooking, and asked:

"Wifey, will the method you thought of work?"

"What if they just need a little push from us? Besides, even if it doesn't settle things, we won't have meddled too much."

"That's true. Wifey, is the food ready? I'll bring it out."

---

As is well known, the parents of a genius are, to some extent, masterminds of ideas.

Although they don't interfere in the younger generation's affairs, the Li couple has their own way.

"Son, Little Bing'er, it's time to eat!"

Old Li shouted toward the outside. Seeing that both of them had gone to the main hall, he then carried a freshly cooked dish into the hall.

"Dad, you never used to enter the kitchen."

Li Mo took off his tiger-head hat, feeling a bit strange.

His father wasn't just someone who learned to "manipulate everyone" from being a teacher; he usually spouted things like "a gentleman stays away from the kitchen." He wouldn't even wash his own bowl, yet today he went into the kitchen to carry dishes.

"This dish was personally made by your mother, it's different!"

"It looks good, what's it called?"

Li Mo picked a piece for Ying Bing and tasted it himself.

"Delicious."

A layer of glistening oil shone on Ying Bing's lips.

"Spicy Beef Slices (Couple's Offal)."

"???"

This time, Li Dalong had done his homework very seriously. He pointed to this cold dish and explained it eloquently:

"Spicy Beef Slices (Couple's Offal) symbolizes a couple's hearts as one. Couples should support each other, work together, and create a better life..."

"....."

Inseparable?

Working together?

Listening to his father's confident explanation, Little Li couldn't help but recall a few scenes in his mind.

In the Southern Frontier, he was the Black Earth Immortal, and she was the Saintess of the Myriad Phenomena Sect...

At the Broken Axe Mountain, he handled the outside affairs while Bing Duzi managed the inside. Their cooperation was flawless, passing the chess game and fooling the Demon Summoning Sect members into a daze.

If he had learned to make this dish, could it still be called "Spicy Beef Slices (Couple's Offal)"?

But it didn't end there.

"Here, this is called 'Shared Bitterness (Liver)', and that one is 'A Hundred Years of Happy Union'."

"This 'Wife Cake' tastes good too, Xiao Mo, have some more."

"The 'Husband Soup' also has a great story behind it, your mother specifically learned it."

Old Li's verbal skills were quite good, rattling off the names of the dishes one after another.

Soon, Gu Xueqin joined the fray, constantly picking food for the two of them.

Soon, their bowls were piled high with dishes, almost all named after couples or wives.

"Mom, Dad, what's this for? I'm still young."

Li Mo said helplessly.

"We made it for ourselves, to celebrate our couple's unity this year. What does it have to do with you?" Old Li took a sip of wine.

Li Mo glanced at Ying Bing, who was chewing softly, and then, imitating her, ate as if nothing was happening, turning a deaf ear to the names of the dishes on the table.

Actually, the couple wanted to directly ask the two of their thoughts.

But they had also discussed it; if the elders interfered too much, they were afraid it might backfire.

Anyway, seeing Bing'er and Xiao Mo like this, letting nature take its course would likely lead to a good outcome.

So, during the meal, although the couple's hearts were itching, they didn't ask or say anything more.

The meal lasted about half an hour. Li Mo finished eating first and got up to return to his room.

"I'm going back to my room first."

"Wait."

"What is it?"

Li Mo turned his head.

"It's best if you come out of your own room tomorrow morning too."

Old Li, who had been busy but didn't see what he wanted to see, said somewhat displeasedly.

"Alright!"

Little Li shrugged.

He thought his father was going to wish him a happy birthday.

It was yet another year where everyone was celebrating the New Year, but no one celebrated his birthday.
