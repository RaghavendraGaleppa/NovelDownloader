# Chapter 503: Ten Years

Xu Yunfan relied on the precise regulation of his attribute panel and the inhuman willpower honed by countless attribute enhancements to forcibly guide the violent雷火 (Thunderfire) power to circulate according to the path of the *Divine Firmament Nine Celestial Profound Void Indestructible True Sutra*.

Stellar Metal Essence served as his bone meridians, Nine Heavens Thunderfire as fuel, and Eight Scenery Cloud Qi as the furnace's harmony. The three formed a profound balance and cycle within his body.

Time passed,不知 how long, until the final glimmer of light on the Thunder-Induction Array Disk at the top of the cave dwelling extinguished. The violent Thunderforce finally calmed down.

The purple lightning thunder patterns around Xu Yunfan slowly retracted. A layer of faint golden light flowed across his skin before completely vanishing. He appeared even more hale and reserved than before. Only deep within his slowly opened eyes did a sharp, piercing glint occasionally flash, as if capable of piercing through everything.

He exhaled a mouthful of turbid breath. The breath carried faint crackling electric sparks, causing the air directly in front of him to ripple and distort.

He glanced at the information prompt in his vision.

> *‘Your Divine Firmament Nine Celestial Profound Void Indestructible True Sutra has reached Initial Mastery.’*

"It's finally at Initial Mastery. It's simply inhuman to cultivate."

Despite his calm state of mind, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but feel a ripple of emotion.

The difficulty of reaching Initial Mastery in this True Sutra far exceeded that of the *Mysterious Capital Eight Scenery Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Scroll*. If not for the Lotus Seal Mantra and the attribute panel, he would have had no chance of success.

He wondered how the Lord of the Divine Firmament Nine Celestials managed to cultivate it back then; it was simply too monstrous.

By comparison, the Pure Yang Ancestor seemed even more monstrous, capable of three sword strikes to obliterate the Lord of the Divine Firmament Nine Celestials into ash.

He settled his mind. Since he had reached Initial Mastery, the next steps were the daily grind of water磨ing工夫 (water-grinding effort), optimization via the attribute panel, and stacking proficiency.

Xu Yunfan completely immersed himself in cultivation. His main body remained hidden in this cave dwelling, using the *Divine Firmament Nine Celestial Profound Void Indestructible True Sutra* as his fundamental cultivation method, supplemented by the *Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Art* to comprehend sword intent. He allocated a portion of his mind to continuously monitor his clone's movements in the East Wasteland.

Time passed like a white pony flashing past a crevice, and in the blink of an eye, nearly ten years had passed.

Inside the cave dwelling at Cold Crow Pass.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged. The aura around him was as heavy and deep as an abyss.

Beneath his skin, nine layers of lightning flashed intermittently. Every flash seemed to cause the surrounding space to tremble slightly.

His bones were like jade, glowing with a reserved purple-gold luster. Between his five organs and six viscera, tiny thunder pools seemed to be slowly rotating. His blood surged, containing star-like scorching heat.

This was the external manifestation of the *Divine Firmament Nine Celestial Profound Void Indestructible True Sutra* cultivated to Great Perfection, a realm where one's cultivation参究造化 (studies creation).

Ten years of bitter cultivation, the accumulation of countless resources within Cold Crow Pass, and the heaven-defying optimization of the attribute panel finally allowed this incredibly profound cultivation method to reach the realm of Great Perfection. The terror of his physical body's strength was far beyond that of an ordinary late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.

His cultivation base had also naturally reached the mid-stage peak of Foundation Establishment.

He was only a step away from Qi Gathering and forming the Inner Scenery Cave Heaven, after which he would step into late-stage Foundation Establishment.

"Great Perfection realm... mid-stage peak of Foundation Establishment... Does that mean when the True Sutra is perfected, I will enter late-stage Foundation Establishment? And then, reaching the extreme, I will attain the realm of Great True Person?"

Xu Yunfan murmured internally, "The foundation is already laid. Next, I must gradually condense divine abilities and construct rituals in the direction of the Divine Firmament Nine Celestial Throne."

This progress, if placed on the Lord of the Divine Firmament Nine Celestials of the past, would likely have been shocking.

But for him, this was merely the starting point.

As for the Cold Crow Pass he was guarding, for Xu Yunfan, it was merely a place to gather resources.

Over the past few decades, the上下 (upper and lower) ranks of Cold Crow Pass had long since figured out the temperament of this new Guard Commander.

He remained entrenched within the Guard Commander's cave dwelling, paying almost no attention to the trivial affairs of the pass, appearing completely detached.

The gates of the Guard Commander's Mansion remained closed year-round. Aside from necessary handovers of affairs and the delivery of resources, few were able to disturb his secluded cultivation.

This almost "non-action" governance inevitably led to thoughts of contempt or opportunism at the beginning.

However, this relaxation brought about by apparent neglect was suddenly shattered when a Foundation Establishment True Person from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect arrived at Cold Crow Pass, causing a massive shock to all those secretly watching or waiting to make a move.

That True Person of the Sword Sect arrived with the imposing status of an orthodox disciple of the sect, his aura fierce, with an unclear intention.

Perhaps it was to hold him accountable, or perhaps to test the depth of this new Guard Commander.

He arrived riding his sword, his sword light sharp, its锋芒 (edge) pointing directly at the core area of the Guard Commander's Mansion. His posture was overbearing, treating the regulations of the pass as nothing, clearly not placing this Guard Commander who lived in seclusion in his eyes.

Xu Yunfan estimated that it was likely because he had been sent out of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect by the Pure Yang Ancestor, and forces from other True Lords of the Sword Sect were dissatisfied. Since the True Lords were not convenient to act, a Foundation Establishment True Person naturally was.

In the world, who in the same realm could defeat a sword cultivator in a one-on-one fight?

However, the moment that sword cultivator True Person's sword intent was directed, a sudden change occurred.

The sky, which had been silent over Cold Crow Pass, suddenly darkened. It wasn't the arrival of night, but rather a vast, ink-black thundercloud that condensed in an instant. It was incredibly thick, covering the entire sky above the pass, its momentum like lead or iron, heavy and about to fall.

Deep within the clouds, muffled thunder rolled. Thick purple-white electric snakes writhed frantically within the black clouds, emitting a destructive aura that made even Foundation Establishment cultivators feel their hearts pound and their scalps go numb.

The soaring aura of that Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's Foundation Establishment True Person was instantly suppressed by this majestic heavenly might. The sharp sword light, locked down by the heavenly tribulation filling the sky, suddenly dimmed and retracted.

He looked up in horror, his eyes filled with shock and disbelief.

He saw that at the core of the thick black clouds, countless dazzling Divine Firmament Thunderbolts, like awakening ancient thunder dragons, locked their aura firmly onto him, poised to strike.

*Boom!*

*Crackle!!*

The Sword Sect True Person was given almost no time to react, and Xu Yunfan didn't even show his face.

The next moment, hundreds and thousands of Divine Firmament Thunderbolts roared furiously, transforming into violent pillars of light that tore through the sky, launching a fierce and precise indiscriminate bombardment against that sword cultivator.

It wasn't just one or two bolts, but hundreds or thousands of purple-white electric dragons containing the will of destruction, raining down in a狂轰滥炸 (blanket bombardment).

The thunder light was dazzling, and the rumbling sounds echoed through the four fields.

Cultivators within the pass, regardless of their cultivation level, were all terrified by this terrifying scene that shook the heavens and the earth, their faces turning pale and their mouths shut tight.

The entire ground veins of Cold Crow Pass trembled slightly under this violent thunderforce.

Even though that Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect's Foundation Establishment True Person had a solid foundation and sharp sword techniques, and hastily raised his protective treasures and flying swords to block, he was still battered and exhausted by the dense, waterfall-like, mighty Divine Firmament Thunderbolts. The protective light flickered rapidly and shattered inch by inch, his flying sword let out a mournful cry, and in the end, he could only rely on the precious life-saving items bestowed by the sect to endure.

He let out several shrill cries within the sea of thunder, and without caring for his dignity, transformed into a dim sword light. Like a丧家之犬 (dog that lost its home), he broke through the blockade of the thunder curtain and fled from the range of Cold Crow Pass at the fastest speed, not looking back.

When his figure disappeared at the horizon, his robe was scorched black, and his aura was chaotic, clearly having suffered a significant loss.

This thunderous feast arrived quickly and departed quickly.

The thick thunderclouds, like heavenly punishment, slowly dispersed after driving away the uninvited guest, as if they had never appeared.
