# Chapter 18: The Demon-Containing Pagoda, Silver Hairpin, and Treasure Pouch

The first-floor manager's face was radiant with joy. 

Whenever "Blade Brother" came to deliver goods, it was the happiest moment of his day! Recently, thanks to Han Yue's massive supply of demon beast carcasses, the manager's performance had skyrocketed, significantly raising his status within the trading company.

Faced with the mountain of demon beast corpses Han Yue had brought, the manager immediately arranged for the receiving team. Six corpse-handling teams sprang into action simultaneously. 

They guided thick iron chains descending from the upper floors of the trading company building, hooking them onto the shoulders of the demon beasts. Then tremendous force transmitted through the chains, pulling the corpses away from the pile and slowly moving them to predetermined areas.

The monsters' bodies would be properly processed here—dismembered into sections before being hooked by chains and dragged upstairs for further treatment. These chains were integral parts of the building's structure, powered by its formation arrays, serving as powerful production tools.

After arranging the corpse processing, the manager turned to Han Yue with a smile and said:

"Only Blade Brother could do this! The number of demon beasts you hunt in a month equals what dozens of other hunters manage!"

"Blade Brother, with today's delivery, your stored credit with our company has exceeded ten thousand coins! It's been years since anyone in our company accumulated this much wealth through their own efforts!"

"Shall I follow the usual procedure and deposit today's earnings into your account?"

Han Yue replied:

"Today I plan to visit the upper floors. Please arrange for someone to guide us upstairs."

"Of course! I'll arrange it immediately!"

The manager summoned a tall, slender young woman dressed in a blue-green skirt resembling ancient court attire.

"Blade Brother, you can make any requests to Xiaoqing. She's one of our company's most professional guides."

After bidding farewell to the manager, Han Yue and his companion followed Xiaoqing to the second floor. After completing several major transactions with the company, Han Yue had become a highly valued VIP client. Now, all staff treated him with elevated service standards.

Guides like Xiaoqing were specially assigned to serve high-end clients within the company.

The second floor remained bustling with visitors. Xiaoqing turned to Han Yue and Xiao Liu and asked:

"Do you have anything specific in mind, honored guests? Whether it's magical artifacts, armor, elixirs, or precious materials, I can arrange them for you promptly."

Han Yue pondered for a moment before speaking:

"I've heard that above the seventh floor, the company sells high-grade treasures of the second rank and above? Since coming here, I've only visited the lower floors. Could you take us upstairs to see?"

Xiaoqing smiled in response:

"Certainly, please follow me."

She led Han Yue and Xiao Liu through the crowd into a guarded corridor. At its end was a massive vertical shaft leading directly upward. The three stepped onto a stone platform that ascended through the shaft.

As they approached the ninth floor, Han Yue caught a whiff of refreshing floral fragrance—light yet far-reaching, instantly uplifting both body and spirit.

Xiaoqing explained:

"Honored guests, our ninth floor is exclusively for second-rank clients and above. We cultivate first-rank spiritual herb [Illusion Lantern Flowers] here, hence the fragrance. Their scent is harmless to humans—prolonged exposure can clear meridians and nourish the body, making them quite valuable natural treasures."

Entering the ninth floor, Han Yue saw a spacious area meticulously arranged like a garden. The company had actually grown plants and trees indoors, complete with water features.

Xiao Liu was exhilarated—this was the legendary ninth floor of the trading company. In the entire meat distribution center, few could ascend here. Full of curiosity, he kept asking Xiaoqing questions, which she patiently answered.

Han Yue's access to this floor indicated the company now treated him as a second-rank cultivator.

Xiaoqing guided them to an exquisite pavilion where she prepared tea using pre-arranged utensils. As the tea bubbled, its rich aroma filled the air.

Without further hesitation, Han Yue stated:

"Miss Xiaoqing, I need to purchase a storage artifact with ample capacity. Could you first introduce some options?"

While pouring tea, Xiaoqing replied:

"Does Mr. Han have specific items to store? Storage artifacts have stringent material requirements—the more complex the primal energy composition of stored items, the higher the material grade needed."

"Our company only manufactures corpse containment bags among storage artifacts. They're most suitable for containing demon beast materials with bloodline power and are relatively affordable."

"Similar artifacts include mineral sacks for metals and ores, medicine boxes for plant materials, and various enchanted bottles for liquids."

"However, artifacts capable of containing multiple primal energy types are significantly more expensive and offer smaller storage space."

After listening, Han Yue responded:

"Corpse containment bags would indeed be very useful for me, but I still need an artifact that can hold multiple energy types, even if the space is limited."

Understanding his needs, Xiaoqing decisively took out a jade talisman and crushed it, releasing a stream of information. Shortly after, a servant entered carrying a tray with three items.

The first was a half-foot tall exquisite pagoda, entirely emerald green as if carved from a single piece of jade.

The second was a hairpin—silver-gray throughout, smooth as jade, with simple yet refined craftsmanship, unisex with no engravings.

The third was a palm-sized brocade pouch woven from multicolored threads, embroidered with a simple "storage" character.

Xiaoqing introduced:

"Our company prices storage artifacts primarily based on internal space—approximately five hundred coins per cubic meter."

"This [Demon-Containing Pagoda] is carved from a single piece of second-rank [Void Spirit Jade], containing fifty cubic meters of space, valued at twenty-five thousand coins!"

"The second item, [Silver Hairpin], was custom-ordered by a great cultivator. We specially commissioned a renowned artifact master from distant lands to craft it."

"But before completion, the cultivator departed for foreign realms, leaving it with us until now."

"This hairpin is forged entirely from [Ascending Gold Fragmented Silver], extremely durable and resistant to damage."

"Its space measures slightly over thirteen cubic meters, but due to rare materials and master craftsmanship, it's priced at ten thousand coins."

"Lastly, this [Treasure Pouch] is a conventional storage artifact—what most cultivators actually use."

"It contains less than three cubic meters, priced at one thousand coins, representing the best value for money."

Xiaoqing's detailed explanation of the three storage artifacts greatly expanded Han Yue and Xiao Liu's horizons.
