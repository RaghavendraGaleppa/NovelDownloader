Chapter 94: Why Is He Here?

After incorporating various true talisman spells, Chu Ning continued to explore how to use this divine ability. For instance, he tried to figure out how to replace one of the five true talisman spells within the talisman ring. He discovered that he could only activate one spell, and only after a quarter of an hour could he integrate another true talisman spell. He also attempted to integrate identical talismans, which didn't affect the process.

Ultimately, Chu Ning chose to incorporate one Adamant Talisman, one Yin Thunder Talisman, one Earth Escape Talisman, and two Geng Metal Sword Talismans into his talisman ring. These were the highest-grade talismans he could currently craft, and this configuration offered a balance of offense, defense, and escape. However, this was only temporary. His next goal was to integrate primary-grade superior talismans.

Returning to the market from the hillside, Chu Ning closed his door and immediately went to the talisman crafting room. The *Spiritual Talisman Secret Records* not only contained primary-grade medium talismans but also three types of primary-grade superior talismans. Now that Chu Ning had reached the late-stage of Qi Refining, he could certainly attempt to craft these primary-grade superior talismans.

After cultivating the Mind Refining Technique once to adjust his spiritual sense to its optimal state, Chu Ning took out his talisman brush and other tools from his storage bag. At the same time, he recalled the information about primary-grade superior talismans recorded in the *Spiritual Talisman Secret Records*. Among the three superior-grade talismans were the Red Flame Fire Talisman (a fire-elemental attack talisman), the Cloud Soaring Talisman (which allowed a cultivator to fly for a period), and the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman (a defensive talisman). According to the descriptions, the difficulty of crafting these three talismans ranged from easy to difficult. Since Chu Ning had never crafted a primary-grade superior talisman before, he decided to start with the simplest, the Red Flame Fire Talisman.

After reviewing the crafting method for the Red Flame Fire Talisman in his mind, Chu Ning picked up his brush and began to craft. Despite it being his first time attempting a primary-grade superior talisman, with the augmentation of his Talisman Origin Spirit Body, Chu Ning felt as if he had been familiar with this talisman for a long time. On this particular sheet of talisman paper, Chu Ning only failed at the very last moment, just before the final stroke, due to a minor oversight.

Spreading out a new sheet of talisman paper, Chu Ning closed his eyes and briefly recalled the process of his failed attempt. Then, he dipped his brush in ink again and began his second try. This time, Chu Ning completed the entire talisman almost in one go. However, the moment the talisman runes illuminated with a red glow and retracted into the paper, "Sizzle!" The talisman paper instantly burst into flames, signaling Chu Ning's second failure.

Chu Ning was stunned, unable to react immediately. He felt there had been no problem with the talisman crafting just now. The red glow that appeared when the runes formed actually, to some extent, signified the success of the talisman. Why, then, did it suddenly burst into flames at the last moment?

Somewhat perplexed, Chu Ning took out a third sheet of talisman paper and began crafting, then a fourth. Two consecutive sheets of talisman paper had slight fluctuations in spiritual power and were damaged before completion. On the fifth sheet, Chu Ning finally managed to completely outline the talisman runes. Then, to his surprise, just like the second sheet, the talisman paper burst into flames the moment the runes formed and emitted a red glow.

Chu Ning, refusing to believe it, continued crafting until he had used 10 sheets of talisman paper before finally stopping. His brows furrowed tightly. Out of 10 sheets, he had successfully outlined the runes on 4. This was comparable to the forty percent success rate he had when first encountering certain talismans. However, what puzzled Chu Ning was that all four sheets, which he felt should have definitely succeeded, inexplicably burned up.

Having never encountered such a situation since he started crafting talismans, Chu Ning was quite bewildered. He then tried crafting the other two types of talismans, and without exception, the same thing happened. Yet, when Chu Ning crafted the Adamant Talisman, a primary-grade medium talisman, there was no problem at all; he completed it with ease.

"Could it be because I just reached Qi Refining Level Seven, and my spiritual power is unstable?" Chu Ning found a reason, but then thought again that it couldn't be. After all, during the recent talisman crafting process, Chu Ning hadn't felt any deficiency in his spiritual power.

At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly considered a possibility. He picked up a sheet of talisman paper and examined it. "Could it be the quality of the talisman paper?" As he muttered this, he began to sense it with his spiritual sense. After only a short while, Chu Ning's expression became somewhat peculiar. There was indeed a high possibility that the problem lay with the talisman paper.

He had given a good portion of the talisman paper he crafted himself to Mu Ling before. Plus, since learning to craft talismans, he had been making quite a lot each day. The small amount of talisman paper made from the Ink Spirit Bamboo he had planted earlier had long been used up. The talisman paper he held now was brought by Lin Changqing from the sect. The initial feel of these talisman papers in his hand was not significantly different, but when he carefully sensed them with his spiritual sense, he found that there were still some impurities within them, not completely purified. The impurities were indeed few, having no impact when carrying primary-grade medium talismans, but they proved problematic when carrying higher-grade primary-grade superior talismans.

Such an issue was impossible with the talisman paper he made himself. Logically, it shouldn't appear in other talisman papers from the sect either. After all, primary-grade superior, medium, and inferior talismans all used this type of ordinary talisman paper, so the sect's quality requirements should be the same. Evidently, there was some lapse that caused this kind of talisman paper to end up with him.

"I wonder if the problem lies in the recycling process or the distribution for sale," Chu Ning sighed, somewhat speechless about Qingxi Sect's management. Then his expression became strange. "Could it be that Zhuang Yunde was responsible for collecting these?" Yet, in his impression, though Zhuang Yunde was a bit greedy, he was always careful in his actions. Chu Ning had no way to investigate the specifics.

Since he couldn't attempt to craft primary-grade superior talismans, Chu Ning simply stopped trying. The talisman paper he had would be used for crafting lower-grade primary-grade inferior and medium talismans. Fortunately, his Purple Crystal Bamboo would be ready to be used for talisman paper in a while, so he wouldn't have to worry.

The reason the Purple Crystal Bamboo was growing so quickly was actually thanks to Little White. One day, after seeing the growth of the Iron Stem Orchid, Chu Ning had a sudden inspiration when he visited the spiritual field. Since Little White could ripen the Iron Stem Orchid, making it bear Iron Orchid Fruits, it should also be able to ripen the Purple Crystal Bamboo. It was just that ten mu of land was a bit much; the little fellow probably couldn't urinate enough. But it didn't matter; he could ripen it little by little. So, over the past two months, Little White had urinated all over the Purple Crystal Bamboo in the spiritual field. However, it seemed it still needed to speed up.

With the idea of ripening the Purple Crystal Bamboo as quickly as possible, Chu Ning went directly to the spiritual field the next morning. His Azure Wood Everlasting Art had already reached Qi Refining Level Seven, so he didn't need to rapidly advance through the Azure Wood Spring Radiance Art in the short term. If that were the case, cultivating in the market with the help of the Iron Stem Orchid didn't have a significant impact. It would be more convenient for him to craft primary-grade superior talismans if he applied the Azure Wood Spring Radiance Art more to the Purple Crystal Bamboo, ripening them as quickly as possible.

Entering the spiritual field, Chu Ning didn't rush to use the Azure Wood Spring Radiance Art. Instead, he said to Little White, "Come, come, Little White, come here and urinate on these bamboos."

Little White blinked its eyes pitifully when it heard Chu Ning's words. Ever since the first time it caused trouble in the spiritual field and was trapped by Chu Ning's Beast-Trapping Talisman, it knew these were things Chu Ning cherished, so it had always been careful. Once, Chu Ning even asked it to urinate on the bamboo, and the little creature, delighted, immediately did so. But after that, Chu Ning brought it here every single day. Chu Ning even forcefully made it drink more water, even though it was spirit-infused water from the Sweet Dew Art. Still, Little White was quite unhappy about being relegated to a "fertilizer-spreading tool." It protested to Chu Ning multiple times, but its protests were ignored. Just two days ago, it had finally managed to water all ten mu of bamboo little by little each day. He didn't expect to have to start all over again today.

"Don't look so wronged. When these bamboos ripen in a few days, I'll give you some to chew on," Chu Ning said, tempting Little White when he saw it wasn't moving. Sure enough, as soon as the little creature heard this, it immediately sprang into action. It ran while urinating, watering several bamboos.

Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction at the sight, then took out a Magnolia Fruit from his storage bag and tossed it to Little White. Little White caught it and happily began to eat. At this point, Chu Ning began to cast the Azure Wood Spring Radiance Art over and over again in the spiritual field, both to improve the quality of the Purple Crystal Bamboo and to ripen it.

By noon, Chu Ning meditated in the spiritual field for a while, fully restoring his spiritual power. He was preparing to leave the spiritual field with Little White and return to the market.

"Hmm?" Just then, Chu Ning's gaze inadvertently swept over the hillside where he usually practiced the Azure Wood Sword Art. He vaguely saw several figures, which made him slightly startled. This spiritual field belonging to the Qingxi Sect had the highest spiritual energy concentration in the surrounding area. There were also some other spiritual fields nearby, belonging to a cultivating family surnamed Sun. However, the Sun family's spiritual fields were located to the northwest. Therefore, the mountain to the northeast was generally uninhabited. It was precisely for this reason that Chu Ning chose to practice his Azure Wood Sword Art there every day.

But at this moment, figures had appeared on that hillside, which naturally surprised him. However, Chu Ning quickly shook his head. Just as he was about to leave, he saw several figures run down from the mountain and rush towards his direction. Chu Ning's brows subtly twitched. He had been preparing to leave directly, but he returned to the confines of the spiritual field's barrier. Being alone outside, Chu Ning's first thought was to avoid too much contact with others to prevent trouble. Although he retreated inside the barrier, Chu Ning's gaze was still fixed on the outside. While the spiritual field's barrier had the effect of obscuring vision, its primary purpose was to block the view from outside looking in. Looking out from within the barrier, however, posed no problem.

Soon, four figures, one in front and three in pursuit, rapidly approached. One person was running ahead, with three chasing behind.

"Why is he here?" What startled Chu Ning was that he actually recognized the person in front. It was none other than the old man surnamed Sun, whom he had met in Qinghe Market back then.
