# Chapter 706: Igniting the Blood Sea of the Netherworld

He was enveloped by a faint halo that constantly cycled between life and death.

The soul-corroding Yin winds and dissolving mystic lights of the Samsara Sea, upon touching this halo, seemed to be neutralized by some force, unable to inflict any real damage upon him.

He stepped upon the blood waves as if walking on flat ground. His white hair moved without wind, and his deep eyes scanned this world of death.

A satisfied smile curled at the corner of his mouth. He had been eyeing this Great Yin Nether Python Dao Fruit for many years, waiting for the fated one to appear. He had made numerous preparations for this, and now, finally, it was time for a return.

"So it is indeed the new Divine Thunder True Lord of the Primordial Sect. You couldn't hold back after all and made such a foolish move."

The White-Haired True Lord's voice was gentle, yet like a snake flicking its tongue, it clearly pierced through the gray fog, entering the ears of the Profound Mystery True Lord, and seeming to ring in the hearts of Wukong and Xu Yunfan as well.

The Profound Mystery True Lord glanced at the White-Haired True Lord, a hint of wariness in his eyes. With his broad vision, he could naturally tell what state this White-Haired True Lord was in.

But looking at the other party's appearance made the Profound Mystery True Lord feel somewhat suspicious.

In the Taihua Void Realm, there were no more than a dozen True Lords, and he was familiar with every single one. Yet this White-Haired True Lord before him was a new face.

Could he be a Golden Core cultivator hiding in the shadows?

In the Taihua Void Realm, among the 108 Heavenly and Terrestrial Stars Fruits, although most were hidden by the Heavenly Dao and many were taken by True Lords, new cultivation methods inevitably appeared, pointing to the vacant Fruits.

But anyone with such capability could not be some newly promoted True Lord. It was highly likely that an old senior True Lord severed ties with his previous life, sought a new Fruit to prove the Golden Core Dao, and the time must have been long ago for such an environment to be feasible.

The White-Haired True Lord didn't care about the Profound Mystery True Lord's gaze and simply sighed with emotion.

"How many brilliant geniuses have been buried in this Samsara Sea? Today, we shall add the soul of another newly promoted True Lord to it, using a masterless Great Yin Fruit. How marvelous."

He didn't rush to act, instead watching leisurely as the Profound Mystery True Lord manipulated his sword threads in a frantic search.

Feeling the White-Haired True Lord's gaze, the Profound Mystery True Lord let out a cold snort but didn't stop. The way of the sword cultivator was decisive and lethal; hesitation could never establish a school of thought.

His sword threads spread like a spider's web, coldly sweeping over the black reef where Wukong was hiding.

However, the Xuan Jian's simulation of the True Spirit's Nether Realm was extremely perfect. Combined with Wukong's own extreme restraint and his innate talent as a Stone Embryo, the sword threads didn't detect any abnormal energy reaction on the reef, treating it as a dead object and sweeping past.

However, when the sword threads swept further away, they inevitably disturbed more muddled True Souls, causing a silent, chaotic fluctuation.

A barely perceptible sneer flashed in the White-Haired True Lord's eyes, seeming to hold considerable disdain for the Profound Mystery True Lord's crude methods.

He didn't use his spiritual sense for a large-scale scan, as that could easily provoke unknown backlash in the Samsara Sea.

Who knows what strange beasts might emerge from the Blood Sea, causing endless trouble.

He simply raised one hand slowly, fingers spread, his palm aimed at the area where the Profound Mystery True Lord's sword threads were most agitated.

In his palm, a phantom of a miniature, constantly reversing cycle of life and death slowly appeared.

"All spirits return to silence, souls, come back to me!"

A low and eerie incantation sounded.

In an instant, the True Souls in that area, already muddled and fragile, who had been startled by the sword threads, suddenly froze as if called by their most primal instinct.

Then, the last bit of spiritual light remaining on their bodies was forcibly extracted, turning into specks of pale light that, like iron filings attracted to a magnet, frantically surged toward the reversing cycle in the White-Haired True Lord's palm.

These specks of light converged and quickly outlined and manifested before him.

Several vague human-shaped outlines, composed of pure soul power and death energy, were forcibly condensed.

They had no facial features, no consciousness, only the most basic directional presence, like controlled puppets, facing blankly in the various directions pointed by the White-Haired True Lord's hand.

One of these human-shaped outlines was facing directly toward the area of the black reef where Wukong was hiding.

Although it couldn't pinpoint the exact location, the White-Haired True Lord instantly locked onto the general direction by manipulating the instinctive rejection and pointing of the dead souls toward the aura of the living.

"Found you. As a newcomer to the Golden Core, you're bound to leave traces."

A cruel smile of certainty appeared on the White-Haired True Lord's face. His gaze, sharp as lightning, pierced through the gray fog and fixed intently on that area of the reef.

The reversing cycle in his palm flared brightly. The soul-power human shapes let out a silent shriek and instantly transformed into several ashen-white chains of resentful souls, tearing through the gray fog with a piercing whistling sound, and pouncing straight toward Wukong's hiding place.

Wherever the chains passed, even the gray fog and blood waves were stained with a deeper layer of dead silence and decay.

The Profound Mystery True Lord also reacted instantly, letting out a sharp shout.

"Xu Yunfan! Accept your death!"

The hundreds of probing sword threads suddenly retracted, condensing before him into three ic巨刃 (giant blades) so solid they seemed real, capable of cutting space.

The blades hummed, carrying the true meaning of the Xuan枢 (Xuan Pivot) Sword Soul that could freeze souls and break all laws. They arrived later but moved faster, forming a品字形 (品-shaped) formation, carrying a bone-piercing chill and the shriek of tearing space, and slashed fiercely toward that area of the reef.

The crisis of life and death arrived in an instant.

Wukong's molten golden pupils suddenly contracted to the size of pinpricks.

Facing two Golden Core True Lords, one had self-cut his cultivation to enter the Samsara Sea, but the essence of his sword intent remained.

The other was even more unpredictable.

Their joint lethal strike, against this body of his which only had the magic power of a peak Foundation Establishment cultivator and relied on the toughness of the Stone Embryo, was impossible to dodge or block.

"Are you waiting to die? Move!"

Xu Yunfan's urgent voice exploded in Wukong's consciousness.

Almost at the same time, within the main body back at the Divine Thunder Mountain, Xu Yunfan's eyes were filled with a waterfall-like torrent of data.

The 'Strong Control' feature of the Attribute Panel lit up slightly.

Xu Yunfan used this to directly transmit his Divine Thunder magic power without loss.

The Divine Thunder Golden Core in his Dantian trembled violently, and the shadows of ninety-nine紫金 (Purple-Gold) Thunder Dragons roared, wanting to break free.

A majestic and irresistible Divine Thunder True Meaning, ignoring the obstruction of space and the suppression of the Samsara Sea's laws, passed through the Strong Control channel connected by their origin, and instantly poured into Wukong's Stone Embryo body.

"ROAR!"

Wukong no longer concealed his form, unleashing a non-human roar from his mouth. This wasn't his intention; he didn't even want to confront the two Golden Cores face-to-face, but rather a violent outpouring driven by Xu Yunfan's will.

The Stone Embryo body bearing Xu Yunfan's appearance was instantly enveloped in a blinding紫金 (Purple-Gold) lightning.

The Xuan Jian unleashed an unprecedented dark light. The Soul-Stabilizing Pearl spun frantically, and the Indestructible Golden Nature was forcibly activated to protect the core.

"XU YUNFAN!!"

Wukong roared in his heart, but under Xu Yunfan's forced control, he no longer cared about exposing himself. The bones and muscles of the Stone Embryo发出不堪重负的“嘎吱”爆鸣 (let out a 'creaking' groan under unbearable strain), his fists clenched tightly, and the magic power simulated by the Eight Scenery Cloud Qi was instantly assimilated and ignited by the Divine Thunder True Meaning.
