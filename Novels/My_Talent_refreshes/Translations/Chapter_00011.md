# Chapter 11: Cultivating Spells  

Those who hadn't completed Qi Refinement and absorbed spiritual energy remained in the main hall, while Chu Ning and the others were led away.  

They were then divided into groups based on the attributes of the techniques and spells they would practice. The Spirit Plantation group focused on wood-attribute techniques, consisting of five people in total—Chu Ning, Qiu Shunyi, and three others.  

A medium-built, handsome disciple in charge of teaching led the five to an open area behind the training hall before speaking.  

"My name is Shi Yao, a wood-attribute technique instructor in the Transmission Hall, at the ninth level of Qi Refinement."  

As soon as Shi Yao spoke, the five disciples turned their heads in surprise. They had initially thought Shi Yao was unremarkable in presence, never expecting him to be a ninth-level Qi Refinement expert.  

Shi Yao observed their reactions but showed no hint of pride. Instead, he calmly continued,  

"You are all new disciples who have just begun Qi Refinement and condensed spiritual energy, so we’ll start with some basic spells.  

As you’ve likely heard, the three fundamental spells for cultivating spirit plants are the Growth Spell, the Purge Spell, and the Rain Spell. The first two are wood-attribute spells, while the last is water-attribute."  

At this point, one of the three other disciples, Yuan Guang, asked,  

"Senior Brother, since we cultivate the Evergreen Wood Technique, a wood-attribute technique, can we still use water-attribute spells?"  

"Of course," Shi Yao nodded.  

"Our spiritual energy can activate the five elemental forces. Except for high-tier spells or those with stringent energy requirements, most spells can be cast.  

However, spells of the same attribute as your technique will be more compatible, more powerful, and consume less energy.  

The spells I mentioned earlier aren’t particularly difficult. As long as your Evergreen Wood Technique is stable at the first layer and you practice diligently, you can cast them."  

After this explanation, Shi Yao paused and then said,  

"Today, I’ll teach you the Growth Spell first. It’s simpler and will help you understand the Evergreen Wood Technique better."  

With that, he patted a pouch at his waist, and a grain of rice appeared in his hand.  

Chu Ning instinctively glanced at the pouch, while a round-faced female disciple gasped in surprise.  

"Is that a storage pouch?"  

The other three also turned their gazes toward it. In the Spirit Plantation’s lower district, where the disciples were low-level laborers with meager earnings, storage pouches were rare treasures.  

Clearly, none of them had seen one before.  

---  

Shi Yao nodded but didn’t elaborate. Instead, he said,  

"I’ll demonstrate the Growth Spell first, then teach you the incantation and hand seals."  

He tossed the rice grain onto the ground, swiftly formed a series of hand seals, and pointed at it.  

The rice grain quickly sprouted, and within moments, a seedling emerged.  

"The Growth Spell aids in the germination, development, and growth of spirit plants, but it doesn’t alter their quality. This is different from the Evergreen Wood Technique."  

After explaining, Shi Yao began teaching the incantation and hand seals.  

Since he assumed they had only just begun Qi Refinement and had little spiritual energy, he didn’t have them practice the spell immediately. Instead, he had Chu Ning and the others memorize the incantation and practice the hand seals.  

Once everyone had memorized them, he shared insights on cultivating the Evergreen Wood Technique and the Evergreen Wood Spell.  

Chu Ning found the session quite enlightening.  

For instance, Shi Yao mentioned that the Evergreen Wood Spell’s effectiveness would improve as their mastery of the Evergreen Wood Technique deepened.  

However, proficiency in the spell itself was equally crucial. If one could master the Evergreen Wood Spell to perfection, it could become an innate ability, allowing instant casting without hand seals and consuming minimal energy.  

Most other spells followed the same principle.  

Comparing Cao Dongxin’s and his own spellcasting, Chu Ning realized they were still far from achieving such mastery.  

For him, it was understandable—he simply hadn’t practiced long enough.  

But Cao Dongxin had been practicing for decades without reaching that level, proving just how vital talent was in the world of cultivation.  

After the lesson, Shi Yao handed out rice grains to each disciple and dismissed them.  

Chu Ning stood up but didn’t leave immediately. Instead, he approached Shi Yao and bowed respectfully.  

"Senior Brother Shi, could you also teach me the Purge Spell and the Rain Spell?"  

Shi Yao frowned, displeased.  

"You’re Chu Ning, right? You’ve just reached the first layer of Qi Refinement. Right now, your priority should be mastering your technique. One spell is enough—don’t bite off more than you can chew."  

Chu Ning quickly explained, "Senior Brother, you misunderstand. I don’t intend to practice them now—I just want to memorize them for future study.  

My situation is a bit unusual. The senior brother I follow has a peculiar temperament, and our cultivation time is limited. So, I thought I could study spells while doing chores..."  

---  

"Are you following Cao Dongxin?" Shi Yao suddenly asked.  

"Yes," Chu Ning nodded, unsurprised that Shi Yao knew of Cao Dongxin. Given his deep understanding of the Evergreen Wood Technique, he must be familiar with the Spirit Plantation.  

Sure enough, Shi Yao sighed. "I’ve heard of Cao Dongxin’s ways.  

Fine, I’ll teach you. But remember—techniques are the foundation. Stabilizing and advancing your cultivation should be your priority."  

Chu Ning agreed repeatedly.  

Thus, Shi Yao taught him the other two spells.  

Satisfied, Chu Ning left the Transmission Hall and returned to the Spirit Plantation’s lower district.  

His explanation had been half-truth. The real reason was that he knew he would master the Growth Spell and Purge Spell quickly.  

Moreover, his technique had stabilized at the first layer, and in half a month, he might even reach the second layer—giving him the capacity to practice more spells.  

As for the Rain Spell, he wanted to test his aptitude for spells of other attributes.  

Besides, Cao Dongxin had recently assigned him tasks like weeding, which took up much of his time. Mastering the Purge Spell would come in handy.  

When Chu Ning returned to the courtyard, Cao Dongxin was already back. After lunch, Cao Dongxin indeed ordered him to weed the fields.  

Eager to practice his spells, Chu Ning complied without hesitation.  

In the fields, he silently recited the Purge Spell’s key points, then channeled his spiritual energy, locked onto a weed, and cast the spell.  

The weed was instantly uprooted by an unseen force—success on the first try.  

Though he had chosen a sparse patch and his energy control was still rough, the success rate amazed him.  

The innate talent of the Yin Wood Spirit Body for wood-attribute spells was truly remarkable. He wondered how it would fare with higher-tier techniques and spells in the future.  

Next, he tried the Growth Spell—another success on the first attempt.  

Of course, the speed of growth couldn’t compare to Shi Yao’s, but after some time, he still managed to sprout seedlings.  

Now, it was time to test the Rain Spell.
