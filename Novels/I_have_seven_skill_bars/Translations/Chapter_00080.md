# Chapter 80: Special Treatment

Ding Rui allowed his skill to run automatically, then focused wholeheartedly on the condition of the Meridian-Connecting Flower. The precautions had mentioned it: when the stamens of the Meridian-Connecting Flower completely closed together, that was the most suitable state, and at that moment, he should stop the absorption. If it wasn't enough, they wouldn't fully close. If it was too much, the stamens would wither, damaging the entire flower's vitality, neither of which was good.

Ding Rui's eyes widened as he watched the stamens of the Meridian-Connecting Flower slowly tighten, close, and then finally merge completely. Immediately, with a thought, he stopped the skill. As his hand slowly moved away from the Meridian-Connecting Flower's stem, a mass of purple spiritual energy was drawn out. He then released his control over this spiritual energy, allowing it to dissipate directly into the air. Although he could absorb the spiritual energy extracted from the Meridian-Connecting Flower, it would undoubtedly take a lot of time to refine, so abandoning it directly was the most appropriate course of action.

"How could ordinary cultivators achieve such stability?" Jiang She mused. "Whether it's breathing or thinking, it would cause a chain reaction in the body and lead to accidents during absorption. Basically, ordinary cultivators need to be completely focused. Even I am the same. When absorbing the Meridian-Connecting Flower's spiritual energy, I usually have to close my eyes, hold my breath, and concentrate, not daring to be even slightly careless. After absorbing for a short while, I open my eyes again to observe the flower's condition. Yet you seem to not have put much effort into your true essence at all. This is truly... astonishing. Because of the Meridian-Connecting Flower's unique properties, even inner disciples who aren't familiar enough with it wouldn't handle it as excellently as you did." Jiang She shook his head, full of admiration.

"Perhaps my control over true essence is stronger," Ding Rui "guessed" with a feigned air. No matter how peaceful the sect territory was, he absolutely couldn't reveal his skill bar at this moment. He was kind, but not a naive simpleton.

"Haha!" Jiang She laughed heartily, very pleased. "It seems that once the sect's cultivated Meridian-Connecting Flowers reach their blooming period, we'll need your help again. At the very least, until other cultivators are fully accustomed to circulating their true essence within the Meridian-Connecting Flowers, we'll definitely need you to assist." Jiang She spoke with great conviction; it was clearly a conclusion he had considered long ago, and he stated it directly after confirming that Ding Rui could handle the Meridian-Connecting Flowers during their blooming period.

Naturally, Ding Rui had no reason to refuse. He could most efficiently complete the two tasks—loosening soil and absorption—which were incredibly difficult for other cultivators. It was only natural to dedicate most of his energy and time to these. This was how he could maximize his value.

After setting the "overtime" arrangement with Ding Rui, Jiang She left directly. Ding Rui, in turn, first processed all the Meridian-Connecting Flowers that had reached their blooming period, then, after informing Qing Fengxia, also departed, heading straight for the other spirit fields.
