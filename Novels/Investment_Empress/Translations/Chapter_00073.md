# Chapter 73: The Elders: "Why Is Shang Wu So Confident?", Ice Lump's First Battle

"Wind Slash!" A fierce roar echoed.

In the nick of time, Xiao Qin managed to recall his Severed Sword, not only blocking the opponent's blade but also unleashing a surge of abundant internal energy. A pale green wave of internal energy erupted from the Severed Sword, sweeping outwards in a fan shape.

Internal energy projection! This thought popped into many people's minds. Xiao Qin had clearly just broken through. Many martial artists could only achieve this technique in the Jade Liquid Realm. Immediately, gasps of surprise rose from the arena.

On the high platform, the arrogant young man from Burning Jade Forest spoke indifferently. "This Xiao Qin isn't bad, just a bit low on cultivation. He must be one of the top disciples of this generation in Qingyuan Sect."

"An Internal Energy Condensation Realm cultivator at eighteen or nineteen, his talent is already extremely high. Of course, he's still far inferior to you, Yu'er," the Confucian-robed middle-aged man beside him said with a faint smile.

The disciples of Burning Jade Forest showed surprise in their eyes, but not much. Most of those who followed them to Qingyuan Sect had extraordinary backgrounds; to them, Xiao Qin's only commendable trait was his combat talent. The members of the Red Whale Gang, on the other hand, appeared much more excited. Many of them came from the jianghu, appreciating Xiao Qin's fighting spirit, and quite a few cheered him on.

"Wasn't Xiao Qin an outer disciple before?" Qian Bufan had some impression of this youth.

"Yes, he's also a rising star; perhaps he encountered some fortuitous opportunity. He has a good relationship with my grand-disciple Li Mo," Xue Jing said, stroking his beard with a smile.

The elders nodded slightly. Given Xiao Qin's performance, regardless of the outcome of this battle, he was certainly qualified to become a true disciple.

The battle in the arena continued. Little Li, our student, was no longer a martial arts novice. Thanks to bouncing between Ice Lump and Princess Jiang, and his beautiful master's habit of recounting her beatdowns of various people whenever she drank too much, Li Mo had accumulated quite a bit of insight.

Watching the two figures clashing on stage, Li Mo shook his head slightly, saying, "It won't be easy for Old Xiao to win." Old Xiao was only evenly matched with his opponent, who was a realm higher, thanks to his internal energy projection, but this method consumed a huge amount of energy. Xie Ailan was clearly not a fool lacking combat experience; she had already noticed this and began to engage in skirmishes, relying on her excellent movement technique.

Ying Bing withdrew her gaze, lowered her eyes, and sipped her tea. "Three breaths."

No sooner had her voice fallen than, precisely three breaths later, Xiao Qin suddenly released his exertion, his face pale as he cupped his hands and said, "Senior Sister, I admit defeat."

Xie Ailan stopped her movements, not even glancing at her opponent. Without a word, she walked off the stage to meditate alone.

Qian Bufan's booming voice resounded throughout the arena: "Xie Ailan, victor! Xiao Qin, enter the loser's bracket! If you lose your next match, you will be eliminated."

For fairness and impartiality, the Nine Peaks Martial Arts Tournament didn't eliminate someone after a single loss. Two consecutive losses were required to ensure a relatively reasonable outcome. Of course, if one encountered opponents significantly stronger than themselves twice in a row, it could only be considered bad luck.

The first match was so thrilling that the atmosphere instantly grew more fervent. Qian Bufan patted the bronze beast again, and from its ox-mouth, two waist tokens dropped out. "Next match. Inner disciple Lu Bai, against..."

"Ruyi Peak's Lin Jiang!"

This was a battle with no suspense. If one had to describe this match, it would probably be that it truly made everyone realize the gap between inner disciples and true disciples. Lin Jiang's spear struck out like a dragon, his blood energy surging. His opponent used similar moves, but in less than ten exchanges, Lin Jiang swept him off the stage with the shaft of his spear.

After bowing to his opponent, he didn't look at the high platform but instead at where the disciples were seated. Only after seeing that familiar figure did a smile appear on his face.

"Old Lin has made great progress recently too," Li Mo said, meeting his gaze and returning a smile. He had occasionally run into Lin Jiang recently, and they had discussed martial arts issues together. Little Li suddenly felt a surge of emotion. Watching those he had helped shine brightly... it was like the sense of achievement from a nurturing game.

"Lin Jiang wins!" "Next match..."

***

An hour passed. During this time, Murong Xiao also took to the stage once, winning with a great advantage and attracting considerable attention and praise.

"He must be the most brilliant genius of this generation, right?" The arrogant young man from Burning Jade Forest looked eager, as if he had found a worthy opponent. If not for the rules, it seemed he would have wanted to go up and fight him.

"You can go challenge him after the Nine Peaks Martial Arts Tournament," the Confucian-robed middle-aged man said.

The Blood-robed Young Master of the Red Whale Gang had an intrigued glint in his eyes. "A Roaring Flood Dragon Physique? The demonic nature controlled so well? His body is faintly golden, this aura of peace, it's rather like Buddhist martial arts. Interesting..."

The Ziyang Prefectural Lord, seeing his interest, lowered his voice and said, "Young Master, this young man is a Murong family descendant, and he will likely return to the prefectural city."

"Understood." The Blood-robed Young Master nodded faintly. It was strange that he, a disciple of the Red Whale Gang, treated a Prefectural Lord with such casualness.

"Cold Crane has taught a good disciple indeed."

"Murong Xiao truly has extraordinary talent, a superb physique for body refining. If he also has good forging talent, our Qingyuan Sect will produce another grand master."

"The unique aspects of his physique will become even stronger when he reaches the Spirit Observation Realm; that's when he will truly shine."

Listening to the envy of his colleagues, Elder Cold Crane's bark-like face also broke into a smile. Murong Xiao was indeed the disciple most likely to take on his mantle. His luck was truly good...

"Murong Xiao..." "You mean that young man who always tails my precious disciple, calling him 'Brother Li'?" An untimely question came from the Peak Lord of Qunyu Peak.

"Yes, his relationship with my grand-disciple is quite good," Xue Jing also said with a smile.

As disciples of Qingyuan Sect, the elders naturally preferred to see outstanding disciples getting along harmoniously, making it easier for them to work together wholeheartedly when facing future challenges.

The only one not feeling comforted was probably... *Creak*. Old Man Cold Crane's smile froze, and with a squeeze of his hand, he nearly crushed the armrest of his chair. The most outstanding disciple of Divine Weapon Peak was that kid Li Mo's shadow. The divine weapon of Divine Weapon Peak was also in that kid's hands. The more he thought about it, the angrier he became. Wasn't this a kind of...

"Hmph, Junior Niece Shang Wu, it's too early for you to be happy now. This old man knows you bet on Qunyu Peak to be first among all peaks, and I don't know where you get such courage!"

As his words fell, the elders' gazes sharply turned to Shang Wu, their eyes filled with a degree of doubt, essentially conveying: 'We know you're usually scatterbrained, but this is beyond eccentric, isn't it?' 'How dare you?' 'My grand-disciple is still just a child!'

Actually... When Shang Wu finally remembered that Little Bing'er wasn't a Qunyu Peak disciple, she went through three stages: disbelief, then regret, and finally... resignation. Since the outcome couldn't be changed, she would just let it be...

Shang Wu took a casual sip of wine, saying indifferently, "Because I believe in my precious disciple."

The elders: "!"

Why was she so confident? This wasn't like her at all! Everyone knew Shang Wu was greedy for money, never acting without guaranteed profit, yet she dared to place such a heavy bet on her disciple. Could it be... that lone sprout of Qunyu Peak truly had some shocking reliance? Elder Cold Crane fell into deep thought. Could that kid actually... use a divine weapon now?

***

The clashes between martial artists weren't really that flashy; if there was a gap in strength, it was a simple matter to determine the victor. Furthermore, this was a friendly spar between fellow disciples, not a battle to the death. Soon, another match concluded.

Qian Bufan patted the bronze ox again: "Next match. Falling Glow Peak's Xie Ailan, against..."

"Qingyuan Main Peak, Ying Bing!"
