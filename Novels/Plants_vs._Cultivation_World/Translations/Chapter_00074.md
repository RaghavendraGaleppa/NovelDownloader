# Chapter 74: Cleansing Pill Toxins  

"How did you get here?"  

Hu Hai struggled to open his eyes, his gaze shifting between Chu Feifei and Gu Mo. When he noticed Gu Mo's outer disciple robes, he almost thought his weakened state was causing hallucinations.  

"If we hadn't come, would you have died here?" Chu Feifei snapped angrily. "A pill-testing mission with such high risks—how could you be foolish enough to take it?"  

"I couldn't resist the temptation of getting stronger," Hu Hai admitted in a low voice. Earlier, he had received a bottle of cultivation-boosting pills from Yao Shifeng. After taking them, he felt an unprecedented surge in power—an experience he had never known before.  

But the pills ran out quickly, and his cultivation speed returned to its original sluggish pace. Having tasted rapid progress, Hu Hai found it unbearable. Yet, as a mere labor disciple, he couldn’t afford such precious pills.  

In the end, Hu Hai chose to take on pill-testing missions. These tasks offered generous rewards, and the experimental pills contained potent spiritual energy.  

Relying on the energy from these pills, Hu Hai successfully broke through to the second level of Qi Refining. Encouraged by his progress, he took on more pill-testing missions, his cultivation soaring under the surging spiritual energy of the experimental pills.  

But when he reached the third level of Qi Refining, before he could even rejoice in his breakthrough, the accumulated pill toxins lurking in his body erupted violently.  

Without exaggeration, Hu Hai was now a walking vessel of poison, his meridians and bone marrow thoroughly contaminated.  

"Do you want to live?"  

Gu Mo examined Hu Hai’s condition and found no easy solution. The toxins had invaded every part of his body. The only method Gu Mo could think of was using a perfected-level Cleansing Technique to purge them. Whether it would work, however, was uncertain.  

"I want to live."  

Hu Hai lowered his gaze. Even if he survived as a cripple, he still wanted to cling to life.  

"Then grit your teeth and endure."  

With a sharp command, Gu Mo unleashed a supercharged perfected-level Cleansing Technique. Given Hu Hai’s dire state, Gu Mo didn’t bother testing milder frequencies—he went straight for the strongest possible cleansing without killing him.  

Only this intensity could force the toxins out. Of course, the pain would be excruciating, but if Hu Hai wanted to live, he had no choice but to endure.  

"Ah!"  

As the enhanced Cleansing Technique took effect, Hu Hai let out a tortured scream. Yet, he could also feel the toxins being forcibly expelled from his body. Seeing hope, his survival instinct kicked in, and he clenched his teeth, enduring the agony.  

---  

Without exaggeration, Hu Hai was like a piece of blackened cloth being scrubbed violently on a washboard.  

Occasionally, the force was so great that the "cloth" tore, but Gu Mo would immediately follow up with a Minor Restoration Spell to mend the damage.  

After an hour, Gu Mo finally stopped. The perfected-level Cleansing Technique had done its job, purging the toxins from Hu Hai’s flesh and bones. However, the tainted spiritual energy in Hu Hai’s system was beyond Gu Mo’s ability to cleanse—the technique only worked on the physical body.  

Still, at least Hu Hai’s life was saved.  

"Rest well."  

Gu Mo left two catties of Spirit Water Rice and departed with a final reminder.  

"Th-thank you!" Hu Hai’s weak voice followed him.  

"Gu Mo, what you just used was..." Chu Feifei caught up to him, her eyes filled with disbelief. She had reached the proficient level in the Cleansing Technique and recognized it, but she had no idea it could remove pill toxins.  

"The Cleansing Technique. Couldn’t you tell?" Gu Mo chuckled.  

"Of course I knew it was the Cleansing Technique, but yours seemed... different." She rolled her eyes.  

"Oh, that’s just how the perfected-level version works. You’ll understand when you reach that stage." He shrugged. His mastery of the perfected-level technique wasn’t a secret in the Spiritual Planting Hall.  

But Chu Feifei was a labor disciple from the Array Peak, with limited access to information. She had no way of knowing the rumors circulating about Gu Mo in the Spiritual Planting Hall.  

"P-perfected level?!"  

Chu Feifei stared at him in shock. She had poured immense effort into reaching the proficient level, and even the master level seemed like a distant dream.  

Now Gu Mo was claiming he had achieved the perfected level—a realm typically reserved for prodigies, far beyond what ordinary cultivators could attain.  

"Senior Sister Chu, we’ve been looking for you! It’s time to return."  

While Chu Feifei was still reeling from the revelation, a junior sister from the Array Peak hurried over. The inspection of the Alchemy Peak’s formations was complete, and their group needed to leave.  

"Ah—right!"  

Snapping out of her daze, Chu Feifei hastily bid Gu Mo farewell and left with the junior sister.  

"Senior Sister Chu, was that outer disciple someone you know?" the junior sister asked curiously once they were out of earshot.  

For labor disciples, knowing an outer disciple was something worth bragging about.  

"Mhm."  

Chu Feifei nodded absently, her mind still stuck on Gu Mo’s perfected-level technique.  

"Senior Sister, can you introduce me to him sometime? I wouldn’t mind being a junior partner!" the junior sister said eagerly.  

"Let’s go!"  

Chu Feifei shot her an exasperated look. The girl was talented—otherwise, she wouldn’t have been assigned to the formation inspection—but she was also a hopeless romantic, always looking for a powerful senior to latch onto for an easier life.  

---  

A month later, Gu Mo received a message from Hu Hai, inviting him to their old meeting spot in the market.  

Gu Mo didn’t refuse—this might be their last gathering. The chances of meeting again in the future were slim.  

When he arrived at the familiar private room, Hu Hai, Wu Jinfei, and Chu Feifei were already there. Seeing Gu Mo enter, Wu Jinfei instinctively stood up. Clearly, he had already heard about Gu Mo’s promotion to outer disciple.  

Wu Jinfei never expected that the least talented member of their group would achieve such a status. The realization left him awkward—he had always curried favor with Yao Shifeng and paid little attention to Gu Mo. Though they were part of the same circle, their relationship had always been distant.  

Now, trying to ingratiate himself would be far less effective than if he had done so when Gu Mo was still a labor disciple.
