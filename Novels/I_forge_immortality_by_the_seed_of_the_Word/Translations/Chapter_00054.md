# Chapter 54: Accidentally Becoming an Honest Merchant

Three days later, at dusk.

After cheerfully seeing off a junior brother who had come to purchase talismans, Zhang Jing began organizing and counting his dwindling stock.

Perhaps due to people's long-standing grievances against unscrupulous merchants selling low-quality talismans at exorbitant prices, over these three days, Zhang Jing felt he had unwittingly become the most honest talisman merchant in the temporary market. Customers had been streaming into his small shop continuously.

This directly resulted in Zhang Jing nearly selling out his entire stock of talismans—despite his own prices being quite high.

And—

He extended his spiritual sense into his storage bag, 'looking' at the six demon cores inside, an unconscious smile tugging at his lips.

Apart from the demon tiger's core, the remaining five were his harvest from these three days. Two came from third-level Qi Refinement demons, while three were from second-level ones.

Extrapolating from this, he estimated he could collect about fifty demon cores in a month.

A third-level Qi Refinement demon core could earn him around thirty-five Dao merits, while second-level cores fetched slightly less, barely twenty Dao merits each.

Combined with the profits from selling talismans, Zhang Jing was pleasantly surprised to discover that a month's work could net him approximately fifteen hundred Dao merits.

Of course, the actual amount would likely be lower since lower-level demon cores made up the majority. But even so, it would certainly exceed a thousand Dao merits.

His decision to sell talismans in the market had clearly been the right one.

Just as this thought crossed his mind, a figure in a green robe slowly entered the shop.

"Senior brother, are you here for talismans?" Zhang Jing quickly adjusted his expression and asked with a warm smile upon seeing the newcomer.

"So it's junior brother," the man replied with an equally friendly smile. "I just returned and noticed this new talisman shop, so I thought I'd take a look. Don't mind me."

"Please feel free to browse, senior brother," Zhang Jing said graciously.

"Junior brother, I saw a sign outside saying talismans are twenty percent cheaper if paid with demon cores?" the man asked curiously.

Zhang Jing's eyes lit up at this. "Senior brother, are you looking to exchange demon cores for talismans?"

His reaction wasn't unwarranted. While he couldn't determine the man's exact cultivation level, he was certain the man was at least at the mid-stage of Qi Refinement. This meant he might possess demon cores from mid-stage Qi Refinement demons—far more valuable than the early-stage cores Zhang Jing had been collecting.

The higher a demon's cultivation level, the more precious its core. It was said that cores from late-stage Qi Refinement demons could fetch hundreds or even thousands of Dao merits each—a single one could equal Zhang Jing's monthly earnings.

Meeting Zhang Jing's expectant gaze, the man first glanced at the talismans on display before asking disappointedly, "Junior brother, do you only have these low-grade talismans here?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

"Then it can't be helped," the man shook his head. "These low-grade talismans are useless to me. I recently obtained a sixth-level Qi Refinement demon core and saw your sign while passing by, thinking I could get some mid-grade talismans at a discount."

"Damn those talisman masters in the market—they're outright robbing us blind at every opportunity."

Then, as if realizing something, the man looked at Zhang Jing sheepishly. "Ah, junior brother, I'm not referring to you. I mean those other talisman masters. Your prices are higher than the Dao Academy's, but still reasonable—unlike those bastards selling ordinary talismans at premium-grade prices!"

"It's alright, senior brother," Zhang Jing replied with a smile, though inwardly disappointed at the lost opportunity.

A sixth-level Qi Refinement demon core! If he could acquire it, he could purify it with his Crimson Divine Radiance and sell it directly to the Thousand Techniques Pavilion for one hundred eighty Dao merits.

Alas, the senior brother had no use for his low-grade talismans.

Not making this profit felt like a loss—by rough estimation, he might as well have lost a thousand Dao merits. The thought made Zhang Jing's heart ache even more.

Wait!

He expected to break through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement tonight, qualifying him to craft mid-grade talismans. With the Crimson Divine Radiance and the Heart's Eye Dao Seed, Zhang Jing was confident his success rate wouldn't be low.

Perhaps he could—

His face immediately brightened with enthusiasm as he asked solicitously, "Senior brother, how urgently do you need those mid-grade talismans? I can guarantee I'll acquire them, with the same discount for demon cores—if you can wait a few days."

"You're certain?" the man asked in surprise.

"Absolutely certain!" Zhang Jing vowed confidently.

By midnight, in his second-floor room, Zhang Jing, who had been meditating cross-legged on his bed, suddenly opened his eyes, emitting a brilliant white light that illuminated the dark room as bright as day.

A powerful surge of spiritual energy erupted from his body.

Within his dantian, wisps of spiritual energy, under the illumination of the Gathering Origin Spirit Light, gradually coalesced. They eventually condensed into minuscule droplets of liquid spiritual energy, forming a mist that filled his entire dantian and exuded an aura several times stronger than before.

Simultaneously, as the Five Viscera Guiding Water Scripture rapidly circulated, the completely transformed spiritual energy permeated his entire body, bringing about a terrifying metamorphosis far surpassing his previous state.

Fourth level of Qi Refinement!

Mid-stage Qi Refinement!

The first major threshold of Qi Refinement cultivation had been crossed with surprising ease.

As all light faded from his body, Zhang Jing summoned his jade talisman with a thought.

[Five Viscera Guiding Water Scripture - Level 3 (693/800)]
Skill Trait: Five Methods Spirit River (Intermediate)

"Without realizing it, the Five Viscera Guiding Water Scripture is nearing another level," Zhang Jing mused. "The combination of Crimson Divine Radiance and the Heart's Eye Dao Seed is truly formidable—nearly fifty experience points gained from a single day's cultivation, more than double before."

"Moreover, it seems the experience gained increases slightly as my cultivation advances!"

He exhaled deeply, suppressing his excitement as he rose and entered his talisman-crafting chamber.

Focusing his mind and steadying his breath, he began tracing Dao patterns.

Before long, he gently set down his spirit brush, a trace of excitement appearing on his face.

In his palm, he held two ethereal source talismans—their previously incomplete sections now perfectly restored!

Meanwhile, in another room, lights burned brightly as a group of talisman masters argued heatedly.

"I say we find a mid-stage Qi Refinement rogue cultivator to quietly eliminate him, then silence the rogue afterward," one talisman master said viciously. "In just three days, my talisman sales have dropped by twenty percent. How can this continue?"

"No," another countered. "We're all disciples of the Dao Academy. That's going too far."

"Also, have you forgotten where his shop is located? And from my observations, he seems quite familiar with Senior Brother He from the Spirit Pill Pavilion next door."

"Do you know what that means?"

"Fool! It means he's likely a member of one of those three elite teams, or at least affiliated with one of the top ten major squads. Go ahead and try if you want to die—see if they won't investigate thoroughly when something happens."

"Then what should we do?"

"Listen," an elderly talisman master seated at the head of the group suddenly spoke up. "There's actually a perfect solution to this."

All eyes turned to him expectantly.

Seeing this, the elder smiled smugly and said slowly, "You've all lost your heads. He sells premium-quality talismans, which undoubtedly cost him more to produce—and he's working alone!"

"You mean we should lower our prices?" someone asked.

"Exactly!" the elder replied with a 'the student has learned' expression, brimming with confidence. 

"Cut prices directly! While our talismans may not match his in quality, lowering prices will suffice. Facing demons, practitioners will naturally choose with their wallets when prices are right."

"Meanwhile, with his higher costs, he won't dare match our price cuts."

"Soon, with no customers, his business will collapse, and he'll have no choice but to slink away from the market in disgrace."
