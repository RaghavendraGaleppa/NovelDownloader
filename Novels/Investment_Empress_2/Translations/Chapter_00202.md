# Chapter 202: The Sign of a Wife-Boosting Husband? The Troublesome Star Has Been Found!

The woman's voice was ethereal and indistinct, seeming to fade in and out of hearing.

Following the sound, a female figure could be vaguely discerned.

Ying Bing's delicate eyebrows moved slightly, her expression remaining as calm as ever.

She had once only believed that fate was in her own hands.

However, in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, there truly exist miraculous and profound divination techniques.

Thus, she simply adopted an attitude of "believing is having, not believing is nothing."

Li Mo looked at the figure in the distance, his heart stirring slightly.

He wasn't actually interested in fortune-telling.

After all, he had long possessed the Eye of Providence, but it couldn't see his own destiny.

The main reason was that after the incident with Senior Brother Ouyang, he couldn't help but be on high alert.

Anyway, this place was very close to Sword City...

Princess Jiang Chulong's grayish-white eyes blinked, and for some reason, her delicate little ears turned slightly red.

Marriage fate should...

Also be something that can be calculated, right?

"Shall we go take a look?"

Li Mo asked.

The Ice Cube remained noncommittal, while Jiang Chulong nodded eagerly.

The three of them walked into the pavilion.

Only then did they discover that this so-called fortune-teller was actually a young woman.

Her clothing was simple yet exquisite, and her appearance couldn't be called exceptionally beautiful—above average, at best—but her eyes were particularly deep.

Besides a cloth banner that read "Immortal Guiding the Way," she had a full set of other fortune-telling tools.

"Miss, you are quite different from the fortune-tellers I imagined."

Li Mo sat down on a small stool.

"Mortals peering into the secrets of heaven do indeed have difficulty escaping the Five Calamities and Three Deficiencies."

The woman smiled faintly, not refuting him.

She didn't look at Ying Bing or Jiang Chulong, instead staring straight at Li Mo. A profound light flashed in her eyes before quickly dimming.

"Palm reading, face reading, or the Eight Characters of one's birth hour, young master. What would you like to calculate?"

"Palm reading."

Li Mo casually extended his hand.

The woman nodded slightly, took his hand, and lowered her eyes to examine it.

At that moment.

The light of the Eye of Providence flashed briefly in Li Mo's eyes.

[Name: Tian Miao]
[Age: 21]
[Constitution: Heluo Peculiar Body]
[Realm: Ninth Heaven of Divine Perception]
[Destiny: Golden-Gray]
[Evaluation: A wandering disciple of the contemporary Heavenly Calculation Sect, third on the Hidden Dragon List, a genius who cultivates the "Divine Book of Heavenly Evolution," yet his entire cultivation level originates from 'Destiny'.]
[Recent Events: Ordered by the contemporary sect leader of the Heavenly Calculation Sect to descend the mountain and find the 'Troublesome Star' that is disturbing the heavenly secrets. She no longer dares to use her Heavenly Eye Technique casually, so she took a fortune-teller's stall this morning, planning to return it later.]

Troublesome Star?
A wandering disciple of the Heavenly Calculation Sect?

Li Mo was momentarily stunned. He hadn't expected this woman to have such a background.

He couldn't see his own fate.

Could she possibly窥探 a glimpse of it?

"The lines are not deep and are chaotic. Your fate should be plagued by many disasters and illnesses."

"From your Heaven, Earth, and Human lines, you should have been born into a well-off family, but your financial luck is insufficient, and it will be hard for you to have a good end..."

Listening to her words.

Li Mo looked at his system space, his emotions quite stable.

This calculation didn't seem very accurate either.

"This person..."

Ying Bing's gaze moved slightly, as if she recognized this woman.

What she said coincided perfectly with what Ying Bing had seen in her previous life.

But it was completely at odds with this lifetime.

"Ah?"

Jiang Chulong was immediately alarmed, anxiously saying:
"This... how could this be... how could it be like this?"

The woman shook her head gently, her gaze softening as she looked at Jiang Chulong before saying:
"I only learned this face-reading technique this morning, so it might not be accurate."

"Shall I... take a look at the young master's face instead?"

Li Mo: "..."

A wandering disciple of the Heavenly Calculation Sect, who just learned face-reading this morning. How novel.

Oh, and all the face-reading gear was borrowed from another fortune-teller this morning. That explains it.

"Alright, let's take a look then."

"Okay."

The woman moved a little closer, looking at his face.

"Your Heaven's Palace is full but not plump, which is a sign of having fortune but no life..."

She said several things in a row.

---

None of it was particularly pleasant to hear.

Halfway through, she stopped herself, looking quite strange.

"Don't I have any good points?"

"You do."

"That's better... what aspect is good?"

"You are a wife-boosting husband."

"..."

Little Li fell into deep thought.

Is that such a niche thing?

Ying Bing: "?"

Do you even hear what you're saying?

Jiang Chulong: "!!!"

So Big Brother Li really is... is indeed that thing... what was it... a treasure boy?

That was an adjective her teacher taught her, but she wasn't sure if it was appropriate...

"Are you sure you didn't misread?"

Li Mo was speechless for a moment.

He almost wanted to ask if she had read her divination book upside down.

The woman shook her head: "It's true. That's all I saw on you."

She paused, then added:
"You're not just wife-boosting, it's not the ordinary kind."

"How wife-boosting?"

"Marrying you, one could consider waiting a few years to wear the yellow robe."

"...Does that make sense?"

Li Mo didn't know whether to laugh or cry.

The woman nodded: "My skills are probably not up to par, so I won't charge you."

At that moment.

The morning bell of Hengyun Sword City rang.

Li Mo got up and still took out a silver note.

Then the three of them walked back into the misty rain.

"Big Brother Li... you're so amazing."

"Wearing the yellow robe is amazing?"

"Of course... only the Emperor does... does..."

Jiang Chulong's voice grew smaller and smaller as she spoke, as if remembering something sad.

Li Mo thought for a moment and said:
"Chulong, those who are followed by lavish meals every day and wear the yellow robe aren't necessarily emperors."

"Ah? Really?"

With just a couple of sentences, Li Mo made the easily amused Princess Jiang's cloudy mood turn sunny.

Watching the少年 who was chatting eloquently, spouting nonsense like a comedian.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes slightly:
"Wife-boosting..."

.......

In the solitary pavilion.

Tian Miao frowned and took a book from her sleeve, which clearly read:

*The Ma Yi Divination Classic*

Although it wasn't as domineering as the *Divine Calculation of Heavenly Evolution*, it was by no means ordinary.

An ancestor of the Heavenly Calculation Sect once used this divine calculation technique to discern the potential of the Martial Emperor when he was still in obscurity.

Although she had just learned it, she had already mastered the *Divine Calculation of Heavenly Evolution*, so she wouldn't learn it messily.

"Did I calculate it wrong..."

"In that case, how should I report to the sect for the next Hidden Dragon List?"

The Hidden Dragon List only looks at combat records.

But besides combat records, it also附上 many distinguishing characteristics or strengths, so that the various realms of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands can understand this genius.

Is Li Mo's characteristic... being a wife-boosting husband?

After a moment of silence.

She finally made up her mind.

Her eyes flickered with a profound light, as if piercing through layers of clouds and mist to see the three people who hadn't gone far.

"Pfft~~~"

It took several seconds.

She then staggered to her feet.

She took out a special jade slip for the pavilion, dipped her brush in the blood she had just spat out, which hadn't yet dried.

She认真地 bent over the desk and wrote the first line.

*'The Troublesome Star has been found. Awaiting the Master's decision.'*

Only then did she begin to write about the other information for the Hidden Dragon List.

The new issue of the Hidden Dragon List is coming out soon.

Not just Yunzhou, many people across the world are looking forward to it...
