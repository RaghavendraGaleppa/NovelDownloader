# Chapter 219: Sudden Calamity, the Lady is Wounded

Heaven bestowed its blessing. Golden rain and sweet dew fell from the ninth heaven. The Flood Dragon’s body underwent a transformation, washing away the serpentine stench of rolling in the mud.

It danced in the air, roaming between the clouds and mist. Sometimes it plunged into the sea, other times it pierced through the clouds.

It traveled forty-nine thousand miles along the Benhua River. The martial experts attending the Dragon Appreciation Banquet along the riverbanks immediately felt it, their faces beaming with joy.

“It’s done! It’s done! Senior Old Dragon has successfully ascended!”

“All our efforts were not in vain. Excellent, truly excellent. The world has gained another dragon beast, and we shall reap the benefits.”

“It’s a pity we couldn’t see the dragon’s body with our own eyes. The legends say the dragon’s form possesses a unique beauty. A single glance can enhance one’s comprehension and improve one’s aptitude.”

On both banks of the river, the assembled heroes cheered. The “dishes” at each banquet were finally served. The benefits were boundless, broadening everyone’s horizons.

Qi Kaiyan, Chang Kun, and Zhu Butong each received a share of the dragon’s shed skin and obtained the Earth Yellow Essence Treasure. Their culinary repertoire had another entry.

Zhu Butong practiced the “Golden Blade Earth Flood Dragon,” and his martial arts took a great leap forward, his strength increasing by another level.

At the river’s mouth.

As the golden rain fell from the heavens, Li Xian bathed in the dragon’s essence. A cool sensation washed through his body, his hair fluttering as if wrapped in a layer of golden light.

\[You have bathed in the dragon’s essence. The digestion of精华 (essence) is accelerated. Culinary Art proficiency +3.\]

Li Xian’s strength was immense. Seizing this opportunity, his physical body became as powerful as a dragon. His stamina seemed endless, and he wished he could plunge into the sea and swim to his heart’s content.

The Flood Dragon shed the character for “Flood” (Mang) and took on the character for “Dragon” (Long). It originally had no name, and the martial artists of the Jianghu respectfully called it “Senior Old Dragon.” Now, soaring into the sea, it gave itself a name.

It called itself Ao Mo.

Li Xian said, “Senior Ao, may your path be smooth. Congratulations.”

Ao Mo gradually adapted to its dragon body and landed on the shore, its hind legs touching the ground, its dragon form standing tall and proud. “Brother Li, I thank you for your good fortune!”

Li Xian’s heart raced with excitement. A year ago, he was struggling in the snow and wind. A year later, he was exchanging pleasantries with a celestial dragon beast. Though it was merely a title of respect, it felt truly marvelous.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, “Xiao Xian, with such a rare opportunity, why don’t you take a good look?”

“What opportunity?” Li Xian asked.

Wen Caishang replied, “As the saying goes, a divine dragon is seen only by its head, not its tail. When Senior Ao Mo was still a Flood Dragon, you could see its head and tail. Now that it has become a Dragon Flood Dragon, it roams the universe and soars between heaven and earth. After today, it will be difficult to see it again.”

“This dragon’s form, appearance, and body—you must engrave it in your heart. In the future, when you practice dragon-type martial arts, such as the ‘Dragon Claw Hand’ or the ‘Heavenly Dragon Palm,’ having seen a true dragon will give you a significant advantage over those who have not.”

“This is a one-time opportunity. Why don’t you thank the Senior?”

Li Xian was astonished. “Senior Ao, would it be alright if I look at you a few more times?”

Ao Mo nodded. “Your Lady is correct. I am returning to the great sea. Whether we meet again depends on luck. If it can be of help to you, what’s the harm in looking a few more times?”

Li Xian immediately approached and gently stroked the dragon scales. The sensation was strange, very smooth, a mix of warmth and slickness. When tapped lightly, they produced a sound like jade.

“What a dragon body. The previous Flood Dragon form had a distinct, foul odor. Now, I can’t smell it at all. When the Flood Dragon was ascending, it exerted all its strength to stir the waves, which was its limit. Now, Senior Ao Mo, with a single挥 of its claw, could likely summon waves upon waves.”

Li Xian observed the dragon’s tail,探 its dragon breath, held its dragon claw, and tugged its dragon whiskers. He memorized the dragon’s form and appearance, touching it all over. Fortunately, Ao Mo was old, its ferocity and viciousness long since ground away, allowing Li Xian to observe without provoking any anger.

Ao Mo said, “This place is quite far. I have just become a Dragon Flood Dragon, and Heaven has granted me the stamina to roam the world. Why don’t I carry you two for a while?”

Wen Caishang said, “That is exactly what I was thinking.”

Even a celestial Dragon Flood Dragon cannot roam freely at will. Soaring high in the sky requires stamina and is not an easy task. Roaming on land, if its stamina is depleted, it must enter a river to rest.

If the river is shallow and narrow, the Dragon Flood Dragon could run aground. There is also the risk of being slaughtered. Ao Mo had just become a Dragon Flood Dragon, blessed by Heaven, with stamina that seemed endless, allowing it to adapt to the feeling of soaring through the world.

There was no need to worry about stamina.

Carrying them back was the best option.

Li Xian climbed onto the dragon’s body and grabbed its mane. Wen Caishang stood gracefully, her feet as if they had suction cups, remaining completely still despite the dragon’s turbulent flight.

Ao Mo laughed, “Hold on tight!” The dragon’s body trembled, its tail whipped, and it flew into the clouds and mist, plunging headfirst into the clouds.

Li Xian felt an immediate chill and circulated his internal energy to protect his body. He opened his mouth to speak, but the howling wind and clouds灌入 his mouth, forcing the words back down his throat.

“Senior Ao Mo, please fly lower. Xiao Xian wants to see the scenery below.” Wen Caishang’s clothes fluttered, her long hair flying. She ignored the fierce wind, her words soft and slow.

Ao Mo immediately flew lower. Emerging from the clouds, they could look down and see human towns, their lights dim, very bustling.

Li Xian said, “Outside the towns, it’s all darkness. This boundless realm holds so many more wonders.”

“Naturally,” Wen Caishang said. “The Great Wu Dynasty’s territory is vast. But the lands inhabited by humans make up less than thirty percent.”

“Less than thirty percent?” Li Xian exclaimed in surprise.

Wen Caishang said, “It’s even less than twenty percent. These matters, when the time is right, you will naturally come to know.”

Li Xian glanced toward the southwest.

Suddenly, he saw a towering mountain, piercing the heavens, majestic and imposing, with an indescribable charm. He asked, “Lady, what mountain is that?”

“It’s Mount Su!” Ao Mo said. “The divine peak that connects to the heavens under the sky. The legends say it supports the heavens and the earth.”

Ao Mo lowered its body further, allowing them to see the scenery along the riverbanks.

Someone below shouted, “Is that Senior Old Dragon? If it is, please roar back twice!”

Ao Mo moved its dragon body and roared back twice in response. The attendees of the Dragon Appreciation Banquet below all shouted excitedly, their expressions fervent.

Along the way, the attendees of the hundred-mile, thousand-mile, and ten-thousand-mile banquets... their faces were flushed with excitement, their joy难以言表. They saw Li Xian and Wen Caishang and were filled with envy.

After a moment.

Ao Mo lowered its body a little more. Wen Caishang thought to herself: “I have窃取 the Earth Essence. I wonder what effect this has on this old dragon. It keeps lowering its body; its stamina must be failing. We are still within the Yu’nan Province. If we enter the Longxiong Province and its stamina is depleted, the rest of the journey will be very long.”

Wen Caishang said, “Senior Ao Mo, I find the scenery here quite nice. I wish to visit a friend. Let us down here.”

Ao Mo did not know the details but did feel its stamina gradually weakening. Soaring through the world was not an easy task. It knew it couldn’t send them all the way back to Dragon Claw Town and was worried about how to bring it up without losing face.

Hearing Wen Caishang’s words, it was naturally delighted and quickly said, “What a pity, what a pity. I was willing to carry you further. Since that is the case, so be it.”

They landed in a forest in the wild. Ao Mo said, “Brother Li, Wen Caishang, let us part here.” It turned and sped toward the horizon.

Li Xian watched it go, from now on, the sky was high and the sea was wide. It was truly a divine dragon seen only by its head, not its tail. He couldn’t help but think: “A man should be like a soaring dragon, roaming the world, how exhilarating. But... Senior Old Dragon cultivated for hundreds of years. I witnessed firsthand the many dangers before its transformation. If one wishes to be carefree, one must first accumulate and find stability!”

With his feet on solid ground, his heart was also steady.

Wen Caishang said, “Was the dragon beautiful?”

“Not a fraction as beautiful as you, my Lady.” Li Xian asked casually, “By the way, Lady, whose friend are we visiting?”

Wen Caishang walked forward gracefully, a fragrant breeze drifting from her. She said nonchalantly, “I have no friends in this area. I only said that because I saw the old dragon was exhausted and didn’t want to tire it further.”

Li Xian said, “We are still very far from the Qiong Tian Mansion. Without a white cloud, we’ll have to walk for a long time. Why not let Senior Ao Mo carry us a bit further?”

“Moreover, I heard Senior Li Bohou say that many forces wish to oppose you.”

Wen Caishang thought: “If I hadn’t窃取 the Earth Essence, I would have made that old dragon carry me back to the One Union Manor. But since I have the Earth Essence, it’s best to part ways with the old dragon early. Although the journey is long, it’s a good opportunity to lie low.”

She said, “No need for the trouble. A longer journey means you can accompany me longer. What, are you unwilling? If those insignificant pests truly dare to oppose me, I’ll kill them with a single sword. It’ll be much quieter.”

Li Xian said, “Of course, I am willing.” He went to support the Lady. “Lady, on this journey, you truly displayed your divine might. It was so brilliant, I couldn’t help but applaud several times.”

“You cheeky boy,” Wen Caishang chided gently. “What’s so great about that? You must know that rivers vary in length, and dragons vary in strength. The path of ascension, in the end, is a process for a Flood Dragon to accumulate momentum and break through its shackles.”

“The Benhua River is forty-nine thousand miles long, but it only flows through two provinces, Yu’nan and Longxiong. The heroic spirit and the spirit of the talented are not enough.”

Li Xian asked, “Are there even grander ascensions?”

The two walked side by side. The forest here was quiet, but the small path was often trodden. Wen Caishang’s voice was melodious. “Naturally.”

She taught him, “Historical records mention grand ascensions where the dragon游经 a top-tier city of an entire province or region. Such places gather the essence of the land and the heroes of the age... Imagine how magnificent that would be.”

“Even more so, if a great river flows through the capital of a nation, the momentum it accumulates would be immeasurably vast.”

Li Xian said, “Lady, you are truly a living history book.”

Wen Caishang was taken aback, realizing Li Xian was praising her knowledge as profound. She said, “If you learn more and see more, your knowledge will naturally grow.”

“Setting other things aside, among the prodigies of the Qiong Tian Mansion, who has witnessed a Flood Dragon’s ascension? Hmm... there are some interesting characters in the Qiong Tian Mansion.”

She thought of Gu Nianjun.

It was now late at night. Wen Caishang had been on a boat for several days, with no chance to change her clothes. They were damp yet dry, very uncomfortable.

Seeing an inn along the way, she knocked on the door and booked two superior rooms. Li Xian carried his luggage tightly on his back, with plenty of money.

Li Xian ordered some meat and vegetables and ate on the first floor. Wen Caishang went straight upstairs, sat elegantly, and with a turn of her sleeve, a celestial treasure box appeared in her hand.

She opened the lid.

The blood-stained heart scale glowed with a golden-red light, its bloodiness turning into a fragrance. The blood on the scale seemed to squirm.

A sprout gradually emerged. Its shape resembled a dragon body, fierce and aggressive. The sprout was merely a sign, not yet fully formed.

The seventy-two Earth Essences are incredibly precious. Each one that appears in the world必引 a great conflict. It is rare to see even one in a hundred or several hundred years.

Wen Caishang had窃取 an Earth Essence. This was no different from stealing half of Ao Mo’s dragon life. That’s why, after just transforming into a dragon, it should have been able to roam the world with endless stamina, but instead, it ran out of energy early. Who knows how long it will take to recover.

Wen Caishang said, “This object harms the natural order and attracts misfortune. This matter is ethereal; it may or may not be true. But we must be careful.”

She closed the treasure box, her brows slightly furrowed, sensing an ill omen. In her time in the Jianghu, she had faced many strong and skilled opponents, and many dangerous and perilous situations.

Now that matters were temporarily settled, she had great gains, having窃取 an Earth Essence. She should have felt relaxed and joyful. Yet, upon seeing the Earth Essence, her mood sank, feeling very unwell.

In the next instant, a flash of lightning.

Li Xian was eating when he heard a deafening “rumble.” He said, “What a thunderclap. Could it be that someone nearby is also transforming into a dragon?”

He smelled the scent of scorched wood, frowned, and rushed upstairs. He saw the Lady’s guest room had been struck by lightning, blackened.

Li Xian shouted, “Lady? Lady?”

“What is it?” Wen Caishang remained calm.

Li Xian said, “I’m glad you’re alright. This room...”

Wen Caishang said, “The matter of heavenly lightning is hard to explain. It’s not the innkeeper’s fault. Please pay for another room for me.”

Li Xian said, “Alright!” He immediately booked another superior room.

Wen Caishang moved to the other room, gently closing the bolt.

Her face was pale, her willow-like brows tightly furrowed.

She coughed lightly and spat out a mouthful of blood.
