Chapter 323: The Missing Wife, The True Name Revealed, It Is Li Xian! The Target of All Arrows

Zhou Shijie slashed a stone with his sword and said contemptuously, "Just a flower thief, what's so powerful about him? Can he block a single strike from me in my presence?"

Yang Wentian, Wang Dezhong, and Zhou Shijie had met at the temple fair, drinking, playing, and feasting together. In the past, they were in high spirits, each showing their talents. Above, the sects formed alliances; below, peers sparred, made friends, and hunted together. How joyous and lively it was. Looking back on it later, it would surely be deeply moving. But in just a few days, everything had changed. Senior and junior sisters, as well as female elders, had all gone missing. Their hearts were shrouded in gloom, suppressing their anger.

Yang Wentian came from the "Thunder Gate," neither a swordsman nor having lost any relatives, so he was more rational. After spending time together, he knew that Zhou Shijie's martial prowess was slightly inferior, and said, "Brother Zhou, don't be anxious. This thief comes from the Flower Cage Sect, but it's said he truly has some skill! You must not underestimate him!"

Wang Dezhong said, "It's said this thief is unbelievably handsome, and his strength is naturally not weak. He is skilled in spear techniques, clever and cautious, with a continuous stream of vicious schemes."

Li Xian cursed inwardly, "That bastard thief, talking nonsense. This huge black pot is being dumped right on my head. When have I ever used vicious schemes?" Feeling extremely wronged, he continued to listen.

Yang Wentian said, "This thief is highly valued by his sect. Though he is young, about the same age as us... if we encounter him, we must be extremely cautious. Remember not to be careless. The Flower Cage Sect does not kill women. Presumably, Miss Gu, the many senior and junior sisters, and the elders... are all safe. Now the city is sealed for a strict investigation. Although we don't know where the Flower Cage bandits have hidden them, they definitely haven't left the city. There is still a chance to turn things around."

Hearing the two's advice, Zhou Shijie felt his face burning with embarrassment. He thought, "Fine, I considered you two friends, yet you look down on me like this. Can I, Zhou Shijie, really not deal with a mere flower thief?" He angrily sheathed his sword but said no more.

After chatting for a while longer, Yang Wentian and Wang Dezhong bid farewell and left the Jade Bamboo Residence. Zhou Shijie snorted coldly, lost in thought for a moment, feeling anxious. Suddenly, he had an idea: "If Nianjun is in trouble, and I happen to play the hero to save the beauty, wouldn't I be able to win back her heart? Nianjun has been absent-minded lately, her heart full of that Zhou Ping'an. If this continues, she'd rather give herself to him, where does that leave me? Whether this is a blessing or a curse is still undetermined."

Filled with excitement, he ran out of the Jade Bamboo Residence. Catching up to Yang Wentian and Wang Dezhong, he decided to help with the search. Yang Wentian and Wang Dezhong were both delighted and readily agreed.

Li Xian revealed his form, his brow furrowed deeply. He knew there was something very suspicious about this. He recalled that Gu Nianjun's boots were stained with golden mud, as if she had stepped into a tomb's cache. But how could Hua Wucuo, trapped in the Cocoon Pavilion, display such great power and capture all the female relatives of the various sects?

As he was pondering this, he suddenly felt something strange. A long strand of his hair, having taken root on the ground, had sensed something. Extending his perception, he seemed to hear a message: "Wucuo, Wucuo... where are you? If you hear this message, come meet me quickly!"

Recognizing the voice as Ye Cheng's summons, Li Xian weighed his options: "Though I haven't shown my face, Hua Wucuo's name has already been spread. Sister Liu Li is still in the Flower Cage Sect, so it's really hard for me to stay out of it. The recent turmoil is related to the Flower Cage Sect. I don't know if Gu Nianjun and the others were captured by them. If that's the case, considering our friendship, I need to help them escape. Whether I advance or retreat, I need to meet them!"

He observed the surroundings through the hair strand. It seemed to be in a mansion's hall, brightly lit. Several figures were around the hair, though blurry, he could vaguely make out who they were.

There were Ye Cheng, An Weicheng, Tang Wenshu, Li Jiu, and other elders, as well as many disciples with floral imprints... An Weicheng asked, "Jin Yi, did your Brother Hua really say that? As long as this hair touches the ground and takes root, you can hear his voice?"

Jin Yi scratched his head and said, "Yes... yes." Tang Wenshu said, "This Hua Wucuo is truly not to be underestimated. I wonder what kind of martial art he practices to be able to do such a thing."

Ye Cheng said in a deep voice, "This is not the time to discuss this. Wucuo, if you can hear this, come quickly to 'Flowing Flower Street, Farewell to Spring Garden' in the west of the city. We have important matters to discuss!"

Hearing the conversation, Li Xian took off his mask, hid the Red Bow, and headed west. He soon found the Farewell to Spring Garden. He didn't rush in but used his Double Pupils to observe the surroundings. Confirming it was safe, he vaulted over the wall into the courtyard and joined the elders and the Flower Cage Sect.

Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others were overjoyed to see Li Xian again and immediately walked behind him, signaling that they considered Li Xian their leader and stood their ground. Ye Cheng couldn't help but sigh with emotion: "This child has only been in the sect for a few months and already has such presence."

Li Xian cupped his hands and said, "Elders! Fellow brothers! We meet again."

An Weicheng said, "Good, good, come inside and talk in detail. This matter concerns life and death, not a single bit of carelessness can be afforded." Li Xian said in a deep voice, "Good!"

Each took their seat in the hall. Li Jiu said in a deep voice, "Wucuo, although you entered through the Water Altar, you are a rare talent of the Flower Cage Sect. Young and vigorous, it's hard to avoid being high-profile, but your actions this time were truly excessive!"

Tang Wenshu shook his head and said, "Commander Shi intended to support you, to make you famous, to gather all the flower thieves under heaven. Yet you were so high-profile that things got out of control. This is truly inappropriate, truly inappropriate."

Li Xian understood in his heart: "There must be a misunderstanding among these elders about me. I should ask." He asked in surprise, "This junior does not know, what exactly was excessive?"

An Weicheng said, "Wucuo, the purpose of our trip is to fish in troubled waters, not to stir up conflict. The situation wasn't chaotic yet, but you went and did such a big thing, shocking the world and making the Flower Cage Sect the target of all arrows. Now the city defenses are tight, and it's hard for us to escape. You've captured so many female relatives, making it even harder to get away. Have you thought about what to do next?"

"Truly inappropriate, truly inappropriate."

Li Xian said in a deep voice, "Do the elders think that the many missing female relatives were captured by Wucuo's scheme?"

All the elders were taken aback. Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others looked at each other in bewilderment, finding it even stranger. Ye Cheng asked in confusion, "Wasn't it you? After you parted ways with them, the rumors spread that the many female relatives had suddenly gone missing. Wasn't it you who used a clever scheme to capture them silently? Thinking about it, although we are elders, in matters of capturing women and beauties, we might not be as good as you, a new talent." He looked at Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others.

It turned out this was a huge misunderstanding. On the day Li Xian was preparing to attend the banquet, as a backup plan, he had Jin Yi, Huo Er, Tu San, Shui Si, and Mu Wu of the Five Elements Flower Formation seek out the Flower Cage Sect to regroup. He actually intended to secretly borrow the power of the Flower Cage Sect to save himself. But Li Xian was captured by Wen Caishang, and could no longer send out any news.

Having no perception of the outside world, he spent his days with the Twin Swords combined, hiding his sword in its sheath. Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others did indeed find Ye Cheng and the rest. They had gathered not long before hearing of the major incident in the city—the unexplained disappearance of the many female relatives from the Five Swords Sects.

Ye Cheng and the others were immediately suspicious that it was the work of their own sect members. They immediately exchanged letters to inquire about the truth. All replied that they knew nothing. At this time, Jin Yi, Huo Er, and the others all thought: "Since it wasn't the elders, could it be Brother Hua? He left us and immediately went to do such a big thing. The timing is too coincidental."

So they brought up Hua Wucuo. Ye Cheng, An Weicheng, Tang Wenshu, and the other elders, although a level higher than Li Xian, had long been corrupted by wine and women, and their abilities might not be as good as Li Xian's. They all felt Li Xian was extraordinary and might really be able to use a clever scheme to capture and abduct the women of the various sects.

There were implicit rumors within the Flower Cage Sect. Ye Cheng, An Weicheng, Tang Wenshu, and the others thus convened a meeting of the elders to discuss this matter. They tried to notify Li Xian, which led to this scene. Li Xian explained the situation clearly, and the elders looked at each other, all filled with shock and suspicion.

Ye Cheng said, "Wucuo, this really wasn't your doing? If it was you, we wouldn't blame you. Release the many female relatives, and we will use the chaos to escape. Preserving our lives is the priority. We must not lose the greater good for the sake of the small and die here."

Li Xian said with a wry smile, "I came here precisely to ask about this matter. I thought it was the elders of our sect who had captured the women of the various sects."

Ye Cheng shook his head and said, "How could we have such ability? I haven't used my martial arts in a long time. I rely on numbers and formations to capture lone women. If the number of enemies increases, I would surely protect myself and flee."

An Weicheng said, "Yes, our original intention in coming here was to fish in troubled waters. We were hiding in the city, waiting for an opportunity. But before the opportunity came, this unexpected incident occurred."

Li Xian asked, "It seems there is more to this matter. We need to investigate clearly. Elders, the situation is very dangerous, please be careful in your actions."

Tang Wenshu said, "Fortunately, we are experienced in hiding our tracks and concealing our movements, so we shouldn't leave any flaws."

Li Xian thought: "Things have escalated to this point, and I'm caught in a dilemma. It's hard to clear my name no matter what. I've had good luck recently, stumbling upon precious treasures several times. Now my bad luck has followed right after, all coming at once." He said, "Not necessarily. I've heard that a disciple of the Flower Cage Sect has been captured and has given up a list of the elders."

Everyone looked at each other and fell silent for a moment. Ye Cheng said calmly, "It's just a list, it's not a big deal. This matter is strange and unpredictable, with no clues. All elders must be self-respecting. The matters of stealing and nurturing flowers must be put on hold for now."

Li Xian raised his hand and stroked it, and several strands of long hair appeared in his palm. He tossed them to the elders and said, "Wucuo's hair has a special property. When it touches the ground and takes root, it can transmit sounds. If the elders encounter any situation, you can let the hair take root and inform Wucuo of the situation."

Ye Cheng was startled: "What a skill, what a skill! I recall that in the second realm of martial arts, the fourth characteristic is 'Dust Settles,' which allows one's fallen hair to touch the ground and take root. Is your characteristic different?"

Li Xian smiled without speaking. The elders hid the hair strands and looked at each other. Suddenly, they said in unison, "Wucuo. We just discussed it and feel that although you are young, your abilities are profound. We are decades older than you, and our cultivation realm is higher than yours, but we're afraid we are not your match. You have this unique ability, you should make full use of it. How about... we entrust the command to you?"

Li Xian was taken aback. Ye Cheng smiled and said, "Wucuo, you are already a disciple of the Candle Cult. Purely as a disciple of the Flower Cage Sect, it might be insufficient to command so many elders and disciples. But since you are now a disciple of the Candle Cult, it's different."

Li Xian thought to himself: "I only wish to mind my own business, return to the Water Altar, take Sister Liu Li away, and get rid of all entanglements. However... the current situation, the current state of affairs, makes it a fantasy to leave without getting involved. Perhaps taking the initiative to join the planning might offer a glimmer of hope." He then said, "This junior is flattered, I wouldn't dare to command. But if the elders have any instructions, you can inform me at any time through the hair strands."

The elders nodded and smiled. They all left separately. Li Xian returned to the inn, his head full of confusion. He carefully reviewed the events of the day. Hua Wucuo was wanted by the Five Great Sword Sects, his white face and red bow were known throughout the city, and Wen Caishang was paying attention to him.

Li Xian's appearance was very handsome. He figured it wouldn't be long before wanted posters were issued. Wolves in front, tigers behind, deep waters and scorching fires. This scene is truly hard to describe. Li Xian forced himself to be calm, pacing back and forth, temporarily without a good plan. He could only first clarify the situation and then seek a change.

The elders of the Flower Cage Sect truly lacked the ability to lead. Years of being corrupted by wine and women had long lost their sharpness, they sought pleasure and got by as best they could. They were unfit for great tasks, so they all placed their hopes on Li Xian to take command. Each elder hid in various businesses under the guise of merchants, temporarily without any flaws.

Following this investigation, they secretly looked into the cause. It turned out that the women had disappeared at the same time. On that day, the Five Swords met to discuss an alliance. Many wandering martial artists, aristocratic families, and the city lord He Wentian were present to witness the grand event.

The "Sword-Casting Elder" Xiao Wanjian of Yang Mountain Sword Sect, the "Peaceful Sword Elder" Hou Yuande of Jiu Mountain Sword Sect, the "Stable Sword Elder" Hu Yueyue of Hu Mountain Sword Sect, the "Inherited Sword Elder" Wang Zongheng of Yue Mountain Sword Sect, and the "Law Enforcement Elder" Duan Yixin of Li Mountain Sword Sect.

The leading elders of the various sects met, a rare and grand event in the martial world, with an extremely harmonious atmosphere. The five elders swore a blood oath, and the alliance was successfully formed. The Solution Worry Tower hosted this grand event, and City Lord He set off firecrackers, making the night in the city as bright as day.

Li Xian, trapped in the cocoon, was completely unaware. After the Five Swords Alliance was complete, the sects took the opportunity to enhance their relationships and organized a sparring banquet. The younger generation displayed their power and showed their talents. Those in their teens, twenties, and thirties all made their appearances, how lively it was.

The Hu Mountain Sword Sect was composed entirely of women, their sword techniques were subtle, and their personalities were shy. They were too embarrassed to show off their sword techniques. An elder suggested setting up another venue for a "Dragon and Phoenix Grand Banquet." The women would go to the Phoenix Banquet, and the men to the Dragon Banquet. They would each display their talents, and then the dragon and phoenix would harmonize, to see which was more outstanding, the dragon or the phoenix.

The elders all nodded in agreement: "This Dragon and Phoenix Banquet will spark a competition between the dragon and phoenix, breaking down the barriers between sects. The men will be like brothers, the women like sisters. The competition between the two will create more sparks, and perhaps some beautiful stories will emerge."

They readily agreed and split into two banquets, Dragon and Phoenix, to break down sect barriers. The Dragon Banquet was extremely lively, with brothers of all ages exchanging ideas and comparing the strengths and weaknesses of their sects' sword techniques. The Phoenix Banquet was filled with the chatter of women, their laughter as sweet as spring. The shy female disciples, seeing only sisters, also dared to open their hearts and blend in.

They waited until the mood was high, then would hold a joint Dragon and Phoenix Banquet, with the dragon and phoenix competing, which would surely be a great event. It would not only make the five sects as close as siblings but could also create a few perfect couples. However, as the mood grew even higher, the laughter and chatter at the Phoenix Banquet gradually subsided.

By the time the people at the Dragon Banquet realized it and went to check on the Phoenix Banquet, only the lingering fragrance of perfume remained, not a trace of a person was to be found. They searched all around, but found no clues. Everyone was baffled. By rights, although the Phoenix Banquet was for women, there were no lack of heroines among them; how could they disappear so easily?

Everyone searched in a daze. A day passed before they learned that the female relatives of the various sects had indeed gone missing. Later, suspecting it was the work of the Flower Cage Sect, they joined with City Lord He to seal the city and aggressively search for the Flower Cage bandits.

Li Xian, having figured out the whole story, knew it wasn't the work of the Flower Cage Sect. Thinking of Wen Caishang's evaluation of He Wentian, he suddenly thought: "The disappearance of the female relatives must be related to City Lord He. It's very likely his doing. Unfortunately, the Flower Cage Sect has a bad reputation, and this black pot is stuck firmly on us. Even if we explain, no one will believe it. Ouch... this black pot has fallen on my head."

"That City Lord He has quite a reputation, and doesn't seem like someone who would cause trouble out of lust. This matter is not easy to handle."

At a complete loss, half a day passed. Li Xian, figuring his face hadn't been seen yet, went out onto the street to observe. From time to time, he heard the thundering of hooves as sword sect disciples and city soldiers patrolled the streets, with tight defenses. Li Xian was passing through a busy market when he suddenly heard the sound of a bronze gong, and the crowd gathered towards the bulletin board.

Li Xian followed the flow and saw two soldiers pasting portraits in front of the bulletin board. There were seven or eight of them, wanted posters for Ye Cheng, An Weicheng, Tang Wenshu, Li Jiu, Li Xian, and the others. Li Xian's portrait was the most eye-catching. His face was only about forty percent similar to Li Xian's; common brushwork and vulgar ink couldn't capture the charm, but it was still extremely handsome. The red mole between his eyebrows was a distinct feature.

It turned out... a disciple of the Flower Cage Sect had been captured. Under torture, he had provided portraits of the Flower Cage Sect members. The portraits of Ye Cheng, An Weicheng, and the others were only thirty to forty percent similar and were not easy to recognize. Li Xian's features were distinct and could be identified at a glance.

In front of the bulletin board, a group of sword sect disciples gathered, spitting at the portraits and cursing: "If I catch these evil thieves, I'll刮了 them alive." "这群奸贼,尽行贼恶勾当,生是蛆虫,死是奸鬼.但愿上天有眼,降下雷电,劈他们形神俱灭." "No, no, that's too cheap for them. I'll pull out their tendons and peel their skin, but leave them with one breath, so they have to beg on the streets, enduring everyone's curses."

Li Xian ignored them and thought to himself: "They're moving fast. Fortunately, at the Spirit Fox Banquet, I didn't take off my mask. But now my reputation is ruined. Well, a worldly, mediocre reputation is useless. I just need to be true to myself and have a clear conscience."

He heard ordinary people and wandering martial artists cursing without end: "That young man is so handsome, how can he be so evil, doing such wicked deeds." "They say a person's appearance reflects their heart, but this is an exception. This kid has a human face but a beast's heart, he really should be killed." "City Lord He is heroic and outstanding, he will never let the bandits escape. When this thief is caught, his head will surely fall."

Li Xian thought: "The common people are ignorant and don't know the whole story. It's normal for them to curse me. I'm entangled with the Flower Cage Sect, so I should have expected to be cursed. It's fine, let them curse if they want." He glanced sideways to observe the surroundings. There were dozens of sword sect disciples and wandering martial artists. If he left now, it might arouse suspicion. He needed to wait a while for the crowd to disperse.

He watched for a while longer when he suddenly heard a few shouts of "Giddy-up!" In the distance, Zhou Shijie, Wang Dezhong, Yang Wentian, and Hua Wu arrived on horseback. The crowd buzzed with surprise and made way. Zhou Shijie leaped up, using light footwork, stepped on people's heads to cross the crowd, and landed in front of the bulletin board.

Wang Dezhong, Yang Wentian, and Hua Wu dismounted, quickly walked through the crowd, and followed closely. Zhou Shijie let out an "Ah!", his eyes fixed on Li Xian's portrait, feeling incredibly unbelievable. He steadied himself and looked again, his expression strange and indescribable.

Wang Dezhong asked, "Brother Zhou, this thief is Hua Wucuo. Our sect's many senior and junior sisters, and even the elders, were most likely captured by this thief!"

Zhou Shijie asked, "Hua Wucuo?" Yang Wentian asked, "Brother Zhou, have you noticed something suspicious?" Zhou Shijie was silent for a moment, then a slight smile appeared at the corner of his mouth. He said, "There is indeed something suspicious. It's wrong, it's all wrong. This thief is not Hua Wucuo."

All the sword sect disciples, wandering martial artists, ordinary people, and patrolling guards looked over. Zhou Shijie smiled and said, "This thief has a red mole between his eyebrows and a handsome face. If these two points are correct, then he is not Hua Wucuo. His real name is 'Li Xian'!"

Yang Wentian asked, "Is Brother Zhou very familiar with this person?" Zhou Shijie smiled and said, "Of course. To be honest, this thief and I are half fellow-townsmen. I studied at the Qiong Tian Prefecture Academy since I was young, and he is also from Qingning County in Qiong Tian."

Wang Dezhong hurriedly asked, "Brother Zhou, since you say he is Li Xian, why did he use the alias Hua Wucuo? Could you be mistaken? It's just a coincidence that their appearances are similar. Brother Zhou, this concerns someone's reputation, you must be extremely careful."

Zhou Shijie felt very displeased. He甩袖 (flicked his sleeve) and snorted coldly, saying淡淡ly (calmly), "If Brother Wang thinks my Zhou's words are insignificant and not credible, then I need not waste my breath." He made a move to leave.

Wang Dezhong quickly apologized, saying, "Brother Zhou, a misunderstanding, a misunderstanding." Yang Wentian said, "Brother Zhou, Brother Wang absolutely did not mean that. Please tell us in detail. If it's true, capturing this thief will be a great contribution! If Miss Nianjun can be saved, she will surely remember your kindness and look at you with new eyes!"

Zhou Shijie felt a thrill all over and said, "Good. This thief's original name is Li Xian, and he is from Qiong Tian. Don't be fooled by his handsome face; this person's nature is extremely evil. He has a title called 'Evil Captain.' He was originally a martial captain in Qingning County, recruiting power, oppressing the common people, tyrannizing the countryside, and scraping the flesh and blood of the people. He was truly wicked to the extreme. For a character like this to reach this point, I'm not surprised at all."

He glanced at Wang Dezhong and continued, "If any of you don't believe me, you can go to the prefecture city and check. The name 'Evil Captain' is widely known. My Zhou Shijie's luck may be faint, but I'm not one to talk nonsense."

His words were firm and convincing. Everyone believed him and joined in the denunciation, cursing him to the extreme. Zhou Shijie said, "This person originally had a slight connection with an extremely powerful figure. Unfortunately, his talent was extremely poor and was driven away from that person's side. I think this thief, having committed so many evil deeds, was greatly affected by this and joined the Flower Cage Sect. The Flower Cage Sect is a den of filth, the best place for such villains. Thinking about it now, it's not surprising."

Wang Dezhong thought to himself: "From Brother Zhou's words, there's a hidden resentment. But it seems to be true."

Zhou Shijie said confidently, "This thief is as cunning as a fox and very insidious, but his strength is very average. I have fought this kid before, and my strength surpasses his by several levels. If we meet, I can definitely capture him alive."

Yang Wentian and Wang Dezhong exchanged a glance, both feeling a vague sense of impropriety. But seeing Zhou Shijie's extreme confidence, interrupting his words would damage his pride and make the friendship impure. Li Xian hid in the crowd, secretly finding it funny. He thought: "If we meet again, I'd really like to test our abilities to see who is superior."

The crowd dispersed, and Li Xian sneaked back to the inn, frowning incessantly. Now his identity was exposed. Wen Caishang had lost track of him, but with her strategic mind and martial arts, she should be safe, right? Gu Nianjun and Zhou Shijie didn't attend the Dragon and Phoenix Banquet. Gu Nianjun's disappearance is thought-provoking.

It's a tangled mess, all disturbing his mind. All kinds of dangers and perils point to him alone. Li Xian drew his Green Sword and practiced the "Setting Sun Waning Blood Sword," breathing with the "Xun Wind Breath." As he practiced his sword moves, he thought of strategies to break the situation. Not long after, the name "Li Xian" spread throughout Flying Dragon City, and it was the talk of the town.

Li Xian usually hid his tracks, which was already quite cautious and thorough. Unfortunately, his appearance was distinctive, and the red mole was not easy to conceal. Once revealed, it was unforgettable. The innkeeper who had once shared snow beast meat with him had hurriedly reported him to the authorities. Li Xian had just escaped the cocoon room and entered another dangerous situation. Truly, one wave hasn't settled, another rises.

Flying Dragon City decided to capture Li Xian first, to boost their prestige and morale, and then to step up the search, not letting a single flower thief go. The Flying Feather General of Flying Dragon City, "Yang Xinqiang," even declared that he would capture Li Xian alive within three days.
