# Chapter 143-144: The Celestial Bone-Stealing Demon Manual? The Liuren Alchemy Golden Tome?

"How is this possible? That serpent's 'Dao-Sealing Mark' specifically suppresses human cultivators' foundations. With your foundation sealed, you should have lost all your magic power. How can you still wield your sword seal?"  

In the underwater palace, the old turtle, in its original form, was desperately refining pills to restore its demonic energy. Though the battle between Gu Yuan and the snake-tailed youth seemed prolonged, it had actually lasted only a few breaths. The old turtle, already exhausted from being relentlessly pursued by Gu Yuan, had no time to recover in such a short span. At this moment, it didn’t even have the energy to shapeshift into human form.  

With the death of the serpent, the old turtle was terrified and cried out in panic.  

"Clang!"  

The only response was a dazzling sword light.  

A bamboo-like sword shadow, resembling a golden lightning bolt, pierced through layers of water and slashed toward the old turtle's neck.  

Depleted of energy, its demonic power dried up, and its protective shell already shattered by the sharp sword seals, the old turtle had no means left to resist. It could only beg for mercy:  

"No, no! Spare me, spare me! I have a golden seal to offer!"  

"A golden seal—an Immortal Golden Seal!"  

The sword light halted. Eighteen golden rays pierced the old turtle's body but remained poised, not yet shredding its flesh.  

Though wracked with excruciating pain, the old turtle was still alive—its life now entirely in Gu Yuan's hands. A single thought from him, and the sword energy would reduce it to mincemeat.  

The old turtle's expression darkened, realizing it had no chance of turning the tables. But recalling the treasure seal within its belly, a glimmer of hope flickered, and it pleaded in a low voice:  

"I bear no grudge against you and have never provoked Qingfeng Dao Academy. But since things have come to this, I won’t waste words. I’m willing to surrender the seal—only, I beg you to spare my life, seeing as I’ve never committed any evil!"  

Its voice was pitiful, filled with desperate pleas, but Gu Yuan remained unmoved. With a mere thought, the sword energy vibrated sharply, sending the old turtle into spasms of agony.  

"Stop the sword energy! I’ll give you the seal!"  

Trembling in pain, the old turtle finally understood the cold ruthlessness of the man before it and dared not delay. It opened its mouth and spat out a cyan treasure seal.  

The seal was no larger than a palm, jade-green in color, engraved with images of a roc and a swimming fish, exuding an ethereal aura as if it might soar into the heavens at any moment.  

But what caught Gu Yuan’s attention most was the strand of golden light shimmering on the seal.  

This golden radiance was dazzling, carrying an ancient and indestructible aura, as if it would never fade.  

However, one corner of the seal was missing—as if cleaved off by some sharp weapon, the break smooth as a mirror.  

This missing piece had not only severed part of the seal but also cut off the strand of immortal golden essence, greatly diminishing the seal’s spiritual brilliance. Though it still retained a trace of its ethereal nature, it was no longer whole.  

"This seal is called the 'Biyou Sky-Soaring Seal.' It was left behind by some deceased Golden Core cultivator, but its power has been greatly weakened due to the missing piece. Still, within a hundred zhang near any body of water, it allows instantaneous teleportation—a marvelous treasure for escape and evasion."  

"I offer this seal to you in exchange for my life—"  

The old turtle pleaded again as it spat out the seal.  

"Clang!"  

But the dazzling sword light hummed sharply, instantly shredding the old turtle’s body before it could finish its plea.  

Only a bloody mist remained in the underwater palace.  

To seize another’s treasure was akin to the hatred of killing one’s father. Since Gu Yuan intended to claim this seal, he could never allow the old turtle to live. The reason he had held back the sword energy earlier was because the words "golden seal" had struck a chord in him.  

Having refined the Three Hearts Golden Seal before, Gu Yuan knew that absorbing a golden seal was no easy task. It was the remnant of a Golden Core cultivator’s essence, containing unfathomable power.  

Without the proper refining method, it was impossible to forcibly absorb such a seal below the Golden Core realm. Hence, he had temporarily spared the old turtle’s life.  

But this seal before him, though indeed a relic of a Golden Core cultivator, had lost most of its golden essence due to the missing piece. It no longer required a special method—only prolonged refinement over time.  

In that case, why waste words? Why leave behind a potential threat?  

Between humans and demons, in the battlefield of survival, there were no innocents. Had Gu Yuan died here today, he would have borne no resentment.  

"Buzz!"  

With the old turtle’s death, the Biyou Sky-Soaring Seal trembled violently, as if losing its source of power, and fell to the ground. Not only that, all its radiance and spiritual essence vanished. The inscriptions and patterns disappeared, leaving the seal looking like an ordinary, unremarkable stone, dull and lifeless on the palace floor.  

"Truly befitting a golden seal. Even with its golden essence severed, it can still conceal its divinity to protect itself."  

Gu Yuan sighed in admiration before summoning the seal into his sleeve with a wave of his magic power.  

Despite his touch, the Biyou Sky-Soaring Seal remained inert, showing no sign of spiritual activity, as if it were truly just a mundane rock.  

For now, Gu Yuan did not attempt to refine it. Instead, he turned his attention to the corpse of the snake-tailed youth and the jade-green serpent seal lying nearby.  

Within the seal, the faint spirit of a green serpent wailed mournfully.  

This seal was the spiritual artifact the snake-tailed youth had used to suppress Gu Yuan’s Seven-Phase Exquisite Pagoda. With the youth’s death, the serpent spirit, now uncontrolled, had retreated into the seal, hissing in distress.  

"Hmm?"  

Gu Yuan picked up the seal with his magic power, and as soon as it touched his hand, a vague stream of information flowed into his mind.  

"This isn’t an offensive spiritual artifact—it’s the seal of this underwater palace!"  

After sensing its nature, Gu Yuan felt slightly disappointed.  

This underwater palace was called the "Spirit Jade Water Mansion," constructed by some great aquatic demon, with a late-stage Earth Demon green serpent spirit imprisoned as its guardian. Whoever held the seal could control the mansion and the serpent spirit.  

But the mansion was immobile, and the serpent spirit couldn’t leave its confines. For Gu Yuan, this was somewhat redundant.  

Still, once the Dao Academy fully conquered this place, it might prove useful. He stowed the seal away and proceeded deeper into the palace.  

His goal here wasn’t to slay the serpent but to obtain the opportunity that could enhance his cultivation.  

The underwater palace wasn’t vast—more of a dwelling than a fortress—but it was lavishly adorned with pearls, jade, coral, and agate, illuminating the space brilliantly.  

At the deepest part of the palace stood a bedchamber crafted from white jade. On a jade table within, a golden booklet lay spread open, its pages shimmering with golden light.  

Gu Yuan knew at once—this was the opportunity he sought.  

After scanning the area with his divine sense to confirm no danger, he cautiously entered the chamber and approached the table.  

"Celestial Bone-Stealing Demon Manual!"  

The golden booklet bore flowing, luminous characters that seemed to shift like light itself.  

"Whoosh!"  

Yet the moment Gu Yuan glanced at it, the booklet abruptly snapped shut without any prompting. Then, just as suddenly, it reopened—but this time, the contents were entirely different.  

"Liuren Alchemy Golden Tome!"
