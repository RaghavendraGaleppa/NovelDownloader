# Chapter 39: The Method of Treatment

Mang Biao and his group were quite powerful, flying at an astonishing speed. Soaring tens of thousands of feet high, they weaved through the clouds and mist, the landscape below changing rapidly. Before long, they arrived a thousand miles away.

At this moment, Mang Biao stopped in mid-air, parting the clouds before him, looked down, and laughed heartily, "Haha, little brother, below is Black Wind Island. From now on, this will be your home."

Yang Ji followed his gaze and saw a picturesque island with undulating mountains, dense green forests, and beautiful scenery where mountains met the sea—truly an excellent treasure land.

"Come, let's go down." Mang Biao laughed heartily, draped an arm around Yang Ji's shoulder, and vanished into the grand hall on the island.

"Bring out the wine, set the banquet, and welcome the Second Island Master!" Mang Biao roared, his voice echoing throughout the hall.

"Second Island Master?" The cultivators inside the hall who had never seen Yang Ji immediately whispered among themselves, curiously glancing at him a few times before accepting their orders and getting busy.

By the time night fell, the Black Wind Grand Hall was filled with long tables, and everyone had gathered. Spiritual fruits, meat dishes, and fine wine were all in abundance. There were even eight female cultivators dancing in the sky outside the hall to entertain.

Bathed in moonlight, they looked like celestial maidens. Their dance was light and ethereal, skirts fluttering; their pearl ornaments spun, shaking like constellations. Graceful and enchanting, they moved like floating orchids. Their long silk sashes swayed, their dance was exquisite, and colorful auspicious light shimmered, truly captivating.

The leading dancer was exceptionally beautiful. Every smile and frown of hers was heart-stirring, both innocent and alluring. Her body seemed boneless, delicate and graceful. After dancing in the sky, she stepped on a gentle breeze and slowly flew into the hall, flashing a charming smile at Yang Ji. The white silk sash she was dancing with floated towards him, gently covering his face.

As he breathed, Yang Ji felt a faint fragrance assault his nostrils, shooting straight to his crown, instantly making his blood surge. Just as he was in a daze, the white silk sash slowly slid down, revealing an astonishingly beautiful face, now close to him, with a smile that could charm all beings. Their noses were less than half an inch apart, their breaths audible. Those enchanting red lips, that fair skin, those pure yet seductive flowing eyes—all were too tempting.

Before one could properly observe, the woman withdrew as quickly as she approached. With a faint smile, she turned and flew away, leaving behind only a beautiful and mysterious back, inspiring endless reverie.

"Who is she?" Yang Ji touched his nose, where the faint fragrance still lingered, and asked curiously, glancing to the side. He found everyone in the hall, including Mang Biao sitting beside him, staring at the departing figure with Ximen Qing's unique smirk, large characters of [LUST] hovering over their heads.

Yang Ji looked at them with disdain, and Mang Biao's next words only deepened his contempt.

"Ahem, she, ah, she's the chief courtesan of Hundred Flowers Island, Fairy Huayu. I spent a fortune to invite her for a dance to welcome you, little brother," Mang Biao said, grinning broadly at Yang Ji. "Little brother, you can look, but don't get any other ideas."

Hearing this, Yang Ji couldn't help but secretly glance at him askance. His own desires had almost burst forth, yet Mang Biao was telling him not to get any ideas. Though women were beautiful, to Yang Ji, they were merely obstacles on the path to immortality. Perhaps after achieving immortality and longevity, he could consider finding a few celestial maidens to play with. Heavenly maidens, he mused, would probably be even more beautiful and softer.

As Yang Ji was thinking this, Mang Biao suddenly draped his arm around his shoulder, raised his cup, and shouted to the crowd below:

"This gentleman beside me will be our Black Wind Island's Second Island Master from now on! Come, call him Second Island Master!"

"Huh? Are you all mute, damn it? My little brother is an Alchemy Master! If you disrespect him, you won't get any pills to eat in the future!" Mang Biao roared when he saw the silent crowd.

"Alchemy Master?" Everyone was startled, their furrowed brows immediately relaxed, replaced by expressions of pleasant surprise.

"Come on, everyone raise your cups and toast the Second Island Master!" Mang Biao called out.

"To the Second Island Master!" Everyone raised their cups, shouted in unison, and toasted Yang Ji.

Seated at the head, Yang Ji couldn't help but feel a little depressed. This Mang Biao was truly imposing his will, effectively cornering him. Was he trying to emulate Zhang Fei's gentle persuasion to win over Yan Yan? However, with everyone raising their cups, he could only brace himself and raise his own, smiling calmly, "You're too kind, brothers."

"Come, drink this cup of wine, and the Second Island Master will be one of us!" Mang Biao laughed heartily, being the first to drain his cup.

Everyone looked at Yang Ji with their cups raised, and Yang Ji had no choice but to gulp down his drink.

"Haha, good!" Mang Biao said when he saw everyone drink their wine. "Tonight, everyone drink heartily, eat heartily, and get drunk until you drop!"

Mang Biao chuckled twice, then lowered his voice and turned to Yang Ji, "Little brother, ever since I heard from Golden Abacus that your alchemy skills are even better than Chang Yuan's, my admiration for you has been like a surging river, ceaseless. I truly wished to meet you immediately and share a drink."

"So, today, I brought people myself to personally invite you, little brother."

"Ahem, I'm a rough man, I've been mixed up in gangs since I was young, and even after embarking on cultivation, I haven't gained any celestial aura. Please forgive any previous inappropriate words, little brother, please forgive me."

"This cup, I toast to you, little brother. I'll drink it all. If you can't hold your liquor, please feel free to take it easy."

Mang Biao raised a cup of wine and immediately downed it. Yang Ji also raised his cup, acknowledging the gesture.

Mang Biao was extremely enthusiastic, pouring out his heart, cup after cup, until he was tipsy late at night. Only then did he lower his voice and say to Yang Ji, "Little brother, you said earlier that I was about to suffer cultivation deviation? Is it that serious?"

"As a Golden Core Perfected Being, you must understand your own condition better than I do. The demonic energy erosion is severe and difficult to reverse. You should know the consequences," Yang Ji said calmly.

The calmer his tone, the more solemn Mang Biao's heart became. He said, "Little brother, do you have a solution?"

"Cultivation is a serious matter. If problems arise, you wouldn't be able to sit still. You must have sought help, right?" Yang Ji looked at him.

"I secretly consulted several medical masters and many alchemy masters. They all said that the true qi in my body is too impure and the demonic energy is too strong, and there are only three ways to solve it."

"The first method is to disperse my cultivation and re-cultivate, but how could I do that? Wouldn't that be destroying my own foundation?"

"The second method is to refine my true qi, little by little, to purify the demonic energy. This method seems feasible, but the cultivation technique I practice doesn't have such an ability. It simply cannot refine the demonic energy that is almost integrated with my true qi. I'm almost a half-demon."

"The third method is to ask an Alchemy Grandmaster to refine a Demon Dissolution Pill. However, the materials for this pill are hard to find, and I haven't found them yet. Moreover, that Alchemy Grandmaster doesn't even spare me a glance. It's truly difficult."

Mang Biao looked troubled, his brows deeply furrowed. He could only look at Yang Ji and pleaded, "Little brother, you said you have a way. Please help me. This elder brother will be eternally grateful."

"There is a way, but..." Yang Ji glanced at Mang Biao, truly not wanting to give him an easy deal. Because the solution involved using the demonic energy in Mang Biao's body as a medicinal primer, combined with the essence of Demon Companion Grass, to refine a unique Demonic Origin Pill. This operation would not only eliminate the demonic energy in his body but also advance his cultivation.

The obstacle lay in the massive true qi within Mang Biao. The true qi of a Golden Core Perfected Being was the essence obtained from countless purifications and crystallizations of spiritual energy. Every wisp contained infinite cultivation, and every wisp of true qi could transform into a spiritual sea. If one were to refine it wisp by wisp using alchemy methods, it would take an unknown amount of time and be too consuming of time and energy.

Presumably, those alchemy masters hadn't thought of such a method, it was just too difficult. Refining a single furnace of Demonic Origin Pills already required great mental effort, let alone refining and purifying all the true qi in a Golden Core Perfected Being's body, which was like an abyss or a sea. Unless it was for a close relative, who would be willing?

Those alchemy masters were not foolish; knowing it was impossible, they did not mention such a method. Yang Ji, however, was different. With his Golden Finger, his alchemy skills were almost supernatural. Refining the Demonic Origin Pill was like mass production on an assembly line; not only would there be no errors, but the speed would also be incredibly fast.

However, Yang Ji would not be foolish enough to reveal that his alchemy skills had reached such a level. At present, he merely vaguely told Mang Biao the general method, without explicitly stating it was an alternative way of refining the Demonic Origin Pill. The more mysterious, the better. He didn't want Mang Biao to recover too quickly, yet he had to give him some benefits to ensure his own safety.

Upon hearing that there was indeed a way, Mang Biao was overjoyed. Seeing his expression, Yang Ji immediately struck while the iron was hot and offered to treat him once. Mang Biao, hearing this, eagerly pulled him into the secret room behind the main hall.

Yang Ji had him draw out a wisp of true qi and then began refining a unique Demonic Origin Pill with various methods to purify his true qi. A full day passed, and Yang Ji, sweating profusely and pale, completed this first treatment. Of course, this was all an act for Mang Biao.

Mang Biao now looked at the purified wisp of true qi within his body and was overjoyed. He immediately grabbed Yang Ji and expressed his gratitude profusely, even personally wiping the sweat from his forehead.

Yang Ji glanced at him, calmly pulling his hand away, and said, "Treating your condition requires a large amount of Demon Companion Grass."

"Treating my condition requires a large amount of Demon Companion Grass?" Mang Biao was stunned upon hearing this, then suddenly slapped his forehead, his eyes lighting up. "That's right! Demon Companion Grass can dissolve demonic energy. Little brother, were you just using this method?"

"Don't worry about the Demon Companion Grass, little brother. This elder brother will go find it himself," Mang Biao patted his chest and said.

"This treatment method is particularly taxing on one's mind. I will treat you once a month. During this period, you must not consume any more inferior Demonic Origin Pills," Yang Ji looked up and stated.

"This elder brother understands," Mang Biao nodded excitedly, then eagerly offered to wipe Yang Ji's forehead with a handkerchief again.

"Very well, then prepare the Demon Companion Grass. The more, the better, and the older the年份, the better," Yang Ji pulled his hand away, his expression subtly shifting, and said.

"Good, good, good!" Mang Biao readily agreed.

Yang Ji hummed lightly, effectively soothing Mang Biao.
