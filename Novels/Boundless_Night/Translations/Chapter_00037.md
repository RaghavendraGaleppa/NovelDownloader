# Chapter 37: Grand Discovery

Qin Ming was very familiar with this area. He immediately found a pile of rubble in the snow, picked up a similar long, strip-shaped stone, broke it forcefully, threw it into the previous area, and then quickly disappeared into the dense forest.

He estimated that only young newcomers like him, driven by curiosity, would rush over to take a look. The old-timers wouldn't stop at all because the stone shell of the mysterious item was useless. The most important thing was that the item the woman in green took out was too dazzling. It couldn't be hidden or concealed; it instantly illuminated the entire night sky. All the high-level anomalous beings and members of large organizations followed her in pursuit. With rare treasures in sight, who would want a useless rock? Even though the woman in green decisively absorbed that mysterious item, her glabella was still glowing, like a guiding beacon.

After some time, sure enough, people came looking for the discarded stone shell. This was the outer region of the mountain; there were no experts here. The old-timers and young adults were all active in areas with special nodes. A moment later, six or seven newcomers actually started fighting over the broken, strip-shaped stone.

This time, although Qin Ming's expression was very calm, his heart was a little stirred. After all, the "scrap material" he picked up came from the most mysterious item in the mountain. A spectacle like a ten-colored pillar of light piercing the sky was unheard of, not even recorded in books, especially since it had also merged with the five-colored mist. He estimated that the large organizations and high-level beings who hadn't arrived earlier would be regretting it bitterly now. All parties had previously agreed that the Heavenly Radiance that descended two years ago was the dimmest in this area, believing it wouldn't be a fertile land, and was destined to be barren of resources. But now, Black and White Mountain had actually "exploded" with treasures! In particular, this might involve another kind of Heavenly Radiance accumulated two hundred years ago; even the higher-ups in the royal capital would likely lose sleep if they knew. Back then, they had mobilized a large force, only to gain very little, so enraged that they wanted to level the mountains here. Clearly, within a few days, the name of Black and White Mountain, which had been silent for many years, would once again spread throughout the many brilliant cities within the night mist.

Standing in the dense forest, Qin Ming crushed the half-piece of stone that showed no fluctuations. As expected, there was nothing inside. He held the other half-piece of stone, somewhat hesitant, because the commotion caused by the "main material" was too terrifying. Even if the scrap material was far inferior, he guessed it wouldn't be ordinary. Forget about any spectacular phenomena appearing; even a single "streaking fire" here could probably ignite the entire dense forest. After all, the shallow night had ended. Under such a deep, ink-like darkness, any slight anomaly would appear extraordinarily conspicuous.

Soon after, Qin Ming walked out of the dense forest, still following his old rule, leaving that half-piece of stone in the mountain. He was not in a hurry; he calmed himself down, planning to wait until this storm had fully brewed. The most mysterious item from Black and White Mountain was destined to be a hot topic for everyone, shaking all directions, while everything else would be insignificant. In fact, the most mysterious item had already ignited the night sky, and all parties were intercepting the woman in green. High-level anomalous beings had already shed blood.

"Faster!" urged the woman in the black fur cloak. She stood on the back of a huge black bird, her tall figure glowing, shielding them from the wind and snow.

The purple-eyed raven said, "Tang Jin, you really talk without considering the effort involved. I'm almost out of breath flying! That's a Golden Roc; few beings can match its speed. The fact that I can continuously close the distance is already an anomaly among ravens!"

"Hiss, that woman is fierce! She made a high-level being bleed quickly across the night sky!" the purple-eyed raven exclaimed, its speed slightly slowing.

"Don't be afraid. Take advantage of her being obstructed and chase her immediately!" Tang Jin urged, a seemingly ordinary pale yellow grass rope appearing in her hand.

"You didn't take down the rope from your teacher's roof beam, did you? Wasn't it tied to a..." the purple-eyed raven asked in alarm.

"Not that one!" Tang Jin urged it to speed up again.

The purple-eyed raven flapped its wings, gradually getting closer. Ahead, the fastest Crimson Lightning Bird, though it had caught up to the woman in green, was severely wounded in the blink of an eye. Under the night sky, the large goose-feather snow falling around the woman in green on the Golden Roc was dyed gold by her mysterious means, fluttering everywhere, but its speed was thousands of times faster. Standing on the Roc's back, she didn't seem to make any movements, but the dazzling golden snowflakes had already carved out many inexplicable trajectories, slashing towards the Crimson Lightning Bird from all angles, tearing apart the light around its body, instantly covering it in blood.

The high-level anomalous being, the Crimson Lightning Bird, was fierce. It let out a high-pitched cry, its body seemingly burning as a large amount of crimson light erupted, expanding in all directions. It was like a crimson sun hanging there, illuminating the night sky. All the golden snowflakes instantly melted, but terrifyingly, they weren't completely evaporated. Instead, the golden light suddenly intensified, turning into a continuous light rain, and all the golden raindrops elongated infinitely, then crisscrossed there. A mournful bird cry rang out. The massive Crimson Lightning Bird was actually cut into dozens, even hundreds, of pieces by the dense fine lines formed by the golden raindrops. Both its flesh and its spirit-rich feathers were cut apart by the golden threads, leaving no intact parts, falling towards the dark earth.

The purple-eyed raven grinned, wanting to turn and flee, but Tang Jin on its back made her move. The unremarkable grass rope glowed brightly, extending out, rushing towards the woman in green ahead.

"Someone from Flowing Light City?!" The woman in green on the Golden Roc's back immediately recognized Tang Jin's origin the moment she saw the grass rope.

"Will it work?" The purple-eyed raven was very unconfident.

"Rush over immediately, collide with her head, and somehow figure out a way to snatch half of the heaven-bestowed item!" Tang Jin fully activated the grass rope, making its golden light flare.

That night, Qin Ming slept soundly. As the saying goes, "He who is content is always happy." With just a small gain, he felt very satisfied. The most mysterious item was too far from him; he didn't crave it and hadn't thought about it at all.

The next day, after entering the mountain with Mu Qing, Cao Long, and Wei Zhirou, Qin Ming heard many incredibly explosive pieces of news.

"It's terrifying! Last night, the distant night sky was burning. More than just one or two powerful figures from certain large organizations and high-level anomalous beings died, yet they still couldn't stop that woman in green."

"The main reason is that there are too few anomalous beings capable of flying. If true grand experts could all ascend to the sky, it would be a different situation."

"Reportedly, City Lord Ling almost slapped his thigh off, regretting deeply that he hadn't bought a fast flying mount back then. He was so enraged that he directly ran back to Scarlet Cloud City."

People discussed fervently, and various pieces of news came in, making everyone entering the mountain feel uneasy, afraid of incurring the wrath of high-level anomalous beings. This was because some saw the old weasel, usually calm and steady as a venerable monk, actually carrying its donkey and madly galloping through the mountains for a long time, shattering large tracts of forest.

"It's understandable. Anyone who gets intercepted like that would probably be enraged to the point of spitting blood," Cao Long said, seated on the back of a giant ox.

"You're right. I don't dare go deep into the mountains now," a creature spoke from the treetop.

Cao Long was startled. Who was speaking in mid-air? He abruptly looked up and saw the Talking Sparrow. He immediately lost his composure and directly hurled the large spear in his hand at the tree. With a *crunch*, the treetop above, its main trunk severed, crashed down with a rumble. The Talking Sparrow traced a graceful arc in the night sky, flying away very nimbly.

Old Liu advised, "No need to be angry with it. Don't worry, when early spring arrives and it starts breeding, I, this old man, will help you vent your anger. If we can't do anything to it, can't we still catch its offspring?"

Cao Long immediately clapped his hands and said, "Alright! I want to raise a few Talking Sparrows, preferably even catch the one from just now."

For a while, Cao Long and Old Liu chatted, finding each other quite congenial. Not long after, Old Liu casually mentioned, "The special nodes in the mountain are limited, just those few, and very difficult to find. But there are other opportunities in the mountain, though they are very dangerous. For example, some areas are inhabited by creatures that have mutated three times. Do you dare touch them?"

Cao Long said, "Are there still such places left? Some old-timers already took action in advance; they were sweeping the mountains yesterday. I'm afraid there's not much spiritual material left in the outer regions of the mountain." As for the deep parts of the mountain, he would absolutely not set foot there, not even if he joined forces with Mu Qing and Wei Zhirou. That was not a place they could risk.

Old Liu patted his chest and said, "There are! I'm truly too familiar with this mountain. There are places others can't find at all, but I know them like the back of my hand."

Hearing this, Cao Long's eyes immediately lit up. He said, "No problem! If we get a good harvest, we'll definitely give you a share, old man."

Mu Qing and Wei Zhirou also nodded in agreement. Rather than searching for uncertain special nodes, it was better to head directly for a secret place with spiritual material. Qin Ming immediately knew where Old Liu wanted to take them. Old Liu had also told him about it that night while they were drinking.

The Fire Bat Cave, located in a grotto leading deep into the mountain, had a profound and winding path. One had to walk very far inside to reach it. There was a fire spring there, inhabited by a large colony of fire bats, the strongest of which had already mutated three times. Fire bats did not contain spiritual material, but their droppings, when fallen nearby, helped a spiritual crimson-red small grass to grow, which could assist people in undergoing a second awakening. Qin Ming had originally been pondering whether, at the appropriate time, he could share the fire snake, which was no longer of much use to him, with Old Liu and Lu Ze. He hadn't expected Old Liu to have his own means of acquiring spiritual items.

The trip to the Fire Bat Cave, though not without incident – some youngsters from the three teams were injured – had no suspense with Cao Long, Wei Zhirou, and Mu Qing holding the line. Apart from leaving some grass seeds, all the red grass there was pulled up. Old Liu was beaming, clutching a cluster of fiery-red glowing plants in his arms. This grass was only three inches tall, but it contained rich vitality and spirituality.

Before the shallow night arrived, Qin Ming hunted a wild ox, found an opportunity to stuff the half-piece of stone from its mouth into its abdomen, and then met up with Cao Long, Mu Qing, and the others. He hadn't hunted for a long time, so bringing back a game animal now was perfectly reasonable. Most importantly, his relationship with this group of people was very good now. Even if someone was guarding outside the mountain, observing those coming out, they wouldn't come to question Qin Ming and Old Liu, who were walking with Mu Qing, Cao Long, and the others. They all smoothly exited the mountain with their respective gains.

That night, Qin Ming didn't even bother to eat dinner. After returning home, he began to study the half-piece of stone.

"What's going on?" His heart sank slightly. When he took the stone out of the mountain today, he already felt something was off; he hadn't sensed that faint fluctuation. Now, calming his mind and concentrating, he held it with both hands, yet still felt nothing special. Ever since he was eroded and adapted in the crevice, Qin Ming had developed an extraordinary special perception for mysterious items nourished by Heavenly Radiance. But now, he couldn't detect anything inside.

He took a deep breath and began to carefully peel off the stone shell. If he could feel the fluctuations again, he might stop and wait a few more days before cutting it open. However, he had already crushed more than half of the stone, yet there was still no abnormality, no movement whatsoever. Just as his heart continued to sink, he actually touched some kind of mysterious item, but no anomaly appeared, nor did a single wisp of the residual Heavenly Radiance that should have been there spill out.

"What is this?!" Even Qin Ming, usually as steady as a mountain, was so startled that he nearly jumped up.
