# Chapter 218: The Flood Dragon Enters the Sea, Heaven Bestows a Blessing

The evening was closing in near the coast.

The afterglow of the setting sun painted the sky and earth in a single hue.

The sea breeze was salty and damp. Hundreds of disciples on the shore stood up. A banquet had been set up here, with red carpets covering the ground and wooden tables arranged. Masters took their seats.

More than ten black iron warships blocked the river channel. However, two of the ships had already been overturned by the flood dragon’s tail flip, sinking into the river.

The Dragon Ship sailed forward slowly. Despite being surrounded by powerful enemies, Wen Caishang remained calm and composed, her demeanor elegant and graceful.

Wen Caishang, Li Xian, and the Old Dragon had traveled a long distance as uninvited guests, finally arriving at this place. The disciples on both banks immediately stood up, all looking toward Sheng Yunfei.

The Black Dragon Sect was extremely famous with vast influence. Its leader, Sheng Tianxiong, dominated a region and was a worthy hero. His son, "Sheng Yunfei," carried on his father's ambitions and was no ordinary person.

Sheng Yunfei’s expression was distant as he scrutinized Wen Caishang. He couldn't help but be slightly entranced. Just half a moment ago, he had been angry at her strength, respectful of her power, and fearful of her methods. He was immensely curious about her.

Now that they met, her appearance, charm, bearing, voice, figure, and grace... far exceeded his expectations.

Sheng Yunfei muttered to himself, "What a beauty, what a beauty. This is entirely filled with my Black Dragon Sect's disciples, yet she闯阵 (breaks into the formation) alone and remains so composed!" With a graceful bearing, he said loudly, "Miss, Yunfei pays his respects."

"Miss, you have traveled a long way and spared no hardship. You have passed through obstacles and proven your strength. In a one-on-one fight, I admit I am no match. But regarding the slaying of the dragon, I have prepared for many days and cannot easily give up. Later, we will fight with numbers against the few. I hope you will not blame me."

He glanced at the sky. The setting sun was about to disappear, but there was still some light left. He thought, "Though it is not the most perfect timing, it is close enough." He couldn't retreat. With a wave of his large hand, he immediately shouted, "Activate the formation!"

The sound shook for miles, clearly showing his immense internal energy.

Hundreds of disciples on both banks ran to the sides of the river bank, holding black iron rods. These rods had a special shape; the end was a sphere, but it was pierced with countless fine holes.

The iron rods struck the lake. The spherical ends were heavy and weighty. Upon striking, water splashed. Pouring internal energy into them, the spheres vibrated rapidly, turning the splashing water into thick mist.

In an instant, the mist spread and surged forth.

The hundreds of people striking the water together created a magnificent spectacle. Furthermore, the sound of war drums came from the distant mountains.

Wen Caishang said, "I have long heard that the Young Master of the Black Dragon Sect, Sheng Yunfei, enjoys studying the stars in the heavens. Based on the celestial stars, he has arranged a formation that kills whoever blocks it, be they human or Buddha."

Sheng Yunfei’s heart filled with joy. "She has heard of my name and knows my hobbies. Could it be she has researched me?" He felt greatly flattered and said respectfully, "I know your name is Caishang. I do not know your surname?"

Wen Caishang said, "A humble girl's name is not worth mentioning."

"Miss Caishang is too modest!" Sheng Yunfei said, "I set up this formation to trap you solely because our positions are different. This dragon is of great use to me. I have no intention of opposing you. If you do not mind, I will apologize and make amends afterward."

"I truly wish to know your name and be friends. I am the Young Master of the Black Dragon Sect. In the martial world, I have some reputation..."

"Save it," Wen Caishang said.

"It is a pity, truly a pity." Sheng Yunfei was restless and couldn't suppress his agitation. He didn't want to give up. He continued, "This great formation of mine requires 360 martial world experts to operate together to form the array. How about this: if you cannot break the array, please tell me your name?"

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Is this formation difficult to break?"

Sheng Yunfei smiled and said, "I naturally know you are extremely powerful. But my 360 Zhou Tian Star Drum Formation, you absolutely..."

Wen Caishang said, "This formation is indeed powerful. Gathering experts and arranging the formation requires a huge investment. Only you, the Young Master, could have such capability. However, all great formations in the world must follow certain principles."

"If you can discern the principles, you can break it easily."

"Your formation was derived from observing the stars, so it must follow the principles of the Zhou Tian celestial stars. Once activated, it is like trapping the enemy in the vast sky, surrounded by darkness. It exhausts people until they collapse and lose. Is that how it works?"

Sheng Yunfei changed color. He specialized in this formation and had rarely used it. Its miraculous effects had never been spread.

This formation was complex. It required 360 experts to be distributed in 360 positions. These positions corresponded to the positions of the stars. Then, through drumming, beating chests, and executing martial arts specific to the formation... they resonated with each other.

Layered resonance, connected formation momentum, and the miraculous effects were fully displayed. It suppressed internal energy, created illusions... confused the mind, and disoriented the position.

But this formation had a major flaw.

It required prior reconnaissance of the terrain. Because every standing position was extremely particular. It had to be arranged according to the Zhou Tian stars. However, the trends of the heavens and the earth change constantly, so it required prior reconnaissance to be implemented.

"How did you know these things..." Sheng Yunfei changed color.

Wen Caishang smiled faintly and said, "Is it difficult? Observing stars and divination, I know a thing or two."

"I also know that your formation becomes even more powerful at night when the stars appear in the sky, reflecting the starlight."

"Good! Good!" Sheng Yunfei said with admiration, "Miss Caishang, you are widely learned and knowledgeable. I, Sheng, admire you. In my life, I have never submitted to anyone. Today, I am truly impressed!"

Li Xian thought to himself: "The Broken Sword Madam, the Broken Sword Madam... Her strength can break the heroes, her beauty can break the heroes, and her knowledge can also break the heroes. As martial artists of our generation, our knowledge should be as deep as the abyss!" He also felt extremely admired.

"You are already trapped in the formation. Even if you know the principle, what can you do?" Sheng Yunfei asked.

Wen Caishang said, "I will naturally break it."

Sheng Yunfei said confidently, "I know your strength. My many brothers will absolutely not fight you head-on. If you are injured, I am unwilling. If my brothers are lost, I am also unwilling. Your sword art is high, but it is impossible for you to break my formation."

It turned out...

The key to the Zhou Tian Star Drum Formation was the sound of the "drumming." The drums were set up in the distant mountains. Even though Wen Caishang's sword art was divine, it was difficult to reach the drums.

And the mist over the river disturbed vision and hearing. Even if one had a projectile martial art, it would be impossible to touch the drums.

Wen Caishang said, "Since you know the key to this formation, I might as well tell you directly. This Zhou Tian Star Drum Formation has seven drums. They are on mountains several miles away. Even if your archery is strong, it is absolutely difficult to shoot the drums."

Wen Caishang said, "Not necessarily. I know someone who can do this with archery alone."

Sheng Yunfei said warily, "Miss Caishang, are you referring to 'Ten Thousand Miles Divine Arrow' Shangguan Xunya? Is he also on the ship?"

Wen Caishang said, "It's not some Ten Thousand Miles Divine Arrow. Xiao Xian, shoot the drums!"

Li Xian stepped forward, his Qi sinking to his Dantian, his eyes containing a sharp glint. He immediately drew the bowstring, listening to the drum sounds to locate them, and shot an arrow. The yellow jade ornament trembled four times, and the arrow shaft was covered in yellow light, making its speed even faster.

With a whistling sound, it approached a drum. The drummer was not weak and immediately raised his hand to grab it. Suddenly, the arrow split into three, dodged the grab, and pierced through the drum.

Sheng Yunfei changed color.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Shoot again."

Li Xian heard the drum sound, his body suddenly twisting as he shot toward another side. He held the Yellow Dragon Bow, using it more and more smoothly.

This arrow shot out. The yellow jade ornament shook five times. Wherever the arrow passed, a yellow rainbow remained, its momentum unstoppable. When shooting, Li Xian applied the essence of the "Breeze Leg." The arrow went like the breeze, ethereal and impossible to catch.

The drummer was already on guard. He held a drumstick and struck the arrow. He knocked the arrow down, but the second arrow followed immediately. He swung the drumstick, desperately defending the drum, his strength very strong.

However, doing so, concentrating his energy to deal with the flying arrow, meant the drumming weakened. The resonance and synchronization were not in place, so the Zhou Tian Star Drum Formation naturally weakened.

Li Xian's archery was natural. After reaching the pinnacle of the "Four Directions Fist," he twisted the force lines, changed his posture, and twisted his direction very naturally.

A moment ago, he shot to the left. The next instant, he shot to the right, precise and powerful. With his strength alone, he was enough to match several archers.

Every arrow shot out had an imposing manner and intent that was not ordinary. Although the drummers were strong, they didn't dare to be careless. They had to focus their attention to deal with it, and the rhythm of the drumming was already chaotic.

All seven drummers were harassed by flying arrows. They felt as if they had a thorn in their back and a fishbone in their throat at all times. It was extremely stifling. They were in the open, and the hidden arrows were hard to defend against.

No, they were the ones in the dark, but the visible arrows were hard to defend against. Wen Caishang thought: "I still underestimated Li Xian's archery. I didn't expect that with the Yellow Dragon Bow, he could break this great formation by himself."

The drum rhythm was chaotic, and the formation naturally broke. The flood dragon raised its head from the river, took a mighty breath. It sucked the mist into its body, then stirred the waves, sweeping the strong experts on both banks.

Sheng Yunfei originally thought there were seven or eight divine archers on the ship. He was surprised that Wen Caishang had found so many experts. When the clouds and mist cleared, he saw that the one holding the bow was only a youth, and he couldn't help but feel greatly surprised.

The flood dragon saw its chance, whipped its tail, and sped toward the estuary.

Sheng Yunfei was greatly unexpected and shouted, "Cast the net, cast the net!"

Two strong guards at the river mouth, tall as giants, held a large net and threw it fiercely at the dragon.

This net was made of tough material, soaked in the urine of eighteen different exotic beasts. It was stained with filthy Qi and was most effective against the half-dragon entering the sea. Once covered, it would immediately cause weakness.

Wen Caishang tapped the tip of her foot lightly, leaping gracefully to stand on the dragon's head. She said, "Old Dragon前辈 (Senior), just charge forward."

The flood dragon nodded and charged toward the sea. Wen Caishang struck three consecutive sword blows, tearing the iron net apart completely. The flood dragon was unstoppable, leaping out of the river surface and flying toward the sea.

Sheng Yunfei sighed softly, knowing he had missed his chance. His gaze fixed on the sea surface. The flood dragon completed its final transformation. Dragon scales shone with golden light, and the dragon horns were majestic and towering.

The flood dragon washed away its weary state. Wind and clouds gathered, thunder and rain came simultaneously. The flood dragon soared proudly in the sky. After traveling forty-nine thousand miles down the river, it finally achieved its true form.

Sheng Yunfei was in a daze. But what his eyes saw was not the soaring flood dragon, but Wen Caishang standing at the end of the dragon.

The flood dragon entered the sea. It swam freely for a while, then returned to the coast. Sheng Yunfei said, "Old Dragon前辈 (Senior), manifesting as a dragon, congratulations, congratulations."

The flood dragon snorted coldly but didn't respond. It lowered its head, and Wen Caishang walked down the dragon's body. The flood dragon roared at Sheng Yunfei, baring its sharp teeth, displaying its fierce might.

Sheng Yunfei wanted to talk to Wen Caishang, ask her name, and make friends. He heard she also understood astrology and wanted to discuss the mysteries with her. But seeing the situation was not right, it would be hard to have a peaceful interaction. He also thought that such a woman definitely had a reputation. Since he knew her name was "Caishang," he could just find someone to inquire later. There would always be a chance to meet again in the future.

He said, "Dragon前辈 (Senior), since you don't welcome me, I will leave now."

"Get lost!" The flood dragon's voice was like a muffled thunder.

The water journey ended.

Suddenly, heavenly light condensed, and a heavenly blessing descended!
