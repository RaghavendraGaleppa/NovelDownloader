# Chapter 71: The Journey

“Good to see you, good to see you. I didn’t expect to run into Young Master Xu here. It’s a pleasant surprise.”

Xu Yunfan smiled. “I am preparing to go to the state city of Changyi to join a sect and seek further improvement. I didn’t think I would encounter Brother Liu in this wilderness. I am truly delighted.”

Liu Tianyuan invited Xu Yunfan into the camp. After reporting to the caravan’s master and receiving permission, he dismissed the guards. The two then sat down within the camp.

Liu Tianyuan’s pupils flashed with a calculating glint as he momentarily set down the sealed mud of the wine jar.

He had been thinking about how to deal with the excess monster beast meat. The meat had not been properly bled during processing, leaving a strong, gamey odor, and he was worried about how to sell it off. Now that a wealthy customer like Xu Yunfan had appeared, he naturally couldn't let the opportunity slip by.

“What a coincidence! We set off for the state city at the end of the *yin* hour tomorrow to deliver these rare mountain goods! This wild road is cold at night with heavy dew, jackals and wolves are watching, and mountain bandits run rampant. The greenwood watches from the side...”

Liu Tianyuan’s gruff voice suddenly softened by three degrees as he poured wine for Xu Yunfan.

“If Young Master Xu is willing to keep company with the carriage at the rear of the convoy, in three days when we pass Flying Crane Ridge, old Liu will surely have thirty pounds of iron-crowned snake gall to accompany the wine, waiting for you to enjoy it! Furthermore, those hundred-plus pounds of red-crested venison ribs need a chef skilled in this art to roast them to bring out their flavor.”

“I also have a bottle of Deer Marrow Spring Revival Pills. How about I sell it to you for fifty taels of silver?”

Two hundred pounds of red-crested venison ribs. Although this grade of monster beast meat isn't considered particularly high, it still costs five taels of silver per pound. For an ordinary family, five taels of silver is enough for a family of three to live comfortably with meat every day for a month. But once one begins practicing martial arts, money flows away like water, and these monster beast meats are quite cheap in comparison.

Xu Yunfan gave a slight bow toward the black wood carriage carved with patterns of green phoenixes chasing the moon, ten steps away. That was the master’s carriage.

“I would be delighted.”

When the night wind swept past the remaining embers of the campfire, the red-crested venison ribs had already been cooked to perfection by the chef.

Liu Tianyuan was pulled down by Xu Yunfan to drink. After a few cups, slightly tipsy, Liu Tianyuan stood up to take his leave, leaving a spacious carriage compartment for Xu Yunfan to rest.

Looking at the table where more than half of the venison ribs remained, Xu Yunfan let out a light laugh, thinking that Liu Tianyuan was indeed a smooth operator.

He stopped being polite and began to devour the ribs in large mouthfuls, even crunching the roasted bones into pieces and swallowing them into his stomach.

After dozens of pounds of venison went down his stomach, it wasn't long before a warm sensation slowly spread from his stomach throughout his body, making him feel incredibly comfortable.

After eating and drinking his fill, Xu Yunfan looked at the remaining twenty to thirty pounds of venison, wrapped it up, and then lay down to rest. He pulled a porcelain bottle from his chest, poured out a Spring Revival Pill, and gently licked it with his tongue.

*‘You licked a pill that supplements Qi and blood. Your body has not undergone any changes.’*

Seeing the prompt appear in his vision, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He directly poured a handful of pills from the bottle and swallowed them with water.

He looked down at his body. The crimson, winding bloodstains still covered his skin like hideous patterns. It would clearly still take some time for them to completely fade.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, formed the Seal of the Lin with his hands, and silently recited the *Superior Goodness Like Water* Heart Incantation in his mind.

Delusions were quickly stripped away, and he soon fell into a state that was neither empty nor full.

In his Sea of Consciousness, the Self-Deity slowly walked out from the churning mist, taking control of the center and suppressing everything.

*‘You practiced the Lin Seal diligently. Your heart moved slightly, your understanding of the Superior Goodness Like Water Heart Incantation grew deeper, and your proficiency in the Lin Seal increased.’*

*‘You studied the Lin Seal earnestly, repeatedly pondering every vein of spiritual circulation. Proficiency has risen.’*

*‘...’*

Half an hour later, Xu Yunfan slowly opened his eyes. His expression held no trace of fatigue; on the contrary, he looked refreshed and full of spirit. The previous sense of exhaustion had been swept away completely.

*So that’s how it is.*

Xu Yunfan understood in his heart.

When he had cultivated the Lin Seal previously, all the energy was spent on meditating and carving the Self-Deity. Therefore, he would feel mentally exhausted after every session.

Now that the Lin Seal had reached the入门 (Entry) level, the Self-Deity had already been carved and naturally nourished him in return. This meant that as long as he spent one or two hours a day cultivating the Lin Seal, he wouldn't need to sleep at all.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan felt a surge of excitement.

In this way, he could devote more time to practicing martial arts and faster push his muscles, bones, and skin to the perfection realm.

It wasn't that he enjoyed the life of an ascetic monk, but rather that every increase in proficiency brought him a great sense of achievement.

This pleasure, similar to leveling up in a game, kept him engrossed.

Because his body was injured, Xu Yunfan couldn't engage in intense activities. Instead, he silently tempered his bones using the techniques from the *Iron Bridge Guarding Gate Bone Tempering Chapter*.

This technique could be practiced both in stillness and in motion. The prerequisite for practicing in stillness was that the muscles had to be greatly perfected, allowing one to exert pressure on the bones through the twitching of muscles and the snapping of tendons.

*‘You are practicing silently, focusing on the accumulation of muscles and tendons on the bones. Your bones feel a sensation of squeezing and stretching. Proficiency in the Iron Bridge Guarding Gate Bone Tempering Chapter has increased.’*

*‘...’*

The next morning, Xu Yunfan was awakened by the swaying of the carriage.

He opened his eyes and lifted the carriage curtain. He found that the entire caravan was already packed and ready, beginning to move.

Liu Tianyuan rode over on a tall horse. Pulling the reins, he laughed, “Brother, for the next few days, rest well inside the carriage. When we reach Changyi, I’ll treat you to a great meal.”

Xu Yunfan naturally agreed immediately. With the red-crested venison ribs and the Spring Revival Pills, Liu Tianyuan had at least made a twenty percent profit off him. He certainly couldn't miss out on this good meal.

For the next few days, the caravan advanced smoothly without any major incidents.

Xu Yunfan spent his days cultivating the Lin Seal and tempering his bones. Occasionally, he would lift the carriage curtain to look at the scenery along the way.

The caravan's progress wasn't fast, and the mountain and water scenery along the way was quite refreshing.

If someone got close enough, they could even hear the sound of muscles rubbing together and the crisp snapping of tendons.

But these sounds were quickly drowned out by the noise of the carriage and horses moving forward.

Until the third day, near the camphor forest thirty miles from Flying Crane Ridge, Liu Tianyuan came specifically to solemnly inform him that there were greenwood heroes stationed at Flying Crane Ridge, and they would have to pay a toll to pass.

It was the first time Xu Yunfan had heard of such a thing, and he was naturally curious.

“Brother Liu, are these mountain bandits common?”

“Common? Of course, they’re common. Not to mention the entire Yanbei Dao, just in Qingzhou alone, there are dozens of bandits of all sizes. You can’t kill them all, and you can’t reason with them. Extinguish one batch, and a new one comes.”

Liu Tianyuan sighed. “In these times, the nobles naturally feel that the world is peaceful and prosperous, but the people at the bottom suffer.”

He paused and then said, “Whatever happens next, Brother Xu, don't worry about it. I’m familiar faces with those guys. I’ll just say hello and give them some silver. If they see a strange face, it would cause unnecessary trouble.”
