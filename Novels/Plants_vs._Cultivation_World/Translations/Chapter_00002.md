# Chapter 2: Drawing Qi

"Whew!"

Gu Mo closed the diary and exhaled deeply. From the original owner's journal entries, he had begun to suspect that someone might have sabotaged his cultivation progress. Otherwise, how could someone with spiritual roots fail to complete Qi Induction even after taking a Qi-Drawing Pill? Those pills were the best aid for beginners in cultivation—even mortals without spiritual roots had a minuscule chance of succeeding, let alone someone who possessed them.

Having just transmigrated into this world, Gu Mo already sensed deep malice lurking around him, making him increasingly cautious. He had no intention of dying mysteriously shortly after arriving.

Glancing at the "Soul Refinement Manual" in his hand, he knew this sinister cultivation method had to be dealt with. If discovered, it would be impossible to explain. However, the manual's material was peculiar—it couldn't be torn or burned. Simply discarding it wasn't an option either, as he had no idea if there were tracking methods involved.

"Got it!"

A thought flashed through Gu Mo's mind, and the manual suddenly vanished from his hand, tossed into the black mist space. That should ensure absolute safety.

With the manual disposed of, Gu Mo rummaged through the bedside cabinet and retrieved another booklet. This was also a cultivation manual, but unlike the forbidden "Soul Refinement Manual," this one—"Qi Induction Technique"—was openly distributed by the Qinglu Sect to its outer disciples. It was a basic guide on how to draw qi into the body.

Aside from several thousand characters detailing the technique, the booklet contained many of the original owner's notes. The Qinglu Sect didn't just hand out manuals—they provided guidance. The middle-aged man in the blue robe from earlier was the instructor responsible for teaching these outer disciples.

The densely packed notes showed that the original owner had indeed worked hard on cultivation. These notes also helped Gu Mo quickly grasp the basics of the "Qi Induction Technique."

As a transmigrator with a modern education, Gu Mo's reading comprehension was naturally strong. Combined with his knowledge from another world, his understanding was no worse than that of a genius.

Once he grasped the technique, Gu Mo eagerly prepared to attempt cultivation. After all, how could he resist trying out immortal techniques in a world of cultivation?

From the cabinet, he took out three thumb-sized jade stones—low-grade spirit stones issued by the Qinglu Sect. Even without Qi-Drawing Pills, these could assist in cultivation.

Following the method described in the manual, Gu Mo began sensing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. Unfortunately, his inferior spiritual roots made his perception of qi extremely faint. After what felt like an eternity, he finally detected a faint glimmer of spiritual light from the stones in his hand.

---

Gu Mo knew this was the spiritual energy mentioned in the manual. The spirit stones had helped—without them, sensing qi would have taken far longer.

Without hesitation, he captured the wisp of spiritual light and guided it into his body. If he could channel it into his dantian (energy sea), he would have successfully completed Qi Induction.

"Could I succeed on the first try?"

Delighted as the spiritual light smoothly entered his body, his joy was short-lived. The wisp dissipated almost immediately—too thin to sustain itself, it was exhausted during the process.

"Again!"

Taking a deep breath, Gu Mo steadied his mind and resumed cultivation. After several attempts, he finally guided a faint strand of spiritual energy into his dantian. Just as he thought he had succeeded, the light was swallowed by a dark glow within.

At that moment, Gu Mo was certain—the original owner's failure to complete Qi Induction was no accident. With that black energy entrenched in his dantian, it was impossible for him to succeed, at least not within three days.

Failure within three days meant expulsion from the Qinglu Sect, cutting off his path of cultivation. As for becoming a rogue cultivator? For someone with inferior spiritual roots, that was practically a death sentence.

While rogue cultivators enjoyed freedom, they had to risk their lives for cultivation resources—techniques, pills, and spirit stones. If not for the Qinglu Sect's strict background checks, they could easily recruit rogue cultivators with established foundations.

With conventional methods failing, Gu Mo turned his attention to the Sunflower Seed he had obtained from the black mist space. If he could plant it and harvest its solar essence, perhaps that could help him succeed in Qi Induction.

He had a strong feeling the solar essence would bring him a pleasant surprise. The problem was, the sunflower required a spirit field to grow. The Qinglu Sect had spirit fields, and some outer disciples would eventually tend to them—but only after officially becoming outer disciples with established cultivation.

For now, Gu Mo and the others were confined to this area. Leaving without permission meant immediate expulsion.

Stuck in a deadlock, Gu Mo decided to seek information elsewhere. Staying idle wouldn't solve anything.

Leaving his small hut—it was already noon the next day—he headed for the dining hall. Even as an outer disciple, the Qinglu Sect provided each with an individual hut, as cultivation required solitude.

His first stop was the dining hall. As a mortal, he still needed to eat. Even after Qi Induction, he wouldn't be able to abstain from food immediately.

---

The diary had mentioned the dining hall, so Gu Mo found it easily. Surprisingly, there were few people inside despite it being mealtime.

He could guess why—everyone was busy cultivating. With inferior spiritual roots, the only way to progress was to invest more time.

The free meals provided were ordinary fare, though they would be considered delicacies in the mortal world. Better options—spirit rice or spirit beast meat—required payment, not in mortal currency but in spirit stones or sect contribution points.

After eating, Gu Mo headed straight for the library. The section open to outer disciples wasn't expected to contain anything valuable—just books on various cultivation arts and low-grade techniques.

Since outer disciples would eventually handle miscellaneous tasks related to cultivation arts, it made sense to familiarize them early.

Gu Mo's target was precisely these books, especially those about spirit fields. If he could solve the spirit field problem, he could plant the sunflower.

"Found it!"

Soon, his eyes lit up with excitement. Among the books, he had discovered a workaround—a method to grow the sunflower without needing an actual spirit field.
