# Chapter 558: A Well-Matched Battle

The foul, sticky crimson blood waves, upon touching the resplendent domain of purple lightning, immediately erupted into towering, foul-smelling black smoke.

Countless wailing vengeful spirits within the Blood Sea, as if encountering their most terrifying nemesis, were instantly purified and annihilated into nothingness by the pure Destruction Divine Lightning amidst scalp-tingling shrieks.

Those terrifying turbid poisons capable of corroting Dharma treasures and dissolving spiritual roots, before the supreme yang and supreme firm Heavenly Gang Divine Lightning imbued with the righteous energy of heaven and earth, were like spring snow meeting the blazing sun, crumbling and dispersing one after another.

However, Blood Elder Devil was, after all, a late Foundation Establishment cultivator, a veteran demon of the Primordial Origin Sect with authentic lineage, possessing a Dao Foundation that was incredibly profound and mighty.

Although the Blood Filthy Sea was greatly purified and evaporated by the Heavenly Gang Thunder, its volume far surpassed Xu Yunfan's Thunder Domain, and its subsequent force was turbulent and endless, as if boundless.

Blood Elder Devil wore an evil expression, muttered incantations under his breath, and spread his hands wide.

Immediately, the blood sea behind him churned violently, with blood waves crashing down layer after layer. The tangible filth energy, like countless venomous snakes, surged forward one after another to tear at the purple thunder domain's light curtain, attempting to completely pollute and devour this pure land of thunder.

This terrifying filth energy transmitted through the gaps in the thunder's defense, causing Xu Yunfan to feel a faint, needle-like pricking and numbness on his skin, and the pure thunder energy within his body to circulate slightly sluggishly.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

Purple lightning and blood waves frantically annihilated, devoured, and crushed each other above the Divine Peaks.

The blood sea roared, attempting to pollute the Thunder Pond.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were deep and unfathomable, without a trace of panic. He simply raised his hand before his chest, forming a thunder seal.

The next instant, the thunder roared, like intertwined thunderous snakes, vowing to purify the filthy sea.

Wave after wave of destructive energy swept across the heavens, shredding the distant flowing clouds to pieces, and silently cracking the earth with fine fissures.

The sky above the Divine Peak was divided into two distinct halves.

On one side was the boundless blood sea of purgatory, deep and defiled, filled with the wails of vengeful spirits.

On the other side was the Heavenly Gang Thunder Punishment domain, brilliant and majestic, with divine lightning cleansing all.

At the center of the clash between the two great Dao Foundations, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in the long sky continuously twisted, tore, and then mended itself, emitting a deep, oppressive rumbling sound.

Intense light and shadows flickered frantically, and the destructive aura made it almost impossible for the onlooking Bi Yuan and the other Divine Peak disciples to look directly.

They could only subconsciously lower their heads, as the faint spiritual power within their bodies instinctively resisted the terrifying shockwaves that, even after being weakened by hundreds or thousands of times, were still heart-palpitating.

The collision between a mid and late Foundation Establishment cultivator had actually produced such a shocking, earth-shaking, and evenly matched terrifying scene.

The trace of astonishment beneath Blood Elder Devil's crazed expression could no longer be concealed.

He had thought that with his late Foundation Establishment cultivation and the advantage of five lifetimes of accumulated Dao Foundation, he would be able to crush Xu Yunfan.

Especially since the other party had actually dared to leave the protection of the main peak's protective array to clash with him within the domain of his most proud Filthy Sea Dao Foundation.

This was simply seeking his own death.

However, to his disbelief, his Filthy Sea Sinking Turbid Poison Dao Foundation, which was enough to defile all things and even a perfected Foundation Establishment, a Great True Person, would have to deal with carefully, could not completely crush that seemingly smaller purple thunder domain.

The thunder within that domain was pure and vast to an unbelievable degree. Its foundation was so solid and stable, its circulation so round and smooth, it even far surpassed all the thunder cultivators of the same level he had ever seen.

The Nine Celestial Lock Demon Unity Thunder Talisman Array formed by the Dao Foundation, under Xu Yunfan's fine adjustments, pushed the thunder's evil-purging特性 to its absolute limit.

Xu Yunfan stood at the center of the Purple Mansion Thunder Domain, his face slightly pale. Although he appeared to be on equal footing on the outside, his spiritual power consumption was immense, yet the light in his eyes grew brighter and brighter.

This was his first genuine battle at the Foundation Establishment level.

This was different from the brief exchange when he faced Liu Yunhua's sneak attack. This was a real duel of spells, and moreover, it was the terrifying impact of a late Foundation Establishment old demon unleashing the full power of his Dao Foundation.

Every wave of blood erosion, every渗透 of turbid poison, was frantically consuming his spiritual power and divine sense. If not for the stability of his nascent Heaven and the fact that the Divine Peak Nine Celestial Mystic Vault Indestructible Scripture and the Sun and Moon Pivot Method made his physical body far more resilient than his peers, and more importantly, the Heaven's self-generated energy providing an endless supply of pure origin energy to support him, he would have already been defeated.

The opponent was truly formidable, standing at the top even among late Foundation Establishment cultivators.

If not for the fact that he cultivated multiple scriptures and had the perfect advancement from his Attribute Panel, he might not have been able to withstand it.

But it was precisely this overwhelming pressure that allowed Xu Yunfan to clearly perceive just how perfect every level of his cultivation, refined under the Attribute Panel's monstrous deduction, had become.

Unrivaled in the same realm!

At this moment, he felt that the foundation of his mid Foundation Establishment cultivation seemed to have touched the threshold of something transcendent.

"Blood Elder Devil, after living for so long, enduring five lifetimes of wasted time, is this all the skill you have?!"

Xu Yunfan forcefully suppressed the churning of his blood and let out a long cry. The thunder patterns in his eyes flashed brilliantly, and his divine sense, without reservation, urged the massive purple thunder pill above his head.

*Boom!*

The Purple Mansion Destruction Heavenly Gang Thunder Domain expanded once more, and the speed of the plasma flow within it suddenly increased.

It could be seen that the thunder patterns in his pupils flashed intensely. The Purple Celestial Myriad Transformation Thunder Mansion Dao Foundation, condensed from the vast cultivation of the Divine Peak Nine Celestial Mystic Vault Indestructible Scripture atop his head, grew even more brilliant under the frenzied impact of the blood sea's boundless filth.

Blood Elder Devil's Dao Foundation was far more profound than he had anticipated.

The other party had built his foundation five times, each time choosing the Filthy Sea Sinking Turbid Poison Dao Foundation. The accumulation of five lifetimes allowed the impure blood sea to contain a level of filth and怨煞 origin that was faintly approaching the majestic aura of the perfect Dao Foundation advanced from the Attribute Panel.

Though it was inferior in terms of pure refinement and the restraint of righteous thunder law, the torrential blood resentment and vicious energy accumulated over five lifetimes was like a filthy star forming a deep mire, capable of dragging down and grinding away any late Foundation Establishment Dao Foundation.

"Five lifetimes of sinking, a hundred-refined Filthy Sea!"

Blood Elder Devil's voice was low, his words like the whispers of countless evil spirits amidst the roar of the blood waves.

"Junior, no matter how stable your foundation, how fierce your thunder arts, how can you outlast the heritage of my several lifetimes?

As one wanes, the other waxes. When the filthy waves reach the heavens, you shall be the supreme nourishment for my sixth lifetime in this sinking Filthy Sea!"

His twisted face grew even more sinister. A calmness, as if after reaching the end of a dead end,透 from his half-withered, half-flourishing face.

However, the filthy blood sea around him churned even more violently. Countless sinking vortices appeared faintly, frantically drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth outside the Divine Peak that had been polluted by him, and even began to erode the edge of the purple thunder domain in reverse, emitting a "sizzling" sound of pollution.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan's thoughts raced. The corner of his eye instantly swept across the surrounding void.

Outside the Divine Peak battlefield, many divine senses, like fine threads, carrying different auras—icy, sinister, faint fragrance, ethereal, solemn—were observing the situation here, either openly or covertly.

The divine sense from the Frost Marrow Peak, as cold as ten thousand years of ancient ice, should be from Ice Soul True Person.

The obscure yet fierce and greedy intent from the Soul Refining Peak should be from Black Heart Old Monster.
