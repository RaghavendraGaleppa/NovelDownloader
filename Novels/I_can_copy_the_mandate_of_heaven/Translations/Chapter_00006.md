## Chapter 6: The Eyes of Immortals

As soon as Li Zhiming turned around, he saw his father standing behind him. Before he could react, his father scooped him up onto his shoulder and began walking briskly towards home, laughing heartily. The sound of his laughter seemed to echo for miles.

"Ha! Who says my family doesn't have a remarkable child?" his father exclaimed.

Li Zhiming looked puzzled, unsure what "remarkable child" meant.

That evening, under the old willow tree, Li Chujiu sat with a big bowl of wine, boasting about being a great farmer in the village. The moonlight shone down like water, and the stars twinkled like dots in the sky, as if the immortals in the heavens were watching over the small village.

Li Chujiu believed that his children would follow in his footsteps and become great farmers, but deep down, he yearned for something more. He wanted his children to have a brighter future, one that didn't involve just tilling the land.

As people say, a person's destiny begins with their dreams. However, when Li Zhiming started seeing lines of characters above people's heads, he began to doubt the power of just dreaming.

Just like the people in the village, everyone wants their children to have a better life. But no matter how hard they tried, the village remained the same. The old willow tree had died and been reborn many times, and the villagers had changed from the Hu family to the Sun family, and then to the Li family. But it was all the same.

The towering mountains seemed to confine people's dreams, making it impossible for them to escape.

"Oh, you haven't seen it, have you?" said Kuai Zhui, a neighbor who sat beside Li Chujiu. She was known for her quick wit and sharp tongue.

"You don't know about the immortal lord from the county seat? With a wave of his hand, a huge ship appeared out of thin air, and the Zhang family was swept up and taken away. It was like magic!"

The villagers listened with wide eyes, their imaginations running wild. For them, being chosen by the Xuan Guang sect, a prestigious cultivation sect, was the only way to change their fate.

Li Zhiming's father, Li Chujiu, looked at his son, who was sitting on a stone, munching on peanuts. He sighed, worried that his son would be stuck in the village forever.

If only his son could be more like the children from the county seat, who could read and cultivate. But Li Zhiming was just a simple village boy.

"Da Niu, recite the poem you learned today!" Kuai Zhui encouraged, patting Da Niu on the back.

Da Niu, a chubby boy around Li Zhiming's age, looked nervous. In rural areas, children with nicknames like "Daniu" were considered auspicious.

However, Da Niu struggled to recite the poem, stumbling over the words. Li Zhiming watched with admiration, his eyes wide with wonder.

As the adults chatted, Li Zhiming's gaze drifted towards the stars. He imagined the immortal lords from the county seat, with their extraordinary auras. He longed to be like them, to have a chance to change his fate.

But for now, he was just a village boy, stuck in his predetermined path. The characters above people's heads seemed to confirm this - his family, his friends, all had black lines, indicating their ordinary fate.

Li Zhiming wondered if there was more to life than the mundane routine of the village. He thought about the county seat and the immortal lords, their green auras shining bright.

As he pondered, Li Zhiming discovered a new problem: learning and cultivating weren't easy, even if he wanted to try.

The stars above seemed to twinkle with a deeper meaning, as if watching over him, guiding him towards a path he had yet to discover.
