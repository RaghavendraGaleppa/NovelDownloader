# Chapter 37: Buying Rouge on a Snowy Day

“Everyone says that martial artists rely on eating, nurturing, training, and soaking. It seems that is indeed true.”

Eating a meal of tiger meat was better than training for several days. After Li Xian finished eating and drinking his fill, he walked out of the Dining Pavilion. He felt his strength was endless, something he could spend without worry.

Only after the Class C guards finished eating did the Class D guards rush in. They could only scoop up half a bowl of soup and some broken bones and scraps.

On this day, whether on his usual patrol or practicing martial arts, he was full of energy and in excellent condition.

[Square Fist] proficiency increased by [116] points. [Breeze Leg] proficiency increased by [97] points.

Evening arrived.

Li Xian found a moment of leisure amidst his busyness. He found a beautiful spot in the manor, sat on the snow, and lay back, resting his hands behind his head. He gazed leisurely at the blue sky, his mind gradually emptying.

“Younger brother has already left Qingning County to take his exams in Huangtian County. Now in Qingning County, I can be said to have no relatives left.”

Suddenly, he saw a few wild geese flying past. Li Xian reached out to grab them, but could only grasp empty air.

“Freedom... Having sold myself into servitude, freedom has truly become a luxury. But if one cannot even survive, what talk is there of freedom?”

Li Xian did not regret this decision. Otherwise, both he and his younger brother would have frozen to death in their thatched hut!

Li Xian sat up straight. With his right hand, he kneaded a ball of snow, using his Internal Qi to slowly apply pressure. The snowball turned into an ice crystal. Right in front of him was a green lake; the water here came from a hot spring vein. Even in the depths of winter, it did not freeze. Not only that, but the lotuses and water lilies in the lake bloomed as brightly as if it were spring. Fish swam about freely and happily.

Li Xian threw the ice crystal, skipping it across the water, drawing a beautiful arc on the surface.

“I’ve inquired. It seems there is no precedent for ‘buying out one’s contract’ in the One Harmony Manor. Once you enter the manor, it is for a lifetime.”

“The salary for a servant is meager; one could never afford to buy out their contract in a lifetime. As for guards, the words ‘buying out’ have never even been heard.”

“It seems to be a taboo.”

Li Xian had already achieved results on a small scale. He had gone from being a servant step by step to becoming a Class C guard. Although the leap was small, the improvement in his situation was visible to the naked eye.

Taking advantage of this free time... Li Xian contemplated his future path. His heart was like that of a swan goose, unwilling to be confined. But a great man should know when to take and when to yield, when to bend and when to stretch.

“Considering my current situation, my path is but one.”

“To continue forward. Leaving the manor aside, even if I wanted to obtain martial arts techniques, it would be even more difficult.”

“And... Commander Pang’s connections... The Martial Artist’s Rebirth Realm. Currently, the only place I can even touch the edges of it is within the manor.”

“Hah!”

Li Xian let out a long breath and walked to the lake, looking at his reflection in the water. He gently patted his cheeks to boost his spirits.

The manor’s strict rules were like a ladder. Climbing up is no easy task.

October 14th, mid-month.

At the third quarter of the morning hour, the sky remained overcast. Because the wind and snow were so heavy, even the sunlight was blocked, making it look as dark as night. The cold wind howled outside.

The past two days were rare holidays. Even the lowliest servants did not need to go out to work.

Inside the dormitory, three guards huddled around a fire basin, shivering.

“I say... Master Li, why don't you come warm up too?”

One of the guards shifted his body to the left, making space, and beckoned Li Xian to come sit.

“Alright.”

With nothing else to do, Li Xian also sat before the fire basin.

“It’s damn cold.”

Jia Jie, a Class D guard from the same dormitory, rubbed his hands vigorously to warm them, cursing as he spoke.

“Isn’t that the truth? In this weather... if we take ten steps out of the room, we’d be gone. Not an exaggeration at all.”

Bao Yongkang, another Class D guard, nodded in agreement.

“In this weather, they’ve even canceled the patrols,” said another Class D guard, Kong Sun.

“The cold is secondary. The main issue is the visibility is too low; you can’t tell directions at all,” Li Xian nodded.

“Exactly. If you get lost and wander around, letting this heavy snow刮 (guā - scrape/blister) you for three or five days, wouldn’t it freeze you to death?” Bao Yongkang immediately chimed in.

“Master Li, you came late, so you probably don’t know,” Kong Sun said. “In the neighboring dormitory, there was once a guard who got urgent need to urinate and went out on a snowy day. Guess what? The moment he stepped out the door, he disappeared.”

“Only when the snow lightened later was he found frozen to death fifteen paces away. This snowy weather... it’s no joke.”

Li Xian listened and looked at the wind and snow outside. It was no exaggeration.

Pitch black. Even with a torch, it would be extinguished instantly. Not to mention ten steps; even three steps could be enough to take a life. And the wind was too strong, making it impossible to figure out one’s方位 (fāngwèi - direction/position). The more panicked one becomes, the easier it is to die.

“By the way!”

Jia Jie suddenly remembered something and said, “Everyone, wait a moment for me.”

He hurriedly retrieved a wine jar from under his bed, undid the seal, and a wave of wine fragrance filled the air.

“Master Li, have a drink to warm up?” Jia Jie raised his eyebrows.

On a day with heavy wind and snow... having a little wine would be quite a different experience. Li Xian was about to speak when he suddenly heard a knocking sound at the door.

“Li Xian...”

A voice came through. Washed by the wind and snow, the voice was very indistinct. But it was still audible, showing that the speaker possessed powerful Internal Qi and was highly accomplished.

“Master Li... could it be a snow ghost?”

“C-come to claim your life?”

The three men shrank their necks, huddled together, and hid behind Li Xian.

“It’s not a snow ghost, it’s Commander Pang,” Li Xian frowned.

He opened the door. The cold wind howled in. It was pitch black outside. Pang Long, wrapped in a thick fur cloak, held an oil lamp in his left hand.

“Li Xian, come with me,” Pang Long said only that and walked straight ahead.

Li Xian hesitated for a moment but followed. The world was pitch black, the cold wind like a bone-scraping knife. Li Xian activated his Internal Qi to keep warm, but his skin still hurt from the wind.

Pang Long held the oil lamp, which always emitted a light. Li Xian wouldn't lose him, and having mastered the "Treading on Snow" trait, walking wasn't difficult.

“Not bad. Your Internal Qi is trained very solidly,” Pang Long nodded.

“Commander Pang, on such a deep winter day, what matter could have you come looking for me?” Li Xian asked.

Pang Long sighed and said, “It is the Madam’s order.”

“The Madam?” Li Xian was stunned.

“The Madam’s orders, I never ask questions, never think, I just do. I hope you are the same,” Pang Long stopped and looked at Li Xian. “This task... the Madam specifically named you to do it.”

“Specifically named me?” Li Xian asked, “What matter could be so specific that it must be me?”

The two walked for a while longer and actually arrived at the manor gate.

Pang Long took off his fur cloak. “This matter... to say it is difficult is difficult, to say it is simple is simple.”

He handed the cloak and oil lamp to Li Xian and continued, “The Madam suddenly lacks rouge and cosmetics. She wants you to go to Qingning County to buy a box.”

“This...” Li Xian found it absurd. To go buy rouge in such weather?

“You just need to head east, and you will reach Qingning County. Put on the cloak, take the oil lamp, and set off,” Pang Long said with a look of pity.

He sighed again and again.

He did not dare to speculate on the Madam’s intentions.

But he knew that to leave the manor at this time, even for him, would be a journey with more danger than hope, likely never to return.

Let alone Li Xian!
