**Chapter 3: Demonic Sect Conduct**

When Lu Yang stepped out of the cultivation chamber, he found someone already waiting outside.

Lu Yang's heart immediately thumped. The person was clad in a black Daoist robe with a sinister expression – it was precisely the black-robed Daoist who had assigned him to the Joyful Union Hall earlier!

"Greetings, Senior Brother," Lu Yang quickly bowed.

"You're quite good. A real talent."

The black-robed Daoist said with a smile, "I heard that Yu Suzhen had brought a very capable young man into her chamber, and his breakthrough to Qi Condensation was imminent..."

"I never expected that vicious woman to fail, though."

As he spoke, the black-robed Daoist looked at Lu Yang with a peculiar gaze. Even though he considered himself widely experienced, he couldn't help but feel a touch of admiration at this moment. If this child didn't die, he would surely become a pillar of the Primal Sage Sect in the future!

"Follow me."

The black-robed Daoist, named Liu Xin, was an official disciple of Heaven-Mending Peak, one of the Inner Gate's Four Peaks. He was responsible for guiding probationary disciples who had advanced, and explaining sect matters.

"The Outer Gate's Four Halls and the Inner Gate's Four Peaks correspond to each other," Liu Xin explained to Lu Yang with interest as they walked. "Aside from Sacred Flame Cliff, where the Sect Master resides, our Primal Sage Sect is primarily centered around the Inner Gate's Four Peaks."

"Since you came from the Joyful Union Hall, you naturally belong to my Heaven-Mending Peak. I'll take you to update your registration first."

With someone guiding him, Lu Yang was naturally delighted. "Thank you, Senior Brother Liu."

"It's merely my duty," Liu Xin said indifferently. "After we update your registration, I'll take you to the other three halls. The benefits for official disciples are quite substantial, considered welfare provided by the sect."

"According to the rules, each official disciple can only claim them once." Here, Liu Xin's expression turned somewhat regretful. "Once you enter the Inner Gate, if you want to acquire items of a similar caliber again, you'll have to complete tasks issued by the sect and earn contribution points to exchange for them."

Lu Yang frowned. "Contribution points?"

"They are the currency issued by the sect," Liu Xin explained. "Junior Brother, after your registration is updated, you should be able to see them through your disciple token."

Curiosity piqued, Lu Yang immediately followed Liu Xin to update his registration. The process was quite simple: it merely involved moving the fate lamp he had lit upon entering the sect from the Outer Gate area to the Inner Gate area.

Afterward, Lu Yang channeled a wisp of True Qi into the token at his waist, and a line of text immediately appeared on it:

"Official Disciple, Lu Yang."

"As an official disciple, the Primal Sage Sect grants you 50 contribution points for free. Contribution points can be used to exchange for spirit stones, cultivation methods, magic tools, cultivation cave dwellings, and more."

"Upon entering the Inner Gate, you will need to pay contribution points to rent a cultivation cave dwelling, with the rent being 30 contribution points per month. Of course, you may also choose to purchase a cultivation cave dwelling. As a newly promoted Inner Gate disciple, you will receive a 20% discount on the down payment if you purchase a cultivation cave dwelling within ten years."

Such introductions spanned over a dozen pages.

After carefully reading through them, Lu Yang came to a conclusion: "This Inner Gate... it's all about money!"

With contribution points, one could go anywhere, with cultivation methods, pills, and magic treasures readily available. Without contribution points, one would find it impossible to move an inch, unable even to afford a cave dwelling.

At the same time, Lu Yang also understood what Liu Xin meant by "welfare." Each probationary disciple, upon promotion to an official disciple, could use their disciple token to select one magic tool from the Artifact Forging Hall, one pill from the Alchemy Hall, one companion spirit beast from the Beast Taming Hall, and one Dao companion from the Joyful Union Hall, all without needing to pay any contribution points.

"Looking at it this way, it really is a benefit."

Lu Yang's mind stirred. He used his disciple token to open the list of redeemable items using contribution points, and lines of corresponding text instantly appeared. Cultivation methods, magic tools, pills, spirit beasts, and even Dao companions, the cheapest of which required at least 100 contribution points.

In contrast, the rewards for tasks within the Primal Sage Sect were pitifully low, almost all in single digits, with very few reaching double digits. This clearly showed that the free "four-piece set" received upon becoming an official disciple was worth at least 400 contribution points, a considerable sum for an official disciple.

Lost in thought, Lu Yang had already followed Liu Xin to the Artifact Forging Hall.

The person who greeted them was named Chen Hao, a deacon of the Artifact Forging Hall. He was reportedly also an official disciple, and being a deacon of the Artifact Forging Hall was his task. According to Liu Xin, these fixed-position tasks were the most lucrative in the Inner Gate, not only offering many contribution points—often enough for one task to support an official disciple—but also being stable, akin to an iron rice bowl. Unfortunately, there were too many monks and too little gruel; without connections, one couldn't even dream of getting such tasks.

"Senior Brother Liu? Long time no see."

Upon entering the Artifact Forging Hall, Lu Yang noticed Chen Hao first sized him up, then turned to Liu Xin, greeting him warmly, "Bringing a new disciple over again?"

"Indeed," Liu Xin grinned, his words seemingly hinting at something. "Since you know, why don't you quickly bring out the finest magic tools in the Artifact Forging Hall for Junior Brother Lu to examine?"

"Right away!"

Chen Hao nodded eagerly, then led them into the inner courtyard of the Artifact Forging Hall. However, as they walked, Lu Yang frowned in surprise. "This... isn't this a disciple's cultivation chamber?"

To retrieve magic tools, shouldn't they be heading to a storeroom or something similar?

Chen Hao initially looked puzzled, then enlightened, bursting into laughter. "Junior Brother Lu doesn't know, but the best magic tools are all right here."

Before he finished speaking, the three stopped in front of a cultivation room.

"The junior brother in this room is very senior; he was a probationary disciple in the Outer Gate for three years. Unfortunately, he's a bit stubborn and strayed onto a deviant path in his cultivation..."

Having said that, Chen Hao directly pushed open the room door.

Lu Yang then saw a Daoist sitting cross-legged on a meditation mat in the center of the room, eyes tightly shut, muttering to himself as if in a trance.

"It's done... I'm going to succeed..."

Immediately after, Chen Hao formed a hand seal, and the Daoist in the room abruptly opened his eyes. A wild look of ecstasy appeared on his previously dull face.

"Hahaha! I've done it, Daoist Master me!"

Boom!

Before his words could fully register, his entire body exploded, scattering flesh and blood everywhere. Then, the fragments swirled back, completely merging into the skeleton left on the meditation mat.

In but a moment, a living person vanished.

In his place, a "Bone Sword" as clear and lustrous as jade, segment by segment, gently settled onto the meditation mat, radiating a dazzling magical tool glow.

Chen Hao stepped forward, picked up the "Bone Sword," and handed it to Lu Yang, then said with satisfaction, "The magic tool 'Bone Jade Sword,' considered a superior item in the *True Grotto Hundred Treasures Compendium*. This junior brother was indeed a talent; after cultivating diligently for so many years, his cultivation base was profound, otherwise, the spiritual light of the magic tool wouldn't be so pure."

Lu Yang: "..."

Looking at the Bone Jade Sword in Chen Hao's hand, and recalling his experiences in his previous life, Lu Yang felt a chill to his bones. He gained an even deeper understanding of the Primal Sage Sect's conduct.

It could be summarized in eight words: The strong prey on the weak; make the best use of everything!

The sect expended resources to cultivate these probationary disciples. Therefore, you must create value for the sect. If you can't create value, the sect will help you create it!

If you break through and become an an official disciple, then naturally, everyone is happy.

If you can't break through, the sect certainly won't support you for life. Naturally, it will recoup the resources invested in you, ensuring the sect does not incur a loss.

Therefore, in the eyes of the Primal Sage Sect, some disciples are like clouds, some like water; they just do different things. All are assets; there are no useless ones.

"This really is... true to the sect's name."

Lu Yang closed his eyes, deeply exhaling a turbid breath. Thinking of his Hundred Lives Scripture as his fallback, he reopened his eyes, his composure fully restored.

"Junior Brother has excellent composure! Truly an outstanding talent!" On the other side, seeing Lu Yang calm his emotions so quickly, Liu Xin's eyes first flashed with surprise, then his smile became even brighter.

Next, Lu Yang followed Liu Xin to the Alchemy Hall and the Beast Taming Hall, respectively, receiving a "Qi Replenishing Pill" and a "Human-faced Owl." The former, when consumed, could nourish True Qi, while the latter acted like a carrier pigeon, generally used by official disciples to transmit messages.

It was only when they got to the last item, the Dao companion, that Liu Xin seemed to have a problem.

"Junior Brother, you broke through too quickly," Liu Xin shook his head and said, "You only just joined the Outer Gate, and then Qi Condensation in one day—that's too fast. The Dao companions pre-arranged by the Joyful Union Hall haven't arrived yet."

"Perhaps Junior Brother could wait a few days?"

Lu Yang, of course, didn't care about the Dao companion. He immediately cupped his hands and said, "I'll leave it all to Senior Brother's arrangements."

Liu Xin burst into laughter, then took out a jade slip and handed it to Lu Yang. "This is the Heaven-Mending Peak's secret transmitted True Art. Take it back and cultivate diligently."

Lu Yang took the jade slip and immediately activated his spiritual sense to examine it.

The next second, an extremely complex cultivation method appeared in his mind.
