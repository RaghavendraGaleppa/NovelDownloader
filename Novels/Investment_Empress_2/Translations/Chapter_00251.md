# Chapter 251: An Injustice Witnessed, The Mooncake Brother?

**Name:** Lu Fuying
**Age:** 8
**Root Bone:** None.
**Realm:** Mortal.
**Fate:** Black.
**Evaluation:** Like duckweed on the water, like wild grass in the wind.
**Recent Encounter:** Saved by Ying Bing during labor, but is about to become an unjust soul under the blade due to the crime of consorting with demons.

This was the information Li Mo had just seen through his Eyes of Fate.

He was momentarily stunned, and an inexplicable anger surged in his heart.

Aren't the Garrison Troops supposed to guard the peace of the region?

At the very least, along the way from the Southern Pass, this was the first time he had witnessed such a thing.

He saw the officer, who was leisurely walking up to Lu Fuying with a teacup in hand.

The officer's gaze was not looking at a living person:

"Since you are young and ignorant, I shall show leniency. I will ask you one last time."

"The woman you saw that day—was she human, or demon?"

The little girl, barely ten years old and as thin as a sprout, was full of fear. She was too young to understand the subtext.

"That beautiful big sister is... is she a fairy?"

"She's on the brink of death and still defending the demon."

The officer snorted coldly. The tea splashed onto the executioner's sword nearby, but it couldn't wash away the dried bloodstains.

The executioner's eyes were lifeless. He raised the heavy blade, ready to add another unjust soul to the count.

*Ding—*

However, as the blade fell, a light sound rang out.

The front half of the blade snapped off directly, spinning as it flew away.

The officer, completely unaware, suddenly felt his head go light. He looked up in a mess, only to realize his hat had been knocked off by the broken blade.

The object that had shattered the executioner's sword landed in front of the stunned little girl.

A gold bean.

She looked up in a daze to see a handsome youth standing before her. He looked somewhat familiar, but she couldn't remember where she had seen him.

The youth turned to the bald monk beside him:

"Take her to her family."

Fuying forgot to cry. She was picked up by Murang Xiao and carried away.

At this moment, the soldiers below the platform also reacted. One group rushed toward the officer, while another surrounded Li Mo.

"Disturbing the execution, rescuing a major criminal, and even attempting to kill this official."

"He must be a cohort of the great demon!"

The officer, who had just been cowering in fear, suddenly seemed to gain some confidence. He straightened his back as he spoke.

Li Mo really felt like punching him to death.

Through the Eyes of Fate, this man was no good person.

But he couldn't just wipe out all the Garrison Troops here.

"You are stationed here; surely you have a way to distinguish between humans and demons."

Li Mo patiently reasoned with them:

"Days ago, the person Lu Fuying came into contact with was not a demon. I have a way to prove it."

As everyone knew, Student Li Mo was usually a gentleman.

A gentleman uses his mouth, not his fists.

Unless he uses a hammer.

"So you know that woman?" The officer narrowed his eyes.

Li Mo's brow relaxed slightly: "Naturally, I know her."

The officer's face sank instantly:

"This person just admitted to being a cohort of the demoness. Capture him! Dead or alive, it doesn't matter!"

Li Mo: "?"

The Garrison Troops immediately gripped their spears and swarmed forward.

Demons and exotic beasts usually possess physical strength greater than that of human cultivators of the same realm.

However, if the thousand Garrison Troops of Baoping Town formed a formation and concentrated their power onto the Inner Scene expert at the Observation of the Divine realm, they could handle a Sixth-Rank Great Demon, equivalent to an Inner Scene expert.

These soldiers were all at the Internal Breath Realm. A rough count showed dozens of them. Forming a military formation to deal with an Observation of the Divine expert was no problem.

But that was limited to ordinary Observation of the Divine experts.

Li Mo didn't even use any other methods.

With his current physique and the killing intent inherent in the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body, he just clenched his fist and threw a casual strike. The immense force was something the military formation could not withstand.

*Clang—*

---

A deafening sound echoed. The squad leader at the forefront, at the Profound Pill Realm, let out a muffled groan as the power he had condensed was shattered by a single punch.

The Qi mechanisms were linked, so the shock they received was also shared.

At this moment.

Having shattered the formation, Li Mo stepped forward, shattering the floor tiles, and arrived right before the officer.

"You... you... *Ugh*."

Li Mo kicked the man in the abdomen, silencing his threats.

A certain fighting king once said: If you can fight, don't waste words.

Now it seemed, there was indeed some truth to that.

"You... do you know who is stationed here... %￥@##%"

The officer was beaten to his knees. However, used to throwing his weight around, he still wanted to threaten him.

But he didn't finish his sentence.

His greasy face was smashed in, and his teeth shattered all over the ground.

Student Li Mo had given him a chance to reason, but unfortunately, the man didn't take the opportunity.

The officer lay on the ground, not daring to speak another word.

Li Mo didn't leave. He sat down on the nanmu chair and waited quietly.

A moment later, a line of more elite Garrison Troops arrived, fully armed and radiating fierce energy.

A terrifying aura locked onto him from afar.

It was the middle-aged general at the very front.

The middle-aged general had salt-and-pepper hair and a mustache. His sharp gaze seemed as if it could pierce through the youth before him.

"Who are you? Do you know the crime of assaulting the Southern Border Army?"

He had intended to capture the man directly.

But seeing the youth's age, it was far too young.

To be so young and yet break a formation capable of taking down an Observation of the Divine expert without a scratch... perhaps he had a considerable background.

"What is the duty of the border army?"

"Is it to treat human lives as grass and bully children?"

Li Mo's eyes flashed with a dark light, his expression blank.

"I am asking you a question. How dare you question me?"

Commander Qi was amused by the anger, his face turning cold.

Seeing his backing arrive, the officer scrambled over. Li Mo didn't bother stopping him, letting the officer say with feigned bravery:

"You reviewed the case file yourself. The facts are crystal clear."

"Commander, this man is definitely involved with the demon clan. I believe he is in league with that demoness!"

Commander Qi, the man called the Town Guard, was about to give the order.

However, the next instant, he swallowed his words and gave the officer a heavy slap across the face.

The officer was struck dumb.

He looked back to see the youth holding a token in his hand.

The jet-black token bore a single character: 'Zhong'.

It was given to him by Zhong Zhenyue the day Li Mo saved him. It allowed him to pass through any border army garrison in the Southern Frontier without obstruction.

Although Li Mo was in a hurry to travel, he didn't have time to meet with Zhong Zhenyue.

"Any other questions?"

"I believe this case must have hidden details."

Commander Qi broke out in a cold sweat and agreed readily.

This was clearly Zhong Zhenyue's token. He wouldn't dare say for a hundred胆子 (courage) that the young marquis's honored guest had any connection to the demon clan.

Even if there were, he had to pretend he saw nothing.

"And that little girl?"

"She has absolutely no connection to the demon clan!"

This unjust case was suddenly resolved with astonishing efficiency.

Murang Xiao was dumbfounded, while Huang Donglai revealed a bitter smile.

After the officer was dragged away, Commander Qi even warmly invited Li Mo and his party to a banquet, completely forgetting that he had disrupted the execution.

The laws and logic of the Great Yu were not as useful as this single token.

Li Mo felt it was absurd.

Unwilling to entangle himself with the man further, he walked into the crowd.

Li Mo wiped Lu Fuying's dirty little face:

"Little sister, when did you see that fairy sister?"

"You're the Mooncake Brother?!"

The little girl's answer left Student Li Mo stunned.
