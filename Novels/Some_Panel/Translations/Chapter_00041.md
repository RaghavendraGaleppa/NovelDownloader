## Chapter 41: Fire Aspect Sword Intent II

Yang Ji frowned, watching the projection again and again, his mind constantly replaying and comprehending, muttering to himself.

"This sword is very overbearing. When a single sword strike is unleashed, the sword qi is like a wildfire spreading across the plains, unstoppable."

[You've greatly enlightened; sword qi is like a wildfire spreading. Sword Art proficiency +1.]

"Hmm?" Yang Ji suddenly paused, incredulous. "I've previously contemplated countless directions—sharp sword dao, overbearing sword qi, and so on—but those were only minor enlightenments. Now, this 'fire' is a great enlightenment?"

"Could it be that the 'momentum of fire' is the most crucial intent hidden within this sword?"

[You've greatly enlightened; the sword is a Fire Aspect. Sword Art proficiency +1.]

"Another great enlightenment?" Yang Ji's heart trembled with excitement. "It seems I've truly grasped the right direction! Fire Aspect, Fire Aspect! It seems this sword dao projection is related to fire. Although it doesn't have the explicit appearance of scorching flames, it captures the 'momentum of fire'—the roar of a wildfire, the power of a raging inferno sweeping across the heavens."

Yang Ji instantly understood, a sudden realization dawning on him. "Yes, yes! Before, I only saw the overbearing nature of this sword, thinking its hidden intent was 'dominance.' Little did I know, it was the 'momentum of fire' that this sword embodied which bestowed upon it this boundless dominance."

"I only perceived the superficial appearance, failing to see the true profundity. No wonder, no wonder! I always felt like something was missing before, but couldn't pinpoint what it was. It turns out I hadn't grasped the true intent."

"If I hadn't enlightened in the correct direction, my 'golden finger' wouldn't have displayed this information. Otherwise, how could I have imagined that the true intent hidden within this sword was actually the Fire Aspect? Even if the Fire Aspect had emerged in my mind without the golden finger's prompt, I probably would have delved deeply into it."

"This is truly too difficult! No wonder among so many excellent disciples in Canglan Sect, only Li Changxiao managed to comprehend even half a move. Without sword dao scriptures, relying solely on a sword dao projection to comprehend the hidden momentum of the Fire Aspect is simply too hard."

Yang Ji was exhilarated at this moment. He could feel that after grasping this deeper Fire Aspect, and then thoroughly reviewing the sword dao projection from beginning to end, he would soon achieve complete enlightenment and truly comprehend a full move or even half a move.

He knew that today's great enlightenment was by no means accidental. Rather, it was the result of over a year of tireless contemplation, which had allowed him to touch upon the core secret of this sword. This was the outcome of his diligent efforts combined with his 'golden finger'.

Indeed, cultivation didn't have that many sudden enlightenments; they were all manifestations of accumulated effort and the collision of inspiration at the right moment.

Yang Ji was delighted. If he could comprehend it, then this sword move would become his current strongest killing technique.

Immediately, he quickly reined in his thoughts and began to fully organize and comprehend.

***

Five such days passed consecutively.

It was night again, another day.

Beneath the full moon, by the sea cliff.

Yang Ji stood against the wind, his mind echoing with that single sword strike from the sword dao projection—the one that, once unleashed, swept across a thousand li.

Yang Ji stood quietly, allowing the sea wind to buffet him and the ocean waves to roar.

His mind remained completely focused, hundreds of thoughts revolving in an instant, all flashing with images of that sword strike.

He stood there like that, for an unknown duration.

Suddenly, he opened his eyes.

The flickering sword dao projection in his eyes rapidly shrunk, delving deep into his pupils, quickly condensing into a transparent, sword-shaped rune that was deeply imprinted in the depths of his soul.

At this moment, Yang Ji knew that he had finally condensed the intent from the sword dao projection. Although it was very transparent and faint, he knew he had entered the initial stage.

[Fire Aspect Sword Intent condensed, one part.]

"One part of sword intent? The intent hidden in this move is the Fire Aspect, but I don't know the name of this move. Still, I know it's incredibly powerful!"

With a sudden roar, Yang Ji's entire body erupted with sword qi, and the sword intent rune in his mind vibrated wildly.

When his aura reached its peak, an inexplicable intent spread outwards from him as its center.

Within the range of the intent's radiation, the air began to violently vibrate as if boiling, and under the influence of this intent, it transformed into numerous tiny flying swords.

Yang Ji's gaze swept across them, and those tiny flying swords became as violent as raging flames. With a whistle, they surged towards a millstone-sized stone in front of him, instantly splitting it in two, then into four, then into eight, pulverizing it into dust in an instant.

"The Fire Aspect Sword Intent is too strong, too overbearing! Just imbuing it into the air gives it such power, capable of shattering stones and taking lives. If imbued into spiritual energy and unleashed with a flying sword, how much more powerful would it be?"

Two sharp sword lights suddenly flashed in Yang Ji's eyes. He rose sharply from the ground, soaring ten zhang into the air, and then furiously slashed a sword downwards.

*Shing!*

A vast and brilliant arc of sword qi streaked across the sky, instantly tearing through the air. It was like a wildfire licking dry grass, instantly spreading across the plains—overbearing and unstoppable. In the blink of an eye, it plunged into the sea.

With a thunderous roar, the sword qi surged forward for a li, splitting the sea into two and sending waves ten zhang high.

This sword strike was sharp and overbearing, the strongest he could unleash as a ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivator.

He was quite satisfied with this sword strike, but the Golden Abacus, who was flying over mid-air, was utterly astonished.

"Brother Dao, your sword strike..."

The Golden Abacus looked at the sea surface torn apart by the sword qi, then back at Yang Ji, his eyes wide with disbelief. "You... you comprehended that sword strike from the sword dao projection?"

***

"You're truly a genius! In the entire Canglan Sect, only Senior Brother Li Changxiao was able to comprehend that sword strike. You actually managed it too?"

"With this sword strike, are you still worried about not being able to leave the island?"

"If Mang Biao knew, he'd have to kneel down and respectfully ask you to leave."

Yang Ji said, surprised, "That exaggerated?"

"Exaggerated? Not at all." The Golden Abacus took a deep breath, scanned Yang Ji up and down again, and then continued,

"Do you know what this sword strike signifies? It means you are now a prospective disciple of Grandmaster Jian Yuanzi."

"Grandmaster Jian Yuanzi is the foremost expert below the Soul Transformation realm in the entire Thousand Island Sea. He walks the path of a Sword Immortal, and his strength far surpasses True Monarchs of the same rank."

"As his disciple, who would dare to bully you?"

"If Mang Biao knew, he'd have to come and kneel before you right now."

The more the Golden Abacus spoke, the more fervent his gaze became. "Brother Dao, your backing is truly formidable! When you enter the sect later, please take good care of your little brother."

"Nothing is confirmed yet; I wouldn't dare presume to be his disciple." Yang Ji shook his head. He wouldn't dare offend or casually speculate on the will of such a powerful expert. He knew his place.

"Also, don't spread this matter everywhere, and especially don't tell Mang Biao," Yang Ji sternly cautioned.

This sword represented that esteemed individual. If he were to flaunt it everywhere and show off, potentially incurring displeasure, let alone becoming a disciple, his own situation might become even worse.

If, after three years, Mang Biao still refused to let him leave, then it wouldn't be too late to reveal this "immortal's backing."

But as for what might happen within these three years, who could say?

The Golden Abacus looked at him for a moment, then said with a solemn expression, "Alright, I swear I won't tell another soul."

"Mm!" Yang Ji nodded. Suddenly, his gaze drifted towards the sea, and the sight that met his eyes instantly made his pupils contract. "That's..."
