# Chapter 226: Following the Main Force to Pan for Gold

Kunling, the entire region was expanding, its area growing significantly. Now, across the vast, dark lands, the most talked-about subject in communications between different cities was Kunling.

From the disappearance of the Ancestral Masters, to the glow of the auspicious beast's blood in the black mist, then the revival of specters, and the sporadic appearance of ancient scriptures—it had truly become a matter of global attention. Different groups had different feelings. Dynasties and great sects were wary, even fearful, for they had come to understand the truth of that region. What if Jade Capital reappeared? How would they respond? Back then, even the creatures described in the "Kunling Deity Records" had fled because of that city. As for the common folk, they had also been shocked and scared, but with the passage of time, they gradually accepted it. In fact, many were growing excited and flocking there, all wanting to "pan for gold," as more and more valuable items were appearing.

Qionghua City, a colossal city on the border of the Great Yu Dynasty, shone like a brilliant pearl under the night sky. Qin Ming and Little Wu had returned, retreating from the frontline town to this place. They hadn't known enough about the Kunling region and had nearly met with an accident. They needed to do their homework thoroughly in this bustling city and even considered no longer being lone rangers. As far as they knew, none of the core disciples from the Outer Realm or the Esoteric Sect had reportedly died suddenly.

"Rogue cultivator Qi Zhaohui entered from the direction of Great Yu, unexpectedly discovered the blood of an auspicious beast, and is said to have undergone nirvana that very day, his strength greatly increasing—it's truly enviable!" Throughout the city, the latest news was being discussed everywhere. People's faces showed longing when they spoke of these opportunities and blessings.

Qin Ming and Little Wu each clutched a string of "turtle nectar candies," walking and eating along the bustling main street. Soon, they entered a teahouse, places known for the most up-to-date information. Sure enough, both rogue cultivators and great sects were sparing no effort in organizing various teams for exploration.

"People from the Outer Realm's Yang Earth and Earthen Realms have joined forces. Many are advancing from the direction of the Great Rui Dynasty, targeting some ancient architectural areas." It was said that in such regions, scriptures would resonate on their own, shining brightly beneath the ruins and revealing characters. "However, such places are infested with monsters and are extremely dangerous."

"Why do I feel like these are all honeyed traps, luring us to go, to plow through the Kunling region, and further unseal something?"
"The higher-ups indeed have such suspicions!"
Nevertheless, all parties couldn't resist the temptation and set out, because whether in the Yin Earth or the ruins, there were opportunities that were simply irresistible.

It was rumored that a young master from the Esoteric Sect had obtained a secret tome in an underground palace, far surpassing ordinary secret manuals, which detailed various secrets on the path to godhood. This matter made some of the Esoteric Sect's masters unable to sit still; they personally entered the fray. Not only that, the emergence of the Yin Earth and the revival of monsters were opportunities in themselves for some old cultivators. Those vengeful spirits that devoured human flesh and spirit were confirmed to be humans who had taken a different path. They were targeted by some elders with limited lifespans, who were very eager.

"Do you think all those who attack you are ghost cultivators? You're wrong. Some are normal people impersonating them." Currently, the Kunling region was in utter chaos; it was impossible to distinguish between humans and specters. Some had infiltrated, secretly exploring the ghost path and even masquerading as ghosts.

Qin Ming and Little Wu exchanged glances. It was indeed necessary to return to this border city to understand the latest developments.

The teahouse was large, with gleaming tables and chairs, offering both private rooms and open areas. It was bustling now, with many people willing to gather and exchange information.

A middle-aged man spoke, "I advise everyone not to act alone. Follow the big powers, and you'll get meat. Go solo, and you're just delivering meat to the ghosts!"
Someone next to him poured tea, humbly and politely asking why he said so.
The middle-aged man said, "It's obvious. How can an individual compare to a major power? They have abundant manpower, and they've already roughly mapped out the terrain, knowing generally where it's dangerous and where it's passable."
"They're that efficient?" Many people were surprised.
"That doesn't include the Kunling heartland." Even so, it was astonishing enough. Following them was indeed far better than blindly venturing alone.

At the same time, some also revealed how the major powers obtained opportunities and why they were far more efficient than ordinary people. "If an Ancestral Master were to enter, facing those ruined palaces and broken temples, they would just directly pierce through them. What does it matter what specters are there? Even if a Ghost Ancestor from the Yin Earth emerged, they would have no fear." Of course, it was hard to say how many Ancestral Masters were left now, and they had little interest in ordinary opportunities, being more concerned with whether Jade Capital would emerge.

"Normal large organizations combine old and young, working together. This yields the best results," someone explained how the great sects operated. In those ruins, there were specters of various levels: some slept in the underground Yin Earth, while others seemed to be slumbering within small, overlapping spaces. Different levels of "blood sacrifices" would awaken different levels of monsters. Therefore, to avoid high-level combatants having to fight to the death, some large organizations dispatched powerful young people to scour underground palaces, ruined halls, and other such places. They were all outstanding disciples, and most of the "small ghosts" they provoked could be dealt with on their own. The elder cultivators were responsible for holding the line nearby, ready to act if any unexpected situations arose.

In many ruins, when the young people tried to escape with their "opportunities," accidents would occur. Old ghosts in the Yin Earth or special spaces, even if not interested in these "blood sacrifices," would sometimes revive and intercept them. If such a crisis arose, the elders would quickly move to block them, allowing for an organized retreat and coordinated combat, rarely resulting in significant casualties.

Many lone rangers were speechless upon hearing this. It was simply too unfriendly to them; it seemed difficult to thrive in the Kunling region without joining a major organization.

A young man spoke, "Why do I increasingly feel like this is deliberately arranged by an invisible hand, giving opportunities to future generations and prompting them to explore diligently?" He wasn't the only one suspicious; many shared similar views. Some monsters even carried secret manuals, and occasionally, priceless secret tomes were unearthed in ruined halls and underground palaces—the temptation was immense. It was precisely because of this that vast numbers of people came to "pan for gold."

"Regarding these matters, there are two conjectures," an old man stated. One reason was that this region was originally a trial ground in ancient times. To Jade Capital, these were nothing at all. The other conjecture was that an invisible hand deliberately arranged this, waiting for future generations to excavate until Jade Capital emerged.

After leaving the teahouse, Little Wu complained, "How boring! Rogue cultivators have no freedom, and even if you join an exploration team organized by a major power, you're just cannon fodder. I feel like those few who leaked inside information were all shills!" Qin Ming also nodded, saying, "Most likely, the large organizations are recruiting people, so they're deliberately publicizing this way." But he was still interested, preparing to inquire widely and understand thoroughly, because with his special resonance ability, he might gain significant rewards. Furthermore, being a lone ranger was also feasible for him, but he needed a complete understanding of the region's situation. If he were to temporarily intrude into an ancient hall, resonate with scriptures for a short period, and not take the texts, he might not alarm any old ghosts to intercept him.

Indeed, after staying in the city for two days, they found that all major powers were recruiting, and the conditions seemed favorable.

"Little Wu, don't get involved!" Qin Ming planned to join a team himself to explore. If he went and seized the opportunity, he could indeed gain great rewards. He believed it wouldn't be worth it for Little Wu to take such risks.
Wu Yaozu shook his head, "Brother Ming, what are you saying? If we go, we go together!"
Qin Ming had a headache. Some things simply couldn't be spoken aloud. His resonance ability, if leaked, would likely lead to old cultivators from all paths performing soul searches on him.

The two lingered in Qionghua City for several days, gathering more information, and finally targeted a few organizations with relatively decent reputations. What was considered a good reputation, of course, was relative. For example, a certain faction of the Esoteric Sect had a higher survival rate each time, but it only remained around seventy percent. Naturally, there were also those who faked it, daring to claim that eighty percent of their team returned, even if the entire team was nearly wiped out.

Qin Ming's first stop was to sign up with that Esoteric Sect faction, but he was miserably rejected. Afterwards, he switched to another one. "Little brother, are you on the Path of Rebirth? I'm sorry, we have enough people here." The other party politely declined again. Because of different paths, discrimination was everywhere. "Here, we need those who have cultivated Consciousness Lumina, who can retrieve scriptures and exotic treasures from a distance and then swiftly escape." These were the better ones, at least telling the truth. As for some organizations, they accepted everyone without question, clearly taking in those on the Path of Rebirth to serve as cannon fodder, to cover their retreat.

Subsequently, Qin Ming changed his strategy. When introducing himself, he first mentioned that he was a divine archer, hitting every shot without fail. This time, he sought to join the City Lord's Mansion. Pan Yutong, the direct daughter of Qionghua City's City Lord, was personally selecting people, but Qin Ming was rejected again. She had a graceful figure and a gentle expression. "I'm sorry," she said, "we already have a divine archer here, renowned as Qionghua's foremost divine marksman. The team temporarily doesn't need so many archers."

Qin Ming didn't want to waste words either. He turned and walked towards the opposite side, where a young man and woman, reportedly nobles from the Great Yu Imperial Capital, were seated. "I am an Outer Saint, unparalleled in archery. If you give me jade-iron arrows, I can slay all ghost entities of the same level!" This time, Qin Ming greatly exaggerated his claim. Otherwise, he wouldn't even be able to join teams with better reputations.

Indeed, the two became interested. Zhao Wencheng and Zhao Wenqian were siblings, truly nobles from the imperial capital. Furthermore, they stated directly that they were working for someone even more distinguished. The two asked Qin Ming to demonstrate his archery skills. The result left them stunned. While others aimed to shoot down birds, the youth before them fired a rapid volley of arrows, giving a bird a "bald head." Moreover, after the arrow feathers reached a certain height, they were shredded by the internalized Skyglow Force, the arrowheads turning into iron filings, and the wooden shafts into fine powder. This way, even if they fell, they wouldn't harm anyone in the city. Although Qin Ming hadn't yet stepped into the Outer Saint realm, he was already capable of emitting Skyglow.

"Excellent archery, truly divine!" Zhao Wencheng praised.
"Ah, that looks like the princess's four-winged bird! Oh no, it's a messenger!" Zhao Wenqian exclaimed in alarm. She recognized the trembling four-winged bird; she was quite familiar with it.
"Heavens, Zhao Wenqian, you hired someone to kill me! I'm going to ask the princess to intervene!" Without a doubt, the startled four-winged bird inadvertently exposed the person behind the Zhao siblings.
"It's a misunderstanding!" The two quickly tried to communicate with it. This was a messenger bird highly favored by the Great Yu Fourth Princess. It was about a foot long, entirely crimson, with golden jewel-like eyes, possessing two pairs of wings, and extremely fast flight.

"And you, you executioner..." The four-winged bird was furious, touching its bald head with one wing, its eyes practically spitting fire as it glared at the archer. Inadvertently, Qin Ming plucked his bowstring. Immediately, the angry little bird rolled its eyes and fainted from fright. Finally, it was quiet.

Zhao Wencheng lowered his voice and said, "Brother, you know our strength now, right? You must have heard of the Great Yu Fourth Princess; her talent is heaven-defying, like an immortal deity reincarnated."
Qin Ming was surprised. He had indeed heard of this woman; her reputation was truly great, and he knew that she had renamed herself Yao Ruoxian. It was said that her innate talent was extraordinary, naturally suited for the Immortal Path, but she had not entered the Outer Realm. The Great Yu Dynasty was a behemoth, naturally possessing countless resources: cultivation methods, exotic treasures, and powerful elixirs. Yao Ruoxian's cultivation was astonishing, comparable to the most formidable immortal seeds, even stronger than her brother who had entered the Outer Realm.

Zhao Wenqian said, "Every time you go on an expedition, you'll receive three hundred Day-Gold coins. If you gain anything in the ruins, your share won't be less; it's absolutely fair."
"Good!" Qin Ming nodded in agreement.

As for Little Wu, he watched longingly, but Qin Ming held him back, not wanting him to go on the adventure. Qin Ming comforted him, "Let me scout the way first. If there are no problems, you can sign up later."

The next day, Qin Ming set out, once again entering the black mist-shrouded Kunling region.
Zhao Wencheng said, "Based on our experience, a team should not exceed ten people. Otherwise, even if they are all young, not profound elderly cultivators, too much vital energy gathered together might attract old ghosts." He and Zhao Wenqian had both come, but they had no intention of going deep. Instead, they were seeing off several teams. The two had formed a total of four teams, each with nine members. And behind each team, several elders followed, truly a "mix of old and young." Those elders were all people of the Fourth Princess Yao Ruoxian. They had pretty much explored this side of Kunling, and indeed, after entering, there were no surprises; they headed straight for their target.

Like an old horse knowing the way, with escorts protecting them, the team advanced at an extremely fast pace. In the early stages, there was no danger at all; they took paths through the safest areas. Qin Ming was astonished. Their destination was a rather vast ruin, with a magnificent grand palace at its very core. Black mist swirled. The ruined palaces there had silver tiles. Imagining it back then, this place must have been incredibly grand. What they needed to do was clear out the ruined halls along the way. Today, their target was only one half-collapsed building, of a considerable size.

As they advanced, Qin Ming noticed that the grand palace in the core area was steaming with purple qi, while also filled with an impenetrable, bone-chillingly dense Yin energy. Moreover, with even the slightest disturbance, the Yin energy there would surge skyward; it was truly abnormal. "The central grand palace ahead is one of the most important nodes in the Yin Earth. When it's time to clear that place, the Fourth Princess will personally attend."

Soon, Qin Ming and his team stepped over rubble, arriving near the ruined hall. At this moment, he displayed his divine archery skills. Ordinary iron arrows, once shot by him, were enveloped in Skyglow Force, dazzlingly bright. In an instant, five nearly rotten monsters in the ruined hall were struck in the forehead, their skulls shattered, and they fell backward to the ground. Though called specters, they were actually ancient humans who had taken the path of devouring human flesh and spirit, like vengeful ghosts.

"Good archery!" someone praised. Afterwards, the others also began to act, entering the half-collapsed ruined hall to search for exotic treasures, scriptures, and the like. As a result, several more specters rushed out and immediately engaged them in battle. They had just burst out from the underground Yin Earth, and their strength was considerable. Instantly, the team sustained casualties. Qin Ming bent his bow and shot arrows. Even so, four members of their team died; the monsters in the black mist were impossible to guard against. Moreover, he didn't want to stand out too much. If he could save someone, he naturally would, but asking him to risk his life by rushing into a dangerous area to desperately save strangers—their acquaintance wasn't that deep.

Ultimately, the five of them retreated. There were surprisingly no scriptures or exotic treasures here; they found nothing. Even so, as they retreated, they drew out two old ghosts, who pursued them out of the ruined hall. Soon, the elder cultivators holding the line at the rear stepped forward and jointly annihilated them.

For Qin Ming, the first day was uneventful. With someone leading the way and elders holding the line, it was simply too safe.

"Brother Ming, next time I'll go with you!" Little Wu said that evening.
Qin Ming shook his head, saying, "When they go to search for the auspicious beast's blood, I'll take you along. There's no need now; there aren't many opportunities there."

After dinner, Qin Ming felt wisps of heat gradually turn scalding hot within his body. After several days of accumulation, he was about to trigger a physical transformation on his own. He didn't hesitate, beginning to refine the demon seed he held and cultivate the "Imperishable Butterfly Scripture." He wanted his final rebirth and the miraculous art to complete simultaneously. That night, Qin Ming's body ruptured multiple times. Refining a demon seed was inherently like this, subject to repeated backlash. At the same time, the new vital energy in his flesh and blood was dense, undergoing intense changes. By dawn, Qin Ming's final rebirth was completely finished, and he had simultaneously mastered his eighth miraculous art!

Without a doubt, his physique was elevated yet another notch. Most crucially, with the addition of another miraculous art, his Skyglow Force underwent a qualitative change, which was the fundamental source of his increased combat power. Now, whenever Qin Ming casually clenched his fist, Skyglow Force naturally flowed, appearing like a miniature sun. He didn't dare to fully unleash his Skyglow Force. He feared that it would surpass his previous limits, producing Skyglow Force even more blinding than the scorching sun, alarming the other guests in the inn. Because, without a doubt, the sight would be astonishing.

According to previous experience, after his eight miraculous arts merged into one, it would be equivalent to the Four Imperial Forces of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court! And at this level, in the First Realm, it seemed no one could achieve this! Not even the founders of the various sects could. Throughout history, Ancestral Masters and their most brilliant successors could at most cultivate the Three Imperial Forces in the First Realm. The most powerful Sky-Shaker of the Heaven-Supporting Sect, and the legendary Golden Body Nirvana practitioner of the Tathagata Gate, all struggled against the Four Imperial Forces!

"In the First Realm, I've finally surpassed the Ancestral Masters!" Qin Ming felt a sense of accomplishment, smiling.

Early in the morning, he left the city because he wanted to verify the power of his eight miraculous arts merged into one. At the same time, he didn't want to leave any hidden dangers, so he intended to repeatedly temper the unified force using the Dragon-Tiger Concoction method. Little Wu followed, witnessing Qin Ming's transformation throughout, utterly stunned.

In the deep mountains and dense forests, Qin Ming's aura was even more terrifying than before. The merged Skyglow Force condensed like actual fragments of the sun. Qin Ming threw a punch, carving a large hole straight through the mountain wall. The next moment, five-colored divine light swirled around his body, accompanied by a flourishing three-colored auspicious mist. All eight miraculous arts each formed a wondrous phenomenon, transforming into immortal divine rings, protecting him within. As he condensed Skyglow Force, a large spear appeared in his hand. When he wielded it, it seemed capable of splitting the cliffs here. Next, the great spear transformed into a long blade. The eight-colored blade seemed to merge with him as he wielded it, rising from the ground, shooting forth like a bolt of lightning. Finally, Qin Ming stopped, repeatedly tempering his force using the Dragon-Tiger Concoction method, perfectly integrating all Skyglow Force, and unifying his eight miraculous arts. He had a feeling that in a few more days, without needing to consume any great elixirs, he would naturally be able to step into the Outer Saint realm.

Little Wu exclaimed, "Brother Ming, you're a bit absurd in the First Realm! You've truly reached the extreme limit, remolding myths, with you as the peak!" He felt that in the First Realm, he was completely incomparable to Qin Ming. Afterwards, he sighed, "I've also undergone all sorts of tempering recently, thoroughly making up for my shortcomings, but there's truly no way to improve further. I'll just wait for you in the Second Realm, and then we can measure ourselves against each other." As he spoke, he directly entered the Second Realm, with dazzling bright light bursting forth around his body.

Qin Ming had long known that there was something peculiar about him, that he was stronger than his displayed abilities. After all, Little Wu was the sole heir of the Fourth Desolate Land; his talent was definitely no weaker than an immortal seed's. He had been cultivating for over a decade, so how could he still be in the First Realm?!

On this day, Zhao Wencheng announced a rest day, with no further exploration. In fact, the four teams he and Zhao Wenqian had formed needed reinforcements. That day, Qin Ming and Little Wu heard many new pieces of information. In the direction of the Great Rui Dynasty, the cultivators from the Outer Realm who had advanced into Kunling had fully united. It was said that multiple immortal seeds had personally joined, because they had discovered an extraordinary ruin. In some grand palaces, golden characters flowed, which was truly astonishing! Furthermore, a faction of the Esoteric Sect, advancing from the direction of the Great Qian Dynasty, also discovered a strange region. Someone else obtained a secret tome, and ancient miraculous arts also emerged. These pieces of news stirred ripples in Qin Ming's heart; he wished he could immediately rush over and explore with them.

Over the next dozen or so days, Qin Ming and his team went on an expedition every other day, finally clearing out that ruined area. They were now ready to go to the central grand palace. It could be said that almost all the people he had initially known had been replaced. Some quit after just one entry, while the rest had died.

"You really are a divine archer?" Pan Yutong's expression was complex. For the last expedition, about to head to the central grand palace, she had also come, similarly serving the Fourth Princess. Zhao Wencheng also arrived, preparing to go along and enter the central grand palace. In recent days, they had cleared those ruined halls but gained nothing. However, those elders were full of confidence regarding the central grand palace. Originally, Qin Ming didn't intend to get involved, but they offered too much: two thousand Day-Gold coins, plus a miraculous art.

Yao Ruoxian personally arrived, clad in armor, with even her face covered. Only her slender figure could be discerned; her true appearance was hidden. Many masters surrounded her. She was dissuaded by others. For this initial exploration, the elders did not allow her to personally enter the central grand palace. In fact, Qin Ming was unexpectedly not selected. He wasn't chosen during the first selection of the nine-person team, but as a reserve, he still went along.

He wondered if it was an illusion, but when Qin Ming stood near the grand palace, he felt the tattered cloth flutter slightly, which immediately sent a shiver down his spine. This was unprecedented. It actually moved on its own! At the same time, Qin Ming felt it absorbed wisps of Grand Yin Qi overflowing from the central grand palace, and then it vibrated again. However, it did not continue to absorb the Yin Qi.

Meanwhile, in the deepest part of the Kunling region, within layers of strange overlapping spaces, all the disappeared Ancestral Masters were present. At this moment, they were utterly shocked because after breaking through a mysterious region, in an underground cavern, they saw the coffins of quasi-divine beings—not just one, but multiple coffins laid out before them. They even saw a nine-colored altar.

"What is that?!"
On that altar, a piece of tattered cloth was enshrined, seeming even more important than the coffins of deities. An Ancestral Master stirred, wanting to take it into his hand.
