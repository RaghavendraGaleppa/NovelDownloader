# Chapter 209: One Against Two

Seven bone-piercing needles fell with a sound like a tinkling stream. They did not pierce the steel-like body, leaving not a single trace...

"What a perfect fusion of Dragon and Tiger in a physical body!"

The beautiful woman laughed coquettishly as she lifted her bamboo hat, revealing a vermilion mole between her eyebrows. "My Seven-Extreme Pulse-Sealing Needles can break the skin of even a Golden Bell Shield master. I didn't expect..."

Before she could finish, the muscles on Xu Yunfan's body surged like rolling waves. The blood energy rising within him erupted like a blast furnace, instantly dispelling the chill in the ruined temple and silencing the woman.

The smile remained on her face, but her expression visibly turned grave.

The moment the seven bone-piercing needles hit the ground, the old man's heavy sword had already劈开 (split) the temple door.

The five-foot-seven-inch玄铁 (titanium steel) blade tore through the humid air, the eighteen blood grooves on the sword spine emitting a wailing shriek.

Xu Yunfan's right foot retreated half a step. The fascia of his foot arch tensed like a drawn bowstring, and the blue brick ground instantly cracked like a spiderweb for three feet.

"Take this!"

The trajectory of the heavy sword suddenly twisted. With a turn of the old man's wrist, he unleashed the "Three Waves of Force." The first force shook the beams, causing dust to fall; the second hidden force targeted the Tanzhong acupoint; and the third blade edge deflected three inches to slash at the youth's right neck.

This was the "Against the Current Three Waves" from the Northern Broken River Sword Sect, a method specifically designed to break masters of hard body training. Combined with this titanium steel greatsword, it was a match made in heaven.

*Interesting...*

Xu Yunfan's eyes deepened, and his movements did not hesitate in the slightest. Suddenly, a sound like metal rubbing against metal came from his spine and shoulder blades. The latissimus dorsi muscles, driven by the Hundred Tempered Steel Body, shifted like tectonic plates, clamping the blade firmly within the gap of his muscles.

The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength climbed segment by segment along his spine. The muscle fibers of his right arm twisted into nine spiral forces. When the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swept up from below, the airwaves wrapping the hammer head tore apart all the cobwebs hanging from the beams.

*Clang!*

The sparks from the hammer and sword collision illuminated the old man's astonished face.

"How is this possible? You are only at the Muscle Refining stage..."

The eighty-seven-pound titanium steel sword was actually shaken upward by the hammer. The dragon-patterned decoration on the sword's pommel was crushed by the immense force against the old man's tiger's mouth, drawing a trail of blood and causing him pain.

Xu Yunfan's left foot arch suddenly expanded, his heel crushing the earth and stone. Using the rebound force, he spun and swung his hammer.

The third stance of the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method, "Wave Upon Wave Shattering the Mountain," combined with the torque of his waist and hips. The hammer shadow swept toward the old man's ribs in a crescent arc.

At that moment, the beautiful woman's Red Steel Bone Joint Whip shot out like a snake.

The nine-jointed ghost-devouring iron rings precisely clamped onto the hammer handle, while the whip tip's bone-piercing needle stabbed toward the Quchi acupoint.

This move, the "Locking the Dragon Style," was a unique technique of the East River Capturing Dragon Dock. Combined with her cultivated Yin-Soft Silk Strength, it had once twisted apart the body of a Blood Transformation realm master who specialized in hard body training.

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted like针尖 (needle points).

Facing simultaneous attacks from two Blood Transformation realm experts, the pressure was indeed heavy.

*Thoughts flashed like lightning.*

Xu Yunfan's left hand crossed his chest, forming the Seal of the Lin (Steadiness). He let out a soft shout.

"Lin."

The moment the Lin state activated, the bonfire burning inside the temple seemed to freeze.

Emotions in his eyes rapidly faded into silence. He could see every casting texture on the iron rings of the whip tip; he could hear the sound of the old man's blood droplets that hadn't yet hit the brick floor.

The mechanics of every stance in the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method were deconstructed and reassembled in his mind, flowing through his heart. The shifting amplitude of his shoulder blades was precise to the fraction, and the undulating frequency of his foot arch fascia resonated with his heartbeat.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer suddenly flew from his hand, spinning to jam into the gap of the third iron ring.

Xu Yunfan's arm muscles writhed like a group of pythons. The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength shot through the Governor Vessel to his knuckles. Using the hammer as a chain, he swung the beautiful woman into the air.

The old man was about to attack aggressively, but he saw Xu Yunfan's right leg chop out like a battle-axe. As the toe pointed toward his Dantian, the trouser leg was torn into strips by the explosive force.

The beautiful woman crashed through a hole in the roof and fell. The red whip hadn't been retracted yet when she suddenly saw the hammer head arriving at her face.

She hastily used the Iron Plate Bridge technique to lean back, but she didn't know that the true killing intent of this "Falling Star" lay in the hammer handle. As Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and pushed his shoulder, the hidden麒麟尾 (Qilin tail) at the end of the hammer handle suddenly shot out like a spear tip, aiming straight for her throat.

*Pfft!*

As the blood flower bloomed on the beautiful woman's neck, the old man's heavy sword, carrying the momentum of wind and thunder,劈向 (chopped toward) the youth's back of the head.

Xu Yunfan did not dodge or avoid. The斜方肌 (trapezius muscle), driven by the Hundred Tempered Steel Body,隆起 (bulged) three inches,硬生生 (hardened) to clamp the sword edge between his neck.

The friction between muscle fibers and the blade produced a grating sound that made one's teeth ache, even sparking several points of fire.

The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength completed nine cycles at this moment, and Xu Yunfan's entire skin took on the cold luster of titanium steel.

Only one opponent remained, and the pressure immediately eased.

He abandoned the hammer, his fists striking together like a hammer, like a giant spirit slapping a mountain. The edge of his palm chopped toward the old man's wrist holding the sword.

This move, the "Double Python Scissors," was derived from the clamping technique of blacksmiths. Where his palm wind passed, the old man's sleeve instantly shattered into fluttering cloth butterflies.

The old man retreated seven steps violently, using the momentum to thrust the sword handle toward the youth's chest.

Xu Yunfan actually welcomed the sword, his chest muscles undulating like waves, swallowing the sword handle into a muscle vortex.

The unique force-dissipating technique of the Hundred Tempered Steel Body made the sword handle feel like it had fallen into a swamp. Unable to retract the sword in time, the old man was struck in the nose by the forehead of the youth who had closed in.

The sound of bone cracking hadn't faded when Xu Yunfan had already snatched the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer that hadn't yet hit the ground.

In the Lin state, he precisely controlled the explosive sequence of every muscle bundle. The foot arch fascia initiated the force to transmit the ground's rebound; the waist and hips increased the torque by thirty percent; the shoulder blade shifting divided the force into nine spirals, finally converging onto a single point on the hammer head.

*Stars Falling Across the River.*

The hammer fell like a meteorite crashing to the earth. The moment the old man raised his sword to block, he knew it was bad.

The eighteen blood grooves on the sword spine炸裂 (exploded) simultaneously, and the dark brown blood scabs were震成 (shattered into) powder.

As the heavy sword bent into a bizarre curve, the hammer's force remained undiminished, striking his chest's Tanzhong acupoint squarely.

The old man's black robe on his back轰然 (burst) apart. His spine凸起 (protruded) with nine节 (sections) of fist-print-like indentations. This was the penetrating effect unique to the combination of the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength and the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method.

The beautiful woman struggled to throw out a bone-piercing needle, but she saw Xu Yunfan反手 (backhandedly) throw the hammer.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer spun and shattered three poison needles, its handle tip precisely striking her Qihai acupoint.

As she stumbled to her knees, the youth had already charged over like a war chariot. The action of his right knee thrusting toward her heart cavity brought a sonic boom,震成 (shattering) the remaining Red Steel Bone Joint Whip into flying iron dust.

Suddenly, a rain of blood fell outside the temple. Two muffled sounds rang out in succession. Several puffs of blood mist透出 (seeped) from inside the ruined temple,洒落 (scattering) all over the ground.

Xu Yunfan stepped on the last intact brick of the ruined temple to stop his momentum. He found that the hammer head was still沾着 (stained with) seventeen bloody teeth. That heavy hammer earlier had actually knocked all the old man's teeth out and嵌入 (embedded) them into the hammer surface.

He bent down to tear the old man's lapel and wipe the hammer handle, then suddenly frowned and looked toward the southeast.

The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength sensed an abnormal vibration in the earth's veins. Fifty miles away, in the direction of the Divine Weapon Ridge, at least three teams of heavy cavalry were forming formations.

Quickly withdrawing from the 'Lin state,' Xu Yunfan exhaled a long breath.

In the Lin state, all the power within his body was perfectly utilized to the extreme of what his current body could bear. His hidden potential was constantly and explosively squeezed out, in order to unleash terrifying power far beyond his own level.

That was how he had managed to beat these two Blood Transformation realm experts to death in the blink of an eye.

"Quite a difference from that Tuoba Li..."
