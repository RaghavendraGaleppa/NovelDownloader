# Chapter 73: Roaming Wuhui Peak

Han Yue watched the golden eagle's predicament, barely suppressing his laughter. 

This golden eagle was truly docile—ever since he'd first seen it, he'd never witnessed even a hint of resistance from the creature. From being a mighty demon king of the outer realms, it had been reduced to a mere mount for a first-rank cultivator without so much as a protest.

Yet the golden eagle did serve its purpose. Recalling the deafening noise Wang Mumu's flying sphere had produced earlier, Han Yue realized how unbearable such a disturbance would be during his closed-door cultivation breakthrough. His master had indeed done him a great favor.

"Mumu, I'm looking to establish a cave abode on Wuhui Peak. Any recommendations?" Han Yue had come to Wang Mumu for serious business.

"Uncle-Master, Wuhui Peak is practically deserted. The previous senior brothers all went traveling and rarely return even once in ten years!" Wang Mumu replied. "I've forgotten which caves are occupied already!"

"You could look for a cave where the spirit fruit trees are still alive—that way you'll have daily sustenance. We Shenxiao Palace disciples all rely on the various spirit fruit trees in our caves to survive."

"Though our sect has few members and lax management, some caves have dead trees and aren't habitable anymore."

"Oh! And while there are caves above the clouds, they keep getting struck by lightning—not pleasant living conditions. Be careful about those, Uncle-Master!"

Han Yue was gradually growing accustomed to Shenxiao Palace's extremely lax management style. However, since these external matters didn't affect cultivation, it truly didn't matter. This casual approach only highlighted Shenxiao Palace's bold, unrestrained character!

Bidding farewell to Wang Mumu so as not to disturb her grooming session with the eagle, Han Yue summoned a beam of light and began soaring along Wuhui Peak's mountain range. 

The massive mountain hosted cave abodes every three to five li, all situated in scenic locations brimming with spiritual energy. After circling several times without discerning any particular differences, Han Yue simply chose one that appealed to him and descended.

The cave was nestled at a mountain ridge's summit—literally a cavern carved into the mountainside. Its entrance opened onto a spacious platform completely exposed to sunlight with no obstructions. Three first-grade plum trees grew on this platform, all laden with spirit fruits from years of neglect.

Han Yue plucked one and sampled it. The plum was sweet, fragrant, and delightfully chewy, packed with primal energy and nutrients that greatly benefited the body. A single fruit could sustain him for two days—with these three trees, he could save considerable time foraging.

Entering the cave, he found a surprisingly spacious interior fully equipped for solitary living. All facilities were protected by formations, kept immaculately clean. Skylights provided excellent ventilation and lighting—an ideal retreat for secluded cultivation.

Thoroughly satisfied with his new home where he'd likely reside for some time, Han Yue settled in and began his long-awaited closed-door cultivation session.

So much had happened recently—from successfully forging the Vessel of Inheritance, to the Longevity Master's assessment, to inheriting multiple supreme techniques. These pivotal events concerning his Dao path had come in relentless succession, leaving him no choice but to respond actively. Now, finally, he had time truly his own to quietly reflect and organize his thoughts.

Han Yue scanned his body with divine sense. His magic power brimmed vigorously while his physical form pulsed with vitality. In his dantian, the Demon-Slaying Sword and Dutian Seal bathed in magical energy, continuously exchanging auras. Empowered by these artifacts, the Celestial Origin Treasure Lotus flourished even more magnificently, generating an endless stream of pure primal energy to nourish his entire being!

Over seven hundred Thunder Nurturing runes shimmered brilliantly within him, constantly absorbing primal energy and converting it into magic power. Here on Wuhui Peak, primal energy was ten times more abundant than in the outer realms! Beyond what the Treasure Lotus provided, the Thunder Nurturing runes also drew energy from the environment, further accelerating Han Yue's magical accumulation.

In his heart, the Nectar divine ability worked ceaselessly. The precious Nectar it produced not only nourished Han Yue's body and mind but also ensured the Treasure Lotus received constant external nourishment, enhancing its divine essence. Despite this, Han Yue's internal reserves of precious medicine continued growing daily—all stored within his heart's blood, enveloped by the organ itself.

This massive heart now contained vast quantities of life-giving primal energy and healing elixirs. Though not immediately absorbable, these stimulated his entire body to operate at peak capacity without reservation under the life energy's protection. This kept him perpetually energetic and in optimal condition. In truth, Han Yue could already sustain himself solely on these elixirs, completely independent of food and water.

The most dramatic changes, however, occurred in his sea of consciousness. There, two supreme divine ability talismans shone radiantly, similarly absorbing his primal energy and magic power. Beyond mere absorption, the Thoughtless Slash continuously refined and compressed the quality of his magic power. Meanwhile, an enormous inheritance stele rested at the seabed's depths.

Though the stele weighed down his divine sense, diminishing its agility, this Longevity treasure held boundless wonders! Currently, it recorded eleven foundational cultivation texts—Han Yue's true path of practice:

1. A complete fifth-rank inheritance: The Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetism Longevity Scripture
2. A set of Shenxiao true inheritance body cultivation secrets: Thunder Nurturing Body and Thunder Nurturing Soul
3. Four unique divine abilities cultivatable in the Body Realm: Entangling Thunder Robe, Minor Thunder Sound Technique, Breath Concealment Art, and Primordial Great Hand Seal
4. Four knowledge compendiums: Upper Cavern Nine Heavens Spirit Treasure Secret Record, Shenxiao Palace Inheritance Chronicles & Jade Void Realm Records, Inherited Secret Transmission of Various Divine Ability Studies, and Inherited Answers to Disciples' Questions

These eleven great Dao texts would consume endless time—a mountain of learning Han Yue must ascend. Yet he felt not a shred of fear or impatience. To him, cultivation was pure joy. Even without immediate gains, he had clear goals knowing the great Dao lay ahead. Any lack of progress simply meant his cultivation was insufficient—a realization that only fueled greater determination.

Every morsel of knowledge acquired, no matter how minor, filled Han Yue with immense satisfaction and fulfillment. This very attitude reflected his lucid Dao heart and lofty aspirations. What defined a true inheritor of the great Dao, a seed of longevity? Beyond extraordinary talent, it required unwavering will, temperament, worldview, and emotional control—none could be lacking.

Taking a deep breath, Han Yue immersed his consciousness in this ocean of knowledge and information, gradually becoming enthralled. He'd already resolved not to emerge until he'd thoroughly comprehended these great Dao inheritances!
