# Chapter 77: The Leaping Stream Ravine

Lin Xuan's knowledge of demonic beasts was limited, but he was at least familiar with some basic facts.

A beast talisman crafted from a failed breakthrough attempt by a top-tier first-grade demonic beast?

After realizing the talisman's value, two hundred spirit stones indeed didn't seem like an exorbitant price. Unlike the Ironclad Blazing Tiger talisman whose energy was nearly depleted, this Skysoar Bird talisman was brand new and unused.

Its power was comparable to that of a newly established Foundation Building cultivator, making it highly desirable for Lin Xuan. The problem was, he didn't have enough spirit stones.

"Senior, could you lower the price?"

The old man rolled his eyes. "If you don't have the spirit stones, don't waste my time."

Seeing the man's unyielding attitude, Lin Xuan fell silent for a moment. "Senior, how about this—I'll trade you something for it."

"A trade? What do you have to offer?"

Without answering, Lin Xuan probed his storage ring with his spiritual sense and then extended his hand, revealing an object in his palm.

"This is..."

The old man's gaze was drawn to the item. Resting in Lin Xuan's palm was a three-inch-long object with an ancient design, shaped like a coiled snake—the low-grade spiritual artifact, Fire Serpent, which Lin Xuan had obtained from Ye Tian.

"You want to trade this for my beast talisman?" The old man looked at him with a strange expression. From his reaction, Lin Xuan could tell this man wasn't Tian Yuan. Otherwise, as the top expert of the Talisman Mountain, why would he be interested in a low-grade spiritual artifact? Of course, who he was didn't matter to Lin Xuan—what mattered was that he had something Lin Xuan needed.

In terms of power, the low-grade spiritual artifact was far inferior to the Skysoar Bird talisman. However, the advantage of a spiritual artifact was that it could be used repeatedly, whereas the energy of a beast talisman's spirit was finite. Thus, their values were roughly equivalent—if anything, the spiritual artifact might even be slightly more valuable.

After weighing the trade in his mind and finding it fair, the old man nodded in agreement. As for Lin Xuan, he cared even less—the Fire Serpent was practically useless to him, so trading it for the beast talisman was an excellent deal.

Taking the beast talisman, Lin Xuan examined it carefully, sensing the powerful spiritual energy emanating from it. A flicker of delight crossed his face before he carefully stored it away.

Calculating the time, his Heavenly Demon Disguise Art was about to wear off, and he had already gained much from this trip. With that, Lin Xuan turned and left Talisman Mountain.

Once he descended the mountain, he summoned his flying sword spiritual artifact, transforming into a streak of blue light that vanished into the distant horizon.

Half a day later...

A streak of light descended onto a desolate plain. As the blue radiance dissipated, it revealed a young man around twenty years old.

Night had already fallen. Lin Xuan looked up at the dark mountains in the distance, their silhouettes stretching endlessly under the swaying shadows of trees. The infamous Leaping Stream Ravine lay within.

In the cultivation world of Yanzhou, the Leaping Stream Ravine was notorious as a perilous land. Many demonic beasts made their dens here. But with danger came opportunity—though demonic beasts were fearsome, they were also treasure troves. Their demonic cores could be used to refine elixirs to enhance cultivation, while their fangs, claws, bones, and fur were also highly valuable. Higher-grade materials could even be used to forge spiritual artifacts.

Thus, despite its dangers, cultivators flocked to the Leaping Stream Ravine in droves. "Men die for wealth, birds perish for food"—countless cultivators had met their ends here over the centuries.

Adding to the peril, the headquarters of the Fire Spirit Sect lay just a few dozen miles from the ravine. This made Lin Xuan's journey fraught with danger—not only did he have to contend with demonic beasts, but he also had to evade the hostile sect's hunters.

Since he was already close to the ravine, Lin Xuan didn't rush in recklessly. Instead, he took out a jade vial and sipped a small amount of Crimson Vine Grass liquid to suppress his aura. Then, he found a secluded spot to sit cross-legged and restore his spiritual energy.

An hour later, once his stamina and spiritual power were fully replenished, Lin Xuan cautiously made his way toward the Leaping Stream Ravine. He avoided flying to prevent drawing attention, but even using the Wind Riding Technique, he moved swiftly.

The ravine had a unique terrain with only one entrance. Originally, any cultivator could enter freely, but now, the Fire Spirit Sect had set up layers of restrictive formations to guard it tightly.

The demonic beasts and spirit herbs inside were highly beneficial for cultivation and combat, so the sect couldn't afford to let rival factions freely harvest them.

The entrance was now protected by a formidable formation. Unless one was a Core Formation expert, breaking through by force was impossible. The only way in was through the teleportation array at the entrance.

However, the teleportation array was guarded by several cultivators, some of whom were even at the Foundation Building stage.

Three days passed. The above information was what Lin Xuan had gathered during his reconnaissance. "Know yourself and your enemy, and you will never be defeated." Operating within enemy territory required extreme caution. Fortunately, Lin Xuan hadn't rushed in blindly—otherwise, he would have already been hunted down by the Fire Spirit Sect.

Using the teleportation array would inevitably alert the sect's disciples, but without it, entering the ravine was impossible.

Lin Xuan was stuck in a dilemma. Over the past few days, he had been racking his brain for a solution but had yet to come up with a viable plan.

Thankfully, Lin Xuan's spiritual sense was extraordinarily powerful. Despite being only at the peak of the Qi Condensation stage, his spiritual sense surpassed even that of early-stage Foundation Building cultivators. This was why he could observe the teleportation array undetected.

That evening, as Lin Xuan continued his surveillance, a fiery streak of light appeared on the horizon. Moments later, it descended near the teleportation array.

As the light faded, a middle-aged man around fifty years old stepped out. With a long beard and an air of immortality, he wore the robes of the Fire Spirit Sect.

"Uncle Master!" The sect disciples guarding the array hurried over and bowed respectfully.

"Hm." The man nodded arrogantly.

"Ah, Senior Brother Qian, what brings you here? Are you entering the ravine to gather Star Grass again?"
