# Chapter 87: Heaven's Collapse

Just as the sword qi appeared, Grandmaster Tingyou also looked up at the sword qi that had suppressed him for a millennium, casting him down from the clouds.

The next second, his face suddenly contorted:

"True Monarch, a thousand years! A full millennium!"

"How much longer do you intend to trap me?"

"Do you truly wish to wipe out my Witch-Ghost Dao lineage!?"

His words fell, yet the sword qi in the sky paid him no heed, silently appraising something, as if it could descend and strike at any moment.

Grandmaster Tingyou knew that this was the karma he had obscured during his soul seizure a thousand years ago, still in effect.

However, with his aura completely exposed, it wouldn't be long before the Golden Core Sword Qi fully identified him, then a single sword strike would fly down to claim his life.

"I refuse!"

Thinking this, Grandmaster Tingyou abruptly turned around and looked at Lu Yang: "Today, by borrowing your life, I shall defy heaven and continue my Witch-Ghost Dao lineage!"

As his words fell, Grandmaster Tingyou manipulated the [Yama's Palace], which pressed down with a thunderous roar!

Lu Yang activated the array talismans, once again drawing upon the power of the formation for enhancement. However, this time, no matter what wind, thunder, water, or fire, they could not harm Grandmaster Tingyou in the slightest.

Because a gap in their tiers had emerged.

With the eight great elders in place and the [Yama's Palace] complete, Grandmaster Tingyou's tier had already surpassed Lu Yang's, swiftly approaching the Foundation Establishment realm!

"It's useless. Since you forced me to reveal myself and reassemble the [Yama's Palace], all your methods are insignificant. This supreme divine ability was deduced by all us Foundation Establishment cultivators working together in the past. If nine peak Foundation Establishment cultivators were to take their positions within it, it wouldn't be impossible to temporarily wield the Golden Core rank and fight a True Monarch!"

Grandmaster Tingyou's tone was filled with pride.

Among all the Dao lineages in the world, which one didn't wish to exist for long, which one didn't aspire to reach a higher level? The Witch-Ghost Dao was one such lineage, and it had almost succeeded!

If not for the sect master of the Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion from that generation...

That True Monarch...

That sword qi...

"...Kill!!!"

Grandmaster Tingyou roared, the tier of the [Yama's Palace] still climbing, actually entering the "ascension state" that only appears when breaking through to Foundation Establishment!

"Junior, let me show you the true pinnacle of Qi Condensation."

Grandmaster Tingyou stood high atop the [Yama's Palace], his aura profound and vast, shattering nine Heavenly-Earth Gates in an instant, and stepping into the "Foundation Establishment Realm"!

The next second, Lu Yang's pupils constricted!

Because he had broken through himself, he knew that breaking through to Foundation Establishment consisted of two steps: the first step was ascending to the "Foundation Establishment Realm," and the second step was laying the immortal foundation.

At this moment, Grandmaster Tingyou had completed the first step, ascending into the "Foundation Establishment Realm."

However, he did not choose to lay his immortal foundation.

Instead, he began to—

Fall!

Grandmaster Tingyou stood in the "Foundation Establishment Realm," pointed a finger, and simultaneously began to fall. Instantly, a shadow enveloped Lu Yang's entire mind.

He understood almost instantly the technique Grandmaster Tingyou was displaying: it was an attack launched from the "Foundation Establishment Realm" level, at the cost of a "failed breakthrough"! But in terms of power alone, this strike would not be much weaker than that of a true Foundation Establishment cultivator!

This was—

"Heaven's Collapse."

The next instant, the shadow descended.

Lu Yang's figure was instantly swallowed by it. The ground within a hundred li radius collapsed, all array formations and talismans shattered simultaneously, and the rising dust resembled an earth dragon ascending to the sky.

The collision was like the heavens crushing down, turbulent waves sweeping through the void!

For a time, surging waves of spiritual energy boiled and brilliant lights intertwined, maintaining for a long while before gradually dissipating, finally revealing Grandmaster Tingyou's disheveled figure.

One must know that 'Heaven's Collapse' was no ordinary divine ability.

Strictly speaking, it wasn't even a divine ability, but a technique.

Of the two steps to Foundation Establishment, failing the second step was certain death, while failing the first step depended entirely on the cultivator's personal foundation; a strong foundation meant survival.

And 'Heaven's Collapse' was a self-detonating technique created on this basis. It purely used one's foundation to overwhelm the opponent, using the falling momentum from a failed ascension to attack. Although one would certainly suffer heavy damage from the failed ascension, exchanging it for a Foundation Establishment-level strike was considered worthwhile.

"To achieve a quick victory, this is the only way..."

Grandmaster Tingyou's expression was serene. After the eight elders returned to their positions, he could steadily suppress Lu Yang with the [Yama's Palace], but steady suppression didn't mean a quick victory.

And with the Golden Core Sword Qi above, he couldn't afford to waste time.

That was why he chose such an extreme and cruel method, to heavily injure Lu Yang to the brink of death in one fell swoop, allowing him to carry out the final step of his plan.

"...Myriad Souls Devouring Spirit Heaven-Seizing Great Art."

As Grandmaster Tingyou performed hand seals, a mysterious fluctuation instantly spread out, not targeting Lu Yang, but the City of the Wrongfully Dead below.

The next second, the City of the Wrongfully Dead collapsed!

In a flash, all living beings within the City of the Wrongfully Dead were slaughtered by Grandmaster Tingyou! Not just the City of the Wrongfully Dead, but blood light splattered throughout the secret realm!

Immediately after, visible streaks of soul light surged towards Grandmaster Tingyou, finally gathering around his soul, transforming into a flash of light and lightning, swiftly pouncing towards Lu Yang's location with a cruel, triumphant sneer on his face.

"Nurturing spirits for a millennium, they are due to be used now!"

However, the next second, his smile suddenly froze.

As the dust dispersed, Lu Yang stepped out, not heavily injured and on the verge of death as he had imagined. He was merely stained with blood on his clothes, seemingly unharmed!

"So that's it. It wasn't the Golden Core Sword Qi causing the massacre, it was you..."

Lu Yang sighed, understanding the cause and effect.

Why were there so many people in the Witch-Ghost secret realm? Because Grandmaster Tingyou's secret technique required them; they were all resources he had nurtured!

The reason the secret realm turned into a dead land in the previous life was probably because Grandmaster Tingyou killed everyone to unleash his secret technique, but failed to hide it from the Golden Core Sword Qi, and his own soul dispersed as a result. Thinking this, Lu Yang couldn't help but sigh, looking at Grandmaster Tingyou with a hint of pity.

Pitying him for having survived for a millennium, yet still achieving nothing.

"This is impossible!"

Grandmaster Tingyou's face was distorted with rage, looking at Lu Yang in disbelief: "You clearly suffered my 'Heaven's Collapse' strike, how can you be unharmed?"

Lu Yang smiled faintly: "To be honest, I do have a trick or two up my sleeve..."

[Purple Talent: A Trick or Two]
[A Trick or Two: No matter how terrifying the attack, as long as it is within the limits of your ability, you can effortlessly handle two such instances.]

With his current cultivation, the Qi Condensation realm was entirely within his ability limits.

Even "Heaven's Collapse" was no exception!

Instantly, Grandmaster Tingyou's face revealed despair. Lu Yang's strength was not weak; if he were heavily injured and on the verge of death, Grandmaster Tingyou's soul seizure would have been 100% successful.

But if Lu Yang only suffered minor injuries, the situation was different.

His 100% chance of success immediately plummeted to 50%, or even lower!

However, at this point, Grandmaster Tingyou had no retreat. He could only gather all his focus and, surrounded by myriad souls, charge into Lu Yang's Sea of Consciousness!

He aimed to accomplish everything in one go!

Destroy Lu Yang's Sea of Consciousness with one strike, then seize his body and replace him!

The next second, Grandmaster Tingyou saw Lu Yang's soul in his Sea of Consciousness.

Lu Yang's soul calmly stood up, casually executing a few moves as if aided by a deity, effortlessly and elegantly flinging Grandmaster Tingyou directly out of his Sea of Consciousness!

Grandmaster Tingyou: "???"

Lu Yang's actions were so incredibly casual and effortless that Grandmaster Tingyou didn't even react to what had happened until he was flung out of the Sea of Consciousness.

"I told you, I do have a trick or two."

One for 'Heaven's Collapse,' one for the soul seizure.

"No—!!!"

Grandmaster Tingyou, his soul seizure failed, could only let out a scream.

*Clang! Clang!*

The next second, a magnificent sword qi descended from the heavens, indiscriminately shattering his soul into countless soul fragments, bursting open like dazzling stars.

Upon seeing this, Lu Yang didn't hesitate. With a sweep of his sleeve, he immediately gathered all the soul fragments. These were all transformed from the shattered spiritual consciousness of a Foundation Establishment soul, containing most of the memories of Grandmaster Tingyou, the last sect master of the Witch-Ghost Dao. It was no exaggeration to say that these were priceless treasures!
