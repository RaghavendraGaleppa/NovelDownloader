# Chapter 18: Danxia Mountain

Lin Xuan now devoted himself wholeheartedly to improving his cultivation. With the aid of medicinal pills and his usual diligence, he achieved significant progress.

The ancient texts were correct—even mortals without spiritual roots could overcome cultivation barriers as long as they had sufficient medicinal resources. Once confirming this, Lin Xuan consumed vast quantities of Marrow-Cleansing Pills. Had the medical texts not warned against exceeding nine pills per day, he would have treated the spiritual medicine as regular meals.

Through practice, Lin Xuan gradually refined his pill consumption method. Taking them one by one proved ineffective, as the medicinal potency was too limited. Conversely, swallowing nine pills at once—as he had done during his bottleneck breakthrough—was also flawed. Though within the daily limit, the overwhelming medicinal force not only caused discomfort but also led to wasted energy as excess potency dissipated. 

The optimal method was taking three pills at a time—morning, noon, and evening—followed immediately by meditation. This yielded the best results. While ordinary low-level disciples received only two Marrow-Cleansing Pills per month, Lin Xuan consumed nine daily. Such extravagant usage rapidly advanced his cultivation. Though not progressing a thousand miles a day, he could distinctly feel his spiritual power growing each day.

However, this prosperity was short-lived. After a week, his Marrow-Cleansing Pills were exhausted, leaving only two higher-grade pills scavenged from Zhang Yu. These were red, pea-sized pills Lin Xuan had never seen before. Naturally, he couldn't inquire with the sect elders—that would be admitting involvement in Zhang Yu and Zhou Yan's disappearance. Instead, he secretly researched in the scripture pavilion and identified them as Foundation Establishment Pills, used by Foundation Establishment experts to enhance cultivation—useless for Qi Refinement disciples like himself. Storing them carefully for future use, his immediate priority became obtaining more Marrow-Cleansing Pills to continue his cultivation.

Lin Xuan set his sights on the so-called "useless" discarded pills.

West of Floating Cloud Valley stood a small mountain, its entire interior hollowed out. A massive tunnel led deep underground to an active volcanic vent, sealed by ancestral masters using great magic. They channeled the underground fire into chambers within the mountain walls for alchemical purposes.

Danxia Mountain—one of Floating Cloud Valley's most crucial restricted areas, as significant as the scripture pavilion housing cultivation manuals.

Beast patrols and elite guards ensured no unauthorized entry—violators would be executed without mercy. Even sect disciples couldn't enter freely. A reception building stood before Danxia Mountain for external affairs.

Having gathered intelligence beforehand, Lin Xuan confidently entered the building. The spacious hall covered hundreds of square meters, with several attendants idling about. One promptly approached, bowing respectfully: "Immortal Master."

These attendants weren't cultivators but outer sect disciples—individuals without spiritual roots but possessing other talents that earned them admission. Though not taught cultivation techniques, they received other benefits. To mortals, cultivators were godlike beings, making even outer sect positions highly coveted during recruitment.

These particular attendants came from renowned medical families, their herbal expertise qualifying them to assist at Danxia Mountain. Based on performance, the sect rewarded them with precious medical texts or martial arts manuals—the very ones Lin Xuan had seen on the scripture pavilion's first floor. While worthless in the cultivation world, these were treasures to mortals. After eight to ten years as outer disciples, they could leave the mountain as accomplished physicians or martial arts masters—an undeniable advantage.

Cases like Lin Xuan's—being accepted as a formal disciple without spiritual roots—were extremely rare. His fortune stemmed from saving a powerful Floating Cloud Valley elder. Though this attendant didn't recognize Lin Xuan, his robes identified him as a cultivator, warranting utmost respect.

The attendant's deference stirred reflection in Lin Xuan. Three years of slow progress had subjected him to peers' mockery and disdain, nearly making him forget his status. Despite lacking spiritual roots, he remained a cultivator—a celestial being in mortal eyes. This lofty, respected position felt gratifying, further solidifying his cultivation resolve. Yet his expression revealed nothing. "Is your supervisor available?"

The attendant nodded. "The supervisor is present, Immortal Master. Please wait while I announce you."

Escorting Lin Xuan to a side chamber with tea service, the attendant departed. As Lin Xuan sipped tea and contemplated his approach, an elderly man entered—white-haired, in his seventies, another low-level cultivator. The path of immortality was arduous; spiritual roots didn't guarantee success, as their quality and personal circumstances varied greatly.

In Floating Cloud Valley, ninety percent remained low-level cultivators. This elder, despite his age, still lingered at late Qi Refinement stage—far from perfection, let alone Foundation Establishment. Having reached his cultivation limit, he'd abandoned further efforts, opting for a comfortable position managing Danxia Mountain's reception affairs to enjoy his remaining years.

Now he examined Lin Xuan thoroughly.
