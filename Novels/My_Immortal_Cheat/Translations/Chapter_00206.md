# Chapter 206: Zhou Tian Makes His Move!

"Daoist Friend Zhou Tian, there's still one more. Are you sure you have a way to stop it?" Huang Qi quietly asked Zhou Tian, looking at the two grand battlefields.

"If one doesn't have the diamond, one shouldn't attempt to work with porcelain. Don't worry." Zhou Tian reassured Huang Qi, then turned to the person sitting cross-legged beneath the Burial Scripture and asked, "Senior, approximately how much more time do you need?"

"The Blood River is exhausted; half an incense stick's time will suffice."

As the last trace of blood in the Blood River was absorbed by the final human skin remnant, the person who had been sitting cross-legged beneath the Burial Scripture stood up and actually stepped into the Burial Scripture with a single stride.

At the same time, the bloody glow in the eyes of the three remnants intensified, as if called by something. They roared, wanting to surge in this direction. However, the other two were each blocked. Only the last remnant, which had just finished absorbing the Blood River, was unobstructed, revealing a sinister smile.

"Holy crap." Zhou Tian jumped in surprise. Without time to react, he directly set the target for [Cultivation Replication] as the Saint Devil possessed by Wutian's ghost. He didn't know whether the Saint Devil possessed by Wutian or the current Puzhi was stronger, but Wutian had, after all, once dominated an era, stayed at the Heavenly Venerate realm, and even almost broke through. He should be stronger than this half-baked Puzhi, right?

Instantly, his body burst with golden light, his vital energy surged to the sky, grasping the cosmos, and lightning brewed.

Boom! Electrical light surged. The fist of that last human skin remnant directly struck into his palm. A sea of lightning churned. Zhou Tian's hair was sparkling and translucent, each strand possessing the power to crush all heavens. Lightning coiled around his hands, extending along Zhou Tian's arms to the remnant's body. Crackling sounds erupted, and a burnt smell wafted over.

The human skin remnant pulled back, the scorch marks on its body being repaired by the bloody glow. Although there was only bloody light in its pupils, Zhou Tian felt a sensation of being targeted.

"Interesting, a Dharma Aspect turning into a Heavenly Venerate." A low, hoarse voice came. Now that the human skin had regained its sentience, it naturally wouldn't charge blindly like a mindless beast.

"I am originally a Heavenly Venerate of this era; I merely concealed my cultivation, all for the sake of purifying you human scumbags!"

Zhou Tian now felt better than ever before. His skin was translucent, his entire body radiating countless rays of light, as if all heavens were within his control. Even various profound mysteries flowed through his heart—the most fundamental rules of the Great Dao.

The human skin remnant didn't say much more, intending to bypass Zhou Tian and head towards the Burial Scripture. It had come in response to the Burial Scripture's call, specifically to prevent it from being refined.

"Did you ask for my permission first?!" Zhou Tian stretched his body. Chaotic lightning coiled around him, and space was torn apart. This place was originally just a space Wutian had once opened, and its bearing capacity wasn't too high.

A fierce wind howled, lightning flashed, and thunder roared. In the sky, terrifying chaotic lightning tornadoes appeared, looking from afar like monstrous sea eyes sucking in the entire world. On the periphery, translucent runes shone like stars, each inscribed with strange patterns—innate carvings of the Great Dao. All bone fragments were reorganizing and arranging themselves, emitting auspicious glows that dimmed the sun, moon, and stars. Inside, monstrous divine power fluctuated, and Zhou Tian freely wielded his strength.

The human skin remnant unleashed a crimson sword qi. The energy of life and death, reincarnation, circulated within it, bearing a slight resemblance to the sword strike Puzhi had just executed, though not as pure. This was originally Wutian's divine ability, and these remnants naturally possessed it too.

Chaotic lightning condensed into a gigantic, ferocious thunder dragon. It roared skyward, shaking the void. The crimson sword qi was shattered. The thunder dragon devoured the human skin remnant, transforming into a sea of lightning, from which endless chaotic lightning descended.

"Vajra Palm!" Zhou Tian directly used the only divine ability he currently knew. The Buddha's palm descended, crushing everything, like the sky falling, comparable to the Buddha's palm that had initially suppressed the world's origin. The crystalline, glazed Buddha's palm slapped onto the sea of lightning. The chaotic lightning dispersed, and the earth was pressed down by several *zhang* (tens of feet).

However, after the dust settled, the human skin remnant flew out again, letting out a shrill laugh. "How could a husk that once sought to pierce through the Heavenly Venerate realm be so easily broken through?!" Although its body was covered in cracks, streaks of bloody light coiled around it, already beginning to repair. Even the cracks Puzhi had created when these remnants were in the Dao Lord realm were almost completely healed, and the strange energy lingering on them had instead been dispersed by Zhou Tian's divine ability!

"I don't care, ah. Once that broken book is refined, you guys are done for. I just need to temporarily stop you; I don't necessarily have to kill you." Zhou Tian shrugged, feigning an air of nonchalance.

The blood energy around the human skin remnant surged. They had indeed been controlled by the Burial Scripture to come here, as they had no sentience at that time. But now they had recovered their Heavenly Venerate cultivation and regained sentience, so the Burial Scripture's influence over them was no longer as strong. However, the most crucial point was that their existence was closely tied to the Burial Scripture. If the Burial Scripture were refined and controlled by a new person, these old skins of theirs would vanish into thin air.

"Roar!" The human skin remnant roared, its blood energy collapsing space. Crimson runes appeared all over its body. Compared to when it fought Puzhi, these crimson runes were densely packed, covering its entire form. This was a peculiar secret technique that only these human skins could use.

Boom! Thunder rumbled in the sky again. Zhou Tian, holding a lightning spear, intended to pin down this human skin! This human skin remnant was being suppressed by him. In fact, the other two battlefields were similar; the human skin remnants were all being suppressed.

The strength of the human skin remnants wasn't as great as they had initially estimated. This was because the three Heavenly Venerate-level crimson spears condensed by the Blood River had consumed a lot of their essence, and they had also initially had a large hole sliced into their chests by Puzhi's sword, with lingering energy still obstructing their repair to this day.

Currently, given that they couldn't be instantly annihilated, allowing them to absorb all the Blood River's energy to let the people of that prison refine the Burial Scripture faster seemed like a very good option. Because Puzhi, Wutian, and Zhou Tian all had time limits for their Heavenly Venerate-level power. If those human skin remnants relied on their unique physiques to slowly wear down Puzhi, it would be difficult to successfully refine the Burial Scripture once Puzhi's time limit expired.

"Benefactor, this poor monk cannot hold on for much longer." In the midst of the battle, an old voice entered Zhou Tian's ears—it was Puzhi transmitting a message to him.

"Can you stop talking to me with that accent? It makes me very uncomfortable." Zhou Tian's first reaction wasn't to worry about what would happen after Puzhi couldn't hold on; instead, he emphasized the accent issue.
