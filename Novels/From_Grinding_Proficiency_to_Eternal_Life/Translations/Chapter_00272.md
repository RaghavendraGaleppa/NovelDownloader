# Chapter 272: Holding the Sun and Moon to Pluck the Stars

Although a Ninth-Rank Qi Refining Grandmaster could briefly walk on the wind, they could cover at most a hundred miles before their energy gave out, ultimately not as fast as the ingenuity of the Skyforge Cave.

Ninth-Rank Qi Refining...

Xu Yunfan felt a bit uncomfortable. Being suppressed by force like this naturally left him displeased. The slight relaxation in his mindset after entering the Marrow Cleansing Realm had once again become taut. Only by truly stepping into Ninth-Rank Qi Refining could he grasp his own future.

Seeing Xu Yunfan's expression relax and the dragon scale armor plates on his body slowly close, Bi Sheng revealed a hint of a smile.

"Haomiao and Mushan are on the Divine Thunder Peak of the Clear Mist Mountain. I think you two will have a lot to say."

Twilight was like iron. The fierce winds atop the Divine Thunder Peak swept up fine broken branches and leaves, carving out sharp whistles at the edge of the cliff.

Li Haomiao was bare-chested, the muscles on his back coiled with faint red blood energy. The rock beneath his feet was cracked to a depth of over an inch; he had just completed the ninth impact of the "Dragon Sparrow Bone Forging Technique," and the bones throughout his body emitted a clang like metal striking metal.

"Still one line short."

When he clenched his fist, the dark red sinews coiled around his arm writhed like living things. This was the "Blood Python Strength" passed down secretly by the Great Zhou royal family, a technique only those bearing the Dragon Sparrow bloodline could cultivate. But right now, these纹路 symbolizing power were faintly burning beneath his skin, reminding him that the bottleneck of the Flesh Refining Realm had still not been broken.

The fierce winds atop the mountain carried a bone-chilling coldness, tearing Li Haomiao's gray hair into a chaotic snowstorm. He stood at the edge of the Divine Thunder Peak, his knuckles turning pale from clenching his fists too tightly, his gaze fixed firmly on the south—the direction of the Jade Capital City.

His heart was no longer in the Dao Sect. Ever since learning from the disciples down the mountain four months ago that the entire Great Zhou was in chaos and the Great Zhou Empress had slaughtered millions of common people, his mind had been elsewhere. That devastating news four months ago had turned this last scion of the Great Zhou royal family almost gray overnight.

"Still thinking about the Jade Capital?"

Fang Mushan's voice came from behind.

At this moment, the man with his muscles coiled and his sinews bulging with every movement was completely different from the youth who had once run across the eight hundred miles of the Wasteland Ice Plains.

He walked over to Li Haomiao carrying a jar of strong liquor, his demeanor much steadier than when they were at the Accumulating Cloud Mountain.

Li Haomiao shook his head slightly, not speaking, just staring blankly into the distance.

Fang Mushan didn't mind. Four months ago, the originally somewhat lively Li Haomiao had become a silent gourd.

He broke the mud seal on the liquor jar, took a fierce gulp, wiped his mouth, and passed it to Li Haomiao.

Li Haomiao silently took it and began gulping it down in large mouthfuls.

This jar of strong liquor was not just for drowning sorrows; it was brewed using a large quantity of rare precious herbs. The liquid was amber-colored, with a faint crimson glow flowing within. The moment the seal was broken, a rich medicinal fragrance wafted out, mixed with the clear chill of snow lotus and the burning heat of dragon blood vine.

The liquor contained over a century-old ice ginseng, the Dao Sect's secret "Fire Dates," and the unique Cold Marrow Jade Liquid from the Wasteland Ice Plains. It was refined by earthfire for forty-nine days before completion. Drinking it felt like a raging fire scorching the throat, but it instantly turned into a gentle medicinal power seeping into the four limbs and hundred bones. It could temporarily suppress the pain of the "Blood Python Strength" backlash and even stimulate the awakening of the Dragon Sparrow bloodline.

With every gulp Li Haomiao took, the dark red sinews beneath his skin pulsed like living things. The domineering medicinal power in the liquor clashed with the surging royal blood in his body, stirring fine golden rays on the surface of his skin.

This kind of medicinal liquor was priceless and unavailable on the market. In the outside world, it cost at least one hundred thousand taels of silver. Only a sect with deep foundations like the Dao Sect could afford to plant the herbs themselves and wait for them to mature over the years.

*Tap, tap!*

With the crisp sound of metal striking bluestone, a figure suddenly landed three zhang behind Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan.

The man stood with his back to the two, a black tight-fitting outfit fluttering in the wind. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane at his waist pulsed with hidden patterns, and the dragon scale armor plates on his shoulder blades opened and closed with his breath, faintly emitting the sound of metal clashing.

The fierce winds swept over the peak but dissipated silently three feet around him, as if crushed by an invisible wall of energy.

Li Haomiao's hand gripping the liquor jar suddenly tightened, dark red sinews bulging from his wrist bone. He hadn't sensed when this person had approached! Fang Mushan's pupils contracted, his fingers already silently gripping the long spear on his back.

The two exchanged a glance, both reading the suspicion in the other's eyes. When had the Dao Sect produced such a figure?

The Divine Thunder Peak was a forbidden area of the Clear Mist Mountain. Ordinary disciples couldn't even set foot on the mountain gate's stone steps. Yet this person's aura was as deep as an abyss, actually pressing the surrounding energy to a standstill!

As direct disciples of Bi Sheng, they were familiar with every face among the nearly three thousand people, including inner and outer disciples, direct disciples, and servant disciples who handled chores on the Divine Thunder Peak of the Clear Mist Mountain, Bi Sheng's domain. But the figure before them was unfamiliar.

Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze seemingly fixed on the sea of clouds, but in reality, he was using the dragon scale armor to sense every fluctuation in the blood energy of the two behind him. He deliberately released the "Jade Bone Golden Sound" phenomenon of the Marrow Cleansing Realm, the bones throughout his body emitting a clear clang with his breath, and even the bluestone beneath his feet was cracked into a spiderweb-like pattern by invisible force.

"Who are you?"

Li Haomiao broke the silence first, his voice hoarse like metal rubbing.

The opponent's immense power made all his hair stand on end. He secretly activated the Blood Python Strength, the great dragon on his back tensing segment by segment. If the other party showed a hint of hostility, he would risk his meridians bursting to unleash the Dragon Sparrow Combat Technique.

Xu Yunfan still didn't turn around, just raised his hand.

"Holding the sun and moon to pluck the stars, there is no one like me in this world."

Fang Mushan's eyebrows jumped upon hearing this.

What a grand tone!

Fang Mushan stepped forward, already holding the two sections of the child-arm-thick Panlong spear on his back.

Before the words had fully fallen, Xu Yunfan suddenly turned around!

Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan's expressions froze simultaneously; they hadn't expected it to be Xu Yunfan.

The bloodshot veins in Li Haomiao's eyes suddenly relaxed, his tense back as if shedding a thousand-pound burden, the dark red sinews slowly calming down. His throat rolled twice, and he suddenly burst into loud laughter, the sound shaking the accumulated snow on the cliff edge into rustling falls. "A fine 'Holding the sun and moon to pluck the stars'! Your skill in putting on airs is even better than when we were in Ninggu Tower!"

Fang Mushan also suppressed his joy and teased, "I'm afraid you've dug yourself into madness. Are you still digging in the dirt? Don't learn from those yaozi of the Beimang Mountains and go around digging up other people's tombs."

Xu Yunfan's tunneling skill was fast and excellent, a perfect match for those grave robbers of the Beimang Mountains.

Xu Yunfan laughed loudly. "Only you, this guy, could speak such nonsense, never a good word in your mouth."

Back when they were running across the eight hundred miles of the Wasteland Ice Plains, Fang Mushan was quite the edgy one.

He looked at the former half-grown youth; in just a few years, he had become a burly man with coiled muscles.

Fang Mushan had already rushed forward in a few strides. He plunged the Panlong spear heavily into the snow, and his palm-sized hand slapped Xu Yunfan's shoulder pauldron three times.
