# Chapter 181: The Malicious Lieutenant Enters the Manor!

Qiong Tian Prefecture, under the jurisdiction of Yu'nan Province, lies south of the Great Wu Dynasty and the Southern Heaven Domain.

Starting from Qingning County, the journey to Qiong Tian Prefecture City covers approximately seven hundred miles. The route traverses official roads, mountain paths, and waterways. Although the异马 [White Cloud] possesses immense stamina, with ample time on their hands, they traveled at the pace of an ordinary steed.

They had just left Qingning.

Riding along the smooth official road, a gentle breeze brushed past, lightly stirring their hair. Li Xian had no interest in power or wealth; he was captivated solely by "beauty."

The scenery of heaven and earth filled his eyes.

His heart swelled with infinite delight. Suddenly, a thought crossed his mind: "If all the beauties under the sky could also fall into my embrace, that wouldn't be unacceptable either."

A smile curled up at the corners of his mouth. He let out a few loud shouts into the air to vent his feelings, drawing strange looks from the merchants traveling nearby. Li Xian awkwardly smiled, tightened his grip on the reins, and shouted "Gua!" to speed away from the spot.

The Madam glanced up slightly and scolded him lightly, "Making a fuss over nothing." She said no more, finding the young man's spirited nature to have a unique charm.

The vegetation along the way was lush, and the scenery was magnificent and peculiar.

Thousand-zhang high mountains were everywhere. Majestic and strange peaks were even more common.

Around noon, they passed through Huangyu County.

The county was bustling with pedestrians. The white horse and black carriage traveling through the city attracted the attention of the common people. Even the noble families in the county rarely possessed such a carriage.

Having traveled early in the morning, Li Xian smelled the scent of market life and felt hungry. He asked, "Madam, shall we eat?"

Madam Wen said, "Handle it yourself." She took out a jade box containing Jade Dew, a pale green liquid with the fragrance of plants and trees. A single drop could satisfy hunger for a whole day. Li Xian stopped the carriage, found a noodle shop, and had a simple meal. Living in the wild, he didn't seek fine food; once his stomach was full, they set off again.

Heading north, the climate grew colder.

Qiong Tian Prefecture governed nine counties and twelve cities, covering a vast territory. As they traveled further north, the area became increasingly prosperous, with rivers converging and water transport flourishing.

The Great Wu Dynasty had many river systems, and waterways were vital resources. Martial artists fought for them, noble families seized them, and sects vied for them.

Having traveled far, Li Xian had broadened his horizons: "Comparing them, Qingning County is indeed a barren land. Previously, heading south, although the landscapes were magnificent, the livelihoods of the people were destitute. Many were poorly clad, and the chaos caused by the Yellow Dragon Army made life unbearable for the populace."

"Now, heading north and passing through large cities, although the poor still outnumber the rich, the overall situation is much better."

They traveled for a day this way.

Spending the night in the wild, Madam Wen slept in the carriage, while Li Xian remained vigilant, guarding against dangers on all sides. In areas where people gathered and peace reigned, demonic creatures were few. However, after nightfall, they could still be seen occasionally. Li Xian stood guard for half the night and shook the "Demon-Expelling Bell." The demons retreated and dared not approach. He then settled down and took the time to practice his martial arts.

They set off again the next day. Although the scenery along the way was magnificent, they were in a hurry to make up for lost time and couldn't appreciate it properly. Towards evening, Madam Wen, who had been sitting quietly for a long time, suddenly said, "Go to Wujang Workshop."

Li Xian checked the map. Wujang Workshop was in 'Wulong City,' only about thirty miles from their current location. He immediately turned the horse's head and headed east. When night fully fell, they arrived outside Wulong City.

The city gate stood a hundred zhang high, resembling a mountain. The plaque bearing the name 'Wulong City' featured calligraphy that soared like dragons and phoenixes, exuding a momentum as if breaking free from shackles to soar into the sky.

City guards blocked the road. The Madam handed Li Xian a token. Li Xian immediately presented it. Seeing the token, the guards obediently made way. It turned out the Madam had been here before and held a certain status in the workshop. The token symbolized her identity, allowing them to pass freely without inspection.

"Head straight to Wujang Workshop and ask if there are any luxury ships heading to the Prefecture City," Madam Wen's voice drifted from inside the carriage. It was gentle and melodious, carrying an air of authority amidst its softness.

Wujang Workshop.

A great river wound its way.

At the entrance of the alley, dozens of large ships were docked. Li Xian looked up to see countless common people, like tiny ants, hauling cargo. Of the three hundred and sixty trades, water transport was the most significant.

"Lazybones, move faster and be gentler! These items are treasures for the masters upstairs. If you break even a tiny bit, your worthless lives won't be enough to pay for them."

A fat, greasy supervisor swung a long whip, spouting a string of words that bore a striking resemblance to Luo Fang of the Miscellaneous Service Hall.

Li Xian said, "Madam, it's crowded here. I'll find a quiet spot to park the carriage first. You can rest inside while I go find the Wujang Workshop manager for a ship." The Madam remained silent, tacitly agreeing.

Wulong City had a lake with beautiful scenery, surrounded by weeping willows. Li Xian parked the carriage nearby and lifted a corner of the curtain to see the Madam resting with her eyes closed. He whispered, "Madam, I'm going."

Madam Wen didn't lift her eyes, giving an almost imperceptible nod.

After securing the carriage and patting the White Cloud horse, Li Xian, with the token at his waist, walked into Wujang Workshop. After some inquiries, he found the manager in charge of transportation and asked about ship passage.

The manager took the token and examined it closely. Transport tokens were ranked into three tiers and nine grades. This token was green with a golden interior, a top-grade token. Its owner was either wealthy or noble. His expression changed immediately, and he dared not be careless. He immediately sent someone to check the shipping schedule and respectfully seated Li Xian.

Not long after.

The manager approached and said apologetically, "Young Master, I'm afraid you'll have to wait another day, or... if you would condescend to take a slightly lower-grade ship, I can arrange it for you immediately."

"If you are willing to wait, I will arrange a superior room for you, along with three or five beautiful concubines to serve you well. You can listen to music, seek pleasure, or watch performances to your heart's content. I guarantee you won't be bored."

"Is that so..." Li Xian didn't give a reply but went back to ask for the Madam's opinion.

Madam Wen had anticipated this. "Since there is no luxury ship, we cannot force it. We shall wait a day."

Li Xian drove the carriage to Wujang Workshop. He informed the manager of their decision, and the manager hurriedly arranged a room. Li Xian then returned to the carriage to help the Madam down.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, does Wujang Workshop know your reputation? They are so respectful."

Madam Wen said, "I have business in the Prefecture City and need to deal with Wujang Workshop. Over time, our interests are closely linked, so they naturally treat me politely. As for my name... I don't wear it on my face, how would they know?"

As the two were walking, several graceful women approached. The manager wore an ingratiating expression. Madam Wen glanced at them and understood the situation immediately. She frowned slightly and said, "Tell these people to disperse."

The manager, flustered, immediately dismissed the women. He had mentioned earlier, "Let beautiful concubines serve you, you won't be bored," and the young master hadn't refused. He had noted this silently, but he hadn't realized there was a Madam above the young master.

Madam Wen said softly, "Raise your hand." Li Xian complied. Madam Wen lightly flicked her sleeve, and a soft sword inside cut his palm. A bloody wound appeared in Li Xian's palm, the sharp pain shooting through his heart, making him wince.

Li Xian thought to himself: "Is the Madam angry because I was going to have beautiful concubines serve me? How was I to know the manager would be so thoughtful? I didn't even agree. This is truly an undeserved disaster."

Madam Wen was calm and composed, not seeming angry at all. She didn't care about such tacky women. She had been thinking: "This boy is young, full of blood and energy, and his desires are hard to control. Precisely for this reason, I need to find opportunities to discipline him. I must ensure his passions and desires are in my hands. If I want him to feel desire, he must feel desire; if I want him to be moved, he must be moved."

The two stayed at Wujang Workshop. Soon, dawn broke, and a red sun rose from the river, its light shining upon the waterway, creating a shimmering spectacle.

Countless ships set sail.

The place where they stayed was a riverside pavilion, a hundred zhang high, commanding a full view of the beautiful scenery. Li Xian looked down. Layers of building eaves completely concealed the vast, dense crowd of boatmen and common people, leaving only the magnificent scenery.

A day passed. A luxury ship docked at the port. It was thirty-three zhang tall, entirely golden-red, constructed from special wood. The entire hull was carved with dragon patterns.

The exterior was extravagantly luxurious, beyond words. It seemed as if all the craftsmanship in the world had been applied to this single vessel.

Li Xian saw a bronze tripod standing on the ship's roof and asked, "Madam, why is there a bronze tripod on the ship's roof?"

Madam Wen looked over and said, "This ship is named the Copper Ding. It was originally built for refining pills. I told you before that before refining pills, one needs to establish a formation. Some build tall buildings as the formation, some build high towers. This ship uses the ship itself as the formation. When refining pills, the ship must sail into the deep sea to gather deep sea water vapor to refine rare and precious pills."

"After the pills are refined and no longer needed, it is used as a luxury ship to transport goods."

Li Xian secretly thought: "This world is truly marvelous. I've broadened my horizons again."

"Sir, I have arranged the 'Heavenly' Grade A cabin for you. If there is nothing else, please board the ship. Of course, if you have urgent matters, this ship will wait for you for two hours."

The manager came to visit and said respectfully. He now knew that Li Xian was not the main person; the formidable one was the beautiful Madam. But it wasn't his fault for misjudging. Li Xian's face was handsome and elegant, his demeanor extraordinary, far surpassing even the young masters of noble families. Li Xian expressed his understanding, exchanged some pleasantries with the manager, and saw him off.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, when shall we board? Can this ship go directly to the Prefecture City?"

Madam Wen said, "The Prefecture City is where seven rivers converge. This Wujang River flows into the Prefecture City, so it can naturally reach the Prefecture City directly."

The two boarded the luxury ship. The ship was unusually high, and boarding required stepping onto the "Ascending Cloud Ladder," symbolizing rising step by step, reaching straight into the clouds. As he walked, Li Xian looked down and saw countless envious gazes.

"Madam, walk slowly." Li Xian supported her carefully. Madam Wen nodded, inexplicably enjoying this subtle care. They entered the ship's cabin and settled into the Heavenly Grade A room.

In the evening, the luxury ship sailed along the Wujang River. The river was wide, and the current was swift. As they went deeper, the banks became invisible, making it feel like the open sea.

On the ship's deck, a red stage was set up. Dancers performed nonstop day and night, taking shifts to play music and dance, their figures captivating.

The passengers on the luxury ship were all either wealthy or noble. Those heading to the Prefecture City had backgrounds and connections. If someone took a liking to a dancer, they would simply take her away for a night of passion, and no one would say a word.

Li Xian sat on the terrace, watching this scene of extravagance. The ship sailed for three days. On the second day, a strange sight appeared on the Wujang River. Countless "Peng Fish" swam out from the river bottom, leaping out of the water, soaring high into the air.

They flew in the sky, blocking out the sun.

Li Xian possessed the "Thunder Listening" trait and knew that a thunderstorm was imminent on the river. The Peng Fish had a special habit: whenever there was thunder and rain, they would collectively leap out of the water.

On the third day.

In the morning, a mist shrouded the river. Amidst the clouds and mist, a village seemed to appear faintly.

There are countless strange sights and events in the world. The Madam had never encountered this either and couldn't figure it out. She recalled a legend: the Wujang River is quite mythical. There was once a Madam of Wujang who jumped into the river and died, turning into a spirit of the river.

There are also rumors that the Wujang River is a tributary of the River of the Underworld, flowing into the human world. Therefore, it often connects with the Netherworld, allowing one to see the strange scenery of the other shore... Stories like these, some true, some false.

But once the hour of Chen (7-9 AM) passed, the mist on the river completely dispersed. Li Xian looked far ahead and saw pavilions standing in rows and colorful cranes flying... a grand spectacle he had never seen before.

The Prefecture City had arrived.

"Does this... count as a Malicious Lieutenant entering the city?" Li Xian muttered to himself.

The ship docked at the port. Li Xian first led White Cloud off the large ship. Then he returned to the ship to help the Madam disembark.

The Prefecture City boasted three hundred and sixty buildings reaching a hundred zhang high. The Cao, Lin, Yuwen, and Hong families, along with the three hundred and sixty trades—fishing, firewood, jade... The prosperity was something he had never heard of in his life.

As soon as the two appeared, people couldn't help but gather around to watch. The woman was dignified and noble, the man young and handsome.

Such a combination was truly rare.

As the two walked along the street, the people of the Prefecture City all turned to look and discuss.

No one knew that the handsome young master they were currently praising was the malicious Lieutenant Li Xian they had previously cursed and hated.

Madam Wen's gaze was fixed. At this time last year, she had also been in the Prefecture City.

She had her eyes firmly set on the "peaches" of the great noble families of the Prefecture City.

Madam Wen suddenly gave a light laugh, filled with the meaning of admonition, demand, and command. She said softly, "Xiao Xian, this time we are here, you must stir up a storm for me."

"If not, I will punish you."
