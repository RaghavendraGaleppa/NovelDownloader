# Chapter 525: One Must Rely on Oneself

Xu Yunfan walked slowly to Chu Chengnan's side, his mind filled with countless thoughts. He was waiting for a moment that was even more chaotic than today, a moment that could better obscure the heavenly secrets and disturb the vision of the True Lords. Otherwise, seeking to attain the Golden Core was nothing but a pipe dream.

The best scenario would be a repeat of the Three Sects' Great War from a thousand years ago, when all the Golden Core True Lords were drawn into the conflict and had no time to spare. Only then would there be a chance.

The once-mighty Hundred Peaks True Person, who had sought to prove the Golden Core, was now a haggard wreck, like a decayed piece of wood drained of all its vital essence, collapsed狼狈ly on the ground.

His meridians were shattered throughout his body, and the Inner World that supported his cultivation had withered to the point of near exhaustion. His cultivation level was visibly plummeting, having been almost beaten back to the early Foundation Establishment stage, or even a worse state.

The air was thick with the stench of blood and the smell of scorching. The faint light leaking from his broken Dao Foundation was like a candle flickering in the wind, illuminating Chu Chengnan's deathly pale face.

However, when Xu Yunfan's gaze met his, he saw a faint, forced smile appear on that bloodless face.

A tranquility beyond imagination resided deep within Chu Chengnan's eyes. There was no anger, despair, or venom as one might expect. It was as if the shattered hope he had fought for through five lifetimes was merely a possession outside of himself, not a part of him.

His breath was weak as he spoke in a halting voice, each word seeming to drain his remaining strength.

"Junior Brother Xu, I have failed in the end. My quest to attain the Golden Core has come to nothing..."

His voice was dry and hoarse, yet it carried a strange sense of resignation, as if everything was now settled. "In the end, I have disappointed True Lord Qingyuan. He invested so much in me..."

Xu Yunfan remained silent.

The bone-chilling pressure in the air had not yet dissipated, and the scene before him confirmed the terrifying nature of the human tribulation he had just witnessed. Seeing the once-high-spirited Hundred Peaks True Person reduced to such a state, his heart felt heavy.

He squatted down and said in a deep voice, "Senior Brother, you need not be so hard on yourself. The path to the Golden Core is fraught with peril from the start. Though this tribulation was fierce, it is not a dead end. The path of a cultivator is long. If you are willing to be reborn and start anew, you can still fight for another chance."

Upon hearing this, a faint trace of bitterness and helplessness finally flashed through the calm in Chu Chengnan's eyes.

He shook his head slowly, very slowly, as if this simple action exhausted all his mental and physical energy.

"Five lifetimes, Junior Brother. Five lifetimes at Foundation Establishment is already the limit for a Foundation Establishment cultivator's soul."

"The path of cultivation has its end. Beyond that..." He gasped for breath. "The chance of finding the path to cultivation again is slim. Perhaps after countless reincarnations, there might be a sliver of an opportunity."

Xu Yunfan fell silent for a moment, the image of Chu Chengnan's obsession with power before his tribulation flashing through his mind.

After a brief thought, he said, "The promise you made before your tribulation—to give me half the resources of a Great True Person—is still valid. If you can be reborn and return, no matter where you are, Xu Yunfan will surely guide you into the Dao."

These words were like a faint spark, falling into Chu Chengnan's dormant eyes.

For the first time, a clear, almost gratified smile appeared on his calm face, though it was somewhat distorted by the intense pain.

"Good. Junior Brother Xu, with your word... Senior Brother..."

His voice grew fainter, as if even the strength to speak was rapidly draining away.

However, the whisper that followed carried a calm that saw through the world of mortals. "True Lord Qingyuan has already abandoned me. From now on, I can only rely on myself."

Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed slightly, but his heart was unmoved.

Yes, quite some time had passed since Chu Chengnan's failed tribulation, and True Lord Qingyuan had never shown himself. This in itself said everything.

In a sect like the Primordial Origin Sect, with its demonic reputation, those who have exhausted their value are naturally discarded like worn-out shoes.

Xu Yunfan gave a wry laugh and decided to speak plainly.

"The Primordial Origin Sect has long been called the Primordial Demon Sect for a reason. True Lord Qingyuan treating you with such coldness is ruthless but logical. If, after such a惨败, he had been warm and concerned, now wouldn't Senior Brother be terrified?"

Chu Chengnan's mouth twitched with difficulty, as if trying to smile, but it only pulled at his injuries, turning into a stifled groan.

He closed his eyes and remained silent for a long time, as if gathering his final strength. The foul, sinister wind blew over his tattered Dao robe, making a whimpering sound.

A long while later, he spoke again. His voice was clearer than before, but it sounded more like a final testament.

"Junior Brother Xu, remember this: one must rely on oneself on the path of the Dao."

He spoke with difficulty, yet with calmness.

"High and mighty figures like True Lords are not to be trusted. Do not rely on them. My present state is the result of doing so."

He was interrupted by another fit of rapid, painful breathing. After a long pause, he continued in a low voice, "Your talent and luck are both superior to mine. You might have a different outcome. Do not follow in my footsteps. Remember this well. Trust no one, trust only your own strength. One must rely on oneself."

Xu Yunfan listened quietly, his heart churning with emotion.

The warning etched into him by Chu Chengnan with his own bloody lesson was heavier than any secret technique or cultivation manual.

He said in a solemn voice, "I will remember your words, Senior Brother. This lesson is now carved into my bones. I will never forget it."

Just as Xu Yunfan thought Chu Chengnan had finished his交代 and would now use the last of his soul's power to prepare for reincarnation, a surprising scene unfolded.

The body, which should have been completely spent and on the verge of collapse, suddenly moved.

Chu Chengnan propped up his upper body with his elbows, his movements incredibly slow. With every friction of bone and tear of shattered meridians, there was a grating sound and beads of crimson blood seeping from his broken skin.

Yet the unnervingly calm expression on his face did not change at all; it even carried a kind of indifference, as if he had already accepted death.

Xu Yunfan's eyes filled with astonishment. He instinctively reached out to help, but stopped, asking in confusion, "Senior Brother? What are you doing? Aren't you going to die?"

To be honest, he had prepared himself to see the other off, even to protect his soul's passage into reincarnation, and had even mustered some sorrow to put on a show.

Chu Chengnan didn't answer immediately. Instead, he continued to grit his teeth, enduring unimaginable agony, and with great difficulty, arranged his legs into a lotus position, barely maintaining a seated posture.

After finishing this, his forehead was covered in beads of cold sweat, and his lips had turned a purplish-blue from excessive blood loss.

He panted heavily, his chest heaving violently like a broken bellows.

Once his breathing had settled slightly, he raised his eyelids. His eyes, still as calm as a deep pool, looked at Xu Yunfan. His voice, though weak, was no longer halting, but instead carried a rock-like tenacity.

"Junior Brother Xu, did you think your Senior Brother couldn't hold on and was about to go to the cycle of reincarnation?"

He tugged at the corner of his mouth in a self-deprecating smile. "My Dao Foundation is destroyed, that's one thing. Dying is another. I'm still far from that step."

Xu Yunfan's mouth couldn't help but twitch at these words.

He had truly wasted his emotions.
