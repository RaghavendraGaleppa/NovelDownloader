# Chapter 133: One Man, One Rooster, Unrivaled

Zhou Qing handed the sound transmission to Fu Song and the others to read.

"Junior Brother, what do you say?"

Zhou Qing calmly replied, "Demonic cultivators are fickle and untrustworthy. Let them fight their battles, we'll fight ours."

At this moment, another wave of demonic beasts gathered. The mountain-protecting formation, still unrepaired, suffered a terrifying impact.

Zhou Qing said, "Second Senior Brother, Daoist Brother Zhang, you two protect the grand formation. I'll blunt the momentum of this wave of demonic beasts first."

This time, he opened his Eye of Truth, detecting the auras of eight Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts. Clearly, after Fallen Ridge repelled one demonic beast attack, it drew considerable attention.

"Mao Ri, follow me."

Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song headed to the mountain-protecting formation, while Zhou Qing and Mao Ri soared into the sky.

Mao Ri erupted with terrifying True Solar Flames, transforming into a colossal fiery bird. In the sky, many avian demonic beasts were already attacking Fallen Ridge. The moment Mao Ri appeared, the terrifying aura of its True Solar Flames exploded, directly causing the lower-tier avian beasts to plummet.

In front of Zhou Qing, it was merely a large rooster, but in front of these avian demonic beasts, Mao Ri was an existence akin to a Demonic King.

When the Red Sun rises, it still stands shoulder to shoulder with the heavens!

Mao Ri displayed unprecedented aggression. It typically remains silent, yet its single cry is astonishing!

A Foundation Establishment-level Dark Eagle felt utterly shocked. The Dark Eagle Clan was considered the strongest avian demonic tribe in the Jingyang Dao Domain. Yet, seeing a colossal fiery bird charging towards it, the Dark Eagle trembled, feeling a rare surge of fear.

"What kind of monster is that?" The demonic cultivators of the Blood Demon Sect, observing from their spirit boat in the distance, were equally astonished.

Qin Qing also felt surprised. As demonic cultivators, seeing True Solar Flames instilled a natural fear in Qin Qing and his companions. Moreover, Mao Ri's True Solar Flames were exceedingly pure.

The enormous Dark Eagle spread its wings, spanning dozens of meters, stirring up violent air currents. Simultaneously, the Dark Eagle spat out a massive stream of black water.

Abyssal Dark Water.

This was precisely the innate divine ability of the Dark Eagle Clan. The black water stream resembled a black dragon in the air, dark and profound, dimming the sky in an instant.

However, under this pressure, Mao Ri's True Solar Flames burned even more intensely. A terrifying surge of Fire Elemental Demonic Power erupted; the True Solar Flames, fanned by Mao Ri's wings, severed the black water dragon, breaking the darkness.

Mao Ri was incredibly swift, its merciless fiery claws landing on the Dark Eagle's back. The Dark Eagle immediately felt a bone-splitting pain, letting out a horrific shriek.

At this moment, Zhou Qing had long since reached the sky, and the Qinghuang Sword descended with a single strike.

Cleave!

Zhou Qing's magical power gathered on the Qinghuang Sword, and a colossal sword light erupted from it. The Dark Eagle, struck by Mao Ri's sharp claws and Zhou Qing's massive sword, immediately plummeted to the ground.

But this was only the beginning. Zhou Qing possessed long-lasting stamina, pure magical power, and extremely fast recovery. The sharpness of Lung Gold Thunder also augmented the Qinghuang Sword.

As the Dark Eagle hit the ground, an earth-shattering sword light erupted once more. Zhou Qing directed this sword strike towards the beast tide.

One Sword, Cleaving the Tide!

The originally surging beast tide was divided by Zhou Qing's sword light.

"If I used my full power, I could also achieve this," an elder demonic cultivator from the Blood Demon Sect commented, then paused and added, "but this person does it with far too much ease."

The attack power Zhou Qing displayed did not exceed the Foundation Establishment realm, yet he performed it with incredible ease. Every strike of his seemed like the full-power attack of a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, delivered effortlessly. This composure placed Zhou Qing on a different level from all the other heterodox cultivators and orthodox cultivators nearby.

Fast!

As fast as lightning and thunder.

Zhou Qing manipulated the Qinghuang Sword, emitting bursts of sword roars and thunderclaps. The Sword Roar Thunder Sound sword realm made Zhou Qing's sword light incredibly swift. These demonic beasts were given no chance to trap the Qinghuang Sword.

Normally, the Sword Roar Thunder Sound technique, due to the extreme speed of the sword light, was difficult to control. However, Zhou Qing's powerful divine sense and profound magical power allowed him to wield his swordsmanship with perfect control. At this moment, no sword cultivator inside or outside Tianxuan City would dare claim their swordsmanship was more profound than Zhou Qing's.

"Could he be a peerless Sword Dao genius?" Qin Qing, the Young Master of the Blood Demon Sect, murmured.

Becoming a sword cultivator inherently required a certain level of swordsmanship talent, and truly peerless geniuses in the Sword Dao were exceedingly rare. In the Jingyang Dao Domain, the last one who could be called a peerless Sword Dao genius was a Core Formation Ancestor from two hundred years ago, who had since fallen.

Zhou Qing activated Divine Azure Wood Thunder, merging it with Sword Roar Thunder Sound. The sword light was verdant, seemingly brimming with vitality, yet wherever it passed, it invariably claimed the lives of one or even several demonic beasts.

The remaining seven Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts held back within the beast tide, dispatching their subordinate beasts to continuously charge at the sword light. They already possessed a certain degree of intelligence, hoping to use the beast tide to slowly exhaust Zhou Qing to death.

But Zhou Qing also had Mao Ri by his side. Mao Ri unleashed True Solar Flames, scattering them as if they cost nothing. Fiery rain continuously poured down from the sky. Moreover, Mao Ri's aura instilled fear even in Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts, let alone the lower-tier ones. Under the deterrence of Mao Ri's aura, those flying avian beasts dared not approach the master and servant.

One man, one rooster, continuously attacked from the sky towards the ground.

Sword light, startling thunder, grand sun, fiery rain!

Zhou Qing felt incomparably exhilarated. Today's sword strikes would spread his might!

However, this good fortune did not last long. A tiger's roar echoed through the sky, and a striped black tiger with wings appeared. Simultaneously, the Foundation Establishment demonic beasts on the ground, upon hearing the roar, immediately flew into the sky, encircling Zhou Qing and Mao Ri. In addition, the beast tide on the ground intensified its assault on Fallen Ridge.

The mountain body of Fallen Ridge continuously shook, large rocks tumbled down, and the mountain itself visibly seemed to shrink. But Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song guarded the mountain gate, their Furnace Blood Qi erupting with heaven-shshaking vitality, like Heavenly Kings guarding the Heavenly Gate, repelling the waves of the beast tide again and again. As they resisted the beast tide, the latent medicinal power from the Jade Liquid Rejuvenation Pill was fully unleashed, continuously replenishing their blood qi. Body cultivators were meant to improve through constant combat!

Zhou Qing did not pay attention to Zhang Jingxiu and Fu Song; he believed they could hold their ground.

The man and rooster were now surrounded by eight Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts, including three fifth-tier demonic beasts at the late Foundation Establishment stage. Among them, the winged striped black tiger possessed abundant vital energy and a profound aura.

"The Xuanyang Tiger Clan," Qin Qing, the Young Master of the Blood Demon Sect, remarked from the distant spirit boat. The Xuanyang Tiger Clan was nearly wiped out by True Immortal Jingyang, but after three hundred years of recuperation, they had somewhat recovered.

The beast tide was an opportunity for the demonic beasts. This Xuanyang Black Tiger was clearly the strongest among the Xuanyang Tiger Clan currently, carrying the hope of revitalizing their tribe. Moreover, this beast tide also presented an opportunity for them to escape the suppression of the White Moon Wolf Clan. Normally, the Xuanyang Tiger Clan was under strict surveillance by the White Moon Wolf Clan.

Zhou Qing's Eye of Truth circulated, observing the Xuanyang Black Tiger. Its aura was infinitely close to that of a sixth-tier demonic beast at the Core Formation level. One step further, and it could be called a Great Demon.

Zhou Qing's aura also seemed to stimulate the Xuanyang Black Tiger. A kind of hatred rooted in its bloodline seemed to erupt all at once. Dark clouds gathered around the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body, and a colossal black tiger phantom slowly emerged, its blood-red eyes like giant lanterns, its gaze like a bloody light, carrying an unspeakable, profound terror. The other seven Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts clearly followed the Xuanyang Black Tiger as their leader.

It was like a fated confrontation!

Zhou Qing's mind was calm, without a ripple. Under the stimulation of the Xuanyang Black Tiger's powerful aura, Zhou Qing's battle intent continuously soared.

***

Zhou Qing's presence also attracted the attention of many other powerful cultivators who were hunting demonic beasts in the beast tide. Among them were not a few Foundation Establishment cultivators who had participated in the previous Dan Yuan Minor Assembly.

"I didn't expect Qinglingzi to be even stronger than I imagined."

"Just how terrifying is the foundation this man laid during his Foundation Establishment?"

"Even Tianxuan Ancestor, when he reached the Peak Foundation Establishment back then, was probably no more than this."

Zhou Qing stood in the void, confronting eight powerful Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts, with only a powerful fiery bird by his side. Yet, his aura showed no weakness.

"Beneath the Core Formation stage, this young man is likely unrivaled."

His astonishing Blood Qi, formidable Divine Sense, and the terrifying swordsmanship of Sword Roar Thunder Sound... all indicated that Zhou Qing stood at the pinnacle of Foundation Establishment cultivators.

But what they didn't know was that Zhou Qing could still progress further within the Foundation Establishment realm. The fourth stage of the Five Viscera Thunder, Lung Gold Thunder, had not yet been fully cultivated! The aura Zhou Qing displayed at this moment was already the absolute limit of the Foundation Establishment realm that these cultivators could imagine.

The cultivators of the Blood Demon Sect, who had been focused on the Fallen Ridge battlefield from the start, were now increasingly astonished. Qin Qing thought to himself, "Qinglingzi's potential far surpasses Jinguang's. No wonder Jinguang praises Qinglingzi so highly. Within thirty years, one of them, or perhaps both, will definitely achieve Core Formation."

Qin Qing seemed to see the future thirty years from now. Even three hundred years ago, a figure like Zhou Qing would have been considered a generational prodigy.

"It's a pity. If such a figure had appeared a hundred years earlier, no, even fifty years earlier, Tianxuan Ancestor would have had a successor, and perhaps Tianxuan City could have continued to hold out. But now, time is running out..."

According to the Blood Demon Sect Master's judgment, Tianxuan Ancestor might not be able to last another fifty years. In merely fifty years, Zhou Qing could not possibly grow to Tianxuan Ancestor's level; even a hundred years would likely be too rushed. The higher the cultivation realm, the more difficult it was for demonic cultivators to break through, which was the opposite of their astonishing cultivation speed in the early stages.

And the True Demonic Blood was precisely the hope for the Blood Demon Sect Master to break through to the late Core Formation stage. Qin Qing's rebirth after using a drop of True Demonic Blood had provided the Blood Demon Sect Master with some experience regarding it. That Qin Qing could be reborn this time was also extremely fortunate. If they were to try again, the Blood Demon Sect Master had no confidence.

Cultivation itself was an act against heaven, let alone rebirth? However, the higher the realm of a cultivator, the more likely they were to possess similar means, through various preparations, to be reborn even after falling. This was why the human race in the Jingyang Dao Domain believed True Immortal Jingyang was merely missing, trapped somewhere, rather than having fallen. This was their hope in despair.

As Qin Qing pondered, Zhou Qing struck again with his sword. A terrifying Sword Qi of Malevolence appeared at the tip of the Qinghuang Sword, incredibly condensed.

Sword Roar Thunder Sound.

The Xuanyang Black Tiger's left eye was wounded by this single strike, the intense pain suppressed by it. A single tiger claw struck the Qinghuang Sword, preventing Zhou Qing's strike from fully piercing the Xuanyang Black Tiger's head.

The severe pain ignited the Xuanyang Black Tiger's ferocity. Zhou Qing's expression was grave. This black tiger was truly terrifying. His previous sword strike had been executed with flawless precision, and he had even unleashed Sword Qi of Malevolence, yet it still failed to inflict a fatal wound on the Xuanyang Black Tiger.

Although powerful demonic beasts did not need eyes to perceive their surroundings, an injured eye would always have an impact.

Zhou Qing let out a terrifying tiger's roar. It was so potent that for a moment, one might have thought it was the Xuanyang Black Tiger roaring. This roar caused the other demonic beasts to fall into a daze. Mao Ri seized the opportunity to spray out a large amount of True Solar Flames, catching these demonic beasts in one net. It didn't need to defeat these beasts, only to create chaos.

The roar clearly had no effect on the Xuanyang Black Tiger; the terrifying colossal black tiger phantom, carrying a foul-smelling air current, lunged towards Zhou Qing. And a terrifyingly sharp aura erupted. As a member of the Xuanyang Tiger Clan, it inherently possessed both Metal and Wind elemental bloodlines, and its Blood Qi was even more powerful than a late-stage Furnace realm cultivator's.

Zhou Qing watched calmly and serenely as the Xuanyang Black Tiger charged. Under the Eye of Truth and enveloped by his Divine Sense, the opponent's movements seemed to slow down many times over.

Sword Qi of Malevolence adhered to the Qinghuang Sword. Just as the sharp tiger claw was about to scratch Zhou Qing's forehead, Zhou Qing's figure vanished into thin air, and a dark green sword light, like a line, appeared on the Xuanyang Black Tiger's paw. Half of the tiger paw was directly severed by Zhou Qing's Qinghuang Sword. This was the augmentation of sharpness to his Qinghuang Sword after Zhou Qing had refined a portion of Geng Metal. Had it been before, he definitely would not have been able to sever the Xuanyang Black Tiger's paw with a single strike.

Although half its paw was severed, the Xuanyang Black Tiger's ferocity was completely ignited. Its other claw, carrying a force capable of piercing a small mountain, landed on the Qinghuang Sword, unleashing terrifying power. This claw was too fast; the Qinghuang Sword couldn't even dodge it. A mournful clang echoed from the Qinghuang Sword.

But Zhou Qing remained unmoved. He actually ignored the Qinghuang Sword being struck away by the tiger claw, advancing instead of retreating, and closing in on the Xuanyang Black Tiger.

One punch!

Terrifying frost erupted from Zhou Qing's hand, and an intensely cold aura instantly slammed into the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body. A white-gold stream of air instantly covered the Xuanyang Black Tiger.

Metal Elemental Qi!

But when the punch landed on the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body, profound and deep thunderous light erupted! Zhou Qing's Heavenly Frost Fist was augmented by the power of Kidney Water Thunder.

The Xuanyang Black Tiger's entire body went numb, as if countless needles had pricked it. What surprised it even more was that Zhou Qing's strength was no weaker than its own. Zhou Qing was like a humanoid version of it.

Zhou Qing was intimately familiar with the tiger clan. Under his Eye of Truth, the Xuanyang Black Tiger's true nature was completely seen through by Zhou Qing. He even saw the nodes where demonic power flowed within the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body, as well as some internal imbalances.

One punch, two punches, three punches!

Zhou Qing's fists carried terrifying magical power and Blood Qi. The Metal Elemental Qi covering the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body was directly scattered. But its roars not only did not stop, but became even more piercing.

At this moment, two fifth-tier demonic beasts at the late Foundation Establishment stage attempted to come to its aid. Mao Ri, far from intercepting them, rapidly retreated.

The two late Foundation Establishment demonic beasts had not yet approached Zhou Qing when they witnessed a scene unforgettable to their beastly lives. Hundreds of thunder talismans formed a colossal net in the sky.

A trap!

It turned out that all of this was within Zhou Qing's foresight. Before the two late Foundation Establishment demonic beasts broke through Mao Ri's True Solar Flames blockade and came to assist, Zhou Qing had already secretly manipulated hundreds of thunder talismans.

As soon as they approached, the net formed by the thunder talismans immediately appeared, blocking the two demonic beasts. Fifty Divine Azure Wood Thunders and fifty Divine Blazing Fire Thunders erupted, water and fire complementing each other. Earth-shattering explosions and impacts instantly engulfed the two late Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts. These were thunder talismans Zhou Qing had remade in his leisure time over the past half year, more powerful than those he had used against Xu You of the Black Water Sect in the Divine Water Palace.

The water and fire thunder exploded. The immense shock even caused the Xuanyang Black Tiger to lose its composure for a moment.

Zhou Qing didn't bother with the two late Foundation Establishment demonic beasts; instead, he directly mounted the black tiger's back and began pummeling it with punches. Terrifying Blood Qi erupted, along with an intensely freezing aura that drilled into the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body. Under the heavy blows, it grew increasingly sluggish.

As the thunderous light dissipated, Mao Ri, with incredible speed, charged beside one of the Foundation Establishment demonic beasts, blinding both its eyes. A terrifyingly sharp force penetrated from its eyes into the charred body of the demonic beast's head. Severely injuring its vital point!

The other demonic beast, its body covered in charred fire, frantically lunged at Zhou Qing. But a deep green small snake, with lightning-like speed, bit its neck, and the potent venom took effect. This demonic beast, which had just endured the thunder talisman bombardment, immediately plummeted from the sky.

Just as the Xuanyang Black Tiger was about to fight to the death and self-destruct its inner core, the Qinghuang Sword recovered. Under Zhou Qing's divine sense control, it pierced the Xuanyang Black Tiger's abdomen. The tip of the Qinghuang Sword erupted with terrifying Sword Qi of Malevolence, destroying the demonic soul within the inner core.

Innumerable black mists emerged from the Xuanyang Black Tiger's body, but Zhou Qing's entire body erupted with a black aura. A Fierce Tiger Dharmic Robe appeared, generating a terrifying suction that drew the black mists into the robe, as ferocious tiger roars constantly echoed. A lifelike black tiger appeared, covered in black mist, with wings.

They say one becomes a chang for the tiger, but at this moment, the residual demonic soul power of the Xuanyang Black Tiger served as a protector for Zhou Qing.

The colossal black tiger's body plummeted to the ground. The remaining Foundation Establishment demonic beasts scattered in frantic escape.

Zhou Qing was not in a hurry to pursue them. Instead, he first dealt the finishing blows to the remaining two late Foundation Establishment demonic beasts, then ice-sealed the corpses of the three powerful demonic beasts into empty storage pouches.

Mao Ri hovered in mid-air behind Zhou Qing, its entire body erupting with fire, like a great sun, or a sacred halo. Zhou Qing stood with his hands behind his back in the void, gazing down at the beast tide below.

The Great Dao is merciless; the demonic beasts beneath his feet were but disposable pawns!

One man, one rooster, had defeated eight Foundation Establishment-level demonic beasts, including a terrifying fifth-tier peak demonic beast like the Xuanyang Black Tiger.

"Truly unrivaled," an experienced Foundation Establishment cultivator exclaimed with emotion.

Within the beast tide, high in the sky.

It was as if a rising star of hope for the human race was emerging. Especially among the demonic cultivators of the Blood Demon Sect, the shock was absolute.

At this time, demonic cultivators from the Black Water Sect also arrived, witnessing Zhou Qing's grand battle with the Xuanyang Black Tiger from afar. In that final scene, they couldn't even tell which was the true demonic beast between Zhou Qing and the Xuanyang Black Tiger.

But as the dust settled, Zhou Qing, like a blazing sun, soared through the void. His fiery Blood Qi and Divine Sense, sweeping across the void as if the Great Dao itself were merciless, made them deeply realize that this was by no means a Demonic Seed Cultivator.

There was none of the insidious cunning of the Demonic Path, only overwhelming dominance and might!

***

Jingyang Dao Domain.

The first day of the beast tide dissipated with the lingering glow of the setting sun.

Zhou Qing's name resounded throughout the ten directions.
