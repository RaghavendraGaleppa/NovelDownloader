# Chapter 108: Enhancing the Foundation Establishment Pill

"Poria flower."

"Rootless wood."

"Juiceless fruit."

"Pure pond water."

"Bitter paste."

...

"Give me ten jin of each ten-year variety!"

At the Treasure Herb Pavilion, Lin Shan began his large-scale procurement.

The main ingredients listed in the Foundation Establishment Pill formula all required five-hundred-year-old specimens. 

However, aside from ancient sects or certain secret realms, few organizations had the patience to cultivate herbs for five hundred years. Still, many could manage short-term cultivation since these herbs weren't exclusively used for Foundation Establishment Pills.

Depending on medicinal properties and variety, the same herb could be used in different elixirs. What served as a main ingredient in one formula might be auxiliary in another—such cases were commonplace.

Lin Shan had calculated carefully. He would first purchase lower-grade herbs to concoct an "ultra-low-grade" version of the Foundation Establishment Pill. Then, with the enhancement panel's appraisal and verification, he could simply strengthen it to perfection.

However, Lin Shan remained cautious during his purchase, intentionally mixing in some useless herbs to obscure his true intentions.

Unexpectedly, the Treasure Herb Pavilion's clerk proved exceptionally sharp. While weighing the herbs, he suddenly realized these seemed to match the famous Foundation Establishment Pill formula—except everything was only ten years old and mixed with unrelated ingredients.

Was this some cultivation family attempting grafting experiments for long-term planning? Or perhaps an eccentric alchemy master trying to improve the pill formula, practicing with inferior materials first?

As the clerk pondered wildly, he gave Lin Shan a ten percent discount—standard policy for purchases exceeding one thousand spirit stones.

Lin Shan spent over a thousand spirit stones on thirty sets of materials. 

Next, he visited an artifact forge and bought a low-grade alchemy furnace for fifty spirit stones. 

At the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, he spent thirty spirit stones on beginner alchemy manuals—nothing advanced, just enough to get started with basic pill refinement.

...

Returning to his residence, Lin Shan buried himself in the cave abode's alchemy chamber, studying pill refinement techniques.

After a full month of relentless study, Lin Shan—now at Qi Refinement's Great Perfection—felt confident he could handle low-grade pills equivalent to the Innate Realm.

With ambitious determination, he set up the alchemy furnace and tossed in a set of ten-year Foundation Establishment Pill ingredients.

Following the furnace's instructional jade slip, he channeled his spiritual power into the device. The furnace converted his energy, drawing from the underground fire veins beneath the chamber as a dull yellow flame flickered to life inside.

Watching excitedly, Lin Shan swelled with pride—perhaps he could specialize in alchemy and feast on high-grade pills like candy!

Reality promptly delivered a harsh slap.

"Boom!"

Half a day later, a muffled explosion echoed through the cave.

"Clang! Rattle rattle—"

The furnace lid blasted off, smashing against the ceiling before clattering to the floor. Thick black smoke billowed out as a charred stench filled the chamber.

Lin Shan upended the furnace.

"Clink clink clink—"

A dozen irregular black pebbles tumbled out—his "masterpiece" after a month of study.

Picking up the pebbles, the enhancement panel appeared:

[Nameless Pill (Failed)]
Grade: Innate Pill
Description: Contains pill toxins. Excessive consumption may cause permanent cultivation damage to pre-Foundation Establishment cultivators.
Enhancement Cost: 8 points

...

"What the hell? I made poison?"

"Even failed pills can be enhanced?"

"Should I switch to poison-making?"

"Did my talent tree grow crooked?"

A barrage of questions flooded Lin Shan's mind before he finally collected himself. He had to admit—he truly lacked alchemical talent.

But Foundation Establishment was urgent. As long as he could manage something workable, that sufficed—he never planned to specialize in this.

After airing out the chamber and purifying the atmosphere, he reflected on what went wrong.

...

Over the next fortnight, intermittent explosions echoed through the cave.

Fortunately, low-grade pills didn't pack much power, and the furnace just barely held up. The soundproofing formations also prevented neighbor complaints.

However, Lin Shan's constant toxic emissions withered nearby plants and trees. Poisoned leaves falling into ponds even killed several spirit fish.

The cave managers couldn't ignore this. Though they couldn't evict Left Elder's subordinate, they issued repeated warnings—if environmental damage continued, all residents would vote to expel the polluter.

After much negotiation and compensation, plus gradual improvement in his technique (explosions became rarer, and pills started resembling spheres), Lin Shan finally made progress.

Having consumed most of his thirty sets, his notebooks overflowed with observations as he barely grasped alchemical fundamentals.

Then, during one batch, he finally produced a single "proper" pill among the failures.

[Nameless Pill]
Grade: Innate Pill
Description: Ultra-low-grade Foundation Establishment Pill. Slightly increases Qi-Spirit fusion success rate. Mildly erases Dao marks.
Enhancement Cost: 8 points

...

"Success!"

Lin Shan excitedly examined the fingernail-sized cyan pill emitting faint spiritual energy and herbal fragrance—most importantly, it possessed the Foundation Establishment Pill's core effects.

"Let's see if enhancement can make it a true Foundation Establishment Pill."

Rubbing his hands eagerly, Lin Shan mentally commanded: "Enhance!"

The pill shimmered, expanding slightly as rich herbal aroma blossomed. The panel updated:

[Nameless Pill]
Grade: Jade Pill
Description: Low-grade Foundation Establishment Pill. Moderately increases Qi-Spirit fusion success rate. Moderately erases Dao marks.
Enhancement Cost: 16 points

...

"Enhance again!"

Seeing hope, Lin Shan nearly jumped for joy, lips curling into a grin.

[Foundation Establishment Pill]
Grade: Dharma Pill
Description: Specialized pill for Foundation Establishment. Greatly increases Qi-Spirit fusion success rate. Can erase pre-Foundation Establishment Dao marks.
Enhancement Cost: 32 points

...

"YES!"

Lin Shan's triumphant laughter echoed through the soundproof chamber.

A Foundation Establishment Pill—created by his own hands!

Though each pill required two enhancements costing 24 ancient charm points, it was worth it.

The enhancement panel's products were guaranteed premium quality, far surpassing market alternatives. His Foundation Establishment prospects now looked bright!
