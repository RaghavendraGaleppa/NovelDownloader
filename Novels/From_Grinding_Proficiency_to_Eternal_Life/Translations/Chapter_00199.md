Chapter 199: Council

"Are you calling for souls in the middle of the night?"

"Senior Uncle, the Sect Master summons you. He requests you come to the Heavenly Work Hall immediately for a discussion."

"Forgive me, Senior Uncle."

Fu Li's Adam's apple bobbed three times before he managed to squeeze out a voice. "The议事灯 (Council Lamp) is lit in the Heavenly Work Hall. The Sect Master has asked someone from our Forging Hall to go over and discuss matters. Among us in the Forging Hall, you are the most qualified..."

Xu Yunfan sighed helplessly. The Forging Hall had quite a few veteran forging masters, but the vast majority of them were almost entirely devoted to forging weapons; how could they be bothered with such matters?

There were over a dozen inner disciples in the Forging Hall. Xu Yunfan thought it over.

"... "

It seemed he had to go.

Furthermore, he was the direct disciple of the Forging Hall Master, Zhan Yan. With both Zhan Yan and Fu Jin currently away, it was naturally up to him to take charge.

He told Fu Li to go on ahead first. Xu Yunfan put on his clothes and strapped on the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer. He listened as the locking mechanisms behind him clicked and engaged layer by layer around the hammer's handle. He then steadied the front and back steel mechanism boxes, and after confirming they were immovable, he hurried toward the Heavenly Work Hall at the center of Heavenly Work City.

When Xu Yunfan arrived at the Heavenly Work Hall, he realized that aside from himself, the heads of the other three halls had already gathered. Even the External Affairs Hall and the Hidden Edge Pavilion had sent the person currently in charge.

As Xu Yunfan stepped into the main hall, a smile couldn't help but appear on Hong Baichuan's face.

"You're here. Find a seat for now."

Mo Han gave him a slight nod, and his usually gloomy expression softened, a rare occurrence even for Mo Shisan.

These were all elders. Xu Yunfan naturally paid his respects to them one by one. After spotting the table for the Forging Hall, he sat down without ceremony.

Hong Baichuan swept his gaze over the six hall representatives present, as well as the few elders sitting calmly at the side.

Xu Yunfan secretly counted them. There were fewer than twenty people sitting behind the six long tables. Before the Cangzhou Great War, this hall was so packed that turning around would knock over three elders.

Now, only three elders remained, sitting on chairs not far away.

"Is everyone here?"

Hong Baichuan tapped the black jade table, the sound causing dust to fall in cascades from the beams.

He scanned the room, confirming that the people from the nine peaks and six departments, who were once numerous, were now reduced to this sparse gathering. He couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

"Since everyone is here, we all know each other well, so I won't beat around the bush."

Hong Baichuan paused, his expression turning grave. "Qi Huan is dead."

Hearing this news, Xu Yunfan's expression shifted slightly. The last time he met Qi Huan was when the latter, along with Pei Yan of the Sword Pavilion, went to the Xuanzhen Gate for the sects' martial competition. At the time, Hong Baichuan had personally asked Xu Yunfan if he was willing to go.

After Xu Yunfan flatly refused, he sent Qi Huan to participate instead. To show their重视 (importance), the Heavenly Work Cave had even dispatched a team led by a长老 (elder) at the Blood Transformation Realm.

After the battle in Cangzhou, the Heavenly Work Cave had lost two of its five original elders, and now their manpower was stretched thin.

Xu Yunfan swept his gaze across the room, observing the changes in everyone's facial expressions.

Most were surprised and astonished, but there was no sign of anger.

The acting manager from the External Affairs Hall, however, looked dazed, his face somewhat gloomy.

Originally, the Hidden Edge Pavilion had Qi Huan to represent it. Now that Qi Huan was dead, the Hidden Edge Pavilion was left with only a handful of people. In the future, it would likely undergo restructuring, perhaps even merging with other halls.

Finally, Wan Chen, the master of the Heavenly Work Department, rubbed his nose and said, "Was he killed in the sects' martial competition?"

This was a common occurrence. The sects' martial competition was inherently risky. There were countless people fighting on martial stages in the Jianghu every year, with uncountable deaths and injuries.

Hong Baichuan shook his head slightly. "From the latest intelligence, Qi Huan placed among the top sixteen in the great competition, qualifying him to enter the Xuanzhen Secret Realm. He died inside the secret realm."

Mo Han suddenly coughed. "Old Hong, stop being mysterious. How did Qi Huan die? I heard that not even an ant can be crushed in the Xuanzhen Secret Realm? Even if we are a small sect, surely the Xuanzhen Gate owes us an explanation?"

A strange look crossed Hong Baichuan's face.

"The Xuanzhen Gate sent a message saying that the Xuanzhen Secret Realm is indeed a place rich in spiritual energy, so crushing an ant is out of the question. However, not long after entering, half of the sky in the secret realm collapsed. Those without divine weapons to protect them vanished without a trace. From those who came out, we learned that many demons seem to have been born inside."

Upon hearing this, everyone in the hall looked at each other. Finally, Wan Chen let out a "Ha," and said with a hint of schadenfreude, "I knew the Xuanzhen Gate was being too generous. They opened the Xuanzhen Secret Realm right as spiritual energy was rising. It turns out they were treating us like barbarians."

Chu Xu, who rarely spoke, said, "Qi Huan was, after all, a disciple of our Heavenly Work Cave. His talent is not bad, and he grew up in the sect. He was the most qualified to take over the Hidden Edge Pavilion in the future."

Wan Chen, beside him, opened his mouth to say something, but then seemed to think of something else, and merely grumbled before turning his head away.

Xu Yunfan sat to the side with his arms crossed, his mind wandering, not saying a word.

He had no interest in participating in these matters. It was the middle of the night, and he just wanted to go back to sleep and meet that vicious woman in his dreams.

After discussing for a while and seeing that no one could reach a conclusion, Hong Baichuan finally had to make the decision. "We must find the person if he's alive, or his body if he's dead. Although our Heavenly Work Cave is not as powerful as the Xuanzhen Gate, we must still show our attitude..."

As he spoke, Hong Baichuan scanned the people below.

"I know you all hold a prejudice against Qi Huan because of Bao Yan's matter, but he grew up in the sect after all. You elders watched him grow up."

At these words, the perfunctory expressions on everyone's faces became more serious.

Mo Han pondered for a moment. "We should send someone to negotiate. Isn't the Sixth Elder still at the Xuanzhen Gate? Send him a message and have him inquire about the situation as soon as possible."

"... "

The discussion was incredibly tedious. Just deciding on the person to send took a long time. By the time Xu Yunfan walked out of the main hall, the moon was high in the sky, and nearly an hour had passed.

He had no intention of getting involved in this matter again. It was all trivialities in his eyes.

Usually, Hong Baichuan was fine, but once in a meeting, he would go on and on with废话 (nonsense) that prolonged the session.

At one point, they even considered sending him on a trip to the Xuanzhen Gate. Xu Yunfan naturally refused. He was perfectly fine staying within the Heavenly Work Cave and had no desire to go out.

To be honest, he hadn't even moved an inch while Zhan Yan was trapped in the Divine Weapon Ridge. He wouldn't leave unless it was absolutely necessary, so how could he possibly set out for the sake of Qi Huan?

Xu Yunfan lay back down, adjusted his state of mind, and quickly fell asleep.

Sometime later, the Extreme Dao Remnant on Xu Yunfan's chest suddenly emitted a faint, pearly light. The female skin suit, which had been contracted into soft armor, was unfurling like a newly hatched silkworm cocoon.

As the skin suit stirred, not a fraction of its luster had been eroded by a thousand years of time. Its mutton-fat jade-like texture析出 (exuded) semi-transparent patterns under the moonlight.

Wherever it flowed, it felt like silk dampened by the misty rain of Jiangnan; not even the sharpest blade's tip could catch a single rough thread.
