# Chapter 288: The Garment of the World Beyond, the Divine and Ghostly Fierce Garment! Foundation Deepens, Stepping into the Second Realm!

Li Xian closed his eyes to sense it. The wailing of ghosts and the howling of wolves intertwined with the melody of immortals, yet the two were perfectly harmonious without any conflict. It was both ethereal and fierce, both terrifying and transcendent. Such a phenomenon was never recorded in ancient texts; it was bizarrely strange.

It was as if the Gates of Hell had opened, with a horde of demons dancing wildly and all kinds of evil spirits playing the pipa frantically. It was also like a magnificent display of multicolored light, a grand banquet in the Heavenly Palace, where the sound of zithers flowed leisurely, and the gathering of immortals was grand, dancing together at the Yao Pool. The "Divine and Ghostly Fierce Garment" placed greater emphasis on the word "Fierce." Its fierce might was dazzling and majestic, causing both gods and ghosts to avoid it.

With a focused shout from Li Xian, the ghosts and demons retreated into the Ghost Gate, and the immortals rode the mist back to their abodes.

Li Xian already possessed the "Heavy Pupils," capable of driving away gods and ghosts and intimidating armies. It was extremely domineering. If he were to activate the "Divine and Ghostly Fierce Garment" on top of that, with his Heavy Pupils displayed, and all kinds of strange phenomena appearing, it would be an unimaginable sight.

"This Divine and Ghostly Fierce Garment is indeed powerful, but without ancient texts to reference, its exact function is still hard to figure out. However, when activating the Turbid Garment, its might increases dramatically, as if hell itself has descended to the mortal world. This is indeed an excellent use. Combined with the intimidation of the Heavy Pupils, I fear... if any more ghosts come knocking, I just need to shout loudly, and they will obediently flee."

Li Xian concealed the Turbid Garment, and the scenes of hell receded. He calmed his mind and sorted out his thoughts. The Turbid Garment was merely a characteristic; he always needed to prioritize "martial arts."

It was a leisurely day.

Li Xian looked inward at his body; he still had over a hundred strands of "Essence of Heaven and Earth" remaining. After fully digesting and absorbing them, it would be just enough to activate the "Settling of Dust" characteristic. After formally stepping into the Second Realm of martial arts, he would need to plan for "Refined Treasure" resources.

He thought that one should not be hasty in planning. He took out the "Residual Specter Painting" and studied it in the courtyard. The "Painting Ghost" school flourished and spread from Nanyang. The Residual Specter Painting had a long history and a rough texture, seemingly made from the skin of some kind of demon.

The painting was pitch black and required focused observation to see. Rough lines were faintly visible, appearing chaotic and formless at first glance. But upon closer inspection, they contained profound meaning...

The Residual Specter Painting was only the size of a palm, with torn edges. A light sniff revealed the scent of ink and a burnt odor, as if it had been burned. The original painting likely depicted four minor ghosts: "Chī, Mèi, Wǎng, and Liáng," imitating the "Chī Mèi Wǎng Liáng Painting" of the Candle Cult. Because the imitation was damaged, only the "Wǎng Ghost" remained in one corner, hence it was called the Residual Specter Painting.

The color tone of the painting was extremely dark, requiring one to stare intently. It depicted a "naked, long-clawed" minor ghost. The bold and flowing lines conveyed a "ghostly aura," indeed possessing a terrifying effect.

Li Xian knew that the "Residual Specter Painting" contained profound mysteries. He originally wanted to discuss the cultivation method of the "Residual Specter Spear" with Nan'gong Liuli, using her noble family's knowledge to assist. However, he saw that she had been frightened by a ghost's shout and her mind was not yet settled. They had only truly cooperated last night, allowing her mind to calm slightly. Thinking that this "Residual Specter Painting" had already scared several elders silly, it would be inappropriate if it harmed Nan'gong Liuli.

Thus, he pondered alone.

The secrets of martial arts are hidden within the painting, so they should be contemplated from the painting. The Wǎng Ghost plays in the water, willow trees cast shade, and in the distance, a few disemboweled corpses are dotted. The grass rustles, and two or three emaciated, barely-clothed individuals are hung upside down from willow trees, their expressions terrified, as if not yet dead. A few lines depict the blowing wind, desolate and grotesque. In the distance, there seems to be a village, with two or three wisps of black smoke drifting...

The scenery in the painting is extremely rich.

Li Xian had a slight understanding of Nanyang's history, where the people lived in destitution, a sight too miserable to behold. He observed the painting carefully, deliberating on its details, and thought:

"Martial arts are hidden within the painting, and there should be two possibilities. First: the painter themselves possessed considerable martial arts prowess, and the martial arts are contained within the lines. Every dot, hook, and stroke contains the essence of martial arts. The patterns of the painting itself are not very important. That is, by imitating the painter's movements and demeanor during the act of painting, one can obtain a martial arts inheritance."

"Second: the martial arts are hidden within the painting itself, requiring one to comprehend the expression within the painting and appreciate its artistic conception. Judging from this painting, it likely belongs to the second type. The second type is the most difficult, so it's no wonder many elders failed."

"My reckless boasting and the bet with Yan Hao were indeed overestimating my capabilities. But since the opportunity is right before me, how can I not strive for it? I have been observing this painting for half an hour. Meditating with my eyes closed yields no benefit. The priority is to get a spear first!"

"Combining movement and stillness might lead to some insight."

Li Xian acted on his words. He found a blacksmith shop on East Street and bought an iron spearhead. Then he slipped into the forest, cut down a peach tree, and carved it into a spear shaft. He tied the iron spearhead to the shaft, creating a crude spear.

He held the peach wood spear and thrust it into the empty air a few times. The "whooshing" wind sounded, and its might was quite impressive. He casually executed the "Bandit-Suppressing Spear Technique," sweeping, thrusting,拨, chopping... it was quite proficient.

In the past, while stationed at Black River Village, they had provoked mountain bandits. For self-preservation, Li Xian armed the villagers and taught them the "Bandit-Killing Formation." He also arranged the "Bandit-Suppressing Spear Technique" based on his martial arts understanding, allowing the villagers to learn it quickly.

This Bandit-Suppressing Spear Technique was merely a foundation of spear techniques, without any subtlety. Spear techniques were quick to learn and easy to arrange in formations, which proved very useful at the time. Li Xian carried the spear back to his residence, took out the "Residual Specter Painting," and attempted to practice the method.

He pressed the Residual Specter Painting under the table in the stone pavilion and found an open space to practice the spear. He thrust,拨, and swept continuously, then performed several spear flowers, his posture extremely elegant. But it had nothing to do with the "Residual Specter Spear."

He had a sudden thought: "Could it be that I need to use the spear as a brush, and depict the Residual Specter Painting while executing the moves? Let me try!"

He turned back with his spear and caught a glimpse of the "Wǎng Ghost" in the painting. He saw its naked body with long claws, a ferocious face, and cunning, sinister ghost eyes. He brandished the peach wood spear, and the spear tip attempted to outline the ghost's appearance.

This was indeed a wonderful idea. When Li Xian wielded the spear, he combined his surrounding understanding, stepped on the Seven Star Steps, and controlled his strength with precision. It actually had a rather eerie sensation, and the spear was unpredictable when it shot out.

Li Xian practiced according to this method. After the first round, he felt nothing. When he practiced the second round, he suddenly felt the spear technique was constrained by the painting, rigid like a dead object. It absolutely lacked the essence of a mid-tier spear technique and could barely be classified as a basic spear technique. Although it was partly due to lack of proficiency, it showed that using the spear to depict the painting was indeed wrong.

"Others must have thought of this method too. Practicing like this makes it difficult to grasp the essence of the painting. To obtain a mid-tier spear technique but practice it into a mediocre one, what good is that? My spear technique has just started; I shouldn't rush for progress. Instead, I must ensure the direction is correct."

Li Xian calmed his mind and sat cross-legged to regulate his breath. Then he picked up the Residual Specter Painting and repeatedly observed it. After many attempts, he suddenly felt enlightened.

Previously, when he refined his organs with turbid energy, he had gained the "Enlightenment" and "Observing the World" characteristics from the Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meridian. Combined with his extraordinary comprehension, it naturally produced miraculous effects.

His perception of all things became more vivid.

He saw the Wǎng Ghost in the Residual Specter Painting as if it were alive, playing with the water and its reflection, creating ripples. The willow trees by the water were lifted high, proving the wind was strong that night. Li Xian immersed himself in this, feeling as if he had grasped something... He suddenly thought:

"I always wanted to find a complete method directly from the scroll, always assuming the secret was hidden deep within, and how to dig deep. However... the secret is neither deep nor shallow. In fact, when you first glance at it, it's already all in view."

"Every stroke in the painting, every blade of grass and tree, every stone and drop of water, are all martial arts moves. And the residual specter ghost in the painting is the essence of the Residual Specter Spear Technique."

"When others observe the Residual Specter Painting, they inevitably assume the essence of the martial arts is hidden within the Wǎng Ghost. Therefore, they stare intently at the Wǎng Ghost, hoping to discover the martial arts essence from it. However, in this painting, the scenery is painted first, then the ghost, which corresponds to 'heaven and earth come first, then man.'"

"They start by intensely practicing the most essential part of the spear technique. How could they succeed? This simple truth took me a long time to figure out!"

The more Li Xian thought about it, the more he felt this was the case. Inspiration gushed forth. He felt the world within the painting, and the eerie, gloomy sensation washed over him. The "Wǎng Ghost" was terrifying, covered in fine, soft fur. Its ghost eyes stared at him, cunning and sinister, with ill intent. Li Xian focused on the weeds on the roadside. With just two strokes, they were also refined.

He saw the green grass being blown down by the wind, leaning to the left. But judging from its growth, it would stand upright again after the gust of wind passed. This already contained two sets of spear moves.

Li Xian's legs grew roots, and he thrust out. His posture was like the fallen grass, flexible yet carrying the momentum of the wind. His attack was fierce, yet it concealed a path of retreat! This move was quite extraordinary. A moment later, he pulled back his spear and stood upright.

At this point, he had touched the finer details of the Residual Specter Spear. Although the spear lacked any ghostly or evil aura, it was indeed a spear technique.

Li Xian's mind wandered. The painting was a dead object, but the world within it was alive. The residual wind swirled, grass and plants leaned left and right. Any change could be used as a spear practice.

Originally...

The painting carries martial arts. Since it breaks free from the framework of traditional martial arts, the moves naturally cannot be defined. Li Xian's mind wandered, from the fine details of the environment, he comprehended the principles of the spear technique. This concept was extremely correct. The spear technique he executed now was strange and eccentric, even chaotic and random, without any pattern.

But it already possessed the essence of the Residual Specter Spear.

He practiced vigorously. Although he had not yet touched the true essence of the spear technique and did not know its true power, he was already quite satisfied. The spear technique went from unfamiliar to agile, then to casual, and finally to unrestrained and free.

He suddenly executed a move "Probing the Grass to Startle the Ghost." It was a feint, but its momentum was huge, possessing the strange effect of startling ghosts. He had领悟ed this from the clump of weeds in the corner of the Residual Specter Painting.

He speculated... among the weeds, there might be a small ghost peeking. Thus, he naturally executed this move. It could be said that this was exactly the essence of practicing the "Residual Specter Painting." By letting the spirit of the painting wander, one could extend infinite spear techniques from the limited scenery!

[You have grasped the essence of the Residual Specter Painting and mastered the key to spear technique practice, initiating the cultivation of the Residual Specter Spear Technique.]

[Residual Specter Spear]

[Proficiency: 13/700 Initiate]

[Description: A spear technique of the ghostly and divine school, unpredictable and eerie, with ghostly shadows in abundance. Wǎng... belongs to the category of water bodies, swallowing shadows and playing in water.]

Li Xian felt instantly invigorated. He was originally intelligent and cautious, able to distinguish priorities, so it was not surprising that he领悟ed the essence of the Residual Specter Spear. Since he had grasped the key to practicing the Residual Specter Spear, there would be no more difficulties in the future. Only "Heaven rewards the diligent," and he needed to work hard and accumulate.

Full of excitement, he observed the Residual Specter Painting and thrust his long spear repeatedly. Proficiency accumulated bit by bit, tirelessly and diligently, advancing with a heavy heart.

Two hours passed, and he had accumulated 156 points of proficiency. Li Xian was covered in sweat and felt hungry and tired. After a simple wash, he went out to buy food. He was craving "Peach Blossom Fresh Brew" and "Flower-Infused Drunken Eggs."

He thought: "As the saying goes, 'The old must go for the new to come.' This half a tael of silver is useless if kept, so I might as well eat and drink heartily. Once I've spent it all, I'll find a way to make money."

He felt quite helpless... making money was the hardest thing for him. It was not wrong that his strength was gradually deepening and his cultivation was advancing, but he had no ability to produce "resources." A martial artist must master production and be self-sufficient... to be independent and stand on their own, and slowly advance in martial arts.

Li Xian was well-versed in various forms of management. But lacking any industry, he suddenly envied Wen Caishang's "Silk Garment Jade-Crafting Technique." It was a奇功 of the era, with profound capabilities. It could nurture ancestral silkworms, sell silk, and the flow of funds would never be lacking.

Moreover, with Wen Caishang's strategy, she would surely manage it perfectly. Li Xian sighed: "Some people are born without worrying about money, while some are almost a Second Realm martial artist but still can't afford good wine."

He turned into an alley, bought two jars of fine wine and four Flower-Infused Drunken Eggs. With the few remaining coins, he simply spent them all on two braised pork hocks and a few side dishes for drinking. He wrapped them in oil paper and brought them back to the Green Ox Residence.

When he entered, Nan'gong Liuli was already awake. She held a wooden sword, honing her martial arts moves, executing the Nan'gong family's basic martial art: Floating and Drifting Rain and Wind Sword.

这套 sword technique was created by a talented member of the Nan'gong family in the last decade or so. Although powerful, it was not as good as the hereditary "Nan'gong眷天 Sword," and it was not very complete, with obstructions in practice. Nan'gong Liuli had excellent talent, but she had only just reached the Great Completion stage.

Li Xian praised: "Good sword technique!"

Nan'gong Liuli sheathed her sword and smiled, "You're back." She went to help, taking the wine jar and oil paper.

Li Xian said, "Good sister, your sword technique seems to contain a concern for the country and its people?" Nan'gong Liuli shook her head. "Nan'gong Boyuan of the Nan'gong family holds the aura of fortune and serves as an official in the court. He created 'Poems of Rain and Wind,' which is widely renowned. The family changed the sword technique to Floating and Drifting Rain and Wind Sword. The sword technique contains the true meaning of the poems, so it naturally also possesses a concern for the country and its people."

Li Xian said, "Does the Nan'gong family want to support the weak martial artists?" Nan'gong Liuli said, "How can I know the family's intentions? It's all uncertain. After all, one doesn't put all eggs in one basket; there are various arrangements."

Li Xian said, "It must be quite exhausting to live as a noble family." He thought of his traveling brother, who possessed the aura of fortune and had a boundless future. He then asked, "I have a brother who also obtained a strand of the aura of fortune. Will he also become an official in the future?"

Nan'gong Liuli was surprised, "You have such a厉害 brother?"

Nan'gong Liuli said, "Those who possess the aura of fortune can ensure their safety even in troubled times. Even if they don't become officials, they can join a family and serve as retainers. Even the Nan'gong family would treat them with respect."

Li Xian smiled, "That厉害?"

"The aura of fortune in the world is fixed. If you occupy one strand, others have one less." Nan'gong Liuli said, "Do you see how powerful that is?"

The two walked to the stone pavilion by the fruit tree. Li Xian opened the wine jar, and Nan'gong Liuli unwrapped the oil paper. She smelled the aroma of the braised pork hock and couldn't help but swallow secretly. Li Xian filled the wine bowls, drank with Nan'gong Liuli, and then learned more about the aura of fortune from her.

Those who possess the aura of fortune... can indeed preserve their lives in troubled times. But those who possess it must choose a tree to roost on. Now that troubled times are brewing, becoming an official in the court inevitably carries the danger of downfall. Entering a noble family... also has other drawbacks.

Although they are respected as "Misters," and even martial arts experts dare not be disrespectful, they are ultimately outsiders, a status that cannot be changed. Li Xian sighed that all paths are difficult, and only by studying diligently and becoming stronger can one succeed.

Nan'gong Liuli had never tasted "Peach Blossom Fresh Brew" or "Flower-Infused Drunken Eggs." She sipped the fine wine, and her beautiful eyes flickered. Then she tasted the drunken egg, gently taking a bite, and found the flavor very special.

After eating her fill, her cheeks were slightly flushed, and her beautiful eyes were full of charm. Li Xian helped her to rest, and returned to the courtyard two hours later.

[Proficiency +1]

[Proficiency +1]

The Residual Specter Spear Technique gradually improved. By the end of the day, he had accumulated 259 points of proficiency. The spear technique was plain and unadorned, and the ghostly and eerie aura had not yet been displayed, but the direction was correct.

By evening.

Li Xian had left two handprints on the peach wood spear shaft. If he practiced for two more days, the shaft would break. Nan'gong Liuli was also diligent, practicing her family's martial arts by his side.

The two ate and drank together, practiced and enjoyed themselves together, quite carefree and at ease. Peach Blossom Town was quiet and peaceful, unlike being trapped in the Flower Cage Gate.

The next day.

Li Xian, believing that Heaven rewards the diligent, made progress every day. While honing the "Residual Specter Spear," he secretly planned a way to make money. He had abundant energy and took some leisure time to go deep into the mountains to chop peach trees.

He stored the wood in the southwest corner of the outer courtyard. He had chopped about four peach trees in total. He carried the trees on his shoulder and strode swiftly through the streets and alleys, attracting the attention of many residents.

Li Xian was certain the peach wood spear shaft would not last long. It would break in a few days, so he prepared in advance by turning the peach trees into shafts to use as replacements.

But the remaining wood could also be carved into wooden arrows. Li Xian was busy all day, and this miscellaneous task was left to Nan'gong Liuli to handle.

With her slender, jade-like hands, she carved arrows for him. Nan'gong Liuli wore a loose-fitting gown, sitting casually, her long hair simply pinned with a wooden hairpin. She held an iron dagger in her hand, carving the peach wood into wooden arrows.

Li Xian practiced his spear in the distance. The spear technique was exquisite, full of a free, unrestrained, and willful artistic conception.

Nan'gong Liuli asked curiously, "You know archery?" She had already carved one wooden arrow and placed it in the quiver.

Li Xian said, "A little." Nan'gong Liuli said, "That's rare. I also know archery. How about we compete sometime?"

Li Xian smiled, "Oh?" He shook his head and said, "Forget it, it would be a bit of a bully."

Nan'gong Liuli's dagger paused, and she said angrily, "Who do you look down on? Your archery might not be better than mine!"

Li Xian asked, "When did you start learning archery?" Nan'gong Liuli said, "I started learning archery before I began practicing martial arts."

Li Xian thought, this is truly not something to underestimate. He said, "Do you like archery?"

Nan'gong Liuli said, "Not really, but archery is a basic skill for the direct line. Every direct descendant of the Nan'gong family must master it. Moreover... one's character can be seen in their archery: sharp, cautious, cunning, or cowardly."

Li Xian said, "I've heard this from others." Nan'gong Liuli said, "Speaking of archery, Sister Bian is also quite good."

"But if you're talking about the best... it should be the Golden Boy of Daoxuan Mountain."

Nan'gong Liuli put down her dagger, smoothed her dress, and sat properly, instructing him with great seriousness: "Not that I'm lecturing you. Although you possess the Pure Gang Qi Garment, you cannot be arrogant. There are even more powerful figures in this world."

Li Xian smiled, "Good sister, thank you for your advice. I'll show you my prowess in a bit."

Nan'gong Liuli's pretty face flushed slightly, she gave a light spit, and continued carving the wooden arrows.

Through their casual chat, Li Xian remembered that his "archery" had been neglected for a long time. His archery, which had reached the pinnacle, was a trump card for fighting strong enemies. He should indeed pick it up again, accumulate arrows, and make a bow.

This day was full and peaceful. The proficiency of the Residual Specter Spear increased by another 218 points. It was not far from mastery. Li Xian knew he had plenty of time, so he practiced the Residual Specter Spear at a relaxed pace, leaving spare time to handle other miscellaneous matters.

Sincere cooperation and emotional exchange were also of utmost importance.

In this way, several days passed. The Residual Specter Spear stepped into the [Mastery] level, and the bet with Yan Hao was already a victory. He felt it was not something to be proud of and continued to focus on honing the [Residual Specter Spear].

Two spear shafts had already been broken. The broken peach wood shafts were picked up by Nan'gong Liuli and carved into wooden arrows. In these few days, thirty wooden arrows had been accumulated, but without fletching, they were still half a step short.

Whenever he had spare time, Li Xian would钻 into the peach forest. He wanted to select wood to prepare a "wooden bow." His strength was immense, and ordinary wooden bows were useless, which was why he had arrows but no bow for so long.

This continued for several more days.

Late July.

[Residual Specter Spear]

[Proficiency: 784/1400 Mastery]

The Residual Specter Spear was already very proficient. The flowers and grass, the detailed landscapes in the painting had been honed to perfection. But the essence of the "Wǎng Ghost" had never been touched. At this time, there were still more than twenty days left until the bet. Li Xian studied leisurely, neither in a hurry nor impatience.

This day...

Li Xian went into the mountains to chop wood and顺便 caught some fish and birds. He always said he wanted to make money, but to this day, he was penniless. His food relied entirely on hunting and fishing.

He carried two grass carp and caught twenty "Cawing Birds." The meat of this bird was coarse and fishy, with a terrible taste, so few people hunted it. Li Xian was accumulating arrows. He had the shafts, but was extremely short of fletching and arrowheads.

Since he was顺便 catching "Cawing Birds," he plucked their feathers to use as fletching. He had a bountiful harvest this day and was about to return home when he suddenly saw several woodcutters walking out from a distant part of the deep forest, carrying bundles of firewood on their shoulders and chatting.

The island was large, with rich vegetation and no landlords to occupy it. The management of firewood was very loose, and obtaining it was not difficult.

Li Xian walked the same path and heard the woodcutters talking only about family affairs, so he paid no attention. But after listening for a while... he suddenly heard the topic change to strange tales of spirits.

Li Xian was always interested in such strange and unusual matters, so he slowed his pace to listen. When he heard the "Peach Blossom Tree Spirit," he became extremely interested and stepped forward to ask.

He learned that in the forest to the east, there had always been a "tree spirit." It was very similar to a peach blossom tree, but its branches would extend to attack woodcutters.

Li Xian immediately thought: "Can this kind of tree spirit be used as a wooden bow? I'll go take a look. If something's wrong, I'll flee immediately." He headed east.

It was already dusk. After walking for a while, it became completely dark. Li Xian had extremely strong vision and walked in the night, observing the details of the peach forest. He searched for about half an hour and indeed found the "tree spirit."

The tree spirit could not move. Its lower branches extended, quietly wrapping around the ankles, and then dragging them down. The soil next to the tree spirit was soft and sticky. Once pulled into the soil, the tree spirit's roots, which were already numerous, would become more entangled in the soil. Even a martial arts expert... without corresponding methods, would suffer.

The tree spirit's appearance was no different from an ordinary peach tree, but after discovering Li Xian, it had already quietly extended its roots,绕开 Li Xian's field of vision, intending to attack from behind.

Li Xian, with his Heavy Pupils, had already seen it. But he pretended not to know, wandering around as if lost. When he passed by the tree spirit, he secretly activated the "Heart Fire" characteristic and executed the "Blood Spitting Code."

He spat赤 fire, burning the tree spirit.

Li Xian saw his chance and swung the "Yang Yuan Sword Qi" with his Sinking River Sword. One sword strike failed to cut it through. Instead of being surprised, Li Xian was delighted. He struck three more times, and finally, with a "tearing" sound, he cut the tree trunk in half. The tree spirit fell, and blood gushed from the trunk.

Li Xian carried the tree trunk, feeling its weight. The surrounding mud was soft, and his feet immediately sank. The roots in the soil immediately wrapped around him. Li Xian used the trunk as a staff, and with a "thump," he shook the soil within several zhang, sending it flying.

He used the force to leap up, stepped on the Seven Star Steps, and moved several zhang away. His feet were on solid ground, with no more softness. He observed the trunk bleeding, and the soil turning even more blood-red...

Li Xian threw a flower rope. He wrapped the tree trunk and pulled hard. This immense strength was truly terrifying. The peach spirit tree trunk flew up and was carried on his shoulder.

He immediately executed the "Seven Star Steps" and ran out of the deep forest as fast as possible. He returned to the Green Ox Residence in one breath, panting heavily.

Nan'gong Liuli was surprised.

Li Xian patted the tree trunk and smiled, "Excellent bow material!"

He peeled off the bark, and the wood underneath was crimson, looking like jade at first glance. The wood was abundant and could be used to make a peach wood spear, two peach wood bows, and dozens of peach wood arrows...

In the blink of an eye, it was August. Half of the day for the bet had passed.

This morning.

Li Xian sat cross-legged, practicing internally, refining his organs with turbid energy. His hair fell, and upon touching the ground, it took root. The dust settled, and he formally stepped into the Second Realm of martial arts.

He raised his eyebrows slightly...

The characteristics of this Second Realm seemed to be different.
