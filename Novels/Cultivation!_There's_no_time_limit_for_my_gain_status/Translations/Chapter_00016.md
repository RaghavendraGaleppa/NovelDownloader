# Chapter 16: "Ghostwood Technique"

Ancient matters were temporarily set aside—mere speculation held no meaning. Jiang Li turned his attention to the other two manuals.

"Burial Coffin Technique" was a legacy scripture from a once-prosperous rogue cultivator family specializing in corpse manipulation. After the family's decline, their descendants brought the manual to the Hidden Scripture Valley, where it became part of the collection. Legend had it that during their peak, this family produced a Nascent Soul cultivator, which was also the cultivation limit of this technique.

The "Ghostwood Technique" was more peculiar. It wasn't originally created by humans but came from a thousand-year-old locust tree that had cultivated into a demonic entity. According to records, this locust demon once wreaked havoc, turning hundreds of miles of land into a graveyard, its power terrifying enough to reach the Earth Immortal realm—beyond Nascent Soul. Eventually, the heavens struck it down with heavenly tribulation, and later generations discovered this technique inscribed on the remnants of its trunk.

Jiang Li's expression soured. One technique required lying in a coffin buried underground to cultivate, while the other demanded sleeping in graveyards daily. Practicing either would likely make him a target for righteous extermination. Moreover, he had always assumed cultivation techniques could take one all the way to immortality. He hadn't realized they had upper limits.

After much deliberation, Jiang Li chose the "Ghostwood Technique" as his foundational method. Not only was its ceiling higher than the "Burial Coffin Technique," but he also couldn't stomach the idea of being buried alive daily.

With his selection made, Jiang Li headed for the exit. Since he only had three options, his decision was swift. Most disciples, including Yan Hong, were still agonizing over their choices.

At the counter before the metal gate, the elder who had opened the door earlier and Elder Weng Sanqi sat discussing which spirit wine tasted better.

"Elders, I've made my choice."

Jiang Li respectfully placed the "Ghostwood Technique" on the counter and waited patiently.

After finishing their drinks, the elders finally glanced at Jiang Li and the manual.

"The 'Ghostwood Technique' is a decent choice. Boy, bow your head."

The Scripture Hall elder formed hand seals, and the manual's pages loosened, becoming readable.

"Since you're polite, I'll help you further."

From under the counter, the elder produced a slender, translucent jade slip and pressed it against the manual. Countless inky characters crawled like ants from the pages into the slip. Moments later, the words "Ghostwood Technique" appeared on the jade. With a tap, the elder pressed the cool slip against Jiang Li's forehead.

"Don't resist. Focus and calm your mind!"

Seeing no reason for malice, Jiang Li allowed it. A refreshing coolness flooded his mind, followed by profound, complex text and ten intricate diagrams etching themselves into his memory.

"The locust tree—ghost among woods! Its roots drink from the Yellow Springs of the underworld! Its leaves shroud the moon's gaze!..."

Within breaths, thousands of cryptic words and images were imprinted. Dizzy, Jiang Li braced himself against the counter.

"Haha! Dizzy, aren't you? Lucky for you, using a jade slip before even reaching Qi Refining is rare."

Elder Weng's voice sounded as a gentle force steadied him onto a nearby cushion.

"Thank Elder Li properly once you recover."

Rubbing his temples, Jiang Li marveled at the jade slip's efficiency—instantly transferring knowledge. Checking his status panel, he saw: [Ghostwood Technique (Qi Refining Chapter) Lv0]. Only the Qi Refining segment? Disappointing.

Around him, other disciples groaned while copying texts manually—except for those with superior spiritual roots, who also received jade transmissions.

"Thank you, Elder Li! Elder Weng!"

Jiang Li bowed deeply. The slip's included explanations saved him days of study—a massive advantage over peers struggling to copy or even read.

"Your first month's resources. Collect them monthly from the Outer Sect Affairs Hall. Attend weekly lectures. Now, go cultivate."

Elder Weng tossed him a pouch and dismissed him.

Outside, Jiang Li waited briefly before Yan Hong emerged. They returned quietly to the outer sect.

In his cottage, Jiang Li unpacked his pouch: three spirit stones, two pill bottles—ten Qi-Nourishing Pills and ten Qi-Restoring Pills, all low-grade.

[Qi-Nourishing Pill: Assists cultivation.]  
[Qi-Restoring Pill: Replenishes Qi.]

Yan Hong's haul was nearly double—five stones and twenty pills each. Without hesitation, Yan Hong pushed half toward Jiang Li.

"Jiang Li, take these."

Touched, Jiang Li declined. "My technique has unique needs. Let's split future gains instead."

After some banter, they parted to attempt their first cultivation session.

Assuming a meditative posture, Jiang Li visualized a locust seed—gray-brown with a faint crack. An hour later, stiff and frustrated, he exhaled. Despite his martial arts experience, grasping that elusive first wisp of Qi proved daunting.

The manual warned against using pills for the initial Qi—impurities could cause future bottlenecks. Glancing outside, he realized daytime wasn't ideal for the ghostwood-attuned technique. Night would be better.

Setting cultivation aside, he checked his surroundings. Everyone was absorbed in practice. Satisfied, he locked his doors and windows, then retrieved a handkerchief from his robe—a love token from a girl on the caravan whose name he never learned.

Unwrapping it revealed a flat, palm-sized stone.

[Item: Stone with Hidden Contents]  
[Type: Miscellaneous]  
[Contents: Unknown]  
[Note: Will curiosity kill you this time?]

This was the stone he'd found during the journey—guarded jealously by the scale-demons, especially the albino one. Its importance was undeniable. After biding his time, he finally had the privacy to uncover its secrets.
