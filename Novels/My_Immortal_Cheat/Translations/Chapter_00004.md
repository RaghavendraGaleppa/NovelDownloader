# Chapter 4: The Engagement?

"Uh... how about I pack a pound for you to take with you later?" Zhou Tian rubbed his head. How come his forehead didn't glow when *he* drank it?

Tian Ling opened her eyes, her bright, clear gaze fixed on Zhou Tian. Her expression was unreadable. A moment later, she spoke, "You're... different from what the rumors say."

Zhou Tian was momentarily stunned, then intrigued. "Different? What do the rumors say about me?"

"They say you're utterly decadent, spending your days in drink and debauchery." Tian Ling slowly replied, cradling her teacup.

"Haha, that actually sounds like me," Zhou Tian chuckled, then continued, "But right now, I'm just putting on an act. I can't appear utterly decadent in front of such a beautiful girl, can I?"

"Pfft," Tian Ling couldn't help but laugh, a blush appearing on her crystal-clear, jade-like cheeks.

"Do you know why I came here this time?" Tian Ling asked softly, the lingering smile still on her face.

"That, I truly don't know," Zhou Tian admitted honestly, completely bewildered.

"I came to see what kind of person my future... husband is!" Tian Ling turned her head away, her fair, pretty earlobes gradually turning red.

*What the hell?!*

"Are you saying... me?" Zhou Tian wore an utterly dumbfounded expression. This was far too melodramatic! An arranged childhood marriage, even a betrothal before birth... oh, well, they were similar enough.

"You still didn't know?" Tian Ling had already returned to her usual composure as she asked.

"My father hasn't told me yet. Are you here to break off the engagement?" Zhou Tian asked after a moment of silence. Wasn't this the typical protagonist's trope? Should he perhaps yell, "Thirty years in the east, thirty years in the west, never bully a young man in poverty!"?

"Break off the engagement?" Tian Ling said in a strange tone. "Our Haotian Sect has no desire to be annihilated. This marriage was bestowed by Emperor Qin; no one can defy it."

"........." Zhou Tian was speechless, not knowing what to say. He certainly couldn't tell a joke in this situation. The atmosphere once again fell into an extremely awkward silence.

"Then you..." Zhou Tian began to ask, but before he could finish, Tian Ling interrupted him.

"I have no objections. I was raised by the Sect Master from a young age, and the Haotian Sect has nurtured me for so many years. Now, they're not asking me to go into a mountain of knives or a sea of fire; they're merely asking me to marry."

Zhou Tian stood beside Tian Ling, gazing at her exquisite profile. A wisp of subtle fragrance wafted into his nostrils. *Is this going to be my wife?* Zhou Tian found himself with even fewer objections. As long as she was beautiful, a lack of emotional foundation could be cultivated through intimacy over time. That wasn't an issue.

"Hahaha..." A hearty laugh boomed from outside the door. By the sound, it was Zhou Yi. Zhou Yi wore a helpless expression; he now understood that this was just like a blind date in his previous life—the elders leave first to let the young ones chat.

"I hope I didn't interrupt you two?" Zhou Yi pushed the door open, smiling, with Uncle Zhou following behind him. Only the two of them were there; Elder Li had not come along.

"Not at all. I had a very pleasant conversation with Brother Zhou." It was Tian Ling who spoke. Zhou Tian was too lazy to say anything. He'd been engaged without even knowing it himself. Even though his fiancée was incredibly beautiful, he still had to show some attitude.

"Tian Ling, Elder Li has already chosen a place. Uncle Zhou will take you there in a moment," Zhou Yi said. His intention was obvious: he wanted Tian Ling to leave first.

Tian Ling was astute and naturally understood the hidden meaning in Zhou Yi's words. She nodded and said, "Then I'll go familiarize myself with the place first. Farewell, Uncle Qin King. Farewell, Brother Zhou."

Zhou Tian smiled and nodded. Tian Ling then followed Uncle Zhou and left.

After Tian Ling left, Zhou Tian's expression immediately fell. Seeing his disgruntled look, Zhou Yi said displeased, "What's with that face? You're all smiles with a pretty girl, but you pull a long face when you see your own father."

"So you still remember I'm your son, huh?" Zhou Tian shot him a glance and continued, "You arranged my engagement, and I'm the last one to know about it!"

"Er..." Zhou Yi choked a bit. This was indeed his fault. "It's not because you've been so muddled the past few days? I just couldn't find a suitable opportunity to tell you."

After saying that, Zhou Yi teased, "What, suddenly having such a beautiful wife makes you less muddled?"

"I..." Now it was Zhou Tian who choked. He couldn't very well say that he'd just transmigrated a few days ago and was feeling lost, could he? "For the past few days, I was mainly thinking about what my future would be like."

This was indeed true. After transmigrating and realizing how dangerous this world was, and that he was a cripple unable to cultivate, Zhou Tian was indeed lost regarding his future. However, in Zhou Yi's ears, it took on a different meaning. Zhou Tian was his third son. Because of Zhou Tian's birth, his wife, Zhou Tian's mother, had also been murdered. She had sacrificed her own life, using her life essence to save him. This made Zhou Yi feel extremely guilty, believing it was his responsibility.

Therefore, his love for Zhou Tian was even deeper. When Zhou Tian was first discovered to have blocked meridians, the most pained person wasn't Zhou Tian, but Zhou Yi, because he believed it was a lingering illness from Zhou Tian's birth. Now, in his eyes, Zhou Tian was suffering again because of his inability to cultivate, which made Zhou Yi feel terrible.

After a moment of silence, Zhou Yi said, "Tian'er, don't worry. Even if you cannot cultivate, I will ensure you enjoy boundless glory and wealth. Whatever you desire in this world, even if you want the stars from the sky, your father will pluck them down for you!"

When Zhou Yi spoke these words, his tone was firm and unwavering. As the Imperial Surname King of the Tianqin Empire, he had both the qualifications and the ability to say such things.

As for Zhou Tian, hearing these words... how should he put it? It was a little awkward. After all, his psychological age was already over twenty; he wasn't a child anymore. If the original owner of this body had heard it, he might truly have been deeply moved. But now, Zhou Tian only felt embarrassment.

"Let's talk about what's going on with Tian Ling first," Zhou Tian quickly changed the subject. He didn't know what else to do—cry out "Father!" and hug him? Just imagining that scene gave him goosebumps; it was too awkward.

Zhou Yi didn't mind. Zhou Tian not dwelling on his inability to cultivate was something he wished for. He began, "This matter was also a coincidence. The Haotian Sect is the strongest force among the subordinate factions of my Tianqin Empire. However, some time ago, they were instigated by forces from other states and developed some improper ambitions."

At this point, a cold glint flashed in Zhou Yi's eyes. The Haotian Sect had been a subordinate force of the Tianqin Empire for many years. The Tianqin Empire had protected them and treated them generously, never treating them as mere servants or cannon fodder. Yet, they dared to harbor improper ambitions? They were practically seeking death!

"However, everything was under our control. We were just waiting for them to rebel, then we would suppress them with thunderous might, to awe other forces. But the Haotian Sect Master fortunately knew his place. At the last moment, he abandoned his actions, voluntarily presented himself to apologize, and begged Emperor Qin for forgiveness."
