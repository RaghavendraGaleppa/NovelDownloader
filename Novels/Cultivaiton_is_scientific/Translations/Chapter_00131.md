# Chapter 131: Rescue  

"Die!" On Qingyi Island, Ren Fei'er found herself in serious trouble.  

Though she had life-saving measures, their effectiveness was greatly diminished in this situation.  

The entire area around Qingyi Island was densely packed with sea beasts—thousands upon thousands of them, including numerous high-tier first-grade beasts. Even if Ren Fei'er had the means to kill swathes of sea beasts instantly, she couldn't possibly clear them all from the surrounding waters.  

As long as the scent of Spirit Attracting Liquid lingered on the island, sea beasts would continue to arrive endlessly.  

Ren Fei'er was unlucky. Her plan would have worked under normal circumstances, but she had chosen a time when a medium-sized sea beast tide was occurring along the Tianhai Sea Line.  

Foundation Establishment cultivators and late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators could rely on formations to clear out second-grade sea beasts from the tide, but they were powerless against the overwhelming numbers of first-grade beasts.  

Normally, first-grade sea beasts wouldn’t be a major concern. Once the second-grade beasts were eliminated, the first-grade ones would stop within a thousand miles beyond the Tianhai Sea Line.  

That thousand-mile stretch of sea would become a hunting ground for Qi Refinement cultivators, serving both as combat training and a source of income.  

Under normal circumstances, the first-grade sea beasts that crossed the Tianhai Sea Line would quickly calm down without the presence of second-grade beasts.  

But Ren Fei'er had the misfortune of encountering this special moment. When she used the Spirit Attracting Liquid, it drew all the first-grade sea beasts toward her.  

A bottle flew from Ren Fei'er’s hand and landed on the ground, instantly poisoning a large number of sea beasts.  

However, such attacks were insignificant against the seemingly endless horde.  

She no longer dared to use her spiritual energy to control magical tools—her reserves were nearly depleted.  

Though the formation was holding up well, it was on the verge of collapse under the relentless assault of so many sea beasts.  

After all, it was a Qi Refinement-level formation powered by ordinary spirit stones, and the four stones were being consumed at an alarming rate.  

Even the sky was filled with flying spirit beasts circling above, occasionally swooping down to attack the formation.  

If the formation broke, Ren Fei'er would likely be torn apart by the sea beasts in an instant.  

"Should I use this?" Ren Fei'er hesitated, gripping a distress talisman in her hand.  

Activating it would alert all the cultivators from the Profound Nether Sect and the Tianhai Sect in the area.  

But she was reluctant. This talisman was special, and using it might lead to unpredictable consequences.  

If cultivators from both sects arrived, a fierce battle would be inevitable.  

Not every disciple knew about the high-level relationship between the two sects. Among the lower and middle ranks, they were still mortal enemies.  

This area was particularly chaotic—a hunting ground recognized by both sects. Here, cultivators didn’t just hunt sea beasts; they also hunted each other.  

Ren Fei'er clutched the talisman tightly. Around Qingyi Island, countless sea beast corpses littered the ground, but the living beasts paid no attention to their fallen kin. Instead, they surged mindlessly toward the island.  

The Spirit Attracting Liquid had driven them into a frenzy. Under normal circumstances, devouring their own kind would be one of the best ways for sea beasts to grow stronger.  

But the scent from the island had robbed them of reason. Their only thought was to absorb the intoxicating aroma.  

The Spirit Attracting Liquid Ren Fei'er had taken from her mother was no ordinary concoction—it wasn’t meant for common sea beasts.  

It had been crafted by a Golden Core cultivator, making it lethally irresistible to first-grade sea beasts.  

A group of six late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators lurked a dozen miles from Qingyi Island, using talismans to conceal their presence as they observed the chaos.  

"How many powerful spirit items has that cultivator used now?" one of them asked in a low voice.  

Clad entirely in black, they had no intention of revealing their identities. In these lawless waters, even fellow sect members could become targets if they weren’t personally acquainted.  

Such rogue teams were rare, usually composed of cultivators who would stop at nothing for resources.  

Ren Fei'er was unlucky enough to have crossed paths with one of them.  

"Twenty-six times!" another answered.  

Like seasoned hunters, they were waiting for their prey to exhaust itself.  

The sheer number of sea beasts on Qingyi Island made it too risky to approach, but Ren Fei'er’s endless supply of spirit items had caught their greedy attention.  

A cultivator with such wealth was a rare opportunity. Killing her could make them rich overnight, providing enough resources to change their fates—perhaps even allowing them to purchase Foundation Establishment Pills.  

"We can’t wait any longer," the team leader said decisively. "If she keeps using those items, there’ll be nothing left for us!"  

He winced at the thought of the treasures Ren Fei'er was wasting—powerful talismans, self-detonating artifacts, rare poisons, even puppets—each capable of slaying cultivators of the same level.  

Yet she was throwing them all at the endless sea beasts, dealing damage but achieving little.  

"Let’s do it. One big score, and we can buy Foundation Establishment Pills!" one cultivator clenched his fist.  

The others perked up at the mention of the pills. Foundation Establishment was their ultimate goal.  

Success would elevate their status, granting them the power and prestige of Foundation Establishment. None of them considered failure—they couldn’t afford to.  

"Brother, why haven’t you come yet? I can’t hold on much longer! …No, maybe it’s better if you don’t come—it’s too dangerous!" Ren Fei'er sensed her dwindling spiritual energy and regretted her recklessness.  

She wanted Li Shiming to save her, yet feared putting him in danger. The conflict brought tears to her eyes.  

Just then, a barrage of talismans flew from the side, landing amidst the sea beasts.  

Though low-grade, the talismans produced thick mist, disrupting the beasts’ vision.  

Already frenzied, the sea beasts grew even more chaotic in the sudden fog.  

"Did Brother arrive?" Ren Fei'er stood up eagerly, only to freeze when she saw six masked cultivators approaching.  

She had heard rumors of rogue teams in these waters—cultivators who hunted others for profit.  

Gritting her teeth, she pulled out a treasure talisman, ready to activate it with her remaining energy.  

Better to die by sea beasts than fall into their hands. But she didn’t want to die—after using the talisman, she would activate the distress signal.  

---  

Li Shiming’s jade flying boat raced at full speed. To go even faster, he channeled his own spiritual energy into the vessel.  

The boat’s scanning formation detected spiritual fluctuations in advance, making travel far more convenient than before, when he had to stay constantly vigilant.  

Perhaps due to the Holy Ice Sect’s intimidating reputation or the boat’s sheer speed, no one dared to interfere despite encountering multiple groups of cultivators along the way.  

Once within a thousand miles of the Tianhai Sea Line, Li Shiming pulled out a telescope—far more advanced than his earlier versions.  

Equipped with image-enhancing technology and powered by his latest "Dragon Heart II" chip, it allowed him to spot threats from a distance without slowing the flying boat.  

The Dragon Heart II chip, manufactured at 90 nanometers, represented the pinnacle of his current capabilities.  

Smaller nanometer processes existed, but the required technology was still beyond his reach for now.  

Standing on the deck, the telescope’s effectiveness was maximized over the open sea, allowing him to detect danger early and react without compromising speed.  

Long before reaching Qingyi Island, he sensed the turbulent spiritual energy and the overwhelming aura of violence.  

"It’s Qingyi Island!" Li Shiming’s heart clenched. Despite his earlier doubts, the sheer intensity confirmed Ren Fei'er was truly in danger.  

A moment later, a towering surge of energy erupted—a sword of spiritual light descended upon the island.  

Panicked, Li Shiming poured his energy into the flying boat, accelerating toward Qingyi Island.  

When he arrived, the sight of countless sea beasts greeted him. Ren Fei'er was nowhere to be seen.  

"Fei'er!" he shouted.  

Beside him, a three-headed, six-armed copper corpse materialized, each hand gripping a mid-grade Gatling-style magical tool.  

Without hesitation, the flying boat plunged into the sea beast horde.  

Six Gatling tools unleashed a storm of ice crystal bullets.  

Even the strongest first-grade sea beasts couldn’t withstand the onslaught. Like wheat before a scythe, they fell in droves—on land, in the sea, and in the air.  

Li Shiming stopped shouting—it was futile.  

Instead, he opened his mouth again, this time chanting "Buddha’s Light Emerges."  

Amplified by the "Demonic Sound Lotus," the chant couldn’t kill high-tier first-grade beasts but could disorient them.  

The flying boat reached the island’s center. His spiritual sense swept the area, locking onto a small figure encased in a protective barrier.  

Relief flooded him as the boat descended.  

The six Gatling tools, consuming sixty spirit stones every ten seconds, continued their relentless barrage.  

His spiritual sense also detected a horrified cultivator nearby, along with the mangled remains of five others—as if cleaved by some massive force.  

Li Shiming recalled the earlier sword light and noticed the treasure talisman in Ren Fei'er’s hand.  

"Damn it, they tried to hurt Fei'er!" Realization struck—Ren Fei'er had used the talisman to fend them off.  

One of the Gatling tools swiveled toward the surviving cultivator. His defenses shattered instantly under the hail of bullets, his body riddled with holes.  

Li Shiming reached Ren Fei'er’s side, but the protective barrier kept him at a distance.  

"Fei'er! Fei'er!" he called repeatedly over the Gatling tools’ roar, hoping she’d hear him.  

"Hmm?" Ren Fei'er stirred. She had underestimated her mother.  

After using the treasure talisman, a cultivator had launched a fatal attack at her—just as her formation collapsed.  

At the brink of death, a protective energy had enveloped her, effortlessly deflecting the lethal strike.  

It was her mother’s safeguard, activated in her direst moment.  

"Brother, are you dead too? If I can see you after death, I’m so happy!" Still dazed, she blinked at Li Shiming.  

He didn’t know whether to laugh or scold her.  

"You’re alive. But what kind of mess have you gotten yourself into?" he said exasperatedly.  

The scale of the chaos was beyond anything a Qi Refinement cultivator should handle.  

If not for his modified copper corpse and enhanced firepower, even his arrival might not have been enough to save her.  

"It really is you! I knew you’d come!" Fully awake now, Ren Fei'er sprang up and threw herself at him, overjoyed.  

As she moved, the protective barrier dissipated.  

Li Shiming stiffened. Though he and Yin Shilan had grown closer, their intimacy had never gone beyond holding hands.  

Ren Fei'er, though younger, was still a girl close to his age.  

"Get down. The fight isn’t over yet," he said awkwardly, not daring to move.  

Blushing, Ren Fei'er quickly stepped back, her eyes darting around.  

"The copper corpse is different now—three heads, six arms, no blind spots! And these tools are amazing! Brother, you’re so smart!" She marveled at the upgrades, admiration shining in her eyes.  

The treasure talisman’s activation had destroyed the lingering scent of Spirit Attracting Liquid.  

With the Gatling tools’ relentless assault, the sea beasts’ numbers dwindled rapidly. The tide was finally receding.
