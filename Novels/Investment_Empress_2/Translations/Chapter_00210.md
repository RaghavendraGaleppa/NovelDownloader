# Chapter 210: The Comic Book

“Who bullied you?”

Shang Wu saw Jiang Chulong, who was shedding little pearls of tears, and her willow-leaf eyebrows instantly shot up in anger.

“It was me... I cried by myself...”

Jiang Chulong pinched her clothes corner and mumbled.

“What kind of beast would bully such a pitiful little girl.”

Shang Wu’s sense of justice exploded. She put her hands on her hips and said, “Don’t be afraid, speak up. I’ll beat him to death for you.”

“Master.”

“Hmm?”

“Right there.”

Li Mo pointed to the name ranked first on the Hidden Dragon List displayed above the Dragon Gate.

Shang Wu: “......”

She leaned back slightly and curled her lip. “Hmph, in a one-on-one fight, I could beat him easily... but that would be a bit like bullying a child with an adult’s power. I’ll leave it to you, my disciple.”

“?”

Li Mo pointed at himself.

Are you serious?

“When the Hidden Dragon geniuses gather in the Imperial Capital, you can just challenge him.”

“As long as you win, it will be reasonable and justified for you to beat him up then.”

Shang Wu gave a thumbs up, meaning that she had high hopes for her precious disciple.

“顺便把我的那份也打了 (顺便把我的那份也打了).”

“.....What if I can’t win?” Li Mo’s mouth twitched.

“If you can’t win, then... *gag*~”

Shang Wu grabbed her own neck with her hand, rolled her eyes, and stuck out her tongue.

Jiang Chulong: “!”

Little Princess Jiang had almost stopped crying, but the moment she imagined Li Mo being beaten into the grotesque shape Shang Wu was making, she was frightened into shedding tears again.

“.....”

Li Mo rubbed Jiang Chulong’s head. Thinking for a moment, he suddenly got an idea.

He walked over to Ouyang and whispered in his ear.

Ouyang’s eyes suddenly lit up: “Li Shidi, you are truly a genius among geniuses!”

Then the two of them took out paper and started drawing.

Not long after.

“Here.”

“This... this is...”

A picture book was suddenly handed before Jiang Chulong.

There was no cover, but the corners were bound together so it wouldn’t fall apart.

The first thing she saw was a drawing.

It depicted a cute little girl carrying a small basket and holding a peach blossom branch. The brushstrokes were quite simple, but due to the exquisite craftsmanship, the little girl had a soft and萌 (cute) style.

“It’s... me...”

Jiang Chulong wiped away the tears blurring her eyes, and finally, the storm ceased.

“Flip through it,” Li Mo smiled.

So, the little Princess Jiang placed the book on her lap and gently flipped through the pages. One picture after another showed her searching through the streets, picking up trash everywhere.

Jiang Chulong’s eyes beneath the cloth bandages gradually began to shine.

The drawings are so good...

“Use your fingers to hold down the corners, here, like this.”

“Then you can make the picture book move.”

Li Mo taught her hand-by-hand how to read a comic book.

“So it can... be like this...”

Jiang Chulong imitated the action.

Sure enough, the characters in the book started to move!

In the comic, she found a Q-version wooden carving of Li Mo, took it home, and buried it in the soil.

Then spring turned to autumn.

The next year, a living Big Brother Li actually grew out!

In the comic, the somewhat silly-looking Big Brother Li hugged her and started spinning around.

The end, confetti!

Jiang Chulong laughed through her tears, then said quietly:

“It was明明 (clearly)... Big Brother Li... who picked me up...”

“Let’s go cook dinner.”

“Okay!”

...

The small courtyard originally rented by the group was about to expire, but plans couldn’t keep up with changes. When renting the yard, no one expected that Senior Sister Ying Bing would become the Hero of the Horizontal Cloud Sword and need to lecture at the Sword Pool.

Li Mo also didn’t expect that he would need to go copy the strange stones every day.

So, the group simply settled down in a tavern.

The afterglow covered the Fish Dragon Lake. From the Dragon Gate, the setting sun was slowly sinking inside.

Ying Bing was waiting on the rooftop for the moon to descend.

“Hidden Dragon Number One.”

Watching the name Jiang Yu in the Dragon Gate gradually dim.

Ying Bing couldn't help but recall.

After this Great Yu Crown Prince was defeated by her in three swords, not long after, Emperor Jingtai abdicated and became the Grand Emperor, Jiang Yu succeeded the throne, and then his temperament changed drastically.

---

Some said Jiang Yu was originally a violent nature, just good at enduring before.

Others said it was because his cultivation went wrong.

Opinions varied, but总之 (in short), since his ascension, the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths have become increasingly chaotic, and the Great Yu Dynasty has even reached the brink of collapse several times.

The inside story, even she didn't know.

She calmed her mind and cast aside distractions.

Ying Bing was just about to start today's Observation of the Spirit.

【Ding Dong!】

【Time until the next ranking comparison: 4 days countdown.】

The System reminded her on time every day...

And then it would remind her of the penalty content again.

It was quite nagging, as if afraid she would forget.

“This time, the Hidden Dragon List was personally reviewed by Tian Miao.”

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and pondered.

With a magical existence like the System that can grant rewards, one should still strive for it.

This time, she had some understanding of Li Mo’s Yi Soul and the Divine Intent he observed.

There is the True Phoenix Feather to counter his Divine Weapon.

As for the Divine Art...

The move named ‘Flying Immortal from the Heavens’ can be executed at the minimum Observation of the Spirit realm.

This is something he cannot do yet.

Rational analysis.

This time’s result should not be unexpected.

Thoughts flowed through her mind, and Ying Bing began to contemplate the moon.

...

In a private courtyard of the tavern.

The entire courtyard was filled with the fragrance of pills, but it was restricted by Xue Jing’s field and did not escape.

In the Longhu Cauldron, fire snakes spewed and entwined, the source of the fragrance.

“Elder Xue really brings his cauldron wherever he goes.”

Li Mo paused on his Dual Cultivation today.

《The Human Path Killing Hammer that Flips Heaven and Earth》is the first Divine Art he has mastered.

However, even though he had mastered it to the realm of perfection, he still couldn't execute the first move, ‘Heaven Flip’.

He was missing four Xuan Pills.

So, Little Li thought of the genius in cooking... or rather, in Pill Refining, who was comparable to him—Elder Xue.

Not far away.

The pill refinement had reached the stage of reducing the fire.

“Master, the pill is done!”

The cauldron extinguished, and Tang Xiaobao jumped out, holding a five-patterned pill in his small hand.

“It’s not that my pill refinement skills have improved.”

Xue Jing took the pill, stroked his beard, and sighed:

“Alas, I am still a step away from becoming a Grandmaster of the Pill Dao.”

“....But you’re still a Master of the Pill Dao,” Tang Xiaobao looked up and put the pill into a bottle.

Li Mo shook his head and said seriously to Senior Brother Xiaobao:

“No, it’s different. This is called the Great Perfection of the Peak of the Pill Dao Master, half a step into the Pill Dao Grandmaster.”

“Too complicated...”

Tang Xiaobao blinked, barely understanding. “So, you look down on Pill Masters, but can’t reach Grandmaster, so you’re stuck there?”

Li Mo: “......”

It seemed that the one missing meridian in Senior Brother Xiaobao was indeed very important.

After a long silence, Xue Jing looked up to the sky and sighed:

“The old man will do his best to make Xiaobao’s nine orifices complete.”

“Master is so good to me.”

The scene of the master and disciple being loving and filial was quite touching.

Xue Jing felt that his grand-disciple looked much more pleasing to the eye, and he increasingly felt that he had been muddle-headed back then.

“Little Mo, you are now a Hidden Dragon genius. You shouldn't be here just to ask me to refine pills.”

He had personally seen this grand-disciple eating pills with six or seven patterns like rice.

“Elder Xue has sharp eyes.”

Li Mo nodded.

“Then are you here to learn pill refinement from me?”

Xue Jing looked pleased, his smile kind.

Little Mo had finally come around.

Indeed, Li Mo did not deny it.

He said seriously:

“Yes, I want to discuss the External Pill method with you.”

“?”

Unpleasant memories surged up, and Xue Jing’s smile vanished.

He never expected.

His grand-disciple had come around, but it seemed he hadn't come around to the right path.

You are already at the Observation of the Spirit realm, what are you thinking about the External Pill method for?!
