# Chapter 359: Whose Child Will It Be?

“Black Soil Immortal, please go first. Eh? There’s a stone ahead. Let me kick it away for you. What kind of thing dares to block our Immortal’s path?”

“The Celestial Master does not accept disciples. Does the Immortal himself not accept them either?”

“No disciples? Then, do you accept mounts?”

In the afternoon, our Immortal Black Soil, Li Mo, was escorted out by a group of Demon Summoning Sect disciples led by Luo Yexian. They bowed and scraped so much that one would think they were treating their own biological fathers with such care.

They were desperate to advance.

“The Southern Border is a wonderful place, the birthplace of the Great Shang Dynasty...”

Li Mo walked at a leisurely pace, speaking as if he didn’t have a care in the world.

“It is their blessing to be able to receive the teachings of the Celestial Master there!”

Luo Yexian declared firmly, his eyes as determined as if he were joining the Party.

Do you know what they saw when they passed by a huge courtyard just after leaving the Immortal Sect?

Piles of heavenly treasures as high as mountains!

Rare and precious items as numerous as cow hair!

And a mountain that looked like a rockery but was actually connected to a mountain range... made of pure gold!

At that moment, they thought they had entered the secret treasury of the Vast Immortal Sect, but it felt wrong. Whose secret treasury would have its doors wide open, with gold and treasures scattered about like garbage...

Do you know what our Immortal Black Soil said?

“This is the Immortal Sect’s storage room for miscellaneous items.”

Storage room... room... room...

Even now, they cannot forget how nonchalant and how indifferent to money Immortal Black Soil was when he said those words.

So, what does the real secret treasury look like?

At that moment, Luo Yexian’s last trace of doubt was shattered and torn apart by the sheer, inhuman extravagance.

They now only feared that the Vast Immortal Sect would look down on them, the Demon Summoning Sect, as a “poor relative.”

*Whoosh—*

A piercing cold wind blew, and everyone froze.

Li Mo looked up and saw a solitary figure on the peach blossom stream, her expression somewhat dazed.

Although the Ice Cube was expressionless, her lips were slightly pursed, and her tightly furrowed brows had relaxed.

To outsiders, she looked cold and aloof.

But when Li Mo looked at her, she seemed a little... silly?

Well, it wasn’t surprising that the Ice Cube was stunned.

He himself didn’t expect such a good result. Not only did he keep the original Power of Faith, but even these demon sect members had started to believe in the Celestial Master, contributing Power of Faith to him. These people were martial artists of quite high境界, each one stronger than six ordinary men...

“Senior Sister, you have returned.”

Li Mo went all out with the act, stepping forward to stand beside Ying Bing.

The more he spoke, the more mistakes he could make. The effect he wanted to achieve today had already been reached.

So, Li Mo looked at the Demon Summoning Sect members with a smile.

“I have an appointment with Senior Sister to go sightseeing, so I cannot see you off.”

“Regarding the matter of exchanging resources I mentioned earlier, you can discuss it with your superiors after returning to the sect.”

Luo Yexian looked at the two’s “training uniforms” and gave an ambiguous smile.

This Immortal Black Soil was a妙人 (an interesting person).

And the other party clearly knew that he couldn’t make the decision himself; this was a hint for him to go back and pass on the message.

“Then we will take our leave first.”

“Take care.”

...

Luo Yexian left with surging emotions and a face full of red light. He felt he had made a great contribution to the sect.

“Hall Master, but we didn’t recover so much of our Power of Faith. Will the圣子 (Holy Son) be unhappy?”

The buck-toothed priest who had been guarding outside asked.

“Unhappy? Hah... what is a little Power of Faith? That’s called ‘human resources’ (renqing). Do you understand what renqing is?”

Luo Yexian looked at him like he was a frog in a well, the corner of his mouth curling up.

---

“Immortal Black Soil asking us for ‘renqing’ is giving us a chance to advance. It’s testing our attitude.”

“It’s like deliberately losing money to your boss in a game of mahjong. You just don’t get it.”

The buck-toothed priest’s CPU was overheating.

But if you have a Pure Straight Flush or Seven Pairs, who could resist calling “Hu”?

They walked a bit further and found a secluded place to communicate with the Demon Summoning Holy Son.

After the connection was established, Luo Yexian, his face full of mystery, said the first thing:

“Holy Son, our sect’s greatest opportunity is about to arrive!”

“Do you want to advance?”

“?”

...

Under the blue sky, above the white clouds.

The Somersault Cloud frolicked along with the wind of home, perhaps because the young man riding it was in an excellent mood.

Li Mo, in his white robes that fluttered in the wind, touched the scorching Colorless Pagoda of Emptiness in his hand, looking at the Power of Faith he had painstakingly accumulated bit by bit, and happily put it away.

The speed of collecting Power of Faith hadn’t decreased; in fact, it had become faster.

Well, he hadn’t even dealt with the “Golden Crow Senior Brother” yet. Even if he accumulated enough Power of Faith to manifest his divine form, he still wouldn’t be able to win...

“Black Soil Junior Brother?”

Ying Bing held the big-headed doll. Seeing the curve of Li Mo’s lips, she couldn’t help but tilt her head slightly.

“...Actually, my father originally named me Li Heitu (Black Soil), because a fortune teller said I was lacking the Earth element in my Five Elements.”

Li Mo felt a bit awkward under her gaze.

Ying Bing’s lips twitched slightly. After a moment of silence, she asked again:

“And then?”

“Then my mother said the name was too ‘earthy’, so she combined the characters and took the character ‘Mo’ (ink).”

Ying Bing’s serene face softened a few degrees, as if she could picture the scene at the time.

In her past life, there weren’t many people she remembered. Aside from those powerful figures hanging high in the sky, there were even fewer ordinary people. Only Li Mo’s parents left a deep impression on her.

If Uncle and Auntie have grandchildren in the future, they absolutely must not let Great Dragon Uncle name them...

Thinking of this, Ying Bing suddenly froze.

Grandchildren?

Whose child will it be for Uncle and Auntie’s grandchildren?

*Creak—*

The big-headed doll’s head was squeezed until it made a sound.

“Ice Cube, your neck is really red.”

Li Mo noticed the blush on her neck and asked seriously, while extending the back of his hand to touch her cheek.

But just as he touched the soft, jade-like skin, Ying Bing turned her body to the side.

“It’s nothing.”

“Your face is clearly very hot too...”

Little Li Genius was completely bewildered.

The wind blew, causing her black hair to fly. The cold wind of early winter brushed against her face, and the Ice Cube finally cooled down.

But just as her mind settled, a new wave rose before the old one had evened out.

A notification sounded in her ear:

【Congratulations, Host. While successfully seizing the top spot on the genius rankings, you still completed the punishment, which shows you are very satisfied with the content of the punishment.】

【This proves that this system’s upgrade direction is very correct.】

“...”

Ying Bing’s eyes trembled slightly upon hearing the system’s voice.

“I haven’t opened the rankings yet. Why did you come out?”

【Although the rankings have not been opened yet, you can draw a prize early... to draw a punishment!】

“?”
