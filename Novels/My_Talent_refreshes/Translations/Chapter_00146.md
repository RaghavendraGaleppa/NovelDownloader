# Chapter 146: Thousand Islands Competition, Chu Ning Joins the Fray

“Eighteen?” Chu Ning’s mouth dropped slightly when he heard this. “Could it be that this Fairy Cen started cultivating from her mother’s womb?”

He was twenty this year, and reaching Qi Condensation Completion already felt incredibly fast to him. With the Wood Spirit Body, his cultivation of the Evergreen Wood Cultivation Art was extremely swift. Moreover, after refreshing his Source Talisman Spirit Body, he had acquired a vast amount of resources through talisman crafting. In the past few months, he had even quickly completed his cultivation from the eighth to ninth layers of Qi Condensation with the help of spiritual essence. Yet, this Fairy Cen was already a Foundation Establishment cultivator at merely eighteen years old. It truly astounded Chu Ning.

The crucial point was that she was also hailed as the number one Formation Master in the Thousand Lakes and Islands, and among alchemy, talismans, artifacts, and formations, formations were the most difficult. Even when he was in Qingxi Sect before, he had never heard of such a genius.

“Isn’t it unbelievable?” Jiang Lan’s face showed a hint of pride. “Among the Thousand Lakes and Islands, no male cultivator can compare to her. It’s said that she possesses a Heavenly Spiritual Root, and a Golden Core cultivator from a major sect wanted to take her as a true disciple. However, Fairy Cen said she wanted to remain in the Thousand Lakes and Islands. Still, that Golden Core cultivator accepted her as a disciple and imparted supreme Dao arts to her.” Perhaps it was because Fairy Cen brought glory to female cultivators, for Jiang Lan’s tone was filled with pride as she spoke. Chu Ning merely smiled faintly and didn’t ask further.

The clamor from outside gradually quieted down after the Foundation Establishment cultivator spoke.

“Fellow Island Masters, Fellow Daoists, I am Cen Wenquan, head of the Cen Family, and also the rotating Alliance Leader of the Thousand Islands Alliance. It is with great pleasure that we welcome the five-yearly Thousand Islands Competition once again. To promote Daoist exchanges between the islands and enhance the overall cultivation strength of the Thousand Lakes and Islands, we have held the Thousand Islands Competition for decades, and its effects have been excellent. Everyone is familiar with the rules, so I won’t elaborate. Upon successful challenge, island jurisdictions can be exchanged. Those who fail the challenge are responsible for submitting three years’ worth of harvest from the other island. Now, please propose the islands you wish to challenge, and we will organize the matches directly.”

Cen Wenquan got straight to the point. The previously quiet Dao arena stirred again after his words fell.

“Each island must have a minimum of three participants and a maximum of ten. Neither party in a match shall cause death or severe injury…” Cen Wenquan continued to explain the competition rules. At this moment, many sound transmission talismans flew out from the various island high platforms.

On the high platform, the younger generation, including Fairy Cen, collected these talismans. What caught Chu Ning’s attention was that several sound transmission talismans also flew up from the crowd below.

“Are these the cultivators who teamed up, hoping to directly seize island jurisdiction?” Chu Ning recalled the rogue cultivator who had invited him to join a team before, and he roughly guessed the situation.

In just a moment, Cen Wenquan’s voice rang out again. “Now, I will first announce the challenging applications, and then organize the matches one by one.”

“Flower Crown Island challenges Purple Swallow Island.”

“Star Moon Island challenges Storm Island.”

…

Cen Wenquan read out thirty to forty challenge pairs consecutively. Chu Ning listened roughly, noting that there were some first-tier islands challenging second-tier islands, and also second-tier islands challenging higher-ranked second-tier islands. However, challenges between first-tier islands seemed relatively fewer. It appeared that cultivators on first-tier islands, perhaps because the first-tier spirit veins didn’t differ much, were relatively more stable and conservative.

At this moment, Chu Ning paid attention to Jiang Hongguang’s expression beside him. He noticed that Jiang Hongguang’s initially worried expression eased considerably after hearing Cen Wenquan read so many names without mentioning Flying Rainbow Island.

But at this very moment.

“Quiet Spring Island challenges Flying Rainbow Island.”

“Stele Forest Island challenges Flying Rainbow Island.”

“Rogue Cultivator Si Guangliang’s team challenges Flying Rainbow Island.”

Cen Wenquan read three challenges in a row, all of them for Flying Rainbow Island. This instantly caused Jiang Hongguang’s face to change dramatically, and even Cen Wenquan’s voice seemed to carry a hint of confusion. The many cultivators in the plaza below were also in an uproar.

“Why are there so many challenging Flying Rainbow Island?”

“Isn’t Flying Rainbow Island a first-tier spirit vein island? Why are so many people suddenly challenging it? Could there be something good there?”

…

Cen Wenquan continued reading, and everyone’s attention quickly shifted. Chu Ning looked at Jiang Hongguang and asked, “Fellow Daoist Jiang, why are so many people suddenly challenging us? Has some news leaked?”

Jiang Hongguang’s expression changed several times before he sighed bitterly. “It seems so. When we first discovered that spirit vein, there was indeed a low-level cultivator and a spirit farmer from the island present. I repeatedly instructed them to keep it a strict secret, but now it seems the news has finally leaked out.”

Chu Ning sighed inwardly upon hearing this. He had hoped to securely settle down in a cultivation dwelling, but he didn’t expect such a thing to happen.

So, he asked the other party again, “What is the strength of these islands?”

Jiang Hongguang let out a bitter laugh, then said with a very serious expression, “Quiet Spring Island and Stele Forest Island are both among the strongest first-tier spirit vein islands. Both islands had cultivators at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation several years ago; it’s possible they’ve already broken through to Qi Condensation Completion by now.” Having said this, Jiang Hongguang sighed deeply.

Beside him, Jiang Lan anxiously asked, “Brother, what should we do?”

“Let’s see. If it comes down to it, we might just have to concede,” Jiang Hongguang said, shaking his head helplessly.

Yu Yuanxiu, who was nearby, patted his shoulder and comforted him, “Husband, don’t worry too much. We’ve always cultivated on a first-tier spirit vein island anyway. Even if we concede, it just means cultivating on a different island.”

Jiang Lan looked dejected. “How could this happen? If we had known the news would spread, we should have recruited a more powerful helper. Now that the rosters for each island have been submitted, they can’t be changed.”

Hearing Jiang Lan’s seemingly casual yet subtly pointed remarks, Chu Ning didn’t take them to heart. He simply said calmly, “Why are the three of you rushing to concede now? Why not wait and see?”

The three looked at Chu Ning, their gazes somewhat puzzled.

Chu Ning was genuinely afraid that Island Master Jiang, in his disappointment, would choose to concede directly, leaving his own cultivation place unsettled. So, at this moment, he said, “Fellow Daoist Jiang, if there are opponents above the ninth layer of Qi Condensation, leave them to me.”

“…”

Hearing Chu Ning’s words, Jiang Hongguang and the other two looked at him, slightly stunned, their eyes filled with disbelief.

After a short while, just as Jiang Lan was about to say something, Jiang Hongguang immediately stopped her, then seriously asked Chu Ning, “Are Fellow Daoist Chu’s words true?”

Chu Ning nodded and said, “If there’s a ninth-layer Qi Condensation opponent, just send me into the arena directly. If I lose, Fellow Daoist won’t suffer any losses, right?”

Hearing Chu Ning’s words, Jiang Hongguang made up his mind. “Alright, I’ll take your word for it. If we can truly defend Flying Rainbow Island, I will certainly not let Fellow Daoist Chu suffer any disadvantage.”

Chu Ning smiled without replying, acknowledging Jiang Hongguang’s promise.

While they were conversing, Cen Wenquan had already finished reading out the entire challenge roster. This time, there were a full fifty-two challenging pairs.

Cen Wenquan had now begun to announce the list of matches. The first ones were merely duels between two first-tier islands. Both sides sent out four late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, though the highest level among them was only at the eighth layer of Qi Condensation, same as Jiang Hongguang. There were also two cultivators at the seventh layer of Qi Condensation.

Their exchanges naturally weren’t particularly exciting. Although they used some talismans and magic tools, their grades weren’t very high. The best were only two mid-grade magic tools; no high-grade magic tools appeared. In the end, the island that initiated the challenge won the match.

After announcing the result, Cen Wenquan immediately organized the next round of matches. The island matches came one after another. Chu Ning now had a general understanding of the cultivation level of the Thousand Lakes and Islands cultivators. In terms of combat experience, these cultivators were superior to the disciples of Qingxi Sect from back then. However, in terms of the power of their spells and magic tools, they were somewhat inferior. This was normal, as cultivators who were relatively closer to rogue cultivators could not compare with those from sects, even if Qingxi Sect was not a particularly large sect.

During this half-day, the most explosive atmosphere in the arena came from the match between two second-tier islands. Among the two sides, the challenging party only sent out six cultivators, while the defending party sent out eight cultivators in succession. This was within the rules; having more high-level cultivators also represented a form of strength. However, in the same match, a defeated cultivator could no longer remain on the field, while a victorious cultivator could. The result was that an early Foundation Establishment cultivator from the challenging party single-handedly defeated two early Foundation Establishment cultivators from the opposing side, and still had enough power to defeat a Qi Condensation Completion cultivator. This move helped their island secure the victory, and the challenge was successful.

With this match, the subsequent challenging matches, while still somewhat exciting, naturally didn’t have the same fervor as before.

“Next match, rogue cultivator Si Guangliang’s team challenges Flying Rainbow Island.” Cen Wenquan’s voice rang out. Immediately, two individuals stepped onto the competition platform in the center of the Dao arena. This was because Flying Rainbow Island had previously reported four cultivators for defense, so according to the rules, since the opposing team did not have an island, only two people were allowed to participate in the challenge.

“Fellow Daoist Chu, these two are both eighth-layer Qi Condensation cultivators. We’ll go forward and deal with them first.” Jiang Hongguang stood up and said. As an Island Master, he naturally had a bit of pride. There was no fear in challenging a team of two rogue cultivators.

Upon hearing this, Jiang Lan, who was eager to try, immediately flew out, soared from the high platform, and glided onto the competition arena. Subsequently, the opponent sent out a middle-aged eighth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator.

Although Jiang Lan seemed a bit reckless, she did have some strength. What surprised Chu Ning slightly was that she also cultivated Golden-attribute cultivation arts and spells, known for their offense. Furthermore, observing her combat, her comprehension of spells seemed quite good. However, there was still a one-level difference between the two. While Jiang Lan held a mid-grade magic tool, her opponent also held one, a defensive Earth-attribute magic tool. After failing to defeat her opponent several times with spells, Jiang Lan became a little impatient and even abandoned her defense, attempting to fully activate her magic tool to attack. As a result, she was directly defeated by the middle-aged cultivator.

However, Jiang Lan did manage to consume a certain amount of the opponent’s energy, so Yu Yuanxiu easily defeated him afterward. When it was the next cultivator’s turn, Jiang Hongguang did not let Yu Yuanxiu stay in the arena but personally stepped forward. Jiang Hongguang also cultivated Golden-attribute cultivation arts and spells, and his mastery was deeper than Jiang Lan’s. Although the opponent, a cultivator named Si Guangliang, had decent Water-attribute spells, after a fierce exchange, Jiang Hongguang defeated him.

Thus, Flying Rainbow Island successfully defended the first challenge. However, this match also allowed everyone to clearly see Jiang Hongguang’s strength. As Jiang Hongguang returned to Flying Rainbow Island’s high platform, the observing cultivators below began to discuss animatedly.

“Flying Rainbow Island’s strength is perhaps too ordinary. When it comes to the matches against Quiet Spring Island and Stele Forest Island, they’ll have almost no chance of winning.”

“Not just no chance of winning, I estimate they’ll just concede directly.”

“It’s also strange, Quiet Spring Island and Stele Forest Island’s spirit veins are supposedly better than Flying Rainbow Island’s, so why would they choose to challenge Flying Rainbow Island?”

“What’s the rush? There’s no impenetrable wall in this world. The news will naturally come out tomorrow.”

…

Such discussions naturally reached Jiang Hongguang and the others. For a moment, on Flying Rainbow Island’s high platform, everyone’s expressions, except for Chu Ning’s, were unsightly. Despite the lingering suspicion in Jiang Hongguang’s heart, he repeatedly turned to look at Chu Ning’s expression. Seeing the latter’s calm demeanor, he held onto a glimmer of hope.

According to the competition rules, if an island received multiple challenges, only one match would be arranged per day.

Flying Rainbow Island had accepted Si Guangliang’s team challenge today, so the challenges from the other two islands would be scheduled later. Chu Ning and the others continued to observe the matches for half the day until dusk fell, at which point everyone dispersed. That day, eighteen challenge matches were completed. If they continued at this pace, all matches would be completed in just three days.

The next morning, Chu Ning arrived punctually at the Dao arena again. Below, many curious cultivators had already arrived. Seeing Chu Ning fly on the wind to Flying Rainbow Island’s high platform, a fresh wave of discussions immediately broke out.

“Did you hear? It’s said that Flying Rainbow Island discovered a second-tier hidden spirit vein!”

“Really? A second-tier spirit vein? No wonder Quiet Spring Island and Stele Forest Island want to challenge them!”

As these discussions broke out, a plump cultivator in gray robes immediately spoke, “If news is spreading, it must be true. Flying Rainbow Island used to be governed by the Jiang family, I know them. This young cultivator just now must be a new helper. If it were just a first-tier spirit vein, or the small first-tier spirit vein it used to be, there wouldn’t be a need to hire a helper.” However, as soon as this plump cultivator spoke, it caused the surrounding people to chime in.

“What good is an eighth-layer Qi Condensation helper?”

“Quiet Spring Island and Stele Forest Island might even have Qi Condensation Completion cultivators. Flying Rainbow Island, ah, nine times out of ten, they’re going to concede.”

…

Waves of discussion filtered into the high platform’s barrier. Inside the barrier, Jiang Hongguang looked at Chu Ning, who remained calm. His lips moved, but he ultimately didn’t speak. As things stood, it seemed he had no choice but to fully trust Chu Ning’s move.

The Thousand Islands Alliance members appeared at this time. Without the formalities of yesterday, Cen Wenquan announced the names of the two competing parties, and today’s matches began directly. After three consecutive rounds of challenge matches, the challenging side won two matches, and the defending side won one. The overall win rate was about the same as yesterday. In truth, those who dared to issue challenges generally had some confidence, as failing a challenge meant being responsible for three years’ worth of harvest.

“Next match, Quiet Spring Island challenges Flying Rainbow Island. Please send out your cultivators.” Cen Wenquan’s voice rang out in the Dao arena. Immediately, everyone’s gazes turned towards Flying Rainbow Island.

By this time, the news of Flying Rainbow Island possessing a second-tier spirit vein had already spread like wildfire throughout the entire Dao arena. Many islands secretly regretted their lack of timely information, realizing they couldn’t participate in the scramble.

Everyone was also keenly watching whether Flying Rainbow Island would concede, and who would win the subsequent match between Quiet Spring Island and Stele Forest Island. This was because, according to the rules, if the defending party failed and there was another challenger, that challenger would then compete against the winner.

As Cen Wenquan’s words fell, six cultivators immediately stood up on Quiet Spring Island. Unlike the previous rogue cultivator teams, the participating personnel from each island had already been reported to the Thousand Islands Alliance. After the six cultivators made a brief appearance, one person immediately flew down from the high platform. It was a short cultivator, approximately forty-six or forty-seven years old, and his cultivation had already reached the ninth layer of Qi Condensation.

“Ye Guoxin of Quiet Spring Island, requests guidance from a fellow Daoist of Flying Rainbow Island.”

Inside Flying Rainbow Island’s high platform, Jiang Hongguang and the others immediately saw that the opponent had directly sent out a ninth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator. Their expressions naturally weren’t good. However, seeing Chu Ning voluntarily stand up, Jiang Hongguang finally forced a smile onto his face. “Fellow Daoist Chu, this Ye Guoxin has been at the ninth layer of Qi Condensation for a long time. Be careful.”

Chu Ning smiled and nodded, then directly flew from the high platform and landed on the competition arena.

“Eh, who is this?”

“Looks like a new helper Flying Rainbow Island recruited.”

“Quiet Spring Island sent out a ninth-layer Qi Condensation cultivator, and Island Master Jiang from Flying Rainbow Island isn’t even showing his face. Looks like they’ve really given up.”

…

Chu Ning’s appearance caused the already noisy Dao arena to erupt in even louder discussions. Everyone’s gazes fell upon Chu Ning, with some curious, some gleeful, and many filled with doubt. Chu Ning paid them little mind, simply cupping his hands towards his opponent.

“Chu Ning of Flying Rainbow Island, I request your guidance.”

With that, Chu Ning casually patted his storage pouch and took out a magic tool. When they saw the spiked club in Chu Ning’s hand, the entire arena erupted in an even greater uproar. Because what Chu Ning held in his hand was, shockingly, a low-grade magic tool.
