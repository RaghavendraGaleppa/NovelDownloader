# Chapter 17: Unexpected Boon

"If you're a young hero, you should have said so earlier. This old man was simply acting impulsively for a moment. Please accept my apologies, Young Master Han."

Mo Juren suddenly sighed, skillfully concealing the resentment in his heart. His imposing aura plummeted, and he suddenly began to cough violently, reverting to his sickly old man persona, looking like a hero past his prime.

"Actually, that brat Han Li is cultivating a very important cultivation art and cannot be disturbed by outsiders for the time being," Doctor Mo chose to tell a half-truth.

"No matter how miraculous the cultivation art, he still needs to eat, drink, and relieve himself, right? It can't be so restrictive that he can't even meet me once?" Han Zhen seized upon Mo Juren's predicament and began to press his advantage.

"Moreover, Han Li complained to me earlier that Elder Mo didn't teach him any martial arts, not even allowing him to learn from the instructors. He's a bit thin-skinned, so he came to me for help." Han Zhen eyed Mo Juren with suspicion, weighing the cloth bag in his hand, which clearly contained some books. "As his elder brother, I naturally couldn't refuse. I specifically selected many secret manuals from the Seven Absolutes Hall. Now Elder Mo says he's cultivating martial arts? Doesn't that contradict what I just said?"

*This kid is also from the countryside, how can he be so difficult? Han Li isn't even this perceptive, despite cultivating the Evergreen Art.* Mo Juren couldn't help but think, *If Han Li also becomes this clever later on, I'll need to be a bit wary.*

"Heh heh." Mo Juren gestured, inviting Han Zhen to sit down. "Although Young Hero Han is a young hero, he still lacks some experience in the pugilistic world. There's a reason this old man didn't let Han Li cultivate martial arts before." Mo Juren put on the air of an experienced old hand, as if he had found his former glory days of confidently guiding the martial world. "Han Li's bone structure and talent are quite ordinary, unlike you, his brother, who possesses exceptional qualities. For him to cultivate ordinary martial arts would just be a waste of time."

"When this old man accepted him as a disciple, I only valued his tenacious character during the entrance test. I merely hoped he could inherit my medical legacy, and that would be enough." Mo Juren's face was sallow, and his lies were utterly seamless. "However, later on, this old man also saw that brat Han Li's desire to become a martial arts master. That's why I set a six-month test for him. If he could pass the test, I would give him a chance."

"That brat Han Li didn't disappoint. Therefore, this old man spared no expense, spending a fortune to find a suitable martial arts manual for him." Mo Juren poured Han Zhen a cup of tea, trying to explain.

Han Zhen merely used the tea lid to lightly touch the rim of the cup. He absolutely dared not casually try anything that Doctor Mo had touched.

"Is that so?" Han Zhen asked. "To prevent this junior from meeting Han Li, Elder Mo still hasn't told the truth, has he?"

"What? Do you think this old man is still trying to deceive you?" Mo Juren's face showed annoyance.

"If it's truly as Elder Mo says, and Han Li is at a critical juncture, then as his elder brother, I naturally wouldn't forcefully ruin his opportunity." Mo Juren nodded, but unexpectedly, Han Zhen suddenly changed the subject. "However, it's not impossible for this junior to believe Elder Mo." Han Zhen looked at Mo Juren, appearing as if he wouldn't give up until he got a result. "This junior believes his talent is exceptional. You only need to let me take a look at the cultivation art you mentioned, and I'll know how credible Elder Mo's words are."

*A mere mortal junior dares to covet an immortal opportunity?!* Doctor Mo only found Han Zhen, this frog in a well, utterly laughable. *No matter how good your martial arts talent is, if you can't cultivate immortality, you just can't.* Even he himself was just a "mediocre person without a spiritual root" in the words of cultivators. Mo Juren deeply understood how attractive immortal cultivation was to mortals. Naturally, he wouldn't risk revealing even a shred of the cultivation art.

Mo Juren looked at the relentless Han Zhen, not daring to outright refuse him. He could only take some risks and allow them to meet. Mo Juren dared to do this because he had keenly caught some crucial information from Han Zhen's words: Han Li had never revealed to his brother what cultivation art he was practicing. *Kids from the countryside are easy to control. A slight threat and they'll obey.* *As for this arrogant fellow in front of me, he's just a mere mortal. What could he possibly discern? Once he falls into my hands in the future, no matter how strong his martial arts are, he'll be nothing but an ant before me, a cultivator.*

Just as Mo Juren was about to agree to Han Zhen meeting Han Li, a voice suddenly echoed in his mind. It was Yu Zhitong, who had been silent for some time.

"Give him the cultivation art!" Yu Zhitong's tone in Mo Juren's mind was somewhat surprised and urgent.

"What are you saying?!" Mo Juren was a little incredulous. Why would Yu Zhitong suddenly make such a decision?

"Do you know that spiritual roots are very likely to appear in people who inherit the same bloodline?" In the past, even ordinary True Spirit Root individuals were difficult for the major immortal cultivation sects to find, because people from immortal cultivation sects couldn't possibly seek out every child in the mortal world for testing. To prevent their inheritances from dying out, some thoughtful individuals diligently researched and finally discovered that spiritual roots tend to appear in people with the same bloodline. "You promised me before that after a successful body snatch, you would find a suitable body for me. From what I observe, this person right in front of us is very likely to possess a spiritual root!"

"Moreover, you and I have already sworn a death oath. In the cultivation world, oaths are binding. So, if this person also has a spiritual root, wouldn't it be wonderful if we could become sworn brothers in the future and roam the cultivation world together?!"

In truth, Yu Zhitong saw that Han Li's cultivation was slow, so his spiritual root was probably not much better than Yu Zhitong's own in his lifetime. But spiritual roots were hard to find, and Doctor Mo's body was quickly deteriorating. Yu Zhitong could only grudgingly accept it. But then, things suddenly took a turn! Han Zhen appearing before Mo Juren was simply a godsend. Not only did he possess once-in-a-century martial arts talent, but he was also Han Li's blood relative. For a naturally intelligent youth with exceptional bone structure, being a blood relative of Han Li significantly increased the probability of him possessing a spiritual root.

Another point Yu Zhitong valued was that compared to the dark and skinny Han Li, his brother was considerably more dashing and refined. One must know that good looks also offer an advantage in the cultivation world. Yu Zhitong believed that if Han Zhen could also cultivate the Evergreen Art, Doctor Mo would definitely choose Han Zhen for body snatching. He had seen Mo Juren's original appearance; his original face made even Yu Zhitong, a cultivator, envious. *Unfortunately, no matter what he chooses, he's just making a wedding dress for me.*

Han Zhen was unaware of the conversation within Doctor Mo's mind. The exchange between Yu Zhitong and Doctor Mo's spiritual consciousness occurred in an instant.

"I agree, but I can only give you the first... six layers of the cultivation art!" Doctor Mo had originally only intended to give the first three layers, to avoid any unexpected situations with Han Li. But Yu Zhitong strongly insisted, because if Han Zhen could truly cultivate the Evergreen Art, he would inevitably become addicted to the cultivation process. Ordinary people might not feel it clearly, but a martial arts master like Han Zhen could perceive even subtle changes in his body. The benefits of successful Evergreen Art cultivation to the body would only make Han Zhen unable to stop, pushing him to cultivate until he reached the sixth layer of perfection. Unaware of the truth, he would naturally come knocking when the time came. And with his seventh-layer cultivation, combined with a formation, he could perfectly suppress the target during body snatching. This way, he would soon return to his peak.

Of course, if Han Zhen had no spiritual root and couldn't cultivate, there would be no loss either. How to deal with him then would be Mo Juren's own problem.

Hearing that Mo Juren actually agreed to his request, Han Zhen was first stunned for a moment, then inwardly ecstatic. However, his face still showed disbelief, exhibiting a cautious suspicion towards Mo Juren, the old fox, in an unconventional manner. *He wouldn't tamper with the cultivation art, would he?*
