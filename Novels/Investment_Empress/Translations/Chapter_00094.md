Chapter 94: The Mastermind, Infiltrating the Fine Rain Pavilion

"The letter is from the Fine Rain Pavilion," Zuo Qiu Yang said, his eyes fixed on the swallow emblem at the bottom left corner of the letter. He stood up abruptly, his body radiating a murderous aura.

"Ah?" Shang Wu raised an eyebrow, scanning the letter with a curious gaze.

Zuo Qiu Yang's face twisted in a snarl, and he crouched down, his head in his hands.

"Master, he seems to know something about the Fine Rain Pavilion," Li Mo said, explaining the situation to his master.

"Understanding the Fine Rain Pavilion's intentions and movements will be beneficial to our mission," Li Mo continued, beckoning Zuo Qiu Yang to come over and read the letter with him.

The letter was written in a cryptic script, resembling hieroglyphs, which required specialized knowledge to decipher.

Zuo Qiu Yang took the letter and began to read: "Have you three been keeping up with your training?" The letter continued, "The current situation is tumultuous, and you are still stuck in Huai Mountain Town, engaging in brigandage. When will you finally make a name for yourselves? With the Unbounded Trial about to commence, why not seize this opportunity to join the Fine Rain Pavilion and secure a backing?"

As Zuo Qiu Yang read on, his voice trembled, and his emotions became agitated. He was certain that the sender of the letter was the one who had killed his master.

The letter revealed that the sender, known as Xiao Mi Tuo, had already made significant progress in the realm of Observing the Gods and had secured a position within the Fine Rain Pavilion.

Zuo Qiu Yang's anger was palpable as he continued reading: "Recently, I received news that the disciple of the traitor we killed years ago has also learned the skills of our pavilion. It is only fitting that we eliminate him. You must kill him and meet me at the old location."

The letter concluded with an offer: if they succeeded, Xiao Mi Tuo would speak well of them to the head of the new branch pavilion, ensuring a good position for them.

The group fell into contemplative silence as they digested the information.

"The Fine Rain Pavilion is going to establish a branch in Zi Yang Mansion?" Shang Wu's eyebrows furrowed. "They think they can just expand their influence here?"

"This concerns the foundation of our sect," Li Mo said. "No sect would tolerate a killer organization establishing a foothold in their territory."

However, the Fine Rain Pavilion was notorious for its elusive nature and extensive network of informants. Even the Great Yu Dynasty and several major sects had failed to eradicate it completely.

Zuo Qiu Yang suggested that they pretend to be the Huai Mountain Three Evils and infiltrate the Fine Rain Pavilion. However, Li Mo pointed out that their plan would be foiled if they encountered Xiao Mi Tuo, who was familiar with the Huai Mountain Three Evils.

"Unless... we kill Xiao Mi Tuo," Zuo Qiu Yang's eyes lit up with a vengeful glow. "Then no one would know that we're impostors."

Li Mo agreed to the plan, and they began to discuss the next step: finding Xiao Mi Tuo.

"We can wait for him to come to us," Li Mo said. "If we perform well in the Unbounded Trial, he might make contact."

The group started making preparations, deciding to reopen the abandoned inn and use it as a hub to gather information.

As they cleaned up the scene, Li Mo used his internal energy to incinerate the corpses, leaving behind only ashes. Ying Bing used her skills to gather the ashes and dispose of them in the garden.

Zuo Qiu Yang was impressed by the group's skills, particularly their proficiency in destroying evidence.

Meanwhile, in the center of Zi Yang Mansion, various sects were gathering at the government office, enjoying a grand feast.

"Where are the disciples from Qing Yuan Sect?" someone asked.

"I heard that Shang Wu is leading the team. I'm not sure how reliable they are," another person replied.

The host, Zi Yang Mansion's master, raised his glass in a toast. "I hope the various sects will maintain peace in Zi Yang Mansion."

The guests responded with polite smiles and words of assurance.
