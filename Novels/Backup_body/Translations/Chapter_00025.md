# Chapter 25: The Story of the Black Robe, The Curse of the Token  

**Boom!**  

The courtyard gate was suddenly smashed open!  

First, a burly white wolf charged in!  

Then a majestic black eagle swooped down from the sky!  

At the same time, an urgent voice rang out:  

"Junior Brother Li!"  

He Qingyu rushed into the courtyard with her sword drawn, only to freeze in shock at the sight before her.  

Li Zhengjing glanced at her, then noticed two leisurely figures approaching from outside the courtyard.  

Chen Bing and Zhou Mo had finally arrived, their faces filled with smug and mocking smiles.  

But the moment they stepped into the courtyard, their smiles stiffened.  

Li Zhengjing's grin, however, only widened.  

"Sixty merit points—all mine. Thanks for the concession!"  

After saying this, he looked at Chen Bing and Zhou Mo and couldn't help but ask curiously, "How does it feel to be this mad?"  

The two of them snorted in anger, turned, and left.  

After walking a short distance, Chen Bing gripped his sword hilt, grinding his teeth.  

"I'm so furious! I'm going back to kill him!"  

"Killing a fellow disciple in public is a grave crime!" Zhou Mo stopped him, and the two stormed off indignantly.  

Silence returned to the courtyard. The heretic cultivator had been defeated by Li Zhengjing, but he had deliberately avoided fatal strikes, leaving the man barely alive.  

Soon after, Lu Xiaoxuan returned to report to the authorities, and officials arrived with shackles to haul the heretic cultivator off to prison.  

"The case is closed. All sixty merit points are yours," He Qingyu said. "Congratulations."  

Then she added softly, "Don't be so reckless next time."  

She was referring to how Li Zhengjing had sent her to notify Chen Bing and Zhou Mo but didn't wait for all four to gather before acting alone.  

"I sent you away on purpose," Li Zhengjing admitted after a pause. "I was ninety percent confident I could take him down. But in case things went wrong, I had you notify the other two. If I failed, you'd arrive later and still catch him."  

"When I couldn't find you after bringing them to meet up, I knew you'd tricked me," He Qingyu sighed. "It's late. Get some rest. Tomorrow, collect the case resolution documents from the authorities, and we can return to the sect."  

With that, she left. Li Zhengjing pocketed the token and returned to his quarters.  

The next morning, he obtained the case resolution documents from the local magistrate.  

"Why was it so smooth?" Li Zhengjing muttered in disappointment. "Didn't Chen Bing and Zhou Mo pressure the magistrate to take the credit for themselves, leaving me empty-handed and furious enough to kill? They really don't follow the script..."  

Just then, Lu Xiaoxuan arrived with news.  

"The heretic cultivator wants to see you?"  

"Yes," Lu Xiaoxuan nodded. "After being interrogated by Immortal Chen and Immortal Zhou, he asked for you."  

"Oh?"  

Li Zhengjing waved his hand. "Lead the way."  

Following Lu Xiaoxuan into the prison, he saw the black-robed heretic cultivator, his shoulders pierced by iron hooks and bound in heavy shackles.  

Lu Xiaoxuan withdrew, leaving the two alone.  

"That Chen Bing mocked me earlier," the heretic cultivator said, his face twisted in pain. "Last night, he deliberately delayed, hoping you'd die by my hand. Instead, I lost to you."  

"Expected. Not all sect brothers are united in harmony," Li Zhengjing shrugged. "If I had the chance, I'd kill him too. But sect rules forbid it..."  

"I like your attitude. That guy mentioned you only cultivated inner energy half a month ago."  

"To reach this level in such a short time and even wield Daoist techniques—unheard of!"  

"Losing to a prodigy like you isn't shameful."  

The black-robed man sighed, then asked, "Want to hear a story?"  

Li Zhengjing shook his head. "No."  

"You spared me last night. Didn’t you want to ask me something?"  

Li Zhengjing didn’t deny it, so the man began his tale.  

"That couple accused of theft were good people. I ruined them."  

"I come from the north. I’m no saint—I’ve practiced dark arts, killed, and burned without hesitation."  

"Seventeen years ago, the three great sects invaded Fengdu Mountain, plundering treasures. The northern lands collapsed, turning barren and lifeless, filled with sinister energy."  

"So I came to the Great Zhou, refining infants to boost my cultivation. After killing about a hundred, I was hunted and nearly died, escaping by jumping into a river."  

"I floated for five days before that couple saved me, spending all their silver on medicine for me."  

"After recovering, I feared implicating them, so I robbed and killed over a dozen families, forcing them to flee with three thousand taels of silver."  

"They came here to start a business but were targeted by Cai Yue."  

"They weren’t thieves—Cai Yue was the robber."  

"After their deaths, the case was hastily closed when Cai Yue bribed the officials."  

"Oh, and that constable Wu didn’t get any silver. He took an indestructible token instead."  

The black-robed man chuckled. "I didn’t mention the token. It’s yours now. Any questions?"  

"What is the token?" Li Zhengjing frowned.  

"No idea. Seventeen years ago, during the Fengdu Mountain battle, I looted it from a corpse’s upper half."  

"It’s impervious to fire, water, and blades, but I never figured out its purpose. Not that I’d tell you if I had."  

The man continued, "I gave it to the couple as a keepsake, hoping to take in any descendants with talent."  

"But after losing it, my dark energy began corroding me."  

"So I sought it out, only to find the couple dead and the token missing."  

"Now it’s yours. Unravel its secrets yourself—I’ll be dead by then."  

The man laughed, seemingly at peace.  

Li Zhengjing glanced at him and left.  

As he walked away, the black-robed man’s expression turned icy. "That token brings misfortune. One day, its curse will kill you too..."  

Returning to his quarters, Li Zhengjing focused on the golden page in his mind.  

**Fortune:**  
*Carrying the "Dengjia Token" for more than ten days will subject you to a curse, gradually turning you into a malevolent spirit!*  

*In twenty-seven days, the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord will return from the capital. Seeing you cursed, he will realize you are not the Eternal Verdant Saint Body. Enraged, he will personally torture and annihilate you, reducing you to ashes!*  

"Figures he wasn’t being kind."  

Li Zhengjing tossed the token aside, planning to give it to Ghost Valley’s Spirit Official that night.  

He exhaled. "Twenty-seven days until the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord returns?"  

The pressure weighed on him. He went to the courtyard, untied the sack, and beat the Five Elements Creation Tree to vent his frustration.  

Afterward, he uprooted the tree, stuffed it back into the sack, and prepared to visit the "Spirit Official Hall."  

But then, someone knocked on his door.  

Opening it, he found He Qingyu there to bid farewell before leaving Qixing Prefecture.  

"News just arrived—Chen Youyu, the former Ancient Moon Peak outer sect steward expelled from the sect, was killed the day before yesterday at noon!"  

"What? Steward Chen is dead? When? Did he suffer?"  

Li Zhengjing feigned shock, then sighed mournfully. "What a tragedy."  

"He was killed at noon the day before yesterday. Lost an arm, took a sword strike and twelve knife wounds. You were on your way here then."  

"How gruesome!" Li Zhengjing lamented.  

"Chen Youyu was from the Chen clan and an outer sect steward. His murder shortly after being assigned to Bailing Prefecture has stirred up trouble, tarnishing the sect’s reputation. Even the Enforcement Hall is involved."  

He Qingyu added, "Chen Bing and Zhou Mo are already heading to Daling City in Bailing Prefecture. I’m going too—my beast-taming skills might help the Enforcement Hall track the killer and earn some merit."  

Li Zhengjing’s heart skipped a beat. *"Before I left, the bird set a fire. Hopefully, all the rats were burned..."*  

Seeing him lost in thought, He Qingyu asked, "Want to come to Daling City, Junior Brother?"  

*Go catch myself?* Li Zhengjing shook his head. "I’m satisfied with the merit I’ve earned this trip."  

"Returning to the sect, then?"  

"Of course. The mountain’s spiritual energy aids cultivation."  

He suddenly added, "Senior Sister, focus on your training. Don’t linger in the mortal world. Come back with me—I’ll even give you thirty merit points to clear your debt and avoid punishment!"  

"I’ll earn my own!"  

He Qingyu waved and left with her white wolf.  

Watching her go, Li Zhengjing felt uneasy and checked the golden page again.  

Seeing his fortune unchanged, he relaxed—she wouldn’t trace the crime back to him.  

Then he hoisted the sack, gave it a few more whacks, and headed to the Spirit Official Hall.  

The moment he stepped inside, a flash of light shot toward his face.  

"What the—?!"  

Startled, Li Zhengjing drew his blade!
