**Chapter 56: Third Stage of Qi Refining**

"You know there's only one, so how could you cultivate all five cultivation methods? Condensing true essence isn't like your usual cultivation, which can proceed independently in different meridian groups. There's only one meridian for condensing true essence, so you must condense them one by one. If you put five in at once, wouldn't it just explode?"

Shui Yu's tone became agitated. "And if you condense them one by one, wouldn't the true essence that finishes condensing first become much stronger, easily disrupting the balance between the true essences in your body? What would you do then?"

Ding Rui was stunned after hearing this. He had indeed overlooked this point. But then, remembering what Shui Yu had just said, he quickly asked, "But Senior Brother Shui, didn't you say some cultivators also cultivated two, or even three, cultivation methods? How did they solve this problem?"

Shui Yu pondered for a moment. "That, I'm not too sure about. There are solutions, but there will always be risks. After all, if the strength of the true essences differs too much, it will inevitably cause various problems in the body."

"If you plan to cultivate two or three cultivation methods to the Second Stage of Qi Refining, or even higher, you can ask someone with relevant experience. There are quite a few Senior Brothers in the sect who possess two or more cultivation methods, and not all of them are Spirit Farmers. After all, even if you're not a Spirit Farmer, you can still cultivate multiple methods."

"But if you want to condense and break through with all five cultivation methods, I advise you to think and ask more, and abandon that idea as soon as possible. It's not that I'm being alarmist, but in the several hundred years of this sect's domain, no cultivator has ever succeeded. Do you think other cultivators wouldn't have the same idea as you? They would."

His purpose in saying these words was achieved.

Shui Yu indeed highly regarded Ding Rui.

However, just as Shui Yu imagined, Ding Rui wouldn't be scared off by a few words.

After all, breaking through all five cultivation methods to the Second or Third Stage of Qi Refining, or even the Foundation Establishment stage, was extremely difficult, and no cultivator had ever done it, but no one said it was impossible.

Moreover, Ding Rui knew he was different from other cultivators.

He had a skill panel.

This simply gave him an extra possibility compared to other cultivators, and directly imbued him with more confidence.

Nevertheless, Shui Yu's words were a great help to Ding Rui. He had already begun to think about finding opportunities to ask those Senior Brothers and Sisters who cultivated two or three methods simultaneously. He wanted to understand what it felt like to cultivate multiple methods and what difficulties they encountered.

...

"Senior Brother, you still haven't told me about this floating boat," Ding Rui said, suddenly remembering that Shui Yu hadn't answered his earlier question after processing their previous conversation.

After all, he could only sit on the floating boat the entire journey with nothing else to do, and this boat, capable of floating in the air, truly piqued Ding Rui's curiosity.

The question he had asked Shui Yu earlier was about the floating boat.

"Hahahaha..." Shui Yu burst into laughter. "As expected of the cultivator I favor, Junior Brother is quite clever."

Although he was praising Ding Rui, the smugness on Shui Yu's face was impossible to hide.

The Condensing Sea stage was an entire realm higher than the Foundation Establishment stage.

It was truly rare; this was Ding Rui's first time facing a Condensing Sea stage cultivator directly.

Just as Ding Rui was filled with awe, Shui Yu suddenly changed the subject. "However, I am not a cultivator of the Condensing Sea stage."

Ding Rui paused, but then immediately reacted, his mouth involuntarily opening. "Could it be... could it be that Senior Brother is at the Core Formation stage?"
