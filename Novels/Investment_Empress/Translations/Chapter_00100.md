Chapter 100: I'm So Disappointed in You!

The next morning, the sky was painted with hues of dawn as the sun slowly rose in the east. The air was filled with the lingering fragrance of the night before. Li Mo had grown accustomed to not seeing Ying Bing, also known as "Ice Lump," in the morning. He got out of bed, estimating the progress he had made in his cultivation. As he headed downstairs, he found Ying Bing already waiting for him.

The hot pot restaurant was closed, but a figure stood under the tree outside. The woman wore a deep blue dress that highlighted her slender figure, and she carried a long sword. The wind blew gently through the tassels on her hat, revealing a glimpse of her calm and serene eyes.

"Who is she?" someone whispered.

The crowd around her couldn't help but stare, mesmerized by her presence. Li Mo smiled and said, "Let's go." As they walked into the city, the atmosphere felt more like what Li Mo had imagined when he thought of being a hero.

The city was bustling with people and carriages. Li Mo decided to buy some snacks and visit Xiao Jiang Gong Zhu and the children. As they walked through the market, Li Mo was hailed as "Li Da Shan Ren," or "Li, the Kind-hearted," due to his previous endorsement of a sugar-coated haws stall. The vendor had even made a sign that read, "Sugar-coated Haws, endorsed by Li Da Shan Ren." The crowd swarmed around, and Li Mo had to use his agility to escape.

Ying Bing was curious about Li Mo's fame in the city. Li Mo explained the situation, and Ying Bing listened, a hint of a smile on her lips.

As they arrived at Ni Jiao Alley, they found the courtyard tidy and clean, with a makeshift stove and a repaired roof. The children swarmed around Li Mo, excited to see him. Jiang Chu Long, a shy girl, peeked from behind the door, her face red.

Li Mo called out to her, "Chu Long, I brought some treats." Jiang Chu Long hesitantly emerged, and Li Mo began to prepare lunch for the children. Ying Bing watched from a distance, her expression soft.

Just as they were about to eat, a voice boomed from outside the gate. "What are you doing here?!" It was Luo Yu, a young man dressed in fine clothes, holding two sugar-coated haws.

Luo Yu was furious, having waited for Li Mo and Ying Bing at the government office. He had expected them to meet him, but they were nowhere to be found. Li Mo explained that they had forgotten, and Luo Yu was appalled.

"I thought you two were capable, but I'm so disappointed in you!" Luo Yu exclaimed, his face red with anger. "You're just running a hot pot restaurant? What's the point of that?"

Li Mo shrugged, amused. Ying Bing didn't even bother to look at Luo Yu. Luo Yu's anger turned to despair, and he stormed off. However, he returned, asking to borrow two sugar-coated haws. Li Mo handed them over, and Luo Yu muttered, "My sister wants to eat them."

Before leaving, Luo Yu warned, "Don't think this means I'm forgiving you. I'm still disappointed in you." He glanced at the children and added, "There have been recent child disappearances."

After Luo Yu left, Li Mo and Ying Bing exchanged a look. Li Mo asked the children if they had seen anything suspicious, but they shook their heads. Just then, Xiao Qin, disguised as a commoner, arrived, his expression grave. "Xiao Mi Tuo sent a message," he said.

The story continued, but the arrival of Xiao Qin marked a shift in the narrative, hinting at new developments and challenges for Li Mo and his companions.
