# Chapter 685: The Great Radiance and the Fruit of All Life

After a stalemate of ten breaths, Tongzhen Zhenjun knew the situation was untenable.

Dongming Zhenjun was resting while waiting for an opportunity. Although she was injured, her foundation was unscathed. He, on the other hand, was like a crossbow at the end of its strength—his Dao foundation damaged, his Sword Soul on the verge of shattering, and trapped in this foreign world that suppressed his power.

If the struggle continued, once Yunfan Xu completely suppressed the Chiyang Dao Fruit and freed his hands, or if the three main gods recovered their breath, death would be certain.

A flash of ruthlessness and heartache crossed his eyes.

Having cultivated for thousands of years, wandering through several cycles of reincarnation, and surviving countless life-and-death situations, he had no choice but to sever his own wrist to survive.

"The Jade Star perishes, the Sword Soul burns!"

Tongzhen Zhenjun slapped the ancient jade pendant hanging at his waist.

The jade pendant shattered on impact.

Dongming Zhenjun's expression shook.

"Self-destruction of a spiritual treasure?!"

Like a lit wick, it instantly burst forth with a brilliance a hundred times more dazzling than the sun.

A terrifying Sword Intent, immense and irresistible, far exceeding Tongzhen Zhenjun's current state, exploded outward. This Sword Intent was pure and condensed, carrying the desperate aura of mutual destruction, as if a Golden Core Sword Cultivator had burned all their life and the origin of their Dao Fruit in an instant to unleash a final strike.

**BOOM!**

The self-destructing spiritual treasure transformed into a destructive storm of Sword Souls. Its core was the solid Sword Soul avatar formed from the jade pendant, its aura identical to Tongzhen Zhenjun's.

The power unleashed by this avatar not only slammed into the Xuanming Bone Hand that Dongming Zhenjun had grabbed with but also completely搅乱 (stirred) and tore apart the surrounding space, creating a violent storm of chaotic energy and spatial fragments.

Dongming Zhenjun's face changed drastically. The Xuanming Bone Hand, being the first to bear the brunt, instantly cracked under the terrifying冲击 (impact) equivalent to a Golden Core Zhenjun's self-destruction, and then shattered with a loud bang.

Violent energy currents mixed with sharp and unrivaled fragments of Sword Intent swept over, forcing her to fully activate the Nine Nether Evil Mist to protect her body and retreat rapidly to avoid the锋芒 (sharp edge).

At the core of this destructive storm, in the moment when everyone's divine sense was briefly blinded and obscured by the overwhelming power of this heaven-shaking spiritual treasure self-destruction.

Tongzhen Zhenjun's true body—the already dim and nearly transparent core of his life-bound Sword Soul—used the massive shockwave and spatial chaos generated by the self-destruction as cover.

It transformed into a thread of Sword Qi, finer than a hair, twisted and dim to the extreme, almost blending into the background colors of the Boundary Sea. It was a dark, obscure thread of Sword Qi.

This thread of Sword Qi revealed no sharpness at all, only an extreme artistic conception of emptiness and concealment, as if it had jumped out of cause and effect and entered nothingness.

With an incredible speed and trajectory, like a fish entering the sea, it instantly passed through the spatial rift opened by the spiritual treasure's self-destruction and plunged into the Boundary Sea's chaotic, kaleidoscopic, violent, and disorderly currents, disappearing completely.

The earth-shattering storm of the spiritual treasure's self-destruction gradually subsided, leaving only a slowly closing spatial black hole and a一片狼藉 (devastated scene) of residual energy.

"Dongming! Yunfan Xu! This仇 (enmity), the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect will surely avenge!!"

Tongzhen Zhenjun's low voice slowly spread out, echoing in the sky above.

Dongming Zhenjun stabilized her figure. Her dark Dao robe was slightly disheveled. She looked at the empty rift in the Boundary Sea and sensed that Tongzhen's aura had completely vanished, not even a trace of cause and effect left, having been erased by the violent Boundary Sea and the self-destruction storm. She could only let out a helpless, soft sigh.

Cultivators of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect refined their Sword Intent meticulously, their willpower condensed and firm, almost a natural counter to cause-and-effect secret techniques.

Dongming Zhenjun waved her hand to disperse the remaining Sword Intent, looking at the empty Boundary Sea with helpless emotion.

"A Golden Core Zhenjun is indeed hard to kill."

She turned her head to look at Yunfan Xu, who had初步 (preliminarily) suppressed the Chiyang Dao Fruit and was now looking over coldly. Her gaze was complex.

"Especially the madmen from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. Sword Cultivators are at the top of the Taiping Lingxu World in both killing and speed. If they are determined to flee, without a heaven-spanning net, I can do nothing about it. Tongzhen's Sword Intent is condensed like iron, the greatest counter to cause-and-effect secret methods. He also possesses such a决绝 (desperate) and ruthless life-saving method. Burning a spiritual treasure to替死 (die in his place), transforming into a Sword Thread to escape into the void—this kind of Golden Cicada Sloughing Shell technique is impossible to guard against."

Yunfan Xu was not surprised by this. A Golden Core was indeed hard to kill. The fact that he could kill Chiyang was already due to the fortune of this world assisting him.

The Chiyang Dao Fruit in his palm, though still slightly trembling within the紫金 (purple-gold) lightning net, was gradually calming down.

His gaze swept over the three main gods—Orian, Orian, and Ymir—who had fallen into silence, severely injured and listless due to their main god's severe injury.

His voice was calm and波澜不惊 (waveless).

"It's fine. We've折损 (crippled) Chiyang and let Tongzhen escape. This battle is already profitable enough."

After all, Tongzhen Zhenjun had called out Dongming Zhenjun's name first. If misfortune were to follow, Dongming would surely be the first to suffer.

He pointed towards the Dark Main God Ymir, who was pinned down in the void by the Xuan Evil Bone Hand.

"The Fruit of Eternal Night and Descent归 (belongs to) Senior Sister. The remaining two will be my辛苦费 (hardship fee)."

Hearing this, the slight gloom on Dongming Zhenjun's face due to Tongzhen's escape was instantly replaced by a captivating, enchanting smile.

What she sought was precisely this thing.

Without the slightest hesitation, the Nine Nether Evil Mist surging around her, like a venomous snake smelling blood, suddenly became thick and cold. Carrying a terrifying Dao Charm that could erode and freeze the soul, it transformed into countless black chains that wrapped layer upon layer around the immobilized Dark Main God Ymir.

"Junior Brother is straightforward!"

She let out a light laugh. As her red lips opened and closed, an arcane incantation was already being chanted. The power of the Nine Abyss Xuan Evil Dao Fruit was fully activated. The evil mist chains dug deep into Ymir's divine body, beginning to forcibly peel away and devour the authority of the Fruit of Eternal Night and Descent, which contained the will of eternal silence and descent.

Ymir let out a silent scream. His divine body convulsed violently. The dark ice crystals on his surface rapidly dimmed. The pain of his origin being forcibly extracted caused the laws of darkness throughout the Aetira world to哀鸣 (mourn).

At the same time, Yunfan Xu transformed into a purple-gold thunderbolt that tore through the void, instantly appearing above the severely injured Light Main God Orian and the Nature Lord Orian.

He swept his sleeve. The Star Spirit Banner fluttered and crackled, growing with the wind. The deep, dark banner surface instantly covered half the sky.

"The stars of the周天 (universe), heed my command! Seal the heavens, lock the earth, suppress the gods, refine the souls!"

Three hundred and sixty-five main stars detached from the banner surface, bursting with brilliant starlight, and instantly formed a magnificent and vast Great Array of the Zodiac.

Boundless starlight, like a Milky Way from the ninth heaven, descended, carrying the great power of imprisoning space and grinding down divinity. It completely enveloped and suppressed the two main gods of Light and Nature, along with the space around them.

The Light Main God Orian's holy light fluctuated violently around him, attempting to爆发 (unleash) his final power of light purification. But under the suppression of the Star Array and his own severe injuries, the light was like a candle in the wind, quickly being submerged and eroded by the vast star power.

The vines and forests summoned by the Nature Lord Orian, under the starlight, were like encountering a natural enemy, rapidly withering and崩解 (disintegrating). His massive body was firmly bound by star power chains, and the emerald green divine blood containing vitality was continuously refined and extracted by the starlight.

Yunfan Xu stood beneath the Star Banner. His purple-gold lightning eyes were sharp, his divine sense like a knife.

He formed a seal with both hands. The Divine Xiao Golden Core vibrated wildly, drawing upon the residual favor of the Aetira Dao to bless himself, while simultaneously催动 (driving) the supreme power of the Great Array of the Zodiac to begin forcibly refining the core authority of the two main gods.

The Fruit of Great Radiance and the Fruit of All Life.
