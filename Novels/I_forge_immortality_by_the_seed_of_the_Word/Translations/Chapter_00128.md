# Chapter 126: The Art of Flexibility

The next day.

At the Heritage Pavilion.

"Senior Brother, is there really no way?" Zhang Jing looked at the inner court senior brother across from him, his eyes flickering uncertainly.

Sensing his gaze, the stern-faced inner court disciple couldn't help but show a trace of helplessness as he replied sincerely, "Junior Brother Zhang Jing, it's not that I don't want to help you, but this simply isn't done! While your talent is extraordinary, you can't disregard the academy's regulations like this."

As he spoke, a hint of grievance crept into his voice. After finishing, he couldn't resist glancing at the massive white deer crouched at Zhang Jing's feet before stating firmly, "No matter what, the academy's heritage will not be made available to a mere mount!"

"Is there truly no room for negotiation?" Zhang Jing asked, his heart sinking with disappointment.

The other party shook his head resolutely, as if to say: This matter is not up for discussion!

Meanwhile, Deer Thirty-Eight had also understood the implication. His large eyes unconsciously revealed a look of disappointment. If his excitement this morning upon hearing his master say he would take him to choose cultivation techniques had been sky-high, then his current despondency was equally profound.

The inner court disciple's words had plunged Deer Thirty-Eight into despair. 

That's right—I'm just a mount. What right do I have to practice these immortal techniques? Deer Thirty-Eight's eyes gradually dimmed. Even his pride in his master's future position as inner court leader quietly dissipated. No matter how strong his master became, what did that have to do with him, a mere mount?

He, Deer Thirty-Eight, couldn't cause trouble for his master!

With this thought, Deer Thirty-Eight raised his head and nuzzled Zhang Jing's arm. A somewhat dejected voice sounded in his mind: "Master, maybe we should forget it. I can cultivate just fine by eating spirit herbs—my progress is quite fast."

Zhang Jing turned to look at Deer Thirty-Eight, a complex expression flashing through his eyes. He had made a promise to him, after all.

Just then, a streak of light flashed by.

Liu Lizhi's figure suddenly appeared before them.

"Senior Brother, you've come at the perfect time. Junior Brother Zhang Jing wants to—" The stern-faced inner court disciple seemed to have found his savior upon seeing Liu Lizhi and immediately spoke up, hoping to gain his support.

But before he could finish, Liu Lizhi cut him off with a gentle tone: "Junior Brother, I'm already aware of the matter. No need to say more."

Then, Liu Lizhi turned to Zhang Jing and asked softly, "Junior Brother, you want to obtain a cultivation heritage for this white deer, correct?"

Zhang Jing nodded with a smile.

"Haha, that's easily handled. The academy does have a rule against opening heritage access to mounts. But if your mount were an outer court disciple, then this rule wouldn't apply, would it?"

At these words, Zhang Jing's gaze froze in astonishment.

You could do it like that?

On the other side, Liu Lizhi paid no heed to Zhang Jing's shocked expression. Smiling, he took out an identity jade token and handed it directly to Zhang Jing, saying lightly, "As it happens, I still have some outer court disciple quotas available. I'll give one to you."

Zhang Jing looked down at the token.

The words "Deer Thirty-Eight" were clearly inscribed upon it.

Meanwhile, the stern-faced disciple seemed to suddenly realize something and hurriedly exclaimed, "Senior Brother, you can't do this! The academy has no rule stating that a mount or spirit beast can receive an outer court disciple identity!"

"But neither does it forbid it, does it?" Liu Lizhi's expression remained unchanged, still carrying that faint smile.

"This—"

"Oh, and this is also the Pavilion Master's intention."

The stern-faced disciple was instantly silenced.

Deer Thirty-Eight was currently selecting a heritage within the treasure vault.

In the main hall outside, Zhang Jing and Liu Lizhi were chatting.

Suddenly, as if remembering something, Zhang Jing turned to Liu Lizhi and asked obliquely, "Senior Brother, may I ask if every inner court disciple has outer court disciple quotas?"

Hearing this, Liu Lizhi looked at Zhang Jing with surprise before appearing thoughtful. "Naturally. Does Junior Brother have someone outstanding you'd like to recommend to the academy?"

Zhang Jing nodded with a smile and explained, "To be honest, this person is a rogue cultivator with whom I share some karma."

"I see." A flash of understanding crossed Liu Lizhi's face. "A rogue cultivator? That makes it even simpler. Does Junior Brother have a way to contact this person?"

"Of course." Zhang Jing produced a communication talisman from his hand.

"Haha, with Junior Brother's status, you should focus on cultivation rather than worry about such minor matters." Liu Lizhi laughed heartily and immediately summoned an outer court disciple nearby.

"Senior Brother, what are your instructions?" The outer court disciple quickly approached and asked respectfully.

Liu Lizhi took the communication talisman from Zhang Jing and handed it to the disciple, saying lightly, "Take this communication talisman and personally make the trip. Arrange for this person to join the outer court as soon as possible."

"Understood, Senior Brother." The outer court disciple replied calmly, as if this wasn't his first time receiving such an order.

"Thank you, Senior Brother." Zhang Jing expressed his gratitude.

"Haha, no need for formalities, Junior Brother."

At this moment, Zhang Jing glanced subtly at Liu Lizhi, inwardly marveling.

So this is the power of an inner court disciple?!

Back then, it had taken him over a decade of effort to earn his academy disciple status. Yet now, it could be arranged with just a few words.

The disparity was truly astonishing and sobering.

Meanwhile, on Luodu Island, in the Luodu Pavilion.

Inside a quiet chamber.

Tong Yao sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, carefully observing Senior Brother Li seated across from her. She couldn't help but show a trace of confusion on her face, mixed with a hint of worry.

Though she had been part of the Luodu squad for some time and had met Squad Leader Li before, this was the first time he had summoned her specifically like this.

With this thought, her heart tightened as she began reviewing her recent actions.

Had she made some mistake that caught Senior Brother Li's attention, prompting this reprimand?

What punishment would the squad impose?

But no matter how much she thought about it, she couldn't recall doing anything wrong.

Wait—as if struck by a realization, Tong Yao's heart clenched.

Could it be that the Luodu squad was planning to expel her for still being at the third level of Qi Refinement after five years of cultivation?

But cultivation required resources!

Ever since the demon uprising in Langya County, both she and Senior Brother Ding had faced continuous misfortune. The Dao merits they earned were pitifully few, and naturally, their cultivation had stagnated.

Tong Yao felt somewhat aggrieved.

Similarly, Senior Brother Ding, sitting beside her with only his left arm remaining, wore a faint look of unease.

Just then, Senior Brother Li across from them smiled leisurely and said softly, "Junior Brother Ding, Junior Sister Tong, the reason I called you both here today is regarding instructions from Senior Brother Zhang Jing."

"He left some cultivation resources specifically for the two of you."
