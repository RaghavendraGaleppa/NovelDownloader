# Chapter 50: Inside the Black Market

The scholar’s talk was something Xu Yunfan had heard so often while eating and drinking at the Changfeng Tavern that his ears were practically calloused.

The Great Zhou Empress wanted to secure her throne, and she certainly had her iron-fisted methods.

The old faction was unwilling to let a woman not of the Li family sit on the throne, so naturally, people like Lian Yuanzhang and He Ming openly rebelled.

Back at the Qinghe Residence, Xu Yunfan looked up at the moon.

It was just a corner short of being a full white jade plate hanging in the sky.

"A few more days."

Xu Yunfan toyed with the iron token in his hand.

Three days passed in a flash. That night, Xu Yunfan left the city, changing into a black outfit in the woods along the official road. He wrapped his heavy hammer in black cloth and strapped it to his back.

He strode toward the west of the city, moving with great speed.

Thirty li of distance, under his full-speed sprint, was covered in the time it takes to drink a cup of tea.

From afar, Xu Yunfan saw a stone bridge looming in and out of the mist.

Xu Yunfan stopped in front of a withered willow grove not far from the bridge.

The shrill cry of a night owl pierced the mist. The stone bridge before him was covered in moss, and a broken lantern hung on a crooked wooden post at the bridgehead.

The lame old Taoist was sitting on a broken wooden stool in the shadow of the bridge pier. His sunken eye sockets looked like two dry wells. Despite the cold wind blowing, he didn't seem to move a single muscle.

He should be at least a First-Stage Martial Teacher, either Muscle Refining or Bone Refining.

If he were only Skin Refining, he would be like Old Man Lu, with knotted muscles all over.

But this old Taoist was too old; his vital energy and blood had withered, and he couldn't exert more than fifty percent of his peak strength.

If one does not perfect the muscles, bones, and skin, and enter the Muscle Refining Realm by achieving the External Three Unities, one's strength will decline year by year as vital energy and blood dissipate with age.

Xu Yunfan stood for a long time, his gaze sweeping the area. There were at least five people in the withered willow grove, all dressed in black, with steady breaths and long, even respirations. Their strength was not trivial.

But none of them had likely reached the perfection of the First Stage.

Xu Yunfan glanced over and paid them no more mind.

He saw someone emerge from the withered willow grove, show their token, and cross the bridge. Then, one after another, others showed their tokens to enter.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated. He stepped forward quickly and handed over his iron token.

"Fog Concealment Token?"

The old Taoist’s fingernail scraped along the scratch on the token and sniffed the smell of rust.

"Leave the market before the Chou hour (1-3 AM). No fighting inside the Ghost Market. Violators will be attacked by everyone."

The old Taoist said casually, returning the token to Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, passed the old Taoist, and slowly walked to the other side of the stone bridge.

On the other side of the stone bridge, a small hill came into view. There was a crack in the hill, and black-clad figures were constantly entering and exiting.

Xu Yunfan followed the flow of people into the crack in the mountain, passed through a hidden passage, and suddenly beheld a hundred-zhang-long underground street.

Honeycomb-like caves were carved into the stone walls on both sides, and masked vendors set up counters in front of the caves.

Burly men wearing ghost masks dragged heavy cangues, the iron chains scraping against the bluestone ground and sending out sparks.

It was completely different from the cold and eerie Ghost Market he had imagined; it was incredibly lively, the noisy sounds even more boisterous than a vegetable market.

The pedestrians coming and going all concealed their figures, not showing their true faces.

Passing the seventh cave, a one-eyed, masked man was talking with flying spittle.

"Look at this 'Subduing the Dragon Palm,' it was personally written by a Beggar Sect elder thirty years ago. It's a genuine top-tier Muscle Refining martial art..."

Xu Yunfan stopped and flipped to the exposed palm technique manual. He indeed found it profound.

"How much?"

The one-eyed man quickly said, "Brother wants to buy? I'll sell it to you for a sincere price, two thousand three hundred taels of silver."

Xu Yunfan's eye twitched. He rubbed the page with his fingertips; the ink was clearly newly printed. Calming down, Xu Yunfan felt that this section of martial arts manual was somewhat familiar.

Thinking back carefully, indeed, he had heard this section of storytelling in the teahouse just three days ago.

He silently put it down and turned to leave.

The one-eyed burly man wanted to coldly say a few words when he suddenly noticed the heavy weapon on Xu Yunfan's back. His mouth immediately shut, and he grumbled, saying no more.

Those who could use heavy weapons and move freely were, without exception, extremely fierce.

Walking around the area selling secret manuals, what truly caught Xu Yunfan's attention was a black-robed old woman at the end of the street, hunched over and leaning on a cane.

A large stack of secret manuals in front of her was wrapped in oil paper at the corners. The pages of "Iron Shirt" were yellowed and curled, looking like genuine antiques.

Xu Yunfan's fingertip swept over a flawed illustration, and he suddenly exerted force, tearing open the glued section—underneath, the words "Postpartum Care for Sows" were revealed.

The cover of "Golden Bell Shield" concealed an erotic picture book, and the inner pages of "One Yang Finger" were pasted with wanted posters.

"..."

The old woman immediately jumped up, her sharp voice cursing, "You brat, why are you destroying my secret manual? This is a peerless divine skill!"

Xu Yunfan really wanted to pull out his heavy hammer and give the old woman a whack. He let out a breath instead, turned around, and left without a word, leaving the old woman to jump and curse in place.

The people around the Ghost Market seemed accustomed to this scene, still minding their own business.

"Does the customer want to buy real martial arts?"

From a cave not far from the old woman, a man wearing an iron mask spoke. His judge's pen tapped on the stone table, sending out sparks.

On the table were neatly stacked seven thread-bound books. The covers were the most common indigo coarse paper, with book titles like "Crouching Tiger Long Fist" and "Six Harmonies Blade Technique" written in tiny regular script.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the titles of the books and said淡淡ly, "These kinds of goods, I could buy a whole stack at the bookshop in the east of the city for thirty copper coins."

As he spoke, his gaze sharpened.

Inside this cave, the light from the fire starter illuminated finger marks three inches deep into the wall. The edges of these holes piercing through the bluestone were smooth, clearly left by a master who had reached the pinnacle of eagle claw一类 techniques.

At least a Bone Refining perfection martial teacher would have such power.

Although North Ye City was small, he had encountered quite a few First-Stage Martial Teachers. By now, he knew of at least four or five.

"Buy a stack for thirty copper coins?"

The judge's pen in the man's hand spun several times in his fingertips, a hint of amusement in his eyes.

"More than that, at least thirty taels. In these times, knowing how to read is also a livelihood."

Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment. He had walked a circle in this Ghost Market; there were all sorts of things for sale, but the vast majority were fakes. Many items required one's own discerning eye to judge.

Moreover, many items had a distinct smell of blood, clearly stolen goods.

"Are there any real martial arts?"

"Of course, everything sold by my Golden Peak Tower is the real deal."

The iron-masked man asked, "What kind of martial art are you looking for?"

"Bone forging techniques."

"Bone forging techniques? You're in luck, customer. I just happen to have one here."

The iron-masked man didn't answer directly. Instead, he took a thick classic from the wooden chest behind him and placed it on the table in front of Xu Yunfan.

On the cover of the classic, three gilded characters were prominently displayed:

"Golden Crow Bone Forging Chapter."

"Bone forging technique?"

Xu Yunfan's fingers gently stroked the cover, feeling the rough texture of the paper. He could sense that this classic was likely genuine, but just...

Xu Yunfan opened the classic, about to look closely, when the judge's pen in the iron-masked man's hand extended out, pressing down on the classic.

Xu Yunfan said, "If I don't look, how can I verify if it's the real thing?"

The iron-masked man did not answer immediately. Instead, he lightly tapped the stone table with his judge's pen, making a crisp sound.

His eyes were deep, as if seeing through Xu Yunfan's thoughts.

"Customer, do you know how many eyes are watching these martial arts underground in North Ye City? And how many people have died here to get a true transmission?"
