Chapter 8: Outwitting the Enemy

One hit kill!

Lin Xuan's expression turned grim as his opponent's ruthless attack caught him off guard. He gritted his teeth and didn't dodge; instead, he took a step back.

The flying sword missed him and hit the mountain wall behind, causing a loud rumble and sending rocks tumbling down. Zhou Yan's face was filled with shock; she couldn't believe that a novice at the early stage of Ling Dong could dodge her attack. Moreover, it was bizarre that Lin Xuan didn't dodge; he had suddenly sunk into the ground just as the flying sword was about to hit him.

Zhou Yan was both furious and astonished, and she couldn't help but take a step forward to investigate. As she took her third step, a large net suddenly fell from above, ensnaring her.

Caught off guard, Zhou Yan was shocked and tried to break free from the net by performing a hand seal. However, just then, an ice pellet shot out from the ground where Lin Xuan had sunk, hitting a rope tied to a big tree.

The rope snapped, and a bamboo stick, as thick as a bowl, with both ends sharpened, flew towards Zhou Yan.

"No..."

Zhou Yan's vicious voice turned to a scream of terror, followed by a cry of pain as the bamboo stick pierced through her chest. She died with a look of unwillingness, still clutching the treasure she had taken from her master. Two minutes later, Lin Xuan emerged from the pit, looked at Zhou Yan's corpse, and let out a sigh of relief. It was a close call.

If he hadn't planned carefully, he would be the one lying on the ground.

From the moment Lin Xuan was discovered, he had thought about how to resolve the crisis. Running away wasn't an option; the valley was several miles away from the sect, and he would be caught and killed by Zhou Yan before he could escape. Lin Xuan only knew the Qing Shen technique, which allowed him to move lightly, while Zhou Yan, as a master at the peak of Ling Dong, knew the more advanced Yu Feng technique, making her much faster.

With no chance of outrunning her and begging for mercy being futile, Lin Xuan's only option was to fight back. Killing Zhou Yan was the only way to save himself. At first glance, this seemed impossible due to their vast difference in skill. Lin Xuan wasn't a match for Zhou Yan, not even if there were a hundred of him.

However, Lin Xuan had no other choice, and he couldn't defeat her in a straightforward fight, so he had to outwit her.

To outwit Zhou Yan, Lin Xuan first analyzed the situation to his advantage. His only advantage was his familiarity with the terrain since he had discovered the valley two years ago. Although he couldn't recall every detail, he knew it like the back of his hand.

In contrast, Zhou Yan had apparently landed there by chance, making the valley's terrain unfamiliar to her.

Lin Xuan utilized this from the start, taking a winding path to buy more time.

The next step was crucial. Besides occasional rare flowers and herbs, the valley was home to various animals, from rabbits to bears and tigers. Lin Xuan had set up traps for hunting, and this time, luck was on his side; the traps were intact.

There were two traps. One was an ordinary pitfall for smaller animals, covered with grass, which Lin Xuan had used to his advantage. He had calculated that Zhou Yan would attack him viciously on sight, and by stepping back into the pit, he could dodge her attack.

The other trap was more lethal, designed for larger animals like lions and tigers, equipped with a fishing net and sharpened bamboo sticks. Lin Xuan had planned to lure Zhou Yan into this trap.

Every step was calculated, with Lin Xuan anticipating Zhou Yan's reactions. Despite the danger, Lin Xuan remained calm, thinking through his plan.

In the end, his plan succeeded, not because of his strength, but because of his intelligence and calmness.

The battle didn't consume much of his energy, but it was mentally draining. Lin Xuan sat down to rest, coldly eyeing Zhou Yan's corpse before walking over to take a jade-green bracelet from her hand. It was a storage device used by cultivators, containing a separate space. Lin Xuan probed it with his divine sense and retrieved its contents.

He discarded the clothes, food, and cosmetics without a second glance.

"Got it," Lin Xuan exclaimed, his face filled with joy, as he held two crystalline stones.

These were crystal stones, something Lin Xuan had heard his seniors mention countless times during his three years in Piao Yun Valley. They were as precious as elixirs and magical artifacts. Crystal stones contained rich heavenly and earthly spiritual energy that cultivators could absorb directly.

The quality and purity of the spiritual energy determined the stone's grade: lower, middle, upper, or top grade. Crystal stones were indispensable for practicing, crafting, and battling, and they were used as currency among cultivators.
