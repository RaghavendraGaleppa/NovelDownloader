# Chapter 35: Seven Gangs, Eighteen Societies, An Uninvited Guest

"The Vile Demonic Sea has no mortals; anyone who appears here is a cultivator."

"In this sea region, never fly too close to the surface, because some powerful demonic beasts can suck you down from the sky with an open maw, and with a crunch, you'll die without a complete corpse."

"Some demonic beasts can leap a hundred *zhang* high, even dragging down cultivators flying through the clouds—it's truly a sudden calamity."

"Islands are actually not very safe either; you must remain vigilant at all times, as some powerful demonic beasts like to stealthily sneak onto islands to hunt human cultivators. If you're unfortunately cornered in a cave, then it's the Road to the Yellow Springs."

"The most terrifying scenario is a Demonic King's island massacre. Some vicious individuals specifically target islands where cultivators gather, and once that happens, it's a tragedy. Unless there's a Nascent Soul True Monarch guarding the island, absolutely do not gather too much."

"However, if you don't stick together, the risks increase, which is quite vexing."

Golden Abacus said with a bitter smile, "Generally, cultivators adventuring in the Vile Demonic Sea will have some mental issues, more or less. For resources, they constantly live in fear, unable to even sleep well."

"Is the Vile Demonic Sea that dangerous?" Yang Ji heard this, his eyes turning slightly, and he couldn't help but think of his golden finger.

He immediately asked, "If I could provide them with an island where they could sleep peacefully, without fearing demonic beast incursions, would they be willing to spend Demon Companion Grass to exchange for such an opportunity?"

"Such places do exist, specifically islands protected by the Canglan Sect, Nanyuan Sect, and Changqing Sect. Each island has a Nascent Soul True Monarch stationed there, providing great protection for everyone's safety."

"But the condition is that entering the island requires submitting a stalk of Demon Companion Grass. Some cultivators, for their safety, have no choice but to pay, and the Three Great Sects have thus made a fortune."

"Only the Three Great Sects have the capability to do such a thing, because they have enough Nascent Soul True Monarchs who can rotate duties. Other forces and families, with only a single ancestor, wouldn't dare take such a risk," Golden Abacus said.

Yang Ji secretly thought, "In that case, if I could provide a safe island using my golden finger's ability to seek good fortune and avoid disaster, wouldn't I be able to take a share?"

But he knew it wasn't the right time yet. Firstly, his strength was too low; secondly, he lacked a background, and possessing a treasure would invite trouble.

"Where are we going now?" Yang Ji asked after regaining his composure.

"You should find an island to settle on along the edge of this sea region; the edges are relatively safer. From now on, you'll be responsible for alchemy, and I'll be responsible for going out to find cultivators for trade."

"Also, take this jade talisman. Through it, I can sense your location within a certain range."

Golden Abacus said, handing him a palm-sized jade talisman.

Yang Ji took it and nodded.

"Then I'm off!" Golden Abacus smiled, then soared into the sky, transforming into a streak of light that plunged into the clouds, flying towards the deeper parts of the Vile Demonic Sea.

Yang Ji withdrew his gaze and likewise left the large ship, flying forward.

After flying about a dozen *li*, he successively spotted some island reefs on the sea surface.

Like the Nansha Archipelago, some island reefs were very small, less than a *li* long, with rocks rising less than a *zhang* above the sea, completely submerged by incoming waves. They were only suitable for temporary landing, not for habitation.

Some island reefs were slightly larger, dozens of *li* long, with rocks rising ten *zhang* above the sea, suitable for habitation.

Unfortunately, they had no natural defenses, were battered by strong sea winds, and had poor conditions.

Yet, even on such island reefs, Yang Ji still saw cultivators present.

He flew for another dozen *li*, and the number of island reefs, large and small, increased. Small islands even began to appear, with mountain ranges stretching across them, lush forests, and good feng shui, clearly suitable for habitation.

Yang Ji observed them, then immediately flew down towards a pleasing small island, intending to find a mountain cave to settle down.

But just as he landed, a divine streak of light flew over, clearly having noticed him descending.

The person was a middle-aged cultivator at the tenth level of Qi Condensation, with a square face and ordinary appearance. He immediately asked, "Fellow Daoist, are you stopping here temporarily or residing?"

Yang Ji's eyes slightly turned, "What's the difference?"

"If it's a temporary stop, you can't exceed three days, and the fee is five hundred spirit stones. If it's for residence, it's cheaper: thirty thousand spirit stones per year," the middle-aged cultivator said.

Hearing this, Yang Ji's brows couldn't help but furrow slightly. He finally understood why some small island reefs had cultivators living on them—it turned out that these good islands were occupied by people collecting protection fees.

Seeing Yang Ji's unwilling expression, the middle-aged cultivator's face immediately sank slightly, "This is the territory of our Wind Cliff Society. If Fellow Daoist wishes to reside here, you must abide by our rules. After all, one more person increases the risk of attracting demonic beasts, and while you live here, you are under our protection."

"Farewell!" Yang Ji's voice fell as he shot into the sky. Although he had quite a few spirit stones, he couldn't stand this subtly coercive feeling.

Demonic beasts? With his golden finger, was he afraid of demonic beast attacks?

He flew another dozen *li*.

He landed on every island he encountered, but the situation was the same as before: good islands were all occupied.

One instance was particularly outrageous: he only landed and stood for less than thirty breaths before being forcefully demanded thirty spirit stones. It was simply gangster-like.

If the person who came hadn't been a Foundation Establishment expert, he would have truly wanted to draw his sword and strike him.

Yang Ji now stood above the great sea, feeling somewhat depressed, muttering indignantly, "Seven Gangs, Eighteen Societies? A bunch of forces without even a late Core Formation expert among them. Sooner or later, I'll take all of you in to find Demon Companion Grass for me!"

He frowned and flew away.

Because for now, he couldn't afford to provoke them.

He circled around for a while, only to find a small island reef to land on.

The island reef was less than a *li* long, but fortunately, the rocks rising above the sea surface reached a full twenty-odd *zhang*, standing proudly in the sea like a giant stone pillar, enduring wind and rain.

Yang Ji flew over and, with a few clanging sword strokes, carved out a cave large enough for three people near the top on one side.

With stone walls and a stone roof, and a movable wide stone door, he had finally settled down in this Vile Demonic Sea.

He occupied a stone pillar all by himself, making him the island master.

With his residence settled, Yang Ji, having nothing to do, began to explore the vicinity.

As his gaze swept across, various information about the seabed continuously appeared. After looking around, this place seemed safe.

In the evening, Golden Abacus, holding the jade talisman, found him. Seeing his residence, he chuckled wryly, then also carved out a stone house on the other side.

Inside the stone cave, Yang Ji was now looking at the three hundred-year-old Demon Companion Grass stalks Golden Abacus had brought back, and the day's gloom finally vanished.

"It's quite good to have Golden Abacus running around outside," Yang Ji secretly thought, then began alchemy.

Two stalks of Demon Companion Grass were refined into Demon-Attracting Pills, and one stalk was refined into a Demonic Essence Pill.

He cultivated at night, then handed the Demon-Attracting Pills to Golden Abacus during the day, who then happily flew out again.

This cycle of days continued for half a year in a flash.

Golden Abacus brought back more and more Demon Companion Grass, but every day he had tags like [Secretly Deducting], [Joyful], [Got Rich], [He's really my little cash cow] above his head.

Yang Ji knew that although this guy brought back some Demon Companion Grass each time, he must have secretly hidden quite a bit.

However, he merely turned a blind eye. After all, the Demon Companion Grass brought back was already sufficient for his cultivation needs, and he was happy for such days to continue.

If he went out to find Demon Companion Grass himself, it would inevitably waste unnecessary time.

At this moment, he only needed to focus on breaking through to the tenth level of Qi Condensation; these crucial few years could not have any mishaps.

He quite enjoyed such leisurely days, cultivating while comprehending the Sword Dao Imprint; it was truly comfortable.

Until a year later, on a bright sunny day, an uninvited guest arrived at his island pillar.

"The alchemist behind Golden Abacus lives here?" In the air, a remarkably handsome and heroic young man pointed at the stone pillar, asking in surprise.

"Yes, Young Master, that's correct. Golden Abacus also lives here," said an old man beside the youth, his eyes deep, spiritual energy supporting him underfoot, generating an aura of his own. He was actually a Foundation Establishment expert.

"I heard his alchemy skills are quite good. I'd like to have a competition with him," the youth said, glancing at the Demon-Attracting Pill in his hand, chuckling arrogantly.
