Chapter 79: Slaying the Immortals 2

The members of the Hai Sha Gang were utterly terrified by the ferocity of the Seven Xuan Gate disciples. They had never seen anyone so willing to sacrifice themselves. The high-ranking experts of the Seven Xuan Gate were charging forward without any orders, using their own lives to drain the energy of the Golden Light Mantra held by Jin Guang, the Golden Light Reverend.

In one night, twenty-nine bodies were left on the ground, and yet those people seemed oblivious to death, continuing to charge forward. The brutality of the scene filled the Hai Sha Gang members with fear, and they hesitated to intervene.

Seven individuals, covered in blood, moved stealthily towards Jin Guang, who was holding the Golden Light Mantra. Jin Guang was sweating profusely, his voice hoarse from shouting, "Help me stop them!!"

However, his cries for help fell on deaf ears. The seven individuals, their eyes cold and devoid of emotion, closed in on him. Jin Guang began to panic, his hands trembling as he held the nearly depleted Golden Light Mantra.

Su Zonguang watched the scene unfold with a cold gaze, fascinated by the determination of the mortals to kill a cultivator.

As Jin Guang's Golden Light Mantra began to falter, the seven individuals retreated, only to charge forward again, throwing down another body. This pattern continued until Jin Guang's mantra finally dissipated.

With a snarl, Jin Guang unleashed his magical sword, which clashed with the charging disciples. Three of them fell instantly, but the remaining three continued to press forward. Jin Guang, undaunted, summoned a fireball that engulfed two of the disciples, reducing them to nothing but ashes.

The battle was intense, with the remaining disciple, Meng Wei Zhi, seizing an opportunity to strike Jin Guang down. With a mighty roar, Meng Wei Zhi swung his axe, beheading Jin Guang. Even as his head was severed, Jin Guang's body continued to twitch, his voice begging for mercy.

Meng Wei Zhi, his red hair matted with blood, stood tall, his axe still lodged in Jin Guang's neck. With a cold, merciless gaze, he twisted the axe, ensuring Jin Guang's demise.

As the dust settled, Meng Wei Zhi stood alone, his body covered in blood, his eyes blazing with fury. "Kill! We have trained for decades, and is it for a scoundrel like you to insult us so?!" he roared, his voice echoing through the night.

With a final heave, Meng Wei Zhi tossed Jin Guang's head to the ground, ordering that it be hung at the gate of the Seven Xuan Gate city as a warning to others. However, his triumphant cry was met with an unsettling silence – the Seven Xuan Gate disciples were all dead.

The Hai Sha Gang members, still shaken by the ferocity they had witnessed, cautiously approached Meng Wei Zhi, only to find that he, too, had succumbed to his injuries. As they checked his pulse, they realized that the man who had just slaughtered a cultivator was now lifeless.

Under the pale moonlight, Li Zhi Ming, who had been watching from a distance, had already made three rounds of killing on the mountain, his actions a testament to the desperation that had taken hold of him.
