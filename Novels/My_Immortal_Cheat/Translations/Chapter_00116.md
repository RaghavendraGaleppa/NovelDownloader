# Chapter 116: The Path to Godhood

The atmosphere was silent for a while. The woman reluctantly managed a smile and said, "You two are the ones who escaped from Seiler City with the Ash God Child, aren't you?"

Zhou Tian looked at her with a hint of surprise. "How do you know?"

"The Ash Cult has always maintained contact with us, so we have some understanding of you two. But I didn't expect such a coincidence to meet you here," the woman explained. The feathered youth behind her shot a slightly displeased glance at his mother. Since she already knew their identities, why make him test them? Wasn't that intentionally trying to embarrass him? How could anyone who escaped from Seiler City be a simple character?

"They want to test us," Zhou Tian thought, deciding not to expose her true intentions. If they were in contact with the Ash Cult, there was no way they wouldn't know what they looked like.

"Then which god do you worship?" Zhou Tian asked. A cult that maintained ties with the Ash Cult was probably not a benevolent one.

"We are followers of the Spider Goddess," the woman stated flatly, her tone containing something other than reverence.

"The Spider Goddess is a pillar among the evil deities, with a very poor reputation. The Spider Cult is also an evil cult, so be careful," Mu Su whispered as he stepped forward. His chest wound had mostly healed by now, though his face was still pale. In his past, he belonged to the Holy God Cult and was intimately familiar with these evil factions, having even executed many of their members, which gave him a deep understanding.

Zhou Tian nodded, seeing clearly that the beautiful mother and son before him were certainly not benevolent.

"What exactly do you want from us?" Zhou Tian asked. Given the elaborate setup, it was unlikely she merely wanted to invite him as a guest, as she claimed.

"You must be heading to the Pantheon to seek a divine position to inherit, correct?"

Zhou Tian remained silent. Wasn't that obvious? Why else would they come to the perilous Mount Pantheon if not for the Pantheon itself? For sightseeing?

The woman didn't mind his silence and continued, "Do you know how many people and how many cults are currently rushing towards the Pantheon? Almost all high-ranking cult members are flocking to the Pantheon, including those who claim to be righteous. No one can resist the allure of becoming a god, not even the most devout believers. There are also Outerworlders wandering this area, many of whom want to get involved."

At this point, the woman cast a meaningful glance at Zhou Tian. Lower-ranking cult members like Mu Su might not know about the ancient wars, but not everyone was ignorant. Even if the details weren't entirely clear, some still knew a little. And she was one of those who knew some inside information, hence her understanding of Outerworlders.

Outerworlders, Zhou Tian mused silently. Since arriving in this land, he had rarely encountered people from Jiuzhou. Perhaps this region was remote, so not many were willing to come.

"Did the Spider Goddess fall in ancient times?" Zhou Tian suddenly asked.

The woman paused slightly. "Of course not. The Goddess is powerful; she did not perish in ancient times."

"Then you want to establish your own faction?"

"Establish our own faction?" The woman scoffed. "Do you mean inheriting a divine position to become a god yourself?"

Zhou Tian was puzzled, unsure why she was laughing. "Yes, why? Is there something wrong?"

"Do you think becoming a god is that simple? Inheriting a divine position is just the first step; it only means you have a stepping stone, not that you can actually become a god."

"The most important thing for becoming a god is spreading faith, requiring a sufficient number of believers. But look at this tiny land we are in now; even if everyone here combined, it wouldn't be enough to allow one person to become a god, even the most basic one. And there are Outerworlders lurking outside. Do you think it's possible for us to become gods?"

This woman was also a high-ranking member of the Spider Cult, possessing a vast amount of knowledge.

Zhou Tian and Mu Su exchanged glances. They hadn't realized there were so many intricacies involved; it seemed things were not as simple as they had imagined.

"Then why reopen the Pantheon and release so many divine positions?" Zhou Tian asked.

"The source of faith for the gods is ordinary mortals. So, what is the source of faith for the King of Gods?" The woman revealed a mysterious smile.

"The gods!" Mu Su blurted out, his eyes filled with shock. Zhou Tian's pupils also contracted. He had never considered this question: the King of Gods' believers were all other gods.

"Exactly. The reason for reopening the Pantheon and releasing numerous divine positions is to make the King of Gods' source of faith reappear."

"Then why are you telling us all this?" Zhou Tian narrowed his eyes slightly. This was a significant secret, possibly unknown even to many in Jiuzhou, yet this woman revealed it to them as easily as eating and drinking.

"I want to cooperate with you two to contend for enough divine positions."

Zhou Tian frowned, somewhat confused by her meaning. Hadn't she just said divine positions were useless? Why then contend for them, and with them?

The woman perceived Zhou Tian's confusion and explained proactively, "It is indeed difficult for ordinary people to become gods by obtaining a divine position. But what if a powerful deity obtains a divine position? This would greatly enhance their strength. I am contending for this on behalf of the Spider Goddess."

Zhou Tian's eyes flickered. This explanation was indeed somewhat acceptable, but the woman didn't seem like a devout believer at all.

"The King of Gods fell in ancient times, so now every living deity has the potential to become the King of Gods. The necessary conditions, however, are still unknown," the woman continued.

Heavenly Mandate! The answer instantly flashed in Zhou Tian's mind. Zhang Yi had told him that the most crucial element to becoming the King of Gods was the Heavenly Mandate.

So that's it, Zhou Tian now largely understood. The ancient deities' plan was to make the King of Gods reappear.

"Have you two considered it? Will you cooperate with us?" The woman revealed a charming smile, like a ripe peach.

"One last question: why choose us?"

"No, not you two. I chose you, Zhou Tian." The woman spoke Zhou Tian's name. This wasn't surprising; since they had ties with the Ash Cult, it wasn't hard for them to learn his name.

However, her statement was worth pondering deeply. Why choose Zhou Tian? What was it about Zhou Tian that made him worth choosing? There was only one answer: his identity.

"You had no choice before. Now you want to be a good person?"

The woman paused slightly.

Then Zhou Tian gave a confident smile. "Don't mind it too much. I hope we have a pleasant cooperation in the future."

"A pleasant cooperation!"
