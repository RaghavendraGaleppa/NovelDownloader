# Chapter 53: The Past of Poisoning! The True Culprit Behind It All!

The bright moon cast its glow, and stars dotted the sky.

The cold mountain night wind now felt warm.

The lingering scent of flames had yet to fully dissipate, but the residual sword intent still stung the face.

Li Zhengjing held the barely alive Lifebound Gu in his hand as he stepped forward.

At this moment, the unease in his heart finally settled.

Gu King Xin Xuan specialized in the Gu Path—all his abilities lay in his Gu insects!

With his Divine King Gu and half the Gu insects amassed from the Seventeen Tribes, Xin Xuan could command billions of venomous insects and pests, wielding power capable of annihilating an entire city.

"To the Great Zhou Imperial Court, the threat of your Gu poison is second only to the havoc wreaked by Earth Immortals. But in truth, you yourself aren’t all that powerful."

Li Zhengjing raised his blade and said calmly, "Someone like you can only lurk in the shadows. If you were to step into the light, stripped of your Gu insects, you’d be nothing more than an ordinary practitioner at the 'True Qi' realm!"

The Hanging Bird descended from the sky and perched on his shoulder, thinking to itself, *The master’s boasting has gotten worse. He’s only at the Internal Qi realm, yet he dares to call a True Qi realm cultivator 'ordinary'—and even adds 'nothing more' to it?*

*But then again, the master does possess a divine ability akin to my White Phoenix lineage, albeit an inferior imitation. Still, it’s quite formidable.*

*At any rate, since Gu King Xin Xuan has been captured, he can brag all he wants.*

The Hanging Bird glanced at Xin Xuan and mused, *This guy’s wounds are fatal—he’s definitely done for.*

At this moment, Gu King Xin Xuan had a gaping hole in his chest, his organs severely damaged, with a faint scent of roasted meat lingering in the air.

Yet, due to his high cultivation, a faint breath of life still clung to him.

He looked at Li Zhengjing, his eyes filled with indescribable complexity.

"Since I began cultivating the Gu Path, you are the first ordinary mortal to survive after being poisoned by my Gu."

"To remain unharmed after being infected by my Gu poison, and to cultivate for just over half a year yet possess such strength..."

"Is this the legendary Everlasting Sacred Body?"

Xin Xuan’s gaze grew distant as he sighed. "Truly worthy of its reputation..."

Li Zhengjing’s expression darkened as realization struck him. "Half a year ago, when you poisoned me, you were testing whether I had the Everlasting Sacred Body?"

A storm of shock surged within him. He knew that the reason Thousand Illusions Divine Lord had marked him as a potential vessel was precisely because of suspicions about his Everlasting Sacred Body!

But he had never met Thousand Illusions Divine Lord before—why would such a figure take notice of him?

*Could it be because I survived the Gu poison in the capital half a year ago without any antidote?*

*The root of this lies with Gu King Xin Xuan before me!*

*Half a year ago, he poisoned me to confirm whether I had the Everlasting Sacred Body?*

"Answer me!"

Li Zhengjing took a step forward, only to see Xin Xuan’s eyes grow vacant—his life extinguished.

The Gu King, revered as a deity in the Southern Wasteland, had fallen in this remote forest.

Li Zhengjing fell silent. The joy of slaying a great enemy now felt hollow.

"What a pathetic end..." The Hanging Bird looked at Xin Xuan’s corpse and sighed. "He didn’t die in the encirclement of forces in Four-Leaf City, nor did he fall to the Young Sect Master of Kunlun, hailed as the 'strongest in the True Qi realm.' Yet now, he dies at the hands of a nobody in this place. Had he known, he probably would’ve preferred to die in Four-Leaf City."

Already frustrated by Xin Xuan’s death cutting off any answers, Li Zhengjing grew even angrier at the bird’s words. He grabbed the Hanging Bird and punched it hard—only to yelp in pain as the bird’s draconic horn and spine spikes on its back wounded his hand.

Enraged, he flipped the bird over and punched its belly seventeen or eighteen times.

"Stop! Stop hitting me!" the Hanging Bird pleaded. "The Divine King Gu is about to die!"

Li Zhengjing finally relented and looked at the dying Divine King Gu, his frustration deepening.

Among the Gu insects of the Southern Wasteland, the Divine King Gu was one of the Ten Heavenly Gu!

It had been refined by Xin Xuan into his Lifebound Gu—their fates intertwined. With Xin Xuan dead, the Divine King Gu would inevitably perish as well.

"You claim to be knowledgeable, well-read—can this Divine King Gu be saved?" Li Zhengjing asked.

The Hanging Bird shook its head. "When a Gu cultivator dies, their Lifebound Gu dies with them. And if the Lifebound Gu dies first, the cultivator perishes as well. It’s an immutable law. Though I’ve read extensively, I’ve never heard of any exceptions."

Li Zhengjing couldn’t hide his disappointment.

To others, this Gu was a deadly, cursed thing!

But for him, Gu poison was beneficial—it could be refined by the golden page into pure spiritual energy, fueling his cultivation!

If such an extraordinary Gu could be preserved, how many spirit stones would it save him in the future?

"Master... I have a way!"

At that moment, a half-buried tree stump in the distance suddenly uprooted itself, revealing an earthen jar beneath it. Hundreds of roots acted as legs as it scurried over.

Li Zhengjing’s eyes lit up. "You have a solution?"

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches excitedly. "When I was just a sapling, I actually grew in the Southern Wasteland. Later, I was discovered and brought to the Central Plains..."

"My first master was beaten to death, then I got a second master—he was also beaten to death..."

"After going through twelve masters in total, I ended up with the previous sect master of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect."

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches proudly, reminiscing about its past glories.

Until the Hanging Bird gasped.

"You’re a master-killer?"

"......"

The Five Elements Creation Tree froze, its voice cutting off abruptly.

Li Zhengjing silently glanced at the golden page in his mind, reassured that with such a "life mentor," he wouldn’t be "killed off" by the tree. He sighed in relief and said, "Don’t worry. My fate is strong. As they say, good men die young, but troublemakers live a thousand years. I—"

He coughed. "I’m a proper man, but I’ll definitely live as long as the heavens. Enough digressions—tell me about the Divine King Gu."

"Master is wise!" The Five Elements Creation Tree hurriedly explained, "Once the Gu King dies, the Divine King Gu is doomed. However... before its death, the Divine King Gu often gathers its remaining strength to produce an egg!"

"Right now, its vitality is nearly exhausted, but if you store it in a treasure, you can preserve its last flicker of life. Once we return to the sect, we can use rare materials to sustain it!"

"That way, it can borrow the energy of those materials to birth a larva!"

It waved its branches. "The larva can then be refined and become your Gu!"

Li Zhengjing nodded thoughtfully. "That’s not a bad idea. But where do we find such a treasure?"

He didn’t care whether he could control the Gu—he only needed its poison for cultivation. Whether he could command it was irrelevant.

"Gu King Xin Xuan’s belongings must have something suitable!"

The Hanging Bird immediately took flight and stripped Xin Xuan’s corpse clean.

Xin Xuan no longer had any Gu insects on him—whether those he had refined himself or those he had plundered from the Seventeen Tribes. They had all been expended in the Great Zhou capital, Jingye Prefecture, Tianyuan Prefecture, and earlier in Four-Leaf City.

However, Xin Xuan did possess a special wooden box for storing Gu insects.

Inside the box were a Gu-refining manual, a body-tempering technique, seven medicinal herbs, and over a dozen bottles of unknown powders.

Most importantly, there were thirty-two graded spirit stones!

Li Zhengjing’s eyes shone brighter than the stars above.

"We’ve struck it rich!"

He murmured in disbelief.
