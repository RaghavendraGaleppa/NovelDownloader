**Name:** Li Zhengjing  
**Age:** 17  
**Cultivation:** Eighth Layer of Inner Qi  
**Techniques:**  
- Tiger-Leopard Thunder Sound Prison Suppression Art  
- Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi  
- Sword Nurturing Technique

**Surface Identity:** Inner Disciple of the Ancient Moon Peak, Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.  
**True Identity:** Second Son of Marquis Jian'an.  
**Hidden Identity:** The third reserve body of the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.  

**Fortune:**  
While cultivating the *Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi*, upon breaking through to the True Qi realm, the sword qi's sharpness becomes overwhelming, piercing through the body, leaving it riddled with holes, intestines ruptured, and face unrecognizable!  
Afterward, the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord, enraged, dismembers the body, grinds the bones to dust, leaving no corpse intact!  

"Seven days ago, after meeting that so-called 'Elder Gu,' my ranking rose again, becoming the third reserve body!"  

"Previously, the golden book page's fortune indicated that after I reached the peak of Inner Qi without dying from the backlash of the *Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi*, I would be promoted to third place!"  

"Now, while still at the eighth layer of Inner Qi, I've already been prematurely designated as the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord's third reserve body!"  

"Is it because I openly admitted that the Gu poison had no effect on me, proving my immunity to all evil, making him even more certain that I possess the *Ten Thousand Ages Evergreen Saint Body*?"  

Li Zhengjing pondered this, exhaling softly as he glanced at the Five Elements Creation Tree beside him.  

Lately, he hadn't harvested its branches to brew Five Elements Creation Paste. Under the nourishment of the Profound Breath Crimson Soil and the Spiritual Essence Heavenly Dew, the tree had regrown five tender branches.  

Moreover, in recent days, he hadn't used the Five Elements Creation Paste for cultivation, nor had he consumed the Creation Five Mysteries Pill bestowed by the Ancient Moon Peak's Chief.  

Previously, he occasionally used the golden book page to refine spirit stones, absorbing their spiritual energy to enhance his internal qi. But now, he was even conserving spirit stones.  

Yet, despite this, under the Five Elements Creation Tree's ability to gather spiritual energy from the world, his cultivation progress remained rapid.  

Had he not deliberately restrained himself, he would have already reached the peak of Inner Qi.  

"With my current progress, the Creation Five Mysteries Pill, and over a dozen graded spirit stones in hand, I could break through to the peak of Inner Qi anytime I wish!"  

"But once I reach the peak of Inner Qi, I can't casually advance to the True Qi realm—otherwise, I'll die from the backlash of the *Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi*!"  

"Yet, if I linger too long at the peak of Inner Qi, the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord will grow suspicious."  

Li Zhengjing sighed inwardly, muttering to himself, "Cultivation can't progress too quickly, after all."  

"Master?"  

The wall-perching bird hesitated before asking, "Do you even hear what you're saying?"  

Li Zhengjing glanced at it, his expression unchanged.  

The bird couldn't help but grumble, "Do you know how many Inner Qi cultivators struggle at every step of their journey? Take that dead fool Chen Youyu—he spent his whole life stuck at the upper levels of Inner Qi. By the time he turned sixty, his name was struck from the roster of inner disciples..."  

It hung its head dejectedly, muttering, "These past few days, I've been cultivating day and night, relying on that jug of spirit wine to barely break through the final barrier, awakening all my bloodline power to match the peak of Inner Qi! And here you are, saying things like that—aren't you afraid of breaking this bird's heart?"  

Li Zhengjing coughed lightly. "What I meant was, the path of cultivation requires a solid foundation. One must build steadily, not rush recklessly like a castle in the air!"  

With that, he beckoned. "Little Tree, has the Gu insect egg hatched yet?"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree, its roots planted in a clay pot, extended two root tendrils to scurry over like stubby legs, its plump base waddling comically.  

"Master, the Gu egg hasn't hatched yet. The main issue is that the Divine King Gu Mother Insect is dead. The skewers you had for supper last night were made from it."  

The tree hurriedly added, "If the mother insect had survived laying the egg, even barely, it would've hatched the egg itself. But it was too severely injured—it nearly failed to lay the egg at all..."  

Li Zhengjing stroked his chin. "So without the mother insect, hatching it will be difficult?"  

The tree waved its five branches—like five hands shaking in denial—and said, "Not necessarily! I have a way!"  

One branch pointed at its "rear." "I've buried the egg in the Profound Breath Crimson Soil, letting it absorb the Spiritual Essence Heavenly Dew. Plus, my roots can provide Five Elements spiritual energy. It'll still hatch, just a few days slower than if its mother had done it."  

Li Zhengjing sighed in relief. "Good. Keep at it."  

The tree waved its branches enthusiastically. "Don't worry, Master! I'll hatch it for sure!"  

Li Zhengjing nodded approvingly, then turned to the wall-perching bird—his expression instantly blank. "Hatching eggs is supposed to be a bird's job. Since the tree is doing it for you, shouldn't you focus on cultivation? Strive to become a True Qi realm demon and restore the glory of the White Phoenix Divine Bird?"  

The bird drooped its head, grumbling inwardly, *"What does a White Phoenix Divine Bird have to do with me? What glory is there to restore?"*  

*"How is this 'helping me hatch eggs'? Isn't this Gu insect yours?"*  

*"Besides, I'm a male bird—what do I know about hatching eggs?"*  

Just as it was stewing in resentment, the Five Elements Creation Tree piped up in a mocking tone.  

"Master, let's cut it some slack. After all, none of the seven nests of chicks in its family were hatched by it—nor were they sired by it, for that matter."  

"Stupid tree! I'll fight you!"  

"Who's scared of you? Bring it—ah! Mercy, Master! I was wrong—ahh!"  

The courtyard erupted into chaos—flapping wings, rustling leaves, and indignant squawking—reminding Li Zhengjing of the quiet days when the yellow dog was still around.  

*I wonder how it's doing at the Beast Taming Hall. Does it miss me?*  

*If it becomes a demon in the future, maybe it'll remember its old master and send me some spirit stones now and then.*  

With that thought, he returned to his room and retrieved the fragmented jade artifact left behind by Yuan Zhengfeng.  

He fell silent. Earlier, he had speculated that Yuan Zhengfeng's soul might be hidden within it, but the golden book page required three graded spirit stones to reveal detailed information.  

At the time, he only had the two spirit stones Yuan Zhengfeng had left him, so he had set the matter aside.  

But after slaying the Gu King Xin Xuan, he had acquired many spirit stones. Though some were used for the Parasol Wood Gu Box and others to uncover details about "Elder Gu," he still had over a dozen left.  

After a moment's hesitation, he took out two spirit stones and swallowed them.  

Thanks to his recent progress to the eighth layer of Inner Qi, he could now save one spirit stone!  

As soon as he consumed the stones, their spiritual energy—along with his own inner qi—poured into the golden book page.  

In an instant, Li Zhengjing felt drained, his face paling, but his mind focused intently on the golden book page.  

**Yuan Zhengfeng, 85 years old.**  

**Identity:** Formerly the sixth reserve body of the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord.  

**Cultivation:** Initial Human Immortal realm!  

**Fortune:**  
- In his youth, his talent was unparalleled. After reaching the peak of Inner Qi, he obtained a "divine artifact" and realized something amiss within himself.  
- He began concealing his abilities, slacking in cultivation, gradually becoming mediocre—just another face in the crowd.  
- Upon reaching the upper levels of True Qi, he grew increasingly uneasy, sensing impending danger. Under false pretenses, he left the mountain to wander the world, eventually secluding himself in the Southern Wastelands.  
- After reaching the peak of True Qi and completing his Heavenly Cycle, he realized he couldn't escape his fate. Fleeing to the northern Fengdu Mountain, he obtained a serendipitous opportunity and ascended to the Human Immortal realm!  
- Thereafter, using the *Netherworld Heavenly Gate Soul-Hiding Technique*, he encased his soul in the "divine artifact" with his magic power.  
- Thus, his soul endured while his body withered, existing between life and death!  

**Method to Alter Fate:**  
...Insufficient spiritual energy!  
Please provide twelve graded spirit stones!
