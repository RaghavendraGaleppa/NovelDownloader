# Chapter 8: Troubles Left by the Predecessor  

The woman was named Luo Yukuo. Dressed in black training attire with an oval face, she had decent looks and a good figure, though her slightly thicker legs weren't the type Qin Ziling usually favored.  

Strangely enough, the original owner of this body had a preference for women with wide hips and sturdy legs—the kind considered ideal for childbearing. At first glance, Qin Ziling had been utterly smitten, developing feelings for her and frequently seeking her out for conversation.  

With his chiseled features, sharp eyebrows, and starry eyes, Qin Ziling was undeniably handsome. Having come from a moderately well-off family in his youth, he had received some education, making his speech and demeanor stand out among his peers at the martial arts school. His proactive attentiveness, coupled with Luo Yukuo being new to the school and lacking friends at the time, naturally led her to develop a favorable impression of him. Soon, the two began interacting privately.  

Later, Nangong Yue also joined the school to train in martial arts.  

He, too, took a liking to Luo Yukuo at first sight.  

Though Nangong Yue’s family wasn’t among the prestigious clans of the prefecture, they were undoubtedly wealthy, owning multiple shops in the city and a hundred or so acres of fertile land outside its walls.  

Blessed with both resources and talent, Nangong Yue progressed rapidly in his training. Within just four months, he had reached the Oxhide level of the Skin Membrane realm, where he could seal his blood energy within his skin membrane, refining and tempering it day and night. His aptitude earned him the favor of Zuo Le, who believed he had the potential to break through to the Strength realm.  

Qin Ziling, on the other hand, lacked martial talent. Despite nearly three years of training, he hadn’t even touched the threshold of the Skin Membrane realm. His modest family background left him with little more than his handsome appearance. Luo Yukuo had never truly been serious about him—she merely enjoyed the attention and admiration. Their relationship had always been casual at best.  

Later, when Luo Yukuo also broke through to the Skin Membrane realm and became an inner disciple, Nangong Yue’s involvement gradually pushed her away from Qin Ziling. She began spending more time with Nangong Yue instead.  

After all, Nangong Yue came from a wealthy family, possessed exceptional martial talent, and had the potential to reach the Strength realm—a status that would make him a notable figure even in the entire prefecture.  

Moreover, Luo Yukuo’s own family was well-off, and though her martial talent couldn’t compare to Nangong Yue’s, it was still above average. With ample access to meat and medicinal supplements, along with diligent training, she had broken through to the Skin Membrane realm in just a year.  

The two could be considered peers in terms of social standing.  

Though Qin Ziling felt a pang of bitterness watching Luo Yukuo distance herself from him and grow closer to Nangong Yue, he had enough self-awareness not to cling to her. Still, he couldn’t help stealing glances at her in private.  

But while Qin Ziling knew his place, Nangong Yue was a petty and narrow-minded man. Aware of Qin Ziling’s past closeness with Luo Yukuo, he took every opportunity to harass him in private. Now that he had reached the Skin Membrane realm and enjoyed Zuo Le’s favor, he frequently used sparring as an excuse to humiliate and beat Qin Ziling.  

---  

Ten days ago, Qin Ziling had been injured by Nangong Yue, leaving his body weak. It was then that the remnant soul of Li Mo seized the opportunity, nearly succeeding in possessing him.  

Of course, the current Qin Ziling was now an entirely different person.  

To him, Luo Yukuo was no beauty—just a source of trouble.  

But there was nothing he could do. The mess left by his predecessor was now his to clean up.

"You’ve got about two months left before your three-year mark, right?" Liu Xiaoqiang remarked. "The master said that if you can’t reach the Skin Membrane realm in three years, it means you lack martial talent. Continuing would be pointless—unless you’re willing to pay double the tuition. When you didn’t show up yesterday, I thought you’d finally given up. But here you are again today. Seems you still can’t let go of that woman. What’s the point? Just to endure two more months of Nangong Yue’s bullying?"  

"I’ve long since cut ties with Luo Yukuo," Qin Ziling replied. "I’m staying to train."  

"Ziling, it’s useless. I’ve come to realize that martial arts isn’t just about talent or hard work—it’s about resources. I’m naturally strong and train diligently, but what does it matter? After every grueling session, I barely have enough to eat, let alone meat or medicinal supplements to replenish my blood energy. How can my blood energy grow strong enough? The master said that skin and hair are extensions of blood energy. If your blood energy isn’t abundant enough to overflow, how can you even reach the Skin Membrane realm? And without breaking through to that realm, how can you refine and comprehend true strength? Without strength, you’ll always just be a martial disciple—someone to be ordered around, toiling away your whole life without ever rising above mediocrity."  

"But look at those wealthy young masters. Most of them spend their days indulging in pleasure, yet many still reach the Skin Membrane realm. Sure, some are naturally gifted, but I refuse to believe they all are. Most just rely on constant meat and medicinal supplements!"  

"So, Ziling, what’s the point of staying two more months? You’d be better off finding a job to support yourself. You’re educated, quick-witted, and trained in martial arts. Rumor has it your ancestors came from a prominent family—many employers would gladly hire you. Not like me. Aside from brute strength, I’ve got nothing else to offer. That’s why I’ve already signed up for the martial arena. I’ll be fighting soon, so I’m staying to train—not to break through to the Skin Membrane realm, but just to sharpen my skills a little more."

The foundational stages of martial arts were divided into training the muscles and training the skin membrane, collectively known as the Blood Energy realm.  

Anyone with enough endurance could develop muscles tougher than an average person’s—though strength levels varied. But breaking through to the Skin Membrane realm was far more difficult, requiring not just talent and rigorous training but also specialized techniques, medicinal formulas, and ample resources.  

Both the Muscle and Skin Membrane realms were considered stages of a martial disciple (武徒). While their strength differed in degree, it hadn’t yet undergone a qualitative transformation.  

However, once one sealed their blood energy within their skin membrane and refined it day and night to cultivate true strength (劲力), their power would undergo a fundamental change.  

Those who achieved this were called martial masters (武师). Even if their raw power wasn’t overwhelming, the qualitative difference allowed them to effortlessly defeat martial disciples with far greater brute strength.  

In the prefecture, martial masters were considered formidable fighters, highly sought after by noble families and powerful factions. They never lacked opportunities—some even established their own schools or recruited retainers, forming independent forces.  

Zuo Le, for instance, possessed the techniques and secret formulas for cultivating Cold Iron Palm strength. Unwilling to serve under others, he chose to open his own school, establishing himself as an independent force navigating the prefecture’s power struggles.  

But for martial disciples, finding a good path forward—whether a reputable employer or decent wages—was far harder. They had to prove their worth through displays of strength to attract high-paying offers.  

The most direct and efficient way to showcase their abilities was by competing in the prefecture’s martial arena.  

Not only did arena combat provide substantial earnings, but a single victory could also draw the attention of various factions vying for their services.  

Of course, arena battles were nothing like schoolyard sparring. Competitors fought for fame, for a brighter future—and with gambling stakes involved, the matches were intense, even brutal.  

Only those confident in their abilities or desperate for money dared take this path.
