# Chapter 547: Startling News of a Spirit Treasure

Pu Yu was instantly drenched.

It was out of sheer terror.

“...”

The Divine Thunder Peak returned to its usual tranquility, with only muffled thunderclaps echoing intermittently from deep within the mountain's core.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged, beginning to refine the pure Primordial Qi he had harvested over the past few days.

The *True Sutra of Heaven-Earth Exchange, Yin-Yang Separation and Union* brought by Liu Yunhua had been recorded in his panel, holding great potential for the future.

He reached into his spatial bag and pulled out an ancient scroll.

This scroll was naturally plundered from Liu Yunhua's spatial bag. After the mental damage he suffered these past few days, he naturally needed a good amount of spiritual materials and resources as compensation.

Within this ancient scroll was recorded the Spirit Treasure for proving the Dao and attaining his position, refined by the Nine-Chambered Lord of Divine Thunder.

The Divine Thunder Sword.

Xu Yunfan's expression was calm. Regardless of whether it was true or false, he would not be exploring it for now.

What he needed to do now was spend a great deal of time stabilizing his Small World, then raise his Purple Mansion from his Dantian Qi Sea to connect with the heavens.

This would allow him to step into the late Foundation Establishment realm. Once his momentum is formed, the position of Great True Person is within reach.

As for the so-called news regarding the Lord of Divine Thunder's Spirit Treasure, he had taken note of it, but now was not the time to investigate.

Furthermore, right after he switched to cultivating the *Nine-Chambered Divine Thunder, Celestial Vault Indestructible Sutra*, someone was eagerly sending him treasures?

It didn't take much thought to realize this was clearly a fishing lure.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but curse a few words inwardly.

*These bastards.*

He had no idea what they were after, setting up hooks everywhere.

Moreover, with an unstable foundation, everything else was empty talk.

He needed time to沉淀 (settle), to polish his Small World prototype to perfection, and to further condense his own magical power.

His aura completely settled down, like an ancient, deep pool.

Several days later.

Hundred Desires Peak.

Liu Yunhua's figure was slightly unsteady, each step exceptionally difficult.

She forced her body and soul, which had been ridden to the brink of collapse by Xu Yunfan, to return to her palace deep within Hundred Desires Peak.

The magnificent palace was filled with a faint, elegant fragrance, starkly contrasting with the aura of decay she now carried.

She did not return to her jade bed to heal her injuries. Instead, enduring the weakness and pain that seeped into her very bones, she walked heavily towards a meditation room deep within the palace, shrouded in layers of restrictions and silk curtains.

Two female cultivators with considerable auras stood guard outside. Seeing Liu Yunhua in such a state, their faces paled in shock, and they hurriedly stepped forward to support her, only to be stopped by Liu Yunhua's terrifying gaze.

She pushed open the heavy jade door of the meditation room alone with great effort and stepped inside.

The room was dimly lit, and the spiritual energy was so dense it seemed to liquefy. A figure stood with its back to the entrance by the window, seemingly gazing at the swirling clouds below Hundred Desires Peak.

"Senior Brother..."

Liu Yunhua's breath was weak, her voice as faint as a mosquito's buzz, carrying an indescribable exhaustion.

She could no longer support her feeble body and "thumped" to her knees directly behind the man, her forehead touching the ground.

"I... have completed it..."

She used her last ounce of strength to speak respectfully, her voice carrying a hint of relief, but more so, endless resentment and grievance.

This "completion" had come at the cost of her own cultivation being hindered, her Cauldron being snatched, and even her hope for this lifetime being lost...

Dead silence filled the meditation room.

A moment later, the figure with his back to her slowly turned around.

The man had handsome features, but his gaze was as deep as an abyss. His aura was perfectly whole and flawless, yet carried a faint, heart-palpitating pressure. His aura clearly marked him as a Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment.

He was none other than the current Sect Master of the Primordial Origin Sect, Heavenly Calculation True Person.

His gaze fell on Liu Yunhua, who was withered in appearance, kneeling on the ground, and her aura in extreme decline. He did not speak immediately.

The silence lasted for several breaths, the air seeming to solidify.

Liu Yunhua's body trembled slightly, whether from fear or pain.

"You have worked hard."

Heavenly Calculation True Person finally spoke, his voice calm and low, betraying no emotion.

He gently raised his hand, and a gentle, thick, yet vast and mighty magical power surged out, like a warm spring, instantly enveloping Liu Yunhua's shattered body.

This magical power carried a strange vitality and nourishing force; it was not for healing, but more like forcibly sustaining her last breath of life, stabilizing the ruins of her Dao Foundation that were on the verge of complete collapse, so she would not immediately burn out.

At the same time, a drop of pure spiritual liquid appeared out of thin air before Liu Yunhua.

"Take this drop of Jade Marrow to stabilize your foundation. I will not forget the grievance you have suffered. We are all acting for the Lord, and some matters require us to personally enter the fray."

His tone was placating, comforting the thoroughly tormented Liu Yunhua.

There was no concern for her well-being, nor any blame for her failure. His tone and demeanor held only a lofty sense of control and a placation of a pawn.

It was as if he viewed all things as straw dogs.

Liu Yunhua knew this was her only lifeline and dared not hesitate. She艰难地 (laboriously) picked up the drop of Jade Marrow radiating with a treasure-like luster and greedily swallowed it.

A massive spiritual energy dispersed, nourishing her depleted meridians and temporarily halting the spread of the terrifying weakness, but it was merely enough to keep her alive.

To restore her former glory would be as difficult as climbing to the sky.

Heavenly Calculation True Person withdrew his hand, his gaze seeming to pierce through the palace walls to look towards the distant Divine Thunder Peak. A flicker of inscrutable light passed through his deep eyes, followed by a hint of a smile as he said indifferently,

"Alright, go down and properly heal your injuries. This test has yielded some results.

Xu Yunfan... no, we should call him Sect Master Xu now. This person is indeed gifted, his foundation deeper and more solid than anticipated. To be able to so easily suppress you..."

His voice seemed to carry a hint of amusement. "He obtained part of the true meaning of the *True Sutra of Heaven-Earth Exchange, Yin-Yang Separation and Union*, and even harvested the foundation of a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator...

Heh, I'm curious to see if Xu Yunfan, after taking this sutra and that elusive clue, will be able to hold onto them in the next step."

His tone was half-question, half-answer, filled with a composure that suggested everything was under control and a cold calculation.

It was clear that Liu Yunhua's crushing defeat and Xu Yunfan's dominance were within his expectations, and might even be a part of his plan.

Divine Thunder Peak.

Xu Yunfan finished a cycle of his cultivation and slowly opened his eyes.

Divine Thunder transformed into magical power, surging and flowing through his body, as if it were endless.

The prototype of his Small World floated within his Sea of Consciousness, absorbing the vast Primordial Qi and becoming a fraction more solid.

The accumulation of most of Liu Yunhua's life's Yin essence, combined with his initial comprehension of the *True Sutra of Heaven-Earth Exchange, Yin-Yang Separation and Union*, allowed his cultivation to take a great leap forward.

Mainly, with the advantage of viewing things from a higher perspective, plus the support of his Attribute Panel and the Pu Yu trinket, his speed in cultivating this sutra was very fast.

He was unaware of the waves stirred up in the outside world by this conflict.

He did not know the situation after Liu Yunhua returned to Hundred Desires Peak.

Nor did he know if the news of the Lord of Divine Thunder's legacy treasure had spread.

He knew none of this, nor did he want to for the time being.

After cultivating the Sutra of Yin-Yang Separation and Union, Pu Yu lay prostrate in a corner of the cave dwelling on her own, like an exquisite jade statue, her eyes dull and fearful, as if she had already resigned herself to her fate.

Xu Yunfan paid her no mind. His spiritual sense probed into his body, perceiving and comprehending the Yin-Yang principles while drawing in the vital energy that was forcefully exchanged with the heavens.
