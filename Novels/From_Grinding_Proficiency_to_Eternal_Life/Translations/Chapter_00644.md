# Chapter 644: Harvesting Golden Nature

The battlefield's center saw Lockman and Buthes clash directly.

With a wave of Lockman's hand, ten thousand miles froze over. The寒气 of absolute zero froze heaven and earth, and countless ice spears, like giant javelins, stabbed toward Buthes.

A wave of helplessness washed over him, but since he had already made his move, he held nothing back. He was keenly aware of the situation.

Xu Yunfan's strength far exceeded his imagination. When they first met, the man had picked him up with one hand and asked if he wanted to live or die.

Heaven have mercy, who wants to die?

If he hadn't identified the other as an Outer Realm Demon, Xu Yunfan's power had once made him suspect the man was an ancient god awakened from some forgotten corner of the world.

For a High God to willingly hide his strength and lurk as a Mid God, he must be plotting something grand.

But for the sake of survival, Lockman had no choice.

At that moment, Buthes transformed into an intangible gale, weaving through the gaps between the ice spears. With a raise of his hand, he summoned a hurricane that tore the earth asunder, shredding the frozen frost bit by bit.

Every collision triggered celestial phenomena. Shards of ice and wind blades rained down like an apocalyptic storm, causing the surrounding mountain ranges to tremble violently.

The battle between two High Gods was a confrontation on the level of divine authority and laws bestowed by the Heavenly Dao. It was a clash of divine realms, a standoff of faith and prayer. A mere Mid God who got too close would be instantly gravely wounded or even annihilated by the shockwaves.

The battlefield below was even more brutal.

The Ice Giants and Wind Elemental Spirits summoned by the two High Gods tore into each other, ice spikes and wind blades flying everywhere.

Barbarian warriors, blessed by the gods they worshipped, fought with reckless abandon. Frost froze flesh, and gales tore limbs apart.

Mid and Low Gods belonging to the two factions also engaged in fierce duels, their divine powers clashing and their authorities colliding.

The Wolf God of the Ice Plains, Lokan, was among them. The depression in his chest, granted by Buthes's divine wind power, had mostly healed. He was ferociously pouncing upon a Mid God of the Winter faction who controlled a Frost Serpent. Ice claws and fangs tore at each other, sending ice shards and a rain of blood into the air, revealing his savage nature.

As for Xu Yunfan, with Lockman providing cover, he did not reveal himself. Instead, he lurked in the shadows like a ghost, concealed by the Threefold Karma Secret Technique and shielded by the Star Spirit Banner, silently drawing near the fray where Lokan was embroiled.

With multiple secret techniques masking his presence, Xu Yunfan naturally intended to achieve the greatest result with the least effort.

His gaze fell upon Lokan, his eyes calm.

He patiently waited for his chance.

At the edge of the battlefield, Zhang Ziyang, using his侦查 divine ability, continuously relayed information to him.

He precisely predicted the brief gaps in Lokan's divine power circulation after every爆发.

The opportunity arrived. Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed.

Lokan had just used a fierce Ice Explosion to tear through the Frost Serpent's domain, forcing the Mid God back several steps. Inevitably, a minuscule stagnation occurred in the circulation of his divine power.

It was in that fleeting instant, between the exhaustion of his old strength and the generation of new power.

Xu Yunfan's figure appeared without warning above Lokan's massive wolf head.

The disguise fell away. A three-zhang tall Martial Dao Golden Body法相 suddenly manifested, surrounded by rolling thunder.

The main head glared with fury, all six arms spread wide. The terrifying suppression force of the North Pole Purple Micro Demon-Suppressing Primordial Qi descended like an invisible mountain accompanied by thunderous roars.

Until now, he had been cautious with the methods of the Divine霄 Thunder, as they were fundamentally different from this world's Heavenly Dao. If he used them too much and was discovered, the consequences would be severe.

Although the Primordial Origin Sect had a proficient set of countermeasures, it was best not to be discovered at all.

Using the authority of the Thunder鸣 Divine Core to amplify his power was the optimal method.

"Roar?!"

Lokan's ice-blue vertical pupils shrank to pinpricks. Boundless fear and despair instantly overwhelmed him.

This power!

It's that golden-armored monster. Tatus is a fake!

He wanted to roar, to warn his High God, Buthes.

But the invisible suppression force had locked down his divine body, his divine power, and even his divine soul.

He couldn't even turn a single thought.

He could only watch helplessly as that hand, wreathed in purple-gold thunder patterns,带着 a terrifying aura that could pierce through anything, pressed precisely against the upper edge of his wolf maw, which had been slightly agape in shock—right on his glabella.

The Inscription of Piercing the Nether and Corroding the Heavens.

Soul Capture.

The tip of Xu Yunfan's finger flashed with dark light.

Countless twisted Karma Corroding Heaven Talismans instantly pierced into Lokan's glabella, ignoring his tough fur and skull, and stabbing directly into the core of his divine core.

Simultaneously, the Star Spirit Banner in his sleeve shone with a dark light, its surface unfurling into a black hole that devoured everything.

*Crack!*

A muffled shattering sound rang out.

Lokan's massive body stiffened abruptly. The light in his ice-blue vertical pupils vanished instantly, leaving them hollow and grey.

The Storm Mark on his glabella, representing his subordinate contract with the Storm God System, suddenly dimmed and shattered.

That divine core, interwoven with ice-blue and verdant light and symbolizing the authority of the Wolf God of the Ice Plains, was forcibly torn from the origin of his divine soul by the Corroding Heaven Talismans.

The next instant, the dark light of the Star Spirit Banner swept over Lokan's body like a tidal wave.

The wolf god's body, now devoid of its divine core, crumbled bit by bit like a sand sculpture eroded by the wind, turning into a sky full of ice crystals and flying ash. Together with the severed soul that had been剥离 and was still struggling, it was devoured in one gulp by the Star Spirit Banner.

On the banner's surface, a star point with the outline of an ice wolf suddenly lit up, then merged into the trajectory of the周天星斗.

The entire process was as fast as lightning. Hidden by the chaotic energy洪流 and blinding light of the battlefield, it went almost unnoticed.

'Successfully refined the residual soul of the Mid God Lokan into a Banner Spirit. The origin of the Star Spirit Banner has improved. The周天星斗 Great Array (46/365).'

Xu Yunfan quickly glanced at the information提示 that had popped up in his field of vision.

It seemed that the recent days of refining the Star Spirit Banner had been quite effective. After getting used to the nature of faith and prayer and the characteristics of the divine cores of weak gods he had captured before, it was now quite proficient in the一条龙 process of devouring and enlightening.

However, the celestial phenomenon of a god's death in the mortal realm could not be completely concealed.

"Awuuu!"

A mournful howl, filled with endless sorrow, anger, and terror, echoed through the heavens and earth. It exploded in the hearts of every god belonging to the Storm God System and even some of the Winter System.

The many gods of the Storm God System sensed the disappearance of the Wolf God of the Ice Plains, Lokan, from their divine network.

It was the final哀嚎 transmitted through the Aetira World's divine system network when Lokan's divine core shattered and his divine soul was completely抹去.

It represented the permanent and utter demise of a powerful Mid God.

The entire chaotic battlefield, at this moment, strangely froze for an instant.

Whether it was the Wind Elemental Spirit fighting the Ice Giant, the Winter Knights charging on crystal chariots, or the Mid and Low Gods locked in combat, their movements all paused for a刹那.

In the hearts of all the gods, they clearly heard that悲鸣 representing a god's陨落 and felt the印記 of annihilation originating from the level of divine laws.

The authority of the Wolf God Lokan had returned to the天地.

Buthes was in the process of凝聚 a Spear of the Hurricane that could tear the sky apart to刺向 Lockman. Sensing the complete disappearance of Lokan's mark, his movement suddenly halted, and his eyes第一次 revealed a look of utter horror.
