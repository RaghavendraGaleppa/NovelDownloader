# Chapter 481: All Are on the Path of Righteousness!

The voice from behind made Xu Yunfan’s eyes narrow slightly. Suppressing his magical power, his spiritual sense instantly swept over the person behind him. He turned around silently to face the source of the voice.

The newcomer was a monk.

He wore a coarse hemp cassock that had been washed white, with clear traces of dye, yet it was spotless. His face was ancient-looking and not young; the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes were as if carved by a knife. Yet, an indescribable clarity and tranquility flowed between his brows, like precipitated glass from snow-capped mountains that had melted and settled for ten thousand years.

His brow ridge was raised, forming a natural arc of compassion. Under his lowered eyelids, his gaze was gentle and calm, like two unfathomable pools of water that could reflect the human heart and cleanse the dust of the mortal world.

Even standing there in silence, a transcendent Zen meaning that pitied all living beings and saw through the ways of the world naturally emanated from him, making one subconsciously suppress their impetuous thoughts.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows, somewhat surprised.

"I've seen you before."

A smile appeared on the middle-aged man's face.

"Oh? It seems the Benefactor and I truly have a karmic connection."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. "When I was inspecting Cold Crow Pass some days ago, I clearly saw you setting up a stall at a street corner, selling counterfeit artifacts to swindle passersby."

The monk's smile froze slightly as he clasped his hands together. "Amitabha. The Benefactor's words are mistaken. Karma arises and ceases; everything has its destiny. For someone to take an item from this humble monk is simply the karma sown in a previous life and resolved in this one. Those items may seem like ordinary goods, but they contain the Buddha-nature within. When they meet the right person, their miraculous use will naturally manifest."

Damn it, this is exactly the kind of talk those bald donkeys from the Puchan Pure Land would spout. It's simply shameless; saying such things without a hint of embarrassment.

Those bald donkeys from the Puchan Pure Land.

Xu Yunfan felt a heavy weight in his heart. It was certainly not a good sign for a bald donkey from the Puchan Pure Land to come looking for him.

A sense of警兆 (alertness) arose instantly within him. The True Martial power within his body flowed silently. The True Martial Sword was held back, ready to strike, while the intent to banish demons and slay evil gathered at his fingertips, waiting to move.

He had never had deep dealings with people from the Western Continent's Puchan Pure Land. The only connection was that he had "outlasted" the Fulong Arhat outside Cold Crow Pass. That was also a chance occurrence, not a deliberate killing on his part.

To be honest, he had only driven the other party away. Whether the Arhat lived or died outside Cold Crow Pass had nothing to do with him.

This monk's aura was as calm as the sea, making it impossible for Xu Yunfan to gauge his depth for a moment. He was certainly no ordinary person.

Why had he come looking for him?

Was it to seek revenge for the matter of the Fulong Arhat?

But that Arhat had clearly exhausted his lifespan and passed away, thus reincarnating...

It absolutely couldn't be because of that.

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Xu Yunfan remained expressionless on the surface. He cupped his hands and said indifferently, "Master, you called me to a stop. I wonder what advice you have to offer?"

The monk, who called himself Sanzang, clasped his hands in greeting. His voice remained mellow and calm, yet carried an irresistible penetrating power. "Amitabha. Good, good. Advice is too bold a word. This humble monk is named Sanzang. I observe that the Benefactor's divine light is contained within, your bones are like jade, you hide a sword between your brows, and your heart possesses the intent to subdue demons. You have a great karmic connection with my Buddhist sect. I cannot bear to see a pearl covered in dust, so I have come specifically to guide the Benefactor's path forward."

"Sanzang?"

Xu Yunfan said, "It's a good name, but I wonder if you can bear the weight of it."

Sanzang smiled. "It was bestowed by a Bodhisattva. It should be so."

Xu Yunfan chuckled. "Karmic connection? What I cultivate is the Daoist True Martial Demon-Subduing Art, I walk the path of banishing demons and eliminating evil, and I tread the righteous path of the human world. I fear my path is different from the Zen methods of your esteemed temple, and we will not reach the same destination."

He even calls himself righteous.

Sanzang almost lost his breath.

This demon from the Yuanmo Sect was truly shameless to the extreme, boasting about himself so righteously.

Naturally, the scolding in his heart did not show on his face.

Sanzang smiled faintly, a smile that seemed to embrace all things yet also see through everything. "All laws return to the source; different paths can still lead to the same destination."

"The Benefactor possesses great courage, great wisdom, and great fortune. You are the perfect candidate for the Vajra Guardian of my Buddhist sect. Put down the butcher's knife, and you shall become a Buddha on the spot. The karmic connection between you and my Buddha is here."

Xu Yunfan's expression changed upon hearing this, and a fire of anger flared up in his heart.

This bald donkey is utterly shameless.

This is not guidance at all. Seeing that his foundation is solid and his combat power outstanding, he clearly wants to forcibly abduct him to be a guardian enforcer, to enslave him.

What connection with the Buddha? It's just an excuse for plunder.

He cultivates the True Martial Demon-Subduing Scripture. His True Martial power is fierce and domineering, specifically suppressing evil spirits. At the mid Foundation Establishment realm, he is already capable of standing above his peers. How could he allow someone to forcibly abduct him like this?

Is this bastard here to take advantage of him?

He suppressed his anger forcefully, and his voice turned cold. "Master, your words are mistaken. My Dao heart is firm, and my ambition lies on the path of immortality. I have no intention of serving before the Buddha. Why must you force me?"

Sanzang's face showed an even deeper look of compassion, but his words carried an undeniable certainty. "Since the karma has arrived, how can you lightly depart? Benefactor, do you know why the four corners of the world—the South Continent, the North Continent, and the West Continent—are all called 'Continents,' but the East alone is called the 'Eastern Wasteland'?"

Although Xu Yunfan didn't know what this bald donkey was plotting, he was quite interested in this topic.

"Oh? Please enlighten me, Master."

Sanzang clasped his hands together and spoke in a grand voice. "The East is where the sun rises. It should be bright and grand, yet why is it named 'Wasteland'? It is because it is barren and chaotic, and the true Dharma is not manifest! This is the will of heaven, and it also foreshadows that my Buddhist sect will prosper in the East, saving all living beings and cleansing all evil."

"This is the great trend of the Dharma's transmission to the East. Like the rising sun, it cannot be reversed! The Benefactor has a deep karmic connection with my Buddha and should become the Guardian Vajra for the Eastward Crossing of my Buddhist sect, clearing obstacles and illuminating the Buddhist land."

"This is a great merit in accordance with the Dao of Heaven. If the transmission to the East is successful, you will naturally be able to step into the position of a Bodhisattva. This is also the karma destined for you in your life. Meeting this humble monk today is the clear will of heaven."

"Benefactor, your path lies here. Come with this humble monk."

"Even if you have a thousand unwillingnesses and a million struggles, this karma is set. You cannot escape."

Xu Yunfan listened and sneered repeatedly. These monks truly have glib tongues. With a few words, they package their selfish desire to abduct and plunder as acting in accordance with the will of heaven, following the great trend, and performing great merit. It is extremely high-sounding and shameless to the extreme.

Every word and sentence used Buddhist principles to pressure him, as if Xu Yunfan's refusal would be a defiance of heaven's will, an ungrateful act, and a betrayal of the Buddha's grace.

Xu Yunfan was so angry he laughed instead. This guy was clearly here because of the True Martial Demon-Subduing Scripture he cultivated.

"Hahaha!"

Xu Yunfan's laughter was filled with sarcasm and a chilling killing intent. "What a fine 'accordance with the Dao of Heaven'! What a fine 'destined karma'!"

"You bald donkeys, whenever you want to plunder, you can always pull out some high-sounding, tattered banners."

"I, Xu Yunfan, only recognize the sword in my hand and the Dao in my heart. Whether something is a demon or an evil is determined by my heart. If I deem you an evil, it doesn't matter if you are a Buddha or an immortal; I can cut you down with a single sword."

"My Dao is only in my palm. How can it be bound by your illusory 'karma'?"

Before the words had fully faded, Xu Yunfan had already attacked ferociously!

Seeing this, Sanzang could not help but sigh. He uttered a phrase.

"Why make things difficult?"

His right hand grasped at the empty air, and a pitch-black greatsword, formed purely from pure True Martial power, appeared out of thin air.
