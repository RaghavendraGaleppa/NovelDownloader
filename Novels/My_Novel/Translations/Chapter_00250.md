# Chapter 250: The Mysteries of the Second Realm and the Wondrous Use of Immortal Sound

White mist, fragrant and floating, rose and dissolved back into the heavens and earth.

This was the omen of the "Three Flowers Above the Head."

Li Xian felt the changes. The martial realms of "Consuming Essence to Shed Mortality" and "Molding Bones to Sculpt a胚"… all served to increase one's internal reserves, aligning one closer with the heavens and earth, adding possibilities and extending one's lifespan.

His power had increased significantly, yet it wasn't exaggerated; this was merely a side effect.

Wen Cai-shang nodded. "Indeed. Perhaps by venturing into dangerous lands, you have digested the 'scattered scales and half-tails' of heaven and earth's essence much faster."

The surroundings were quiet and serene, with the occasional birdsong.

Having heard no sign of pursuers for a long time, a sense of leisure arose naturally. They began discussing the Dao of martial arts. Intending to teach, Wen Cai-shang glanced at a large tree beside them and said, "施展 your Emerald Luo Palm and strike this tree. Control your strength; do not break it."

The tree was seven zhang tall with dense foliage. It was nothing special.

Li Xian's Qi Lake was nearly seventy zhang wide. His Qi was vast and surging. He raised his palm and struck. The trunk shook violently, and leaves rustled down, falling together with venomous snakes, insects, and all sorts of bugs.

Wen Cai-shang said, "Your palm technique is flawless and has reached its peak, but it can still go a step further. Strike again, and this time, play the Immortal Sound simultaneously."

Li Xian pondered, "Play the Immortal Sound?" As his palm struck, his bones lightly clicked together, and a curling, ethereal sound resonated. Just then, a *thud* was heard as the trunk trembled.

Leaves fell like rain, piercing straight into the soil. Leaves are light; they should drift left and right with the wind. For them to fall straight and pierce the ground was truly strange.

Li Xian realized, "This is the miraculous effect of the Immortal Sound!"

Wen Cai-shang smiled. "Do as I say: like this, and like that. Play the Immortal Sound while striking with your palm." Li Xian followed suit, his palm print striking the trunk.

The leaves fell in a flurry, actually spiraling around the trunk like a whirlpool. Li Xian asked, "Madam, what is the principle behind this?"

Wen Cai-shang smiled. "The curling Immortal Sound is a great cornerstone of martial arts. Mastering the Immortal Sound elevates one's strength to a higher level."

"Consider this: a martial artist has two hundred and six bones in their body. When they knock against each other, they produce different rhythms. When finger bones click, the sound is crisp and fleeting. When leg bones knock, it is heavy and muffled, with a lingering resonance."

"Countless tones combine. Sometimes slow, sometimes急; sometimes clear, sometimes muffled. They form countless strange sounds, which a martial artist could spend a lifetime exploring and never fully comprehend."

"And their uses are infinite, just like the endless changes in the natural world."

Li Xian suddenly understood. "The heavens and earth have color, and they also have sound."

"The gurgling of a stream flowing through gaps in mountain rocks, the rustle of falling leaves… everything, endless and infinite. A martial artist's body is like the heavens and earth, so they must imitate the sounds of the heavens and earth. Madam… am I correct?"

Wen Cai-shang was slightly taken aback, then smiled. "That is also correct. You are very smart. Martial arts require one's own insights. I shall teach you two rhythms first."

"The first is called 'Body-Protecting Sound.' It is played starting from the Weilu acupoint at the base of the spine… When facing a powerful enemy or suffering an injury, you vibrate the Body-Protecting Rhythm. It can protect your entire body, calm the mind, guard your Qi, and keep you lucid."

"The second is called 'Attack-Killing Sound.' It is played starting from the Jade Pillow acupoint, passing through all the bones… When you raise your palm or draw your sword, play the Attack-Killing Rhythm. It makes your killing intent stronger. It is like a battle between two armies: one side beats drums to shake the heavens, its momentum surging; the other side remains silent and muffled, its morale low. Once the battle begins, the one with drums shaking the heavens can defeat a superior force with a smaller one!"

The foundation of a martial artist lies in the spine.

The spine is the pillar that supports the heavens and the origin of all rhythms. The spine has twenty-four segments, corresponding to the solar terms of the heavens and earth.

The three passes—Weilu, Jiaji, and Yuzhen—correspond to the initial birth of essence, the warming of heart-fire, and the mysterious orifice of the brain's marrow. They stand between heaven and earth, connecting the cosmos.

Li Xian had forged his spine to be like a divine mountain. The moment he played the Immortal Sound, his momentum, spirit, and scale were already far superior to others!

Martial artists without a proper lineage who stumble into the Second Realm only begin to feel the wonders of the Immortal Sound and realize the importance of the "spine" when it is often too late. Fortunately, Li Xian was nurtured by Wen Cai-shang, making his path solid.

A martial artist of the First Realm, if their attainments are deep, might not be inferior to a Second Realm martial artist in terms of strength, martial arts, or adaptability. Why do they often suffer in combat? It is precisely because of these subtle mysteries.

Li Xian learned to play the "Body-Protecting Sound" and "Attack-Killing Sound," gaining much and increasing his strength by a large margin. When the Body-Protecting Sound was played, a faint white light emanated from his body. When the Attack-Killing Sound was played, his sword intent surged violently.

He mastered them quickly. Wen Cai-shang said, "The Immortal Sound is wondrous, but it must not be played randomly. Playing it recklessly during a fight can反而 harm oneself."

Li Xian accepted the teaching. He had just grasped the key point and was full of enthusiasm. He memorized the "Body-Protecting Sound" and "Attack-Killing Sound" firmly, practicing their start and stop until they were natural and smooth.

After half an hour, Li Xian had初步 mastered them. Seeing the clear sky, he packed his bags and continued his journey. Li Xian led the way, clearing a path, while Wen Cai-shang protected him from the side.

Li Xian asked, "Is Madam also skilled in using the curling Immortal Sound?" Wen Cai-shang replied, "No, I am not skilled in the Chest-Drum Thunder Sound or the curling Immortal Sound; I have even abandoned them. My strength lies in 'Wearing the Dirty Robe.'"

Li Xian asked, "To abandon such a powerful technique, isn't that a pity?" Wen Cai-shang shook her head and smiled. "There are infinitely powerful techniques in the world. A martial artist has their strengths, and thus their weaknesses. What is so strange about that? The curling Immortal Sound is indeed powerful and can be called one of the pillars of martial arts, but… one does not have to be proficient in it to be considered powerful. The Dao of martial arts is vast, and methods are myriad. Asking about this too early is of no benefit. Let's hurry on our way!"

It wasn't that she was hiding her skills, but that the paths of martial arts are too numerous. Words cannot describe them all; one must see, test, and taste along the way to know their flavor.

They traveled for several li. Li Xian's horizons were broadened when he suddenly saw light ahead and arrived at the edge of a cliff. A gentle breeze blew, washing over their bodies.

It blew away all the stifling humidity. They raised their brows and exhaled, feeling refreshed and clear-headed.

The cliff was dozens of zhang high. Li Xian cut down vines, wove them into a rope, and climbed down. Just as he neared the bottom and his feet touched the ground, he felt himself sinking…

Li Xian exclaimed in surprise, "This is a swamp! The bushes blocked the view. It's a good thing I didn't jump down directly. Otherwise, getting stuck in the mud would have been dangerous!" He climbed back up the rope to inform Wen Cai-shang.

They felt along the cliff and found another path to descend.

They traveled another ten li or so. The surrounding vegetation changed; the wild, overgrown bushes disappeared. The ancient trees were tall but no longer blocked the sunlight.

Wen Cai-shang said with delight, "This is a 'Resting Wood.'" Li Xian asked, "What is a Resting Wood?" Wen Cai-shang explained, "Since ancient times, powerful figures have enjoyed building their tombs in the wilderness. The carpenters, artisans, and attendants building the tombs had to travel back and forth many times. However, the wilderness is a vast sea of green, and the dangers along the way, as you and I have seen, are numerous."

"And a grand tomb takes decades, or even over a hundred years, to build. Therefore, those attendants and artisans, on their journeys, would plant the seeds of 'Luo-bu Fir Trees' in the dense forests."

"The Luo-bu Fir has strong vitality; it can gnaw at tree roots. Its trunk is straight, and its fragrance repels insects. Once it evolves into a forest, it becomes a relatively safe woodland."

Li Xian said, "Madam has such broad knowledge," expressing his sincere admiration. Wen Cai-shang said happily, "Now that we have reached the Resting Wood, we can relax for a bit."

The view suddenly opened up. Sunlight shone down, warming their entire bodies. The sticky, damp feeling completely faded. Li Xian found a lake where fish played, with no apparent danger.

The two entered the lake to bathe. They washed away the sweat and grime, took off their clothes to dry by the fire, and felt completely relaxed. Finally, they could rest for a while.

Li Xian感慨道: "The ancients planted trees, and the later generations enjoy the shade. This is indeed true." The grassland was dry; although there were mosquitoes, snakes, and rats, they were not rampant.

They laid out their bedding, gazing at the stars and the moon. With a gentle breeze accompanying them, they slept soundly and comfortably.

The next day.

Li Xian practiced his martial arts, going through the Seven Star Steps, the Setting Sun Fading Blood Sword, the Vast and Misty Legs… all his various techniques.

His Qi Lake grew, making further progress.

His stomach rumbled with hunger. He went to the lake's edge, wrapped pebbles in silk thread. Spotting a fish, he shot it precisely. The pebble embedded in the fish's body, and with a pull of the silk thread, he brought it to the surface.

He caught three fish in a row. With a great harvest, Li Xian coiled his silk and headed back. Suddenly, he saw blood on the ground. Li Xian thought, "Could someone have been here before me?"

Cautiously, he followed the blood trail. Pushing aside a dense thicket of weeds, he indeed saw a figure. The person was short, of ordinary appearance, and their clothes were sticky and foul-smelling.

It was a disciple of the "Wuji Blade Sect."

Li Xian raised his palm to kill, but suddenly thought:

"This person is insignificant; there is no need to kill him in a hurry. His presence here proves that the Wuji Blade Sect has also entered Tiger's Cry Ridge. Why not save him and inquire about the situation? I can kill him later."

He checked the person's breathing and felt his bones. With a slight exertion of his fingers, he dislocated the bones of his wrists and ankles. He carried him back to the camp. Wen Cai-shang was sitting cross-legged, practicing her inner arts. She was surprised and asked what had happened. Li Xian told her the truth.

Wen Cai-shang examined the injuries, prepared some herbs, and had Li Xian boil them. She, meanwhile, flipped her sleeve and drew her sword, intending to sever his four limbs to prevent future trouble.

Li Xian said, "Madam, please wait! I have already dislocated his joints; he won't be able to cause trouble even if he wakes up. If we sever his limbs, he will become disheartened, and we won't be able to get anything out of him."

Wen Cai-shang nodded and smiled. "That makes sense." The two had thought of the same thing.

She sheathed her sword, and it vanished into her sleeve. Li Xian was very curious; how could it disappear into thin air?

After the herbs were boiled, he fed them to the man. About half a day later, the man coughed lightly and woke up in a daze.

Li Xian used threats and inducements to question him. The man, terrified and lamenting his miserable fate, was desperate and helpless. Naturally, he spoke without holding back, revealing everything.

It turned out that...

The Alliance to Seek the Sword was powerful, with the Cold-Blooded Divine Catcher giving his full support and righteous martial artists helping in indignation. They surrounded the area near the Wei Tiger River, their momentum unprecedented.

But they came up empty.

Li Xian and Wen Cai-shang, at their wit's end, had hidden themselves in Tiger's Cry Ridge.

Leng Shixing said, "Since they have hidden in Tiger's Cry Ridge, there is no need to pursue. They have a ninety percent chance of not surviving." He then took his leave.

Su Qiuwu and the others held a banquet to see Leng Shixing off. They all thought, "Is it really over?"

Su Qiuwu, Li Quan, Qi Beidao, Shen Pingping, Zhao Zhiyuan, and the others knew of the dangers of Tiger's Cry Ridge, but without seeing a body, a stone of unease remained in their hearts.

They discussed among themselves and decided to enter the ridge to search for three days. Regardless of the outcome after three days, they would withdraw. Li Quan was from the Tai Heart Sect and had a good relationship with the Tiger Arhat Sect. He specifically visited the Tiger Arhat Sect's Sect Master, Zhang Ruifeng, to ask for a map of Tiger's Cry Ridge.

Zhang Ruifeng politely refused, advising them not to enter the ridge recklessly. The group had chased for months, suffering injuries and setbacks… their hatred had buried deep and turned into an obsession.

How could they listen to advice? They all thought, "Even if we can't get the map, as long as we are careful, we should be fine."

So they all entered Tiger's Cry Ridge, leaving only Qian Jinghao and a few disciples to guard the outside. Little did they know that this time, they were walking into a trap.

The ancient trees blotted out the sky and sun.

The group was successively attacked by the "Tiger Calamity," with dozens of people losing their lives to the tigers' jaws. They were also drenched by the damp rain, contracting a strange illness that left their bodies red and swollen.

From the second day, Su Qiuwu began to organize the team to return to the manor, daring to pursue no further. They had clearly marked their path and set their direction on the way in, but on the way back, they got lost! All their markers were gone.

The group was powerful and had the ability to distinguish north from south, but even when they knew the direction, they would always veer off course. The more they walked, the more confused they became, until they didn't even know where they were, unable to find their way out whether they went north or south.

In the following days, they encountered swamps, bewildering forests, and肮脏 monkeys. They lost nearly seventy percent of their people.

Zhao Zhiyuan, Su Qiuwu, Li Quan… these mighty martial artists of the Third Realm, were dragged into the swamp by a giant crocodile due to a moment of carelessness.

Although their strength was solid and they killed the crocodile,

they were unable to save themselves and had no strength left to pursue.
