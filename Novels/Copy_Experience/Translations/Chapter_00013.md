# Chapter 13: Azure Radiance Sword

Lu Xu saw Han Erlengzi in the fields while harvesting spirit rice. He told him about Old Man Xu. Erlengzi listened with an envious expression: "Big Brother Lu, I really want to settle down and find a wife too!"

"You've only just embarked on the cultivation path, and you're already thinking about this?" Lu Xu was momentarily at a loss for words.

"Whoosh! Whoosh..."

Streaks of light cut across the sky; it was the Mo family's patrol guard. "I should also go buy a magic artifact!" Lu Xu thought to himself upon seeing this scene. "With my current Qi Condensation third-layer magic power, I can barely activate a mid-grade artifact. Low-grade artifacts would be useless; they're not even as good as the talismans I have!"

As he acquired more spirit stones, Lu Xu became increasingly concerned about his own safety. He had been planning to buy a mid-grade artifact immediately after breaking through to the third layer of Qi Condensation for a long time. Now that he had broken through, it was time to put the plan into action.

Early the next morning, Lu Xu subtly altered his appearance with some disguise and quietly headed to the market's trading zone. In terms of selling magic artifacts, Thousand Machines Hall had the best reputation in Qinghu Market. Therefore, Lu Xu went straight to this establishment.

"Fellow Daoist, please come in. What kind of artifact are you looking to buy, offensive or defensive?" Just as he arrived at the entrance of Thousand Machines Hall, a ruddy-faced, portly man came forward to greet him.

"I wish to buy a mid-grade offensive artifact, preferably one with considerable power!" Lu Xu, disguised as a rugged big man, said expressionlessly.

The portly man instinctively glanced at Lu Xu upon hearing this, unable to sense his cultivation level. He knew this person was using a concealment art to hide their cultivation. Facing a customer, the portly man did not commit the offensive act of activating a spiritual eye art to inspect the other party's cultivation.

"Wants a mid-grade artifact, seems to be a mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivator!" A guess flashed through the man's mind, and a warm smile appeared on his face: "Fellow Daoist, please follow me. This hall can absolutely provide you with the best mid-grade offensive artifacts!"

Inside Thousand Machines Hall, jade tables were arranged on the floor, and many cultivators walked back and forth among them. The portly man led Lu Xu to a jade table, where dozens of various artifacts such as swords, spears, halberds, bells, tripods, pagodas, and nets were displayed.

"The artifacts here are all refined by renowned masters, absolutely rare masterpieces. Whichever one you buy, Fellow Daoist, it will be enough to make you invincible among those of the same cultivation stage," the portly man began to boast endlessly.

Lu Xu ignored him. After looking around, he picked up a small sword shimmering with an azure light and asked: "How much is this sword?"

The portly man saw Lu Xu pick up the sword and immediately eagerly approached: "This is the Azure Radiance Sword. I'm not boasting, but its power is absolutely top-tier among wood-attribute artifacts, and the price is very cheap, only one hundred and twenty spirit stones!"

"Cheap? Cheap my foot!" Lu Xu silently grumbled. Large shops like this generally don't haggle; whatever price they state is final. So, although Lu Xu felt the price was quite high, he had no choice but to accept it.

"I'll take this Azure Radiance Sword!" Lu Xu looked around and, finding no other suitable artifacts besides the Azure Radiance Sword, immediately decided on it. Before spiritual consciousness is born, cultivators cannot simultaneously control multiple artifacts. Therefore, he only bought this one.

"Haha, good. The power of the Azure Radiance Sword will absolutely not disappoint Fellow Daoist!" "Welcome back next time, Fellow Daoist!"

After completing the transaction, the ruddy-faced portly man enthusiastically escorted Lu Xu out of Thousand Machines Hall, then just as enthusiastically went to greet another cultivator who had walked over.

Half a month passed.

"Go!"

In front of a lush green spirit field, Lu Xu, seeing that there was no one around, immediately took out the Azure Radiance Sword. He cast an object manipulation art, pointed with his hand, and the small sword immediately soared into the air.

"Whoosh! Whoosh!"

The Azure Radiance Sword flew back and forth in the sky, sometimes abruptly stopping, sometimes swiftly darting. Lu Xu felt the smooth control, as if it were an extension of his arm, and couldn't help but laugh heartily. This was his first time controlling an artifact, and the novel experience gave him a thrilling sensation. Now, he finally looked a bit like a cultivator.

Lu Xu pointed his hand, and the Azure Radiance Sword stopped, hovering beneath his feet, and rapidly expanded. When it became wide enough, Lu Xu jumped onto it. The long sword, shimmering with azure light, trembled and then immediately carried him soaring into the sky.

Sword flight! His childhood dream had come true!

Lu Xu thoroughly enjoyed experiencing this artifact, watching the rapidly passing white clouds beside him, filled with deep emotion. This was the true style of a cultivator!

Not daring to be too conspicuous, Lu Xu flew for a moment and then immediately descended. Standing at the edge of the spirit field, he tested the power of the Azure Radiance Sword once more. This time, it wasn't as smooth as when he was flying on the sword. Lu Xu only felt the sword become impossibly heavy, his magic power rapidly draining into it, yet the sword remained motionless. The strenuous sensation made him feel as if he were moving a mountain. It wasn't until over a third of his magic power had been consumed that the Azure Radiance Sword suddenly transformed into an azure streak and shot forth.

Like a bolt of azure lightning, it swiftly slashed forward at a speed almost imperceptible to the naked eye.

"Bang!"

A large boulder by the spirit field instantly shattered into dust, leaving a deep gully on the ground.

"Not bad, not bad, this power is impressive!" Lu Xu was extremely satisfied. With a wave of his hand, he recalled the Azure Radiance Sword. "Indeed, as that portly man said, with this artifact in hand, it will be hard to find any opponents in the early stages of Qi Condensation!"

Hiding the Azure Radiance Sword in his sleeve, ready to fly out at any moment to fend off enemies, Lu Xu immediately felt a sense of security with this sword. After dealing with the traces on the ground, he quickly departed.

Back in the market, just as he entered his courtyard, Lu Xu saw a rather beautiful woman emerge from He Qing's room. Lu Xu's mouth twitched. As a "single dog," he felt like he had taken 10,000 critical damage.

This was He Qing's wife, a gentle and virtuous mortal woman, upright in character and good-looking. He Qing was quite fond of her. Previously, after being provoked by Old Man Xu's grandson, He Qing had completely made up his mind to abandon his cultivation progress and begin preparing to marry and have children. At first, he had planned to find a female cultivator of similar age, but the harsh reality quickly shattered his dream. Any female cultivator in Qinghu Market who had thoughts of marriage would prioritize Mo family disciples or famous strong cultivators in the market. What advantage did he, a chicken farmer, have? They would rather be concubines to old men in the late Qi Condensation stage than seek out an honest man like He Qing.

After understanding the situation, He Qing gave up on immortal cultivators and turned his attention to the mortal world. He made several trips to the mortal town outside the market and then found his current wife. However, although the two were already married, they had been living apart. He Qing wanted to accumulate spirit stones for his next generation, so he was reluctant to pay an extra two spirit stones in rent. His new wife was currently living in the mortal town outside the market.
