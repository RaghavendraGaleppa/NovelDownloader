# Chapter 121: The Hammer in the Rain

“Profound Dragon Ranking?”

To Li Mo, this was a relatively unfamiliar term.

“That’s a list that records the young prodigies of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.”

Luo Yao found it strange. This young man’s knowledge fluctuated wildly; he knew so many people from the martial world, yet he didn’t know about the Profound Dragon Ranking.

“The list includes geniuses under the Age of Thirty and below the Inner Scene Realm, totaling one hundred names.”

She paused, seemingly recalling something.

“In your sect, Yin Huacheng seems to have once made it to the last spot at number one hundred.”

*So your memory is actually pretty good?*

Realizing something, Li Mo silently lowered his head and got back to business, deciding to change his overly edgy alias when he had the time.

Gradually, night fell.

He had recorded just about everything, but he still hadn’t waited for that Han Zhen.

The banquet in the hall was just beginning.

...

“Among those entering the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm this time, only Brother Yin Huacheng is barely worth looking at.”

Bai Jinghong was arrogant, but as the Qingyuan Sect was the local overlord of the Ziyang Prefecture, and Yin Huacheng had once made the Profound Dragon Ranking, he reluctantly offered a polite remark.

But Yin Huacheng wasn’t a swordsman; he was more interested in Ying Bing.

“I heard your Junior Sister has excellent swordsmanship?”

“She is naturally far inferior to Young Hero Bai.”

Yin Huacheng lowered his eyes and took a drink, then shouted downwards, “Junior Sister Ying Bing, Young Hero Bai also wields a profound weapon. Why don’t you represent our Qingyuan Sect and exchange swordplay as a form of friendship?”

*There he goes, a classic case of forgetting the pain after the wound heals.*

Would Ying Bing pay him any mind?

The Ice Cube was currently dipping her jade-like finger in water, drawing something on the table.

Hmm, it was the shape of the ice cream she planned to make tonight.

Making ice cream counts as cooking, right?

Bai Jinghong said with a half-smile, “Brother Yin Huacheng, it seems you don’t have much authority among your fellow sect members.”

“Haha...”

Yin Huacheng, his face burning, could only force a smile. “Ying Bing has a cold and proud nature. She focuses solely on cultivation and the Dao of the Sword. She treats everyone the same.”

*Well, isn’t this a coincidence.*

Little Li Mo happened to return just then. He grabbed Ying Bing’s teacup and gulped it down.

After he finished, Ying Bing, as if long accustomed to it, naturally refilled his cup.

“The shape of your ice cream is too weird; it’ll be hard to lick.”

Li Mo retracted his gaze from the stage and added, “I’ll come back to the banquet later. I’m heading home first.”

“Alright, I’ll wait for you.”

Ying Bing and Li Mo still had a sword practice session tonight.

She knew Li Mo wasn’t going home.

He was waiting for a certain “fated person.”

The heavens were not kind; a torrential rain began to pour outside.

Li Mo placed the Chixiao Sword with Ying Bing and turned to step into the wind and rain.

Watching the young man leave.

Bai Jinghong, with a half-smile and a wine cup in hand, looked at Yin Huacheng with a playful expression, even carrying a hint of pity in his gaze.

“Excuse me.”

Yin Huacheng, however, remained calm and composed.

He felt there was no need to get angry over a dead man.

The elders had gone to discuss matters, and Li Mo hadn’t brought a weapon.

The manor was a mixed bag of characters, with visitors from all corners of the land.

The weather was even fitting—a rainy night with a downpour.

Everything was in place.

He offered an apology and stepped out of the main gate. Finding a secluded corner, he changed into a bamboo hat and raincoat, wore black robes underneath, and even put on a human-skin mask.

After all preparations were complete, he too stepped into the curtain of rain.

*Rumble—*

A thunderclap flashed across the sky, illuminating the vast, bleak world, turning the green mountains and waters a ghastly white.

The sound of the rain was deafening, covering up Yin Huacheng’s heavy breathing and racing heartbeat.

Droplets of water fell onto the few exposed patches of his skin but couldn’t stick to them, as if blocked by a slippery layer.

He moved silently through the woods by the main road. When encountering obstacles, his body would twist past them like a灵蛇 (spirit snake), his movements swift and bizarre.

A pair of vertical pupils were fixed dead on the back of the young man in front.

*That’s far enough.*

He was about to deliver a fatal blow.

But at that moment, the young man in front turned around, looking directly at his position.

When their eyes met, Yin Huacheng’s heart skipped a beat.

*Too calm.*

The young man showed no fear; in fact, he seemed to have let out a sigh of relief.

“Senior Brother Yin Huacheng, it’s a good thing you’re so impatient.”

“Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to wait for you today,” Li Mo said softly.

“You were waiting for me?”

Yin Huacheng’s body could no longer suppress its transformation. His neck suddenly elongated, scales pierced through his skin, and his eyes turned into cold, serpentine pupils.

“This place is remote. No one will hear you scream.”

---

“I’ll kill you, dispose of the body, and leave a Swallow Banner of the Drizzle Pavilion.”

“Then you’ll be known as a victim of the Drizzle Pavilion. Who would know it was me?”

It was unclear if he was trying to intimidate or convince himself.

“What a coincidence.”

A strangely shaped hammer appeared in his palm.

Li, the one who carries a hammer but no sword in the rainy night, Mo.

“That was my initial plan as well.”

“Die!”

Yin Huacheng struck first. His body trembled violently, as if a hundred beasts were roaring within him.

Li Mo seemed to hear a hiss.

Was it a snake? Or a flood dragon?

The aura was like that of a prehistoric beast—a terrifying pressure emanating from his powerful physical body, not from any kind of spiritual charm.

But...

*Rumble—*

Thunder boomed. A bolt of lightning, like a ferocious serpent, tore through the night sky, instantly draining the world of all color.

There was a sound, incredibly loud.

It even drowned out the rolling thunder from moments before.

A hammer?

As the hammer fell.

Yin Huacheng wanted to roar, but he found he couldn’t make a sound.

The rainwater suddenly froze, then was sucked back into the sky, creating a momentary vacuum.

This single hammer strike.

His Golden Core shattered, his internal energy collapsed. The beast-like body that Yin Huacheng had refined by harming countless people seemed to be nothing more than rotten mud.

He was smashed into the ground, his bones shattered to pieces.

“Sigh, why’d you have to hit so hard?”

Qian Bufan walked out from behind the curtain of rain, accompanied by Xue Jing.

Elder Xue looked on with a sigh. “At least you left him a breath.”

With a stomp of his foot, Yin Huacheng was blasted out from the ground.

He was in a wretched state, barely recognizable as human. The flesh and blood on his body seemed to have developed a will of their own, beginning to devour him.

“Yin Huacheng... why did it have to come to this?”

Qian Bufan sighed heavily.

If Yin Huacheng was like this, Yin Huaxuan couldn’t possibly be unaware.

It could only mean that this elder of the Rare Beast Peak might be the true source of the Hundred Beast Blood Refinement.

“Back on Qingyuan Mountain, Shang Wu was reckless and almost stumbled upon the truth.”

Xue Jing frowned.

Yin Huacheng’s body was already on the verge of collapse.

Using healing medicine would only accelerate the backlash of his flesh.

“The Sect Master has been informed of this matter.”

“Little Mo, just act as if nothing happened. We will handle the matter of Yin Huaxuan ourselves.”

Xue Jing pondered for a moment.

The Demonic Summoning Sect was诡异 (bizarre), and might have unknown methods to pass on information.

“Give him a clean end...”

“Alright.”

*Bang—*

It was all over in an instant.

Xue Jing and Qian Bufan watched as the young man收回 (retracted) his hammer, falling silent for a moment.

*You小子 (little guy) never intended to let Yin Huacheng live from the start, did you?*

They were both thinking.

The Qingyuan Sect might not have produced a second Shang Wu.

But rather, one who was blue (green) and surpassed the original.

Thankfully, Li Mo had always been good to his own people...

...

Inside East Fence Manor.

During the banquet.

Bai Jinghong suddenly stood up. After exchanging a glance with the old man beside him, he rested his hand on his sword and said, “Everyone, the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm is extremely dangerous.”

“The Hengyun Sword City is compassionate and does not wish for everyone to lose their lives in vain.”

“If you cannot take three moves from me, I see no need for you to enter the secret realm to risk your life.”

He spoke calmly.

The content was polite, but the tone essentially meant:

*‘Everyone here is garbage.’*

*‘What level do you think you are to compete with me for opportunities?’*

And indeed.

Bai Jinghong’s gaze was like a sword, sweeping sharply across the crowd. The vast majority of people dared not meet his eyes.

Of course, there were a few exceptions.

Tie Qi’s gaze was burning; he did not back down in the slightest.

Luo Yu frowned. *You’re stealing my act, so what am I supposed to do?*

Of course.

There was also the Ice Cube.

She was still drawing snow cakes.
