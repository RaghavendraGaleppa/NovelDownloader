# Chapter 1: Sunflower  

"Gu Mo, you have three days left. If you still can't draw qi into your body, you'll lose your chance to become a menial disciple of the Qinglu Sect." A voice suddenly pierced through Gu Mo's daze.  

The abrupt statement left Gu Mo utterly confused. Drawing qi? Qinglu Sect? He had just pulled an all-nighter working overtime—why was he hearing things?  

Shaking his still-groggy head, Gu Mo finally focused on the speaker—an ordinary-looking middle-aged man dressed in a blue robe, exuding an inexplicable pressure.  

"Hmph!"  

Seeing Gu Mo's blank stare, the blue-robed man snorted coldly and turned to leave.  

"What's going on?"  

Watching the retreating figure, Gu Mo's face was full of questions. But soon, his confusion turned to shock as he realized he was no longer in his familiar rented apartment. More importantly, he had somehow become a teenager of about sixteen or seventeen.  

Being in an unfamiliar place could be explained by kidnapping, but turning into a teenager? That could only mean one thing—he had transmigrated.  

Assuming he had indeed crossed over, Gu Mo now faced three pressing questions: Who had he become? Where was he? And what should he do next?  

Closing his eyes, he searched his mind but found no memories of the original owner. Refusing to give up, he concentrated harder—and suddenly, his consciousness blurred before appearing in a strange space. The area was surrounded by thick, impenetrable black mist, with only a small clearing the size of his outstretched arms free of the darkness.  

Gu Mo tentatively reached out to touch the mist, only to recoil instantly from the bone-chilling terror it evoked.  

Too afraid to probe further, he turned his attention to the small clearing. Finding nothing of note, he glanced downward and spotted a smooth, unknown material beneath his feet. There, he saw a small object the size of a pigeon egg.  

Picking it up, Gu Mo examined its appearance and texture, deducing it was likely the seed of some unknown plant—though he couldn't identify what kind.  

Unable to discern its origins, he set the seed aside for the moment and continued inspecting the space. But apart from the seed, he found nothing else.  

"Leave."  

The moment the thought crossed his mind, Gu Mo was ejected from the black mist space—with the seed still clutched in his hand. Though only his consciousness could enter, objects inside could be brought out. The question now was whether items from the outside could be taken in.  

Curious, Gu Mo looked around and grabbed a nearby object. Focusing his mind, he re-entered the black mist space—with the object still in hand. A surge of excitement filled him.  

Not only could he take things out, but he could also bring them in! Regardless of whatever other secrets this space held, its storage ability alone was incredibly valuable.  

After experimenting a few times, Gu Mo turned his attention back to the seed. A mysterious seed found in such a peculiar space? Even a fool could tell it wasn't ordinary.  

As he studied the seed, a faint screen of light suddenly appeared before him. Startled at first, he quickly realized it must be revealing the seed's origins.  

**Name:** Sunflower  
**Grade:** 1st Tier, Low Grade  
**Effect:** Gathers solar essence  
**Planting Requirement:** 1st Tier Spirit Field  

"A sunflower that gathers solar essence... I wonder how valuable that essence is," Gu Mo mused, staring at the screen.  

The planting condition mentioned a spirit field, and combined with the blue-robed man's earlier mention of "drawing qi into the body" and the "Qinglu Sect," Gu Mo suspected he had transmigrated into a cultivation world.  

Speaking of the blue-robed man, Gu Mo recalled his warning: three days to achieve qi absorption, or face expulsion. Though he didn't know the consequences of being kicked out, it certainly wouldn't be good. The problem was, Gu Mo had no idea what "drawing qi into the body" even meant.  

Without the original owner's memories, Gu Mo was severely lacking in information. Fortunately, the original owner wasn't exactly normal—because who kept a diary?  

Hidden in a secret compartment by the bed, Gu Mo found the original owner's journal. Its contents were so detailed that he couldn't help but marvel—this guy really wasn't ordinary. If anyone else read this, the embarrassment would be lethal.  

But for Gu Mo, the diary was a treasure trove. It revealed everything about the original owner and his current predicament.  

As he suspected, he had indeed crossed into a cultivation world. The original owner, also named Gu Mo, had been accepted into the Qinglu Sect after being identified as having an inferior spiritual root. His role? A menial disciple—essentially a laborer handling menial tasks like tending spirit fields, feeding spirit beasts, refining spirit ores, and sorting medicinal herbs.  

These tasks were beyond ordinary mortals, and the sect's elites wouldn't waste their precious cultivation time on them. Thus, those with the lowest-grade spiritual roots, like Gu Mo, were perfect candidates.  

Though inferior spiritual roots were the weakest, they still allowed for cultivation. With even minimal cultivation, one could manipulate spiritual energy to perform tasks impossible for mortals.  

Even as a menial disciple, joining the Qinglu Sect and stepping onto the path of cultivation placed him above ninety-nine percent of ordinary people. Successfully drawing qi into the body would grant immunity to common illnesses, and advancing further to the Qi Refining stage would extend his lifespan to over a hundred years.  

However, after nearly three months in the sect, the original owner still hadn't achieved qi absorption. For someone with an inferior spiritual root, this wasn't entirely unusual.  

Knowing the limitations of such disciples, the Qinglu Sect provided them with a Qi-Introduction Pill and three low-grade spirit stones upon entry—resources meant to help even the weakest roots achieve qi absorption within three months.  

Yet the original owner seemed inherently unsuited for cultivation. No matter how hard he tried, even after consuming the pill, he failed. Hearing of others' successes only heightened his anxiety—until he heard a rumor.  

A rumor that a powerful cultivation manual, lost by an inner sect disciple, lay hidden in the woods beyond the menial disciples' quarters—a manual that could rapidly enhance one's strength.  

Desperate, the original owner rushed to search and, incredibly, found it.  

Gu Mo frowned as he read the diary entry. Something about this felt off. Digging through the cabinet, he found the so-called manual.  

**"Soul Refining Art!"**  

The name sounded impressive, but flipping through its pages revealed horrifying content—instructions on refining one's soul by devouring living spirits. Though new to cultivation, Gu Mo recognized this as anything but orthodox.  

From the diary, the Qinglu Sect didn't seem like an evil organization. If a disciple practiced such a vile technique, discovery would mean certain death.  

It was clear now—someone had set up the original owner. But why target a menial disciple who hadn't even achieved qi absorption? The diary showed no signs of personal grudges.  

The entries ended abruptly after obtaining the Soul Refining Art. Clearly, the original owner had attempted it, only to scatter his own soul—paving the way for Gu Mo's arrival.
