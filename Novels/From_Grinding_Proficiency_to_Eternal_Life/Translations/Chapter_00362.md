# Chapter 362: Outer Realm Demons

Dugu Jiu sighed. He naturally didn't believe what Xu Yunfan said. This young man before him was definitely hiding some heaven-shaking method.

He suddenly recalled how, three hundred years ago, when he fought the various sects atop Kunlun's peak, he had also deceived his opponents with such nonchalant ease.

The truths hidden between the lines pierced his spine like icicles.

If this brat hadn't even used ten percent of his full power... The old man's hunched back bent even further. The competitive spirit that had been surging within him was now like dying embers, unwilling to retain even a trace of warmth.

"Land Immortal Realm..."

Dugu Jiu suddenly began to cough violently. The myriad thoughts in his heart had completely faded into desolation, his figure appearing somewhat forlorn. "This old body of mine, rotting away like this, would be better off seeking a life-extending pill."

As he turned, his black robes fluttered noisily, like a withered leaf drifting beyond the palace walls. His hoarse final words scattered in the twilight: "Congratulations. The one and only Land Immortal in this world."

At that moment, Xu Yunfan subconsciously focused his attention on his brow. A blood-red vertical line had appeared there. As his thoughts concentrated on it, he felt a burning heat in his brow, as if a scorching烙铁 were pressing against his forehead.

He subconsciously raised his hand to touch his brow. His fingertip touched a raised vertical line, which was throbbing beneath his skin, pulsing slightly as if it had a life of its own.

With a slight movement of his mind, that vertical line suddenly split open, revealing a scarlet-red pupil!

In an instant, the entire imperial palace appeared completely different in his vision.

Every crack in the palace wall's bricks was clearly visible. The falling leaves in the distance seemed to freeze in mid-air. He could even clearly see the trembling of an ant's antennae three zhang away.

Even more wondrous was that the sword qi flowing around the departing Dugu Jiu in the distance transformed into countless silver threads in his eyes. And the myriad possible trajectories extending from these threads were all clearly reflected in that blood-red pupil.

"Martial Dao Divine Ability?!"

Sensing Xu Yunfan's anomaly, Dugu Jiu turned his head. The sight of those scarlet eyes met his gaze. He was so startled he took a half-step back. The longsword in his hand rang with a "zheng" as it instantly gathered the dissolving sword qi around him.

This Sword Dao master was actually unable to control his own lifebound sword artifact, which was enough to show the shock in his heart.

As a martial artist who had immersed himself in the Dao for over a century, Dugu Jiu instantly recognized Xu Yunfan's current state.

Dugu Jiu felt both envy and jealousy in his heart. This was what could be called divinity in the Martial Dao.

"It is said that only when one breaks through to the Land Immortal Realm is there a chance to awaken a Martial Dao Divine Ability..."

Xu Yunfan did not answer.

He was currently immersed in an unprecedentedly wondrous state. The vertical pupil saw not only the present, but, by gathering the countless auras of heaven and earth and observing various pheromones, it seemed as if countless fragments of the future were flashing past like a lantern show.

Three breaths later, a tile would fall from the southeast corner of the palace eaves. Seven breaths later, Dugu Jiu's left hand would unconsciously stroke his sword hilt out of habit. Even thirteen breaths later, the bronze bell at the Imperial Observatory three li away would be stirred by the wind, issuing a deep, dull hum...

"So that's how it is."

Understanding the situation in advance, predicting the changes in an opponent's attack moves, and being able to gather the vast flow of information within a hundred zhang radius to pry into the secrets of heaven, thereby finding a sliver of life in a desperate situation.

This was a supreme divine ability that could only be awakened at the Land Immortal Realm. In life-and-death battles, it could often reverse the situation and turn death into life.

It had an unimaginably great use in combat.

As that blood-red vertical pupil opened and closed, the flow of qi around the opponent's entire body was completely visible.

The faint trajectories of true energy surging through flesh and blood, the signs of muscle fiber contraction, and even the fluctuations of killing intent in the subconscious mind, all transformed into myriad clearly visible threads.

With just one glance, Xu Yunfan could see through all the possible variations of his opponent's next seven steps, like a spectator peering at the entire chess game in advance.

An even more wondrous aspect was that the Eye of Heaven could perceive the auspicious and ominous auras in the ethereal void.

When a fatal crisis was about to descend, his brow would definitely send a burning warning. And every terrain change that could be exploited, every fleeting opportunity for a counterattack, would shimmer with a faint golden halo in his vision.

Even if surrounded on all sides, he could still find that one fleeting thread of opportunity.

Xu Yunfan gently stroked the vertical pupil. The blood-red line slowly closed, ultimately leaving only a fine line as thin as a hair.

This was his trump card; he couldn't reveal it easily.

He turned to the utterly horrified Dugu Jiu, the corner of his mouth curling into a meaningful smile: "It seems what awaits us at the Martial Arts Tower is far more interesting than that old hag just now."

Dugu Jiu suddenly realized that after Xu Yunfan closed that诡异 (strange/diabolical) blood-red eye, he couldn't clearly remember its specific appearance at all.

Just as a mortal cannot look directly at the sun, for certain existences that transcend cognition, even memory will instinctively choose to forget.

His Adam's apple bobbed as he said hoarsely, "That eye of yours..."

"It's just able to see some interesting things."

Xu Yunfan lightly tapped the ground with his Darksteel hammer handle. The palace wall's bricks and stones suddenly resonated with a specific frequency, and indeed, the hum of a bronze bell came from the distance in response.

He looked up at the flying eaves of the Martial Arts Tower. A broken tile fell at that exact moment, shattering to pieces on the bluestone slabs.

Dugu Jiu followed his gaze toward the Martial Arts Tower.

Xu Yunfan's voice suddenly pierced through the evening breeze, carrying a touch of melodiousness.

"Senior Dugu, please stay a moment."

Dugu Jiu, who was standing atop the city wall, paused slightly. His wide sleeves drew a half-arc in the wind.

Having suppressed the shock in his heart, his expression quickly calmed. He raised his brow slightly: "What you want? What are you referring to?"

"That old hag will stop at nothing to extend her life."

Xu Yunfan lightly tapped the Darksteel hammer handle of the Mountain Shaker, Ocean Calmer with his finger. A dull metallic vibration echoed on the palace wall: "The Imperial Observatory has spent decades collecting rare treasures from all over the world. That old hag has stopped at nothing to extend her life. The complete text of the 'Ten Thousand Chariots Transformation Sword' is probably hidden in the Martial Arts Tower, not to mention those life-extending pills refined with Nine Nether Cold Spring."

Dugu Jiu's expression trembled slightly.

He had just realized that he had been completely captivated by the game of moves between Xu Yunfan and the various forces, forgetting that this Great Zhou Imperial Court, which had accumulated for hundreds of years, was itself a treasure trove. Deep within those halls and pavilions, there might very well be the opportunity for him to break through the shackles of his Sword Dao.

Now, with Xu Yunfan's invitation, his spirits lifted slightly. Although he knew that Xu Yunfan was definitely plotting something by keeping him here, the other party had already entered the Land Immortal Realm. If he were to leave regardless, the next second might very well be Xu Yunfan's fist flying at him.

Dugu Jiu was just about to accept Xu Yunfan's invitation when, suddenly, the pile of charred flesh that Xu Yunfan had hammered into a paste on the platform began to tremble violently.

The flesh and blood, like boiling mud, bulged with fist-sized bubbles on the surface, which then burst, splashing foul-smelling black blood.

"Hm?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. The handle of the hammer in his hand turned slightly, its head slanting toward the ground.

A fissure suddenly split open in the center of that pool of flesh and blood, like a giant mouth from the abyss opening wide.

A pale hand reached out from the crack. The fingers were long and slender, the nails a诡异 (strange/diabolical) purple-black color.
