# Chapter 2: Spirit Hoe, The Second Equipment

Early morning.

The Golden Crow had just risen, a sliver of morning light piercing through the clouds and slipping through the window, landing on Zhang Yan and illuminating him with a radiant glow, making him appear sacred and inviolable, like a banished immortal.

His eyelashes fluttered slightly, and he opened his eyes, exhaling a breath of turbid air. Zhang Yan's eyes seemed even brighter.

"One night of practice, and only a wisp of spiritual energy has increased. I wonder how long it will take to become a true Qi Condensation realm cultivator." Although he had cultivated all night, Zhang Yan wasn't tired at all; in fact, he felt refreshed.

Especially as he felt a trace of warm air circulating within his body, he grew even more excited.

Qi Condensation cultivation.

To enter the Qi Condensation realm, one must absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, refine it into spiritual power, and then open up acupoints and meridians. The human body has twelve major meridians, and with each one opened, one's strength increases.

When all twelve meridians are opened, that signifies Great Perfection of Qi Condensation. Because all twelve major meridians are open, connecting the entire body, one's strength will be immeasurably higher than that of an ordinary Qi Condensation realm cultivator.

Currently, Zhang Yan had achieved Qi Condensation like a thread. According to his current progress, he might become a true Qi Condensation cultivator in less than half a year.

*Bang, bang, bang*

Just as he was pondering, a knocking sound came from outside the door.

"Time to get to work!"

When speaking of this, Old Lin's eyes lit up, and his tone became a bit more lively. "Inner disciples!"

Zhang Yan's face showed an envious expression.

This wasn't faked.

He was truly envious.

The Qingheng Sect's disciples were divided into outer disciples, inner disciples, and true disciples.

If the sect were likened to a company, then elders and deacons were the managers, gaining substantial benefits. True disciples were like management trainees, cultivated with all the sect's resources.

Inner disciples were the company's middle management; the upper echelons ate meat, and they drank the soup.

As for outer disciples, they were the most basic employees.

They did the hardest, most tiring work, and received the fewest benefits.

In fact, they received no benefits at all; a company at least pays wages. But as outer disciples, the sect not only didn't pay them, it even exploited them.

For example, seventy percent of their year-long hard work in the spirit plant garden had to be handed over to the sect; only the remaining thirty percent was theirs.

From this, it was clear that for the Qingheng Sect, true disciples were their utmost priority, inner disciples were left to develop somewhat independently – it was good if they succeeded, but no big deal if they didn't.

And outer disciples, like Zhang Yan, were purely objects of exploitation.

Yet, tragically, even so, many people didn't even qualify to be exploited.

"These weeds grow quite similarly to spirit rice; if one doesn't carefully distinguish them, it's very easy to mistake them." Saying this, Old Lin casually pulled out two weeds from the spirit field.

"These weeds absorb spiritual energy. After you pluck them, be sure to throw them by the roadside, not back into the spirit field. Otherwise, they'll regrow in just one night."

"Yes, Old Lin!" Zhang Yan nodded.

He then reached out to pull a weed.

"Hmm?"

The weed wasn't tall, but Zhang Yan pulled it several times with force and still couldn't dislodge it.

"The roots of these weeds often dig dozens of meters deep. You won't pull them out like that. Just use this hoe to cut them." Seeing this, Old Lin patted the storage bag at his waist.

Then, a hoe appeared in his hand, which he handed to Zhang Yan.

"Thank you, Old Lin." Zhang Yan sighed, remarking on the wonder of this cultivation world.

Even a mere weed could stump him.
