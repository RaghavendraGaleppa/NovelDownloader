# Chapter 190: Qu Junhou's Invitation

Time slipped away unnoticed.

On the arena.

Zhang Jing stood with his hands behind his back, his gaze calm.

A moment later, as if sensing movement, he turned his head to the side.

In his view, at the center of the vast arena, a graceful figure silently appeared, hovering just three feet above the ground. A silver bell gently swayed at her delicate ankle, emitting a faint, melodious sound.

Her ethereal and aloof aura was mixed with a hint of majesty and playfulness.

At times, she resembled a spirit wandering between heaven and earth; at others, a goddess descending into the world.

Complex and ever-changing, like the mist that veiled her face.

Layer upon layer, making it impossible to see clearly.

As if sensing something, Chang Jin turned to face Zhang Jing and nodded slightly.

Faintly, Zhang Jing seemed to see a pair of smiling eyes, bright as the moon.

He smiled and nodded in response.

Tap, tap—

A soft footstep suddenly reached his ears.

Growing closer.

"Brother Qu is coming up," Zhang Jing said softly without turning his head.

He didn't even need to guess.

At this time, the only person who could appear on the arena besides his opponent, Qu Junhou, was no one else.

"Haha, I haven't congratulated Brother Zhang on his victory over Ji Changyu! Now, you're only one step away from being the best in the Foundation Establishment Realm."

Qu Junhou's figure slowly appeared beside Zhang Jing, congratulating him.

His expression was calm.

"Brother Qu is too kind, but... the last step? Brother Qu, have you forgotten about yourself?" Zhang Jing jokingly asked.

Hearing this, Qu Junhou shook his head, a self-deprecating smile on his face.

"Brother Zhang is joking. In terms of strength, Junhou is far inferior to you. I won't embarrass myself."

"A gentleman helps others achieve their goals. Besides, Brother Zhang, you have a big battle ahead. Why not use this time to adjust yourself?"

"Brother Qu, you—"

Zhang Jing looked at him in surprise.

He didn't expect Qu Junhou to make this decision.

If Zhang Jing remembered correctly, due to the protection of the Secret Realm Spirit, no one had voluntarily given up during this month-long ranking battle.

The reason he would do this...

Thinking of this, a smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face.

"Brother Qu, you're making me owe you another favor."

"Brother Zhang, there's no need to take it to heart. Anyway, there's a gap between our strengths. Junhou is just going with the flow."

As he spoke, a confident look suddenly appeared on Qu Junhou's face.

"But... Brother Zhang," he said, his fiery gaze meeting Zhang Jing's calm eyes, "I'm only admitting defeat temporarily. In the future, when we reach the Dharma Idol Realm or even the Dao Integration Realm, we'll compete again!"

"Haha, I'll be waiting at any time. I certainly won't disappoint Brother Qu then."

Zhang Jing smiled slightly.

His gentle words revealed an undeniable confidence.

"By the way, Brother Zhang, I know a place with great opportunities. After you advance to the Golden Core Divine Power Realm, why don't we explore it together?"

Qu Junhou seemed to think of something and looked at Zhang Jing with anticipation.

"A place with great opportunities?"

Zhang Jing's eyes widened slightly.

...

At this moment, in Qu Junhou's sea of consciousness, a fragmented, ancient figure quietly emerged.

"Yes! That's right. The more geniuses enter that place, the greater your harvest will be, my disciple. Not just you, but also those who share the opportunity with you."

"The stronger the talent... the better..."

His voice carried a subtle hint of bewitchment.

...

On the other side, a rainbow light gently landed on the adjacent arena, transforming into Ji Changyu's figure in a dark golden dragon robe.

As soon as he landed, he looked solemnly at the ethereal figure opposite him, his heart tightening.

After losing to Zhang Jing, this battle became his last hope.

If he won, he could still retain a chance to compete for the top spot in the Foundation Establishment Realm; if he lost, he would be directly eliminated.

The Heavenly Gift Divine Power, the Auspicious Clouds of the Sun, would no longer have anything to do with him.

Thinking of this, Ji Changyu's eyes narrowed slightly, and he took a deep breath.

"This battle, I can only win, not lose!"

He warned himself again and again, his vigilance raised to the highest level.

"Please enlighten me, Daoist friend!"

Chang Jin's crisp, melodious voice, tinged with majesty, rang out.

"Please enlighten me!"

Ji Changyu said in a deep voice.

As soon as his voice fell, a vast and scorching aura burst forth from his body, spreading in all directions.

Then, wisps of Human Dao True Flame emerged from his nostrils, instantly gathering into a vast ocean lake.

Crimson-gold firelight illuminated the sky.

The terrifying and oppressive aura even made the surrounding tens or hundreds of miles of space become silent.

At this moment, under Ji Changyu's full power, the power of the Human Dao True Flame was more than ten times stronger than when he fought Zhang Jing before.

The difference between the two was so great.

On the one hand, the circumstances were different.

On the other hand, it was because Ji Changyu knew Chang Jin's identity and did not dare to be careless.

On the other side of Ji Changyu, scanning the terrifying crimson-gold divine fire that was rapidly spreading towards her, Chang Jin not only did not panic, but her aura became even more tranquil.

In an instant, the light dimmed.

Rays of bright moonlight reflected around Chang Jin.

Then, these moonlights began to spread and expand outwards, becoming faster and faster.

Wherever it passed, the overbearing and scorching Human Dao True Flame retreated.

For a time, the arena seemed to be divided into two completely different worlds by some force.

One was brightly lit by the moon, peaceful and quiet; the other was covered in flames, like purgatory.

"That is—"

Ji Changyu, surrounded by crimson-gold divine flames, suddenly turned his head, his gaze fixed on the illusory bright moon above Chang Jin's head.

In just three to five breaths, the raging crimson-gold divine fire on the arena had completely disappeared.

A white light flashed.

Ji Changyu's figure disappeared again.

Throughout the entire battle.

He seemed to have no power to resist.

...

On the viewing platform in the outer space of the Proud Cloud Secret Realm.

A moment ago, many cultivators were still arguing about who was better, their ears filled with noisy and enthusiastic discussions.

But in an instant.

These voices all disappeared.

Those present couldn't help but fall into a daze, their eyes filled with confusion, as if they couldn't believe what they had just seen.

The prince of the Immortal Dao lineage, the Human Sovereign Dao Court, the true pride of the human race, was defeated by the woman from the Myriad Heavens and Spirits camp without even lasting a single move!

"Hehe, I must be dreaming, right?"

"Didn't they say that the three were equally strong? How could..."

"Alas~ It seems I was too happy too soon. How can the human race in the Foundation Establishment Realm compare to those terrifying races from the Myriad Heavens and Spirits camp?!"

"Don't be discouraged, isn't there still a genius from the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect? He also defeated..."

Someone wanted to use Zhang Jing, who had also defeated Ji Changyu, to boost their confidence.

But as they spoke.

Their voice became smaller and smaller.
