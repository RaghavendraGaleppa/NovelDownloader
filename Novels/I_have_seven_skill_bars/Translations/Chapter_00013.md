# Chapter 13: Harvest Rewards

Senior Brother Mu turned around, looking at Liu Yun, Ding Rui, and the others. He continued, "Which one of you is Junior Brother Ding Rui? Step forward so I can get to know you."

Liu Yun's face lit up, and without a word, he immediately pulled Ding Rui out from the crowd.

Ding Rui promptly bowed to the outer sect senior brother. "Greetings, Senior Brother Mu. I am Ding Rui from spiritual field 377."

Senior Brother Mu observed Ding Rui for several breaths, then exclaimed, "Good! Junior Brother Ding's talent is a joyous occasion for our Profound Talisman Sect. As a senior brother, I naturally wouldn't be stingy towards such a genius disciple. After forming your Foundation, which hall do you plan to join? I can offer you some help in advance."

Old Huang, Liu Yun, and the others were all genuinely happy for Ding Rui upon hearing this.

Since Senior Brother Mu had said so, the help he could offer Ding Rui would definitely not be small; at the very least, it would be a large quantity of cultivation resources. One must know, the good things available to outer sect disciples were immeasurably more abundant than what spiritual field cultivators had access to.

Ding Rui's heart was also stirred. After thinking for a moment, he said, "Thank you, Senior Brother, but I don't intend to quickly form my Foundation right now. Instead, I plan to first cultivate all five-element cultivation methods and become a spiritual farmer!"

"This is a reward for Junior Brother's contribution to the sect's resource output, and it is also our hope that Junior Brother will continue his efforts and make even more contributions to the sect. The sect will certainly not mistreat any disciple!" Senior Brother Mu spoke with righteous words, earnest and solemn.

After another round of polite exchanges.

Senior Brother Mu finally got down to business.

He stood by the spiritual field, extended his hand, and cast out a golden light. The light immediately surged in the air, transforming into a blade tens of meters long. With a sweep through the spiritual field, the tall spiritual rice stalks were severed cleanly at their base. Then Senior Brother Mu cast another golden light, which formed a net. It gathered all the severed rice ears that hadn't yet fallen to the ground, collecting them into the net. Once full, the net automatically descended to the ground nearby. Senior Brother Mu then conjured the next net, proceeding calmly and in an orderly fashion. In just over ten breaths, the entire spiritual field was neatly harvested, leaving only a field of rice stalks of uniform length, ready to be buried and decompose into nutrients for the next season's spiritual rice.

"This is a materialization talisman, a basic application of True Essence and spiritual energy. Senior Brother Mu is using a talisman treasure, which can be used multiple times until the inscribed array's material can no longer support it and shatters."

"Refining talisman treasures..."

Liu Yun, who was knowledgeable, explained to Ding Rui and the others beside him.

Ding Rui watched, dumbfounded, and the others were equally filled with longing.

"Senior Brother Mu traveled all this way to our spiritual field 377. It seems he truly thinks highly of Little Ding."

"That's normal. We also have Senior Disciple Brother in our spiritual field."

"Our spiritual field 377 can even be considered the strongest spiritual field in the sect now, right! Hahahaha..."

Everyone was overjoyed to receive such a large amount of resource rewards. This time, everyone in spiritual field 377 received at least thirty thousand grains. These resources were entirely sufficient for their cultivation for several months.

"It might not be the strongest spiritual field right now, but it won't be long until it definitely becomes the strongest!" Old Huang gazed at the sacks of spiritual rice piled on the courtyard ground, his eyes gleaming as if light was about to shoot out of them.

"Old Huang, are these thirty thousand grains enough for you to break through?" Ding Rui couldn't help but ask.
