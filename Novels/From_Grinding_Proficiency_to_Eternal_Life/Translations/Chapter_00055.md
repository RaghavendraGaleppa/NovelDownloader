# Chapter 55: The Golden Blade

A piercing shriek tore through the night curtain. Fengzi stumbled backward, snapping a dead branch three paces away.

The moonlight,欲遮欲掩 (trying to hide yet unable to resist), illuminated his distorted face. The Phoenix Beak Fist that had once pierced through bluestone was now curled at an unnatural angle, the ring finger jutting out with a stark white bone spur.

Dark red blood drops trickled down the twisted fingertips, splattering onto the snow pile and blooming into clusters of blood-red plum blossoms.

Xu Yunfan lowered his gaze and swept it over a few specks of blood staining his lapel, his brow slightly furrowed. This outfit was one he had bought for the first time; he remembered that the remains of that suspected true immortal almost got taken away along with the fur.

The scream finally drew Jin Shu’s group.

Rustling footsteps swept over the snowy ridge ahead, and seven black shadows swooped onto the ridge like screech owls.

Leading the charge, Jin Shu’s nine-ringed sword with its gilded mouth guard hummed and trembled. The Chi Xie beast patterns carved into the blade flowed with strange golden threads under the moonlight.

“Hold it!”

In the thunderous roar, the entire dead forest instantly shook, causing countless snowflakes to fall. The long sword was drawn from its scabbard, the nine golden rings producing a soul-shaking vibration.

When the blade light flared, it was like a golden river reversing its flow. A golden blade shone brilliantly in the night, instantly tearing through the lonely darkness. The long wind howled, the sword moved like a dragon and snake, and before the blade even arrived, the oncoming sharpness made Xu Yunfan’s pupils contract involuntarily.

He subconsciously pushed his Copper Body Technique to its peak. Under the extreme activity of his blood energy, his skin took on a bronze hue, yet he still felt his hair stand on end from the oncoming fierce wind.

His heart skipped a beat.

This blade... it probably isn't a mortal weapon.

Xu Yunfan didn't have time to exert force with his fingers; he reversed his grip and grabbed the head, using it like a baton, dragging Fengzi’s entire body to迎向 (meet) that golden blade.

Xu Yunfan’s knuckles hadn't even exerted force yet when he suddenly felt the head of Fengzi in his palm violently tremble.

Still resisting?

His five fingers were like iron, clamping down on Fengzi’s skull. He actually swung this seven-foot man through the air like a human weapon, whistling as he slammed him toward the golden blade's edge.

Seeing this, Jin Shu naturally dared not strike down. When the blade was only half an inch from Fengzi’s throat, he forcibly deflected it.

The nine-ringed sword scraped past the hostage’s shoulder blade, slicing off half a piece of blood-stained lapel.

The force hadn't been fully spent; a large pile of snow mixed with mud was kicked up by the long sword, scattering around like a celestial maiden scattering flowers.

He flipped his wrist, turning the golden blade in his hand. He twisted his foot, pivoting on the ball of his foot and rotating his waist, spinning in place. He卸掉了 (unloaded) the impact force and stepped back to withdraw.

The entire sequence of movements was fluid and effortless, with power fully under control.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes lit up, and he couldn't help but praise, “Even the strength thrown out can be retracted and guided back.”

He asked.

“Bone and flesh perfected, Second-Rank Martial Master?”

Xu Yunfan looked at Jin Shu standing not far away, the long sword pointing diagonally at the ground, his eyes narrowing slightly. He stood like a sculpture, his breathing seemingly imperceptible.

He glanced at the prompt for *Swift Legs* that floated out in his vision.

*‘When facing a formidable enemy, you utilized the发力 (power generation) of Swift Legs, driving your core muscle groups to amplify your speed. Swift Legs proficiency has increased.’*

Just earlier in the stone bridge snow forest, fighting those iron-faced men, not a single hint of increased proficiency had appeared.

It seemed it had to be an opponent of the same level.

Xu Yunfan’s thoughts raced like lightning. The other party was蓄力 (gathering strength); once Xu Yunfan showed the slightest lapse, he would face a earth-shattering slash.

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s cold evaluation, Jin Shu’s gaze sharpened. He could clearly see the bulging muscles on Xu Yunfan’s body, the blue veins interlaced and ferocious like countless green snakes.

“A Second-Rank Martial Master with flesh and skin perfected. In a small northern border city, that is quite rare.”

Xu Yunfan didn't reply. His gaze simply shifted, sizing up the weapon in Jin Shu’s hand—a blade resembling a Yanling sword.

The blade as a whole presented an elegant curve, extending slowly from the hilt to the tip. The arc was just right, extremely suitable for劈砍 (chopping and slashing).

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flashed. His raised arm seemed cast from molten steel; no matter how Fengzi struggled on his arm, it remained motionless.

This scene was seen by Jin Shu, and he knew in his heart that the other party was definitely not a simple Second-Rank Martial Master.

Fengzi had attacked his vitals, yet the other party didn't even lift an eyelid. He knew clearly that the other party was an extremely rare practitioner of external martial arts.

If not for the golden blade in his hand making the other party dare not硬接 (take head-on), Fengzi would already have his skull crushed by this man.

He held his sword and cupped his fist, saying in a deep voice, “Friend, we have no grievance or hatred. Why go this far? This kid was just out gathering firewood. His eyes only see firewood.”

Seeing Xu Yunfan remain silent, he turned his head and said, “We are merchants from the Changgu Prefecture of Qingzhou, the Chi family. We trade in Changgu silk fabrics and buy rare mountain goods unique to Jiyun Mountain to take back. We have no intention of lingering here. Rest assured, Sir.”

Xu Yunfan listened, staring at Jin Shu for a long time, making the latter’s hair stand on end, feeling that things might not end well.

Xu Yunfan casually tossed Fengzi aside.

“I was here first. If there is nothing else, please do not cross the line.”

Fengzi scrambled away, his face pale as he ran frantically to Jin Shu’s side. He looked at Xu Yunfan with both terror and fear. He had already walked through the gates of hell; if Jin Shu hadn't intervened in time, his soul would have ascended to heaven the moment Xu Yunfan’s large hand clamped down on his head.

“Thank you!”

Jin Shu cupped his fist, didn't stay any longer, and quickly led Fengzi away.

Xu Yunfan stood there for a long time before slowly gathering firewood. He lit a fire pile and slowly burned the black clothes stained with blood.

He wasn't a heartless or ruthless person. The other party had repeatedly submitted and expressed their stance; Xu Yunfan naturally understood they were just innocent people.

“Master Gong, will it be okay?”

Fengzi’s cold sweat soaked through three layers of linen cloth. The wooden wedge clenched between his teeth snapped in two.

“Bear with it!”

Master Gong’s snow-white eyebrows stood upright. His eagle-claw-like fingers pressed at the Sanyinjiao point on the wrist. The tip of the silver pliers was pulling out rice-grain-sized bone fragments from the bloody wound.

“You were just lucky to run into me.”

Master Gong carefully used the pliers to pick out the bone fragments from the wound, poured on a special secret medicine, and wrapped it tightly with gauze. He let out a light snort.

“If it were anyone else, not to mention ending up disabled, martial arts would be out of the question.”

Hearing this, Fengzi’s hanging heart immediately settled. He let out a long breath and turned his head, his face a mask of grief.

“Uncle Jin!”

Jin Shu heard this and shook his head slightly.

“First, rest and recover properly. This matter... this matter needs to be discussed at length. The other party is quite powerful, and we were in the wrong for being presumptuous first. This matter...”

Jin Shu sighed and shook his head slightly.

“Without this *Shattered Iron Blade* in hand, our entire caravan would have had a hard time getting away safely today.”

Fengzi heard this and didn't speak anymore. He just trembled from time to time, letting Master Gong bandage his injury.

Not far away, behind a large tree, Xu Yunfan stood quietly. Hearing that they were no longer discussing this matter, just letting out occasional groans of pain pulled by their injuries.
