## Chapter 67: Crisis

Sitting in the dimly lit room, Li Zhiming stared at Han Kesi with a mix of emotions. "You?" he said, slightly stunned, before elbowing Han Kesi in the ribs. The blow felt substantial, and Han Kesi winced but remained standing, his expression momentarily unnatural. 

Li Zhiming spoke sincerely, "Don't worry, I'll ask the sect leader to send some reliable and experienced people to accompany you." Han Kesi nodded, still rubbing his sore ribs. Li Zhiming couldn't leave; the Qixuan Sect needed him. Over the years, Han Kesi had watched Li Zhiming grow and mature within the sect.

As Li Zhiming turned away, Han Kesi called out, "You kid..." Li Zhiming's departure left him feeling envious; he could roam freely, while Li Zhiming's movements were restricted. The Qixuan Sect couldn't function without him. For the first time, Li Zhiming realized that sometimes the constraints on a person weren't necessarily physical or malicious but could still limit their freedom. A moment of distraction could turn into a lifetime, and one could lose the chance to explore the vast world.

Han Kesi spoke, "The letter from Lan州 implies that the situation is urgent. It's better to leave sooner rather than later. I'll depart tomorrow." Li Zhiming responded with a soft "En" without turning back. 

Han Kesi looked at Li Zhiming's back, his eyes filled with a mix of emotions, but he kept his words to himself, bowed his head, and left the study. The sound of his footsteps faded into the distance before Li Zhiming let out a silent sigh.

This peculiar feeling settled in on a sunny day, where parting ways was inevitable. Both Li Zhiming and Han Kesi were rational individuals who knew what needed to be done, but their emotions wouldn't dissipate with rational thinking.

Li Zhiming glanced at his命格,【Martial Arts Master】, which was half-white and half-green. He fell silent, contemplating his situation. He realized that a person's命格 had an upper limit. Without special opportunities, he couldn't change his fate. His martial arts skills had reached their limit, and he couldn't progress further.

If he hadn't met Han Kesi at the Qixuan Sect, would he have ever encountered a cultivator? The world was vast, and the chances of meeting someone like Han Kesi were slim. Even if he did, could they have become close?

The harsh reality was that Han Kesi was the only cultivator Li Zhiming had met. Their parting would only mean the end of this opportunity for Li Zhiming, leaving him a ordinary person once again.

" This damn world," Li Zhiming muttered, kicking a chair and walking away.

The letter from Lan州 was just a minor event, but it signified Han Kesi's impending departure. The valley would become a lonely place for Li Zhiming. He spent the afternoon lost in thought. Even during dinner, he was distracted, mechanically picking at his food.

Han Kesi seemed calm, eating quietly, but it was unusual for him to not engage in conversation. Li Zhiming was usually talkative, but tonight he was subdued.

The next day, a knight arrived at the valley, announcing that the young disciples, including Li Zhiming, were to gather for a ceremony to mark their coming of age. They would choose which peak to join and begin their journey as junior disciples.

Li Zhiming realized that time had passed quickly; he had been at the Qixuan Sect for over six years. The young disciples were now grown, and it was time for them to take on responsibilities.

"I'll accompany you to see the sect leader tomorrow and ask him to assign some experienced disciples to follow you," Li Zhiming said to Han Kesi.

As night fell, Li Zhiming strolled through the valley, contemplating his situation. He met a knight who informed him of the ceremony and departed.

In a different part of the valley, Su Zongguang, with a flattering smile, stood beside a short, ugly man with a growth on his face. "Your Excellency, I've secured an understanding with the imperial court. They will turn a blind eye to the Qixuan Sect's matters."

The ugly man, Jin Guang, finally stretched, relieved that the wait was almost over. Two years of negotiations had passed, and he was eager to demonstrate his abilities.

Su Zongguang nodded repeatedly, "The people are assembled, Your Excellency."

Jin Guang smiled coldly, "Watch closely, and you'll see true cultivator techniques tomorrow."

Su Zongguang's expression remained subservient, "Yes, yes, I will."

As the night deepened, Li Zhiming couldn't shake off the feeling of melancholy. He walked through the valley, surrounded by the sounds of crickets, lost in thought. The parting with Han Kesi loomed ahead, and the valley would soon be quiet once more.
