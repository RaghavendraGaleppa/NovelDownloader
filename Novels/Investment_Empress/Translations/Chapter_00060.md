Chapter 60: "Does Brother Li Want to Have a Baby with Me?!"

Three days later, the carriage that had brought them to the Murong residence was still parked outside the gate. The porridge shop was still open, and many of the Murong family members had come out to bid farewell.

"Xiao'er, make sure to train well with Li Xiaoyou, understood?" Muriok Hai, standing at the gate with his hands behind his back, looked more like an ordinary old man than a stern elder.

"Yes, grandfather," Murong Xiao replied, nodding seriously.

He looked around and scratched his head. "Where's Brother Li?"

"I've arrived," a voice came on the wind.

Murong Xiao turned around to see Li Mo standing on the carriage, his robes fluttering gently in the breeze.

"Wind Shadow Step?" Murong Xiao was taken aback. "How did Brother Li learn our family's superior stepping technique?"

"I taught it to Li Xiaoyou just three days ago," Murong Hai said, shaking his head in amazement.

Li Mo had clearly mastered the technique in a short time, and Murong Hai was impressed.

As they said their goodbyes, Li Mo waved to Murong Hai and the others. The carriage slowly began to move, and the people on the roadside, including beggars and refugees, looked up at the carriage with a glimmer of hope in their eyes. They knew that Li Mo, the benevolent man, had promised to continue running the charity hall even after he left.

As the carriage drove away, Li Mo heard the voices of thanks from the people on the roadside. It was the first time he had been seen as a beacon of hope by so many people, and he felt a strange emotion stirring in his chest.

After a while, Li Mo told the carriage driver to head to Mud Corner Lane.

When they arrived, Li Mo saw that the residents were busy, and the atmosphere was no longer gloomy. Li Mo had visited them every day for the past three days, cooking for them and helping them.

The children were delighted to see Li Mo and eagerly awaited his arrival. Jiang Chu Long, still looking like a "flower cat" with her dirty face, greeted Li Mo shyly.

Li Mo began to cook, and Jiang Chu Long offered to help with the chopping. Li Mo handed her the Chi Xiao sword, which she used to chop the vegetables with surprising dexterity.

Murong Xiao was shocked to see the precious sword being used as a kitchen knife. "Isn't this... inconvenient?" he stuttered.

Jiang Chu Long also seemed uncertain, but Li Mo just smiled.

After the meal was prepared, Li Mo called Jiang Chu Long aside and handed her a deed to the abandoned residence. "This is the property deed. You're no longer refugees or beggars; you're the owners of this place."

Jiang Chu Long was taken aback, but she carefully folded the deed and stored it in her pouch.

Li Mo then handed her the ancient ring, which he had modified to contain a "backdoor" to the world's energy.

Jiang Chu Long's eyes widened as she accepted the ring. In her mind, a ring was a symbol of betrothal, and accepting it meant that she was committed to the person who gave it to her. She thought that Li Mo was proposing to her and that they would have a baby soon.

Li Mo, oblivious to Jiang Chu Long's thoughts, simply said that the ring was a gift from someone else.

Jiang Chu Long's face turned red, and she seemed to be in a daze. Li Mo waved his hand in front of her face, confused.

"L-Brother Li... this is..." Jiang Chu Long stuttered.

Li Mo quickly passed the responsibility to Bing Tuotuo, saying that the ring was from him.

Jiang Chu Long's expression changed, and she seemed a bit disappointed.

As Li Mo prepared to leave, Jiang Chu Long suddenly called out to him. "Brother Li, wait!"

Li Mo turned around, and Jiang Chu Long said, "You haven't seen my real face yet."
