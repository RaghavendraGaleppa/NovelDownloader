# Chapter 178: A Demon in Body, a Saint at Heart  

"Ha!"  

"Ho!"  

Shadows of trees swayed in the forest as hundreds of people, drenched in sweat, practiced martial arts with intense focus.  

A young man in red robes, the "Martial Instructor," walked among them, occasionally correcting someone's posture. Meticulous and dedicated, he spared no effort in teaching the younger generation of his family, holding nothing back.  

The cultivators panted heavily, their robes soaked with sweat.  

The younger ones fared better, but the older ones, without their cultivation to rely on, struggled under the grueling training.  

Most cultivators didn't focus on physical training. Upon reaching the Golden Core stage, specialized methods would naturally temper their bodies into flawless golden forms. Training the body before that was often considered a waste of time and could even hinder future progress.  

Unless one practiced certain Buddhist or demonic arts that required physical conditioning to unlock hidden potentials or cast specific spells, there was little reason to focus on the body.  

Most body-refining techniques were trivial—even if mastered, could they withstand attacks from artifacts of the same level? Their defensive capabilities often paled in comparison to simple protective auras.  

Of course, the world was full of exceptions.  

Like Lin Shan.  

After refining the Void Star Disc and undergoing months of "Star Force Tempering" at the Eastern Sea's demonic headquarters, followed by further refinement in the Gongsun family's spiritual well, his strength, constitution, spirit, and charm had all improved significantly. His physical prowess far surpassed that of his peers.  

Coupled with his martial arts foundation and the nourishment of "Heavenly Dew" during the spiritual tide, his aptitude and comprehension had soared. He mastered the "Kun Fist" with ease, executing it with such power that even the passing Martial Instructor paused to watch, nodding in approval.  

"You're quite skilled. What's your name?"  

"Reporting to the Instructor, this junior is Lin Shan."  

"Excellent! You have a natural talent for martial arts. You've already grasped the essence of the fist technique—your comprehension is remarkable!"  

"You flatter me, Instructor. A garden flourishes due to the gardener's care. My modest achievements are all thanks to your guidance."  

Lin Shan responded humbly while subtly flattering the man. The other cultivators nearby inwardly cursed his shamelessness.  

The Martial Instructor, however, was pleased, his lips curling into a smile as he regarded Lin Shan with increasing favor.  

---  

When he passed by the Black Skeleton Demon Lord, however, his brow furrowed. If Lin Shan was the best among the group, this skeletal figure was undoubtedly the worst—loose, disjointed, and utterly lacking in vigor.  

"Who taught you to practice like this? The essence of Kun Fist lies in its momentum! Where is yours?"  

Under the Instructor's stern gaze, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord attempted the first stance, "Great Kun Spreads Its Wings," but lost balance upon landing.  

*Clatter!*  

*Bang! Thud! Roll!*  

His bones scattered across the ground, leaving only his skull bouncing around.  

The Martial Instructor sighed in exasperation. "Hopeless."  

After assessing everyone's progress, he promptly announced Lin Shan's promotion to leader of the group, tasked with guiding the others in his stead.  

In a sect, this would be equivalent to the position of head disciple.  

Envy flared among the crowd. How had this guy risen so quickly, becoming their superior in mere hours?  

The demonic cultivators accepted it—after all, Lin Shan was one of their own, a Foundation Establishment expert.  

The righteous cultivators, however, protested, demanding a separate leader for their faction.  

The Martial Instructor, straightforward and principled, insisted that only Lin Shan was qualified. A less skilled instructor would lead others astray, and the foundations of martial arts were too crucial to compromise.  

Defeated, the righteous cultivators could only hope Lin Shan wouldn't abuse his authority—and pray for rescue from their righteous elders.  

Their prayers seemed answered when a group of righteous cultivators soon appeared in the sky.  

Stunned by the sight of hundreds of people—both righteous and demonic—training together under a red-robed instructor, the leader, a Golden Core elder, nearly dropped his jaw.  

*Isn't that... Lei Yinzi, one of the Violet Thunder Sect's twin Nascent Soul seeds? What in the world is he doing?*  

The Martial Instructor ignored them, continuing his teachings.  

But the newcomers didn't leave. Instead, the Golden Core elder—a portly man—approached with a smile.  

"Brother Lei Yinzi, I am Pei Wei, an outer elder of the Beast Taming Valley. We met briefly at a sect exchange thirty years ago. What are you..."  

The Martial Instructor looked up, puzzled. "You must be mistaken, elder. I am not Lei Yinzi. I am merely instructing my juniors in martial arts."  

Pei Wei frowned, scrutinizing the man again.  

*This is definitely Lei Yinzi!*  

Just then, a Beast Taming Valley disciple below cried out, "Elder Pei! He's not Lei Yinzi anymore—he's been possessed by a demon!"  

The Martial Instructor's expression darkened. Snatching a branch, he struck the disciple sharply. "No distractions during training! This is your first warning!"  

Pei Wei was stunned. The disciple, however, scrambled behind him, wailing, "Elder, he's not himself! He's been replaced!"  

Other righteous cultivators, seeing their chance, also fled to Pei Wei's side, complaining bitterly about their mistreatment.  

Lin Shan and the demonic cultivators remained silent, though inwardly anxious. With the original Nascent Soul demon gone and only the Martial Instructor—a mere mortal—in control, would he even know how to wield his power if attacked?  

Pei Wei, after hearing their grievances, saw an opportunity. Capturing the possessed Lei Yinzi would not only earn him a demonic Nascent Soul but also the Violet Thunder Sect's gratitude.  

A win-win!  

---  

Without hesitation, Pei Wei moved to seize the "Martial Instructor."  

To everyone's shock, however, the Instructor—though once a mortal—had absorbed fragments of the Nascent Soul late-stage demon's memories and combat instincts.  

*Whoosh!*  

A surge of energy condensed into a giant hand, slamming Pei Wei to the ground, sealing his cultivation. His disciples met the same fate.  

Gasps filled the air.  

Pei Wei and his group regretted their impulsiveness. *Why hadn't they just left?*  

Unfazed, the Martial Instructor ordered the newcomers to join the training, assigning Lin Shan to teach them the Kun Fist.  

Lin Shan's heart raced as he faced Pei Wei—a Golden Core elder! *A demonic Foundation Establishment cultivator teaching a righteous Golden Core elder... martial arts?*  

Pei Wei whispered a warning, "Play along, boy. This farce will end once righteous Nascent Soul elders arrive. Cooperate now, and I might spare you later."  

Lin Shan glanced at the oblivious Instructor before hesitantly asking, "Can you guarantee my safety?"  

Pei Wei nodded. "Yes."  

"Could you... swear on it?"  

Pei Wei raised his hand. "I swear to the heavens."  

Lin Shan pressed further. "And on your Dao Heart?"  

Pei Wei's face darkened. "Don't push your luck."  

Lin Shan persisted. "It's just... heavenly oaths feel unreliable. A Dao Heart oath would be more binding."  

Pei Wei inwardly cursed the boy's cunning. A Dao Heart oath was no trivial matter—it tied directly to one's cultivation. Violating it could spell disaster.  

Still, he needed Lin Shan's cooperation. "Fine. But first, tell me—have you offended any major righteous sects or Golden Core experts?"  

Lin Shan listed his grudges: killing a Foundation Establishment overseer from the Cangxuan Sect, capturing the Young Master of the Autumn Maple Valley (who was later executed via boiling oil), and burning the Gongsun family's medicinal gardens.  

Pei Wei dismissed the first two as minor but hesitated at the third. The Gongsun family was a fence-sitter, but their losses were manageable.  

Then Lin Shan mentioned his biggest sin: killing Qi Zhong, a true disciple of the Cloud Soaring Pavilion—one of the three great righteous sects.  

Pei Wei's expression froze.  

*This kid... is a walking calamity!*  

Yet, upon learning Lin Shan's age (33), dual-element spiritual roots (Wind: Grade B, Thunder: Grade C), and non-demonic cultivation, Pei Wei's eyes gleamed with interest.  

*Such talent, wasted in the demonic path!*  

He proposed a solution: Lin Shan could join the Beast Taming Valley. As an inner disciple, the sect could shield him from the Cloud Soaring Pavilion's wrath.  

Lin Shan, thrilled at the prospect of redemption, eagerly pledged his loyalty. "Though my body resides in darkness, my heart yearns for the light. I vow to forsake evil and walk the righteous path!"  

Pei Wei, playing the benevolent elder, helped him up. "Repentance is never too late, child. From now on, do good and accumulate virtue."  

Just as Pei Wei prepared to swear the Dao Heart oath, one of his disciples intervened.  

"Master, wait! There's more. Rumor has it that the Cloud Soaring Pavilion's Qingyang Peak lineage—four Golden Core elders and all their disciples—perished in a spatial tunnel after a demonic envoy sabotaged their teleportation array at the Gongsun family..."  

Pei Wei's face drained of color as he turned to Lin Shan.  

*You... you caused the annihilation of an entire lineage?!*  

Lin Shan's mind blanked.  

*I... wiped out a branch of the Cloud Soaring Pavilion?*
