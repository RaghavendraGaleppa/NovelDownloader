# Chapter 119: The Mantis Stalks the Cicada, Unaware of the Oriole Behind  

The courtyard fell silent.  

Li Zhengjing's gaze was solemn as he stared at the Five Elements Creation Tree before him. The tree itself stood rigid, as if petrified, unmoving for a long while.  

The Wave-Severing Gu let out a cry and leaped onto its branches.  

"Second Brother? Why are you crying?"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree seemed dazed for a moment before reaching a branch to the back of its trunk, as if rubbing its head in confusion. "What just happened? How did I, a tree, even have a dream?"  

"What did you see in your dream?" Li Zhengjing asked, his tone serious.  

"A sword!"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree hesitated, its voice tinged with fear. "A sword pierced through the void, stirring the heavens, and then stabbed through a figure..." It waved its roots as it spoke. "That figure exuded supreme majesty. After the sword pierced him, I woke up."  

"Bold rebel! How dare you slay the Emperor?"  

Li Zhengjing frowned. "Why did you shout that?"  

The tree grew even more bewildered. "I don't know. The words just came out—I couldn't hold them back..."  

"Ha!"  

At that moment, the Wall-Clinging Bird flipped upright, landing on the ground with its claws spread wide in a firm stance. It brandished its wings like two broadswords and bellowed in a menacing tone, "Bold rebel! How dare you slay the Emperor?"  

"..."  

Silence filled the courtyard.  

Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *Old Yuan, what do you make of this?*  

Yuan Zhengfeng replied in a low voice, "I've never seen anything like this before, but ancient texts mention similar occurrences..."  

He paused before continuing, "The Tianqing Daoist of the Kunlun Immortal Sect is said to be the last recorded figure in history to have ascended to immortality. Before his ascension, it was said that a single drop of his blood could awaken spirits in rocks and grant sentience to plants..."  

The blood of the Lin Yuan Gao Clan clearly lacked such miraculous properties.  

But the blood of their ancestors—how many generations removed?  

From the earlier vision conjured when the White Phoenix clashed with their bloodline, it was clear that their progenitor was a true immortal!  

"Legends say that the blood of great beings contains spiritual essence," Yuan Zhengfeng said. "Even after countless generations, that essence lingers. These two—the bird and the tree—must have sensed the deepest imprint within that blood. Those words were an unshakable obsession embedded in their lineage..."  

"The Netherworld holds true gods, and the heavens house true immortals," Li Zhengjing mused. "Take the Netherworld's Lord of the Underworld—his divine jade preserves his soul, granting him boundless power far beyond mortal limits. Whether in lifespan or ability, he transcends this world. If he isn't a true god, what is?"  

Now, the maternal ancestors of the Gao Clan's bloodline, diluted over countless generations, still carried an unyielding obsession deep within.  

This surpassed even the divine marvels of the Tianqing Daoist—a being on the cusp of ascension!  

If this bloodline's origin wasn't that of a true immortal, what else could it be?  

"But if this truly is the bloodline of an immortal from the heavens, why did it descend to the mortal world?" Yuan Zhengfeng wondered. "This warrants further investigation. The Tianqing Daoist—the only figure in three thousand years confirmed to have ascended—was buried in the dust of the mortal realm. Even the Golden Ship of Salvation has concluded that no true immortals exist in the heavens... yet now, the bloodline of a true immortal appears..."  

His voice grew grave. "The true creditor—the so-called Patriarch of the Human Realm, the one you call the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord—he has severed the path to immortality in this world. He manipulates the greatest powers as if they were mere chess pieces..."  

"Old Yuan, are you suggesting he might not be of this world?" Li Zhengjing asked thoughtfully.  

"I suspect he may be a true immortal from the heavens, exiled to the mortal realm," Yuan Zhengfeng said.  

"That's speculation without evidence. Still, the Gao Clan's bloodline is worth investigating—but we'll do so after this matter is settled," Li Zhengjing said.  

"After this matter?" Yuan Zhengfeng understood immediately. "You've confirmed the anomaly in their bloodline, yet you still intend to protect them?"  

"I gave my word. As long as they cooperate, I'll ensure their survival. I won't go back on that," Li Zhengjing replied with a faint smile. "The imperial court wants to use them as bait to trap Gao Xuan. Truth be told... I have the same selfish motive."  

"Gao Xuan has already slain two imperial deities. His strength is formidable," Yuan Zhengfeng warned. "We may not be able to subdue him easily."  

"Whether we capture him or not isn't my concern."  

Li Zhengjing's eyes gleamed. "But the secret behind his newfound power—that interests me greatly..."  

He glanced at the golden page.  

Gao Xuan posed no life-threatening danger to him.  

But after devouring three hundred spirit mines from the Great Zhou treasury, the method to alter his fate had guided him to the southeastern coast.  

He already knew—Gao Xuan's newfound power was one of the keys to resolving the backlash of the Great Void Sword Qi!  

Perhaps it was the Supreme Unity Sword Refining Art, but more likely... it was the Heavenly Profound White Gold!  

He gazed at the fingernail-sized fragment of Heavenly Profound White Gold in his palm, piecing together the puzzle. *After consuming three hundred spirit mines, the method to change my fate led me here... I'll be waiting for you, Gao Xuan.*  

According to his fate, the moment he stepped into the Human Immortal realm, the backlash of the Great Void Sword Qi would tear through his body, leaving him a mutilated corpse.  

He was now at the peak of the True Qi realm.  

The next step—transcending mortality and ascending to the Human Immortal realm—was also the step that would lead to his demise.  

"But without taking this step, I remain bound to mortality. Worse... the Thousand Illusions Divine Lord may uncover the truth."  

Li Zhengjing clenched his fist. *Yet taking this step is no simple feat.*  

For cultivators, this step represented the pinnacle of their aspirations—transcending the mundane, surpassing mortal limits, and extending their lifespan by a thousand years!  

Though just a single step, crossing it was akin to a carp leaping through the Dragon Gate—the difference was like heaven and earth.  

Yet throughout history, countless cultivators at the peak of the True Qi realm had been trapped at this threshold. Many came from the greatest sects, armed with supreme techniques, yet they exhausted their lives without ever breaking through.  

Take Chen Zhu, the current Peak Master of the Ancient Moon Peak. Had the previous Peak Master not secured the Yin-Yang Enlightenment Seed for him, he might have remained trapped in the True Qi realm for life!  

"One step, and you become an immortal," Yuan Zhengfeng sighed. "Back then, I received countless opportunities from the 'creditor,' enduring untold hardships before barely taking that step. You may be just one step away, but how long that step will bar your way—no one can say."  

"For most at the peak of the True Qi realm, this step might trap them for life," Li Zhengjing said with a faint smile. "But you seem to think it'll only delay me, not stop me forever."  

"Aside from the creditor's blessings, your talent, bones, and comprehension far surpass mine," Yuan Zhengfeng chuckled. "And your will is far stronger. Once the opportunity arises, you'll surely ascend. But that opportunity... depends on fate."  

"Fate?" Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page and smiled. "I won't wait for fate to come to me. I'll seize it myself—just like now..."  

"But no one can predict where fate lies. Sometimes, the path you take may lead you astray," Yuan Zhengfeng lamented. "Since ancient times, fate has been dictated by heaven..."  

"But I'm fortunate."  

Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *I know exactly where to go.*  

Meanwhile, in Jiangshang Prefecture...  

Three deities of the southeastern region had gathered.  

The Prefect of Jiangshang had no cultivation himself, but with the prefectural seal in hand, he could mobilize the region's fortune, bolstered by the local officials—a force not to be underestimated.  

"The direct bloodline of the Lin Yuan Gao Clan has been nearly wiped out by Gao Xuan. Only two groups remain..."  

"One group in Jiangshang came here under Gao Xuan's orders to seek refuge with Shi Yuan."  

"It seems Gao Xuan believed he might not survive his journey to the southern Heavenly Star Cave. He wanted to preserve his clan's descendants to avoid extinction."  

"From his current trajectory, his next target is the remaining clansmen in Hongshan Town."  

"Originally, we planned to use them as bait, set up an array, and have the three deities trap him while I suppress him with the region's fortune."  

The Prefect of Jiangshang spoke solemnly. "Once General Fang Yin arrives with thirty thousand elite troops, we'll capture Gao Xuan. The Imperial Preceptor wants him alive, but if necessary, dead will suffice. What matters is the power within him."  

"But now, those clansmen are in Li Zhengjing's hands."  

The speaker was the Dragon God of Gujiang. His divine form was carved from a celestial stone acquired by the Great Zhou's founding emperor eight hundred years ago.  

The stone, naturally elongated, had been sculpted into the shape of a flood dragon.  

After the founding hero's death, his spirit entered the divine form, becoming the god of the Gujiang River, worshipped by the people along its banks for over six centuries.  

"Li Zhengjing is a figure of great controversy. His cultivation progress is unnaturally fast—his growth defies reason."  

Another deity, an elder holding a serpent staff known as the Three Yang Duke, added, "In the capital, he took the Dragon Pillar from the palace, yet the Imperial Preceptor didn't stop him. He even let him into the treasury..."  

"With the three of us, aided by the prefectural seal, and General Fang Yin's arrival, subduing Li Zhengjing in his current state shouldn't be difficult," a goddess known as the Divine Mother remarked.  

"Had the capital truly wanted to suppress him, why let him leave? The Imperial Preceptor didn't dare act against him—there must be a reason. We shouldn't provoke him lightly," the Three Yang Duke said.  

"But the Gao clansmen are in his hands," the Divine Mother countered. "Our orders are to capture Gao Xuan and seize his power. With Li Zhengjing in the way, how do we proceed?"  

"Then we wait and observe," the Dragon God of Gujiang said. "Li Zhengjing is formidable, with limitless potential. We mustn't offend him lightly. If he intends to use the Gao clansmen to capture Gao Xuan... let's see what he's capable of."  

"Since emerging from the Heavenly Star Cave, Gao Xuan has displayed terrifying strength," the Prefect said. "Though Li Zhengjing has Human Immortal-level combat power and twenty-five golden dragons, capturing Gao Xuan won't be effortless."  

"If Li Zhengjing fails, we'll step in—saving face for him in the process," the Three Yang Duke suggested.  

"And if he succeeds?" the Divine Mother asked.  

"If Li Zhengjing captures Gao Xuan unscathed, how unfathomable must his strength be?" The Dragon God tilted its head. "We might subdue Gao Xuan, but could we subdue a Li Zhengjing of that caliber?"  

"Then we concede," the Three Yang Duke said. "But I doubt he can capture Gao Xuan without injury."  

"His cultivation speed is unprecedented, but reaching the Human Immortal realm is already astounding. Surely he can't rival the sect leaders of the immortal sects?" The Prefect's voice was firm. "I'm certain that even if he captures Gao Xuan, he won't emerge unharmed."  

"Then... the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind."  

The Dragon God's voice was slow and deliberate. "Whether he captures Gao Xuan or not, if he's not unscathed... that's our chance. Gao Xuan's power comes from the Heavenly Star Cave, but Li Zhengjing achieved Human Immortal-level strength in a single year. Aren't you curious?"  

Its serpentine head swayed. "Perhaps his talent isn't innate... but another kind of supreme opportunity."  

The Three Yang Duke pondered before adding, "And if we retrieve the Dragon Pillar, the capital will be more secure."  

The Prefect nodded. "Then we wait and watch Li Zhengjing's next move."  

At that moment, the prefectural seal at his waist trembled faintly. His expression turned grave as he addressed the others. "Gao Xuan's aura has entered Jiangshang Prefecture."  

"General Fang Yin is still six hundred li away," the Dragon God said. "His forces haven't reached the upper reaches of Gujiang yet."  

The three deities and the Prefect exchanged glances, reaching a silent understanding.  

They would let Li Zhengjing stall Gao Xuan until General Fang Yin arrived.  

"Reports from Hongshan Town say Li Zhengjing took the Gao clansmen to the coast."  

"What?"  

The group exchanged puzzled looks. Was Li Zhengjing planning to flee by sea to avoid Gao Xuan?  

"Is he avoiding Hongshan Town to spare the civilians from the battle?"  

"He saved thousands of cultivators in the capital, earning a reputation for benevolence. This fits his character."  

"No..."  

The Prefect's voice dropped. "That area is too remote—at the edge of Jiangshang's jurisdiction. Mobilizing the prefectural fortune and local forces will be difficult."  

He looked at the three deities. "If you must act, the seal's power will be weakened."  

"Does he suspect we're here, lying in wait?"  

"He's young and inexperienced. Could he really foresee this far?"  

The deities shared uneasy glances. Their earlier resolve wavered.  

If Li Zhengjing had prepared for this, could they truly succeed?  

And if they failed, allowing him to escape, wouldn't they have made an enemy of a future powerhouse capable of rivaling the greatest in the world?  

"Prefect, report this to the capital. Let the Emperor and the Imperial Preceptor decide."  

"Very well."  

The Prefect immediately relayed the news to the capital.  

Once done, he stowed the seal and resumed discussions with the deities, awaiting General Fang Yin's arrival.  

But at that moment, the seal trembled faintly before dimming.  

This disturbance meant an immensely powerful presence had entered Jiangshang Prefecture, its aura clashing with the region's fortune.  

Someone—or something—far stronger than Gao Xuan had followed him into Jiangshang.
