Chapter 384: The Crown Prince of Great Yu is Coming? Birthday Gift

The commotion at Broken Axe Mountain made the New Year in the Eastern Wilderness Domain even more lively.

It was mainly because Li Mo’s daily special effects were terrifyingly grand.

News of a mysterious strong expert’s legacy spreading circulated like wildfire.

New Year comes every year, but a legacy is a rare opportunity that might never come again. Thus, word spread from one to ten, and from ten to a hundred. Even high-ranking sects from other regions began gathering towards the Eastern Wilderness Domain.

Of course.

If one were to trace the source of the news, they would discover that the rumor first originated from the Happy Sheep Hotpot Restaurant.

Inside the Happy Sheep Hotpot Restaurant.

Several elders of the Clear Abyss Sect were sitting around a hotpot.

“The rebellious disciple left a letter, saying he won’t return until after the New Year,” Shang Wu said with arms crossed, angrily tossing the letter onto the table.

“That’s for the best. Lately, the Ziyang Prefecture hasn’t been peaceful. The challengers coming to fight those two have almost worn down the doorstep,” Elder Xue sighed.

The elders had originally planned to return home for the New Year, but with the happenings at Broken Axe Mountain growing more intense by the day, they simply couldn't leave.

“What kind of omen is it today?”
“A phoenix’s cry. Now we don’t know who the owner of the legacy is again.”
“I guessed it was a legacy of a Buddhist strong expert yesterday, but it changed again today.”
“Unfathomable, truly unfathomable!”
“This is definitely a muddy affair.”

The elders of the Clear Abyss Sect still hadn’t decided whether to get involved in this muddy affair.

After all, just the major sects they knew of that were coming numbered no less than five, all of which were on par with the Crossing Cloud Sword City as top-tier sects of a province.

And that wasn’t all. It was possible that hidden, reclusive sects might show up as well.

Even the Shadow Demon Cult was spotted among them!

Yet, with the earth-shaking omens appearing day after day, it was hard to resist the urge to go take a look.

At that moment, the door was pushed open.

The elders froze, exchanging glances with unnatural expressions.

It was Elder Qian.

They were eating hotpot and didn’t call him...

“Ahem, we actually planned to call you today, but...”
“Forget the hotpot,” Elder Qian said impatiently.

“Hm?”

Xue Jing and Elder Han He exchanged a glance, realizing the gravity of the situation. For old Qian to not even care about the hotpot, it was as unbelievable as Shang Wu not caring about not being invited to drink. Something must have happened again.

Elder Qian said:
“Today, a Captain of the Patrol Sky Guard came to our sect.”

A regular Patrol Sky Guard is at least at the Inner Scene Realm, and much stronger than ordinary Inner Scene cultivators.
A Captain would be at the Outer Scene Realm.
It’s rarely good news when the Patrol Sky Guard comes knocking...

Shang Wu narrowed her eyes: “Should we... find a way to deal with him...”
As she spoke, she made a slicing motion across her fair neck, her almond-shaped eyes filled with killing intent.

“Deal with your head. He brought a message from the Crown Prince.”
“Li Mo and Ying Bing, two prodigies of the Hidden Dragon Ranking, have rendered great service to the nation. Crown Prince Jiang Yu will visit the Clear Abyss Sect after the New Year to commend the prodigies of Great Yu.”
“????”

*Clatter!*

A plate fell to the ground.

Jiang Chulong stood dumbfounded at the door, looking as if her soul had left her body.

...

As the New Year approached, Clear River County was covered in a heavy snowfall.

...

The world was a vast expanse of white, quiet and beautiful. Every household was decorated with lanterns and banners, adding a touch of festive joy to the silver-clad scenery.

The streets were bustling with traffic as everyone prepared their New Year goods.

Li Dalong and his wife sat in their carriage, having just returned from the market with a full load of supplies. They could have sent servants to do it, but if they didn't handle the New Year preparations themselves, what joy would the festival bring?

“Old Li, sister-in-law, you bought so much?” someone greeted them as they arrived at the street leading to the Li residence.

“Old Tian? Little Mo and Bing’er are back. It’s different now. I told everyone not to come to my house for New Year visits, to keep it simple, but those relatives and friends insisted on coming. Ah, really...” Old Li said with feigned modesty, his voice full of pride.

The man opposite, Old Tian, had always been subtly competing with Old Li. They didn’t get along when they were both county officials, mainly due to differing ideals.

“Tsk tsk, prodigies of the Hidden Dragon Ranking, those are figures among the clouds,” Old Tian chuckled, surprisingly not turning red in the face, but praising them instead.

But after the praise, he turned the conversation: “In the future, when my grandkids grow up a bit, I’ll have to shamelessly come over and ask your prodigies to guide them in opening their meridians.”

“?”

Li Dalong and his wife exchanged a glance, stunned.

Old Tian had already lifted the carriage curtain. Inside sat a young couple, each holding a baby. The infants were as fair as jade, dressed in festive clothes like lucky dolls.

“Come, call him Uncle Li. Uncle Li is generous; you’ll get a red envelope if you call him uncle.”
“Mm... hehehe, Happy New Year.”
Li Dalong’s face stiffened as he took out a red envelope from his pocket.

Who knew Old Tian was sly, getting the advantage and still acting coy:
“Tsk tsk, having one grandchild is enough, but who knew they’d give me a pair of twins, a boy and a girl. Ah, I’ll have my hands full in the future, those two little ones will be a handful.”
“Eh? Your two...”

Li Dalong replied expressionlessly:
“Yeah, the happenings at Broken Axe Mountain have been quite intense lately. So many people are gathering there, even our Clear River County has become a mix of all sorts. We need to pay attention to public order.”

“???”

Li Dalong returned to the carriage, feeling quite displeased after being shown up by Old Tian.

He looked at his wife, only to find her gazing out the window at the family enjoying their time together as they entered their home, lost in thought.

The couple exchanged a glance, both looking somewhat complex...

They used to think it was fine, and had been strictly guarding against it, but after being flaunted to like that, they both wanted grandchildren.

But Little Mo and Little Bing’er were at a critical juncture right now, and they couldn’t bring themselves to say it. They couldn’t just tell them to forget about competing on the Hidden Dragon Ranking and settle down at home...

“The children have their own matters; we shouldn’t worry too much about them, so they don’t find us annoying,” Li Dalong sighed softly, shaking his head.

“Yeah, we should let nature take its course, but maybe we can... give a little nudge?” Gu Xueqin couldn’t help but say.

“Getting married doesn’t necessarily mean they have to have children right away...”

The couple returned to the residence but didn’t see the two little ones who had complicated their feelings, so they asked the maids:
“Where are Little Mo and Bing’er?”
“They said they were going out for a stroll.”

Meanwhile.

On the streets of Clear River County.

On the snow-covered streets, a heavy snow was falling, but it couldn’t drown out the bustling crowd. The festive atmosphere spread from this lively market to every household in Clear River County.

Little Mo had no idea that his parents were about to take action.

He rubbed the small hand in his palm and looked sideways.

Ying Bing wore a newly made red dress, her black hair dusted with snow, her thick eyelashes unable to hide the seriousness in her eyes.

“What kind of birthday gift should I prepare for him?”

She had never given anyone a birthday gift before.
