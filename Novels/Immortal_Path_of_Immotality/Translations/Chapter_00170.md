# Chapter 169: Who's the Sneaky One? (Happy New Year!)

"Boom—"

"Crash—"

The sounds of surging tides continuously rose from the spiritual well in the secret chamber. A little girl peeked over the edge of the well, her large, lively eyes filled with curiosity as she gazed downward. When she saw an enormous white mist dragon, stretching over ten miles long, roaring past below, she instinctively sucked on her fingers.

Lin Shan sat calmly nearby, fiddling with the innate spiritual treasure, the Void Star Plate, paying no heed to the muffled thunder from the well. He discreetly tied the Demon-Binding Rope around the girl to prevent her from falling in. The well led straight to the depths of the earth's core, where natural flight-restricting formations existed. Who knew if the artifact spirit could return if it strayed too far from its main body?

The Void Star Plate in his hands clicked as its three concentric rings—inner, middle, and outer—rotated in opposite directions, emitting crisp mechanical sounds. The pointer on the plate spun wildly, continuously tracking the "mist dragon" swimming back and forth below. The surface of the spiritual treasure flickered, faintly revealing the underground spiritual vein's movements. The transparent sand table depicted the miraculous workings of heaven and earth, showing a surging torrent deep within the earth's core struggling upward.

Based on the calibrations on the Void Star Plate, Lin Shan calculated that the torrent would reach them in about half a day.

"This torrent must be the peak of the spiritual vein tide. After this, it will ebb, cycling twice a day."

First day:  
- Midnight: high tide  
- Dawn: low tide  
- Noon: high tide  
- Dusk: low tide  

Second day:  
...

Using the innate spiritual treasure's calculations, Lin Shan deduced the rise and fall of the spiritual vein tide for the next few months with near-perfect accuracy. After repeatedly verifying his findings, he finally set the matter aside.

Next, he poured out a pile of formation materials from his storage bracelet, and the artifact spirit, Xiao Xin, helped him set up a spirit-gathering formation. Lately, Lin Shan had been deliberately learning about formations from Black Skeleton Demon Lord and Xiao Xin. Though he couldn't yet handle them independently, he could at least assist.

He could now set up some common restrictions himself, but formations still required more study. Formations were vast and profound, encompassing an ocean of knowledge—astronomy, geography, celestial phenomena, calculations, divination, and more. Lin Shan barely had time for cultivation, let alone specialized study. 

However, being close to two formation masters and having his eyes regularly anointed with Illusion Spirit Liquid made it easier for him to observe formation patterns and restrictions. With the Void Star Plate's assistance in derivation, he had at least gained a basic understanding.

After setting up the spirit-gathering formation, Xiao Xin, under Lin Shan's instructions, also arranged several other formations: "Soundproof Formation," "Defensive Formation," "Maze Formation," and others.

When cultivating in someone else's territory, security measures were essential—trust no one.

Meanwhile, in the other four spiritual well chambers, the Gongsun family's young Foundation Establishment cultivators also took out treasures bestowed by their elders.

Gongsun Yu produced a yellow-brown orb the size of a human head—the "Source-Gathering Pearl," a treasure passed down through generations in one of the Gongsun family's main branches. Its external function was to strongly absorb the essence of surrounding spiritual liquids. When the spiritual vein tide surged, the "Heaven and Earth Nectar" and the spiritual milk carried up from the depths would be mostly drawn to the "Source-Gathering Pearl" if they came close enough to the well. This was the foresight of that branch's elder.

In another chamber, a female cultivator in red used a formation plate as the core, pulling out various materials from her storage artifact to set up a complex grand formation—the famous "Geomagnetic Diversion Formation" from another main branch of the Gongsun family. 

This ancient formation had been obtained by a Gongsun ancestor at great peril from a ruin. Three generations of that branch had poured their resources into crafting the formation plate and gathering all the necessary materials, keeping it as a hidden heirloom. The "Geomagnetic Diversion Formation" was essentially a supercharged spirit-gathering formation, condensing spiritual energy into dense fog for absorption, making ordinary formations pale in comparison.

Normally, due to internal family sanctions, this formation couldn't be used—otherwise, the Gongsun family's spiritual vein might be drained dry, destroying their foundation. But now, with the spiritual vein tide bringing endless spiritual energy from the depths, it was a heaven-sent opportunity. The elder of this branch had seized the moment to unleash this weapon, providing the red-clad woman with breakthrough pills to see if she could charge into the mid-Foundation Establishment stage in one go.

The other two had also prepared in advance. One took out a fishing rod artifact, seemingly designed to "fish" for treasures from the well. If the depths truly spewed out fourth-tier or higher spiritual materials, even just one or two, it would be a massive windfall. The elder of this branch had taken a different approach, knowing they couldn't compete for the "Heaven and Earth Nectar" or spiritual energy, so they focused on treasure hunting instead.

The last person pulled out a large funnel artifact, slamming it directly onto the well with a loud "clang," chuckling to himself as if the funnel could also absorb against the current.

At midnight, the rumbling from below grew louder. The Void Star Plate, serving as the spirit-gathering formation's core, floated in the air beside Lin Shan, its inner rings beginning to rotate with a series of "beeps."

Lin Shan perked up—the spiritual vein tide was coming.

The muffled thunder below roared like an army of iron horses charging forth. The entire underground chamber shook violently, dust raining down from above.

In the other four chambers, the Gongsun youths also opened their eyes, peering into the wells. Though they couldn't see the surging white line deep below, the tremors and sounds told them enough.

"It's coming!"

The space below the wells was suddenly engulfed in white mist, and the spiritual energy concentration in all chambers skyrocketed tenfold. The Gongsun youths hastily activated their treasures, staring intently at the well openings.

Just as they awaited their moment—

"Boom! Boom! Boom—"

A series of deafening explosions erupted from below. In Lin Shan's chamber, the spiritual treasure blazed with starlight as countless rays of astral energy materialized from the void, forming luminous arrays around him, mysterious and magnificent.

The spirit-gathering formation underfoot, driven by the Void Star Plate, began to spin with a whooshing sound. The formation bases hovered in the air, rotating faster and faster like a whirlwind.

Xiao Xin let out a timely "ah-ah" to alert him to prepare for the incoming spiritual energy.

Lin Shan quickly steadied his mind—just in time!

"Bang! Crash—"

A thick pillar of spiritual energy, as wide as the well, shot upward, striking the chamber's ceiling before dispersing into a misty spray. Amid the drizzle, Lin Shan felt his pores open wide, a euphoric sensation washing over him.

Before he could even begin absorbing, the spiritual mist around him surged, the well continuing to spew endlessly.

"Ah-ah!"

Xiao Xin, as a spirit entity, could shift between tangible and intangible forms. She leaned against the well, cheering her master on as wisps of spiritual mist and liquid passed through her form.

Lin Shan now utilized every pore in his body. Waves of spiritual mist, carrying the scorching essence of the earth's veins, were refined by the Void Star Plate above, showering him with pure spiritual rain. Meanwhile, the spirit-gathering formation erected a barrier, isolating the chaotic spiritual mist outside to ensure the energy within remained uncontaminated.

"Whoosh— Whoosh—"

The vortex of spiritual power in his dantian spun rapidly. Streams of converted spiritual energy flowed through his meridians, and the "water level" in his dantian rose imperceptibly.

While he reveled in his cultivation, the others in the other chambers were dumbfounded.

The four Gongsun youths clutched their family-bestowed treasures, staring hopelessly at the wells as if waiting for a tide that never came. The earlier commotion seemed like thunder with no rain.

"Was that just a prelude? Is the real tide still coming?"

With the wells shrouded in mist, they couldn't discern the truth below, forced to wait in frustration.

Every second felt like an eternity.

...

Half an hour later, the tide receded. Lin Shan slowly concluded his cultivation, sensing the gains in his cultivation—equivalent to a month of hard work!

Though it felt slightly unstable.

This was normal. Cultivators converting heaven and earth's spiritual energy into their own strength wasn't an overnight process—it required prolonged tempering.

Lin Shan had consumed a "Purple Dust Pill" a few months prior, instantly filling a third of his progress toward mid-Foundation Establishment. Even after months of refinement, compressing it to a quarter, it had only just stabilized. Now, relying on external infusion again, he'd likely need even more time to consolidate later.

Cultivation could take shortcuts, but those shortcuts required repayment in time.

Cultivation was about both "cultivating" and "tempering." Neglecting the latter would inevitably lead to qi deviation.

Still, compared to slow, steady cultivation, absorbing spiritual energy here first and compressing it later would save significant time.

Lin Shan took this opportunity to begin tempering his newly gained progress.

The mist in the well below thinned, the deafening roar of crashing waves fading—likely due to the ebb tide.

A clear female voice echoed from below, likely because all five wells were connected, allowing brief communication.

"Fellow Daoists, how were your gains from the spiritual vein tide just now?"

Lin Shan was the first to respond: "Nothing at all! Some sneaky bastard took it all—utterly infuriating!"

The other three quickly chimed in:

"Same here, got nothing."

"Right, there was no tide at all—just a sham."

"Terrible, all our preparations wasted. Who knows who benefited instead?"

They lamented loudly, sighing and blaming each other, suspicions growing.

The true "sneaky bastard," Lin Shan, even roared into the well: "As an envoy of a major sect, I shouldn't throw my weight around, but you all have gone too far! Don't think I can't tell you're ganging up on me!"

This preemptive accusation was masterful, catching everyone off guard.

Remembering their elders' warnings before entering, the group scrambled to placate Lin Shan, fearing his wrath. To prove their innocence, they hastily revealed their treasures to clear their names.

"Brother Lin, you misunderstand—my Source-Gathering Pearl only absorbs spiritual liquids!"

"My Geomagnetic Diversion Formation didn't work either—barely drew any spiritual energy."

"My Spirit-Fishing Rod only catches materials, useless for the tide."

"My Spirit-Siphoning Funnel didn't get anything either."

Incredibly, they all confessed without even being pressed!

Their admissions stunned Lin Shan—these people had indeed come prepared. Fortunately, his innate spiritual treasure outclassed theirs. 

But the others didn't know he had such a treasure! They assumed the envoy, unprepared, had suffered a major loss and was now furious, scrambling to appease him.

Meanwhile, they began suspecting each other, analyzing who might be lying.

"Gongsun Xue must've taken it all with her Geomagnetic Diversion Formation!" Gongsun Yu thought.

"Gongsun Hu probably hogged everything with his Spirit-Siphoning Funnel!" Gongsun Xue guessed.

"That bitch Gongsun Xue must've used her formation to steal it all—how shameless!" Gongsun Hu fumed.

The rod-wielding youth cursed inwardly: "Gongsun Hu and Gongsun Xue, you beasts! So greedy, and we're from the same family!"

...

Lin Shan cultivated leisurely, occasionally exchanging words with the others through the well.

Assuming Lin Shan couldn't have prepared anything in time, they were convinced one of their own had stolen the first tide's benefits, fuming silently.

Still, as family, they couldn't outright confront each other. Surely the thief would know to stop after this.

...

At noon, the second tide arrived.

The deafening roar below shook the chambers, and the five hurriedly focused on their wells, now obscured by mist again.

Lin Shan's Void Star Plate spun wildly once more, and another pillar of spiritual energy erupted from the well, refined by the treasure for his cultivation.

This time, however, the tide carried faintly colored vapors that, upon entering his body, nourished his soul and even improved his spiritual root aptitude!

"Heaven and Earth Nectar!"

Lin Shan's heart raced. He felt as if he were soaring among the stars, freed from shackles. His spiritual energy absorption rate increased steadily, signaling improvements in his roots and comprehension!

Heaven and Earth Nectar was typically a reward for Nascent Soul cultivators after successful tribulations—a treasure to consolidate their foundations. It never circulated externally. What Nascent Soul cultivator would trade away their hard-earned reward, meant to aid their breakthroughs or enhance their talents?

Even a single drop was priceless.

Lin Shan nearly moaned in pleasure, savoring the nectar's transformation while bathing in pure spiritual energy—sheer bliss!

Meanwhile, the four Gongsun youths sat despondently in their empty chambers, staring blankly at their wells.

On the very first day, they hadn't even gotten a sip. Had all their preparations been for nothing?

...

Half an hour later, the second tide receded.

Gongsun Xue's voice echoed again: "Fellow Daoists, how were your gains?"

Lin Shan was the first to respond, his voice volcanic: "You Gongsun people have gone too far! This envoy waited half a day for nothing—utterly infuriating!"

"Envoy, please calm down—I got nothing either."

"Same here, empty-handed."

"Terrible, just terrible..."

The others were equally bitter, silently cursing Lin Shan for his arrogance, thinking his sect status made him superior. Just wait until the righteous cultivators arrived in two months—he'd see then.

Yet Lin Shan's outburst only reinforced their belief that the thief was among them.

There had to be a traitor!

"Round two had Heaven and Earth Nectar—Gongsun Yu's Source-Gathering Pearl must've taken it all," Gongsun Xue fumed.

"This tide was probably stolen by that bitch Gongsun Xue's formation," Gongsun Yu seethed.

"Gongsun Yu and Gongsun Xue are vile, hogging the nectar and energy—not even leaving scraps!" the other two raged.

"Fellow Daoists feasted while this envoy played the fool," Lin Shan added, belching and fanning the flames.

The Gongsun four now felt like the real fools and couldn't stay silent.

They'd assumed the thief would stop after the first round, but this audacity demanded action.

"Which elder brother is joking like this? Enough is enough!"

"Junior Sister, maybe tone down your formation—too much spiritual energy might give you a chill."

"Brother Yu, let your treasure rest—overuse shortens its lifespan."

"Brother Hu, clean your funnel—leaving it in the well will gunk it up."

Their sarcastic remarks carried veiled warnings: Stop now, or we'll expose you!

After the exchange, the wells fell silent again.

...

But peace was short-lived.

Half a day later, after the third tide receded:

"Gongsun Yu, I've had enough of your hypocrisy!"

"Nonsense! Gongsun Hu, you're spouting crap!"

"Gongsun Xue, you snake—I always knew you were rotten!"

"Brother Hu, what are you saying? I only care for you..."

"Xiao Xue, so you've loved me all along..."

Drama erupted, with old family grudges and even a love triangle surfacing. Surprisingly, Lin Shan didn't join in this time.

He was simply too full. Spiritual energy had backflowed, clogging his meridians and disrupting his qi flow, causing uncontrollable hiccups.

"*Hic—*"

The sound was piercing. The well fell silent—the four voices cutting off abruptly.

"???"
