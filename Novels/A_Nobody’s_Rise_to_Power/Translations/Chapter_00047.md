# Chapter 47: An Inexplicable Palpitation

Cheng Er raised his head, sweat trickling into his eyes and making him squint.

"Big Brother!"

"Uncle!"

Cheng Er's wife and her eldest son let go of the plow and joyfully came forward to greet him.

"Shh..." Leopard Head raised a finger to his lips, signaling for silence.

This vast field had been reclaimed by the Cheng family, and there were no other villagers around.

But Leopard Head still cast a wary glance around.

His gaze fell on an old man plowing in a distant field and lingered for a moment.

That was his old father.

Leopard Head withdrew his gaze and gestured with his chin toward the woods outside the field ridge. "Lao Er, come with me."

He took two steps, then turned back to add an instruction.

"Lao Er's wife, you and Da Zhuang just act like you haven't seen me. Don't tell anyone!"

"Alright, alright!" Cheng Er's wife and son agreed repeatedly.

Watching as their father followed his uncle into the woods, Cheng Zhuang asked in confusion, "Mom, since Uncle is down from the mountain, why doesn't he go see Grandpa and Grandma? What's he looking for Dad for? Why is he being so sneaky about it?"

"What does a half-grown kid like you know? If Uncle is doing something, he has his reasons. You just do as you're told."

The head of the Cheng family now was Leopard Head. If it weren't for him, the Cheng family could never have acquired so much land in just over twenty years. If it weren't for Leopard Head, even if they had worked tirelessly to reclaim so much barren land, it would have long been seized by the village owner, Zhang, and they would have ended up like Zhen Laoshi.

In the hearts of the Cheng family, the prestige of their eldest brother, Leopard Head, had long since far surpassed that of their very fertile old father.

Qingmei was originally a blank sheet of paper when it came to matters of love and desire. Yet, she had repeatedly listened to the sounds from Yang Can's room through the window. Those shameful sounds soaked through the window paper night after night, quietly grinding a touch of carmine into her heart. These repeated acts of eavesdropping and imagination had become her most secret enlightenment lesson.

Now that Yang Can was actively flirting with her, that fragile layer of window paper was naturally pierced with a single touch. A single double-meaning joke from Yang Can made the little Qingmei blush with shyness. A mere exchange of glances was like a butterfly flitting across the lake of her heart.

For Yang Can, teasing such a girl who had just awakened to love was a unique pleasure. For Qingmei, however, the feeling was sweeter than the first-blossomed jasmine. The little girl was beginning to fall, inch by inch.

Under a tree, the village head Lai Gulun and the field supervisor Peng stood side by side. Habitually, they kept their hands in their sleeves like it was winter, craning their necks forward. From a distance, they looked like two hanged ghosts hanging from the big tree. They didn't understand this kind of romantic情趣 between men and women, even though they had each had more than one woman.

Watching Yang Can and Supervisor Qingmei chatting happily on the field ridge, Peng Jin couldn't help but ask, "Old Lai, should we go over and listen?"

Lai Gulun said dismissively, "Let them chat about whatever they like. As long as we keep an eye on him wherever he goes, there won't be any trouble!"

Gradually, the two of them also began to realize something: those two were... flirting?

Peng Jin's doubts vanished instantly, and he let out a "噗嗤" (a stifled chuckle).

"Old Lai, I think our village owner is just being paranoid. Look at Yang Can, is there any sign of him inspecting our Feng'an Village? He's clearly just looking for a chance to bring his mistress down the mountain for a secret rendezvous!"

Lai Gulun laughed. "Isn't that perfect? As long as he doesn't cause trouble for us, then everyone's happy. The sooner we send this master off in high spirits, the sooner we'll have peace."

If Yang Can's methods were used on modern girls, it would be better to use his good looks to seduce them; the success rate might be higher. But in this era, against a girl like Qingmei, who was a blank slate in matters of the heart, she had no defense at all. With Yang Can's glib tongue, the little Qingmei quickly blushed and surrendered. Not to mention being willful, she didn't even dare to respond to Yang Can's words now. Listening with a hot face and a pounding heart, who could stand it?

Yang Can also knew when to quit. He had already opened her heart today; wasn't he afraid he wouldn't be able to open more tomorrow?

Yang Can said, "Let's go, let's take a look over there."

Yang Can called over Lai Gulun and Peng Jin and walked toward a farmer plowing in the distance. It was a tenant of Feng'an Village, using a plow ox from the Zhang family. Of course, the ox wasn't free; the cost would be calculated into the rent at the harvest. Yang Can was just strolling around, intentionally trying to lull Zhang Yunyi into a false sense of security.

But as he got closer, seeing the plow pulled by the old ox, Yang Can suddenly felt it looked different from the plows he had in his memory. Yang Can observed it carefully for a while and suddenly realized: the plow shaft was straight. No wonder it looked a bit clumsy, and the ox seemed to be pulling it with great difficulty.

Peng Jin asked with a smile, "Yang Can, are you interested in farming too?"

Yang Can frowned slightly. "Supervisor Peng, you may not know this, but I have dabbled in a wide range of studies, including various crafts and techniques. I admit this is my first time seeing farming up close, but from my perspective, the plowshare pulled by the ox in the fields is too clumsy, especially difficult for deep plowing."

After hearing this, Peng Jin felt a bit of disdain in his heart. *What does a scholar who never lifts a finger and can't tell the five grains apart know about farming? Stop pretending!* But he still smiled politely and said, "What you say is true, Yang Can. It is indeed not easy for farmers to make a living from the soil."

Lai Gulun added proudly, "But even though this plow is clumsy, it's already the best farming tool. Those families without a plowshare can't even turn over such large fields. Our Feng'an Village has plows and oxen, so our tenants suffer much less hardship."

As soon as they arrived, some weather-beaten, dark-skinned tenants had gathered around. These commoners didn't dare to get too close; they just stood to one side, bent over and smiling obsequiously. The village head and the field supervisor had come, and they treated this young master with such respect, so this young master must be an even bigger big shot. How could they dare not be respectful?

Hearing Peng Jin's words, several farmers quickly smiled and agreed, bowing and scraping repeatedly.

Yang Can pondered for a moment. "Everyone under heaven relies on food for survival. And the source of food lies first in agriculture. You should understand the principle that 'a craftsman must first sharpen his tools if he wants to do his work well.' Since this plow is so clumsy, hasn't anyone thought of improving upon the farm tools invented by the sages of old?"

Lai Gulun couldn't hold back and let out a "噗嗤" (a stifled chuckle). Realizing his gaffe but not knowing how to smooth it over, his old face flushed with embarrassment.

Yang Can, however, didn't mind. Instead, he turned to an old craftsman next to him with great interest and asked, "What does Master Tie think?"

"Master Tie" is a polite and refined way to address a blacksmith. This old craftsman was named Li Yue, and most of the farm tools in the village were made by him. The plow in the field just now was one he had just forged and delivered.

Li Yue shook his head. "Reporting to the Great Master, this old man's meager skill was passed down from my ancestors. I dare not be careless in my work, but I only strive to make the farm tools sturdy and durable. As for improving the tools... how could this old man have such ability?"

Yang Can smiled. "Just now, watching these farmers plow, I suddenly had an idea. I'd like to make an improvement to this kind of plowshare."

Everyone was astonished to hear this. With Yang Can's scholarly and refined air, they couldn't connect him with farm tools at all. Little Qingmei stared with her big, dark eyes, looking at Yang Can with worry. He just didn't want to be out in the sun in the field, but he shouldn't use such an excuse. What if he couldn't produce anything in the end? Wouldn't he be secretly laughed at?

Yang Can said, "However, although I have an idea in mind, if I am to put it into practice, I will need to rely on Master Tie. If we can truly forge a farm tool that benefits the common people, you and I could leave a good name for posterity."

This old blacksmith had never had such a grand ambition in his life. The huge pie thrown at him by Yang Can left him dizzy and speechless for a moment.

Lai Gulun, however, was secretly delighted. He didn't believe for a second that this Yang Can, who had never touched mud, could improve any farm tool. However, if Yang Can really became obsessed with this matter, wouldn't he have no time to cause trouble for Feng'an Village?

Lai Gulun quickly flattered him. "Yang Can, if you can really improve the plow, that would be an incredible merit! Old Li, what are you standing there for? With such a heaven-sent opportunity, you should cooperate fully with our Yang Can!"

Lai Gulun winked at Peng Jin, who immediately understood and also stepped forward to sing praises.

Yang Can was, after all, young. After being praised by Lai Gulun and Peng Jin, he seemed a bit "overwhelmed." He pulled Li Yue and said excitedly, "Let's go, let's go back right now. I'll tell you my ideas, and I'll have to trouble Master Tie to help me think them through."

Yang Can abandoned his sightseeing and, pulling the blacksmith Li, went straight back to the village and headed for Li's forge.

As soon as Yang Can arrived at the forge, he squatted with Li Yue under the big jujube tree in the yard and began sketching in the sandy soil with a twig.

Yang Can wasn't a researcher of farm tools, so he couldn't immediately draw a perfect curved-plow shaft. However, just knowing the name was enough to understand its general difference from the straight-plow shaft. Moreover, Yang Can had seen pictures of the curved-plow shaft online. Drawing a rough sketch was well within his capabilities.

Blacksmith Li had practical experience, while Yang Can could draw a "rough version." In this way, how to combine and assemble the various parts, Li could quickly identify problems and think of solutions.

Discovering that he was truly useful, Blacksmith Li's confidence grew greatly. For a time, one Yang Can and one Li, with one speaking and the other listening, threw themselves wholeheartedly into the design of the improved farm tool, completely forgetting themselves.

Lai Gulun and Peng Jin had successfully tricked Yang Can into getting sidetracked. But as a result, they became extremely bored. The tea at the forge wasn't good; it was coarse tea brewed with jujube leaves that made one's tongue root go numb. But they couldn't leave. Who knew if Yang Can was just pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger? What if they left, and Yang Can immediately went to investigate everywhere? If Yang Can were to discover the hidden land and hidden households of Feng'an Village, that would be a big problem.

Qingmei also had nothing to do, but she didn't feel bored, because Yang Can was here. The blacksmith's wife brought Qingmei a dustpan full of dried jujubes. Qingmei sat under the jujube tree, picking out the plump-looking jujubes, eating them while watching Yang Can and the blacksmith discuss their project with focused intensity.

Earlier, she had been flustered by Yang Can's teasing, her heart filled with shy joy. She was both afraid of Yang Can speaking and wanted to hear him speak. Now, having quieted down, she sat by herself, quietly watching that handsome and focused man.

In Qingmei's heart, an inexplicable feeling slowly welled up. It was an indescribable palpitation that left her both flustered and longing.
