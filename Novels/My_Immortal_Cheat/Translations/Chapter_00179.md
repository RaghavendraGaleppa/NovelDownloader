# Chapter 179: Self-Destruction

Boom!

All killing moves crashed down upon him, causing a devastating collision. Bell-like vibrations pulsed outwards, space shattered, and ripples surged. Along the way, various bluestones and low hills were violently impacted, as if swept by a divine sword. Some turned to dust, others were sliced apart, creating a terrifying scene.

Zhou Tian let out a muffled groan. His entire body's blood energy surged, emitting dazzling light. His internal organs were like a blazing furnace, refining various exotic energies. This was an unimaginable feat; no one dared to do such a thing within their own body, as a single mistake could lead to self-destruction. The external energies and rules crashing upon him acted like a catalyst. A smile split Zhou Tian's lips, blood oozing out, a terrifying sight.

Boom!

A surge of chaotic energy erupted from within him, forming a great halberd. This was true chaotic energy, which Zhou Tian had finally refined a trace of, using his own body as a cauldron. It was barely enough for a single use.

Crack! Lightning flashed and thunder boomed. The man who had earlier wielded the Purple-Gold Lightning Hammer once again displayed the profundities of the lightning dao. Holding the hammer, which glowed with purple light piercing the sky, he smashed forward. His speed was astonishing, actually entwined with lightning, moving by harnessing thunder light. This was quite terrifying, making him the first to charge in.

Zhou Tian let out a cold snort, wielding the great halberd formed from chaotic qi, and smashed forward without hesitation. At this moment, the man's gaze transformed into lightning, and electric arcs erupted from every pore on his body. He became a son of thunder, unleashing his full power to strike down Zhou Tian.

Clang! A dull clang erupted. Zhou Tian struck the purple lightning hammer with his great halberd, scattering the lightning and causing a crack to appear on it.

"Ah!" The man cried out in alarm, his heart aching. This was his treasured lightning dao hammer, nurtured with his blood essence, a secret treasure that could grow with him, yet it had been cracked.

"This is true chaotic energy, not a half-finished product!" A Heavenly King roared, finding it hard to believe. Chaotic energy was something Heavenly Kings couldn't control, yet this person had actually refined it, which was utterly shocking.

Zhou Tian held the chaotic great halberd, his expression cold. How could these people before him know that he had accumulated experience refining chaotic energy many times? If not for his insufficient strength, he could conjure it effortlessly.

A spear-wielding Heavenly King, bare-chested with bulging muscles and a black flood dragon tattoo, exuded a demonic aura. He roared and thrust his spear at Zhou Tian. Instantly, the spearhead twisted space, and energy shot forth, more terrifying than hundreds or thousands of sword lights merging together. At the spear's tip, a massive explosion of light occurred, illuminating the world, dazzling and incredibly horrifying.

Demons wailed and deities roared, blood rained down. All sorts of phenomena were unleashed by the combatants. Wild sands danced, gigantic boulders tumbled and flew high into the sky. The entire area seemed to have plunged into hell, with energy raging and the scene utterly dreadful.

Rumble! With this chaotic great halberd, Zhou Tian was fearless. The chaotic energy almost swept away anyone at this cultivation level.

Zhou Tian crashed into the ground with a bang. As a result, the seven Heavenly Kings also plunged in, pursuing him, their various weapons flying and blasting through all obstructions. Then, like a million active volcanoes erupting, energy surged towards the heavens, ravaging the battlefield. All sorts of earth and stones were churned up like tidal waves.

Bang bang! But soon they separated, each standing on the dust-shrouded ground. As the mist dissipated, a dreadful wound appeared on Zhou Tian's abdomen, blood gushing out. It was clearly a saber wound, a diagonal slash, inflicted due to being besieged by seven Heavenly Kings. However, the seven Heavenly Kings were not faring well either. They were all injured, with blood flowing from their bodies.

Behind Zhou Tian, the Holy Demonic Lord sat cross-legged in the void. Two phantoms appeared behind him: one radiating Buddhist light, the other engulfing demonic flames. A lotus seed floated between his eyebrows, emitting profound fluctuations, connecting the two phantoms.

"If you want to touch my brother, step over my corpse first!" Zhou Tian shouted at the top of his lungs, seemingly for the Holy Demonic Lord's benefit, then swung his great halberd and charged forward. Compared to before, the halberd's divine light had weakened considerably. He then charged forward, as his skill duration was limited and he didn't want to waste a single second.

The seven gritted their teeth, wondering what lunatic had appeared. He kept claiming the Holy Demonic Lord was his younger brother. Shouldn't a younger brother charge into battle for his elder brother? Yet here was the elder brother fighting for his life, while the younger brother gained an opportunity at the back. Especially the saber-wielding Heavenly King, who cursed inwardly. He had just tried to sneak attack the Holy Demonic Lord, but Zhou Tian relentlessly pursued him at all costs, shattering his body with the great halberd, giving him no opportunity whatsoever.

Some had already developed thoughts of retreating, because if they couldn't deal with Zhou Tian quickly, once the Holy Demonic Lord became free, none of them would be able to escape. There were many other opportunities in this place; it wasn't worth sacrificing their lives for this one spot. However, seeing Zhou Tian charge up again, they had no choice but to brace themselves and meet him.

The battle erupted once more, but this time Zhou Tian found it much easier to contend. Several individuals began to feign effort, their eyes flickering as they looked for an opportunity to escape. He understood that they had lost their will to fight.

Zhou Tian checked the time; thirty seconds had already passed, with about seven seconds remaining. As his death count gradually increased, the skill's duration also grew. His eyes darted, and a certain idea formed in his mind. Exotic energies continuously emerged around his body, only to be swallowed by him. His body glowed, surrounded by brilliant divine halos. As more and more energy was devoured, his physique slightly expanded.

Initially, these Heavenly Kings didn't pay much heed, only thinking he was refining chaotic energy again. They were already prepared to escape; even if Zhou Tian refined it, what then?

"Little brother, how much longer do you need?" Zhou Tian asked, his voice slightly distorted as his body had already expanded by a full circle, glowing dazzlingly.

"A moment!" The Holy Demonic Lord replied. At this point, the two phantoms behind him had merged more than halfway. The voice came from his mouth, not from the phantoms behind him, as if a new consciousness had already formed.

"Little brother, this elder brother is incompetent! Let us be brothers again in the next life!" Zhou Tian roared, his eyes red-rimmed.

The Heavenly Kings were somewhat bewildered. What did he mean, incompetent? Wasn't he crushing them just moments ago? Then their expressions drastically changed, because cracks had begun to appear on Zhou Tian's body, which had already expanded by a full circle. They knew this was a precursor to self-destruction.

"Are you crazy?!" Everyone cursed inwardly. 'We were already planning to leave, what are you doing? If you're insane, don't come out and wander around!'

Instantly, disregarding Zhou Tian's halberd attacks, they scattered in seven different directions, terrified of being affected. One Heavenly King was struck on the back by a halberd, coughing up blood, but he didn't dare to look back, as the cracks on Zhou Tian's body became even more dense. Someone else, thinking themselves clever, headed towards the Holy Demonic Lord, assuming Zhou Tian wouldn't dare to follow. But they found Zhou Tian charging straight at him, completely disregarding the Holy Demonic Lord.

"Isn't that your little brother?!" That Heavenly King cursed loudly, forced to deviate from the Holy Demonic Lord's direction. True enough, Zhou Tian stopped pursuing him.

"Little rooster, I'll pick whoever you point to!" Zhou Tian casually pointed, selected one person, then burst forth with speed, rushing straight towards them.
