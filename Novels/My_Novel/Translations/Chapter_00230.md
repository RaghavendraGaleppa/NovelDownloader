# Chapter 230: The Two Part Ways, the Lady Fumes with Rage

"Where are we going?"

Li Quan and Zhang Hu asked.

Su Qiuwu sneered. "Have you lost your wits after dealing with that beast for so long? Perhaps Wen Caishang is still hiding in the inn? Even if not, how could she have escaped without a trace? There must be clues left behind in the inn. Following the trail is far better than making a scene in the streets, causing a ruckus and making fools of yourselves."

Li Quan shouted, "Su Qiuwu, what's with that attitude?"

Su Qiuwu thought to himself, *They are defeated soldiers, useless. Why should I be polite to the two of you?* He flicked his sleeve and said arrogantly, "If you don't want Wen Caishang to return for revenge and wish to保住 your worthless lives, then lead the way quickly!"

Li Quan and Zhang Hu felt deeply insulted and were indignant. However, upon second thought, if Wen Caishang escaped and returned for revenge, she would surely strike with ruthless ferocity, leading to a miserable end. After a few stubborn retorts, they obediently led the way back to the inn.

The inn's door was tightly shut; the guests had all left. With a kick from Li Quan, the door shattered with a *crack*.

The innkeeper and the attendant were startled. Seeing the two ferocious men, Li Quan and Zhang Hu, return, they trembled with fear. The innkeeper hardened his scalp and cautiously attended to them, "几位大爷, you are..."

Zhang Hu cursed, "You dare to harbor them!" and slapped him. The innkeeper cried out in pain, covering his cheek and wailing, "My lord, I... who am I harboring?"

Li Quan said, "If you hadn't harbored them, how could that boy have escaped yesterday?" He kicked out. The innkeeper was portly and was kicked several zhang away, crashing into several tables. His eyes rolled back, and he breathed more out than in. It was hard to say if he would survive.

Su Qiuwu ignored him, observing the inn's layout. He walked through the kitchen, the guest rooms, the stable... one by one, but found nothing unusual.

He called over the attendant and inquired about the situation yesterday.

The attendant glanced at the innkeeper, fearing the same fate, and trembled as he said, "My lord, regarding the two you mentioned, I do have an impression. It's strange, but while they were in the kitchen, they suddenly vanished."

"But... but how they vanished, I truly... truly didn't see. My lord, spare me... spare me." He knelt and kowtowed.

Li Quan said, "You don't know? I think you just don't want to say!" He grabbed the attendant's hair and yanked hard. With a *tearing* sound, the hair and scalp came off together.

Su Qiuwu investigated carefully and walked to the back door. He frowned slightly. The kitchen was well-stocked with vegetables, and there was a back door leading directly to the street.

"They must have escaped through this door. I'll go outside and take a look; there might be clues."

Outside the back door.

Vegetable leaves were scattered on the ground, and there were tracks left by a carriage wheel. He understood immediately and asked, "Did a vegetable vendor deliver produce last night?"

The attendant hurriedly said, "Yes. Old Zhang from the north of the city delivered vegetables last night. My lord, is there a problem?"

Su Qiuwu sneered, "There's a big problem." He already knew Li Xian's whereabouts. At the same time, he thought, *Wen Caishang's Qi is completely depleted; she won't be able to recover for a short while. That brat, I estimate his abilities are limited. With me, Su Qiuwu, personally taking action, it will be like taking something from a child.*

***

As for last night.

The vegetable vendor, Old Zhang, drove the carriage at a steady pace, humming a folk song, quite at ease. He muttered to himself, "Oh, it's rare today. Such a great beauty, tied up like that, must be so uncomfortable."

"If only I had learned some martial arts when I was young. I could have become a flower-picking bandit, hehe, it wouldn't be a wasted life to die under a peony."

"But then, this old man has the heart but not the courage. If my wife heard this, she'd surely twist my neck off."

"Ah, I'm old now. Speaking of that great beauty, even if she were placed on my bed, I wouldn't have the strength to do anything to her."

The city lights were dim, the street scene bustling. The carriage passed through the busy district, turned three corners, and headed north, where the pedestrians grew sparse.

Inside the carriage.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang lay quietly. Li Xian peered outside, seeing the intricate network of streets and alleys. He figured that although Li Quan and Zhang Hu were formidable, it wouldn't be easy for them to find them.

His heart eased a little.

*Those two fools, although their martial prowess is not bad, are physically disabled, mentally deficient, lustful, and vain. Their threat isn't that great. If all pursuers were like them, I'd thank the heavens.*

Li Xian thought to himself.

He also heard Old Zhang talking to himself, saying how he wanted to be a flower-picking bandit when he was young, had the heart but not the courage, and now that he's old and frail, he's always嫌弃 by his wife. He found it quite amusing.

His mood lifted.

After about half an hour, Old Zhang let out a "Yo," pulled the reins, and stopped the carriage. He patted the dust off his clothes, jumped down from the driver's seat, and shouted, "Wife, I'm back!" He tied up the horse and went inside.

Old Zhang's wife came out to greet him, saying, "You old man, why are you so late today?"

"Ah, don't ask." Old Zhang said, "That inn attendant, young but weak and clumsy, is very inefficient at work."

Old Zhang's family conditions were good; he had a house and a yard, and children. The title 'Vegetable Vendor' had many别称, also called 'Vegetable King' or 'Vegetable Guest'... Among ordinary people, he was considered a well-off family.

He bought produce from farmers at a low price and transported it by carriage to inns, mansions, and other large households.

He made a profit from this, and vegetables and meat were never lacking.

Old Zhang went into the house, and the carriage was parked in the yard. Li Xian let out a soft breath, fearing that leaking their whereabouts would implicate innocent people. So he remained silent throughout.

Li Xian said, "Madam, you can speak now."

Wen Caishang said angrily, "Untie me first." Li Xian skillfully untied her, undid the seven knots, coiled the silken rope into a ball, and put it in his chest pocket. However, Wen Caishang still couldn't move; the force from the "Bone Marrow Point" still lingered in her body. Her situation was very awkward.

Wen Caishang's beautiful eyes flickered. She scrutinized Li Xian's face, her thoughts racing: *Li Xian saved me, which shows his loyalty. But how long can a young man's momentary passion last? The reason he saved me this time might be out of admiration, or perhaps he couldn't bear to see my beauty.*

*Now my Qi is completely depleted, and my body is severely injured, making it difficult to recover. It's extremely hard to survive the pursuit. Will he still be determined to save me when he realizes this? How can a momentary passion last long?*

Her mind was in a tangled mess. She was very skilled at calculating benefits, but among all the myriad benefits, life was the most important. She had exhausted her tricks, was plagued by misfortune, and had no筹码 left. She weighed the pros and cons from every angle and felt that Li Xian held no profit for her.

She was naturally confident in her stunning beauty, and Li Xian might admire her. But she judged others by herself. She had feelings for Li Xian, but they were mostly possessiveness, desire, and appreciation. If examined closely, they were not much different from "the White Horse of the Clouds," "the White Snake in the Sleeve," or "the Treasure in the Manor." To say she would give her life for Li Xian, she would be greatly unwilling. She figured human emotions were just like this.

Amidst her chaotic thoughts, Wen Caishang thought, *I need to test him. Given my current situation, just how much will he do for me!* She cursed, "How dare you disrespect me!"

Li Xian was taken aback. "I respect you very much, Madam."

Wen Caishang said, "Is that so? Then what did you mean earlier when you pretended to be a disciple of the Sword Rain Tower, saying you wanted to enjoy me and humiliate me?"

Li Xian found it strange. "That was a stratagem to deceive the enemy. How could you take it seriously?"

Wen Caishang said, "I'm taking it seriously. According to the Manor's rules, such disrespect—what should be done to you?"

"According to the Manor's rules, disrespecting the Madam, I should be severely punished." Li Xian said truthfully.

Wen Caishang said, "Good, very good. You're taking advantage of the fact that I can't move, speaking of severe punishment so lightly."

Li Xian thought, *The Madam is very different from usual, but...* He felt that Wen Caishang had shed the outer skin of a martial artist and was more like an ordinary woman who was sensitive, capricious, and had jumbled thoughts.

Li Xian thought again, *The Madam has saved my life several times. Although she had her own calculations and treated me as a pawn, I have always benefited from it afterward. Moreover, this solid foundation of martial arts is all thanks to the Madam. Now that she is sensitive, I should indulge her more.* He said softly, "If you wish to punish me, just say it directly, and I will accept the punishment myself."

Wen Caishang raised her eyebrows slightly and said coldly, "I can't move, so I can't punish you. Stab yourself with a sword!"

Li Xian frowned and said, "Madam, there are pursuers behind us. In this world, only the two of us can help each other. If I am injured now, it will be difficult to escape. Could it wait until later, and I will stab myself then?"

Wen Caishang's temper flared. "Hmph! If you don't stab yourself, then just leave. I don't need you to save me."

Li Xian said in a deep voice, "Madam, now is not the time for emotional outbursts."

Wen Caishang said coldly, "So your wings have grown strong, and you say I'm having an emotional outburst. If it weren't for my grace, how could you have obtained this martial art? The most emotional thing I ever did was to spend my efforts nurturing you. Now that your wings are strong, you turn around to bully me."

Li Xian quickly said, "Alright, Madam, I misspoke. Please don't be angry."

Wen Caishang turned her head away, gave a soft huff, and refused to pay him any attention. Li Xian hesitated for a moment, then said, "Alright, if the Madam wants me to stab, then I will." The River-Sinking Sword flashed in his palm, and a deep wound was cut.

Wen Caishang's eyes widened slightly, feeling quite gratified. She suddenly felt that Li Xian was still her possession. She smiled and said, "Good, Little Xian... I understand your heart now. You are very obedient."

Just at that moment, Old Zhang came out to feed the horse. He was humming a folk song, old in age, and still some distance from the carriage, so he didn't notice the two of them at all. Wen Caishang whispered, "That old thief has dirty eyes, seeing me in such a sorry state. His mind is also dirty,不知 how he is thinking of me. Go kill him too, to prevent our whereabouts from leaking. Kill the old and young in the house as well, and bury them on the spot!"

"This..." Li Xian said.

"Little Xian, listen to my command. When we escape in the future, I will reward you handsomely." Wen Caishang said softly.

Li Xian shook his head and said, "Sorry, Madam, I cannot do it."

Wen Caishang's face immediately showed anger. "You dare to disobey my command?!"

Li Xian took a deep breath and said, "A man has things he will and will not do. I must refuse."

"Insolence!" Wen Caishang shouted coldly. "What a 'man has things he will and will not do.' If I say you are unwilling, does that mean you are betraying me?"

Li Xian remained silent.

Wen Caishang's chest heaved with great anger. "You dare to betray me? I knew you were a white-eyed wolf. You see me in trouble and have developed different intentions. Today you disobey my command, and tomorrow you will abandon me."

"I ask you, if I were not injured and told you to kill someone, would you dare to disobey?"

"Hmph." Li Xian was also getting angry. A thought flashed through his mind: *You woman, so hard to please! You have old grudges and are in a危急 situation. I risked my life to save you, and I don't even know if we can escape. Today you are being unreasonable and troublesome; I might as well be bold for once.* He said calmly, "Wen Caishang, that's enough."

"You... you dare to call me by my name?!" Wen Caishang was stunned, her beautiful eyes filled with disbelief.

Li Xian said solemnly, "It's true you have been kind to me, and I, Li Xian, will repay you. But to make me like a puppet, obeying your every word, not distinguishing right from wrong, and killing innocently—this is an absurd fantasy!"

"You... you... how dare you speak to me like this?" Wen Caishang's eyes widened, full of surprise, her imposing manner weakening for a moment. Soon after, indignation and panic surged in her heart.

"You... such audacity, you truly want to betray me? If I die, so be it. But if I miraculously survive, I will make sure your end is miserable!" Wen Caishang threatened coldly.

*At this point, I can't stay in the One Union Manor anymore. So be it. A man repays kindness, but to cower and act like a dog or an ox is truly too boring. The kindness is as heavy as a mountain; I can repay it with my life. That way, I won't owe the debt of gratitude, nor will I damage my true nature,* Li Xian thought.

He said, "Wen Caishang, although you don't treat me as a person, I treat myself as one. I have no intention of betraying you, and I will repay your kindness."

"I, Wen Caishang, may be down on my luck, but I don't need the charity of a wicked servant like you," Wen Caishang said coldly. "趁 I still can't move, you had better leave quickly. Otherwise, I will take your life immediately, you white-eyed wolf."
