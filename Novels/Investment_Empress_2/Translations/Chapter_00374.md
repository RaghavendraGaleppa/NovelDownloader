# Chapter 374: Li Mo is Arrested on the Spot!

Inside the Nether Yin Altar of the Summoning Demon Sect.

The moon was bright and the stars were sparse. Crows flew past the Taoist temple ahead, their cries raucous, their eyes reflecting the waterfall not far away.

It was the dry winter season, yet the waterfall cascaded down, faintly tinged with a blood-red hue.

"Offer your blood to the Primordial Gods with me."

The Summoning Saint Son took the lead, carving a piece of flesh from his arm and tossing it into the pool.

"Offer to the Primordial Gods!"

The cultists all wore expressions of devout fanaticism.

*Ahem.*

Actually, offering the Power of All Living Beings did not require carving out flesh; this was merely a suggestion by the Saint Son.

After all, they were a Demon Sect, and this added to the atmosphere.

Moreover, people tend to believe more deeply in things for which they have paid a price...

Behind the waterfall stood three shrines. The statues inside bore a slight resemblance to those in the Ying family's old mansion. These were the three founders of the Summoning Demon Sect, and also the gods worshipped by every generation of its disciples.

Legend had it that their origins predated the Great Shang Dynasty.

"Saint Son! The Primordial God Statue!"

Suddenly, a Dharma King beside him pointed at the waterfall and cried out in shock.

*Hmm?*

The Summoning Saint Son looked up sharply toward the leftmost shrine within the waterfall, which was currently emitting a faint glow.

"Dream God... it is the Dream God..."

The Dream God had been dormant for many years, not even absorbing the Power of All Living Beings, as if it had completely vanished.

Yet today, it has reacted once more!

"Where is the Power of All Living Beings converging?"

The Summoning Saint Son hurriedly asked the Dharma King beside him to sense it.

The latter remained silent for a moment, then opened his eyes and uttered three words:

"The Eastern Wasteland!"

......

Qinghe County, Li Residence.

Li Mo felt a sense of suffocation. His head buzzing, he looked up and realized where he had fallen asleep—within the Ice Cube's embrace.

Ying Bing had her eyes tightly shut, her eyelashes trembling slightly, faint traces of glistening moisture visible.

He remembered what had happened just moments ago.

He had entered the Ice Cube's dream, met her parents, saw that terrifying Nian Beast, and even met the little Ice Cube, tricking her into calling him "Big Brother"...

But Li Mo was confused.

Why did the Nian Beast find the Ying family ten years ago and kill everyone? And why did it continue to haunt them even ten years later?

"......"

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, deciding that these unsolvable questions could be set aside for now.

Because if his parents caught him in this position... *gasp*...

And the Ice Cube would surely remember everything that happened in the dream...

Li Mo looked at Ying Bing.

The dream had shattered, but she had consumed a great deal of Soul Power just now; she should be genuinely asleep this time.

"I should go back."

Li Mo stood up. Dawn was approaching, and he decided to return to his own room.

However, the moment he stepped out the door, his footsteps froze, his Soul Power detecting something.

Coincidence truly was a strange thing.

In the dark garden, two sneaky figures were approaching his room.

It was Old Li and Ms. Xueqin. They were already right outside Li Mo's room; if he returned now, he would be caught red-handed.

In the blink of an eye.

The genius Li Mo instantly thought of the new ability he had just acquired.

*Body Outside of Body!*

He returned to the Ice Cube's room, gritted his teeth, and painfully plucked one of his own hairs. Instantly, he felt his Soul Power drain away slightly, leaving him with a sense of emptiness, yet he could clearly sense the existence of that hair.

He could even attach his True Origin to it, controlling its rise and fall.

At the doorway.

The couple stared into the pitch-black room. With the naked eye, they couldn't see anything, and they grew suspicious.

"Husband, is Xiao Mo inside?"

"I don't hear breathing, but Xiao Mo is a Body Refining Warrior now, at a higher level than me. It's normal that I can't sense him."

"Should we... go in and take a look?"

Xueqin peered inside, but the room was backlit, and a screen blocked the view of the bed.

The couple respected their child's privacy and had never sneaked into their son's room before.

"I'll go in and check."

Li Dalong crossed his arms, his face stern in the darkness.

"If the brat wakes up suddenly, I'll pretend I'm going to the bathroom and walked into the wrong room by mistake."

Truly, like father, like son.

Unfortunately, while the couple whispered, they didn't notice a single hair floating in through the window and landing on the bed.

Li Dalong entered the room, walked behind the screen, and saw his son lying safely on the bed.

His breathing was faint; you really couldn't hear it unless you got close.

"......"

"Was my sixth sense wrong?"

Li Dalong glanced at him, didn't stay long, and quietly walked back out.

"How was?"

"The brat is in his room."

"Alright then, let's go back to rest."

Xueqin nodded, letting out a sigh of relief, though she felt a strange sense of disappointment.

Li Dalong glanced at the wing room where Ying Bing was staying, feeling that something was still off.

"You go to sleep first, dear."

......

Meanwhile, inside the wing room.

Li Mo, lying next to the Ice Cube, relaxed his mind and immediately stopped the Body Outside of Body technique. He was only at the Body Refining Realm, and he had just returned from the Ice Cube's dream, so maintaining the technique was quite taxing.

Ying Bing's breathing beside him became steady.

"It seems she's sleeping more soundly than ever before."

Li Mo watched her sleeping face quietly for a while, his own eyelids growing heavier.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing' and helping her resolve her nightmare.】
【You have an investment reward waiting to be claimed.】

The system notification sounded.

But sleep was the greatest priority of all. Li Mo hadn't had a good sleep in a long time. The night was short, and after the Ice Cube, Little Princess Jiang was waiting for him inside the World Seed.

"I'll check it tomorrow..."

With that thought, Li Mo fell into a deep, dreamless slumber.

He slept for an unknown amount of time.

When he opened his eyes again, the window paper was透亮 with morning light. The Li Residence was quiet; it sounded like it was still morning.

"Huh? This isn't my room..."

Li Mo yawned before realizing that he had been too exhausted last night and had simply slept right here in the Ice Cube's room.

Taking advantage of the fact that his parents hadn't woken up yet, he got up and pushed the door open.

"Brat!"

A figure jumped out from the bushes—it was the stern-faced Li Dalong.

"!! Dad, why are you here?"

Li Mo's body went rigid.

Li Dalong narrowed his eyes.

"You brat, I finally caught you! You thought you could escape your father's sharp eyes? I knew something was off when I passed by this morning. What were you doing in Xiao Bing'er's room?"

"Eh? This is the Ice Cube's room? I was going to the bathroom last night, did I walk into the wrong room?"

"?"
