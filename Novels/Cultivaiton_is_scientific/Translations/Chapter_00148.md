# Chapter 148: Electromagnetism

Li Shiming sat on the reef of Tianji Island, with Yin Shilan resting beside him with closed eyes. Shortly after his breakthrough to the seventh level of Qi Refining, another Golden Core cultivator returned to the Seven Stars Island. The Golden Core cultivators went to discuss matters, leaving him and Yin Shilan behind.

He felt the spiritual energy vortex within his body—the total amount of spiritual power had increased significantly. He estimated that if he used the top-grade *Diamond Armor*, he could sustain it for over a minute now. 

The increase in spiritual power was one thing, but the improvement in its quality made his spiritual energy far more potent. With his current spiritual power, relying solely on it without any other means, he could defeat five or six of his former selves in combat. 

No wonder only after reaching the late stages of Qi Refining did cultivators gain the right to venture into dangerous waters. Only with such combat strength could one possess a degree of self-preservation in perilous regions.

This unexpected advancement had saved him a considerable amount of time. 

During the bottleneck at the peak of the sixth level of Qi Refining, even his doppelgänger couldn’t assist him—he had to rely entirely on himself to break through. The transition from the mid to late stages of Qi Refining was the most challenging bottleneck in the entire Qi Refining phase. 

Given his three-spiritual-root aptitude, being stuck for months or even years was entirely possible.

Li Shiming then assessed his physical condition. The improvements in strength and speed were exceptionally noticeable. His formidable physique now allowed him to withstand attacks from high-grade offensive magical instruments with his bare body. 

In the current sect, where most Qi Refining cultivators didn’t even possess high-grade magical instruments, his physical prowess alone could allow him to contend with late-stage Qi Refining cultivators. 

If not for the fact that he had crafted a mid-grade magical Gatling gun for his copper corpse, he might not even need the corpse anymore—his current defensive capabilities, strength, and speed had surpassed those of the copper corpse at the peak of Qi Refining.

"True Intent Materialization," Li Shiming murmured to himself. 

Through the records in his IBMz15, he learned what had happened during his epiphany. The phantom of the Wrathful Vajra that had appeared behind him sent chills down his spine—it was something beyond the comprehension of science. 

However, according to Master Duhai, True Intent Materialization was highly beneficial for cultivators. 

Master Duhai’s gaze at the time had been so intense that Li Shiming suspected if not for Elder Yin’s presence, the monk might have forcibly taken him back to the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect.

Thinking of Master Duhai, he took out the wooden talisman the monk had given him and toyed with it. 

The talisman was made of wood, but not ordinary wood—it was a second-grade spiritual wood, a material typically used to forge spiritual artifacts. The fact that it had been used to craft a talisman spoke volumes about its significance.

"Shiming, let me hold onto the talisman for now," Yin Shilan suddenly opened her eyes and extended her delicate hand, speaking softly. 

It was rare for her to request something from him, but the resolute look on her face made Li Shiming chuckle as he handed the talisman over. 

He understood—she was worried he might join the Buddhist sect. 

In the past, Yin Shilan wouldn’t have been concerned, but after witnessing Li Shiming manifest the Wrathful Vajra’s True Intent Materialization in front of her father and multiple Golden Core cultivators, his astonishing affinity for Buddhist techniques had even raised suspicions that he might be the reincarnation of a great Buddhist master. 

At the very least, Master Duhai’s gift of the talisman hinted at such thoughts. 

If Li Shiming entered the Ten Thousand Buddhas Sect, they would undoubtedly have methods to determine whether he was the reincarnation of a Buddhist master.

Yin Shilan happily stored the talisman away, and the two exchanged a knowing smile. Years of companionship had rendered words unnecessary.

Whether due to Li Shiming’s increased cultivation or his deepening understanding of Tianji Island’s formation from constant repairs, it took only seven days for them to fully restore the island’s formation. 

On the other islands, formation masters were still working on repairs, and it seemed they wouldn’t finish anytime soon. 

Fortunately, Zhuge Xuan didn’t suggest assisting them—apparently, the restoration of formations was also a form of competition among sects.

Over those seven days, Golden Core cultivators came and went, but judging by their expressions, the rogue Golden Core swordsman still hadn’t been found.

"We’ll be staying on the island for a few more days. You two can rest freely in the meantime," Zhuge Xuan instructed.

"Uncle-Master, here are the remaining materials." Li Shiming handed over a storage pouch containing surplus materials.

"Keep the extra materials for yourself. The amount provided was calculated based on the formation’s damage—any savings are yours to keep," Zhuge Xuan said with a smile, waving his hand dismissively.

Li Shiming’s eyes lit up. The storage pouch contained many high-quality materials. 

The Seven Stars Island was a frequent residence for Golden Core cultivators, so while the formation materials weren’t third-grade, there were plenty of second-grade materials—
