# Chapter 90: Tragic Carnage

Chen Tiangang laughed heartily. "I taught you all your martial arts. How could there be any flaws? I know them inside and out."

As he spoke, he reached out without hesitation toward Ning Wuque's chest. His five fingers hooked like claws, carrying a fierce and ruthless force as they tore directly through Ning Wuque's flesh.

Ning Wuque felt a searing pain in his chest, as if a red-hot branding iron had been brutally pressed against it. Blood gushed out like a spring.

Ning Wuque suddenly realized that the blood in his body was surging violently like boiling magma. His blood vessels felt as if they might burst from the intense pressure at any moment.

Chen Tiangang laughed wildly, the sound like the cry of an owl echoing throughout the sect, filled with a terrifying madness.

Using some unknown method, he laughed as he pulled a dark golden blood clot from Ning Wuque's chest. The blood clot seemed to be alive, writhing and struggling in his palm. Moments later, it mysteriously took the shape of a cicada.

"True Blood, True Blood! Thirty years of planning, and finally, I've waited for this Blood Cicada to mature! I wonder which True Immortal's bloodline it is."

Chen Tiangang's laughter grew even more frenzied, filled with the excitement of imminent success.

One who possesses True Blood has the ability to transform their body, eliminate toxins within, cleanse the physique, and even regrow severed limbs.

He had waited for this moment for a very, very long time.

Now, he had finally matured Ning Wuque.

"My good disciple, it wasn't in vain that I provoked you all these years. But your gentle nature truly troubled me for a long time before I found that girl Chu Xuan to help."

"Father!?"

Chu Xuan's face turned pale as she looked at the demon-like Chen Tiangang in disbelief.

Ning Wuque, who had collapsed powerlessly on the ground, stared fixedly at Chen Tiangang. His pale face carried a trace of ferocity, ignoring the grievous wound on his chest.

"General Cui, aren't you going to make your move?"

Chen Tiangang suddenly looked up to see a tall horse covered in scales charging toward him from the direction of the sect gate, galloping up from the training grounds.

Sitting atop the horse was a figure as massive as a mountain, clad in heavy black armor that resembled hard black iron, radiating a cold luster.

He held a broad-bladed halberd in his hand. As the horse galloped, the blade shook, dragging along the ground and sending up sparks as it carved a deep furrow into the earth.

"Enough noise."

A deep, thunderous voice boomed out. The next moment, the cavalryman had already charged before Chen Tiangang. The halberd he had been dragging suddenly swept upward.

As the broad-bladed halberd swung rapidly, it rubbed fiercely against the air, and the blade instantly turned red, like a crimson dragon, carrying a ferocious and unrivaled force.

The scorching air current rushed forward, making everyone nearby feel a wave of searing heat. The dryness forced them to take several steps back.

"A Treasure Artifact?"

Chen Tiangang's expression turned solemn. A weapon one step above the Sharp Grade is a Treasure Artifact. Driven by blood energy, it can unleash blade qi.

Beneath his skin, blood-red patterns spread rapidly like the veins of a cicada's wing.

The tip of his foot tapped the ground in an irregular rhythm. His body, like a puppet pulled by invisible threads, retreated rapidly in a strange zigzag trajectory.

The slash missed. A scorching blade light shot out from the edge of the halberd, heavily striking a nearby house. The entire building collapsed with a roar and was quickly engulfed in flames.

The cavalryman missed his strike, a hint of surprise flashing in his eyes. He drew the broad-bladed halberd back in an arc through the air, then squeezed his horse's flanks hard with his legs. The scaled horse let out a neigh and charged toward Chen Tiangang again with lightning speed.

"Heh..."

Chen Tiangang had no intention of fighting him. He only cared about the dark golden blood clot in his hand. Moving his feet rapidly, he quickly disappeared into the continuous buildings of the sect.

Seeing this, General Cui had no choice but to pull back on his steed and stop his pursuit.

He looked back. In the entire training ground, not a single person from the Tian Chan Sect was left standing.

General Cui glanced at Ning Wuque lying in a pool of blood, sneered, and waved his hand.

"Forget it. Go elsewhere. Kill them all, down to the last chicken and dog! That old dog, I'll handle him myself."

Squadrons of Tiger Vanguard clad in black armor surged like a flood into the Tian Chan Sect's buildings. In the training ground, apart from a dozen or so stationed soldiers, only mangled limbs and broken corpses remained.

Xu Yunfan appeared silently beside Ning Wuque and Chu Xuan, looking at the two who still had breath left with some surprise.

He had been watching from the side for a long time. He hadn't expected Chu Xuan to face death with the Tian Chan Sect at the critical moment.

What was all the usual scheming for?

Ridiculous.

Having lost his True Blood, Ning Wuque stared blankly at the sky, his mouth opening and closing as if he couldn't believe he had ended up in such a state.

Seeing Xu Yunfan appear, Chu Xuan struggled violently, as if fueled by her last spark of life, her movements intense.

"Kill him, Junior Brother... Help me, kill him! He... betrayed the sect, becoming a lackey for the imperial court!"

Her voice, hoarse from anger and pain, was nearly a shriek.

Chu Xuan's heart was filled with flames of hatred.

Ning Wuque deserved to die, and Chen Tiangang deserved to die too.

Looking at the barely breathing Ning Wuque, the scenes of laughter and joy within the Tian Chan Sect from days past, along with the faces of fellow disciples lying in pools of blood, kept surfacing in Chu Xuan's mind.

She only hoped that Xu Yunfan would strike immediately to end Ning Wuque's life.

Xu Yunfan remained silent. There was no intention of bringing the War Drum Golden Hammer down. The two of them were merely Chen Tiangang's pawns, the ones who caused this tragedy. Even with a heart as hard as iron, he felt a sense of sorrow.

Their injuries were now beyond recovery, and he didn't want to waste his strength.

"Who goes there!"

A squad leader roared. A dozen or so black-armored soldiers drew their blades, glaring fiercely as if they would charge over at any second.

Xu Yunfan moved first. The moment his foot shattered the blue bricks, the muscles of his calf tightened like steel cables.

The muscles of his shoulder blades tensed like a bowstring. When the Golden Hammer tore through the air, it created a visible vortex. Before the hammer head even touched the body, the wind pressure it generated had already blown away the banners thirty feet away.

*Bang!*

The black-armored soldier at the forefront had barely contracted his pupils to pinpricks when his iron-embedded helmet shattered like an eggshell. Bone fragments and brain matter splattered out in a radial pattern. The headless corpse, not yet fallen, still maintained its posture of raising a blade. The blood gushing from the neck stained a warhorse twenty feet away crimson.

Xu Yunfan twisted his waist and hips. His spine cracked segment by segment like firecrackers.

The heavy hammer划出 a full moon arc. The second soldier's chest armor caved in like a bowl. Amidst the crisp sound of shattered breastbone, arterial blood sprayed out like a fan, turning the ground within five steps a dark red.

"Form the formation!"

The squad leader's roar was already trembling.

Twelve broadswords slashed down simultaneously, but sparks flew the moment they touched Xu Yunfan's waist muscles. His entire body's muscles had contracted instantly into a solid slab of iron.

The recoil force shattered the soldiers' grips. Xu Yunfan had already spun around for a horizontal sweep.

Wherever the Golden Hammer passed, four arms holding blades were severed at the elbow. Severed limbs flew through the air amidst a rain of blood.

One soldier had his side face grazed by the hammer wind. Half his face peeled away instantly, revealing a white jawbone.

When the last soldier was pierced in the abdomen by the hammer head and nailed into the earthen wall, Xu Yunfan's entire body's muscles bulged and rippled. Dark red blood lines writhed like living snakes beneath his skin, and his veins, like tiny green snakes, constantly undulated.
