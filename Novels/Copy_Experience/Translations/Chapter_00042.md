# Chapter 42: News of a High-Grade Alchemist

After returning home, Lu Xu put the spirit stones into his storage bag. During this period, he had earned a thousand spirit stones from Gao Tianqiang. Including what he already had, he now possessed one thousand five hundred low-grade spirit stones and two mid-grade spirit stones. He had over a hundred low-grade talismans and eighty mid-grade talismans of the first rank.

"I can barely control those two high-grade magic artifacts now. With so many talismans, I can easily crush any opponent in the Mid-Qi Condensation stage!" Lu Xu thought. "Even against experts in the Late-Qi Condensation stage, I'm not afraid, as long as the gap isn't too wide!"

"It's already the end of the year. Soon, next year, I'll have another chance to copy experience. This time, I must find a high-grade alchemist!" Lu Xu couldn't help but sigh inwardly. "I wonder how the old man's inquiries are coming along. It's truly difficult to meet a high-grade alchemist!"

Even in a place like Tianmen City, with tens of thousands of cultivators, there were only a handful of high-grade alchemists. Each one held an incredibly noble status, a presence rarely seen by ordinary people. Lu Xu had no chance of meeting a high-grade alchemist on his own, so he could only place his hopes on local informants.

A few days later, Lu Xu left his small courtyard and arrived at the teahouse once more. He transformed into a burly, rugged-faced man, sat down at a table, ordered a cup of spirit tea, and slowly savored it. At the same time, he pricked up his ears, carefully listening to the conversations between the surrounding cultivators:

"These rogue cultivators have been getting increasingly restless lately!"
"Indeed, I heard that the Ghost Mask Alliance actually moved to annihilate the Green Bamboo Sect!"
"These two major rogue cultivator organizations are truly more ruthless than the last. The Black Robe Society wiped out the Mo family of Qinghu, and now the Ghost Mask Alliance has targeted the Green Bamboo Sect!"
"With rogue cultivators so rampant, I fear the cultivation world of Wei Kingdom will descend into complete chaos soon."
"Alas, in such a chaotic situation, what are we rogue cultivators to do?"

"The Ghost Mask Alliance also made a move?" A look of surprise appeared in Lu Xu's eyes. The Ghost Mask Alliance was a powerful force, ranking alongside the Black Robe Society as one of the two major rogue cultivator organizations in Wei Kingdom. The Green Bamboo Sect, which they destroyed, was also one of the nine major forces in Wei Kingdom, though like the Mo family, it was at the bottom.

"The Green Bamboo Sect was close to the Thousand Absolute Sect. It's said that their sect leader originated from the Thousand Absolute Sect. Do you think the Ghost Mask Alliance destroying the Green Bamboo Sect is related to this?"
"Hiss, Fellow Daoist makes a good point. The Black Robe Society destroyed the Mo family, and the Ghost Mask Alliance destroyed the Green Bamboo Sect... Could these two forces be..."
"Hehe, this is probably a struggle between the Thousand Absolute Sect and the Wei family. How interesting!"

After listening for a moment and understanding the current situation in Wei Kingdom, Lu Xu stood up and walked towards a certain room on the upper floor of the teahouse. An old man was waiting for him there.

"Fellow Daoist Bai, the matter you asked me to inquire about last time now has some leads!" The old man said with a smile as soon as he saw Lu Xu. Bai Xingzuo was the identity Lu Xu had assumed for this burly, rugged-faced man.

"Fellow Daoist Kuang's information is truly well-informed. Please elaborate. As long as the information is accurate, my compensation will certainly not disappoint you!"

"Hehe, Fellow Daoist, don't rush, don't rush. Have you ever heard of a 'secret market'?" The old man, surnamed Kuang, unaware that Lu Xu had already visited a secret market once, specifically gave him a rundown of various information related to Tianmen City's secret markets. Of course, this secret market was not the one controlled by Daoist Qingye.

A moment later.

"You mean, this high-grade alchemist will appear in the secret market to compete for that spirit herb?"

"Yes, that's a Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma. Fellow Daoist may not have heard of this name, but you just need to know that it's the main ingredient for refining the Barrier-Breaking Pill!" the old man said with a smile.

"Barrier-Breaking Pill?!" Lu Xu exclaimed, showing an expression of great surprise and shock. He looked as if he was hearing it for the first time. In reality, as an alchemist himself, he was already very familiar with the Nine-Leaf Spirit Ganoderma and the Barrier-Breaking Pill. The Barrier-Breaking Pill was a first-rank high-grade medicinal pill, used to assist cultivators in breaking through the Late-Qi Condensation stage bottleneck.

Seeing Lu Xu's reaction, the old man stroked his beard and smiled: "It seems there's no need for this old man to elaborate on the Barrier-Breaking Pill's renown. Since Fellow Daoist has heard of it, you should know its value!"

Lu Xu nodded: "If Bai were a high-grade alchemist, hearing that the main ingredient for a Barrier-Breaking Pill appeared in a secret market, I would also go immediately!"

"Precisely. No alchemist would miss this spirit herb. If its origin wasn't so difficult to explain, this spirit herb probably wouldn't have ended up in an underground secret market!"

"I need more detailed information!" Lu Xu then discussed in detail with the old man for a moment, learning that the spirit herb had been entrusted by a mysterious figure to the owner of a secret market for exchange. After clarifying the detailed information about that secret market, he left five spirit stones and departed.

Not long after Lu Xu left the teahouse, the figure of a burly strongman appeared nearby. He watched Lu Xu's departing back from afar and muttered: "His face is completely different from the talisman master in the portrait, but the Scent-Sniffing Worm indeed identified this person. Did this person truly obtain Xiao Hu's Hundred Illusions Mask?"

"It seems there's no mistake. Even if Xiao Hu's death wasn't directly caused by this person, it must be related to him!" Hatred flared in the burly strongman's eyes. He spread his hand, and a spirit insect buzzed as it flapped its wings and flew out, heading in Lu Xu's direction. The burly strongman immediately followed.

Back home.

"That secret market will be held in ten days. I must go!" Lu Xu thought to himself. "And the main ingredient for the Barrier-Breaking Pill is appearing. I can't let that go either; Barrier-Breaking Pills are very rare on the market!"

Cultivators with medium or low spiritual roots were often trapped by the Late-Qi Condensation stage bottleneck for over a decade. Lu Xu certainly didn't want to spend that much time slowly grinding through the bottleneck. He had already copied all of Daoist Qingye's Qi Condensation stage experience. This old daoist, possessing a medium-to-high wood spiritual root, took over seven years to break through the Late-Qi Condensation stage bottleneck. Although his spiritual root was different from Lu Xu's, his experience was still very valuable for reference. With this old daoist's experience, coupled with the assistance of the Barrier-Breaking Pill, Lu Xu had hope of breaking through this bottleneck within one to two years.

Ten days later, Lu Xu left his courtyard. As usual, he used the bronze mask to change his appearance. After circling Tianmen City a few times, he headed directly for the city gate. Not long after he left the city gate, the burly strongman's figure also appeared there. Watching Lu Xu's departing back, a cruel smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.
