# Chapter 3: Advancing to a Martial Artist; Martial Skill: Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist!

On the road, Su Yu playfully turned the wooden box in his hand. Inside were precisely the sixteen Blood Qi Pills he had won from Li Hu.

“How wonderful,” Su Yu mused, licking his lips and smiling. “Just when I wanted to sleep, someone delivered a pillow. I wish more people like this would come along!”

Gazing at the Blood Qi Pills he’d acquired for free, Su Yu couldn’t help but exclaim, “That Li Hu truly is a wealth-sending boy!” He’d gained sixteen Blood Qi Pills without any effort, a fact that thrilled Su Yu to no end. Now, it was time for the exciting part.

Su Yu moistened his dry lips and opened his Synthesis Panel. He placed two Blood Qi Pills into the slots. He repeated this process until all sixteen Blood Qi Pills had been synthesized into eight Blood Refinement Pills.

“Blood Qi Pills can synthesize into Tier 2 Blood Refinement Pills,” Su Yu mused. “I wonder if Blood Refinement Pills can be synthesized further!” At this thought, a bold idea sparked in his mind. If he could continue synthesizing, wouldn't he obtain even better items? Even Blood Refinement Pills could significantly boost blood qi, so what kind of treasures would a pill synthesized from Blood Refinement Pills turn out to be? With this thought, Su Yu placed two Blood Refinement Pills into the Synthesis Panel. A description appeared:

“Blood Refinement Pill: Tier 2 pill, can greatly enhance the body's blood qi intensity. Effects diminish with excessive consumption.”

“Synthesize?”

“Synthesize!” Su Yu tapped the button. Golden light flashed once more, and the Blood Refinement Pills vanished.

Compared to the prices of Tier 1 martial skills, which started at ten thousand yuan, the superior value of his synthesized pills was clear. Su Yu smiled faintly, looking at the Body Tempering Pill in his hand. With this item, becoming a martial artist didn't seem like a difficult feat at all!

Su Yu sat cross-legged on his bed, adjusting himself to his peak state, then solemnly placed the Body Tempering Pill into his mouth. The next moment, an energy far more potent than that of a Blood Refinement Pill surged through his entire body. Immediately, Su Yu felt his blood qi boiling like molten lava. He quickly regulated his blood qi, slowly absorbing the immense medicinal power. Time flowed gently as he cultivated.

The next day, as sunlight streamed in, Su Yu slowly opened his eyes. A flash of crimson light gleamed within them. Over the course of the night, Su Yu had consumed two Body Tempering Pills, successfully pushing his blood qi to 1! This signified that Su Yu had successfully become a martial artist! A true martial artist, not merely a quasi-martial artist! An undeniable surge of excitement filled Su Yu’s heart.

Su Yu grew even more excited. However, synthesizing the Body Tempering Pills seemed most important right now. Su Yu expertly placed the Body Tempering Pills into the Synthesis Panel. Golden light flashed. Within the central slot of the panel, a white pill with faint golden threads rested quietly.

“Bone Tempering Pill: Tier 4 pill, 100% increases 1 point of Blood Qi. After consumption, the user will be completely powerless for one hour. Please use with caution!”

A Tier 4 pill! A Tier 4 pill had actually appeared in his Synthesis Panel! In the entire Heng City, he had never heard of a Tier 4 pill. Even if they existed, they wouldn't be easily exposed. After all, Tier 4 pills were effective even for full-fledged martial artists. Su Yu's breathing quickened. He carefully hid the Bone Tempering Pill in the wooden box, then placed it in a secret corner.

Earlier, on his way, Su Yu had passed a shop. A clerk had immediately noticed him and called out, “Sir, interested in taking a look at some martial skills?” Martial skills? Hearing those words, Su Yu's interest was piqued. He entered the shop. “Sir, we have all sorts of Tier 1 martial skills here. Which one has caught your eye?” the clerk asked, giving Su Yu a fawning smile. Su Yu's gaze swept over the display counter. Various martial skills caught his attention: “Mountain Cleaving Fist, Tier 1 martial skill: Recommended for quasi-martial artists! Price: Ten thousand yuan!” “Crushing Fist, Tier 1 martial skill: Recommended for quasi-martial artists! Price: Ten thousand yuan!” Seeing the prices of these martial skills, Su Yu quickly lost his curiosity.

Instead, he decided to try synthesizing his own. “First, let's see if these ordinary manuals can synthesize into martial skills. If they can, it'll be a massive profit!” Su Yu enthusiastically opened his Synthesis Panel and placed a “Tai Chi Fist Manual” into a slot. Beside the slot, a small line of text popped up:

“Tai Chi Fist Manual: An essential tonic for old men in the square to stay healthy!”

“Synthesize?”

“Synthesize!” Su Yu tapped the button, and a golden light flashed. In the central slot, an ancient book quietly lay.

“Introductory Tai Chi Fist: Explains the essence of Tai Chi Fist in detail, slightly helping you join the trend of old men in the square faster!”

Lines of black formed on Su Yu's forehead. “Continue synthesizing!” Su Yu synthesized twenty Tai Chi Fist Manuals into ten Introductory Tai Chi Fists, then synthesized two Introductory Tai Chi Fists.

“Tai Chi Fist True Interpretation: Detailed depiction of the essence of Tai Chi Fist, greatly helping you join the trend of old men in the square!”

Su Yu's expression grew even uglier. “I refuse to believe it! With so many, I can't synthesize even a single Tier 1 martial skill!” Su Yu once again placed two Tai Chi Fist True Interpretations into the panel.

“Synthesize!”

*Hum!* Another golden light flashed. A parchment scroll appeared in Su Yu's vision.

“Yin-Yang Tai Chi Fist: Peak Tier 2 martial skill. Offers a chance to comprehend the intent of Yin and Yang. When cultivated to perfection, it can rival a Tier 3 martial skill! Recommended cultivation level: Martial Artist!”

Su Yu's eyes widened in shock. “A peak Tier 2 martial skill!”

Meanwhile, in an office somewhere in the school...

“Hmm? Why is there an unfamiliar martial artist's aura in the school?” The old man's face grew solemn. The next moment, he vanished from his office.
