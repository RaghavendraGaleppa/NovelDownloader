# Chapter 54: Superior-Grade Talisman Brush and Mid-Grade Fireball Talisman  

In the southeastern part of Fengyue Sect's inner sect stood the Treasure Peak and its Treasure Pavilion.  

Qi Chuan appeared outside the Treasure Pavilion, glanced at the inner disciples coming and going, and stepped inside. Upon entering the grand hall, he made his way directly to a counter selling tools.  

Only a few people were ahead of him, and soon it was Qi Chuan's turn.  

"What do you need?" asked the female attendant behind the counter, a graceful cultivator who offered him a gentle smile.  

"A set of talisman-making tools," Qi Chuan stated his purpose directly.  

"Talisman-making tools? Is this inner disciple planning to learn talisman crafting?" The attendant couldn't help but glance at Qi Chuan in surprise.  

Among inner disciples, few chose to pursue talisman-making alongside their cultivation. Most focused solely on advancing their own strength. Talisman-making was a skill heavily dependent on innate talent—unrelated to spiritual roots. Even the many cultivation geniuses in the inner sect might not necessarily succeed if they attempted it.  

However, since this disciple had made his choice, she didn't press further and simply asked, "A full set of talisman-making tools includes a spirit brush, ink, and talisman paper, each graded as inferior, medium, superior, or supreme. The quality significantly affects the success rate. What grade do you need?"  

After a moment's thought, Qi Chuan replied, "A superior-grade spirit brush, three bottles of inferior-grade ink, and one hundred sheets of inferior-grade talisman paper. That's all."  

The spirit brush was the most critical tool for talisman-making, directly influencing the success rate, so it made sense to invest in a high-quality one. Once his skills advanced to the upper-tier level, the superior-grade brush would still serve him well. As for supreme-grade brushes, they were far too expensive and unnecessary at this stage.  

Ink and paper, being consumables, could start at the inferior grade. Since he was still a novice, practicing with lower-quality materials was sufficient. He could upgrade to medium or superior grades once his skills improved.  

"Here are the tools you requested. The total is thirty-three inner sect contribution points, or you can pay in spirit stones."  

The attendant soon handed him the complete set.  

The superior-grade brush, named the Mystic Ivory Brush, was practically equivalent to a high-grade magical artifact. Its shaft was crafted from the ivory of a high-tier demon beast, while the bristles were made from the ear-tip fur of a Moon Silver Wolf—its quality was beyond question.  

The ink and paper were simpler. The ink was a blend of powdered Crimson Spirit Sand and the blood of a low-tier demon rabbit, while the paper was made from fibers of a low-tier spirit herb called Talisman Grass. Higher grades of Talisman Grass existed, but Qi Chuan had opted for the basic version for now.  

Inspecting the set, Qi Chuan nodded in satisfaction and promptly handed over three hundred and thirty low-grade spirit stones.  

"With this, I'm left with only a few dozen spirit stones and a handful of contribution points," he mused as he left the Treasure Pavilion.  

But as a low-tier talisman master with room for growth, he was confident he'd earn back his investment soon.  

Back in his high-tier cave abode, Qi Chuan immediately set to work.  

In a quiet chamber, the white jade-like Mystic Ivory Brush, crimson ink, and yellowish-brown talisman paper were neatly arranged on a stone table. Seated before it, Qi Chuan dipped the brush into the ink, placed a sheet of paper in front of him, and began drawing with fluid motions.  

Within moments, the brush lifted—the process seamless.  

"Done already?"  

He examined the Fireball Talisman in his hand. The intricate runes formed a talisman array, faintly resembling flickering flames—the signature pattern required for this type of talisman.  

However, it was still incomplete.  

While the array had been successfully drawn, it lacked the crucial step of spiritual infusion—channeling his mana into the inscribed pattern.  

This step was just as critical.  

A single mistake would cause the entire talisman to spontaneously combust, wasting all effort. Moreover, it was notoriously tricky.  

Each rune—and even individual strokes within them—required precise amounts of mana. Too much or too little in any spot would ruin the talisman.  

"But while other talisman masters must tread carefully here, for me, it's effortless."  

Qi Chuan smiled faintly.  

His hand formed a seal as he drew mana from his dantian. Threads of energy flowed through his meridians and out his fingertips, settling into the talisman array with pinpoint accuracy.  

Moments later, he withdrew his hand and observed the result.  

The entire array now shimmered as one, faint heat radiating from it.  

A low-tier Fireball Talisman—completed!  

Not just any low-tier talisman, but a flawless one. Though of the same grade, its power far surpassed the crude version the burly rogue cultivator had once used—likely by at least two-thirds.  

"My first self-made talisman!"  

"Indeed, mastery of the Fireball Technique provides immense support in crafting Fireball Talismans, especially during the infusion phase."  

Qi Chuan gazed at the perfect talisman with satisfaction.  

Even a mid-tier talisman master might not handle the infusion as smoothly as he, a low-tier master, had. His deep understanding of the Fireball Technique, honed to mastery, made the mana structuring process second nature—closely mirroring the principles of talisman infusion.  

**[You have successfully crafted a low-tier Fireball Talisman. Triggered 45x multiplier. Gained 45x rewards. Your experience in crafting Fireball Talismans has improved.]**  

Words appeared before his eyes, followed by a surge of knowledge about talisman-making techniques.  

Absorbing this, Qi Chuan felt his skills advance noticeably—as though he had crafted forty-five talismans in an instant, refining his proficiency through sheer repetition.  

"At this rate, I’ll likely reach mid-tier talisman mastery soon."  

With that thought, he resumed his practice, producing one Fireball Talisman after another.  

**[You have successfully crafted a low-tier Fireball Talisman. Triggered 30x multiplier. Gained 30x rewards. Your experience in crafting Fireball Talismans has improved.]**  

**[You have successfully crafted a low-tier Fireball Talisman. Triggered 40x multiplier. Gained 40x rewards. Your experience in crafting Fireball Talismans has improved.]**  

...  

Over the next two days, aside from his usual cultivation routine, Qi Chuan dedicated himself entirely to talisman-making. With each attempt, his skills grew exponentially under the influence of his golden finger.  

Then, on the morning of the third day, as he completed his thirty-first talisman, something unexpected happened.  

**[You have successfully crafted a mid-tier Fireball Talisman. Triggered 100x multiplier. Gained 100x rewards. Your experience in crafting Fireball Talismans has improved. You have advanced to mid-tier talisman master.]**  

Qi Chuan stared at the words in astonishment.  

"W-what? I actually crafted a mid-tier Fireball Talisman using low-tier materials?"
