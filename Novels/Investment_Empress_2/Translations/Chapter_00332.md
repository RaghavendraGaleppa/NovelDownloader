Chapter 332: Matching Outfits? The Life-Prolonging Pill

In the Jia Wei Restaurant.

Under the system's persistent notifications, the Ice Fairy finally snapped out of her reverie and looked at the rewards. Though it was unclear just how much she truly cared about them.

[Host, the reward for first place is worlds apart compared to the second place.]

The system offered a rare reminder.

"Oh."

[Would you like to claim it now?]

"Claim."

Ying Bing took a light sip of tea and subconsciously nodded.

In the next second, a long sword appeared on the table. All its anomalies were sealed by the system, yet even so, it looked extraordinary to the naked eye.

The sword was three feet and three inches long, slender and elongated. The blade's edge seemed to be shrouded in a mist of colorful frost. Near the hilt, there was a hollow cavity where a divine light appeared to leap within.

[Reward 1: Moon's Yin]

There was no need to read the system description. The moment Ying Bing took the sword, she knew its origin.

Moon's Yin, also known as the Beauty Under the Moon, was a divine weapon.

On the Divine Weapon Registry of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, it ranked fourth. Among swords, it was second only to the Divine Sword of Heaven and Man stored in the Heavenly Human Realm of the Imperial Capital.

It was also the sword she had wielded in her previous life.

*Hummm—*

Although Moon's Yin did not display its divine power, it emitted a faint chime. A divine weapon has a spirit. Though it could not speak, it expressed its confusion through its sword intent.

It sounded like a young girl, asking in a crisp voice:

"I don't know you, yet I feel a sense of familiarity."

"Then you must be obedient from now on."

Ying Bing's eyes showed a hint of nostalgia. Her fair, slender fingers gently stroked the spine of the blade.

"If I acknowledge you as my master, will you take me to meet good friends?"

Moon's Yin conveyed curiosity and longing.

Hearing this familiar question, Ying Bing was stunned.

In her previous life, when Moon's Yin had acknowledged her as its master, it had asked the same question.

She had said "yes" without hesitation back then.

Who would have thought that the Lady of the Osmanthus Palace, who never lied, would end up deceiving a weapon.

Actually, it wasn't Ying Bing's fault.

Besides its master, a divine weapon does not consider anyone else a friend. Their friends are naturally other weapons.

Without intelligence, one cannot speak of making friends. But aside from Destiny Tools and divine weapons, where would other weapons get their intelligence?

The Lady of the Osmanthus Palace stood aloof from the world. She didn't even have friends herself, so where was she supposed to find friends for Moon's Yin?

"Take you to meet new friends..."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and thought for a moment. Her jade-like face softened.

"I will."

"What kind of new friends?"

"A hammer."

"Wow."

Moon's Yin became happy and excited. It didn't care what kind of friend it was, as long as it wasn't the annoying type.

None of its previous masters had ever taken it to meet a hammer friend.

Thus, with expectations for its new friend, Moon's Yin was stored away inside the Big Head Doll.

A flicker of joy passed through Ying Bing's eyes.

It wasn't just because she had acquired a divine weapon. After all, Moon's Yin could only be used as a trump card. For a Divine Vision Realm cultivator to try and activate a divine weapon was far too forced. It would be good enough if she could utilize a fraction of its power in a critical moment.

Even for her, she would at least need to reach the Ninth Heaven of the Inner Scene, or even the Outer Scene.

[Reward 2: One bottle of Immortal Spirit Qi.]

[Immortal Spirit Qi]: "The first human cultivator to ascend to immortality in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, feeling sympathy for the hardships of humanity after their ascension, did not take away the Great Dao they controlled. Instead, they stored the first wave of Immortal Spirit Qi they bathed in within this bottle, leaving it for future generations."

Immortal Spirit Qi?!

This should be the first item among the system's rewards that is related to 'Immortal'!

Immortal Spirit Qi does exist in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, but it is extremely scarce. It seems this is not naturally born in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, and it is enough to make the Seventh and even Eighth Realm cultivators turn green with envy.

For example, it could be used to refine divine treasures like the Nine-Aperture Dragon-Tiger Golden Pill.

For example, it could be used to forge divine weapons, set up formations, and even...

Repair a Destiny Tool!

Furthermore, it could be used on oneself. For instance, using it to power martial arts, or even storing it in the Dantian to slowly transform the body, until the body itself carries a trace of Immortal Spirit Qi.

"I'll keep this for now."

---

Ying Bing carefully put it away.

There was one last reward.

It was two... pieces of clothing?

[Reward 3: One set of Pure Yang Long Shirt.]

[Pure Yang Long Shirt]: "When worn alone, it is a top-tier Earth Grade garment. When using any martial art, one gains a Yang-type boost. Be warned, do not wear it alone for too long, as it may cause excessive Yang energy, making it difficult to control oneself."

"If cultivated with a person wearing the Taiyin Immortal Skirt, Yin and Yang can be harmonized, achieving twice the result with half the effort. One can also comprehend the Dao of Yin and Yang, with boundless mysteries."

[Note]: "This garment is strictly forbidden for women. If a woman wears it, over time, the Yin energy within her body will dissipate..."

Ying Bing: "?"

What did the system mean by giving her a reward she couldn't use?

But it would be a pretty good gift for Li Mo...

Just as she was thinking this.

[Congratulations, Host. Since you have obtained first place this time, an additional reward has been added.]

[Reward 4: One set of Taiyin Immortal Skirt.]

[Taiyin Immortal Skirt]: "When worn alone, it is a top-tier Earth Grade garment. When using any martial art, one gains a Yin-type boost..."

The description was similar to the Pure Yang Long Shirt, but the two were opposites.

The Taiyin Immortal Skirt could not be worn by men. However, when worn together with someone in the Pure Yang Long Shirt, Yin and Yang can be harmonized...

The two pieces of clothing lay quietly on the table.

One was pure white, embroidered with a golden sun using profound and majestic golden thread.

The other was a dark-colored immortal skirt, embroidered with the Taiyin using mysterious Yin threads.

When placed together, the air itself seemed to become thick.

Opposites attract...

Even a fool could tell that these two garments were a set.

"......"

Ying Bing pressed her lips together.

If she knew about a certain Li Mo's past life memories, she would understand why she felt this strange sensation in her heart.

Isn't this just a couple's outfit?

.......

On the other side.

Li Mo tossed and turned, unable to sleep. When he turned his head, he saw the pearl-white silk stockings not far from his pillow.

Throwing one's stockings around carelessly after washing one's feet was truly a bad habit!

Little Li Mo felt his mother was absolutely right.

Now, the moment he closed his eyes, he could smell that faint fragrance...

He was already able to turn over with some difficulty. It was also possible to grit his teeth and sit up.

But his hands still had no sensation. It was a miracle that the hammer blow hadn't sent his two arms flying. It was already a blessing that his hands weren't broken.

So, the simple action of picking up the stockings with his hands was currently beyond his capabilities.

"I can't exactly use my mouth..."

Little Li Mo shook his head, stopping this dangerous thought.

After pondering for a moment, he decided to claim his system rewards to distract himself.

Maybe he could fall asleep then?

Just like counting sheep. He didn't even know how many rewards he had in the system, so he had to sort them out one by one.

"The feedback from Low-tier Destinies, I'll skip for now."

"Gray and Black-tier Destinies don't even drop much martial arts insight anymore. Is it because my level is too far apart from the investors?"

"Blue and Green-tier Destiny feedback..."

Li Mo calculated.

Most of them were also curios, gold, silver, and jewels, or heavenly treasures that weren't considered too precious in his eyes.

But they made up for it in quantity.

It made his empty wallet full again. If he counted everything, his net worth might even surpass his previous one?

But there were too many to count.

After a moment, Li Mo's eyes finally lit up.

[Congratulations, Host. You have successfully invested in 'Huang Donglai', helping him avoid serious injury as Greenwood City fell.]

[Investment Feedback: Life-Prolonging Pill.]
