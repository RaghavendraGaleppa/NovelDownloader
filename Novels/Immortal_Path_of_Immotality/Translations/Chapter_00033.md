# Chapter 33: We Beg for Your Mercy  

It was a winter night, the third day of the Lunar New Year, when blood was spilled at the Old Madam's birthday celebration, causing her to faint on the spot.  

No one in the Zhao Manor dared to breathe too loudly, fearing they might be casually executed by the innate master who had barged in. The guests who had come for the banquet inwardly cursed their misfortune, wondering how they had gotten caught up in this mess—one wrong move and they could lose their lives.  

After all, in the martial world, it was common for entire families to be slaughtered in revenge. When the city gate caught fire, it was inevitable that the fish in the moat would suffer.  

The square was so silent you could hear a pin drop, the cold wind howling. It was hard to tell whether the trembling of the crowd was from the weather or their own fear.  

*Clang!*  

The sound of a wine pot hitting the ground startled everyone. They turned to see that it was a dancing girl beside the young master in white who, out of sheer terror, had fumbled and dropped the pot while pouring wine.  

"Take it easy."  

Lin Shan reached out to steady the girl's delicate wrist, his voice gentle and concerned.  

"Did I startle you just now?"  

Tears welled up in the girl's eyes as she shook her head frantically, suppressing her sobs. Kneeling on the ground, she looked utterly pitiful.  

Lin Shan couldn't help but doubt himself. He touched his face—was he really that terrifying? As far as he remembered, he had only been eating and drinking since arriving. It was others who had attacked him first, and he had merely defended himself.  

Shaking his head, he stood up, exasperated by the way everyone cowered like frightened quails.  

But the moment he rose, the crowd recoiled as if they had seen a ghost!  

Finally, Lin Shan had had enough. With a sweep of his sleeve toward the gate, he declared coldly:  

"Within ten breaths, all unrelated parties must leave this place!"  

A chilling grin revealed his white teeth.  

"Don't say I didn't warn you!"  

The moment the words left his mouth, the crowd bolted like wild horses, scrambling desperately for the exit.  

In an instant, the vast square was filled with the sounds of panicked footsteps, overturned tables and plates, and the wails of the dancing girls—as if a monstrous beast had been unleashed in the courtyard.  

Zhao, who had remained standing, was suddenly jostled by the fleeing crowd. He didn't even bother to see who had pushed him, his forehead slick with sweat as he kept his guard up against Lin Shan, fearing a sudden lethal strike.  

…  

Twenty breaths later, Lin Shan watched speechlessly as the last old man stumbled out of the Zhao Manor's gate.  

His attempt at a grand gesture had been thoroughly humiliated.  

Still, he didn't dwell on it. These people were uninvolved, and he had no reason to slaughter them indiscriminately. Turning his gaze to the remaining members of the Zhao family, he saw them clutching weapons, their faces filled with terror as they faced him.  

---  

"Master Zhao," Lin Shan began, "now we can have a proper discussion about the matter between us."  

Zhao surveyed his surroundings with a bitter expression. He didn't blame the fleeing guests—though they had ties of friendship, business, and even marriage, it was only natural that they wouldn't stay to die when the Zhao family was targeted by an innate master.  

Those who remained were the Zhao family's direct bloodline, their fates already bound together. It was no surprise they stayed.  

Zhao knew that at this point, fighting was futile, and escape impossible. For the sake of his family, he had no choice but to admit his wrongs and submit.  

"To my shame," he said, his voice heavy, "it was my greed that led me to order an attack on you back then.  

"This is entirely my fault! I alone bear the consequences! I beg you, spare the innocent women, children, and elders of the Zhao family—let the punishment fall only on me.  

"I am willing to die in atonement!"  

With that, he dropped to his knees and kowtowed deeply, awaiting judgment.  

The rest of the clan, though some didn't know what their patriarch had done, understood that this was their moment of reckoning. They too fell to their knees in unison.  

Lin Shan looked at the hundreds of people kneeling before him, none daring to resist, like lambs awaiting slaughter.  

For a moment, he felt a strange sense of detachment.  

A year and a half ago, he had lived in a similar great family—weak in martial arts, without powerful elders to rely on, always bowing and scraping to others.  

Now, in what felt like the blink of an eye, he held the power of life and death over such a family.  

A wave of weariness washed over him. The hundreds before him stared pleadingly, waiting for this young innate master to decide their fate tonight.  

Little did they know, this master was forming a new plan.  

"All this time, I've been alone in my search for ancient resonance, relying solely on luck and my own efforts," Lin Shan mused. "But what if I had an entire organization working for me? It would save me so much time."  

His gaze lingered on the Zhao family.  

"Killing them would be effortless, but afterward, I'd still be left to search for ancient resonance on my own. If I spare them, the Zhao family is still a powerful clan in Zangke County—their intelligence and connections could be useful to me.  

"Now is the perfect opportunity."  

Clearing his throat, he spoke again.  

"Patriarch Zhao, whether or not I kill you and your family can wait. First, let's discuss the matter of the antique golden bell you stole from me—worth three thousand taels. What do you intend to do about it?"  

---  

Lin Shan gave Zhao a meaningful look. The kneeling patriarch immediately grasped the subtext—there was a chance to live.  

Who would choose death when survival was possible?  

As an advisor to the county magistrate, Zhao was quick-witted. He began deciphering Lin Shan's hidden message while speaking humbly:  

"That golden bell rightfully belongs to you, Young Master! It should be returned immediately, along with compensation. The Zhao family is willing to pay an additional three thousand—no, five thousand—no! Eight thousand taels of gold!"  

The entire Zhao family's liquid assets amounted to barely ten thousand taels of gold, equivalent to a hundred thousand taels of silver. But for the sake of his clan's survival, Zhao was willing to spend it all.  

The elders of the Zhao family, sensing a possible reprieve, quickly chimed in:  

"Yes! Compensation is necessary! Absolutely!"  

At the mention of money, Lin Shan's blood stirred with excitement—after all, he had known poverty all too well. Still, he pressed further.  

"Hmm, not bad. But the bell has been in your possession for over a year. What about the interest?"  

Zhao's eyes lit up—there was hope!  

He nodded solemnly. "You're right! The bell is priceless, and I've enjoyed admiring it all this time. I should compensate you for the interest as well. I notice Young Master has a fondness for antiques—how about the antique shop in the western part of the city? The entire business, along with all its inventory and staff, shall be yours."  

The elders echoed: "Only fair!"  

Lin Shan nodded inwardly, impressed by Zhao's quick thinking. But outwardly, he feigned hesitation.  

"But I'm still young. I have no experience managing an antique shop..."  

"No problem! The Zhao family can manage it for you—free of charge! We volunteer!"  

The elders: "We volunteer!"  

Lin Shan frowned. "That won't do. If you manage my business without pay, people might accuse me of exploitation."  

Zhao shook his head vehemently. "Young Master, you misunderstand! Serving an innate master like you is an honor beyond our wildest dreams. For the Zhao family to be of use to you is a blessing earned over eight lifetimes!"  

The elders: "Indeed! A blessing!"  

"But I haven't done anything for the Zhao family. How can I accept such devoted service? No, no." Lin Shan's words carried a hidden meaning.  

Zhao instantly understood and seized the opportunity.  

"Young Master, you humble us! We haven't even had the chance to serve you properly—how could we dare to trouble a mighty expert like yourself? If you would permit it, the Zhao family would be honored to appoint you as our Supreme Elder Advisor. We would serve you faithfully in all matters. *We beg for your mercy!*"

The elders bowed deeply in unison:  

"*We beg for your mercy!*"
