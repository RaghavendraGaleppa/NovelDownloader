# Chapter 10: The Hunt  

Thus, Han Yue adjusted his daily routine once more.  

Every day, he would visit the central square, actively join the meat distribution team, and claim a generous portion of first-rank demon beast meat. Through this, he also became acquainted with many members of the Ninth Courtyard.  

The demon beast meat provided ample nourishment for his daily cultivation. After each meal, Han Yue would methodically refine the runes of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* while steadily accumulating magical energy.  

The *Void-Severing Slash* gradually filled to the brim with power.  

Finally, when Han Yue had refined his twenty-seventh rune, the *Void-Severing Slash* reached full capacity and began to overflow, feeding energy back into his body.  

As he continued refining *Body-Nourishing Thunder* runes, the magical energy continuously converged into the *Void-Severing Slash* talisman. After undergoing purification and transformation, it became a denser, higher-tier thunderforce.  

Once the thunderforce could no longer be contained within the talisman, it began to diffuse outward, gradually suffusing Han Yue’s body.  

At last, Han Yue had surplus magical energy beyond what the *Void-Severing Slash* could store.  

He now had the confidence and means to wield *Void-Severing Slash* as a regular technique.  

*Body-Nourishing Thunder* was an exceptionally profound foundational cultivation method, focusing solely on one principle:  

How to accumulate the most solid foundation possible during the Body-Entry Realm.  

Following *Body-Nourishing Thunder*’s cultivation rhythm, Han Yue should devote himself entirely to refining magical energy and runes at this stage.  

The twenty-seven runes he had already condensed were merely the beginning.  

As for combat techniques and self-defense methods in the Body-Entry Realm, the author of *Body-Nourishing Thunder* deemed them unworthy of a cultivator’s time.  

A cultivator should rely on artifacts and armor to survive battles in the Body-Entry Realm, striving to ascend to the second rank as swiftly as possible.  

Only a stronger foundation and faster advancement were worth pursuing in this stage.  

Considering his own circumstances, Han Yue realized that with his two divine abilities, he lacked nothing in combat prowess. His focus should remain entirely on advancing his cultivation.  

Moreover, Han Yue had already begun planning for his third divine ability.  

Initially, he had hesitated over whether to select a defensive or restorative ability to maximize his survivability.  

But under the influence of *Body-Nourishing Thunder*, his resolve had solidified.  

He would find a way to acquire a divine ability that aided his cultivation, granting him an even greater advantage in the early stages!  

However, Han Yue could barely sustain the two abilities he already possessed. There was no rush to acquire a third.  

---  

Just as Han Yue persisted in his daily cultivation, the Ninth Courtyard’s second grand meat distribution ceremony was fast approaching.  

By tradition, preparations for hunting demon beasts would begin twenty days in advance.  

Now a core member of the Ninth Courtyard, Han Yue was naturally invited to attend the preparatory meeting.  

The meeting took place in a dedicated strategy room, where a massive sand table depicted the dense forests near the Meat Distribution Outpost.  

The dozen or so attendees were all key figures of the Ninth Courtyard.  

The other meat distributor, Yang Dong—a composed and experienced elder—held a pointer and gestured at the sand table.  

"Within the territory under the Heaven-Rank’s jurisdiction, there are still over six hundred confirmed first-rank demon beasts."  

"After preliminary discussions with the courtyards ranked above us, these five beasts are not within their hunting scope."  

"I’ve compiled detailed records for each."  

Master Yang, having participated in countless hunts, was thoroughly seasoned.  

"Master Han, let me clarify—as meat distributors, we are all required to undertake hunting missions."  

"Including the courtyard master, the five of us will hunt separately. If even one succeeds, the other four may choose to abandon their tasks."  

"The successful hunter will receive sixty percent of the beast’s yield, while the remaining forty percent remains with the courtyard."  

With that, Old Yang handed Han Yue a dossier.  

At this point, Fang Yi spoke up.  

"Han Yue, don’t feel pressured. I’ll be there, and I’m certain I can complete the hunt. You can just come along and observe."  

Han Yue nodded and accepted the dossier assigned to him:  

**[Bronze Ram]**  
**Rank: First**  
**Ability: Mountain-Shattering Charge**  
**Length: Approximately 20 zhang (60 meters)**  
**Description: Bronze Rams feed on ironwood, metal, and rock. Their horns are exceptionally tough, and their copper skin and iron bones can only be pierced by second-rank primordial energy. Their attacks are simplistic—avoid their frontal charge and strike their eyes, groin, or hindquarters with weapons imbued with primordial energy.**  

The dossier included an illustration of a yellow ram with massive, twisted bronze horns, along with its habitat.  

The information was brutally straightforward, explicitly detailing the Bronze Ram’s weaknesses.  

Han Yue accepted the Bronze Ram hunting mission but also expressed his intention to accompany Fang Yi and observe the Ninth Courtyard’s hunting operations.  

No one objected. Before Han Yue’s arrival, they had long been accustomed to their own rhythm. His presence didn’t make them dependent on him, nor did it alter their approach.  

Han Yue watched as the courtyard bustled with activity. Everyone had their roles, and soon, four teams formed and set off in large wagons.  

---  

Han Yue joined Fang Yi’s team, riding atop one of the wagons.  

Dressed in a dark green martial outfit with his treasured saber strapped to his back, he looked relatively normal at a glance. But compared to his companions, he seemed more like a sightseer than a hunter.  

The rest of the team was fully armed, making Han Yue appear woefully unprepared.  

He couldn’t help but marvel at Fang Yi’s appearance.  

Clad in a massive suit of black beast-hide plate armor, her entire body was encased in protective plating.  

Jagged spikes protruded from the armor’s joints, deterring any close-quarters engagement.  

The helmet resembled the head of a ferocious beast, with sharp fangs twisting outward from the visor and two bony horns extending from the top.  

In full armor, Fang Yi stood over three meters tall, wielding a tower shield more than two meters long in one hand and a massive bone scythe in the other.  

Her mere presence exuded a savage, bloodthirsty aura that sent chills down the spine.  

The others were similarly equipped, clad in terrifying armor and bearing enormous weapons.  

The entire team brimmed with battle fervor as the wagons charged into the forest!  

Han Yue, seated among them, stood out like a sore thumb—less a hunter and more like rations carried by the hunting party.  

The wagons were drawn by four massive draft horses, descendants of demon beasts. Though they hadn’t reached the first rank and awakened bloodline energy, they were still extraordinary, boasting incredible speed and stamina.  

Before long, the convoy plunged deep into the forest, racing toward their distant quarry.
