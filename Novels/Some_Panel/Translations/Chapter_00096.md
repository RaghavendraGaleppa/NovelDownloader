# Chapter 95: Heaven-Defying Fortune, Yang Ji's Excitement

The second item was a Hundred Treasures Pouch, a top-tier storage magic treasure, second only to those self-contained world spaces. After a fierce bidding war, it was finally bought for 100,000 Heavenly Spirit Pills. Yang Ji wasn't particularly attracted to this treasure because he was currently dirt poor and didn't have much to store.

Next, dozens of treasures were auctioned. The magic treasures were all treasure-grade or higher, including flying swords, pill furnaces, battle armor, treasure fans, and so on, all fetching high prices. Materials included Heavenly Immortal Sand, Hundred Spirits Earth, and the like. Pills included the Jiazi Divine Pill, which could increase lifespan, Soul-Nourishing Pills, etc. Talismans included the Six Ding Heavenly Armor Talisman, Thousand-Mile Instant Travel Talisman, Eight Treasures Enlightenment Talisman, World-Breaker Talisman, and others. Among them, the Eight Treasures Enlightenment Talisman sold for a staggering 300,000 Heavenly Spirit Pills. Indeed, anything related to enlightenment was extraordinary. Yang Ji instantly had the idea of creating talismans, but upon closer inspection, he realized that the materials required for the Eight Treasures Enlightenment Talisman were extremely special and precious: powder from the [Enlightenment Stone]. He had no choice but to give up for now. Crafting talismans was easy, but finding the materials was difficult. After observing for a while, Yang Ji understood: the rarer, more valuable, and more useful an item, the higher the price it could command. While these items were attractive to him, they weren't essential, so he just watched the show.

Afterwards, over a dozen more items were auctioned. Each one was more expensive than the last, and every bidding voice struck Yang Ji's heart. Only now did he realize how truly poor he was.

"The next treasure, I believe everyone has been looking forward to for a long time. It is Titanium-White Essence Gold, which can be used to forge high-grade Dao Artifacts. The starting bid is ten million Heavenly Spirit Pills, with each increment being one million," the elder announced. Immediately, a Mahayana cultivator spoke up: "Eleven million." The reason Yang Ji knew he was a Mahayana cultivator wasn't because he saw information about him, but because he recognized the voice; it was Elder Chun Ye. Yang Ji's long-anticipated treasure was being bid at over ten million, a price he absolutely dared not even consider. He had initially thought that sitting in a VIP room made him a person of some standing, but he hadn't expected to be in the same VIP room as a Mahayana cultivator like Chun Ye. How could his century-long cultivation foundation compare to theirs? They were simply not on the same level. The Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance putting Yang Ji in a VIP room was truly giving him too much credit. At this moment, he was probably the poorest VIP in all the VIP rooms, a VIP with only ten million "low-grade" spirit stones on him. He didn't even have the courage to bid, while others were competing fiercely.

"Twelve million! This piece of Titanium-White Essence Gold can help me cultivate a great divine ability, the Grand Profound Adamantite Slash. There's no way I can give it up. I implore my fellow Daoists to be lenient," a deep voice came from one of the VIP rooms.

Yang Ji looked intently, and the [Mahayana Cultivator] information appeared. No wonder he possessed such wealth.

"Heh heh, this piece of Titanium-White Essence Gold is only the size of a fist. With so little, you won't be able to cultivate a divine ability anyway. But if you give it to me, combined with the mother-iron I have, I could forge a high-grade Dao Artifact. I bid thirteen million," an old man said with a laugh.

"Aren't you Old Ghost Taixu? Why aren't you staying in the Nine Origins World and instead running to my Primordial World? And you even want to snatch a treasure from my Primordial World? Impossible, absolutely impossible! I bid fourteen million," a teasing voice rang out.

"Old Man Xuanhua, I'm here for the treasure, I don't care about staying in your Primordial World. I bid fifteen million," the previous old man laughed and spoke again. Yang Ji finally understood; this auction had gathered too many powerful experts, some even from other worlds. Even such experts were traveling back and forth, which showed how truly difficult it was to find top-tier materials. He weighed the spirit stones in his hand and could only helplessly put them back. In the end, this long-awaited Titanium-White Essence Gold was bought by the Mahayana cultivator from the Nine Origins World.

Just as Yang Ji was feeling frustrated, the elder hosting the auction spoke again with a smile: "Next, we will be auctioning a crystal segment the size of a pinky finger. This crystal resembles amber, exhibiting a woody luster and immense hardness. Even a low-grade Dao Artifact cannot cut it, true fire cannot burn it, and weak water cannot soak into it."

"We speculate that this might be a fragment of a mid-grade Dao Artifact, or a type of Dao Stone similar to a Five Elements Stone."

"Although we cannot precisely identify what it is, its material properties are evident, making it a top-tier treasure. When combined with some other top-tier materials, it is sufficient to forge a mid-grade Dao Artifact."

"Due to the size of the material, the starting bid is set at one million Heavenly Spirit Pills, with each increment being one hundred thousand."

"Hmm? Cannot precisely identify what it is?" Hearing the elder's words, Yang Ji's interest was instantly piqued. He looked closely, and his spirit was immediately shaken, because it was a [Fragment of the Primordial Divine Tree].

"It's actually a fragment of the Primordial Divine Tree!" Yang Ji was stunned, couldn't help but rub his eyes hard, and looked again. It still displayed 'Fragment of the Primordial Divine Tree'. Yang Ji then excitedly pinched his thigh, unable to remain calm, and could barely suppress the roar in his heart.

"It's actually a fragment of the Primordial Divine Tree! Legend has it that the entire Primordial World was originally propped open by this very Primordial Divine Tree. In other words, this Primordial Divine Tree is the mother of the Primordial World!"

"This Primordial Divine Tree is described as incredibly miraculous in texts. Legend says it could absorb Immortal Qi from the Immortal Realm and bear fruits containing the laws of the Grand Dao."

"Those ancient beings, the first batch born from the Primordial World, ate the fruits and immediately gained the ability to live forever. In just a few hundred years, they attained the Dao and became Immortals."

"Later, a powerful figure from the Immortal Realm said that the Primordial Divine Tree violated the rules of Dao operation, so he personally came to the Primordial World, uprooted it, and took it into the Immortal Realm. What a pity!"

"This Primordial Divine Tree is a divine object from who knows how many epochs ago, tracing back to the very origin of the Primordial World. After so many epochs, the fragments left by the Primordial Divine Tree haven't decayed! It's truly amazing, worthy of being the mother tree that created a grand world."

"To encounter such a heaven-defying divine object here is truly a tremendous fortune, of immense significance. This is a fragment of the Tree of Origin!"

"After so many epochs, the cultivators of the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance wouldn't possibly associate it with the Primordial Divine Tree. Even an Immortal would probably not recognize it, because it is simply too ancient."

Yang Ji stared fixedly at the fragment, his gaze burning. Before long, more information appeared: [Nurture with True Fire to forge and cultivate a mother embryo. Nourish with the essence of ten thousand woods to provide growth energy. A subtle combination of both can make it take root and sprout again.]

[Once the Primordial Divine Tree sprouts and grows, it can absorb Heaven and Earth Spirit Qi, Dao Qi, and Immortal Qi, bearing the purest Spirit Qi Fruits, Dao Qi Fruits, Immortal Qi Fruits, and even Grand Dao Fruits.]

Fortune!

This was simply incredible fortune!

Yang Ji dared not hope for Grand Dao Fruits. After all, the Primordial Divine Tree would need to grow as large as a world to bear Grand Dao Fruits, and he was absolutely incapable of cultivating it to that extent. However, he could certainly hope for the Spirit Qi Fruits, Dao Qi Fruits, and Immortal Qi Fruits.

Spirit Qi, Dao Qi, Immortal Qi. These three types of elemental energy represent different energy levels for different cultivation stages. Before Void Refinement, one absorbs Spirit Qi; after Void Refinement, one absorbs Dao Qi; and after becoming an Immortal, one absorbs Immortal Qi.

The reason cultivation pills refined from spirit herbs are so popular is because they contain extremely pure Spirit Qi. The purer the Spirit Qi, the faster the cultivation speed; this is the simplest and clearest principle. First-turn Golden Cores, Ninth-turn Golden Cores, Nascent Soul Pills, Soul Transformation Pills – while their names differ, apart from some special medicinal effects, the greatest commonality among them is the extremely pure Spirit Qi they contain. These types of pills are not like Enlightenment Pills, which have special effects; these are purely for cultivation.

According to the information display, the Spirit Qi Fruits produced by the Primordial Divine Tree absorbing Spirit Qi are the purest, meaning they are even better than Soul Transformation Pills.

If he could constantly consume Spirit Qi Fruits, Yang Ji would no longer worry about not having cultivation resources to condense Heaven and Earth Dharma Idols! One, two, three... even a hundred would be possible!

But the immediate priority was to figure out how to acquire it. The bidding had already reached four million.

"Five million!" a cultivator said calmly with a smile.

Five million! Yang Ji's heart tightened.

It was definitely too late to borrow money from Elder Chun Ye now. Besides, what right did he have, being neither kin nor friend, to ask a Mahayana cultivator to lend him five million? Moreover, the other party was also currently bidding.

Suddenly spotting the white jade stone on the wall, he pressed it without hesitation. After a short while, Bai Bier walked in with a smile. "Daoist friend, is there anything you need?"

"I want to borrow money!" Yang Ji, having deeply calmed his emotions, suddenly said.

"Borrow money?" Bai Bier was surprised. "Daoist friend intends to borrow money from our Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance?"

"Yes, I want to buy the item currently being auctioned," Yang Ji nodded gravely.

"Heh heh, Daoist friend is truly interesting. Borrowing money from our Merchant Alliance to buy our Merchant Alliance's item. You have a good plan indeed," Bai Bier chuckled charmingly.

"I feel this item has a strong connection with me, but my funds are tight. This is truly a last resort," Yang Ji said, slightly embarrassed, but with a determined expression. "Please rest assured, Daoist friend, I will definitely repay both principal and interest in the future."

"Our Merchant Alliance's interest rates are very high, you know. If you can't repay, you might have to pay with your person," Bai Bier said, smiling as she looked him up and down.

"This..." Yang Ji suddenly hesitated. Although the opportunity was great, if he were to fall into servitude, with the Merchant Alliance's compounding interest, he might never be able to extricate himself.

"Heh heh, look how scared you are. Our Merchant Alliance doesn't need interest. Our Merchant Alliance loves to make friends, especially talented friends. Although your current worth isn't that high, your potential is worth our Merchant Alliance's investment."

"However, there's no free lunch, Daoist friend should understand this principle. When the time is right, you will need to do one thing for our Merchant Alliance."

"One thing?" Yang Ji's brow furrowed slightly.

Seeing this, Bai Bier smiled, "Of course, it won't be anything against human ethics and morals, and it will be within your scope of ability. If Daoist friend agrees, our transaction can proceed."

"Can Daoist friend make this decision?" Yang Ji suddenly asked.

"Probably," Bai Bier smiled meaningfully.

Yang Ji looked at her in surprise, pondered, and then resolutely nodded: "Good!" He could feel that this Primordial Divine Tree was too important to him; missing it would be a huge, huge loss.
