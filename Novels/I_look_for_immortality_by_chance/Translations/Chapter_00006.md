# Chapter 6: Perhaps He's Not a Bad Person, But He's Definitely Not a Good One  

"Young friend, what incredible fortune you have!"  

"To actually be accepted into Qingfeng Dao Academy!"  

Huolongzi turned around with a warm smile, his demeanor gentle toward Gu Yuan.  

"You flatter me, Elder. It was merely the grace of the exalted one!"  

Though Huolongzi was amiable, Gu Yuan remained cautious, maintaining a respectful tone.  

"Regardless, Qingfeng Dao Academy is no ordinary place. Taking this step means soaring to great heights—your path to immortality is now within reach!"  

"At the very least, you'll have a stable foundation for cultivation..."  

Huolongzi shook his head, as if recalling something, his voice tinged with emotion.  

Noticing Gu Yuan's silence, he chuckled and asked, "Young friend, do you not know what Qingfeng Dao Academy truly is?"  

"This junior is ignorant. I humbly ask for your guidance, Elder."  

Gu Yuan clasped his hands in deference.  

He truly didn’t know.  

His past self had entered the mountains to cultivate at the age of ten, with little contact with the outside world. He only knew that the Qingmu Sect resided within the Nanshan Domain, in the land of Ba.  

The Ba Kingdom spanned tens of thousands of miles, home to three major sects—Qingmu Sect, Mosha Sect, and Yanlong Sect—standing in a tripartite balance as the dominant powers.  

His past self had once believed this was the extent of the world.  

But now, it seemed he had been a frog at the bottom of a well.  

"There’s no need to speak of distant lands. Let’s focus on the Nanshan Domain, for even I may never leave its bounds in my lifetime."  

"The Nanshan Domain is vast and boundless, filled with countless spirit veins, immortal mountains, great lakes, and hidden grottoes. Its population numbers in the hundreds of millions, with cultivators, demon beasts, and star spirits beyond counting."  

"Such an expansive territory cannot be wholly claimed by humanity. Beyond the sects, Dao academies, and various dynasties, most of the land remains wild, where all creatures compete for survival."  

"Among them, minor sects are innumerable—just a few mountain peaks and a single Qi Refinement cultivator can establish a sect."  

"Larger sects, with several Foundation Establishment cultivators and orderly traditions, control thousands of miles of land, possessing spirit veins and mines, with hundreds of disciples—like your Qingmu Sect and my Yanlong Sect!"  

At this, Huolongzi couldn't help but laugh bitterly.  

Gu Yuan was equally stunned.  

What his past self had considered the "world" was merely a small, obscure sect in a remote corner.  

A territory of ten thousand miles was nothing more than the shallow waters of the cultivation world.  

"Above these are the sects with Golden Core powerhouses. A Golden Core cultivator possesses a trace of immortal gold nature, capable of passing down profound techniques. Such sects are immensely powerful, controlling vast territories spanning tens of thousands of miles and countless resources."  

"Such figures could wipe out our sects with a mere flick of their fingers!"  

Huolongzi shook his head again with a wry smile.  

"But Qingfeng Dao Academy is even more formidable. It is said to house terrifying beings at the Dao Embryo realm."  

"That’s why I say you’re incredibly fortunate!"  

"If you can become a disciple of a Golden Core master, you’ll likely also be under the wing of a Dao Embryo expert. With such backing, you could traverse the entire Nanshan Domain without fear!"  

"Even now, it’s not bad. Just being admitted to Qingfeng Dao Academy ensures a bright future, even if you don’t become a direct disciple of a Golden Core master!"  

Huolongzi stroked his beard with a smile.  

"You honor me too much, Elder!"  

"This junior is of mediocre talent. I only hope to reach Foundation Establishment like you—that would be enough for me to die without regrets!"  

Though inwardly exhilarated, Gu Yuan remained outwardly humble, setting Huolongzi as his benchmark.  

"Ha ha ha!"  

Huolongzi burst into laughter, the arrogance he had suppressed in the presence of the Golden Core master resurfacing.  

Even in a place as mighty as Qingfeng Dao Academy, could everyone reach Foundation Establishment?  

This young man before him might have luck on his side, but with his Five-Aperture physique and average aptitude, surpassing him was far from certain!  

The only reason he had shown him any courtesy was because of his connection to the Golden Core master. Otherwise, a mere fourth-level Qi Refinement cultivator could be crushed with a flip of his hand!  

But this kid did have a commendable temperament—resilient and adaptable, not letting a stroke of good fortune inflate his ego.  

With such a disposition, he might truly achieve something remarkable.  

After all, Qingfeng Dao Academy possessed countless techniques, including those that could alter one’s innate gifts.  

Moreover, the Golden Core master’s piercing gaze before departing had left him too intimidated to act rashly.  

"Fate has brought us together. Your admission to Qingfeng Dao Academy is a blessing—it calls for celebration!"  

Huolongzi chuckled as he patted a three-foot-long, vividly crafted crimson jade serpentine artifact at his waist.  

With a surge of mana, the jade serpent expanded in the wind, growing to a majestic thirty feet in length, its scales gleaming and aura imposing.  

"This is a treasure I used in my youth—the Jade Serpent Shuttle!"  

"It’s a high-grade artifact, not suited for combat but unparalleled in speed. The journey to Qingfeng Dao Academy spans tens of thousands of miles. Traveling alone, you’d face endless mountains and rivers, unsure when you’d arrive. Delaying your cultivation would be unfortunate."  

"But with this, you’ll reach Qingfeng Mountain in just three days!"  

"I also have a map here, detailing safe routes through ten kingdoms. Follow it, and you should avoid any attacks."  

"Consider these my gifts to celebrate your admission!"  

With a flick of his sleeve, a jade slip landed in Gu Yuan’s palm.  

Not only that, but a drop of Gu Yuan’s blood dripped onto the lifelike jade serpent in midair.  

"Boom!"  

A surge of strange information flooded his mind. Gu Yuan felt a thread of connection form in his consciousness, linking him to the serpent.  

With a mere thought, the jade serpent’s scales rustled as it obediently swam through the air, gently settling beneath his feet.  

"My deepest gratitude, Elder!"  

Overjoyed and relieved, Gu Yuan bowed deeply to Huolongzi.  

He didn’t hesitate to accept.  

This, too, must have been part of the Golden Core master’s plan.  

Otherwise, she wouldn’t have left so casually, allowing Huolongzi to learn everything.  

"No need for thanks. This is your destiny!"  

"I only hope that when you achieve greatness, you won’t forget me!"  

Huolongzi chuckled as he stroked his beard.  

"Your kindness will never be forgotten!"  

Gu Yuan bowed once more.  

"Now that all is settled, don’t delay. Gather your things and set off at once!"  

Huolongzi signaled to a nearby Yanlong Sect disciple, who promptly handed over a storage pouch.  

Inside were dozens of spirit stones, several sets of robes, shoes, socks, and other daily necessities.  

"My junior here is about your size. Make do with these for now. Once you reach Qingfeng Dao Academy, they’ll provide proper attire."  

Huolongzi handed the pouch to Gu Yuan with a kind smile.  

"Thank you, Elder!"  

Having already accepted the artifact, Gu Yuan saw no reason to refuse these supplies.  

Turning away, he changed into a white jade brocade robe and cloud-patterned boots, securing his hair with a green hairpin. Once again, he looked the part of a handsome young noble.  

Though Huolongzi had known Gu Yuan was fair-faced, the sight of him now—elegantly dressed, his dark hair pinned up—drew an involuntary sigh of admiration.  

"A refined gentleman, radiant and noble!"  

"With such looks alone, you’d deserve a true disciple’s position!"  

"Go forth!"  

With a final wave of his hand, Huolongzi sent him off.  

Gu Yuan bowed deeply once more before stepping onto the jade serpent and soaring into the distance.  

Watching him disappear, the burly disciple beside Huolongzi couldn’t hide his envy.  

Such heaven-defying luck, falling into the hands of a mere miner!  

But this was the Golden Core master’s decree. Though jealousy gnawed at him, he suppressed all dark thoughts. Glancing at the unconscious Qingmu Sect disciples on the ship, he whispered:  

"Uncle, what about these people? Should we spare them as a gesture of goodwill, instead of sending them to the Dragon’s Maw?"  

Huolongzi gazed at the distant horizon where the jade serpent had vanished, then turned to his usually sensible disciple with a sigh.  

"You..."  

"The spoils from the Dragon’s Maw are worth several Foundation Establishment treasures. He didn’t even ask to save them, yet you’re feeling generous!"  

The disciple frowned in confusion. "But he’s connected to a Golden Core master now, and you even gifted him the Jade Serpent Shuttle. If he had asked, would you have refused?"  

"I wouldn’t have refused, but I wouldn’t have given him the shuttle or the map either."  

"He’s a smart one. He knows the weight of his words, so he wouldn’t ask."  

"Do you think admission to Qingfeng Dao Academy grants him the right to command a Foundation Establishment elder like me?"  

"Are the lives of his former sectmates worth more than his own future?"  

"Besides... how much camaraderie could there truly be in a place like Demon Star Grotto?"  

Huolongzi sighed again. "That boy’s temperament is truly suited for cultivation."  

"Perhaps he’s not a bad person, but he’s definitely not a good one."
