# Chapter 88: The "Kind-Hearted" Person

"This is the territory of Cyller City!"

The captain's eyes were fixed on him, trying to discern something from his face.

"Cyller City? Is this Cyller City?" Zhou Tian said in surprise, as if he had encountered something incredible. "How is that possible? We only entered that village for less than one night, how could we have arrived at Cyller City? This place is nearly ten thousand *li* away from our Hammer City!"

"Captain Musu, what happened?"

A gentle voice came from the convoy. The curtain of the white carriage was pulled open, and the white-robed woman stepped out. She must have noticed that the carriage hadn't moved for a long time and came out to check the situation.

"Your Highness the Saintess, it's nothing, just a traveler seeking help." Musu first turned back to explain to the Saintess, then coldly said to Zhou Tian, "I'm sorry, I don't know where this 'Hammer City' you speak of is. We still need to go to Cyller City, so we can't help you. Please move out of the way!"

"Don't be like that, it's fine if you just take me to Cyller City. I'll figure things out myself from there." Zhou Tian was still trying to negotiate.

"Move!" Musu snorted coldly, throwing his long spear. It stopped at Zhou Tian's throat, its chilling gleam almost touching his skin. If he took another step forward, the spear would certainly pierce through him.

Before Zhou Tian could speak, a delicate shout came from the convoy behind Musu. "Captain Musu!"

The white-robed girl walked up, her face filled with indignation. "Captain Musu, how can you treat a traveler seeking help like this? Have you forgotten Bishop Mu's teachings? The Lord will not abandon anyone who seeks help!"

The girl's face was flushed, her chest rising and falling, as if Musu had done something utterly outrageous.

Zhou Tian's face was full of surprise. To think there's such a brain... no... kind-hearted girl in the God-Forsaken Land. She's truly a rare animal.

He was already prepared to give up. At worst, he could just follow this convoy from a distance until they reached their destination. He just wanted to inquire about some things, but since the other party was unwilling, he'd let it go. If he were killed, it would waste another day, and it would take a great deal of effort to find civilization again.

"Your Highness the Saintess, what if he's an evil god worshiper..." Musu explained, without the cold attitude he had shown Zhou Tian.

*An evil god worshiper? You probably don't know that your 'Lord' is already in cahoots with them*, Zhou Tian thought to himself.

The girl glanced at Zhou Tian, and light glowed in her hand. A wisp of white light streamed out from her hand, circled Zhou Tian once, and returned to her hand. "This gentleman has no trace of evil god aura on him. Can he follow us now?" The light in the girl's hand dissipated, and she spoke to Musu, her indignation still evident.

"But..." Musu's brows furrowed, his face full of difficulty. "Hammer City," "Kamaji"? These names sounded made up. Did he really think he was stupid? Not killing Zhou Tian on the spot was already a testament to his father's teachings.

"If the Lord were here, He would never abandon this gentleman!"

*If your Lord were here, he'd definitely slap me to death*, Zhou Tian thought to himself, not interrupting, silently watching this rather amusing scene.

"Sir, come with me. If he won't help you, I will." Seeing Musu hesitate to respond, the girl pulled Zhou Tian and walked towards the convoy, seemingly wanting to take him into the carriage.

"No, miss. I'm already very grateful if you just let me follow you. How could I trouble you further? Just giving me a horse to follow you would be enough." Zhou Tian quickly waved his hand. Given the girl's intelligence, Zhou Tian feared that talking to her for more than two sentences would lower his own IQ. To preserve his intellect, it was better to stay away from her.

Musu breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed his murderous gaze had worked; this kid was quite sensible.

The girl looked at Musu, her eyes wide, and said, "Look how noble this gentleman's character is! Sir Musu, why are you unwilling to help him?"

Musu pointed his long spear at the ground. His unicorn warhorse's muscles rippled menacingly, as if in telepathic connection with its master, its two bell-like eyes fixed on Zhou Tian.

"Alright, let him follow. But we don't have an extra horse. You can ride with me on mine." Musu finally agreed.

Zhou Tian said with a seemingly joyful expression, "Thank you, Your Highness the Saintess, and thank you, Captain Musu."

The girl replied with a devout expression, "Don't thank us, thank the Lord."

*The brainwashing is terrifying! No wonder this path can't be widely promoted; if it were, the Nine Provinces would surely be turned upside down.* Zhou Tian watched the girl's actions with a hint of awe. This ancient divine realm still had some tricks up its sleeve.

The girl returned to her carriage. Zhou Tian swung himself onto Musu's warhorse, sitting behind him. The unicorn warhorse's back was quite broad, spacious enough to carry both of them.

Musu's body was noticeably stiff. This was likely his first time riding a warhorse with another man, especially a stranger.

Seeing him so awkward, Zhou Tian couldn't help but pat his shoulder. "Don't be nervous. Everyone's like this the first time. You'll get used to it. I'm settled now, you can move."

Musu suppressed the urge to turn around and stab him to death with a spear. What nonsense was this fellow spouting? With a wave of his hand, the convoy set off again.

"Captain Musu, how far is it to Cyller City?" Not long after they set off, Zhou Tian opened his mouth to ask.

"We should arrive before sunset." Musu's cold voice came, and then he lowered his voice and said, "I know you're lying about everything. I don't know, nor do I want to know, your purpose. Once we reach Cyller City, we'll part ways, and we don't need any repayment from you. If anyone causes trouble for you on the road, I will absolutely hand you over without hesitation!"

Zhou Tian smiled, saying meaningfully, "Captain Musu, even if there's trouble along this road, it shouldn't be caused by me, should it?"

Musu snorted coldly, saying nothing.

Zhou Tian's eyes glinted. Despite Musu's young appearance, his mind was quite sharp, far more intelligent than that "kind-hearted" Saintess. The only flaw was that he wasn't ruthless enough, but that might be related to his upbringing. Judging by the Saintess's intelligence, the education she received from childhood must have been purely brainwashing. For Musu to grow up like this was already quite remarkable.

*If only everyone were like that "kind-hearted" Saintess.*

Time slowly passed. Zhou Tian, unlike Musu and the others who had cultivation to sustain their energy, felt the bumps of the warhorse and unknowingly dozed off, leaning on Musu's shoulder.

*Snore! Snore! Snore!*

Musu had a 'what the hell' expression on his face. Where did this kid come from? He just fell asleep like that? He truly had a big heart. However, as an upright knight, he didn't intentionally wake Zhou Tian, letting him sleep.
