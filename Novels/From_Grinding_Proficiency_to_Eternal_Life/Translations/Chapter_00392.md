# Chapter 392: The Affections of This World

The chains formed by true qi appeared thin and light, yet they concealed the "Corrosion of Origin" characteristic from the Demon Devouring Sutra. The moment Xu Tian tried to resist with a bit of his own true qi, he felt his Dantian being gnawed at by ten thousand ants.

Xu Yunfan secretly tested it several times and had no choice but to temporarily give up. The quality of his true qi was still too weak; forcing the cultivation would be difficult.

The two of them traveled through the air, the scorched earth below gradually being dyed with fresh greenery. Xu Yunfan deliberately leaked a tiny fraction of the remaining medicinal efficacy of the Ginseng Spirit. Wherever they passed, withered trees sprouted branches, and cracked stones grew moss.

Xu Tian stole a glance at the spreading vitality behind him, his Adam's apple bobbing incessantly.

Such a method was something only a true Foundation Establishment cultivator could possess, yet Xu Yunfan clearly was not one. In fact, he didn't have a shred of true essence in his entire body.

Was the martial path left by the Divine Martial True Lord truly this powerful?

At the summit of the Clear Mist Mountain in the Dao Sect, the gilded bronze pillars suddenly resonated in unison. Bi Yuan, who was seated cross-legged on the Black Jade Platform, snapped his eyes open. The Profound Sky Mirror before him reflected the figure of Xu Yunfan walking on clouds.

A hundred miles away, Xu Yunfan felt it slightly; he naturally sensed the probing of the Profound Sky Mirror from the Dao Sect. However, he didn't bother to conceal his figure and simply accelerated, landing on the summit of Clear Mist Mountain in an instant.

"Master."

Xu Yunfan landed without a sound and got straight to the point. Three jade slips slid out from his sleeve. "This is the topographical map of the Divine Martial World, the Yuan Origin Sect's *Art of Hundred Bones Penetrating the Nether*, and..."

His fingertip lightly tapped the third blood-colored jade slip. "The Hundred Mountains Demon Suppression Sutra of the Yuan Origin Sect from the Taihua Spirit Ruins World."

After thinking it over, he felt it was best to leave only the Hundred Mountains Demon Suppression Sutra. Although he didn't know why it was in the Yuan Origin Sect, merely damaging the earth's vein power to compensate for oneself was already considered quite aboveboard within the Demon Origin Sect. As long as he didn't drain the pond to catch the fish, spending some time and effort to nurture it would eventually allow it to recover.

Hearing Xu Yunfan's introduction, Bi Yuan's expression turned agitated.

Seeking immortals and visiting the Dao, pursuing the path of longevity—who wouldn't desire this?

He had false scriptures in his destiny, but now true scriptures were in hand. Even if the road ahead could not be continued due to environmental constraints, he could at least gaze upon the path from afar.

"Good! Good! Good!"

Bi Yuan said "good" three times in a row, his fingertips trembling as he caressed the several warm jade slips. A strange light shone from his turbid eyes. This Dao Sect Sect Master, who had weathered two sixty-year cycles of vicissitudes, was now like a child who had obtained a treasure, his breathing becoming rapid. The spiritual patterns flowing on the surface of the jade slips reflected on his furrowed face, revealing a long-lost vitality.

This was truly the ladder to ascension!

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan added, "Master, please allow me to report that the people of the Divine Martial World are born with blocked meridians, which is a limitation of the heavens and earth. Even in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, without miraculous items like the Meridian Opening Pill, the path of cultivation is arduous. Since our world does not have this pill now, I'm afraid we need to gather the strength of the entire Dao Sect to jointly research a solution."

"This is very reasonable."

Bi Yuan nodded slightly, his wide sleeves moving without wind, clearly due to his agitated state of mind. He raised his eyes to look in the direction of the Jade Capital, his gaze seeming to penetrate the layers of palace walls. "Now that Haomiao has controlled the Jade Capital Dao, he will soon inherit the grand统 and take control of the神器 of the state. At that time, in the name of the Son of Heaven, he will conquer the four directions, and our Dao Sect will surely lend our full support."

At this point, the old Daoist paused suddenly, his fingertips tapping the jade slips with a clear sound. He looked meaningfully at his beloved disciple. "The matter of the Meridian Opening Pill might just be able to borrow the power of the new dynasty to concentrate the strength of the world to research and manufacture it."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly, but he ultimately gave up on the idea of staying. He naturally understood the meaning in Bi Yuan's words, but it would be difficult to go further in the environment of the Divine Martial World.

Since obtaining the true scriptures from the peaks of the Yuan Origin Sect, he could naturally distinguish just how mixed and impure the spiritual qi of the heavens and earth in the Divine Martial World was.

After talking with Bi Yuan for a while and resolving the doubts in Bi Yuan's heart regarding the Land Immortal Realm, Xu Yunfan pondered slightly before speaking.

"Three months from now, this disciple will go to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World."

Bi Yuan sighed inwardly upon hearing this, but it was within his expectations. He nodded. "This is as it should be. This opportunity is rare in a thousand years. If missed, I'm afraid there will be no hope in this lifetime."

"If there is a chance, this disciple will definitely return!"

Bi Yuan said with a smile, "Then your Master will wait for that day to come."

After listening to Bi Yuan's heartfelt exhortations, Xu Yunfan agreed readily before bowing slightly.

"This disciple takes his leave."

As he turned, the hem of his robe swept over the Black Jade Platform, leaving behind three drops of pale golden essence blood. "Master, you can refine this blood. Perhaps your physique can regain some vitality."

...

Zhan Yan stroked the mottled anvil next to the furnace, his voice hoarse like the friction of rusted iron. "Are you really leaving?"

Xu Yunfan's fingertips traced the carvings on the *Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer*, and the head of the hammer immediately rippled with dark light.

"The界门 will open in three months. This disciple wants to go to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World to see the true Dao of Immortals."

The old blacksmith suddenly grabbed the tongs and struck the anvil, sparks flying on the boundary of light and shadow between master and apprentice.

"When you first entered the Forging Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave, you couldn't even swing the Thousand Jun Hammer steadily."

He stared at Xu Yunfan's arms, which were now like cast玄 steel. "Now it's good, you're even leaving this pair of hammers to the Heavenly Work Cave."

It wasn't that Xu Yunfan didn't want to take them; it was just that this pair of *Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammers* actually affected his performance. The power he could unleash with his fists and feet now already surpassed the might of an Eighth Rank Divine Weapon.

"Master..."

Xu Yunfan gently placed the *Tearing Space and Piercing Cloud Bow* on the forging table. "This bow needs to be nurtured by the Earth's Core Fire. Looking at the entire Heavenly Work Cave..."

"Knowing, knowing!"

Zhan Yan interrupted him roughly. "Alright, go, go."

Watching Zhan Yan, who had once again focused on forging, Xu Yunfan remained silent for a long while. He then knelt down and knocked three resounding kowtows, just like the day he became a disciple. Each kowtow made Zhan Yan's movements slow down a fraction.

Xu Yunfan stood up and said loudly, "If this disciple ascends to immortality in the future, I will definitely come to guide Master. Even if Master falls into the sea of Samsara, I will pull you out with my own hands."

After saying that, Xu Yunfan left without looking back.

The iron hammer in Zhan Yan's hand didn't fall for a long time; only a pair of tiger eyes were filled with tears. A long while later, he muttered a single sentence.

"Such a foolish child."

In the Melting Gold Hall of the Heavenly Work Cave, Yan Yuwei was hammering a red-hot ingot of玄 iron into a thin sheet. Just as the heavy hammer fell, the head of the hammer suddenly froze in mid-air.

Xu Yunfan was standing before the anvil at some point, his fingertip lightly touching the back of the hammer.

"Sister."

He took the *Tearing Space and Piercing Cloud Bow* from his waist and placed it on the iron anvil. "This bow needs to be quenched by the Earth's Core Fire every day. Its spirit is wild and stubborn; only Sister's pure and innocent heart can tame it."

Yan Yuwei had yet to recover her senses when she saw a stream of light fly out from Xu Yunfan's brow and merge into the hammer in her hand.

"This is..."

Dragon scale patterns suddenly appeared on the hammer handle. When swung, it actually brought forth the sound of wind and thunder.

"The true meaning of the *Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Mace*."

Xu Yunfan's figure gradually faded. "I hope Sister can enter the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining早日."

With these words, he dissipated into golden rosy clouds, leaving only the divine weapon on the anvil vibrating with a humming sound.

For the next eighty days, Xu Yunfan sat alone on the highest peak of the Divine Martial World.

With the breathing of his pores, the spiritual qi for a hundred miles converged like a hundred rivers returning to the sea.

Although he couldn't cultivate the true scriptures due to the meridian problem, the profound mystery of the Ten Extreme Martial Path, which had already broken through its limits, gradually revealed itself. A rain cloud gathering in the east was immediately pulled apart into wisps of clear mist. Before the roar of a demonic beast on the western slope had ended, its entire essence blood had already turned into blood beads suspended in Xu Yunfan's palm.

(Tomorrow, I'm going to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World!)
