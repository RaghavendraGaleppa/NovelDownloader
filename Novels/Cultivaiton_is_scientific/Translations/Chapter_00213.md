# Chapter 213: Success  

Two more days passed, and Li Shiming had refined ten batches of 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills', all of which were high-grade.  

His consciousness carefully separated the 'Essence of Medicine' within the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Furnace from the other substances. This operation was extremely taxing on his mental energy, requiring him to sift through the microscopic particles of the Essence of Medicine one by one.  

He had named this special substance 'Essence of Medicine' himself. He hadn't found any description of such a substance in existing alchemical knowledge, making it highly likely that he was the first alchemist to discover it. Naturally, he had the right to name it.  

The name 'Essence of Medicine' was for his own use only. The method he used to extract it couldn't possibly be demonstrated in front of other cultivators.  

This wasn't something he needed to worry about, though, as alchemists never refined pills in the presence of others.  

There was no fear of others learning his technique, nor did he intend to reveal his discovery of the Essence of Medicine to anyone—including Master Ma—as he had no way to explain it.  

With a solemn expression, he began refining a new batch of 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills'. Every step was executed with extreme care, fearing that a single mistake might affect the quality of the pills.  

When it was time to extract the pills, he drew the Essence of Medicine, wrapped in his consciousness above the furnace, into the Three Revolutions Heavenly Treasure Furnace and fused it with one of the forming 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills'.  

As a purple light flashed, a smile appeared on his face.  

He stored the top-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills' separately in a jade bottle, which already contained three such pills.  

Though there were only three top-grade pills, having discovered the method to refine them, he could now produce them in batches.  

Of course, the prerequisite was that he needed to refine a large quantity of a particular pill, and 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills' were one that the sect could produce in bulk.  

Li Shiming entered the cultivation chamber and placed a top-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill' in his mouth. He began practicing the 'Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique'. A surge of spiritual energy flowed from the pill, transforming into a torrent that circulated through his meridians according to the technique's pathways.  

He could feel the acceleration effect of the pill—his cultivation speed was twenty times faster than without it. No wonder cultivators were so eager for such pills.  

It was almost amusing. This top-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill', which he had refined himself, was the first pill he had ever consumed since beginning his path of cultivation.  

Coming from another world, he knew all too well the dangers of drug resistance.  

In his previous life, a newly developed medicine might only require a few milligrams to cure a specific illness. But years later, the same illness might require dozens of times the dosage to achieve the same effect—if it worked at all.  

It was this fear of resistance that had made him instinctively reluctant to consume pills for cultivation.  

Had he not refined top-grade pills himself, he might have remained hesitant indefinitely, unsure when he would finally take the plunge.  

The greatest advantage of top-grade pills was their lack of resistance. There was no risk of diminishing effects with repeated use.  

After completing one cycle of the 'Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Technique', Li Shiming confirmed the effects of the top-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill'. A single session of cultivation with it was equivalent to twenty days of normal cultivation.  

A twentyfold increase in speed made him crave more of these pills.  

Given his physique, his body could fully absorb the effects of a top-grade pill within a single day.  

Unfortunately, he couldn't produce one every day. Even with his current rate of refining five batches of 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills' daily, he could only produce one top-grade pill every two days.  

Twenty-one days after receiving a hundred portions of 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill' materials, he set off for the Pill Cauldron Peak with eight hundred high-grade pills.  

"Shiming, you're here!" Master Ma was in the middle of refining pills when he noticed Li Shiming's arrival. He turned his head and nodded with a smile.  

Li Shiming was astonished to see not one but ten pill furnaces arrayed before Master Ma—all of them spirit artifacts.  

Master Ma was refining ten batches of pills simultaneously. As an intermediate alchemist, Li Shiming understood the immense difficulty of such a feat far better than a non-alchemist would.  

To control ten furnaces at once while still being able to converse with him was beyond imagination.  

"The sect needs a batch of urgently required pills. I rarely refine such low-grade pills myself," Master Ma explained with a smile, noticing Li Shiming's surprise.  

"Master, how are you able to refine ten batches at the same time?" Li Shiming's eyes gleamed with excitement. If he could master such a technique, he could produce five top-grade pills daily.  

Not only would he be able to consume a top-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill' every day for cultivation, but he could also stockpile extras for emergencies.  

What a wondrous way to cultivate! With a twentyfold increase in speed, even a Heaven Spirit Root cultivator wouldn't be able to match his progress.  

"If you had divine sense, I would teach you this secret technique," Master Ma replied with a smile.  

Li Shiming immediately thought of the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Art', a technique that could strengthen spiritual sense into divine sense during the Foundation Establishment stage. However, his current spiritual sense was still insufficient. He estimated that he would need to reach mid-Foundation Establishment before meeting the requirements to practice it.  

"You don't happen to have a divine sense cultivation technique, do you?" Master Ma asked, noticing Li Shiming's thoughtful expression.  

"I once came across a technique called the 'Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Art', but my spiritual sense isn't strong enough to practice it yet," Li Shiming admitted without hesitation. After all, this technique was only valuable for Foundation Establishment cultivators who lacked divine sense.  

By the Golden Core stage, cultivators naturally possessed divine sense, rendering the technique far less useful.  

"No wonder Xiao Su always talks about your fortune. Even within the sect, there's only one divine sense cultivation technique, and it's a closely guarded secret of one of the elders. Obtaining it outside that lineage is extremely difficult," Master Ma said, shaking his head with a chuckle.  

Fortune was intangible, but its existence couldn't be denied.  

Despite having only a Three Spirit Root aptitude, Li Shiming's cultivation and techniques were on par with any elite disciple of a major sect. That was the power of fortune.  

"I'll speak with you after I finish refining these pills," Master Ma said, refocusing on his work.  

Li Shiming sat nearby, observing Master Ma's refining process. He wouldn't pass up such an opportunity to gather data.  

Though Master Ma might disdain these pills, they were healing pills for early Foundation Establishment cultivators—highly valuable references for Li Shiming.  

Moreover, Master Ma didn't restrict Li Shiming from using spiritual sense, allowing him to collect even more comprehensive data.  

With this data, he could refine this type of pill with a 100% success rate, and the quality wouldn't be low.  

He was no longer a novice at refining second-grade pills. His experience allowed him to avoid failures when refining pills of the same grade, and with a few more batches, he could consistently produce high-grade pills.  

As long as he refined enough second-grade pills and accumulated sufficient data, he could produce high-grade pills immediately upon receiving a new recipe.  

"Master, why is there a need for so many healing pills?" Li Shiming asked curiously. Though he didn't know the pill's name, he recognized its medicinal properties.  

"What else? The demonic cultivators have been unusually active lately. Conflicts between the righteous and demonic factions are likely to escalate. The sect needs to stockpile healing and detoxification pills. Keep this to yourself—we don't want to cause unnecessary panic," Master Ma replied casually before adding a warning.  

Li Shiming's heart tightened as he recalled the invasion of Tianhai Island by the Mingxin Sect. Though it hadn't been a bloodbath, the seven sects had been forced to abandon their ancestral homes.  

"Don't worry. As alchemists, we won't be involved in the fighting. If alchemists are needed on the battlefield, the war would already be lost," Master Ma reassured him with a smile.  

With a flick of his divine sense, Master Ma opened all ten spirit artifact furnaces simultaneously. A hundred pills flew out in a spectacular display.  

After storing the pills in jade bottles and handing them to an assistant, Master Ma put away the furnaces.  

"Shiming, my 'Split Spirit Transformation Art' would indeed be useful for you. Your spiritual sense foundation is solid—you must have cultivated it during the Qi Refining stage. Here, take this Nurturing Spirit Jade. It aided me in nurturing my divine sense. With it, your spiritual sense should improve rapidly. Once you can cultivate divine sense, I'll teach you the 'Split Spirit Transformation Art'," Master Ma said, handing Li Shiming a piece of jade.  

The Nurturing Spirit Jade wasn't a man-made artifact but a natural treasure.  

The moment Li Shiming held it, he felt a faint energy emanating from it, bringing a refreshing coolness to his soul.  

"Master, this is too precious!" Though he didn't know the exact value of the jade, any treasure that could nurture the soul was extraordinary. Its worth might even rival that of a magic treasure.  

"Once you've been an alchemist for a while, you'll realize how easily we accumulate wealth," Master Ma said with a dismissive wave.  

The Nurturing Spirit Jade was indeed valuable, but its effects were minimal for Golden Core cultivators.  

Impressed by Li Shiming's alchemical talent, Master Ma had decided to invest heavily in his growth.  

Though Li Shiming was only a nominal disciple, given Master Ma's close relationship with Elder Su, the distinction was negligible.  

"Master, I'd like to take on more 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill' refining tasks," Li Shiming said, getting to the purpose of his visit.  

"Your high-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills' have increased demand among sect members. With the current shortage, the sect can provide you with as many materials as you need," Master Ma agreed readily.  

As the overseer of alchemy, he had the authority to make such decisions. Moreover, Li Shiming's high-quality pills were highly sought after, effectively boosting the sect's strength.  

Additionally, this would free up other alchemists to focus on refining combat-ready pills, which were in massive demand—hence why a master like him had to step in.  

"Thank you, Master!" Li Shiming said gratefully.  

In the following days, wearing the Nurturing Spirit Jade, his spiritual sense grew steadily stronger—especially when combined with the 'Purple Qi from the East', which induced a remarkable transformation in his soul.  

At the start of the next month, Li Shiming visited Tianmu Peak for his monthly audience with Elder Su.  

"Junior Brother, how is your alchemy training progressing?" Senior Sister Ye Jingxian asked with a smile as they waited for their master in the pavilion.  

Having heard of Li Shiming's alchemical talent and his acceptance as Master Ma's nominal disciple, she was pleasantly surprised.  

Alchemists were highly respected, but only those with high success rates. Those still learning often struggled.  

Senior Sister Ye Jingxian wondered if Li Shiming needed help. Her family could provide plenty of materials for practice.  

"I've passed the intermediate alchemist examination," Li Shiming replied, appreciating her concern.  

"You're already an intermediate alchemist?" Xu Chuan exclaimed in disbelief.  

Li Shiming had joined the sect only recently and had studied under Master Ma for an even shorter time. Becoming an intermediate alchemist so quickly was astounding.  

"By the way, these pills should suit you, Senior Brother," Li Shiming said, handing Xu Chuan a jade bottle.  

Inside were some of the 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills' he had set aside from his sect assignments—a smaller portion than the usual third he would take for private commissions.  

"Senior Brother only uses high-grade pills. The ones you refine..." Xu Chuan trailed off as he opened the bottle and saw the pills inside.  

He took out a high-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pill' and examined it closely. The purple aura surrounding it seemed genuine.  

"Recently, the sect released a batch of exceptionally effective high-grade 'Shushan Mixed Origin Pills'—they look just like this one," he muttered, comparing it to another high-grade pill from his own stash.  

The two pills were identical in aura, confirming they came from the same source.  

"Junior Brother, from now on, I'm counting on you for my cultivation pills! Do you know how hard it is to get these? Even as a true disciple, I have to fight for them! The merit hall's true disciples are hoarding them because they're 20% more effective than regular high-grade pills. And they're yours! Now I won't have to worry about pills anymore!"  

Xu Chuan spoke rapidly, his excitement palpable.  

A 20% increase in effectiveness was enough to drive early Foundation Establishment cultivators wild. For daily-use pills, this extra boost translated directly into a competitive edge.
