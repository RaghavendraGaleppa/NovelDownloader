# Chapter 1: Coercion  

"Don't make a sound, or I'll kill you!"  

A hoarse voice sounded in his ear as Li Shiming felt a slight prickling sensation at the nape of his neck.  

He was being held at knifepoint!  

Never in his wildest dreams had he imagined that a simple stroll through the gardens behind the Nanling Prefecture's government office—his own family's private retreat—would lead to being taken hostage.  

"Don't do anything stupid. I don’t want to hurt you. I just need you to do something for me," the raspy voice continued.  

Li Shiming didn’t dare move. As the person behind him drew closer, the thick scent of blood assaulted his nostrils.  

His captor seemed pleased by his compliance, relieved that the young scholar didn’t recklessly resist. Desperation had driven him to this extreme—threatening the son of the prefect was a last resort.  

"What do you need me to do?" Li Shiming steadied his voice, forcing himself to remain calm.  

"Before you help me, Young Master Li, you’ll need to swallow this pill," the man behind him said, withdrawing the weapon.  

A bloodstained hand then extended a black pill beside Li Shiming’s face.  

Hearing his name, Li Shiming tensed. If his captor knew his identity yet still dared to threaten him, he was either a desperate outlaw or supremely confident in his control over the situation.  

Though the blade was no longer pressed against his neck, he didn’t dare resist. His body was that of a fifteen-year-old scholar, and aside from childhood calisthenics in his past life, he had no combat training.  

He took the pill from the bloody hand and, without inspecting it, tossed it into his mouth and swallowed.  

Of course, he wasn’t foolish enough to actually ingest an unknown substance. The moment the pill entered his mouth, his consciousness flickered, and it vanished into his **Server Room Space**—a dimension that had crossed over with him.  

Three days ago, after realizing he had transmigrated, he discovered that the university computer lab from his past life had somehow merged with his existence.  

Whenever he focused on the Server Room Space, his consciousness could enter it.  

At its core, the space consisted of four large IBM z15 server racks, a dedicated uninterruptible power supply, and a maintenance tool cabinet. However, with no electricity, the servers were useless.  

Still, he found that the space functioned as a storage dimension—he could store any object he touched inside it.  

Seeing Li Shiming swallow the pill, his captor exhaled in relief.  

The young master’s status made him the perfect pawn. Others might raise suspicion when purchasing certain items, but no one would question Li Shiming’s actions.  

---  

"Young Master, the pill you just swallowed is called the **Three-Day Soul-Severing Pill**. If you don’t take the antidote within three days, your body will rot to death. Don’t bother seeking a physician—even if you handed the pill’s formula to the finest doctors in Nanling, they couldn’t produce an antidote in time."  

The raspy voice spoke again, followed by the sound of a sword sliding back into its sheath.  

"May I turn around? I prefer speaking face-to-face," Li Shiming asked calmly.  

"Young Master has courage!" The man chuckled approvingly before stepping back.  

Turning, Li Shiming faced a middle-aged man missing his left arm, the stump wrapped in bloodstained bandages.  

His mind raced—his servant Mo Yan had mentioned a major incident the previous day: a white-clad swordsman had slaughtered seven heads of the Weiyuan Escort Agency at Tianxiang Pavilion, with only Chief Escort Wang escaping.  

And critically, Chief Escort Wang had lost his left arm in the fight.  

"Chief Escort Wang, care to explain what you need me to do?" Li Shiming asked steadily.  

The man showed no surprise at being recognized.  

As the prefect’s son, it was natural for Li Shiming to know of recent events—especially something as high-profile as the massacre at Tianxiang Pavilion.  

"Young Master, I bear you no ill will. If you assist me, I swear to heaven I’ll give you the antidote. The poison was a necessary evil."  

Chief Escort Wang bowed slightly, his face etched with what seemed like genuine remorse.  

Li Shiming remained unmoved. Having lived two lives, he understood human nature too well.  

Regardless of Wang’s justifications, the fact remained—he had poisoned and threatened him.  

"Here’s a prescription. Purchase the ingredients, brew the medicine, and deliver it here. You’re a smart man—you won’t tamper with it. If anything’s amiss, I’ll know immediately, and the antidote will be forfeit."  

Seeing Li Shiming’s composure, Wang abandoned persuasion and handed him an aged slip of paper, lacing his words with threat.  

The prescription listed rare herbs with specific quantities, ages, and brewing instructions.  

"Some of these ingredients will take time to procure. I’ll do my best to deliver the medicine by tonight," Li Shiming said after scanning the list.  

From what he recalled, several items were highly valuable—even with his family’s connections, acquiring them wouldn’t be easy.  

Though the Three-Day Soul-Severing Pill posed no real threat to him, he had to play along.  

"Good. I’ll wait behind the rock garden." Wang knew the ingredients were hard to obtain—otherwise, he wouldn’t have gone to such lengths.  

---  

"I hope Chief Escort Wang keeps his word." Li Shiming pocketed the prescription, fixing the man with a deep look before turning away.  

As he walked off, Wang watched his retreating figure with admiration—soon replaced by cold calculation.  

No matter what, Li Shiming couldn’t be allowed to live. He had made an enemy of the prefect’s son, and even with the antidote, if the prefect learned of this, death would be too kind a fate.
