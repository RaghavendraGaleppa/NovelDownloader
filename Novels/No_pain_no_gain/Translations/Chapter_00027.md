Chapter 27: Everyone is Happy

Han Zhen found this rule quite reasonable. After all, the spiritual energy produced by spirit veins was constant; if there were no restrictions, the place would have been overcrowded long ago.

Although cultivators were one in ten thousand, their numbers were still considerable given the overall population base of Lanzhou. Moreover, ninety-nine percent of cultivators in the cultivation world lingered in the Qi Condensation stage, making a place like Tainan Valley the most suitable.

As for the price, perhaps only a half-baked cultivator like Han Zhen would find it challenging.

“Many thanks to Fellow Daoist Han and your younger sister for the reminder. It has saved me a lot of trouble.”

Since he now knew the young girl was Han Yunzhi, Han Zhen naturally wouldn't miss the opportunity to obtain the Everlasting Spring Cultivation Technique.

So, Han Zhen changed the topic and struck while the iron was hot, saying, "I have one more request. Are there any shops in the valley that sell cultivation techniques?"

“Big Brother Han, what cultivation technique do you practice?” Han Yunzhi, still naive and inexperienced, asked a highly taboo question.

Han Yunfeng's expression changed instantly, and he quickly explained, “My apologies, my younger sister did not mean it.”

Han Yunzhi then realized she had said the wrong thing, her face turning pale, unsure what to do.

“No matter, no matter. Your younger sister meant well.”

Han Zhen waved his hand and then openly stated, "I cultivate a basic wood-attribute cultivation technique called 'Everlasting Spring Cultivation Technique'. I wonder if Brother Han and your younger sister have heard of it?"

Han Zhen, of course, knew there was a high probability that Han Yunzhi possessed a complete copy of the Everlasting Spring Cultivation Technique, which was why he feigned ignorance just now.

As Han Zhen expected, when Han Yunzhi heard him mention the cultivation technique's name, her eyes immediately lit up, and her complexion became much rosier.

She quickly said, “Big Brother Han, wait a moment!”

As she spoke, she opened the small satchel hanging on Han Yunfeng's shoulder right in front of Han Zhen. Han Zhen didn't want to pry into others' belongings, so he shifted his gaze towards the distant pavilion.

Suddenly, he faintly sensed a hidden gaze observing him. He searched carefully but found nothing, causing Han Zhen to privately put up his guard.

It was likely that some cultivators had marked him as an easy target, seeing him as an obvious newcomer.

“Big Brother Han, see if it’s this!” Han Yunzhi took two light steps closer to Han Zhen, bringing with her a delicate, feminine fragrance.

Han Zhen's expression remained calm. He took the book from Han Yunzhi's hand and flipped through the first few pages. It was completely identical to the incantations he practiced.

Han Zhen was momentarily lost in thought; the most pressing matter before him had been resolved so easily.

Han Yunzhi looked up, her eyes filled with anticipation as she watched Han Zhen.

“This is it. This cultivation technique shouldn't be missing any parts, right?” Han Zhen couldn't just freeload the rest of the content then and there. He lowered his head, a joyful expression on his face, and asked, his eyes meeting the young girl's.

“No, it’s a complete Everlasting Spring Cultivation Technique with all thirteen layers,” Han Yunzhi said with a happy expression, as if making up for her previous slip.

At this moment, Han Yunfeng lightly coughed.

The distance between the two had become somewhat ambiguous, and Han Yunzhi's face flushed crimson as she retreated a few steps.

Han Zhen's expression remained normal. This young lass would probably only suit his taste a few years from now.

“What would be the price for me to acquire this cultivation technique?”

“Two spirit stones will be fine,” Han Yunzhi said after her expression had settled down.

Han Zhen showed a difficult expression, then took out two small boxes from his pouch.

“Do you accept bartering with items?”

Seeing that Han Zhen didn't even have spirit stones, Han Yunzhi made up her mind that even if the items Han Zhen produced were worthless, she would consider it making a friend and trade the cultivation technique to him.

Han Yunfeng naturally had no interest in a transaction involving one or two spirit stones and didn't bother to step closer to see what Han Zhen might take out.

Han Yunzhi took the first box from Han Zhen's hand.

“A low-tier, mid-grade Vajra Talisman!”

She usually sold only low-tier, low-grade talismans and had rarely encountered anything of this quality.

“Too bad its spiritual essence is a bit lacking; it's only worth a third of its original value.”

After discerning the talisman's condition, she found the price reasonable.

Han Yunzhi then opened the other box and immediately recognized a Huangjing mushroom, which was well-preserved in both appearance and medicinal properties.

This was, of course, the one Deputy Sect Master Ma had offered as an apology when he visited Han Zhen back at the Seven Mysteries Sect.

Han Zhen hadn't had the chance to delve into alchemy yet, and without a storage bag to keep treasures, the Huangjing mushroom's medicinal properties would gradually dissipate over time, making it worthless.

Although Han Yunzhi recognized this spiritual herb, she had never seen a real one before and couldn't immediately determine its age.

She could only turn to her brother for help: “Brother, come and see how old this Huangjing mushroom is.”

Han Yunfeng must have encountered many spiritual herbs. He took it in his hand and immediately determined its age.

“It’s a Huangjing mushroom less than two hundred years old. If it were during the Tainan Minor Assembly, it would probably be worth over 20 spirit stones. Currently, the shops in Tainan Valley would likely only offer 15 spirit stones.”

Han Zhen was surprised that the value of a century-old spiritual herb and a millennium-old one could differ by a hundredfold. He remembered that a millennium-old Huangjing mushroom was a highlight item at auctions, easily fetching high prices over 2,000 spirit stones.

Han Yunfeng meticulously observed the Huangjing mushroom, a look of keen interest in his eyes.

Refining this particular mushroom into a spirit pill could greatly aid in breaking through Qi Condensation bottlenecks or enhancing spiritual power. Its appeal was far greater than that of the battle-damaged Vajra Talisman.

“Brother Han, I won’t take advantage of you. How about 18 spirit stones plus this cultivation technique for your Huangjing mushroom?”

Han Zhen was naturally overjoyed. Not only did it solve his immediate spirit stone crisis, but he also got a cultivation technique for free. It was a win-win situation!

“Brother Han is so generous, it would be unreasonable for your junior brother to refuse.”

And so, everyone was happy. In less than half an hour, the two who had been at loggerheads were now addressing each other as "Big Brother" and "Junior Brother."

Indeed, even in cultivation, one could not escape the complexities of human relations.

Han Zhen stated his intention to cultivate in Tainan Valley until the Tainan Minor Assembly before making further considerations.

Before the Han siblings departed, Han Yunzhi proactively told Han Zhen her name. This time, Han Yunfeng said nothing.

This was because, throughout their interaction, Han Zhen had not displayed any impolite behavior towards Han Yunzhi.

Bidding farewell to Han Yunzhi, Han Zhen arrived at the plaza.

Even outside the Tainan Minor Assembly period, most cultivators setting up stalls or leisurely strolling were young people.

Perhaps rogue cultivators who were past forty or fifty and had no hope of Foundation Establishment mostly chose to return to the mortal world to enjoy life.

Only a minority persevered on the path of cultivation without seeing hope.

Han Zhen was simply broadening his horizons. The various strange materials and magic treasures in the cultivation world left him utterly amazed.

Finally, he arrived at the management office for the pavilions. The deacon disciple responsible for handling rental procedures was dressed in flamboyant robes.

Tainan Valley and Jiayuan City were both located in Lanzhou, and the Five-Color Sect behind Jiayuan City had ties to Spirit Beast Mountain.

Han Zhen then confirmed that Tainan Valley was also within Spirit Beast Mountain's sphere of influence.

Unfortunately, it wasn't during the Immortal Ascension Grand Assembly, and the resident disciples of Tainan Valley were only in the Qi Condensation stage.

Han Zhen would have to wait another two years to determine his spiritual root aptitude.
