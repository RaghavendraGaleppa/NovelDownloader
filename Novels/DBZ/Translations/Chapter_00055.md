# Chapter 55: Disrupting Auction Order? Kick Him Out!

As time went on, item after item was successfully auctioned off, and the number of bidders remaining at the auction gradually dwindled. Many, having acquired their desired items, immediately paid with spirit stones and left. This included many consignors; upon seeing their items sold and payment received, they eagerly sought out the organizers to claim their share of the spirit stones. Once they had their portion, they too departed.

It wasn't just Wei Qian and his two companions who sensed the hidden undercurrents beneath the auction; many rogue cultivators also caught whiffs of danger and chose to discreetly leave. However, despite this, over two hundred cultivators still remained at the auction. The reason was simple: the later the items, the better the quality. Many had come specifically for certain lots scheduled later in the auction and naturally wouldn't leave without participating in the bidding.

"The next item, I believe, will be of great interest to many clan cultivators and sect disciples," Fairy Zilu said with a charming smile. This time, the maidservant brought to the high platform a dark, fist-sized stone.

An Image-Recording Stone? Cultivators with some discernment immediately recognized the stone's origin. This was a rare treasure naturally formed between heaven and earth, capable of preserving images and sounds for a certain period. By infusing it with spiritual energy, the recorded visuals and audio could be replayed.

"The item for auction this time is this Image-Recording Stone? What could be recorded within it that's worth selling at an auction?" The cultivators below discussed amongst themselves.

In a private room on the second floor, Tie Xiangguang spoke, "If I'm not mistaken, what should be auctioned now is that set of Golden Light Formation. Why has it been replaced by an Image-Recording Stone?"

"Hmm, there must be some hidden reason we don't understand," Gongyang Yan replied.

Wei Qian also stared intently at the auction platform. He had been waiting for this small formation for a long time. Seeing an Image-Recording Stone being brought out instead, he too felt quite puzzled.

With a smile, Fairy Zilu explained, "The item for auction this time is a set of high-grade Rank 1 formation—the Golden Light Formation. This is a small formation that can be deployed by a single person. Once set up, it forms a golden light barrier, enveloping the user. As for its defensive power, we specifically invited a mighty Foundation Establishment cultivator to test it. It can withstand three full-force strikes from a Foundation Establishment grand cultivator!"

This formation was naturally exceptional. Without much promotion from Fairy Zilu, it immediately attracted a large group of interested cultivators.

However, soon, a voice from the crowd of bidders below called out, "Fairy Zilu, isn't the item for auction a formation? Where are the array disk and flags? Why is it an Image-Recording Stone?"

This person's question was echoed by many cultivators. He had voiced the thoughts of everyone present.

Fairy Zilu explained, "This is exactly what I intended to clarify to everyone. From now on, no auction items will be physically displayed. Each item will be showcased using an Image-Recording Stone. Successful bidders will take the Image-Recording Stone as proof, and then the private transaction will be conducted."

In the private room on the second floor of the auction house, Wei Qian clapped his hands and laughed, "That fellow Bai Fugui, he actually came up with this method!"

Gongyang Yan also nodded, indicating that Bai Fugui indeed had many clever tricks. This way, it could effectively prevent anyone from being overcome by greed, acting impulsively, and doing something they shouldn't.

On the auction platform, Fairy Zilu picked up the Image-Recording Stone and infused it with spiritual energy. "Please observe, everyone."

Layers of light and shadow emerged from the Image-Recording Stone. In a vast, desolate wilderness, a cultivator held an array disk and inserted four array flags into the cardinal directions: east, west, south, and north. Next, he took out three low-grade spirit stones and placed them onto the array disk. Immediately, the array disk began absorbing the spiritual energy from the spirit stones. Four golden lights shot high up from the four array flags, then converged. A golden light barrier thus formed, protecting him within.

In the scene, another group of six arrived: two late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators and four mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. These six simultaneously cast various spells, launching several magical techniques, and some even took out talismans to attack. Fireballs, wind blades, water arrows, falling stones, entangling vines—a variety of spells struck the golden light barrier, causing it to continuously waver. However, even after a quarter of an hour and the scene's complete end, that group had employed various methods but failed to break through it.

Of course, in the scene, the defending cultivator also replaced the low-grade spirit stones on the array disk three times. But this minimal consumption, compared to life itself, was truly negligible. After all, one has everything only by being alive. A dead person, no matter how much they possess, has nothing.

For a moment, everyone fell silent, calculating how many spirit stones they had in their storage bags and if it was enough to win this auction item.

Fairy Zilu's voice broke the temporary silence: "High-grade Rank 1 Formation, Golden Light Formation. Starting bid is one hundred low-grade spirit stones. Each bid increment must not be less than five low-grade spirit stones."

"One hundred and ten!"

"One hundred and twenty!"

Successive bids quickly pushed the auction price of this Golden Light Formation to a high of two hundred spirit stones. At this point, rogue cultivators were largely out of the running. Only clan cultivators and sect disciples continued to bid.

"Three hundred low-grade spirit stones!"

A voice rang out, instantly causing the entire auction to halt. This sudden voice had raised the price by fifty low-grade spirit stones in one go! Even Fairy Zilu showed a surprised expression, looking towards the source of the voice. Because, that was...

Inside the private room, Gongyang Yan looked at Wei Qian, surprised, "You're bidding too?"

"Of course. No one said I wasn't allowed to bid, did they?" Wei Qian replied.

Gongyang Yan hesitated, "Well, of course not—"

Tie Xiangguang looked at Wei Qian, also somewhat surprised. He wasn't surprised that Wei Qian would bid, but rather by the depth of Wei Qian's financial resources. Three hundred spirit stones was clearly not the final price for this high-grade Rank 1 formation. But Wei Qian's boldness in raising the bid by fifty low-grade spirit stones in one go was something worth learning from.

Thus, Tie Xiangguang also didn't hesitate for a moment, stating his own price. "Three hundred and twenty low-grade spirit stones!"

Now, even more people were stunned. Because they realized that two different voices were coming from the same place. What was going on? Fighting themselves, left hand versus right hand?

In another private room on the second floor, Qiao Gongshi, the patriarch of the Qiao Immortal Clan, quickly followed with a bid: "Three hundred and thirty!"

No sooner had he spoken than another person surpassed his bid: "Three hundred and forty!"

The one who bid this time was Elder Tian from the Iron Sword Sect.

"Three hundred and ninety!" Wei Qian's second bid was another fifty low-grade spirit stone increment! This was an item he was determined to obtain, so he naturally wasn't stingy with spending spirit stones.

"Who is your esteemed self? Such a generous patron is truly rare. Might this Qiao have the honor of making your acquaintance?" Anyone with a private room on the second floor naturally held a certain status and position. So, Qiao Gongshi did not speak as impolitely as before.

Wei Qian, on the other hand, immediately turned his gaze to Gongyang Yan: "Doesn't he count as disrupting auction order? He should be kicked out, right!"
