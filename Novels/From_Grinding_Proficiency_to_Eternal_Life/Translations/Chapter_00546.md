Chapter 546: A Cultivator Needs Accessories

He felt a pure, immense, and uniquely yin-attributed primordial essence surge in like a bursting dam, flowing backward through his magic channels into his body.

This essence was incredibly heavy, containing over a hundred years of painstaking cultivation from a mid Foundation Establishment cultivator, along with Liu Yunhua's unique Yin-Yang Dao charm—the nourishment of her own Dao Foundation.

In dual cultivation arts, this was an immense benefit.

It wasn't that Xu Yunfan was seizing Liu Yunhua's foundation; rather, she had always treated others as cauldrons. Now that she was being treated as one for the first time, she naturally leaked the primordial essence she had accumulated over the years in an overwhelming flood.

The moment it surged in, it was immediately intercepted by the ceaselessly circulating Shenxiao Thunder magic power within Xu Yunfan's body and then refined.

The Shenxiao magic power was supremely yang, like a furnace, while Liu Yunhua's soft yin essence was the perfect fuel.

The refined essence caused no conflict; instead, it rapidly merged into Xu Yunfan's limbs, bones, and dantian sea.

In contrast, the blood instantly drained from Liu Yunhua's face, leaving it as pale as gold paper. Her body convulsed uncontrollably, her eyes filled with terror and despair to the extreme.

She could clearly feel the pure yin energy she had painstakingly cultivated for a century being抽走 by Xu Yunfan.

It was like a flood bursting a dike, filling her with an overwhelming sense of emptiness.

Just this one instance would require her to spend even more effort if she ever hoped to advance further in the future.

But for now, survival was the only priority.

"..."

After several more days of extraction, Xu Yunfan finally withdrew his technique and released his control over Liu Yunhua.

The current Liu Yunhua was no longer the enchanting, mid Foundation Establishment real person who looked down on her peers.

She collapsed on the cold ground, her aura withered to the extreme. Her once spirit-filled eyes were now dim and lifeless, and the magic power fluctuating from her body was faint and weak, as if a single gust of wind could blow her over. She was like a残花 ravaged by a storm, sickly and feeble, unable to even move a finger. Her life force had weakened to its limit.

Xu Yunfan glanced at the collapsed Liu Yunhua and said with a smile, "Senior Sister Liu, speaking of which, I'm still a good person. If it were anyone else, they wouldn't just try to seize your foundation; they'd find every way to drain all your primordial essence."

Liu Yunhua opened her mouth but found herself speechless.

Logically speaking, if it had been any other Foundation Establishment real person from the Primordial Origin Sect, her fate would have been several times more miserable than what she faced now.

Being bound, having restrictions placed on her, and having vicious prohibitions planted in her soul—the list was endless.

Compared to the low standards of other Primordial Origin Sect disciples, Xu Yunfan's actions could truly be considered kind-hearted.

I really am too kind after all!

Xu Yunfan stood up, feeling refreshed and spirited. The cold lightning within the cave mansion illuminated his calm face.

He glanced at the nearly exhausted Liu Yunhua on the ground, then turned his gaze to Pu Yu, who was already trembling with fear.

This person possessed a先天情欲道体 (Innate Carnal Desire Physique), a top-tier cauldron. Her physique was rare. If he were to cultivate the Heaven-Earth Interchange Yin-Yang Separation-Union True Scripture in the future, her physique would be like an accessory that significantly boosts his cultivation speed.

Liu Yunhua weakly struggled, her voice hoarse and dry, filled with a thick plea.

"Junior Brother Xu... I have already taken the blame. Could you please let me take Pu Yu away?"

She was now unable to protect herself, but Pu Yu was a crucial part of her future cultivation plans. Although her innate carnal desire physique had been broken, her potential remained. If she could be brought back to the Hundred Desires Peak and carefully nurtured, she might still be able to recover some of her usefulness in the future.

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan's face showed a hint of a smile that was not quite a smile. He glanced at Liu Yunhua, his tone calm yet不容置疑 (unquestionable).

"Senior Sister Liu, you seem to have misunderstood. The one who made you swear a Dao oath and spared your life was I, your Junior Brother. As for Pu Yu?"

He gently shook his head, his gaze sweeping over the terrified Pu Yu, and said calmly:

"What does her karma with me have to do with you, Senior Sister? Moreover, I only promised to let you, Senior Sister, go. I never promised to let her leave with you."

Liu Yunhua's eyes widened in disbelief as she stared at Xu Yunfan. Her chest heaved violently, and a sudden fit of rage overwhelmed her heart, but she couldn't even speak a complete sentence, only managing to produce choked, intermittent gasps.

She never expected Xu Yunfan to be so nitpicky and unyielding, not even letting her disciple go.

Although such actions were common in the Primordial Origin Sect, and she herself had done similar things many times...

But when it happened to her...

This... was simply agonizing, making her chest ache!

She had lost both her wife and her soldiers; she had even lost the innate Dao physique cauldron she had so carefully cultivated.

Great grief and humiliation made the world spin before her eyes, and she almost spat out a mouthful of逆血 (reversed blood).

However, feeling the meager, flickering magic power and life force within her body, and sensing the unfathomable, terrifying power beneath Xu Yunfan's calm exterior, all the indignation and unwillingness in her heart could only turn into deep powerlessness and despair.

The law of the jungle was the natural order of the Primordial Origin Sect.

Besides, Xu Yunfan hadn't dealt a fatal blow.

She took a deep look at Xu Yunfan, then quickly lowered her head. Struggling, she supported her severely injured body with great difficulty and stumbled towards the exit of the cave mansion.

Her steps were unsteady, swaying as if about to fall. Her retreating figure was unspeakably desolate and wretched.

She had lost her disciple and even the foundation of a mid Foundation Establishment real person. With these injuries, it was unknown when she might recover.

Xu Yunfan coldly watched Liu Yunhua's miserable departing figure, his expression unchanged.

He even felt he wasn't ruthless enough.

"What a pity..."

Xu Yunfan felt a slight regret.

He had thought through all the methods he knew, but there was no secret art for planting prohibitions on others.

When demonic sect disciples surrendered, they were fast, but their counterattack was even more vicious.

He was well aware that letting Liu Yunhua go would definitely lead to endless future troubles.

A woman who could climb to her current position, capable of both soft and hard approaches, would surely cause him trouble.

But under the constraints of his current strength and the sect's rules, he could only do this much.

Killing her would involve too many complications.

Not letting her go?

That was even more impossible; that would be equivalent to directly tearing all pretenses and attracting the attention of a Golden Core real monarch.

The only option was to let her limp back, alive but barely breathing. Although it was fraught with hidden dangers, it was at least within his control, and it bought him time to find a supreme treasure or secret art to resolve the traces of karma.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were profound. The next time he had the chance, it would be best to lure her out of the Primordial Origin Sect's territory and assassinate her.

As for Pu Yu...

Xu Yunfan's gaze fell on the young girl who was still trapped by the restriction on the spot, her face pale with fright, her eyes filled with endless terror.

The innate carnal desire physique was truly a natural圣体 (holy body) for dual cultivation, possessing its own unique value.

He would naturally need some acceleration accessories when practicing the Yin-Yang Separation-Union True Scripture in the future.

With a wave of his hand, he did not completely remove Pu Yu's restriction. He merely adjusted its intensity, allowing her to move slightly, but ensuring she could absolutely not escape this Shenxiao Peak cave mansion.

Pu Yu looked at him in terror, trembling like a startled fawn.

Xu Yunfan gave her a slight smile.
