# Chapter 80: Such a Prodigy

Standing before the thatched cottage, Zhang Yan was utterly bewildered.

The sect leader's martial uncle—that would make her his grand martial uncle! What concerned him most was her cultivation level. The sect leader was already at the late Golden Core stage, just a step away from the Golden Core Perfection. For someone of his stature to revere this grand martial uncle so deeply—how strong must she be? Could she be at the Nascent Soul stage? Did the Qingheng Sect actually have a Nascent Soul cultivator?

Zhang Yan found it hard to believe. A Nascent Soul cultivator could dominate the entire Zhao Kingdom. Why was the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace so formidable? Precisely because they had a dying Nascent Soul elder.

"Disciple Mo Changqing pays respects to Martial Uncle." As Mo Changqing spoke, an icy voice came from inside: "Enter."

Zhang Yan couldn't even discern the speaker's gender or age from the voice, which only deepened his curiosity about this grand martial uncle he had never met.

"Yes, Martial Uncle!" Only after hearing the voice did Mo Changqing open the door and lead Zhang Yan inside.

Upon entering, Zhang Yan was stunned. The interior was nothing like he had imagined. He had suspected the thatched cottage might employ spatial expansion techniques, but it turned out to be just an ordinary hut—small and sparsely furnished with only a simple bed, a square table, four stools, and a meditation mat. Nothing more.

But what truly shocked Zhang Yan was the person inside. Sitting on the mat was a slender figure with snow-white hair, yet their face appeared startlingly young. Most astonishingly, it was a woman. If not for knowing her identity, Zhang Yan would never have guessed she was his grand martial uncle—she looked no older than himself.

"Disciple Zhang Yan pays respects to Grand Martial Uncle." Despite his surprise at her youthful appearance, Zhang Yan obediently bowed.

After all, polite children usually had better luck.

"Zhang Yan? Only at the Qi Refining stage? Has the Qingheng Sect fallen so low that we can't even produce a Foundation Establishment disciple?" The grand martial uncle frowned slightly, clearly dissatisfied with Zhang Yan's cultivation level.

Mo Changqing coughed awkwardly. "Martial Uncle, Zhang Yan was chosen as a true disciple precisely because of his exceptional comprehension. I couldn't bear to let such talent go to waste, so I brought him to you."

"Exceptional comprehension?" Her tone remained icy with skepticism.

"Though only at the late Qi Refining stage, Zhang Yan has mastered four spells to perfection and has notable achievements in spiritual plant cultivation. His qualification as a true disciple was earned by nurturing ten second-grade and one third-grade spiritual plant for the sect."

"Late Qi Refining with four perfected spells? Capable of cultivating third-grade spiritual plants?" For the first time, a trace of surprise appeared on the grand martial uncle's perpetually expressionless face. "Not bad. He does have potential. He may stay."

"Thank you, Martial Uncle." Mo Changqing bowed with Zhang Yan.

"Explain the rules to him. Training begins tomorrow." With a dismissive wave, she sent them away.

Once outside, Mo Changqing began explaining. "The grand martial uncle is a prodigy. She's actually younger than me, yet her cultivation has reached the Half-Step Nascent Soul stage—just a hair's breadth from true Nascent Soul."

"Half-Step Nascent Soul? Younger than you?" Zhang Yan was flabbergasted. He had assumed her youthful appearance was due to her cultivation, never imagining she was genuinely young.

"Yes, but unfortunately... she will likely never advance to Nascent Soul." Mo Changqing's expression darkened with sorrow.

"Why? Grand Martial Uncle should have plenty of lifespan left. Why can't she break through?" For Zhang Yan, this wasn't just about her—it concerned the entire Qingheng Sect. A Nascent Soul expert would elevate them to the top sect in Zhao Kingdom. While the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace had their own Nascent Soul elder, theirs was aging. If the grand martial uncle could break through, Qingheng would dominate after the other elder's passing, securing vast resources for its disciples.

This was personal for Zhang Yan—he wanted to ride that coattail! He desperately needed equipment discarded by a Nascent Soul expert!

"During the last territory expansion war, to protect the sect's forces, the grand martial uncle forcibly attempted a breakthrough and damaged her foundation. Since then, she's been confined to training new disciples here." Mo Changqing's voice was heavy with regret.

"A damaged foundation? Aren't there pills or techniques to heal it?" Zhang Yan scratched his head anxiously.

"There are. Decades ago, a senior who mastered the Water Encompasses All technique could have nourished her foundation over twenty to thirty years. But he was already old—he only managed ten years before passing. Since then, no one in Qingheng has mastered that technique. We've even offered rewards, but Water Encompasses All requires Grand Completion to be effective, and outsiders we've hired fall short."

"Just Water Encompasses All could heal Grand Martial Uncle?" Zhang Yan's eyes gleamed intensely. As a water-based divine ability, he could theoretically simulate it after reaching Foundation Establishment, given his Water Manipulation was already perfected. He just needed to study the late Golden Core elder's relics.

In that instant, Zhang Yan resolved: he would save the grand martial uncle. He would become the man behind her rise to Nascent Soul! Then, as the Qingheng Sect's premier second-generation disciple, even Mo Changqing would have to show him respect!

But he couldn't act yet—his cultivation was too low. At Qi Refining, any divine ability he performed would be a weakened version. He needed Foundation Establishment first. For the first time, Zhang Yan loathed his lowly realm. He yearned to break through immediately and heal the grand martial uncle!

"From now on, your training falls under the grand martial uncle. Be prepared—she's strict with disciples." Mo Changqing gave Zhang Yan a sympathetic look before leaving.

"Strict? How strict?" Zhang Yan rubbed his head. As someone outstanding, wasn't strictness exactly what he needed to maximize his potential?

After Mo Changqing departed, Zhang Yan was handed over to the lead disciple, Wang Jinsong—the Qingheng Sect's top true disciple in both cultivation and combat prowess, their senior brother. The second was a senior sister with an alluring figure and innate seductive charm due to her physique. The third was an elderly man who had begun cultivating late in life, barely reaching Foundation Establishment in his twilight years and advancing only when nearing death each time. The remaining three were comparatively ordinary.

Assigned a hut, Zhang Yan settled in. At dawn the next day, before sunrise, noises outside roused him. Emerging, he found everyone already assembled.

"Senior Brother, what's happening?" Zhang Yan asked, puzzled by their readiness to depart.

"Junior Brother, as true disciples, we regularly clear nearby demonic beasts," Wang Jinsong explained. "It's training for combat readiness."

Though reluctant, Zhang Yan acknowledged the necessity. As a production-type talent, the sect wouldn't send him to the frontlines unless desperate—they'd likely evacuate him first. Still, this was a safe opportunity to experience the harshness of the cultivation world under protection.

"Don't worry," the senior sister reassured in a velvety voice. "The area's been cleared by the grand martial uncle—no Golden Core beasts, few Foundation Establishment ones. We have protective formations, and our identity tokens guarantee safety."

Following the group beyond the sect's barrier, Wang Jinsong advised, "In the Skyeye Mountains, never fly unless you're Golden Core—it makes you a target. Junior Brother, stay at the center. If danger arises, flee immediately. Don't wait for us."

Zhang Yan agreed readily—with six Foundation Establishment experts guarding him, he'd be foolish not to run if needed. His perfected Windriding skill and Concealing Mask ensured escape confidence.

Fortunately, they encountered only minor beasts, all Qi Refining level, which Zhang Yan handled easily under his seniors' watch. Arriving at a pond, the group halted.

"Prepare to enter the water," Wang Jinsong said, handing Zhang Yan a fishing spear. 

"Fishing?" Zhang Yan was baffled.

Without explanation, the others plunged in. Following suit, Zhang Yan was struck by the water's unnatural coldness, dispelled only by circulating qi. Soon, they were hunting translucent fish. After half an hour, the fish vanished, and the group resurfaced.

"Good haul. Try one," Wang Jinsong said, cleaning and eating a fish raw. 

Imitating him, Zhang Yan discovered the fish contained a peculiar spirituality that loosened cultivation bottlenecks. Though the effect diminished with each subsequent fish, it was remarkably potent.

"These fish appear monthly for just fifteen minutes," Wang Jinsong explained. "They can't survive outside this pond and lose potency within half an hour of death." 

Disappointed they weren't a daily resource, Zhang Yan perked up at Wang Jinsong's next words: "There's something better—the pond's spirit fish king. Catching it could remove cultivation bottlenecks all the way to Golden Core!"
