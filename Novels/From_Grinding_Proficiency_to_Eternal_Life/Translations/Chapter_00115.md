# Chapter 115: Nine Stars Sect

Apart from the sect leaders with supreme strength and the disciples in the front rows of the viewing seats, the guests from various sects attending the ceremony all covered their ears, their heads buzzing with dizziness.

The玄铁 (meteoric iron) hammer head scraped against the soft sword, surging upward in reverse. The eighteen spiral blood grooves on the hammer face churned up a visible vortex.

The Cold Pool Dragon Chant Sword let out a mournful cry. Three inches of the blade were forcibly torn away, transforming into silver stars that钉入 (nailed into) the ten-zhang-distant dragon-engraved pillar.

Qi Huan stumbled back seven steps. A spiderweb-like depression appeared on the chest guard mirror.

He looked at his empty right hand. His throat rolled as he finally swallowed down the mouthful of rebellious blood, suppressing the full, unwilling rage.

"I lost."

Skin Refining perfection, Golden Skin state.

Xu Yunfan was no longer inferior to the prodigies of those top sects.

Qi Huan limped off the stage. The final heavy hammer strike from Xu Yunfan had jolted his entire body's bones and sinews into numbness. If Xu Yunfan hadn't held back at the end, Qi Huan would undoubtedly have been reduced to a puddle of flesh and mud.

Suddenly, three jade chimes rang out from the high platform.

When Zhan Yan landed in front of Xu Yunfan, stepping on air, the green bricks beneath his feet didn't have a single crack.

"Good boy, you've really given your master face."

Xu Yunfan grinned. "Master gave me a good weapon!"

If not for the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand, and if Qi Huan had drawn his Youlong Qingshen Sword, things might have been quite troublesome.

Zhan Yan turned to look at the arena, waiting for the next challenger.

Xu Yunfan's gaze also swept over the chief disciples of various departments.

Mo Shisan's gaze drifted, holding his head high as he looked at the sky, seemingly studying why today's blue sky was so clear. Usually, the hundreds of furnaces in the Tiangong Cave, both large and small, were all lit, and the steam rising from the dozen or so iron-smelting furnaces created a thick cloud that hung over Guniu Mountain all year round.

Yan Yuwei did her best to shrink her burly, extraordinary muscles, her beautiful and delicate face straining to squeeze out a harmless, innocent smile.

The chief disciple of the External Affairs Hall wore a white robe. Ever since seeing Xu Yunfan display the Golden Skin state, he had turned his body aside, holding his sword, and looked at the walls of Tiangong City in the distance, as if pondering how to劈开 (split) it with a single sword more efficiently.

Even Qi Huan, who had stepped onto the stage, was easily flipped over by Xu Yunfan with his heavy hammer.

The Nine Stars Sect envoy's eyes flickered. He stared intently at Xu Yunfan and couldn't help but let out a low sigh.

"Tiangong Cave has quite the fortune, digging up such a fine seedling. If only he were a disciple of my Nine Stars Sect. What a pity..."

He couldn't help but瞥了眼 (glance at) Zhan Yan beside Xu Yunfan, feeling somewhat hesitant. There were only a few master forging masters in Cangzhou capable of crafting Treasure Tools. If he truly offended one, it would be difficult to resolve things smoothly later on. At the very least, every couple of years, the Nine Stars Sect could still purchase Treasure Tools from Tiangong Cave at a favorable price.

The youth beside him saw the conflicted expression on his master's face and let out a soft snort.

"Master, you've taken a liking to him, haven't you?"

The Nine Stars Sect长老 (Elder) couldn't help but sigh with emotion. "In the sixteen prefectures of Yanbei Dao, there are countless Three-Refinement Martial Warriors. But those who can perfect any one of the refinements are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns. Take Qi Huan of the Hidden Blade Pavilion in Tiangong Cave, for example. Although his talent is not bad, he ultimately couldn't perfect any one refinement, merely adding to the wasted years."

"This person's hammer technique is superb, controlling its weight as he wishes. His martial arts comprehension is truly rare."

The youth raised his eyebrows, his crossed arms dropping.

"Master, you think highly of him?"

"He is indeed excellent," the Nine Stars Sect Elder said with a sigh. "If he doesn't perish midway, within twenty years, Tiangong Cave will surely add another Marrow Cleansing Master."

The entire Disciple Proclamation Ceremony fell silent for a moment. Seeing everyone remain silent, the amusement in Zhan Yan's eyes grew even fuller. This disciple truly gave him immense face. At the very least, the old fellow from the Hidden Blade Pavilion looked extremely unsightly. Finally, he spoke out in a clear, loud voice.

"Since no one else is coming up, the ultimate victor of the Disciple Proclamation Ceremony is—Xu Yunfan!"

Before his words had fully faded, a sudden clang of metal rang out from the viewing stand in the northwest corner. Immediately after, a slightly lazy youth's voice echoed throughout the field.

"Nine Stars Sect true disciple, Teng Lingchuan, wishes to seek guidance!"

The Nine Stars Sect Elder hadn't been paying attention. Hearing the voice from behind, his expression changed slightly. He then fiercely glared at the youth, Teng Lingchuan, while closing his eyes to rest, adopting an air of being half-asleep.

As soon as Teng Lingchuan spoke, the atmosphere in the entire training arena instantly froze.

Everyone's gaze turned towards the viewing stand in the northwest corner. They saw a youth in a brocade robe slowly standing up. His face was handsome, and his eyes revealed a hint of laziness, as if he had no interest in anything.

The youth held a long spear. The shaft was engraved with complex patterns, faintly exuding an extraordinary aura.

This youth, Teng Lingchuan, actually used the butt of his spear to shatter the bluestone railing. Using the recoil, he swooped into the arena like an osprey.

"Zheng!"

The moment the twelve-foot-long steel-tipped spear pierced into the green bricks, fueled by his vital energy, the twenty-eight constellation patterns engraved on the shaft lit up one after another with a faint glow.

"The Pivot Dipper Spear?"

The Tiangong Cave sword-forging长老 (Elder) suddenly clenched and broke his own beard, glancing at the rather unsightly expression on Zhan Yan beside him.

"I remember this Pivot Dipper Spear was forged by you three years ago?!"

Zhan Yan remained silent, but his fingers nearly crushed the true disciple token he was about to hand out, making cracking sounds.

Xu Yunfan looked at the youth before him, who was at most 1.8 meters tall, and a smile appeared on his face.

The Nine Stars Sect was the first among the sixteen prefectures of Yanbei Dao. Logically speaking, they should simply observe the ceremony properly. Jumping out like this was somewhat impolite.

Muscle Refining perfection.

Interesting. Master said that martial warriors who have perfected any one of the Three Refinements are extremely rare, like phoenix feathers and unicorn horns in the jianghu. Yet, as soon as the Disciple Proclamation Ceremony opens, someone jumps out.

The vital energy that was about to settle down surged like water splashed on oil, instantly churning and boiling. The scorching aura spread out in an instant.

"Please."

No sooner had Xu Yunfan's words fallen than Teng Lingchuan's spear tip抖出 (shook out) three inches of cold light. His Big Dipper Pivot steps shattered the green bricks. With a flick of his long spear, a move called "Coiled Dragon Emerging from the Sea" shot towards Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan's heel pressed down hard. The bluestone ground immediately sank half a foot. The coiling muscles of his legs stretched his trousers to the point of bursting. Dark red blood lines shot up his neck straight to the top of his head.

"Here it comes!"

Instead of retreating, he advanced. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in his hand rose with a roar. The muscles on his right arm bulged and swelled. As he swung it in reverse, the very air was torn apart with a thunderous boom.

The stone slabs under his feet cracked like a spiderweb, making crackling sounds.

The gust of energy generated by Teng Lingchuan's spear thrust easily tore apart the green stone slabs along its path.

The moment spear and hammer collided.

Xu Yunfan's arm muscles twisted like steel cables. The unique bronze hue of the perfected Red Copper Body suddenly emitted threads of gold. Under the force of the Zenith Zenith Strength, his bones vibrated rapidly like chimes. The shockwave erupted along the hammer handle.

"Dang!"

The clang of metal shook the tea cups on the viewing stand to pieces.

Teng Lingchuan's expression finally changed.

What immense strength!

This hammer strike bent the spear shaft into a crescent moon shape.

He immediately retracted his hand, sliding to the end of the spear shaft to brace it. In an instant, the spear tip's starlight暴涨 (暴涨 - surged) seven inches. It was the killing move of the Nine Stars Spear technique: "荧惑吞月" (Mars Devouring the Moon).
