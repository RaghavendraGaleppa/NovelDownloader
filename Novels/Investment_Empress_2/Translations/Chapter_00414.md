# Chapter 414: The Battle of the Profound, An Escape

“Great Yu is about to make its move.”

Tan Zhuyin looked at the thunderous light resembling divine punishment in the distance, then turned to the two Dharma Kings and the crowd of Demon Summoning Sect disciples.

“This Crystal Palace is difficult to destroy, and our Ancestral God might be inside,” a Dharma King said in a deep voice.

“If that is the case, we stand a chance to fight back,” Tan Zhuyin nodded.

The Ancestral God was supreme and paramount, even more mysterious and unfathomable than the legendary immortals who ascended to the Heavenly Realm. Such great disrespect shown here would undoubtedly anger the Ancestral God of Yunmeng.

“However, the Ancestral God has been slumbering for a long time. I wonder how much divine power can be manifested if a miracle is called down...” Luo Yexian expressed his concern.

“We will assist from the sidelines. If we can leave Jiang Yu here... that would be even better!” Tan Zhuyin’s eyes were dark and sharp.

No sooner had he spoken than the gates of the Crystal Palace amidst the thunderous light slowly creaked open. A grand and ethereal voice echoed from within:

“Who dares to disturb my slumber?”

The old man controlling the thunder, whose every movement caused the heavens and earth to lose their color, frowned slightly with suspicion. When he passed through the underground palace, he learned of this place's connection to the former Demon Summoning Sect. Could the existence within be...

“Slumbering for countless years, only to be disturbed by you. Then, you shall stay here and fall eternally into the abyss of dreams...”

With a faint sigh, beautiful butterflies transformed into a magnificent, dreamlike river, surging from the Crystal Palace and rapidly filling the vast underground palace. In an instant, the boundary between reality and dream seemed to blur. Everyone’s eyes began to show confusion and dullness; Luo Yexian even started drooling from the corner of his mouth.

“Hmph, playing the ghost and god!”

*Rumble—*

The thunder of divine punishment descended in rolling waves. The divine thunder swept across the sky, and some of the dream butterflies were instantly burned to ashes, creating cracks in the dream like a shattered mirror.

“Just the Path of Dreams? Let’s see how many strikes of divine punishment your dream can withstand!”

The world suddenly lost its color. Finally, a figure shrouded in shadows appeared within the river of dream butterflies. The shadow stood there, surrounded by several powerful auras.

“The Dream God... is the Ancestral God of Yunmeng. He has truly awakened...”

The legacy of the Path of Dreams in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands had vanished for an unknown length of time. The world said the Dream God was dead. Now that the power to control dreams has reappeared, who else could it be but the Ancestral God of Yunmeng?

“Welcome the return of the Ancestral God!”

Every single disciple of the Demon Summoning Sect began to worship fervently. Among them were no lack of vicious and wicked characters, but the more extreme such people were, the more fanatically they clung to their beliefs.

*Rumble—*

Dream butterflies and divine punishment intertwined. The indestructible divine thunder was actually distorted by the dream, almost making one think it was weak and fragile. But its power was real. Unless the one controlling the divine thunder believed himself that his power had been lost, as long as his heart remained unshaken, the false remained false.

However, that ethereal voice also reached the ears of the demonic sect members:

“Do you wish to advance further?”

“Yes!”

“Your chance to perform has arrived.”

“For the Ancestral God!”

The demonic sect members of the Demon Summoning Sect, as if injected with chicken blood, charged forward fearlessly. The aura of the two Dharma Kings, at the sixth stage of the Dharmakaya Realm, was fully unleashed. At this realm, all mysteries return to the self, no longer bound by the heavens. Thus, even as the cave-heavens of two Profound Mastery experts clashed, they still maintained their combat effectiveness.

“Protect His Highness!”

“Who kicked me?”

“Damn it! They kick down my door and arrest my sect’s people every day. Today, my Iron Leg Floating on Water finally comes in handy!”

The remaining Demon Summoning Sect disciples clashed with the Patrol Sky Guards.

“Jiang Yu, accept your death!”

Tan Zhuyin faced the Great Yu Crown Prince.

“Do you wish to die again?”

Jiang Yu struck out ferociously. His Divine Will was exceptionally dazzling even amidst the numerous Outer and Inner Sceneries. With just one punch, Tan Zhuyin, amidst his evil clouds, treated him as a great enemy. Various powerful Inner and Outer Sceneries wreaked havoc within the underground palace, creating a scene of utter chaos.

The Yunmeng Palace had already weathered the ages, and its roots came from half of the Heavenly Phoenix Domain. Now that the incomplete Heavenly Phoenix Domain had been taken away by the Ice Cube, the Yunmeng Palace instantly became a rootless duckweed. Under the impact of various powerful forces, it began to wobble and tremble.

During the battle, Jiang Yu was originally planning to suppress and kill Tan Zhuyin step by step when his dual pupils suddenly narrowed. Not far away, a figure was sneaking out from the crack of the Crystal Palace doors, trying to slip away in the chaos.

Is it him? That Li Mo, ranked fourth on the Hidden Dragon List?

However, his cultivation was too low. A wisp of the light of life and death leaked out from his chest, identical to the divine light from the Crystal Palace earlier!

“Go!”

Li Mo was greatly alarmed and immediately began to flee, his form flickering as he escaped toward the exit of the underground palace.

Jiang Yu instantly stopped his attack, golden dragons swirling around him as he surged forward in pursuit.

He fled! He chased!

“Hmm?”

Tan Zhuyin, originally on the verge of being suppressed, did not expect Jiang Yu to suddenly stop. Then, he also saw Li Mo!

“Holy Son, did he steal the Ancestral God’s divine artifact and run?” Zhu Renji, the cross-eyed one, asked cleverly.

“Chase!”

The Holy Son of the Demon Summoning Sect followed closely, leading a group of Demon Summoning Sect disciples in pursuit.

Only the sounds of the battle between the two Profound Mastery experts remained in the field. However, the two Dharma Kings of the Demon Summoning Sect felt something was increasingly wrong. Why was the pressure on them growing? To put it simply, the Ancestral God of Yunmeng was becoming more and more slippery, his attacks all thunder and little rain...

...

“Phew, this dream shadow of mine can’t fool them for long. Hurry, go.”

“Okay, my external incarnation will be caught up to in a while.”

Li Mo and Qin Yuzhi exchanged a glance, simultaneously thinking in their hearts: *You小子 (little kid) / Big Sister, you acted very well.*

Well, actually, this plan was proposed by Student Li Mo. The light was the effect of the Shen Ling Shen Zhu (Spiritual Mirage Divine Pearl) simulating the Heavenly Phoenix Domain.

The Divine Pearl probably wouldn't be coming back for a while...

His heart was bleeding, but Li Mo couldn't worry about that now. “Let’s get out of here quickly.”

Qin Yuzhi nodded, sweeping her sleeve to conjure hundreds of dream butterflies, completely hiding their forms within a团 (mass) of illusions. Silently and invisibly, they floated outward like a fleeting shadow. Dream bubbles carried them through the interweaving terrifying auras.

“Won’t we be discovered?” Li Mo found it miraculous.

Qin Yuzhi replied proudly, “Rest assured, those who cultivate the Path of Dreams are very good at staying alive and are skilled at tactical retreats. They have all been hypnotized by me.”

Li Mo: “...Indeed.”

She was actually quite proud of it. Who knew that practicing martial arts to a high level could yield such means?

“We should be able to escape without issue.”

“But...”

Li Mo looked at the Ice Cube. He still couldn't see the Ice Cube’s destiny. He felt a vague worry in his heart, but he still closed his eyes and seriously controlled his external incarnation.

...

PS: How will Student Li Mo solve the problem with the Ice Cube? Hehe.
Please give me some support, the little failure secretly tells the audience elders.
