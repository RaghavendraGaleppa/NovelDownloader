Chapter 91: A Chance Encounter with a Beauty

Lin Xuan focused his gaze on the corpse beside him. After absorbing the yin soul, the Hundred Souls Banner's phantom blood-colored skeleton increased in power, and the corpse showed signs of struggling, attempting to flee.

Lin Xuan snorted, pointing his hand, and the still-burning Primordial Fire flew towards the corpse, engulfing it. The corpse let out a pained cry as Lin Xuan waved his left hand, and the blood-colored skeleton launched a more intense attack.

In no time, the century-old corpse was obliterated, its soul dispersed.

As the black fog dissipated, a jet-black pearl remained suspended in the air.

Lin Xuan pondered for a moment before retrieving a jade bottle from his bosom. He opened the bottle, and a yellow light emerged, capturing the pearl.

Just as demonic beasts have their demonic cores, powerful corpses like this one would form a corpse pearl within their bodies. The corpse pearl was a highly toxic substance that practitioners of the Ghost Dao could use to refine spiritual artifacts. Although Lin Xuan wasn't skilled in this area, the corpse pearl was still a valuable treasure, so he stored it in his jade bottle.

Having eliminated the guardian of the spiritual herb, Lin Xuan didn't linger, harvesting the Silver Moon Flower and the Firefly Grass before departing via his swift flight.

Meanwhile, at a certain location within the Xi Yue Ravine, an unassuming cliff was emitting an astonishing amount of spiritual energy. Several fire-robed cultivators from the Fire Spirit Gate stood there, their expressions grave.

"Why hasn't the Sect Master returned yet?" one of them asked.

"Rest assured, with the Sect Master's cultivation, unless they encounter a Nascent Soul expert, who could escape their grasp? We don't need to worry," another replied.

"But the treasure is about to emerge, and without the Sect Master to oversee..."

The leading elder pondered, "We'll set up an array formation around the area to prevent the spiritual energy from dissipating. We'll instruct the Spirit Foundation disciples to stand guard, ensuring that no one sneaks in and ruins the occasion."

The orders were carried out, and the elite disciples of the Fire Spirit Gate dispersed, transforming into swift flights.

After harvesting the spiritual herbs, Lin Xuan felt elated, swiftly flying towards the exit of the Xi Yue Ravine. The teleportation array was one-way, meaning that while entering required teleportation, exiting was unobstructed.

Although there were likely Fire Spirit Gate disciples guarding the exit, their primary concern was preventing outsiders from entering. Lin Xuan planned to catch them off guard by bursting out from within, creating chaos, and making his escape.

As he pondered this plan, Lin Xuan deemed it feasible and put it into action.

About half an hour into his flight, the surrounding spiritual energy suddenly fluctuated violently without warning. Lin Xuan was startled, halting his swift flight. A blue light was approaching from a distance, and he saw that it was a cultivator.

Lin Xuan's eyes widened as he recognized the approaching figure. With a flick of his wrist, his flying sword was released...

The flying sword clashed with the approaching cultivator's spiritual artifact, causing Lin Xuan's chest to surge with blood. The two cultivators passed each other by.

In that instant, Lin Xuan got a clear look at his opponent. She was an exquisite beauty, around seventeen or eighteen years old, with ice-like skin and cherry lips.

Lin Xuan's eyes widened as he recognized her – she was a fellow disciple, the Cloud Mid-Air Fairy, Qin Yan. What was she doing here?

Lin Xuan's expression turned worried. He hadn't used the Heavenly Demon Disguise Technique, so his true appearance was visible to Qin Yan. Moreover, Qin Yan's frantic state indicated that she was fleeing from a great danger. Lin Xuan was concerned that he might be dragged into it.

While other men might be eager to protect a beauty, Lin Xuan was more cautious, knowing his limitations. Protecting a beauty was one thing, but risking his life for it was another.

Qin Yan was an exceptionally talented disciple, the closed-door disciple of the Sect Master, Yun He. Lin Xuan didn't dare assume that his cultivation was superior to hers, especially with the aid of elixirs.

From Qin Yan's swift flight and panicked expression, it was clear that she was fleeing for her life. The person chasing her must be a formidable cultivator.

Lin Xuan had learned from the memories of the Fire Spirit Gate disciples that a precious treasure was about to emerge within the Xi Yue Ravine, and the Fire Spirit Gate was taking extreme measures to secure it.

Lin Xuan knew that attempting to snatch the treasure from the Fire Spirit Gate would be suicidal. He decided to focus on refining the Extreme Grade Wash Marrow Elixir and achieving Spirit Foundation.

As Lin Xuan sighed in frustration, Qin Yan was also feeling vexed. She had just used her Sect Master's transmitted Palm Thunder technique to eliminate a shameless Spirit Foundation cultivator, only to be entangled by another person wearing a Daoist robe.

Upon seeing that the person was Qing Ling, the Sect Master of the Fire Spirit Gate, Qin Yan's face turned pale. Although the Sect Master wasn't the most powerful cultivator in the Fire Spirit Gate, their cultivation had reached the late Spirit Foundation stage, making them a formidable opponent for Qin Yan.
