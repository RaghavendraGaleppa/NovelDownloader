# Chapter 242: Full Exposure [Two Chapters Combined]

“Am I seeing things? In that armored cart, there seems to be the head of a third-realm demon!” someone remarked with a serious expression.

Soon after, a young man from Kunling local became red-eyed, recognizing the identity of that old demon. “His name is Moxi, with white hair and green eyes. He is an extremely vicious old demon. Ten years ago, my grandfather died by his hand.”

The golden ram-pulled cart sparked heated discussion. Among the severed heads were even descendants of the Silver Family from the plateau, whose ancestors once produced Heavenly Demons, though the family had since fallen into decline.

Whose team achieved such results? Many were astonished; the haul was immense.

Jin Xiang remained composed, quietly "delivering the goods." As people conversed, it unexpectedly turned around and left again, setting off once more, as it hadn't finished its deliveries!

Even if loot was lost, having a memory crystal would suffice to prove success in demon-slaying. However, the authorities desired this kind of direct, visible impact. A large pile of demon heads displayed there created an immediate, powerful, and deterrent impact.

“Hiss, a disciple from the Outer Lands actually killed a fourth-realm great demon. Such a battle record is truly horrifying. Is he trying to defy the heavens?”

This time, people from various paths showed extraordinary performance, with some individuals' battle achievements eliciting gasps of astonishment.

“Come to think of it, this is normal. Some chosen ones from the Outer Lands and Esoteric Sect are rumored to have achieved enlightenment at three or four years old. Having cultivated until now, their realms should be exceptionally high.”

As teams returned one after another, this area became lively, filled with discussions about those brilliant battle records. People were greatly enlightened, as many "famous demons" from the plateau had been slain by young cultivators.

“Oh my, the Flying Rat was killed! That fellow was shadowless and traceless, capable of stealthily hiding in dark clouds. He once infiltrated Kunling City, committing several bloody crimes and successfully escaping. But this time, he was finally brought to justice!”

Soon, people learned that this was the Esoteric Sect's Divine Seed, Tang Yutian’s, spoils of war.

“As expected of Sun Taichu’s personal disciple! Someone saw from afar that Cui Chonghe’s demon kills were incredibly valuable, enough to exchange for at least two portions of Auspicious Beast Blood!”

Many were filled with envy, truly incomparable. Such individuals had good family backgrounds, their masters were titans of the Immortal Path, and they themselves were astounding among their peers—true winners in life.

Then, many people in the distance gasped, seeing Su Shiyun from the Outer Immortal Lands retrieve a small mountain of spoils from her storage ring.

“Such an immortal fairy, with fair skin, a beautiful face, and long legs, and so capable! If I could marry her, my descendants wouldn’t have to strive anymore.”

“Wake up, don’t bring your dreams into reality.”

“What’s wrong? Can you even deprive me of my right to dream?”

Amidst the clamor and exclamations, Jin Xiang returned, pulling yet another armored cart full of spoils. Instantly, the eyes of those nearby changed. Was it "stocking up"? Whose severed heads filled cart after cart?

This was utterly outrageous! How many demons had been killed? Whose work was this? Everyone refused to believe this belonged to a single team, because there were too many heads, and most importantly, many heads of "famous demons" had already been identified.

“Jin Xiang, are you serving three or four strong teams at once?”

The golden ram smiled faintly, striding leisurely, with great poise, relaxed and composed.

“Old Jin, hurry up and answer!” someone shouted.

“One!” Jin Xiang replied concisely, unwilling to elaborate. It found it troublesome; if it actually said it was one person, it would probably be swarmed and unable to leave.

Even so, everyone took a sharp intake of breath. One team could kill so many?!

“Looking at these heads, and the identities of those famous demons, this team should be in the second realm. Are they that fierce? I feel this is enough to exchange for three or four portions of Auspicious Beast Grand Medicine, right?”

According to the rules, when slaying demons, if the opponent is below one's own realm, it doesn't count. Only kills of opponents at the same or higher realm are counted.

“Hiss, there’s even the head of a quasi-demon seed inside! I've seen his portrait, a heaven-blessed genius. To be precise, he was already considered a true demon seed; he just wasn't chosen due to bad luck back then!”

“His status and position are equivalent to Li Qingxu of the Immortal Path!”

“Shush!” someone quickly stopped him. Many people looked askance; this person was incredibly bold, did he not want to live?

The speaker immediately regretted his words. If the main figure were here, or if someone from Cao Qianqiu’s lineage heard him, he wouldn't have a good day, and might even die on the spot. Fortunately, those individuals were not nearby.

All teams had returned and began to quickly and efficiently tally their spoils. Indeed, the atmosphere here surged again; everyone was eagerly anticipating the various rewards.

“Qiu Long, killed twelve demons of the same realm, extraordinary performance. Reward: one copy of the top-grade Heavenly Light Energy Secret Manual.”

“Lu Xu, killed demons…”

People continuously exclaimed in admiration. Soon, the battle records of the Near-Immortal Seeds were tallied, and with the announcement of rewards, it caused a huge stir.

Sun Jingxiao, a disciple of the Outer Pure Land, could obtain 1.8 portions of Auspicious Beast Blood based on his actual battle record. This person immediately delivered a "king bomb," overshadowing the rewards of those before him.

Fortunately, not all Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds achieved such high results.

“Li Bai, reward: one portion of Auspicious Beast Blood!”

Li Qingxu himself did not appear, sending someone to collect on his behalf. However, the reward distributor knew who the main person was and didn't even thoroughly inspect the memory crystal. At this moment, Li Qingxu was walking in this place under a different identity, feeling very relaxed, his mind exceptionally peaceful. Otherwise, he carried too much burden.

He had regained his confidence. Even after a series of defeats, he didn't wallow in self-pity. He wanted to walk the path of "breaking and then establishing oneself," not sighing over a wasted life.

“There will come a time to break out of the cocoon and become a butterfly. In the future, I will forge a new path!” he encouraged himself.

The Li family’s representative stationed here was extremely old and of very high status, with a complicated expression. He truly wanted to say: "Child, is it possible that your master’s talk of breaking and then establishing oneself was a way of mocking failures?" Because Cao Qianqiu had been strong throughout, never suffering defeat in his youth, how could he have researched the "breaking and establishing" method?

“Li Qingyue, three portions of Auspicious Beast Blood!”

Instantly, the place erupted. She was the most dazzling individual among those who appeared, obtaining the most rewards. Immediately, people saw this Near-Immortal Seed from the Pure Land. Although her white clothes were stained with blood, it added a unique kind of beauty to her, breathtaking, giving a sense of transcendence, like a banished immortal undergoing trials in the mortal world.

“This is my dream immortal fairy! Seriously, I swear, I’d be willing to lose a thousand years of my life, even if I could only marry her for a single day!”

“This is too heaven-defying! She alone obtained three portions of Auspicious Beast Blood. She’s peerless in grace and exceptionally skilled, and daring enough to fight desperately. If only my family tree had this immortal fairy on it!”

“Fairy Qingyue, if your great ambition is to seek truth and become an immortal, I am willing to follow by your side for the rest of my life and fight for you!” someone directly shouted.

“Brother, be realistic. This method won't get you close to her, because the teams willing to follow her are lined up from here all the way to Kunling City.”

Anyone could see that Li Qingyue had truly fought fiercely in this great battle, otherwise, she wouldn't be covered in blood, possessing a "battle-worn" aura. Soon, people learned that besides slaying demons, Li Qingyue also discovered a hidden demon king's stronghold and reported it immediately. During that time, she was pursued and nearly died.

“Wu Yaozu, 2.3 portions of Auspicious Beast Blood!”

Upon hearing this, Little Wu was first happy, then calmed down, because someone—a woman, no less—had achieved more than him. He was dissatisfied with his own performance. However, others hadn't heard of him, which immediately caused a stir.

“Who is this blondie?!” someone asked. Wu Yaozu had short, golden-yellow hair, and his facial features were sharp and rugged. He wasn't handsome but was full of heroic spirit, making him unforgettable.

“He's a disciple of the Mountain River Academy. The old geezers in Kunling are happy now. Look over there, those old monsters' wrinkled faces have smoothed out, smiling like old sunflowers.”

Soon, Little Wu became even more displeased, because Brother Ming’s rival, the Immortal Seed from the opposing family, had a higher battle record than him.

“Cui Chonghe, reward: three portions of Auspicious Beast Blood!”

People had to sigh. This young man, having achieved fame early and renowned far and wide as a disciple of the Immortal Path, truly lived up to his reputation and was now experiencing his moment of glory. His aura was ethereal, peaceful, and transcendent. His brilliant achievements were entirely earned through combat. It was said that he had consecutively slain more than one great demon of a higher realm than himself.

“Truly worthy of being someone from our Cui family destined to reach the apex of the Immortal Dao!”

At the Cui family's side, several elders continuously nodded, all wearing satisfied smiles. From childhood until now, Cui Chonghe's performance had been impeccable; he had never been defeated by anyone, and he possessed strong ambition, aiming to surpass his masters and ancestors!

Yu Gensheng patted Little Wu's shoulder, saying, “It’s fine. Dazzling battle records don’t necessarily represent the highest true potential, because some people are in the mid-to-late stages of a higher realm. You, on the other hand, are in the early stage of the second realm, so you naturally suffer a disadvantage when hunting demons of the same realm.”

Though that was true, high rewards could still indicate something. Many sighed, truly worthy of being Sun Taichu’s personal disciple, Cui Chonghe. His great name had been heard for a long time, and now his glory was finally witnessed.

Subsequently, the emotions in this area surged again, becoming a clamor. This was because the "great god" of a certain lineage within the Esoteric Sect displayed brilliance no less than Cui Chonghe, slaughtering through a certain area of the demon race, with an astonishing number of beheadings.

Today, people witnessed the extraordinary feats of one Immortal Seed and Divine Seed after another, realizing the huge gap between themselves and them. There were actually several individuals who obtained three portions of Auspicious Beast Blood!

“Oh my, old ram, it’s finally your turn! Are these truly all demons you slew?”

People saw Jin Xiang step forward to the area for second-realm cultivators to exchange battle records for Auspicious Beast Blood. Those nearby were stunned.

The golden ram gave a wry smile. It was collecting the reward on behalf of someone, and it was at the request of two elderly seniors from the Mountain River Academy. It was doing this under duress.

“How is that possible? Are you joking? Let the real person come forward!” Those responsible for tallying records and distributing rewards exclaimed in disbelief. They were dumbfounded. Was this one person’s achievement? One must know that even someone as strong and famous as Cui Chonghe only exchanged for three portions of Auspicious Beast Blood.

Who was this Shen Wubing? Unknown and unheralded. Could he surpass the most outstanding Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds? Their first thought was that this person had cheated.

“This is a bit much. Even if you're faking it, be more realistic! To dare to surpass those few, isn’t that openly telling everyone you’re up to something?”

“Are you despising us, intentionally challenging our bottom line? Hunting alone, yet able to exchange for four portions of Auspicious Beast Blood!”

Those responsible for the tally found it unrealistic. There shouldn't be such a youth, and according to the information, the person in question was actually from the Newborn Path. This was even more outrageous!

Instantly, those nearby roughly understood that these were not the spoils of several teams, but the severed heads of demons hunted solely by one individual.

“Joking! This matter is too fantastical. Who has the guts to spread such huge news at this critical juncture?”

“Is he crazy?妄图通过某种手段，获取最高战绩，也不看一看场合，那些祖师还没走有走呢。” "Trying to achieve the highest battle record through some means, without even considering the occasion, the grandmasters haven't even left yet."

Everyone felt it was unreliable. Because, based on common sense, three portions of Auspicious Blood was the limit. In fact, with the most brilliant peerless prodigies setting the example, who would dare to cross the line, who could surpass them?

“Do you have any questions? This is a memory crystal, the true battle records can be verified!” Yu Gensheng stepped forward. He was personally vouching for the main person.

In an instant, many people were taken aback, as an old senior was stirred out, and he actually endorsed such a battle record.

“I also believe him. Check the memory crystal,” Zhao Ziyuan also stepped out and walked over.

Jin Xiang let out a long breath. He had truly been in a predicament just now, unable to advance or retreat. He knew these were genuine battle records, but others wouldn't believe him, and their words were almost drowning him.

“This… how is this possible?!”

The people responsible for tallying the records did indeed verify it, feeling incredulous and sweating on their foreheads. Was there really such an amazing youth? Most importantly, this youth was neither an Immortal Seed nor a Divine Seed. It didn’t make sense; he had been unknown in the past.

“Senior, he’s from the Newborn Path…” someone hesitated to say.

“What’s wrong with the Newborn Path?!” Yu Gensheng flared up in anger.

“Who are you looking down on?!” Zhao Ziyuan also grimaced. Their sparse dozens of hairs all fluttered as if in a windless state.

“Who are these two old men?” someone unfamiliar whispered.

“They are the leaders of the Mountain River Academy’s Newborn Path. Don’t let their old age and near-baldness deceive you; their strength is terrifying. See their strands of hair? To put it in perspective, one hair from them is worth ten years of your and my arduous cultivation.”

“One, two… hiss!”

Tang Jin, Ling Yu, Xin Youdao, Jiang Ruoli, and other acquaintances vaguely guessed whose battle records these were. Even with a premonition, they were still shocked. Especially Tang Jin, she felt it was like a dream. This genius from Black and White Mountain, whom she had overlooked, had actually surpassed many disciples from other glorious paths today?

Although this was not a direct reflection of potential, as hunting demons was related to various factors, being able to exchange for the most Auspicious Blood still explained a lot.

Yu Gensheng was extremely displeased. “Verify the memory crystal and see if there are any problems. Don't make things difficult for my disciple from the Newborn Path. True or false, it’s clear at a glance, don't waste time!” Originally, he wanted to quickly exchange the rewards and let the matter pass, but some people insisted on causing trouble, drawing everyone’s attention.

“This seems… to be genuine battle record.” The people responsible for the tally here felt a sense of panic; they found no issues. However, they still refused to believe. Could there be such a terrifying youth on the Newborn Path? If they mistakenly distributed the rewards, and accountability was demanded from above, they would be in deep trouble.

“Seniors, please wait!” Someone, not daring to make the decision, ran off to report and invite higher-ups to make the final call.

“You have prejudices against the Newborn Path!” Zhao Ziyuan sighed. Originally, he didn't want the matter to blow up and preferred to keep a low profile, but it couldn't be contained. In truth, they had long had a premonition that Qin Ming’s overly outstanding performance might cause trouble and attract the attention of higher-ups.

Several middle-aged men and women arrived, very polite to Zhao Ziyuan and Yu Gensheng, recognizing these two elderly senior figures.

“This… please have the main person come out to meet us,” someone said. Because after verifying, they also had a headache. It was unbelievable; had someone from the Newborn Path truly come from behind to take the lead? That was four portions of Auspicious Beast Blood—it was too extreme!

“Shen Wubing, come here.” Qin Ming walked forward expressionlessly.

“It really is him!” Liu Hanya, Xin Youdao, Tang Jin, and others stared ahead.

“This… a prominent figure of the Newborn Path?!”

“If this is proven true, he will be the true Outer Saint of the current second realm!”

Many people were in an uproar, discussing amongst themselves. Everyone now knew that a young man from the Newborn Path had achieved the highest battle record, obtaining the most Auspicious Beast Blood.

“It’s him, Qin Ming!” someone from the Cui family said coldly. Some people, though they hadn't gone to hunt the "discarded piece," had been fully informed during the process and knew his current identity: a disciple of the Mountain River Academy. Now, some people’s eyes turned red. This youth had caused multiple groups, including some seed-level teams and even some elder experts, to suffer terrible fates and be annihilated.

“This is interesting. The Cui family’s discarded piece appears here, haha…” The Li family members smiled. They had intercepted intelligence, and some knew his identity.

“What Shen Wubing? He is Qin Ming! His background is not simple!” someone shouted. This undoubtedly publicly revealed his true identity. Many people didn't know him but had heard the discussions of those nearby. As for his acquaintances, they were all deeply shocked. The person who obtained the most Auspicious Beast Blood was actually the old friend they knew?

“He’s Qin Ming? The one whose skull I shattered.” Li Qingxu received the greatest shock. At this moment, even though he had achieved the realization of "breaking and then establishing oneself," his Dao heart was unstable, and his emotions fluctuated violently.

“See that? That’s my brother!” Ning Siqi pulled a few geniuses beside him, saying excitedly.

Wang Caiwei was stunned. A newborn… could also reach the apex.

Cui Chonghe’s eyes were deep as he looked at the figure in front, remaining silent.

“This brother, he’s a bit scary. Could it be that our sect’s old ancestor has been reborn? It’s only been a few months since we last met, and he’s improving his realm at a running pace—no, he’s practically flying!” Xiang Yiwu muttered to himself. He also obtained Auspicious Beast Blood, but naturally, there was a gap between his amount and four portions.

“Seniors, we also need to report this to our superiors.” Several middle-aged individuals, while believing the authenticity of the memory crystal, found it difficult to accept that the young man before them could overwhelm other prodigies and obtain the most Auspicious Beast Blood.

“What is all this commotion?!”

A great red sun appeared. Cao Qianqiu’s eldest disciple, Pu Heng, manifested his Pure Yang Spirit Light and descended upon the scene, coldly scanning everyone.

Instantly, Qin Ming’s heart sank. This old fellow was actually not dead! When changes occurred in the Kunling area, the grandmasters had disappeared, and a wisp of Pu Heng’s consciousness light had escaped, only to quickly burn to ashes. Clearly, his main body had not perished!

“Does this even need verification? It's clear at a glance that he's faking it! A mere Outer Manifestation-level cultivator from the Newborn Path, yet daring to be so presumptuous, trying to fool whom?!”

Pu Heng’s character was seventy percent like his master’s, extremely domineering. He immediately made a judgment. Moreover, his eyes were unkind, and his Pure Yang Spirit Light surged, indicating he was about to act immediately.

“Pu Heng, don’t go too far!” Zhao Ziyuan shouted. Instantly, he blocked Qin Ming.

“Oh, you two old geezers, you’re actually still alive,” Pu Heng said coldly.

Yu Gensheng retorted, “Go to hell, you old bastard! Since you’re not dead, how could I, your grandpa, have passed away? Don’t rely on your master’s prestige to put on airs here!”

In this area, everyone was as silent as cicadas in winter, suddenly quiet. No one had expected that a young man's battle record would draw out such powerful figures, and that a conflict was about to erupt.

Pu Heng’s expression was cold. “You two old things don’t have many years left to live. Do you still dare to fight? If you wish to accelerate your decay, I don’t mind helping you!”

Yu Gensheng immediately rolled up his sleeves and said, “Bring it on!”

“Heh heh…” Pu Heng laughed, his voice icy, making everyone present feel as if they had fallen into an ice cellar, their hair standing on end. He exuded an unbearable pressure. He extended a finger, actually intending to point it at Qin Ming. He knew these two old men cared greatly for the youth in front, so he wanted to strike at this heaven-blessed genius first, to cause them immense pain.

Zhao Ziyuan and Yu Gensheng naturally wouldn’t allow him to扼杀 the hope of the Newborn Path.

Suddenly, a golden ray of light flew in, striking directly at Pu Heng’s crown.

“Hmm, a mere feathered beast dares to cause trouble?!” Pu Heng said coldly, his great red sun boiling, emitting several crimson immortal lights outwards.

This was a golden exotic bird, which firmly withstood his Pure Yang Spirit Light and then flapped a wing at him, causing a thunderous sound to erupt here.

Zhao Ziyuan and Yu Gensheng were surprised, because they had previously sensed this golden exotic bird lurking in the clouds above, seemingly always following Qin Ming, having been protecting him all along.

“Dare to harass me? I'll slay you!” Pu Heng said.

“Who do you intend to slay?” On the plateau, a figure, shrinking the ground into inches, instantly teleported, extending a hand to grab Pu Heng, who was within the great red sun.

“It’s you again!” Pu Heng’s eyes turned sharp. He expanded his great sun with all his might. However, the large hand reached in, shattered his arm, and with a bang, grabbed his head, squeezing forcefully. One could clearly see his head cracking open.
