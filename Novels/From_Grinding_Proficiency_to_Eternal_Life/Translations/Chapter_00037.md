# Chapter 37: Food Supplementation

It took Xu Yunfan half a day to dig a five-meter-deep tunnel beneath the main house of the Qinghe Courtyard, expanding it into a medium-sized space. After securing it with some timber, he had initially excavated a secret chamber.

Xu Yunfan then concealed the chest of silver money and, under the cover of night, transported it to the tunnel within the Qinghe Residence to be stored.

Once everything was done, Xu Yunfan felt a slight weight lift from his heart as he sat down in the secret chamber.

It had been nearly two months since he transmigrated here, and he finally had a foothold, a place of his own.

He couldn't help but marvel for a moment at the irony that he couldn't afford a house in his previous life, yet he had easily accomplished it in this one.

Once the weapons were forged, he would have to inquire about which powerful sects existed in Qingzhou. As for joining the imperial court, Xu Yunfan had no such intentions.

He was a criminal by nature. Even if he changed his name, someone with a keen mind could quickly uncover his past. In the Great Zhou Dynasty, one's background was extremely important for becoming an official.

Naturally, that was not an option for him.

Today was a rare occasion where Xu Yunfan did not cultivate. Instead, he went to the Changfeng Tavern, booked a private room, and ordered a table full of game.

Particularly, a dish of meat brought to the table by the waiter, which exuded a strange and captivating aroma, truly caught his attention, making his mouth water.

The waiter, seeing this, smiled and said, "Sir, this must be your first time seeing this. This is the meat of the Blue Cloud Deer, a strange beast from the Jiyun Mountain Range. It feeds on grass and dew, absorbing the essence of plants and trees. The meat is tender and delicate. When prepared carefully with ginseng, astragalus, and other blood-enriching herbs for a gentle stew, it can strengthen one's blood and Qi, and solidify one's foundation."

After the dishes were all served, the waiter added, "Please enjoy at your own pace, sir."

A single plate of this meat, no bigger than a palm, cost Xu Yunfan nearly fifty taels of silver.

After picking up a piece and eating it, Xu Yunfan felt a lingering fragrance in his mouth.

What surprised him most was that shortly after eating the meat, a warm sensation spread from his stomach, slowly flowing into his limbs and bones.

*You have consumed a piece of strange beast meat. Your Physique has increased imperceptibly.*

Looking at the system prompt that appeared in his vision, Xu Yunfan's eyes lit up slightly. This was the first time the attribute panel had indicated an increase in his Physique.

However, the warm current in his body came and went quickly; a single slice of Blue Cloud Deer meat was simply too little.

Perhaps he could think of a way to go to Jiyun Mountain to find some strange beasts to whet his appetite.

After finishing the plate of Blue Cloud Deer meat, Xu Yunfan felt his body grow warm, and several more system prompts about a slight increase in his Physique appeared.

If he ate these strange beast meats every day, he could drastically shorten the time it took to cultivate the *Copper Body of the Red Chain and Cloak Hammer* technique to its perfection and obtain the Golden Skin state.

The amount of Proficiency required to advance from Great Mastery to Perfection had multiplied several times over. It only took one thousand points to go from Minor Achievement to Great Mastery, but it required five thousand Proficiency points to reach Perfection, which encompassed the total Proficiency needed for the entire martial art.

After the meal, Xu Yunfan looked at the bill of nearly one hundred and twenty taels of silver. With a calm expression, he paid and returned directly to the Qinghe Residence. After a short rest, he began to practice his hammer technique.

By the fifth day, Xu Yunfan suddenly snapped back to awareness, realizing something was amiss.

In just five days, the cost of his two daily meals had exceeded one thousand taels of silver.

This was no small sum. For an average family of four, if spent frugally, this amount of silver could support a comfortable life for half a lifetime.

"The cost of food is just too high!" Xu Yunfan muttered to himself, his brow furrowed into a deep "three."

However, when his gaze fell upon the attribute panel, the接连 popping up prompts for rising Proficiency gradually eased his tense expression.

*You have diligently practiced the Copper Body of the Red Chain and Cloak Hammer, noticing techniques you had previously overlooked and guiding the flow of blood and Qi within your body. Your Proficiency in the Copper Body of the Red Chain and Cloak Hammer has increased.*

*You have trained in the Copper Body of the Red Chain and Cloak Hammer day and night. Under the constant tempering, your control over your strength has become sharper, and your blood and Qi have become more active under the technique's circulation. Your Proficiency in the Copper Body of the Red Chain and Cloak Hammer has increased.*

Looking at these prompts, Xu Yunfan pondered internally. Although the cost was high, the efficiency was at least double what it had been before.

In just five days, his Proficiency had increased by nearly eighty points.

Ever since his Skin Refining for the *Copper Body of the Red Chain and Cloak Hammer* reached Great Mastery, the daily increase in Proficiency had grown smaller and smaller, the rate of growth becoming increasingly slow. To gain nearly eighty points of Proficiency in five days was astonishing.

"Fortunately, I have this attribute panel. If it were someone else, they might practice their entire life and still struggle to reach Skin Refining Perfection, let alone achieve the Golden Skin state," Xu Yunfan muttered to himself, a hint of relief on his face.

Even so, at his current pace, it would still take more than half a year to reach Perfection.

"More than half a year!" Xu Yunfan couldn't help but let out a long sigh, filled with helplessness. "My cultivation speed is still too slow. Could it be that my talent is truly as bad as Old Daoist Bi Sheng said?"

He then remembered that Li Haomiao had once said that many geniuses and prodigies spent their entire lives unable to reach the state of Perfection, wasting half their lives in vain.

"Hmm, half a year? That's not so bad."

The worry on Xu Yunfan's face faded.

But soon, he fell into a new烦恼 (trouble/worry). His spending speed seemed a bit too fast. He had spent one thousand taels of silver in five days. At this rate, the thirty thousand taels of silver he had on hand wouldn't last long.

"It seems I'll have to pull another job when I get the chance. Otherwise, I won't be able to sustain these cultivation expenses."

Such high daily costs for food supplementation might not be the best path for cultivation. Seeking out pills and precious herbs was the mainstream approach.

Xu Yunfan calculated internally.

For now, he still needed to fill his stomach.

Xu Yunfan straightened his clothes and strode toward the door, preparing to head to the Changfeng Tavern again.

He had just taken a step when, before he could get close to the courtyard gate, a slightly urgent knocking sound suddenly rang out, seeming particularly out of place in the otherwise quiet Qinghe Lane.

A hint of疑惑 (doubt) welled up in Xu Yunfan's heart. He quickened his pace and reached out to open the courtyard gate.

In an instant, a glint of cold light flashed before his eyes. A long sword, carrying a piercing aura, came cleaving down towards his head. At the same time, a voice filled with hatred shouted, "Give me back my brother's house!"

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted sharply, a cold light flashing in his eyes. Without time to think, his right leg shot up like lightning, arriving before the sword.

Before the long sword could fall, he landed a perfect kick squarely on the attacker's chest.

With a muffled groan, the girl's body flew backward like a kite with a broken string, tumbling a full five or six meters before stopping in a disheveled heap.

Immediately after, a mouthful of blood sprayed from the girl's mouth, splashing a shocking patch of crimson onto the ground.

Only then did Xu Yunfan get a clear look at his attacker—a girl who was no more than fourteen or fifteen years old.

Her small face was flushed red with anger, and her eyes were fixed on Xu Yunfan, burning with a different kind of rage, as if she wanted to devour him alive.
