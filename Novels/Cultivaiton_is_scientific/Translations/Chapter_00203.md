# Chapter 203: Cave Abode

The most crucial part of the apprenticeship ceremony was paying respects to the ancestral tablets of past generations. After Li Shiming performed the grand ritual before the tablets and then bowed deeply to Elder Su, the core ceremony concluded.

Next came the congratulations from the various uncles and aunts of the sect. Elder Su collected one storage pouch after another. Li Shiming had no idea what gifts they contained, but considering they came from Golden Core elders, they certainly wouldn't be trivial.

The final segment involved evaluating the cultivation progress of senior brothers and sisters. One by one, they demonstrated their achievements in the hall, receiving either praise or criticism.

Xu Chuan explained to Li Shiming that this was a traditional part of the ceremony. The reason for bringing Golden Core disciples was precisely for this purpose. Those who performed well would receive gifts from the Golden Core elders—a significant boon for any Golden Core disciple.

Through this, Li Shiming witnessed the strength of these disciples. Every cultivator accepted as a disciple by a Golden Core elder was a prodigious talent. The ceremony gave him a clear understanding of his own standing. Without the aid of IBMz15, he would lag far behind these top-tier geniuses in many aspects.

After all the guests had departed, only Elder Su and his disciples remained in the hall.

"Shiming, I've arranged a cave abode for you. This is your identity jade token, which also serves as the control talisman for the abode. Let's go see it now!" Elder Su handed over the prepared token with a smile.

"Thank you, Master!" Li Shiming accepted the token. He had been staying in his master's guest cave temporarily and couldn't remain there indefinitely.

Elder Su led Li Shiming out of Tianmu Peak, with Senior Sister Ye Jingxian and the other three senior brothers following behind.

The Shu Mountain Sect occupied the Shu Mountain Range, which consisted of nearly a thousand peaks of varying sizes. The group hovered before a modest peak, which Li Shiming studied carefully. The mountain was lush with spiritual flora—over a hundred acres of spirit fields from its base to its summit, along with more than a dozen spirit fruit trees bearing unripe fruits. A cliff face featured a miniature waterfall cascading into a deep, spirit-rich pool below.

"This is Chijian Peak, a subsidiary of Tianmu Peak. I've been managing it temporarily, but now it belongs to you," Elder Su declared, gesturing toward the mountain.

"Master, are you saying this entire peak is my cave abode?" Li Shiming asked in disbelief.

"It's just a peak. The spiritual vein here branches from Tianmu Peak. Once you reach Golden Core, you can claim a small section of the mountain range as your private domain," Elder Su replied dismissively, as if Li Shiming's astonishment was unwarranted.

Xu Chuan, watching Li Shiming's stunned expression, chuckled and took out a jade talisman to record the moment. He remembered how he had been similarly teased by his seniors when he first received his cave abode and was eager to pass on the tradition.

"The protective formation of Chijian Peak is somewhat basic, but since it's within the sect and close to Tianmu Peak, no one would dare breach it forcefully. As an advanced formation master, you can strengthen the defenses yourself," Elder Su explained as they landed atop the peak.

"Chijian Peak has 100 acres of low-grade spirit fields, 20 acres of mid-grade, and one acre of high-grade, along with fifteen second-grade spirit fruit trees. These are now your assets—capital for your cultivation. You can commission sect spirit farmers or assign attendants to manage them," Elder Su continued.

Li Shiming inhaled sharply. While the low-grade fields were manageable, the mid-grade ones produced second-grade spirit herbs for early Foundation Establishment cultivators, and the high-grade field could grow top-tier second-grade herbs. The low-grade fields alone could yield tens of thousands of spirit stones annually, the mid-grade would support his current cultivation needs, and the high-grade would accumulate resources for his future advancement.

"This is your cave abode," Elder Su said, his enthusiasm evident. When he had accepted Xu Chuan as a disciple, this task had fallen to Ye Jingxian. Today, Li Shiming had brought him great face, and seeing the envy of his peers had put him in high spirits.

The cave abode was carved into a massive rock at the summit. Upon entering, Li Shiming was struck by the spaciousness—a clear sign of spatial expansion. The main hall alone spanned 500 square meters, enlarged tenfold by formation techniques.

"You'll need space for guests. I had Formation Master Hu expand it for you," Elder Su explained warmly, his care for Li Shiming evident.

"Master, my cave doesn't have spatial formations. It's tiny in comparison," Xu Chuan interjected softly.

"Focus on your cultivation! Your junior brother has been diligently training nonstop since he arrived," Elder Su retorted sharply, silencing Xu Chuan.

"Furnish the cave as you see fit. These are gifts from your uncles and aunts—store them in the cave's treasury. You're no longer a rogue cultivator; you must learn management, starting with this peak. It's an essential skill," Elder Su concluded.

Li Shiming now understood why Golden Core disciples were granted entire peaks. Each disciple represented the sect's future, and the sect needed not just powerful fighters but also capable administrators. Managing a peak was the first step in cultivating such talents.

With his instructions complete, Elder Su vanished in a flash.

"Junior Brother, this is my gift," Senior Sister Ye said, presenting a jade box.

"Thank you, Senior Sister!" Li Shiming opened the box to find a second-grade spirit tea plant—a valuable gift, as fine tea was essential for hosting fellow cultivators.

The second and third senior brothers each gifted second-grade spirit flowers, though the similarity of their presents drew mockery from Senior Sister Ye. Li Shiming graciously accepted, appreciating their thoughtfulness.

Xu Chuan then unveiled his gift: a massive jade basin housing spirit fish. The basin's sheer size and intricate engravings marked it as a rare treasure. When Li Shiming hesitated, Xu Chuan insisted, "This is my congratulatory gift—no refusals allowed!"

Grateful, Li Shiming planted a lotus he had been preserving in the basin.

"Junior Brother, did you rob a Golden Core elder's cave for this second-grade Golden Lotus?" Senior Sister Ye exclaimed upon recognizing the plant.

Golden Lotuses were revered in both Buddhist and Daoist traditions, prized for their ability to purify spiritual energy. A second-grade specimen like this would have taken two millennia to cultivate.

"You're no rogue cultivator now. The Shu Mountain Sect fears no one in the Northern Shu Continent. If anyone dares covet your treasures, I'll smash their skulls!" Senior Sister Ye declared, easing Li Shiming's concerns.

"Junior Brother, you should also consider attendants. As a non-core disciple, you're allowed three," Xu Chuan reminded him.

Attendants, Li Shiming learned, were essentially servants—non-sect members who could reside within the sect, cultivating with resources he provided in exchange for service. Managing the peak's spirit fields and orchards would require at least one skilled spirit farmer.

When Li Shiming expressed uncertainty about finding suitable candidates, the senior brothers and sister offered to provide attendants from their own families—a privilege many cultivators would vie for, given the opportunity to serve a Golden Core elder's disciple.

"Thank you, Senior Sister, Senior Brothers!" Li Shiming agreed, recognizing the value of trustworthy help. His true secrets would remain protected by formations, while the attendants handled the peak's mundane affairs.
