# Chapter 47: The Hidden Dragon Remains in the Abyss

Perhaps he was a startled bird, or perhaps overly anxious, but regardless, Lu Yang was now wary of all forces with Foundation Establishment realm backing, especially those capable of noticing him.

‘Unlike before, this life I have the protection of a divine talisman. Heaven Mending Peak can’t scheme against me, and the Divine Martial Sect, being a righteous path, shouldn’t betray its own. So, the Foundation Establishment master who has been lurking in the shadows, plotting for Skeleton Mountain, might genuinely be the one behind the Three Rivers Society!’

The more Lu Yang thought about it, the more suspicious the Three Rivers Society seemed, yet he maintained a composed expression: "So that's it. Does Second Senior Brother wish to see me?"

"Precisely," Fairy Feixia nodded. "Second Senior Brother has come to Skeleton Mountain and is in need of some capable assistance, so he hopes Senior Brother can lend a hand."

Assistance? More like cannon fodder!

Lu Yang decisively shook his head. "Though I possess a slight understanding of array formations, simply put, my strength is greatly diminished without them. How could I possibly be worthy of Second Senior Brother's high regard? I suggest Second Senior Brother seeks out someone more capable."

Lu Yang spoke with great confidence. Although he had joined the Three Rivers Society and signed a spiritual contract, he wasn't their slave. He still possessed this much autonomy; who could force him?

Fairy Feixia clearly thought the same, which was why she merely passed on the message. Now that the message was delivered, her expression gradually turned ambiguous. Two blushes appeared on her fair, charming face, and her glances exuded charm and allure.

"Junior Brother, this humble one has recently encountered some difficulties in array formations. I ask Junior Brother for more guidance..."

"That would be excellent." Lu Yang's spirits immediately lifted.

For the next three months, Lu Yang's pace of life slowed considerably. Each day was spent either discussing the Dao with Fairy Feixia or researching the Hundred Bones Reverting to Truth Grand Array outside. Sometimes, when inspiration struck, he would simply do both at once.

However, compared to his peaceful days, Skeleton Mountain outside the market town was in utter chaos. Not only the Divine Martial Sect and the Primordial Saint Sect, but also their affiliated sects, and even some astonishingly powerful rogue cultivators were drawn there. When the three parties met, they naturally clashed. During this period, several ancient Shamanic Ghost Path ruins were unearthed, further confirming the existence of the Shamanic Ghost Secret Realm.

It was also at this time that Fairy Feixia brought him news: Zhao Xuhe had been using Lu Yang's name to seize many opportunities outside the market town.

"I didn't expect my name to be so useful..."

Lu Yang was somewhat surprised after hearing this. Zhao Xuhe had several times contended with others for opportunities, falling into dangerous situations, only to turn the tide by invoking Lu Yang's name. Clearly, Ouyang Haoze's death had indeed instilled fear and caution in many towards him. Of course, this was also because Zhao Xuhe was shrewd and knew when to advance and retreat. He hadn't yet provoked truly formidable characters, which was why he could "assume the tiger's might."

"Junior Brother, are you truly not going to intervene in this matter?" Fairy Feixia's charming face was tinged with anger, her words icy. "This person is borrowing your name, drawing karmic repercussions upon you. If you ask me, it's better to kill him first!"

"No need to bother with him." Lu Yang shook his head. Zhao Xuhe wasn't returning to the market town at all, his mind set on searching Skeleton Mountain for ancient Shamanic Ghost Path remnants and that Shamanic Ghost Secret Realm. If he wanted to kill him, he would have to leave the market town. But how could that be possible? "Let him be. He once mortgaged some contribution points with me and I agreed he could borrow my name. There's nothing more to say."

After seeing Fairy Feixia off, the expression on Lu Yang's face gradually sobered. "Heh heh! Interesting. Over the past few months, everything I've heard and seen seems to be urging me, wanting me to leave the market town?"

A word unconsciously emerged in Lu Yang's mind: Tribulation! For a mere Qi Condensation cultivator like himself to be targeted by a Foundation Establishment master, to have his karma deduced, and to be schemed against in every way—if this wasn't a tribulation, then what was?

"Karma, that damned thing! No matter what, with tribulation upon me, I must not act rashly. Only by keeping my cave abode closed and quietly reciting a few scrolls of the Yellow Court can I hope to avoid this calamity..."

First, the Three Rivers Society, exerting external pressure. Now, Zhao Xuhe, involving internal connections.

"No matter how you bait me, I simply won't bite the hook. The hidden dragon remains in its abyss; how can you challenge my arrogance?"

At this thought, Lu Yang suddenly felt his mind clear. His previously somewhat agitated thoughts returned to calm, and he felt light all over, as if he had shed another layer of karma.

Time flowed on, and another month passed.

Over a thousand li east of Skeleton Mountain market town, a streak of light was desperately fleeing, seemingly using some blood-burning technique. Behind it followed seven or eight other streaks of light.

"Zhao Xuhe! Where do you think you're running!"

The pursuers were all armed, their vital energies soaring. They were clearly disciples of the Divine Martial Sect, mostly in the late stage of Qi Condensation, with none at Grand Completion. If not for this, with Zhao Xuhe's cultivation, he would not have been able to escape. Nevertheless, fleeing all the way here had pushed him close to his limit. The only reason he hadn't fainted yet was purely out of hope.

"I can still be saved! I already sent Lu Yang a flying letter. As long as I can... as long as I can escape to that place, to the vicinity of the market town, Lu Yang will definitely save me!" Zhao Xuhe ran for his life, desperately convincing himself. "There's still my restriction on the Heaven Stealing secret art. As long as he still wants to break through to Foundation Establishment, and not wait eighty years until he's old and frail, he must come save me! He will come save me! He definitely will!"

Just then, to Zhao Xuhe's immense elation, a brilliant streak of light finally rose from the direction of the market town, seemingly having discovered his perilous situation.

"He's here! I knew he wouldn't abandon me!"

Seeing this, Zhao Xuhe's spirits immediately soared. The pursuers behind him also quickly slowed down, seemingly waiting for something. However, as time passed, everyone realized something was amiss. The brilliant streak of light was still on its way, but it just wasn't arriving.

Finally, Zhao Xuhe could run no more. The pursuers from the Divine Martial Sect, somewhat reluctantly, cornered him, and thus a fierce battle ensued between the two sides. The battle lasted for half a day. By the end, the Divine Martial Sect pursuers didn't even dare to use full force, fearing they might kill Zhao Xuhe with a single blow. They occasionally glanced in the direction of the distant light. Upon closer inspection... wasn't that streak of light getting further and further away?

Finally, Zhao Xuhe completely broke down. "No! Why!?"

He suddenly spat out a mouthful of heart blood, then knelt on the ground, having completely exhausted his last bit of strength. Even his life force began to rapidly dissipate. Before dying, only one thought remained in his mind.

Did Lu Yang not want the Heaven Stealing secret art anymore?

"Why didn't you save me!?"

Little did he know, this was also the thought of the mastermind behind this chase. In the shadows, Ouyang Feng, an elder of the Divine Martial Sect, was equally perplexed. He looked towards the distant Skeleton Mountain market town, a hint of reluctance and helplessness in his eyes.

"Why didn't he save him?"

"Only a fool would save him!"

Withdrawing his streak of light, Lu Yang looked at what must have been Zhao Xuhe's nth distress message, casually tossing it aside. "Did he truly think he could blackmail me with a secret art? It's only eighty years, I can afford to wait! Once your restriction naturally dissipates, the secret art will still be mine! If not this life, then I'll just use it in the next one..."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang couldn't help but sigh at Zhao Xuhe's misfortune. If he had truly managed to escape all the way into the market town, Lu Yang wouldn't have minded helping him out. But outside the market town? Then it could only be said that they were fated not to meet.

"Senior Brother Zhao, may you rest in peace. You faced hardship and sacrificed your life for the Saint Sect. In the future, I will definitely petition the Heaven Mending Peak Lord to grant you a grand burial. As for your debts, let's forget about them in this life. I'll come find you for them in the next!"
