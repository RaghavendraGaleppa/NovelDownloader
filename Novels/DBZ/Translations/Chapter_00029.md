# Chapter 29: Dividing Forces  

The Mist Ridge Mountain's Li family ancestral hall was unusually lively as their Foundation Establishment ancestor made a rare appearance to preside over the clan meeting.  

The Li family ancestor was an elderly man with snow-white hair, his body exuding an aura of fading vitality. After a long silence, he finally spoke in a measured tone, "The Alchemy Cauldron Xiao family has offered compensation—not only releasing three more Foundation Establishment Pills but also promising that those who purchase them may attempt their breakthrough within their [Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City]."  

"What are your thoughts on this?"  

Almost immediately, an elder stood up to voice his opinion.  

"Ancestor, we must seize this opportunity. While Foundation Establishment Pills can be bought with spirit stones, the chance to attempt a breakthrough within Alchemy Cauldron City is truly a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity!"  

His words were met with immediate agreement from the gathered elders.  

For a cultivation family with a Foundation Establishment expert, even the weakest among them could accumulate enough resources over sixty years to purchase a single Foundation Establishment Pill.  

But for most families, acquiring the pill was only the first step. They still had to ensure its safe return, find a suitable clan member to consume it, and secure a safe location for the breakthrough—free from external disturbances.  

Even if all these conditions were met, success was never guaranteed.  

Thus, the Xiao family's offer was as generous as it could be.  

Once a Foundation Establishment Pill was secured, the buyer could attempt their breakthrough within Alchemy Cauldron City, under the protection of a Golden Core True Monarch.  

No longer would they need to worry about safely transporting the pill back, enemy ambushes, or interruptions during the process.  

"I share the same sentiment," the Li family ancestor said, his eyes suddenly sharpening. "However, for our Li family to produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator, we must first overcome a trial."  

That trial was none other than the "Blackwater Pool Wang family."  

The two families had been locked in fierce conflict in recent years, and the Wang family would never allow the Li family to produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator without interference.  

Li Wanlong, the current family head who had remained silent until now, finally spoke, "The ancestor speaks wisely. The Wang family will not stand idly by while we attempt this. Given their treacherous nature, they will likely ambush us en route."  

In fact, Wang family cultivators might already be lurking within a hundred miles of Mist Ridge Mountain.  

The first challenge for the Li family was simply reaching Alchemy Cauldron City safely—otherwise, everything else was meaningless.  

"For this operation, I propose dividing into two teams," the ancestor declared. "One led by Wanlong, the other by Wanqing. Each will take thirty thousand spirit stones from the family treasury."  

---  

The price of a Foundation Establishment Pill was not fixed and fluctuated with market conditions, but it rarely exceeded thirty thousand spirit stones.  

The elders were stunned by the ancestor's decision.  

Yet the two men in question—Li Wanlong and Li Wanqing—remained expressionless, as if they had already known of this arrangement.  

"Is this wise? If we fail, the family may struggle to recover for decades."  

"Wouldn't consolidating our forces be safer?"  

"I agree with the ancestor. Now is the time to take the gamble!"  

"If our family doesn't produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator, can we even hold onto Mist Ridge Mountain? Just one more will secure our stability for the next century!"  

"I also agree, but why divide into two teams?"  

The elders argued back and forth, each holding differing opinions.  

Watching the chaos, the Li family ancestor frowned and thundered, "My decision is final!"  

His commanding presence instantly silenced the room.  

The elders bowed in unison. "As the ancestor decrees."  

Such was the authority of a high-ranking cultivator over their juniors. Once the strongest made a decision, the rest could only follow.  

To overturn such a decree, one would have to demonstrate superior strength—such as if an elder suddenly revealed they had achieved Foundation Establishment without a pill. Only then would the ancestor reconsider.  

Once the other elders had withdrawn, only Li Wanlong and Li Wanqing remained in the hall.  

The ancestor had further instructions for them.  

"The Wang family will undoubtedly send a Foundation Establishment expert this time," he said. "Mist Ridge Mountain itself is secure—with the Upper Sect and the Xiao clan overseeing Yunzhou, the Wang family won't dare act recklessly here. I will personally escort Wanlong's team."  

"Wanqing, take this."  

He tossed Li Wanqing a transparent orb crackling with violent lightning.  

A **Thunderclap Pearl**!  

Li Wanqing recognized it instantly. Two years ago, he had given his son an identical one—though far weaker than the one now in his hands.  

Then, the ancestor transmitted a message directly into Li Wanqing's mind.  

Li Wanlong watched silently, saying nothing.  

"Do you understand?" the ancestor finally asked aloud.  

After a brief pause, Li Wanqing replied firmly, "I will not disappoint you, ancestor!"  

---  

The ancestor nodded in satisfaction before suddenly asking, "During the last auction incident, wasn't there an outsider who survived unharmed?"  

"Yes," Li Wanqing answered, puzzled. Why was the ancestor bringing up Wei Qian now? How had he caught the ancestor's attention?  

The ancestor said indifferently, "That man has some luck to have survived. When you depart for Alchemy Cauldron City, take him with you."  

With those words, Wei Qian's fate was sealed.  

The next day, when Wei Qian was summoned by Li Wanqing and informed of the decision, his face remained impassive—he had already anticipated this.  

He only asked one question: *When do we leave?*  

Li Wanqing's answer was simple: *Wait for further instructions.*  

For security reasons, he wouldn't disclose such details.  

Though Wei Qian understood, he couldn't help but feel uneasy.  

Soon, however, he pushed aside these distractions.  

What mattered now was using the **Wishing Dragon Pearl** to assess the danger of this mission.  

If the required wishing days exceeded fifty—no, thirty—he would flee immediately, escaping to **Black Flood Dragon Immortal City** and returning to the life of a rogue cultivator.  

Even with the **Wishing Dragon Pearl** as his golden finger, he had no intention of tying himself to the Li family forever.  

Though he held some goodwill toward them, he wouldn't risk his life for their sake!  

The next day, the pearl delivered its verdict.  

**Fourteen wishing days**—that was the cost to safely navigate this ordeal.
