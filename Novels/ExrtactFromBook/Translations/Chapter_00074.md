# Chapter 74: The Four Realms of Celestial Being  

By the time Han Yue began his secluded cultivation, he had already spent over three years in the Jade Sky Realm!  

During these years, he had ceaselessly sought and pursued all knowledge related to cultivation, expending considerable time and spirit stones. Yet, the only cultivation method he could truly practice was the incomplete "Thunder Nurturing Body," a true inheritance of the Divine Thunder Palace.  

Worse still, he had failed to establish a complete understanding or perspective of the cultivation system. This illustrated just how difficult it was for ordinary rogue cultivators to obtain true Daoist teachings.  

After Han Yue ascended to the heavens in a single step and absorbed qi into his body, he practiced "Thunder Nurturing Body," but it only provided him with a method to accumulate mana—not a path to advancement. The so-called cultivation knowledge he had acquired in the Flesh Market was merely a description of the power system within the Jade Sky Realm—commonly known as "one realm, one heaven."  

Apart from having some understanding of the Body Entry Realm, Han Yue knew nothing about how to cultivate or advance in the subsequent realms. In other words, he had always been circling outside the gates of cultivation, never truly stepping onto the path.  

The first question in "Answers to Disciples' Questions" was answered by the True Person Chuanzong:  

"Disciples of our Divine Thunder Palace, upon receiving the true teachings of the sect, must discard all prior knowledge and break through the barriers of perception. From then on, the path of cultivation shall be rebuilt upon the foundation of the true teachings!"  

In the eyes of True Person Chuanzong, all the Daoist techniques and secret arts learned by disciples before entering the sect were mere dross. To prevent these impurities from misleading disciples in their cultivation, the first challenge they faced upon entry was to forget what they had learned and rebuild their path according to the true teachings.  

For Han Yue, this was no challenge at all! Over the past few years, he had relied solely on the mana cultivated through "Thunder Nurturing Body" and the divine abilities granted by the "Compendium of Ten Thousand Methods" to form the skeleton of his cultivation. After being recognized by True Person Chuanzong, his mana was allowed to remain, and his awakened divine abilities were deemed innate talents in the True Person's eyes.  

Han Yue had already laid the foundation of the highest grade. Now, he only needed to rely on the true teachings to forge his own path of the Dao!  

Adjusting his mind and body, Han Yue immersed all his divine sense and thoughts into the heritage stele, enveloping the "Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetic Longevity Scripture."  

For the first time in his life, Han Yue listened to the spiritual voice of the Great Dao and the enlightenment of longevity—understanding the root of cultivation and ascending the ladder of advancement!  

The "Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetic Longevity Scripture," a supreme scripture passed down in the Divine Thunder Palace for hundreds of thousands of years and responsible for nurturing countless true inheritors and great cultivators, finally unveiled its mysterious veil before Han Yue!  

---  

This ancient scripture, passed down for hundreds of thousands of years, contained its own method of ascending the heavenly steps toward longevity. Han Yue set aside all subjective judgments and speculations, absorbing all the information within the inheritance.  

Bit by bit, he comprehended the profound truths of the Daoist methods, constructing a cultivation system unique to himself!  

True Great Dao teachings were not obscure and convoluted texts but the most authentic and sublime enlightenment of thought. When this enlightenment descended upon a cultivator, it would naturally transform into practical cultivation methods according to the cultivator's understanding, free from any error or bias.  

Once comprehended, the true teachings were obtained!  

As time passed, Han Yue, in this gradual process of enlightenment, realized the path he must cultivate and understood how to cultivate it!  

The "Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetic Longevity Scripture" recorded the Four Realms of Celestial Being, ascending step by step to the heavens:  

**First Realm: Refining Essence into Qi**  
This realm refined the essence of primordial qi, the essence of mana, and the essence of flesh and blood. It transformed the mysteries of primordial qi and mana, obtaining the true seed of primordial qi and the spiritual root of mana, laying the foundation for the peerless Golden Core—also known as the **Golden Core Realm**.  

**Second Realm: Refining Qi into Spirit**  
This realm refined the true nature of divine abilities, the true seed of primordial qi, and the spiritual root of mana. It transformed the infant of primordial qi and the divine root of the heart-mind, condensing the True Dao Infant—also known as the **Divine Infant Realm**.  

**Third Realm: Refining Spirit to Return to Void**  
This realm refined the essence of the void and the true meaning of the Great Dao, bearing the karma of the realm and transforming the true cause of the spiritual void. It condensed the True Spirit, opened blessed lands, shattered boundaries, and attained longevity—also known as the **Longevity Realm**.  

**Fourth Realm: Refining Void to Merge with Dao**  
This realm refined the self to merge with the Heavenly Dao, opening a cave heaven and becoming a Celestial Being—also known as the **Celestial Being Realm**.  

This true Great Dao teaching, this scripture of longevity, was truly a single step, a single heaven! Each step surpassed brought great advancement in divine abilities and broadened the path of the Dao!  

In the "Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetic Longevity Scripture," condensing the Great Dao Golden Core was merely the beginning!  

The Golden Core Realm, Divine Infant Realm, Longevity Realm, and Celestial Being Realm—these four realms corresponded to the second, third, fourth, and fifth tiers of the cultivation system in the Jade Sky Realm.  

Meanwhile, what the world regarded as the solemn beginning of cultivation—the crucial first tier, the so-called Body Entry, Qi Absorption, and Foundation Establishment—was merely a passing intermediate process in the journey to condensing the Golden Core in true supreme scriptures like the "Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetic Longevity Scripture"!  

It was no wonder Han Yue had not found any content on Body Entry Realm cultivation in the longevity inheritance. In the eyes of the high-level cultivators who wrote the scripture, it simply wasn't considered a true realm.  

Perhaps, in their view, true seeds of cultivation should directly practice the Great Dao methods and immediately condense the Golden Core?  

However, after hundreds of thousands of years of evolution, times had changed, and the true teachings of the Divine Thunder Palace had also been adjusted.  

In "Answers to Disciples' Questions," True Person Chuanzong stated:  

"The cultivation of the first-tier Body Entry Realm strengthens the body, enhances mana, and nurtures essence and qi to accumulate fuel for refining essence into qi. Disciples must not neglect it—it is indispensable!"  

Compared to ten thousand years ago, the most important change in the Divine Thunder Palace's cultivation was the increased emphasis on Body Entry Realm training. According to True Person Chuanzong's deductions, if one's cultivation accumulation before refining essence into qi was sufficiently profound, it could greatly improve the quality of the Golden Core and the likelihood of comprehending divine abilities.  

The "Thunder Nurturing Body" and "Thunder Nurturing Soul" that Han Yue was currently practicing were a set of Body Entry Realm secret methods. These were highly effective techniques jointly deduced by multiple Longevity True Persons and even Celestial True Venerables of the Divine Thunder Palace.  

The Thunder Nurturing Runes condensed by these techniques were inherently stable, making them easy to practice. Moreover, the quality and speed of mana accumulation were outstanding, making them excellent first-tier introductory techniques.  

The most ingenious aspect of these techniques was that they had no realm or bottleneck restrictions. Practitioners could devote all their talent, resources, and time to accumulating Thunder Nurturing Runes without limit. Once they reached their personal limit, they could activate the method within the longevity inheritance to transform all accumulated Thunder Nurturing Runes and primordial qi mana into fuel for advancing to the second tier.  

Thus, Han Yue's two full cycles of "Thunder Nurturing Body" were not wasted—they would save him a great deal of time!
