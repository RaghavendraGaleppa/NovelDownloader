Chapter 270: Regret! Such Deep Regret!

The newcomer was as gaunt and weathered as an ancient pine, with a vertical mark of purple-gold between his eyebrows that seemed neither fully open nor closed, as if it contained half a heavenly tribulation.

Most terrifying were his eyes. Deep and clear as a tranquil pool, wherever his gaze fell, the very air seemed to solidify.

The scales of Xu Yunfan’s dragon armor trembled silently, stimulated into a defensive posture by that gaze alone. What made his hair stand on end even more was that, despite having cultivated the Lin Mantra for so long, he had not sensed a single trace of this man’s presence beforehand!

He could only sense it now that he had entered the Lin State, perfectly controlling the space within three zhang of himself.

This old Taoist... he must have reached the state of Harmony with Heaven!

"Senior Brother?!" Bi Sheng hurriedly performed a Taoist salute, the hem of his robe fluttering without any wind.

Xu Yunfan’s thumb pressed hard against the mouth of the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace, cold sweat already soaking his inner garments.

This old Taoist had no pressure or aura around him at all; the fact that he could merge with the heavens and earth without revealing his form was even more terrifying.

"Little friend, no need to be nervous."

Bi Yuan smiled lightly. "This old Taoist is Bi Yuan. I merely wish to ask about the secret realm..."

Bi Sheng suddenly coughed dryly, stepping forward to block Bi Yuan’s line of sight toward Xu Yunfan. Bi Yuan looked slightly surprised, but a hint of amusement appeared in his eyes.

He glanced at Lin Qingxuan, who was hurriedly lowering her head and standing up.

"You girl, just like your master. So lazy that the morning bell couldn't even wake you. The Mystic Sky Mirror is still here, yet you rush off to drink tea. Have you finished your noon cultivation?"

Lin Qingxuan shrank her neck, twisting the wrinkled cloud patterns on her Taoist robe with her fingertips. She forced a dry laugh. "Grandmaster Bi... good afternoon."

Her voice was as thin as a mosquito's buzz, not even startling the bronze crane incense burner at the edge of the Five Celestial Altar.

Bi Yuan’s wide sleeves hung down, the hidden star embroidery on the cuffs flickering with his breath.

Xu Yunfan saw clearly that Bi Yuan’s equipment was extremely luxurious. Even his Taoist robe was woven from unknown metal threads. It looked ethereal, but its defense was not much weaker than a suit of armor—perhaps comparable to the dragon scales Xu Yunfan was wearing. The craftsmanship was truly exquisite.

The Dao Sect had a long history of inheritance, though fragmented, it connected the past to the present, spanning nearly ten thousand years with an astonishing foundation.

Bi Yuan’s gaze swept over the center of the Five-Colored Sacrificial Earth. There, a few wisps of cloud vortices remained, left behind when the secret realm collapsed and its exit expelled them.

"Since the small world has been destroyed, the day those 'things' descend should be postponed somewhat."

His voice carried a hint of relief.

Bi Sheng’s expression shifted, then he sighed. "That old witch caused this trouble. Now that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth is rising, it only creates more variables."

Bi Yuan smiled helplessly. "This is the will of heaven. We, too, must follow it to achieve success."

"Again with the will of heaven..."

The veins beneath Bi Sheng’s Taoist crown throbbed violently.

He almost roared the words his master spoke before passing away: "When did the cultivators of our Dao Sect become mere echoes of the heavens?" But as if remembering something, he ultimately let out a sigh filled with the taste of rust.

After Bi Yuan left, Bi Sheng composed himself and walked up to Xu Yunfan. His thin fingers gripped the handle of his horsetail whisk tightly, the knuckles making faint cracking sounds beneath his robe.

Looking at the flowing golden blood energy surrounding the youth before him, the sharpness exuding from his pores made it hard for Bi Sheng to keep his eyes open. Such vigorous vitality—how long had it been since he had seen such a thing?

He asked kindly, "Xu boy, do you have a master now?"

Xu Yunfan replied, "I am currently a disciple of the Casting Hall in the Heavenly Work Cave."

"The Casting Hall?!"

Bi Sheng’s voice suddenly rose, causing his Taoist crown to tilt.

"That is to say, forging weapons, occasionally going into the mine pits to dig for ore."

"Forging... digging..."

Bi Sheng suddenly jumped up and grabbed his own beard, his Taoist crown tilting without him noticing.

"What a waste of heavenly materials!!"

He suddenly felt his throat tighten, recalling the words he had once said on the Cloud Accumulation Mountain at the border of the Eight Hundred Miles of Wasteland and Ice Plains.

"This boy’s bones are mixed and mediocre, his aptitude low. Even touching the threshold of martial arts would be a blessing from his ancestors!"

The memory bit into his heart like a venomous snake.

At that time, he had looked down upon Xu Yunfan from high above, saying that Li Haomiao possessed true blood, the lineage of a true immortal, and that Fang Mushan had innate talent with the strength to bear the tripod. These were the good seedlings the Dao Sect needed.

Now, those two were still stuck tempering themselves in the Outer Three Heavens realm. Fang Mushan, practicing the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, hadn't even had a single reaction from the spiritual energy he breathed in yet. But the "worthless stone" before him had already washed his marrow and achieved Gang Qi!

It felt like a slap to the face, burning with pain.

Xu Yunfan watched coldly as Bi Sheng’s face twisted. He suddenly found it absurd. The image of this old Taoist sitting high on a cloud chariot, looking down on all living beings back then, overlapped with his current frantic and狼狈 (wretched) appearance. It was even more satisfying than crushing Zhou Tianyan to death with a hammer.

Bi Sheng suddenly jumped up and slapped his thigh, his intestines turning green with regret.

The old Taoist slammed his horsetail whisk onto the ground, actually leaving a half-inch footprint in the blue stone slab. "What does that old bastard Zhan Yan know! Using a towering tree as a fire poker!"

Bi Sheng could no longer hold back and blurted out, "Have you thought about changing your sect?"

When he said this, his old face turned slightly red without him realizing. He had once said Xu Yunfan’s aptitude was unbearably poor, that becoming a martial artist was already a blessing from his ancestors...

Xu Yunfan’s expression immediately darkened. He said sternly, "Daoist, please don't joke. I am now a disciple of Hall Master Zhan Yan of the Heavenly Work Cave, and also a true disciple of the Heavenly Work Cave. How could I change my allegiance?"

In the martial world, if one were to truly change sects, one would not only be criticized behind one's back but also be known everywhere. Anyone who recognized him would call him a "three-surname slave"...

Moreover, his master Zhan Yan treated him like a son, sparing no effort or resource to think for him. He naturally had no intention of leaving.

Hearing Xu Yunfan’s immediate refusal, Bi Sheng felt regret, but the admiration in his eyes grew even stronger.

With his discerning eyes, he could naturally see that Xu Yunfan had cultivated the ultimate techniques of several top sects. The killing intent he exuded after leaving the secret realm was particularly fierce.

With the Dao Sect’s intelligence network, he naturally knew the composition of the small world secret realm and that sects like the Nine Shine Sect and the Xuan Zhen Gate had opened entrances, sending many disciples inside.

And what Xu Yunfan had done went without saying.

To go from a humble background to this level in just two years, the magnitude of his opportunities needs no explanation.

Although the Dao Sect values bone structure, it values opportunities even more. As for what Xu Yunfan had done before, he didn't care at all. As long as Xu Yunfan’s mentality was normal, everything was not a problem.

Xu Yunfan could naturally see that Bi Sheng had seen through his background. Now that he had achieved the Grandmaster level of Marrow Washing, as long as...

Xu Yunfan felt a slight heaviness in his heart. Just moments ago, to deal with the dangers of exiting the secret realm, he had pushed his martial power to its peak. If it were a Grandmaster of Organ Refining, it would be fine, but being seen by a Supreme Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm of Qi Cultivation, his form was inevitably exposed.

Right now, Bi Sheng was filled with regret.

He wished he could slap himself a few times on the spot. He never thought that, after a lifetime of boasting about his sharp eyes, he would be blinded on the matter of accepting disciples.

Compared to Xu Yunfan, the two he had accepted before, Li Haomiao and Fang Mushan, seemed utterly foolish. Thinking of them now, he even found their faces a bit uglier.
