# Chapter 34: Return!

Everyone exchanged glances, not daring to provoke Liu Yan. She was known throughout the imperial capital as a notorious Rakshasa; though her beauty was peerless, her temper was equally formidable.

"Come, let me introduce everyone. This is my fiancée, Tian Ling!"

Seeing the ambient temperature steadily rising—the others were protected by their cultivation, while Zhou Tian could only endure, a fine sheen of sweat already covering his forehead—Zhou Tian hastily changed the subject.

"Greetings, everyone." Tian Ling bowed respectfully.

The others returned the greeting. Although they had all heard rumors about the Haotian Sect, no one was foolish enough to bring it up now.

"Zhou Tian, you are truly blessed to have a beauty like Sister Tian Ling as your wife!" Liu Yan stepped forward, taking Tian Ling's hand. Prime Minister Liu and King Qin had been friends for many years, and their families had frequent interactions, so Liu Yan was also one of Zhou Tian's closer friends.

Liu Yan fussed over Tian Ling like an older sister, while Tian Ling, like a helpless lamb, offered a reassuring glance. Zhou Tian then ceased to pay them much mind. Tian Ling's personality was too timid; it was probably good for Liu Yan to "train" her a bit.

As the two girls whispered to each other, Zhou Tian engaged in desultory conversation with Zhou Xun Chuan and the others, subtly managing to ascertain the identities of the unfamiliar faces present.

Excluding him and Tian Ling, there were eight other people present. He already knew Zhou Xun Chuan, Liu Yan, Gu Feng, and Li Xuanyi. The others were:

Zhang Yi, the disciple of the Imperial Preceptor, possessed a scholarly demeanor, eyes like a bright moon, pupils like stars, and a gentle disposition, making him the dream lover of many women in the imperial capital.

Zhao Yuan, son of the Marquis of Wilderness, inherited his father's robust physique. With a tiger's back and a bear's waist, his build at such a young age was like that of a primordial fierce beast.

Wu, son of the Marquis of Heavenly Lion, had a mane of golden hair and brilliant eyes. It was rumored that their lineage possessed the bloodline of an ancient Heavenly Lion, granting them terrifying innate divine abilities. How they acquired this ancient bloodline, however, remained a mystery.

Sun Shou, son of the Duke of Weiguo, had an unremarkable appearance and an aura as ordinary as Zhou Tian's, like a mortal. Yet, rumor had it that his strategic acumen was astonishing, possessing the ability to govern the world.

Adding Zhou Zui and Zhou Tian, these were all the young generation of the imperial capital. Except for Zhou Tian, this once-in-ten-thousand-years good-for-nothing, every single one of them was a dragon among men. There were no so-called dissolute wastrels; even Zhou Zui, who frequented pleasure quarters, was once suspected of practicing a special cultivation method, otherwise, why would his cultivation not lag behind anyone else's?

These aristocratic families had long histories of inheritance; would they not know how to nurture their descendants? Character is not inherent; it is entirely shaped by subtle influences over time and can be cultivated. Profligate wastrels? Bullying others with power? Get lost!

During the rather dull small talk session, everyone exchanged a few words here and there. Liu Yan and Tian Ling were whispering about something, appearing to be having a delightful conversation.

Time passed minute by minute. Gu Feng, who stood nearby, suddenly spoke, "That kid Zhou Zui is probably going to have his legs broken by His Highness King Xiaoyao!"

Upon hearing this, everyone paused and looked in the direction of Gu Feng's gaze. Among the group led by Emperor Qin, the Imperial Preceptor, dressed in a white robe, stepped forward, holding a golden talisman disk adorned with swirling runes.

Speaking of the Imperial Preceptor, he was quite interesting. Zhou Tian's father, Zhou Yi, often mentioned him, so Zhou Tian remembered him quite well. Originally, the Heavenly Qin Empire had no such position as Imperial Preceptor. During their training in the Eight Provinces in the era of Emperor Qin and Zhou Yi, they encountered a disciple of the then-leader of the Foolish Man Sect, who was also the most favored disciple of the sect leader. For some unknown reason, this person, who was supposed to be the most astute calculator, was somehow "abducted" back by Emperor Qin and Zhou Yi and given the position of Imperial Preceptor.

It was said that the Foolish Man Sect leader was furious, stamping his feet, but the rice was already cooked. The Imperial Preceptor of their Heavenly Qin Empire wasn't someone who could just leave whenever he wanted. And so, the matter was settled.

Seeing the Imperial Preceptor like this, the welcoming ceremony was about to begin. King Xiaoyao looked gloomy; it seemed Zhou Zui was in for quite a rough time. Although this was just a welcoming ceremony, and in essence, nothing major, since Zhou Tian and the others were here, it wouldn't look good for Zhou Zui to be the only one absent.

Silently praying for Zhou Zui in his heart, Zhou Tian expressed his helplessness. Although it was his divine ability that caused the situation, he couldn't control it either.

More and more rune streamers emerged from the golden talisman disk held by the Imperial Preceptor, until finally, a golden light soared into the sky, piercing through the clouds.

The golden light exploded, revealing a colossal golden array unfolding in the air, slowly rotating.

"Boom! Boom! Boom!"

Deafening drumbeats rang out. Zhou Tian's face flushed with blood; he was merely a mortal, and the power contained within the drums caused his Qi and blood to surge in reverse.

"Faster, faster... I'm going to die soon!" Despite the immense discomfort, Zhou Tian continuously urged the drums to quicken in his mind, his perversity unimaginable.

Just then, a large hand rested on his shoulder. Energy surged, quickly suppressing his tumultuous Qi and blood.

Zhou Tian turned around, flashing an awkward smile. Zhou Xun Chuan waved his hand, indicating no need for thanks.

*Thanks for nothing, you brute!* Zhou Tian thought to himself.

The drums shook the heavens, and the golden array spun faster and faster. Everyone in the imperial capital stopped their movements, looking up at the sky.

Roar!

A roar, from an unknown creature, came from within the grand array.

As the sound approached, a peculiar, thousand-zhang long beast, covered in purple scales, with a single horn and resembling a flood dragon, emerged from the array, pulling a war chariot behind it.

The war chariot seemed forged from a star, entirely crimson, with a stark metallic sheen, bearing blade, spear, and sword marks—scars left from its long years of battle, proof of its past dominance.

The chariot glowed, emanating rolling killing intent. Around it, blood flowed like rivers, corpses piled like mountains, and countless departed souls reached towards the sky, howling. The scene was tragic; these were all souls fallen beneath its wheels.

On the chariot stood a figure clad in black armor, only his eyes visible. They were sharp and formidable, his Qi and blood surging like a primordial god descending to cleanse the world with blood.

After emerging from the array, the strange beast shrank to a mere ten feet, and the black-armored man removed his helmet, revealing his appearance: black hair cascaded over his shoulders, his face stern. Upon closer inspection, he bore some resemblance to Emperor Qin.

"Your subject, Zhou Quan, greets Imperial Father!" The black-armored man came before Emperor Qin, kneeling on one knee. He was none other than the First Prince of the Heavenly Qin Empire, Zhou Quan!

"Rise!" Emperor Qin waved his hand, a look of gratification in his eyes, but he said little else.

Zhou Quan thanked him, rose, and stood to one side, looking up at the grand array in the sky. Many more people were still behind; he was merely the first.

Roar!

An earth-shattering lion's roar echoed, and a hundred-zhang tall golden lion leaped out from the grand array. Its fur was pure gold, without a single杂色, its muscles like cast gold, its beast eyes sharp, and its aura overwhelming, even cracking the void!
