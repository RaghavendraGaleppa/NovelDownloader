# Chapter 198: Conspiracy

Li Shiming left the Tian Tang Kingdom, now carrying a communication token that could be used across the Northern Shu Continent, allowing him to connect with the long-distance communication arrays. With this token, he could directly contact Yin Shilan within the territories of the Thousand Illusions Sect and its allied sects.

Meanwhile, Yin Shilan and Liang Yexuan were returning to their sect aboard a flying boat. A faint smile lingered on Yin Shilan's lips as she lost herself in thought. Noticing the prolonged silence from Liang Yexuan, Yin Shilan finally turned to her.

"Senior Sister, is something on your mind?" she asked softly.

"Junior Sister, whatever you do, don't tell anyone—not even Master Luo—that I advised Li Shiming to join the Shu Mountain Sect," Liang Yexuan pleaded earnestly.

"Why is that?" Yin Shilan was puzzled, realizing that Liang Yexuan had been preoccupied with this matter the entire journey.

"I had no idea Li Shiming, despite having only three spiritual roots, could comprehend Sword Intent at the Qi Refinement stage. Had I known, I would have recommended him to join our sect. At the very least, he could have entered as an inner disciple, and who knows—he might have even become another Sword Cultivator Golden Core for our sect!" Liang Yexuan explained with regret.

She didn't voice her deeper concern: she wasn't sure if Master Luo had deliberately suppressed Li Shiming's potential, perhaps testing him by only offering an outer disciple position. After all, elders often enjoyed tempering their disciples through such trials.

"Alright, I won't tell anyone," Yin Shilan replied cheerfully. She was simply relieved to know Li Shiming was safe and that they could stay in touch. Whether he joined the Thousand Illusions Sect mattered little to her now.

In truth, she had her own thoughts about which sect Li Shiming should join. As Liang Yexuan had pointed out, the Thousand Illusions Sect's cultivation methods weren't the best fit for him, and her master genuinely disliked Li Shiming. Given better options, it was only natural for him to choose a more suitable sect.

"By the way, aside from mastering Sword Intent, does Li Shiming have any other notable talents?" Liang Yexuan pressed curiously.

"He's also an intermediate Spiritual Farmer and a high-level Array Master. Does that count?" Yin Shilan replied with a light laugh.

"Oh no! Junior Sister, you should have told me sooner! What have I done?" Liang Yexuan collapsed dramatically onto the floor, staring blankly at the ceiling, her refined demeanor completely abandoned.

After more than ten days of flight, Li Shiming's flying boat finally reached the outskirts of the Shu Mountain Sect. The sect was nestled within the Shu Mountain Range, but he didn't venture directly into the sect's territory. Instead, he landed in a town at the mountain's base.

This town was under the strict protection of the Shu Mountain Sect, primarily housing the direct relatives of sect members and some cultivators who lacked the qualifications to join the sect but engaged in spirit trade under its patronage. Thanks to the sect's protection, the town had developed into a bustling hub for spirit trade.

The town was named Guan Shan Town. Li Shiming stored his flying boat outside and entered on foot. After spending a spirit stone to gather information, he confirmed his destination: the sect's stationed cultivator residence at the town center.

Walking through the lively streets, he noticed the abundance of spirit materials and the sheer number of cultivators. However, most lacked the Shu Mountain Sect's insignia, while those wearing the sect's robes—even if only at Qi Refinement—commanded immense respect, with other cultivators yielding to them.

Li Shiming appreciated the vibrant commercial atmosphere, which offered ample opportunities for him to thrive. If he could stay in the Shu Mountain Sect, his skills combined with this environment would make earning spirit stones far easier.

Lost in thought, he soon arrived at a building marked with the Shu Mountain Sect's emblem at the town center. Xu Chuan had mentioned that presenting the token here would allow him to contact Elder Su, Xu Chuan's master.

Seeing the sect's insignia, Li Shiming exhaled in relief. His perilous journey through the Spirit Beast territories of the Hundred Thousand Mountains to retrieve the Muyang Three-Leaf Grass had finally brought him to his destination.

"By a friend's request, I seek an audience with Elder Su," Li Shiming announced, pressing his hand lightly against the door. The door was protected by a formation, and his voice, infused with spiritual energy, carried inside.

Given that the matter involved a Golden Core Elder, the response was swift, regardless of its authenticity.

"Do you have proof?" The door opened to reveal a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator, who swept his spiritual sense over Li Shiming in a manner that was both intrusive and discourteous. But given the other party's status as a Shu Mountain Sect member and the location at the sect's doorstep, Li Shiming suppressed his displeasure.

He produced the token but didn't hand it over. The cultivator glanced at it, scanning it once more with his spiritual sense to verify its authenticity.

"Wait in town for word. I'll relay your message," the cultivator said indifferently before shutting the door.

Li Shiming blinked in surprise. He knew Xu Chuan was a true disciple of the sect. How could this mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator treat the token of a true disciple with such disrespect? Were all Shu Mountain Sect cultivators this arrogant?

Shaking his head, he turned and left, heading for an inn he had noticed earlier.

---

"What kind of room would the esteemed guest prefer?" the Qi Refinement stage innkeeper greeted him warmly.

"What options are available?" Li Shiming sensed the dense spiritual energy within the inn, a stark contrast to the thin energy outside. Unfamiliar with Northern Shu's accommodations for cultivators, he asked directly.

"For a cultivator of your level, only a private courtyard can provide sufficient spiritual energy for cultivation. The cost is fifty spirit stones per day," the innkeeper explained, skipping other options to present the most suitable one.

Li Shiming was intrigued. Even an inn here could cater to Foundation Establishment cultivators' needs—no wonder there were so many Foundation Establishment cultivators among the rogue practitioners. The spiritual energy density and quality in Northern Shu clearly surpassed that of Tian Hai Island.

"One courtyard for three days, please," Li Shiming said, handing over one hundred fifty spirit stones.

"Right this way." The innkeeper led him to the rear, where a series of private courtyards stood, each secured by formations.

"This courtyard is yours for three days. The jade token will expire afterward," the innkeeper said, handing him a token and pointing to a courtyard.

Nodding, Li Shiming used the token to enter. The moment he stepped inside, he felt the rich spiritual energy—nearly comparable to an upper-grade spirit vein. The accumulated energy here would suffice for several days of cultivation.

The setup suggested the inn controlled multiple spirit veins to sustain such accommodations. In reality, such inns were typically run by sects or major factions. The one in Guan Shan Town likely served as a reception area for visiting cultivators. During sect events, early arrivals would stay here, necessitating the relocation of spirit veins for their use.

Of course, it was also a lucrative business. Rogue cultivators could save up spirit stones to rent these spaces for breakthroughs or intensive cultivation.

Having neglected his "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art" for some time, Li Shiming immediately fortified the courtyard's formation with additional spirit stones and began his cultivation.

The "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art" drew vast amounts of spiritual energy into his body, converting it into thunder spiritual power that flowed into his spiritual lake. The "Five Elements Energy Absorption Formation" then transformed it into five-element thunder spiritual power, storing it in his spiritual lake. He cultivated without pause.

Meanwhile, Yin Shaotao, the stationed cultivator in Guan Shan Town, activated the communication formation immediately after receiving Li Shiming.

Despite his outwardly calm demeanor, Yin Shaotao was anything but composed. His hurried reception and abrupt door-closing were attempts to conceal his unease.

Recently assigned to Guan Shan Town—a coveted post due to its proximity to the sect and relative safety—Yin Shaotao had also been given a covert mission by True Disciple Ji: monitor any news related to Xu Chuan and report immediately.

Xu Chuan was another true disciple, backed by Elder Su, who held equal authority with Elder Ji, True Disciple Ji's father. Caught between these power struggles, Yin Shaotao had no choice but to comply, as he belonged to Elder Ji's faction.

He understood the gravity of the situation. Anyone bearing Xu Chuan's token to seek Elder Su must be involved in something significant. Withholding such information would be tantamount to treason—punishable by death.

True Disciple Ji, shielded by his Golden Core father, could easily shift blame onto Yin Shaotao if things went awry. After some deliberation, Yin Shaotao decided to inform True Disciple Ji first, delaying his report to Elder Su by an hour.

He wasted no time sending the message about Li Shiming to True Disciple Ji. An hour later, he relayed the same information to Elder Su's Tianmu Peak.

In four private courtyards of the Guan Shan Town inn, four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators—known as the Fierce Mountain Four Tigers—received identical instructions via their communication tokens.

Though rogue cultivators in name, they operated under True Disciple Ji's protection, handling tasks for him. Their current mission: eliminate a target in Guan Shan Town if necessary.

The specifics weren't disclosed, but any killing under the Shu Mountain Sect's nose carried severe consequences. However, the reward—entry into the sect as outer disciples—was too tempting to refuse.

Despite their fearsome moniker, the Fierce Mountain Four Tigers were insignificant in the eyes of sect cultivators. The moniker might as well have been "Fierce Mountain Four Kittens."

"The target is in Courtyard Seven, protected by a defensive formation," the leader whispered as they gathered.

Just then, an inn attendant "accidentally" dropped a jade token near them—one with higher access privileges to Courtyard Seven. The four exchanged glances, realizing True Disciple Ji's meticulous preparations.

Within moments, True Disciple Ji had not only located Li Shiming but also orchestrated everything. Eliminating a Foundation Establishment cultivator in Guan Shan Town was no small feat, especially without involving sect members directly.

The leader placed a formation disk outside Courtyard Seven, activating it to isolate the courtyard. "We have two incense sticks' time to finish this," he said gravely.

"Relax, it's just a rogue Foundation Establishment early-stage cultivator. This won't take long," the youngest scoffed.

Confident in their advantage, they activated the courtyard's control token. The defensive formation wavered but didn't dissipate entirely.

"What's going on?" the leader demanded.

"The target must have reinforced the formation. But it's not strong—we can break it together," the third brother, who had some knowledge of formations, replied.

"Quickly, attack together!" the leader ordered.

Four mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators struck simultaneously. With a thunderous crash, the formation—bolstered only by a few spirit stones—shattered instantly.
