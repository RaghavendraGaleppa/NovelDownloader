# Chapter 259: Journeying Down the River, Advancement in Martial Dao, and Receiving the True Sword Transmission

The legend of the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple" speaks of faces that never age and a lifetime of love and carefree wandering. Together, they created sword moves based on the principles of Yin and Yang. Yet, even for the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple, it was difficult to bring their sword art to its "pinnacle of perfection."

This was because the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword" was a dual-wielding sword art. The two traveled together in joy, their affection being genuine and true. However, because it was tied to emotional intent, it could not be achieved through bitter practice alone.

At the time, the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple had brought their sword art to the fourth layer. Looking back, every layer was perfect, yet they could not reach the "pinnacle." They thus made a secret pact to go their separate ways in search of improvement. The one who first perfected the first two layers would be the victor.

The loser would forge a Sword Seal, becoming the "Devotee Sword," submitting to the Master Sword.

Li Xian had obtained a fragmented sword manual and did not know the use of the "Sword Seal." Wen Caishang’s beautiful face flushed red; she had seen the complete manual and knew the meaning of this seal.

There was no time to think further.

Suddenly, he felt a cool sensation all over. Li Xian’s Yang energy and Wen Caishang’s Yin energy were drawn by the sword, blending and sublimating, then feeding back into each other. Wen Caishang was startled but overjoyed: "Li Lang, our sword Dao resonates with heaven and earth. The flow of Yin and Yang washes our bodies; this is a rare opportunity."

Using their bodies as vessels to receive the rhythm of Yin and Yang.

Li Xian’s Yang fire burned intensely, and the ridge of his spine gradually absorbed the Yin-Yang rhythm. A strange, radiant light rose, his pupils deep and profound, the red mole between his eyebrows seductive.

The two touched palms and sat down cross-legged nearby.

Wen Caishang’s realm was profound, her body approaching that of the heavens and earth. The principle of "Yin-Yang" was precious; martial arts involving this path were rare. The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword began with "emotion," researching it for a lifetime, gradually touching the rhythm of Yin and Yang.

It was hidden within the sword manual. The terrifying aspect of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword lay in "emotion" and "Yin-Yang."

The heavens and earth require the flow of the sun and moon.

Comprehending the mystery of Yin and Yang. It was like having a world within the body, beginning to have the alternation of day and night, and gradually giving rise to the changes of the four seasons...

It could preserve one's appearance from decay!

"Li Xian’s talent is too terrifying. His martial cultivation isn't fast, but it seems endless."

"Li Xian... you..."

Wen Caishang’s thoughts were chaotic, as if scratched by a cat. Her beautiful eyes showed joy, anger, and annoyance... a mix of various emotions.

She compared herself internally and felt a great sense of defeat. Since entering the Jianghu, she had rarely met a match.

Li Xian started as a servant, possessing the Perfect Physique, Pupil Physique, Spine Like a Mountain, reaching the pinnacle, supreme archery... all of which surprised her. Born of humble origins, he was even more composed, scheming, and exceptionally resolute.

She cherished this talent, loved this man deeply. Recalling the dangers along the road, how Li Xian risked his life for her, braved dangers for her... yet she also hated this talent.

Suddenly, she raised an eyebrow.

The "Devouring Qi Gu" in her Qi Lake felt the rhythm of Yin and Yang, and the speed at which it drank her internal Qi slowed slightly.

Wen Caishang was overjoyed, realizing the weakness of the Devouring Qi Gu. She knew how to deal with it; she just needed to return to the manor to be free of this predicament.

Once the rhythm of Yin and Yang dissipated, Li Xian exhaled a long breath of turbid air and laughed: "Wife, how do you feel?" Wen Caishang smiled gently: "It feels very good. Xiao Xian, I am tired of playing along the way. Take me back to the estate."

Li Xian laughed: "Alright."

It was the middle of the fifth month.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang traveled and played, admiring flowers and the moon, their intimacy growing, extremely joyful.

This day, at the border between Chongling Prefecture and Qiongtian Prefecture. Wen Caishang asked Li Xian to inquire about the route to "Feiyun City." Learning it was over ten miles away, they walked on foot to Feiyun City. Upon entering the city, Wen Caishang led the way to the bustling market streets.

They saw a "Silk Garment Pavilion," twenty-seven zhang high, carved beams and painted rafters, hung with colorful lanterns. In front of the pavilion, carriages and horses flowed like a stream; no commoners passed by.

Tonight, the Silk Garment Pavilion had a set of "Silk Brocade" for auction. Experts from all around the city were rushing over.

Wen Caishang kept a plain expression, hiding her tracks, not startling anyone, entering the Silk Garment Pavilion through the back door. She changed out of her cloth clothes and put on a new skirt. Her charm was as before, her hair bun adorned with a silver hairpin, stunningly beautiful.

She also took several hundred taels of silver.

She thought: "The Silk Garment Pavilion here has deep roots. If I were willing, I could really gather quite a few experts to escort us. But... how could these experts compare to Li Lang making me feel at ease?"

"These annoying characters should not disturb our mood. Hmph! Li Lang is not honest, mixing truth and falsehood to deceive even me."

The two traveled and played along the way, laboring and rushing. They stayed in poor inns, traveled on broken post roads... Li Xian refused to rob commoners and merchants, so he was short of money.

Wen Caishang picked out a jade robe for Li Xian. It looked noble and pleasing to the eye. Wen Caishang said: "This is my good man, truly handsome!"

She hugged and embraced him.

They played in Zhoucheng for several days, spending hundreds of taels of silver freely. Tasting fine cuisine, admiring beautiful scenery.

Having enjoyed themselves to the fullest, they did not forget to return to the estate. Li Xian bought a carriage and traveled along the official road. Tired of the crowds in the city, they took a secluded mountain path.

Inside the carriage, Li Xian rested his head on Wen Caishang’s lap, enjoying the beauty’s service.

This day, the carriage passed a fork in the road. A wooden sign stood in the middle: eastward was the mountain path, westward was the river path. Wen Caishang suddenly said: "Xiao Xian, entering Qiongtian Prefecture from Chongling Prefecture, it is best to travel by water."

Li Xian said: "Alright! I will look for a boat to board." He thought: "Once I return to the One Union Manor, I should depart."

Wen Caishang laughed: "Why go sit on a big boat? We can buy a small boat and sail down the river to reach our destination."

"Big boats have many people and are chaotic, so boring. We have no one to disturb us. We can prepare some paper, ink, and brush. I will teach you calligraphy and poetry. If you are tired, I will help you rub your shoulders and legs. Isn't that wonderful?"

Li Xian laughed: "How can I take advantage of you so? Then I... will also rub your shoulders and legs. I definitely cannot compare to you in poetry and songs, so I won't embarrass myself. But I know many interesting stories, and I will tell them to you one by one."

Wen Caishang laughed: "Great! Let's take a painted boat! Ordinary boats are smelly and dirty."

Along the river banks, there were many fishing boats. Buying a fishing boat would cost about ten taels of silver. Painted boats were mostly found in places like "Drunken Mist Pavilion" and "Painted Dream Tower," often used by nobles and officials for pleasure and indulgence.

They were rarely sold externally.

Li Xian said: "Makes sense! I will follow your wishes." He knew Wen Caishang spent money generously.

He pulled Wen Caishang over and played intimately with her for a while. Her hair fragrance drifted, her skin like frozen grease.

The charm here was enviable. They headed west and saw a wide river. There were ferries on the river bank.

Li Xian looked along the river and saw a city trace. He walked straight into the city, found a "Dream Fragrance Tower," and bluntly said he wanted to buy a painted boat. It had to be the most exquisite and sturdy. The madam looked at Li Xian’s young face but found his behavior strange; coming to a brothel to buy a "boat"?

She intended to raise the price. Li Xian offered a hundred taels in one sentence, shocking the madam into gaping, and she agreed to sell the painted boat. The madam said: "Sir, our painted boat is famous as one of the Fourteen Boats of the Red Light District. Anyone who boards it will be entranced..."

Li Xian paid the money crisply. The madam twisted her waist and led Li Xian into the back garden of the Dream Fragrance Tower. Beside a beautiful garden, several painted boats were docked, looking exquisite and smelling faintly fragrant.

The boat was not large, but the decoration was elegant. There were light gauze curtains... and some small, amusing utensils. Li Xian coughed a few times and threw all those things away.

Stepping onto the bow, they sailed out of the city river. Wen Caishang, with a graceful figure, lightly held up an oil-paper umbrella, waiting under a willow tree for a long time.

Seeing Li Xian stepping on the boat to greet her, she smiled charmingly and stepped onto the boat. Li Xian helped her into the cabin to rest.

The painted boat was eye-catching. The people on the banks kept stopping to look. They all said that a brothel painted boat was out on the river in broad daylight? Was it so shameless? Li Xian’s face turned red, but he thought: "My heart is bright. This boat is for travel. Why be embarrassed?"

He straightened his chest, neither ashamed nor proud, treating it as normal. The painted boat could only hold two people, but the layout was very delicate. On the deck, there were a "wooden zither" and a "table"... enough space for playing the zither and dancing with a sword.

Li Xian thought the remaining water journey would take a long time. As they sailed along the river, he glanced at the shops on both banks.

He saw a market selling fruits and vegetables. He called out loudly: "Please send some vegetables over." He secretly used internal Qi, sending his voice far away.

The market manager knew some martial arts and possessed internal Qi. Hearing the sound, he was startled, realizing instantly that Li Xian’s cultivation was formidable, and dared not neglect. He immediately ordered people to pack fruits and vegetables and chased along the bank by carriage.

Seeing Li Xian’s painted boat, he used Qi to ask: "Is it you who wants the vegetables?" Li Xian laughed: "It is!"

The manager grabbed the basket. He aimed at Li Xian and threw it heavily. This move was truly impressive. The painted boat was five zhang away from the bank, yet he threw the basket from a distance, and the fruits and vegetables inside did not spill at all.

Everyone looked.

Li Xian tapped with his fingers, catching the basket gently and placing it down. Low-key and unassuming, but martial artists all knew the difficulty within.

Treating the heavy as light, and the light as heavy.

Li Xian laughed: "Thanks for the help, brother." He picked up a silver ingot and casually threw it backward. The silver ingot plopped into the river.

The manager looked strange: "This..." Suddenly, he saw a whirlpool appear in the river water, exploding with a splash. The silver ingot flew out of the water, landing precisely in the manager’s palm.

The people on both banks gasped in surprise. The manager gripped the silver, which contained a strong internal Qi. He dared not neglect and bowed respectfully to see them off.

Wen Caishang scolded helplessly: "Always showing off." She lay sideways on the bed, lightly lifting the gauze curtain. She looked at the得意 (pleased) and laughing Li Xian.

"He is indeed a youth." Her eyes shone with a strange light, looking at him with joy.

The painted boat sailed on.

Li Xian saw a bookshop and remembered Wen Caishang wanted to teach him calligraphy and painting appreciation. He called out loudly again: "Trouble you, brother, to send me some calligraphy, painting, brushes, ink, and paper!"

The scholars in the bookshop knew no martial arts. They packed the calligraphy, painting, brushes, ink, and paper... but couldn't send it to the boat. Li Xian was about to dock the boat. His "Seven Star Steps" had achieved some success, but he was currently undergoing "Clear Ascending and Turbid Descending" and dared not be careless.

Suddenly, someone laughed: "I will help send it."

That Jianghu traveler was short and small, with small eyes, a wide mouth, sparse hair, and thin whiskers. He had noticed Li Xian long ago, seeing his unparalleled elegance, attracting the attention of pedestrians. Feeling jealous and resentful, he intended to make him look bad, crumpling the "calligraphy," "brushes and ink," and "paper" into a ball.

He threw it ruthlessly.

The surrounding people all gasped, feeling the traveler was malicious. Li Xian frowned and snorted coldly, his Green Silk Palm lightly slapping the river surface.

With a "rumble," thick splashes of water rose, swallowing the calligraphy ball. Not long after, the river surface turned black.

It turned out that the short traveler had infused internal Qi into the calligraphy ball. If Li Xian had caught it with his hands, he would have been splashed with ink all over his body.

The short traveler laughed triumphantly and slipped into the crowd to escape. Li Xian picked up a silver ingot and shot it out. It broke his leg bone, and he immediately heard his wailing and screaming.

Li Xian flicked a second pebble. The traveler used martial arts to block desperately. But the tiny silver ingot contained immense force, "pounding" and breaking his arm bone.

Li Xian said: "You ruined the calligraphy. Pay the shop owner, otherwise I will break your other limbs."

"Great Hero... Great Hero... I was wrong, I will pay right away." The traveler said obsequiously.

Li Xian snorted coldly, bought the calligraphy, brushes, ink, and paper again. The painted boat sailed away gracefully. Li Xian bought things carefully and spent money freely. It was a strange sight in the city.

Gradually leaving the city area, seeing fewer travelers, the painted boat entered the river from the canal.

Wen Caishang said helplessly: "You, sometimes you are very steady, and sometimes you have a child’s temper."

The river water flowed gently, the green grass hurried by.

Streets, shops, buildings, and pedestrians all disappeared.

The scenery on both banks was beautiful. The painted boat drifted in the middle of the river. Although the boat was small, the structure was very stable. There were "wind chimes" hanging in the room. The light wind blew, making a "ding-ding" sound.

Li Xian, leisurely and in high spirits, leaned on the boat railing. He moved his internal Qi, used the Green Silk Palm, and played with the green water of the river. He pushed the water back and forth, both increasing his understanding of the martial Dao and passing his leisure time.

He looked out at the river course.

As the painted boat sailed further away.

The river banks were very wide. Looking from the middle of the river to the sides, only a black line could be seen.

Gradually, the setting sun fell, fishing boats returned to the harbor, and no idle people disturbed. The two sat on the deck fishing, whispering.

They had now entered the territory of Qiongtian Prefecture.

Wen Caishang’s heart settled. She smelled the moisture in the air, dark clouds gathering, and闷雷 (muffled thunder) brewing. She knew the bad luck of the "Repeated Dragon Grass" was fading.

Night fell.

The river water was calm, the boat swayed gently.

Wen Caishang blew on a fire striker and lit the candle in the cabin. Beside the white jade table was an incense burner containing "incense" to repel mosquitoes and calm the mind, with a long-lasting fragrance.

Wen Caishang opened the window to confirm no one was on both sides. She suddenly said: "Xiao Xian, help me untie this ribbon."

Her robe was loose, the silk ribbon tied at her back. The candlelight shone, showing her charm naturally.

Li Xian’s hands were extremely skillful. With a light touch, it was already undone.

Wen Caishang said: "Xiao Xian, today I will teach you the third layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword. You should also take off your clothes."

Li Xian was stunned, thinking: "We are almost at Qiongtian Prefecture, I should depart. Teaching me the third layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword now, is it..."

Wen Caishang frowned: "You don't want to learn?"

The river wind blew the gauze curtains, the incense curled and didn't disperse, the candlelight shone. The space in the boat cabin was very small: a large bed, a table, and a bookshelf.

Li Xian suddenly realized: "A second-grade martial artist enters the water and dissolves. We are in the middle of the river, the banks are miles apart, vast as the sea. Although I have learned lightness skill... but even if I use all my strength, it is hard to cross to the bank. There is indeed nowhere to go."

In the pitch-black river, only a small boat with a single sail. The two sat opposite each other in the boat.

Li Xian said: "I am willing, of course I am willing to learn."

Wen Caishang said joyfully: "Good, very good." Her eyes rippled.

Wen Caishang thought: "The third layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword... no, the third layer of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword. You have already learned the first and second layers, and your attainments are much higher than mine. Now... I must teach you the third layer too."

"You learn this sword art, receive my true transmission, and you are my husband. We don't need to invite guests to a banquet. Hmph, the other men in this world are false-hearted, dirty and filthy, nothing good. I don't need their blessings."

"The two of us being good together is better than anything else."

The window was open.

However, the gauze curtains covered it, not revealing a bit of the charm. Li Xian’s expression was complex. Wen Caishang said softly: "Li Lang... come here." She held Li Xian’s hand and said: "I must thank you well. From today on, you are my husband, and I will treat you as my husband."

"I will teach you alchemy, teach you supreme martial arts, with no reservation... my clan's secrets, I can tell you. You... is that good?"

"You... if you have any requirements, I can satisfy them. In my life, I only treat you like this."

Her body seemed boneless, her skin like slippery jade. Her tone was charming and tender. By the end, she was pitiful and lovely.

Although Li Xian had plans to leave early, hearing Wen Caishang so deep in affection, so gentle and clinging, his heart inevitably wavered, imagining the life to come.

He was naturally romantic and blurted out: "If this is true, I would not trade it for an emperor of the world."

Wen Caishang said joyfully: "If you really think so, I... I am very happy."

Li Xian saw Wen Caishang’s flushed cheeks and suddenly came back to his senses. In this scene, speaking love words would only add to the chaos? He couldn't help but think: "The wife’s affection is so deep, must I really betray her? I... I am willing to be carefree under the sky, but this scene... surrounded by water, a solitary boat drifting, a beauty in my arms, how can I avoid it?"

He only wanted to return the favor. How could he know he was falling deeper into love. The entanglements of the Jianghu, how can they be cleared?

Li Xian knew it was hard to escape and said: "Wife, you don't need to do this..." Wen Caishang wrapped her arms around his neck and said: "Li Lang, you are unwilling?"

Li Xian said helplessly: "I am willing... of course I am willing." Wen Caishang said joyfully: "Good husband, obedient husband, handsome husband."

Her expression turned from a pout to a smile, saying: "Good husband... but I have requirements for you too."

Li Xian said: "Wife, please speak."

Wen Caishang said: "I need you... to never leave my side. You can only dream of me in your dreams. Don't look at other women. Don't deceive me again, don't bully me... asking you not to bully me is probably hard. How can you do it with that bad temper of yours. But... but don't deceive me anymore."

Li Xian found it really hard to agree, but seeing Wen Caishang’s deep affection, her gentle and lingering warmth entangled his heart and body. The words of refusal were hard to say. Chaos Mountain, Tiger Cry Ridge, Tomb Hidden Mountain... many dangerous and treacherous places, though life hung by a thread, there was always a way to escape. Only this time, in this tiny room, the map is rolled out and the dagger is revealed... where can he escape?

The soft sword is like honey, entangling the body, hard to avoid.

Li Xian could only say: "Alright, I will never deceive you, Wife."

Wen Caishang was overjoyed, her red lips saying: "Swear it." Li Xian hesitated. Wen Caishang continued: "You... you don't want to swear? Do you want to deceive again..."

Li Xian hurriedly said: "Alright, I swear, I will never deceive my wife. If I deceive her again, let me die a terrible death."

Wen Caishang breathed out like orchids, like fermented fragrant wine, mellow and drinkable, saying: "Since that is so... my good husband, obedient husband, the third layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword is named 'Uniting the Sword and Returning to the Scabbard'... I will pass the cultivation method to you."

Li Xian nodded: "Alright."

Wen Caishang leaned close and whispered, pouring out the essence of the third layer. Uniting the Sword and Returning to the Scabbard... meaning that in this layer, "intent" is the priority, "sword" is secondary.

It is the beginning of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword entering the path of Yin and Yang from the path of emotion.

Li Xian sat cross-legged and meditated. Seeing Wen Caishang’s fierce approach, emotional threads wrapped around him. He tried his best to think of more possibilities.

But the danger of this situation... there was nowhere to hide, nowhere to conceal. Wen Caishang’s thoughts were extremely meticulous; a small net of heaven and earth was laid, how could it compare to the likes of Su Qiuwu.

Wen Caishang was arrogant in nature, but she was also overwhelmed by emotion. The third layer of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword focused mostly on internal cultivation, with fewer sword moves.

Wen Caishang said: "Husband, with your talent, you should understand clearly by now."

Li Xian nodded: "I understand clearly. Please give me more guidance, Wife."

The river water flowed swiftly, the painted boat drifted.

The next day.

The wooden window of the painted boat was open.

The spring wind blew last night. It made the whole room a mess, and then quietly felt the warmth here. Her fingers gently pinched the red mole on Li Xian’s eyebrows, then pinched his nose, and grabbed his ears. These eyes, this nose, after the storm of last night, she was even more curious and interested.

How can emotion and desire be separated. She had just tasted the beauty of "Yin-Yang blending." Her emotions and desires were both strong. The dignified and reserved elegance she usually maintained was completely gone.

"Good husband, you are awake?" She smiled softly.

Li Xian casually grabbed the jade robe to cover his body and teased: "Wife, you last night... really opened my eyes."

Wen Caishang lightly waved, tossing the jade robe to the ground, acting shy: "You dare to laugh at me? You husband, you said just yesterday you wouldn't bully me. So soon, and you..."

Li Xian said: "I don't bully my wife, I only dote on my wife."

They played around like this for a while.

The dark clouds gradually dispersed, the heavy rain turned to a drizzle. The painted boat was far from the bustling city, sailing into a green wilderness of mountains. The river course was very narrow, only ten zhang左右 (left and right). The trees were lush, the scenery was serene.

Li Xian’s original Yang was full, his pure Yang body perfect, his remaining strength abundant. But he had actually been fighting for several hours, and seeing occasional ferries passing by, he rested for a moment. Sitting on the bow to enjoy the river scenery.

Wen Caishang wore a simple robe, the loose clothing couldn't cover her curves. She sat on the wooden zither and laughed: "Li Lang, I will play the zither for you." She was knowledgeable and very skilled in arts. Music, chess, calligraphy, painting, poetry, and songs—none of them were lacking.

She was even more familiar with romantic and elegant affairs.

Her fingers lightly plucked the strings.

The sound of the zither was melodious, carrying tender affection. It was as gentle as flowing water, lingering in people's hearts, making their minds drift with the music, endless longing, unwilling to return to reality for a long time.

But if listened closely, there was a hidden worry. Li Xian’s understanding of music was shallow, he had never even touched it. His mind was not as delicate as a woman's. In weighing benefits, he did not lose to his wife, but in appreciating music and touching the zither, he was far inferior.

He followed the rhythm, tapping his feet lightly.

Suddenly, he saw birds from the forests on both banks flying over at the sound, landing on the edge of the painted boat, chirping and bustling, very lively.

This tune she played was "Birds in the Forest" composed by the 'Yellow Music Master' of the Great Wu Dynasty. Great Wu scholars and poets had all heard of it. Some aristocratic families had strict requirements for their descendants. They not only had to achieve success in martial arts but also master music and songs. This tune was a wonderful piece to test the depth of one's attainments in music.

The sheet music was not difficult.

Those who had practiced for three years could play the tune. But the emphasis, tempo, string plucking techniques, and blending emotion into the zither... required a lifetime of immersion.

To attract forest birds to play joyfully like this, the depth of attainment is astonishing. If met by a music lover, they would be willing to pay a thousand gold for a tune to play along.

But Li Xian could enjoy it alone. If there were others, they would surely be envious. When the tune ended, Li Xian applauded: "Wife, you are truly amazing!"

Wen Caishang said with charm: "My amazing places are much more. The mere zither path, I am not considered skilled. My calligraphy and painting attainments are barely passable."

Li Xian laughed: "Are there any paintings or calligraphy by you in the market?" Wen Caishang said: "I write and paint solely for self-cultivation. I never sell my works. Besides, do you think I need to sell calligraphy and paintings to make a living?"

Li Xian said: "Wife, you said you would teach me calligraphy appreciation and teach me calligraphy." Wen Caishang lightly tapped with her finger and smiled: "Good husband, how could I be unwilling to teach you?"

Then they walked hand in hand into the room.

They扶起 (lifted) the overturned jade table and spread out the hemp paper. The paper was rough, but bought in a hurry, it was considered good.

Wen Caishang carefully ground the ink, dipped the brush in ink, and wrote freely. Her brushwork was profound, with a heroic air of a woman commanding the rivers and mountains. Various styles came easily. But the bedroom was narrow; how could she truly teach? Even if Li Xian wanted to learn, in this scene... the ink and brush could only be wasted.

Wen Caishang suddenly frowned, her composition was disrupted, the characters were crooked, barely formed.

It turned into another kind of instruction. Li Xian still remembered the past grudge of the sword stab.

The wind chimes swayed gently.

When they came to their senses, the sky was dark, and another day had passed. Wen Caishang lay横躺 (horizontally) on the bed, her gaze wandering, looking at the green river water.

Li Xian examined the calligraphy and teased: "It seems the wife's calligraphy and painting skills are not that great."

The first two characters showed deep skill, but the following ten or so characters were rough in pen control, chaotic in composition, enduring humiliation... as if written under great interference. Wen Caishang’s pretty face turned red, snatched the calligraphy, hid it in her sleeve, and it vanished into thin air.

Li Xian said: "The calligraphy is done."

"Please teach me painting, Wife."

Wen Caishang knew Li Xian was actually a wild character. He used to respect her and never offended her. But once the precedent was set, it was terrible.

She pouted: "If you act up again, how can I teach you?"

Li Xian said: "Wife, are you afraid?" Wen Caishang said: "Am I afraid of you, stinky boy?"

Though embarrassed, she couldn't say she didn't like it. She spread the rice paper again, pressed the four corners, dipped the brush in ink, and painted spontaneously.

The candlelight flickered, the wind chimes rang clearly.

Early summer, the spring wind was still strong, blowing the rice paper askew, and the swaying of the painted boat made it always look like the characters weren't characters, and the painting wasn't a painting.

Seven days passed in a flash.

The two collaborated on more than ten paintings and more than ten calligraphies.

Wen Caishang said softly: "Good husband, help me dress."

Li Xian took care of her meticulously. The clothes were neat, but one boot was missing. It had fallen into the river at some point and washed away by the current.

Wen Caishang glared at Li Xian. This boy had real brute strength; he really used it.

She smoothed her long hair, picked up the silver hairpin from the ground, and pinned it into her bun. Her eyebrows relaxed, and it was hard to find the indifference of the past. Beyond her noble air, she added more charm.

After the storm, it was rare to have peace.

Wen Caishang glanced at the calligraphy and painting, recalling many embarrassing scenes. She couldn't help pushing Li Xian. Scolding him for not learning well, coming up with all sorts of bad ideas. He was the one who wanted to learn calligraphy and painting, and he was also the one who caused trouble.

The seven-day trial was over, but the two were alone on the boat, so there was not much difference. They hugged each other every day and slept together every night.

The river flowed ceaselessly, the boat sailed on.

That night.

The painted boat drifted to "Fanyu Prefecture" in Qiongtian Prefecture. In the distance, there was a "Daqing City," with dim lights, vaguely visible.

The painted boat drifted among the reeds. The current here was very slow, and frogs were noisy.

Wen Caishang ground ink and burned incense, teaching Li Xian to write. Although Li Xian was wild and indulgent, he was smart and clever, plus 'Heaven rewards the diligent', his imitation of calligraphy and painting improved rapidly.

Wen Caishang said: "The various paths in the world have principles that connect."

"Your calligraphy has a very strong start, but the brush strokes are too sharp. The transitions and connections are not soft enough, and the handling is not mature. The ancients said 'seeing the character is like seeing the person', just like 'seeing the martial art is like seeing the person'. The path of calligraphy requires people to see some clues from the characters. But it cannot be seen through at a glance."

[Skill: Calligraphy]
[Proficiency: 156/500 Beginner]
[Skill: Painting]
[Proficiency: 236/500 Beginner]

Suddenly, a "plop" was heard from outside the boat.

Li Xian said: "Who!" He stopped writing and went out, looking into the dark. The surroundings were dense reeds, taller than a person.

A few zhang away in the darkness, water splashed, and voices were faintly heard.

Li Xian knew someone had fallen into the water. The river water here was muddy. If it poured into the nose and mouth, it would be hard to make a sound. He took out the "Silk Thread Green Jade Rope" from his sleeve bag and threw it at the splashes.

The rope had deep strength, wrapping around the flailing arm in the water, and pulled hard.

With a "plop," a figure was pulled out of the water and landed on the deck of the painted boat. It was a woman, wet all over, but her clothes were still neat.

Li Xian lightly patted her back, secretly using internal Qi to push. The污水 (dirty water) in the woman's lungs was instantly spat out. She felt much better and gasped for breath.

Wen Caishang was slightly annoyed, but she loved Li Xian deeply, so she didn't say much.

The woman coughed heavily a few times and said: "Benefactor... Benefactor, thank you for saving my life!" She knelt and bowed repeatedly, extremely grateful. Wen Caishang said: "Raise your head."

The woman raised her head. Wen Caishang’s sleeve sword unsheathed, cutting away the hair covering her face. Seeing her face was clear and pretty, with a bit of charm, she said: "You are fine now, swim back by yourself."

The woman hurriedly said: "Benefactor... I... I don't know how to swim. Please, good man, do good to the end and send me back to the shore. I will surely repay you well, I will do anything."

Wen Caishang said coldly: "Hmph, you common woman, who wants your repayment?" She glanced at Li Xian.

Li Xian said: "Miss, this place is very remote. Why did you fall into the water here?"

The woman looked at Wen Caishang tremblingly, feeling scared, and moved closer to Li Xian, saying: "Speaking of this matter, it... it was all that heartless man's doing!" Saying this, sorrow welled up.

Wen Caishang was annoyed that this woman appeared suddenly and disturbed their mood. But killing her with one sword would stain the deck and ruin the mood. She was afraid Li Xian would be angry, so although she was extremely displeased, she did not make a move to finish her.

Hearing her say "heartless man," she figured it was a love-hate entanglement. She had no interest in it, but it didn't hurt to listen.

She sat on the wooden table, showing her charm fully. Li Xian, curious, asked about the cause.

This woman was originally from a wealthy family in Daqing City. She was raised delicately from childhood, safe and happy. But her family had few descendants, no sons for a long time.

The woman had reached the age of marriage. She pitied her elderly parents, fearing no one would care for them. So she wanted to招女婿 (招赘), to not leave home.

Because the family had considerable money and property, the news was released, and many young talents came to choose. The woman was pretty and had a quiet personality, making her even more popular.

The woman thought: "If I choose a young and handsome man, they will attract bees and butterflies. As a weak woman, I will inevitably suffer. If I choose a rich family, they are shrewd and calculating. My family has few servants, how can I handle it? Only by choosing an ordinary person, easy to control, can I live a stable life."

So among the many young talents, she chose Zhang Dajiang, who looked ordinary, as her husband. They were married for several years, and the days were stable. Although Zhang Dajiang was lazy, he was generally honest and stable.

But as time passed. The old parents' health declined, and they couldn't manage the household. They handed over the industry and land... to Zhang Dajiang to manage.

Zhang Dajiang gradually revealed his true nature, secretly taking rent money to visit brothels and gamble. The old parents were powerless, so they turned a blind eye.

Who knew that Zhang Dajiang became more and more arrogant, no longer hiding it. The old parents were angry and argued with Zhang Dajiang. They were old, and Zhang Dajiang rambled nonsense, making them so angry their eyes rolled back, and they died on the spot.

The woman deeply regretted her decision and sued Zhang Dajiang in the yamen. Zhang Dajiang colluded with the county magistrate. He falsely accused her of being unchaste and being the one who angered her parents to death.

In court, he gave her a divorce paper.

Then he took all the family property. The woman was furious and went to argue with Zhang Dajiang tonight. Zhang Dajiang, in a fit of cruelty, knocked her unconscious on the spot.

He transported her by boat to this place and threw her into the river to escape.

Fortunately, Li Xian and Wen Caishang were nearby and saved her. Li Xian heard her tragic family history and thought of his younger brother and himself. Two great men, in this world, were still bullied to the point of being barely clothed.

Let alone a lonely, helpless woman. Li Xian was about to speak when Wen Caishang said: "Xiao Xian, this kind of man is useless alive. Help her get revenge."

Li Xian was surprised: "Wife... you are..."

Wen Caishang heard the woman describe her tragic situation and her thoughts were chaotic; she really associated it with herself.

That Zhang Dajiang could not be compared to Li Xian. But Wen Caishang cultivated Li Xian precisely because she saw his clean background and no threat.

"Li Xian in danger, never leaving or abandoning me, fighting desperately to protect me. How can men in the world compare to him? The likes of Zhang Dajiang... compared to my Li Lang, are not even fit to carry his shoes."

"But Li Lang is really a romantic man. In my life, I have never had my emotions stirred by someone like this. I love him deeply, but he... he has this romantic nature."

"In the past, I could control him. But now... Li Lang’s talent is unparalleled, Pupil Physique, Perfect Physique... all added to him. It is only a matter of time before his strength surpasses mine. Then all the莺莺燕燕 (pretty girls), will fly towards him."

"My looks, I am not afraid of course. But... Ao Mo said he is romantic, and I think he is quite romantic. At that time... I... I will be no different from this woman. Although Li Lang will love and protect me, but... but I always hope his eyes can only see me."

"Only see me, so I will only look at him. The other people in the world, it would be fine if they all disappeared."

She loved Li Xian’s talent, but also feared Li Xian’s talent. This worry was deeply buried in her heart since Li Xian revealed his Pupil Physique.

Between hope and fear, the worry grew heavier. After the "Seven-Day Trial," they were inseparable, happy every day... Wen Caishang’s dam burst, and she couldn't part with this affection. The more precious it was to obtain, the more she feared losing it.

She didn't think too much during the joy.

But after hearing the woman who fell into the water, she couldn't help but fantasize. She leaned towards Li Xian and held his hand.

Li Xian said: "That Zhang Dajiang is indeed worth killing. You suffered by falling into the water, this should not be false. Since the wife has spoken, I will help you settle it."

The woman said joyfully: "Good, good, thank you, Benefactor, thank you, Benefactor. I... I have a request. Please let that villain see me one last time before he dies."

Li Xian said loudly: "Of course, no problem." He sighed and said: "A woman like you, I really admire."

The woman mocked herself: "I recognized a bad person and harmed my whole family. What is there to admire?"

Li Xian said: "Not so."

"It's hard to know a person's heart by their face. Not recognizing a person well cannot be entirely your fault. That Zhang Dajiang killed your parents. You dared to stand up for your father, you are already a heroine. How many people, facing this situation, are in a dilemma, and finally muddle along."

"So I admire you. I, Li Xian, do not claim to be a great philanthropist, but if there is an injustice, I will help as appropriate."

"Besides, the wife has spoken, please rest assured."

Li Xian looked at Wen Caishang, holding her hand, his actions intimate.

The woman said emotionally: "Benefactor... you saved my life, I am really... really grateful to you!"

Li Xian laughed: "Just a small effort. Get up. I will dock the boat and help you punish that villain."

Wen Caishang’s heart wavered, her soft body leaning against him, but she thought: "My husband is really romantic. His temper is very good, easy-going and kind... but the more such a temper, the more it makes me uneasy. You help like this, how can this woman forget you? You talk to her like this, how many lifetimes can she cultivate such good fortune?"

She secretly made a decision: "I... I must finally think of a way. To make you stay by my side."
