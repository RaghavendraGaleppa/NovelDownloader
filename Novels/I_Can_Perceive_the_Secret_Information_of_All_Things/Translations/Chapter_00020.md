# Chapter 20: The Way to Wealth  

The rumors spread by the Tu family about Yuanshen Temple, with Song Yuanbao's help, quickly circulated and became a hot topic of conversation for days.  

However, the temple's incense offerings didn't flourish as a result.  

The people knew all too well that the temple's popularity wasn't about reputation—what truly mattered was whether it was effective, and Yuanshen Temple simply wasn't.  

Still, there was some change. Every now and then, people would visit—not to burn incense, but to seek Xiao Ji's help with childbirth. News of the Lu family's successful birth had spread far and wide.  

Xiao Ji was far from pleased. He wasn't a midwife, and as a man, he naturally had no interest in specializing in such work, so he refused most requests.  

Over the next few days, Xiao Ji shuttled between Yuanshen Temple and the notice board, carefully studying potential collaborations with the local authorities.  

The cases posted on the board were categorized by difficulty, with higher-level cases offering greater rewards.  

According to Song Yuanbao, three thousand taels of silver could be exchanged for a single low-grade Yellow-tier spirit stone. To accumulate enough spirit stones for his journey to Taigu City, Xiao Ji needed at least fifty to sixty thousand taels—no small sum.  

For ordinary folk, a few hundred taels could sustain them comfortably for years. Such a vast amount was practically astronomical.  

But for a proper cultivator, spirit stones were essential currency.  

After some quick calculations, Xiao Ji determined that a round-trip ticket on a floating vessel to Taigu City would cost at least ten spirit stones. Once there, he’d need to find the fragments of the four-stringed pipa—according to the information he’d obtained, the artifact was lying in a "Two-Stone Shop."  

As the name suggested, a Two-Stone Shop was akin to a "two-dollar store" from his past life, where everything cost two spirit stones. That alone would add up to twelve spirit stones.  

He also wanted to purchase a storage artifact—nothing fancy, just something functional. Though he’d never seen one before, he estimated it would cost no less than ten spirit stones.  

Adding it all up, he needed at least twenty-two spirit stones.  

One spirit stone equaled three thousand taels. Three thousand multiplied by twenty-two… Xiao Ji sat cross-legged on the meditation mat in the main hall, counting on his fingers.  

"Sixty-six thousand taels," the answer formed in his mind. "What a nightmare."  

Although the notice board in Willow Town regularly posted cases, the highest reward offered was only five thousand taels—and that was a rare exception. Most cases offered just a few hundred taels.  

To gather sixty-six thousand taels quickly enough to exchange for spirit stones, he’d need a meticulous plan.  

The rewards listed weren’t always fixed, either. Many cases—such as missing persons or murders—involved wealthy families who might privately increase the bounty.  

Xiao Ji decided to focus on these cases with additional rewards.  

With a clear goal in mind, his mood brightened considerably.  

"Should I hold the broom with my left hand on top or my right? And if I’m sweeping fallen branches from the tree, are there any special techniques I should know?"  

Ying Xiao walked into the main hall carrying a broom, posing what seemed like a profound question. Her expression suggested she was entirely serious.  

Given her background as the Third Princess, it made sense that she had no experience with menial labor.  

"You might not be suited for rough work," Xiao Ji said, recalling how she’d shattered plates and bowls while washing dishes the night before. "Let me think about what you *are* good at. Stop sweeping—I’m afraid you’ll end up clearing the roof tiles next."  

"I’ve been thinking about my future these past few days," Ying Xiao said, setting the broom aside and sitting cross-legged beside him. "I believe I have a talent for governance. For example, given our temple’s lack of incense offerings, I have ideas to improve the situation—to *govern* Yuanshen Temple."  

"Go on," Xiao Ji said, choosing to listen rather than probe her thoughts.  

"First, we must address the core issue: in the hearts of Willow Town’s people, Yuanshen Temple is ineffective," Ying Xiao explained, resting her chin on one hand. "But we *do* have a marketable skill."  

"Skill?" Xiao Ji feigned surprise.  

"Exactly—childbirth. Your success at the Lu residence has spread throughout Willow Town. People keep coming to you for help with deliveries. We should capitalize on this and rebrand Yuanshen Temple as the *Childbirth Temple*. Later, we can expand into a *Fertility Temple*. The incense will surely flourish!"  

What an absurd idea.  

"Just focus on learning how to sweep," Xiao Ji sighed, hoping the princess would stop brainstorming.  

"Ah, you’re both here," Liu Haizhu said as he stepped inside, his breath visible in the cold air. "I beat Old Liu in three games of chess this morning. Make sure there’s meat for lunch."  

"Come, girl, let me tell you—"  

Seeing his master in such high spirits, Xiao Ji hesitated to interrupt. But then he remembered the spirit stones.  

"Master," he cut in, "I recall you once mentioning that Yuanshen Temple had plenty of spirit stones. Where are they? I’d like to use some for a trip to Taigu City—to broaden my horizons."  

Liu Haizhu settled into his rocking chair, thinking for a moment. "I forgot. I’ll pass them to you once I find them."  

Spirit stones were valuable, but surely not *inheritance*-level important… Xiao Ji decided to search for them himself.  

Half an hour later, he found two low-grade Yellow-tier spirit stones in his master’s room.  

Two stones meant six thousand taels less to worry about—a small but welcome relief.  

The rest would have to come from his work with the authorities.  

A few days later, after thoroughly reviewing the cases on the notice board, Xiao Ji set aside those requiring long-distance travel or extended investigations. He focused instead on cases where he could provide leads or make arrests within Willow Town.  

Some cases yielded clues just from the records, while others required on-site visits.  

###  

In winter, nothing paired better than a stove and wine.  

As the chief constable, Song Yuanbao had his own duty room. He had just risen from his bed and was warming a pot of wine when a knock came at the door.  

"Sir, Daoist Xiao is here," his subordinate reported.  

"Let him in," Song Yuanbao said, his attitude toward Xiao Ji having shifted considerably.  

A skilled Daoist was worth a hundred frauds.  

These days, the martial world teemed with charlatans. Of the thirty-two cultivation sects around Willow Town, only a handful had any real ability. True sects wouldn’t rely on mundane towns for survival.  

But exceptions existed—like Yuanshen Temple, which now housed a genuine spellcaster.  

Such a figure was worth cultivating. If Daoist Xiao ever rose to become a grand mage, Song Yuanbao’s fortunes would soar alongside his.  

In this world, no official could thrive without powerful allies.  

As footsteps approached, Song Yuanbao straightened his robes and waited.  

The moment Xiao Ji stepped inside, he spoke:  

"I’m here to report a crime."
