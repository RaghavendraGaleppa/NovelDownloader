# Chapter 70: Boarding the Dragonfang Treasure Ship Again  

Gu Yuan hadn't expected there to be such a reward behind this.  

Owning a spiritual peak would indeed provide immense assistance to his cultivation.  

Although it was only a first-grade upper-tier spiritual land's output, it was more than enough for a Qi Refinement cultivator.  

After all, not every sect could be as extravagant as the Qingfeng Dao Academy, allowing Qi Refinement disciples to cultivate on second-grade spiritual islands.  

Moreover, even academy disciples could only cultivate there—they couldn’t claim the island’s resources.  

Though Gu Yuan felt his heart stir with excitement, he remained calm and asked rationally, "May I ask, Senior Brother, how many spirit stones would the annual output of such a spiritual peak amount to?"  

"The 108 peaks vary in spiritual energy and output. The lower-grade ones yield barely over a hundred stones a year, while the highest-grade ones might exceed four hundred," Qiu Mingshan replied after a brief pause.  

Four hundred spirit stones might not seem like much at first glance, but that was just one year’s output.  

Considering that a top-grade magical artifact cost just over four hundred spirit stones, owning such a peak meant earning enough in a year to purchase one—a staggering fortune.  

No wonder even Qiu Mingshan urged Gu Yuan to participate.  

Securing a spiritual peak would guarantee a stable path for cultivation.  

"However, the highest-grade peaks will likely be beyond your reach. You’re only at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement, and the academy’s campaigns are open to all disciples regardless of cultivation level. The best peaks will naturally be dominated by ninth-layer Qi Refinement disciples."  

"Moreover, since this involves spiritual peaks—a tremendous source of wealth—many disciples will participate, including seasoned ninth-layer seniors who’ve hit bottlenecks. The competition will be fierce!"  

"Many aristocratic disciples will also join the fray."  

"But with the backing of an elder, you should still have a fighting chance for any peak below the highest grade."  

"Let me share a trick with you—one I used in my younger days..."  

After his warning, Qiu Mingshan suddenly grinned.  

"Please enlighten me, Senior Brother," Gu Yuan immediately clasped his hands in respect.  

"The resources of a single peak are limited, but if you combine two..."  

Qiu Mingshan chuckled. "You can first plunder one peak without claiming it, then at the last moment, occupy another. That way, you can seize more resources—enough to earn a fortune before the campaign even ends."  

"However, you must be extremely careful with this method. It might provoke others and lead to being besieged, leaving you with nothing in the end."  

"But you’ve always been clever. I trust you’ll know how to handle it, so I won’t lecture you further."  

---  

"Senior Brother’s thoughts align perfectly with mine!"  

Gu Yuan and Qiu Mingshan exchanged a glance before both burst into laughter.  

---  

"Claiming a spiritual peak, huh..."  

After exchanging a few more pleasantries with Qiu Mingshan, Gu Yuan left the Personnel Hall and gazed at the heavy snowfall outside Qing Shan Peak, his resolve firm.  

If he didn’t answer the summons, he’d lose seven hundred spirit stones for nothing.  

But if he participated, he might secure a spiritual peak.  

The difference in wealth was staggering.  

Among his peers, he was currently one of the wealthiest. But if he backed down now, everything could change.  

"Perfect timing—the one-month cooldown for the Stone Liquid has passed. I’ll save this use to scout Feilang Mountain and identify the peak with the greatest opportunities."  

"If I don’t compete, so be it. But if I do, I must ensure absolute certainty of success!"  

Gu Yuan rubbed the bulging storage pouch at his waist and smirked before summoning his jade shuttle and flying toward the market.  

With three days left before the academy’s assembly, he had enough time to further enhance his combat prowess.

**Boom!**  

**Boom!**  

**Boom!**  

The massive plaza was crowded with cultivators. Towering golden-armored giants raised enormous jade hammers, striking colossal drums and producing deep, resonant booms.  

Nine massive Dragonfang Treasure Ships stood in formation, flanked by black-and-white spirit cranes soaring through the air.  

At the front of the Hidden Dragon Hall, Zhou Qisheng, the dean of the Hidden Dragon Academy, swept his sharp gaze across the crowd and declared coldly:  

"For a thousand years, the demonic beasts of Feilang Mountain’s 108 peaks have occupied our academy’s spiritual lands—defiant, ungrateful, and repeatedly raiding our borders, plundering passing spirit ships."  

"Thus, by the decree of the academy, Qi Refinement disciples are hereby dispatched to reclaim Feilang Mountain, eradicate the scourge of the spiritual ranges, and restore our territory."  

"All spoils from this campaign belong to the participating disciples. Those who seize a peak, subdue its demons, and plant the formation disk shall retain its output until they reach Foundation Establishment."  

"Time is of the essence. Set forth at once and uphold the academy’s might!"  

Zhou Qisheng’s words aligned perfectly with Qiu Mingshan’s earlier explanation—the academy was offering an immense opportunity.  

Victors would advance swiftly, their resources secured.  

A murmur spread through the crowd. Some had known this beforehand, while others were only now learning of it.  

But it was too late to back out. Under Zhou Qisheng’s stern gaze, the disciples received their formation disks according to cultivation level and boarded the Dragonfang Treasure Ships.  

This time, aristocratic disciples were also boarding the ships.  

---  

The previous campaign at Yunya Shell Fields had been an academy trial—a compensatory measure for common-born disciples to earn shell jade and improve their cultivation.  

This time, it was an all-out competition.  

The only exceptions were core disciples or those from core aristocratic families.  

Such individuals had no need to compete for Qi Refinement resources.  

A mere first-grade spiritual peak was beneath their notice.  

The so-called bottlenecks of Qi Refinement were trivial to them.  

---  

When Gu Yuan boarded the seventh Dragonfang Treasure Ship, over a dozen cultivators were already aboard—all at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement.  

Another twenty or so joined afterward, bringing the total to over forty.  

This was a larger number than when Gu Yuan had first boarded a Dragonfang Treasure Ship at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement.  

Now, aristocratic disciples were also present, creating a stark divide.  

Though they wore the standard academy robes, theirs were clearly modified—more intricate in design, with their family crests embroidered on the sleeves.  

These aristocratic families were mostly intermarried and thus familiar with one another. They gathered in lively conversation, laughing and chatting.  

On the other side stood the common-born disciples in plain standard robes.  

Even among them, distinctions existed. Some had already secured mentors, carrying themselves with greater confidence as they mingled in their own circles.  

The rest formed smaller groups based on personal connections.  

One particular group stood out, drawing glances from both aristocratic and common-born disciples alike.  

Gu Yuan couldn’t help but look as well.  

Among them was an exceptionally beautiful woman—tall, fair-skinned, her curves accentuated even by the loose academy robes.  

She was chatting with two other female cultivators, her smile radiant and captivating.  

One aristocratic disciple seemed unable to resist and called out:  

"Junior Sister Yun, the demonic beasts of Feilang Mountain are numerous. Why not join forces with us?"
