# Chapter 90: Reunion with Zhang Yangchu

Outside the secret realm, the various institute heads and pavilion masters remained seated on their meditation cushions, none having left. Some sat with eyes slightly closed as if cultivating, while others stared intently at the Spiritual Essence Ranking unfurled in midair, their expressions tinged with concern. A few engaged in casual conversation.

"Ha! Fellow Daoist Wu, I heard your Thousand Methods Pavilion has already decided on the next chief disciple for the inner court. And the lad insists on pursuing the True Dharma path?" teased the ruddy-faced elder who had spoken first.

The goat-bearded pavilion master chuckled awkwardly in response. "Youngsters don't know any better. Yuanming will make him change his mind."

Inside the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven:

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing, I'm Senior Brother You Yuanming. Have you heard of me?" A dark-skinned man dressed in simple robes approached Zhang Jing with a warm smile.

"Senior Brother You?" Zhang Jing blinked in surprise before quickly composing himself. "Zhang Jing pays his respects to Senior Brother!"

As he spoke, Zhang Jing studied the man before him. One of the two purple-robed figures who had been standing with the institute heads earlier was indeed this person.

Truth be told, Zhang Jing was surprised. Senior Brother You gave an extremely ordinary first impression—the type who would disappear in a crowd. Yet his strength was undeniable. Though they currently shared the same cultivation level, Senior Brother You gave him a terrifying, spine-chilling sensation—as if crushing Zhang Jing would be no harder than squashing an ant.

"So this is what it means to be ranked on the True Spirit Ranking," Zhang Jing thought with awe.

"Please, no need for formalities," Senior Brother You said gently, his voice carrying a hint of rustic honesty. "I came to share a few words of advice."

"Senior Brother, please speak freely," Zhang Jing replied earnestly.

"Then I'll be direct. I know you're still committed to the True Dharma path—that's fine. But I want to remind you to better recognize your own talents. Your aptitude for formation talismans is truly remarkable, which gives you a safety net if you pursue the True Dharma path."

"In this Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven, you should attempt to comprehend Dao Intent with all your might. If you succeed, I'll have nothing more to say. But if not, I hope you'll seriously consider formation talismans. That's all I'll say—the choice is yours."

"Also, when you have time, take a look at the Spiritual Essence Ranking. The formation talisman path is truly powerful!" Senior Brother You's face radiated confidence.

"Zhang Jing has learned much. Thank you for your guidance." Zhang Jing bowed respectfully. Though with the Dao-Guiding Spiritual Light, he was nearly certain of comprehending Dao Intent, he appreciated Senior Brother You's well-meaning advice. There was no need to argue—when he successfully comprehended Dao Intent, the truth would become evident.

"Excellent." Seeing Zhang Jing's sincere attitude, Senior Brother You nodded approvingly before adding, "One more thing—if possible, strive to reach the highest layers of the Void Heaven you can. The higher the layer, the greater the opportunities."

"Understood. Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother."

Nearby, Qin Nian glanced at Zhang Jing from the corner of her eye. She had considered greeting him but held back when she saw Senior Brother You approach him directly. This only reinforced her conviction: "Senior Brother was right—this Junior Brother Zhang Jing is extraordinary. He might be my greatest obstacle in claiming the top ranking among all outer court disciples of the three institutes."

Taking a deep breath, Qin Nian strode resolutely toward the Stairway to Heaven. She had no interest in lingering in the First Void Heaven.

As time passed, most inner court disciples had already ascended the Stairway to Heaven, causing the Spiritual Essence Ranking to flicker wildly. Having rested sufficiently, Zhang Jing prepared to attempt the stairs himself when a voice called out from behind.

"Senior Brother Zhang."

Turning, he saw it was Senior Brother Zhang Yangchu. The form of address made Zhang Jing's expression turn slightly awkward. "Senior Brother Yangchu, you're mocking me with that title."

Relieved to see Zhang Jing's unchanged attitude, Zhang Yangchu smiled. "Senior Brother Zhang, we must follow the institute's rules. Before coming here, Senior Brother Li told me your cultivation is comparable to his now, so addressing you as senior brother is proper."

"Ah..." Seeing he couldn't persuade him otherwise, Zhang Jing sighed. "Fine then, Senior Brother Yangchu—let's each use our own form of address."

"As you say, Senior Brother! I arrived late and missed you outside. When I finally saw you here, I wanted to greet you, but then Senior Brother You came over first," Zhang Yangchu explained with a smile.

As he looked at Zhang Jing's youthful face and reflected on his meteoric rise since joining the institute, Zhang Yangchu couldn't help but marvel. Thank heavens he'd been decisive and firm when recruiting Zhang Jing into the Luodu team—otherwise, he'd never have gained entry to the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven.

Indeed, Zhang Yangchu's presence here was entirely due to the abundant cultivation resources Senior Brother Li had rewarded him for successfully recruiting Zhang Jing, allowing him to reach the tenth level of Qi Refinement just half a month before the Void Heaven opened.

"I see," Zhang Jing replied with an understanding smile. "Have you tried the Stairway to Heaven yet, Senior Brother Yangchu?"

Shaking his head, Zhang Yangchu admitted with a wry smile, "To be honest, I stumbled upon a spirit beast earlier. I barely managed to kill it after exhausting myself, and only gained one point of spiritual essence. The Stairway to Heaven is beyond me."

"What will you do now?" Zhang Jing asked with concern. He wasn't surprised by Zhang Yangchu's situation—the Myriad Spirits Minor Void Heaven was designed for Foundation Establishment cultivators, so its challenges were naturally formidable. The gap between cultivators of the same level with and without Dao Rhyme was vast, let alone compared to the profound mysteries of a Dao Foundation connecting with cosmic principles.

"I'll stay here hunting spirit beasts to accumulate essence, hoping to exchange for something decent from the Myriad Spirits Treasure House before leaving," Zhang Yangchu said cheerfully.

"Then take care, Senior Brother Yangchu. I'll go try the Stairway to Heaven now."

"Safe journey, Senior Brother."

At the base of the Stairway to Heaven, only outer court disciples from the three institutes remained. Chen Xiandao descended the stairs with a pale face, drawing disappointed looks from his Longhu Institute peers.

"How did you do?" Shen Qingqing asked urgently.

"The seventh step," he replied bitterly.

Beside them, a disciple from Xuanguang Institute said smugly, "Don't feel bad—you've only cultivated for two years. It's normal that you can't compare to the top senior brothers and sisters from our Xuanguang and Shenxiao Institutes." He was intently studying the Spiritual Essence Ranking while jotting down notes.

"Senior Brother, what are you doing?" Shen Qingqing asked curiously.

"Compiling a ranking of outer court geniuses, of course!" the disciple answered cheerfully.

Just then, a familiar figure caught Shen Qingqing's eye—Zhang Jing had arrived.
