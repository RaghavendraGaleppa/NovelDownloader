# Chapter 117: Forced to Take the Breakthrough Pill

"Should I run?"

Chu Ning was extremely wary of the danger he faced. But the thought of Foundation Establishment cultivators possibly waiting for him outside made him abandon the idea. At the same time, he dared not relax his guard. His divine sense continued to extend outwards; he even took out a Spirit Nourishing Pill halfway through to recover his divine sense.

After another hour, confirming that no one else had returned, Chu Ning finally breathed a slight sigh of relief. Just as Chu Ning was about to retract his divine sense, he suddenly paused. At that moment, a streak of light rapidly descended in front of his Talisman Workshop. However, Chu Ning quickly retracted his divine sense and truly breathed a sigh of relief. The person who came was actually Lin Changqing, and he was accompanied by six Qi Refining disciples. It seemed he had picked up people from another market and had already arrived in the middle of the night.

After landing, Lin Changqing first showed a trace of surprise, then his expression suddenly changed drastically. He flashed and disappeared from the spot, heading straight for Lu Miaoying's courtyard. Looking grimly at Lu Miaoying's corpse, Lin Changqing then flashed again, appearing in Chu Ning's courtyard.

"Chu Ning!"

Hearing Lin Changqing's voice, Chu Ning walked out of his room. At this moment, he looked at Lin Changqing with a slightly puzzled expression. "Deacon Lin? Why are you here so late?" Pretending to be completely unaware of what had just happened was the best approach Chu Ning could think of at the moment. Otherwise, he couldn't possibly explain how he had survived at the hands of that Yin Demon Sect Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Lin Changqing saw Chu Ning and breathed a slight sigh of relief. Without answering Chu Ning, he quickly left again. Soon after, Lin Changqing led Chu Ning and the others to Lu Miaoying's room. Seeing Lu Miaoying's corpse, Gu Xiaoqing's face was filled with sorrow. Du Han's face, on the other hand, was ashen. Under his nose as the captain of the Enforcement Hall team, someone from the sect was actually killed; this clearly made the always proud him quite uncomfortable.

"Did any of you notice anything unusual?" Lin Changqing's gaze swept over everyone. After seeing everyone shake their heads, he waved his hand and said, "It's not your fault. The attacker was clearly a Foundation Establishment cultivator. It's normal that you couldn't detect them."

Foundation Establishment cultivator? Hearing this, everyone present had serious expressions.

"Deacon, who exactly was it? Is it the Yin Demon Sect again?" Du Han asked resentfully at this moment.

Lin Changqing nodded. "It should be them. This time, the sect's conscription of Qi Refining fifth and sixth layer disciples who cultivate wood-attribute techniques to return to the sect might have been discovered by the Yin Demon Sect. The sect later sent an urgent message, requesting that everyone be brought back before tonight, just in case. I didn't expect that even though I rushed here immediately, I was still a step too late." Lin Changqing shook his head, his stern face also looking grim.

"As for you..." Lin Changqing's gaze casually swept over Chu Ning. "Your Qi Refining fifth layer cultivation might be why you're still standing here. There are very few Qi Refining fifth layer disciples outside, so they might have thought we were only conscripting Qi Refining sixth layer disciples." Chu Ning heard Lin Changqing's explanation and naturally displayed an expression of lingering fear.

"You handle things here. I need to take them back to the sect immediately." Lin Changqing finished speaking to Du Han, then motioned for Chu Ning and the six people who had come with him to walk out together.

"Junior Brother Chu," Gu Xiaoqing spoke up proactively. "Take care!" Gu Xiaoqing spoke, and Shen Zhengquan also followed with a word of caution. Since the last ambush by the Yin Demon Sect, this person's attitude towards Chu Ning had changed greatly.

Chu Ning slightly cupped his hands towards the two, then joined the others, ascending into the air on Lin Changqing's spirit boat. They flew all the way towards Qingxi Sect. Taking the opportunity on the road, Chu Ning generally observed everyone. Four men and two women, the lowest was Qi Refining sixth layer cultivation, while the highest had already reached Qi Refining eighth layer. Of course, after Chu Ning joined, he was also the "lowest." And judging from the familiar fluctuations of spiritual energy on everyone, they were clearly all cultivators of wood-attribute techniques.

Perhaps because of the previous incident of a Foundation Establishment cultivator infiltrating and killing, coupled with Lin Changqing's habitually stern face, everyone's expressions were somewhat serious along the way, and no one spoke. Chu Ning didn't mind either and naturally wouldn't proactively question the few. His vigilance was no less than anyone else's. The mid-grade medium-rank talisman in his hand remained clutched. Fortunately, though the night was dark, the journey was normal.

When Lin Changqing landed everyone outside the outer sect, everyone visibly breathed a sigh of relief. "You all go back and rest. Gather at the outer sect dojo after dawn. The sect has its own arrangements." Lin Changqing finished speaking to the few, then let everyone leave on their own.

Chu Ning now had his own courtyard, so he naturally wouldn't be without a place to go like last time. He went straight to his courtyard, feeling a sense of unfamiliarity. After all, he had only stayed in this courtyard for one night previously, and the courtyard was empty, always feeling lifeless. Chu Ning looked at the sky; it wouldn't be long until dawn, and he was completely without sleepiness at the moment. He simply took out the Iron Stem Orchid from his storage bag and planted it in a corner of the courtyard. As for other things, Chu Ning had no mind to bother with them.

"This time being summoned back to the sect, if my guess is not wrong, it's very likely to enter that secret mission location. I don't know how long it will take to return after going there. This Iron Stem Orchid cannot stay in the storage bag for too long. As for other spiritual plants, I'll talk about them after I come out." Muttering to himself a few times, Chu Ning returned to his room, sat cross-legged, and took out the wooden sword made of Black Night Iron Soul Wood. At this moment, the wooden sword had completely turned its original wood color. Chu Ning tried to sense it with his divine sense, but there was no trace of wood essence qi inside. "It seems this sword is completely useless." Chu Ning sighed softly. This wooden sword, which was originally incredibly hard, now felt to Chu Ning as if he could break it with a gentle snap.

Putting the wooden sword away again, Chu Ning still chose to cultivate the Spirit Refining Art, treating it as a way to replenish his spirit after not resting that night. After cultivating for about an hour, the sky brightened. Chu Ning felt refreshed after finishing his cultivation and then headed towards the outer sect dojo. Not long after leaving his door, he actually saw Mu Ling, whom he hadn't seen for a long time, just coming out of her courtyard.

"Senior Sister Mu!" Chu Ning greeted her, and Mu Ling was slightly stunned when she saw Chu Ning. "Oh, Junior Brother Chu, didn't you go to the market? Why are you back?"

"The sect summoned me back," Chu Ning replied truthfully.

Mu Ling looked up at Chu Ning and said with some surprise, "The sect summoned you back? To participate in a mission, you need at least Qi Refining sixth layer, but you're only Qi Refining fifth layer."

Chu Ning shook his head. "I don't know about that." Then he looked at Mu Ling and smiled, "I haven't congratulated Senior Sister on reaching Qi Refining seventh layer yet."

Mu Ling heard this and immediately waved her hand. "What's there to congratulate? I've spent who knows how much more resources than you all, and my aptitude is still too poor. If I don't gain anything from this sect mission, I won't even think about what comes next."

Chu Ning was also somewhat surprised to hear this. "Senior Sister is also participating in that sect mission?"

Mu Ling nodded, and the two walked together towards the outer sect dojo. On the way, Chu Ning confirmed with Mu Ling again about her participation in the mission. Moreover, Mu Ling mentioned that her participation in the mission was actually proactively suggested by Elder Mu of the sect. Although many other disciples speculated about the reason for this summons, not many truly knew it was to participate in a sect mission. After hearing these words, the unease in Chu Ning's heart lessened slightly. Mu Ling was, after all, a junior of a Golden Core elder. If even she was going to participate, it seemed the mission's danger truly wouldn't be too great.

The two walked all the way to the outer sect dojo. At this moment, people were continuously arriving from different directions. Besides those like Chu Ning who came from the outer sect, quite a few servant disciples also arrived. Chu Ning saw several familiar figures from afar, such as Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang, a couple he hadn't seen for a long time, who had once been his neighbors. Both of them were at Qi Refining sixth layer cultivation, and their summons seemed reasonable this time. Another person was none other than Shang Zhaoxiang, whom Chu Ning had known since he first entered the sect. Besides them, there were also some servant disciples from District D, most of whom were at Qi Refining fifth layer cultivation.

Unlike Chu Ning, whose expression was calm as water at this moment, most of these people's faces revealed a hint of excitement and anticipation. When Chu Ning arrived at the dojo with Mu Ling, there were two cultivators who clearly looked like Foundation Establishment cultivators at the entrance.

"Qi Refining fifth layer? Go to the west side." A middle-aged Foundation Establishment cultivator glanced at Chu Ning and spoke directly.

Chu Ning immediately walked towards the west side, then he casually glanced at Mu Ling beside him. He noticed that the other Foundation Establishment cultivator made no requirements for Mu Ling; he just glanced at her and let her in directly. "Could it be that these Qi Refining fifth layer cultivators aren't going to participate in the mission together? Then why are they gathered here?" Chu Ning thought, and slightly shook his head. Then he consciously came to the west side area and sat down.

Shang Zhaoxiang might have seen Chu Ning, as he actually walked forward proactively and sat beside Chu Ning. "Junior Brother Chu, long time no see." Shang Zhaoxiang spoke first, and Chu Ning immediately stood up and cupped his hands towards him. "Senior Brother Shang!" Shang Zhaoxiang still had that smiling expression on his face, then looked at Chu Ning and said enviously, "It's been over a year since we last met, and Junior Brother Chu has actually reached Qi Refining fifth layer. This speed of cultivation progress is truly enviable."

"Just a bit of good luck," Chu Ning said. He didn't know if the other party knew about him going to the outer sect and Yanji Market, so he simply didn't bring it up now. What slightly surprised Chu Ning was that Shang Zhaoxiang didn't talk about that aspect either. Chu Ning had even fully expected the other party to casually mention Cao Dongxin, as they had been neighbors, and Cao Dongxin had later disappeared. However, Shang Zhaoxiang didn't mention it at all, only chatting with Chu Ning about some interesting anecdotes from the Spiritual Plant Garden's District D.

As they chatted idly like this, more people arrived one after another. Chu Ning looked around and found that in total, there were actually over four hundred people. "The sect actually needs so many wood-attribute cultivators. Is it because of the so-called Five Elements Qiankun Array?" Chu Ning was listening to Shang Zhaoxiang's idle chat, but his mind was completely elsewhere.

After a little while longer, a voice suddenly resounded within the dojo. "Welcome, Sect Master!" As these words fell, the entire dojo instantly erupted like a boiling pot.

"Sect Master?" "Sect Master!" Everyone spoke up one after another, and at the same time, all craned their necks to look forward. Chu Ning, at this moment, was also slightly surprised. After entering the sect, he had naturally heard some news about the Sect Master. It was rumored that the Qingxi Sect Master, Xin Wuyai, was a late-stage Golden Core cultivator, undoubtedly the strongest in the entire sect. Even among the sect masters of the seven great sects in the entire Green Gorge Mountain Range, his strength was among the top. This was different from Qingxi Sect's overall strength being at the bottom among the seven great sects. However, just like most people in this dojo, Chu Ning had only heard his name but never seen him. In fact, after entering Qingxi Sect, he had seen many Foundation Establishment cultivators, but not a single Golden Core cultivator.

Looking forward, Chu Ning soon saw a figure appear out of thin air in the sky above the front of the dojo. This person had a middle-aged face, wore a green cultivation robe, and faint ethereal qi emanated from his body, as if he had countless connections with heaven and earth. His gaze was clear and peaceful, but when everyone slightly looked up at him, each person felt that his eyes were looking at them, directly into their hearts.

"Golden Core powerhouse!" Chu Ning's heart trembled at this moment. This Sect Master clearly stood there without any movement, but his aura was so powerful that everyone felt it clearly.

"Disciples," Xin Wuyai's voice resounded in everyone's ears. "This summons is truly for everyone to participate in a major event concerning the rise and fall of our sect. This matter cannot be done by non-Qi Refining disciples, nor by non-wood attribute cultivators. All of you present are the most suitable people."

Xin Wuyai's voice wasn't loud, but in Chu Ning's ears, it had a soul-stirring quality. His heartbeat actually started to pound with the rhythm of Xin Wuyai's words. Chu Ning's heart tightened, but he didn't dare to make any movement.

"Those who participate in this mission will be rewarded by the sect with one mid-grade magic artifact and a certain amount of spiritual pills and herbs. Those who make great contributions in the mission can be directly promoted to inner sect true disciples and cultivate secret Dao techniques!" The crowd, who were already somewhat excited by Xin Wuyai's words, now almost all had excited expressions on their faces. As Qi Refining disciples, being able to contribute to the sect's prosperity and decline was already enough to excite many. And now, Xin Wuyai's promise made almost everyone eager to try.

"Elder Zhu, Elder Gui!" As Xin Wuyai's voice fell, two more figures appeared beside Xin Wuyai. One was a black-faced old man, and the other was an old man wearing a red robe. What surprised everyone was that these two, standing with Xin Wuyai, also had equally imposing auras. This made it almost easy for Chu Ning and the others to discern that both were also Golden Core cultivators.

"Disciples above Qi Refining sixth layer, Elder Zhu will take them away first. As for Qi Refining fifth layer disciples, I'll trouble Elder Gui." After speaking, Xin Wuyai watched Chu Ning and the others below with a smile on his face. "As for the specific mission, someone will naturally tell you when you get there. I, the Sect Master, will quietly await your triumphant return within the sect!"

As these words fell, the black-faced old man flew above the crowd and released a giant flying boat nearly ten zhang long. Nearly three hundred disciples above Qi Refining sixth layer boarded the boat one after another. This giant flying boat flashed and disappeared into the sky. "Is this too fast for me to see clearly, or is it direct teleportation?" Chu Ning looked at the suddenly disappearing giant flying boat, his heart filled with shock. "They all say Golden Core cultivators have the power to move mountains and overturn seas; it seems to be true."

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, Sect Master Xin Wuyai's figure had already disappeared. At this moment, only Elder Gui, dressed in red robes, remained in the dojo.

"You are all only at Qi Refining fifth layer, your cultivation is insufficient. The sect has specially refined a batch of pills to help you improve your strength. Everyone, after consuming it, find a place to cultivate. You can break through to Qi Refining sixth layer within a day." Elder Gui's voice rang in everyone's ears, and then with a flick of his sleeve, pills immediately appeared in front of everyone.

"A Breakthrough Pill!"

At this moment, within the west side area, several voices immediately rang out, full of complex implications. Clearly, these Qi Refining fifth layer disciples were not completely ignorant of this pill. And upon hearing someone speak the name of this pill, the remaining hundred-plus people in the dojo had various expressions on their faces. Except for a very few who hadn't heard of this pill, the others' expressions were either joyful or astonished.

People like Shang Zhaoxiang, at this moment, all revealed expressions of pleasant surprise. As a servant disciple, due to his low aptitude, he had been stuck at Qi Refining fifth layer for too long, with no end in sight for entering Qi Refining sixth layer. And now, with a Breakthrough Pill assisting his breakthrough, he was undoubtedly extremely delighted. As for being unable to further improve their cultivation after taking this Breakthrough Pill, they didn't care at all. In District D of the Spiritual Plant Garden, there were many who were stuck at Qi Refining sixth layer or Qi Refining fifth layer for life. To be precise, besides those who could be promoted to District C, most of the rest would be stuck at these two realms. So, with almost no hesitation, Shang Zhaoxiang, who was beside Chu Ning, grabbed the pill in front of him, then stood up and walked to a more open area to sit cross-legged and begin cultivating. Like Shang Zhaoxiang, there were more than seventy others.

Compared to their swiftness and ecstasy, Chu Ning, at this moment, looked at the pill in his hand with a complex expression. Breakthrough Pill, he had indeed heard the name of this pill. What he never expected was that the sect, in order to complete the so-called mission, would actually use such a pill to forcefully elevate everyone's cultivation, not hesitating to sever the cultivation paths of numerous disciples. Chu Ning's gaze swept across, finding that among those present, nearly thirty people had complex expressions. Except for one or two who looked slightly confused, probably unaware of the pill's effects, the rest had hesitant or even questioning expressions. And these people were either direct outer sect disciples, or younger servant disciples from District C of the Spiritual Plant Garden.

Just as everyone hesitated, Elder Gui's figure flashed and appeared among them. Instantly, a powerful pressure descended upon everyone.

"Why aren't you taking the pill? Are you worried that you won't be able to improve your cultivation in the future?" Elder Gui's faint voice came. "Don't worry, although this pill is similar to a Breakthrough Pill, it's a secret refined pill improved by the sect. While it will indeed affect future cultivation progress, it's only for one year. Within this year, your cultivation won't be able to advance to Qi Refining seventh layer, but after this period, it won't be affected."

Hearing Elder Gui's words, the hesitant and uncertain expressions on most people's faces gradually dissipated.

"All of you, take it!" At this moment, Elder Gui spoke again. With the Golden Core Elder's explanation, and under such pressure, most people immediately and involuntarily put the pill into their mouths. Elder Gui nodded with satisfaction, then his gaze swept and landed on Chu Ning.

"Why aren't you taking it?"
