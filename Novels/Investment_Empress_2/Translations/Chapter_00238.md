# Chapter 238: A Dreamlike Team-Up, Chang Bolong Goes Straight Down

Chang Bolong was taken down in a very stifled manner.

And in a way he never could have dreamed of.

...

He was originally a deputy general in the border army of the Southern Frontier. Due to his bone structure limitations, he had no hope of reaching the External Scenery realm in this lifetime.

Until later, he met a Divine Emissary of the Demonic Summoning Sect. Using part of the Demonic Summoning True Scripture passed down by the other party, he tyrannized the area he guarded and successively raised his strength by two minor realms.

But if you常 walk by the river, your shoes will eventually get wet.

His deeds were eventually leaked, and he could only flee his post with the help of the Divine Emissary.

Perhaps even the heavens favored him.

While passing through Yun Prefecture, he actually encountered a 'Divine Child.'

Half-demon bodies are all favored by the Divine Ones. As long as he could bring it back to the sect, it would be a great contribution.

The 'Divine Child' kept muttering a name during the journey:

"Brother Li will come save me..."

Li Mo, the genius on the Hidden Dragon List?

Chang Bolong laughed at that time.

Nineteenth on the Hidden Dragon List, it would be impressive enough if he could escape from his grasp, let alone come save someone?

Moreover, even if the other party truly had the strength to fight, what of it? If he couldn't find him, no matter how strong he was, it would be useless.

But what Chang Bolong didn't expect was that Li Mo actually found him.

And not only did he come.

He also brought the joint enforcement of the Drizzle Pavilion and the Hengyun Sword City!

What a dreamlike team-up!

...

"Who dares to call us Hengyun dogs? Today, we'll make you crawl away!"

"You offended Master Li and still want to escape?"

"So this is what it feels like to catch someone else, it's exhilarating."

"Today, we must handle things perfectly for my Master Li, not a single one escapes!"

The quiet temple was no longer quiet.

Although Chang Bolong wasn't a good guy, his strength was truly not weak. He could also form a military formation with the dozens of border soldiers under his command to amplify his own field.

The rebel side did not suffer a swift defeat.

But, it was only a matter of time.

Among the assassins from the Drizzle Pavilion, there were no lack of Inner Scenery experts, with various methods emerging one after another, like venomous snakes hiding in the dark.

And the external affairs stewards from the Hengyun Sword City had a chilling sword energy.

The various fields overlapped, and all kinds of Qi mechanisms surged chaotically. The Golden Light Temple instantly became ruins, and even caused the very heavens in that area to tremble uncontrollably.

Multiple Inner Scenery experts fighting made the commotion enormous.

Not far away.

"Fortunately, I disguised myself as a pilgrim and went in to poison them. This Chang Bolong is a bit strange."

Huang Donglai breathed a sigh of relief. He cupped his fists towards Li Mo again:

"Brother Li, this place is still too close. Should we retreat a bit further?"

"Is this far enough?"

Li Mo took a few steps back.

"Retreat a bit more..."

"Here?"

"Retreat, retreat!"

Huang Donglai stood by the riverbank. If anything unexpected happened, he could immediately jump into the river and flow downstream.

"....."

The corner of Li Mo's mouth twitched.

Standing so far away, he couldn't even see what was happening in the temple clearly.

And how did Huang Donglai just whoosh back so far? His footwork was too nimble; even with his Cloud-Walking Boots, it would be hard to catch up.

Clearly, Huang Donglai's movement technique had improved again...

Li Mo shook his head and looked towards the battlefield not far away, activating his Eye of Heavenly Fate.

He wanted to find out where Murong Xiao was first.

However, the information about Chang Bolong made him frown.

"A person from the Demonic Summoning Sect?"

"Then wouldn't that mean..."

Li Mo was just about to speak up and warn them.

The next moment, Chang Bolong suddenly let out a furious roar. The subordinates around him all exploded into mists of blood, and blood pills condensed one after another, fusing into his body.

Ripping out hearts and lungs is an old traditional skill of the Demonic Summoning Sect.

*Whoosh—*

Power condensed, and Chang Bolong's figure suddenly accelerated.

"Give me your life!"

This roar was directed at Li Mo.

That's right, Chang Bolong wanted to escape, and he chose the direction Li Mo was in.

Before leaving, he would make this brat pay the price!

---

Shrouded in blood Qi, with a pair of bull horns growing from his head and scarlet eyes, Chang Bolong charged over like a divine mountain.

The air around Li Mo became heavy.

"Brother Li!"

Huang Donglai's eyes widened.

He knew he should have insisted that Brother Li hide further away with him earlier.

This was an Inner Scenery expert, using a secret technique for a resentful strike; it could smash even a small mountain peak to pieces!

The assassins of the Drizzle Pavilion and the stewards of the sword city were instantly panicked.

But it happened so suddenly, they didn't have time to stop it!

However...

They gradually realized something was off.

Chang Bolong also noticed that not far away, a woman in palace attire lazily yawned.

This woman was clearly here to protect Li Mo, but she wasn't making a move at the moment.

And Chang Bolong found that the slightly slender young man not far away was actually not panicking at all, his eyes even showing a hint of astonishment.

Even as if he wanted to laugh.

"Looking down on me?"

With beastly nature entering his mind, Chang Bolong had no time to think more.

Behind him, a giant bull's Divine Will vaguely manifested, carrying the immense power to break through mountains, and crashed forward with a thunderous impact.

Vaguely, he seemed to see a thin layer of... golden light like glazed jade surrounding the youth's body?

Then.

*Clang~~~~~*

A tremendous boom.

The doubt had no time to be answered. Chang Bolong felt as if he had crashed into a divine iron, and both of his horns snapped with a crack.

Just as he was seeing stars and his consciousness was blurry.

He felt an even more violent pain from the back of his head.

How painful was it?

It directly smashed the stars in his vision into the shape of his grandmother...

"Shouldn't have beaten him to death, right?"

Li Mo retracted his forty-meter-long blade and kicked the prone Chang Bolong.

Why did this guy have to be so stubborn?

To clash head-on with my Vajra Body, did he have that kind of capability?

Chang Bolong was taken down.

His subordinates had already been disemboweled by himself.

The battle ended inexplicably like this.

The sword city's external affairs stewards and the assassins stood there awkwardly. They had originally prepared to rush forward to rescue, but instead saw Chang Bolong crash into Li Mo and go straight down on the spot.

Not going forward, the atmosphere was already here.

Going forward, it would look a bit silly, and there was nothing for them to do. Should they ask if Young Hero Li had eaten?

Actually, they wanted to know if they were awake or not.

An Inner Scenery expert crashing into a God-Viewing realm expert and knocking himself out?

The scene was extremely awkward.

Fortunately, Young Hero Li spoke up at this moment:

"I'll have to trouble you几位 to dismantle that Buddha statue."

"Ahaha, it seems Young Hero Li is quite a person of wisdom."

"Yes, yes, let's move this golden body to another place."

"By the way, which Bodhisattva is this enshrining?"

"Uh... this is Murong Xiao."

"???"

...

In the tavern.

Evening, the lake breeze was gentle.

Tian Shuang was sheathed. The girl held the long sword, looking towards the Yulong Lakeshore illuminated by the setting sun.

More accurately, she had been looking south.

That was the direction of the Southern Frontier.

After thinking about the appearance of Chang Bolong, she vaguely remembered something.

A group of figures appeared.

The youth walked at the forefront, the contours of his face clearly defined. He seemed to have suddenly drawn near.

"Ice Cube, I've brought Brother Murong back, and Chang Bolong has been captured too."

Li Mo raised his chin slightly.

"Mm."

"Do you know what happened just now? That Chang Bolong actually tried to ram me..."

The youth drank his tea, laughing and talking as he recounted the events that had just occurred.

Ying Bing looked at him. Her clear, deep eyes trembled slightly. She opened her lips, but in the end, she didn't say the words she wanted to say.

Just then, a voice came from the courtyard:

"Senior Brother Li! Chang Bolong has woken up!"
