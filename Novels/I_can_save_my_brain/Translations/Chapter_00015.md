# Chapter 15: Guang'an Prefecture

Two hours later.

The Canglong Hao docked in port.

After a month at sea, Chen Daoxuan finally set foot on solid ground.

"Is this Guang'an Prefecture?" he couldn't help but exclaim, looking at the bustling crowds of people jostling shoulder to shoulder.

"Yes, this is Guang'an Prefecture!" Chen Xianhe also felt his spirits lift at the sight of this most prosperous city within a hundred thousand miles.

To Chen Daoxuan, Guang'an Prefecture's prosperity resembled more of a modern coastal city than an ancient society from his previous life. First, the city had no traditional defensive walls—it was completely open. Second, the buildings stretched endlessly—residences, taverns, inns, trading houses—one after another in an unbroken line.

After disembarking, Chen Daoxuan noticed a group of oddly dressed mortals on the docks, hauling sacks of grain onto Cloud-Treading Beast-drawn carts without pause. They wore shackles and moved with difficulty, each group of dozens of laborers overseen by a mortal martial artist wielding a whip.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, Chen Daoxuan discovered the sacks were filled with grain.

Noticing his gaze, Chen Xianhe explained, "Those are mortal prisoners of war from Chuyun Kingdom. They were bought by rogue cultivators and minor families to serve as slaves."

"Using mortals as slaves?" Chen Daoxuan had always thought mortals were merely tools for producing potential cultivators. He hadn't realized they could also be enslaved.

Seeming to understand his confusion, Chen Xianhe smiled. "Of course. We cultivators can survive without food or drink, but mortals cannot. Great cultivation clans not only have numerous cultivators but also massive mortal populations. Take the Zhou family, for example—they have tens of millions of mortal clan members. Such numbers can't be sustained by the food production of Lingbei Island alone."

Chen Daoxuan immediately understood. These Chuyun Kingdom slaves were mostly serfs for the cultivators of Wanxinghai. Rogue cultivators used them to cultivate barren islands and grow crops, while the great clans purchased the grain with meager spirit stones to feed their enormous populations—a mutually beneficial arrangement. This was also one way rogue cultivators earned spirit stones.

As for why the Chen family of Shuanghu Island hadn't developed this "industry," a glance at his aging Thirteenth Uncle made the reason clear. It wasn't that the Chens were particularly kind-hearted—they simply lacked the manpower. Between managing clan affairs and protecting the mortals of Changping County, Chen Xianhe had no energy left for such "side businesses." Moreover, most Chuyun Kingdom prisoners were martial artists. Without cultivators to suppress them, ordinary Chen clansmen would struggle to prevent rebellion or escape. Combined with the meager profits from trading grain for spirit stones, the venture seemed hardly worth the effort.

"These slaves... they were originally members of cultivation families in Chuyun Kingdom, weren't they?" Chen Daoxuan asked after a moment.

Chen Xianhe fell silent before nodding. "Correct. The war between Wanxinghai and Chuyun Kingdom has lasted over four hundred years. Fortunately, we've mostly been on the offensive, so the suffering has largely fallen on Chuyun's mortals. The men are sold as serfs, while the women become tools for reproduction among our great clans."

In just a few sentences, Chen Xianhe painted a brutal picture of the cultivation world—a place devoid of kindness, where the struggle for resources made conflicts harsher than anything in Chen Daoxuan's previous life. The sorrow of weakness remained unchanged across worlds.

Seeing Chen Daoxuan's grim expression, Chen Xianhe continued his lesson. As the future patriarch of Shuanghu Island's Chen family, these were truths he needed to face. Keeping them from him before had been to allow focus on artifact refinement, not to let him avoid reality.

"Is weakness truly a crime?" Chen Daoxuan murmured.

Chen Xianhe paused, then nodded firmly. "Yes. In this world, weakness is a crime."

As they proceeded, Chen Xianhe first settled their accompanying clansmen at an inn in Guang'an Prefecture before leading Chen Daoxuan toward the inner city. The further they went, the more cultivators they encountered, until eventually no mortals remained in sight.

"Though Guang'an Prefecture is a mixed city of cultivators and mortals, they don't actually live together," Chen Xianhe explained as they walked. "The inner city we're heading to now is the true Guang'an Prefecture Immortal City."

Sure enough, a towering wall soon appeared before them. At the gate, a cultivator in a blue robe emblazoned with a fiery red spirit pearl stopped them. "Halt. Pay the entry tax."

Chen Xianhe produced two spirit stones from his storage pouch and handed them over. With a wave, the Zhou family cultivator allowed them passage.

Looking back, Chen Daoxuan saw an endless line of people waiting behind them.

The moment they stepped through the gate, it was like entering another world—the spiritual energy density surged at least tenfold.

"This is..." Chen Daoxuan gasped in astonishment.

"Spiritual veins," Chen Xianhe explained. "Beneath Guang'an Prefecture Immortal City lies a third-grade spiritual vein. Just entering its range, we can feel the overwhelming spiritual energy."

Glancing at the sky, Chen Xianhe added, "Let's find an inn first. Every night, Zhou family cultivators clear out those without residence rights to prevent rogue cultivators from freeloading on the spiritual energy."

Housing in the Immortal City came in two forms: short-term (inns, usually under a month) and long-term (renting cave dwellings from the Zhou family, cheaper for stays exceeding a month). Given the abundant spiritual energy, prices were staggering—Chen Xianhe paid 20 spirit stones just for two rooms for ten days, averaging one stone per person per day. And this was at the lowest-grade inn.

Rumors spoke of four grades of cave dwellings—Jia, Yi, Bing, and Ding—each with progressively better environments and spiritual energy concentrations. The cost of a top-tier Jia-grade dwelling was unimaginable to ordinary rogue cultivators and minor clan members, reserved only for scions of great families or exceptionally skilled independents.
