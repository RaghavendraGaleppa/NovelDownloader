# Chapter 79: Divine Abomination!

Within the endless Void Storm, eight warships cruised, like unyielding reefs in raging waves. Though seemingly minuscule, they were steadily impregnable. The light of Divine Law flowed across the interconnected rune chains, forming their first line of defense, blocking out all the dark storm.

It was impossible to discern direction within the Void Storm; they could only rely on the fluctuations of Divine Law emanating from the Land of the Forsaken Gods to guide them.

Three days had passed since their departure. The ancient ships were equipped with excellent basic facilities; the cabins utilized spatial expansion formations, so there was no fear of being cramped.

Zhou Tian emerged from his room. After boarding the ancient ship, he had virtually no opportunity to cause trouble. There were only so many people on board, and moreover, there were strict rules against fighting.

The main hall in the ship's cabin resembled a restaurant. Although spacious, currently only Zhou Zui and a few others were sitting there drinking.

Seeing Zhou Tian approach, Zhang Yi spoke, "Why do you suddenly have time to come find us today?"

Zhou Tian and Tian Ling's disgustingly lovey-dovey behavior on the ship these past two days had truly sickened them.

"Why is still no one else coming out to hang out?" Zhou Tian ignored Zhang Yi, looked around the hall, and asked. Since boarding the ship, this place had mostly been frequented only by a few of them. Occasionally, Zhou Tian and Tian Ling would come here to flaunt their affection. Zhou Tian initially thought they were just shy, but he didn't expect that even on the third day, no one else had appeared.

"Who knows, maybe they're cultivating," Zhou Zui said with a shrug.

"What about my Second Brother and the others? Still haven't seen them?" Zhou Tian pressed. Ever since they boarded, Zhou Yan and Zhou Ying had not shown their faces. They couldn't be found, mysteriously engaged in who knew what.

"No..." Zhang Yi raised his wine cup. The jade-like liquid glided down his throat, and after a comfortable groan, he continued, "I'm afraid something might go wrong this time. Be mentally prepared."

"Something wrong?" Zhou Tian frowned and asked. Although the reason Zhou Ying gave was somewhat far-fetched, it shouldn't be to push them into a pit of fire, right?

"Indeed, I've had a vague feeling something wasn't right ever since 'Heaven's Opportunity' suddenly emerged. This Eight Provinces Grand Competition is likely to be turbulent." Zhang Yi put down his cup and said.

"Alright, don't worry yourselves unnecessarily. Heaven's Qin wouldn't let us die here. Let's just wait and see," Zhou Xunchuan, who had been silent, concluded.

Another three days passed. The Land of the Forsaken Gods drew closer and closer. Through the Void Storm, they could even discern the outlines of some enormous divine mountains.

Zhou Tian and Tian Ling stood on the deck, observing the approaching scenery. An incredibly vast land mass was slowly drawing near, a sight that left them awestruck.

A "thud-thud-thud" sound came from behind them. Zhou Tian retracted his hand that had been wandering on Tian Ling's body and turned to see Zhou Zui approaching. Coming closer, Zhou Zui said, "What a magnificent view! It's a shame they aren't coming up to see it. Once they knew you two were up here, they became too embarrassed to come out."

"Then what are you doing up here? Coming to watch us flaunt our affection?" Zhou Tian retorted grumpily. Tian Ling's beautiful eyes, sparkling, glared at Zhou Tian. It was all his fault; Sister Liu Yan's teasing remarks had become increasingly strange lately, making her quite embarrassed.

"Such beautiful scenery is rare; if you don't look closely, you'll miss the chance," Zhou Zui chuckled, then continued, "It seems Sun Dao was right after all. Zhang Yi really is a charlatan. We're almost at the Land of the Forsaken Gods, and nothing has happened. Once we reach the Land of the Forsaken Gods, I'll definitely..."

Before his words finished—

Boom!

The ancient ship beneath their feet suddenly shuddered. From within the Void Storm, an enormous snake head abruptly shot out. Its two eyes were scarlet, vast as stars, and its tail fiercely lashed the formation composed of the eight ancient ships, sending ripples scattering in all directions.

Zhou Tian gave the dumbfounded Zhou Zui beside him a speechless look. Brother, don't you know not to tempt fate by making such bold declarations?

In an instant, a figure appeared on the deck. It was Zhou Yan, whom they hadn't seen in days. He glanced at them, frowned, and shouted, "Quickly get into the cabin!"

Without another word, Zhou Tian pulled Tian Ling's hand and headed into the cabin, with Zhou Zui close behind.

Several other figures appeared on the other warships, all exuding overwhelming auras, staring at the colossal snake body in the void. Compared to it, the warships were no larger than grains of rice. The formation composed of eight Emperor-tier warships developed cracks after just a single strike.

"They've made their move." Beside Zhou Yan, the figures of Zhou Ying and the other three emerged, all staring at the snake body in the void with grave expressions.

"But wasn't the Chaotic Imperial Python's location still some distance away from us?" Wei Chuan frowned. They had been informed about being bait. According to the calculations, the Chaotic Imperial Python was only supposed to reach their position tomorrow. Why had it suddenly appeared today?

"It must have used something to obscure the Heavenly Gate's detection. It seems their preparations were very thorough." Zhou Yan pulled out a formation plate from the void, wreathed in golden light. Formation plates also floated up from the other warships.

The eight formation plates floated up, emitting light. Runes surged out, and a golden light-emitting formation unfurled, enveloping all eight warships.

Boom!

The snake's tail struck down again. This time, it hit the golden light formation but didn't even cause a ripple.

Boundless light flared as a creature with twelve wings (six pairs) emerged from the void. Its true body was a thousand zhang tall, its face obscured. A slight flap of its wings stirred up an endless storm.

"A Heavenly King-tier formation, truly a grand scheme!" The Void Storm was not supposed to transmit sound, but at this moment, the creature's voice accurately entered everyone's ears, like a resounding great bell, impossible to discern as male or female.

"Divine Abomination! It really is you!" A figure stepped out from the void, shrouded in an overwhelming sanguine aura. Various ancient fierce beast phantoms appeared around him, all roaring skyward. Where he passed, even the Void Storm itself ceased.

"Abomination? You are the abominations!" The creature shrouded in light roared. The Void Storm raged even more fiercely, mixed with light, striking the formation and causing resplendent runes to erupt.

"More talk is useless. Reveal all your trump cards!" From within the bloody light, a wolf's head emerged, with thick red fur, a single horn on its head, and two fangs as massive as sky-reaching pillars.

It opened its bloody maw and swallowed towards the winged creature. This single bite crushed space, drawing out the Void Storm, truly devouring the heavens and refining all things.

The winged creature, its arm wreathed in light, swung it, drawing out a Sacred Sword entwined with white holy flame. Its entire body was powerful yet sacred, possessing a perfect posture.

As the Sacred Sword struck, boundless light accompanied it. Abruptly, sounds of prayer echoed in the void, and a Divine Kingdom materialized around the winged creature. His believers were praying, empowering him!
