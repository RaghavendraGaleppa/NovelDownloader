**Chapter 17: The Imperial Palace**

Lifting the purple-gold carriage curtain, Zhou Tian glanced outside and was instantly struck by awe.

The imperial palace walls were a thousand zhang high, constructed from bluish-grey stone bricks. Each brick was meticulously polished, with sharp, distinct edges. Upon closer inspection, one could discern subtle indentations carved into them, exuding an ancient and majestic aura.

Beneath the walls stood three gates. The central gate was massive, nearly a hundred zhang tall, with two leaves, each a hundred zhang wide, currently tightly shut. It was crafted from a purple material, bearing patterns resembling lightning strikes – not carved, but as if naturally occurring. Two colossal golden dragon heads were sculpted upon its surface, which astonishingly blinked their eyes, brimming with an inexplicable vitality. Clearly, these were no ordinary carvings; they possessed an unknown power. On either side stood smaller gates, only several tens of zhang high. They appeared less imposing, lacking elaborate decorations.

In front of each of the three gates, two guards stood sentry, making a total of six guards. The two towering guards at the main gate wore golden armor, complete with golden face masks. Dragon heads were carved into their breastplates, and they wielded golden halberds, their tips glinting in the sunlight. Their blood qi surged skyward, radiating an oppressive killing intent. The side gates were guarded by silver-armored guards, who, apart from the color difference, were similar in appearance to those at the main gate. An ancient and grand aura reverberated here. Before such magnificent architecture, anyone would feel as minuscule as an ant.

“Stop staring!” Runes appeared in Zhou Yi’s hand, and he pulled Zhou Tian back with a forceful tug. “Innumerable formations are carved into this city wall, fortified by countless powerful cultivators. Although their aura is restrained, prolonged staring can still affect your spirit.”

“Understood,” Zhou Tian nodded, then turned to look at Tian Ling. There wasn't much more to see on the walls outside; the beauty beside him was far more worth observing.

By this time, the carriage had reached one of the side gates. Seeing the carriage, the gate guards extended their two great halberds, from which silver runic chains unfurled, blocking the carriage's path. They recognized it as Prince Qin’s carriage, but simply having the imperial carriage wasn't enough to enter the palace; that wasn't among their established rules.

Zhou Yi, inside the carriage, paid it no mind. His finger tapped out a series of runes in the air, and a light-golden, dragon-emblazoned token flew out from the void. A guard reached out and took the token, divine light flashing in his eyes. Moments later, he returned the token, and with a retraction of their halberds, one guard, his blood qi surging, bellowed, “Prince Qin—arrives!”

The large gate behind them slowly opened, and faint, indistinct voices echoed from within. “Prince Qin—arrives!” “Prince Qin—arrives!” ...

A person dressed in a deep blue robe, with a pale complexion, appeared from behind the gate. Slightly bowing, he quickly stepped forward upon seeing Zhou Yi’s carriage and said, “Your Royal Highness Prince Qin, His Majesty is in the Hall of Mental Cultivation. Please follow this servant…” His voice was somewhat high-pitched and reedy.

Zhou Yi slowly opened his eyes, which were filled with dignity. He saw Zhou Tian opposite him, leaning close to Tian Ling’s ear, chatting and making her laugh like a blooming flower. Zhou Yi’s eye twitched, and he closed his eyes again. He spoke aloud, “Yes, I understand. Lead the way!”

“Understood!” The person acknowledged, turned, and walked away, the Purple-scaled Dragon Beast dutifully following behind.

The Hall of Mental Cultivation was located within the Inner Palace. Carriages were not permitted inside the Inner Palace, so the carriage was halted at the square in front of it. The square was vast, paved with white jade bricks, its edges adorned with millennium-enduring flowers and ten-thousand-year evergreen grasses. In its center stood a towering jade pillar, reaching ten thousand meters high, to which a golden rope was tethered. At the end of the rope hung a Nine-Dragon Glazed Battle Chariot. Nine golden divine dragons pulled the golden glazed carriage, which stretched nearly a thousand meters long (naturally, this was the length after the divine dragons had shrunk). It floated in the air, each divine dragon shining as brilliantly as a great sun, their bodies enveloped in runes, radiating a shimmering divine brilliance that deterred direct gaze. The once immensely spirited Purple-scaled Dragon Beast, upon arriving here, became as docile as a pug, finding a corner to stay in, not daring to even breathe loudly!
