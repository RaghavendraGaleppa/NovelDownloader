# Chapter 79: Lord Xuanming Seizes the Nether Position

Time often waits for no one.

As Lu Yang pondered, the darkness surrounding the yellow-robed elder nearby had already spread to him, carrying a strong corrosive power. Lu Yang looked up, observing his opponent with interest.

“So this is a Witch Ghost?”

The Witch Ghost Dao was a major demonic sect in ancient times. Every disciple of the Witch Ghost Dao would refine a Natal Witch Ghost to serve as the foundation for their future cultivation. However, with the emergence of the Golden Core Sword Qi, the Witch Ghost Dao was exterminated. These Witch Ghosts, without their cultivators' control, began to wander the secret realm. Based on the strength of their cultivators in life, the Witch Ghosts were categorized into White-robed, Yellow-robed, Black-robed, and the fiercest, Red-robed Ghosts.

As for the living inhabitants of the secret realm, their origins were also complex. Their ancestors were either servants once kept by the Witch Ghost Dao, or disciples who had decisively crippled their own cultivation when the Witch Ghost Dao faced its catastrophe. This was because cultivation was forbidden within the secret realm. The Golden Core Sword Qi's purpose was to eradicate the Witch Ghost Dao's legacy, so anyone who embarked on cultivation, even if only at the first level of Qi Condensation, would be slain by the sword qi. This was also why Lu Yang, being an outsider and a target for the sword qi's 'nesting,' wasn't slain the moment he entered the secret realm. However, it was almost the same as being dead, for as long as the sword qi lingered, his clone would be unable to leave the secret realm, making it no different from being dead.

The fate of the Witch Ghost Dao was even more ironic. Since only mortals survived, and they couldn't cultivate, they became prey for the uncontrolled Witch Ghosts, constantly being hunted and devoured. Those who controlled ghosts were ultimately devoured by ghosts.

“That being said, humans always find a way out of predicaments.”

Although cultivation was impossible, over a thousand years, generations of mortals in the secret realm, risking life and limb, eventually found a method to combat the Witch Ghosts. That was 'Taming Ghosts to Serve Yanluo.' In simple terms, it involved using a secret technique to dedicate oneself to a Witch Ghost, allowing one to borrow the Witch Ghost's power while being devoured by it.

“The cultivator who pioneered this system called himself 'Ancestor Listening Nether.' The Listening Nether Sect he founded has now become the sole sect within the secret realm, deeply rooted and even possessing a systematic method of ghost taming, with different titles determined by the grade of the tamed ghost.”

One who tames a White-robed Ghost is called a 'Ghost Bailiff'.
One who tames a Yellow-robed Ghost is called a 'Rakshasa'.
One who tames a Black-robed Ghost is called an 'Impermenance'.
As for the fiercest, Red-robed Ghosts, whoever can tame one immediately becomes an elder of the Listening Nether Sect, and is known as a 'Yanluo Walker' within the secret realm.

“...Quite the variety.”

Although cultivators following this ghost-taming system rarely lived longer than six months to a year, their strength, while they were alive, was beyond doubt. At their peak, they could even rival the Great Perfection of Qi Condensation. The Yellow-robed Ghost before him had the strength of a Mid Qi Condensation cultivator.

What truly interested Lu Yang, however, was that he detected a mysterious aura related to 'Divine Position' from this Yellow-robed Ghost.

“It's somewhat like... a fragment of a great divine ability?”

This sensation was akin to the superior divine abilities that compose a Great Divine Ability, only infinitely weaker in potency, thus appearing extremely faint. Lu Yang stretched out his hand, instantly seizing the Yellow-robed Ghost and refining it in an instant.

“Indeed, it's related to a Divine Position, but hasn't reached the Foundation Establishment level.”

“These Witch Ghosts wandering the secret realm should all be related to a certain Great Divine Ability, and these Witch Ghosts are fragments of that Great Divine Ability...”

After a moment of thought, Lu Yang took out his Myriad Spirit Banner. Immediately, he sent the Yellow-robed Ghost onto the banner, transforming it into a banner spirit. Gradually, an unusual expression appeared on Lu Yang's face.

“This is truly... an unexpected surprise!”

The Witch Ghosts within the secret realm harbored a faint trace of Divine Position aura, seemingly related to a Great Divine Ability, and his Myriad Spirit Banner could transform these Witch Ghosts for his own use.

Lu Yang was greatly surprised, his thoughts racing. It proved that he could completely subdue and refine all the Witch Ghosts in the secret realm using the Myriad Spirit Banner, thereby reassembling these Divine Position fragments. In the end, he might even be able to condense another Great Divine Ability that could help him break through to Foundation Establishment! Thinking of this, Lu Yang's heart immediately burned with enthusiasm.

“The beings here have suffered from the harm of Witch Ghosts for too long. I am kind-hearted and always compassionate, so I shall reluctantly collect these Witch Ghosts and bring peace to this place...”

Following this, Lu Yang looked towards the unconscious boy. With his cultivation, soul-searching a mortal would naturally not leave any after-effects. He even left behind a martial arts cultivation method as compensation.

“I truly am a great benevolent person,”

Just then, a sound suddenly came from the distant horizon. Lu Yang looked up and saw a patch of dark clouds. Within the clouds was a black-robed Daoist, followed by two young boys and more than ten beautiful maids. At a glance, the boys held treasures, guarding his left and right, while the maids either held fans and incense, or played flutes and pipes. Behind them followed a long procession, dressed in black and white, holding suonas and drums, playing music and dancing as they moved. The vast crowd created an immense spectacle.

“Hmm? Where are the Witch Ghosts here?”

The black-robed Daoist in the clouds fixed his gaze on Lu Yang, then frowned. “Are you the mortal who sent the report? And where is the Ghost Bailiff here?”

Hearing this, Lu Yang glanced at him, and calmly replied, “Dead.” According to the boy's memories gained through soul-searching, the Ghost Bailiff had long since been killed by the Yellow-robed Ghost, which was why the boy had been hiding in the ruins to evade the Witch Ghosts.

The black-robed Daoist in the clouds frowned even deeper upon hearing this. He then suddenly gestured, prompting a boy beside him to take out a circular mirror and shine its light directly onto Lu Yang. Lu Yang's eyebrows subtly rose at the sight. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he discerned the mirror's function but neither dodged nor avoided, allowing the mirror light to fall upon him.

The next second, the black-robed Daoist sneered:

“I wondered who it was! So it’s an 'outside wild fox Zen.' You must have killed the Ghost Bailiff and stolen the Witch Ghosts here. It seems this Seat cannot spare you today!”

“...Wild fox Zen?”

Lu Yang found this utterly absurd. A heretical sect from a secret realm daring to call him 'wild fox Zen'? This was simply defying heavenly order!

On the other hand, the black-robed Daoist saw nothing wrong with it. Although the Witch Ghost secret realm was secluded, it wasn't completely cut off from the world. Thus, over the years, rogue cultivators occasionally stumbled into it by chance. The black-robed Daoist had seen many such cases. However, rogue cultivators were weak and isolated; their cultivation rarely exceeded early Qi Condensation, or mid Qi Condensation at best, appearing far too feeble before the Listening Nether Sect. Over time, the black-robed Daoist naturally came to disdain the so-called outside cultivators. Therefore, now facing Lu Yang, he was full of confidence, not taking him seriously at all, only thinking of capturing him quickly to return and report his mission.

The next second, the black-robed Daoist focused his mind and circulated his qi. His originally somewhat ruddy complexion instantly turned ghastly pale, while only his lips became plump and rosy, growing even more vibrant, revealing a strange Daoist aura. He controlled a Black-robed Ghost named 'Summoned Demise.' As the name implied, once this Witch Ghost locked onto a target, it could divine their name. When the black-robed Daoist then called out that name, the person would immediately have their soul snatched away by the Witch Ghost, dying within a short period. Relying on this Witch Ghost, he had always been victorious in battle against others. This time was no different. He directly activated the Witch Ghost to divine the 'wild fox Zen' before him. Almost simultaneously, Lu Yang also sensed something.

“Divining my name?”

Lu Yang's eyebrows subtly lifted. “Interesting. These Witch Ghosts, as fragments of a Great Divine Ability, are tainted with a trace of Divine Position aura, and can actually involve karma...” As he spoke, he conjured a spell, obscuring his karma. Although he was confident that with his own Divine Position, whatever the other party divined wouldn't matter, a gentleman does not stand under a crumbling wall; there was no need to take risks.

“How can this be!?”

Seeing that 'Summoned Demise' had achieved nothing, the black-robed Daoist immediately panicked, not understanding why his invincible Witch Ghost had encountered such an anomaly. Lu Yang shook his head at the sight. “Truly unchallenging. Far inferior to a Foundation Establishment cultivator.”

“But this is good too. Overcoming the stronger by the weaker was never my style of action. I'm more adept at this kind of downward-compatible, cross-realm slaying...”

On the other side, the black-robed Daoist seemed to suddenly remember something. He then reached into his robes and astonishingly pulled out a divine statue carved from red wax. Its appearance was solemn and majestic, with three long incense sticks standing atop its crown. Without a word, the black-robed Daoist lit them.

The next second, green flames ignited behind the statue's head.

“I invite the Ancestor to manifest!”

The black-robed Daoist bowed low. In an instant, rolling auspicious clouds drifted from the three incense sticks atop the statue's head, and the statue's own brows unfurled. Immediately after, celestial music resonated, sweet rain descended from the heavens, golden lotuses sprouted from the earth, and countless phenomena embellished the divine statue, making it appear increasingly sacred and majestic. Even its facial features became lifelike; though merely a wax figure, it seemed to be a living person, speaking to Lu Yang with a booming voice:

“What lowly wretch dares to offend my sect's lineage?”

.

Lu Yang did not reply, silently observing his opponent with a strange expression. This was because, to those with and without a Divine Position, the appearance of the statue was vastly different. Ordinary people would see the statue as lifelike, as if it were a living person. However, in Lu Yang's eyes, the statue was still just a statue. What truly moved him was a streak of divine ability light that now appeared at his feet. The light of the divine ability was profound, with seven ancient seal characters clearly rising and falling within it, continuously erupting with majestic power. Lu Yang instantly understood. This was the Great Divine Ability he had previously speculated about, one that could only be condensed after gathering all the myriad Witch Ghosts in the secret realm!

Its name was:

【Lord Xuanming Seizes the Nether Position】!
