# Chapter 108: Decisive Battle

That night, countless people wailed, on the verge of bankruptcy because they had bet on the "wrong" person. Many never expected that Cui Chongxuan, who possessed the legendary Sixfold Imperial Strength, would be defeated by an unknown youth. At the very least, major bookmakers far away had thought so earlier, as their information couldn't update as quickly as developments at Mount Luofu.

"Li Ye, who is he? He made this old man regret deeply, almost losing his pants!" Qin Ming, acting as Li Qingyue's "cousin" and using the pseudonym Li Ye, had now become renowned in the Night Mist World... among many gamblers.

"Cui Chongxuan, did you practice your 'Sixfold Imperial Heart Scripture' for nothing? To suffer such a crushing defeat, making me incur heavy losses, I'm fuming!"

Many had long anticipated Zhou Chengru's defeat by Li Qingyue. But Cui Chongxuan losing to Li Ye was truly hard to accept. After all, he had the backing of a thousand-year-old aristocratic family, combined with the legendary Sixfold Imperial Strength, and his own exceptional talent; there was no reason for him to lose. Many who had lost with "red eyes" naturally expressed their true feelings, continuously swearing profusely throughout the night.

Outside the ruins of Mount Luofu, the Cui family members had grim expressions. They never imagined that their chosen contender would be the first to be eliminated. Earlier, it was rumored that various Daoist lineages from the Outer Lands had reached a tacit agreement, disapproving of Li Qingxu's domineering and protective master. They planned to be the first to eliminate him within the rules. As it turned out, although his situation was precarious, he had not yet been eliminated.

Official gazettes would not report such things, but the "Night Reports" launched by private organizations undoubtedly had sensational news and fresh material, and began reporting it widely. For a time, many people hotly debated, believing that Li Qingyue would claim the Near-Immortal Object. And her cousin, Li Ye, might accompany her to the very end, displaying extraordinary prowess within Mount Luofu.

Qin Ming quietly assimilated the fragmented Sixfold Imperial Heart Scripture. Its effect on empathizing with the emotions of those nearby was far from ideal, as there were too many "impurities," and the emotions related to the scripture were highly fragmented.

"Of the legendary Sixfold Imperial Strength, Cui Chongxuan only mastered the Bright Imperial Strength. In the Nascent stage, one needs to master two Imperial Strengths to be considered successful." Qin Ming compared the Heavenlight Strength, which he had integrated from the silk scroll, with the Sixfold Imperial Strength. Although he defeated Cui Chongxuan, it was mainly because the latter had not yet fully cultivated it. He reminded himself not to get carried away, as the Heavenlight Strength he currently possessed, even integrated, certainly couldn't compare to the true Sixfold Imperial Strength, Tathagata Strength, or Jade Clarity Strength in the Nascent stage.

"I still need to continue practicing other Heavenlight Strengths, ideally integrating wondrous arts to ensure that I can suppress two Imperial Strengths in the Nascent stage. That way, I won't fear the legendary strength arts."

Li Qingyue walked over, her aura elegant and ethereal. She looked at the two men and one woman who followed her and said, "You are all injured. Return now, you've worked hard!" The three golden-armored guards opened their mouths as if to speak, but in the end, they just nodded and departed. They knew that the battles to come would likely be even more intense, perhaps even bloody. This competition among core disciples, besides contending for the Near-Immortal Object, was probably also about vying for a certain ranking and status, which was related to the resources they would obtain in the future.

Qin Ming spoke, "Cui Chonghe almost pulled off a deception. If he hadn't encountered your Spirit Pupils, he might very well have become the final winner."

Li Qingyue nodded. With Cui Chonghe's astonishing strength, if he had continued his disguise, he would likely have intercepted and obtained that legendary item in the end.

The two set off. After bypassing the fiery red great lake, the path ahead grew dim. Fiery springs became scarce, and the sky was utterly black, so dark one could barely see their own hand. They proceeded cautiously, secretly on guard.

"Is this really considered a Spirit Cave? Such a vast area." When Qin Ming first heard Meng Xinghai mention Spirit Caves, he thought they were just openings similar to wells.

Li Qingyue said, "Back then, some prominent figures from the Outer Lands attempted to elevate Mount Luofu from a top-tier Blessed Land to the legendary Grotto-Heaven level. Unfortunately, they failed, turning this place into scorched earth. A millennium has passed, and it is only now gradually recovering."

Qin Ming was utterly speechless. So-called Spirit Caves were actually failed Grotto-Heavens!

"Where is that place with incredibly dense and violent Heavenlight from beyond this world, and how far is it?" Qin Ming was very much looking forward to it. Not only did he want to help his close friend obtain the Near-Immortal Object, but he also wanted to bathe in the Heavenlight from beyond this world and undergo another rebirth. Unfortunately, this time he hadn't practiced any special strength arts beforehand, nor any wondrous techniques. Otherwise, integrating and improving within the Heavenlight from beyond this world would surely have a very powerful effect. He was pondering the Sixfold Imperial Heart Scripture. It was a pity it was all fragmented scripture; he wanted to analyze as much astonishing content from it as possible.

Li Qingyue said, "Although the ruins of Mount Luofu are vast, it's not very far from there anymore. Let's be cautious. I always feel it's too quiet, and we've seen too few disciples from the Outer Lands."

The pitch-black area was barren, not a blade of grass grew. It had once been pierced by the Heavenlight from beyond this world, and lacked the nourishment of fiery springs. Even now, violent auras slowly flowed through it. After traversing the darkness, light gradually appeared ahead, and they approached an area with fiery springs again. The vegetation here was lush and thriving. Small streams of fiery springs flowed down many mountain peaks, appearing like winding lava from afar. On some colossal mountains, fiery spring waterfalls cascaded down, exceptionally magnificent and dazzling, resembling inverted star rivers, illuminating the entire region.

Li Qingyue showed delight and said, "This area has indeed recovered. Our lineage's patriarch once made arrangements here back then. I wonder how they are now." She felt it was a pity, but time was pressing now, and they couldn't delay, fearing that someone else might get to the Near-Immortal Object first. "We'll come back here to search later."

Qin Ming gripped his great spear, remaining constantly vigilant.

Subsequently, they stepped into a woodland permeated by white mist. Everywhere were snow-white bamboo stalks, from root to leaf, all as pure white as jade. The mist here was thick, creating a hazy, ethereal atmosphere, as if nearing an immortal's cultivation ground.

"Quickly, go back!" Li Qingyue suddenly whispered. Moreover, she used her weapon for the first time, drawing a short sword wreathed in five-colored light. In front of her, a wooden shield shimmering with crystalline luster also floated.

Qin Ming realized something was wrong, but he hadn't yet discovered anything. Li Qingyue was one major realm higher than him, so she must have sensed something. Qin Ming calmed his mind and finally sensed it: it was as if a large number of terrifying fierce beasts were approaching from all directions, gradually creating a suffocating feeling. During this process, Li Qingyue led him back along their original path.

"I told you, Junior Sister Li's divine sense is acute; there's no way we could wait for her to enter the most ideal zone." Someone spoke, cutting off their path.

"Fortunately, we have enough people and made preparations along the way. Hmm, those ahead have already received the message and are all rushing over."

Luo Qingge and Jiang Shengyu, two core disciples, blocked their path. In addition, several elite disciples participated in the encirclement. Qin Ming had seen them in Luofu Immortal Town. Back then, Luo Qingge was the first to provoke Li Qingxu, and Li Qingyue then swung her sword, leading Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, and others to follow suit.

Luo Qingge, clad in blue, with a beautiful face and a radiant smile, said, "Junior Sister Li, I apologize, but you are truly too strong. Out of respect for you, we've decided to join forces and send you out."

Jiang Shengyu's expression was serious. He merely nodded, appearing quite stern.

Li Qingyue had no intention of conversing with them. Not wanting to waste a single moment, her five-colored short sword shot out, erupting with five kinds of radiance, covering the woodland ahead. With a crash, as if a giant had swung a massive hammer, the bamboo forest was engulfed. Li Qingyue's single sword strike blasted that area apart.

Luo Qingge and Jiang Shengyu simultaneously vanished, then reappeared not far away, activating their weapons to quickly block Li Qingyue.

"Junior Sister Li, I apologize!"

"Senior Sister Li, please excuse us. We're sending you away."

"Qingyue, I'm truly sorry. This concerns the Daoist struggle, and we can only send away the biggest threat: you." The last core disciple to arrive was Tang Xumi.

Li Qingyue withdrew her five-colored sword, standing still amidst the white mist-shrouded bamboo forest. Now that she was surrounded, gaining time was meaningless.

Qin Ming stood with her, his great spear subtly emitting Heavenlight. This would definitely be a bloody battle; all those who came were experts. Tang Xumi, Jiang Shengyu, Ren Yiping, Su Jingshu, and Luo Qingge—all core disciples—surrounded Li Qingyue. Additionally, some elite disciples were spread around, and further away, there were even more golden-armored guards.

"Were the disciples who favor me blocked by you in advance?" Li Qingyue asked. Qin Ming felt that the path they took to enter was likely deliberately arranged.

Li Qingyue calmly looked at them and said, "It seems my immediate encounter with Li Qingxu was not a coincidence."

"It was naturally a coincidence!" responded Ren Yiping, a core disciple with a faint smile on his face. Even if there was something fishy about it, no one would admit it.

Qin Ming didn't understand much about the Outer Lands, but he could sense that the competition among core disciples was exceptionally fierce, stopping at nothing. Li Qingyue, simply because of her extraordinary strength, posed a severe threat to other core disciples. Even someone like Tang Xumi, who had a good impression of her, chose to act against her at this critical moment. For core disciples like him, things like good impressions or devastating beauty could be temporarily set aside; they were far less important than achieving near-immortality themselves.

Li Qingyue spoke, "Let my cousin leave first. He is not from Beyond the Mortal Realm."

Qin Ming's heart skipped a beat. These core disciples wouldn't really try to kill Li Qingyue, would they? His Heavenlight Strength circulated, and he gripped his Hegemon's Spear tightly.

Ren Yiping and Su Jingshu wanted to say something, but Tang Xumi spoke first: "Alright, Brother Li, this is a decisive battle between our core disciples from the Outer Lands. Don't get involved. Although you led me on a wild chase for over a hundred li, which made me very angry, we've met, after all."

"You leave first." Li Qingyue spoke, seemingly discerning Qin Ming's worry. She secretly transmitted a message with a secret art: "I can protect myself!"

Qin Ming took a deep breath. He had only embarked on the Nascent Path a few months ago and was a full major realm below the core disciples. He felt a bit vexed with himself, unable to help here. He said nothing, holding his long spear, and strode towards the distance.

In an instant, within this pure white bamboo forest, multi-colored mists erupted, immortal fog surged, divine light rampaged, and consciousness power expanded, seemingly warping space. The bamboo forest shattered as the six core disciples engaged in a decisive battle, showing no quarter, giving their all.

Qin Ming had barely walked out of the bamboo forest when he was stopped by several individuals, all golden-armored guards. Clearly, Tang Xumi's words had no effect. He looked back but could no longer see Li Qingyue. However, he could sense the immense commotion deep within the bamboo forest—five core disciples were besieging her alone.

"Do you intend to capture me as well?" he asked in a deep voice, gripping his great spear.

"Yes!" Someone spoke, just a simple word.

"Do you even intend to kill me?" Qin Ming's brows furrowed deeply. He was worried about Li Qingyue. None of the golden-armored guards present responded.

Qin Ming elevated himself to his strongest state, as if a raging inferno burned within his chest. In an instant, he charged out, his great spear cutting through the air like a bolt of lightning. With a bang, the person who had simply uttered "Yes" to him was lifted off the ground and sent flying backward. Before the person could land, Qin Ming caught up, his spear blade glinting with cold light. He pierced and burst one of the guard's hands, then thrust the spear into the golden armor through the ruptured hand.

In an instant, the golden-armored guard shrieked. His entire arm shattered, and an inexplicable Heavenlight Strength surged from his arm into his internal organs. Splatter! His entire body exploded within his armor. Qin Ming held his great spear, gave it a slight flick, and the golden armor flew off, smashing against a rock, its blood staining the area.

With a boom, the ground not far away shattered. A person who had cultivated a special strength art, radiating terrifying Heavenlight that extended half a meter from their body, seemed to instantly appear before him. Qin Ming gripped the Hegemon's Spear with both hands and chopped down, but two other charging individuals blocked it with their weapons. With a bang, Qin Ming clashed with the charging person using one hand, letting out a muffled groan. That tall youth, with Heavenlight extending over half a meter from his body, was very strong, possessing a unique strength art. Although Qin Ming's qi and blood churned, his palms didn't stop, continuously striking and colliding with the person's fists over a dozen times. With a 'Pfft!', the tall youth's fist, cultivated with a special strength art, shattered. He cried out in agony, attempting to retreat, only to find his entire arm exploding. Terrifying Heavenlight spread, tearing his internal organs to shreds.

"Kill!" Qin Ming roared.

Just then, a brawny youth emerged from the bamboo forest and said, "Need a hand?"
