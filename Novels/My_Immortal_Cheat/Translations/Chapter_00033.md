**Chapter 33: Sit Down!**

"Could it be this time...?" Zhou Tian vaguely felt a premonition in his heart.

"That's right! Three years ago, The Fools spread news that the 'Mandate' of the Ninth Continent was about to emerge!" Zhou Zui slowly explained, recalling his own shock when his father first told him. "The major powers of the Eight Continents don't actually have a dire need for the 'Mandate' right now, but they're unwilling to just watch others take it. So, they decided to make the 'Mandate' the ultimate goal and grand prize of this event!"

"No matter how you perform in the early stages, whoever claims this 'Mandate' will be declared the victor, and the 'Mandate' itself is the reward!"

Zhou Tian remained silent for a long time, then sighed, "What a grand gesture!" After a moment, he added, "Isn't this just prepared for me?"

"Pfft..." Zhou Zui spat out the fish he was eating, staring wide-eyed at Zhou Tian!

"Big Brother, you're just a mortal... well, it's hard to say now..." Zhou Zui had originally intended to mock him, but remembering how Zhou Tian had resurrected twice before his eyes just a few days ago, he swallowed the "mortal" part of his sentence.

Just then, a bell chime resounded through the void, passing through layers of sound-insulating formations to reach their ears.

Zhou Zui and Zhou Tian exchanged a glance, speaking in unison, "The Heaven-Suppressing Bell!"

The Heaven-Suppressing Bell was a royal artifact, only used on significant occasions, signaling that the banquet was about to begin!

"Alright, the banquet is about to start. It's time to go home and change clothes," Zhou Tian said, rising. He then added to Zhou Zui, "Sit down!"

"???" Zhou Zui looked bewildered. What was that?

Zhou Tian repeated, "Sit down!"

"What do you mean?" Zhou Zui was utterly confused. Sit down? Make me sit here? Why? On what grounds?

Zhou Tian sighed again and said, "Sit down!"

An esoteric fluctuation descended, of which Zhou Zui remained completely unaware, still looking utterly lost.

A smile appeared on Zhou Tian's face. He took Tian Ling's hand and walked out. *Little rascal... you think by swallowing the 'mortal' part, I wouldn't hear your mockery?*

Outside the door, Tian Ling innocently asked, "Zhou Tian, why did you tell him to sit down three times?"

"Because... important things must be said three times!" Zhou Tian chuckled. Tian Ling looked confused, not understanding what he meant.

Inside the room, Zhou Zui had just regained his composure. He shook his head and chuckled, feeling that his friend was becoming increasingly eccentric. *Sit down?*

"Hmm...?" Zhou Zui exerted some force, but couldn't stand up... A flicker of doubt crossed his face.

A faint rainbow light flashed over his body, and he tried again... still couldn't stand up... It was as if some force was pinning him to the spot!

Zhou Zui's brows furrowed deeply. What was going on?

"Hoo-ah!" He let out a low roar, energy surging throughout his body, runes flashing, and vital essence soaring into the sky. A phantom image resembling a scroll appeared behind him—this was his Dharma Aspect. Chants resounded, an aura of scholarly arts emerged, blessed by a hundred sages, and the void trembled...

The special effects were impressive, but... he still couldn't get up.

His Dharma Aspect dissipated, and Zhou Zui gave a wry smile. "My dear brother, you're truly becoming more and more unfathomable!"

He now understood that his current predicament was likely caused by Zhou Tian.

"To seal a Dharma Aspect realm expert in place with just three sentences... if you were a mortal, what would I do?" Zhou Zui wasn't worried that Zhou Tian meant him harm. If Zhou Tian had ill intentions, he wouldn't have said "sit down"; he would have said "kill yourself"!

Indeed, Zhou Tian had just used a newly learned skill, [Sacred Word], to pin Zhou Zui in place. He had failed twice, so he had to consume one resurrection charge to successfully cast it. He reasoned he wouldn't need that charge anyway.

As for the duration, Zhou Tian had no idea, just like the success rate of [Sacred Word]. He could only leave it to fate.

Leaving the Heavenly Dance Pavilion, they boarded a carriage and headed straight for Prince Qin's Estate.

Back at Prince Qin's Estate, Zhou Tian changed into formal attire: a white robe with dragon patterns, a purple-gold crown to tie up his hair, cloud-patterned sky-treading boots, and a python-dragon devouring-heaven waist belt. After putting it all on, Zhou Tian realized he could actually look so handsome!

Tian Ling also changed into an evening gown. Her long purple dress was embroidered with phoenix patterns, her long hair was tied up, revealing her delicate collarbones. Without any makeup, she was already a peerless beauty.

The maidservants of Prince Qin's Estate, having received specialized training, dressed the two perfectly, making them look like a pair of golden boy and jade girl.

Zhou Tian's face showed an expression of awe, and he let out an exaggerated compliment, "Which heavenly maiden has descended to the mortal realm!"

"Oh, stop..." Tian Ling said shyly, but a happy smile still bloomed on her face.

Once ready, the two boarded the carriage again. This time, they weren't going to the Imperial Palace but to the city gate.

The banquet wouldn't start until evening; now was the time to welcome back those who had been fighting outside!

The main city gate was already under martial law. The city walls of the Heavenly Qin Imperial Capital were nearly ten thousand zhang high, like a natural chasm, built from grey stone blocks, stained with blood, and echoing with the roars of beast souls, giving them a heavy and tragic aura.

Below the city wall was a special teleportation array that could directly transport people to the city gate tower. Several golden-armored guards stood guard—these were the Imperial Guards. After showing their identities, Zhou Tian and Tian Ling were teleported to the city gate tower.

The city wall was a hundred zhang wide, immensely broad. Every so often, there was an encampment belonging to the city wall defenders. The city gate tower itself was even more magnificent, with several stone pillars reaching into the sky. These were no ordinary stone pillars; golden blood still remained on them, belonging to some unknown creature, still un-dried after countless years.

Many people had already gathered below the tower. Leading them was Emperor Qin, dressed in his imperial robe, his aura like a rainbow, akin to a great sun. Behind him stood the most important court officials: Prince Qin (Zhou Tian's father), Prince Xiaoyao, Chancellor Liu, the Imperial Censors, the National Preceptor, and several generals—all crucial figures in the imperial court. Zhou Tian only recognized a few; most of them he didn't know.

"Your humble subject pays respects to Your Majesty!" Zhou Tian, leading Tian Ling, greeted Emperor Qin. His father had told him that if he didn't want to be lambasted to death by the Imperial Censors, it was best to pay attention to etiquette in public.

"You may rise!" Emperor Qin waved his hand.

Zhou Tian led Tian Ling to one side, joining a group of people distinct from the ministers—all young individuals. Zhou Xunchuan, Liu Yan, Gu Feng, and Li Xuanyi were all there, along with a few others Zhou Tian didn't recognize. Seeing Zhou Tian arrive, Zhou Xunchuan smiled. "Prince Qin's Heir is finally here! You've kept us waiting."

The others also nodded at him. No one looked down on him for being a mortal; at least, they didn't give anyone a chance to gossip.

"Third Prince, you jest. I'm not the last one to arrive," Zhou Tian said, hinting at someone else.

"Indeed, Prince Xiaoyao's Heir hasn't arrived yet," Zhou Xunchuan acknowledged, then looked at Zhou Tian. "Does Prince Qin's Heir know where he is?"

"Hmph, where else could he be? He's definitely at the Heavenly Dance Pavilion!" Liu Yan scoffed, her pretty face filled with frost, red flames burning in her eyes, raising the temperature of the surroundings by several degrees. She and Zhou Zui were always at odds; the story behind their conflict was quite intriguing. It was said that someone in the imperial capital had written a book about their story and made a fortune, though the names in the book were not the real ones. The book, however, soon disappeared.
