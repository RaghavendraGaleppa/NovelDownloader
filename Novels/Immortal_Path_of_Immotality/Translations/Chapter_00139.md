# Chapter 138: The Great War Between Righteous and Demonic Paths

After returning to the temporary headquarters of the three demonic sects, Lin Shan submitted his request to join the battle to Protector Yan.

Normally, as a "Cleansing Altar Envoy," he wouldn't need to go to the front lines—staying in the rear providing logistical support would suffice. However, this offensive into the heart of the Great Song Dynasty targeted the three dominant righteous sects that had ruled for a thousand years, so every available hand was needed.

His request was quickly approved, and Lin Shan was assigned to the Ninth Division of the Central Theater, under the command of Captain Yan Yuanchun.

To ensure unity and prevent internal sabotage during the war, the three demonic sects had established a Joint Command led by nine Nascent Soul cultivators. 

From the Black Lotus Sect, three of the six Dharma Kings had arrived; from the Blood River Hall, three of the five Hall Masters were present; and from the Hundred Ghosts Sect, three of its four Ghost Kings had gathered. 

The nine Nascent Soul elders held their final strategic meeting in the Joint Command, confirming battle plans, logistics, communications, intelligence, and troop deployments. The grand mobilization ceremony would begin the following day.

"Report! The last rebel forces in the Yunshan Sea have been eliminated—the entire Eastern Sea is now pacified!"

"Withdraw the garrison."

"Report! A Hundred Ghosts Sect protector escorting supplies through Yan Country was ambushed by local sects—most of the goods were stolen!"

"Execute him for incompetence!"

"Report! The Turtle Sage has disappeared from the Xiayi Sea—suspected to have fled to the outer seas."

"Ignore him."

"Report! The Eastern Sea's rogue Nascent Soul cultivator, Pure Lotus Hermit, has left Bitter Needle Island—destination unknown."

"Monitor closely."

"Report! The Jiaoren Clan from the Stormy Sea demands an explanation for why we injured their vassal, the Water Bear Chieftain!"

The Nascent Soul elders erupted in fury, their auras surging as their robes billowed without wind. The reporting disciples trembled in fear.

"The Jiaoren Clan? What nonsense is this? What's the strongest among them, daring to lecture the three demonic sects?"

"T-their strongest is at Core Formation mid-stage... their Grand Elder, I believe..."

"Send a late-stage Core Formation protector to teach them a harsh lesson! If they still dare to spout insolence, exterminate them!"

"Y-yes, my lords!"

The next day, the square of the temporary headquarters was shrouded in demonic energy that dyed the surrounding hundred miles. 

The sea churned violently, monstrous birds shrieked overhead, and fish leaped frantically in the waters. Lightning flickered ominously within dark clouds, its thunderous cracks punctuating the rhythmic pounding of war drums.

Tens of thousands of cultivators stood shoulder-to-shoulder, their fervent gazes fixed on the nine Nascent Soul elders on the platform as one of them passionately read the declaration of war. Countless demonic lanterns illuminated the square.

"Today, the people of Great Song suffer under oppression, having endured the righteous sects' tyranny for too long!"

"The Violet Firmament Sect wields power autocratically, imposing its will unchecked. Our ancestors' legacy has been defiled, and the realm trembles in fear!"

"The three demonic sects now act as Heaven's executioners! We shall crush the wicked, nurture the virtuous, and marshal our strength to eradicate the corrupt! The demonic path shall rise, its dark glory shining like a rainbow!"

"Today, our forces from the Eastern Sea divide into three fronts, united in purpose! We march to reclaim our lands and restore justice—extraordinary times demand extraordinary deeds!"

"Whoever first breaches Great Song's capital, Bianliang, shall be honored as an Elder of the Three Sects and rewarded with a million spirit stones! Righteous cultivators who defect shall be pardoned. Let this decree be known to all!"

The crowd raised their hands and roared in unison: "Reclaim our homeland! Conquer Bianliang!"

"Fight!"

"Fight!"

"Fight!"

The surging chants mingled with the glow of surrounding formations. Muscular demonic body cultivators pounded massive drums, their deafening beats stoking the crowd's bloodlust.

Thirty-six towering command platforms stood solemnly around the square, each flanked by orderly ranks bearing banners of blue, red, white, and black. Ritual vessels and offerings were arranged on the platforms, with attendants standing at attention like geese in flight, their armor and weapons gleaming.

Caught in the fervor, Lin Shan had no choice but to join the roaring masses.

The nine Nascent Soul elders exchanged satisfied nods, while the hundreds of Core Formation protectors beneath them chatted cheerfully. With such formidable forces and soaring morale, victory seemed assured.

After the military review and ceremonial rituals concluded, the Joint Command issued the order: full-scale assault!

---

On the third day of the third month, the three demonic sects launched their invasion of Great Song's heartland from all Eastern Sea coastlines, igniting the Great War Between Righteous and Demonic Paths.

Over 200,000 cultivators advanced along three fronts, though they boasted of a million-strong army.

The Joint Command divided the theaters: the Northern Theater under the Blood River Hall, the Central Theater under the Black Lotus Sect, and the Southern Theater under the Hundred Ghosts Sect. All three armies pushed inland, aiming to converge at Great Song's capital, Bianliang.

Wherever the demonic sects marched, resistance crumbled. 

The eight great cultivation clans of Jiangdong surrendered en masse, offering to guide the invaders. Five mid-sized righteous sects in Hebei defected, claiming they had long suffered under oppression and now pledged allegiance to the demonic path.

The Central Theater's Jianghuai region saw continuous victories. The Black Lotus Sect obliterated all who dared resist, annihilating sixteen cultivation clans and eight mid-sized sects while seizing over fifty spiritual mountains and blessed lands.

Over two months of campaigning with the main force, capturing one righteous stronghold after another, Lin Shan finally grasped the terrifying might of the three demonic sects.

A millennium ago, the eastern half of Great Song had been the demonic sects' domain. Many cultivation forces here had originally been their vassals, and now most defected back upon their return.

The three righteous sects' strongholds lay in the west, northwest, and southwest. After driving out the demonic forces, they had allowed these smaller eastern factions to survive—whether out of benevolence or pragmatism. Now, those same factions welcomed the demonic return with open arms. 

Demonic energy spread like wildfire, and war engulfed tens of thousands of miles.

Lin Shan's Ninth Division of the Central Theater, led by Core Formation Protector Yan Yuanchun, consisted of five Foundation Establishment envoys—all her original subordinates. Each, including Lin Shan, commanded a hundred Qi Condensation cultivators.

As locals with limited manpower and weaker forces, they were relegated to support roles while other divisions from the Black Lotus Sect's main branch in Lu Country took the lead. The main force boasted three Nascent Soul Dharma Kings, over a hundred Core Formation protectors, five hundred Foundation Establishment envoys, and a hundred thousand Qi Condensation demonic cultivators—and this was only half the sect's strength. The rest remained in Lu Country to guard against native Confucian and Daoist sects, showcasing how the demonic sects had flourished over the centuries.

Lin Shan and Yan Yuanchun's team spent their time trailing behind the frontlines or cleaning up battlefields, earning no merits and scarcely seeing any righteous cultivators.

The four Foundation Establishment female cultivators who had followed from Yichuan Market grew increasingly discontented. Luan Chun, spoiled by Protector Yan's favor, complained incessantly.

"Master! Other teams are capturing spiritual lands and slaying righteous cultivators, while we achieve nothing! Can't you get us transferred to the frontlines?"

Yan Yuanchun stroked Luan Chun's hair affectionately, advising patience. "Our division is too weak—we'd just be cannon fodder at the front. The Joint Command's arrangements consider the bigger picture."

But the spoiled girl kept pestering daily, grating on everyone's nerves, though none dared protest out of respect for Protector Yan.

By the ninth month, after half a year of relentless advance, the demonic offensive finally stalled at the Luosong Mountain Range, which divided Great Song north to south. The conflict entered a stalemate.

The mountain range separated Great Song's eastern and western regions, with only about a dozen passages connecting them—some were human-built passes, cities, or naval bases, others natural canyons, tunnels, or cursed burial grounds. The rest of the range was forbidden territory, teeming with countless monstrous beasts and even shape-shifting demonic creatures.

According to ancient pacts between human and demonkind, only these designated passages could be used for travel between east and west. Violating demonic territories would provoke their wrath—a risk the demonic armies couldn't afford.

The righteous sects, with their western strongholds, had spent these months mobilizing all remaining forces to fortify three defensive lines along the Luosong Mountains, finally halting the demonic advance. 

Beyond these mountains lay Bianliang, virtually undefended. The Joint Command now planned concentrated assaults to break through, knowing full well the first waves would suffer heavy casualties—a role destined for the locally recruited cannon fodder.

When Luan Chun finally got her wish—orders to the frontlines—she was stunned.

"Joint Command Directive: The Ninth Division of the Central Theater is to proceed to the Poison Burial Great Canyon as the vanguard assault force."

The Poison Burial Great Canyon was the passage closest to Bianliang. Breaking through here would place the imperial capital just a thousand miles away. 

According to intelligence, the three-thousand-mile-long canyon was perpetually shrouded in poisonous mist, teeming with venomous insects and toxic swamps. Even cultivators would struggle to survive without guides, let alone against the righteous sects' inevitable traps and ambushes.

"Report back to the Joint Command—we obey," Protector Yan said impassively, leading Lin Shan, Luan Chun, and the rest toward the frontlines.
