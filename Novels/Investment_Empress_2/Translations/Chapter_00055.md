# Chapter 55: Jiang Chulong, the Little Princess of the Yu Dynasty, the Golden Destiny!

Mu Ronghai’s pupils contracted slightly, momentarily stunned.

He had never imagined that a true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect could be outmatched by a wounded, notorious bandit.

If Xiao Xuan hadn’t been ambushed and caught off guard due to his lack of martial world experience, he would have won too.

The martial arts of major sect disciples form a complete system; they are inherently far superior to wandering martial artists or those from minor sects.

Li Mo wielded a mystic weapon and was definitely stronger than Xiao Xuan.

But... wasn’t this victory just too effortless?

There were almost no traces of a battle on the scene.

Even Xue Peng’s Blood Blade, which had made quite a name for itself, had been shattered into pieces.

“Old Master Mu Rong, you’ve arrived at just the right time.”

Li Mo casually tossed the Iron Swallow away and said:

“Please be so kind as to hand Xue Peng’s corpse over to the authorities.”

Once the government verified his identity, they would naturally notify the External Affairs Hall, saving him the trouble.

Carrying a corpse around was simply too disgusting to think about.

“Brother Li, you are truly formidable.”

After secretly comparing himself, Mu Rongxuan looked at him with full admiration.

Inner Qi is divided into three stages: Qi Condensation, Jade Liquid, and Profound Pill. Each level represents a different world.

He had sparred with a senior brother at the Qi Condensation stage. Even though his physique was strong, he still ended up at a disadvantage.

Even if Xue Peng was injured, he didn’t have the confidence to take him down.

“What is this thing? A hidden weapon?”

Mu Rongxuan picked up the Iron Swallow.

Before he could examine it clearly, he was slapped on the hand by Mu Ronghai.

“Silly boy, don’t just pick up any random thing you see.”

“This hidden weapon doesn’t look like it’s been poisoned...”

“This isn’t a hidden weapon; it’s a Hall Swallow.”

Mu Ronghai shook his head.

He furrowed his brows and explained the origin of the item.

His explanation was roughly the same as what Shang Wu had said.

“I don’t want to participate in any Purgatory Trial.”

Hearing this, Mu Rongxuan shrank his neck and didn’t even dare to look at the Iron Swallow.

“A season of many troubles.”

Mu Ronghai sighed, then looked at Li Mo, his expression softening.

“Those who receive a Hall Swallow from the Drizzle Building are all notoriously difficult and vicious characters.”

“Young Friend Li Mo was able to kill one so effortlessly; you truly deserve to be called a prodigy.”

As he spoke, he couldn’t help but feel a bit emotional.

“I wonder how astonishing the girl Ying Bing, who shares your fame, must be.”

“My achievements today are also thanks to the great benefits I gained from her.”

When Li Mo said this, he actually felt a bit of longing for the Ice Cube.

Two days.

Without the feedback notifications from the Ice Cube, Little Li felt as if something was missing.

Soon, the officials arrived and began to clean up the scene.

Every gaze directed at him was filled with awe and shock.

What were they doing at sixteen?

This young man had already flipped his hand and killed a Inner Qi realm fanatic with ease.

**[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Meng Can' and saving his life.]**

**[Investment Feedback: One Year of Martial Arts Comprehension.]**

Thinking of this, he looked towards the distance.

The little beggar named Meng Can stood there awkwardly, his eyes fixed on the rice bag that had fallen to the ground, yet he didn’t dare to go up and pick it up.

Li Mo chuckled, bent down to pick up the rice bag, and patted off the dust.

“Take it.”

“Great Benefactor Li, I didn’t know he was a fugitive...”

Meng Can trembled and didn’t dare to reach out.

However, the rice bag was placed in his arms by the young man.

“I was looking for Xue Peng anyway. If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have found him so quickly. You didn’t do anything wrong.”

“And don’t call me Great Benefactor Li, it sounds strange.”

Meng Can was stunned.

Seeing the young man’s sunny smile, he felt as if he were bathed in a warm spring breeze. He suddenly felt his eyes sting and hurriedly wiped them with his small hands, making his already dirty face even more wretched.

“Big Brother Li, you’re a good person, just like the Stuttering Sister.”

“The Stuttering Sister you mentioned, who is she? Can you take me to see her?”

Li Mo asked in a gentle voice.

Meng Can’s little face immediately became conflicted. After struggling for a moment, he said quietly:

“The Stuttering Sister told us not to tell outsiders about her, and not to bring strangers over.”

Hmm...

Li Mo thoughtfully pondered.

This cautious demeanor seemed like she was hiding from something.

Even if this ‘Stuttering Sister’ wasn’t the person the Ice Cube was looking for, she was probably no simple character.

She might be a suitable investment target.

“But she’s sick now, very sick.”

“Big Brother Li, can you save her?”

Meng Can grabbed onto this straw of hope as if he were a drowning man.

---

The Investment Genius Li Mo smiled.

“Coincidentally, I have excellent medical skills. I guarantee a cure with the medicine.”

The pills he had were all at least Sixth Pattern.

For external injuries, there was Hundred Flower Condensation Dew Ointment; for internal injuries, Five Elements Purple Spirit Pill; for detoxification, there was Decontaminating Pill... even for unmentionable ailments, there was Tiger Bone Yang Enhancement Wine.

Being able to cure any disease = Excellent medical skills.

No problem.

...

Mud Corner Alley.

The courtyard had been neglected for years, with several sections of the wall collapsed, giving off a sense of decay as if it were about to return to nature.

“Why isn’t Brother Can back yet?”

“Did something happen to him?”

“Old Hua Lian said there’s a benefactor giving out porridge and rice on the street today. I’m so hungry, sob sob...”

“Ah-ba, ah-ba.”

Several little kids with dirty faces and tattered clothes poked their heads out to look.

Just like the courtyard, which had no intact items, these little kids were also not normal children. Some were crippled, some missing an arm, some without a tongue and unable to speak.

“Little Can still isn’t back?”

A slightly older beggar, who had all his limbs intact, entered the gate, putting down the scrap metal and wild vegetables he had just collected.

The little kids shook their heads one after another, their eyes filled with confusion and helplessness.

“How is the Stuttering Sister’s condition?”

He asked again.

“She still has a fever. I just changed her wet cloth.”

“She was in pain for a while, but now she’s asleep.”

“Should we go find a doctor to take a look at the Stuttering Sister? She seems to be suffering...”

“A doctor costs at least a few taels of silver. We don’t have any money...”

“Ah-ba, ah-ba.”

Listening to their chatter.

The slightly older beggar raised his hand and carefully took out a small piece of yellowed salt from his怀里.

“You guys go start cooking first.”

As he spoke, he went into the room.

The little kids acted as if they had found a treasure, suddenly full of life, as if it were New Year’s. Someone went to get firewood, someone went to get a half-broken earthenware pot, and they busily started the fire.

Inside the room.

It was called a room, but it didn’t even have a door. Looking up, you could see the gloomy sky.

Lying on a pile of weeds was a fifteen or six-year-old female beggar. Her tattered clothes faintly showed they were originally light green. Her face was covered in mud and dirt, and her eyes were covered by a strip of cloth.

Hearing the footsteps, her ears twitched slightly.

“Stuttering Sister, it’s me. Are you feeling any better?”

“I... I’m fine... Don’t... worry about me.”

“Rest... for a bit... and I’ll be okay.”

Her hoarse voice came in broken sentences. Being sick now, a simple sentence seemed to take all the strength in her body.

“Then I won’t disturb you. I’ll call you when it’s time to eat.”

The little beggar sighed and turned to go out.

But before he could leave the room, he heard a voice from behind.

“You can’t... can’t go... stealing... things...”

“I know.”

Jiang Chulong finally breathed a little more steadily, curling up her body.

She was burning all over, yet she felt a chill coming from all directions.

Her chest, where once lay the source of her confidence, allowing her to faintly hear the sound of ten thousand swords humming, had now turned into an invisible abyss, slowly devouring her with endless emptiness.

“Am I... going to die?”

Jiang Chulong thought numbly.

She felt some sorrow, but the hunger and weakness left her without the strength to even feel love or hate.

When people die, can they see those they can never see again?

Mother...

Suddenly, there was a commotion at the entrance.

“Brother Can, you’re back!”

“Wow, it’s rice!”

“Who is this big brother? Why did you bring a stranger back?”

“He’s the great benefactor who gave us food. He can save the Stuttering Sister...”

As Meng Can was anxiously explaining.

Li Mo’s gaze passed over the group of little kids and saw the blindfolded little beggar lying in the dilapidated dwelling.

The moment his Destiny Eye scanned the other party.

His breath caught for an instant.
