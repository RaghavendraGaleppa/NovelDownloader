# Chapter 53: Han Li Reveals the Secret of the Little Green Bottle! (2/3)

"Senior Brother!" the female cultivator from Yellow Maple Valley cried anxiously.

"Enough! There's no need to say more. I still have use for this woman," Lin Yun said dismissively, unwilling to explain further to her.

He had just examined the map of the Moon-Masking Sect from Zhou Qingning's storage pouch and found no markings indicating the stone hall's location. Moreover, neither the map provided by the Chen family, the one from Tianque Fort's Feng Yue, nor the one from the Blade Transformation Valley showed any trace of the stone hall either.

This meant the stone hall was a secret discovery of the Moon-Masking Sect. To prevent exposure and avoid drawing attention from the other six sects, they had likely only disclosed its location to Nangong Wan. If word got out, it could lead to another "Moon Sun Pearl" incident, where the six sects would demand shared access.

Han Li had obtained his map leading to the stone hall from Spirit Beast Mountain's Zhong Wu. Tracking down Zhong Wu would be too troublesome, but fortunately, Lin Yun now had a suitable guide right in front of him.

Zhou Qingning possessed the Moon-Masking Sect's "Yin-Yang Attraction Technique." Similar to Yellow Maple Valley's "Binding Technique," it was more advanced—while it could track positions, its primary function was to enable male and female disciples to perform "joint-attack spells."

Lin Yun's decision left Han Li slightly puzzled. If it were him, he would have killed Zhou Qingning without hesitation to eliminate any future threats. 

But upon reflection, Han Li realized that Lin Yun's experience in Yellow Maple Valley was vastly different from his own. To Han Li, the sect was a cold and indifferent place, devoid of warmth or fairness—his Foundation Establishment Pill had been snatched away the moment he joined. 

Yet for Lin Yun, Yellow Maple Valley was a place where he could act with impunity. Blessed with extraordinary talent and backed by the Chen family, even Dong Xuan'er was infatuated with him. He had injured a Core Formation cultivator without facing retaliation, led an assault on the Hundred Mechanisms Hall, and even killed a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator while still in Qi Refinement. 

Lin Yun had no fear of any so-called "revenge" from the female cultivator—in fact, she should be grateful he spared her life.

*Sigh… The difference in status and position leads to entirely different perspectives and methods of handling things,* Han Li thought enviously.

The Yellow Maple Valley female cultivator's expression darkened.

*You're not killing her? Why didn’t you say so earlier?* 

*I’ve already lashed her with my whip and made an enemy for life! And now you tell me you’re sparing her?* 

*Are you deliberately setting me up?* 

*Snap!* Lin Yun flicked his fingers, and the restraints binding Zhou Qingning loosened. He then tossed her storage pouch back to her.

If she were to be killed on the way by other disciples because she lacked her magical tools, it would be troublesome.

Zhou Qingning stared at her returned storage pouch in disbelief. Not only had Lin Yun spared her, but he had also returned her belongings.

"Thank you, Senior Brother Lin!"

"Go on. Don’t forget your promise," Lin Yun said amiably, waving her off. "No hard feelings—consider this the start of a friendship. I, Lin Yun, never make things difficult for my friends."

"Thank you, Senior Brother Lin." After bowing again, Zhou Qingning snatched her pouch and fled.

*No need for thanks. We’ll meet again soon—whether I spare you next time is another matter.* Watching her retreating figure, Lin Yun smirked. *For now, I’ll let you live a little longer.*

**[Ding! Zhou Qingning has become your friend.]**  
**[Ding! Congratulations, host. You have obtained: Talisman Treasure—Qingning Mirror.]**

As for any thoughts of revenge, given Lin Yun’s standing in Yellow Maple Valley, Zhou Qingning wouldn’t dare.

"This Bloody Forbidden Land is too dangerous. I should regroup with my sect’s elders," Zhou Qingning muttered, shaken by her encounter with Lin Yun and fearful of running into other enemies.

The Yellow Maple Valley female cultivator also found a hiding spot and soon parted ways with Lin Yun and Han Li. She would have preferred to stay with Lin Yun, but he ignored her, and she had the sense to leave.

Nightfall.

Under the shelter of a towering tree, Lin Yun and Han Li lit a campfire. The flickering flames cast restless shadows across Han Li’s face, mirroring the unease in his pounding heart.

Meanwhile, Lin Yun emptied Feng Yue’s storage pouch, sifting through its contents for anything useful. Aside from a half-depleted Talisman Treasure, the rest was junk. 

His gaze then fell on the Cloud-Treading Boots. Since he already wore the Flowing Cloud Boots, these would be redundant—perhaps he could gift them to Han Li for a potential reward.

"Brother Lin, you saw the message in the Soul Fusion Talisman, didn’t you?" Han Li finally broke the silence.

Lin Yun met his eyes and nodded. "You mean that little green bottle of yours that can accelerate plant growth? I never expected you to possess such an extraordinary treasure."

"No wonder you’ve progressed so quickly despite your False Spiritual Roots. You must have been refining pills using spirit herbs nurtured by that bottle, right?"

"To be honest, I’ve known you had secrets since the day we met. Did you really think I’d be so kind without reason?"

"I just never imagined your secret would be this staggering."

Lin Yun poked at the fire, adding more wood. The motion reminded Han Li of his childhood, when his father would gather the family around the hearth after dinner to impart wisdom. Now, it was Lin Yun tending the flames.

"Then… you don’t want it?" Han Li pressed. "This little green bottle is a treasure capable of defying the heavens! With it, even ten-thousand-year spirit herbs are just a matter of time."

"Here in the Bloody Forbidden Land, a False Spiritual Root disciple like me could vanish without a trace, and no one would care."

Lin Yun watched the dancing flames. "Of course I want it. Who wouldn’t?"

Han Li took a deep breath and stood, meeting Lin Yun’s gaze squarely. "Brother Lin, I know I’m no match for you. But if you think I’ll surrender without a fight, you’re mistaken."

"Let’s settle this. The survivor takes the bottle."

Lin Yun studied Han Li’s stubborn yet fearful eyes—beneath the bravado, the younger man was trembling inside. Shaking his head, Lin Yun replied, "Forget it. What kind of elder brother would steal from his own kin?"

"Keep your treasure. If I’d wanted it, I wouldn’t have saved you from Feng Yue."

"After all, if you died, the bottle would’ve been mine anyway."

Han Li froze, lips pressed tight in disbelief. Lin Yun truly saw him as a younger brother. 

And he was right—if Lin Yun had coveted the bottle, he could have simply hesitated when Feng Yue attacked. Not only would he have gained the treasure, but he’d also have earned praise for avenging his "fallen junior."

Yet Lin Yun had chosen otherwise.

"Besides, you’re not the only one with secrets."

Han Li blinked. *That’s true! I’m a False Spiritual Root with four elements, while Brother Lin has the even worse Five Spiritual Roots. By all logic, his cultivation should be slower than mine.*

*Yet his progress is astonishingly fast—even my pill-assisted cultivation can’t keep up.*

"Brother Lin, then what’s your secret?" Han Li asked curiously.

"Though I have Five Spiritual Roots, I possess a unique constitution," Lin Yun explained. "I don’t know its name, but it allows me to absorb the spiritual energy and true essence of those around me. That’s why my cultivation advances so rapidly."

"Otherwise, why do you think I go to such lengths to befriend people left and right?"

"So that’s it!" Han Li’s doubts were finally resolved. No wonder Lin Yun was so sociable.

"Brother Lin, if you ever need any spirit herbs accelerated, just ask. I’ll help you," Han Li declared, thumping his chest.

Having laid his cards on the table, Han Li felt a weight lift from his shoulders.

"Haha, of course! You’re my brother—I won’t hold back." Lin Yun laughed, clapping Han Li’s shoulder.

He then handed over the Cloud-Treading Boots and a dark-glowing shield.

"Here, take these. That guy had some decent gear."

"Also, I noticed you’re still using the Earth Yuan Shield. I assume your other defensive artifacts were destroyed. This Black Iron Shield isn’t top-tier, but it’s a fine high-grade artifact—infused with a trace of refined iron. Just a bit more, and it would’ve been a supreme-grade treasure."

"I can’t protect you every moment in the Bloody Forbidden Land."

"Immortal cultivation is perilous. Learn to safeguard yourself."
