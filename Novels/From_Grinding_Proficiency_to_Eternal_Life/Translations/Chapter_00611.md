# Chapter 611: First Full-Power Strike

He didn't even spare a glance at Sun Yue's corpse on the ground. His figure blurred instantly.

Just before the formation was detonated and completely collapsed, his left hand made a grasping motion in the void. Ye Xuan, who had been lying on the ground after Zhang Qiaoluo partially removed her restraints, was drawn up by an invisible flash of lightning.

Xu Yunfan grabbed her by the collar. Together with Ye Xuan, he instantly transformed into a blinding青紫 (cyan-purple) thunder light, his speed reaching its absolute limit. He followed the chaotic spiritual energy channels blasted open by the disintegrating formation and charged wildly toward the exit of the canyon.

Behind him, Ye Yuan's eyes narrowed. He clearly hadn't expected his opponent's escape technique to be so fast, nor that the escape light contained such potent causal interference power, causing him to be momentarily distracted.

A chilling gleam pierced through the clouds in Ye Yuan's eyes as his icy gaze locked firmly onto the fleeing light ahead.

Xu Yunfan had wrapped himself in an invisible net formed by three layers of causal secrets. His figure flickered in and out of existence within the thunder light, appearing both real and illusory.

However, as a Core Formation perfection expert and an elder of the Wansheng Sword Sect's Tianji Peak, Ye Yuan's sword heart perception far surpassed that of ordinary cultivators. The aura of Ye Xuan's bloodline was like the Big Dipper in the dark night, still clearly and intensely detectable even across a hundred miles of void.

"Can your escape speed be faster than my sword soul's resonance?!" Ye Yuan's voice, like the grinding of metal and iron, pierced through the clouds amidst his vast sword light.

His body merged with his sword, and a platinum sword rainbow tore through the sky, increasing his speed by another thirty percent.

Wherever the sword light passed, the sea of clouds was ruthlessly split apart, and the mountains and rivers below rapidly retreated into blurred patches of color.

Ahead, Xu Yunfan clearly felt the piercing sensation of being locked on growing stronger and stronger.

*What's going on? Am I that good at drawing aggro?*

Xu Yunfan glanced at the Ye Xuan in his hand and realized that Ye Yuan must be relentlessly pursuing them for her sake.

At this moment, Ye Xuan slowly awakened in his grasp. When she saw the situation around her and sensed the sword light behind them getting closer and closer, a cold sneer curled at the corner of her mouth.

"Fool. Our Ye family's bloodlines are connected. Under the resonance of the Yaoguang Sword Soul, your pathetic causal secrets are nothing more than a child playing with fire in front of my uncle!"

Her voice wasn't loud, but each word was like a needle, piercing directly into Xu Yunfan's mind.

These words suddenly enlightened him.

He glanced at Ye Xuan and said calmly, "You truly are as stupid as a pig. It's no wonder Zhang Qiaoluo was able to get a hold of you."

Ye Xuan was stunned, then immediately realized she had just revealed the底 (bottom line/trump card) of the Ye family's bloodline to Xu Yunfan.

She let out a cold laugh. "Just wait. You won't even be able to enter the cycle of reincarnation for daring to touch a disciple of my Wansheng Sword Sect."

Xu Yunfan's expression remained calm, but his mind was racing.

*Should I abandon Ye Xuan?*

The thought was extinguished as soon as it arose. Once he lost this hostage, the Ye family swordsman behind him, who possessed a fierce sword intent and unparalleled combat prowess among his peers, would have no more reservations. He would attack with the full, thunderous force of his might, and the consequences would be unimaginable.

Moreover, the coordinates of a界天 (界 Heaven/Realm) that had not yet been exposed were tied to Ye Xuan. She was the key bait for their entire operation.

If possible, he really didn't want to abandon Ye Xuan.

*Should I give it a try?*

Xu Yunfan let out a quiet breath. All this time, he had never truly used his ultimate trump card or fought with his full power.

"Shut up!"

Xu Yunfan roared lowly. The Shenxiao spiritual power within his Dantian surged violently, and the thunder light surrounding him suddenly暴涨 (exploded/grew), forcibly pulling the distance between them apart by another hundred miles.

His mind raced as he calculated the coordinates of the realm Ye Xuan had mentioned.

Although Ye Yuan might know that Ye Xuan held a secret, he absolutely could not know the details. This was the only gap for survival!

Otherwise, he would never have pursued Ye Xuan to this extent.

While one fled and the other chased, the terrain below changed from continuous mountain ranges to a vast body of water.

The dark blue sea surface churned with huge waves. The intense Primordial Yin-Water Essence rose and collided with the violent Nine Heavens Gale, creating a chaotic and disordered energy field.

This was precisely why Xu Yunfan had chosen to escape into the East Sea.

The extremity of the East Sea was a place of chaotic spiritual energy within the Taohua Lingxu World, a world shaped like a square sky and round earth. Many rogue cultivators who had committed heinous deeds hid here.

"BOOM!"

The sword's cry was like a thunderclap from the nine heavens. A magnificent sword aura cut across dozens of miles of sea, splitting the ten-thousand-zhang waves.

It was still Ye Yuan's signature technique.

*Yaoguang Splits the Sea!*

The sword intent drew upon the power of the Big Dipper, carrying a domineering force capable of severing heaven and earth, locking onto Xu Yunfan's back.

In the nick of time!

But see Xu Yunfan's figure contorting in an impossible manner, as if merging into an invisible spatial fold.

The platinum sword light grazed past the corner of his robe, tearing the sleeve with a "tearing" sound, and its momentum didn't减 (decrease) as it plunged into the deep sea.

In an instant, the sea surface was depressed into a terrifyingly huge pit, which was then blasted open by the inrushing seawater, kicking up a murky waterspout that blotted out the sky and sun.

"Hm?"

A sound of surprise escaped Ye Yuan's mouth.

The figure, brimming with sword energy that pierced the heavens, solidified abruptly a hundred zhang away.

He never expected that a Core Formation mid-stage disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, who primarily relied on formations and causal secrets, could so precisely evade the locking sword intent he had斩 (slashed) out in anger.

In the mist, Xu Yunfan stood calmly on the waves. The sea surface beneath his feet was instantly frozen solid like a mirror under the suppression of his immense spiritual power.

He restrained Ye Xuan in a water cage beside him with a backhanded motion, then grasped with his right hand in the void. An ancient, unadorned sword wreathed in fine purple arcs of lightning appeared out of thin air.

*Zhenwu Sword.*

Facing Ye Yuan's piercing gaze that seemed to penetrate the void, Xu Yunfan's lips curled into a cold sneer, as if he had been underestimated.

"Daoist Ye, there is no need to look down on me so. The Wansheng Sword Sect's 'Yaoguang Breaks the Sea' is indeed unrivaled in its domineering power under the heavens."

The Zhenwu Sword in his hand hummed and trembled, its tip pointing directly at Ye Yuan as sparks of lightning flew. "But this sword strike, I, Xu Yunfan, can still take it."

As his words fell, the Primordial Yin-Water Essence within a ten-mile radius was stirred by the *Shenxiao Jiuchen Xuanqiong Bumie Zhenjing* within his body, transforming into surging undercurrents of Yin-Water Thunder that swirled around him.

Between the sea and the sky, thunder and sword intent stood in opposition across the void.

Ye Yuan remained silent and swung his sword once more.

As Ye Yuan's platinum sword rainbow, infused with the true meaning of Yaoguang Splits the Sea, came rolling down like a galaxy, tearing through layer upon layer of sea mist to strike, a sharp light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. He no longer dared to hold anything back.

"Come, Sword!"

In the clear shout, the ancient, unadorned Zhenwu Sword, wreathed in fine purple arcs of lightning, rang out from his hand.

"Thunderstrike·Shatter the Firmament!"

Xu Yunfan gripped the sword with both hands and thrust it forward resolutely.

The Zhenwu Sword instantly transformed into a thousand-zhang紫电 (purple lightning) Thunder Dragon, its horns forged from condensed golden sword qi, and its scales formed from flickering Shenxiao玄雷 (mystic thunder).

Wherever the Thunder Dragon passed, the sky was scorched with black marks. It was the ultimate killing move, using thunder to control the sword, and the sword to control the Dao.

This was a collision between pure法剑 (Dharma Sword) and pure sword intent aura.

"BOOM!!!"

The platinum sword rainbow and the紫电 Thunder Dragon collided violently.

Two completely different powers frantically collided and annihilated each other.

The Yaoguang sword intent carried the fierce and domineering power to sever the starry sea, while the Shenxiao spiritual power surging within the Thunder Dragon drew upon the myriad phenomena of heaven and earth, hiding the vast power of the Heavenly Thunder within.

The stalemate lasted only a moment before the sword aura and thunder light simultaneously exploded.

The terrifying shockwave pressed down on the sea surface below, carving out a ten-mile-wide巨坑 (giant pit). Steaming, scorching water vapor mixed with fine electric snakes shot into the sky, and the blinding explosion of light made the entire sea as bright as day.
