## Chapter 14: The Valley

The valley was shrouded in mist, with stars twinkling above. The chill in the air seeped into one's bones, making one's teeth chatter. Sitting on a stone, Li Zhi Ming gazed at his hands, which had turned red and purple. He suppressed a sob, feeling a pang of homesickness. 

Han Li sat beside him, holding a steaming hot bun. "Thanks for today," he said, looking at Li Zhi Ming with a hint of embarrassment. If not for Li Zhi Ming, he wouldn't have been able to enter the valley. 

Li Zhi Ming forced a smile, revealing his big, buck teeth. He took the bun from Han Li and began to devour it, savoring the warmth spreading through his tongue. 

As they sat under the trees, the two boys chatted about their lives. Han Li mentioned that he was from a remote mountain village and was called "Er Leng Zi" (Second Fool). Li Zhi Ming reassured him that he wasn't foolish at all. 

Han Li smiled, his eyes crinkling at the corners. He mentioned that his body was weak and that he might not pass the assessments. Li Zhi Ming nodded in agreement, having similar concerns.

The night grew colder, and Han Li suggested they return to their quarters to rest. Li Zhi Ming agreed, and they headed back to their makeshift home, a small room that seemed to be a converted storage shed. 

The room was cozy, with a fire pit and a bed that they had to share. Despite the cramped quarters, they soon fell asleep.

The next morning, Li Zhi Ming woke up to find Han Li gone, but a cold bun remained. He washed up and ate the bun, marveling at how well the medicine had worked overnight. 

As he strolled to the front yard, he saw Han Li standing with Mo Da Fu (Ink Doctor), reciting a "medicine song". The lyrics seemed nonsensical to Li Zhi Ming, but Han Li was determined to memorize them.

Mo Da Fu's gaze fell upon Li Zhi Ming, and he quickly scurried away. 

Li Zhi Ming remembered his task to tend to the medicinal fields and headed out to inspect them. The fields were extensive, with various types of herbs growing. Despite his lack of experience, he dove into the work.

As the sun began to set, Mo Da Fu appeared behind him, watching him work. Li Zhi Ming felt a shiver run down his spine and tried to hide. Mo Da Fu observed him for a while before walking away.

Han Li appeared with a book, inquiring if Li Zhi Ming knew how to manage the fields. Li Zhi Ming suggested they take it one step at a time. As they spoke, Li Zhi Ming couldn't help but glance at Mo Da Fu, who seemed to command respect.

With a newfound interest, Li Zhi Ming decided to examine Mo Da Fu's "ming ge" (life pattern).
