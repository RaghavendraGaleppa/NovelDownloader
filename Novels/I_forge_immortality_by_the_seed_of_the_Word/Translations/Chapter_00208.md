**Chapter 205: Greetings, Senior Disciple Brother**

"Junior Disciple Brother, this is the Three-Light Peachtree! You actually managed to grow it, and its growth is astonishing!"

"What impressive skill!"

At the center of the immortal island, Qinghe pointed at the half-human-tall sapling, shimmering with three-colored spiritual light, and exclaimed in surprise.

At this moment, the other two also looked in the direction Qinghe was pointing, their gazes constantly shifting between the Three-Light Peachtree and the Seven Treasures Gourd Vine, which had also sprouted.

This was Xuan Yuan and the others' second visit to Zhang Jing's immortal island. They hadn't expected that the Immortal Root seed of the Three-Light Peachtree would actually be cultivated by this Junior Disciple Brother Zhang Jing. What's more, he had also successfully grown another Immortal Root. Although they couldn't identify the specific type for now, its aura alone indicated it was no less valuable than the Three-Light Peachtree.

Thinking of this, envy welled up in all three of their hearts. Aside from the astonishing effects of immortal root spiritual plants, simply selling them would fetch immense goodwill and fortune. Having stepped onto the path of immortality for so many years, they naturally understood that every immortal root spiritual plant was a crucial resource on the immortal path, truly a 'money tree', incredibly precious. It was simply that their growing conditions were excessively harsh; only one in ten thousand could successfully cultivate them. This was also why, among the numerous disciples of the Dao Sect, living immortal roots were exceptionally valuable, while immortal root seeds were worth considerably less.

"Haha, Junior Disciple Brother hardly deserves such praise. This is all thanks to Lu Sanshiba; it's naturally adept at this," Zhang Jing explained with a smile from the other side.

As his voice fell, three pairs of eyes immediately landed on Lu Sanshiba, their scorching intensity seeming to ignite it. Feeling these gazes, Lu Sanshiba's face instantly showed a hint of embarrassment, and it quietly hid behind Zhang Jing. However, its enormous head, no matter how hard it tried, simply couldn't be concealed.

"Junior Disciple Brother is truly fortunate~" a sigh suddenly rose, carrying an undeniable complexity in its tone.

At this moment, even Xuan Yuan, whose cultivation had reached the Dharma Aspect Realm, couldn't help but feel a stir in his heart. Just how much fortune did this Junior Disciple Brother possess? It felt as if, by some unseen force, every good thing simply landed in his lap... His astonishing talent was one thing, but to also have a mount 'skilled' in cultivating immortal root spiritual plants?!

Xuan Yuan knew very well. His Junior Disciple Brother had just been humble; the white deer's ability to cultivate spiritual plants was far beyond mere 'adeptness'. Did he think immortal roots were cabbages? Could anyone just plant them if they were 'adept'? Moreover, the Three-Light Peachtree's growth rate was perhaps a little too fast. Imperceptibly, Xuan Yuan had internally elevated his regard for Junior Disciple Brother Zhang Jing to the highest level!

Astonishing talent.
Highly valued by a True Monarch.
Possessing a white deer mount capable of even inducing immortal roots to grow.

"Talent, background, and even the resources he controls are all terrifyingly vast. This Junior Disciple Brother's future is unimaginable," Xuan Yuan mused.

...

Time slowly flowed.
Silence returned to the immortal island.

Inside the cultivation chamber.

"Immortal Root Azure Fall Fruit, Geng Metal Dragon-Patterned Sword Bamboo, Immortal Root Longevity Pine—the three Senior Disciple Brothers were truly generous." Zhang Jing's face showed a faint smile as he looked at Lu Sanshiba, who was beaming with excitement, and gently instructed, "Sanshiba, make sure to take good care of these three immortal root seeds. They are for your master's cultivation, and yours too, in the future."

"Master, don't worry, I have the Wondrous Natural Embryo Treasury Realm," Lu Sanshiba replied with a grin. "The more immortal roots there are, the better and faster they'll grow!"

Not long after, watching Lu Sanshiba's cheerful retreating figure, the introductions from the three Senior Disciple Brothers earlier seemed to echo faintly in Zhang Jing's ears. A trace of curiosity immediately flickered in his eyes.

"What secrets does this Immortal Lake Secret Realm hold exactly? All three of these immortal root seeds, plus the previous Three-Light Peachtree, came from within it?"

"I should find some time to go and take a look."

Just as Lu Sanshiba had said, the existence of its bloodline divine ability, Wondrous Natural Embryo Treasury Realm, meant that the more immortal roots there were, the greater the harvest would be. Perhaps one day, he might even have an immortal root spiritual plant garden in his possession.

At that time, would he still have to worry about fortune? Zhang Jing thought with some anticipation.

He was currently worried sick about his fortune. While the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability possessed terrifying power, its upgrade cost in fortune was a bottomless pit. Zhang Jing estimated that the nearly four billion fortune he currently had on hand would probably be just enough to upgrade the Twenty-Four Heavens into a Dharma Seed. A mere Ninth-grade divine ability, or at best an Eighth-grade, had such a terrifying upgrade cost. What about the Grand Pure Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade, which was 'eagerly awaiting feeding'? Wouldn't its upgrade cost be an astronomical figure? Not to mention the Primordial Realm skill, which had an even more terrifying experience requirement and which he couldn't afford not to upgrade...

Moreover, within the legacy of the Derived World, there were nine other grand divine abilities to cultivate in the Golden Core Realm. The thought of all this made Zhang Jing's scalp tingle.

"Sigh~ fortune!"

With a sigh, he instantly snapped back to reality. A golden light flashed in his hand, and the VIP Golden Talisman of the All-Worlds Auction House reappeared.

Forget it, he wouldn't think about those for now. As the saying goes, "You might search high and low and still not find it, but when the cart reaches the mountain, there will always be a path." The top priority was to quickly upgrade the Twenty-Four Heavens Divine Ability to an Immortal Seed.

With a thought, the Golden Talisman immediately glowed brilliantly.

...
Cosmic River Gold Crystal (Three jins and eight liang)
Note: ...
Current Bid Price: 793,000,000
Buy-It-Now Price: 1,500,000,000
Remaining Auction Time: Two months and thirteen days
...

"You're the one!" A look of determination flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. Now that he had verified the powerful effects of the Cosmic River Gold Crystal, he naturally wouldn't hold back.

...

Meanwhile, outside the immortal island, three figures suddenly halted.

Qinghe first glanced back at the immortal island, then looked again at Xuan Yuan, who was leading the way, his gaze full of doubt. "Senior Disciple Brother Xuan, why didn't you inform—" He trailed off.

Upon hearing him, Xuan Yuan shook his head and replied, "I thought about it just now and decided it's better to let Junior Disciple Brother Zhang Jing cultivate in peace. He doesn't need to attend the Immortal Welcoming Feast of the Celestial Realm lineage, lest he be deliberately troubled by those people and affect his Dao Heart."

"Senior Disciple Brother speaks wisely," Gu Yao said, a rare serious expression on his face. "Given Junior Disciple Brother Zhang Jing's current cultivation, it's indeed not advisable for him to get involved. His talent is astonishing, and it's best for him to cultivate in peace without any disturbances. We were indeed inconsiderate earlier."

"Is that so? Junior Disciple Brother understands."

...

In the central region of Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven, a towering divine mountain stood quietly, reaching directly into the unknowable heights of the firmament, like a pillar supporting the sky, emanating a majestic and overwhelming aura. This mountain was called Jade Splendor Mountain. It was the ancestral vein of Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven and also the ancestral court of the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect.

Ordinarily, few people came here. Yet at this moment, inside a bronze immortal hall atop the mountain, twelve majestic immortal figures silently appeared, arrayed in two rows. Various auras of the Grand Dao permeated from these figures, causing the bronze immortal hall to tremble incessantly.

The next moment, a terrifying figure, seemingly comprised of countless bodies and souls constantly intertwining and rotating, quietly appeared directly above. As soon as this figure appeared, the twelve immortal figures below uniformly rose, then respectfully called out:

"Greetings, Senior Disciple Brother."

"Haha, Junior Disciple Brothers and Sisters, there's no need for formalities, please take your seats quickly," True Monarch Yuanming above said with a smile.

As his voice fell, the atmosphere in the immortal hall suddenly eased.

"I hear Senior Disciple Brother has once again gained a beloved disciple. Is this gathering for a disciple acceptance ceremony?" Below, a divine maiden seated in the foremost seat on the right smiled charmingly.
