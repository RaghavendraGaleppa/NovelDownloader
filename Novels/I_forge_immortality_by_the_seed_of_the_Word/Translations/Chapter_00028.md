# Chapter 28: Storage Spirit Jade and Joining the Team  

"Senior Brother Liu, are you familiar with the junior brother on the third demonstration platform?"  

At this moment, a purple-robed inner disciple on the giant stone pillar asked. His voice was restrained by magic power, audible only to the nearby inner disciples.  

"Of course, this junior brother is named Zhang Jing," Senior Brother Liu replied without hesitation.  

"Brothers, did you notice the spells this Zhang Jing used just now? They seemed rather unusual. The ordinary Ice Blade Formation technique in his hands far exceeded the power expected at his current cultivation level. And his Frost Light Curse also had issues," another inner disciple added.  

"Moreover, the speed at which he cast his spells was remarkably fast. Such abilities shouldn't be possible at his current stage," another chimed in.  

"What you all say makes sense. It seems Junior Brother Zhang Jing possesses a special talent, much like Junior Brother Chen and Junior Sister Shen," Senior Brother Liu said thoughtfully.  

"Exactly. Junior Brother Chen and Junior Sister Shen's talents lie mainly in cultivation and comprehension, while Junior Brother Zhang's talent clearly lies in spellcasting."  

"Ah, in that case, Junior Brother Zhang's training in the outer court will be quite a disadvantage. He's currently practicing a mid-grade cultivation method, while Junior Brother Chen and Junior Sister Shen are using top-grade methods. The gap is enormous."  

"By the way, Senior Brother, does Zhang Jing's cultivation method have supreme compatibility?"  

Senior Brother Liu shook his head.  

"Then it's hard to say when Junior Brother Zhang will advance to our inner court—it could take ten or even twenty years," the purple-robed disciple said with a tone of regret.  

"In that case, why not have him join our Thousand Techniques Pavilion in the future? Since he has a special talent for spells, he might excel in formations, alchemy, artifacts, talismans, beast taming, or puppetry—perfect for our pavilion," a disciple on the outermost edge suddenly interjected with enthusiasm.  

"Junior Brother Qiu, don't be hasty. Let's wait for Junior Brother Zhang to decide for himself in the future," Senior Brother Liu said with a smile.  

"Tsk, that guy really doesn't hold back. Just watching makes me wince."  

At this moment, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged at the center of the third demonstration platform, his gaze fixed on the fierce battles unfolding on other platforms.  

In his line of sight, a scholarly-looking man wielded two flying swords, relentlessly attacking a woman opposite him.  

After a brief sigh, Zhang Jing turned his attention to other platforms.  

Upon closer observation, he realized that none of those competing for the top ten spots were weak.  

All were at the second level of Qi Refining—but that was just the baseline.  

The combatants either wielded powerful spells or terrifying magical artifacts, each excelling in their own way. Their strengths were so evenly matched that no one could easily overpower their opponents.  

On the fourth platform alone, the reigning champion had changed twice in just half a moment.  

As time passed, the battles on the remaining seven platforms grew even fiercer, with surges of magic power never ceasing. Some were even willing to trade injuries for victory, their eyes nearly wild with determination.  

Finally, Senior Brother Liu's voice rang out:  

"The third stage has concluded. Congratulations to all!"  

Those still standing on the platforms erupted in joy. Some even collapsed to the ground, wiping away tears of relief.  

It had been an arduous struggle!  

The difficulty of securing a top-ten spot had far exceeded their expectations—almost beyond comprehension. The ruthless rules, the daunting top three who seemed invincible, the life-and-death battles—everything had pushed them to their limits.  

But they had prevailed!  

Below the platforms, the eight who had fought to exhaustion, barely able to stand, wore blank expressions, their eyes dull with despair at the harsh outcome.  

In the sky, ten streaks of light descended, transforming into identity jade pendants that hovered before the ten victors.  

Seven were deep green, while the other three shimmered with a faint purple glow.  

Senior Brother Liu spoke again:  

"These identity jades serve as proof of your status as disciples of the Dao Academy. They are bound to your spiritual sense and also record Dao merits and other important information. Of course, they are also fine spiritual artifacts. When using them for the first time, you must imprint your spiritual sense upon them."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"  

Zhang Jing and the others took their pendants and bowed toward Senior Brother Liu.  

Following the instructions, Zhang Jing channeled his spiritual sense into the jade.  

Instantly, he felt a small imprint form within it, intimately connected to his consciousness as though linked by blood.  

Simultaneously, lines of text appeared on the jade's surface:  

**Name:** Zhang Jing  
**Status:** Outer Court Disciple  
**Dao Merits:** 50  

Moreover—  

A flicker of surprise crossed Zhang Jing's eyes.  

The jade contained a storage space—vast enough to hold a small mountain.  

This made him think of his own storage pouch. In comparison, the pouch was laughably inadequate.  

Additionally, the jade was inscribed with a defensive spell. With his familiarity with spell formations, Zhang Jing recognized it as at least mid-grade in power.  

Unfortunately, he couldn't activate it at will.  

"Are these the hidden rewards for the top three?" Zhang Jing wondered silently.  

When the jades had descended earlier, he had noticed that his, Chen Xiandao's, and Shen Qingqing's pendants differed in color from the others.  

And not just them—if he hadn't been mistaken, the jades given to the top twenty and top thirty also had subtle differences.  

"The jades really are different!"  

Chu Lingyun compared her newly acquired jade with Deng An's and gasped in surprise.  

"Naturally. Didn't you notice that Zhang Jing and the other two have light purple jades? I suspected the rewards varied by rank," Deng An explained with a smile.  

But when his gaze shifted to Zhang Jing on the platform, his smile faded, replaced by disbelief.  

He vividly remembered how, just a month ago, this same person had followed Ji Bochang like a shadow on the spirit crane.  

Who could have imagined that in such a short time, Zhang Jing would surpass them all by such a margin?  

And the gap would only widen further.  

Deng An recalled the advice he had given Zhang Jing in Wu Mingyuan's courtyard. Looking back now, it was painfully awkward.  

"Perhaps, back then, Zhang Jing saw our behavior as nothing more than a joke. Why didn't Brother Ji warn us? Though, even he probably didn't foresee this outcome."  

Deng An sighed inwardly, his eyes filled with desolation.  

Beside him, sensing the shift in mood, Chu Lingyun also fell silent.  

She knew exactly what Deng An was thinking.  

After a moment, she bit her lip and whispered, "Brother Deng, don't dwell on it. Zhang Jing is in a different world now."  

"I know..."  

Meanwhile, on another stone platform—  

"Senior Brother, should our Hundred Rivers team still try to recruit Zhang Jing?"  

The man who had initially approached Zhang Jing turned hesitantly to his senior.  

"If only we had secured him earlier—our captain would've been overjoyed. But now, even if we wanted to, would those top teams allow it?"  

The senior pointed ahead with a resigned expression.  

Following his gesture, the ten foremost platforms, once quiet, were now abuzz with activity.  

"Brothers, I propose that the Coiling Dragon team—"  

A burly, bald man on the far left began, only to be cut off by the refined man seated third:  

"Senior Brother Lu, enough! Your team already has one prodigy. How can you still eye this junior? Even Junior Sister Liu of the Misty Dawn team hasn't spoken yet."  

At this, Liu Nanshu blushed slightly and said softly,  

"Junior Brother Zhang, actually, I also—"  

"No, Senior Sister, you don't!"  

The refined man dismissed her outright before turning to the other platforms.  

"Everyone, let our Luodu team have priority contact with this junior. The rest of the top ten can be distributed among you. Agreed?"  

Silence.  

"Junior Brother Zhang, it's not as though your team is giving up two prodigies for nothing. Didn't our two teams trade thirty years of first-pick rights for future trials?" the bald man retorted coldly.  

Liu Nanshu nodded in agreement.  

"Very well. Our Luodu team withdraws that condition. From now on, recruitment of future trial champions will be fair game."  

The refined man spoke decisively.  

"Ha! If you'd said so earlier, we wouldn't have objected!"  

"Neither would I," Liu Nanshu added.  

Realization dawned on the refined man. The Coiling Dragon and Misty Dawn teams had anticipated his refusal to back down and used this to pressure Luodu into relinquishing their thirty-year advantage.  

But even knowing this, he had no regrets.  

Though Zhang Jing fell just short of prodigy status, the top three of this trial far exceeded normal standards. The likelihood of such talents appearing in the next ten batches was slim.  

It was worth it!  

With that, the refined man stepped forward, flying straight toward the third platform.  

His movement signaled the start—dozens of figures rose and followed closely behind.  

"They're coming!"  

Zhang Jing remained outwardly calm but inwardly thrilled.  

"Junior Brother, may I have your name?" the refined man asked warmly as he approached.  

"Zhang Jing greets Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing returned the smile with equal poise.  

Pleased by his demeanor, the refined man nodded approvingly.  

High talent, excellent temperament—a true inner court seed!  

"Ah, Junior Brother Zhang! What a coincidence—I'm also surnamed Zhang, Yangchu. Just call me Senior Brother Yangchu."  

"Senior Brother Yangchu."  

Zhang Jing clasped his hands in salute.  

"No need for formalities. Tell me, have you already joined a mission team?"  

Zhang Yangchu's expression turned serious.  

"Senior Brother, I haven't joined any team yet."  

"Oh?" Zhang Yangchu's eyes gleamed with intrigue. "So you've never accepted resources from any team before?"  

Zhang Jing nodded.  

At once, Zhang Yangchu's heart soared.  

This was an unexpected windfall!  

Who would've thought this dazzling junior had no prior affiliations?  

A true monster!  

After a pause, Zhang Yangchu asked eagerly,  

"Did any teams approach you before? Why didn't you accept?"  

Before Zhang Jing could answer, Yangchu interjected,  

"Wait—don't tell me. Let me guess: the thirty percent Dao merit commission?"  

Zhang Jing blinked in surprise. How did he know?  

"Haha, I knew it! No talent would accept such terms."  

Zhang Yangchu laughed before continuing,  

"Junior Brother, let me introduce our Luodu team—ranked third in the outer court.  

"If you join, starting today, we'll provide a vial of Purple Spirit Pills monthly to aid your cultivation. Additionally, you'll receive one mid-grade legacy exchange opportunity.  

"Oh, and there's an unoccupied cave dwelling on Luodu Isle—it's yours. As for Dao merit commissions? None.  

"So, Junior Brother Zhang, will you join the Luodu team?"  

Zhang Yangchu smiled expectantly.  

Hearing these terms, Zhang Jing was stunned.  

This was the wealth of a top-three team? He was sold.  

"Junior Brother accepts!"
