# Chapter 45: Returning Home

Fusong gradually regained clarity of mind and noticed several golden needles inserted into major acupoints on his chest.

"Junior Brother, it's fortunate you used the Crane Needle technique to regulate my qi and blood circulation. Otherwise, things could have turned disastrous."

He was filled with emotion. In the past, when his cultivation had gone awry, it was his senior brother Fushan who had treated him with the Crane Needle technique. 

Sadly, while Fushan could heal others, he couldn't heal himself.

"Senior Brother, if I hadn't spoken carelessly, your qi and blood wouldn't have gone out of control. This technique clearly has issues—perhaps you shouldn't attempt it anymore?"

As Zhou Qing spoke, he removed the needles one by one. 

The golden needles were flexible, and a martial artist's skin was tough. Without infusing them with Tiger-Crane energy, they couldn't penetrate the skin. Neither Tiger-Crane energy, the original Crane energy, nor the heat generated from Tiger Play could be transferred into another's body. The Crane Needle technique could only stimulate acupoints to a limited extent.

The Crane Form technique was ultimately just one part of the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon. Currently, his "Nourishing Life Mastery" still rated the canon as only at the entry level. In terms of difficulty, it was actually higher than the Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist.

This talisman canon was profound and intricate, delving into the mysteries of the human body. Zhou Qing planned to study it carefully after returning to Jiangzhou, believing it could complement his Five Animals Technique practice for remarkable effects.

After all, the Five Animals Technique also explored the human body and promoted health and longevity. Originating from medical traditions, it shared common ground with the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon's unique blend of medicine and martial arts.

In truth, Zhou Qing still didn't fully understand the true meaning of "unique techniques." When he asked Fusong, even he didn't know what they entailed. 

Now that he had passed the provincial examination, he had a stable environment to develop steadily. There was no need to rush.

Fusong shook his head. "Junior Brother, there's no problem with this technique. I've grasped the general approach, but the details need refinement. Creating a new technique can't be accomplished overnight. Even if we succeed, what suits me might not suit you. But which technique at our Qingfu Temple wasn't developed and perfected this way?"

Zhou Qing nodded. "You're right, Senior Brother. How can we shrink from difficulties in worldly affairs?"

Fusong smiled. "So you must diligently study the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon. If I make another mistake in my practice, I'll be counting on you to save me."

Zhou Qing coughed lightly. "Senior Brother, perhaps you shouldn't push yourself. My skills are limited—what if I can't treat you properly? Moreover, we don't even know how effective this technique truly is."

Fusong replied, "Apart from being unable to cure brain ailments or terminal illnesses, when practiced to my senior brother's level, the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon could revive someone who had just breathed their last, allowing them to speak final words before passing. To reach his level, you should treat more difficult and complicated illnesses—it would undoubtedly help your progress."

"So you're saying I should practice medicine?"

"Just find time to see some complicated cases. In the past, martial artists or nobles would seek treatment at Qingfu Temple. Those who came were always the hardest cases. Don't worry—from now on, if anyone comes seeking treatment, I won't turn them away. You can handle them."

Zhou Qing couldn't help but ask, "Senior Brother, may I speak frankly?"

"Go ahead."

"Previously, when Senior Brother Fushan treated patients, he must have earned substantial fees. How is it that Qingfu Temple..."

Even if they had squandered the money, it shouldn't have been to this extent.

Fusong's expression shifted slightly before he sighed. "Junior Brother, you only see the value of gold and silver, but you don't know about alchemy. That pursuit can burn through mountains of wealth. To break through to the Xiantian realm, he stubbornly attempted to refine Qi-Inducing Pills, exhausting years of savings. Not only did he fail, but the setback also led him to recklessly try to harness heavenly lightning, which also ended in failure..."

Zhou Qing's interest was piqued at the mention of alchemy. "What are Qi-Inducing Pills?"

Fusong replied, "They're a formula left by our founder. Only he knew it—don't get any ideas. You're still young. If you don't want to pursue an official career and focus on cultivation, you might have a chance to reach the Xiantian realm someday. But it's also possible you'll never reach it in your lifetime. Cultivation doesn't guarantee rewards for effort."

Zhou Qing nodded thoughtfully. 

He wasn't afraid of lack of reward—he feared not knowing how to put in the effort. 

The Xiantian realm Fusong spoke of likely held secrets to longevity, which would undoubtedly aid in prolonging life. However, Zhou Qing was far from reaching that level. 

For now, he would complete the Five Animals Technique before making further plans.

Based on his university teacher's explanations, Zhou Qing currently believed the Five Animals Technique aligned with a saying from martial arts films he'd seen in his past life: 

"First fists, then legs, followed by grappling, weapons, and finally internal cultivation—all five combined."

The film drew from martial arts traditions of his previous world, containing profound insights.

The next day, after Fusong regulated his qi, they set off for Jiangzhou.

As Zhou Qing departed, Magistrate Feng came to see him off, briefly mentioning matters concerning Squire Zhang and assuring Zhou Qing he had nothing to worry about.

Magistrate Feng accompanied Zhou Qing to the pavilion outside the city walls, where he couldn't help but wipe his tears with his sleeve.

"Worthy Brother, the journey is long and treacherous—take care."

"You as well, Worthy Brother."

Though their ages differed by two dozen years, to outsiders, they appeared to have become fast friends. Magistrate Feng saw Zhou Qing off repeatedly, only stopping when they reached the border of Hengbo County.

As a local official, he couldn't leave his jurisdiction without authorization.

Watching Zhou Qing's party disappear into the forest ahead, Fusong sighed.

Fushan had even sought help from alchemy, to little avail.

He noted that thirty was a critical juncture—achievements in qi and blood martial arts were usually determined before that age. 

Afterward, one could at best maintain their level, but no matter what they did, they would gradually decline.

To progress beyond thirty, the best method was to break through to the Xiantian realm.

"Xiantian is a person's second birth."

Fushan even speculated that upon reaching Xiantian and cultivating true qi, the body would undergo a second comprehensive development since birth.

Thus, legends spoke of Daoist predecessors who, upon reaching the Xiantian realm, regrew lost teeth, reversed aging, and saw their white hair turn black again...

Fushan's notes were filled with longing for the Xiantian realm.

Zhou Qing shared that longing.

However, Zhou Qing had one advantage over Fushan.

The Five Animals Technique he practiced would likely allow further advancement after all aspects reached proficiency. The more he practiced, the more he felt its infinite mysteries—as if a lifetime wouldn't be enough to master it fully.

Even with Tiger Play and Deer Play at proficiency, each practice session, aided by his keen and powerful mental energy, still brought faint strengthening to his kidneys and liver.

The Five Animals Technique corresponded to the five organs.

Shadowless Kick incorporated Deer Play characteristics, benefiting the liver during practice, though not as purely or effectively as Deer Play alone.

Setting aside his thoughts, Zhou Qing took a Blood Qi Pill and bowed to the great mulberry tree.

"Brother Mulberry, please aid my cultivation."

After much consideration, the mulberry tree remained the best aid for practicing Bear Play.

Zhou Qing truly had no better option.

In others' eyes, Miss Lin would inevitably become a concubine someday, so no one would trouble the Lin family unnecessarily.

For merchants, when obstacles from all sides diminish, business only flourishes.

Throughout history, merchants have curried favor with officials and gentry for this very reason.

Recalling how he had once risked stealth techniques to obtain a single five-leafed ginseng from the Fierce Tiger Gang's vault—even taking a life in the process—Zhou Qing marveled at how two such ginsengs now came to him effortlessly, just by speaking a word, all within a month.

The disparity in life's fortunes was starkly evident after the provincial examination.

Zhou Qing soon refined the two five-leafed ginsengs into Blood Qi Pills.

The quantity was enough to bring Bear Play to proficiency and continue with Bird Play.

But first, he prepared to fully merge Ghost Step and the Breeze Talisman Canon.

This fusion had two key requirements: consuming blood qi and assistance from his Literary Mind.

With a fresh supply of Blood Qi Pills, Zhou Qing didn't hesitate to expend his blood qi.

Before the examination, he hadn't merged Ghost Step and the Breeze Talisman preliminarily, unlike with Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist, for this very reason.

The initial fusion of Tiger Play and Crane Form had consumed blood qi before merging their energies.

Ghost Step and the Breeze Talisman would be the same.

Now, with the examination behind him and his foundation established, he could cultivate in peace. Fully prepared, he had no concerns about blood qi consumption.

With a thought, under the guidance of his Nourishing Life Mastery, his blood qi began to deplete, and the characters marking his initial Literary Mind dimmed.

After an indeterminate time, Zhou Qing's complexion paled slightly.

Observing his Nourishing Life Mastery again, he saw Ghost Step and the Breeze Talisman vanish completely, replaced by a new martial skill: Shadowless Kick (Entry Level).

The name was assigned by his Nourishing Life Mastery based on his memory and understanding. It wasn't the same as the Shadowless Kick from films, but similarities must have prompted the naming.

Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist had been named similarly.

Details of Shadowless Kick surfaced in Zhou Qing's mind. This skill was also a body-strengthening technique, moving from external to internal. The energy it produced retained Deer Play's liver-strengthening traits and the Breeze Talisman's lightness.

Though Crane Energy and the Breeze Talisman both enhanced speed and lightness, Crane Energy was more aggressive, making its fusion with Tiger Play into Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist natural.

Shadowless Kick's defining feature wasn't aggression—its essence lay in being "formless and traceless."

It transformed tangible leg techniques into the intangible, with endless variations to counter any move.

Zhou Qing smiled at Morning Sun.

Cluck cluck cluck!

Morning Sun dodged with incredible speed but still lost a feather to Zhou Qing's kick.

This time, Zhou Qing hadn't taken it by surprise—he'd used Shadowless Kick head-on, yet even Morning Sun's agility couldn't fully evade it.

The creature had consumed countless medicinal dregs alongside him.

The mulberry tree hadn't received as many dregs as Morning Sun.

Moreover, Morning Sun's growth was unusually slow, for reasons unknown.

Zhou Qing suspected Morning Sun might have the bloodline of a spirit beast or some extraordinary creature.

It was clearly no ordinary fowl.

As for the mulberry tree, its canopy remained as majestic as ever.

Many in Jiangcheng now claimed the tree truly heralded nobility—after all, Provincial Graduate Zhou had become a man of rank only after residing in the Lin family's old estate.

Thus, after passing the examination, he refused to move out.

People's superstitions about geomancy and fortune generally followed such patterns.

Zhou Qing felt there might be some truth to these rumors.

As for talk of the Lin estate being haunted, no one mentioned it anymore. They said the old servants simply hadn't been destined to bear the mulberry tree's blessings, hence their nightly frights.

Hadn't Provincial Graduate Zhou turned out fine?

This proved only those with noble destiny could withstand the fortune the mulberry tree brought.

Admittedly, Zhou Qing had spread this rumor himself.

If he didn't add some divine elements to his story, others would. It was better to shape his persona within reasonable bounds.

In turbulent times, the concept of being divinely ordained carried significant weight.

This was a long-term, gradual process.

Shadowless Kick's difficulty level was similar to Tiger-Crane Twin Forms Fist, but Zhou Qing's current physique and blood qi were far stronger than when he'd practiced the latter.

Even without Blood Qi Pills, his progress wasn't slow.

Since diligent practice could advance it, he didn't rush to use pills for Shadowless Kick.

Bear Play and Bird Play, however, would struggle without them.

Bear Play's difficulty was incomparable to Tiger Play's initial level. While studying the Rejuvenation Talisman Canon in his spare time, Zhou Qing realized the human body's enhancement grew exponentially harder—each incremental improvement became several times more difficult than before.

The closer one approached the limits of physical cultivation, the slower the progress.

Days earlier, Zhishan had delivered notes from Fushan.

In them, Fushan claimed that after thirty, his blood qi had ranked in the upper-middle among Qingfu Temple's abbots, placing his martial arts among the elite.

Yet after thirty, every slight advancement required immense effort.

Fushan had even turned to alchemy, with negligible results.

He noted thirty was a critical threshold—achievements in blood qi martial arts were usually determined before that age.

Afterward, one could at best maintain their level, but decline was inevitable.

To progress beyond thirty, breaking through to the Xiantian realm was the only way.

"Xiantian is a person's second birth."

Fushan speculated that upon reaching Xiantian and cultivating true qi, the body would undergo a second comprehensive development since birth.

Thus, legends spoke of Daoist predecessors who, upon reaching the Xiantian realm, regrew lost teeth, reversed aging, and saw their white hair turn black again...

Fushan's notes brimmed with longing for the Xiantian realm.

Zhou Qing shared that longing.

However, Zhou Qing had one advantage over Fushan.

The Five Animals Technique he practiced would likely allow further advancement after all aspects reached proficiency. The more he practiced, the more he felt its infinite mysteries—as if a lifetime wouldn't be enough to master it fully.

Even with Tiger Play and Deer Play at proficiency, each practice session, aided by his keen and powerful mental energy, still brought faint strengthening to his kidneys and liver.

The Five Animals Technique corresponded to the five organs.

Shadowless Kick incorporated Deer Play characteristics, benefiting the liver during practice, though not as purely or effectively as Deer Play alone.
