Chapter 162: The Big-Headed Doll, The Gift

In the attic of Autumn Water Pavilion.

Inside the room.

Ying Bing sat on the Cold Marrow Jade Bed, her long, slender legs pressed tightly together. However, the chilling effect of the jade bed seemed to have失效 (failed), unable to calm her mind at all.

The scene from just moments ago seemed to be seared into her mind, refusing to fade.

She wasn't some naive, innocent girl who knew nothing of the world.

She naturally knew what she had accidentally seen.

"I can't keep thinking about it... I must not think about it anymore..."

"I saw... nothing."

Ying Bing grabbed her money jar and began counting the silver fragments and copper coins inside. She had brought it with her when she left the hotpot restaurant.

Her misty eyes were focused intently as she counted the money seriously.

"Twelve taels, three qian, and seven wen... Thirteen taels, five qian, and five wen... Eleven taels..."

Why did the amount seem to decrease the more she counted?!

So, the Ice Cube started over.

The clinking sound of the coins continued for a long time before gradually finding a rhythm.

After slowly calming down, Ying Bing checked the system.

**[Congratulations, Host. The corresponding punishment has been completed. Rewards are being issued.]**

**[Reward 1: Xuan Niao Nuo Chang Yi (Black Bird Feather Robe).]**

**[Black Bird Feather Robe]:** "The Xuan Niao sheds its feathers once every thousand years. The feathers obtained can only make one robe. It is impervious to water and fire, difficult to damage with a hundred weapons, and carries a trace of the Xuan Niao's aura. It is majestic and noble."

This garment, which included a cloak, appeared pitch black at first glance, but upon closer inspection, it shimmered with a precious light. It was a black with five-colored luster.

Gently stroking the cool-feeling feather robe, Ying Bing snapped back to reality.

**[Reward 2: Divine Skies Heavenly Heart Sword Canon (First, Second, and Third Forms)]**

**[Divine Skies Heavenly Heart Sword Canon (Incomplete)]:** "An incomplete divine-level sword technique. The Sword Heart is my Heart, my Heart is the Heavenly Heart! A hundred meanings of the Divine Skies, but my meaning is one!"

A Divine-level sword technique!

Ying Bing had only used the sword as a supplementary手段 (method) afterward.

She had possessed Divine-level sword techniques before, but they required the use of the Nine-Colored Divine Phoenix's Heavenly Soul. Now, the only thing she could use was the 'Selfless Sword'.

This Sword Canon arrived at a very opportune time.

"Even if it's only the first three forms, it will be enough for now."

Ying Bing's thoughts shifted.

Immediately, a sword seal emerged from the void and branded itself upon her brow.

Understanding rose from within her heart.

For the accumulation of the Phoenix Empress, these obscure and difficult sword techniques posed no barrier to understanding.

"If the first three forms are mastered, I can obtain the Transparent Sword Heart," Ying Bing muttered to herself.

If that were the case, the trip to Heng Yun Sword City would be much easier.

She had been determined to go from the start.

Right.

There was also Jiang Chulong.

This little princess of the Yu Dynasty had not suffered those hardships in this life, and her injuries had recovered very well.

She should also be... at the Internal Breath Realm by now?

The Internal Breath Realm might not be enough to stand out at a Martial Arts Summit, but the location of this summit happens to be at the largest sword sect in Yunzhou.

It should be possible to compete there.

I wonder if she has any plans to go to Yunzhou.

"And him..."

Ying Bing suddenly realized.

Unknowingly, Li Mo's swordsmanship had actually reached a level where he could shine brilliantly at Heng Yun Sword City!

Unfortunately, he only had terrifying comprehension ability.

He lacked the relevant aptitude and bone structure for the sword.

It was truly a pity.

However, his greatest strength didn't seem to be the sword anyway...

As the boy's name surfaced in her mind, Ying Bing's heart, which had just calmed down, began to stir again.

She shook her head and looked at the final reward.

**[Reward 3: A Spatial Item. Can generate a customized appearance according to the Host's will.]**

Spatial items were truly rare treasures in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

She didn't actually have one on hand right now, which was very inconvenient every time she went out.

Customizing the appearance was quite convenient.

"What did the spatial item I used in my previous life look like?"

Ying Bing was just about to dispel her distracting thoughts and recall the past.

Suddenly.

**[Based on the Host's inner thoughts, the corresponding spatial item has been generated.]**

Ying Bing: "?"

She hadn't even said "start" yet.

System, can you understand what "distracting thoughts" are?

*Plop—*

A big-headed doll fell onto the bed.

The doll was only half a palm size. It was a少年 (youth) in white clothes and a white robe, holding a long sword in his left hand and a hammer in his right. It was lifelike and exquisite.

It was just that the head was a bit big, looking very cute.

Yes.

It was a Q-version Li Mo.

Ying Bing held the big-headed doll, her expression complex.

**[Host, you must be wondering how to use this spatial item, right?]**

**[Rest assured, products from the System are guaranteed high quality. The quality is absolutely no problem, and it is absolutely convenient to use!]**

**[Just unscrew the big-headed doll's head to open the spatial space.]**

---

Since things had come to this.

Ying Bing remained silent for a moment, but still unscrewed the big-headed doll's head.

She probed it slightly; the space inside seemed quite vast...

**[Ding.]**

**[Due to the Host attacking the ranking victor while bathing, the evaluation has decreased.]**

**[This Defeat's Penalty Reward is Grade Ding (Low).]**

**[Random reward being extracted...]**

Ding...

Grade Ding (Low)?

............

On the other side.

Li Mo was soaking in the hot spring, rubbing the back of his head, and let out a heavy sigh.

Why did the Ice Cube get a little strange at the end of the month?

*Hmmmm.*

Student Li Mo thought rationally, and a sudden flash of inspiration struck his mind.

Could it be... because of her period?

Just like he occasionally couldn't control himself now, some physiological reactions were unavoidable even for martial artists.

For example, the "Minister Earl" and the "Kui Shui" (menstruation).

So, that's why the Ice Cube didn't let him look at her just now?

"This world doesn't have things like '8 Degrees Space' to prevent side-leakage..."

"Then, it makes sense that her mood swings are quite large."

"So that's why her expression was so strange!"

Student Li Mo felt he had discovered the truth!

I wonder if the artisans at the Divine Weapon Peak could use special materials to create something similar...

Finding the cause, Li Mo's mood relaxed.

Feeling relaxed, he looked up at the moon that was about to leave the zenith of the sky and suddenly remembered something.

It was almost time for Little Princess Jiang's class.

And he hadn't prepared the lesson for today!

He originally had questions to discuss with the Ice Cube, but after the interruption, he forgot everything!

"What should I do now..."

Li Mo couldn't allow the omnipotent Heavenly尊 (Tianzun) Teacher to have his reputation ruined.

Right.

He seemed to have promised Chulong that he would meet her.

Thinking of this, Li Mo took out the Jade Sword Peach Blossom Branch from his system space and let his consciousness sink.

.....

Sunshine, beach, big villa.

This time, Li Mo didn't use the Glazed Gauze.

It wasn't long before a fluctuation arrived.

Jiang Chulong appeared, holding a tree branch and carrying a small backpack on her back. Her little body was a bit dirty.

When she saw Li Mo, her body instantly tensed up.

"Li-Li-Li... Big Brother Li... Why are you... here?"

She wanted to get closer, but she felt she was dirty, and on top of that, she was too surprised.

So she just stood there foolishly.

Her little head was a bit stuck.

"I fell asleep and dreamed of a master."

"He said you wanted to see me, so I waited for you here," Li Mo said with a smile, stepping forward to take off her backpack and rubbing her little head.

Listening to the gentle voice and feeling the warmth on her head.

Jiang Chulong couldn't help but secretly curl up the corner of her mouth:

"That... is... Chulong's... teacher."

"Purely as a bystander, to be honest, he really does look unfathomable, powerful, and extraordinary."

"It's really... really good that Big Brother Li came."

Jiang Chulong was visibly happy.

"I promised you back then," Li Mo said, reaching into his sleeve.

"Once you reach the Internal Breath Realm, I would give you a gift."

"A... gift?"

Jiang Chulong stood there stunned.

When she was in the palace, she was a plague god, a ghost.

Eunuchs and palace maids avoided her like the plague, pretending not to see her even when they did. Her brothers and sisters ignored her completely.

She had never received a gift before.

"Do you like it?"

A beautiful, exquisite peach blossom branch was placed before her eyes.

Li Mo actually felt that this Jade Sword Peach Blossom Branch was a bit unworthy of Little Princess Jiang's identity.

After all, it was just a Name Weapon.

But it was convenient. If he didn't make a move, it was just a peach blossom branch that looked prettier than usual, and wouldn't bring trouble.

*Huh?*

Li Mo was a bit strange.

Jiang Chulong was staring blankly at that peach blossom branch.

The cloth strip fell.

*Drip—*

A few tears flowed, falling onto the back of his hand and shattering into sparkling droplets.
