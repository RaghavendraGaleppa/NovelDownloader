## Chapter 193: Annihilating Yuanchi!

"Holy crap, he still has trump cards."

Zhou Tian was startled. He had thought Yuanchi was at the end of his rope, yet he still had hidden abilities. These races truly were blessed by nature. However, with his Undying System newly upgraded and himself at his peak, Zhou Tian felt no fear.

"Let's see who's stronger!"

Zhou Tian turned his head, searching for Huang Qi to once again cast his Cultivation Replication skill. He found Huang Qi had already hidden himself far away, leaving Zhou Tian somewhat exasperated. At the same time, he grew more wary of the divine ability Yuanchi was about to unleash, as Huang Qi was clearly trying to avoid being caught in the aftermath. Nevertheless, Huang Qi was still within his line of sight, allowing him to be selected as a target. First, Zhou Tian used the [Attack Amplification] skill. A surge of inexplicable information filled his mind; his next attack would have its power comprehensively increased by 38%. Then, he selected Huang Qi as the target for [Cultivation Replication]. Boom!

Instantly, his qi and blood surged like collapsing clouds. Terrifying Dao might erupted from Zhou Tian's entire body once more, golden light shimmering in his eyes, his hair brilliantly crystalline, and ethereal misty energy circulating around him. Simultaneously, a pitch-black coffin slowly emerged from the violent churning black mist where Yuanchi stood. Made of unknown materials, it was inscribed with various mysterious symbols and wrapped in black chains.

The coffin lid vibrated, enveloped by terrifying black Dao light chains. A booming sound shattered the firmament as a crack opened, from which destructive qi surged out. A chill ran down Zhou Tian's spine, as if he had been targeted by some terrifying existence. It seemed something immensely ominous was hidden within that coffin.

Zhou Tian understood he could wait no longer. If whatever was in the coffin burst out, there was no telling what catastrophe might occur. He formed hand seals, and immediately, the sound of Buddhist chanting resonated through the void. A phantom Buddha figure sat cross-legged behind him. This was a divine ability recorded in the "Myriad Lives Pagoda Form" that Saint-Devil had given him. The "Myriad Lives Pagoda Form" was one of the top-tier cultivation techniques of the ancient Buddhist realm, once obtained and comprehended by Wutian. Saint-Devil had acquired a legacy left by Wutian, gaining half a scroll of it. Besides cultivation methods, it also recorded several great divine abilities. Just now, as the Undying System absorbed the world origin, Zhou Tian also received many blessings, enveloped by the rhythm of the Great Dao, his comprehension power surged, yet he had only managed to comprehend one style.

"Pagoda Palm!"

Zhou Tian held his fingers and palm together, crystalline and dazzling, slowly extending them. The phantom Buddha figure behind him also slowly moved, extending a gigantic Buddha palm. The void rumbled. This was not only a great divine ability unleashed at the Dao Lord realm but also amplified by [Attack Amplification], increasing its power by 38%. This was a terrifying increase. At this level of cultivation, every divine ability was almost akin to the Dao itself; let alone a 38% increase, even a 1% increase was an extravagant hope.

"Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate!"

The pitch-black coffin lid vibrated wildly without stopping. A dark, blackish bead emerged from the crack, accompanied by faint, indistinct sounds.

The Buddha palm emitted golden light, and manifestations of all living beings appeared as Bodhisattvas chanted. Zhou Tian's countenance also became benevolent, not intentionally, but because the state of mind required to unleash the Pagoda Palm unconsciously influenced him. As the crack in the coffin lid widened, Zhou Tian clearly saw that the blackish bead was actually an eyeball. About half of a face was revealed, its skin crystalline and hair brilliant, as if it had just lain down inside. Black mist surged sky-high, accompanied by vast swathes of never-before-seen, strange Dao patterns.

In that instant, he heard the half-face's long howl, which was too gloomy and terrifying. Endless black mist erupted. It was as if the abyss had been torn open, revealing its darkest and coldest side, then erupting with various malevolent order symbols, corrupting even the Great Dao. The glistening face began to rot, twisting madly. Hair on its scalp dripped with blood, and its eyes were as black as an abyss, becoming increasingly grotesque. It howled, its hair dancing as if a dark overlord had possessed a corpse and returned to life, incredibly strange, sinister, and terrifying.

At that very moment, Zhou Tian's Pagoda Palm also pressed down, preventing the coffin lid from shaking further.

"Pagoda! Pagoda!"

The heavens chanted. The golden Buddha palm pressed down, only one size smaller than the golden hand that had just sealed the world origin. Buddhist aura circulated, pressing towards the pitch-black coffin. The black mist began to dissipate.

"Annihilate! Annihilate! Annihilate!"

The rotting face, with its dishevelled, blood-dripping long hair, revealing a bit of facial bone, howled and charged again. It had always wanted to burst out; the coffin not only contained its existence but also sealed it. Its words echoed out, as if swept from the ruins of some annihilated world, a civilization wiped out, piercing through the river of time.

"Suppress!"

Zhou Tian fully activated the Pagoda Palm, pressing down like the heavens themselves. Perhaps the creature within the coffin was once immensely powerful, bearing obsession and guided here, condensed into a tangible body with a rotting face—perhaps some terrifying incarnation that could destroy everything upon emergence. But now, only half of its face was revealed, and its power was limited. The coffin creaked, and the black Great Dao chains vibrated ceaselessly, seemingly on the verge of shattering.

Boom!

At this moment, the half-rotting face exploded. Under the Pagoda Palm, Buddhist divine abilities inherently serve to cleanse evil, let alone a great divine ability recorded in a top-tier cultivation technique, further enhanced by [Attack Amplification], possessing unbelievable power.

Roar!

Endless black mist erupted. After the half-rotting face exploded, it carried resentment, burning its own obsession, erupting with dark light, accompanied by a sky-high strange aura, attempting to pierce through the golden Buddha palm. After its few facial bones were crushed, they turned into dozens of smaller fragments, which now floated, manifesting Dao symbols. However, everything was in vain. The more it erupted, the faster it was annihilated. It was suppressed by the Pagoda Palm and, after being covered by ripples, turned into nothingness, ceasing to exist.

Whether it was the dark light, the lingering bloodstains, or the small pieces of facial bone, all directly turned into dust, being ground away, being incinerated.

"Boom!"

Finally, not even ashes remained. It was crushed into nothingness. The great divine ability from the ancient Buddhist realm had thus transformed darkness into tranquility.

A ray of dawn sunlight fell, and the heavens and earth were cleansed.

The coffin also shattered, and the remaining black mist receded. Yuanchi's body reappeared, an incredulous expression on his face as he looked at Zhou Tian. The Pagoda Palm had not yet dissipated and continued to press down on Yuanchi.

His expression drastically changed. "I am of the Abyss Tomb clan..."

Before he could finish his sentence, the Pagoda Palm pressed down, carrying unmatched suppressive and killing power.

Rumble!

The ground, which had slightly healed due to the world origin, collapsed again. The aftermath spread far, even the mountains shook.

"You fool, it's precisely your Abyss Tomb clan that I'm killing." Zhou Tian said disdainfully, "It's not like I didn't know you were from the Abyss Tomb clan."
