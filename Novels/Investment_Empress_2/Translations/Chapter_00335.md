# Chapter 335: Kongming Wanse Pagoda, Happy Winter Solstice

At the entrance of the kitchen, her jade-like skin illuminated the snowy landscape. Her black Liuxian dress stood out particularly against the snow, adorned with moon patterns woven from silver threads, exuding nobility and mystery, and accentuating her breathtaking waistline.

Ying Bing's gaze didn't even need to search; she found the person she was looking for instantly.

She had arrived.

"Brother Li, Miss Ying is here to see you... Huh?"

Huang Donglai suddenly realized.

Brother Li's expression was incredibly serious and tense.

And on such a cold day, why was Brother Li sweating a bit on his forehead? Was his internal heat that intense?

"You're here." Li Mo put down the barbecue sauce.

"Why did you come to the kitchen?"

"You know I have some authority in the culinary arts."

"But you haven't fully recovered yet."

Ying Bing raised her slender, black eyebrows, her gaze falling casually on the dumpling filling and wrappers beside her, a hint of... curiosity in her eyes?

When she came from the Jiawei Restaurant, the landlady was making dumplings for the boss.

The boss was watching from the side, the couple looking utterly blissful.

At that moment, Ying Bing felt a surge of unfamiliar and strange emotions in her heart.

Was it longing?

In any case, the landlady pulled her over and taught her a thing or two. The Cold Fairy silently learned for a while, feeling a bit like she had "enlightened at Longchang."

If Li Mo knew about this, he would definitely have a serious talk with the landlady.

"Ice Cube!"

Seeing Ying Bing's hand reaching for the dumpling wrappers, Li Mo gritted his teeth.

He had fought through a thousand troops and ten thousand horses; he couldn't possibly fall at the victory banquet!

"What is it?"

The Ice Cube's confusion.

".......Your outfit looks really nice today. Is this an ordinary dress?"

Li Mo looked at her with a completely serious expression.

He had heard that complimenting a girl's looks could divert her attention.

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled slightly. She nodded lightly:

"Mm, this Liuxian dress has some wonderful uses. It's quite good for practicing martial arts."

"You're still training on a holiday?"

"No."

"???"

Li Mo lightly coughed, noticing her gaze was drifting back towards the dumpling wrappers. He asked even more earnestly:

"Then, where was such a fine outfit made? I'll go buy one too."

The young man's gaze was sincere and earnest, as if he had a very strong interest in getting the same item.

".......I'm not telling you."

Ying Bing avoided his gaze.

As is well known, people tend to find something to do when they are at a loss. Ying Bing had just learned a few secrets to making dumplings.

Coincidentally, there was dumpling filling and wrappers right in front of her.

Li Mo: "!??"

Staring blankly at the Ice Cube who had already started working, Student Li couldn't figure out, even if his brain exploded, where exactly things had gone wrong.

The Kitchen Defense Battle had failed!

Hm?

A dumpling was held in her fair palm. It actually looked quite delicate and well-made?

Looking up, Li Mo saw Ying Bing's cold and clear face, her stubborn, unyielding mouth corners now slightly curved...

"Seriously? You made this? How did you do it?"

Chef Li was utterly shocked.

Had the Ice Cube awakened her past life's memories? Was she cheating?!

"It's just a few dumplings."

Ying Bing's expression was confident, cold and proud.

She casually picked up a dumpling wrapper and wrapped one in an instant, her speed so fast it was hard to see with the naked eye!

She even used her True Essence!

Pork and Scallion Dumplings, complete!!

Student Li sucked in a cold breath, leaning back tactically, feeling like a villain in a novel, thoroughly beaten and humiliated by the proud female protagonist.

"How is it?"

"Student Li bows in admiration."

The sky grew late, but the clouds that had been overcast all day stubbornly refused to snow.

Looking out over the snowy ground, the vast whiteness was no longer snow, but piles upon piles of dumplings.

A row of large pots, each two people high, were bubbling with boiling water, and countless grilling racks were placed over the charcoal fires.

---

My, the mortal world's lively atmosphere was so thick it could make the heavens squint their eyes. No wonder it wasn't snowing today.

"Start boiling the dumplings!"

Qu Sheng gave the order.

Piles of white dumplings were put into the pots. Moments later, they were lifted by a powerful Internal Scenery Domain, flying cha-ching into bowls, which were then continuously sent to each camp.

"Commander Qu, you've been busy all day, you should eat too."

Huang Donglai brought over a freshly cooked bowl.

"Alright, let's see how the taste is."

Qu Sheng held the bowl, picked one out with his fingers, his brow unfurrowing as he murmured:

"It really does have a bit of... the taste of home?"

He spoke as he ate another, wanting to confirm if this was the hometown flavor he had forgotten for decades.

Suddenly, Qu Sheng's body stiffened.

Huang Donglai nudged his lips, looking towards a distance.

Following his gaze, Qu Sheng saw Li Mo, sitting on a weapon rack holding a bowl of dumplings, smiling at him. His lip movements seemed to be saying something:

"Happy Winter Solstice, Commander Qu."

"Happy Winter Solstice."

Nodding, Qu Sheng vanished from the spot.

Li Mo let out a breath, and at the same time, a crisp and pleasant notification sounded in his ear.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Qu Sheng, granting him an additional sixty years of lifespan.】

【Investment Feedback: Kongming Wanse Pagoda.】

【Kongming Wanse Pagoda】: "Divided into thirty-six levels, each level is a different color. It can absorb the power of all living beings and refine it, eliminating the distracting thoughts within, making it pure and harmless, and storing it within."

"Note: The consumption is significant. Only ten percent of the purified power of all living beings remains."

"!"

This is like a pillow being送来 when one is sleepy!

Li Mo increasingly felt that Commander Qu was a great person.

Even the rewards from investing were so considerate.

Now, he just needed to find a way to collect some power of all living beings. However, the specifics of how to do it would require careful planning.

"What's wrong?"

"Commander Qu... he is virtuous."

Not long after, the Ice Cube's dumplings were also ready. Li Mo held the bowl and looked down.

It was a bowl of noodle-soup with meat.

And it was black.

Student Li was stunned. He picked up an uncooked masterpiece of the Ice Cube beside him and finally discovered that the edge of the dumpling wrapper had a thin layer of ice.

So the Ice Cube used her True Essence to gather ice, freezing the edge of the dumpling wrapper shut?

That explained why her movements were so fast!

Student Li covered his face. Still, this was the Ice Cube's first time making dumplings. After all, it had both dumpling wrapper and filling, so it was reasonable to call it a bowl of dumplings.

"Then this soup..."

"I thought eating dumplings required vinegar?"

"How much vinegar did you add to the soup?"

"You need soup too?"

Ying Bing tilted her head. Her deep, dark eyes, seen through a layer of cooking smoke, seemed a bit misty.

It was as if she was saying:

'I made this especially for you, are you really not going to try it?'

She seemed to really want to see Li Mo eat the dumplings and praise them endlessly.

But Li Mo remembered last time, when she made stir-fried pork with chili and scrambled eggs with tomatoes, her expression was full of seriousness and the pride of someone who couldn't believe she couldn't do anything well.

Now, why was there an added... small expectation?

"Then, can I have a little taste first..."

"No."

Ying Bing indicated that he was dreaming. A taste wasn't something you could just casually have.

But she lowered her eyes and glanced at the Taiyin Liuxian dress she was wearing.

Then she said softly:

"But there is something else..."

"What is it?"

"It's Happy Winter Solstice."

"Ah?"

Ying Bing pursed her lips, scooped up a spoonful of the vinegar-soaked noodle-skin dumpling filling soup, and while Student Li was confused and had his mouth open, quickly fed it to him.

The Painful Piggy侠 made a comeback.
