# Chapter 118: A Lucky Strike

In the southwestern corner of the "Shrimp Sea" lay Red Shrimp Island, spanning about ten square miles. 

It was high noon, with clear skies and calm seas. 

Flocks of seagulls circled overhead while fishermen cast their nets below. No one noticed the transparent cloud that had silently drifted above the island.

Hidden within the cloud were dozens of cultivators, crouching stealthily as they surveyed the island below.

"Found the Black and Red Twins' cave yet?"

The cloud was naturally Lin Shan's high-grade magic tool, the "Descending Cloud Banner," which he had activated with both "Illusory Cloud" and "Concealment" inscriptions. 

Though they were only dealing with two rogue cultivators this time, they were still Foundation Establishment experts of the same tier. Lin Shan wasn't sure of their exact cultivation levels—early-stage would be manageable, but late-stage would require caution.

With the dozens of cultivators he'd hastily gathered, launching a preemptive strike would be the safest approach.

"Sir, look over there!" 

A subordinate pointed toward a small palace nestled in a mountain hollow on the island's backside. Compared to the surrounding fishing village, the palace stood out like a sore thumb.

"The Black and Red Twins probably forced the island's mortals to build that for them. They're likely cultivating and living in luxury there."

Everyone nodded in agreement, then turned expectantly to Lin Shan, waiting for the envoy to make the first move.

Lin Shan quietly maneuvered the Descending Cloud Banner above the palace, descending to about a hundred meters. A sweep with his spiritual sense revealed that the palace was protected by a barrier against prying eyes.

The Black and Red Twins clearly had some defenses in place. But since there was a barrier, they were almost certainly inside.

Without hesitation, Lin Shan pulled out his high-grade magic tool, the "Five Elements Fan." The fan was crafted from five differently colored feathers, shimmering with the energies of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth.

Under the envious gazes of those around him, Lin Shan channeled his spiritual power, fully activating the metal-element feather.

The Five Elements Fan's strength lay in its ability to switch between elemental attacks, exploiting elemental weaknesses. 

Unsure of the twins' cultivation attributes, Lin Shan opted for metal—the most offensive element—hoping to cripple them with a single surprise attack to make the ensuing fight easier.

As spiritual power poured into the fan, it grew increasingly sharp, its golden glow intensifying until even the white clouds above took on a golden hue.

Once the fan's power peaked, Lin Shan swung it viciously toward the palace below.

A torrent of golden arrows erupted from the fan, blanketing the sky like a golden deluge as they rained down on the palace.

High-grade magic tools were already top-tier, and the Five Elements Fan was among the best. A gift from his sworn brother Lin Fan—who had stumbled upon it in some ancient cave—it was now making its debut.

"Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!"

The wooden palace stood no chance. Even with its protective barrier, it collapsed like paper, sending dust and splinters flying. Shouts of alarm could be heard from within.

The cultivators on the cloud leaned forward eagerly, peering through the settling dust to see the results of their ambush.

"Cough! Cough! Cough!"

About ten breaths later, the dust cleared, revealing three disheveled figures coughing violently.

Covered in grime and blood, their features were barely recognizable. 

A red-robed middle-aged man supported a black-robed one—clearly the infamous Black and Red Twins. But beside them stood a burly, bearded man—an unexpected third party.

It was unclear why this man was on the twins' turf, but the three had apparently been deep in discussion when Lin Shan's attack struck, leaving them all severely wounded.

Lin Shan was surprised. Now that the barrier was broken, his spiritual sense revealed the twins were early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivators, while the bearded man was mid-stage.

He silently praised his foresight. Had he barged in recklessly, he'd have walked straight into a trap with three opponents.

The trio below was utterly bewildered. 

One moment they were chatting; the next, they were nearly killed by a rain of arrows. Only frantic last-minute defenses had saved them.

Their spiritual senses immediately locked onto the cloud above and the dozens of figures lurking on it.

"Who are you? Why attack us?" they roared.

The subordinates on the cloud looked to Lin Shan, awaiting his grand reply.

Clearing his throat, Lin Shan grew cautious upon realizing the third man was mid-stage. Not wanting to reveal his identity, he decided to pin the blame on someone else.

"I am the Mountain Bear Sage, leader of the Eastern Sea pirates! This island is now mine. If you know what's good for you, Black and Red Twins, scram!"

His subordinates exchanged glances—so their envoy had once been a notorious pirate leader in the Eastern Sea?

The trio below froze. The twins turned to the bearded man in confusion.

The bearded man's eyes bulged, veins popping as his tattered robes strained against his fury. His wounds reopened, blood seeping out.

Lin Shan blinked. "Why so angry, friend?"

The bearded man glowered. "Because I am the Mountain Bear Sage."

Silence.

Lin Shan stood awkwardly in the sky. He'd only glimpsed the Mountain Bear Sage once during the Eastern Sea Turtle Island gathering and hadn't recognized him in the chaos. Now he'd accidentally accused the man himself.

But what shocked him more was that the Mountain Bear Sage recognized him after a moment.

"You! I was about to come for you, and here you are, delivering yourself to me?"

Lin Shan stiffened. "You know me?"

"Of course! I'm also a Clean Altar Envoy now—how could I not know you?" The Mountain Bear Sage spat blood, swallowing a healing pill as he glared. "The Black and Red Twins are my brothers. The mortal conversions here are mine. Get lost!"

Now Lin Shan understood. 

The twins had dared to drive his men away because they'd conspired with the Mountain Bear Sage to claim the island's faith resources for themselves. 

Judging by their tone, had he not struck first, they'd have come for him instead.

Lin Shan's voice turned icy. "Do you know the entire Shrimp Sea is my territory?"

The Mountain Bear Sage scoffed. "So what? My fists are bigger. What can you do about it?"

"Aren't you afraid I'll report this to my backer, Protector Yan?"

The Mountain Bear Sage burst into laughter, pointing at Lin Shan as if he were a circus act.

"Know this—I serve a Golden Core Protector from Lu Kingdom! We're natural enemies of you local rats!"

"Before I left, my Protector told me: 'If you see local envoys, steal their merits!'"

"If they don't back down, beat them senseless—or just kill them!"

"We're demonic cultivators! Since when do we follow rules?"

Lin Shan rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Oh? Killing is fine too?"

The Mountain Bear Sage's triumphant rant faltered as he remembered his injuries. He glanced at the twins, only to find them in worse shape, their auras unstable.

The two were giving him reproachful looks—was now really the time for such talk?

Up in the cloud, Lin Shan's eyes narrowed dangerously. He cracked his neck and rolled his shoulders.

"Mountain Bear Sage, is it? Seems I'll be sending you off today."

The bearded man and twins took a step back.

"Wait, brother, let's talk this out—"

"We're fellow disciples—"

"No need for infighting—"

But his plea was cut short by a silver sword streaking down from the heavens!
