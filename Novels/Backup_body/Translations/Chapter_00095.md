# Chapter 95: The Left-Behind Dragon Pillar—Stirring Up Chaos!

During the reign of the founding emperor of the Great Zhou Dynasty, he mobilized the entire nation's resources to gather materials and forge six divine artifacts to suppress chaos in the world. Each of these treasures possessed earth-shaking power.

Among them were the twenty-four Dragon Pillars of the Imperial Hall—majestic and infinitely profound.

Even Gu Changzhou, with his meager True Qi cultivation, had been able to manifest a near-Immortal-level golden dragon from just one of these pillars, demonstrating their immense power.

"The Dragon Pillars of the Imperial Hall are supreme treasures of the Great Zhou court. Only those of royal blood are granted the method to wield them," the Vajra Temple's Buddha Child said, eyeing Gu Changzhou with slight surprise. "Are you of the Great Zhou imperial lineage?"

Gu Changzhou did not respond. Instead, he handed the Dragon Pillar in his possession to Li Zhengjing. But the moment he recalled the stolen spirit stone incident, his hand trembled, and he quickly redirected it to the Buddha Child.

"If infused with spiritual power, this artifact can change size at will—even serving as a palace pillar—and manifest a golden dragon. You may try it, Buddha Child."

"And the method to activate it?" the Buddha Child asked as he took the pillar.

"There is no method," Gu Changzhou replied, shaking his head.

"None?" The Buddha Child was stunned. "The activation technique is a secret passed down only to the imperial bloodline. Without it, the Dragon Pillar cannot display its divine power. Yet earlier, you clearly summoned a golden dragon."

"Just try it, and you'll understand," Gu Changzhou said calmly.

"Very well."

Following his words, the Buddha Child channeled his energy into the pillar without any special technique. Instantly, golden light surged from the Dragon Pillar, coalescing into a golden dragon that soared into the heavens.

Silence fell over the scene.

After a long pause, Li Zhengjing finally spoke.

"Buddha Child, are you also of the Great Zhou imperial bloodline?" He rubbed his chin thoughtfully. "Are you two brothers plotting to silence the Southern Domain Divine Mother but lacking the strength, so you lured me here to be your blade?"

"..."

The Buddha Child remained silent for a long moment before replying, "It's hard to say. I've lived in the Vajra Temple since childhood and know nothing of my lineage."

With that, he withdrew his energy, and the golden dragon in the sky dissipated. He then handed the Dragon Pillar to Li Zhengjing.

Gu Changzhou's eye twitched, but he dared not speak.

Li Zhengjing took the pillar and examined it closely. It was about two feet long, as thick as a forearm, made of an unusual material, heavy to the touch, and entirely golden, with an exquisitely carved dragon coiled around it.

He channeled his True Qi into it, and immediately, the dragon roared to life, surging forth.

"..."

After another long silence, Li Zhengjing rubbed his chin. "I'm the last true descendant of the Li family—definitely not of imperial blood, nor did my ancestors marry into the royal family. Unless... did the Jia clan's ancestors wed a princess? Wait—there's no way all three of us are related to the Great Zhou imperial house, right?"

"It's not a matter of bloodline," Gu Changzhou said helplessly. "Activating the Dragon Pillar doesn't require royal blood—just a secret method passed down exclusively to the imperial family. But neither of you used any method—you just poured your energy into it."

Li Zhengjing's eyes narrowed, and the Buddha Child seemed to realize something as well.

This Dragon Pillar didn't require any special technique to activate.

Had someone reforged it?

Who would dare to tamper with a Great Zhou imperial treasure?

Moreover, to alter the Dragon Pillar's activation method while preserving its divine power—this person's craftsmanship was unfathomable!

"The report I ordered yesterday has come back. None of the twenty-four Dragon Pillars in the capital have gone missing," Gu Changzhou said, his expression complicated. "This isn't one of the known twenty-four."

Li Zhengjing weighed the pillar in his hand. "A counterfeit?"

The Buddha Child shook his head. "It's a genuine Dragon Pillar."

At that moment, Yuan Zhengfeng's voice reached Li Zhengjing's ears.

"I've heard that the founding emperor originally intended to forge thirty-six Dragon Pillars—matching the Thirty-Six Heavenly Stars—but only completed twenty-four. However, the year after their completion, the capital was struck by calamity, with tens of thousands dead in the western district. That was the 'Creditor's' attack the Southern Domain Divine Mother mentioned."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the Divine Mother's remains. If not for the dissipation of Tianjun King's power, her divine body would still hold answers.

"Where did you get this?" the Buddha Child asked.

"From the Luofu Immortal Sect," Gu Changzhou said, his expression darkening. "While I was comprehending the sect's jade wall's divine technique in the back mountain's cave, this pillar suddenly pierced through the cave and landed before me."

"At the time, I didn't know what it was. I used the Luofu Jade Wall's power to suppress it. When I stepped outside, the scene was one of devastation—the sect master..."

His voice faltered. "He had already been beheaded."

Li Zhengjing's expression turned solemn. "You were there. Did you see the Creditor's face?"

Gu Changzhou shook his head. "Only golden dragons filling the sky, converging into a beam of light that shot out from the main hall. No one could stop it—half of our Immortal-level elders were killed or wounded."

"So this Dragon Pillar was left behind by the Creditor?" Li Zhengjing mused.

If the pillars were forged the year before the capital's calamity—now confirmed to be the Creditor's doing—then the founding emperor might have completed all thirty-six pillars, only to lose twelve during the attack.

Perhaps some of those twelve were taken by the Creditor and reforged.

Yuan Zhengfeng's voice grew grave. "When we ambushed the 'Creditor' in the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven, the Luofu Sect was attacked. Now we know it was the same Creditor from eight hundred years ago. But is this one a 'false Creditor' to be harvested, or the mastermind behind them?"

He continued, "Also, why didn't the Creditor retrieve this Dragon Pillar after attacking Luofu?"

Li Zhengjing pondered before replying, "Everyone knows the Dragon Pillars belong solely to the Great Zhou imperial family."

The Buddha Child's eyes lit up in realization. "If a new Dragon Pillar appears, it will cause an uproar—especially for the imperial court."

Gu Changzhou nodded. "I believe the Creditor left it deliberately—likely as a trap for Luofu."

If word spread that a Dragon Pillar was in Luofu's possession, the Great Zhou court would stop at nothing to reclaim it.

But the Luofu Sect, already devastated, would be powerless against the empire. The court could even use this as pretext to annex Luofu, leaving no room for protest.

For Luofu, their sect master dead and elders slaughtered, the appearance of the Creditor with a Dragon Pillar would sow suspicion, fear, and resentment toward the imperial court.

If any hot-tempered members acted rashly, chaos would erupt.

And chaos was precisely what the Creditor sought.

"Before Elder Wan died, he said this pillar was a disaster. Even if the sect tried to conceal it, the Creditor ensured its existence would be known," Gu Changzhou said with a sigh. "So I took it and left the mountain."

The Buddha Child understood. "If rumors spread that Luofu possesses a Dragon Pillar, you'd reveal it beforehand, proving it's in your hands—not Luofu's—before the court could act."

Li Zhengjing frowned. "But you're still a Luofu disciple."

"Not anymore. I've been expelled," Gu Changzhou said.

Li Zhengjing was stunned.

The Buddha Child sighed. "Luofu's internal strife must be worse than imagined."

After a pause, Li Zhengjing sighed again. "Here we stand—two sect traitors out of three."

The Buddha Child took a step back, unfazed.

"Today's crisis forced me to use the Dragon Pillar, sparing Luofu further disaster. But..." Gu Changzhou sighed. "My own calamity may have arrived early."

He hesitated before adding, "With the Dragon Pillar revealed, I can't stay in Lin Yuan Prefecture."

"I'll watch over the Wan family in your stead," the Buddha Child said. "With the Southern Domain Divine Mother dead, the Profound Edge Sword Sect will be shaken. Tomorrow, I'll visit them under the Vajra Temple's name—they'll heed our influence. As for you, now that the Dragon Pillar is exposed, you'll be hunted. You might as well take the blame for slaying a god."

Li Zhengjing nodded. "Well said. Such a feat would shake the world. The glory of godslaying is yours."

"..."

Gu Changzhou shot him a look. "You were the first to strike and the most enthusiastic. Why pin the crime on me?"

"Actually..."

Just then, a voice drifted down from the clouds. "I have a solution."

Everyone turned to see a paper crane fluttering toward them.

"Gu Changzhou, hand it over," the crane said. "Give the Dragon Pillar to Brother Li, and your predicament will be resolved."

Li Zhengjing's brow rose. The voice was familiar. "Fake Medicine Peddler?"

The crane flapped its wings. "Brother Li, such harsh words! My business has always been fair. Even the Fallen Dragon Cave Heaven you left vacant—I'm merely borrowing it temporarily. I've even prepared the Dragon Pillar as rent."

"You took my cave heaven?" Li Zhengjing's voice rose sharply.

"Rented!" the crane corrected.

"Bullshit! What do I need this for? It's a death sentence to carry it!"

"For others, perhaps. For you, it's invaluable—especially in the capital."

"What do you mean?"

"If I'm not mistaken, you're heading to the capital to investigate the Creditor," the crane said. "Moreover, with the Crown Prince's fake death and the court's turmoil—and your father and brother caught in it—will you stand idly by? This artifact could save your life at a critical moment."

Li Zhengjing glanced at the golden page—his fortune remained unchanged.

The crane darted past, plucking something from Gu Changzhou before vanishing.

The Buddha Child raised his alms bowl to intercept but missed.

"My paper crane is a divine technique. Few in this world can catch it," the Fake Medicine Peddler's voice taunted.

Then a small hand reached out and grabbed the crane.

"Waaah! I know you!" the little dragon girl chirped, delighted, tossing aside the now-dull Tianjun Divine Wheel.

Li Zhengjing froze. She had just said she recognized him.

The crane struggled before crumbling to ash.

"Fine, you win," the Fake Medicine Peddler sighed, his voice fading.

Tears welled in the dragon girl's eyes.

Li Zhengjing hurried to comfort her. "It's okay. He's a bad guy for not staying to chat. Cry if you want—just not out loud—"

His vision blurred, and his mind went blank. Desperate, he shoved her tears into his mouth to absorb their spiritual energy.

Then he passed out.

When he awoke, he was on the ground. The dragon girl sat nearby, munching on pastries.

The Buddha Child and Gu Changzhou lay unconscious nearby.

"They all got cried to sleep," Yuan Zhengfeng said.

Li Zhengjing rubbed his temples. "That Fake Medicine Peddler... his origins are no joke."

"The little girl wouldn't talk. She just cries whenever asked," Yuan Zhengfeng said helplessly.

"So this hot potato..." Li Zhengjing picked up the Dragon Pillar. "Is mine now?"

"More importantly, what did that crane take from Gu Changzhou?" Yuan Zhengfeng mused.
