Chapter 97: Please, Don't I Look Like a Bad Guy?

The night shrouded the city of Ziyangfu in silence, like a massive, slumbering beast lying still under the moonlight.

"Be cautious of fire in this dry weather!"

The watchmen's hoarse voices echoed through the empty streets. Recently, the city had been quite restless at night, prompting an increase in the number of guards patrolling the streets. However, their efforts seemed like a drop in the ocean compared to the vastness of the city.

Luo Yao, dressed in dark attire suitable for nighttime, wandered through the city. She had heard from her senior brother that the city was conducting the Wu Jian trial of the Xi Yu Lou, an event where participants not only fought each other but also attracted opportunistic thieves and troublemakers. Deciding to take advantage of the situation, Luo Yao set out to right some wrongs under the cover of night, much like a killer would.

As she passed through an alley, a voice called out to her. "Luo girl, I've been waiting for you."

A gaunt figure emerged from the darkness, his black robes clinging to his body due to the night breeze. "You're quite bold to flaunt a famous weapon in the city, especially without a high-ranking master by your side. I didn't expect you to sneak out alone."

The man's voice was ethereal, and his words seemed to bring a chill to the air, making one's scalp tingle.

"Ye Gui Liu Heng?!" Luo Yao's face turned pale as she recognized the man. Ye Gui was a solitary lineage due to its peculiar cultivation method, requiring a special physique. Practitioners of Ye Gui's arts became emaciated, non-human in appearance, and eccentric. Moreover, their abilities were significantly reduced during the day but amplified at night.

The previous leader of Ye Gui, Liu Heng's master, had died during the siege of the Forest of Jade.

"I love eating children, especially those in their prime like you," Liu Heng sneered. "My father could kill your master, so I'm not afraid of you."

Luo Yao, filled with fear, was the first to attack. Her "gentleman's pen" shot out like a cold star, swift as lightning. However, just as she thought she had succeeded, Liu Heng's figure vanished like a ghost.

"Fake? Hahaha... your Purple Star Eyes are not practiced enough," Liu Heng's voice came from all directions, the sound waves alone sending Luo Yao flying back. She rolled on the ground several times, her pristine clothes now dirty and muddy. Moreover, she felt a pain in her hand and realized she had lost her "gentleman's pen."

"Not bad, a famous weapon. The judge will surely like it," Liu Heng said, pocketing the pen. He walked towards Luo Yao, his back blocking the moonlight.

Luo Yao was filled with regret and despair. She couldn't understand why Liu Heng, who was at the Inner Breath Golden Elixir realm, would shamelessly attack her, who was only at the Blood Qi realm. It was clearly a case of bullying the weak.

As Liu Heng prepared to kill her, a loud explosion occurred. A dark beam of light, like a meteor, smashed towards them.

Liu Heng dodged the attack, and the beam stopped, revealing a tall figure wielding a short-handle hammer. The figure wore a bronze dragon head helmet, and his palm held a powerful, black hammer that seemed to be a mystical weapon.

"A friend from the same path, I presume?" Liu Heng said. "Let's make a deal: you let me have this girl's life, and everything else is yours."

The man in the bronze dragon head helmet smiled. "The Wu Jian trial isn't just about killing each other on sight, is it? We should choose our opponents wisely. You're strong; we might be colleagues in the future. No need for conflict."

Liu Heng agreed, "Alright, let's do as you say. You take care of the girl."

However, as soon as Liu Heng stepped forward, he launched a surprise attack. The man in the helmet was ready, countering with his hammer filled with killing intent.

"You didn't think I'd be honest, did you?" the man said.

Liu Heng's figure flew back and disappeared, only to reappear as multiple ghostly shadows surrounded Luo Yao. However, the man in the helmet closed his eyes, focusing on the killing intent around him.

With a slow and firm motion, he swung his hammer, hitting one of the ghostly shadows. Liu Heng was smashed into a mist of blood.

The man in the helmet then turned to Luo Yao and said, "You should have run when you had the chance."

Luo Yao, still fearful, asked, "Who are you?"

"Call me Northwest Hammer King," he replied, tossing the "gentleman's pen" back to her.

Luo Yao thanked him and asked if he was from any particular sect. "Hard Gang," he replied.

As Luo Yao left, she turned back and asked, "Do you know where Luo Yu of the Forest of Jade is?"

"In the government office," he answered.

Luo Yao finally left, but soon after, another figure cautiously entered the alley. "You're not done yet..."

The Northwest Hammer King thought it was Luo Yao returning, but to his surprise, it was a small, clean beggar girl with a blindfold over her eyes and a basket on her back.

"Excuse me, sir... do you have anything you don't need?" the beggar girl asked.

The Northwest Hammer King was taken aback, unsure how to react.
