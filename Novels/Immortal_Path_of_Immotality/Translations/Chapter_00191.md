# Chapter 189: A Rebellious Bone at the Back of the Head

In the Tempest Sea, yellow and green light clusters stood in fierce opposition. 

Both sides secretly held their breath, fearing the two Nascent Soul mighty cultivators might erupt into battle at any moment, their devastating combat aftermath reducing everyone to dust.

Yan Yuanchun, still with traces of blood at the corner of her mouth, tugged at Immortal Huang's sleeve and shook her head slightly. Yet the stern old man remained unmoved, his resolve as firm as iron.

"Daring to harm my woman—even if it means mutual destruction today, they must pay the price!"

As time ticked away, the tension between the two escalated to a breaking point. Just as everyone was about to flee in panic...

The Pure Lotus Ascetic suddenly withdrew his aura, the green lotus behind him vanishing as he swiftly struck out with five palm strikes. The five Golden Core cultivators from the Violet Firmament Sect were sent flying, each vomiting blood.

Immortal Huang stared in shock at this unexpected turn of events, leaving everyone bewildered.

"These five are now severely injured, balancing the scales with your wife. What say you, fellow Daoist?" The Pure Lotus Ascetic spoke indifferently, as if he hadn't been the one to attack.

He then glanced at the five behind him: "I was merely entrusted by your elders to escort you discreetly, not to fight a life-and-death battle with a peer. Any objections?"

The Violet Firmament Sect members hastily shook their heads, claiming no objections.

They dared not complain—having a Nascent Soul expert save them was already fortunate. Being injured to provide the other side a way to save face was an acceptable compromise.

Yan Yuanchun tugged at Immortal Huang's arm again, signaling him to accept the resolution.

After a moment's silence, Immortal Huang reluctantly withdrew his Dharma Form, glaring hatefully at the five Golden Core cultivators. Though inwardly cursing the old man's pettiness, they outwardly appeared grateful.

Seeing the situation defused, the Pure Lotus Ascetic nodded to Immortal Huang before transforming into a green streak that vanished into the horizon, unconcerned about any potential retaliation.

Immortal Huang watched the departing figure warily but refrained from further action. Not only was the Pure Lotus Ascetic unfathomably powerful, but provoking the Violet Firmament Sect's elders would invite relentless pursuit.

Recalling the Violet Firmament Grand Elder's lightning speed and the epic battle against the Black Lotus Sect's World Honored One's projection, he suppressed his killing intent.

The righteous cultivators wisely made way as Immortal Huang departed with Yan Yuanchun and the demonic fleet. Having narrowly escaped death, everyone was thoroughly exhausted.

Before parting, Lin Fan and Lin Shan exchanged a silent smile across the distance, no words needed. Lei Yuzi watched Lin Shan with mixed emotions, secretly relieved.

Lin Shan turned to gaze at the distant horizon, wondering how long it would be before he returned and what fates awaited his old friends.

Three days later, the flying ship continued its journey across the sea.

Having left Great Song, they entered Great Yan's southern waters—though the maritime territories of eastern coastal nations were similarly named, Great Yan's seas paled in comparison to Great Song's.

As the mainland drew nearer, everyone knew they were about to enter Great Yan's inland cultivation world.

The ship's owner, Protector Yan, had been secluded in the cabin with Nascent Soul expert Immortal Huang for three full days.

As for what the reunited couple had been doing, everyone wisely avoided speculation, busying themselves with their own affairs.

Lin Shan was discussing formation techniques with the Blackbone Skeleton, believing it prudent to learn some array knowledge for future use.

The cabin door creaked open as Immortal Huang emerged hand-in-hand with a flushed Yan Yuanchun.

The old man looked thoroughly satisfied, while Protector Yan appeared shy and delicate—clearly their "Dao discussion" had been most pleasant. The crew promptly offered congratulations.

"Congratulations on your emergence, Patriarch! We rejoice in Protector's recovery!"

Yan Yuanchun hid bashfully behind Immortal Huang, while the old man laughed heartily, motioning for everyone to rise before summoning Luan Chun first.

As Yan Yuanchun's beloved disciple, Luan Chun was treated like a daughter. The three chatted warmly like a reunited family.

Eventually, Immortal Huang called Lin Shan forward.

Lin Shan approached eagerly. Though forced to leave his homeland for distant Lu Country, having a Nascent Soul expert's patronage might turn misfortune into blessing!

If Immortal Huang joined the Black Lotus Sect's headquarters as Protector Yan's consort, he'd become a new Dharma King. With such backing, perhaps Lin Shan could secretly acquire some Black Lotus Buddha statues...

The Blackbone Demon Monarch tagged along, hoping this Nascent Soul connection could accelerate its cultivation. Having fought alongside Immortal Huang before, it expected favorable treatment.

Both approached excitedly, ready to make demands—only for Immortal Huang to suddenly shout:

"Audacious!"

Thud! The skeleton immediately knelt. Whether genuinely frightened or pretending was unclear, but Lin Shan recognized this "sudden intimidation" tactic from Nightingale training.

"During the Eastern Sea mission, you exploited my labor. Explain yourself," Immortal Huang demanded, stroking his beard with an inscrutable expression.

Lin Shan remained composed: "I acted in Protector Yan's name. My achievements reflected well upon her."

Yan Yuanchun nodded approvingly—Lin Shan was undoubtedly her most capable subordinate.

Immortal Huang's momentum faltered. Changing tactics, he accused: "What about forcibly contracting me with that summoning pact?"

Lin Shan responded earnestly: "To ensure everyone's safety. Didn't it save us in the Poison Burial Canyon?"

The demonic cultivators nodded gratefully—Lin Shan had indeed rescued them from deadly miasma.

Frustrated, Immortal Huang revealed his true grievance: "When you buried me in Yan Cloud Mountains, why no coffin? I ate a mouthful of dirt!"

Lin Shan's heart skipped—with enemies nearby, he'd acted hastily. But admitting their shallow friendship wouldn't help now.

Suddenly recalling something, Lin Shan exclaimed: "Ah! I remember—back at Nightingale headquarters, your palace was filled with song and dance, left and right—"

Immortal Huang hastily covered his mouth, sweating slightly: "My mistake, brother."

Yan Yuanchun frowned: "Left and right what?"

Lin Shan glanced at the panicked old man and chuckled: "Nothing important."

"Exactly! Unimportant!" Immortal Huang agreed hurriedly.

The skeleton chimed in: "Quite right! Trivial!"

Realizing Lin Shan held compromising information, Immortal Huang decided distraction was best. Spotting the skeleton, he seized the opportunity.

Putting an arm around Lin Shan, he offered earnest advice: "This skeleton companion of yours is extraordinary—its original form likely exceeds Nascent Soul realm. Once it reaches Golden Core, it may rebel. Best eliminate it preemptively."

Blackbone Demon Monarch: "???"

After trying to help, this old man suggests my execution?

Lin Shan remained confident: "No matter its cultivation, I can suppress it."

Immortal Huang revealed: "It's already late Foundation Establishment!"

"What?" Lin Shan paled—he'd only recently reached mid-Foundation Establishment!

The skeleton's soulfire flickered guiltily as it scratched its skull: "Let me explain—"

"No need!" Lin Shan drew his Severing Water Sword, examining the skeleton for "dignified" dismemberment points.

The crew rushed to intervene, some hugging his limbs, others disarming him: "Leader, calm down!"

"Not the time for infighting!"

Blackbone Demon Monarch's occipital bone did protrude slightly, fueling suspicions of inherent treachery.

Immortal Huang finally mediated: "Enough. Considering its years of service, spare its life."

The skeleton bowed gratefully, but Immortal Huang produced a golden contract page: "Death penalty waived, but punishment remains. This Golden Contract will bind it even at Golden Core realm."

Lin Shan accepted joyfully as the system identified:

[Contract Page]
Quality: Golden Contract
Description: Crafted from Kui ox hide, binding Golden Core and below beings under heavenly law. Violators perish utterly.
Enhancement Cost: 64 points

Dictating harsh terms—unconditional obedience in exchange for cultivation assistance—Lin Shan forced the skeleton to sign.

The demonic monarch lamented its ruined plans to surpass Lin Shan and seize treasures. Now even Golden Core freedom was lost—only Nascent Soul could break these shackles.

For the Primordial Spirit Treasure... it would endure.

---

Their journey continued smoothly under Nascent Soul protection. Previously anxious about the future, the crew now anticipated prosperous days as vassals of a new Dharma King.

Only the skeleton sat apart, reassembling its ribs mournfully.

Lin Shan cultivated diligently, his eyesight sharpening from Phantom Spirit Liquid until he could perceive the ship's formations clearly. Combined with Astral Plate tempering, both body and soul grew stronger daily.

After over a year traversing millions of miles, Lu Country finally appeared on the horizon.
