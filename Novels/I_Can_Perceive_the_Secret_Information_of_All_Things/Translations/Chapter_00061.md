# Chapter 61: There's Always a Way Out  

Qian Duoyu was quite pleased with this outcome.  

Compared to getting a few bites of the Skywing Tiger Demon's meat, he was enjoying this motherly experience far more.  

Xiao Ji also found this result satisfactory—earning spirit stones this way was much easier than through slaughter.  

Standing outside the cave entrance, both men felt the air had become fresher.  

"Let's head back to Taigu City now," Xiao Ji said. "Don't forget the payment for teaming up this time."  

"Brother Xiao, rest assured. I, Qian Duoyu, never owe money," Qian Duoyu replied confidently.  

Xiao Ji didn’t need his perception ability to know this was true. The son of a mine owner wouldn’t care about trifling sums. If he was in a particularly good mood, he might even throw in a little extra.  

Just as they were about to leave, a thunderous tiger roar shook the mountains, startling flocks of birds into flight.  

Xiao Ji quickly scanned for the source of the danger.  

A winged tiger descended from the sky, landing on a massive boulder seventy zhang away, cracking the sturdy rock beneath its paws. The beast was enormous, its wingspan rivaling that of a roc.  

A tiger with wings—truly a majestic sight.  

There was no need to guess—this was the Skywing Mother Tiger that had fought the cultivators. Against all odds, it had returned alive.  

Though alive, the tiger was covered in blood, riddled with wounds, and still had magical artifacts embedded in its body.  

In Xiao Ji’s eyes, this Skywing Mother Tiger was at the end of its life, its demonic power completely depleted. Only sheer willpower had brought it back here.  

Its gaze was fixed on the bundle in Qian Duoyu’s arms.  

The cub in his embrace stirred at the sound of the roar, but exhaustion weighed heavily on it. After blinking twice, it closed its eyes again and nestled deeper into the warmth of its makeshift cradle.  

**[Skywing Mother Tiger, Tier 2 early-stage demon beast. Three days ago, eighteen Qi Refinement Perfection cultivators came to capture tigers. The last seven remaining Skywing Tigers fought fiercely for days.]**  

**[All eighteen cultivators and six Tier 1, Rank 6-10 tiger demons perished. Only this mother tiger returned.]**  

**[It only wishes to see if its cub is safe. If it is, the mother will move it to a more secure location.]**  

Tier 2 demon beasts were indeed ferocious. Leading six weaker tigers, this mother had slaughtered eighteen Qi Refinement Perfection cultivators.  

Though the Nine Nether Valley was a place frequented only by low-level cultivators, it was still perilous beyond measure.  

According to Xiao Ji’s perception, this mother tiger was already dead—only a final breath, a single unyielding thought, kept it standing.  

Xiao Ji signaled Qian Duoyu not to move. Any sudden action might provoke the mother tiger into attacking.  

"Stay calm. As long as you don’t move, it won’t charge at you," Xiao Ji said. "Keep your emotions steady too... Then, slowly raise the cub above your head and walk toward the mother tiger."  

Qian Duoyu gasped. "Walk toward it?"  

Was this feeding himself to the tiger? Voluntarily walking into its jaws?  

"Exactly. Trust me. If you do as I say, everything will be fine," Xiao Ji assured. "It’s on its last legs. There’s no need for a fight. If it truly lashes out in rage, I won’t be able to stop it."  

Xiao Ji could not only read human intentions but also understand the thoughts of beasts.  

The Skywing Mother Tiger was incredibly fast. It no longer cared for its own life. If it unleashed one final attack, the sheer force of a Tier 2 demon beast would be nearly impossible to withstand head-on.  

And Qian Duoyu, a mere Qi Refinement fifth-stage cultivator, stood no chance of escape.  

Thus, Xiao Ji’s plan was the best option. Letting the mother tiger see her cub would dispel her fury and avert disaster.  

Though this was their first meeting and they hadn’t spent much time together, Qian Duoyu found this slightly more handsome Taoist entirely trustworthy.  

Just as Qian Duoyu began following Xiao Ji’s instructions, the latter suddenly turned his gaze southeast, a hundred zhang away.  

A figure, swift as lightning, appeared behind the mother tiger. A deafening crash followed.  

The Skywing Mother Tiger’s body twisted grotesquely as a massive iron hammer smashed into it, sending the beast crashing through thick trees. It lay motionless, emitting only pitiful whimpers.  

Xiao Ji focused on the man who had struck the fatal blow.  

The attacker had been too far away earlier, so Xiao Ji hadn’t sensed him.  

"Such a savage beast—too wild to tame. A pity," the man muttered. He wore white robes, appeared to be in his forties, and had a thick beard.  

Among cultivators, appearances rarely revealed true age, but they often hinted at personality and habits.  

**[Mighty Fist True Person, third-generation senior disciple of the Hammer Heaven Sect. Early Foundation Establishment stage. Hammer cultivator. Cultivation technique: Heavenfall Hammer. Prefers swift, decisive strikes, attacking when least expected.]**  

The cub in Qian Duoyu’s arms stirred again at the mother tiger’s agonized cries, weakly opening its eyes to seek the source of the sound, as if drawn by something familiar.  

Seeing the bloodied mother tiger, Qian Duoyu tightened his hold on the cub, shielding it from the gruesome sight.  

"You there—ah, Qi Refinement fifth stage?" Mighty Fist True Person eyed the cultivator holding the cub. "Bold of you. Though the Nine Nether Valley isn’t the most treacherous place, with your level, you’re lucky to have made it this deep. But I doubt you’ll be as lucky leaving."  

His gaze then shifted to Xiao Ji. After assessing his cultivation level, the True Person’s expression turned dismissive.  

"Originally, I planned to capture an adult Skywing Tiger Demon. But now that my men and the tigers have wiped each other out, I suppose I’ll settle for taking this cub back," Mighty Fist True Person said, resting his massive hammer on his shoulder. "I’m sure the sect master’s daughter will love this gift."  

He didn’t bother asking for the others’ opinions. To him, everything here was already his.  

The world of cultivation operated on the law of the jungle. Plundering treasures was commonplace. While mortals might still pay lip service to virtues like benevolence and righteousness, in the wilds beyond civilization, strength dictated all.  

Killing and looting were routine.  

**[Mighty Fist True Person brought eighteen fellow disciples to capture Skywing Tiger Demons solely to gift one to the sect master’s daughter.]**  

**[The daughter of the Hammer Heaven Sect’s master casually mentioned wanting a flying tiger as a pet, hence their presence here.]**  

**[Knowing how difficult it would be to capture a Skywing Tiger, Mighty Fist True Person let his disciples die first while he lurked in the shadows, waiting for the right moment.]**  

**[Now, that moment had come—he intended to seize the cub from Qian Duoyu’s arms.]**  

When faced with a stronger opponent coveting what you possess, the wisest course is to feign compliance and reclaim it later.  

But Xiao Ji knew today’s situation was different.  

He predicted the likely outcome.  

**[If Qian Duoyu refuses to hand over the cub, Mighty Fist True Person will crush him with a single hammer strike. To cover his tracks, he’ll then smash you into paste as well.]**  

His teammate was a stubborn young cultivator from a wealthy family. But in this environment, money solved nothing—it only made one a more tempting target.  

If their enemy realized how many treasures Qian Duoyu carried, even a chance encounter would end with him dead and his possessions stolen.  

"This is troublesome," Xiao Ji murmured, his gaze shifting to the dying mother tiger. "But there’s always a way out."
