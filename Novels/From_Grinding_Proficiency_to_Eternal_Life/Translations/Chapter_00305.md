# Chapter 305: Ten Extremes Martial Path

He slightly furrowed his brow, his voice low and deep. "The Sword Burial Abyss today... the malevolent energy is abnormally restless.明明之前已经观测，今日潮汐最低才是。"

Cui Yu gazed at the malevolent energy twisting and rising like a flood dragon from the abyss below, pondering aloud, "Perhaps a sword-type divine weapon, dormant for many years, has awakened, stirring the malevolent energy at the bottom of the abyss."

Bi Yuan's fingertips unconsciously stroked the Sect Master's jade token at his waist, his mind somewhat unsettled.

He shook his head slightly; perhaps he was overthinking things.

At the bottom of the abyss.

The surging, immense sword intent within Dugu Jiu's body suddenly stagnated. A barely perceptible ripple passed through his turbid eyes. The originally raging sword intent, like a furious tide, slowly retracted, once again hiding within that decrepit frame.

Xu Yunfan's tense muscles relaxed slightly, and surprise flashed in his eyes. Had this old monster actually retracted his hand at this critical moment?

His gaze swept over Dugu Jiu's withered, skeletal hands, and he suddenly realized. Three hundred years of barely clinging to life had already eroded this body, leaving it full of holes. The momentary outburst of sword intent just now had likely caused cracks in the secret arts that sustained his vitality.

Spider-web-like dark青black patterns appeared on the back of Dugu Jiu's hand, a clear sign that his body could barely withstand the flow of sword qi.

Facing Xu Yunfan's gaze, Dugu Jiu didn't mind at all. He raised his hand and looked at the slowly fading dark青black veins on its back, suddenly letting out a sigh.

"Life, aging, sickness, and death come to all. Where is longevity to be found?"

He looked up at Xu Yunfan, his voice low and deep. "I have heard of you. In these past few days, you have become extremely famous in the Dao Sect. Since Bi Yuan chose you, you must have exceptional qualities. When the Heavenly Demons descend, there will be a sliver of hope for us."

A slight change occurred in Xu Yunfan's expression.

This Dugu Jiu actually knew everything.

Dugu Jiu looked at Xu Yunfan's guarded posture, the corners of his emaciated mouth slightly curling into a profound smile. "Go on, choose your divine weapon. In the endless abyss below, there are three divine weapons with the potential to reach the eighth rank..."

Before he could finish, his turbid eyes suddenly became as deep as an abyss, his voice carrying the hoarseness of ages. "The Nine Celestial Sect's *Nine Celestial Swallowing Qi Technique*, the Sword Pavilion's *Void Bright Cleansing Sword Technique*, the Maitreya Temple's *Changing Sinus Marrow Cleansing Art*, the Xuanzhen Sect's *Dragon and Tiger Pill Technique*, the Dao Sect's *Pure Yang One Qi Technique*... I have complete versions of all of them."

Dugu Jiu's slightly hunched body slowly straightened.

"Back then, I intended to follow the path of ten thousand laws converging into one. I sat meditating in the Sword Mound for a hundred years, melting a hundred scriptures into a single furnace, finally achieving a flawless body, reaching the state of perfection, accomplishing Zhou Tian Wu Xiang..."

Dugu Jiu's voice was like the scraping of a rusty sword—aged, withered, yet carrying a sacredness that pierced through the ages.

"Are you willing to learn? Zhou Tian Wu Xiang, ten thousand laws return to nothingness, to achieve the Ten Extremes Martial Path?"

"How does it compare to the Dao Sect's Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock?"

His Adam's apple bobbed, his heart stirred.

"The Twelve Techniques of the Golden Pass and Jade Lock?" Dugu Jiu's face showed disdain. "A mere method for locking life and prolonging existence, how can it compare to the martial path I forged by melting a hundred scriptures?"

"My martial path has taken the human body's martial arts to the extreme. By melting a hundred scriptures, comprehending the form of a hundred years, I have touched the very limit of the martial path."

He paused, his gaze burning as he continued, "If you use the Ten Extremes Martial Path to condense true qi, you will have hope of breaking through the limit of the ninth realm and stepping into the Land of the Immortals in the future."

*Bang!*

The ground stones shattered into spiderweb-like cracks. Xu Yunfan's knees slammed into the ground, kicking up three feet of dust.

This kowtow was completely unexpected, even causing Dugu Jiu's turbid pupils to tremble slightly. He saw Xu Yunfan's forehead pressed tightly against the sword-marked ground, yet his spine remained as straight as a spear.

"Senior, this junior is willing to learn!"

"...Hahaha!"

Dugu Jiu was stunned for a moment, then his laughter shook the malevolent energy at the bottom of the abyss into a frenzy.

"Good! Good! Good!"

Dugu Jiu looked at Xu Yunfan with a face full of admiration.

"Most worldly martial artists value their dignity, but you... have given this old man a different feeling."

After speaking, as Xu Yunfan looked up, Dugu Jiu's figure vanished like a streak of sword light. The malevolent energy at the bottom of the abyss calmed down, leaving only a scroll of strange beast hide with dark golden patterns appearing before Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan stood up and called out several times.

"Senior? Senior!"

Seeing no further response, Xu Yunfan's mind relaxed slightly, but his mood was not particularly high.

Dugu Jiu was a man of unpredictable moods, but from his life trajectory, he was a thoroughly selfish person. For him to so generously hand over this Ten Extremes Martial Path, which he had painstakingly comprehended, was definitely not without purpose.

Unfortunately...

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but glance at his attribute panel.

If he didn't have the attribute panel, no matter how brilliantly Dugu Jiu described this Ten Extremes Martial Path, he wouldn't touch it in the slightest.

He unrolled it. On the hide, ten human meridian diagrams were outlined in cinnabar, each accompanied by obscure ancient seal script recording the essential formulas for each realm of the Ten Extremes Martial Path, from "Body Forging Extreme Realm" to "Zhou Tian Wu Xiang." The last page even marked the four characters "Land of the Immortals," with a sharp brushstroke like a sword carving, clearly added by Dugu Jiu in his later years.

However, this "Land of the Immortals" was merely Dugu Jiu's speculation; its truth still needed to be verified.

*'You have acquired the Ten Extremes Martial Path (Gold)'*

Seeing a message float out in his vision, Xu Yunfan's expression brightened. He truly hadn't expected Dugu Jiu to be so sincere, actually giving him this peerless divine skill.

But the more this happened, the more cautious Xu Yunfan became. If he were to encounter Dugu Jiu in the future, he would have to be extremely careful. For the other party to act this way, his scheme must be enormous.

He couldn't fathom the other's thoughts.

Xu Yunfan subconsciously touched his chest.

Unfortunately, ever since Yu Congling's Extreme Dao Remnant Body entered the White Jade Palace in the Small World Secret Realm and spoke a few words, it had shown no further reaction. Otherwise, he could have found an opportunity to ask about this matter.

After roughly skimming through the *Ten Extremes Martial Path*, a new message popped up on the attribute panel in his vision.

*'You skimmed through the Ten Extremes Martial Path like swallowing a date, gaining nothing.'*

As expected, it works!

But now was not the time to cultivate this technique; obtaining a divine weapon was the priority.

Xu Yunfan shot down towards the bottomless abyss. On the way, he faintly heard Dugu Jiu's sigh coming from deep within the malevolent energy: "When Heavenly Demons devour martial artists, it is like chewing wax. Only those who have reached the Extreme Dao can devour their marrow in return. Little one, practice hard. Don't let the Heavenly Demons descend and turn you into a dish for the other party..."

These words made the hair on his back stand up, making him even more certain that Dugu Jiu probably knew more secrets about the Heavenly Demons.

Xu Yunfan's figure was like lightning, passing through layers of surging malevolent energy, and finally reached the deepest part of the abyss bottom.

The scene before him made him catch his breath. Four divine weapons floated within a dark purple vortex of malevolent energy, each emanating a completely different pressure, as if waiting for their true fated one.

A dark purple long staff, its body entwined with fine lightning patterns, slowly writhing like a living creature. The head of the staff was carved into a fierce dragon head, its mouth slightly open as if capable of swallowing heavenly thunder. The tail of the staff was carved with the ancient seal script characters "Lei Ji" (Thunder Punishment), with faint arcs of electricity jumping about.
