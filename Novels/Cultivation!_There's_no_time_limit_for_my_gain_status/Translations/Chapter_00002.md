# Chapter 2: Body Strengthening Pill  

Jiang Li couldn't help but feel excited. This cheat ability had only one purpose—to modify the duration of status effects.  

Clicking the plus sign increased the duration by one minute, while holding it for five seconds turned it into infinity.  

Clicking the minus sign reduced the duration by one minute, and holding it for five seconds removed the status entirely.  

What did this mean?  

It meant that every pill he took from now on would have a permanent effect!  

Every buff he gained would last forever!  

The only drawback was that this cheat ability couldn't affect certain statuses without a duration.  

For example, **[Hunger]**. If he never ate, how could he expect hunger to disappear on its own?  

He still had to eat. After tending to his injuries and getting dressed, Jiang Li finally stepped out of the carriage.  

The sky was already darkening, and in the twilight, he saw a campfire not far away, its smoke curling upward. The breeze carried the enticing aroma of roasted meat.  

"Being alive again is such a blessing. This smells way better than the charred mess I made earlier."  

Jiang Li walked toward the food distribution area. As he approached, he saw a group of boys and girls around his age sitting together, chatting and laughing.  

When they noticed Jiang Li, their voices lowered, and they turned to look at him with mocking and disdainful gazes.  

Ignoring their blatant pointing and whispering, he calmly walked through the crowd to the long table where food was being handed out.  

Jiang Li was late—the pot of meat soup was nearly empty. However, since many of the girls in the group had small appetites, there was still plenty of roasted meat and steamed buns left.  

The person distributing the food was a towering man in black martial attire, his face marked with an ugly scar.  

The man glanced at Jiang Li, scraped the last bit of soup from the pot, grabbed a piece of roasted meat and a steamed bun, and carelessly shoved the tray toward him.  

The already meager soup spilled out completely from the rough handling.  

Jiang Li silently took the tray and suddenly remembered he had a built-in **[Appraisal]** skill. He discreetly cast it on the black-clad man.  

**[Name: Unknown, Gender: Male, Profession: Martial Artist, Danger Level: Extremely Dangerous!]**  

Jiang Li was startled. He hadn’t expected a random appraisal to reveal an "extremely dangerous" individual. While part of it was due to his current weakness, the red **[Extremely Dangerous]** text made him instinctively want to stay far away.  

---  

He clearly couldn’t sit with the other boys and girls, so he carried his tray back to the carriage and ate while sitting on its edge.  

**[Consumed Roasted Meat*1, Consumed Steamed Bun*1, Hunger status removed, Satiety applied to self.]**  

**[Satiety: Restores 1 Stamina per minute, Duration: 30 minutes] (-+)**  

Jiang Li was delighted. After holding the plus sign for five seconds:  

**[Satiety: Restores 1 Stamina per minute, Duration: ∞] (-)**  

Another new status, and an incredibly useful one at that.  

As long as he didn’t foolishly remove it himself, he would never have to worry about hunger again.  

Moreover, restoring 1 Stamina per minute was significant—equivalent to eating 48 meals a day for an ordinary person. With some light exercise, he could practically become a perpetual motion machine.  

Just then, three boys stood up from the crowd and walked toward him, carrying wooden sticks with clear ill intent.  

Jiang Li felt a surge of anger, but after glancing at his pitiful stats, he could only sigh.  

Before they reached him, he quickly left, circling around to sit near the white-robed "immortals" and black-clad martial artists leading the group.  

He didn’t dare get too close, but neither did the bullies dare cause trouble in front of these figures.  

After muttering some insults about cowardice and shamelessness, the three tossed aside their sticks and returned to the crowd.  

"It seems I can’t wait until we reach the sect. I need to get stronger now."  

"Those self-proclaimed 'protectors' have clearly discovered the joy of bullying. Without strength, they’ll do anything."  

"But how? This body isn’t just weak—it’s worse than a farmer’s son."  

Jiang Li opened his status panel. Despite being only a dozen steps away, the "immortals" and martial artists showed no reaction. Though he had expected as much, he still sighed in relief.  

After reviewing his stats, he realized his only hope for improvement lay in the **[Sui Hu Gong]** and **[Mountain-Splitting Sword]**, two martial arts techniques from the mundane world.  

Searching his memories, he learned more about martial artists in this world.  

Unlike the lofty immortals, martial artists were far more grounded. With proper training, almost anyone could become one.  

Similar to the wuxia novels from his past life, martial artists here were divided into three tiers: External, Internal, and Innate.  

External martial artists were still within the realm of ordinary human limits. But once someone broke through to Internal mastery, gaining the mysterious "inner energy," they could wield weapons and techniques to defeat dozens or even hundreds of opponents.  

Jiang Li’s father, Jiang Yuanshan, had been such an Internal master—a top-tier expert in the martial world.  

Wait.  

Jiang Li suddenly turned to look at the black-clad martial artists sitting nearby.  

He remembered now—his father had warned him before leaving to treat everyone with respect, because even those who seemed like mere attendants were all Internal masters.  

Until he truly stepped onto the path of immortality, if Jiang Li died, no one would spare a second glance for a mere mortal.  

Better to focus on improving himself.  

Recalling the details of **[Sui Hu Gong]**, Jiang Li sat cross-legged and began the practice as described.  

*Clack his teeth thirty-six times, cup the back of his head with interlaced fingers, press palms against ears, breathe slowly nine times...*  

*Inhale and hold, swirl the tongue to produce saliva, rinse mouth thirty-six times, swallow in three gulps...*  

Gradually, Jiang Li entered a meditative state. A deep, rumbling sound, like a tiger’s snore, resonated from his chest and nose.  

On his status panel, **[Sui Hu Gong]** quietly leveled up from **Lv0** to **Lv1**.  

Things were looking up.  

But Jiang Li hadn’t considered one problem—he was sitting far too close to the immortals.  

His quiet presence had gone unnoticed, but now, with the sun barely set, his loud "tiger snoring" was impossible to ignore.  

The three white-robed immortals, who had been conversing, exchanged glances, clearly displeased at being disturbed by a mortal—even one who might become their junior disciple.  

One of them flicked his sleeve, summoning a gust of wind that sent Jiang Li tumbling out of his meditative state. He landed hard on the ground, utterly disoriented.  

*Thud!*  

Before Jiang Li could regain his senses, something hard struck his chest.  

"Stay away. This is your compensation."  

The immortal didn’t even turn around, just waved dismissively for him to leave.  

Jiang Li stood, bowed, and quickly retreated.  

Only after returning to his carriage did his expression darken.  

Objectively, Jiang Li had indeed taken advantage of their presence and disturbed them.  

As immortals, they could have easily killed him for the offense. The fact that they merely woke him and even gave compensation spoke volumes about their restraint.  

But Jiang Li was still furious.  

Having lived in a lawful society for over twenty years, being knocked down and then having something thrown at him felt like blatant humiliation.  

No matter the justification, being treated like that would anger anyone.  

The sheer arrogance—the way they didn’t even see him as human—stung deeply.  

Coupled with the sudden transmigration, the helplessness and vulnerability made his desire for strength and immortality burn fiercely.  

It took several deep breaths to calm himself. Thankfully, his current level was so low that he couldn’t even suffer a qi deviation. Otherwise, an internal injury would have been disastrous.  

Vowing to be more cautious around immortals in the future, Jiang Li examined the object that had struck his chest.  

It was a pitch-black pill, the size of a broad bean, emitting a faint fragrance.  

Coming from an immortal, this had to be a legendary cultivation pill.  

If Jiang Li were more hot-headed, he might have thrown it on the ground and stomped on it in defiance.  

But that would have been suicidal.  

Besides, with his cheat ability, the first pill’s value to him was hundreds of times greater than to others.  

After weighing his options, Jiang Li abandoned any thoughts of a "protagonist-style" defiance and chose pragmatism.  

**[Appraisal]!**  

The all-purpose skill revealed a line of text above the pill:  

**[Name: Body Strengthening Pill]**  
**[Type: Pill]**  
**[Grade: Low Yellow Tier]**  

The **Lv1 Appraisal** was disappointingly limited. He’d have to spam it on everything to level it up.  

Jiang Li didn’t know what "Low Yellow Tier" meant, but since it was casually tossed to him, it couldn’t be anything too valuable.  

Still, for a mortal like him, it was undoubtedly precious.  

As the name suggested, the pill would strengthen his body—exactly what he needed.  

Without hesitation, he swallowed it.  

Soon, a warm current spread from his stomach, flowing through his limbs.  

Two new notifications appeared:  

**[Consumed Body Strengthening Pill. Body Strengthening applied to self.]**  
**[Body Strengthening: Enhances physical attributes, boosts cultivation speed for body-refining techniques up to Mid Yellow Tier. Duration: 2 hours] (-+)**  

Jiang Li didn’t even read the details before holding the plus sign for five seconds.  

**[Body Strengthening: Enhances physical attributes, boosts cultivation speed for body-refining techniques up to Mid Yellow Tier. Duration: ∞] (-)**  

The effects were as expected, though the extent of the enhancement remained to be seen.  

Fortunately, the pampered young masters and misses had set up tents by the campfire for the night, leaving the cold, hard carriage undisturbed.  

Bathed in the pill’s warmth, Jiang Li resumed his **[Sui Hu Gong]** training.  

The rumbling "tiger snore" returned as the medicinal energy steadily absorbed into his body, strengthening his bones and muscles.  

In the cultivation world, a Low Yellow Tier pill was indeed the lowest grade, useful only for beginners.  

But for a mortal like Jiang Li, it was a treasure.  

His **[Sui Hu Gong]**, while a top-tier martial art in the mundane world, was worthless in the eyes of immortals.  

Yet paired with the pill, its effects were astonishing.  

Six hours later, when Jiang Li awoke, the moon hung high in the sky.  

Exhaling deeply, he felt refreshed—better than ever before.  

Standing up, he found his legs weren’t numb despite sitting for so long. His blood flowed smoothly, his body light and agile.  

Eagerly, he checked his status:  

**[Name: Jiang Li]**  
**[Age: 13]**  
**[Race: Human]**  
**[Main Profession: Martial Artist, Tier: Third-Rate]**  
**[Sub-Profession 1: None]**  
**[Sub-Profession 2: None]**  
**[Health: 204/260]**  
**[Stamina: 180/180]**  
**[Strength: →]**  
**[Speed: →]**  
**[Constitution: →]**  
**[Spirit: 1]**  
**[Comprehension: ]**  
**[Techniques: Sui Hu Gong Lv2]**  
**[Skills: Appraisal Lv1, Mountain-Splitting Sword Lv1]**  
**[Buffs: Slow Healing, Satiety, Body Strengthening]**  
**[Debuffs: None]**  

Jiang Li’s eyes lit up.  

His Strength and Speed had increased, his Constitution had jumped, and **[Sui Hu Gong]** had reached **Lv2**.  

A single session had brought such gains—how could he not be thrilled?  

Immortal pills lived up to their reputation.  

And Jiang Li suspected that **[Sui Hu Gong]**’s low grade and level had limited the pill’s full potential.  

Six hours of **[Body Strengthening]** was equivalent to three pills. Given his original weak physique, the improvements could have been even greater.
