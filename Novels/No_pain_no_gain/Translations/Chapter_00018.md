# Chapter 18: Fourth Layer of Evergreen Art

Mo Juren naturally wouldn't hand over the original manual of the Evergreen Art to Han Zhen. He could provide the cultivation formulas, but the spells recorded within were absolutely not to be revealed. This was also the fundamental reason why Yu Zitong’s Primordial Spirit, hidden within his body, repeatedly assured him that he could control Han Zhen.

Mo Juren had already studied the Evergreen Art countless times; he could recite it backward. Taking out paper and brush, Mo Juren began to silently transcribe the formulas for the Evergreen Art in front of Han Zhen. Han Zhen couldn't help but praise his elegant calligraphy.

A quarter of an hour later, Mo Juren put down his brush after the final stroke. "The first six layers of the Evergreen Art are all here. If you can't even get started, the rest would be useless to you anyway. After all, this is something I obtained at the cost of vast sums of gold."

Han Zhen channeled his Mad Boa Force's purest True Qi, and his fair, finely jointed hand gently swept over the paper, drying the ink. This display showed Han Zhen's perfect control over True Qi, making Mo Juren realize that he had underestimated Han Zhen's talent and strength.

Han Zhen quickly scanned the formulas for the first three layers, which were indeed identical to what he had already cultivated. However, Han Zhen still whispered with suspicion, "You're giving it to me so readily? Are you sure there aren't any omissions in the formulas, intentionally preventing cultivation?"

Even a seasoned veteran like Mo Juren was provoked by Han Zhen’s suspicious nature, and he couldn't help but retort coldly, "Hmph, what kind of person do you take me for? I naturally won't go back on my word. If you don't believe me, just wait for Han Li to come out of seclusion and verify it with him; everything will be clear then!"

"Indeed, it was my over-suspicion, junior." Han Zhen reached out to put away the Evergreen Art, but Doctor Mo suddenly extended his hand, trying to grab Han Zhen's wrist. Han Zhen narrowly pulled his hand back, avoiding contact. He looked up at Mo Juren with an displeased expression and asked, "Elder Mo, what do you mean by this?"

If Han Zhen hadn't cultivated the Evergreen Art to a certain degree, giving him spiritual senses far surpassing ordinary people, Mo Juren might have succeeded. If he had touched Han Zhen's wrist and exposed that Han Zhen had already cultivated the Evergreen Art successfully, a fierce battle would have been unavoidable. Han Zhen wasn't afraid of Mo Juren, but he was wary of the seventh-layer Qi Condensation cultivator, Yu Zitong, inside him.

"Hmph, just a reminder. If you reveal the Evergreen Art to outsiders, even if you truly succeed in cultivating it, don't even think about getting the subsequent parts from me," Mo Juren warned with a cold snort.

"Naturally, that's how it should be." Han Zhen calmly put away the formulas for the first six layers of the Evergreen Art. He had made so many preparations to obtain the Evergreen Art early, but he never expected to get his hands on it in such an uneventful manner. Of course, Han Zhen was more than happy about this; wasn't preparing thoroughly in advance precisely for the purpose of minimizing risk?

While he could delay giving Han Li a martial arts manual for now, Han Zhen had not forgotten the other purpose of his trip: to fulfill his agreement with Zhang Tie. After all, Zhang Tie possessed a true spiritual root. Helping him embark on the path of cultivation might prove beneficial in certain situations later on; sometimes, a single piece of information could play a crucial role. This was also why Han Zhen had not prevented Zhang Tie from cultivating the Elephant Armor Art; its minor side effects were negligible for a cultivator. On the contrary, having a foundation in body tempering would allow him to achieve twice the results with half the effort if he found a suitable body-refining cultivation method in the future.

Perhaps Zhang Tie had changed his training location, as Han Zhen had searched for him at the Red Water Peak waterfall, where Zhang Tie often cultivated in Divine Hands Valley, but to no avail. Calculating the time, he should be returning soon, as there likely wasn't a suitable place for Zhang Tie to cultivate within Divine Hands Valley. Furthermore, a wooden tub for medicinal baths was already prepared outside the bamboo house, filled with a foul-smelling herbal concoction.

So, Han Zhen slowly stood up, appearing as if he was about to turn and leave. But just as he was about to step away, he suddenly turned back and asked, "How long did it take Han Li to get started with this Evergreen Art?"

Mo Juren narrowed his eyes slightly, recalling for a moment before replying, "It took me a great many precious medicinal ingredients, and it also took a full year for him to initially grasp its fundamentals."

Han Zhen listened in silence, seemingly pondering something inwardly. After a moment, he looked up at Mo Juren and said with a firm tone, "That long? If I still haven't comprehended the essence of this scripture and stepped onto the path of cultivation within three months, I'm afraid I'll have to trouble you again, senior. And if I still don't see my brother's figure by then, this junior will certainly not let the matter rest!"

A cold glint flashed in Mo Juren's eyes, and he chuckled softly. "Since you have such resolve, then I shall wait and see. However, this Evergreen Art is vastly different from the internal cultivation method you practice. Without talent, even if one spends their entire life, they might find it difficult to get started." His words clearly carried a hint of provocation, deliberately trying to incite Han Zhen. This way, if the young man truly possessed a 'spiritual root' and could cultivate the Evergreen Art, he would surely be unable to resist coming to show off. By then, Mo Juren could make preparations immediately. With two bodies possessing spiritual roots, Doctor Mo thought, his potential conflicts with Yu Zitong could be greatly mitigated. He had never truly trusted Yu Zitong; as an experienced veteran, how could he not always have a backup plan?

"Then please wait and see, Elder Mo!" Han Zhen replied with great self-assurance.

Mo Juren sneered; after all, he was just a young man, full of youthful arrogance.

Just then, Han Zhen suddenly heard rapid yet heavy footsteps. Following the sound, he saw Zhang Tie, now noticeably taller, running towards the bamboo house, carrying a large bucket in each hand. Not far behind him, a beautiful and spirited bird followed along, eventually landing in the distance. Zhang Tie, wearing a thin green cloth shirt, was steaming and covered in sweat. He put down the buckets and walked over.

Zhang Tie was momentarily stunned to see Han Zhen sitting leisurely opposite Doctor Mo, whom he usually feared. Before he could speak, Han Zhen spoke first, "This must be Elder Mo's other disciple, I presume? Little Li mentioned him before; this is my first time seeing him."

Though Zhang Tie was honest, he wasn't slow-witted. He instantly understood the meaning behind Han Zhen's words. He merely nodded dumbly, gave Han Zhen a foolish grin, and subtly held up two fingers, avoiding Mo Juren's gaze. Zhang Tie hadn't forgotten his agreement with Han Zhen, discreetly signaling that he hadn't yet broken through to the third layer of the Elephant Armor Art.

Han Zhen nodded and bid farewell to Elder Mo. Back at his residence, Han Zhen sealed off his dwelling and plunged into his cultivation chamber. He was impatient to break through to the fourth layer of the Evergreen Art, as this would be a qualitative transformation. With the assistance of his Innate Providence [Heaven's Reward for Diligence], there would be no such thing as a bottleneck, and Han Zhen believed this breakthrough wouldn't take much time.

That very night, after reaching peak spiritual power in the third layer, Han Zhen effortlessly cultivated the fourth layer of the formulas. Upon reaching the fourth layer, Han Zhen's five senses seemed to enter a completely new world, a stark contrast to before. His vision was instantly elevated to an unimaginable degree; everything in his sight became exceptionally clear and bright. The tiny, previously invisible纹路 on the stone wall now appeared magnified, distinctly displayed before his eyes. The sound of an insect crawling in a distant corner was like a whisper right next to his ear. Not only that, but various scents also seemed to be finely separated, each subtle difference discernible. Han Zhen's control over True Qi ascended to a new level, and his mental power saw a tremendous increase.

The allure of the fifth and sixth layers was so strong that Han Zhen didn't even want to step out of his cultivation chamber.
