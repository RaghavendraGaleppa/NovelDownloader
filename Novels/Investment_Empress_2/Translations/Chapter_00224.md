Chapter 224: My Verdict Is She’s No Match for Ice Cube

"I shouldn't have given myself away."

Watching Tang Xiaobao skip away toward the courtyard, Yin Mianmian took a soft breath.

After entering the restaurant, she had encountered three people.

One was Xu Yi; no need to think twice about him.

One was Ouyang, who was so ethereal he probably saw everyone in double vision; not worth worrying about either.

The last was Tang Xiaobao, who looked simple-minded.

No problem.

She was at the ninth orifice of the Observation of the Divine Realm.

Li Mo was, at most, at the third orifice of the Observation of the Divine Realm.

As long as she got close, her chance of success would be... one hundred percent!

But she had to be careful.

There were at least three Inner Scene experts in the restaurant, especially a woman in palace attire who had the might of an Outer Scene expert!

So she needed to assassinate him, preferably killing Li Mo silently.

If she caused too much of a commotion, she might be stuck here—and this time, there was no Divine Body expert from the building coming to back her up...

She pushed the door open.

"You're back?"

Li Mo was shirtless, holding a hammer to nail a painting to the wall.

He vaguely felt that Ice Cube was a bit different today.

But... it must be a young girl's mood swings.

It wasn't the first time Ice Cube had acted strange.

It must be that time of the month...

"En."

Yin Mianmian's gaze fell on the hammer in his hand, and she narrowed her eyes slightly.

A Mystic Weapon.

A practitioner of the Observation of the Divine Realm actually possessed a Mystic Weapon.

Moreover... the bounty Li Mo had on the Drizzling Rain Building was terrifying, indicating he had a massive fortune.

Just what kind of fortuitous encounter did he have?

But Li Mo happened to see a picture frame nearby that wasn't aligned properly, so he took a couple of steps away to straighten it.

"What were you doing just now, going out?" Li Mo asked casually.

"Someone challenged me."

Yin Mianmian told the truth.

That challenger had only gone to challenge Ying Bing because he had received benefits from her.

"Be careful lately. The bounty on me from the Drizzling Rain Building hasn't been withdrawn yet."

"That Saintess of the Drizzling Rain Building might still be plotting something."

Li Mo shook his head and said.

Being plotted against never feels good.

"Oh? And what exactly would Yin Mianmian do?"

Yin Mianmian took a few steps closer.

She scanned Li Mo's body with her eyes but didn't see anything like a spatial artifact.

Where was he hiding his fortune?

Li Mo turned around and said solemnly:

"Look, first of all, she's an old woman with poor development, right?"

*Crack—*

Yin Mianmian's fist clenched.

"?" Li Mo didn't know where the sound came from and continued: "You see, people with physical defects are prone to psychological problems."

"Add to that the fact that she grew up in the Drizzling Rain Building's environment of deceit, danger, and wandering—it's even easier for her to become psychologically distorted."

"Otherwise, why would she enjoy watching men lose their minds and fight each other?"

"Huh? Ice Cube, why does your face look so bad?"

Li Mo was a bit confused.

He noticed Ice Cube's face had turned dark, as if...

She had a strong urge to attack?

Unbeknownst to him, this was just Yin Mianmian's surface appearance; inside, she was almost exploding with rage.

"How do you know about her interests?"

"So you are..."

Yin Mianmian said through gritted teeth.

The poisoned dagger had already slipped into her palm.

In an instant, she even forgot to investigate Li Mo's wealth; years of cultivated composure vanished.

But the next moment.

*Hum—*

Moonlight shimmered.

It was Little Li releasing the Divine Will from his Soul Intent.

Some girls have stronger reactions during their period, manifesting in their bodies and moods.

This moonlight had the effect of eliminating distracting thoughts and various negative emotions; it had been tested before, such as when Senior Brother Ouyang went dark last time.

Once the Divine Will shone, he would calm down.

As expected.

When the moonlight enveloped her head, her originally furious heart suddenly froze.

---

All emotions seemed to dissipate.

"You are..."

Yin Mianmian suddenly felt.

After all, Li Mo was still young, and they were enemies.

Since they were enemies, wasn't it normal for his words to be a bit excessive?

Of course, she should forgive him...

However.

She still had to make a move.

Although the anger in her heart was gone, it didn't mean the killing intent was gone.

As long as the bounty on Li Mo remained on the Drizzling Rain Building, it was a slap in the face to her as the Saintess.

But first, she could find out where his意外所得的财富 came from, and why he knew about her interests.

"So you seem to know quite a bit about Yin Mianmian?"

Yin Mianmian's expression returned to calm as she asked coldly.

"I wouldn't say that."

Li Mo put down the hammer and shook his head.

He glanced outside; Senior Brother Xiaobao still hadn't returned, so he lowered his voice:

"I only found out by chance. Actually, that Yin Mianmian is also a pitiable person despite her hatefulness."

"Oh? For example?"

"The Lord of the Drizzling Rain Building, because of her physique, used her as a cauldron. She probably doesn't even know it..."

"??!"

Yin Mianmian first sneered, then suddenly her smile froze at the corner of her mouth.

Li Mo currently thought she was Ying Bing.

So, there was no possibility of him intentionally driving a wedge.

He had no reason to lie.

And if he had just said that sentence, it could be dismissed as a casual speculation.

But her interest, which she had told no one about, was clearly seen through by Li Mo!

If... if what he said was true...

For a moment, Yin Mianmian was lost in thought.

At the same time.

A prompt sounded in Li Mo's ear.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in Yin Mianmian, causing her to suspect the Lord of the Drizzling Rain Building.】

【You have a feedback reward to claim】

What the reward was, Li Mo had no time to look at.

Because he and Ice Cube often cultivated together, they were very familiar with each other's Soul Intent.

The moment the Divine Will enveloped her, he sensed something was off but couldn't confirm it for a moment.

And just as he was about to use the Eye of Fate, the system's feedback prompt came.

Yin Mianmian?!

Li Mo's expression changed.

At the same time, Yin Mianmian's thoughts were racing; for a moment, she didn't want to kill Li Mo.

She wanted to ask clearly where Li Mo got his information from!

In an instant, the Demonic Celestial Beauty Body was pushed to its limit, and a surging Divine Will enveloped him.

Ninth orifice of the Observation of the Divine Realm, fully activating a supreme form.

Let alone the third orifice of the Observation of the Divine Realm; even an Inner Scene expert would be in danger of falling if hit by this.

This was a clash of Soul Intents!

For a time.

Soul Intents clashed.

Li Mo grunted, and in a daze, he felt himself floating among clouds, vaguely seeing slender and plump, competing in beauty celestial maidens around him, each a peerless beauty, each with a captivating dance.

The real Yin Mianmian was among them, smiling sweetly, her beautiful eyes glancing, sending signals of sinking to the depths of his mind.

Once he sank.

He would likely become a captive under her skirt forever, unable to resist.

Li Mo's Soul Intent was stronger than those of the same realm.

But relying on his Soul Intent alone, it was difficult to resist.

But... what kind of person was Little Li?

Having gone through the baptism of countless borderline beauties in his past life, he could maintain a certain level of clarity.

He looked somewhat entranced at the swaying dances of the celestial maidens.

Another scene inexplicably popped into his mind.

It was the template loaded when the system adapted the swimsuit that day.

Ice Cube's unimplemented limited skin—Cool Summer: Black Temptation.

Little Li's gaze gradually became firm:

"My verdict is..."

"She's no match for Ice Cube."

The next moment.

The clear brilliance暴涨!

A bright, full moon rose slowly, its moonlight like frost, illuminating and breaking through all things.

All the celestial maidens touched by the light, their beautiful faces turned into withered bones!
