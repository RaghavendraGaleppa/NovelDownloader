# Chapter 23: Zhou Mubai, the Sword Immortal of Guang'an

On the deck of the cargo ship.

After jointly defending against enemies and distributing the spoils, the relationship between the three had visibly warmed.

Chen Daoxuan smiled and cupped his hands in greeting. "This junior is Chen Daoxuan from the Chen family of Changping County, Shuanghu Island. This is my uncle, Chen Xianhe. May I ask for your esteemed name, senior?"

"This old man is Wei Sihai. Greetings to you both, fellow Daoists!"

The black-robed elder Wei Sihai formally bowed to them.

Chen Xianhe and Chen Daoxuan hurriedly returned the courtesy.

"Brother Wei, you're too kind!"

Chen Xianhe put on an expression of being overwhelmed by the honor.

He understood clearly that if not for Chen Daoxuan's presence, this senior probably wouldn't have given a mere sixth-level Qi Refining cultivator like him the time of day.

After exchanging pleasantries, the atmosphere between them grew even more harmonious.

Seizing the opportunity, Chen Daoxuan subtly inquired about the situation regarding renting or purchasing shops in the rogue cultivator market.

Compared to the Chen uncle-nephew pair, Wei Sihai, who had spent years mingling in rogue cultivator markets, clearly had a much better understanding of their inner workings.

Sure enough.

After hearing Chen Daoxuan's explanation, Wei Sihai frowned and shook his head. "I advise you not to set your sights on opening a shop in the rogue cultivator market."

"Why is that?"

Chen Xianhe frowned beside him.

Wei Sihai looked at Chen Daoxuan, then at Chen Xianhe, and explained, "To be frank with you both, the cultivation island I come from has some spiritual mineral resources, yet I've never opened a shop in the rogue cultivator market. Do you know why?"

Chen Daoxuan and Chen Xianhe exchanged glances before cupping their hands. "Please enlighten us, senior!"

"Enlightenment is too strong a word,"

The black-robed elder Wei Sihai waved his hand. "The rogue cultivator markets in Guang'an Prefecture are different from the core commercial districts. Most customers here are rogue cultivators and members of minor families with weak purchasing power.

"If you open a shop, the cost of goods will skyrocket. Given this, why wouldn't rogue cultivators choose to buy from stalls instead?"

As a seasoned veteran of the rogue cultivator markets, Wei Sihai's words were extremely sincere.

Had he not seen Chen Daoxuan's extraordinary potential and wanted to befriend him, he wouldn't have advised against it so earnestly.

Hearing this and combining it with his own market research of the rogue cultivator markets, Chen Daoxuan knew Wei Sihai wasn't exaggerating.

However, Wei Sihai didn't know he was an artifact refiner, let alone that he possessed the era-defining artifact known as the Spirit Melting Furnace.

After a moment of contemplation.

Chen Daoxuan decided to reveal part of the truth.

"To be honest, I happen to be an artifact refiner, which is why I want to open an artifact shop in the rogue cultivator market."

"You're an artifact refiner?"

The black-robed elder was stunned for a moment before showing a skeptical expression.

Seeing Wei Sihai's doubt, Chen Daoxuan didn't explain further. Instead, he demonstrated his Fire Control Technique in front of him.

The Fire Control Technique was one of only two spells Chen Daoxuan had mastered before coming to Guang'an Prefecture, and he had long since perfected it to the Great Completion stage.

In Chen Daoxuan's palm.

A flickering flame morphed into various shapes—from common cats and dogs to all sorts of birds and beasts.

Seeing Chen Daoxuan's mastery of the Fire Control Technique, Wei Sihai was immediately ninety percent convinced.

Because aside from artifact refiners and alchemists, no one would bother to master the Fire Control Technique so thoroughly.

After all, practicing the Fire Control Technique offered no benefit to combat strength and instead required immense effort.

Aside from artifact refiners and alchemists, no cultivator in their right mind would waste time on this spell.

"Brother, you're actually an artifact refiner! My deepest respects!"

If Wei Sihai had merely been interested in befriending Chen Daoxuan before, his attitude now carried a hint of fawning.

After all, among rogue cultivators, artifact refiners and alchemists were exceedingly rare.

Such specialized talents were typically only nurtured by major families and sects.

Moreover, these factions usually kept them under tight protection, making it nearly impossible for ordinary rogue cultivators to interact with them.

However, Wei Sihai had always been reserved by nature. Though he wanted to fawn, all that came out was a stiff "My deepest respects!"

Chen Daoxuan didn't mind. He had revealed his identity as an artifact refiner precisely so that Wei Sihai, a veteran of the rogue cultivator market, could introduce him to a reliable shop.

Sure enough.

Upon learning of Chen Daoxuan's status as an artifact refiner, Wei Sihai began detailing the shop information he was familiar with.

He even thumped his chest in assurance. "Don't worry, fellow Daoists. Once we return to the market, I'll introduce you to the shop owner. You can leave this matter to me."

"In that case, many thanks, senior!"

"You're too kind, brother."

As they spoke, new developments seemed to be unfolding on the distant battlefield.

Frontline battlefield.

After the Zhou family disciples repelled the beast tide, the unwilling merfolk personally entered the fray, launching an attack on the Zhou family.

Thanks to the astonishing eyesight of cultivators and their elevated vantage point.

Even from a hundred miles away, Chen Daoxuan and the others could clearly see the merfolk's appearances.

Just as recorded in ancient texts, the merfolk's faces were nearly indistinguishable from humans. The males were exceptionally robust, their exposed muscles gleaming with a bronze sheen under the sunlight.

The female merfolk were extraordinarily beautiful, delicate and lovely, each one a stunning beauty.

Of course.

This was only true if one didn't look below their waists.

All merfolk, regardless of gender, lacked human features from the waist down, instead sporting fish tails about ten feet long.

Seeing this, Wei Sihai couldn't help but sigh. "They say the merfolk share bloodlines with humanity's ancient ancestors. I never believed it before, but seeing their appearance now, it's not entirely unfounded."

Chen Daoxuan, however, didn't care about merfolk one way or another. His sole focus was on establishing a shop in the rogue cultivator market, with Chen Xianhe managing it.

Then he could return home to set up an artifact refining workshop, mass-producing artifacts to exploit industrialized productivity and amass wealth from the Myriad Stars Sea.

As for the war between the merfolk and the Zhou family—who cared?

Not only had the Zhou family effortlessly crushed the attacking merfolk, but even if they couldn't win, wasn't there still the prefectural city above them?

And if the prefectural city fell, there was still the Qian Yuan Sword Sect!

In this world, humanity was the absolute dominant power.

Beyond them, neither demonic beasts nor other races could contend with human cultivators.

Otherwise, with a common external enemy, the Qian Yuan Sword Sect wouldn't have been locked in a life-and-death struggle with the Chuyun Kingdom for four hundred years.

As they spoke.

From among the merfolk, an exceptionally brawny, resolute-faced middle-aged merfolk stepped forward, treading on waves.

Opposite him.

A young man in white robes stood with flawless jade-like features and an elegant demeanor.

The white-robed man stood tall and straight, a three-foot-long sword strapped to his back as he hovered in mid-air.

Even from a hundred miles away, Chen Daoxuan could sense the transcendent, almost immortal aura emanating from him.

"Who is that?"

Hearing this, Wei Sihai's expression turned complex.

"Zhou Mubai, the Sword Immortal of Guang'an!"
