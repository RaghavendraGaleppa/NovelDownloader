# Chapter 26: Frightening Demon, Desperate Flight

“Lazy people always have more needs.”

Zhao Dachun harbored resentment, feeling deeply displeased with Li Xian.

Seeing the situation, the group had no choice but to stop. The area was filled with mountain trees, making it difficult to辨认方向 (determine direction). Feng Huo was familiar with this route; no one dared to wander off before he returned.

“Stop it!”

Qiao Dashou felt someone patting his shoulder and shrugged, shouting a reprimand.

Soon, the feeling came again. He turned around impatiently, cursing, “Are you done or not? Is it that fun? Why are you patting my shoulder?”

The guard behind him was stunned and asked in confusion, “What kind of fit are you throwing?”

“Ah, you still won’t admit it? I think you’re asking for a beating.” Qiao Dashou felt inexplicably annoyed.

“Bring it on, I’m not afraid of you! It’s a good chance to warm up.”

The guard felt the same way.

Just as they were about to fight, a sudden gust of hot wind blew from above. An instinctual sense of danger made their hair stand on end.

They looked up and couldn’t help but sigh in relief.

There was a large tree right above them, its leaves all fallen, with only clumps of snow clinging to the branches. It was一览无遗 (a clear view), with nothing strange.

Distracted by this, the two lost the urge to fight.

Once the fear dissipated, anger surged in Qiao Dashou. He kicked the tree and cursed, “Damn it, why does taking a piss take so long!”

After a few kicks, the snow on the tree scattered.

“Qiao… Qiao… You…”

The atmosphere suddenly turned cold, colder than the biting wind. One of the guards’ legs went weak, and he fell into the snow with a thud.

His trembling finger pointed towards the top of the tree.

“Damn!”

“You’re trying to scare me? I’m telling you, I’m already furious. I’ll kill whoever comes, god or Buddha. You think you can scare me?! Watch me chop him to pieces!”

With that, he drew the guard’s sword and swung it a few times in the air. Suddenly, another warm breeze blew from above. In this weather, the warm wind brought no comfort, only a bone-chilling terror.

“This… this…”

Qiao Dashou broke out in a cold sweat, his heart pounding as if it were about to jump out of his chest. His body was frozen, unable to move. He could only turn his wrist, using the reflection on the blade to look at the treetop.

The blade… wasn’t wide enough.

He could only see a pair of赤红瞳孔 (crimson pupils). The eyeballs were round and huge, filled with a playful, teasing intent.

The creature was hanging upside down from the tree. Head down, it watched them just like that.

In an instant, screams and cries of terror erupted.

On the other side.

Feng Huo was willing to violate the manor’s rules to save his own life first. When the snowstorm suddenly hit, he didn’t know if that “thing” had appeared again.

“I’ll use the excuse of going to the bathroom to escape and leave everyone behind to return to the manor. If that thing doesn’t appear, I’ll say I got lost while relieving myself.”

“If something happens, I’ll have to ask you guys to buy me some time.”

After separating from the group, his footsteps gradually quickened.

But he kept hearing Li Xian calling from behind, “Master Feng, why are you running so far away to pee?”

“I’m happy to, don’t follow me!” Feng Huo quickened his pace, walking even faster.

Li Xian frowned, feeling the sense of crisis drawing closer.

He listened intently… the surroundings were quiet, with only the sounds of him and Feng Huo. That thing hadn’t followed him.

It must be with the other six people.

“New guy, you’re behind me. I can’t pee with you there. Can you move away a bit?” Feng Huo found he couldn’t shake off Li Xian and was both angry and annoyed.

“Coincidentally, I’m scared alone. I need someone with me to pee,” Li Xian said seriously.

The two walked faster and faster. They claimed they were just relieving themselves, but they had already walked over a mile.

At this moment…

A scream suddenly came from behind.

“Damn it, I’m so unlucky, I ran into that thing again!”

“Wasn’t it near the Wang Family Village? How did it get to this area?”

Feng Huo’s hair stood on end. He ignored everything and started to flee for his life with all his might.

Hearing the scream, Li Xian was also terrified. He thought to himself, “A demon? Or something else?”

He didn’t care about anything else and accelerated his mad dash after Feng Huo.

They quickly ran out of the woods, but then the second scream rang out. Feng Huo was so scared his legs went weak, and he almost fell.

“Master Feng, what exactly happened? You knew this would happen, didn’t you?”

Li Xian asked as he ran.

He didn’t hear the footsteps of that thing, so he was still safe for the time being. But… it hadn’t been long, and there were already two screams. This showed the situation was not optimistic.

“Come here, and I’ll tell you if you come here,” Feng Huo said.

Li Xian narrowed his eyes, thinking that Feng Huo, by leaving everyone behind to escape alone, clearly intended to use the group as bait.

So he became more cautious and pretended to be out of breath, saying, “Master Feng, slow down a bit… I… I can’t keep up.”

Hearing this, Feng Huo felt relieved. He no longer answered and focused all his energy on running.

Not long after, the third scream sounded. Of the eight men, three had already been killed.

Soon after, the fourth scream rang out.

Li Xian’s scalp went numb. He let loose his legs and ran desperately. At that moment, the [Running] skill came in handy.

[Running], nearly perfected, could treat the mountain path as flat ground. His footing was natural, his endurance lasting, and his breathing even.

He quickly closed the distance with Feng Huo. Li Xian gathered his strength but didn’t rush to overtake him, maintaining a certain distance.

“If I overtake him, he might not hesitate to harm me secretly. I need to wait for the best moment to overtake him in one go.”

So, when the fifth scream sounded, Feng Huo was so frightened his legs went weak, and he lost his focus. Li Xian seized the opportunity and sped past him at full speed.

“New guy, didn’t you say you couldn’t run anymore?”

“Wait for me!”

Feng Huo’s eyes widened. He was anxious but powerless. He tried to chase Li Xian quickly. In the face of life and death, his explosive speed wasn’t slow.

Li Xian also ran with his head down, channeling his inner energy to his feet, taking enormous strides.

For a time, they chased each other, neither able to pull away.

“Damn it.”

“How can you run so fast, you little brat!”

Feng Huo cursed in frustration. His speed wasn’t slow, but his endurance couldn’t compare to Li Xian’s. The distance was gradually widening.

“No… no… Ah!”

The sixth scream rang out.

This meant… of the eight guards, only Feng Huo and Li Xian remained.

Zhao Dachun, Qiao Dashou, Ye Xiaoluo, and the others were all dead.

“It’s here!”

“That thing is so fast!”

Li Xian listened intently and敏锐 heard a faint sound.

He didn’t dare to look back, as it would affect his speed. Besides, he also heard Feng Huo’s terrified breathing and curses.

“Damn it!”

“Bastard!”

“I was killed by you, it’s all because of you!”

“I won’t let you go even if I become a ghost!”

Li Xian ignored him and ran even faster. By now, the lights of the manor were visible.

“Ah!”

A scream sounded as Feng Huo was pounced upon.

The sound of flesh tearing, hearts being crushed, and blood splattering followed.

“It’ll be me next!”

Li Xian actually calmed down. He touched the long knife at his waist. If he were caught up, he would definitely strike back to get his money’s worth!

[Skill: Running]
[Proficiency: 1486/1500 (Small Success)]
[Description: Desperate flight in life and death, life is precious. Run faster, even faster, and your life will be longer, even longer. Young man… you should be grateful for your daily training, never slacking off.]
[Proficiency +2]
[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian’s [Running], which was already close to perfection, finally reached Great Completion at this moment.

The feeling of fatigue instantly vanished, and he ran like the wind.

But this was still not enough. That thing’s speed was even faster, unimaginably fast!

Running was not “Qinggong” (lightness skill); there was a limit to improvement!

Li Xian finally understood why Feng Huo said he was killed by him.

In terms of speed alone, even if the eight of them scattered and ran, they couldn’t outrun it.

However… every time it pounced on someone, it would stop for a while, perhaps to eat something while it was still hot.

Feng Huo was done for.

Next, it was Li Xian’s turn! The footsteps were closing in fast; that thing was already here.
