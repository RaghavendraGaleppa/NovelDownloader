# Chapter 11: A New Opportunity!

A mere token had already granted Gu Yuan such immense benefits. If he truly managed to secure a favorable position through connections, wouldn't he be on the verge of Foundation Building by tomorrow?  

Especially considering that this Golden Core cultivator was the most beautiful woman Gu Yuan had ever laid eyes on.  

Just recalling those pink eyes made his heart skip a beat.  

"Fortune favors the bold!"  

"With the Stone Liquid in hand, it's not impossible to try!"  

"Even if I can't rely on connections, I must find a way to see if I can become a disciple under a Golden Core master!"  

During his time in the Demon Star Cave, Gu Yuan had come to deeply understand the importance of having a powerful backer.  

His inherent decisiveness and hidden recklessness had been awakened.  

Thus, even if the odds were minuscule, Gu Yuan was determined to try.  

"But not now. A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush. The Stone Liquid can only reveal one opportunity at a time. If I use it to seek connections, I won’t be able to use it for tomorrow’s cave dwelling selection."  

"Securing a Golden Core benefactor or becoming a disciple of one—both are extremely unlikely. After all, the Stone Liquid only reveals opportunities; it doesn’t create them out of thin air."  

"To be safe, I should first check for cave dwelling opportunities. Once I have a place to settle, I can wait for the next accumulation of Stone Liquid."  

Though grand in strategy, Gu Yuan remained meticulous in tactics, unwilling to waste any opportunity.  

"Since that’s the case, I’ll first examine the cave dwellings and see if I can find a hidden gem."  

After careful consideration, Gu Yuan made up his mind.  

He flipped his palm, and a grayish-blue stone bottle suddenly appeared.  

The bottle was about a foot tall, entirely made of unadorned grayish-blue stone, devoid of any carvings or decorations. It looked utterly plain, like a crude piece crafted by a common farmer. Yet when Gu Yuan gently shook it, he could hear the liquid inside colliding, producing a sound like jade striking jade.  

"I wonder what this bottle relies on to condense the Stone Liquid. If I could figure out the pattern, perhaps I could check for opportunities daily, seeking them at will."  

As he lightly shook the bottle, Gu Yuan sighed softly.  

The stone bottle was mysterious in origin. His predecessor had stumbled upon it by chance at a cliffside, initially mistaking it for a mundane object. Only later did he discover its indestructible nature, which prompted him to keep it.  

But before he could uncover the bottle’s ability to condense the Stone Liquid, his cultivation went awry, leading to his demise—and Gu Yuan’s subsequent possession of the bottle.  

Gu Yuan hadn’t had time to explore its secrets either before being abducted to the Demon Star Cave.  

Yet, it was precisely this ordeal that allowed him to discover the bottle’s wondrous uses.  

Even so, while he understood its function, the mechanism behind the Stone Liquid’s condensation remained unclear.  

For now, Gu Yuan only knew that it condensed two drops of Stone Liquid every half-month or month, allowing him to check for one opportunity.  

"Enough. Overthinking won’t help. I’ll figure it out gradually in the future."  

Unable to find an answer, Gu Yuan stopped straining his mind. He directly retrieved the Stone Liquid and dripped it onto his eyes.  

**Boom!**  

In an instant, the stars flowed, and the sun and moon flickered. The world once again turned into gray-white lines, with everything laid bare before Gu Yuan’s vision.  

The meditation chamber beneath his feet, the bamboo forest, the island—all seemed to dissolve into clear, gray-white outlines.  

Only the Guest Welcoming Island beneath him and a white island covered in green bamboo to the side remained vividly distinct. The distant Green Peak Mountain appeared blurry, and the Nine Rivers Marsh beyond was shrouded in darkness.  

For now, the Stone Liquid’s detection range was limited to this scope.  

Moreover, the Stone Liquid only provided guidance based on Gu Yuan’s current circumstances and pressing needs—it wasn’t a wish-granting machine.  

If Gu Yuan wanted to check for opportunities regarding tomorrow’s cave dwelling selection, the Stone Liquid could help.  

Even if he wanted to seek a Golden Core benefactor, the Stone Liquid could offer some guidance.  

These matters were all connected to him, leaving traces to follow.  

But if he fantasized about becoming an immortal overnight, reaching Golden Core cultivation in a single night, or directly becoming the master of Green Peak Academy—that was pure delusion.  

Having long since discerned these rules, Gu Yuan no longer indulged in wild fantasies.  

He gazed into the distance, focusing on the Hidden Dragon Courtyard.  

There, five glowing dots flickered faintly, standing out starkly in the gray, lined world.  

Gu Yuan knew these five cave dwellings were the Qi Refining caves that would be reclaimed tomorrow after fifteen years of occupancy.  

Two of them emitted dim white light, so faint that they were almost invisible amidst the gray haze.  

"These two must be the lower-grade caves—filled with nothing but dust and devoid of any gains."  

Gu Yuan understood.  

Most Qi Refining disciples were poor.  

Even inner disciples of Green Peak Academy were no exception.  

The more diligent they were in cultivation, the poorer they tended to be.  

Even those with wealth would carry their belongings in storage pouches when leaving, never leaving valuables in their caves. Thus, few ever showed interest in reclaimed caves.  

Only the caves of disciples who had perished unexpectedly while possessing substantial wealth would attract attention.  

Gu Yuan skipped over these two caves and examined the remaining three.  

Two of them shone with bright, clear white light, eye-catching in the gray world.  

Inheriting these caves would surely bring a modest windfall.  

But Gu Yuan’s gaze swept past them, landing on the final one.  

There, amidst a green glow, was a dazzling silver radiance—brilliant and resplendent at the end of the five dots.  

"A green-turning-silver opportunity!"  

Gu Yuan was first stunned, then overjoyed.  

Among opportunity glows, white was the weakest, green slightly stronger, silver already remarkable, and gold exceedingly rare.  

When Gu Yuan had found the token, forming a karmic connection with the Golden Core cultivator, he not only survived the Demon Star Cave unscathed but also joined Green Peak Academy, a major power in the Eastern Mountain Region. That opportunity had only been silver tinged with gold.  

Yet a mere Qi Refining cave dwelling now offered a green-turning-silver opportunity—with the silver light so intense it nearly dyed the entire glow pure silver.  

This was no trivial matter of a few spirit stones.  

This cave dwelling undoubtedly held a significant secret!  

Gu Yuan’s heart pounded wildly.  

Having just joined Green Peak Academy, with only Qi Refining fourth-layer cultivation and no master to guide him, he desperately needed opportunities to advance and establish himself here.  

This cave dwelling was one he absolutely couldn’t miss!  

**Whoosh!**  

The gray-white lines dissipated as the Stone Liquid’s effects faded. The walls of the meditation chamber reappeared before Gu Yuan’s eyes.  

"But I wonder—has this cave’s opportunity already been discovered by others?"  

After the initial excitement, Gu Yuan began calculating his chances of securing the cave.  

If no one else knew, his odds were excellent—especially since Qiu Mingshan believed he still possessed the legacy of a Golden Core cultivator.  

But if the secret was already known, complications would surely arise.  

"How can I ensure I obtain this cave dwelling?"  

Gu Yuan pondered, seeking a foolproof method.  

After much deliberation, he couldn’t help but shake his head.  

"With my current cultivation, I likely can’t influence this matter directly. To secure this cave, I’ll have to borrow power—not just from Golden Core cultivators but also Foundation Building experts..."  

"I just hope no major obstacles arise..."
