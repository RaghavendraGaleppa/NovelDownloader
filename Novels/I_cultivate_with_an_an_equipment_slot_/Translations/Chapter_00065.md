# Chapter 65: The Great Sect Leader's Breakdown

After returning from the elder's place, Zhang Yan first briefed Zhuge Wan on the general situation.

"Hmm? You actually caught Elder Weng's attention?" Zhuge Wan's eyes lit up upon hearing Zhang Yan's words. "Since Elder Weng expressed interest in exchanging spiritual plant knowledge with you, you must seize this opportunity. As for the secret realm matter, don't worry too much about it. Although the secret realm has been discovered, the initial exploration won't conclude so quickly. Moreover, you don't know what's inside the secret realm yet. But for now, Elder Weng's attention is undoubtedly your opportunity."

Zhuge Wan spoke in a gentle voice: "The path must be walked step by step, and rice must be eaten bite by bite. The path of cultivation is long, and you may encounter many opportunities and temptations. But remember, no matter what temptation you face, you must act only when you're absolutely certain. Don't abandon what's in front of you for a distant hope. Always secure the opportunity before you before eyeing what's in the pot."

"Yes, Master." Zhang Yan nodded deeply in agreement. Indeed, none who reached the Golden Core stage were fools. Since his master had given advice, Zhang Yan naturally wouldn't ignore it.

After all, there was still time before the secret realm opened. Whether competing for the true disciple position or entering the secret realm, these were future opportunities—uncertain ones at that. The opportunity with Elder Weng, however, was certain. Judging from Zhuge Wan's reaction, Elder Weng's status might be even more impressive than Zhang Yan had imagined.

So the next day, Zhang Yan went to visit Elder Weng. The elder remained composed, tending to his spiritual fields while explaining various aspects of spiritual plant cultivation to Zhang Yan.

At first, Elder Weng was quite casual. Given his status and knowledge, teaching a junior like Zhang Yan about spiritual plants should have been simple. But soon, he grew uneasy because Zhang Yan's knowledge was unexpectedly vast—far surpassing what he himself had known at that age.

Moreover, many of Zhang Yan's insights into spiritual plants aligned perfectly with his own, without the slightest deviation. It was uncanny!

Elder Weng stared intently at Zhang Yan, his centuries-old Dao heart unsettled. He even wondered if Zhang Yan was his secret descendant—how else could their understanding of spiritual plants be so identical? But then he remembered: he had maintained his purity for three hundred years! How could he possibly have a descendant like Zhang Yan?

"Is something wrong, Elder Weng? Did I make a mistake?" Zhang Yan widened his eyes in confusion.

"No, nothing. You're doing well," Elder Weng replied, quickly regaining his composure. He was determined to see just how much knowledge Zhang Yan possessed and how closely it matched his own.

As their discussions continued, Elder Weng grew increasingly astonished. This young man was a true prodigy in the art of spiritual plants. No matter what concept he explained, Zhang Yan grasped it instantly. Teaching him was effortless and immensely satisfying.

"No wonder my own master enjoyed teaching me so much—I must have been this talented too!" The thought flashed through Elder Weng's mind. But when he noticed Zhang Yan's sect robes, a pang of regret struck him. Such an exceptional seedling, yet he belonged to another sect.

If only Zhang Yan were a disciple of his own sect, Elder Weng would have gladly passed on his legacy. But alas, he couldn't. Many of his techniques were based on the secret art of "Flower Grafting," a closely guarded technique of the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace. Even he couldn't casually teach it to an outsider.

For a fleeting moment, Elder Weng considered persuading Zhang Yan to switch sects. But he quickly dismissed the idea. From their interactions, it was clear Zhang Yan held deep loyalty to the Verdant Scale Sect. Moreover, poaching disciples was beneath him.

Out of admiration for Zhang Yan's talent, Elder Weng taught him everything he could—both permissible and impermissible knowledge. He held nothing back except the secret techniques. Without them, Zhang Yan could only broaden his understanding but not apply the methods.

Little did Elder Weng know, Zhang Yan had already mastered—and perfected—the Ten Thousand Blossoms Palace's secret technique. Thus, everything Elder Weng taught, Zhang Yan truly understood and could use—just not openly.

But as the saying goes, any path that works is a good path. In just over ten days, Zhang Yan absorbed nearly everything Elder Weng had to offer and bid the elder farewell.

Upon returning to Zhuge Wan, Zhang Yan found that the other competition participants had already left, even Mu Sen and his group. They had departed as quietly as they had arrived. Only Zhuge Wan remained, waiting for him.

"Since matters are settled, let's depart," Zhuge Wan said.

"Understood."

With a wave of her sleeve, a ribbon transformed into a radiant rainbow, carrying the disciples away. The journey passed without incident, and they soon returned to the sect.

Zhuge Wan first dropped them off at Wood Spirit Peak before heading alone to Verdant Scale Peak, presumably to meet the sect leader.

"Home truly is best!" Zhang Yan sighed as he returned to his cave abode. Liu Yiting promptly prepared tea for him. Sipping the tea while enjoying her massage was pure bliss. Only within the Verdant Scale Sect, on Wood Spirit Peak, did Zhang Yan feel truly safe. The reason? The immense sense of security provided by the "Landlord" system.

While he rested, Zhuge Wan arrived at Verdant Scale Peak and sought out Sect Leader Mo Changqing.

"Junior Sister, what brings you here?" Mo Changqing was both surprised and delighted to see her.

"Why, can't I visit?" Zhuge Wan replied coolly.

"Of course you can!" Mo Changqing quickly prepared tea for her.

"I came to discuss Zhang Yan," Zhuge Wan said after taking a sip.

"Zhang Yan? What about him?" Mo Changqing naturally remembered Zhang Yan—after all, he had gifted the young man a second-grade spiritual tea plant.

"Zhang Yan won first place in the spiritual plant competition. I'm having him collect three spiritual plants from your garden as his reward."

"Pfft—" Mo Changqing nearly spat out his tea. "Your disciple won, so why should my spiritual plants be the reward?!"
