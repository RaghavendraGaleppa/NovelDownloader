# Chapter 55: "The Cultivation Codex" — "The Bandit Cultivator's Manual"

"A steel trident forged from Great River Iron—oh? This is actually a top-grade magical artifact capable of controlling river water, both offensive and defensive in nature."

"Fireflame Fruit, a mid-grade spirit fruit that can enhance spiritual power, though it only works on demonic beasts."

"Water Spirit Flowers, mid-grade spirit flowers that enhance eyesight. Long-term consumption has a chance to awaken eye-based supernatural abilities. Hmm... eighteen of them?"

"That damn water ape—did he spend all my money on these Water Spirit Flowers?"

Gu Yuan shook the nearly empty storage pouch, finding nothing but a few worthless stones and a black jar filled with bones. This left him thoroughly frustrated.

He had thought the water ape, being an experienced bandit cultivator who had sold Fire Eye Pills, would have considerable wealth. Yet, to his surprise, the creature had spent everything on Water Spirit Flowers to awaken the Fire Eye Technique, not even bothering to equip himself with a few more artifacts. 

While the Water Spirit Flowers could be resold, the process would inevitably involve haggling and unnecessary hassle. Still, what was done was done. Gu Yuan first performed a simple refinement on the steel trident for emergencies, then turned his attention to the storage pouch of the beast-taming youth.

The first thing to fall out wasn't a magical artifact but a black stone book.

The stone book was icy to the touch, shrouded in a faint black mist that exuded an eerie aura. Though its appearance and material were peculiar, the book itself emitted no spiritual energy fluctuations.

On its cover were four bold, sharply inscribed characters:

**"The Cultivation Codex!"**

The title piqued Gu Yuan's interest, and he couldn't resist flipping it open.

"*Murder and arson bring riches, while building bridges and mending roads leave no corpses behind!*"

"*Since ancient times, those who follow the orthodox path of cultivation—disciplined and diligent—rarely achieve greatness.*"

"*All who accomplish great deeds do so through boundless slaughter, rising atop mountains of corpses and seas of blood, stepping over the bones of countless cultivators.*"

"*In the shadows, ambush fellow cultivators. In the light, defeat prodigies in open combat. Mastering both darkness and light is the true path to supremacy.*"

"*Alas, my own methods have always been underhanded, despicable, and ruthless—far too crude to stand in the halls of elegance.*"

"*Yet, in my centuries of roaming the world, I have ambushed and counter-ambushed hundreds of cultivators without a single failure. In the art of banditry, I consider myself somewhat accomplished. Thus, I pen this manual for idle amusement.*"

"*The path of a bandit cultivator hinges on four words: strike the weak with overwhelming strength!*"

"*Second to this is stealth—move unseen, strike unpredictably. Leave your enemies guessing, then manipulate others to act as your blades...*"

The stone book went on to elaborate extensively on "bandit cultivation techniques," "methods of ambush," and all manner of "tricks of the trade."

A quick skim revealed tens of thousands of words, with countless minor techniques and methods described in detail. Even the combined use of "Tracker Insects" and "Shiva Incense" was recorded within.

There was also an unusual "Scent-Shifting Technique" that allowed one to subtly alter another's aura, sowing discord among enemies to reap the benefits of their infighting. Many of these tricks weren't spells but rather combinations of peculiar demonic beasts, exotic smokes, and mysterious powders.

Gu Yuan read intently, finally understanding the methods the youth had used against him.

At the end of the stone book was a final warning:

"*Remember this well: the bandit's path is to prey on the weak. If the situation turns against you, flee immediately—never let greed cloud your judgment.*"

"*Banditry is a lifelong career. Persistence is key—dripping water wears through stone. Never entertain the foolish notion of 'ending it all in one strike' by rashly ambushing unfamiliar targets. Otherwise, your life will be forfeit!*"

The author seemed to speak from bitter experience, delivering this caution with grave emphasis.

"A lifelong career..." Gu Yuan chuckled softly and closed the book.

Though the author's cultivation level was unknown, his insights were razor-sharp and his experience vast. After reading this, Gu Yuan felt he could become a bandit cultivator himself—and a highly skilled one at that.

The final warning was particularly profound. Banditry was about slow, steady accumulation—every scrap counted. Wealth was built grain by grain, prioritizing stability over recklessness.

The youth who had ambushed him had been too eager to capture a rare beast, targeting someone he knew nothing about. The result of such "weak against strong" folly was inevitable.

"Obtaining this book makes up for everything. From now on, I won’t be so easily ambushed by bandit cultivators..." Gu Yuan felt a surge of satisfaction.

The knowledge in the stone book was distilled from rivers of blood and mountains of corpses—priceless wisdom. Mastering even a fraction of these techniques would greatly enhance his ability to protect himself.

"In that case, these Water Spirit Flowers might actually be useful."

Gu Yuan gazed thoughtfully at the shimmering, lotus-like flowers at his feet.

The "Cultivation Codex" recorded a method called the "Heavenly Insight Eyes," a technique for cleansing and enhancing vision.

This method required grinding three types of mid-grade spirit flowers into a liquid, mixing it with spiritual water, and washing the eyes for forty-nine days. The result would be a pair of extraordinary spirit eyes.

The Heavenly Insight Eyes could see through most illusions and stealth techniques, perceive the trails of "mysterious incenses and smokes," and even detect the flow of wind itself.

Wherever a goose passed, it left traces—these eyes could uncover countless details, making them ideal for both scouting and counter-scouting.

Unlike seals or spells, this was an innate supernatural ability surpassing ordinary magic. The author of the codex had relied on these eyes to evade many ambushes.

As it happened, Water Spirit Flowers were one of the three required spirit flowers for this technique. The other two were "Crimsun Yang Stamens" and "Frost Treasure Lotus."

After storing the stone book and the flowers, Gu Yuan turned his attention to the remaining loot from the storage pouch.

The first things to catch his eye were three gleaming magical artifacts:

- **Mountain Seal**, a top-grade defensive artifact capable of summoning mountain radiance to withstand attacks from eighth-level Qi Refinement cultivators.
- **Azure Lotus Shield**, a high-grade defensive artifact that conjured a lotus barrier to block seventh-level Qi Refinement attacks.
- **Yellow Sand Veil**, a high-grade offensive artifact that unleashed a storm of lethal sand to grind enemies to dust.

For a sixth-level Qi Refinement cultivator, owning one top-grade and two high-grade artifacts was a sign of considerable wealth. Clearly, the "Bandit Cultivator's Manual" had served its previous owner well.

Unfortunately for him, he had crossed paths with Gu Yuan. No matter how skilled a bandit cultivator one was, it couldn't compare to the advantages of having powerful backers. The three artifacts had been rendered useless before they could even be deployed.

Next was a crimson jade vial.

Even through the container, a pulsating red glow was visible.

"Could this be... Fire Eye Pills?"

Gu Yuan uncorked the vial and was delighted to find two radiant pills, crimson with golden flecks, shimmering within.

After all the twists and turns, these had ultimately fallen into his hands.

"With these, if I ever encounter a Sapphire Fire-Eyed Ape again, I'll have the upper hand!"

For now, the pills had little immediate use, but they were a valuable safeguard for the future.

His mood improved considerably.

Beyond these, the youth's possessions were unremarkable—just a "Beast Taming Scripture," a few shriveled spirit beast pouches, and a hundred or so spirit stones.

Had the spirit beasts survived, Gu Yuan could have used the scripture to refine a "Beast Taming Seal" and gain a few more allies. But with the youth's death, the creatures had perished as well, including the Tracker Insects—only their corpses remained.

Beast taming was an entirely separate path of cultivation, and Gu Yuan currently had no intention of diverting his focus. He decided to keep the scripture for potential future use.

Finally, he retrieved a small sapling—about an inch tall, with thick branches, broad leaves, and strange veined patterns.

**The Minor Titanwood.**

This was his true objective for this journey.

By planting this tree, his cultivation speed would more than double.

However, surveying the thin spiritual energy within the cave, Gu Yuan frowned.

After a moment's thought, he took out a jade box, placed some spirit stones and Fireflame Fruit inside, then mounted his flying shuttle and headed toward Greenpeak Mountain.
