# Chapter 151: Slaying the Golden Core

"What is this?" Yun Xingyi gasped weakly, his breath unsteady.

A gaping hole had appeared in his chest where the third-grade sword foundation from the clone had pierced him earlier. The electromagnetic cannon's high-grade magical artifact bullet, carrying the third-grade sword foundation, had shattered his heart and lodged itself in his back. This injury became the final straw that crushed Yun Xingyi's life, as the breath of life rapidly dissipated from his body.

His eyes were filled with unwillingness and incomprehensible astonishment.

"High-grade magical artifact—electromagnetic cannon!" Li Shiming replied, his mind commanding the three-headed, six-armed copper corpse to shield him. He didn't mind stalling for time. He could sense how dire Yun Xingyi's condition was—perhaps death would come in the next second.

To deal with Yun Xingyi, Li Shiming had exhausted nearly all his means. At this point, he couldn't muster another attack capable of breaching Yun Xingyi's defenses. The electromagnetic cannon required too long to recharge, and even if it did, it wouldn't reach its previous power in such a short time. The last attack had drained all the accumulated energy from the *Thunderquake Formation* over several days.

"What kind of monster have I provoked..." Yun Xingyi murmured weakly, uttering his final words before his life abruptly ended.

Li Shiming manipulated the main soul of the *Soul Control and Division Technique* to emerge. He wasn't sure if Yun Xingyi was truly dead, but the main soul could devour souls. If Yun Xingyi had indeed perished, the main soul would confirm it by consuming his soul.

The main soul pounced on Yun Xingyi's body, absorbing a faint shadow into itself before collapsing in a daze. Startled, Li Shiming quickly checked the main soul's condition and found it was merely overfed—nothing serious, just needing time to digest. He stored the main soul away again, feeling a wave of exhaustion wash over him.

That had been a close brush with death. This wasn't his first encounter with a Golden Core cultivator, but the previous time with Elder Baili, he hadn't known the elder would appear, and he had been far from the scene. This time, however, he had faced a powerful Golden Core sword cultivator capable of battling seven Golden Core experts.

"I survived!" Li Shiming laughed heartily in relief.

He turned his gaze to Yun Xingyi's corpse, scanning it with his spiritual sense. Even in death, the body of a Golden Core sword cultivator was terrifying. His spiritual sense prickled with pain as it swept over the corpse. He noticed a ring on Yun Xingyi's finger—the only item left on his body. The rest of his clothing and shoes had been set aside.

He took the ring and probed it with his spiritual sense, discovering a vast space inside—a storage artifact far superior to Baili Jinyan's storage bracelet, measuring a hundred meters in length, width, and height.

Inside, he found a pile of spirit stones—all mid-grade, totaling over thirteen thousand, with only about two thousand low-grade stones. Beside them, three golden jade slips and one purple jade slip floated in the air, catching his attention.

The first golden jade slip contained the *Ten Directions Sword Art*, a sword cultivation technique spanning from Foundation Establishment to Nascent Soul stage without any omissions. The sheer scope of this technique left Li Shiming awestruck. Unlike the *Sword Control Art* in the sect, which was merely a sword manipulation method, the *Ten Directions Sword Art* was a complete cultivation system, with sword techniques being just a minor part of its combat applications.

The second golden jade slip held the *Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art*, another complete cultivation technique from Foundation Establishment to Nascent Soul, specializing in the rare thunder spiritual power. Due to his current level, Li Shiming could only comprehend the basics, but his IBMz15 diligently recorded everything for future study.

The third, *Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Technique*, was a mental cultivation method for refining spiritual sense—a more advanced form of spiritual awareness. This was far beyond his current capabilities, reserved for Golden Core cultivators.

The purple jade slip contained a map of unfamiliar lands—mountains and seas with names he had never heard of. It charted a sea route leading to the Seven Stars Island, revealing that Yun Xingyi had come from a distant land called the Ten Thousand Mountains.

The rest of the ring's contents were sparse—mostly spirit food and other items whose value he couldn't discern. Sword cultivators, he later learned, rarely amassed wealth, dedicating all resources to strengthening their lifebound flying swords.

He collected Yun Xingyi's discarded clothing and shoes—all spirit artifacts of unknown grade, to be examined once he reached Foundation Establishment.

Emerging from the sea, Li Shiming stored Yun Xingyi's corpse, preserving it with freezing arrays. The body would make an exceptional material for refining a corpse puppet, though he dared not attempt it now, given his low cultivation.

He decided against reporting the incident. Explaining how he killed a Golden Core cultivator would raise too many questions, especially regarding the ring's contents, the lifebound flying sword, and the Golden Core now in his possession.

As his wooden flying boat carried him back toward the sect, he monitored his clone's condition. Severely injured, the clone had been stabilized in its corpse puppet form, its broken bones less of an issue for an undead entity. Once back in his cave, the *Netherworld Ghost Domain Formation* would accelerate its recovery.

His attention then turned to the lifebound flying sword. Even dormant, its sharpness was palpable, far surpassing the third-grade sword foundation. Though he couldn't wield it now, it was a treasure for the future.

The Golden Core beside it, however, was a different matter. Cracked and dim, it leaked terrifying energy. Li Shiming isolated it, wary of its unstable power.

Upon entering the sect's protective formation, he sent an emergency signal. Elder Yin, who had returned earlier with his daughter, responded swiftly. Though harboring some resentment toward Li Shiming for his closeness to Yin Shiran, the elder acknowledged his talent and importance to the sect.

"Uncle Yin," Li Shiming said, feigning distress, "Elder Zhuge was killed! A sword light from the sea tore him apart before my eyes. I passed out and woke up in the water, then fled back here."

Elder Yin, though unmoved by the death of a fellow elder, took the matter seriously. After confirming the attack site, he searched the seabed, finding only an empty cave dwelling—Yun Xingyi's former hideout. The traces of blood indicated severe injuries, but the Golden Core sword cultivator was gone.

Unbeknownst to Elder Yin, the blood was from Yun Xingyi's final moments—slain by Li Shiming himself.
