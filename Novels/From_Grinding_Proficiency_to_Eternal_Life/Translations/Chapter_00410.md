# Chapter 410: Unwelcome Guests

Cultivation through the Dao is arduous; every step forward requires bitter and exceptional training.

To be able to significantly increase one's cultivation through dual cultivation techniques is precisely why the Disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak are considered a major faction among the several branches of the Primordial Origin Sect.

They will stop at nothing to acquire those with special constitutions to serve as Cauldrons.

A single night's effort could replace half a month of bitter training.

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look at Hua Ling, who was lying prostrate on the ground, then slowly stood up and walked over to her, a faint smile appearing on his face.

Although her figure was overly petite, her training in the *Great Hundred Desires Swallowing Yuan Method* had granted her body an astonishing endurance and a decent cultivation level, allowing him to enjoy a truly satisfying session last night.

"Junior Sister Hua, why don't we rest for a few more days?"

Hua Ling was naturally unwilling to admit defeat. As a disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect, she possessed a fierce tenacity that had allowed her to survive and steadily advance her cultivation.

Most importantly, she was currently in a virtuous cycle of "borrowing to pay back," seeing a bright future ahead with everything going smoothly.

Now that she had encountered Xu Yunfan, she naturally wanted to test his limits.

With this in mind, Hua Ling forced a smile.

"Alright, alright, Senior Brother Xu, let's rest for a few more days..."

That night, nothing was said.

The next morning, Hua Ling's cheeks looked noticeably thinner; her formerly round face was gone, and her expression was somewhat listless.

Xu Yunfan asked with concern, "How are you, Junior Sister Hua?"

Hua Ling gritted her teeth. "We continue tonight!"

That night, Hua Ling finally broke down and was utterly defeated.

Watching Hua Ling, who had fainted, Xu Yunfan's eyes were cold. He casually tossed her into a corner like a rag doll.

This woman had been trying every way to drain him dry. Her brazen behavior clearly indicated she had probed and found he had no backing.

A "proficiency growth machine" had delivered itself to his door; he naturally wouldn't be polite.

After draining the last trace of her Yin essence, Xu Yunfan naturally had no further interest.

Xu Yunfan coldly swept his gaze over Hua Ling, whose body was still trembling slightly.

She had the nature of a gambler. If he had stopped the first time, he wouldn't have had a good way to deal with her.

Before the morning mist had dissipated, the three had packed their belongings and prepared to set out.

Hua Ling followed at the back with unsteady steps. Her originally glossy cheeks were sunken, and two dark circles hung under her eyes.

Her plain white ruqun hung loosely on her body. The silver bells at her waist made a faint sound with her stumbling steps; the clappers had long been distorted by her True Martial True Qi, unable to emit the soul-stirring clear tones anymore.

Li Ergou walked at the front with his neck缩着 (hunched), feeling Xu Yunfan's tangible gaze on his back.

He was regretting it to the core. If he had known that one was a venomous snake from the Hundred Desires Peak and the other a fierce tiger pretending to be a pig, he should have found an excuse to stay in the sect to clean the latrines rather than coming out.

Now he didn't even dare to breathe loudly, afraid of being swept into a new round of "Dao discussion."

Last night, Xu Yunfan suddenly said, "Junior Brother Li, you look quite handsome and delicate. Why don't you go to the Thousand Faces Pavilion on the Hundred Desires Peak to deal with those freckles?"

This statement nearly scared Li Ergou's soul out of his body, afraid that Xu Yunfan would grab him and press him down.

After all, the affairs of enjoying both men and women were common and even customary on the Hundred Desires Peak.

"Junior Brother Li," Xu Yunfan suddenly spoke, startling him so much he nearly jumped. "According to the map, we should go north at the fork ahead. You've veered off a bit."

"Yes, yes!"

Li Ergou nodded like a garlic pounder, almost choking on his own saliva.

Out of the corner of his eye, he saw Hua Ling leaning against a tree trunk, dry heaving. Her slender waist seemed as if it might snap, and her skirt was stained with moss from last night.

"..."

Seven days later, the Northern Polar Region.

On the cliffs formed by ten-thousand-year-old glacial ice, the figures of the three were faintly visible amidst the blizzard.

Hua Ling knelt in an ice cave, her ten fingers purple from the cold, mechanically picking Snow Lotuses. A jade box lay before her; every time she filled ten stalks, she would form a seal to store them.

"Ninety-seven, ninety-eight..."

Her counting voice carried a sobbing tone, and her lips were cracked with tiny bloodstains.

This Xu Yunfan was inhuman, showing no chivalry or care for a beauty. He had thrown all the picking work onto her and Li Ergou.

If she hadn't been unable to defeat him, and if she didn't get a terrifying premonition whenever she harbored a bit of malice, she would have fought him to the death.

As a disciple of a Demonic Sect, daring to fight and kill is naturally one of the essential conditions!

Xu Yunfan stood at the edge of the ice cliff, the ice crystals crushed under his boots crumbling and falling into the abyss.

He appeared to be on guard, but in reality, he was using his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye to observe the surging dark black currents beneath the ice layer.

This was precisely the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra*'s记载 (recorded) Northern Polar Glacial Abyss Primordial Qi.

If he could draw this qi into his body and cultivate the Northern Polar Subduing Devil Qi, it would naturally fulfill one of the conditions for Foundation Establishment.

In this world, achieving Foundation Establishment is very difficult.

In some Dao paths, the number of people who can achieve Foundation Establishment is limited to just a few. If later disciples wish to cultivate further, they will have no hope in this life unless the previous Foundation Establishment Master dies.

Not to mention that Foundation Establishment Masters can reincarnate five times; they can disperse their Foundation Establishment. Once they awaken their past wisdom, they can reassemble their Dao Foundation in an extremely short time.

However, these things aren't something to worry about. The paths cultivated by the Primordial Origin Sect are all grand and vast, capable of accommodating many Foundation Establishment Masters, but those who can meet the conditions for Foundation Establishment are as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.

He looked up at the sky, utilizing the night when the Big Dipper stars were aligned to make a move.

According to his calculations, there should be a time in three months when the seven stars of the Big Dipper system will shift.

"Senior Brother..."

Hua Ling walked over, holding the jade box. The unhealed bruises on her wrists were particularly glaring against the snow light. "One hundred stalks are complete."

Her gaze shifted like that of a startled bird. When she picked the last stalk, she had deliberately scraped her fingertip; the blood bead had barely seeped out before it froze into ice shards.

Now she only hoped to hand over the task and leave quickly. Once back in the sect, she would definitely take ten or eight human-level tasks to hide away for three to five years.

Xu Yunfan was about to speak when his brow slightly twitched. He turned to look in a certain direction; his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye had suddenly captured four auras.

In the distance, the snow curtain was torn apart by sword qi. A youth in purple robes and luxurious attire flew over on a jade Ruyi. Three black-robed cultivators spread out behind him in a triangular formation, the "Xuan" character tokens hanging at their waists glowing with a blood light.

It was the youth in luxurious attire who had bullied Li Ergou before.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered, as if casually glancing at Li Ergou, who was standing at the side with his head hunched.

It was highly probable that he had come chasing after him.

There must be a great secret on him!

After the three black-robed cultivators stood firm, blocking Xu Yunfan's escape routes, the youth in luxurious attire slowly descended.

"Oh, isn't this Junior Sister Hua?"

The youth in purple robes playfully lifted Hua Ling's chin. "I heard you took the Heavenly Heart Snow Lotus mission, so this Young Master specifically came to deliver some warmth."

Hua Ling's body went rigid. This was Zhao Ti, the direct grandson of the Foundation Establishment Elder of the Xuanming Peak. Relying on the three peak-stage Qi Condensation "Xuanming Guards" raised by his family, he specialized in robbing fellow disciples of their mission achievements.

She had lost face to him in the Hundred Affairs Hall previously; it would be difficult to resolve this peacefully.

Last year, a disciple had his Foundation Establishment item snatched by him. When he complained to the Punishment Hall, his cultivation was废去 (废去) instead.

"Senior Brother Zhao is joking," she forced a smile, her fingers in her sleeves digging into her palms. "We will leave right away..."

(I returned late today, sorry about that. I'll work hard tomorrow!)
