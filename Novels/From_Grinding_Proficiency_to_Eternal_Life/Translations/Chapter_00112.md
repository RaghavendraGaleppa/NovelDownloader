# Chapter 112: Wild Evil Gods

Mo Shisan was knocked into the mud by a sword sheath before he could finish speaking. Qi Huan coldly shook out the criminal case files. "The Mechanism Hall reported seventeen Qianji Gears stolen, which perfectly matches the debris found at the scene."

"姓齐的，你少给我机关堂扣帽子，当初这件千机盘，可是经外事堂手……"

Speaking up to this point, Mo Shisan suddenly fell silent. His gaze circled the damaged Qianji Plate in the hands of the Cangfeng Pavilion night patrol disciple, and an expression of hesitation appeared in his eyes.

Without another word, he turned and left.

Qi Huan also felt a headache coming on. This matter involved too many parties. With their status, pursuing the investigation further was simply impossible.

"It seems the Heavenly Work Cave is too big. There are bad people within the organization."

Xu Yunfan's voice rang out leisurely. Qi Huan abruptly looked up at Xu Yunfan. He had the intention to bring him back for questioning. Once inside the Criminal Law Hall, he naturally had ways to pry open Xu Yunfan's mouth and get to the bottom of things.

However, the other party made it clear that if Qi Huan made a move, he would have no more scruples.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand, once swung to its limit, mixed thunder and fire, its power extremely astonishing. The destruction caused on the scene right now also made Qi Huan's heart skip a beat.

Not to mention, if he actually took Xu Yunfan away, how would the Casting Hall react? At that time, Zhan Yan would probably personally come with a heavy hammer to snatch the person. Once a disturbance occurred, it would no longer be a matter between him and Xu Yunfan, but rather a complete falling out and all-out war between the Cangfeng Pavilion and the Casting Hall.

He could not bear such a crime.

Qi Huan's eyes narrowed slightly. "Junior Brother Xu, you are also considered a suspect at this moment. At this time, don't wander around. It wouldn't be good if you were caught by someone."

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan let out a light laugh.

"A clumsy provocation."

With that, he shouldered the heavy hammer and turned to leave slowly.

Qi Huan's forehead throbbed with blue veins. He took a deep breath and barely managed to calm down. He turned his head to look at the fine steel sword case that had been cracked by Xu Yunfan's grip.

His fingers holding the long sword tapped lightly on the blade, producing a crisp sound like jade beads falling on a jade plate.

However, just as he was about to leave, he saw Xu Yunfan, hammer on shoulder, rushing back with his head lowered. He picked up the life-sized Ming Zun stone statue from the ruins, half of which was shattered.

By the time Qi Huan reacted, Xu Yunfan had already strode off and disappeared around the street corner in the blink of an eye.

"Xu Yunfan!!"

Qi Huan could no longer maintain his composure and roared out loud.

*A ominous aura is lingering around you.*

When Xu Yunfan stepped into the courtyard, his knuckles tightened slightly. The moment the life-sized Ming Zun statue crashed to the ground, the bronze base collided with the blue bricks, producing a dull, echoing sound.

He immediately sat cross-legged in the Five Hearts to Heaven posture, formed the Seal of the Lin Character with his hands, and silently recited the "Highest Good is Like Water" Heart Mantra. In no time, his distracting thoughts were purified, his emotions sank completely, and his Sea of Consciousness manifested his own spirit, which walked out from the mist, suppressing, purifying, and capturing the surging gray fog.

*An ominous aura is surging towards you. The Lin Character Mantra combined with the Rong Interval has transformed it into a spiritual supplement greatly beneficial to you.*

*...*

The continuously jumping proficiency increase prompts on his vision almost flooded the screen in an instant.

The moment those gray mists, carrying the stench of decayed soil, touched the hand seal, they seemed like ice falling into a furnace, turning into a warm stream that soaked into his brain.

Xu Yunfan could clearly perceive that every strand of transformed spiritual power was flowing through his Sea of Consciousness like a silver needle embroidering.

*The ominous aura has dissipated.*

With the final prompt appearing on his vision, Xu Yunfan finally opened his eyes, revealing a look of joy.

He saw that the Ming Zun statue, which originally had half its head shaved off, was now shattered into pieces, its spiritual energy long since dispersed.

In just this short moment, his proficiency had increased by twenty points, almost comparable to three months of hard work.

When the bronze statue's base shattered the blue bricks with a crash, Xu Yunfan smelled the scent of rust mixed with aged pine resin, which was completely different from the coarse clay evil statues he had destroyed in Wuzhou before.

When those so-called Ming Zun statues shattered, they burst out black smoke with a sulfur smell, far inferior to the chilling sensation climbing up his spine right now.

These beings, which the Heavenly Pivot Gate口中的所谓野邪神, spoke of with utter disdain, seemed to look down upon them quite a bit. But if they were really so pathetic, how could they have established such a large incense religion, openly stirring up war throughout Wuzhou, turning an entire great state into a barren land.

"Junior Brother Xu, are you alright?"

Fu Jin's voice came from afar. Xu Yunfan's expression shifted, and he turned his head to see Fu Jin vaulting over the wall.

Fu Jin wore a black robe with his chest exposed, the fabric flapping loudly in the wind. When he landed, he accidentally shattered three wall bricks due to using too much force, and he was also holding a pair of eight-rhombus twin barbells in his hands.

Xu Yunfan's eyes moved slightly.

He saw that Fu Jin's temples were still stained with fresh blood foam, and the surging blood energy on his body had not yet dissipated, radiating a heat like that of a furnace.

When Fu Jin saw the shattered Ming Zun statue under Xu Yunfan's hammer, he shuddered violently. He stepped forward and kicked the stone statue into dust.

"What's wrong, Senior Brother?"

Xu Yunfan looked at Fu Jin's expression of being faced with a great enemy with full surprise.

"Why would you bring this thing back?"

After confirming there was nothing abnormal, Fu Jin let out a sigh of relief and turned to question him.

When he learned that Xu Yunfan had destroyed over twenty similar Ming Zun statues in Wuzhou, Fu Jin's twitching eyebrows finally relaxed.

"Junior Brother, this thing is extremely strange. Avoid touching it if you can. Although the talk of gods and ghosts is just a trick to us martial artists, we should still keep a respectful distance."

"Senior Brother, the statues I destroyed in Qingzhou before were very different from the stone statues I got from the Incense Fire Cult this time. They had a chilling aura, so I wanted to study them."

"Huh?!"

Fu Jin's eyes suddenly widened. He hastily threw the twin barbells in his hands aside and felt Xu Yunfan's body up and down.

"Are you alright?"

"I'm naturally fine, perfectly fine."

Only then did Fu Jin relax. He repeatedly warned him not to get close to these evil statues on his own. If he discovered anything, it was best to stir his blood energy and destroy them with a hammer.

Xu Yunfan agreed and asked further, "Back when I was in Qingzhou, I saw a statue of the Eight-Armed Three-Headed Power-Awakened Bodhisattva at the Thousand Buddha Temple. It was similar to this; the statue cracked on its own, and a large amount of black gas poured out, turning an old monk into something like a demon. It was called a Wild Evil God at the time. What is that all about?"

Fu Jin frowned, thought for a moment, and said, "These Wild Evil Gods are a great hidden danger in the world. The Heavenly Work Cave has corresponding ancient records. It is said that those extremely powerful beings, unwilling to die just like that, tried every possible method to borrow a body to be reborn and live on incense offerings. The devout spirit of the followers is precisely their best nourishment."

Speaking of this, Fu Jin sneered.

"These Wild Evil Gods are all waiting for the world's secret powers to reappear and the primordial spirits to rise again, so they can restore their former glory. To achieve their goals, they stop at nothing, inciting followers and creating chaos. All of these actions cause the people to be displaced and bones to litter the wilds."
