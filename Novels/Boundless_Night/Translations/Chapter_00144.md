**Chapter 144: Great Chaos**

Under the cover of night, on the Godfall Plains, Qin Ming was in full flight.

The Old Donkey commanded the various monstrous beasts—wolf monsters, sheep demons, rat fiends, and others—to pursue and intercept, all deployed for action. It even sent a dog demon to deliver a message.

It chased after Qin Ming itself, tearing off its tattered squire's gown, no longer walking upright. Instead, it moved on all fours, its dark donkey face stern, galloping wildly.

The Old Donkey was practically unscathed, maintaining formidable combat power. Its only injury was its hooves being trimmed when it used its hoof smash technique. At this stage, among the four old demons, it was the only one that posed a fatal threat to Qin Ming.

Qin Ming sprinted through the forest, covered in blood, with multiple broken bones. This was the most severe injury he had sustained since embarking on the Path of Rebirth.

Normally, the Old Donkey should have caught him by now. However, the more it ran, the more uncomfortable it became. Qin Ming's mutton-fat jade iron blade had unevenly shaved its four hooves, leaving them ragged. This caused it to run unsteadily. One of its front hooves was almost entirely shaved down, while the hoof on its right hind leg was perfectly intact, having never been cut. This made it stumble and nearly sprain its ankle multiple times.

Its donkey face was stretched long, so dark it looked like it would drip water!

Even so, it was closing in, approaching the tattered, blood-soaked figure ahead. It immediately accelerated its chase.

Suddenly, Qin Ming turned, raising his blade and charging back towards it. The Old Donkey froze for an instant, abruptly stopping. Especially when it saw the human youth again activating his small, jade-white dagger, its donkey hair stood on end! It had witnessed the tragic fates of the Black Roc and the Fire-Scaled Lion with its own eyes, and the memory still sent shivers down its spine.

Qin Ming feigned a move, raising his hand as if to throw the dagger! The Old Donkey was terrified, immediately performing a donkey roll, completely abandoning its gentlemanly image. When it looked up again, the human youth had already turned and fled. Feeling thoroughly played and humiliated, it charged after him furiously.

When it closed in a second time, Qin Ming once again turned and raised the small dagger at it. As a result, its earlier rage instantly turned into fear again! If it happened twice, it would naturally happen a third time. By the fifth time, the Old Donkey believed that Qin Ming was indeed a spent force, unable to unleash such a deadly move again. It raised its hooves, chasing desperately, intent on kicking this visibly weakened human youth to smithereens!

However, this time, Qin Ming poured his Celestial Radiance unreservedly into the small dagger, causing it to glow intensely for an instant before he hurled it at close range. With a thwack, the Old Donkey avoided a vital spot, but its body was pierced, a bloody hole appearing straight through it! This reminded it of an unpleasant past, the years it had been "enslaved." It had endured for a long time before rising to power, naturally possessing a cautious side. Now, it immediately turned and fled.

Qin Ming picked up the exotic gold-forged dagger, leaning against an old tree to keep himself from collapsing. Blood continuously seeped from his nose and mouth; he was severely injured. As he gasped for breath, his chest heaved violently. The broken bones in his chest and abdomen had pierced his internal organs, causing cold sweat to pour down him. He endured the intense pain to set his own bones. If the broken bones were to pierce further into his internal organs, the situation would be even worse.

Qin Ming had no time to linger, moving through the dense forest. He needed to find a place to refine the silver heart. He couldn't undergo a so-called "on-the-spot breakthrough" right now; rebirth was a process that required one or two days.

"Over here!" a bird cried out in mid-air.

*Pop!*

Then, it exploded, shot down by Qin Ming with a common iron arrow!

His situation was dire. The Old Donkey had given orders, and many fierce raptors and exotic beasts, both flying and running, had been mobilized. This territory belonged to the four old demons, and those bird demons and beast monsters dared not disobey.

A five-meter-long Fire Bat approached, flapping its blood-red fleshy wings. It was not comparable to the four old demons, but it was at the Outer Saint level and posed a significant threat to the increasingly weakened Qin Ming.

Qin Ming took a deep breath, adjusted his state, and once again drew his bow and shot an arrow. This time, he deliberately feigned weakness, and the iron arrow he shot was not very powerful. The Fire Bat was cautious and did not close in. It opened its mouth and spewed a blinding red light of extremely high temperature, incinerating the large tree Qin Ming was leaning against into ash.

Qin Ming dodged somewhat clumsily. He didn't waste Celestial Radiance to protect himself, resulting in a lock of his hair catching fire, which he cut off with a palm strike. The Fire Bat closed the distance, flapping its demonic, blood-red fleshy wings. It greedily sniffed, catching the scent of the Silver Wolf King's heart. It continuously sprayed intense fire from its mouth.

Qin Ming drew his bow. This time, he used a jade-iron arrow, putting all his strength into it. With a thwack, it struck the Fire Bat's head, and the domineering Celestial Radiance exploded. The headless bat corpse crashed down, breaking many thick branches.

A towering ancient tree suddenly shattered, and a giant bear silently appeared, ambushing Qin Ming. A bear paw descended, causing the tree trunk he was leaning against to explode. The severely weakened Qin Ming stumbled, sidestepping to avoid the blow. The giant bear roared, charging at him. Such a massive creature was quite dangerous for Qin Ming in his current state; it clearly also possessed Outer Saint level strength.

Trees in this area snapped, and a bloody light emanated from the giant bear, indicating its ferocity. Dense trees continuously fell, as if it intended to level the entire area.

After a struggle, Qin Ming suddenly leaped up, plunging his blade into the giant bear's head. With a boom, the massive bear corpse crashed to the ground. Qin Ming also collapsed with it, covered in bear blood, lying there, not wanting to move.

He was exhausted but had to struggle to his feet, as more monsters were appearing nearby. Clearly, he wouldn't be able to find a quiet place to refine the silver heart anytime soon.

He sat where he was, first cultivating the Wuji Scripture to absorb a small amount of earth essence to recover his strength. Then, gripping the silver, flowing heart, he directly drank a mouthful of the silver blood.

According to the records in the Fate-Altering Scripture, the silver blood should be refined with Celestial Radiance, repeatedly purified. Eventually, its medicinal properties would transform into a cloud-like mist, nourishing the flesh and blood body. But where could he be so meticulous now?

After drinking the silver blood, he felt his stomach burning, as if it was about to be pierced through. Sure enough, the method was too crude and caused problems. The Fate-Altering Scripture's method for extracting medicinal properties was very reasonable; this wolf blood had overly complex components. Even in this era, one should first find an alchemist to refine the silver blood essence, not just gulp it down like this.

Qin Ming's abdomen was in severe pain, as if it were being torn apart. He felt as if his intestines had snapped and wished he could roll on the ground. The Silver Wolf King once had limitless potential and grew extremely fast, but its transformation into a silver creature failed, causing its cultivation to stagnate. Besides producing some silver blood, it also produced some harmful substances.

Qin Ming was drenched. Besides sweat, fine threads of blood even seeped from his pores.

After a long time, the intense pain gradually subsided.

Around Qin Ming, pairs of greedy eyes were watching. They were all exotic creatures, but they saw the massive bear corpse and the headless Fire Bat not far away, and for a moment, they dared not charge forward.

After Qin Ming endured the ordeal, he felt a vibrant surge of life within him. The beneficial silver blood had been absorbed, and his condition was improving. At the very least, he was no longer so weak.

Qin Ming leaped up, clutching his mutton-fat jade iron blade, and shot out like lightning. With thuds and puffs, he consecutively killed six exotic creatures, two of which were at the Outer Saint level.

Immediately, the area descended into great chaos. The beast monsters, bird demons, and others scattered in all directions.

After such a struggle, Qin Ming felt exhausted again. He urgently needed quiet recuperation, but the surviving old demons wouldn't give him the time.

With his rich experience in wilderness survival, he quickly found several plants, crushed their leaves, and smeared the juice on his body to mask his scent. Unfortunately, the silver wolf heart was difficult to deal with; no matter what he did, its faint, alluring fragrance could not be concealed.

Qin Ming continued to move away, but he was always discovered by monsters. Fortunately, that mouthful of silver wolf blood was still working, his body was hot, and his life force was growing stronger.

Qin Ming knew he wouldn't find a place for quiet recuperation. Rather than wait, he might as well refine the silver heart directly. After a slight recovery, he activated his Celestial Radiance, emitting brilliant light that enveloped the incredibly valuable wolf heart, continuously refining it.

Silver mist steamed, light particles swirled, and a unique medicinal fragrance wafted out, exceptionally alluring, especially to exotic creatures, for whom the temptation was simply fatal. Large numbers of beast monsters appeared again.

Even though Qin Ming used Celestial Radiance to bind the silver heart, trying to contain all the light mist and medicinal fragrance around himself, faint traces still overflowed. He couldn't worry about that anymore; once the refinement of the silver blood began, he didn't want to stop.

Along the way, combat was unavoidable, and he fought his way through.

The Old Donkey also appeared twice. Seeing Qin Ming refining the silver heart, even it couldn't help but swallow its saliva. It led a pack of demons to attack Qin Ming, but it was not at peak condition, with a bloody hole in its body. It was quite wary of Qin Ming and somewhat hesitant. Moreover, it noticed that Qin Ming's condition was getting better and better.

Finally, the Old Donkey decisively sent a message to the "outer domain," calling for allies and issuing a kill order to eliminate this human youth. The so-called outer domain referred to areas outside the territories of the four old demons. Normally, other exotic creatures of similar power would not cross borders rashly. Now, it had actively invited them, making an exception!

Immediately, Qin Ming found himself in a life-or-death crisis once again.

Qin Ming had previously lingered in this area, not venturing far, mainly because he was worried about encountering powerful unknown fiends and monsters from other territories. After all, the four old demons in this territory were now injured and disabled, making it relatively safer. As a result, the Old Donkey began "summoning monsters," and everything changed.

With birds relaying messages, almost instantly, powerful creatures in adjacent territories learned of the situation. "Although this fellow, the Silver Wolf, failed his evolution, he still retains some silver blood." A portion of astonishingly powerful old demons were alarmed. Even if their cultivation was profound and they didn't need the heart themselves, they could bestow it upon their descendants.

Qin Ming fled again. His condition was much better, but the monsters he encountered were also becoming increasingly powerful.

Currently, he was being chased by a Black Elephant, an old demon that had crossed over from an adjacent territory. It was massive in size, comparable in strength to the Silver Wolf King. He hadn't fully recovered yet and was quite passive against this giant elephant. When its thick elephant legs moved, the ground shook, and its enormous trunk swept out, shattering ancient trees. Twice, Qin Ming narrowly avoided being trampled by its massive foot.

The Black Elephant's entire body erupted with Celestial Radiance. Its immense size posed a fatal threat to Qin Ming in his current state. During the chase, he used a jade-iron arrow, finding the perfect opportunity to draw his bow and shoot out one of the Black Elephant's eyeballs, causing it to scream repeatedly and nearly fall to the ground. Jade-iron arrows could also pierce through Celestial Radiance, though not with the devastating force of exotic gold.

"What a pity, another jade-iron arrow lost. I wonder if I can find it later," Qin Ming thought, naturally not lingering, turning and leaving.

Next, he was quite furious. Some human adventurers on the Godfall Plains, having heard the news, also rushed over, not to help, but to hunt him! Those people stared at the silver heart in his hand, all revealing greedy expressions!

In the dense jungle, after Qin Ming cleanly severed the head of a middle-aged man with a single blade strike, he continued his flight without stopping.

"Brother, we're on the same side, I'm here to help you!" A young man appeared, spreading his hands in the bushes, indicating he had no ill intent.

However, from behind Qin Ming, several cold arrows crafted from mystic gold shot out, aiming for his head, heart, and other vital spots. His current condition had significantly improved. Not only was his Celestial Radiance gradually becoming abundant, but his spiritual sagacity and intuitive awareness had also accumulated, making his instinctive reactions exceptionally keen.

Qin Ming dodged the cold arrows, gripping his mutton-fat jade iron blade, and launched a counterattack! Moments later, three heads rolled on the ground, and he floated away.

As time passed, Qin Ming gradually refined the essence from the silver heart. The composition of the silver blood was extremely complex. It contained spiritual substances that could enable his seventh rebirth, as well as mysterious medicinal properties that could deepen his innermost foundation, making it incredibly precious!

The bad news was that this area had completely descended into chaos. Demons and monsters ran rampant, and even some human adventurers were involved, all wanting to hunt Qin Ming.

He took a deep breath and discarded the shriveled silver heart.

Outside his body, silver mist steamed, light particles swirled, enveloping him. The unique medicinal fragrance was intensely rich. Qin Ming repeatedly purified, then began to absorb. Rebirth was a process that would take one or two days, but from this moment on, his body would gradually grow stronger!
