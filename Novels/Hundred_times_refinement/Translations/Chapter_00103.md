# Chapter 53: Herb Purification  

Holding the Scarlet Vine Grass in his hand, Lin Xuan carefully released his spiritual sense. Since this was his first attempt at purifying herbs, he proceeded with extreme caution.  

This was a new experiment!  

After reaching the late stage of the Spiritual Movement Realm, Lin Xuan's spiritual sense had grown even stronger, and his mastery over the blue light points had become highly refined. So far, he had already purified thousands of pills.  

However, finished pills were undoubtedly different from fresh medicinal herbs. Lin Xuan had no choice but to start from scratch and explore the process anew.  

He gathered the blue light points and guided them slowly through his meridians, allowing them to emerge from his right palm into the air.  

In the past, when Lin Xuan had first begun purifying pills, once the blue light left his body, he could no longer control it. The light would scatter with the wind, with only a small portion entering the pills to carry out purification—a significant waste.  

But back then, his cultivation had been weak. Manipulating intangible light points in midair had been far too difficult. Now, however, he had reached the late stage of the Spiritual Movement Realm, and his spiritual sense had greatly strengthened. Although he had yet to learn the Spirit Control Technique, his Object Manipulation Technique had already reached its peak.  

By borrowing the method used to control spiritual artifacts, he attached his spiritual sense to the blue light. This way, even though the light points were exposed to the air, they remained gathered and did not disperse, moving according to his will.  

He slowly guided the light points into the herb while simultaneously using a portion of his spiritual sense to carefully observe the changes within the Scarlet Vine Grass. Under the influence of the immortal technique, the internal structure of the herb was magnified.  

Inside, he saw two intertwined substances—one green and one red—tightly entangled. One of them was undoubtedly impurities.  

But then, a new problem arose. Which was the essence, and which was the useless impurity? When purifying pills, the light points could distinguish on their own, passing through the essence while pushing the impurities aside. However, with the herb, the situation seemed different. Whether it was the green or red substance, the light points pushed both.  

It seemed he would have to distinguish the impurities himself!  

After a moment of hesitation, Lin Xuan directed the light points to bypass the green substance and push the red substance outward. At the same time, he carefully controlled the flow speed of the blue light.  

...  

An hour passed in the blink of an eye.  

Lin Xuan stared silently at the herb in his hand and the pile of red powder before him.  

His judgment had been correct—the red powder emitted a foul stench, undoubtedly impurities. Yet, even after purifying it out, the herb showed no change. Following the identification methods described in books, Lin Xuan carefully examined its color, fragrance, and even tasted a leaf to assess its medicinal properties. However, its grade remained unchanged—it was still a low-grade Scarlet Vine Grass.  

---  

How could this be? Could it be that the blue light points could only purify pills and had no effect on fresh herbs?  

Lin Xuan remained silent for a long while, unwilling to give up. He took another Scarlet Vine Grass from the basket and decided to try the opposite approach this time—instead of removing impurities, he would extract the green substance, which he believed to be the essence. He manipulated the light points to push the green substance outward.  

An hour later...  

The Scarlet Vine Grass in his hand had withered, and in his palm lay a pool of pale green liquid, exuding a refreshing fragrance.  

Lin Xuan discarded the ruined herb and took out an empty jade bottle from his robes, carefully storing the green liquid inside.  

This liquid was the essence of the Scarlet Vine Grass. However, since it had been extracted from a low-grade herb, he wasn’t sure if its efficacy matched that of a high-grade Scarlet Vine Grass.  

This was his first attempt at herb purification, and many things remained unknown. He had to proceed cautiously, feeling his way forward. After a moment of hesitation, Lin Xuan took a small sip of the green liquid.  

This wasn’t a reckless act. Back in the library, he had thoroughly researched the Scarlet Vine Grass and confirmed that, as a crucial ingredient for pill refinement, it was a beneficial medicinal herb for cultivation. The green liquid was its essence, and even if it didn’t produce the desired effect, it would at least be harmless to the body.  

Still, to be safe, he only drank a tiny amount.  

Then, he sat cross-legged and used his Inner Vision Technique to observe the changes within his body. Almost immediately, the medicinal effects took hold.  

After being ingested, the green liquid transformed into a gaseous substance that entered his dantian. Lin Xuan felt a flicker of nervousness—the dantian was where spiritual power was stored, the very foundation of cultivation. Any mishap here would be disastrous.  

He mobilized his spiritual power, standing guard and ready to expel the gaseous substance at the first sign of trouble.  

Fortunately, no anomalies occurred. Once inside the dantian, the gas merely expanded, forming a transparent sphere that hovered motionlessly in midair.  

The situation was unexpected. Lin Xuan focused his spiritual sense on his dantian and observed quietly for a while. Then, he gathered a wisp of spiritual power and gently touched the sphere. To his surprise, the spiritual power was immediately absorbed into the sphere, enveloped within it.  

Lin Xuan didn’t panic. When faced with a new problem, staying calm was key to finding a solution.  

He realized that although his spiritual power had entered the sphere, his connection to it through his spiritual sense remained intact. He could still control it freely without any hindrance.  

With this discovery, Lin Xuan relaxed and continued his experiments.  

---  

Night fell, and evening arrived before he knew it. Lin Xuan stood up from the ground, his face brimming with joy. He had succeeded!  

Although the books hadn’t provided a detailed description of how high-grade Scarlet Vine Grass concealed one’s cultivation—merely mentioning it in passing—Lin Xuan was certain that the green liquid’s concealment effect was even better.  

The process was simple: after drinking the liquid, it transformed into gas and formed a sphere in the dantian. He could then inject his spiritual power into the sphere.  

The sphere wouldn’t sever his spiritual sense’s connection to the spiritual power, meaning he could freely withdraw or add spiritual power without affecting his ability to cast spells or engage in combat. However, once the spiritual power was enveloped by the sphere, it became undetectable to others.  

As everyone knew, a cultivator’s strength was judged by the amount of spiritual power they possessed. By hiding a portion of his spiritual power, Lin Xuan could prevent others from accurately gauging his true strength—effectively achieving his goal of concealment.
