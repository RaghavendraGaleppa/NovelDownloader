# Chapter 672: Primordial Dao Lord

He remained silent for a moment, his voice still steady. "The Dao Fruit of the Grand Lunar Mirror does share some connection with this Venerable One's Dao techniques. I once expended considerable effort to deduce its trajectory. That you were able to seize it is your fate, and also your capability."

He paused, his gaze meeting Xu Yunfan's directly, calm and波澜不惊 (ripple-free).

"In my heart, naturally, I am displeased."

He openly admitted his emotion, which instead made Xu Yunfan's heart relax slightly.

"But as you have said, at that time you were trapped in a dead end in your Dao Comprehension. To seek a sliver of life, any means are justified. This is the norm in the Cultivation World."

"Moreover," True Lord Pudu's tone shifted, "the matter is now a foregone conclusion. That Dao Fruit has already merged with your Divine Spark, becoming inseparable. Could this Venerable One possibly, for the sake of a now-useless object, seize the foundation of our sect's newly ascended Divine Spark True Lord?"

"Harming others without benefiting oneself, merely depleting the sect's vitality—no wise man would do such a thing. Let this matter rest, never to be mentioned again."

"Harming others without benefiting oneself, no wise man would do such a thing."

Xu Yunfan pondered these words internally, gaining a clearer understanding of True Lord Pudu's character.

It was extremely characteristic of the Primordial Sect—a thorough pragmatism where interests reign supreme.

As long as the benefits are sufficient, or the price is unaffordable, a mortal enemy one moment can be smiling the next.

Similarly, with enough temptation or threat, the current harmony could collapse in an instant.

This True Lord had clearly calculated the overall interests of the sect and his personal gains and losses with extreme clarity.

Giving up the Grand Lunar Mirror Dao Fruit to gain the support and stability of a new True Lord with immense potential, who had just eliminated a potential great threat for the sect—this was clearly worth it in True Lord Pudu's calculations.

As for whether he harbored other schemes in his heart, that was unknown.

Xu Yunfan immediately showed a look of relief on his face, tinged with gratitude and a hint of appropriate歉意 (remorse) from a junior toward a senior.

As the saying goes, one must play the part to the end.

"Venerable True Lord, your magnanimity is as vast as the sea. This disciple is endlessly grateful. This disciple will surely remember the恩惠 (favor) of your forgiveness today. If there is any command in the future, I will surely devote my utmost effort."

Naturally, such flattering words must be said to the fullest.

"Good."

True Lord Pudu nodded, seemingly quite satisfied with Xu Yunfan's attitude.

He changed the subject. "Since there is no further business, you may go and select your immortal mountain. Once chosen, an elder will naturally open the mountain gate for you and regulate the earth veins. The sect's laws and卷宗 (records) will be delivered to your Dao field shortly."

"As you command, Senior Brother."

Xu Yunfan bowed again, preparing to take his leave.

"Wait a moment."

True Lord Pudu suddenly spoke to stop him, a profound and inscrutable smile appearing on his face.

"I almost forgot one thing. Since you are now a True Lord of our sect, you are qualified to pay respects to the Dao Lord's Dharma Form. Follow this Venerable One."

Dao Lord?

The Primordial Dao Lord!

Xu Yunfan's heart shook violently. This was a legendary existence who founded the Primordial lineage, transcendent and detached, existing in a dimension unknown to others.

He forcefully suppressed the shock in his heart and replied, "It is only right."

True Lord Pudu rose to his feet and took a single step, arriving outside the great hall.

Xu Yunfan hurriedly followed.

True Lord Pudu did not employ any earth-shattering evasion technique; he simply walked at a leisurely pace. With every step, a cloud of qi naturally formed beneath his feet, supporting him as he strolled through the void, heading toward the even more profound and secluded area at the back of Chenghua Mountain, where the fluctuations of the Dao's laws were more obscure.

Xu Yunfan followed closely behind, his body transforming into a flash of lightning, maintaining an appropriate distance in case the other party suddenly attacked.

Although the other was at the middle stage of the Golden Core, if Xu Yunfan wanted to escape, he could still get away.

Setting aside other things, just his attainments in formations, aided by his attribute panel, would allow him to break free in an instant.

Not long after, an ancient and unadorned hall, built entirely from unknown dark gray boulders, appeared before them.

The hall was not magnificent; it even seemed somewhat low and粗犷 (rugged). Above the lintel, there was no plaque or sign, only a profound talisman that seemed naturally formed, containing the meaning of the Primordial Beginning.

Here, an ancient and vast atmosphere弥漫 (permeated).

This was the sacrificial hall of the Primordial Sect where the Dao Lord was enshrined.

The Primordial Palace.

True Lord Pudu stopped before the palace gate, his expression becoming infinitely solemn and devout, no longer carrying any trace of his usual compassion or indifference, leaving only a reverence from the depths of his heart.

A Dao Lord.

No amount of reverence is excessive.

He straightened his robes and performed the most standard grand Taoist ritual, bowing deeply three times and kowtowing nine times toward the gate.

After completing this, he rose and said to Xu Yunfan, "Focus your mind, dispel distracting thoughts, and follow this Venerable One inside. Remember, do not harbor the slightest thought of blasphemy."

The heavy palace gates, as if forged from the core of a star, slid open without a sound after True Lord Pudu chanted devoutly and imprinted a Dharma Seal.

An even more ancient and vast qi, as if containing the birth and destruction of the universe, rushed toward them.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, retracting the power of his Divine Spark Golden Core to the extreme. His mind was clear and澄净 (purified), as he followed True Lord Pudu into the hall.

The interior of the hall was incredibly spacious, without any ornate decorations. In the very center stood a shrine carved from the same dark gray boulders.

Within the shrine, there was no enshrined statue or tablet, only a团 (mass) of qi and light that constantly condensed and dissipated, changing form.

This light and shadow had no fixed form; at times it was like a gas, at times like an egg. At times it manifested the scene of the creation of the heavens and earth, and at times it reverted to absolute nothingness.

Just a single glance made Xu Yunfan feel his Golden Core trembling violently, his soul seeming to be sucked into that endless cycle of birth and destruction, as insignificant as a speck of dust.

"Kneel down, worship with sincerity, and offer your heart's incense."

True Lord Pudu's solemn voice echoed in the empty hall; he had already恭敬ly (respectfully) knelt down again.

Xu Yunfan dared not be negligent and immediately followed suit. He focused his mind, free of distracting thoughts, and performed the grand礼 of three bows and nine kowtows toward that chaotic light and shadow.

With each kowtow, he凝聚 (condensed) his spirit and mind, silently reciting his reverence and longing for the Primordial Dao.

When he raised his head after the final kowtow, a wisp of purest incense, born from his fingertips, naturally condensed. It fused his most fundamental divine sense and magical power, carrying the true meaning of the Divine Spark's Destruction and the Profound Vault's Immortality. He respectfully offered it to that chaotic light and shadow.

Just as that wisp of heart incense was about to merge with the light and shadow.

Hum!

An indescribable, irresistible sense of being watched descended suddenly.

It was as if from above the nine heavens, from beyond the endless void, a pair of unimaginably majestic and ancient eyes had pierced through countless barriers and landed upon Xu Yunfan.

In an instant, Xu Yunfan felt that from his physical body to his soul, and down to the Divine Spark Golden Core he had painstakingly refined, from the inside out, from past to future, everything had been seen through by this gaze.

It was a scrutiny billions of times more profound than True Lord Pudu's.

A great fear originating from the very essence of life instantly gripped him, making him almost suffocate.

He felt that under this gaze, he was as insignificant as a speck of dust, his life and death existing only in a single thought of the other.

He instinctively wanted to circulate his Golden Core to resist, but he immediately and forcefully suppressed this impulse.

In the face of such an existence, any resistance was futile and might even invite destruction.

He could only preserve his mind, maintain the posture of offering the incense, and allow that gaze to inspect him. In his heart, there was nothing left but pure reverence and submission.
