# Chapter 9: Worthy of Our Ancestors, Worthy of Our Descendants  

**Red Copper Mountain Range.**  

**Earthfire Chamber.**  

Chen Xianhe stared blankly at the massive structure before him—several zhang tall and a zhang in diameter.  

What was even more peculiar was the faint spiritual glow emanating from it, indicating that this colossal object was actually a magical artifact.  

Turning to Chen Daoxuan beside him, Chen Xianhe couldn't help but ask, "You just said this thing—this 'Spirit Melting Furnace'—can help you refine spirit ore?"  

"Exactly!" Chen Daoxuan nodded firmly. "To be precise, the Spirit Melting Furnace not only aids artificers in refining spirit ore but also doesn’t require cultivator control. Just a few ordinary mortals can operate it!"  

Hearing this, Chen Xianhe was stunned.  

The idea that it could assist artificers in refining spirit ore was already astonishing enough, but the fact that it didn’t even require cultivator control was beyond belief—it was downright earth-shattering.  

If what Chen Daoxuan said was true, the significance of this artifact would be immense.  

Though Chen Xianhe had never become an artificer himself, he had studied the family’s artificing legacy in his youth and was familiar with the basics of artifact forging.  

He knew that in crafting low-grade magical artifacts, refining materials was often the most time-consuming and labor-intensive part.  

If a few mortals and a furnace could solve the problem of refining spirit ore, the speed at which artificers could forge artifacts would increase dramatically.  

As the clan leader of the Twin Lakes Island Chen Family, he grasped the implications immediately.  

Seeing the skepticism on his uncle’s face, Chen Daoxuan wasted no time and demonstrated the furnace’s operation right before his eyes.  

Four hours later...  

"Due to the sealed nature of the Spirit Melting Furnace, it refines spirit ore faster than artificers using heat-gathering arrays directly. What would normally take three days to refine red copper ore now only takes four hours."  

As he spoke, Chen Daoxuan manipulated the second control lever, extracting a mass of crimson molten liquid from the furnace.  

Though Chen Xianhe wasn’t an artificer, he could still sense the rich spiritual essence radiating from the glowing red mass.  

He summoned the molten liquid closer, blinking as he examined it, then looked back at the furnace. His aged face flushed deeper and deeper until he finally burst into unrestrained laughter.  

"Hahaha!!"  

"HAHAHAHA!!!"  

His laughter lasted a full half-cup of tea’s time before subsiding.  

Realizing he had lost his composure in front of his nephew, Chen Xianhe’s face reddened slightly, but he quickly brushed it aside.  

"Daoxuan, how much does it cost to forge this Spirit Melting Furnace?"  

Noting the seriousness in his uncle’s tone, Chen Daoxuan straightened his expression. "Clan Leader, the furnace requires two materials: iron ore and Moonstone. The iron ore is cheap, but the main expense is the Moonstone."  

He paused. "This furnace consumed thirty-nine jin of Moonstone, which would cost about 195 spirit stones."  

Though Moonstone was a first-tier spirit ore like red copper, its price was significantly higher—five spirit stones per jin—due to its scarcity in the Myriad Stars Sea.  

Of course, with the Qian Yuan Sword Sect’s continuous wars against the Cloudrise Kingdom and their plundering of resources, Moonstone prices had been steadily dropping.  

In truth, the most abundant and cheapest spirit ore in the Myriad Stars Sea wasn’t Moonstone or red copper, but a first-tier ore called Black Iron.  

This material was not only plentiful in the Myriad Stars Sea but practically overflowing in the Immortal Cloud Continent.  

So much so that many low-level cultivators—who neither understood artificing nor could afford proper artifacts—would crudely refine Black Iron and use it as a makeshift "artifact," much to the amusement of others.  

"195 spirit stones? That’s cheap. Not expensive at all."  

Chen Xianhe stroked his goatee, chuckling.  

He knew full well that compared to the benefits it provided artificers, 195 spirit stones were a trivial cost.  

Standing beside him, Chen Daoxuan shook his head. "Ahem, Clan Leader, the 195 spirit stones are just the furnace’s cost. You haven’t factored in the expense of building an Earthfire Chamber yet."  

Chen Xianhe froze.  

"Why build another Earthfire Chamber? Doesn’t the family already have this one?"  

The mention of constructing a new Earthfire Chamber immediately unsettled him.  

He knew exactly how costly building one was—after all, this very chamber had been constructed under his leadership.  

Back then, it had cost over two thousand spirit stones to complete.  

Seeing Chen Xianhe’s miserly expression, Chen Daoxuan’s mind stirred. Judging by his uncle’s reaction, it seemed the family still had a considerable stockpile!  

Keeping his thoughts hidden, Chen Daoxuan said calmly, "Clan Leader, this Earthfire Chamber is fine, but it’s too small.  

"Moreover, its original layout has many inefficiencies. For instance, the heat-gathering array here becomes redundant with the Spirit Melting Furnace. And then there’s this area..."  

Chen Daoxuan proceeded to list every flaw he could find in the chamber.  

By the time he finished, Chen Xianhe’s face had turned ashen.  

"Hmph!"  

Chen Xianhe snorted. "Is the chamber I built really that inadequate?"  

Noticing his uncle’s displeasure, Chen Daoxuan quickly shook his head like a rattle-drum. "That’s not what I meant. It’s just that with the Spirit Melting Furnace, this chamber isn’t very practical anymore.  

"Besides, think about it, Uncle. To maximize an artificer’s efficiency, each one should have at least four or five Spirit Melting Furnaces.  

"Right now, this chamber can barely fit them, but what if the family produces more artificers in the future? Will this space still be enough?"  

Chen Xianhe scoffed. "The family only has two cultivators right now, and you’re already dreaming of a whole army of artificers? Even the Zhou Family isn’t as bold as you!"  

"Heh heh!"  

As Chen Daoxuan grinned foolishly, Chen Xianhe fell into deep thought.  

After a long silence, he turned to Chen Daoxuan with solemnity.  

"Come with me."  

The two flew one after the other toward Chen Xianhe’s cave abode.  

Within the time it took to burn a stick of incense, they landed before the cave entrance.  

Chen Xianhe remained silent the entire journey, while Chen Daoxuan, sensing what was coming, felt a growing anticipation.  

Entering the cave, they wound through several passages before stopping before a wall made of Dragon-Severing Stone.  

Gazing at the smooth, jade-like surface, Chen Xianhe mused, "Our Chen Family, since its founding ancestor Chen Dengyuan, has stood on Twin Lakes Island for 273 years. Do you know what has allowed us to endure this long?"  

He turned to face Chen Daoxuan.  

After a moment’s thought, Chen Daoxuan shook his head.  

"What has sustained our family for three centuries is the spirit of our ancestors—their willingness to strive and sacrifice for future generations! And the descendants’ commitment to carry on that legacy!"  

Chen Xianhe raised his chin slightly. "Ascending the path of immortality and blessing our descendants—for three hundred years, the Chen Family... has upheld this duty!"  

At this moment, Chen Xianhe thought of his eldest brother, who had died heroically in battle; of his seventh brother, who had given his life to protect him, the youngest of their clan; of all the ancestors who had sacrificed themselves, generation after generation, for the sake of the family.  

Moved by Chen Xianhe’s sorrowful mood, Chen Daoxuan fell silent.  

Though he knew the Chen Family had declined, Chen Xianhe had shielded him from hardship all these years, until his back had bent and his temples had grayed.  

Such devotion was something no one with a heart could ignore.  

"Uncle, in this life, I, Daoxuan, vow to inherit our ancestors’ will—to be worthy of those who came before us and those who will follow!"  

Chen Daoxuan spoke with unwavering resolve.  

Hearing this, Chen Xianhe’s eyes reddened as he stared at him. Finally, he gave a firm nod.  

"With a descendant like you, our Chen Family is truly fortunate!"
