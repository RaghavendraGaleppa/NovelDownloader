# Chapter 55: Millennial Treasure Herb, Condensing the Three Flowers

Standing in the empty royal residence, Dou Changsheng paced back and forth, meticulously searching every inch of the premises. 

The residence was devoid of any living souls—clearly, Wang Chongguang had prepared for the worst and already relocated his family. After an exhaustive search, Dou Changsheng was deeply disappointed. 

Though the estate covered a vast area, there was nothing of tangible value to be found—only immovable assets that couldn't be taken away. These were useless to Dou Changsheng; without deeds, they couldn't be sold, and attempting to do so would only invite accusations of murder and theft. While Dou Changsheng knew Wang Chongguang harbored ill intentions, ordinary people would surely believe he had killed the man to seize his property.

After combing through every room, large and small, in search of martial arts manuals, rare weapons, or elixirs, his attention turned to locating the hidden chamber. 

Everything else could be easily transported—except for the millennial treasure herb growing within the chamber. 

This thousand-year-old herb was likely native to this location, making transplantation extremely difficult. Given time, Wang Chongguang might have managed it, but Dou Changsheng speculated that Wang's malice had only arisen after learning of his arrival in Beiyang and his ranking on the Human Rankings. In such a short span, transplanting the herb would have been impossible unless Wang had harvested it outright.

Dou Changsheng wasn't entirely certain the herb still existed—he was simply gambling on luck. 

After all, seeing the deserted estate, anyone unaware of the herb's existence wouldn't have bothered with such an exhaustive search. 

After much effort, Dou Changsheng finally located the hidden chamber. 

As he opened the heavy door, a wave of scorching heat assaulted him, forcing him to instinctively recoil as the burning sensation seared his face. 

The underground chamber was unbearably hot, with blazing braziers placed at each corner, their flames fueled by some peculiar kind of wood that burned fiercely without ever diminishing. 

Upon closer inspection, Dou Changsheng noticed the wood was extraordinarily resilient, sustaining an intense heat far beyond that of ordinary flames. 

The temperature inside the chamber had to exceed a hundred degrees. 

Dou Changsheng enveloped himself in a protective barrier of innate qi, forming an impenetrable shield around his body before cautiously stepping inside. 

Each step forward intensified the pressure. 

Were it not for the Earth Evasion Talisman as his last resort, he wouldn't have dared enter, fearing the chamber might collapse and trap him inside. 

The resources Wang Chongguang had poured into constructing this chamber spoke volumes about the extreme conditions required for the millennial herb's survival.

Dou Changsheng slowly approached the treasure herb at the chamber's center. 

Growing within crimson mud, the herb stood about a foot tall, its fiery-red leaves etched with flame-like patterns that radiated blistering heat. 

*Fireglow Grass.* 

Dou Changsheng recognized it instantly. 

His recent diligent studies had paid off—he could now identify many valuable herbs. 

Fireglow Grass thrived in harsh environments, typically found in volcanic regions where ordinary martial artists couldn't endure the extreme heat, making it exceedingly rare and precious. 

What made it truly exceptional was that, after a thousand years, its leaves would develop flame-like veins, embodying the essence of fire. 

In simpler terms, consuming it enhanced one's affinity for fire-based martial arts, amplifying their power and easing the learning process. 

This was a treasure capable of altering one's innate talents—any such herb was invaluable. 

For those of noble birth but mediocre aptitude, it was nothing short of miraculous. 

While its ability to enhance talent was its primary value, its secondary effect—aiding in the condensation of the Three Flowers—was no less significant. 

Any herb that reached a thousand years of age inevitably possessed extraordinary properties. 

Even ordinary plants that survived a millennium could be considered spiritual herbs, let alone a true treasure like this. 

*Truly a rare gem.* 

But then Dou Changsheng cursed inwardly. 

*Damn it.* 

He thought of Future Dou—aloof and indifferent—and compared him to his own ecstatic reaction, feeling like a country bumpkin who had never seen the world. 

The contrast was staggering. 

*Thank goodness for my sister.* 

Now, how was one supposed to consume Fireglow Grass? 

After a moment's thought, he recalled it had to be eaten raw. 

It wasn't that he couldn't remember—it was just that the herb's intense heat made him hesitate. 

Approaching the millennial Fireglow Grass, he reached out cautiously, his hand sheathed in innate qi, ready to withdraw if the temperature proved unbearable. 

But to his surprise, the leaves didn't burn him at all—a stark contrast to the surrounding inferno. 

If scientists from his past life saw this, they'd probably jump off a building in disbelief. 

As he plucked a leaf, the roots began withering at a visible rate. 

Disappointed, Dou Changsheng abandoned his plan to harvest the entire plant. Instead, he grabbed the roots and took a bite, chewing them along with the leaf. 

---

*Eat it?* 

*Of course he'd eat it.* 

Just because the roots were withering didn't mean they were no longer part of the millennial Fireglow Grass. 

Dou Changsheng lived by the principle of never wasting anything. 

As he swallowed the herb, warmth spread from his stomach, permeating his flesh, bones, and organs. 

A soothing heat enveloped his entire body, making him instinctively narrow his eyes in contentment. 

His innate qi surged within him, and the dormant Millennial Earth Pearl suddenly awakened, absorbing and refining the energy. 

Simultaneously, an ethereal flower materialized above him. 

Innate qi poured into it, solidifying the flower until it bloomed in full—a pristine, nine-petaled manifestation. 

This was the Qi Flower, the first of the Three Flowers, now fully bloomed without the slightest resistance. 

The most challenging of the three—the Heaven Flower—had been successfully condensed. 

His innate qi began transforming, growing denser, almost liquid in consistency. 

The Three Flowers represented the condensation of innate qi into true essence, and the process had now begun. 

Stepping outside, Dou Changsheng dispelled his protective barrier and stood at the chamber's entrance, testing his newfound resistance to heat. 

What had once been unbearable now felt like a gentle breeze. 

With innate qi swirling around him, he walked back to the braziers and extended his hand into the flames. 

The heat was still intense—painful, even—but now within tolerable limits. 

In gaming terms: 

*Fire Resistance +20!* 

He had taken another step toward transcending humanity, growing ever stronger.
