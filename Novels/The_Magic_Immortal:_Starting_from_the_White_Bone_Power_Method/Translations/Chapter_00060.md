# Chapter 60: Divine Ability - Skin-Stripping Blood Curse  

"Oh? What's the hurry?"  

He Changkong glanced at Ah Wei before lowering his gaze, speaking calmly.  

"To have fun with him! Every time sister-in-law comes back from his stall, her face is all flushed." Ah Wei hesitated for a moment before gritting his teeth and adding, "Last time, she even sneaked into Langyun Teahouse in the market and booked a private room—today, from mid-morning to early afternoon."  

"Heh, you've really grown cunning over the years. Not bad." He Changkong's lips curled into a faint smile as he stood up and patted Ah Wei's shoulder gently. "Your sister-in-law has a slight foot ailment due to a mismatch with her cultivation technique. I asked her to seek treatment from Wang Chan deliberately—it was just a way to get close to him. As for the teahouse, she was merely resting there temporarily. Her flying vessel isn't departing until late afternoon."  

"But—" Ah Wei opened his mouth to argue but then scratched his head with a sheepish grin. "Ah, I see. So you had everything planned all along. Well, I won’t disturb you further, brother. I’ll take my leave."  

"What's the rush? Since you're here, have some tea first." He Changkong poured him a cup with a warm smile.  

Unaware of any danger, Ah Wei raised the cup and drank.  

Suddenly—  

The tea turned blood-red the moment it touched his lips. He tried to spit it out, but his tongue went numb as leech-like tendrils sprouted from it, burrowing deep into his body and spreading through his limbs and meridians.  

"Ghhh—!" Ah Wei's veins bulged grotesquely as his face twisted in agony. He reached out toward He Changkong, trying to speak, but no words came out.  

"You've learned bad habits since coming here—developing an interest in women." He Changkong watched him coldly, disappointment heavy in his voice. "But even if you like women, you shouldn’t have set your sights on your sister-in-law. You’ve made things very difficult for me."  

As he spoke, a bloody radiance erupted from his body, thick with malevolence and a nauseating stench.  

Muttering an incantation, He Changkong's form twisted like a blood demon, his face contorting hideously. With a series of wet, tearing sounds, a layer of bloody skin peeled away from his body.  

The bloody skin then transformed into a crimson streak, latching onto Ah Wei’s body.  

Soon, He Changkong's monstrous appearance faded, his skin now smoother and paler than before.  

Opposite him, Ah Wei remained physically unchanged—but his eyes now mirrored He Changkong’s own.  

Patting Ah Wei’s cheek twice, He Changkong chuckled. "Ah Wei, this divine ability is called [Skin-Stripping Blood Curse]. A mid-grade technique… I hadn’t planned to use it on you so soon."  

But Ah Wei could no longer answer. He stood motionless, his expression blank.  

Yet as He Changkong laughed, Ah Wei’s earlier words suddenly resurfaced in his mind. His face twisted violently as madness overtook him.  

Bloody mist seeped from his pores, swirling around him like an unbreakable shroud. His spiritual energy churned uncontrollably—a clear sign of qi deviation.  

His expression darkened. With the last shreds of his sanity, he retrieved a mid-grade purple talisman from his storage pouch and slapped it onto his forehead. A violet light sank into his sea of consciousness, gradually stabilizing his rampaging energy.  

Slowly, He Changkong calmed down. He stood frozen for a moment before tears unexpectedly welled in his eyes. Glancing around, he turned to Ah Wei as if confiding in a friend, his voice thick with sorrow.  

"Ah Wei, do you know? She’s my forbidden fruit, my reverse scale. She’s not just my dao companion—she’s my hope for Foundation Establishment, the only pure thing left in this world for me. If she’s tainted… I’ll lose my mind. But I suppose you wouldn’t understand matters between men and women."  

His expression then turned anxious.  

"Mid-morning to early afternoon…"  

Muttering to himself, he checked the sky and frowned.  

Abruptly, he rolled up his sleeve. As he chanted, a faint red dot appeared on his left wrist.  

Seeing it, he exhaled in relief, a self-assured smile forming. "A-Jue, it must be that Wang Chan who seduced you, right? That damned pretty boy!"  

---  

A light drizzle veiled the distant mountains in mist. The Black River flowed silently a hundred zhang away, its ancient stone bridge standing timeless beneath the rain. If a refined female cultivator passed by with an oil-paper umbrella, it would make for a picturesque scene.  

Of course, if that woman happened to be the one in apricot-yellow robes, Wang Chan wouldn’t mind adding a touch of artistic flair to the landscape.  

At the moment, however, he sat cross-legged in a thicket of weeds, concealed by dense fog.  

Wearing the [White Ghost Mask], he had transformed into a burly man. His body was covered with mid-grade concealment and protection talismans, his breathing so faint he seemed one with the surroundings.  

The female cultivator named Su Jue resided in Tonglin Mountain.  

To reach Black River Market from there, this ancient bridge was the only route—just three to five li from the market itself.  

It was still early; the market hadn’t opened yet.  

Half an hour ago, Wang Chan had used two low-grade Wind Escape Talismans along with Swift Movement Talismans to arrive here and lie in wait.  

---  

A ripe, juicy spiritual peach, sweet and refreshing—if such a delicacy was delivered to his doorstep, refusing it would be a crime.  

Especially since this peach belonged to the household of the man who had stolen his spirit wine and congee. That made it all the more necessary to take a bite.  

He Changkong was elusive, impossible to ambush. So why not collect some interest first, then follow the trail to uproot the entire scheme?  

Wang Chan wasn’t entirely naive—he had considered whether Su Jue was a pawn sent by He Changkong to lure him in.  

But she had sought out his stall long before his feud with He Changkong began, clearly starved for attention.  

Moreover, their last rendezvous had been at Langyun Teahouse, located deep within the market’s eastern district.  

Markets strictly prohibited combat. Violators would face swift retribution from the patrolling guards—consequences too severe to risk.  

If He Changkong truly wanted to harm him, he wouldn’t have chosen a location inside the market.  

Most tellingly, Su Jue had even confided her real name and background before leaving, her gaze brimming with affection. If this was a trap, such details were unnecessary.  

Above all, if He Changkong wanted to deal with him, why send his own dao companion as bait?  

As the leader of the Black Eagle Gang, a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator with numerous followers, He Changkong could easily ambush a lone rogue cultivator like Wang Chan without resorting to convoluted schemes.  

And realistically, He Changkong had no reason to target him specifically. The man had likely bullied countless minor cultivators before—Wang Chan was just another face in the crowd.  

So perhaps he was overthinking it.  

Yet despite this, Wang Chan remained cautious.  

He had no intention of stepping foot in Langyun Teahouse.  

But the peach he had arranged for himself? That, he wouldn’t pass up.  

Better to lie in ambush here, wait for the "peach" to pass by, then knock her out and carry her off.  

Even if this was a trap, he’d have the upper hand.  

And if no opportunity arose, or if she never showed, he’d simply retreat and wait for another chance.  

Just then, two streaks of light tore across the sky—one white, one green—streaking like comets through the rain.  

Their speed far surpassed that of any Qi Refining cultivator’s flight techniques or artifacts.  

In an instant, they shattered the curtain of mist and landed on the ancient bridge, revealing a man and a woman.  

The man, clad in pristine white robes with sharp brows and starry eyes, wasted no time. The moment his feet touched the ground, he stepped forward, seizing the woman’s delicate hand with one palm while the other wrapped around her waist, pulling her into an embrace.  

His movements were practiced—clearly a seasoned lover.  

The woman, dressed in a flowing green dress, was strikingly beautiful. Tears streaked her face like pear blossoms in the rain, a sight to stir pity. As the man held her, she clutched her skirt, struggling weakly yet failing to break free.  

Wang Chan almost groaned in frustration.  

A simple push would’ve sufficed, yet she chose to wiggle helplessly instead. What was she thinking?  

But despite the absurdity, Wang Chan didn’t dare breathe too loudly. He suppressed his aura completely.  

Because the pressure radiating from these two wasn’t that of Qi Refining cultivators—  

They were Foundation Establishment experts!
