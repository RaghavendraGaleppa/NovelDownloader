# Chapter 120: Tie Qi, Bai Jinghong, and the Prodigies of the Hidden Dragon List (1/2)

The wandering martial artists immediately perked up. After all, regardless of anything else, the Qingyuan Sect was the number one sect in the Ziyang Prefecture.

Then, they saw a pair of young men and women step down from the foremost carriage belonging to the Sect Master.

The girl was as clear and cold as the moon, her beauty breathtaking. It was a beauty with an overwhelming presence that left everyone speechless, or perhaps they simply did not dare to speak.

Beside her was a young man with a gentle and amiable expression, looking sunny and easy-going, the kind of person who seemed approachable.

The two appeared to be chatting about something.

"So young... and they've already come? They look to be at most seventeen or eighteen."

"You're ignorant, old friend. That is the current Chief Disciple of the Qingyuan Sect, the Master of the Frost Sword. Rumor has it that even the senior sisters of the Qingyuan Sect cannot withstand a single move from her, and she has even slain a Divine Perception Realm expert."

"That's too outrageous. I'm an outsider, don't lie to me."

"Can a true disciple of a major sect defeat us with just one move?"

"That sounds a bit more plausible. Then what?"

"The gap between a true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect and us is the same as the gap between Ying Bing and a true disciple of the Qingyuan Sect."

"And the young man beside her? To stand shoulder to shoulder with Ying Bing, he must also be a dazzling prodigy, right?"

"What are they talking about? Could they be discussing some profound martial art?"

...

In the eyes of the wandering martial artists, these two were unfathomable. Every word and action carried an air of majesty.

But in reality...

"Tsk, tsk, the watermelons from our place are much tastier. It's the perfect season for watermelons, and we returned at just the right time."

"Mm."

"I'll put a watermelon in your room tonight. Watermelon is best eaten cold. By the way, have you ever had ice cream?"

"Ice cream?"

"I'll come to your room to teach you tonight."

Li Mo spoke, feeling a bit homesick for his own backyard. Unfortunately, he couldn't return for the time being.

He had written a letter home to explain the situation and had to ask someone from the Dongli Manor to help deliver it.

The procession of the Qingyuan Sect entered the manor.

The three elders, Xue Jing, Qian Bufan, and Yin Huaxuan, were received by a high-ranking figure from the Fenyu Forest and went to discuss matters.

As he left, Old Xue gave Li Mo a meaningful glance.

"The rain is going to get heavier later."

"I understand, Elder."

Li Mo nodded.

After the elders left, the disciples went to the main hall for the banquet.

The main hall was still quite empty, probably because the Qingyuan Sect had arrived early.

As the Chief Disciple, Luo Yu was greeting guests at the door, with a young girl chattering away beside him—it was naturally Luo Yao.

"Brother, did the King of the Northwest Hammers come today?"

"How would I know?"

"Did you inquire about the Hard Gang Bang for me?"

"I'm working on it. Go join the fun inside the hall. I'll tell you once I find out."

Luo Yu's head was throbbing.

His sister was good in every way, except she had a big mouth and loved to stir up trouble. Upon hearing that all sides of the Dongli Manor would be gathering, she clamored to come along, claiming she wanted to broaden her horizons and meet the heroes of the world.

"Haha."

A laugh came from the side.

Luo Yu turned around, his face immediately filled with displeasure.

It was Li Mo.

He was holding a small notebook and a pen.

"What are you doing here?" Luo Yu snorted.

Li Mo smiled. "You still owe me a favor."

Luo Yu: "..."

Remembering the two skewers of sugar-coated haws, he silently turned his head back.

Li Mo said no more and got down to business.

He opened his notebook, which was densely packed with rows of names.

All of them were pieces of information collected by the Eye of Providence.

Of course, for now, it was only information about the members of the Qingyuan Sect.

He had collected a bit about each person's situation and categorized them.

This was both for investment purposes and for preparation to enter the秘境 (secret realm).

He also planned to take a chance and see if he could run into that Han Zhen.

"Brother Luo."

Not far away, a burly man walked over. His upper body was covered in bulging muscles, while his lower body was wrapped in thick clothing.

Behind him followed his martial brothers, all of whom were also well-built and muscular, like bears.

Hmm.

A whole sect of muscular men. No need to guess, they must specialize in... oh no, in Hard Body Training.

**[Name: Tie Qi]**
**[Age: 27]**
**[Physique: Copper Skin and Iron Bones, Innate Divine Strength]**
**[Realm: Two Apertures of the Divine Perception Realm]**

---

**[Fate: Blue]**
**[Evaluation: Lost both legs in his early years. Earned the recognition of the Sect Master of the Gangdou Sect through sheer willpower and became the Chief Disciple of his generation.]**
**[Recent Encounters: Heard that the Blood Phoenix is a神奇 (divine object) that can allow the dead to be reborn from ashes and regrow severed limbs. Hopes to come and try his luck to repair his incomplete body. Valiant and upright, hated by evildoers, known to outsiders as the Big Brother of the Gang Sect.]**

Li Mo: "..."

Well, leaving aside that inexplicable nickname, this muscular brother was quite worth investing in. His evaluation was one of the higher ones among those with a Blue Fate.

"Eh?"

"I saw you writing here earlier. Do you know everyone?"

Luo Yao moved closer. Her brother was too busy to pay her attention.

Another reason was...

She felt that the way this young man was burying his head and writing looked a bit familiar... but she couldn't remember where she had seen it.

"I do."

Li Mo finished speaking and directly preempted her:

"I don't know the King of the Northwest Hammers, thank you, we're not close."

"Then..."

"There's no such thing as the Hard Gang Bang either."

"Oh..."

Luo Yao lowered her head in disappointment.

The corner of Li Mo's mouth twitched. "Why are you so obsessed with finding him?"

Luo Yao sighed:

"I said the King of the Northwest Hammers is the number one genius of the Eastern Wasteland Region, but no one believes me. They even said I'm out of my mind."

"How could I stand for that? I have to find Big Hammer Bro and slap them all in the face."

She had seen many so-called geniuses and outstanding figures.

None of them could compare to her Big Hammer Bro.

Unfortunately, no one believed her.

Big Hammer... Bro?

Watching the little girl clench her fists and transform into a little fan girl.

Li Mo was wondering if there was some kind of divine treasure in this martial world that could make people lose their memories.

*Please forget me.*

Little Li hoped that the image he left in the eyes of the world was that of a graceful, dashing, and elegant swordsman.

He had even thought up a nickname.

"By the way, what's your name?"

"Three miles of sword energy crisscrossing, a sword's light chills nineteen states. You can call me Li, the Jade Capital Sword Immortal, Mo."

Li Mo held his head high and spoke with conviction, not feeling the slightest bit embarrassed.

The Red Sky Sword trembled slightly, as if feeling a bit ashamed.

Perhaps the nickname was a bit long.

The little girl looked dazed as she listened.

"Li... what Mo?"

"The Jade Capital Sword Immortal."

"Li... Jade Capital... what Mo?"

"Sword Immortal."

"What Jade Capital Sword Immortal?"

"..."

So how did you remember "King of the Northwest Hammers, Hard Gang Bang" so clearly in one go?

Li Mo wondered if the problem was with him, if his nickname was too long.

"Heh..."

Suddenly, a disdainful and arrogant laugh came from the side.

Li Mo looked up and saw a man with a face like a jade crown, dressed in white robes, quite handsome. Four of his five facial features were excellent, but he had a pair of triangular eyes, which made him look a bit sharp and mean.

The man was holding a water-jade-like long sword in his arms. Even through the scabbard, one could feel its sharpness.

He was not alone; an elder accompanied him, who looked quite amiable.

**[Name: Bai Jinghong.]**
**[Age: 24]**
**[Physique: Han Guang Sword Body (Sword Body of Contained Light)]**
**[Realm: Six Apertures of the Divine Perception Realm]**
**[Fate: Blue with a hint of Purple]**
**[Evaluation: Third席 (席席) of the Hengyun Sword City in Langya Prefecture. Having登上 (ascended) the Hidden Dragon List at 89th place at a young age, he is锋芒毕露 (sharp and aggressive), arrogant, and highly competitive.]**
**[Recent Encounters: Heard that Ying Bing斩杀 (slayed) a Divine Perception expert with her inner breath and has superior sword art. Hopes to use her to temper himself and find the Blood Phoenix Divine Perception Map within the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm.]**

Whether it was Hengyun Sword City or Bai Jinghong, their names were very prestigious.

As soon as he stepped in, he attracted countless flatteries, but he始终 (constantly) looked straight ahead, without even the interest to engage in superficial pleasantries.

Li Mo: "?"

How does everyone seem to have heard about Ying Bing slaying the Smiling Maitreya?

Who is the big-mouthed bastard?

*Achoo!*

Luo Yu suddenly sneezed.
