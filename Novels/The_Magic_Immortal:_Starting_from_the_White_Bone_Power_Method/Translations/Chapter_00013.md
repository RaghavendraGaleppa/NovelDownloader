# Chapter 13: Superior Grade Demon Bone

Wang Chan's hands had already withdrawn from the slender waist the moment the voice sounded outside. 

The waist was truly slender and soft—even through the soft armor, he could feel the gentle femininity. By the time the person entered, Wang Chan's hands were already a foot away from the delicate figure, laboriously channeling faint wisps of magic power with visible sweat on his forehead, appearing utterly dedicated.

"Mei'er, are you alright..." The newcomer spoke urgently, then suddenly noticed Wang Chan's hands and narrowed his eyes. But his expression quickly shifted to one of concern as he took the beauty mark woman's hand. "Is there anywhere else that still hurts?"

"Thanks to Physician Ning and Physician Wang's treatment, I've recovered quite a bit. My body was still stiff and cold earlier, but Fellow Daoist Wang's rejuvenation technique has warmed me up," the beauty mark woman replied calmly, though she seemed puzzled by the newcomer's presence. "Why are you here? The city must be busy..."

"Since Fellow Daoist Tian is no longer in discomfort, I shall take my leave. There are still several other patients awaiting treatment," Wang Chan said evenly, withdrawing his magic power with practiced ease.

The beauty mark woman, however, had shed her earlier languid charm, responding with a cold, aloof hum. 

The newcomer, despite being at the late Qi Refining stage, was surprisingly courteous. He smiled amiably and cupped his hands. "Thank you for your efforts, Physician Wang."

"It was my duty. You're too kind," Wang Chan returned the gesture before calmly exiting the room and gently closing the door behind him.

Outside, the two female guards were nowhere to be seen. 

In the courtyard, Ning Jingming was once again watching ants beneath the jujube tree. Seeing Wang Chan emerge, he didn't ask questions but simply had someone fetch two spirit coins, which he handed over personally. "Fellow Daoist Wang's medical skills are exceptional. That Rejuvenation Needle technique is truly remarkable. I may have to trouble you for assistance in the future."

Though the words might have been mere politeness, Wang Chan accepted the coins graciously and exchanged a few pleasantries before taking his leave.

He didn't relax until he had left the Black River Market and was well on his way home against the river's current. Only then did he exhale deeply, realizing his back was soaked with cold sweat.

*Thank goodness I'm a man of integrity and didn't undo that soft armor*, Wang Chan thought to himself. *That man must be her Dao companion—late Qi Refining stage, handsome, though still two notches below me...*

After running for a while longer, surrounded by towering ancient trees and the sound of rushing water, Wang Chan's tense nerves finally eased. His mind wandered back to the beauty mark woman's words.

"A low-grade Tiger Flood Dragon, yet possessing a superior-grade divine ability—it must have a superior-grade demon bone inside!"

A demon bone wasn't just any ordinary spirit bone from a demonic beast. It was the result of a beast's bloodline awakening into a divine ability, with the bone that bore the divine patterns and housed the power of that ability. Only such a bone could be called a demon bone.

These bones were imbued with spirituality, profound mysteries, and extraordinary spiritual power—extremely precious. They could be fused with a cultivator's spiritual roots to practice corresponding demonic techniques or used to craft exquisite magical artifacts, formations, talismans, puppets, and more. Their uses were vast.

The grade of a demon bone wasn't tied to the beast's cultivation level but rather to the quality of its bloodline. 

The bloodlines of demons, fiends, ghosts, and monsters were typically categorized as low, middle, high, or supreme grade, with rumors of even earth and heaven grades—much like the spiritual roots of human cultivators.

The Tiger Flood Dragon was already a rare high-grade bloodline, giving it a chance to awaken a superior-grade divine ability. And once it did, it would inevitably possess a superior-grade demon bone!

No wonder the Black River Market had no demon bones for sale—they were simply too rare. 

Especially a superior-grade demon bone. Without luck, one could search with a lantern and still not find it.

"If I could get my hands on one..."

The thought sent a surge of excitement through Wang Chan.

But that Tiger Flood Dragon, despite being only at the low-grade cultivation stage, had already awakened a superior-grade divine ability—proof of its extraordinary nature.

The mid-Qi Refining guards were formidable; any one of them could easily overpower a group of rogue cultivators. Yet the Tiger Flood Dragon had instantly killed four of them. If Wang Chan encountered it, he wouldn't even have a chance to flee—he'd be dead on the spot.

At the hour of Mao, before dawn.

The red-feathered spirit chicken raised by the voluptuous female cultivator in Lotus Mountain's Cave No. 48 crowed loudly.

Wang Chan rose at the sound, opening his eyes contentedly.

Cultivating was exhilarating—the flow of magic power through his body felt akin to those long phone calls with his long-distance ponytailed girlfriend back in his student days. Before he knew it, three hours had passed.

He had entered meditation at midnight and awakened at dawn—truly a night of immortal cultivation. 

Yet his body felt light, his mind clear, brimming with energy as if injected with chicken blood.

In his past life, staying up like this would've left him haggard, oily-haired, pimpled, and dark-eyed, stumbling to the bathroom only to piss on his feet—not to mention the risk of sudden death.

A glance at his dantian's magic power revealed... *Sigh.* After seven days of diligent cultivation for three hours daily, supplemented by a bottle of Foundation Nurturing Spirit Liquid, he had only produced two and a bit strands of magic power.

It took 108 strands to form a single current. The road ahead was long.

As he pondered, virtual text appeared before his eyes:

**[Daily cultivation for three hours: Experience +1]**

With a thought:

**[Minor Withering-Bliss Needle Artifact Restriction +1]**

A mysterious force made the needle case on the table tremble. Wang Chan flicked his sleeve, and a three-inch silver needle flew before him with a hum.

Connecting his divine sense to the artifact restriction, he peered into the needle's interior. Twenty intertwined green-and-yellow restriction patterns writhed like coiling dragons, flickering between vitality and decay.

Perhaps due to the twenty layers of restrictions, the needle felt heavier despite its unchanged appearance, its tip so sharp it was almost blinding.

"Twenty layers—just one short of completion. If I set up a stall now, I'd qualify for a proper shopfront... Since it's still dark, why not test its power?"

Wang Chan linked his divine sense to a silver needle, channeling three strands of magic power into it. The needle flashed like cold light, embedding itself into the far wall without a sound.

*Faster. Quieter.*

He was pleased.

Second needle.

Third needle.

Fourth needle.

...

By the ninth needle, Wang Chan suddenly collapsed onto the meditation mat with a groan, his face pale. His dantian was empty—all twenty-four strands of magic power exhausted in an instant, leaving him unable to summon the ninth Minor Withering-Bliss Needle.

He had even devised a set of techniques based on the needle's properties: "Three-Needle Seal," "Five-Needle Seal," and "Nine-Needle Seal." But in his excitement, he'd forgotten about his limited magic power.

"At the end of the day, it's my cultivation technique holding me back."

A non-grade technique required three strands of magic power to activate a low-grade magical artifact, whereas a low-grade technique needed only one. This was the gap between cultivation methods.

The higher the grade of a technique, the purer, denser, and more potent the magic power it produced.

According to the texts, even among graded techniques, the differences were significant.

Generally, one strand of mid-grade magic power was equivalent to three strands of low-grade, one of high-grade to six, and one of supreme-grade to nine.

By full daylight, Wang Chan's magic power had mostly recovered. A thick bowl of spirit rice porridge with braised green lamb and his homemade pickled cloud cabbage would restore him completely.

After stuffing a thick log of spirit wood into the stove and stoking the flames, he grabbed a broom to tidy the courtyard.

Over the past few days, he had developed a habit of cleaning the yard and tending to the plants each morning. He'd even bought large jade vases and pots, arranging flowers and盆栽 to brighten the space.

*Opportunities are self-made. Who knows? Maybe one day, someone will ask me to mop the floor and then inquire if I can arrange flowers.*

But as soon as he opened the door, a bloodstained white robe fluttered from the crooked old tree in the yard, reeking of ghostly malice. The stench of blood hit him like a wave, prompting Wang Chan to instinctively flick three Minor Withering-Bliss Needles from his sleeve.
