# Chapter 625: Stone Creek Town

The pursuit of the True Lord of Primordial Origin and the other True Lords of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm would surely be attracted like moths to a flame.

That was the true path to death.

Now,身处 a foreign world, he dared not use it even more.

After all, he still did not know the true strength of the gods in this clearly major world of Aitira.

If he were to be exposed carelessly, he might be beaten to death by a mob.

That would not do.

As for the pursuer, True Lord Qingyuan.

He was the true scourge in his heart!

This man was a Golden Core cultivator, mastered the Wondrous Dao Method of Primordial Qi, and had cultivated the protective Clear Qi of an Immortal Palace.

Once he unfolded his Cavern Heaven, its power would be peerless. Even if injured, as long as he caught his breath and followed the spatial trail of the Void Crossing Boat into the Sea of Worlds, it would only be a matter of time before he found this place with his understanding of the void and his lock on Xu Yunfan's aura.

It恐怕 would not be long.

He had to think of a way to see if there was anything in this world that could trap the other party.

As for seeking the Golden Core Dao Fruit in this world, Xu Yunfan had not even considered it.

The True Scripture he cultivated pointed to a fruit position in the Taihua Spirit Void Realm.

He could not possibly prove it here.

However, a major world would surely contain a vast amount of opportunities, and he would not easily give up on them.

The cave dwelling was in utter silence.

Xu Yunfan quietly adjusted his breathing, circulating the *Xuanqiao Nine宸 Immortal Void Indestructible True Scripture*, extremely slowly absorbing the chaotic energy of the external world. He meticulously avoided the violent Chaos Factors within, slowly repairing his nearly collapsed body.

"Ultimately..."

He slowly opened his eyes, gazing at the dim restrictive array at the cave entrance. After a good while, he glanced at the Star Spirit Banner standing beside him and could not help but mutter to himself with a hint of imperceptible self-mockery.

"It has been stained by the filthy colors of the Primordial Origin Sect."

The ambitious and enterprising martial arts prodigy of the Divine Martial Realm, Xu Yunfan, had long since drifted away amidst the intrigues of the Primordial Origin Sect and countless life-and-death battles.

On this path of cultivation, survival was the only thing that mattered.

To become stronger, to become stronger as quickly as possible.

Otherwise, when True Lord Qingyuan tracked him down, the only thing awaiting him would be the utter annihilation of body and soul.

This tribulation would likely be ten thousand times more dangerous than facing Ye Yuan's Sun-Ending Unreturnable Dao Fruit.

He retracted his thoughts and once again immersed himself in the arduous process of healing and recovery.

Three months later.

In a small town named Stone Creek Town.

Xu Yunfan walked slowly through the streets. The town had a population of no more than thirty thousand, and there were few adventurers wearing armor and carrying weapons on the streets.

Having recovered to his peak state, he had set foot in a border town called Stone Creek on the Aitira continent.

The set of clothes he wore, which were completely incongruent with the surrounding environment and had unfamiliar materials and tailoring—more like a simple dark combat suit than the common linen or luxurious silk robes of this world—immediately drew the attention of the commoners, both overt and covert.

Whispers passed under eaves and at alley corners, mingling curiosity with a hint of vigilance.

"Look at that outfit, never seen it before."

"Like a mage, Lord? But where is the mage tower's emblem?"

"Shh! Don't point, be careful of causing trouble! Mage Lords are unpredictable."

"He looks young, but can an ordinary man walk these desolate roads alone?"

"His eyes are so bright..."

Though the whispers were light, they fell clearly on Xu Yunfan's ears.

He paid them no mind, his steps steady as he walked along the main road paved with cobblestones.

Surprisingly, from those hushed words, what he caught was not entirely rejection or simple curiosity, but more a kind of awe ingrained in the marrow of this world, almost instinctual.

The gazes cast upon him, especially after seeing his calm gait and composed demeanor, saw the component of awe quickly overshadow curiosity.

He passed through the town's somewhat shabby streets.

The low and crowded wooden and stone houses were stained with marks of wind and rain, and the air was mixed with the smells of livestock, hay, and cooking smoke.

Most pedestrians wore coarse clothes that had been washed to a pale white, their movements carrying the unique caution and toil of a small place.

However, when his gaze fell upon the town center, a clearly planned area, a completely different scene came into view.

It was a towering building.

The Temple of Dilys.

Although its scale could not compare to the great cathedrals of light in the cities within the knight's memories, its magnificent and solemn appearance stood out particularly against the surrounding lowly commoners' houses, like a pearl set upon a coarse linen robe.

The entire church was built from polished white veined stone, each piece fitting perfectly, radiating a soft and holy glow in the afternoon sun.

The Gothic spires soared high, pointing towards the clouds, as if silently proclaiming the majesty of the deity.

The huge rose window was inlaid with colored glass, faintly visible through which were intricate and exquisite patterns.

The main door was carved with countless small bas-reliefs of angels holding musical instruments, their postures varied and lifelike.

The stone steps in front of the door, swept spotless, were as bright as a mirror, forming a sarcastic contrast with the muddy soil of the alleys.

This magnificent building, which had consumed most of the savings of the town's believers and might have made their lives even more difficult, was built to worship a rather unremarkable existence within the vast Aitira pantheon.

The God of Song and Listening, Dilys.

This name was almost unheard of in the vast world of Aitira.

Born only a thousand years ago, in the eyes of gods who could trace their origins back to the very beginning of heaven and earth, she was as tender as a toddler.

Her believers were mostly concentrated in this region, limited in number, and her influence was confined to protecting this corner of the land with good weather, soothing the emotions of the populace, and listening to some trivial troubles.

For the countless beings of Aitira, the name "Dilys" had perhaps never even appeared in their consciousness.

To track down these insignificant minor deities and their places of worship, Xu Yunfan had spent many days meticulously sorting through vast volumes of records and mixed streams of information before finally locking onto this border town named Stone Creek.

After all, disturbing these unremarkable minor deities would not cause much of an impact.

The heavy oak doors opened silently, and a scent of heavy sandalwood mixed with the cold, crisp scent of stone rushed towards him.

The interior of the church was far more spacious than it appeared from the outside.

The space was tall, and sunlight filtered through the high stained-glass windows, casting mottled and magnificent light and shadow on the ground.

A few rows of benches were sparsely scattered about, currently empty.

Except for an elderly deacon dozing by the entrance, the entire hall was strangely quiet, with only his footsteps creating a slight echo in the stone walls.

His gaze hardly lingered on the surrounding furnishings, going straight to the altar.

There, enshrined was a life-sized stone statue of the goddess.

The statue was carved from a pure white, jade-like stone, with craftsmanship so exquisite it was breathtaking. Every detail was filled with the believers' devotion and the artisan's ingenuity.

The statue was of a female figure.

She had a slender and graceful figure, an elegant demeanor, and wore a strangely styled long dress that clung to her beautiful curves. The hem of the skirt rippled like water. Though it was stone, it seemed to have been endowed with a sense of flowing rhythm.
