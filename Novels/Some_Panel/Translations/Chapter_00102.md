# Chapter 101: The Edible Divine Sprout, Yang Ji's Confidence

Yang Ji looked at her, his expression shifting, and suddenly asked, "You possess your main body's memories?"

"I have some, but not all. I remember my main body being pulled away by a bad guy. Hmph, I'll definitely get revenge for that," the Divine Sprout huffed twice. Suddenly, a rumbling sound came from her small belly, and her fierce little face immediately crumpled. She looked up, her watery eyes sparkling with hungry tears, gazing piteously at Yang Ji.

Yang Ji cleared his throat and handed her a spiritual fruit. "Use this to tide you over for now. I'll get you something delicious later." With that, he moved her out of his dantian.

The moment she arrived in the Mountain and Sea World, the Divine Sprout's eyes widened. She cried out, "So many delicious things! I don't want to eat this!" She threw away the half spiritual fruit in her hand and, with cheerful little steps, dashed towards a mountain peak. A flash of green light emanated from her, and any plants and trees it swept over immediately withered, their wood-attribute essence instantly absorbed. Although the Divine Sprout wasn't tall, her steps seemed to possess the ability to shrink the ground into an inch. In just a single breath, more than half of the mountain peak was completely absorbed by her. The once verdant and beautiful immortal mountain instantly became bald.

Yang Ji was stunned and quickly shouted, "You can't eat those!"

"I eat, eat, eat! Why can't I eat them?" The Divine Sprout completely ignored him, her feet flailing, green light sweeping wildly, and large swaths of trees withered. In just three breaths, a massive immortal mountain, originally lush with flowers, grass, and trees, was instantly sucked dry of all greenery. Even its roots suffered, transforming it into a dead mountain. Such a method was comparable to a Great Divine Ability. Yang Ji was left speechless, never imagining this tiny Divine Sprout to be so formidable, truly a bane to all flora.

Seeing her float towards the only remaining immortal mountain in the Mountain and Sea World, Yang Ji's eye twitched. He immediately activated his teleportation ability, appearing swiftly in front of her. With a pained expression, he said, "Little Divine Sprout, this is our own territory. We can't just wreck it casually. We'll still need to live here in the future." The Mountain and Sea World was still growing, and she had already ruined one of its only two spiritual qi-shrouded, well-structured immortal mountains. How could Yang Ji not feel heartache? If the other mountain were also sucked dry, the Mountain and Sea World would lose its spiritual essence, becoming no different from the mundane world outside.

"Our own territory?" The Divine Sprout's small eyes glanced at the immortal mountain, then at Yang Ji's pained expression. She reluctantly licked her lips, still unsatisfied, and retracted her green light. "But I'm still hungry."

"You're still hungry?" Yang Ji pondered for a moment, then said, "I'll take you outside to eat two more mountains. But it's dangerous outside, so you must promise me not to leave my sleeve. If you're discovered by bad people, you might be captured just like your main body was."

"Okay, I promise," the Divine Sprout nodded obediently and burrowed into Yang Ji's sleeve.

Yang Ji glanced at his sleeve, and with a flash of spiritual light, he exited the Mountain and Sea World and appeared in his main hall. With Dao Peak as the center, an area of fifty li around it was his territory, containing many mountain peaks. Due to the rich spiritual qi within the Wuji Sect, all kinds of plants and trees flourished, with a denser plant-attribute energy. Even if they were sucked dry, they would recover within a short time under the nourishment of the abundant spiritual qi. Yang Ji instructed the Divine Sprout not to destroy the roots of trees and grass, and then he took her towards a nearby mountain peak.

As he flew, the Divine Sprout hidden in his sleeve happily danced and waved her hands, continuously sweeping out green light to absorb the essence of plants and trees. In just ten breaths, Yang Ji selectively guided her to absorb the plant essence from three mountain peaks. Seeing the Divine Sprout's slightly satisfied expression, Yang Ji then took her away.

However, halfway there, a service disciple who cultivated the Wood Emperor Art and was using a wood-attribute spell to cultivate spiritual saplings caught the Divine Sprout's attention. "Oh, the spiritual light he's emitting looks very delicious!" She opened her mouth and sucked from a distance. The spiritual light the disciple had just unleashed was immediately sucked into her mouth. Her eyes lit up, and she sucked again, even drawing out the Wood Emperor spiritual power from the disciple's dantian. The disciple screamed on the spot, his foundation almost ruined. Fortunately, Yang Ji noticed in time and covered the Divine Sprout's mouth, saving him from disaster. After glaring at the Divine Sprout, Yang Ji flicked out a bottle of Nine-Revolutions Golden Elixir to compensate the disciple for his loss. He hadn't expected that besides eating mountains, this Divine Sprout could also absorb wood-attribute spiritual power from others' bodies. Truly, anything related to "wood-attribute" was fair game for her to devour.

"Next time, you can't swallow others' spiritual power without my permission, understand?" Yang Ji flicked her little forehead, admonishing her sternly.

"Oh, alright, alright," the Divine Sprout缩 her neck and stuck out her tongue.

"I rely on! Honored Master, when did you cultivate such an evil spell? You're even more demonic than me, not only eating mountains but even sucking away people's cultivation!" Fo Tong, who had observed this from afar, flew over on a crane and exclaimed in surprise.

"Who's that little brat? He actually says I cultivate demonic arts. Hmph, those Outer Realm Demons' techniques are far more evil than mine!" The Divine Sprout glared unpleasantly at Fo Tong, but she obediently stayed in Yang Ji's sleeve, only transmitting her complaints to him.

"Outer Realm Demons? Were there demons when you were born?" Yang Ji ignored Fo Tong and transmitted a message to the Divine Sprout.

"Yes, there were! Those demons were so annoying. They'd steal the fruits from my body and eat the people under my tree. Especially that guy called Guangu Demon Lord, he was particularly brutal. He wreaked havoc in my world, countless living beings suffered under his poisonous maw, and in the end, I drove him away," the Divine Sprout said with resentment.

"Is the history of these demons really that ancient? The books record that demons are the most ancient race, beings from the same era as the oldest Immortal Kings in the Immortal Realm. Could it be true?" Yang Ji pondered.

"Hey, Honored Master, why are you ignoring me?" Seeing Yang Ji leave, Fo Tong couldn't help but jump up from the crane's back and shout.

Yang Ji did not return to the main hall, but instead went to the Myriad Worlds Merchant Alliance in Wuji City. With the spiritual fruits produced by the Divine Sprout as his "backing," Yang Ji spoke with immense confidence this time, declaring boldly, "Bring me all the wood-attribute spiritual items! I want them all!" Bai Bi'er merely looked at him in surprise, then smiled slightly and readily produced all the wood-attribute spiritual items she had collected over the years.

Yang Ji thanked her gratefully, then returned to the Wuji Dao Sect. These spiritual items would be enough to feed the Divine Sprout for several years. He also prepared to enter seclusion once more, devoting himself to comprehending spells and making full preparations for the second assessment task.

Days passed by like this.

Two years later.

Chong Yuan and the others also successively broke through to the Nascent Soul stage. They became inner disciples, all qualified to possess an immortal mountain. However, they did not leave, still cultivating on Yang Ji's Dao Peak. Over these years, Fo Tong had also become increasingly extraordinary. Golden light would occasionally shimmer around him, and demonic qi would sometimes surge. This fellow was becoming more and more remarkable, having silently broken through to the Golden Core peak. Although Yang Ji was cultivating within the Mountain and Sea Realm, he constantly released his powerful divine sense to perceive everything on Dao Peak, keeping all of their movements well within his grasp.
