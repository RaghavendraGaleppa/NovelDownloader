Chapter 165: Hehe, I Won This Time

In the courtyard of Autumn Water Pavilion.

The morning wind blew, leaves rustled softly. The ancient tree that had stood in the courtyard for countless years seemed to be watching the young man and woman below with great interest.

"Are we discussing the Dao, or are we sparring?" Li Mo asked with a smile, sword in hand.

"Either is fine," Ying Bing replied. Her slender fingers gripping the sword handle turned slightly white. She just wanted to start quickly.

Li Mo raised an eyebrow.

It seemed the Ice Cube had made new progress in the Way of the Sword and had come to verify it with him.

In that case, he needed to get serious.

"Let's call it a spar then."

"Since that's the case, let's begin..."

"Wait."

"Huh?"

Ying Bing let out a soft breath, and the aura she had just gathered stagnated.

Li Mo chuckled. "Since it's a spar, why don't we add a little wager? Like a reward of some sort..."

He vividly remembered how the Ice Cube used to teach him swordplay. If he made a single mistake, she would spank him!

The trauma to his backside was still fresh in Little Li's memory!

*I will take back what I lost with my own hands!*

Little Li's competitive spirit flared up.

*A reward...*

Ying Bing bit her lip lightly. She really didn't want to hear those two words right now!

"Alright!"

The word and the Frost Sword arrived simultaneously.

The moment the sword was drawn, all sound ceased. The domineering sword intent enveloped Autumn Water Pavilion, becoming the sole existence in this small world.

Li Mo's mind trembled slightly.

It was a sword technique he had never seen before.

With his current insight, he could naturally tell that this sword technique was of an extremely high grade!

"Where did the Ice Cube learn this?"

Li Mo didn't dwell on the question too much.

He recalled the general principles of the *Solitary Nine Swords* and the "Sword-Breaking Form" within it, moving his body in accordance with his sword.

But, how to put it.

This sword technique was still too difficult for him...

"Huh?"

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

How had Li Mo's swordsmanship suddenly dropped so much? It was chaotic, devoid of intent, completely opposite to yesterday's level.

*Clang, clang, clang—*

The long swords collided.

Almost instantly, the Chixiao Sword showed signs of defeat.

Neither of them used anything other than sword techniques.

Li Mo certainly couldn't pull out a hammer to turn the tide; he could only parry clumsily, barely holding on.

But Little Li hadn't been suppressed for nothing.

He could now use his martial arts insights while attacking.

*Martial arts insights, activate!*

**[Twenty years of martial arts insights injected successfully.]**

**[Year 1: You strive to memorize and comprehend the general principles of the *Solitary Nine Swords*.]**

**[Year 7: You realize that the true meaning you once saw was the sword path born from the Sword Demon, after defeating all living beings, using a mortal body that had never absorbed the world's spiritual energy to pursue the "missing one" of the Dao and play a game against the heavens.]**

**[Year 12: You remain confused about this sword technique. You realize your understanding of the Way of the Sword is still too shallow.]**

**[Year 20: You recall the scene of sparring with Ying Bing and feel a sudden inspiration, as if a glimmer of light has appeared.]**

Tears streamed down Little Li's face.

Twenty years.

Not even a splash.

This was only possible because after achieving the Observation of the Soul, his will and soul were sharp, and sparring with the Ice Cube brought this result.

Otherwise, this insight would have been completely useless, like learning to paint.

"Again!"

Li Mo summarized his insights from the moment.

This time, his swordsmanship became even more chaotic.

The superior sword techniques and ultimate arts he had learned in the past seemed to be unusable now.

Actually.

It wouldn't be useful even if he could use them.

Under the Ice Cube's heaven-shaking, domineering Frost Sword, even the *Sun Wheel Sword Canon* would be crushed.

*Clang—*

*Clang—*

*Clang—*

Li Mo's hand holding the Chixiao Sword went slightly numb.

This was terrifying!

His Extreme Weapon Killing Body was no joke.

To be able to震 him like this just showed how terrifying the Ice Cube's sword was!

*Slap—*

Suddenly, Little Li's sword defense was breached.

The Frost Sword reached in and slapped his butt.

---

Li Mo: "?!?"

Folks.

This is a bit infuriating, I have to say.

"Let's stop here for today," Ying Bing said calmly as she withdrew her sword.

She had more or less familiarized herself with the first form of the *Divine Sky Heart Sword*; with a little polishing later, she would have mastered it completely.

And...

She really... really couldn't continue.

That strange feeling hadn't disappeared just because she was practicing her sword seriously. It was like a parasite... to the point where it almost shook her domineering sword intent.

"It's not over yet!"

Little Li spent another twenty years of martial arts insights.

Getting spanked again? Does our Little Li have no dignity to speak of?

If he remembers this不堪回首 past every time he picks up a sword, how can he be a handsome and dashing swordsman!

He must reclaim his honor!

*Swish—*

Li Mo raised his sword again, still unstructured and very chaotic.

"This sword..."

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

At first glance, his attack looked like an amateur swinging wildly.

But something very strange happened.

Despite being completely unstructured, it suddenly and abruptly found a flaw she hadn't even noticed herself.

*Clang—*

This sword actually stopped the domineering Frost Sword.

Ying Bing's swordsmanship was extremely seasoned; she changed her move without thinking.

However, the moment she changed her stance, the weakness of the Frost Sword happened to撞 right onto the tip of the Chixiao Sword.

It was as if she had主动ly offered her flaw.

"This... could it be..."

A thought suddenly arose in Ying Bing's heart.

This feels like... the taste of "skill approaching the Dao"?

Every sword strike was simple, neither continuous nor formal, and couldn't even be called using a sword technique!

But it just happened to find her weakest spot...

Opposite her.

Li Mo felt it was about time.

**[Congratulations, Host, thirty years of martial arts insights injected successfully!]**

**[Year 1: You analyze that glimmer of inspiration and integrate it into yourself. The countless sword techniques you have learned in the past all appear in your mind.]**

**[Year 8: The process of sparring with countless opponents in the past becomes clear to you. You can even play against them in your mind.]**

...

**[Year 30: You have finally found a way to grasp that 'one'.]**

**[Thirty years of martial arts insights consumed. Your *Solitary Nine Swords* has reached入门 (Entry Level).]**

Li Mo's gaze sharpened.

At this moment, Ying Bing, with her clothes fluttering and graceful figure, had her weakness exposed to him.

The Ice Cube had a fatal flaw!

His mind was now empty of all distractions, his entire focus on the sword and that 'one'.

*Zheng!*

The terrifying sword intent of the Frost Sword suddenly stagnated.

Ying Bing's neck turned slightly red.

He actually... actually wanted to learn from her!

That place right now... was indeed her biggest flaw.

She suddenly unleashed the second form of the *Divine Sky Heart Sword*.

The Frost Sword, after its sword intent stagnated, suddenly exploded with all its power.

"Drop it!"

Ying Bing's eyes seemed both calm and annoyed.

The sword light exploded completely.

*Slap—*

The Chixiao Sword did indeed fly out of his hand, along with the Frost Sword.

Normally, the spar would end here. Two swordsmen without swords—what's the point of sparring?

But this time was different.

The *Solitary Nine Swords* isn't entirely bound by the sword.

Moreover, this sword technique only attacks, never defends; it is entirely offensive!

Attack is the best defense!

No sword? We still have hands!

Straight for that 'one'!

*Slap—*

This sound.

Was very crisp.

The two figures overlapped.

Ying Bing suddenly froze, her eyelashes trembling.

The air seemed to solidify.

Li Mo, still unaware, opened his eyes and smiled:

"Hehe, I won this time~"
