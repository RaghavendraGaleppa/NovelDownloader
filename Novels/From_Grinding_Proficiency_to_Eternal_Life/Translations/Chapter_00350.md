# Chapter 350: Suffering and Calamity Are Silenced

The ripples on the surface of the flying hammer writhed as if alive. A dark golden true energy condensed at the hammer's head, forming the shadow of a ferocious giant whale. Its mouth gaped wide, as if it intended to swallow every obstacle in its path.

With every inch the hammer advanced, the true energy enveloping it underwent a change. At first, it was like boiling flames, then it seemed to freeze into frost, and finally, it transformed into a spiraling vortex of air. The low howl began like rolling thunder; by the time the hammer reached the midpoint of its trajectory, it had become a deafening roar that shook the spirit-suppressing jade pillars surrounding the training stage.

This hammer strike was no longer the work of human strength; it was as if a meteor from beyond the heavens, carrying ten distinct forces of heaven and earth, was determined to pulverize the enemy ahead along with the entire space!

*Bang!*

Cien's Dragon Suppression Seal was struck squarely by the flying hammer. This supreme treasure bestowed by the Empress exploded into a cloud of jade dust on the spot. The backlash sent blood spurting from Cien's seven orifices.

Even more terrifying was that the hammer's momentum did not cease; it actually smashed the spectator stands thirty zhang away into rubble!

"Demon!"

Ciku struggled to swing his blade, igniting a ghostly green flame that burned his own life essence blood. This strike had transcended the realm of martial arts. Before the blade's edge even reached him, the shadow beneath Xu Yunfan's feet began to twist on its own, as if it were about to be torn apart by the blade's intent.

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan's eyes. The muscles on his right arm suddenly tensed. The Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer in his hand hummed and trembled as the power of the earth's veins burst forth layer by layer, turning into black light that rippled across the surface of the heavy hammer. Facing Ciku's Black Yin Soul-Slaying Blade, he did not dodge. Instead, he sank his waist and steadied his stance. The Ten Extremes true energy surged out of his body like a raging tide, pouring entirely into the hammer!

"Mountain Stabilizing Ocean, Sea and Sky on the Horizon!"

Under the impact of the violent true energy, the twelve cloud patterns on the hammer head actually emitted a piercing sound of metal distortion, as if they were being pried apart by an invisible giant hand. The cloud patterns were not merely split; under Xu Yunfan's brute force capable of splitting mountains and cracking peaks, they were transformed into the ultimate sharpness!

This attack contained no tricks; it was purely the absolute force that violently altered the structure of the Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer. The hammer was no longer a hammer; under Xu Yunfan's terrifying strength, it had transformed into a fierce weapon capable of grinding everything to dust!

The moment the blade wheel collided with the demon blade, Ciku realized with horror that what he had struck seemed to be a bottomless abyss. The Nine Nether Ghost Fire attached to his blade was melted away like residual snow by the mountain-suppressing, ocean-stabilizing force of the heavy hammer. The terrifying force unleashed vibrated with a terrifying frequency; with every collision, the old monk's tiger's mouth split open a little more.

*Crack!*

A teeth-grating shattering sound echoed through the entire arena. The Black Yin Soul-Slaying Blade snapped into three pieces. Ciku's right arm and half of his shoulder were turned into a mist of blood by the绞杀 of the blade wheel. As the old monk stumbled backward, he saw Xu Yunfan raising the retrieved Mountain Stabilizing Ocean Hammer high. The Gang Qi condensed at the hammer's head had materialized into the shadow of a mountain.

The first hammer!

The hammer fell like a meteor crashing to the earth. The Diamond Seal Ciku hastily raised to block it shattered like paper. The muffled sound of his chest cavity collapsing made the spectators in the front row change color.

The second hammer!

The left hammer, returning in a spin, struck Cunan's Heavenly Spirit Cover. This monk, who cultivated the Vajra Body, didn't even let out a scream. His head burst open like a watermelon, and his headless body collapsed to its knees, still maintaining the hand seal.

The instant Cien turned to flee, Xu Yunfan had already unslung the Void-Piercing Cloud-Piercing Bow slung across his shoulder. He didn't even take an arrow. He simply drew the bow into a full moon shape. Under the疯狂 pouring of the Ten Extremes true energy, a three-edged, armor-piercing arrow formed at his fingertips.

The sight made the hearts of everyone below the stage tremble.

"Condensed Qi into Form!?"

The Daoist in the green robe from the Xuanzhen Sect trembled slightly, his lips trembling with disbelief. He stared fixedly at the true energy flowing around Xu Yunfan. It was no longer the invisible Gang Qi driven by a typical ninth-level Qi-refining practitioner, but a near-substantial existence. Having reached the stage of Condensed Qi into Form, true energy could now form its own martial arts phase. At times it was like rising flames, at times like freezing frost, and it could even transform into the shadow of a dragon or a sword in an instant. It was condensed and unyielding, as if it were alive!

This was the realm of "Condensed Qi into Form" that only a ninth-level Qi-refining Grandmaster could touch!

For ordinary martial artists, even if they stepped into the ninth level and transformed their劲 into true energy, their true energy would merely be more abundant and sharper. But Xu Yunfan had already transcended this category. His Ten Extremes true energy seemed to possess a spirit of its own; without the need for deliberate control, it could spontaneously evolve into various forms. Every strand of true energy was as flexible as his own limbs, capable of being both hard and soft. When hard, it was comparable to divine weapons and sharp blades; when soft, it was like water, seeping into every crack.

What was even more terrifying was that these formed true energies were not merely for show. The Daoist in the green robe was horrified to realize that the experts from the five major sects around him, with their discerning eyes, could naturally see this too, and their expressions carried a hint of shock. They subconsciously exchanged glances, their hearts heavy. From ancient times to the present, those who have reached "Condensed Qi into Form" have all been dazzling geniuses. This realm meant that the martial artist's control over true energy had reached a consummate level; every movement possessed immense power. Facing such a being, a typical ninth-level expert was like a child holding a wooden sword against a veteran soldier; they were not on the same level at all!

What made his hair stand on end even more was that within Xu Yunfan's formed true energy, ten distinct martial arts flowed faintly. He could even see the shadow of the Xuanzhen Sect's Dragon and Tiger Pill Qi. This was clearly the "Ten Thousand Laws Return to the Source" phenomenon that could only be displayed after pushing the Ten Extremes martial path to its ultimate limit!

"Solitary Nine..."

The Daoist in the green robe from the Xuanzhen Sect had an exceptionally unsightly expression. The tall envoy from the Penglai Pavilion also subconsciously shrank further into his cloak.

*Twang!*

The sound of the bowstring vibrating caused all fragile objects within a hundred zhang to shatter simultaneously. The moment the true energy arrow left the string, the air was plowed into a vacuum channel visible to the naked eye. Cien, who had just leaped into the air, suddenly froze. A bowl-sized transparent hole appeared in his chest. The lingering force of the arrow actually collapsed half of the imperial city's corner tower three hundred paces away!

The spectator stands were as silent as a tomb. The Yellow and Black chains that had trapped Xu Yunfan suddenly turned illusory. He sucked them back into his body, replenishing the Ten Extremes true energy he had just consumed while simultaneously increasing his total amount of Ten Extremes true energy by another notch. The Nine Nether Cold Iron Chain in the hand of the Penglai Pavilion envoy had unknowingly broken into several pieces. This well-informed envoy was now chattering his teeth. That was not archery; it was the ultimate violence born from true energy condensed to its absolute limit!

As the dust settled, Xu Yunfan stood with one foot on the fragment of the Dragon Suppression Seal, holding his twin hammers倒提, dripping with blood. He swept his gaze over the crowd who were as silent as cicadas in winter, and suddenly let out a light laugh: "Is there anyone else who wishes to discuss the 'Trinity'?"

His voice was not loud, yet it made the nearby monitoring bronze bell resonate on its own.

As he spoke, Xu Yunfan glanced at the few information prompts that had popped up in his vision.

'You have successfully slain the Suffering, Calamity, and Difficulty monks. Your Ten Extremes martial path has deepened further...'

Xu Yunfan looked at it with some helplessness in his heart. Although the Ten Extremes martial path follows the path of Ten Thousand Laws Return to the Source, there is still no good method for circulating qi after the ninth level. It is just a matter of repeatedly using true energy to wash the body, allowing the body to grow to the extreme, and then using the most primitive method of the physical body to nourish the growth of the spirit.

Although the martial path has methods for condensing the spirit, it cannot strengthen the soul or improve mental acuity. This point is enough to show just how precious the Spirit-Commanding Mantra is.
