**Chapter 100: I Am a Divine Sapling of Heaven and Earth, Let's Call Me Shen Yin**

"Senior Brother, the jade slip contains both divine abilities and some insights I gained during my cultivation."

"If these two divine abilities are mastered, Senior Brother's chance of becoming a true disciple will increase by thirty percent," Yang Ji said slowly.

"Increase by thirty percent?" Li Changxiao's expression grew serious. "Without becoming a true disciple, everything is fleeting. One won't receive the sect's full cultivation, nor gain access to advanced cultivation techniques and immortal arts. Since the divine abilities Junior Brother gave me can increase my chances by thirty percent, this time cannot be wasted. I will return to seclusion immediately to comprehend their mysteries, hoping to fully grasp them soon. If my strength increases by even a bit, I believe my chances of passing the third assessment will also be greater," Li Changxiao stated.

"Alright, Senior Brother, you should go back to your seclusion," Yang Ji nodded.

"Junior Brother, if anything happens, you can leave me a message through the Myriad Treasure Mirror. I check it once every three years," Li Changxiao said, slowly rising.

"Understood, Senior Brother." Yang Ji also slowly stood up. The two senior and junior brothers didn't exchange many pleasantries before walking out of the main hall.

After watching Li Changxiao depart, Yang Ji then took out two jade slips from behind his back, a faint smile on his face, and walked into the main hall.

The latter four stances of the Returning Sword Art arrived at just the right time. He had originally intended to claim them after passing the second assessment, but unexpectedly, his Senior Brother delivered them to him. The sect actually does not prohibit such acts of bestowing techniques. The path of cultivation emphasizes human connections, fortune, and karma. If someone bestows a divine ability upon you, that is a testament to your capability and fortune. The sect will not forbid such things. Even if you take the cultivation techniques and divine abilities learned from the Dao Sect to establish your own sect outside and spread the teachings, the sect will not hold you accountable. If you cultivate excellent disciples and send them to the Dao Sect, there will even be rewards. The Dao Sect's grand magnanimity echoes the saying, "Under all heaven, nothing is not the King's land; to the borders of the land, no one is not the King's subject." A vast Dao lineage spreading its branches and leaves, with disciples and grand-disciples coming to pay homage, flourishing in popularity—this is a symbol of profound destiny. The Dao Sect would not do anything to stifle destiny.

Of course, these divine abilities and techniques are not core ones. If they were the sect-guarding immortal arts and cultivation techniques, they could not be easily acquired or transmitted; those would be subject to restrictions. This is an unwritten rule among the major sects. If one presumes to transmit or learn the sect's immortal arts without permission, they will be punished. Matters involving the sect's foundation will undoubtedly draw the intervention of Tribulation Immortals, bringing about thunder, lightning, and earth-shattering power. Although the Returning Sword Art is powerful, it is not a core technique and can be freely taught.

Furthermore, the arrival of that soul-attacking divine ability also brought Yang Ji joy. He had cultivated the Humanoid Weapon, making his soul far stronger than others at the same level. If he mastered this technique, it would be like a tiger growing sharp fangs, its true ferocity fully revealed.

Inside the Mountain and Sea Pearl, Yang Ji didn't hesitate. He immediately took out the jade slip containing the Returning Sword Art. His divine sense probed into it, comprehending the mysteries of these latter four sword stances.

Three days later, he had already largely grasped the fundamental profound meanings of these four sword stances.

**Kan Sword Dao**: 'Kan' represents all water under heaven. The sword momentum is like rivers, seas, lakes, and waterfalls. This stance perfectly embodies the profound truth of "the weak overcoming the strong, the soft overcoming the hard."

**Gen Sword Dao**: 'Gen' represents mountains. Thus, Gen Sword Dao is majestic, grand, and magnificent. This stance is often used in conjunction with the 'Dui Sword Dao' and can often unleash terrifying power.

**Kun Sword Dao**: 'Kun' represents the earth. Therefore, Kun Sword Dao is profound, solid, and heavy, making it an extremely formidable defensive and suppressive sword art.

**Qian Sword Dao**: This sword dao is complex and ever-changing, serving as the foremost among the Eight Returning Swords. Qian represents heaven. Its sword momentum is lofty and distant, like eternal clouds, ethereal and boundless. Qian Sword Dao encompasses celestial phenomena, with nine major sword postures. Each major posture contains nine intermediate postures, and each intermediate posture contains nine minor postures, interlinking endlessly, turning in all directions, reaching the heavens, and stretching across eternity.

These four sword stances, along with the other Zhen Sword Dao, Xun Sword Dao, Li Sword Dao, and Dui Sword Dao, can merge into a single sword, named the Returning Sword. Once this sword is unleashed, the eight sword daos mutually generate and evolve, transforming into myriad phenomena, their power boundless.

After familiarizing himself with the fundamental profound meanings of these four sword daos, Yang Ji put it down and extended his divine sense into the second jade slip. Streams of profound mysteries surged forth. The name of the technique appeared in the form of runes— 'Yin-Yang Sundering Awareness'.

Five days later, Yang Ji generally understood the fundamental profound meaning of this technique. This technique possessed immense power, was mysteriously eerie, could kill invisibly, and with a mere glance, determine life or death. The inspiration for this technique came from the special scene of the setting sun and the rising crescent moon, both illuminating the sky simultaneously. This art is a cultivation method for the soul, subtly conforming to the Dao of Yin and Yang, having a Yang chapter and a Yin chapter, which can cultivate Yin and Yang qi. In fact, it can be cultivated without splitting the soul. The cultivated Yin and Yang qi occupy separate territories within the sea of consciousness. Though seemingly incompatible like fire and water, they actually evolve endless mysteries at their two ends. These two types of qi can form Yin-Yang flying swords, which, once unleashed, are specialized in killing souls. Though a soul technique, it is somewhat similar to sword manipulation arts, both involving the use of divine sense to control a sword. However, the former controls Yin-Yang flying swords cultivated from the soul, while the latter controls physical flying sword magical treasures.

The former kills souls, the latter slays physical bodies; their profound mysteries differ. With this technique, Yang Ji's confidence grew stronger, and his methods more numerous. Both physical cultivation arts and soul cultivation arts were now complete. Such a foundation already directly rivaled that of most true disciples. Subsequent power bursts would only require him to perfect his techniques and advance his cultivation to the Soul Transformation stage. Then, he would have the confidence to contend for the true disciple position.

Yang Ji slightly composed himself, calmed his mind, and began to fully comprehend the techniques. As for his cultivation, Dao-level cultivation methods could cultivate themselves, so he only needed to consume pills. Days like these passed one by one, and in a flash, three years had gone by. During these three years, his understanding of the techniques grew considerably, and his cultivation also increased significantly.

It was on this very day that Yang Ji, who was engrossed in comprehending techniques, suddenly heard a childish voice calling out: "Big Brother! Big Brother! I'm so hungry! I want to eat!"

"Hm?" What kind of person was Yang Ji? He was a Nascent Soul True Monarch, with acute spiritual perception, instantly aware of the slightest disturbance. Immediately, his eyes opened and closed, yin qi flowing in his left eye and yang qi in his right, giving birth to yin and yang energies. Evidently, 'Yin-Yang Sundering Awareness' had been cultivated to introductory mastery by him over these three years. With a slight sensing, he knew the sound originated from his Dantian. As his divine sense delved in, a strange glint immediately flashed in his eyes. "This is? The Primordial Divine Tree?"

Before him, there suddenly appeared a miniature girl, sculpted from pink jade, no taller than three inches, just like a Buddhist child. She wore a green dress, with two swaying ram's horn braids on her head. Her eyes sparkled with vitality and spirit, making her look adorable and irresistible, making anyone want to pinch her collagen-rich little cheeks. Just by looking at her, Yang Ji felt a powerful surge of wood qi emanating from her, rolling like a tide, as if he were in a green ocean world, where wood qi and greenness filled the entire heaven and earth. It was as if all the wood-attribute essence of the world had converged upon her.

Yang Ji's gaze was fixed on the display above the little girl's head, which read: [Primordial Divine Tree Sapling]. "The woodchip sprouted and grew? And even transformed into human form?" A feeling of a doting old father's hardship suddenly welled up in Yang Ji's heart. After so many years, the little woodchip that needed constant feeding had finally sprouted into a child. While surprised, he also felt greatly relieved.

"Big Brother, I'm so hungry! You haven't given me food in ages." The little girl, seeing Yang Ji's divine sense manifest in human form, wasn't afraid. Instead, she pouted her rosy little lips and grumbled. "Big Brother, I eat this every day, and my tummy is almost flat from hunger." A spiritual light flashed in the little girl's palm, and a round 'pearl' about her size appeared out of thin air. She crunched on it. While chewing, she disdainfully held up the 'pearl' in her hand, her face full of grievance, and rubbed her little belly, as if saying, 'Look, my tummy is so flat now.' Anyone who saw such profound grievance would feel a pang of heartache.

However, Yang Ji's gaze was 'nailed' to the pearl in her hand. His pupils slightly dilated as he couldn't help but happily murmur, "Low-grade Spirit Qi Fruit?" "Judging by the spiritual qi overflowing from the fruit's broken edge, the purity of the spiritual qi contained in this Spirit Qi Fruit should be between that of a Nine-Revolutions Golden Pill and a Nascent Soul Pill. If I could continuously consume such Spirit Qi Fruits..." Yang Ji's eyes lit up.

"Big Brother, Brother, Brother!" Seeing Yang Ji ignore her, the little girl stretched out her words resentfully and pouted.

Yang Ji cleared his throat, snapping back to reality. Perhaps it was due to constantly feeding her his essence blood that there was no sense of unfamiliarity between them upon meeting; instead, a faint familiarity filled his heart. "I gave you so much food, did you eat it all?" Yang Ji's gaze swept over the Dantian, finding that all the wood-attribute spiritual items placed there had turned into dull, rotten wood.

"Yes, I ate it all," the little girl said softly.

"Then eating this isn't enough to fill you up?" Yang Ji pointed to the Spirit Qi Fruit she had bitten.

"This has no taste, it's not good, I don't like it," the little girl shook her head.

"Then how many of these can you produce in a day?" Yang Ji suddenly showed a benevolent, fatherly smile and asked gently.

"Right now, I can produce one of these fruits a day. But once I've eaten enough and grown up, I can produce many in a day," the little girl said innocently.

"One a day is completely enough for my cultivation," Yang Ji's heart swelled with joy. He immediately said, "Since you don't like eating this, you can give it to me from now on, and I'll give you those delicious things you used to eat, how about that?"

"Yay, yay!" The little girl nodded excitedly. "Here, Big Brother, for you." As she spoke, she handed over the bitten Spirit Qi Fruit in her hand. Yang Ji took it and saw that the Spirit Qi Fruit contained no other components, just pure spiritual qi, like a supreme-grade spirit stone. He secretly marveled at his fortune. If it produced a large number of Spirit Qi Fruits in the future, they would be like supreme-grade spirit stones, far more valuable than Sky Spirit Pills.

"Big Brother, I don't want to stay here, it's not fun at all," the little girl glanced at the Dantian and frowned slightly.

"Alright, then I'll move you out. You're indeed no longer suitable for my Dantian now. Oh, by the way, why don't you give yourself a name?" Yang Ji suddenly said.

"A name?" The little girl tilted her head, her jewel-like eyes sparkling and darting about. "I am originally a divine sapling of heaven and earth, the Primordial World-Opening Tree, so I'll be called Shen Yin."
