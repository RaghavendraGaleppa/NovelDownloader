# Chapter 39: The Glib Tongue's Dilemma

Accountant Li’s hand试探性地 rested on Qiao She’s lower back.

The petite girl’s body stiffened abruptly, yet she did not pull away.

Accountant Li’s confidence surged instantly.

A desperate little maid—how could she not submit?

Li Damu sneered in triumph, his hand eagerly sliding downward toward the curve of her buttocks.

Accountant Li’s old wife was back home tending to his elders, leaving him alone at Phoenix Manor as an accountant.

Every year, Li Damu only returned home during his leave days.

But even when he went back, how could that haggard, charmless woman compare to the vibrant, youthful girl before him now?

The sensation at his fingertips was like touching the lost youth of his own life.

“Ah! No…” Qiao She suddenly cried out in alarm.

She had been startled by his actions.

Perhaps subconsciously, she had indeed harbored the thought of using Mr. Li’s power to change her predicament.

But whether she was truly willing to give herself to him for that, she couldn't make up her mind so easily.

Accountant Li’s fingers hadn’t even reached their destination yet, but the serpentine touch jolted Qiao She back to her senses.

Caught off guard, Li Damu was shoved back a step by Qiao She, and his face immediately darkened.

He put on a stern expression and scolded, “贱婢! Do you think you’re still that high-ranking maid in the inner quarters?

Now the Young Mistress sees you as a thorn in her side, and the Madam has abandoned you to avoid conflict. You’re finished, do you understand?”

Accountant Li hooked Qiao She’s chin up, a threatening sneer crossing his wrinkled face.

“If you submit to this old man, I’ll risk my reputation to plead for you, and you won’t have to suffer anymore. If not… Hmph!”

Qiao She’s heart was in turmoil.

She knew that Accountant Li was speaking the truth.

The Young Mistress wanted to make an example of her, and the Madam had given up on her. She had no future.

Although everyone in the main household’s inner quarters was technically a servant, there were still hierarchies among servants.

She had once stood high above others; how could she endure a life trampled into the dust now?

She was so young, yet cast aside and ostracized. The压抑 was enough to drive one crazy.

But… but, was she really going to submit to this old man before her?

Mr. Li’s wrinkles were like the cracked skin of parched earth after a long drought, deep and crisscrossing…

Two clear tears slid down Qiao She’s fair cheeks. She squeezed her eyes shut!

Forget it. Since everyone has abandoned me, I might as well sacrifice myself.

It’s just like being bitten by a dog!

Just then, a clear voice rang out from outside the door: “Mr. Li, are you still awake? It’s Yang Can. I have something to discuss with you.”

Accountant Li had just scared Qiao She into submission and was about to pounce on her to enjoy his prize when he suddenly heard Yang Can’s voice. His heart filled with hatred.

Damn it! He comes at the worst possible time, ruining my好事.

He glanced at Qiao She, who had opened her eyes again, and could only suppress his anger. “Is that Steward Yang? Please wait a moment.”

Li Damu then lowered his voice and threatened, “Think carefully about what I said. Right now, I’m the only one willing to save you from this hell. Once I’m gone, there won’t be another chance. Miss Qiao She, don’t mistake your opportunity.”

With that, Li Damu darkened his face and ordered, “Wipe those tears away immediately.”

Li Damu hurried over and opened the door to find Yang Can standing outside.

Li Damu said in surprise, “Steward Yang, it’s so late. What brings you here?”

“Mr. Li, I’ve come to discuss a matter. What, aren’t you going to invite me in?”

“Oh, look at me. Hahaha, Steward Yang, please come in.”

Li Damu stepped aside. Yang Can walked in and immediately spotted Qiao She.

“Mr. Li has a guest?”

Li Damu hurriedly explained, “Oh, this is a messenger maid from the inner quarters. She brought some ledgers that the Young Mistress needs checked and compiled.”

Li Damu waved at Qiao She and said, “Alright, you can go back now. We’ll check these accounts in the accounting room as soon as possible.”

Qiao She had been standing there in a daze. Seeing Li Damu wave her off, she hurriedly walked out as if granted a reprieve from death.

Accountant Li put on a smiling face and said to Yang Can, “Steward Yang, please sit. To what do I owe the honor of your visit?”

Qiao She walked out of Accountant Li’s residence in a daze and stopped under a large tree full of elm seeds.

The tree was laden with elm samaras, their faint, fresh fragrance gradually calming her emotions.

Over the past two days, she had been made an example of by the Young Mistress and abandoned by the Madam, her status plummeting.

There were plenty of people in the inner quarters who fawned on the powerful and kicked the downtrodden. While they hadn’t physically abused her, the mental torment was enough to make life unbearable.

Caught off guard by these changes, her mind had been in a muddle. For a while, aside from self-pity, she hadn't even thought of a way to save herself.

But now, her mind suddenly cleared.

How could I forget? I can still seek refuge with Steward Yang!

Qiao She suddenly remembered that when she was being punished by the Young Mistress that day, Steward Yang was the only one who wasn't afraid of the Young Mistress.

Steward Yang had openly helped her, completely disregarding the Young Mistress’s face.

“A maid serving in the main household, especially one by the Young Mistress’s side, her face is the family’s veil. If it’s disfigured, what would that look like?”

“These days, the one supervising the punishment looks more like a clown on stage than the one being punished.”

Steward Yang didn’t just dare to openly apply medicine; he even dared to openly mock the Young Mistress’s trusted maid, Qing Mei…

If I must find a backer, choosing Steward Yang is definitely better than choosing Accountant Li.

Not to mention their power and status, just looking at Steward Yang—he is young and handsome. How could he possibly be compared to that old fogey Li Damu?

Qiao She took a few steps back, leaning against the large elm tree, hiding her body in the shadows.

Inside the room, Li Damu was both surprised and delighted. “Steward Yang wants me to accompany you on an inspection of the various manors? Sure, sure! Why wouldn't it be? It is my duty to obey Steward Yang’s orders!”

Li Damu almost burst into tears of joy.

Hehe, just sitting here in the manor, Manor Lord Zhang sent me two gold ingots. If I go to his place to audit his accounts, how many gold ingots would he have to give me?

This assignment is incredibly profitable.

And, the task the Young Mistress gave me to offend people—I can now conveniently push it off.

Li Damu couldn’t wait to agree. “I am also a part of the main household. Naturally, I should share the burden for the Clan Lord and the Young Mistress. All other matters can be put aside. Accompanying Steward Yang on the inspection is my unshirkable duty. What? You’re asking about these ledgers? No problem, I’ll hand them over to my colleagues in the accounting room tomorrow.”

Yang Can smiled. “Since that’s settled, then it’s a done deal. Alright, the night is deep, so I won’t disturb Mr. Li’s rest anymore. You can prepare in advance over the next couple of days.”

“Rest assured, Steward Yang. I won’t delay the大事.”

Accountant Li happily saw Yang Can out the door.

The spring night breeze was slightly cool. Elm samaras fell with the wind, stepping on them gave a soft feeling.

In the shadows of the tree, Qiao She saw a tall, straight figure approaching and gritted her teeth.

“Steward Yang, save me!”

If Qiao She hadn’t knelt so quickly, Yang Can would have kicked her away.

“Steward Yang, this servant begs for Steward Yang’s pity.”

Yang Can slowly retracted his raised right foot and looked closely. “You are… someone from the inner quarters?”

“This servant is named Qiao She.”

“Yes, yes, Miss Qiao She. What are you stopping me for?”

“This servant… begs for Steward Yang’s pity.”

“Pity? Pity for what? Has the Young Mistress been making things difficult for you?”

“The Young Mistress doesn’t need to keep making things difficult for me. As soon as I fall out of favor, others will naturally step on me.”

Qiao She lifted her palm-sized face, her fair cheeks flushing red.

“Please, Steward Yang, take me in. I can wash clothes, make the bed, pour tea and water, or warm the bed and bathe your feet. I can do anything.”

Yang Can frowned. Is it really that bad? She’s acting like she can’t survive. Is it really that miserable?

Yang Can had never had designs on this girl, nor did he want to take her into his room out of pity.

He harbored a secret that could blow him to pieces.

He still had many things to do for the sake of this secret.

That kid Wangcai is just a laborer; he won’t discover anything.

But a person sharing his bed? That’s a different story.

Besides, this Miss Qiao She used to be from the Clan Lord’s wife’s courtyard. Who knows if what she says is true or false? And he should just take her back?

He was currently engaged in a business that could cost him his head.

“Miss, let go. You… this posture, what will people think?”

Yang Can tried to lift his leg but couldn’t, because Qiao She was hugging his thigh tightly.

“Please save me, Steward Yang. If you refuse to help, then I’ll have no way out… I’ll have to hang myself.”

“It can’t be that serious…”

Hearing that she wanted to kill herself, Yang Can was startled.

Suo Chanzhi is pregnant right now. If Qiao She dies, it would be like dying by her hand, which is very inauspicious.

Wait?

Yang Can suddenly thought of Li Youcai. Wasn’t Steward Li looking for a pretty little maid?

Why don’t I give this girl to Sister Panzhi?

“Alright, I promise to help you. Get up quickly.”

Qiao She was overjoyed. She looked up nervously and asked, “Is Steward Yang serious?”

Yang Can laughed. “Is there any need for me to lie to you? Get up.”

“Thank you, Steward Yang.”

Qiao She happily kowtowed to Yang Can before climbing to her feet.

Yang Can said, “Go back first. Tomorrow, I’ll ask the Young Mistress for you.”

“Yes, this servant obeys. This servant will wait for Steward Yang!”

Qiao She agreed joyfully, not even noticing an elm samara stuck to her forehead from the kowtow.

Qiao She left, skipping away happily like a magpie foraging for food.

Yang Can couldn’t help but chuckle at the sight.

He looked up at the moon in the sky and suddenly thought of that bowl of dumplings with thin skins, big fillings, and delicious, fresh juice.

In the chilly spring night, a busy man returning late, being able to eat a steaming bowl of dumplings—wasn’t that a kind of happiness?

Unfortunately, this bowl of dumplings was poisoned and couldn't be eaten.

Yang Can sighed and could only gaze longingly at the “dumplings.”
