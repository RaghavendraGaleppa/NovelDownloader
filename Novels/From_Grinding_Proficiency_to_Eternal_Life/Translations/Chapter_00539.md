Chapter 539: The Master of the Hundred Flowers Peak

The female cultivator was absolutely a Dual Cultivation Saint Body. Her innate charm technique was so potent that even the Hundred Desires Peak would be ecstatic upon seeing it.

He stretched, his posture extremely lazy and casual.

"Buying a sword? Forget it, I'm not interested in that scrap metal."

He paused, his smile widening, carrying a naked, aggressive intent.

"Senior Sister should be a disciple of the Hundred Desires Peak, right? When I was cultivating there before, I also diligently studied the Hundred Desires Devouring Yuan Great Method. I've even heard of the further advanced Heaven and Earth Interchange Yin-Yang Separation and Union True Scripture, and I have deep insights into the way of dual cultivation and essence extraction.

Meeting Senior Sister today, I finally realize that such a peerless beauty exists in this world.

Senior Sister is in such a hurry to pack up her stall and hide in this secluded place. Could it be that your heart is lonely and you wish to draw water from your own spring?

I wonder if Senior Sister would be willing to grant me the honor of an in-depth discussion and exchange with this Junior Brother?

This place has clear waters and lush mountains, with a gentle breeze. It's a fine place to exchange insights on the Great Dao."

These words were explicit, frivolous, and even carried vulgar implications. In the eyes of cultivators, they were extremely crude and vulgar.

Unfortunately, for the disciples of the Origin Sect's Hundred Desires Peak, this was quite common. Such words would even be considered somewhat restrained on the Hundred Desires Peak.

Some disciples on the Hundred Desires Peak, if they took a liking to someone, would directly go up and ask if they wanted to do it, regardless of whether the other party was male or female.

It was truly chaotic.

That was precisely why Xu Yunfan had left the Hundred Desires Peak without hesitation.

It was good, but sometimes it was really hard to tell if the other person was male or female.

The body-transformation secret arts of the Hundred Desires Peak allowed for endless changes between male and female yin and yang.

He really couldn't get over this psychological hurdle.

However, Xu Yunfan's face wore an extremely natural expression, as if this were the natural order of things.

His gaze was open and aboveboard, as if discussing what to eat for dinner.

He pushed the 'Lin' character mantra to its extreme, his mind like a cold probe, firmly locking onto every subtle change in the woman's expression and the deepest fluctuations of her mind.

But what surprised Xu Yunfan was that the smile on the female cultivator's face instantly froze.

It was like a delicate porcelain vase that had been smashed, revealing cracks that were hard to conceal.

The original vigilance and solemnity in the depths of her eyes were replaced at this moment by an extremely intense disgust, shame, anger, and a heavy killing intent.

It was the most instinctive anger born from having her beauty and dignity—which she had carefully honed and viewed as her greatest weapon—trampled and crushed by the other party at will.

This scene made Xu Yunfan a little surprised.

Could it be that he had guessed wrong?

"Insolence!"

A sharp shout containing spiritual pressure rang out. The ancient sword "Sinking Star" in her hand suddenly burst forth with a gray, strange aura.

The incomplete spiritual pressure belonging to a magic treasure suddenly became violent, carrying a depressing sword intent that disturbed the mind. It wasn't a pure physical attack, but more like a power that搅乱 (stirred up/troubled) the soul.

The gray light, like a venomous snake's tongue, was extremely fast, aiming straight for Xu Yunfan's glabella.

This was definitely not just the power a Qi Condensation cultivator should possess.

Yet it was also a distance away from the power of Foundation Establishment.

If placed in the Qi Condensation stage, it should be unmatched by anyone.

Within the sword light, a faint, almost imperceptible black demonic pattern flashed by!

Evidently, she had not only hidden part of her cultivation, but this so-called flawed magic treasure also concealed a secret.

It was very likely a strange secret weapon given to her by the power behind her, specifically to deal with "big fish."

"So you're angry and ashamed?"

Instead of being alarmed, Xu Yunfan laughed.

The other party's intense reaction and the foundation of power displayed in her attack perfectly confirmed his guess.

This was a fishing hook.

He didn't know who could be so cruel as to send out such a beautiful female cultivator.

Facing the strange gray light stabbing right before his eyes, Xu Yunfan didn't move at all.

He just looked at the female cultivator's eyes with a似笑非笑 (half-smiling, half-not) expression and said two words淡淡 (calmly).

"Stay."

No spell light, no energy fluctuation, not even a ripple in space.

However, the strange gray light that could make a Qi Condensation peak cultivator feel their soul unstable, along with the purple-robed female cultivator holding the sword and thrusting, were truly like they had hit an invisible, intangible, yet indestructible barrier, and were hard-stopped in mid-air, three feet from Xu Yunfan's glabella.

Foundation Establishment cultivator!

The anger on the female cultivator's face instantly transformed into boundless horror.

She discovered that her entire body's muscles, flowing blood, circulating magic power, and even the secret technique she was frantically activating within her body were all like they had been instantly locked by the most precise chains.

A vast, incomprehensible, and irresistible will had brutally imprisoned her body and mind.

Only her eyeballs could still move, conveying disbelief and terror.

She wanted to open her mouth and shout, but found that even her vocal cords had been completely frozen.

The gray aura surging on the ancient sword "Sinking Star" trembled violently a few times, like a venomous snake whose seven-inch had been pinched, and completely withered away. The originally tiny cracks on the sword body seemed to suddenly expand a little.

Just as Xu Yunfan, his smile undiminished and carrying a hint of examination and teasing, was about to step forward to completely subdue this "cauldron" full of secrets and take her back to properly "study" the so-called Hundred Desires Peak dual cultivation secret arts...

"Xu Shidi~~"

A soft, seductive, bone-eroding voice, containing infinite charm, as if it could soften a person's soul, suddenly rang out above the clearing in the forest. With lingering echoes, it instantly broke the dead silence here.

This sound didn't come from a specific direction, but was like spring water permeating the air, everywhere.

It rippled with exquisite sounds that could soothe the heart. It was a superb soul secret art, penetrating directly to the mind.

Xu Yunfan's footsteps didn't stop at all, as if the seductive sound that could make a Foundation Establishment cultivator's mind sway was just a breeze brushing his face.

His gaze remained fixed on the purple-robed female cultivator frozen before him, the half-smiling, half-not arc at the corner of his mouth not changing in the slightest.

As he stepped forward...

A voluptuous and soft figure, clad in a seven-colored flowing cloud rainbow dress, accompanied by a rich fragrance of a hundred flowers, slowly materialized from the void like a painting, landing about a zhang in front of the frozen female cultivator,恰好 (exactly) blocking Xu Yunfan's path.

The newcomer was precisely the Master of the Hundred Desires Peak, Hundred Flowers True Person.

Her cloud-like hair was high-coiffed, with a trembling seven-colored feather pinned askew. Her face was peerlessly beautiful, and her eyes seemed to hold autumn water, naturally exuding charm as their light rippled, yet deeply hidden within was the might of a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Beneath the rainbow dress, her graceful curves were faintly visible. As she walked, she swayed with charm. Every part of her body exuded the fatal allure and temptation of a mature woman.

The moment she appeared, the spiritual energy of the entire forest seemed to carry a hint of romantic and restless energy.

Xu Yunfan's heart tightened slightly.

This Heaven and Earth Interchange Yin-Yang Separation and Union True Scripture was truly a bit abnormal. Once cast, even a hundred grasses would spring forth.

Hundred Flowers True Person smiled brightly, her red lips slightly parted, her voice still soft enough to drip water.

"Shidi, why must you make things difficult for a junior?"

Her slender, jade-like finger casually pointed at the purple-robed female cultivator, whose face still held horror.

"This is my most prized direct disciple, Pu Yu. She is a先天情欲道体 (Innate Passion Dao Body) that my Hundred Desires Peak has discovered over several generations. She is a perfect cauldron that I have carefully nurtured, preparing to use to impact a higher realm."
