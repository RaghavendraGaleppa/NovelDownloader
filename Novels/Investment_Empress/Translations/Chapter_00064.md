Chapter 64: Discussing the Dao of Swordsmanship, Ying Bing: "Could it be that I Underestimated Him Before?"

Bing Tuozi, for the first time, cooked a meal properly. Following the principle of not wasting anything, several dishes were eventually plated and served.

At the table, the few clumps of food on the plates seemed to radiate a demonic aura. "So... what are these?" Everyone knew that Little Li was an exceptional cook, but what Bing Tuozi had made was a bit beyond his comprehension.

"It's tomato stir-fried with eggs," Ying Bing said, wiping her face clean with a handkerchief in a cold and detached tone. "And this one?" Li Mo asked after a moment of silence. "Pepper stir-fried with meat," Ying Bing replied, earning a surprised glance from Li Mo. She could actually recognize it?

"And this..." "Nine-turned intestines," she even answered before he could finish asking. Li Mo gasped, wondering if she was being deliberate or accidental. He could only look away, unable to bear the sight, and said, "Well... you're quite skilled. You've been cooking like this these past few days?"

"I only cooked once today," Ying Bing said softly. Li Mo was taken aback. "So, you just happened to cook on the day I returned?" This made it clear that she had done it on purpose. It was unlike Bing Tuozi to cook willingly; it was as if the sun had risen from the west.

"One shouldn't judge things by their appearance," Ying Bing said, her serious lips opening. "Perhaps it's just the presentation that's off, and it's actually better than expected." Li Mo understood that Bing Tuozi had made this meal to prove a point. She was proud and wanted to do everything perfectly, including cooking.

But it seemed that the universe had given her a door and then sealed another with cement. Her beauty was unmatched, but her cooking was... "If we don't eat soon, it'll get cold," Ying Bing said, blocking Li Mo's excuse. The impact of her words was not unlike saying, "Brother, drink the medicine." "Okay! I'll risk my life to accompany you, sir!" Li Mo nodded heavily and, with a heroic heart, reached out with his chopsticks.

Just as he was about to pick up the tomato stir-fried eggs, Ying Bing beat him to it and gave him a piece of nine-turned intestines instead. The moment it entered his mouth, a burst of complex flavors exploded, like the highlights of his past life. The taste was sour, bitter, and twisted, making his scalp tingle. It was a flavor that could haunt his dreams.

"You're... why are you crying?" "Grandma..." "Are you remembering your grandma's cooking?" "No, I saw her," Li Mo said, tears falling from his eyes. Ying Bing's brow furrowed. She had cooked for two reasons: first, she didn't believe she could do something badly, and second, she wanted to repay Li Mo for his help.

She had studied cooking seriously and even obtained a few bottles of Black Killer Wood Oil from Elder Xue on Dan Ding Peak to add to the pepper stir-fried meat. She had added it for ten seconds, not understanding the measure of "a spoon." The dish wasn't delicious...

Half an hour later, a new table of dishes was served. Looking at Bing Tuozi's now even redder lips, Li Mo sighed, "I didn't help you much; you didn't have to go to the trouble of cooking." "Let's just eat," Ying Bing said.

After rinsing his mouth and eating a few mouthfuls of the newly cooked vegetables, Li Mo felt revived. Ying Bing's gaze moved, and she asked, "How is she now?" "I left her some healing supplements and bought the civilian residence she's staying in. Her daily life isn't a worry; I've instructed the Murong family to send her things regularly." Ying Bing's expression flickered with surprise; she knew Jiao Chu Long's character - someone very closed off.

Li Mo's ability to get along with her wasn't surprising to Ying Bing. "Thanks," she said. "It's nothing much," Li Mo replied. "We're close; you don't have to make such a big deal out of it." After understanding Bing Tuozi's thought process behind cooking, Li Mo felt that while being serious was good, sometimes it wasn't necessary.

"If you really want to thank me, help me with something," Li Mo said. "What do you need help with?" "For example... discussing the Dao of swordsmanship with me?" Li Mo had no one else to ask, and Bing Tuozi was his last resort. He couldn't figure out how to help Jiao Chu Long.

"Discussing the Dao of swordsmanship with me?" Ying Bing raised an eyebrow. Teaching and discussing were different; very few were qualified to discuss the Dao of swordsmanship with her. She had once mastered a path of swordsmanship, standing at the peak of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands.

Li Mo's previous talent in swordsmanship wasn't enough to qualify him for such a discussion. "Let's hear your questions first," she said. "I've made a list," Li Mo replied, pulling out a piece of paper from his bosom. Ying Bing glanced over it, her calm eyes narrowing. The questions were surprisingly profound, touching on the fundamentals of swordsmanship.

She could answer them, but Li Mo's ability to ask such questions was unexpected. Asking questions required a certain level of understanding; the doubts in the minds of geniuses and ordinary people were completely different. Ying Bing stared at Li Mo, her icy eyes reflecting the youth, as if trying to see through him.

Li Mo's previous talent was strange but not necessarily genius-level. Ying Bing couldn't quite grasp why he was able to ask such questions now. "Is that all?" she asked. Li Mo nodded, "Yes, that's all for now."
