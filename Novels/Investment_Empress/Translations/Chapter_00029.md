# Chapter 29: Learning Swordplay, Ying Bing Prepares for the Legacy Site

Autumn Water Pavilion.
Night fell, bringing a slight chill.

Tonight, only three small dishes sat on the table. They weren't cooked by Li Mo, but brought back from the mess hall.

Ying Bing held her bowl, her cheeks moving slightly. After only half a bowl, she put down her chopsticks. Tonight's meal was truly bland.

Ying Bing had never been particular about food; as long as it was clean and filling, it sufficed. For her, eating was merely a necessity for her current body. Her desire for food, like other desires, was faint.

Hmm... Before she had hotpot and barbecue, this was indeed true.

'I can endure darkness if I have never seen the light.'

This saying applied equally to gourmet food. Now, looking at these ordinary dishes, a faint sense of emptiness settled in Ying Bing's heart.

She subtly glanced across the table. The young man was mechanically pushing his food around, a look of existential doubt on his face.

Little Li's mood was indeed exceedingly complex.

"World-Shattering Meteor Hammer... a divine weapon..."

When Murong Xiao had quietly told him it might be a divine weapon stirring at the bottom of the Divine Blade Cave, Li Mo's expression had been exceptionally vivid.

"My sword art has reached minor accomplishment, but the Crimson Sky Sword ignores me."
"Yet, I've never practiced hammer arts, and this divine hammer seems particularly fond of me."

It wouldn't be an exaggeration to say that hammer was the Crimson Sky Sword's father. Could it be that he wasn't suited for swordplay at all, but rather for hammers?

In his mind, an image involuntarily surfaced: him, with a wicked smile, swinging a hammer to smash an enemy's head...

"Hiss..."
"Impossible, absolutely impossible!"

Li Mo slammed down his chopsticks, dispelling the image from his mind. He had no more appetite for food. As if to defy fate, he picked up a long sword and walked into the courtyard.

Holding the Azure Steel Sword, he personally demonstrated his sword art for the first time. The sword light flowed, indeed appearing quite spirited and forceful.

At his age, achieving minor accomplishment in a high-grade sword art would make any elder praise him as a true sword dao genius.

"Minor accomplishment in ten days."
"He does have some talent for swordplay."

Ying Bing also felt he was somewhat passable.

Of course, he was still a long way from being a true sword dao genius.

Even without her past life's experience and insight, she could achieve minor accomplishment in a high-grade sword art in just half an hour.

However, in the way of the sword, there were even more terrifying prodigies than her.

Born with a Sword Heart and Sword Bone, they could innovate any sword art with a single glance, create peerless-grade sword arts at ten, and master divine-grade sword arts by twenty.

Such people truly existed. And one of them was a particularly memorable defeated opponent of Ying Bing's.

If Li Mo knew her thoughts, he would probably be bitterly amused.

He knew his own situation. The years he had spent practicing swordplay were greater than his actual age. Even now, he was only barely passable. His actual talent would probably only amount to utter rubbish...

"I don't feel like I'm making any progress."
"I can't even see the dawn of grand accomplishment."

As Li Mo practiced his sword, he had to admit something.

He wasn't practicing swordplay; at best, he was performing a sword dance, as he made no progress after each repetition. He didn't even know what direction he should be striving in.

It wasn't the lack of effort that was frightening, but the inability to find the direction for effort. Was he truly not cut out to be a swordsman?

"This sword art of yours, its essence lies in concealment, not release." A familiar, clear voice suddenly rang out beside his ear.

Before Li Mo could react, a slender, fair hand had already taken the Azure Steel Sword from his grasp.

"The longer you can accumulate, the stronger the power will be when it finally erupts." *Whoosh—* "Therefore, your sword strokes must be like embroidery, controlling every ounce of your force." *Swish—* "The stronger your control, the more force you can accumulate."

Under the moonlight, the beauty danced with her sword, light and graceful. She was focused and serious when wielding the sword, her movements possessing a harmonious beauty untainted by the mortal world. She was like an ice lotus in a mountain pond, slowly blooming after enduring spring, summer, autumn, and winter.

Li Mo stared blankly. But then, he felt a little confused. The Ice Block clearly hadn't practiced "Fire Crane's Thousand Feathers," had she? Was what she said correct?

**[Twenty years of martial dao comprehension successfully injected.]**

Little Li decided to activate his cheat. Anyway, the sect trial was coming soon, and improving his sword art would definitely be useful.

**[Year 1: Due to Ying Bing's guidance, you found the correct practice direction for the Fire Crane's Thousand Feathers.]**
**[Year 5: You diligently practiced controlling the sword and finally managed to hold seventeen feathers without releasing them.]**
**[Year 7: The further you progressed, the harder control became to practice. Even a tiny improvement required immense effort. You spent two years without making progress.]**
**[Year 13: Through consistent effort, you finally integrated the technique into your body's instinct, able to hold twenty-four feathers.]**
**[Year 20: You successfully managed to leave thirty feather marks on the wooden dummy for the first time.]**
**[Fire Crane's Thousand Feathers Sword Art, Grand Accomplishment.]**

Li Mo: "..."

Sword dao experience, like flowing water, instantly flooded his mind. But he couldn't feel happy at all.

The Ice Block's guidance was indeed correct. What was certain was that she hadn't practiced this sword art; she had only watched him practice it once. And then... she could guide him?

Although he really didn't want to use that adjective, Li Mo had to admit that his heart was filled with... "Terrifying, truly terrifying!"

*Thump, thump, thump—* A series of muffled thuds. The girl retracted her sword and turned. Behind her, dozens of feather-like marks suddenly appeared on the bamboo, each bursting into brilliant ice blossoms.

Without even turning her head, she softly asked, "Did you learn it?"

Li Mo: "...I did."

It was clear that the Ice Block wasn't being sarcastic. She genuinely wanted to teach him, and genuinely believed that he could improve after watching once.

Li Mo suddenly remembered his past life, when he asked a top student a math question, and the student wrote down four solutions without even looking up. Each one was beyond the curriculum. Then, they genuinely asked him, "Did you get it?"

"Do it once." The sword was tossed back. Li Mo's emotions were complex as he caught the sword and began to demonstrate.

In Ying Bing's slightly lowered eyes, the somewhat clumsy figure of the young man was reflected. A hint of satisfaction flickered in her gaze.

Not bad. If he could be taught, then he wasn't too stupid; he counted as sword-training material.

"Did I practice it correctly?" Li Mo turned around, only to find the space behind him empty. The second-story window was closed again, and a thin layer of ice quickly formed on it. It seemed she had returned to her cultivation.

"How many meridians has the Ice Block opened now?" Li Mo mused slightly. He had originally thought he was progressing quite quickly in the Qi-Blood Realm. Even those with red Heavenly Mandates might not be able to keep up with him.

But what had just happened forced him to temper his pride and impatience. Little Li put away his slight smugness. He returned to his room and sat cross-legged on the bed.

The Fire Sparrow Feather Pouch on his chest emitted a steady, peaceful warmth. Fire Heart Lotus Birth Art, activate! Tonight, he would try to open his ninth meridian!

Unbeknownst to them.
The moon hung high in the sky.
Next door.

"The ninth meridian is open." Ying Bing opened her eyes, the ice crystals on her eyelashes shimmering faintly.

From opening her first meridian until now, only half a month had passed, yet she had condensed nine meridians. In her previous life, it had taken her a full three months.

Her realm progression was several times faster. But. Her combat power was not just tens of times stronger!

Currently, she could, at most, use her present body to unleash grandmaster-level sword arts.

Her combat experience, not to mention in Ziyang Prefecture, but across the entire Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, was unequivocally the best.

Moreover, she possessed the power of the Supreme Yin. Although she couldn't fully control it yet, even a mere wisp of its overflowing aura was enough to serve as a trump card.

"For the sect trial, I should be well-prepared to handle any unforeseen circumstances."
