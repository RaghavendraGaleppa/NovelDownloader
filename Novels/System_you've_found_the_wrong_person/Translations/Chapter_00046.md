# Chapter 46: The Enchantress - Chen Taizhen

Late at night.

Dou Changsheng exhaled a white breath.

The white qi lingered in the air like a silken ribbon, refusing to dissipate.

After consuming another dose of Qingyang Spring and days of arduous cultivation, Dou Changsheng's innate qi had undergone a transformation.

This marked the completion of the first of the Five Qi transformations. 

The change was palpable—his innate qi had become far more refined. Where ten strands of his current qi could shatter fifteen strands of his previous power, this was merely after one transformation. After completing all five transformations, the qualitative leap would be even more pronounced, showcasing the true might of innate true qi.

Of course, this wasn't typical—it was the extraordinary effect of supreme techniques like the *Triple Origin Qi Method*.

The *Five Qi Seal* had also replenished, and with his newfound mastery of the Thirteen Golden Sword Techniques, while his realm hadn't advanced significantly, his combat prowess had grown substantially.

Especially with the secret technique imparted by General Yu Yun—*The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies*.

At first glance, this technique appeared simple and straightforward.

But only after immersing himself in its study did Dou Changsheng begin to grasp its profound power.

More means stronger, stronger leads to greater momentum, and greater momentum translates to overwhelming force—an unstoppable path to victory.

Such a plain and unadorned principle.

Yet achieving it was anything but easy.

With the Millennium Earth Pearl bolstering his qi reserves, Dou Changsheng was perfectly suited for *The Formation of Ten Thousand Armies*.

What made this technique truly invaluable was its ability to amplify the power of swordplay, fist techniques, palm strikes, and more.

In gaming terms—it was a flat +2 to attack power!

After practicing the Thirteen Golden Sword Techniques—focusing on foundational stances and qi circulation—Dou Changsheng retired for the night as the hour grew late.

The next morning, after washing up, Wang Tianhe tossed him a bundle. "There are spare clothes inside, your calligraphy scroll, and some travel funds."

"But most importantly, there's a treasure artifact—the *Earth Evasion Talisman*."

"It can teleport you a hundred li in an instant, bypassing earth, stone, and vegetation."

"But remember—this talisman cannot be used near water. Rivers, lakes, or streams will drastically weaken its effect."

"Also, never use it directly within a battlefield, restrictive formation, or array. First create an opening, then activate it for optimal results."

"This talisman is single-use. Unless absolutely necessary, don't waste it."

"Though it's a high-grade treasure, it's not omnipotent. Don't rely on it to save your life."

"The most important thing—don't go—"

Wang Tianhe swallowed the word "recklessly."

The path of valor was destined to be fraught with danger.

With a wave of his hand, he dismissed Dou Changsheng.

Slinging the bundle over his shoulder, Dou Changsheng secured the *Earth Evasion Talisman* close to his body.

The talisman was palm-sized, its surface inscribed with crimson wave-like patterns he couldn't decipher. Yet the profound aura it exuded made its value unmistakable.

After bowing to Wang Tianhe, Dou Changsheng departed, heading straight for the northern city gate.

The capital was where the world's storms converged—a gathering place for countless martial artists and formidable experts.

But it wasn't where he belonged.

Standing outside the northern gate, he gazed at the majestic city.

His visit had been brief, but when he returned, it would be to contend with the world's heroes.

For now, Dou Changsheng knew his limits. He still lacked the refinement to match the era's true prodigies.

Figures like Lin Daoqi, Chen Weiquan, or the Capital's Ten Talents were mere illusions. The real geniuses—the young elites—were all ranked on the Human Ranking.

Not those in the seventies, fifties, or forties—but the top twenty, even the top ten.

After lingering for half an hour, a procession of carriages began streaming out from the northern gate.

The massive convoy clogged the gate, causing a commotion as guards struggled to maintain order.

Dou Changsheng observed the heavily laden carriages with narrowed eyes.

Even as a deposed emperor, the young ruler was treated well—allowed to take such wealth back to his fief.

Though the goods were concealed, their value was undoubtedly astronomical.

Were it not for the fact that the deposed emperor was Yu Yun's weakness—and that the Empress wouldn't dare harm him—Dou Changsheng might have suspected this was a ploy to lure bandits into eliminating him.

As he watched, a man approached briskly and bowed. "Hero Dou."

"I am Ma Liren, steward of the Northern Yang Prince's estate."

"General Yu has arranged for you to escort the prince back to his fiefdom."

"The convoy consists of 108 carriages, with 200 servants and 500 guards."

Wiping sweat from his brow, the steward added, "This is already a pared-down retinue. Only essentials were taken, and the servants are all long-time retainers."

"The guards are drawn from the capital's patrol battalion—a dedicated force of 500."

Poverty truly limited imagination. Even a deposed emperor, stripped of privileges, could command such grandeur. Dou Changsheng couldn't fathom the scale of an actual imperial procession—tenfold? A hundredfold?

Led to the convoy's center, Dou Changsheng beheld an opulent carriage surrounded by attendants.

Pulled by five steeds, the four-wheeled carriage resembled a mobile pavilion.

Golden banners fluttered in the wind, while curtains adorned with pearls, jade, and agate shimmered under the sunlight.

Ma Liren sighed. "This was the prince's childhood plaything—the humblest of his possessions."

"Now it's all he has left."

Dou Changsheng turned to the steward. "Which senior expert currently guards the Northern Yang Prince's estate?"

"Who has the court or General Yu assigned to accompany us?"

Without a Divine Transformation expert—no, without an Earth Ranking master—Dou Changsheng felt uneasy.

Given his notorious luck, an ambush was inevitable.

Ma Liren shook his head. "The prince's former retainers have all fled—some joined the chancellor's faction, others pledged loyalty to Her Majesty."

"Even the Fire Cloud Sage has entered the Bureau of Wonders as a court-appointed consultant."

"Now, apart from myself—a mere Divine Transformation steward—there's no one left to guard the prince."

"My true duty is to ensure he lives out his days quietly."

Ma Liren made no secret of his allegiance to the Empress.

After a pause, he lowered his voice. "There is... one other."

"The former imperial consort—now the Northern Yang Princess."

"Chen Taizhen!"
