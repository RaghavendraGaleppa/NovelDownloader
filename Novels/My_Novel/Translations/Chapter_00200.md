# Chapter 200: Passionate as Glue and Paint, a Hunting Competition

Li Xian sat in the courtyard, contemplating the martial arts of various schools. He had brought both basic and low-level martial arts to their absolute peak. Only the first and second layers of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword were perfected but had not yet reached their ultimate summit.

"Madam has been slow to teach me light footwork. Is she afraid I might run away?"

"I can continue practicing the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword as usual. With my current energy, I can still cultivate another martial art."

He went straight to the Leisurely Martial Pavilion. Passing through the narrow bridge of mechanisms, he entered the pavilion to select a martial art.

The martial arts here covered both basic and low-level techniques. Li Xian examined over a dozen books. The basic martial arts were exquisite, but the low-level ones seemed to have flaws.

"I suppose... the low-level martial arts here are mostly the result of the Madam's sudden inspirations, created casually. Therefore, they are very incomplete. Strictly speaking, they are all incomplete martial arts."

"And because they are incomplete, they are even more difficult to practice. I recall that when I practiced the Emerald Green Palm back then, it consumed far more energy and time than the Thunder Finger."

"Of course, this is partly because my martial arts realm has gradually risen, my understanding has deepened, and I can draw inferences from other cases, so my practice progress is faster. But there is also the factor that the Emerald Green Palm had flaws."

Holding a candle, Li Xian walked slowly. Suddenly, he saw a low-level martial art, the Vast Misty Legs. He flipped through it and read it carefully, feeling great joy in his heart.

"This Vast Misty Legs has one or two similarities with the Breeze Legs. Although it is not light footwork, it can increase leg strength. If I practice this martial art, my speed will increase by another level."

"The effects of various martial arts are cumulative. I wonder if this can replace light footwork?"

He immediately went to a side room and silently recited it. He committed it to memory and, after confirming it was correct, went out to begin practicing.

[Vast Misty Legs]
[Proficiency: 12/600, Initial Entry]

Because the Breeze Legs had laid a solid foundation, the Vast Misty Legs were quickly mastered. There are no shortcuts on the path of martial arts, only diligent practice.

After practicing for half a day, his proficiency increased to [321]. Li Xian stopped to rest, ate lunch, and then switched to practicing the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword.

The Breeze Legs aim for a breeze that is formless, harming people unintentionally. A light, almost imperceptible kick hides a formidable killing move. The Vast Misty Legs, on the other hand, are like mist shrouding a lake. The leg techniques are ethereal, the waves unpredictable, hiding danger and treachery.

Li Xian was diligent in his heavenly duties, and coupled with his natural intelligence, he grasped the essence of the martial art and practiced diligently.

The next day, the Vast Misty Legs were already proficient.

[Vast Misty Legs]
[Proficiency: 136/1200, Proficiency]
[Description: You have glimpsed the path, practiced diligently, and mastered the Vast Misty Legs, with your leg strength gradually increasing. You have discovered that the Vast Misty Legs and the Breeze Legs are similar and complementary, and have悟ed the "Breeze Vast" trait.]

Martial arts complement each other.

The Breeze Legs' "Secret of the Light Character" allowed Li Xian to be as light as the wind, rising with the wind. However, it was not flexible or free. The Breeze Vast... complemented each other perfectly, providing great help in this regard.

In this way, the Vast Misty Legs and the second layer of the Setting Sun Withering Blood Sword... were all steadily improving. His strength progressed bit by bit, and his internal energy grew drop by drop.

Three days later, Madam Wen emerged from her seclusion.

Li Xian helped her remove her silkworm robe, their contact intimate—ordinary married couples were not this close. He also saw that her eyes were like rippling green waves, beautiful and enchanting. The Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword was secretly at play. One had supreme Yang energy, young and handsome. The other had a strong Yin aura, with graceful eyebrows.

Yin and Yang attracted each other, and their relationship naturally became more intimate.

Li Xian completely removed the silkworm robe and joked, "Madam, you promised me, so you can't blame me." Madam Wen was charming, alluring and open-minded. "Do you take me for a little girl? Allowing you to take some liberties is no big deal."

Li Xian said, "What if I want to push my luck?"

"If I become displeased, I will naturally punish you." Madam Wen's glance held a moving charm as she scolded playfully.

Madam Wen increasingly tasted the wonders of love and found it hard to control herself. She leaned against his chest, having him massage her muscles and bones to relieve her fatigue.

"This time, I have practiced internally during seclusion, making up for the previous regression. Judging by this situation, after a few more sessions, I can break through the technique."

After this day, practicing in seclusion became a regular occurrence.

Madam Wen used to practice the Silkworm Robe Flawed Jade Technique with a calm, unperturbed heart, even with a hint of annoyance. Now, she was growing to like it more and more.

When they were not in seclusion, the two combined their swords, inseparable as glue and paint.

Although Li Xian was tempted, he always wanted to go out of the manor to travel, catch criminals, and refine his martial arts skills.

Although it was winter, it felt like early spring.

Madam Wen's willow-like eyebrows were graceful, and her pretty face was full of charm, showing her pleasant mood. She had several thoughts of going to the Southern Frontier to obtain a Gu worm. But seeing the continuous snow and the severe cold, and thinking that the Silkworm Robe Flawed Jade Technique was about to break through, it was not easy to act rashly.

So she temporarily suppressed the idea, planning to deal with the Gu worm after her miraculous technique broke through.

"I reckon he wouldn't dare to have any disloyal thoughts," Madam Wen murmured with a smile. "The Heart-Gu is just a safeguard. Even without that Gu, I can still capture your heart and capture you."

They exited and entered seclusion several times.

The lotus flowers were about to bloom, and the momentum of spring was brewing. The taste of this was indescribable.

On this day.

Amidst her coquettish, shy, and joyful scolding, Madam Wen drove Li Xian away. Li Xian roamed the manor and passed by the courtyard of the guard compound.

Seeing the guards all whittling wood, he asked, "What are you all whittling wood for?"

The guard commander, Ding Hu, quickly stepped forward and said, "Lord Li, it is now the end of the eleventh month. According to previous years, it should be time for the winter hunt. The brothers are making bows from wood, hoping to achieve good results in the winter hunt."

Li Xian suddenly remembered this matter. The winter hunt was beneficial and harmless. First, it could temper one's fighting spirit. Second, it could hunt fierce beasts, reducing the tragic incidents of beasts eating people. Third, it could sell the beasts for money.

He pondered secretly:

"Being with the Madam all day, I have inevitably lost some of a man's fighting spirit. In previous years, the winter hunt would have already started by now. This year, I haven't heard the Madam mention it. Is it because the time is not yet right? I am also itching to go hunting in the mountains and show my skills."

He truly did not know that the Madam had long forgotten about the winter hunt.

Several days later, the Madam used her voice transmission with condensed energy, indicating she was about to exit seclusion.

Li Xian immediately went up the tower to help the Madam remove her silkworm robe and took the opportunity to ask, "Madam, is there a winter hunt this year?"

Madam Wen glanced out the window at the drifting snow. "If you hadn't mentioned it, I would have forgotten. It's a bit late, but it doesn't matter."

Madam Wen rubbed her wrists, tracing the marks left by the bindings, and said, "Xiao Xian, go inform them that the winter hunt will be in three days. The guards will assemble at Bear and Tiger Mountain."

"Alright!" Li Xian agreed.

Three days passed in the blink of an eye.

Hundreds of guards held bows and arrows, and fur bags for storing meat were distributed. The atmosphere was lively, and they were discussing the winter hunt.

Ding Hu briefly explained the rules, saying, "Every year for the winter hunt, the Madam personally attends. You all must perform well so the Madam can see."

A newly arrived Class C guard asked, "Commander Ding, I heard that Lord Li, the Martial Captain, rose to prominence through the winter hunt?"

Ding Hu became enthusiastic and said, "That's right. I remember back then, Lord Li was just like you, a Class C guard. He dared to venture into the inner area and hunt tigers and bears... His performance was outstanding, and he was favored by the Madam. That's how he has today's glory."

"Truly enviable," the guards sighed in unison.

"That's why," Ding Hu said, "I usually tell you to practice martial arts and not forget to hone your archery skills. It is for this reason."

"I hunted a tiger last year, haha, this year I'm striving to hunt a bear!"

Suddenly, they heard a disturbance from behind, and a faint beast roar was heard. The guards exclaimed, "Commander Ding, there's a bear, a giant bear!"

The bear beast came out of the mountain with a furious momentum. A giant bear, nearly two zhang tall with sharp claws, pounded its chest and charged at the crowd.

The guards exclaimed repeatedly but were not panicked. They scattered and fled while looking at Ding Hu, waiting for his command.

Ding Hu said, "Excellent, this will be my first bear beast." Eager to try, he immediately nocked an arrow and shot it with condensed energy.

The black bear was large yet nimble, dodging the arrow. It ran wildly on all fours. Ding Hu analyzed: "This bear is tall, but it's flesh and blood. If I shoot a few more arrows, I can take it down."

He shot while retreating. The first three arrows were all dodged, and he secretly cursed the black bear for being cunning. The fourth arrow finally hit, but it failed to break the skin, producing a crisp 'bang' sound.

Ding Hu then woke up with a start: "It's a Scale-Armored Bear!" This was a rare species among bears, with scales attached under its black fur, making its skin thick and flesh tough. An ordinary martial artist might not be its match.

Ding Hu shouted, "Form the formation!" Several Class A and Class B guards immediately arranged a formation. They threw a specially made iron net, containing sharp hooks, to cover the giant Scale-Armored Bear.

Several people stood firm with condensed energy. The other guards held swords, axes... and engaged the giant bear in close combat, relying on their numbers.

However, the opponent was impervious to blades and spears. Class C guards were like tickling, Class B guards could only damage its fur. The Class A guards used the iron net to jointly restrain it.

After a fight for a while.

Just as the guards were out of ideas, they suddenly saw an arrow shooting from afar. This arrow came from an extremely distant place, as if from several miles away.

With a 'ding' sound, it hit the Scale-Armored Bear's chest. Sparks flew, and the giant bear was forced back three steps. The flying arrow broke, leaving only a shallow dent on its chest.

The Scale-Armored Bear roared in anger. Before it could steady itself, the second arrow had already arrived, hitting the exact same spot.

"What a magnificent archery technique!" Ding Hu cried out in shock.

The power of the two arrows combined was enough to break through the armor and pierce the flesh, causing blood to splatter. The Scale-Armored Bear's beast nature was provoked. It pulled out the arrow and looked around, trying to lock onto the direction of the powerful enemy.

The third arrow shot through the air. It precisely shot into the blood hole on the giant bear's chest. This time, there was no scale armor to block it, and its momentum was unstoppable. It actually pierced straight through!

The giant bear bled like a river and fell to the ground, powerless.

"Excellent archery!"

A voice of praise rang out.

On a distant mountain path, Madam Wen lightly clapped her hands, her eyes full of praise. The two rode side by side, their appearances outstanding, like a divine couple.

Li Xian wore a green robe, a long bow on his back, his long hair tied up, and a simple bronze crown. He held his head high and his chest out, with an extraordinary heroic bearing.

Madam Wen rode a white horse, wearing a green dress. The dress was embroidered with exquisite patterns, her long hair coiled up, and a delicate golden hairpin.

A precious bow hung by the saddle, adorned with yellow jade ornaments.

Radiant with jewels, her nobility was beyond words.

Ding Hu said in alarm, "Ma... Madam!" The guards followed suit, cupping their fists in salute and stepping aside.

Madam Wen nodded slightly and spoke to Li Xian again: "Just now, the three arrows—one broke the armor, one broke the skin, and one took its life. They were very beautiful. If I didn't know your background, I would have thought you were a descendant of a divine archer."

Li Xian said cheerfully, "When I was young, I hunted in the mountains. My archery is indeed passable."

They gradually rode to the front of the guards.

Madam Wen saw that the guards were assembled and asked, "Do you all know the rules?"

Ding Hu stepped forward and said, "We all know."

The Madam raised her hand to signal the start of the winter hunt. The guards' spirits soared, and they entered the mountains one after another to hunt. Li Xian fastened his bow and arrows and was about to enter the mountain when Madam Wen suddenly called out to him.

"Madam, is there something else?" Li Xian asked.

Madam Wen laughed lightly: "In previous years' winter hunts, I always went alone. It was very lonely. Your archery is already quite good. How about competing with me this year?"

Li Xian said, "Madam's strength is far beyond my reach."

"Don't worry," Madam Wen smiled. "I will only use archery and will not use any other means. I'll give you a nine-point head start, and the gap will not be large."

"If you win, I will reward you handsomely."

"But if you lose miserably, I will punish you severely."
