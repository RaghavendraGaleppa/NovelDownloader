# Chapter 226: The Snipe and the Clam

While Elder Lü was still pondering how to break the formation, Jue Tu Buddha caught up.

Jue Tu Buddha didn't use any spiritual artifacts—his killing intent was his strongest weapon. He lunged at Elder Lü, with killing intent forming sharp blades on each of his fingers.

Elder Lü shook his head, dodging Jue Tu Buddha's attack while summoning a flying sword before him. 

If there was one advantage Elder Lü retained while suppressing his cultivation, it was his ability to still wield a magic treasure. He didn't use his primary treasure—as a Golden Core elder of a major sect, he naturally possessed more than one.

Flying swords weren't exclusive to sword cultivators. Due to the strength of sword cultivators and the techniques some non-sword cultivators had gleaned from their methods over countless years, flying swords had become one of the mainstream magical tools in the cultivation world.

Elder Lü's flying sword wasn't particularly powerful, but it was more than sufficient to deal with Foundation Establishment cultivators. Even if Jue Tu Buddha had half the strength of a Golden Core cultivator, he was still at the Foundation Establishment level. Without surpassing this threshold, he couldn't comprehend the true might of a Golden Core cultivator.

Of course, Elder Lü couldn't wield the flying sword without restraint. He could only unleash one-tenth of its power—any more would break his suppression of cultivation.

The moment the flying sword appeared, Jue Tu Buddha became alert. Though influenced by killing intent, he wasn't a fool. While his body was driven by bloodlust, his Buddhist heart kept him clear-headed—otherwise, he would have long succumbed to endless slaughter.

"You're a Golden Core cultivator!" Jue Tu Buddha rasped.

Elder Lü didn't respond, merely accelerating the flying sword toward him.

Seeing the approaching weapon, Jue Tu Buddha suddenly struck his own chest and spat out a mouthful of blood—not red, but a terrifying black that writhed unnaturally, as if from the depths of hell.

Elder Lü hadn't anticipated this move. The flying sword was already in front of Jue Tu Buddha when the black blood splattered onto it. The sword froze mid-air, and Elder Lü felt as though his mind had been struck by a hammer.

The killing intent within the black blood invaded the sword, corroding the spiritual imprints inside. Ordinary killing intent couldn't achieve this—Jue Tu Buddha had used his heart's essence blood, expending over a decade of accumulated effort in a single strike.

Jue Tu Buddha knew full well that if he didn't severely injure this Golden Core cultivator while his power was suppressed, he wouldn't just fail his mission from Qianye Temple—he might not even survive.

Thus, he went all out from the start. Even Elder Lü hadn't expected such a desperate move so soon.

Jue Tu Buddha's temperament was extreme—without such a disposition, he could never have achieved mastery in the path of killing to attain Buddhahood.

Upon realizing Elder Lü was a Golden Core cultivator, Jue Tu Buddha employed one of his few abilities capable of affecting a Golden Core treasure.

Elder Lü was in agony. The flying sword was connected to his mind, and the damage to its spiritual imprints rebounded onto his consciousness. Had he wielded it at full Golden Core strength, Jue Tu Buddha would never have succeeded.

But with his cultivation suppressed to late Foundation Establishment, the flying sword, while far stronger than spiritual artifacts in power, offered little extra defense against mental attacks. 

Moreover, Jue Tu Buddha had used a secret technique proven by Qianye Temple to affect Golden Core treasures. This single strike wounded Elder Lü's spirit.

Without hesitation, Jue Tu Buddha lunged again. Elder Lü dodged instinctively—his combat experience was so vast that even reflexive movements could evade such attacks.

After over a dozen failed attempts, Jue Tu Buddha realized this approach was useless. A Golden Core elder of the Senluo Sect was no ordinary opponent.

Watching from the side, Li Yuanba and his true body, Li Shiming, were stunned. Li Shiming had considered himself and his avatar formidable among Foundation Establishment cultivators, but witnessing this battle made him realize how naive he'd been.

Elder Lü's suppressed flying sword strikes were far stronger than Li Shiming's talisman treasures, which typically held only a fraction of a treasure's power and required several breaths to prepare. Elder Lü's sword was like an infinitely reusable talisman treasure with even greater power.

Yet, Jue Tu Buddha had neutralized it with a single spit of blood.

Elder Lü clearly avoided direct confrontation with Jue Tu Buddha's attacks—if he could withstand them, he would have fought head-on.

"I will force you to reveal your Golden Core strength. The moment you do, you're dead!" Jue Tu Buddha hissed, his eyes crimson.

"I don't wish to fight you. I'm only here for the cultivator in the formation. There's no need for us to battle to the death," Elder Lü said, frustrated. Losing a treasure meant a lengthy re-refinement process—this venture was already a loss.

"Exchanging my life for yours is worth it," Jue Tu Buddha replied cryptically.

His killing intent suddenly receded, but black blood seeped from his eyes, nose, and mouth. His aura surged, teetering on the edge of Golden Core strength but never quite crossing it.

This life-draining secret technique brought him closer to Golden Core power. With Elder Lü present, Jue Tu Buddha saw no way to complete his mission—so he resolved to trade his life for a Golden Core cultivator's.

His fanatical mindset left no room for negotiation or retreat. Once decided, he focused solely on forcing Elder Lü to reveal his true strength, knowing nearby Golden Core monks would execute him the moment he did.

As Jue Tu Buddha's speed increased, Elder Lü gritted his teeth and summoned a jade ruler covered in sinister black runes—his lifebound treasure.

He hadn't wanted to use it in this state, but he had no choice. The ruler expanded mid-air, and two ghostly hands emerged, seizing Jue Tu Buddha.

Unfazed, Jue Tu Buddha spat more black blood onto the ruler. Lifebound treasures were far more resistant to such attacks, and Elder Lü only grimaced slightly this time.

"Mid-Golden Core?!" Jue Tu Buddha exclaimed, shocked his blood had no effect.

Mid-Golden Core cultivators were rare—most stalled at the early stage.

"Suppress!" Elder Lü commanded, forcing the ruler downward. Jue Tu Buddha was pinned effortlessly, his struggles futile. Despite repeated attempts to taint the ruler, it held firm.

Elder Lü exhaled in relief—he'd nearly lost control of his suppressed cultivation.

"Good. An unexpected prize—you'll make an excellent refined corpse," he mused, smiling at the pinned monk.

Using his lifebound treasure to subdue a Foundation Establishment cultivator was embarrassing, but with no witnesses aside from the soon-to-be-silenced Li Yuanba, it didn't matter.

Jue Tu Buddha's century-cultivated killing intent was utterly subdued—proof of the Senluo Sect's expertise. While Qianye Temple specialized in killing to attain Buddhahood, demonic sects truly mastered the study of killing intent, unconstrained by morality.

The jade ruler's suppression was absolute. No matter how Jue Tu Buddha struggled, he couldn't force Elder Lü to reveal Golden Core strength. With a finger to his forehead, the monk died in bitter frustration.

Elder Lü carefully stored the corpse in a thumb-sized coffin that expanded to accommodate it. Retrieving his damaged flying sword, he turned to Li Yuanba.

"You're smart enough to know why I'm here," he said coolly.

Li Yuanba nodded, producing the Jade Foot Relic. Sensing its immense Buddhist power, Elder Lü's eyes gleamed with greed.

"If you want it, trade for it," Li Yuanba said, tossing the relic casually.

"What do you want?" Elder Lü suppressed his anger. He had no intention of letting Li Yuanba live, but first, he needed the secret of the "Lotus Steps" divine movement technique.

"I see you're skilled with refined corpses. How about giving me a silver corpse? Surely skipping one grade isn't too much to ask?" Li Yuanba demanded boldly.

Impossible. Silver corpses possessed Golden Core strength—forbidden on this battlefield. Even if Elder Lü had one, he'd never part with a key combat asset, nor empower Li Yuanba to resist him.

"Out of the question. I'll offer the 'Moonlight Corpse Scroll'—a refinement technique leading to golden corpses—plus this kill-Buddha corpse. You could forge a near-Golden Core corpse, with potential to upgrade it further," Elder Lü countered.

He didn't care about the terms—everything would soon be his again. He even tossed over a purple jade slip and the coffin.

Li Yuanba manipulated the formation to receive the items while keeping it sealed. Elder Lü remained still, feigning sincerity to coax out more information.
