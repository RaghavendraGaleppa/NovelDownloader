# Chapter 109: Superior-Grade Treasure Embryo

As he spoke, Liu Lizhi's movements never ceased. 

His spiritual power suddenly began to boil, threads of spiritual light filling his entire body as he formed hand seals. In an instant, a brilliant golden light slowly rose behind him, floating in mid-air according to his will as if brewing something.

After a few breaths, the object within the golden light gradually revealed its true form—a golden brick the size of a palm. As Liu activated it, intricate Dao restriction patterns began to emerge on the brick's surface.

With a pointed finger from Liu, the restrictions on the golden brick flared brightly before spinning rapidly, subtly connecting with the spiritual energy within several miles. The light dimmed abruptly.

"Grow! Grow! Grow!"

The palm-sized brick expanded instantly to several zhang in size, transforming into a streak of golden light that shot toward the savage bear's head and smashed down with tremendous force.

"Roar!"

The bear let out a furious howl, its massive eyes blazing with ferocity. Instead of dodging, it raised its pillar-thick arms high. Waves of earthen-yellow spiritual light spread from its heart, quickly covering its entire body.

Boom—!

A dull, thunderous impact shook the ground.

The bear staggered, blood trickling from the corner of its mouth, the yellow spiritual light covering its body dimming slightly. Clearly, blocking this strike had not been easy.

Yet at this moment, the bear's thick paws clamped down tightly on the golden brick.

Seeing this, Liu Lizhi unleashed another surge of spiritual power, causing the brick to struggle violently between the bear's claws.

Just then—

"Haha, Senior Brother Liu, your treasure embryo seems rather unwieldy. Allow me to show you my Three Talents Thousand Mountains Formation."

From another direction, Yang Bai chuckled as his spiritual power erupted. Three streaks of light shot from his sleeves—three small banners that transformed into lightning bolts, instantly encircling the bear in a triangular formation.

The earth's spiritual energy surged continuously toward the banners, making their glow increasingly intense.

The air grew heavy.

A terrifying pressure suddenly weighed down indiscriminately on everything within the formation. The ground began to collapse as the bear's savage eyes filled with pain.

Amidst a series of cracking sounds, its massive frame slowly began to hunch over.

"Roar! Roar!"

The bear howled in agony, one cry after another. Refusing to yield, it strained to stand upright before suddenly opening its maw and spewing forth a yellow-brown demonic wind.

Whoosh—!

The howling wind tore through the formation, carrying a nauseating stench as it swept toward Zhang Jing and the other two.

Liu Lizhi's expression changed. "This demonic wind can corrupt treasures and corrode flesh—be careful!"

"Senior Brother, leave this to me."

Zhang Jing stepped forward.

A bone-chilling, desolate cold spread from beneath his feet.

"Roar!"

A draconic roar, as if from ancient primordial times, echoed through the air.

Opposite them, the bear's eyes, filled with bloodlust, flickered with rare fear. It tried to retreat but was firmly trapped by the formation, unable to escape.

Clang! Clang!

The sound of metal scraping rang out abruptly.

An enormous, pitch-black flood dragon slowly materialized beside Zhang Jing, its icy reptilian gaze locked onto the bear as it surged forward.

The moment the black flood dragon appeared, faint traces of Lunar Yin energy manifested, seemingly intent on freezing everything. The foul yellow demonic wind was instantly encased in ice by the flood dragon's energy, shattering into glittering shards that scattered across the ground before vanishing.

Undeterred, the black flood dragon continued its charge toward the bear.

Moments later—

Thud!

The bear's mountainous body collapsed with a heavy thud.

Simultaneously, the black flood dragon's form gradually faded.

"Junior Brother, that was incredible!" Yang Bai approached Zhang Jing, admiration in his voice.

Now he truly understood just how monstrous his junior brother's growth speed was. When Zhang Jing had first arrived at the Eighth Virtual Heaven, his strength had been noticeably inferior to Yang Bai and Liu Lizhi's, roughly on par with second-tier guardian spirits.

But now, Zhang Jing had already caught up.

And this was after just one month!

Yang Bai couldn't help but give Zhang Jing a deep, searching look.

He couldn't shake the feeling that Zhang Jing's talent in comprehending the Lunar Flood Dragon Dao Intent was beyond comprehension.

"Is a one-foot affinity really that terrifying?" Yang Bai wondered silently.

Meanwhile, Zhang Jing was silently communicating with the Dao mark in his palm.

[Spiritual Essence: +50,000]  
[Total Spiritual Essence: 503,700]

He nodded slightly before shaking his head, seemingly dissatisfied with having only gained 500,000 Spiritual Essence over the past three days.

Just then—

"Junior Brother, come quickly! It's a superior-grade treasure embryo!" Liu Lizhi called out excitedly from nearby.

Hearing this, Zhang Jing's expression smoothed as he strode over.

A dozen breaths later, he picked up the treasure embryo from the ground, and a stream of information appeared before him:

[Superior-Grade Treasure Embryo: Mountain-Shaking Seal]

A flicker of surprise crossed Zhang Jing's eyes.

---

Two days later, the trio returned to their gathering spot.

The so-called gathering spot was rather rudimentary—just a few caves dug into the cliffs of a valley. The Eighth Virtual Heaven wasn't densely populated; across all three Dao Academies, there were fewer than fifty people. For their Dragon Lake Dao Academy alone, the number was even smaller—only nineteen, including Zhang Jing.

Naturally, there was no need for anything elaborate.

Inside the cave:

[Spiritual Essence: 815,300]

Zhang Jing's eyes gleamed faintly.

With a thought, the illusory jade talisman appeared before him:

[Lunar Flood Dragon Dao Intent (143/1000)]

Five days ago, Zhang Jing had visited the Ten Thousand Treasures Repository. Thanks to his ample Spiritual Essence reserves, he had directly elevated his comprehension of the Lunar Flood Dragon Dao Intent beyond the ten percent threshold.

It felt as though he had crossed an invisible barrier.

The power of his Dao Intent had surged dramatically compared to before, and he could now even summon a faint wisp of Lunar Yin energy.

However, this level was still far from sufficient to clear the ninth layer of the Heavenly Stairway and ascend to the Ninth Virtual Heaven. He estimated needing at least another month—perhaps even longer.

Currently, in the Eighth Virtual Heaven, Zhang Jing could accumulate between six to seven million Spiritual Essence per month. If he dedicated all of it to comprehending Dao Intent, he would only gain about seventy points of progress.

His brows furrowed.

Too slow!

Only five months remained before the closure of the Ten Thousand Gods Minor Virtual Heaven. And he still needed a month just to reach the Ninth Virtual Heaven.

Which meant—

He would have a mere three to four months to traverse the Ninth Virtual Heaven and enter the Tenth.

No matter how he calculated it, time was insufficient.

He couldn't possibly rely solely on that inheritance being in the Ninth Virtual Heaven, could he?

And there was another possibility—one Zhang Jing hardly dared consider.

What if it was in the Eleventh Virtual Heaven?

The thought he had entertained earlier resurfaced.

Perhaps the only solution was to use the River of Time Gold Sand to forcibly elevate the Pure Origin Breath Absorption Visualization Art to the Seed of Law stage ahead of schedule. The monthly Spiritual Essence gains in the Eighth Virtual Heaven should suffice.

Once achieved, it would significantly boost his Dao Intent comprehension speed and efficiency—unlike the current situation, where he had to expend 100,000 Spiritual Essence for a single point of progress.

Ah, right—there was also the Five Treasures Spiritual River!
