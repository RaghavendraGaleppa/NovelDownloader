# Chapter 79: Buddha's Light, Holy Child

"Venerable Lord, please accept us!" the white-haired elder and the others respectfully stated.

"I only have a middle-grade spiritual root. Do you truly believe I can become a True Disciple?" Yang Ji calmly looked at the crowd and suddenly counter-questioned.

The white-haired elder and the others exchanged glances. "Venerable Lord's comprehension is unparalleled; becoming a True Disciple is only a matter of time."

"It is our honor and fortune to be able to undertake this mission with a genius like Venerable Lord. We know our talents are lacking; if it were any other time, we would never have the courage to speak of following Venerable Lord."

"We know this is the only chance we have to approach Venerable Lord. If we miss it, Venerable Lord and we will be like the heavenly stars and earthly stones, never to intersect."

"Therefore, we mustered our courage, hoping to seize this sole opportunity. We humbly ask Venerable Lord to show us mercy and accept us."

Everyone lowered their heads and bowed deeply.

Yang Ji observed them calmly. Seeing no unusual information appear above their heads, he paused for three breaths, then mused:

"After so many years of cultivation, this is the first time I've met people who wish to follow me. Very well, let me ask you: are you sincere in your desire to follow me?"

"Our lives were brought back by Venerable Lord; we swear to follow Venerable Lord until death, with no second thoughts!" the white-haired elder and the others firmly stated.

"Perhaps this is a preordained destiny. Since you have this intention, then in the long path of immortality ahead, we shall help each other!" Yang Ji said, looking at everyone.

"Thank you, Venerable Lord. We are willing to serve you like dogs and horses." The white-haired elder and the others exchanged glances, their faces beaming with joy, and bowed deeply once more.

Yang Ji nodded, accepting it naturally.

Times were different now. As his strength grew, he had to learn to adapt to the halo and benefits that came with being a "genius." Yang Ji would not feign modesty and avoid it.

This was the confidence of a strong cultivator, and also the responsibility he shouldered by accepting the title "Venerable Lord."

"Alright, you may rise," Yang Ji said calmly.

"Thank you, Venerable Lord," everyone slowly straightened up.

The white-haired elder then said, "Venerable Lord, the Eight Profound City Lord is dead. How should we deal with the wicked Minor Holy Medicine they cultivated?"

"It's gone," the powerfully dressed girl suddenly said.

"Gone?" Everyone looked towards the altar, finding it empty.

The powerfully dressed girl slowly floated up, two divine lights shooting from her eyes, scanning every corner of the secret chamber.

Yang Ji was also walking through the secret chamber at this moment, his gaze sharp, his eyes scanning the surroundings, searching for traces of the Demonic Mushroom.

*Whoosh!*

Suddenly, a piercing sound of air being torn echoed.

Everyone turned their heads, discovering a palm-sized black shadow darting out from under a piece of tattered cloth, fleeing at extreme speed, its pace no less than that of an ordinary Golden Core Realm cultivator.

"Trying to escape? Not so easy!"

Yang Ji's figure flickered several times, leaving a trail of afterimages, and he eerily appeared at the entrance of the secret chamber, blocking the fleeing black shadow.

The black shadow was indeed the Demonic Mushroom. Seeing its path blocked, a fearful child's face emerged on its cap.

Facing Yang Ji, its expression was filled with unspeakable terror. Its stalk transformed into legs, and it immediately bolted again.

*Whoosh!*

Its speed was so great that only a faint black line could be seen. It seemed it had unleashed its full power to survive.

"Where do you think you're going? Come here obediently!"

Yang Ji extended a single hand, and his True Qi transformed into a large hand, enveloping the Demonic Mushroom.

The Demonic Mushroom let out a whimper, fleeing while peeking back, its eyes surprisingly showing an intent to beg for mercy. Amidst its terror, there was also a human-like cunning.

Swaying and rocking, it drifted like a ghost, perfectly dodging Yang Ji's outstretched True Qi hand.

"Hm? This fellow even knows movement techniques?" Yang Ji was slightly surprised. He abruptly unleashed his Sword Domain, countless air currents transforming into flying swords that pressed forward, sealing and surrounding it.

The Demonic Mushroom felt the boundless sword intent and was utterly terrified.

It wanted to escape, but a powerful sword intent had already enveloped it. The surrounding air-swords pressed in. Even if its tiny legs twisted into knots on the spot, it dared not take a single step forward.

One must know that this terrifying sword intent could even kill a Demonic Sect Daoist. It had witnessed that scene with its own eyes.

Fear arrived as expected. The Sword Domain rapidly shrunk, completely trapping it.

Yang Ji timely extended his True Qi large hand and grabbed it.

Knowing it couldn't escape, the Demonic Mushroom stopped struggling. Its body slightly shrunk, and its eyes surprisingly revealed a deep pitifulness.

"This Demonic Mushroom has such strong sentience," the white-haired elder leaned closer, surprised.

"Minor Holy Medicines can communicate with people through telepathy, so it's natural for them to have sentience," the powerfully dressed girl said, not surprised.

"Although this Yin-attributed Minor Holy Medicine is a bit wicked, it is an excellent material for refining 'Yin Corrosion Pills.' These pills are great for improving cultivation. If Venerable Lord refines and consumes it, your cultivation will surely advance significantly," the white-haired elder said.

"Your grandpa, *you're* wicked! Your other grandpa, *you're* the excellent material for refining 'Yin Corrosion Pills!'" The Demonic Mushroom suddenly spewed profanities, causing everyone to be momentarily stunned. "It can talk! Is it a Holy Medicine with intelligence?"

"No, it's not a Holy Medicine." Yang Ji saw clearly that this was indeed a Minor Holy Medicine. As it spoke, he saw the words `[Super strong intelligence born from absorbing countless cultivators' soul fragments]` appear above its head.

"It seems the Blood Refining Grand Array not only refined the cultivators' flesh and blood essence but also their souls, which is why it developed such powerful intelligence," Yang Ji calmly stated.

"No wonder! I was wondering how a Minor Holy Medicine could speak. A Yin-attributed Minor Holy Medicine with such intelligence, if refined into a pill, its effects would surely be even better!" The white-haired elder's eyes suddenly lit up.

"You old geezer, look carefully! I am not a Yin-attributed Minor Holy Medicine, nor am I a wicked Minor Holy Medicine. Amitābha, Buddha is merciful!"

The Demonic Mushroom's resentful gaze instantly turned calm and placid, like an old monk in meditation, its demeanor changing dramatically.

Golden Buddha's light actually emanated from its head, appearing mysterious yet ancient and majestic, solemn and dignified.

At this moment, the Demonic Mushroom no longer had any trace of "demonic" presence; it had transformed into a miniature child glowing with Buddha's light.

Its fierceness vanished, replaced by a radiant cuteness, bright eyes, and pearly white teeth. Its entire body was enveloped in sacred light, making it supremely divine.

At this very moment, it bore no semblance of a demonic creature. Its ethereal and refined aura surprisingly surpassed everyone present.

It lightly clasped its hands, enveloped in Buddha's light, and revealed a gentle smile, saying to Yang Ji and the others, "Greetings, benevolent patrons."

Its serene expression and dignified demeanor were like that of an enlightened Buddha.

"Unbelievable! This fellow can even shapeshift and use illusions to deceive people," the white-haired elder and others exclaimed in astonishment, marveling aloud.

Only Yang Ji, seeing this scene, had his pupils contract slightly. He actually saw the words `[Buddhist Scripture]` above the head of the small child that the Demonic Mushroom had transformed into. This was not an illusion at all, but a Buddhist scripture.

"Could it be that the Blood Refining Grand Array not only refined the cultivators' flesh, blood essence, and soul intelligence, but also refined others' cultivation techniques for it to cultivate? What an immense fortune this Demonic Mushroom has!"

Yang Ji was secretly astonished.
