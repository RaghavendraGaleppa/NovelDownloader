Chapter 350: Meeting the Love-Stricken, the Flower Thief Li Xian

The disciples speaking were named Niu Er, Tie San, and Hu Daluo.

Hu Daluo fawned, "You see, you're being modest again. That big event shook the Flying Dragon City; it was your chance to make a name for yourself. Yet you ask us. Our Flower Cage Sect has always been hunted by everyone; we've never had such prestige. Thinking back now, it truly makes us proud!"

Seeing Li Xian's expression turn cold, as if he might strike, Hu Daluo immediately said, "Now, the rumors say it was you, Master Li, who captured the female relatives of the Sword Sect. They say you are ruthless and eccentric, imprisoning the women in a dark room, doing all sorts of things to humiliate them. It was so heinous that even the gods and men were angered!"

Li Xian's eyebrow twitched, and he held his patience to listen further. Hu Daluo continued:

"Later, because the Sword Sect exerted its power and Flying Dragon City went into lockdown, you were forced to release the women. You stood atop the city wall, unafraid of the siege, and boldly declared that you laughed at all the heroes under heaven. You told the Five Great Sword Sects that in this world, there is no woman Li Xian cannot capture. Who says the Flower Cage Sect has no heroes? Who says the Flower Cage Sect has no豪杰? I, Li Xian, shall surpass you all. It was truly extremely imposing at the time."

Li Xian's face darkened. "Nonsense! When did I ever do such things or say such things? You speak with such certainty; did you witness it yourself?"

Niu Er scratched his head. "Although I didn't see it with my own eyes, many elders said that although you are young, you have the potential of a great flower thief, with skills and methods far superior to theirs. You might become the youngest elder of the Flower Cage Sect. These things are probably not wrong."

Li Xian asked solemnly, "How far has this rumor spread?" Tie San said, "Anyway, it's known to everyone in the Flower Cage Sect. Your prestige has already surpassed that of Elders Ye Cheng and others.恐怕要不了多久, after some more brewing, you'll be famous throughout the world!"

The disciples looked excited. Li Xian pondered the situation and understood the reason. The Five Mountain Sword Alliance had escaped the tomb and captured He Wentian. They didn't know how to deal with him properly. If they tore their faces apart, it would affect the whole situation, and Flying Dragon City would inevitably fall into chaos.

They decided to suppress it and deal with it secretly. Naturally, what He Wentian did could not be publicized. The leader of the expedition issued a decree forbidding discussion of the tomb's affairs. To avoid trouble, the Sword Sect disciples were not allowed to leave the sect. In this way, the outside world speculated endlessly, and the blame naturally fell on Li Xian's head.

Later, the lockdown of Flying Dragon City was lifted, and the Flower Cage Sect fled the city. The rumors spread, with some harboring ulterior motives and wanting to ruin Li Xian by excessive praise, and others feeling proud and vain. The rumors were passed on and on, with everyone adding fuel to the fire, and eventually, trouble arose from nothing.

Li Xian sighed inwardly: "My reputation is truly ruined. Well, it's just a false reputation, why care too much? However, if I want to return to the Water Altar of the Flower Cage Sect, I still need to meet up with the other elders." He asked, "Are you the only ones here? Where are the other Flower Cage Sect disciples and elders?"

Hu Daluo smiled sheepishly. "At that time, the city was in chaos, and no one knew what was happening. We scattered and fled separately. We secretly inquired and recently got news of a meeting place. We can meet up tomorrow. Of course, now that we've met Elder Li, we naturally follow Elder Li's arrangements. If you tell us to go east, we won't go west. If you tell us to go west, we won't go east."

The disciples all flattered him, slapping their chests to show loyalty. Li Xian had no good feelings for them; he even wanted to tie them up and send them to the authorities for punishment. But to gather with the Flower Cage Sect, he needed these people. Li Xian said, "Tomorrow, you will lead the way. First, we will meet with the others, then we'll talk about other matters."

Hu Daluo happily agreed. He brought a bowl of hot porridge, bowed, and offered it with both hands, fawning, "Elder Li, we don't have anything good here, just a few bowls of hot porridge. Would you like to try it to warm up?"

Li Xian scanned the group and thought: "These few are truly hateful. Although they are flattering me now, speaking words of praise, behind my back, they specialize in deception and kidnapping, harming ordinary families. Although I won't kill them, if I let them off so easily, I wouldn't be willing." After thinking for a moment, he had an idea. He took the white porridge, took a light sip, jumped onto the altar to sit, and said leisurely, "You lot are quite sensible, and considered half useful talents. But you violated the sect rules. Since I have seen this, I cannot let it pass as if nothing happened. You eight form a circle and play a game of passing slaps. You must continue until someone faints."

The disciples gasped and wanted to flatter him to seek pity. Li Xian's style of acting was taught by Wen Caishang, with its own balance of interests and ruthless calculations. Having decided to punish them, he wouldn't soften and take it back. The disciples were extremely helpless. The eight formed a circle, passing slaps in turn, head to head, endlessly. The sound of "slaps" echoed through the broken temple.

Initially, they considered their relationships and didn't dare slap too hard, nor did they dare to be too light for fear of displeasing Li Xian and inviting heavier punishment. After one round, everyone was safe. But Niu Er was clumsy and once couldn't control his strength, making Hu Daluo's face swell. Hu Daluo gnashed his teeth in anger but couldn't slap Niu Er, so he vented his resentment on the next person. Friendship broke, and resentment grew. From then on, the slaps became louder and louder. Before slapping, they rolled up their sleeves, rubbed their shoulders, and twisted their wrists, slapping with all their might.

Finally, it evolved into a life-and-death struggle. Li Xian intervened, allowing only slaps, not physical fighting. The anger of the eight rose high, they looked at each other with hatred, and all their anger was directed at the person behind them.

Soon, their cheeks were red and swollen, skin broken and flesh torn, covered in palm prints and blood. At this point, without Li Xian's supervision, the eight were determined to slap each other into unconsciousness or death.

Two of them, who were physically weaker, less capable, and had ordinary martial arts, foamed at the mouth, their eyes rolled back, and they fainted from the slapping. The number of people decreased, the circle shrank, but the hatred became even stronger. The few formed a circle, passing slaps in order. The person behind slapped oneself, and oneself slapped the person in front. If they wanted to avenge the slaps, they had to slap all their opponents into unconsciousness, leaving only the two of them. Only then could they face each other and fully avenge their grievances.

The fewer the people, the deeper the hatred. When only three were left, they were extremely默契. One slap, one slap, without any hesitation. When the third person fainted, the remaining two had eyes burning with fire, slapping each other until their teeth were broken, eyes split, and noses crooked.

It was extremely tragic, and they were unrecognizable. In the end, Niu Er held out the longest. Li Xian said, "Since you won, taking care of them is your responsibility. Don't delay my journey." He lay横跨 on the altar, closed his eyes, and rested.

Niu Er didn't dare to disobey, but his teeth were broken, his tongue split, his eyes swollen, and his nose crooked, making it even harder for him to speak. He only made "uh uh" sounds and nodded slightly.

In this way, they stayed in the broken temple for half the night. When the night was deep, Hu Daluo, Tie San, and the others woke up one after another, all unable to speak, terrified of Li Xian. They believed even more in the rumors: this young man was ruthless in his methods, and his style of acting was heinous.

Li Xian closed his eyes and lightly slept, observing Wen Caishang's every move through his senses. The carriage was warm and cozy, the candlelight was extinguished, the charcoal fire glowed slowly, and it was extremely dim. Wen Caishang had been captured for many days and had already adapted. She took the opportunity to practice her martial arts internally, accumulating her martial arts foundation to make up for the recent loss. But when she was bored, she couldn't help but be extremely angry. She tried every way but couldn't escape, feeling even more dejected. From time to time, she arched her back and turned over, sweating profusely.

The enchanting scenery inside the carriage was seen only by Li Xian.

The next morning. Hu Daluo's face was wrapped in cloth, his head swollen like a pig, but he could already speak. He waited respectfully for Li Xian to wake up. The group headed to the meeting point and arrived at a vast lake. The shore was covered with green willows, green mountains stood tall, and clouds piled up. Several lines of swallows flapped their wings and flew away.

The scenery was beautiful. Hu Daluo told Li Xian that as far as he knew, the Flower Cage Sect would gather in the lake today. Li Xian looked at the lake scenery. Although it was beautiful, he couldn't help but frown: "Meeting in the lake is very disadvantageous for me. I am a second-rank martial artist; I sink as soon as I touch water. If the boat is destroyed, I will be passive. And what Hu Daluo said, I don't know if it's true or false. If it's a trap to lure me in and kill me, it would be bad. This point needs to be handled carefully."

He said, "You rent boats first, get a few fishing boats and ferries." After the crowd dispersed, he carefully weighed the pros and cons. "I have the Blue Water Pearl; I can protect myself if I fall into the water. But the lake water is deep. If I sink all the way down, even if I can breathe underwater, it would still be extremely troublesome. But I possess the Golden Light of the Dao of Arts. If I use it in the water, I don't know what effect it will have. If the effect is good, even if I go into the water, I can protect myself. And the Water Phantom and the Sinking River Sword are very effective on water. Even if it's a trap, I can protect myself. To return to the Water Altar as soon as possible, I need to take the risk and explore."

He immediately tried it. He took off his clothes, tied a rope around his waist, and tied the other end to a tree. He used his lightness skill and jumped into the lake. His body sank as soon as he touched the water. The lightness of his martial arts lightness skill dissipated. No matter how he waved his arms or treaded water, it was useless.

He could move left and right, but he couldn't float up half an inch. He could only keep sinking.

Li Xian施展ed 'Zhang Eight Golden Light', turning his whole body into a golden stream of light, flashing upwards. It really worked. He saw countless spots of light leap out of the lake surface, gathering in the air to form a shape. Li Xian's figure appeared, already standing on the lake surface. Then he stepped on the Seven Star Step and returned to the shore.

Li Xian pondered: "Using the Golden Light Art in the lake can indeed help me escape the water surface. But when used in the water, the water quality slightly hinders it. My Golden Light Art can flash two Zhang and eight Chi, but in the water, it can only barely reach two Zhang. And the specific direction is very difficult to control; there is always a slight deviation. It might be east, west, or south. But in any case, I can use the Dao of Arts to counter the sinking!"

[Dao of Arts · Golden Light]
[Proficiency: 4/100]

Li Xian was full of energy and jumped into the lake again. He used the lake to temper his Golden Light Art, the light flowing and flashing, changing endlessly. After using it seven times in a row, he felt his strength was not enough. Li Xian wanted to explore his limit and gritted his teeth to persist.

He learned that his limit was thirteen uses of the Golden Light Art. He jumped back to the shore, gasping for breath and resting. The 'Perfect Physique' was very powerful, recovering faster than others. Li Xian drank some clear water, ate some dry food, and put on his clothes properly. Looking at the vast lake surface again, he had some confidence.

He waited for the time it takes to burn a stick of incense. In the distance, he saw several plank boats. Hu Daluo, Tie San, Niu Er, etc., were steering the boats back. They waved to Li Xian. Li Xian leaped up, used his lightness skill, and boarded Hu Daluo's boat. He said, "Let's go, hurry to the meeting point."

Although he knew there might be danger, there is never a sure thing in the Jianghu. As long as he had a plan in mind, he could try it. Li Xian left the city late, and to return to the Water Altar, he still needed the elders to接应. He was thinking about Nan Gong Qiu Li.

Hu Daluo rowed the boat, and the lake area was wide. After about half an hour, he faintly saw several plank boats. Hu Daluo waved and shouted, "Are you brothers from the Flower Cage Sect?" His voice was unclear, but the meaning could be understood.

The other side replied, "Yes, yes!" Hu Daluo happily said, "Elder Li, shall we go over and meet them?"

Li Xian nodded in agreement. Hu Daluo steered the boat closer, and the two sides gathered. Seeing that the other side had three people, two steering the boat, and one looking into the distance. Li Xian exchanged pleasantries and identified their identities, then headed towards the agreed location.

Gradually, a small island came into view. The island was lush with vegetation, and the tree roots were messy and complex. Birds and beasts nested among the branches. Looking at it, there were hundreds or thousands of birds and beasts. Before landing, the noisy chirping of birds could be heard.

The boat docked, and Li Xian leaped up, landing on the island first. The land was soft and emitted a faint fishy smell. Dead fish and shrimp could be seen on the shore. Li Xian thought: "Although this is a lake, it also has tides. These dead fish and shrimp must have died on the island after the tide receded. It seems I cannot stay here for long."

Going deeper inside, he saw several rows of footprints. Some disciples had already arrived. Li Xian looked at the footprints and knew that about four or five people with considerable abilities had passed, either印花 disciples or elders.

Passing through a green barrier, he saw an open flat ground. There were dozens of disciples scattered around. In the distance, there was a wooden shed, inside which sat Elder Tang Wenshu of the Flower Cage Sect.

Tang Wenshu saw Li Xian and immediately walked over quickly, shouting, "Brother Li, I didn't expect to see you again! Seeing you safe, I'm truly relieved!" Li Xian cupped his hands. "Elder Tang! Thank you for your concern. Flying Dragon City was extremely dangerous; it's good to have escaped safely."

Tang Wenshu said, "Hahaha, after surviving a great disaster, there will be great fortune. You and I are protected by the Candle Teaching in the dark. What are small dangers and difficulties? Hahaha, speaking of which, Brother Li is rising like the sun; your future is immeasurable! Come, please come into the shed and wait."

He waved his sleeve. His trusted followers immediately understood and brought an extra wooden stool. Tang Wenshu poured a cup of tea and offered it. "Brother Li is a dragon and phoenix among men. Since I first saw you, I knew you were no ordinary person. As time tests a man's heart, a long journey tests a horse's strength... no, that doesn't sound quite right. Brother Li is like a dragon meeting the wind and clouds. Your reputation must be thunderous."

Li Xian gently sipped the tea. The tea aroma was weak, and the aftertaste was insufficient; it was ordinary tea. He wasn't particular about such things, and leisurely took a few sips. "That's all just a misunderstanding among the brothers in the sect. I am only a印花 disciple now. Besides, Elder Tang, you must know the truth of those rumors? The women of the Sword Sect were not captured by me."

Tang Wenshu laughed. "A good reputation or a bad one, it's still a reputation. We, the Flower Cage Sect, come from lowly backgrounds and engage in the lowest trades. How can we be clean? The rumors don't need to be true; as long as they can boost your reputation, they are not a bad thing."

Li Xian said, "A reputation is good to have, but I'm afraid more people will come to kill me." Tang Wenshu said, "That is true, but Brother Li is extremely alert and can handle it."

Tang Wenshu smiled. "If my guess is correct, on this return to the Altar, you will surely be promoted to elder. Then you will marry a beautiful wife, start a family, eat fine treasures, and seek the peak. Hahaha." He stroked his beard and laughed heartily.

He valued his appearance greatly. His beard was groomed soft and neat, and the way he stroked it was pleasing to the eye, even giving off an elegant and refined air.

Li Xian said, "Hahaha, that's far from comparable to Elder Tang, who has already married a beautiful wife, started a family, and eaten fine treasures. I, this junior, still have a long way to go." Tang Wenshu said, "Ai! The way you speak makes me feel embarrassed. I know my own abilities; my cultivation is not low, but my methods are shallow. Over the years, eating fine treasures and running businesses... I have practiced martial arts, but I haven't fought in a long time. Come, drink tea!"

The two laughed heartily and exchanged pleasantries, all flattery and formalities. Li Xian asked bluntly, "In that case, was this gathering organized by Elder Tang? After the Joyful Tower collapsed, did Elder Tang and Elder Ye have any encounters?"

Tang Wenshu was taken aback. Back then, when Flying Dragon City was in lockdown, Li Xian, Tang Wenshu, and Ye Cheng had潜潜 into the Joyful Tower to investigate. They were supposed to split up and explore the tower's secrets. Who knew that a sudden collapse would throw their plans into disarray. Li Xian went deep underground and had a series of entangled encounters. He had no time to think about the experiences of the other two. Now that they met here, he asked directly.

Tang Wenshu shook his head. "That's not the case. At that time, Flying Dragon City was in lockdown, the city's defenses were strict, and they were determined to exterminate the Flower Cage Sect. Our disciples were all in danger, panicked and helpless. At first, disciples who surrendered could still hope to save their lives. But later on, even if disciples surrendered, they had to endure a round of torture and severe punishment. Very few could endure it."

"Ye Cheng and I went to explore the Joyful Tower with you. The tower suddenly collapsed. Ye Cheng and I fled in a hurry and were not crushed by the tower. We saw a dark cave under the Joyful Tower. We figured that the women were in the cave. We were about to go down and check, but we saw soldiers from the city surrounding us. The Five Great Sword Sects were all gathered at the cave discussing."

"If we showed ourselves then, wouldn't it be dangerous? And because of the giant cave, the lockdown of the city gradually had loopholes. A few disciples saw the opportunity and were very lucky, actually managing to潜逃 out of the city. But there were also those whose identities were识破 and were killed on the spot."

"At that time, there were also Jianghu travelers who volunteered to eliminate evil for the people. They were everywhere, hunting down the Flower Cage Sect. The situation was still dangerous."

"Then Elder Ye Cheng said: 'The collapse of the Joyful Tower hides a strange matter. I suspect that He Wentian is not innocent. But our Flower Cage Sect should have self-knowledge; it's better not to participate in that strange matter. Now is the time to take the opportunity to leave. But traveling in groups is不利; it's better to break up and flee separately. Whoever escapes has the ability. After escaping the Flower Cage Sect, we can find a way to gather.' Many of us elders felt extremely helpless. This trip was originally to take advantage of the chaos to fish in troubled waters, but we ended up losing instead. But our lives were important. After discussing together, we all fled separately."

"The Flower Cage Sect was thus scattered. After I escaped safely, I was afraid of being追杀, so I kept a low profile for a while, not showing any trace of my movements. Until recently, the wind has gradually died down. And I heard news of the Flower Cage Sect gathering, so I came early."

Tang Wenshu explained clearly and then asked about Li Xian's situation. Li Xian briefly and simply told him about the underground cave, omitting the unimportant parts. After the two understood the general situation, Li Xian asked, "In that case, who issued the summons?"

Tang Wenshu said, "I suspect it was an elder who summoned them. He must have窥探ed this secret place beforehand. Then he found a way to spread the news. It might even be Ye Cheng."

Li Xian said strangely, "I don't think it's like him." Tang Wenshu asked, "Why not?"

Li Xian said, "If an elder summoned the gathering, why wouldn't he arrive early and wait? This doesn't make sense." Tang Wenshu heard this and also felt a sense of unease. "But the secret sign for the Flower Cage Sect gathering requires an elder to know. If it weren't an elder, who could quietly spread the news and let the Flower Cage Sect disciples accept the secret sign?"

Li Xian frowned. "I remember Elder An Weicheng has叛变. If he有意泄漏, then it's different."

As they were talking, a disciple came joyfully to report: "Elder Tang, there are many boats in the distance, probably all disciples of our Flower Cage Sect! Our Flower Cage Sect is gathering again, we don't have to fear those orthodox sects追杀 anymore."

Tang Wenshu ran to the shore and looked into the distance. He saw dense black spots in the distance, with many boats approaching. His heart tightened. He ran around the island and saw that the newcomers had formed a siege.

He knew that Li Xian's guess was correct; this was a trap to lure them in. He also saw the boats gradually tightening the encirclement,撒ing iron nets along the way. The boats were full of a group of Jianghu travelers, many holding knives, spears, and bows.

Then came the "rumble" and "rumble" sounds. Several Jianghu travelers unleashed their "Chest Bone Thunder Sound", showing off their might. The disciples sensed something was wrong and heard the thunderous sounds, their legs went weak, and they almost fell. They all looked at Tang Wenshu.

Tang Wenshu's movements of stroking his beard became hurried. Although his cultivation was deep, he was not calm when facing matters. His expression was flustered, and he felt at a loss for a moment. Suddenly thinking of Li Xian, he immediately looked up. The eyes of the disciples followed and all fell on Li Xian.

Li Xian remained calm, taking in the whole situation. He thought: "It seems this plan has been brewing for a long time and prepared for some time. I observe these围剿客, their clothing, temperament, and weapons are all different. They must be散客 from the Jianghu. There must be a very powerful高手 among them who can统筹 many Jianghu travelers."

"They are撒ing iron nets along the way, determined to布下 a sky-net. They probably won't attack急于ly. They just need to wait for the lake water to rise, and many Flower Cage Sect disciples will be submerged. Then they can fish them all out tomorrow."

Li Xian saw the boats moving very slowly and窥知 the enemy's plan. He observed the surrounding environment and thought of an escape plan. The enemy had about hundreds, while the Flower Cage Sect disciples had only dozens or nearly a hundred. If they fought on boats, the Flower Cage Sect would have difficulty forming a formation, their strength would be greatly insufficient, and they would definitely not be a match for the hundreds of Jianghu travelers.

The enemy had already expected this and结合ed the terrain to siege them. Li Xian remained as calm as ever and already had a plan in mind. He said, "Elder Tang, for now, waiting in despair has no way to survive. It's better to lead the disciples and charge out by boat; perhaps we can find a way to live." Elder Tang said, "Ah! Even you say so,看来 this situation is extremely dangerous! This... this..."

Li Xian smiled. "I am not a perfect person; how can I foresee everything? Walking in the Jianghu, one must adapt to the situation. And强行冲杀, it's not a reckless act with no plan, but a good plan to break the situation!"

Tang Wenshu saw that Li Xian was extremely calm, so he also calmed down. His cultivation was deep. If he wanted to escape, he was actually better than others. Although the enemy was numerous, they might not be able to留 him. So he said loudly, "Disciples, the enemy is cunning and designed to trap us. If we don't want to be at their mercy, let's架船杀出去 while there's still time!"

The disciples were naturally timid. Hearing Tang Wenshu's solemn words, they knew the situation was serious and were terrified and speechless. Hearing the distant thunder, before even fighting, their hands and feet went weak. To attack主动ly was like throwing an egg against a rock; it would surely be a dead end. They had no morale and looked at each other.

Seeing that the disciples would rather wait to die than fight, Tang Wenshu felt extremely helpless. Li Xian said loudly, "Brothers, if my guess is correct, among the many boats, there must be our brothers hiding secretly. Now is the time to charge early; there is a great possibility of浑水摸鱼. And although the enemy is numerous, they have not yet formed an encirclement; their numbers are scattered in all directions. We sail our boats and charge主动ly. The enemy's reinforcements will not arrive for a while. The number of people fighting on both sides is similar. This is what the enemy did not expect. Just take advantage of this time to break through. We can naturally保命. Every second we delay now, our lives become more dangerous. Think about the pros and cons yourselves; I don't need to say more."

"This opportunity is only once. If you don't cherish it, you will be剿杀. When the enemy gets closer, there will be no more hope. It's better to commit suicide on the spot."

The disciples were stunned upon hearing this. Thinking it over, it made sense. They picked up their weapons with doubt and drove their plank boats to charge. Li Xian rode alone on a plank boat, rowing and following the crowd to charge. A fierce battle unfolded on the lake surface.

The enemy was numerous, but as Li Xian had said, the Flower Cage Sect disciples charged towards one side. For a while, the boats in the distance could not assist and could only watch anxiously. If they强行援助, the encirclement would reveal flaws and the formation would be in great chaos. For a time, the number of people fighting in the lake was roughly equal. Although the Flower Cage Sect lost more than they won, many disciples broke through. Those who were not skilled in martial arts and had low martial arts ability were captured alive. Tang Wenshu and a few印花 disciples broke through one after another.

An Weicheng was indeed in the crowd. He targeted Tang Wenshu, and the two fought fiercely on the water, temporarily evenly matched.

Li Xian was even more勇猛难当. He sailed his boat out. A few Jianghu travelers, not knowing his abilities, immediately surrounded and attacked him. Li Xian挑ed his long sword towards the lake water, and waves surged up, overturning several boats. Many Flower Cage Sect disciples who were sharp-eyed and clever took the opportunity to escape.

Li Xian was unstoppable. He broke out of the heavy encirclement in an instant. Suddenly, a clear and pleasant voice rang out: "Li Xian? Ah, it really is you! It really is you!"

Among the Jianghu travelers, Gu Nianjun was wearing a snow leopard fur coat over a light purple lotus dress, and a pair of light green embroidered shoes on her feet. She was extremely bright and beautiful among the Jianghu travelers, her brows furrowed as she stared intently at Li Xian.
