Chapter 55: Jiang Chulong, the Little Princess of Yu Dynasty, Golden Heavenly Mandate!

Mu Ronghai's pupils constricted, and he looked somewhat dazed.

He never thought that a true disciple of Qingyuan Sect would be outmatched by a wounded bandit.

If Xiao'er hadn't been ambushed and hadn't suffered a loss in terms of experience, he would have won.

The systematic cultivation of martial arts by the disciples of a large sect was far superior to that of wandering martial artists and those from smaller sects.

Li Mo, possessing the Xuanyuan Sword, was definitely stronger than Xiao'er.

But...this was too easy.

There were almost no signs of a battle at the scene.

Even the blood-stained saber that Xue Peng had used to gain fame was destroyed into fragments.

"Mu Rong old man, you've arrived just in time."

Li Mo casually threw away the Iron Swallow and said, "Please take charge of handing over Cui Peng's corpse to the authorities."

After the authorities verified the identity, they would notify the External Affairs Hall, saving him the trouble.

Carrying a corpse around was annoying.

"Li brother, you're really fierce."

Mu Rong Xiao couldn't help but feel admiration after comparing himself to Li Mo.

The internal energy was divided into three levels: condensation, jade liquid, and mystic elixir. Each level represented a different realm.

He had practiced with his senior brothers who were at the condensation level, and even with his robust physique, he was still at a disadvantage.

Even if Cui Peng was injured, he wasn't confident that he could defeat him.

"What is this thing? A dart?"

Mu Rong Xiao picked up the Iron Swallow.

Before he could examine it closely, Mu Ronghai slapped it out of his hand.

"Stupid grandson, don't pick up anything you don't know."

"This dart doesn't seem to be poisoned..."

"This isn't a dart, it's a 'Hall Swallow'."

Mu Ronghai shook his head and explained the origin of the Iron Swallow, which was similar to what Shang Wu had said.

"I don't want to participate in the 'Wujian Trial'."

Mu Rong Xiao shrank his neck, not daring to look at the Iron Swallow again.

"These are indeed troubled times."

Mu Ronghai sighed and looked at Li Mo, his expression softening.

"Those who receive the 'Hall Swallow' from Fine Rain Tower are all ruthless and difficult to deal with."

"Li Mo, you're worthy of being called a genius, having defeated such a person so easily."

He then couldn't help but feel a sense of nostalgia.

"I wonder what kind of talent Ying Bing is, someone who is on par with Li Mo."

"I've benefited a lot from her."

Li Mo thought of Bing Tuo after Mu Ronghai's words.

For two days, he hadn't received any feedback from Bing Tuo, and he felt a bit lost without it.

Soon, the authorities arrived to clean up the scene.

Many eyes looked at him, filled with reverence and shock.

"What were we doing at 16?"

"Others had already killed a crazy man with internal energy."

...

Li Mo smiled and picked up the sack of rice, dusting it off.

"Take it."

"I didn't know he was a fugitive, Li...big benefactor."

Meng Can trembled, not daring to take the sack.

However, Li Mo had already placed it in his arms.

"I was going to look for Cui Peng anyway. If it weren't for you, I wouldn't have found him so quickly. You didn't do anything wrong."

"And don't call me 'Li big benefactor', it sounds weird."

Meng Can was taken aback.

Seeing Li Mo's sunny smile, he felt a warmth in his heart and suddenly felt like crying. He rubbed his eyes with his dirty hands, making his face even more disheveled.

"Li big brother, you're a good person, just like Jieba sister."

"Who is Jieba sister? Can you take me to see her?"

Li Mo asked gently.

Meng Can's face became conflicted, and after hesitating for a moment, he whispered, "Jieba sister said not to tell outsiders about her, and not to take people to see her."

Li Mo thought for a moment.

The cautious behavior of Meng Can and the others seemed to be avoiding something.

Even if "Jieba sister" wasn't the person Bing Tuo was looking for, she was probably not simple.

She might be a suitable investment target.

"But she's sick now, very sick."

"Li big brother, can you save her?"

Meng Can clung to Li Mo like a drowning man clinging to a lifeline.

Li Mo smiled.

"Coincidentally, I'm good at medicine. I guarantee I'll cure her."

...

In the muddy alley, the courtyard was old and dilapidated, with walls collapsed in several places, giving a sense of returning to nature.

A group of dirty, ragged children peeked outside.

They were not normal children; some were crippled, some were missing limbs, and some couldn't speak.

A slightly older beggar boy entered the courtyard, putting down the scraps and wild vegetables he had collected.

The children shook their heads, looking lost.

"How is Jieba sister doing?"

"She's still having a fever. I just changed her wet compress."

"It's hurting her, but now she's asleep."

"Should we go find a doctor to see Jieba sister? She seems to be suffering..."

"Seeing a doctor costs at least a few taels of silver. We don't have the money..."

The older beggar boy took out a small piece of yellowed salt from his pocket.

"Go cook first."

He then entered the room.

Inside the room, a 15- or 16-year-old beggar girl lay on a pile of weeds, her face covered in dirt, and her eyes covered with a cloth.

She moved her ears slightly upon hearing footsteps.

"Jieba sister, it's me. Are you feeling better?"

"Don't...don't worry about me...I'm fine."

"Rest...for a while...and I'll be okay."

Her hoarse voice was intermittent, and she seemed to be using all her strength to speak.

The beggar boy sighed and turned to leave.

Just as he was about to exit, he heard her voice behind him.

"Don't...go stealing...things..."

"I won't."

Jiang Chulong's breathing slowed down, and she curled up her body.

She felt hot all over, but coldness seemed to be coming from all directions.

In her chest, where her confidence once lay, there was now a deep abyss that was slowly consuming her.

"Am I...going to die?"

Jiang Chulong thought numbly.

She felt a sense of sorrow, but the hunger and weakness made her unable to muster the energy to feel love or hate.

When people died, could they see those they would never see again?

Mother...

Just then, a commotion came from the doorway.

"Cannnn go! Big brother is back!"

"Wow, it's rice!"

"Who is this big brother? Why did you bring an outsider back?"

"He's the good person who gave us food! He can save Jieba sister..."

Meng Can was explaining anxiously.

Li Mo's gaze passed over the group of children and landed on the beggar girl lying on the pile of weeds.

As his Heavenly Mandate Eye scanned her, he felt his breath catch.
