# Chapter 184: Intertwined Feng Shui

His dark pupils reflected the small patch of crimson sky. Zhang Jing’s expression remained unchanged, as tranquil as a fathomless ancient pool.

Suddenly, his heart stirred.

*Cling! Clang! Whoosh!* The roar of rushing water and the clang of metal colliding erupted simultaneously, instantly echoing throughout the entire arena.

With a gentle flick of Zhang Jing’s finger, the River of Treasures rapidly expanded. At the same time, the Dao Intent of wind and water permeated the river.

*Buzz!* The River of Treasures, hovering in the void, began to tremble violently. Its waters instantly turned as black as ink. *Woooosh!* A mournful wind abruptly rose, instantly whipping up exceedingly violent and surging waves on the River of Treasures. The larger the waves, the more terrifying the water vapor swept into the wind became, making the already eerie gale even more horrifying.

The wind borrowed the momentum of the water, and the water leveraged the power of the wind. The intertwined and merged Dao Intent of wind and water directly amplified the River of Treasures to an extremely terrifying degree. In terms of power, it was not inferior to the River of Treasures enhanced by Zhang Jing's Five Elements Dao Intent before. In fact, it was subtly even more potent!

The next moment, under Zhang Jing’s control, the River of Treasures, like a vast dragon, abruptly swept ferociously towards the terrifying scarlet flames that had erupted in all directions.

*Rumble!* The moment the two forces met, the scarlet flames, which had almost melted the entire arena, vanished without a trace as if they had encountered their bane. Afterward, the River of Treasures, carrying boundless and rampant momentum, roared as it surged towards the woman.

The entire process—from the opponent manifesting illusory clones and casting scarlet flame spells, to the appearance of the River of Treasures, annihilating all scarlet flames, and then sweeping towards the woman—took less than two breaths. Before the look of expectation could fade from the woman’s face, she had already transformed into a beam of white light and vanished from the arena.

*Hiss!* From the dozen or so surrounding arenas, sounds of extreme shock instantly erupted. Some even froze, almost forgetting their own battles. This was the first time they had witnessed Zhang Jing, one of the top three, make a move. The woman’s previous attack, in their eyes, had been quite formidable. Only a handful of people among them were confident they could withstand such an attack without being eliminated. Yet, such an seemingly irresistible offensive was effortlessly extinguished by that person with a mere backhand! It looked as if he hadn't expended any effort. Both were in the Foundation Establishment realm, yet the disparity in their strengths was clearly despair-inducing.

Moreover, they simply refused to believe that this was his full strength!

On the spot, Zhang Jing gazed at the place where the woman had vanished, a hint of admiration flashing in his eyes. The moment the opponent stepped onto the stage, he was almost certain that she did not hail from any of the human race's Seven Immortal Dao Lineages.

To reach this stage—even among the numerous disciples from their Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect who came to participate in this secret realm—was a feat accomplished by only a select few. For example, Junior Brother Shen Chu, who had invited Zhang Jing and Qu Junhou to the Dao Tea Gathering, had not successfully advanced to the final round. And even… if Zhang Jing wasn't mistaken, it seemed that one of the two Cave Heaven disciples from the lower Nine Regions who attended that Dao Tea Gathering had also failed to reach the current stage. If it was this difficult for Dao Sect disciples, imagine the plight of a human cultivator from outside the Seven Immortal Dao Lineages. The difficulties involved were evident. It wasn't just about inheritances; it was also about resources! Many precious resources and treasures easily obtained within the Dao Sect were priceless rarities in the outside world, so rare that ordinary cultivators might not have even heard of them.

His thoughts returned to the present. Zhang Jing couldn't help but glance at the River of Treasures. His heart swelled with excitement. The intertwined fusion of wind and water Dao Intent just now was an attempt he made by drawing inspiration from the principle of wind and water Dao Intent intertwining within the earlier Black Xun Wind. As it now appeared, it was clearly very successful. Although still somewhat rudimentary, its terrifying power had already bared its fangs. By simply fusing two Dao Intents in this manner, its power had already slightly surpassed that of the previous Five Elements Dao Intent. What if all thirty-six Dao Intents were to be fully merged into one? At that time, purely in terms of Dao Intent, it might even be able to catch up to the pseudo-version of the Innate Primordial Immortal Light.

Thinking of this, a smile of anticipation flitted across Zhang Jing’s face. "It seems this month-long ranking battle will keep me quite busy."

***

The repulsive force from the arena beneath his feet grew increasingly strong. Zhang Jing shook his head helplessly, then transformed into a beam of rainbow light, directly leaving the arena and returning to Renjie Island.

His gaze involuntarily swept across the numerous arenas high above. In just an instant, he fixed his eyes on Ji Changyu of the Human Emperor Dao Court, one of his main competitors for this round. Something seemed off! Ji Changyu today felt completely different from before. His entire being seemed to have transformed into a vast, blazing, terrifying flame, embodying change, fervor, continuation, survival, rise, and fall… all manner of profound meanings flowed ceaselessly around him.

"The Fire of Humanity? Or perhaps the Fire of Civilization, the Fire of Sentient Beings?" Zhang Jing wondered curiously. With a thought, a swirling multi-colored auspicious cloud, shimmering with golden radiance, rose behind his head. Within the auspicious cloud, an eye filled with indifferent light slowly opened, its gaze directly falling upon Ji Changyu on the arena. In an instant, a torrent of fire! It was like a sacred flame embodying the will of all humanity! His vision turned crimson. Ji Changyu’s body was wreathed in flickering flames. His body, mana, and even his spiritual consciousness were covered by that sacred fire, which even seemed to extend subtly into deeper layers that Zhang Jing couldn’t perceive.

"Is this the powerful inheritance of the Human Emperor Dao Court?" A hint of awe flashed in Zhang Jing’s eyes. To be able to condense the formless and insubstantial Fire of Humanity into a true, tangible flame divine ability—truly worthy of the immortal Dao Lineages passed down by the legendary Human Emperors.

On the other side, the woman gradually recovered her senses. She glanced at Zhang Jing, who was not far away, her eyes filled with complex emotions. A hint of shock, along with a barely perceptible longing, flashed across her face. "Is this… a prodigy of the human race's Immortal Dao Lineages?" Her most proud technique had been effortlessly erased by the other party, unable to even cause him a shred of trouble. The disparity between them was already beyond imagination. "Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect?!" the woman murmured, a sudden resolute determination arising in her heart.

***

Time slowly passed. A faint, ethereal summons suddenly appeared in his mind. Zhang Jing looked upwards: "Yi 1! Jia 5!"

"It's my turn again," he smiled faintly. His figure instantly appeared on the designated arena, waiting quietly.

Below, the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Peng looked at the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon beside him and said gloatingly, "Yi 1! Haha, you’re in luck, brute! That seems to be Zhang Jing’s number!"

"Weren't you curious why I dared not challenge him in the last round?"

"Go on, brute, you'll find out soon enough."

"Hahahaha~" With that, the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Peng burst into hearty laughter.

Beside him, the Mountain-Bearing Mighty Goat Demon, provoked by the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Peng's words, immediately grew agitated. He puffed out his chest, his face red, and shouted, "I’ll go if I go, what’s so great about it? Today, I’ll show you what the pinnacle of strength is! Just because you, a cowardly bird, don’t dare to face an enemy, doesn’t mean I don’t! No matter who the opponent is, even if I lose today, I'll bite off a few of his hairs!"

The next instant, without waiting for the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Peng's reply, the Goat Demon's figure flickered and instantly vanished from the spot.
