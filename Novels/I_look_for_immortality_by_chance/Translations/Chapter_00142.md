# Chapter 142: Twin Fates, One Root – The Azure Python’s Water Mansion  

This strike anticipated the enemy, seizing a fleeting opportunity with impeccable precision.  

The sword light blazed brilliantly, piercing the old man’s back in an instant—so swiftly that it almost seemed as though the old man had thrown himself onto the blade.  

"Ah!"  

The old man let out a bloodcurdling scream as a gaping hole appeared in his back, his eyes filled with disbelief.  

He could never have imagined that even with the golden seal in his possession, allowing him to teleport without leaving a trace, he would still be struck directly by the sword light.  

*Boom!*  

Yet, for some reason, the old man’s body was far sturdier than that of an ordinary demonic creature. His vitality was astonishingly tenacious—despite the gaping wound in his back and his internal organs ravaged by sword qi, he still refused to die.  

*Clang!*  

Gu Yuan’s expression remained unchanged as he activated the Boundless Sword Seal once more. Eighteen streaks of sword light converged, slashing toward the old man’s head.  

*Boom!*  

But at that moment, the emerald tortoiseshell on the old man’s back suddenly erupted with radiant light, as if burning away its last vestiges of spiritual energy. A dazzling shield materialized in midair.  

*Clang!*  

Gu Yuan’s sword light, sharp as formless lightning, was still blocked by the shield, unable to advance another inch.  

*Splash!*  

Seizing this opportunity, the old man’s body dissolved into a stream of water and vanished once more.  

This time, however, his teleportation was not flawless. The lingering sword qi left behind by Gu Yuan acted like a beacon, revealing traces of the old man’s movements.  

With a sweep of his divine sense, Gu Yuan immediately detected the old man’s presence a hundred zhang away, atop a great river.  

Gu Yuan transformed into a streak of light, pushing the Golden Rainbow Dao Foundation to its limits as he pursued the old man with lightning speed, intent on finishing him off.  

*Boom!*  

Yet, every time his sword light was about to strike, the old man would dissolve into water and vanish, reappearing another hundred zhang away.  

This incredibly refined evasion technique left Gu Yuan both astonished and increasingly murderous.  

*If the roots are not torn out, they will grow back stronger.*  

There was no need to debate right or wrong—within the Southern Marsh Water Realm, no one was truly innocent.  

*Boom!*  

His figure streaked through the air like lightning as he gave chase relentlessly.  

In just a dozen breaths, the two had traveled far from the island and arrived in an unfamiliar region.  

The river stretched endlessly under a cloudless sky—a pristine expanse of water.  

*Boom!*  

At the sight of this water realm, a trace of relief finally appeared on the old man’s ashen face.  

With a final burst of demonic energy, he plunged headlong into the depths below.  

Gu Yuan paused above the water’s surface, scanning the area briefly before a look of surprise flickered across his face.  

"So the two fates share the same root?"  

Though he did not recognize this water realm, he was intimately familiar with its location.  

It matched the vision revealed by the Stone Liquid.  

Gu Yuan’s thoughts raced, but he swiftly suppressed all distractions. Activating his Cangming Dao Foundation, he dove into the water in pursuit.  

---  

Beneath the river, the water grew murkier the deeper he went, the pressure intensifying with every inch.  

But with the Cangming Dao Foundation and a Water-Repelling Pearl, the crushing depths were nothing to Gu Yuan. His figure darted forward like lightning, swiftly closing in on the old man.  

*Clang!*  

A brilliant sword light sliced through the water, thrusting toward the old man.  

Pale as death, the old man no longer had the strength to activate his secret seals. With a desperate roll, he revealed his true form—a green-shelled tortoise.  

However, the tortoiseshell on his back had already shattered into fragments, leaving him defenseless.  

The sword light struck, and though the old tortoise twisted desperately, one of his limbs was severed, blood gushing forth.  

Yet, after his long flight, he had finally reached his destination.  

A jade-green water mansion stood before him, its surface covered in intricate spirit patterns that shimmered brightly, illuminating the riverbed.  

*Splash!*  

With one final lunge, the old tortoise scrambled inside.  

*Rustle!*  

Gu Yuan pursued relentlessly, entering the mansion in an instant.  

But as soon as he stepped inside, a tremendous surge of water erupted, forming a towering wave that crashed down upon him.  

Amidst the churning currents, a colossal shadow stirred—a massive creature lunged toward Gu Yuan, jaws wide.  

A furious roar echoed in his ears.  

*Clang!*  

Gu Yuan’s heart tightened as he immediately summoned the Seven-Phase Exquisite Tower to shield himself.  

*Boom!*  

The towering wave crashed down, accompanied by an overwhelming force that slammed into the jade tower.  

The tower trembled violently, its spiritual energy in turmoil. Only by pouring in his full power did Gu Yuan manage to stabilize it and withstand the assault.  

It was then that he finally saw his attacker clearly.  

A twenty-zhang-long azure python specter, its head crowned with jagged ridges and its belly bulging—clearly on the verge of transforming into a flood dragon. Its strength was comparable to a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Even in its spectral form, it could command the surrounding waters with terrifying power, far surpassing that of an early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

Behind the python specter stood a young man with a serpent’s tail, holding a treasure seal engraved with a coiled azure python. The specter had emerged from this very seal.  

The young man’s eyes were icy as he regarded Gu Yuan and the fleeing tortoise.  

"Old Tortoise, you actually led someone here?"  

"Do you think I won’t kill you just because of our contract?"  

The serpent-tailed youth’s voice was frigid, his gaze murderous.  

"This man is a prodigy from the Dao Academy—the one who killed the Fiery-Eyed Water Ape and the Water Wolf. He can split his sword into eighteen beams and is a once-in-a-generation talent, barely twenty years old. He’s the perfect candidate for your Human Elixir!"  

The old tortoise collapsed onto the jade tiles of the mansion, hastily swallowing pills to recover as he shouted urgently at the serpent-tailed youth.  

"Eighteen sword beams?"  

The youth’s interest was piqued, and he studied Gu Yuan with a thoughtful expression, though he did not immediately attack.  

"When the nest is overturned, no egg remains unbroken. The Crescent Bay is about to fall, and the humans will soon conquer the entire Southern Marsh Water Realm. Do you really think this mansion can protect you?"  

"That python specter won’t be enough. Once the Mistfire Battleship arrives, everything here will be reduced to ashes. This man is the most outstanding early-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator in the Dao Academy—your best chance! What are you waiting for?!"  

"Kill him, and we can leave this doomed place together!"  

Seeing the youth hesitate, the old tortoise grew frantic and shouted again.  

Finally convinced, the serpent-tailed youth raised his head, his eyes gleaming with malice as he smirked at Gu Yuan.  

"A prodigy who can wield eighteen sword beams? I’d very much like to test your mettle!"  

With a thought, the twenty-zhang-long azure python’s eyes turned blood-red. A dense spiritual energy surged around it, causing the entire mansion to tremble.  

The python coiled around the Seven-Phase Exquisite Tower, its massive body tightening like a vice.  

The tower shuddered, struggling to break free, but the mansion’s formation patterns flared to life, converging on the python and suppressing the tower completely.  

"A prodigy like you shouldn’t need to rely on artifacts, should you?"  

"Now that neither of us has treasures at hand, dare you fight me bare-handed?"
