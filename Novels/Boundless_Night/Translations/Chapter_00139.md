# Chapter 139: Rule-Bound Grand Gifts

The world was dark, like an abyss.

The Six Emperors Ancestral Court spanned an immense area. High-grade fire springs flowed brightly and brilliantly, making the entire region vibrant and full of life. A towering structure, primarily constructed from adamantine lapis lazuli, bore the mottled marks of time. Many renowned masters had entered this place throughout history.

In the extraordinarily spacious living room, an elder with pale golden hair and beard spoke, "Cui Changqing, what brings you here?"

The ebony tea table was quite massive, its color deep, its natural patterns resembling silhouettes of mountains and rivers. Tea fragrance wafted, but neither of the two sitting quietly touched their cups.

"It’s been many years since we last met. I missed an old friend, so I specifically came to visit," Cui Changqing smiled. His emerald green hair flowed with the fresh scent of grass and trees.

The golden-haired, golden-bearded elder looked at him, golden rays shooting from his eyes. "In the past, I already made an exception, allowing your Cui family's child to learn the first volume of the Six Emperors Heart Sutra early, in my master's name. Don't come again without a reason!"

His name was Zhou Shize. His pale golden hair and beard were a result of cultivating the Six Emperors Energy to a certain stage; even his pupils were like this, as if cast from gold, indicating an extremely profound cultivation.

Cui Changqing's skin was snow-white, his appearance ageless, looking no older than thirty. He cupped his hands and said, "In the past, I came with that child's father to seek the true scripture. I must once again thank Brother Zhou."

He then added, "That child did not disappoint. At just fifteen years old, he is already an extraordinary individual. His nine rebirths are complete; he merely awaits comprehending the true essence of the Six Emperors Energy, breaking out of his cocoon to become a butterfly, and naturally stepping into the Outer Saint Realm without relying on grand elixirs."

"That doesn't dishonor the Six Emperors Heart Sutra," Zhou Shize nodded, his expression softening slightly, golden light flowing in his eyes as he asked, "So, what brings you here?"

Cui Changqing took a small sip of tea. "Chongxuan is a simple child. Although he's already an extraordinary individual, I fear he might be harmed by outsiders. I came today specifically to ask my old friend to look after him a little more."

Zhou Shize spoke indifferently, "Your words carry a hidden meaning. If he is an extraordinary individual and passes the core disciple assessment, who could harm him in my Six Emperors Ancestral Court?"

Cui Changqing said, "A mischievous little monkey, one I raised in my family. Recently, it's been very disobedient and has come to the Six Emperors Ancestral Court. I'm afraid the monkey might cause trouble."

"If your child, an extraordinary individual, is strong enough, why would he fear a mere monkey? Moreover, if that monkey joins my sect, it will already be a Six Emperors disciple," Zhou Shize said calmly from behind the ebony tea table.

"The monkey is crude and very fierce. My Chongxuan has a pure heart, and I worry something untoward might happen to him." As Cui Changqing spoke, his right hand lightly traced the void, a streak of light transforming into a sharp blade before quickly dissipating.

Zhou Shize's expression turned cold, his pale golden hair fluttering like an enraged lion. "What do you mean? Do you dare to be presumptuous in my Six Emperors Ancestral Court?!"

Cui Changqing chuckled, "Brother Zhou, please don't misunderstand. I have no other intentions. I'm merely worried about Chongxuan. In the past, you bestowed the true scripture upon him, so he can be considered half your disciple. We can't just stand by and watch something happen to him."

Zhou Shize said, "He is in the Six Emperors Ancestral Court. Everything will follow the rules, and there will be no problems." He then warned, "I advise you not to cause trouble. The Six Emperors Ancestral Court does not tolerate outsiders interfering. Those who dare to touch our reverse scales will surely be slain!"

"I naturally understand; everything has its rules," Cui Changqing chuckled. Though over a hundred years old, his body exuded the fresh scent of flora, appearing more vibrant than many younger adults. This was the marvel of the Everlasting Scripture; it could prolong life and allow one to maintain a peak state for a very long time.

He took out an exquisite brocade box and pushed it forward onto the ebony tea table.

"What do you mean?" Zhou Shize didn't move, his gaze slightly sharp.

Cui Changqing laughed, "One can't visit an old friend empty-handed, can they? I know you like swords. This one originates from the depths of the Night Mist World; even after a thousand years, time cannot conceal its brilliance." He opened the brocade box, revealing a foot-long short sword, flowing with five-colored light.

Next, Cui Changqing took out a handwritten notebook and pushed it forward. "The patriarchs of various sects should all possess the Everlasting Scripture, but as time passes, each family's understanding differs slightly. These are my Cui family's ancestor's insights into the longevity aspects of the Everlasting Scripture. I invite Brother Zhou to appraise them."

Zhou Shize's expression turned serious. Everyone knew now that the Cui family's Old Ancestor had unique insights into the Everlasting Scripture. Two hundred years ago, the Cui family's Old Ancestor was already very old, and everyone said he was nearing his end. Yet, two years ago, when the Li family produced an incredibly powerful figure who led an invasion, the Cui family's Old Ancestor, who had been in secluded cultivation for two centuries, actually re-emerged! This handwritten notebook moved Zhou Shize. Though he appeared to be in his prime with golden hair and beard, he had in fact long surpassed a hundred years of age. It was merely his profound cultivation of the Six Emperors Energy that kept him vibrant and prevented him from showing signs of aging.

"Old friend, please accept them. It won't put you in a difficult position; everything can proceed according to the rules," Cui Changqing smiled, a greenish glow flowing over his body, demonstrating his continued vitality.

At the Six Emperors Ancestral Court, the fire springs shone brightly, and white mist swirled, creating a beautiful scenery. Qin Ming had been here for two days, quietly awaiting the arrival of the initial assessment's designated time. He was assigned to the Golden Forest. In fact, many top talents from various regions were temporarily residing here.

In this vast forest, the leaves of all tree species were golden, a mystery as to how the Six Emperors Ancestral Court cultivated them. For instance, the thousand-year-old ancient pine, which should have been verdant and evergreen, was instead entirely crystalline, all its needles flowing with golden light, and a richer pine fragrance permeated the air. Even the lotus flowers in the lake bloomed with golden blossoms, growing golden-hued leaves, strikingly unique. Furthermore, the fire springs here were not crimson red but brimmed with faint golden light, flowing through the forest, making the scenery particularly distinct.

There were many single-story wooden cabins in the forest, one for each person. Dozens of youths, all participating in the core disciple assessment, had already moved in. The regular disciples were more numerous and had separate arrangements. Jade Purity, Heaven-Bearing, and Six Emperors had relaxed their disciple selection criteria, which was why the number of youths who signed up this year far exceeded previous years.

"Do you know?" someone said. "It's said that the reason the plants here are golden is because the Grand Master's youngest disciple once cultivated here in seclusion. He comprehended his own Light Energy from the Six Emperors Heart Sutra. When he emerged from seclusion, at the moment he opened his eyes, golden light flowed from his pupils, and everything he passed turned golden. This place was imbued with his mysterious power."

The youths residing here were well-informed, surprisingly knowing such hidden details. "How old was the Grand Master's youngest disciple?" someone couldn't help but ask.

"Uh, it's not clear, but this Junior Grand Master's grand-disciples, like Elder Zhou Shize, are probably over a hundred years old."

The Golden Forest gradually became lively. In the last two days, there were already over fifty people. Qin Ming was very low-key, without much presence. He discovered two extraordinary individuals: one was Cao Wuji, extremely handsome with sword-like eyebrows extending to his temples, whom he had seen in the Purple Bamboo Forest of Jinrui City. The other was a black-clad young woman with a cold and stunning demeanor and exceptionally beautiful features. Her strength was immense. When she competed with Cao Wuji for the best lakeside wooden cabin, the two exchanged a punch, and it was the young woman who actually forced Cao Wuji back three steps, instantly stunning everyone.

Many were familiar with Cao Wuji, as he was a prodigy frequently reported in the Nightly Gazette, his fame long spread throughout the great cities. It was then that people realized the black-clad young woman was also a top-tier extraordinary individual. Qin Ming sighed inwardly. He hadn't expected to encounter two of the rumored extraordinary individuals after arriving at the Six Emperors Ancestral Court. Up until now, he had never fought an extraordinary individual. Overall, besides Yu Zhuohan, who was quite prominent, his past opponents hadn't possessed such high 'standing'.

"Young extraordinary individuals are all extremely powerful!" Qin Ming assessed, seriously and earnestly. He always overestimated his opponents, to prevent himself from underestimating them and suffering heavy losses.

"Do you know how we'll be assessed this time?" someone asked. "It's said we'll go witness the true appearance of this world. There are rare spiritual substances there, but it's also extremely dangerous. Perhaps we'll need to cooperate to survive better." Some youths had quite a few connections in the Six Emperors Ancestral Court and managed to inquire about such news.

"The Six Emperors Elder said that whether we act alone or in teams, it's fine; it's up to us!"

Such broad conditions left all the youths feeling uncertain about how the Six Emperors would think or how they would specifically assess them. Someone spoke up, "I suspect that in such a mysterious and vast environment, even those who team up will eventually be forced to separate, which is why they're so flexible. However, in the initial stages, it's better for us to act together. It ensures safety and conserves energy."

"Brother Cao, let's go together!"
"Brother Cao!"

Soon, Cao Wuji was surrounded by people, both male and female. Those who dared to come here for the test naturally had some confidence, but they clearly knew they couldn't compete with Cao Wuji and the black-clad young woman. Therefore, they lowered their goals, striving to be third, fourth, or even fifth. If they passed, they could still become core disciples. Additionally, many people surrounded the aloof black-clad young woman, Zhuo Ya, wanting to accompany her.

Qin Ming watched calmly. Were those people genuinely bowing their heads and submitting to Cao Wuji and Zhuo Ya? Not necessarily. Perhaps some simply wanted to use the two to clear a path, thereby conserving their own strength and avoiding having to act themselves.

"Brother Qin, aren't you going to team up with them?" asked Qin Ming's neighbor, the yellow-clad young woman Zhou Lei.

"Zhuo Ya is quite cold and hard to talk to. Let's go with Cao Wuji instead," suggested another neighbor, Huang Cheng.

"We'll see when the time comes," Qin Ming said. The two walked away, concluding that their neighbor was a low-key arrogant person, likely intending to be a lone wolf.

That day, Cui Chongxuan arrived, making it just in time. "The Cui family's new generation extraordinary individual!" Someone with reliable information surprisingly knew Cui Chongxuan's identity immediately. In the Golden Forest, Cui Chongxuan chose a wooden cabin and moved in quite discreetly. Soon, he spotted Qin Ming. For a moment, his expression was complex, a little conflicted, but in the end, he actively walked over and softly called out, "Brother."

Qin Ming smiled, nodded at him, and said, "Tomorrow, give it your all and perform well." Many were surprised. Although they were too far to hear what was said, they all realized that the low-key fellow seemed to have some background as well.

"It's you!" Cao Wuji walked over, only just realizing that the youth who displayed eight colors of Heavenly Light Energy in the Purple Bamboo Forest of Jinrui City had also arrived.

"Brother Cao, we meet again," Qin Ming smiled and nodded. Observing him up close, he could increasingly appreciate the power of an extraordinary physique. Cao Wuji's vitality was exceptionally vigorous. Most crucially, Cao Wuji had likely stepped into the Outer Saint Realm, appearing significantly stronger than when they last met. This meant that the black-clad young woman, Zhuo Ya, was also an Outer Saint! Everyone was astonished, looking over. The two extraordinary individuals actually knew that Qin Ming.

Hearing someone call out Qin Ming's name, the black-clad young woman Zhuo Ya also gracefully walked over, her expression showing surprise. "You are Qin Ming?"

"Yes," Qin Ming confirmed, certain he had no previous interactions with her.

"My cousin is Yu Zhuohan," Zhuo Ya said, a faint smile gracing her lips, like an iceberg thawing and a snow lotus blooming, utterly radiant.

"Ah, so we're family! He and I became acquainted through a fight," Qin Ming immediately became enthusiastic.

"But he told me to give you a proper thrashing," Zhuo Ya said. Qin Ming felt that he had been too lenient last time. Yu Zhuohan still seemed unconvinced, harboring resentment and wanting his cousin to get revenge for him.

The next day, an Elder from the Six Emperors Ancestral Court appeared with several young adults. "Everything you needed to hear, everything you needed to know, you've understood, right? I won't say more. Let's depart directly."

"Elder, we don't know where we're going or anything!" someone spoke up.

"The edge of the world!" a young disciple responded to him.

The Elder said, "Hmm, assessing you within the Ancestral Court isn't very interesting. If I had you fight each other, that would be internal friction. I'm taking you to see the true face of the world; it's better to expend your vigorous energy there."

Two massive flying beasts spread their wings, soaring into the night sky, generating fierce gales. Carrying over sixty people, they rushed towards the distance. Everyone's expression was incredibly solemn. The two flying beasts were quite extraordinary: a black giant crane and a snow-white peacock. They swept aside the dense night mist, both exuding a terrifying pressure, clearly high-tier variant creatures. Along the way, the ground below was pitch black. It took a long time to see even a faint speck of light. In this vast and boundless world, areas with fire springs were relatively few. Even one great city after another, beneath the dense night mist, appeared only like scattered fireflies.

That day, they traversed endless darkness, arriving at their destination, already forty thousand li from the Six Emperors Ancestral Court.
