# Chapter 78: Disciple Zhang Yan, Ascends the Mountain to Seek the Dao

Zhang Yan had been a member of the sect for quite some time now. The title of True Disciple had always been circulating, but upon reflection, he realized he hadn't actually encountered a single True Disciple.

"True Disciples... they're different from us. They have their own separate quarters," Mu Sen said with a complicated expression when Zhang Yan brought up the topic. "As for the specifics, I don't know them either. You should ask Master about it."

"Alright." Seeing Mu Sen's expression, Zhang Yan nodded slightly. It seemed this matter was more complex than he had imagined. But it didn't matter—he was a True Disciple now, and he would find out eventually.

On the day Zhang Yan became a True Disciple, the entire Qingheng Sect celebrated. According to tradition, Zhang Yan needed to start from the foot of Qingheng Peak and ascend step by step to the main hall at the summit, where he would burn incense and exchange his identity token.

During this process, anyone whose cultivation didn't exceed Zhang Yan by more than one major realm could challenge him—whether through scholarly debate or martial combat.

"So, are you nervous?" Mu Sen and the other senior brothers escorted Zhang Yan to the mountain path entrance before asking.

"Why would I be nervous?" Zhang Yan straightened his Daoist robes as he gazed at the towering staircase leading up the mountain.

Alongside the steps stood numerous disciples—some from Qingheng Sect, others from outside—all gathered to witness the event. Their eyes were filled with curiosity and envy as they watched Zhang Yan. After all, this was a True Disciple!

"Alright, we'll leave you here. The rest of the path is yours to walk alone," Mu Sen said, stepping back to give Zhang Yan space.

"Understood," Zhang Yan replied firmly.

"Disciple Zhang Yan, ascends the mountain to seek the Dao." As his words fell, a deep bell toll echoed from Qingheng Peak, its resonance lingering in the air.

At the same time, Zhang Yan took his first step onto the stone staircase.

"Zhang Yan, do you choose scholarly debate or martial combat?" A clear, cold voice rang out as soon as his foot touched the step.

"This disciple accepts either!" Zhang Yan declared, beginning his ascent.

"Oh? This kid..." 

Up on Qingheng Peak, the Golden Core elders' expressions shifted. They had expected Zhang Yan to choose scholarly debate, but instead, he was open to all challenges.

"Esteemed Daoist Wang Ziyan, late-stage Qi Refinement, requests a spar with Junior Brother." After only a few steps, a cultivator suddenly blocked Zhang Yan's path. The man appeared to be in his thirties, with a thick beard and cultivation at the eighth or ninth layer of Qi Refinement.

He observed Zhang Yan with an inscrutable expression.

"Oh no. Could Zhang Yan actually stumble here?" 

Though the Golden Core ancestors hadn't descended the mountain, they were monitoring everything with their spiritual senses. Seeing an eighth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator step forward, Zhuge Wan and others grew tense. 

This disciple clearly didn't understand the unwritten rules. Just because challenges were allowed didn't mean one should actually issue them! Sometimes, it was better not to be so obedient.

Facing the eighth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator, Zhang Yan showed no fear.

"Junior Brother, be careful—I specialize in flying swords..." 

The man spoke politely, but before he could finish, a streak of golden light shot toward him. He barely had time to react before a lock of his hair drifted slowly to the ground.

"Senior Brother, I concede defeat!" 

Zhang Yan walked past him without looking back.

"Was that spell... the Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword? It must be—nothing else moves that fast." 

The observing disciples murmured among themselves.

"That's taking advantage of a technicality. Though the Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword is fast, its power is lacking. Striking before the opponent even activated a defensive spell—that's hardly an honorable victory!" 

Many felt Zhang Yan's victory over an eighth-layer cultivator was somewhat underhanded.

"Hahaha! If you think that was dishonorable, then let old Lei here have a go!" 

Amid the chatter, Lei Wanbao suddenly stepped onto the staircase, blocking Zhang Yan's path.

"Don't say I'm bullying you—I'll suppress my cultivation to match yours. You don't even need to defeat me; just last ninety breaths, and I'll concede." 

Lei Wanbao grinned, his eyes gleaming. Though he admired Zhang Yan's talent and comprehension, that didn't stop him from holding a grudge. 

Because of Zhang Yan, he had suffered numerous beatings. Yet he couldn't just bully a mere Qi Refinement junior. Now that Zhang Yan was becoming a True Disciple, Lei Wanbao couldn't resist teaching him a lesson. 

Of course, he knew his limits—he wouldn't actually cripple Zhang Yan. Otherwise, the Sect Leader, Zhuge Wan, and even his own grandfather would never let him off the hook.

"Senior Brother Lei?" 

Zhang Yan was surprised to see him but showed no intention of backing down. Instead, he seemed eager for the challenge.

"I accept your challenge," Zhang Yan said after a moment's thought.

"Then be careful, Junior Brother!" 

Lei Wanbao immediately cast a defensive spell on himself. 

No sooner had the barrier formed than a whistling sound cut through the air—Zhang Yan's Gengjin Grass-Cutting Sword.

"Heh, a mere Grass-Cutting Sword can't break through my defenses!" 

Lei Wanbao didn't even bother dodging. The Grass-Cutting Sword was just a pest-control spell—how could it possibly threaten him?

Yet what happened next left him stunned. 

The golden streak pierced straight through his barrier, aiming for his vitals.

"Dammit!" 

Lei Wanbao cursed and barely managed to dodge. But more Grass-Cutting Swords followed in rapid succession, giving him no respite. 

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could barely evade the attacks with the help of his spiritual sense. But the assault didn't stop there—Zhang Yan also unleashed his Golden Bamboo Sword.

The flying sword tore through the air with a sharp hiss, sending a tingling sensation down Lei Wanbao's spine.

"Mystic Spirit Ring!" 

With no other choice, Lei Wanbao activated a ring on his finger, summoning an earthen-yellow shield. The Mystic Spirit Ring was a top-grade magical artifact, its barrier capable of withstanding attacks from a Qi Refinement Great Perfection cultivator.

Yet—

*Boom!* 

Zhang Yan's Golden Bamboo Sword shattered the shield effortlessly, stopping just before Lei Wanbao's forehead.

*Click.* 

Lei Wanbao caught the blade between two fingers.

"Senior Brother, I concede," Zhang Yan said with a faint smile.

"Junior Brother, impressive!" 

Lei Wanbao's expression darkened. He had wanted to teach Zhang Yan a lesson, but the latter's strength far exceeded his expectations. Though he had caught the sword, he'd been forced to use his Foundation Establishment cultivation to do so. 

This match was his loss.
