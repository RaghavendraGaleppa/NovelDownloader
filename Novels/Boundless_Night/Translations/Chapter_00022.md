## Chapter 22: Gains

Qin Ming came to a higher slope, close to where he had buried his armor and weapons, hiding behind a large tree that several people could barely embrace.

As expected, that group of people headed towards the Blood Bamboo Forest. There were eleven of them in total, agile and swift as the wind, reaching the valley entrance in an instant. Taking advantage of the lingering ground light, Qin Ming could clearly see their appearance: all young and strong, clad in gleaming armor, and wielding long, cold, glinting sabers. They cooperated with great synchronicity, moving in perfect unison. Even their stances, gripping their sabers in readiness, were remarkably similar once they reached the valley entrance.

"Patrollers!" Qin Ming realized their origin. This was because they wore standard protective armor, identical to what Feng Yi'an, Shao Chengfeng, and the others wore. The difference was that these people carried sabers. This must have been a deliberate choice; long sabers were more suitable for dealing with snakes, at least better than the standard iron spears commonly used by the Patrol Squad.

The ground light had faded. At the dim valley entrance, the group removed their packages, which contained various bottles and jars. They began to mix something. "Sure enough, a group of seasoned veterans," Qin Ming thought to himself. "Perhaps they really can wipe out this nest of blood snakes."

Not long after, another figure ran out of the dense forest, quickly appearing before the valley entrance. Everyone turned to look at him. The newcomer gasped for breath and said, "Fu Entao, Feng Yi'an, and their group aren't at the stronghold. And it's quite strange—several wooden huts on the mountain have vanished." Everyone present showed surprise at these words.

"Weren't those guys about to make a move on the Blood Bamboo Forest? Where did they run off to now? Could they have been wiped out by mountain monsters?"

"Recently, nobles and famous organizations from Red Cloud City have arrived. Some have already entered the mountains. Did Fu Entao's group run into trouble?"

The group leader, who held great authority among them, spoke, and the others immediately fell silent. He said, "Don't worry about that for now. Originally, I was a bit concerned about sneaking into Fu Entao's territory to hunt blood snakes, fearing they'd discover us and fight us to the death. It's better now that one less hidden danger exists."

"Even the heavens are helping us!" a patroller exclaimed.

The leader, Liu Huaishan, was extremely strong, like a brown bear. He said in a deep voice, "I'll emphasize it again: if things go wrong, flee immediately, each person for themselves. Do not hesitate." The others were there for their own second rebirth, but Liu Huaishan was there for his eldest son's rebirth. Otherwise, no one would risk their lives like this.

The group silently entered the valley and stopped. According to their earlier plan, Liu Huaishan, the strongest among them, walked forward alone. As a Second Reborn, he was very responsible. Carrying various bottles and jars, he walked alone. From a distance, he ignited the contents of some jars, which emitted thick yellow smoke, and threw them all towards the fire spring. Other bottles and jars contained medicinal powders and liquids, which he accurately tossed, letting them fall into the dim "red halo." The moment he finished all this, he quickly retreated, putting a sufficient distance between himself and the spring. Seeing this, the other members of the Patrol Squad, still somewhat nervous, also retreated, almost reaching the valley entrance.

Thick smoke billowed from the fire spring, creating a large commotion. First, over a dozen small snakes, several feet long, darted out, swiftly moving around as if scouting ahead. Then, two large snakes, over four meters long, leaped out, glowing crimson all over. When the two snakes brushed against each other, they actually clanged like clashing swords, their scales appearing forged from red gold, shimmering brightly. They rushed towards the valley entrance at extreme speed, even lifting off the ground at one point, like two blood-colored spears piercing the air, emitting terrifying hissing sounds. The two large snakes were enraged.

These patrollers wanted to curse. How could there be two large snakes? This was completely beyond their expectations.

Liu Huaishan shouted, "Quick, go! The snake venom antidote and stimulating smoke are completely useless against these blood snakes!" In fact, he didn't even need to remind them; the patrollers, who had frequented the mountains for years, were experienced enough to know when something was impossible, and they decisively fled. Liu Huaishan, as a Second Reborn, was the fastest. Although he had started from the very back, once his powerful legs got going, he quickly overtook several people.

One large snake pursued them not far away, pausing briefly on a large bluestone outside the valley entrance, then suddenly sprang up, transforming into an astonishing crimson streak, shooting forth. This momentum was somewhat terrifying, seemingly accompanied by faint sounds of wind and thunder.

*Crack!*

The last patroller, as if struck by a four-meter-long blood-colored spear, had both layers of his protective armor shattered. The snake's head, hard as refined gold, pierced through him, and his armor plates exploded. This patroller was a veteran, very well prepared. He had placed a thick iron plate over his back, which blocked the blood snake at the crucial moment; otherwise, he would certainly have been impaled. However, this did not change his fate. The iron plate was slightly deformed from the impact, and with such immense force, he couldn't stand firm and tumbled into the snow. The four-meter-long blood snake moved like lightning, instantly coiling around his body. If it were other snake species, not to mention a four-meter-long one, even a thicker, longer snake couldn't restrain a Reborn. Yet, the patroller was screaming terribly.

After coiling around him, the blood snake squeezed violently, its red-gold scales clanging. The patroller's armor instantly shattered, followed by numerous bones breaking throughout his body. After being bitten on the face, the flesh there melted away directly. This patroller died instantly! In this brief process, the terrifying aspects of the blood snake were fully demonstrated: its body hard as iron, astonishing strength, ability to briefly fly through the air like an iron arrow, and potent, intractable venom—all of these were lethal. The other large snake had also flown out of the valley, entering the dense forest. The second patroller was caught, and a desperate scream emanated from that direction. The large snake near the valley entrance abandoned the corpse and entered the forest to continue the chase!

When the fourth patroller was coiled by a blood snake, Group Leader Liu Huaishan suddenly appeared, gripping a sharp saber with both hands and slashing fiercely at the snake's body. This was a full-power slash from a Second Reborn. The gleaming saber light flashed, and some scales on the red-gold-like snake body shattered. A not-so-deep wound appeared, cut open by that terrifying strike, and crimson blood flowed out. This was quite terrifying. If it were other second-mutated creatures, or even Second Reborn humans, facing such a ferocious slash, their bodies would surely have been cut in two. Liu Huaishan continued to strike with both hands on the saber hilt, but unfortunately, he couldn't land the blows in the same spot. The blood snake evaded, only sustaining more wounds on other parts of its body.

Feeling pain, the blood snake immediately released the patroller, who was clearly beyond saving, and attacked Liu Huaishan furiously. At the same time, its hissing attracted the other large snake from not far away, its crimson figure rushing over at top speed. Liu Huaishan sighed inwardly. Abandoning the injured large snake, he plunged into the dense forest without looking back. He had seized the best opportunity but failed to cut down a blood snake, forcing him to decisively give up. The two large snakes relentlessly pursued him. However, the injured large snake's speed grew slower and slower; its body, now wounded, was unsuited to the icy, snowy environment. It stopped, hissed a few times, and finally glided back along its original path towards the valley.

Qin Ming, clad in four layers of armor, had also covered his face with a black cloth this time, revealing only his eyes. He stood on the slope near the valley entrance, quietly waiting. Several iron spears and a long saber were stuck in the snow in front of him. As for the long-handled black-gold hammer, he carried it on his back. A moment later, he heard movement and saw a four-meter-long blood snake returning. It was already injured, with scales missing in three places on its body. Although it still glowed crimson and its body shimmered slightly, it was clearly sluggish and no longer as fast as before.

As it neared the valley, Qin Ming pulled out an iron spear from the ground, took a deep breath, and powerfully hurled it at the blood snake. Then he quickly pulled out a second iron spear from the snow... The blood snake was utterly enraged. Several iron spears flew at an incredibly terrifying speed. Two of them shattered its scales again, and the tearing wounds on its body were even more severe than the earlier saber cuts. It rushed up a twenty-meter-tall tree, then quickly leaped down, like a dazzling crimson streak, instantly tearing through the night, diving down with intent to pierce the target's flesh and blood body.

Qin Ming had originally intended to draw his saber, but now he suddenly changed his mind. He gripped the long-handled black-gold hammer tightly and slammed it out forcefully, meeting the snake's head. The blood snake shot forth like a rainbow piercing the sun, but instead of striking flesh and blood, it collided with the heavy black-gold hammer.

*Clang!* A harsh metallic clang echoed in mid-air, and sparks flew. The four-meter-long blood snake instantly crashed to the ground, its previously rigid body coiling, thrashing violently in the snow. If it were other smaller snakes, Qin Ming wouldn't have used the long-handled black-gold hammer just now, as it was too unwieldy and not suitable for smashing. But with the large snake actively shooting towards him with such astonishing force, he naturally couldn't ask for a better opportunity.

The crimson large snake was severely wounded, its head caved in and bones fractured, but it hadn't died immediately. Qin Ming immediately pulled out the long saber stuck in the snow, stomped through the accumulated snow on the ground, and quickly rushed forward, unleashing his strongest power to continuously slash downwards. Amidst clanging sounds, crimson scales detached, and the snake's head was chopped off!

"This is the 'resource' that can swiftly grant me my second rebirth," Qin Ming thought, still a bit excited. He had harvested a spiritual creature just like that.

"Hiss, hiss!"

Several smaller blood snakes, ranging from three to seven feet long, were near the valley entrance. All began to glide towards him, some even flying, shooting forward like iron arrows. Qin Ming continuously swung his sharp saber. With his full power, he cut them down one by one, adding six more snake corpses to the ground. He took out a beast-skin bag and began to collect his spoils.

Suddenly, a warning flashed in Qin Ming's mind. His body quickly moved sideways to dodge. An iron arrow shot towards him at terrifying speed, disappearing into the spot where he had just stood. Two other iron arrows narrowly grazed his armor, sparking, and embedded themselves deep into a nearby large tree. Qin Ming stood with his saber ready, looking at the few people not far away. He said, "People truly are different. We both guard this place, but I'm only ambushing snakes, while you intend to ambush people."
