# Chapter 47: Exchange  

"Little friend, don't think about it—this spirit tea only has such an effect with the first cup!" Seeing Li Shiming's expression, Gu Jia understood his thoughts and replied with a smile.  

"Thank you, Brother Gu, for the tea!" Li Shiming bowed in gratitude.  

He noticed clearly that among the twenty or so cultivators present, only seven besides him had spirit tea in front of them. The tea served to the others was likely similar to his fake spirit tea, and the spiritual water used was even made from the 'Spring Rain Transformation Art' he had gifted.  

"Once you enter the sect, you'll have to pay me back!" Gu Jia said with a laugh.  

While he and Li Shiming chatted casually, the rogue cultivators nearby remained solemn, exchanging meaningful glances.  

"Brother Gu, that day in the market, a masked cultivator appeared, concealing his spiritual fluctuations but repeatedly making beginner mistakes, leading us to believe he was just starting out," Cultivator Deng spoke up.  

Gu Jia nodded, signaling for him to continue.  

"That cultivator bought three secret manuals from me for twenty spirit stones but didn’t ask about the associated insights," Cultivator Zhang added.  

"It seems that cultivator set a trap for you, and you experienced rogue cultivators still fell for it," Gu Jia remarked, shaking his head.  

As he spoke, his gaze shifted to the elderly cultivator from the Hao family—the one who had suffered the greatest loss.  

Li Shiming was momentarily stunned. So the biggest giveaway had been his purchase of those three secret manuals.  

The manuals sold by Cultivator Zhang were divided into two parts: the spell runes and the insights. Without the insights, experienced cultivators wouldn’t bother buying them.  

A novice, however, would purchase the spell runes first, only to realize they couldn’t practice the technique without the insights. They would then have to return to buy the insights, allowing Cultivator Zhang to profit twice—with the insights being the more expensive part.  

When Li Shiming bought the three manuals without inquiring about the insights, the market cultivators immediately recognized him as a newcomer.  

Moreover, he had previously sold spirit rice and even displayed possession of a storage bag—details that made him a prime target for rogue cultivators looking to rob him.  

This was how many rogue cultivators survived—by seizing resources for themselves.  

Since Li Shiming had later killed two cultivators from the Hao family—one at the third level of Qi Refining and another at the fourth—even Gu Jia now believed it had been a deliberate setup.  

"You know as well as we do that among rogue cultivators, few are stronger than Brother Hao Yanming. He was an early-stage talisman master, a mid-level Qi Refining cultivator with a stockpile of talismans, yet he still fell to that cultivator."

"The Ascension Assembly brings us opportunities, but it also brings great trouble. Our strength simply isn’t enough to manage the market during this period. We hope you’ll agree to move the market into the city until the assembly concludes," Cultivator Deng said with a bitter expression.  

"We’ve discussed it and are willing to increase the spirit stone tribute by fifty percent. Please grant us this request," Cultivator Zhang stood and bowed deeply.  

"Please grant us this request!" The other six cultivators with spirit tea in front of them also rose and bowed.  

Soon, every cultivator in the hall except Li Shiming stood and bowed toward Gu Jia.  

Gu Jia’s eyes flickered as he weighed the pros and cons.  

"Very well, I agree," he said decisively after a moment.  

As a stationed cultivator of the Tianhai Sect and a late-stage Qi Refining expert, he had the authority to make this decision.  

Besides, the closer it got to the Ascension Assembly, the more cultivators would arrive seeking to curry favor with him. Few in Tianhai Sect territory would dare disrespect a sect disciple.  

Relieved smiles spread across the faces of the cultivators. Though they had to pay more in tribute, stabilizing the market ensured their survival. Without it, who would buy their crafted spiritual items?  

One-on-one trades in the cultivation world were unreliable, and robbery was all too common.  

With Gu Jia’s concession, the atmosphere in the hall grew lively.  

The rogue cultivators began exchanging cultivation experiences—a crucial practice for those without sect backing.  

Of course, no one revealed their most valuable insights, but even minor tips could provide new directions for rogue cultivators.  

"Little friend, don’t pay too much attention to their discussions. Wait until you enter the sect," Gu Jia sent a private message to Li Shiming, unheard by the others.  

Hearing the voice in his ear while those nearby remained oblivious, Li Shiming guessed it was a sound transmission technique. Unable to respond in kind, he simply nodded in acknowledgment.  

Indeed, many of the rogue cultivators' self-taught methods were flawed. As a budding cultivator, his future path was not that of a rogue cultivator.  

Seeing Li Shiming heed his advice, Gu Jia smiled and turned to converse with several higher-ranking cultivators.  

"Brother Li, my surname is Hao, and I’m at the sixth level of Qi Refining. What spells are you proficient in? Perhaps we could exchange insights," the elderly Hao cultivator suddenly appeared beside Li Shiming, offering a seemingly benevolent suggestion.  

To an outsider, it might have looked like he was mentoring a junior under Gu Jia’s request.  

But ever since entering the hall, Li Shiming had linked his senses to IBMz15. Using a facial analysis program he had developed, he detected the insincerity behind Hao’s smile.  

The program, which he had coded in his spare time, drew from IBMz15’s vast databases on human behavior, anatomy, criminal psychology, and multiple law enforcement facial recognition systems.  

In his previous life, such a program would have violated countless patents. Here, however, such concerns were irrelevant.  

"Brother Hao, I haven’t learned many spells yet. The one I’m most familiar with is the 'Light Body Technique,'" Li Shiming replied cautiously, feigning youthful shyness.  

At just sixteen, his demeanor matched his age.  

"I do have some experience with the 'Light Body Technique.' Why don’t you demonstrate it, and I’ll offer some pointers?" Hao said warmly.  

Gu Jia, who had been conversing with others, glanced over but said nothing. He trusted that Hao wouldn’t dare try anything under his watch.  

After all, he had just publicly referred to Li Shiming as his "little friend," and in the Zhongdu region, his word carried weight.  

"That’s very kind of you, Brother Hao!" Li Shiming replied with feigned enthusiasm.  

He slowly drew the Light Body rune, deliberately taking two seconds to manifest a faint green glow around his legs.  

Seeing the glow, Elder Hao exhaled in relief.  

"Seems I was mistaken," he thought to himself.
