# Chapter 20: Elder Hanhe Doubts Life, Are You Here to Stock Up?

Meanwhile, inside the Divine Armament Peak courtyard.

"What body-refining martial art did you teach Li Mo?" Hanhe casually probed for information. Even though he believed Murong Xiao couldn't possibly lose, knowing oneself and one's enemy was the key to victory. However, Shang Wu's next sentence nearly made Hanhe spit out all his tea:

"Body-refining martial art? I didn't teach him any."

"Didn't teach him?!"

"He only opened his meridians yesterday. Where would he find the time to learn body-refining techniques?" Shang Wu propped her chin in her hand and yawned lazily. Hanhe's aged face twitched. *You don't even know what your disciple is practicing, yet you dare let him go to the Divine Edge Cave?* He had thought Shang Wu had prepared some secret move to win their bet. And Li Mo... *Surely he didn't just grab some low-grade martial art like Iron Cloth Shirt and foolishly start practicing it, did he?*

At this moment, "Master! Master!" "This is bad!" Murong Xiao rushed into the courtyard, his back drenched in sweat. Not from exhaustion, but from urgency.

"Aren't you cultivating? What's wrong?" Hanhe glanced at his disciple, frowning. He had always believed his disciple possessed a calm mind, which was why he felt assured letting him descend to the second layer of the Divine Edge Cave. Why was he so flustered now? The Divine Edge Cave was right under his nose; what major incident could possibly occur?

"Brother Li has entered the third layer of the Divine Edge Cave!" "Master, quickly go rescue him!" Murong Xiao said hastily. His anxious demeanor was such that anyone unaware of the truth might think his own father had fallen into a river.

"Brother Li? Which Brother Li?" Hanhe didn't react immediately.

"It's Elder Shang Wu's true disciple, Li Mo!"

Hanhe: "?"
Shang Wu: "Huh?"

Li Mo, he'd slipped into the third layer? The third layer was where renowned artifacts were stored. Neither the killing intent of their former masters nor the innate sharpness qi of the Divine Edge Cave itself was something a Qi-Blood Realm cultivator could withstand. The blacksmiths in the courtyard collectively gasped. Having dealt with weapons for years, many of them dared not linger long on the third layer. For a Qi-Blood Realm cultivator to go down there meant certain death.

"That's not right." "How did he get down there?" Hanhe instantly stood up, his face filled with suspicion. To reach the third layer, one must inevitably pass through the second. A martial arts novice who had just entered the Qi-Blood Realm and had no body-refining experience shouldn't even be able to reach the second layer! But seeing Murong Xiao's expression, it clearly wasn't feigned.

"This disciple doesn't know..." Murong Xiao shook his head.

"Perhaps he possesses some exotic treasure, allowing him to block the sharpness qi," Hanhe mused for a moment, considering this possibility.

"He should be fine, right?" Shang Wu's drunkenness sobered instantly. She fumbled inside her robes for her concentric bell, unsure. The bell hadn't rung. Hanhe said gravely, "On the third layer, your disciple was probably seized by killing intent the moment he stepped down!" "With an exotic treasure, he might be safe for a short while..."

No sooner had his words fallen than a red blur shot out like a meteor, quickly dashing away. Where she had been standing, only a large pit remained on the ground.

"Eh, what just whizzed past?" The inner sect steward at the entrance, who was doing registrations, rubbed his eyes.

"And who are you? Register!"

"Look closely, do you see who this old man is!"

"Oh... it's you..." Hanhe followed her in, panting. If a true disciple died in the cave, even as an elder, he would be held responsible.

"Shang Wu, don't you dare collapse my Divine Edge Cave!" he shouted from behind. This was understandable; a disciple who had just entered the Inner Breath Realm once mistakenly entered the third layer of the Divine Edge Cave and had his mind affected. An Inner Scenery Realm cultivator's speed was truly faster than firelight. Literally, fire speed. Shang Wu made no attempt to conceal her aura; the scorching heat waves even overshadowed the sharpness qi of the weapons. Consequently, many trembling cultivators populated the first and second layers of the Divine Edge Cave.

In a short while, Shang Wu arrived at the third layer. However, she suddenly stopped.

"Huh?" Shang Wu's tense expression gradually relaxed, morphing into confusion.

"Shang Wu, my disciple has just saved your disciple's life this time." "This favor, how do you plan to repay—" Elder Hanhe walked down with his hands clasped behind his back. But before he could finish his sentence, his words caught in his throat.

This elder, who had overseen Divine Armament Peak for twenty years, froze on the spot after witnessing the scene before him. Earlier, he had been thinking that he had finally made that crazy woman, Shang Wu, owe him a favor, and she wouldn't be able to come to his Divine Armament Peak to sponge off him anymore. He never expected to see such an unforgettable sight.

He saw the young man sitting on a bluestone, surrounded by dozens of weapons, each radiating an aura of gentle submission. Those were, without exception, renowned artifacts. Every inner sect disciple had the right to select a weapon from the Divine Edge Cave, and if lucky, could even gain a renowned artifact's recognition. Of course, most people could only choose weapons from the second and first layers. To gain the recognition of even one renowned artifact was an immense stroke of luck for an ordinary disciple. One must know that even the elders of various peaks mostly used weapons that were merely renowned artifacts. To gain the recognition of dozens of renowned artifacts at once? Hanhe would rather believe that he, a grandmaster of the Inner Scenery Realm, was old and deluded, his eyes playing tricks on him.

"Gulp—" Hanhe swallowed hard.

"I told you, this kid isn't brainless." "He's practicing quite well, isn't he?" Shang Wu hummed, reverting to her lazy expression.

Hanhe was speechless. *Who was it just now, almost running people over multiple times?* At this point, he had no time to bicker with Shang Wu. He fixed his gaze on the young man surrounded by renowned artifacts, scrutinizing him repeatedly. Even after witnessing countless storms, he couldn't help but doubt his sanity.

"This kid really is cultivating." "Moreover, he's attracted dozens of renowned artifacts, and the killing intent and sharpness qi of this entire area are practically centered around him." "Even a Spirit-Gazing Realm expert would have to be careful." "Yet, he's completely unharmed..." Hanhe himself was a grand artisan, incredibly sensitive to weapons. But the more he understood, the more he realized how difficult this was for a Qi-Blood Realm cultivator!

"Oh, Hanhe, old man." "Doesn't your Divine Edge Cave have a rule?" "That as long as one gains a renowned artifact's recognition, they can take it away?" Shang Wu wiped the corner of her mouth, her apricot eyes gleaming. She didn't even have a renowned artifact herself. Of course, that was because she possessed something even better. But! These were dozens of them! If she were to lead her precious disciple around the third layer a bit more, there might be even more.

Hanhe: "?" *Are you here to stock up?*

"You're mistaken. Each disciple can only take one weapon from the Divine Edge Cave."

"It wasn't like that before."

"Before was before, now is now!"

The effects of the Heart-Cleansing Pill are fading. Li Mo stopped circulating his cultivation technique. Opening his eyes, he looked towards the chilling, faint light in the distance. Just now, when he circulated the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body to its peak, he vaguely sensed something. That wisp of sensation was very faint, but it was definitely there. Something in the deeper parts of the Divine Edge Cave was calling to him.

"Cough, Li Mo, you can choose one of these renowned artifacts to take with you," Elder Hanhe's voice came from behind. Only then did Li Mo come back to his senses, noticing the two people behind him. Elder Hanhe's expression was helpless. His master, on the other hand, was practically drooling at the weapons surrounding him. *Why did they come?*

"Thank you, Elder Hanhe, but I don't plan on choosing a weapon for now." Li Mo cupped his hands. His father's greatest hobby was collecting all sorts of weapons, often saying he dreamed of owning a renowned artifact. He naturally knew how precious renowned artifacts were. But the key was... he hadn't practiced any weapon techniques yet. He couldn't just casually pick a renowned artifact and then choose a corresponding martial art, could he?

"That's right, disciple, no rush," Shang Wu said, then turned back with a beaming smile, chuckling, "When you can go down to the fourth layer of the Divine Edge Cave later, we can take our time picking." "Elder Hanhe, wouldn't you agree?"

Hanhe's eyelids twitched violently. The fourth layer contained what could be considered the Divine Armament Peak's most prized possessions.

"Let's see if you can even get down there first."

"It's only a matter of time." Shang Wu, seeing the annoying old man thwarted, smugly clapped her disciple on the shoulder. With that pat, she noticed something amiss.

"Hm? Xiao Mo, why have you gotten harder?"

"Guess what I came to the Divine Edge Cave to do." Li Mo had a retort he didn't know whether to voice or not. Indeed, the Extreme Weapon Slaughter Body technique was exceptionally effective. At the very least, a slap from his master no longer hurt. He estimated his physical strength had increased by at least thirty percent compared to before, and this was only the first day of practice. It would only get stronger in the future.

"Once my physical strength improves, I'll go deeper." "The thing that resonated with me shouldn't be on the fourth layer; it should be even deeper." Li Mo withdrew his gaze.
