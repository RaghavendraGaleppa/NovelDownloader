# Chapter 364: The External Self-Cultivation Form! The Alert Parents

The Golden Crow projection radiated an even more scorching solar energy. It elevated its realm to the Fifth Eye of Divine Observation, its expression still devoid of emotion, yet its aura grew heavy, as if sensing the fighting spirit of the youth before it.

“Go get him, Big Brother Li!”

Princess Jiang Chulong cheered for him, her voice spirited and loud.

In the next second, sunlight blazed as a colossal sun rose from the Yin-Yang Arena. Under its illumination, everything was laid bare, including the opponent’s moves.

Li Mo held the sword in his right hand and the hammer in his left. His form was shrouded in the pure brilliance of the Great Yin. Amidst the flickering lights and shadows, he located the existence of the Solar Golden Wheel.

The strength of this strange weapon lay in its ability to blend with light and dust.

This time, Junior Li remembered his middle school physics knowledge about optics.

The fish in the river is not where your naked eye sees it... A strange weapon like this should have been met with a sword from the start. He had been far too confident in his hammer.

The Chixiao Sword was thrust out with apparent casualness, looking full of openings, yet it precisely struck the center of the Solar Golden Wheel.

*Clang—*

Sparks flew.

The Golden Wheel was knocked violently downward. The Golden Crow projection, caught off guard, had to burst its True Origin to force the wheel back up.

However, this immense force was borrowed by Li Mo, allowing him to use the momentum to swing his hammer down upon the Great Sun Shadow protecting the Golden Crow.

The light of the Great Sun Shadow flared violently, and the Golden Crow’s figure instantly split into two.

Two figures, accompanied by the Solar Golden Wheel, were like shimmering fish playing in the sunlight. They were overwhelmingly oppressive, yet infinitely variable.

“I lost to this exact move back then,”

Jiang Chulong muttered, nervously gripping the hem of her clothes. The Golden Crow projection at the Divine Observation Realm was clearly much more troublesome.

But the opponent had the Will of the Divine, and so did he.

Li Mo closed his eyes, refusing to look at the dazzling figures of the two Golden Crows. The brilliance of the Great Yin enveloped the area, slowing down the opponent’s movements.

The Chixiao Sword in his right hand was suddenly thrown, carrying entangled karma fire as it spirled to strike the Golden Wheel on the left.

The Forty in his left hand swung from bottom to top, distorting the surrounding sunlight.

This hammer strike seemed weightless, yet it carried the power to shatter the universe. The air around the target condensed. It looked as though it was striking empty air, but that was not the case.

*Clang—*

The other Solar Golden Wheel, hidden within the light and shadow, was sent flying backward with a resounding crash!

The Golden Crow remained expressionless. The flying Golden Wheel absorbed the surrounding light, transforming into a scorching pillar of light that shot toward Li Mo.

However, though struck by the light, Li Mo’s body did not char; instead, it erupted with radiant golden light.

*Vajra Indestructibility!*

Forty rose once more, this time causing the stars in the sky to tremble.

The sunlight remained blinding, but a figure shrouded in the shadow of the Great Sage, wielding a heaven-tilting hammer, charged upward against the light.

*Rumble—*

The Great Sun Shadow trembled, visibly cracking. It could no longer protect the Golden Crow, but instead, it began to burn.

It was the Golden Crow igniting its own Will of the Divine, causing it to explode before it shattered.

The hammer was indeed unusable for the time being, but the appearance of Chixiao was timely. Moreover, the technique used was the *Thousand Feathers of the Fire Crane*, a move long forgotten in some corner of his mind.

The momentum of a wildfire spreading across the plains pierced through the gaps in the True Origin explosion.

*Pfft—*

The Golden Crow projection was pierced through the chest by a sword. The other clone instantly solidified and dissipated into specks of light.

“Truly scorching.”

Li Mo let go of Forty and the Chixiao Sword. His physique was indeed impervious to fire and water, but it still hurt from the heat!

A sense of weakness washed over him, and his breath seemed to carry sparks with it.

Truly worthy of being the Primordial Golden Crow of ancient times.

In its era, it was also one of the most dazzling geniuses of heaven and earth.

Analyzing the opponent’s moves and rhythm of attack, and still fighting so hard without using a Divine Weapon...

“Big Brother Li... you won in one try?”

Jiang Chulong stared blankly at the figure ahead. Even through the blindfold, one could see the bright sparkle in her eyes.

That back was tall enough to block out the sun.

“...”

Actually, he had fought more times than the Princess had.

---

Li Mo shook his head and sighed:

“This Nine Heavens and Ten Earths truly holds countless heroes.”

“Mmm, but Big Brother Li is the strongest.”

“Did you see the Golden Crow’s moves clearly just now, Chulong?”

“I saw them clearly.”

Jiang Chulong nodded vigorously.

After applying the head-patting technique, Princess Jiang, full of energy once again, went to practice her sword.

“After the battle, the Great Sage Shadow has become even more solidified.”

Li Mo looked back at the Great Sage Will behind him, his eyes flashing.

He sat cross-legged on the ground, adjusted his breathing for a moment, and took out the Divine Observation painting of the *Great Sage Raising Havoc in the Heavenly Court*.

This magnificent scene seemed to have become slightly clearer in his eyes.

“My thoughts were correct. This Great Dao Divine Form can only be perfected through constant battle.”

“After defeating the Golden Crow projection, the spirit and fighting intent in my chest have grown even stronger.”

An epiphany arose. Among the many Divine Abilities, one of them lit up slightly, like a pearl in the vast ocean.

The Great Sage Will nodded slightly, as if acknowledging him.

He plucked a golden hair from behind his ear and blew it gently.

The hair, carrying a hazy treasure light, flew into the back of Li Mo’s ear.

*Divine Ability: External Self-Cultivation Form.*

Immersed in the profound ocean of the Divine Ability, a thought popped into Li Mo’s mind.

“The Monkey King has a body full of hairs, but I can only pull out my own hair.”

可见 this Divine Ability has nothing to do with Buddhism...

...

Over the next few days, Li Mo still secretly went to Ying Bing’s room every night. In the middle, he ran into his old man again.

There was no help for it. His Great Sage Will had strengthened his soul. If he continued to dual-cultivate with the Ice Cube every night, he would be on the verge of reaching the Sixth Eye of Divine Observation soon.

But no one knows a son better than his father.

These tiny clues had already alerted Old Man Li Dalong! After all, he was a County Lieutenant responsible for the county’s public security and had arrested many suspects.

His eyes were as precise as a ruler!

“Hey, Dad, you’re up so early again? Doing the second set of radio calisthenics?”

Li Mo came out of the Ice Cube’s room one morning and ran right into his father doing his morning exercises.

This time, the old man didn’t banter with him but looked at him with a scrutinizing expression.

“What were you up to, kid?”

“Buying breakfast.”

“Really?”

Li Dalong crossed his arms, looking suspicious.

Li Mo nodded and timely took a paper bag of steamed buns out of his System Space. Only then did Li Dalong let him go.

But the doubt in Old Li’s heart did not disappear; instead, it grew stronger!

Li Dalong returned to the room and said to his wife:

“Wife, something is off with our son.”

“What’s off?”

“He might... be trying to make me a grandpa behind my back.”

“????”

“I suspect he goes to Little Bing’s room every night, but I don’t have proof.”

Gu Xueqin’s eyes widened slightly. The couple discussed the matter with complex feelings.

It was a good thing, indeed.

But sneaking into a girl’s room before marriage—how improper was that? If it were true, they had to make some preparations early.

Of course, they first had to confirm whether this was actually happening...

Li Mo thought he was being flawless, completely unaware that he had already been listed as a key surveillance target by his parents!
