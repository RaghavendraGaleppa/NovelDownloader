# Chapter 23: A Sudden Windfall, The Assessment Approaches

Bang—

The cold corpse of the black-clad man hidden behind the tree crashed heavily to the ground, a layer of frost forming between his brows that spread like roots down his neck.

Zhang Jing stared blankly at the scattered corpses on the ground, his emotions complex.

When he had confirmed his ability to pass the Dragon Lake Dao Academy's assessment, he knew this day would come. 

He just hadn't expected it to arrive so soon.

And was it really over just like that?

Given the number of opponents and their formation earlier, Zhang Jing had thought it might require a prolonged battle.

Yet from the moment they unleashed their magical flying swords to his counterattack with the double-enhanced Ice Condensation Blade Technique, though the process was complex, the actual combat had lasted less than ten breaths.

"This flying needle artifact is truly unexpected, and its power is formidable. Good thing I stored three Ice Light Curses in the Five Techniques Spirit River beforehand," Zhang Jing muttered as he bent to pick up the fallen needle artifact, a trace of lingering fear in his voice.

The speed of the flying needle had nearly caught him off guard.

Fortunately, after mastering the Ice Light Curse yesterday, Zhang Jing had promptly replaced the unenhanced Ice Condensation Blade Technique in his spirit river with the new curse.

His decision stemmed from the skill characteristic [Double Light] that appeared when the Ice Light Curse reached level one.

The [Double Light] trait allowed his Ice Light Curses to stack seamlessly, functioning as one. 

Thus, with the defensive capability of a single curse fixed, the more layers he had, the more formidable his defense became.

Recalling the recent encounter, Zhang Jing mused, "Three Ice Light Curses in the spirit river still aren't enough. I should switch to four, keeping just one Ice Condensation Blade Technique imbued with the Void Devouring Serpent Dao Rhyme as a surprise attack. After all, one seems sufficient based on that fight."

As he pondered, a weak voice caught his attention.

He turned to see the old man on the ground struggling to crawl toward one of the black-clad corpses, his trembling hand reaching into the dead man's robes as if searching for something.

Wait, this old man looked familiar.

Zhang Jing suddenly remembered—this was the same elder who had passed by him when he first entered the market. At the time, he'd noticed the man's unstable foundation and impure spiritual energy, concluding his cultivation would stagnate.

Now, his prediction had come true.

"Young master," the old man seemed to find what he was looking for and turned to Zhang Jing with pleading eyes. "Might this old man propose a trade?"

---

"Elder, please explain first," Zhang Jing said with a smile.

Hearing this, the old man's face flushed with a sudden vigor, as if revitalized. "I possess an extremely precious cultivation legacy which I'll gift to you immediately. All I ask is that you find a kind family to take in my poor grandson so he may survive."

With his last ounce of strength, the old man tossed the legacy toward Zhang Jing.

He harbored no thoughts of deception.

The elder knew that regardless of the young man's choice, the legacy would end up in his hands anyway. His only hope was to gamble on Zhang Jing's kindness.

"A precious cultivation legacy?"

Zhang Jing caught the bundle with ease, revealing a jade slip inside. He probed it with his spiritual sense and immediately obtained information about the technique—the Green Sparrow Qi Gathering Method, a lower-grade cultivation art.

As Zhang Jing examined it, the old man gasped heavily before continuing, "Young master, as a cultivator, you surely understand this method's value. Presenting it to the Dao Academy might earn you admission. Those four men pursued us for this very legacy."

"Would you accept this trivial favor in exchange?"

"Is this legacy truly valuable?" Zhang Jing asked with a strange expression.

"Of course! Its revelation could incite countless cultivators to fight for it."

Zhang Jing fell silent, realizing the vast disparity between rogue cultivators and Dao Academy disciples.

A lower-grade legacy might not be rare among academy disciples, who could also select techniques best suited to their affinities.

But for rogue cultivators...

Zhang Jing shook his head. 

The Green Sparrow Qi Gathering Method was useless to him. Its grade was too low, and forcing its practice would only waste time, hindering his progress with the Five Organs Liberation Water Element Technique.

Still, he memorized the entire method.

Only when the jade talisman displayed the new skill did he nod in satisfaction. 

He might not practice it, but having it was better than not.

After the assessment, he'd consult Senior Brother Liu about exchanging the method for academy merits or another legacy.

---

Turning back to the old man, Zhang Jing found him lifeless, his body frozen in an expectant gaze.

But—

Zhang Jing was powerless to fulfill the old man's dying wish.

The boy had already perished.

Perhaps the elder's failing senses prevented him from noticing, or perhaps he knew but refused to accept reality.

With a sigh, Zhang Jing turned to a time-honored tradition in the cultivation world—looting.

"This flying sword artifact is a bit worn but intact. I'll take it."

"Silver? Do cultivators even need this? Well, I'll take it anyway."

"These blades aren't artifacts, but they're exceptionally sharp. Might as well keep them."

"Wait—" Zhang Jing paused, spotting a grayish beast-skin pouch at the black-clad man's waist. "A storage pouch?!"

He'd seen these before.

Snatching it, he probed inside with his spiritual sense.

No resistance.

A five-foot cubic space unfolded in his perception, containing clothes, a small cloth bag, an exquisite jade box, and some gold and silver, occupying about a third of the pouch.

"It really is a storage pouch!"

Excitement flashed across his face.

His spiritual sense touched the items, and a peculiar sensation arose—with a mere thought, he could retrieve them.

Understanding dawned.

Clothes suddenly appeared in his hand.

Then—

A sharp whistling sound approached rapidly.

Zhang Jing's expression changed as he swiftly stored his spoils and stood, looking toward the source.

A flying vessel approached, carrying two green-robed cultivators.

"Dao Academy seniors? Market enforcers?"

Before he could react, the vessel halted before him in three breaths.

---

Two green-robed men descended gracefully.

The shorter one glanced at the corpses before fixing a cold gaze on Zhang Jing. "Did you kill these people? Don't you know combat is forbidden within the market's bounds?"

The taller man stepped forward, smiling. "You must be a new disciple from this year's intake?"

"Yes, greetings, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied with a nod.

"Since you're a junior brother, no harm done. But could you explain these corpses?"

After a moment's thought, Zhang Jing said, "I encountered these four attacking the old man and boy on my way back. When they saw me, they attacked without provocation."

He shrugged. "I acted in self-defense."

"I see!" The taller man nodded understandingly and stepped aside. "You may return to the academy. We'll handle this."

"Thank you, Senior Brother."

"No need. It's our duty."

After ensuring nothing was left behind, Zhang Jing hurried toward the academy.

Once he was out of sight, the shorter man asked, "Why let him go? That's against protocol. How do we know he's telling the truth?"

"I don't," the taller man admitted.

"Then why—"

Shaking his head in disappointment, the senior asked, "Is he a new disciple?"

"At the first level of Qi Refining with such pure spiritual energy—he must be practicing a mid-grade method. Definitely a new disciple."

"Then does his story's veracity matter?"

The taller man's tone was profound.

"I don't follow."

"Fool! Think—it's been less than half a month since their assessment began."

He pointed at the corpses. "A newcomer defeating four second-level Qi Refining cultivators alone—what talent! If he lied, that'd be even more terrifying."

"Why antagonize someone destined for the inner academy?"

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother."

"Now, let's clean up."

---

"Finally sorted!"

Back in his room, Zhang Jing exhaled, smiling at the neatly arranged spoils.

First, the two artifacts: the flying sword and needle.

The sword's internal formations were intact—a free artifact. The needle's were destroyed, so he stored it away.

From the storage pouch and bodies, he'd gathered forty-seven spirit stones, replenishing his reserves.

The jade box contained three lower-grade talismans—to be sold after the assessment. He preferred his Five Techniques Spirit River's reliability.

In total, including the storage pouch and sword, his haul exceeded two hundred spirit stones.

A sudden windfall, courtesy of the four "generous" assailants.

After a brief rest, Zhang Jing entered the training chamber.

With the assessment's conclusion nearing, the final ranking method would soon be revealed.

A sense of urgency drove him to cultivate relentlessly.

Time flowed quietly.

As those with third and fourth-tier evaluations arrived, the Legacy Pavilion and surrounding areas grew lively.

One morning, two radiant streaks of light shot from the pavilion, halting above the central plaza.

The lights resolved into two purple-robed men, their immortal auras and overwhelming presence dominating the space.

---

"They're here! The ranking method's being announced," exclaimed some outer disciples below.

"Twenty-nine second-tier geniuses this year, plus two top-tier monsters. Even some third-tier ones might surprise us."

"The top ten get fifty merits monthly! We risk our lives battling demons for a year and earn less than they do in two months. Is that fair?"

"Quit whining. You didn't make the top ten back then."

Above, one purple-robed man waved his hand.

Rumble—

The plaza trembled as massive stone pillars erupted from the ground, piercing the clouds.
