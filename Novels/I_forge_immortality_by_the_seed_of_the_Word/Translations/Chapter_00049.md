# Chapter 49: If You Must Ask, It's Talent  

"A great opportunity, and the deputy captain wants to see me?" Zhang Jing closed the door behind him and followed Senior Brother Ding outside, his voice tinged with curiosity.  

"Indeed!" Senior Brother Ding led the way while explaining, "Junior Brother, you may not know this. After settling in yesterday, I immediately went to pay my respects to Senior Brother Li. It suddenly occurred to me that even Junior Sister Tong Yao didn’t know about your talent for talisman-making. You might not realize it, but the Luodu Squad highly values special cultivators like alchemists, artificers, and talisman masters."  

"So I mentioned it to Senior Brother Li. When he heard, he was eager to meet you—this prodigious talisman-maker!"  

Understanding dawned on Zhang Jing. He realized Senior Brother Ding had gone out of his way to help him.  

"Thank you for your kindness, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing said gratefully.  

"Haha, no need for formalities, Junior Brother," Senior Brother Ding chuckled, rubbing his hands together. "If you ever craft mid-grade or even high-grade talismans in the future, just remember this favor and give me a small discount—I’d be endlessly grateful."  

"Rest assured, Senior Brother!"  

As they spoke, the two traversed the bustling streets of Langya County until they arrived at the county office at the city’s center.  

Two teams of stern-faced guards stood watch by the vermilion gates. Upon spotting Zhang Jing and Senior Brother Ding in their cyan robes, the guards immediately straightened with reverence and swiftly opened the gates.  

They approached a secluded courtyard, and as soon as they drew near, the gate swung open on its own. A booming voice rang out:  

"Thank you for your trouble, Junior Brother Ding. So this is Junior Brother Zhang? Please, come in!"  

"Senior Brother Li, I’ve brought Junior Brother Zhang as requested. I’ll take my leave now," Senior Brother Ding said with a cupped-hand salute toward the courtyard.  

"Take care, Junior Brother Ding," the voice replied.  

Turning to Zhang Jing, Senior Brother Ding advised, "Junior Brother, I have other matters to attend to. Just go straight in—Senior Brother Li is very approachable. No need to be nervous."  

"Thank you, Senior Brother."  

With that, Senior Brother Ding departed.  

Taking a deep breath, Zhang Jing stepped into the courtyard.  

Inside, he saw a youthful-looking boy, seemingly no older than fifteen or sixteen, sitting on a stone stool and smiling at him.  

Zhang Jing couldn’t help but feel a flicker of surprise at the sight. Nonetheless, he maintained his composure and greeted, "Zhang Jing pays his respects to Senior Brother Li."  

---  

"Come, Junior Brother, take a seat," the boy beckoned.  

Once Zhang Jing was seated, Senior Brother Li explained lightly, "This youthful appearance of mine is due to a unique cultivation technique. I hope you won’t find it amusing."  

Without waiting for a response, Senior Brother Li got straight to the point, his voice hearty and direct:  

"I heard you’ve already mastered crafting low-grade talismans?"  

Zhang Jing nodded. "I wouldn’t dare deceive you, Senior Brother. It’s true that I can now produce low-grade talismans."  

"Only low-grade?" Senior Brother Li drew out his words teasingly, his eyes glinting with amusement as he produced a Starlight Guidance Talisman. "Junior Brother, you’re being too modest."  

"Having entered the Dao Academy barely over a month ago and only begun cultivation two months prior, yet you’re already crafting premium-quality low-grade talismans—and in considerable quantities at that. Such talent is nothing short of extraordinary."  

"You flatter me, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.  

"No, I speak nothing but the truth," Senior Brother Li said seriously after a moment of thought.  

"Here’s my proposal: as part of the squad’s benefits, we’ll cover all the materials you need for crafting low-grade talismans. Additionally, regardless of the type, we’ll buy every talisman you make at market price."  

"Of course, you’re free to sell them elsewhere if you prefer."  

"However, once you start producing mid-grade talismans, there will be a minimum monthly quota for what you sell to the squad. But don’t worry—we won’t make things difficult for our own."  

Pausing, Senior Brother Li fixed Zhang Jing with a meaningful look and added,  

"Junior Brother, don’t hold back. Be bold and unrestrained in your work. As a member of the Luodu Squad, the more prodigious you prove to be, the more resources you’ll receive."  

"Above us stand senior brothers from the Inner Court, and below us are numerous cultivators at late-stage Qi Refinement or even Perfection. No one in the Dao Academy would dare target you—unless they wish for utter annihilation!"  

"Thank you for your guidance, Senior Brother. I understand now." Zhang Jing stood and bowed solemnly.  

Senior Brother Li’s words shattered Zhang Jing’s previous apprehensions.  

He had been trapped in a mental block—worrying about how to gradually reveal his abnormally high talisman success rate, or the fact that after condensing the Source Talisman, he could achieve a flawless success rate and produce talismans as effortlessly as a printing press. He had agonized over how to explain these feats if discovered.  

But now, he realized—why bother explaining at all?  

If anyone asked, the answer was simple: talent.  

If those two monstrously gifted prodigies could possess heaven-defying cultivation talents, why couldn’t he, Zhang Jing, have an equally monstrous talent for talismans?  

Especially Senior Brother Li’s assurance—"No one in the Dao Academy would dare target you, unless they wish for utter annihilation"—had thoroughly awakened him.  

---  

Noticing the subtle shift in Zhang Jing’s expression, Senior Brother Li gave an imperceptible nod of approval.  

"Junior Brother, what’s your current success rate for crafting low-grade talismans?" he asked curiously.  

"Reporting to Senior Brother, my current success rate is around forty percent."  

Senior Brother Li’s expression froze momentarily.  

Though he wasn’t a talisman-maker himself, he had interacted with enough to know precisely what that percentage signified.  

"And the probability of producing premium-quality talismans?" he pressed.  

"Forty percent," Zhang Jing answered calmly.  

With all his previous concerns now dispelled, there was no need to hold back. Of course, this was his success rate before the emergence of the Crimson Divine Radiance. Now, with its enhancement, he wasn’t entirely sure how high his success rate for low-grade talismans might be.  

"So, Junior Brother, you’re saying every talisman you craft is of premium quality?"  

Zhang Jing nodded.  

Silence filled the air.  

Then—  

"Hahaha, excellent!" Senior Brother Li broke the quiet with a hearty laugh, his eyes gleaming as he regarded Zhang Jing. "It seems the Luodu Squad is about to nurture a grandmaster of talismans."  

"Junior Brother, come with me."  

With that, Senior Brother Li motioned for Zhang Jing to follow him elsewhere.  

"Senior Brother, where are we going?"  

"I’m taking you to meet the other talisman-makers in our squad. Once you demonstrate your skills, I can officially promote you to an elite member."  

"Elite member?" Zhang Jing echoed in confusion.  

"Indeed. Members of the Luodu Squad automatically become elite once they reach mid-stage Qi Refinement and complete three missions. Elite members gain access to the squad’s resource vault, where they can exchange for cultivation materials at eighty percent of the market price in the Thousand Methods Pavilion."  

Senior Brother Li elaborated,  

"The Junior Brother Ding who brought you here will become an elite after this mission. But for talisman-makers like you, the criteria are different. As long as your success rate for low-grade talismans exceeds thirty percent—once verified—you’ll be promoted to elite status immediately."  

"This is what sets the top ten squads apart from the rest."  

"Senior Brother, what exactly is this resource vault?" Zhang Jing suddenly realized that the jade slip given to him by Senior Sister Tong Yao hadn’t mentioned any of this.  

---  

"You’ll understand once you return to Luodu Island. It contains all sorts of cultivation resources—various grades of spirit pills, rare natural treasures, magical artifacts, talismans, and more. Essentially, everything you’d find in the Thousand Methods Pavilion is available there."
