## Chapter 159: Sweeping Through

Nearby, hot springs flowed, illuminating the training ground brightly.

Qin Ming, clad in green robes, with wide sleeves billowing in the wind, appeared ethereal and transcendent, imbued with a touch of immortal grace. Before him, the white-robed youth lay prostrate on the azure-gold stone ground, covered in blood, his clothes tattered and ragged.

The stark contrast between them—one nearly immortal, the other utterly disheveled—coupled with Qin Ming's words, caused many in the Outer Immortal Realm to lose face.

“It’s good to be young; you can just lie down and sleep anywhere,” an old man from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court chuckled.

Undoubtedly, this remark displeased the elders of the Outer Immortal Realm. They cast sidelong glances, noting the few sparse hairs on his head, and felt an urge to pluck them out. When someone secretly informed them that this was the Six Imperial Young Patriarch's personal head disciple, they immediately sat up straight, deciding to simply tolerate the old fellow's pungent 'immortal qi'. There was no other way; on the Path of Rebirth, the older one got, the more dangerous it became. One's cultivation relied entirely on enduring time. Even experts from the Outer Realm did not wish to clash with such an old man, whose coffin lid was already half-closed.

Soon, people from the Outer Realm carried away the white-robed youth.

The disciples of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court erupted in fervent discussion, all talking about which senior brother this was. His methods were truly exquisite; he had defeated his opponent in a single move. Qin Ming had promised Lu Zizai that he would act decisively, sweeping through and forcefully breaking through the Outer Immortal Realm's challengers. Naturally, he held nothing back.

“Did you all understand what happened?” an elder from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court asked his disciples, testing them.

“Have you grasped his techniques?” a middle-aged man from the Outer Immortal Realm also gravely questioned his disciples.

“He used Yimu Vitality to receive the withered wood energy, which was of the same origin and formed a bud. For some reason, he sealed the Pure Yang Consciousness Spiritual Light within the bud. I suspect he used an unknown miraculous technique. Then, he ignited the two buds in the wood domain with some mysterious fire energy and detonated the Pure Yang Consciousness Spiritual Light.”

Someone was replaying the fight, dissecting part of the truth. Many realized the truth, then were greatly astonished. Such an effortless move, seemingly peaceful, like an immortal plucking a flower and smiling – yet he had consecutively changed three miraculous techniques in the shortest amount of time. How could an ordinary person achieve that?

A young woman walked into the training ground, clad in silver armor, a wisp of dark hair escaping her helmet. She appeared quite beautiful, her steps light and agile. This Outer Realm disciple remained silent, but her moves, once she struck, were entirely contrary to her gentle demeanor: sharp, swift, and forceful. Dispelling her gentle expression, dense purple glow erupted from her palm, accompanied by flames. Large swathes of purple mist also swirled around her feet as she swiftly lunged towards her opponent.

Qin Ming felt envious. How many miraculous techniques had the Outer Realm truly acquired? Wisps of water mist appeared around his body, drawing in the flowing hot springs. Crimson glow swirled around him, and shimmering mist diffused, creating a truly beautiful and captivating sight.

The young woman's entire body was covered in purple mist, followed by a surge of flames. This was the Violet Palace Thunderfire from the *Immortal Combat Scripture*, extremely powerful and specifically designed to counter various Heavenly Radiance Energies. The group from the Outer Immortal Realm showed expressions of anticipation, feeling that the green-robed youth was about to suffer a great loss. Because Violet Palace Thunderfire was very peculiar; it could ignite various Heavenly Radiance Energies. The young woman had already charged close, appearing as if bathed in purple flames, a manifestation of Heavenly Radiance Energy concentrated to its extreme, fully unleashed. This was one of the killer moves from the *Immortal Combat Scripture*.

Someone secretly lamented, "What a pity, the young woman hasn't mastered it completely. Of the Violet Palace Thunderfire, she has only cultivated the fire energy, without releasing the thunder energy. Otherwise, if the opponent didn't use Six Imperial Energy, he would surely suffer a great loss."

Many disciples of the Six Imperial Ancestral Court changed their expressions. They were exceptionally sensitive to Heavenly Radiance Energy and felt the terrifying power of the purple Heavenly Radiance Energy. Even from a distance, standing outside the arena, they felt a tremor in their hearts.

Qin Ming was surprised. This purple Heavenly Radiance Energy was indeed extraordinary, but in the end, the opponent had not fully mastered it. The faint thunderous sounds within it could not be unleashed, indicating flaws and loopholes. Qin Ming swiftly transformed his Heavenly Radiance Energy, and the water mist dissipated. In an instant, the towering ancient trees surrounding the training ground all swayed, as massive amounts of Yimu Vitality surged continuously towards him. His method of extinguishing the fire in this manner was undoubtedly fanning the flames.

In a flash, the Violet Palace Thunderfire energy throughout the young woman's body surged dramatically, and the flames spread, threatening to spiral completely out of control. Then, Qin Ming activated the *River Flowing Scripture*. In an instant, he drew all the hot springs from the ground into mid-air, causing a vast amount of clouds and mist to rise. He unleashed his River Flowing Energy, sending it crashing towards the young woman along the clouds and mist. Water and fire are incompatible. Immediately afterward, a massive explosion occurred there! When Heavenly Radiance Energies of different natures met, the outcome would be drastically different.

“Boom.”

Inside the training ground, the colossal explosion was deafening. The so-called purple fire spun out of control, giving rise to astonishing thunderclaps.

Crack!

Lightning intertwined, and purple flames flickered. The young woman screamed, her entire body convulsing. She had been backlashed by her own Violet Palace Thunderfire energy. She still couldn't unleash the thunder energy, only the fire energy, but with her opponent fanning the flames, the thunder energy was involuntarily brought forth, leaving her entire body numb and twitching uncontrollably. She collapsed, unable to get up, her clothes torn, blood seeping from between her armor plates. Her beautiful face was turning from green to black, her life in critical danger.

Not far away, Qin Ming stood motionless, his feet still. Just like that, he had swiftly dealt with another opponent.

In the Outer Immortal Realm, the group fell silent. Normally, when this young woman practiced Violet Palace Thunderfire, she couldn't unleash the thunder energy. Yet today, with her opponent's 'help', she had indeed activated it – only for it to surge wildly within her own body.

“What are you gawking at? Quickly, save her!” an elder barked.

“What is she doing? A so-called suicide attack?” Qin Ming murmured, but his voice was still heard by many.

At the Six Imperial Ancestral Court, a group of people burst into laughter. The Outer Immortal Realm contingent had ugly expressions. This was truly... an accurate assessment.

In truth, the young woman’s Violet Palace Thunderfire was quite extraordinary, yet Qin Ming had effortlessly diffused it, using only two types of Heavenly Radiance Energy to detonate her own power. This was not merely a display of technique; it was also a precise interpretation of the battle situation and the seizing of opportunity with exquisite perfection. Even if an ordinary person could think of it afterward, how could they react so quickly in the moment? In fact, many people couldn't even detect the serious hidden dangers within her Violet Palace Thunderfire, let alone exploit such flaws and loopholes.

Two consecutive defeats caused the group from the Outer Immortal Realm to lose significant face. Several old seniors had wanted to test their methods, even helping them refine partial Pure Yang Consciousness Spiritual Light, yet this was the outcome.

A third youth entered the training ground, clad in crimson-gold armor, with spiritual light swirling before his brow, capable of merging with terrifying Heavenly Radiance Energy. He approached step by step, exuding a palpable sense of oppression.

This time, Qin Ming took the initiative to attack, not wishing to waste too much time with them. He remembered Lu Zizai's words well: swiftly pierce through them, make them swallow their own words, and immediately return to the Immortal Realm to recover from their injuries.

Qin Ming’s fist glowed, like blooming thunder, dazzling to the extreme, completely breaking through with brute force.

Rumble!

In the arena, blinding light burst forth between the two. This person still utilized a cultivation method from the *Immortal Combat Scripture*. His Heavenly Radiance Energy was very strong, with a hazy purple glow flowing around his entire body, and his defensive power was astonishing. However, he was sent trembling by Qin Ming's strikes. During their clash, most of his purple Heavenly Radiance Energy was shattered, his palms became bloody and mangled, and his finger bones were visible. With a loud boom, in the subsequent clashes, he stubbornly counterattacked, but ultimately flew backward, crashing into the crowd, unable to get up again.

“You should still spar with me using the methods of the Outer Realm,” Qin Ming spoke. Though his words were plain, they sounded extremely grating to the Outer Realm disciples.

“I thought your old seniors, having deciphered scriptures left by an ancestor on the Path of Rebirth, would have taught you to be very formidable. Now, it seems you truly aren't suited for the Path of Rebirth,” an elder from the Six Imperial Ancestral Court openly mocked.

A yellow-robed youth stepped into the arena without a word. This time, he displayed a cultivation method that made everyone's expressions turn grave. His Heavenly Radiance Energy was incredibly robust, manifesting many golden glowing arms around his body, all striking towards Qin Ming, like the descendant of a multi-armed fiendgod. Undoubtedly, this cultivation method was extremely powerful. If cultivated to the perfected stage, its might would be immense. It was said that deep within the Night Mist World, there were god-like creatures with thousands of arms. For this cultivation method to manifest multiple arms through Heavenly Radiance Energy alone, it was naturally no small feat.

Qin Ming saw the fundamental problem: the opponent was still relying on consciousness spiritual light to bear the Heavenly Radiance Energy, and his own body couldn't possibly materialize the Heavenly Radiance into forms. The void roared. The yellow-robed youth's hair even turned golden-yellow as eight pairs of golden arms danced. Some swung fists, some unleashed palm forces, and some extended claws, displaying tremendous might.

Qin Ming's expression remained calm. He activated the *River Flowing Scripture*, instantly causing the surrounding water mist to thicken. He continuously drew in the hot springs, filling the sky with clouds, water mist, and crimson glow. In an instant, he unleashed Wind-Thunder Energy. Originally, lightning could only appear near his body, but after cultivating the *River Flowing Scripture*, he had altered the entire environment here. Now, winds surged and clouds gathered, lightning appeared and spread outwards along the water mist. Subsequently, thunder echoed ceaselessly throughout the area. Amidst the rumbling, the yellow-robed youth was struck, his body smoking and convulsing repeatedly. His eight pairs of golden arms disintegrated, and he screamed, collapsing onto the ground, utterly charred.

In the training ground, clouds surged. Qin Ming's wide sleeves fluttered, and his expression was serene. Moreover, the vast mist he formed from the hot springs was exceptionally brilliant. This entire area was like a shimmering, cloud-filled paradise, and he seemed to stand beside a heavenly palace in the clouds, like an immortal.

“This...” Many were dumbfounded. Who exactly was walking the Path of Immortality? No matter how one looked at it, this green-robed youth was far more extraordinary and ethereal than any disciple from the Outer Immortal Realm who had entered the arena.

The white-robed young woman, Luo Yao, was stunned. How could the people on the Path of Rebirth be completely different from what she imagined? They possessed even more immortal dao charm than them, and how could they be so powerful?

Subsequently, another youth entered the arena. He directly employed the Outer Realm's methods, even utilizing a portion of the Pure Yang Consciousness Spiritual Light that had been refined by old seniors, activating a spirit artifact that glowed with brilliant radiance. However, with a 'crack', Qin Ming's right palm glowed, as if unleashing a palm-thunder strike, shattering the spirit artifact. Here, winds surged and clouds gathered, lightning intertwined. Amidst the rumbling, the youth from the Outer Immortal Realm foamed at the mouth, his entire body blackened, lying on the ground twitching, once again defeated in a highly undignified manner.

“You walk the Path of Immortality. This is an immortal technique I've devised myself. Sparring with you can be considered the most fitting reciprocal exchange,” Qin Ming stated.

The expressions of the group changed! The Outer Realm people challenged the Six Imperial Ancestral Court with techniques from the Path of Rebirth, and he retaliated with 'immortal techniques'? Although everyone knew these were not truly methods from the Path of Immortality. However, when those secret arts were performed by him, they indeed possessed more immortal qi than many profound methods of the Path of Immortality.

The Outer Immortal Realm had only one remaining challenger, a purple-haired youth named Li Daocheng, who now stood up. He was a true anomaly, and his foundation had been elevated, making his reserves astonishingly deep. However, the group from the Outer Immortal Realm had long lost their confidence. An elder even grabbed Li Daocheng, preventing him from entering the fight, because today was already a crushing defeat, utterly undignified. If the last person was also defeated, what face would they have left?

“Elder, let me go! I guarantee I'll take him down!” Li Daocheng spoke with great confidence. He was the only one who had cultivated the complete *Immortal Combat Scripture*, thanks to his extraordinary talent.

The elder didn't let go, his heart filled with hesitation, wavering on whether to continue 'testing their methods'.

“Senior, if you let him enter, I can fight him with one hand,” Qin Ming said with a smile.
