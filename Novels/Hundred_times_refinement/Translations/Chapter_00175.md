# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass  
Chapter 123: Heavenly Thunder Technique  

Not only the disciples of the Thunder Sword Sect, but nearly all the nearby cultivators had their attention focused here, with many wearing expressions of schadenfreude.  

"Haha, it's just a minor misunderstanding. Thank you for your concern, Brother Xu, but I can handle it myself." After a brief pause, Lin Xuan replied with an unchanged expression.  

The Thunder Sword Sect disciples sighed in relief, while Lei Ao's face twisted into a peculiar mix of relief and reluctance.  

"In that case, I won't interfere further. If there's anything you need, Brother Lin, don't hesitate to ask. No need to stand on ceremony."  

As Xu Feng spoke, he glanced pointedly at Lei Ao, who immediately lowered his head, avoiding his gaze.  

"Rest assured, Brother Xu. In my heart, I've always considered you a friend."  

The moment Lin Xuan said this, the young girl beside them jumped up excitedly. "Brother! Brother Lin! Look over there!"  

Following her pointing finger, they saw a radiant glow and swirling immortal mist on the other side of the Immortal Welcoming Bridge. Dozens of disciples from the Breeze Cloud Sect floated gracefully toward them, led by an elderly man with white hair and beard. Though he appeared around seventy years old, he lacked any frailty typical of mortals, exuding vitality instead.  

"My apologies for keeping you all waiting, fellow cultivators," the old man said with a cupped fist salute. "I am Luo Wei, the Breeze Cloud Sect's steward in charge of receiving guests. Please follow me."  

This elder was at the mid-stage of Foundation Establishment.  

This alone demonstrated the might of the three great sects—even an inner disciple handling mundane affairs possessed cultivation no weaker than the elites of second or third-rate sects.  

To the Breeze Cloud Sect, Foundation Establishment cultivators were nothing extraordinary.  

"You're too kind, fellow Daoist."  

After exchanging pleasantries, the crowd on the bridge followed Luo Wei to the other side.  

A breathtaking garden unfolded before them.  

Exotic flowers and rare herbs bloomed in vibrant competition, creating a mesmerizing sight.  

Yet the most striking feature was the enormous teleportation formation at the garden's center.  

Though Lin Xuan hadn't cultivated for long—only a few years—compared to his peers, he was well-traveled and knowledgeable.  

To his knowledge, ordinary teleportation formations could only transport a handful of people at once. One capable of carrying over a hundred simultaneously was unheard of.  

Lin Xuan wasn't the only one astonished; nearly all the accompanying cultivators wore expressions of shock.  

"Haha, please excuse our humble display," Luo Wei said with a beaming smile, though his tone carried unmistakable pride. "This massive teleportation formation was recently developed by several of our elders skilled in formations. Given that our Breeze Cloud Sect frequently hosts visitors—such as the thousands attending this Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony—a small teleportation formation would be highly inconvenient, wouldn't it?"  

His words, though polite, carried an undercurrent of intimidation. Only a top-tier sect like theirs could develop such an advanced formation.  

Lin Xuan noted the varied reactions—loose cultivators remained indifferent, while those from sects and families looked uneasy. Even Xu Feng's gaze turned cold, though his thoughts were unreadable.  

Only Lin Xuan maintained his composure, feigning ignorance.  

With hidden agendas, the group stepped onto the formation. Luo Wei directed Breeze Cloud disciples to embed spirit stones around it, then cast a spell at the formation's core.  

With a resonant hum, the formation activated. A dazzling array of lights later, they vanished from the spot.  

...  

Stunned expressions spread across many faces at the sight before them.  

What did a paradise on earth look like?  

This was the perfect depiction.  

Pavilions and towers stood amidst birdsong and floral fragrance, while rare beasts roamed freely. Thick mist swirled beneath their feet, making them feel as though they stood amidst a sea of clouds.  

"Fellow Daoists, we've arrived at our sect's inner grounds. The Nascent Soul Formation Ceremony begins tomorrow. Until then, you're free to explore and admire Breeze Cloud Mountain's scenery. However, certain restricted areas are off-limits—these are marked in the jade slips I'll distribute."  

Luo Wei produced a storage pouch and lightly tapped it, sending out countless red beams that landed in each visitor's hand—jade slips containing a map of Breeze Cloud Mountain.  

"If you grow weary, you may retire to the guest lodgings. Alternatively, you may head there now—other disciples will attend to you." With another cupped fist salute, Luo Wei added, "I have other matters to attend to, so I must take my leave."  

"Brother Lin, let's explore together!" Xu Yin chirped, extending an invitation.  

"Indeed, Junior Brother Lin," Xu Feng added. "Since you're the only representative from your sect, why not join us? There's safety in numbers."  

"Thank you both for your kindness," Lin Xuan declined politely. "But I prefer solitude and wouldn't want to impose."  

"You—" Xu Yin began, only to be cut off by her brother, who shot Lin Xuan a displeased look. The sweet-faced young beauty pouted adorably in her irritation.  

"Very well. In that case, Junior Brother Lin, do take care. We'll meet at the guest lodgings later."  

"Agreed." Lin Xuan returned the salute with a fist-palm gesture, then transformed into a streak of light and sped away.  

"Brother, why must we humble ourselves before that arrogant Lin Xuan?" Xu Yin grumbled once he was gone.  

"Little sister," Xu Feng chided, giving her a stern look. "Junior Brother Lin's Revitalizing Elixir saved your life. Is this how you speak of your benefactor?"  

"I'm just annoyed! We extended our kindness, yet he pushed us away like that."  

"Enough of this childish behavior. Junior Brother Lin likely has his reasons." He patted her head affectionately, though his expression turned serious as he addressed the other disciples. "Remember—Lin Xuan isn't just my sister's savior. He's also the future leader of the Spirit Herb Mountain. What alchemy means to us cultivators needs no explanation. I trust you all know how to conduct yourselves."  

"Senior Brother, rest assured. We understand."  

"Of course we wouldn't offend the future master of Spirit Herb Mountain."  

...  

Pleased with their responses, Xu Feng nodded. The Heavenly Mountain group then flew toward the guest lodgings.  

Meanwhile, after parting ways with the Xu siblings, Lin Xuan flew a short distance before stopping. He retrieved the jade slip containing the Breeze Cloud Mountain map and infused it with his spiritual sense.  

A short while later, he looked up, identified his direction, and flew southeast.  

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan arrived at a desolate area.  

Ahead stood only a few sparse trees—a stark contrast to the paradise-like scenery earlier.  

"This is the place."  

Muttering to himself, Lin Xuan descended.  

After scanning the surroundings with his spiritual sense, a faint smile touched his lips. "Come out. I'm here. Are you still trying to play tricks?"  

"You jest, Young Master. How would this lowly one dare?"  

A familiar, sycophantic voice rang out as a wisp of blue mist materialized ahead, from which Lei Ao emerged.  

"I spared you as agreed. Now hand over the treasure you promised."  

Lin Xuan wasn't inherently wicked, but neither was he a pushover. His creed was clear—repay kindness and vengeance in equal measure. He'd magnanimously let Lei Ao off, not out of softness, but because the latter had begged for mercy via voice transmission, offering a treasure in apology.  

Destroying the Thunder Sword Sect would've merely vented his anger. Securing a treasure was far more practical.  

"Enough talk. Produce the item."  

"Yes!" Noting Lin Xuan's impatience, Lei Ao hastily reached into his robe and retrieved an object from his storage pouch.  

"This is..."  

Lin Xuan's brow arched as he examined it—a tattered book bearing three large characters: *Heavenly Thunder Technique*.  

"A cultivation manual?"  

Disappointment flashed across Lin Xuan's face. He already possessed the *Nine Heavens Profound Art*. Regardless of the *Heavenly Thunder Technique*'s power, it would be of little use to him. Moreover, what could a fourth-rate sect possibly offer that was remarkable?  

"Young Master, don't dismiss it yet. This lowly one wouldn't dare deceive you. While the *Heavenly Thunder Technique* isn't a top-tier manual, the treasure I'm offering isn't the manual itself."  

"Not the manual?" Lin Xuan frowned. "Then why present it?"  

"Please examine it more closely."  

Seeing Lei Ao's earnest expression—and knowing he wouldn't dare trick him—Lin Xuan lowered his head for a meticulous inspection.  

It was indeed peculiar. Most sects preserved their techniques in jade slips for ease of reading and longevity.  

Books? Those belonged to the mortal world.  

Holding the *Heavenly Thunder Technique*, Lin Xuan slowly flipped through its pages. Gradually, his expression grew solemn...
