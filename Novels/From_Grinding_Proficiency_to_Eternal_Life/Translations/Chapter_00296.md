# Chapter 296: The Viscera Refining Dao Son

The disciple was taken aback and said urgently, "But if no one else goes up to the stage, wouldn't that let this brat from the Tiangong Cave look down on the other peaks of our Dao Sect?"

The key point wasn't about whether they could win or not, but rather that everyone felt it was unfair. Why was Xu Yunfan chosen by Sect Master Bi Yuan to soar to the heavens? He even obtained the position of second-rank true disciple. The resources he consumed for cultivation over the past month were even more than those used by Chu Cangming.

Lu Wuchen's lips curled slightly, his tone indifferent. "He's merely at the Marrow Cleansing Realm. Even if he has some brute strength, it's still just brute strength. I'll make my move only after he wins eighteen consecutive battles. That way, it won't be considered bullying the young with my seniority."

Hearing this, the surrounding disciples suddenly understood, secretly sighing that Lu Wuchen was indeed hiding his capabilities. As expected of the outstanding youth of the Green Nether Peak, he could make such a shameless statement sound so reasonable. After winning eighteen consecutive battles, even if the opponent wasn't exhausted, his combat strength would have diminished significantly. By then, stepping onto the stage, he could naturally win easily. Even if the opponent possessed a divine weapon, what of it? Would he still have the strength to wield it?

Just as the Dao Sons of the various peaks fell into silence, the cold voice of the Punishment Hall Head, Cui Yu, rang out. His voice sounded like cold iron striking, shaking the snow off the pine branches around the arena.

"If no one ascends the stage within half an incense stick's time, it will be considered a surrender by all thirty-six peaks!"

Before Cui Yu's words had fully faded, a clear and resonant sword cry suddenly rang out from the northwest corner. It was like cold spring water cracking through ice, the resonant sound shaking the snow off the pine branches around the arena.

The chief true disciple of the Flowing Cloud Peak, Bai Zhi, who also held the title of Dao Son, descended from the air. The ice steps beneath her feet shattered one by one. Though the Frost Condensing Sword at her waist remained sheathed, its chilling sword intent had already swept through a thirty-foot radius. A layer of crystalline frost instantly formed on the ground, and the air itself seemed to freeze.

"Flowing Cloud Peak's Bai Zhi, requests guidance from Junior Brother Xu."

Her voice was cold and clear, like snow falling on a cold pond, devoid of any worldly aura.

The crowd below immediately erupted. This was the God of Slaughter who, three years ago, used the "Sky Net Dark冥 Sword Art" to freeze the meridians of a wild blade from the Northern Desert in a single strike. She was a mid-stage Grandmaster of Viscera Refining!

Some observant disciples noticed even more: a faint ice crystal pattern between her eyebrows was the sign that she had cultivated the "Dark冥 Jade Manual" to the Ice Soul Flawless realm.

"It's actually Frost Sword Bai Zhi!"
"She used the Sky Net Dark冥 Sword Art to shatter a Northern Desert bladesman's meridians three years ago..."
"This time, Xu Yunfan's Pure Yang True Qi has met its nemesis..."

Whispers spread from the spectator stands, and the looks cast towards Xu Yunfan began to change.

A Viscera Refining Dao Son, the designated successor of a peak, a genius among geniuses. As soon as she stepped onto the stage, how much longer could he, at the Marrow Cleansing Realm, hold on?

Bai Zhi's white robes were as pure as snow. The moment her slender five fingers rested on the hilt of the Frost Condensing Sword, her seemingly delicate forearm suddenly tensed. Her muscles twisted like tempered steel wires. Her sleeves moved without wind, and fine ice crystals actually fell from them.

These ice crystals were not formed naturally, but a phenomenon caused by the Dark冥 Qi surging from within her body, freezing the moisture in the air. Each ice crystal had sharp edges and corners, refracting a seven-colored cold light under the sun.

A variant attribute Qi!

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered. Qi is a derivative of blood energy solidifying to a certain extent, belonging to the concentrated manifestation of blood energy without any special attributes. It can be released externally, used for defense, and allows one's force to break through physical limitations in an instant, reaching an incredible level.

Why is Viscera Refining considered the final realm before the derivation of True Qi?

Viscera Refining has five steps, corresponding to the Five Elements. It focuses on tempering the internal organs, accumulating the Five Qi within the chest. Using the principles of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, the immensely powerful Qi finally undergoes a qualitative transformation and sublimation, giving birth to a wisp of True Qi.

Heart Fire, Liver Wood, Spleen Earth, Lung Metal, Kidney Water. Only by tempering the corresponding internal organs to the extreme can one attach attributes to their Qi.

And the ability to attach attributes to Qi, as seen in Bai Zhi's frost-like sword Qi, means that at least the Water element among the Five Elements of the internal organs—her Kidney Water—has been cultivated to a profound level, supplemented by special precious medicines.

Moreover, the Frost Condensing Sword in her hand was undoubtedly a divine weapon.

The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Halberd seemed to sense the hostility, its dark red patterns suddenly lighting up, and the temperature of the halberd body rose sharply.

Vast blood energy surged through his flesh and blood like molten rock. White, scorching vapor billowed from Xu Yunfan's pores, making him look like a forging furnace heated to a glowing red. The Pure Yang True Qi intertwined with his tempered muscle and bone strength, producing a thunderous rumble as his muscles bulged.

Meanwhile, Bai Zhi's Frost Condensing Sword remained unsheathed, but its chilling sword Qi had already transformed into a tangible cold wave that swept across the ground. Two completely opposite auras split the snowy ground into a clearly defined battlefield.

To the left, within a three-foot radius, ice crystals grew wildly, and frost blades sprouted like thorns.
To the right, the accumulated snow hissed as it vaporized, and within the rising white mist, the heat waves of a red python were faintly visible.

The two were ten yards apart, yet the snow on the ground strangely formed a pattern resembling a Tai Chi symbol, with ice crystals spreading on the left and snow water vaporizing on the right.

The moment Cui Yu struck the bronze chime, Bai Zhi's expression remained cold and detached. Her shoulder gave a slight lift.

*Clang!*

The sword was drawn like a dragon's cry, its tip leaving seven afterimages in the air.

So fast!

Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted, but though he was surprised, he was not thrown into chaos. Instead of retreating, he advanced. The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Halberd in his hand dragged a trail of flowing fire through the air.

*Ding!*

The collision of halberd and sword produced a sound of metal striking metal.

Xu Yunfan's虎口 (tiger's mouth - the base of the thumb and forefinger) trembled violently. The next instant, his toes pressed into the ground, borrowing force to stabilize himself, barely holding his ground against the force that surged up his arm from the sword strike.

He suddenly realized that the opponent's sword Qi attacked in three waves. The first was like a cold wave hitting his face, the second like an ice cone piercing his bones, and the third was actually a scorching internal force.

"Dark冥 Water gives birth to Fire..."

Bi Yuan was somewhat surprised and turned his head to look at the Flowing Cloud Peak's Head, Daoist Zi Jing.

"Junior Brother, you've taken in a good disciple. To be able to cultivate the Dark冥 Jade Manual to such a degree, given time, she may well be able to achieve the Dark冥 True Qi and allow the Flowing Cloud Peak to produce a Ninth Realm True Person."

Hearing Bi Yuan's unreserved praise, a smile couldn't help but appear on the Flowing Cloud Peak Head's face.

"Sect Master, you overpraise her. The Flowing Cloud Peak has not produced a Ninth Realm practitioner in a hundred years. For Bai Zhi to appear now is also a testament to the accumulated merit of the previous generations."

Bi Yuan chuckled and fell silent.

The Ninth Realm, where Qi transforms from force, is the true path of borrowing the false to cultivate the true. It is not so easily broken through.

The Dao Sect has a profound foundation. Counting the unemerged Supreme Elders, the total number of experts at this level does not exceed ten.

At this moment, an elder below the stage exclaimed, "Ice and Fire flowing together? This girl has touched the threshold of Viscera Refining perfection!"

"She's still a bit short..."

At this time, Xu Yunfan, who had been at a disadvantage in the direct clash, tapped his toes and his figure shot backward violently.

The sleeve on his right arm exploded, revealing the Dragon Scale Armor. The armor scales were constantly flaring along with the pulsing of the blue blood vessels bulging from his sinewy muscles. His blood energy and Qi had now been pushed to the extreme.

Bai Zhi pressed her advantage without mercy, her sword technique suddenly changing to the "Thirteen Forms of Snow-slide." Each strike carried the force of a thousand-jun snowslide.

Xu Yunfan was forced to counter with the "Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique." As he swung the heavy halberd, the ground within a three-yard radius sank by three inches.

The two figures crashed together on the擂台 (leitai - fighting platform), the sound of metal clashing shaking the snow off the surrounding pine branches.

The Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Halberd in Xu Yunfan's hand was enveloped in Pure Yang True Qi and the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength. Each swing was like a torrent of molten rock, scorching black trenches into the snow on the ground.
