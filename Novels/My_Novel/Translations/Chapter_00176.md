Chapter 176: The Feast of Prodigies and the Infamous Lieutenant

Li Xian feigned composure and bent down to inspect Qiuyue's corpse. The Xuefenghou poison was swift and potent; it had already reached her heart, causing instant death. Yet, there were no external signs of injury.

Li Xian knew that if he slipped up and Lady Wen sensed something, she would deem him disloyal. After a long moment, he said, "There are no wounds on her body. Could it be suicide?"

"Qiuyue had no reason to enter the deep mountains and forests. She must have betrayed Lady Wen and fled the manor while Lady Wen was indisposed. But she made it this far before suddenly regretting it. Fearing Lady Wen's punishment too much, she ultimately chose to end her life here."

"Suicide?" Lady Wen smiled. "Then tell me, if she committed suicide, who buried her?"

"This..." Li Xian was at a loss for words. Lady Wen was not easily deceived.

Lady Wen gathered wind in her palm and gave a gentle push. The gust lifted Qiuyue's sleeves and skirt, revealing rope marks. She said, "Although Qiuyue has no external injuries, there are rope marks on her hands and feet. She was captured while alive. This method of binding—forcing someone to lie face down with their hands and feet bent backward, rendering them immobile—is a signature of the Flower Cage Sect."

She was well-versed and had seen many of the world's methods, spotting the clue at a glance. Fortunately, Li Xian had acted out of pity and used poison, leaving very few traces.

"She doesn't look like someone who took poison to avoid humiliation," Lady Wen frowned and said.

Li Xian said, "Lady Wen, I suspect her death is related to the Flower Cage Sect. However, I killed all the villains from the Flower Cage Sect at the time. In this wilderness, it would be difficult to find anyone else."

Lady Wen nodded. She had pursued Qiuyue to punish her severely. First, to vent her anger; second, to intimidate Li Xian, showing him with action that if he betrayed her, she could find him anywhere in the world.

Third... the secret of the Silkworm Clothes Jade-Crushing Art could not be leaked. She had many enemies. If they all knew this weakness, how could she live peacefully in the future?

"Lady Wen, could it be that the Flower Cage Sect silenced her?" Li Xian asked cautiously.

"Most likely," Lady Wen said. Even though she was formidable, she couldn't deduce the exact situation that day. Plus, there were indeed rope marks from the Flower Cage Sect on Qiuyue's body, and no external injuries...

It was likely that Qiuyue was bound to the ground, and the Flower Cage Sect fed her a lethal poison, causing her death before moving her to a distance to bury her. Only this explanation was barely plausible.

"The Flower Cage Sect does not kill women, but with so many disciples, it is hard to control them all," Lady Wen turned and asked, "Why did you annihilate the Flower Cage Sect back then?"

Li Xian immediately told her about Lin Aoshan. Upon hearing the name, Lady Wen felt slightly displeased. But when she heard that Li Xian had taken the risk to work with Lin Aoshan because of the three thousand taels of fines, her displeasure faded.

"Since that is the case, this matter is settled. There is no need to investigate further," Lady Wen turned and left. Li Xian hesitated for a moment, then followed.

Leaving Qiuyue's corpse to lie exposed in the wild was truly pitiful. The master-servant relationship of over a decade was as light as a goose feather.

Back at the manor.

Lady Wen's knot in her heart was gone, and she was in a very good mood. She practiced swordplay with Li Xian, combining their techniques to improve their skills.

That afternoon.

Ding Hu took office as the guard captain. Li Xian moved into the inner courtyard, becoming the Sword-bearing Youth, living beside Lady Wen, with only a few steps between his room and hers.

Lady Wen issued an order to start the cauldron again. It took two days to finish cooking the refined food. Li Xian received two portions of refined meat. He ate one on the spot and put the other into the Sky-Containing Box.

This portion of refined meat nourished over a hundred strands of essence. After being strengthened by consumption, it turned into one hundred and fifty strands. Li Xian kept over thirty strands for himself... enough to digest for half a month.

The next day.

The Lieutenant's Hall.

Li Xian's roar was like thunder. His entire body flashed with a dark luster, like iron coated in silver, indestructible.

[Food Essence]
[Proficiency: 32/100]

[Iron Copper Body]
[Proficiency: 1253/50000 (Peak Mastery!)]

[Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword · Second Layer]
[Proficiency: 569/5000 (Small Completion)]

[Vital Thunder Finger]
[Proficiency: 11/1200 (Proficient)]

Many martial arts had improved. His Qi Lake was twenty-five zhang wide, surging and turbulent, with a hint of wave-like momentum.

The Iron Copper Body was practiced to its limit, reaching peak mastery. It forged his body to be solid and firm, with iron-like lungs. Li Xian's breathing was like a flood, which surprisingly complemented the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound."

This made the Chest Drum Thunder Sound resonate even stronger. Consequently, the killing power of the Vital Thunder Finger increased.

The path of martial arts is vast. Martial arts are also vast. There are thousands of strange and varied martial arts in the world. Some martial arts share the same principles, complementing each other. Their effects stack, allowing one to unleash terrifying power.

This is especially common in major sects of the martial world. Even if martial artists from other schools steal a move or two, they cannot grasp the essence.

The Iron Copper Body and Vital Thunder Finger are both martial arts from miscellaneous schools.

But by a twist of fate, their principles are connected.

The Iron Copper Body trains the lungs. The lungs are located in the chest. When the chest drum sounds like thunder, the lungs vibrate, strengthening the thunder sound. This sound is transmitted through the body to execute the killing move of the Vital Thunder Finger...

A series of principles are interlinked, naturally resulting in formidable power.

"Lieutenant."

Outside the hall, the attendants were fully dressed and holding blades.

Li Xian smiled and said, "No need to be nervous. Perhaps the new County Magistrate has no intention of opposing us?"

Cao Kai had been dead for over ten days. The situation in the Prefecture City was unpredictable, with many aristocratic families engaging in covert struggles. Li Xian couldn't know the specifics.

But the new County Magistrate had been chosen. He was a young member of the Yuwen family from the Prefecture City, barely over twenty years old.

He set out several days ago. Based on the travel time, he should arrive today. The attendants had been through several changes and had ample combat experience. Hearing that the County Magistrate was arriving, they were all on guard, waiting for Li Xian's command to strike first and act on Heaven's behalf to punish the official without hesitation.

"Since it's a newcomer, there should be a new atmosphere. You all should restrain your hostility and go practice in the outer courtyard. I will go greet the County Magistrate," Li Xian said casually.

The attendants looked at each other. Zhang Hou said, "Everyone, go practice." He set an example and led the attendants to follow the order and practice.

At the city gate, ten paces away, there was a wooden shed.

Li Xian sat in the shade of the shed, waiting for the County Magistrate, showing full respect. It would be best to get along with others. After waiting for a moment, unsure of when he would arrive, he brought a small chair and started cracking melon seeds.

The sun was bright today, the sky was clear, and there were no clouds.

Before Li Xian arrived, not even County Lieutenant Zhang Yiheng, the chief clerk, or the aristocratic families dared to show their faces.

But after Li Xian came, the County Lieutenant hurried over, his clothes and hat somewhat disheveled. The other county officials were more or less the same.

After waiting for half an incense stick's time.

The sound of hooves was heard as a carriage approached. The carriage had a round top and a square body, a style from the Prefecture City. But the color was plain, obviously intending to be low-key.

The carriage stopped, and a young man got out. He had a handsome appearance and was very young. He was the new County Magistrate: Yuwen Chengji. He was an unappreciated member of the Yuwen family.

Several people had died in Qingning County. After a multi-factional struggle, the position of County Magistrate fell into the hands of the Yuwen family.

However, this place was dangerous. After much consideration, the family temporarily sent a branch member, Yuwen Chengji, to test the waters.

Yuwen Chengji was complaining endlessly. He had been uneasy since setting out on his appointment. Now, the Prefecture City was full of rumors that the Qingning Lieutenant Li Xian had three heads and six arms, a bloody basin for a mouth, a fierce aura reaching the sky, eyes like copper bells. He was demonized as a man-eating monster.

Yuwen Chengji came to take office with only three old servants, no family soldiers, no government troops. He was alone, miserable, almost attending the post single-handedly.

When he got off the carriage, his legs were weak. If the Lieutenant killed him, how could he survive?

Just as he was wandering aimlessly, his heart filled with despair.

Li Xian strode over and said with a smile, "You must be the young master of the Yuwen family, the new County Magistrate, right?"

"Yes... yes..." Yuwen Chengji heeded his family's teachings. Upon arriving in Qingning, he was not to flaunt his family status. He quickly returned the salute and asked, "And... who are you?"

"I am the Lieutenant, Li Xian," Li Xian said.

"Ah!" Yuwen Chengji exclaimed. "You... you are Li Xian?!"

It was truly unexpected. This Lieutenant was not fierce-looking but exceptionally handsome. A red mole between his eyebrows added to his noble and heroic bearing, a rare sight.

"You... you..." Yuwen Chengji said. "You shouldn't be terrifying-looking, with three heads and six arms, killing without blinking, with a pockmarked face and a mouth so big it can swallow people!"

"Insolence!" Zhang Yiheng roared. "You ignorant child, how dare you insult Lieutenant Li?!" He made a move to draw his sword.

Yuwen Chengji shrank his neck. He was young and came from a wealthy background, so he was not well-versed in the ways of the world. The words had left his mouth before he realized he had offended someone.

He also felt that as a County Magistrate, he was truly pathetic, to be scolded as "insolent" by a County Lieutenant.

Li Xian smiled. "It's fine. I can see this young brother didn't mean to offend. He is simply pure-hearted and speaks his mind. There's no need to make a big deal out of it."

"Yes, yes," Zhang Yiheng stepped back.

"County Magistrate, please. As you have just arrived in Qingning, you must be unfamiliar with this place. I am a native of Qingning and can tell you about the local customs and practices," Li Xian said amicably.

As they walked to the middle of the street, the flow of pedestrians and the lively atmosphere gradually dissipated the fear. Although Yuwen Chengji was a spoiled young master, he was not foolish. He realized the rumors were greatly exaggerated. This Lieutenant... was actually quite easy to get along with.

Li Xian asked, "Young Master Yuwen, I have never been to the Prefecture City. I wonder how bustling it is. Could you tell me about it?"

"The Prefecture City..." Yuwen Chengji said. "It is truly... indescribable. Seven rivers converge in one city, with waterways extending outward. Hundred-zhang tall buildings are everywhere, and all trades and professions are thriving."

"There are also countless capable and strange people, martial arts schools and sects, beautiful women, rare treasures, and prodigies gathering. It is exciting and bustling."

He spoke with genuine feeling, his tone impassioned.

"A grand scene like that, I truly wish I could see it," Li Xian sighed.

"Oh?" Yuwen Chengji said. "If you want to go, in just over a month, it will be the best time."

"Why?" Li Xian asked.

"That is when the Feast of Prodigies' Layered Pavilion is held. It is jointly organized by the aristocratic families. The excitement is a rare sight to behold for several years. You can also witness the风采 of the prodigies."

"It is said... that at this feast, there will be Treasured Tools appearing!"

"But to attend the feast, you need an invitation. Without one, you have no chance."

Yuwen Chengji said with a look of longing.

Li Xian asked, "The Feast of Prodigies' Layered Pavilion?" Although he was curious, he didn't dwell on it. He then asked, "Right, you just said I have three heads and six arms, terrifying, ugly to the extreme. Is that how they talk about me in the Prefecture City?"

"Uh..." Yuwen Chengji looked embarrassed. "I am truly sorry, I spoke without thinking. I hope the Lieutenant will not blame me. I only believed the rumors and had no intention of offending the Lieutenant."

"I understand," Li Xian said curiously. "Tell me honestly, what is my reputation in the Prefecture City now?"

Yuwen Chengji told the truth. "Since the Lieutenant wants to hear it, I will speak. But these are all rumors, I am merely repeating them."

"The Prefecture City says... you are ugly and unreasonable. You dominate Qingning County, squeezing the fat and grease from the people, causing the common folk to live in misery."

"They also say you have a foul body odor that frightens people. You shelter criminals and have a long list of wicked deeds. The people of the Prefecture City all call you the 'Evil Lieutenant,' seeing you as a great scourge."

"The Cao family prodigy, Cao Xiu Xiu, declared... that you are merely a bully who relies on his master's power to cause harm. The courtesan of the Immortal Pavilion, Ji Yan Hong, said that whoever defeats you to vent her anger, she will personally play a song for them."

"The little princess of the Chu family, at a Chu family banquet, also discussed this topic. At the time, the little princess said with disgust: 'Don't talk about this person anymore. Just hearing his name is unbearable. If anyone talks about him again, get out immediately.' Something along those lines."

Li Xian asked, "Why are they all evaluations from women?"

"Ah?" Yuwen Chengji said shyly. "I only pay attention to women, and only the beautiful ones."
