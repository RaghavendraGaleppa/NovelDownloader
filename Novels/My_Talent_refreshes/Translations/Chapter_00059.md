# Chapter 59: Divine Sense Talisman Crafting  

"My first attempt at talisman crafting actually yielded over a forty percent success rate."  

Chu Ning stared at the small stack of talisman papers before him, his face a mix of astonishment and delight.  

In just one hour, he had attempted to craft forty talismans, and a staggering eighteen of them had succeeded.  

Having studied talisman crafting extensively during this period, he knew that a forty percent success rate was already considered competent for standard talismans.  

A fifty percent success rate would mark an exceptionally skilled talisman master.  

"The Spiritual Source Constitution talent is truly formidable!"  

Chu Ning couldn't help but marvel.  

Moreover, he could clearly sense that his success rate was still improving with each attempt. His later attempts had noticeably higher success rates than his earlier ones.  

If not for his depleted divine sense, he would have continued without hesitation.  

"The real challenge in talisman crafting isn’t the consumption of spiritual power—it’s the divine sense."  

This realization struck Chu Ning as he reflected.  

Initially, he hadn’t noticed it. But ever since practicing the Divine Refinement Technique, his sensitivity to divine sense had sharpened.  

After about five attempts at crafting, he had begun to perceive the subtle shifts in his divine sense.  

Yet, upon further thought, it made sense.  

The spiritual power consumed by the spirit brush was minimal.  

But maintaining such intense focus undoubtedly drained one’s divine sense.  

For most Qi Refinement disciples, lacking specialized techniques to cultivate divine sense, they couldn’t even clearly perceive these fluctuations.  

At this thought, a sudden inspiration flashed through Chu Ning’s mind.  

Earlier, he hadn’t paid attention—his divine sense had been unconsciously depleted.  

But what if he employed the divine sense control method from the Divine Refinement Technique, concentrating it solely on the crafting process?  

Would that reduce the consumption of his divine sense?  

The more he pondered, the more convinced he became that this approach was worth testing.  

However, feeling the exhaustion in his mind, he had no choice but to shelve the idea for now.  

Chu Ning resumed practicing the Divine Refinement Technique to restore his divine sense.  

This time, the recovery was still slow, but to his surprise, despite taking longer, the results were excellent.  

The proficiency of his Divine Refinement Technique had also increased by one point.  

"Does depleting divine sense and then restoring it through the technique actually strengthen it?"  

This faint possibility filled him with quiet excitement.  

It meant there was now a way to accelerate his cultivation of the Divine Refinement Technique.  

Whether this was truly the case would require further verification.  

By now, it was already noon.  

Following his usual routine, he cooked and ate a meal of spirit rice before resting briefly.  

Then, refreshed, he returned to the table in his room to continue practicing talisman crafting.  

His energy was at its peak, and his divine sense had fully recovered.  

Recalling his earlier idea about divine sense-controlled talisman crafting, he gripped the spirit brush and focused his divine sense deliberately on the talisman paper and brush.  

As the brush touched the paper, an indescribably profound sensation surged through him.  

It was as if every fiber of the paper and every drop of ink were under his complete control.  

Without the slightest hesitation, Chu Ning completed a Wood Escape Talisman in a single, fluid motion.  

He didn’t stop there, immediately moving on to the next talisman.  

Five, ten, twenty…  

Sixty!  

This time, he used a full sixty talisman papers before feeling the strain on his divine sense.  

Though fatigue showed on his face, his smile only widened.  

"My method truly works.  

By controlling the scope of my divine sense, I reduced its consumption by a full third!"  

When he tallied the successful talismans, his jaw nearly dropped.  

Thirty-two!  

Out of sixty attempts, he had crafted thirty-two Wood Escape Talismans—a success rate exceeding fifty percent!  

Moreover, he could distinctly sense that the quality of these thirty-two talismans surpassed that of the eighteen from the morning.  

This wasn’t just crafting talismans—it was practically printing them!  

A surge of excitement coursed through him.  

Each talisman was worth two low-grade spirit stones.  

In just one day, his creations could fetch nearly a hundred spirit stones.  

The minor costs of paper and ink were negligible in comparison.  

For a moment, Chu Ning felt an almost surreal disbelief.  

Was talisman crafting really supposed to be this difficult?  

Could Mu Ling’s high failure rate have been intentional?  

---  

Meanwhile, in the outer sect, Mu Ling stared in frustration at the ashes of yet another failed talisman.  

"Achoo!"  

After sneezing, she muttered in confusion, "Who’s talking about me?"  

Shaking her head, she picked up her clearly high-quality spirit brush again, biting her lip lightly.  

"I refuse to believe that after practicing so diligently, my success rate still can’t reach forty percent. Again!"  

---  

Over the following days, Chu Ning remained secluded in his room, alternating between cultivation and talisman crafting.  

Of course, he understood the importance of balance.  

He didn’t neglect the Evergreen Wood Technique or the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art.  

To avoid arousing suspicion from his neighbors, he practiced the Evergreen Wood Technique and Divine Refinement Technique in the courtyard—both of which required only seated meditation.  

For the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, he trained in the spirit fields.  

The only puzzling aspect was the fluctuating speed of his Divine Refinement Technique progress.  

Sometimes it accelerated after divine sense depletion, while other times it reverted to its original sluggish pace—or even became faster than before.  

After much contemplation yielded no answers, Chu Ning decided not to dwell on it.  

After all, over these past few days, through continuous application and cultivation of his divine sense, his Divine Refinement Technique had progressed significantly faster overall.  

Five days had brought an increase of eight proficiency points.  

But it wasn’t just his Divine Refinement Technique that had improved—his talisman crafting success rate had also soared.  

"Seventy percent!  

If outsiders knew about this success rate, they’d be stunned speechless."  

Chu Ning mused to himself as he left his courtyard.  

Though his progress had slowed compared to the first day, his success rate still inched upward daily.  

After five days, despite having never crafted Wood Escape Talismans before, he now maintained a stable seventy percent success rate.  

Given how absurdly high this was, he decided not to go all out during the upcoming talisman assessment.  

Of course, he wouldn’t deliberately underperform either.  

As a pseudo-spiritual root cultivator, excelling in wood-attribute techniques and talisman crafting wasn’t entirely unreasonable, was it?  

And controlling his success rate?  

For the current Chu Ning, it was child’s play.
