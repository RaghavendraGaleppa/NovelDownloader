# Chapter 122: Ice Cube One-Shots the Hidden Dragon, Li Da Shanren’s Unshakable Reputation

Everyone in the hall murmured as they looked at Bai Jinghong standing in the center.

Those below the Divine Observation Realm knew their limits and wouldn't step up just to embarrass themselves. Meanwhile, the talented young cultivators with some skill were unwilling to be the first to test the waters, hoping someone else would go up and gauge Bai Jinghong's depth.

The atmosphere was heavy, filled with whispering and mutual shirking of responsibility.

"Is there truly no genius in the Eastern Wilderness Domain willing to spar with me?"

"Then the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm belongs to my Hengyun Sword City."

Bai Jinghong stood with his hands behind his back, speaking casually.

"That's too domineering! This secret realm originally belonged to no one."

"Why should we follow your rules?"

The hall erupted in noise, filled with complaints.

Bai Jinghong scanned the crowd, a smirk playing on his lips.

"The nine heavens and ten earths are ruled by the strong."

"So, my rules are the rules. Do you understand?"

His words echoed, silencing the agitated crowd.

The room went quiet.

Except for...

"Let's eat the watermelon first. Don't eat it all; save a bit to make ice cream."

"Watermelon flavored?"

"Yeah, shaped like Patrick Star. Let me kill this melon first."

Li Mo took out the watermelon he had just picked from the field and drew his Chixiao Sword. He aimed it back and forth before stabbing it into the fruit.

He sensed a gaze and looked over to see Luo Yu and Luo Yao. The brother looked speechless, while the sister couldn't take her eyes off the watermelon.

"Want some?"

Li Mo was quite the enthusiastic host.

Everyone: "?"

Bai Jinghong: "?"

*I'm testing the heroes of the realm with my sword, and you're over there cutting watermelon?*

*Do I have no face?*

He was just about to speak.

"Your sword may be sharp, but my Gangdou Sect's halberd is no less so!"

"I'll give it a try!"

Tie Qi slammed the table and stood up. He grabbed a long halberd, its cold light gleaming.

"Perfect timing!"

Bai Jinghong had no choice but to retract his gaze.

The two exchanged blows, their Divine Intentions clashing, and they finally engaged.

On the first sword strike, Tie Qi stumbled back, his divine strength unable to match the sword's edge. On the second, a wave-like sword swept his lower legs, yet he didn't dodge or avoid...

His upper body suddenly separated from his lower half, raising the halberd to smash down, forcing Bai Jinghong to defend.

Bai Jinghong clearly didn't expect that the opponent, who was already half-disabled, would have such a "separate actions" move.

He was about to press the attack when Tie Qi laughed.

"Three moves are up."

Bai Jinghong: "....."

He darkly sheathed his sword.

Although Tie Qi had taken three strikes, everyone present was shocked. Even the mighty Tie Qi, in their eyes, had been forced to resort to tricks.

The genius of the Hidden Dragon Ranking was simply too strong.

"Hiss..."

Everyone gasped.

"Hiss..."

Li Mo took a bite of watermelon, so delicious he also gasped.

He then offered the watermelon to Ying Bing and the Luo siblings.

True onlookers.

"You..."

Bai Jinghong narrowed his eyes, about to speak.

"I'll also test your skills!"

Luo Yu took a bite of watermelon and stepped forward.

This was the estate of Fen Yulin. As the host, was he just going to let someone show off without asking him?

He flicked his sword, gathering the light of the blade, and recited,

"The torrent flows three thousand feet down,疑是銀河落九天 (suspected to be the Milky Way falling from the ninth heaven)!"

As the words landed, a sword light resembling a long river swept forth.

This was Fen Yulin's ultimate technique, the Poem Sword Art. It used scholarly spirit to amplify power; every poem was a different sword technique.

"Hmph, flashy and superficial."

Bai Jinghong snorted coldly.

Although the opponent had just entered the Divine Observation Realm, he stopped underestimating him, his sword moving like a startled swan passing through a gap.

In an instant, he completely shattered the poetic atmosphere.

He raised his hand to knock Luo Yu's sword away.

"Nice!"

"Awesome, Brother Luo."

The onlooker, Li Mo, clapped enthusiastically.

He wasn't sure how strong this technique was, but its coolness factor was maxed out. The disciples of Fen Yulin were all experts at showing off in public.

He wanted to learn it.

The opportunity was fleeting.

In that brief moment, the poetic atmosphere was somehow restored by Luo Yu.

The result was...

Luo Yu, who should have only been able to take two moves, actually managed to take three.

"Your three moves... not bad."

"But... you still need practice."

Luo Yu was sweating profusely but looked proud.

He raised a hand to retrieve his knocked-down sword and walked back to eat watermelon, leaving without a trace.

"Congratulations, Brother Luo, for successfully taking three moves."

Li Mo smiled and praised him.

The disciples of Fen Yulin also cheered and flattered him.

The martial artists present disliked Bai Jinghong's arrogance; comparatively, Luo Yu was much better. Moreover, he was the host, so praising him was the right thing to do.

They all cheered and praised Luo Yu.

The benefit of home-field advantage was evident here.

"?"

Bai Jinghong's face twitched, turning red.

*Wait, you almost failed to take three moves, why are you looking so proud?*

*I明明 won, so why do I feel worse than if I had lost?*

"Hmph!"

A cold snort, a无形 and sharp sword intent swept through the hall.

Although he hadn't broken through to the Internal Scene Realm yet, he could already project sword qi, making him look like a sharp sword itself.

This was derived from observing the divine swords of his sect; everyone present felt as if a blade hung over their heads.

"You! Take three moves from me!"

He pointed directly at Li Mo's table.

But at that moment.

Ying Bing had just finished a slice of watermelon and raised her beautiful head.

The girl's delicate brows furrowed slightly.

"Me?"

Everyone looked at each other in confusion.

A Divine Observation Realm expert calling out a Internal Qi Realm cultivator?

This was simply too bullying.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes for a few seconds, her jade finger dipping into the teacup again.

"I meant..."

Bai Jinghong was about to say something.

But before he could finish, a water droplet suddenly flew toward him.

It was a beauty that many would never see in their lives.

Although it was just a drop of water, it carried an overbearing and unmatched sword qi. Under the support of two layers of Internal Qi, it reached him in an instant.

Bai Jinghong was terrified. He surged his sword qi throughout his body, like a rushing river.

In terms of quantity, the two were like a river versus a water droplet.

But that single droplet pierced through the river with unstoppable force, extinguishing it completely.

*Slap—*

The water droplet hit the sword tip.

Instead, the long sword flew backward, nailing itself into a pillar.

The hall was truly silent now.

Those who saw that sword strike felt like they were dreaming. Such a sword strike didn't seem to exist in reality.

And Ying Bing hadn't even drawn her sword; she used a mere drop of tea water to defeat the Hidden Dragon Ranking genius.

Bai Jinghong stood frozen, forgetting even to pick up his sword.

He was questioning his life.

The old man behind him, however, had a fierce light in his eyes.

"If you hadn't used sword qi, you would have lost a bit slower."

Ying Bing spoke indifferently.

Many people in the hall didn't understand the meaning of that sentence.

"Cough, indeed."

Li Mo nodded, coughing lightly.

If Bai Jinghong had used his realm and techniques properly, he wouldn't have been defeated in a single move.

Sword qi is born from intent and spirit.

Brother, what did you have to compare with the future Empress of the Phoenix? Intent and spirit?

That's like Old Xuan taking a divine pill and then going to the latrine—utterly pointless.

Speaking of which, Ice Cube probably didn't mean to show off in public, but when she said that line, why did it feel like a酥麻 (numbing sensation) shooting straight to the top of my head?

It's just the right flavor.

"The next Hidden Dragon Ranking is going to change dramatically."

"Tsk tsk, has there ever been such a monster in the Eastern Wilderness Domain at sixteen years old?"

"She's probably not just making the list. Bai Jinghong is ranked eighty-ninth, and she defeated him in one move. She's at least in the top fifty."

"If Bai Jinghong hadn't used sword qi, he might not have lost so badly, but even with all his tricks, he couldn't have matched her."

"If the opportunity in this Blood Phoenix Secret Realm falls to her again..."

After a moment of silence, the crowd instantly boiled over.

The geniuses on the Hidden Dragon Ranking could fight across realms, yet today they were defeated across realms.

Just how fierce is the girl before them?

At sixteen years old, not to mention the Eastern Wilderness Domain, even in the Central Divine Continent, such a thing is unheard of.

Bai Jinghong had just declared that the geniuses of the Eastern Wilderness Domain didn't dare to fight him, that the strong rule the nine heavens and ten earths, and he was defeated so惨 (miserably).

The so-called rules of Hengyun Sword City were naturally treated like a fart and dispersed by everyone.

Many wanted to go up and greet Ying Bing.

But her aura, as clear and cold as the moon, was too overbearing, and for a moment, no one dared to approach.

"The少年 beside her is..."

"Li Mo, he is also a Master of a Mystic Weapon, and together with Ying Bing, they are known as the Twin Prodigies of the Clear Abyss Sect."

"This... Can the Clear Abyss Sect really produce two sword prodigies of this level?"

"I know, he's Li Da Shanren (Li the Great Philanthropist). The largest charity in Ziyang Prefecture is run by him. I heard he's a really good person."

"I know too. I heard this True Disciple Li is naturally easy-going and even treated outer disciples to drinks at the Fanghua Tower."

"Damn, this guy is awesome."

Surprisingly, many people knew our Li Da Shanren.

There was no helping it; the number of people receiving Li Mo's aid was increasing, spreading by word of mouth.

This caused Little Li's reputation to be exceptionally solid.

"It seems he's on par with Ying Bing because of his good character."

"What are they doing?"

"Drawing on the table with tea water. Are they communicating sword techniques this way?"

...

"Patrick Star is drawn like this."

Li Mo looked at the starfish on the table and drew a square with holes in it.

"This is SpongeBob."

"....."

Ying Bing looked at the boy's serious expression and thought he was so childish.

But she still nodded gently.

"Okay, let's do it that way."

After all, she still owed him a favor she hadn't repaid yet.

And she didn't believe she couldn't make a good dish.

*Crash—*

At that moment, a sudden thunderclap sounded outside.

A disciple of Fen Yulin stumbled in.

"Big trouble!"

"Yin Huacheng has been killed!"
