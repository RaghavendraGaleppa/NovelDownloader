# Chapter 77: A Friend Within the Seas

**[Cloud Bronze Heart Mirror]**

Quality: High-grade Magical Artifact  
Description: Forged from third-tier spirit material Cloud Bronze, engraved with five high-grade defensive inscriptions—Resilience, Equilibrium, Iron Curtain, Inner Protection, and Transference. When refined and placed over the heart, it can autonomously defend against attacks.  
Enhancement Cost: 32 points  

Lin Shan studied the enhancement panel's description of the palm-sized ancient bronze mirror and suddenly understood.  

No wonder it looked so weathered and battered—it was a defensive artifact! From Elder Zhang's earlier casual remark, it seemed this was Left Sage's signature artifact from his early years!  

A high-grade defensive artifact with five inscriptions was incredibly resilient, which explained why it remained intact despite all the scratches and scorch marks.  

Now that he had a mid-grade offensive artifact, Lin Shan indeed needed a defensive tool. This Cloud Bronze Heart Mirror had arrived just in time.  

This time, Lin Shan didn't hold back. Left Sage had already promised to reward him if he answered correctly. If he gave a half-hearted response now, the prize might slip away. Even if Left Sage originally intended to give it to him, he might feel obliged to withhold it after making his stance clear earlier.  

"If I'm not mistaken, this is a high-grade defensive artifact. Once refined and placed over the heart, it can autonomously defend against attacks. It has five defensive inscriptions," Lin Shan repeated the enhancement panel's description verbatim.  

"Hahaha, excellent!" Left Sage clapped his hands in delight. Beside him, Elder Zhang stroked his beard approvingly, while Lin Shan waited eagerly below.  

"This was my personal artifact from two hundred years ago during my Foundation Establishment stage. While its magical defense is average, its physical defense is exceptional. I bestow it upon you now—may it protect you on your path of cultivation."  

"The journey of immortality is long, and survival is paramount. Once death comes, the Dao vanishes!" Left Sage sighed with a hint of nostalgia, clearly attached to the artifact.  

But compared to the mystery of the minor divine ability Lin Shan had helped unravel, a mere artifact was insignificant.  

Elder Zhang nodded in agreement. After all, wasn't the pursuit of immortality all about longevity? Staying alive was everything—death rendered all achievements void.  

That was why defensive artifacts and techniques were always the most expensive.  

Especially something like the Cloud Bronze Heart Mirror, which specialized in extreme physical defense.  

Lin Shan bowed deeply. "A gift from an elder cannot be refused. Many thanks, Senior!"  

The three of them enjoyed a harmonious conversation, with Left Sage even offering Lin Shan some cultivation advice, explaining key insights for advancing from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment. Lin Shan was deeply grateful.  

---  

From day to night, Lin Shan gained much from their discussion before Elder Zhang finally escorted him out.  

After all, it was already a great honor for a Golden Core cultivator to receive a Qi Refining junior. An all-night talk was out of the question.  

Once outside, Lin Shan subtly compared Left Sage's aura to that of the enchanting woman from the brothel. He recalled how her wrathful pressure had felt even more overwhelming when she learned of Immortal Huang's death.  

But since Left Sage hadn't actively released his aura, Lin Shan couldn't accurately gauge who was stronger. Still, judging by their usual presence, the woman was at least a Golden Core cultivator!  

This realization made Lin Shan even warier. As a mere Qi Refining cultivator, he should avoid getting too entangled with a demonic-path Golden Core expert like her. Instead, he should focus on currying favor with Left Sage, a rogue Golden Core cultivator.  

Back in the main hall, Elder Zhang produced the contract for the auction house's chief appraiser position and placed it before Lin Shan.  

**[Auction House]**: Yichuan Auction House  
**[Position]**: Chief Appraiser  
**[Monthly Salary]**: 100 Spirit Stones  

Lin Shan's eyes nearly popped out at the sight of the salary.  

A hundred spirit stones a month?!  

He looked up at Elder Zhang, who merely smiled back at him.  

After a long staring contest, Lin Shan finally managed to ask, "What exactly does this job entail?"  

Elder Zhang replied casually, "Do whatever you want. Or nothing at all."  

Lin Shan swallowed hard. "Could you be more specific, Elder Zhang?"  

The old man sat down and glanced meaningfully at his empty teacup.  

Lin Shan immediately took the hint, pouring tea with both hands before moving behind Elder Zhang to demonstrate his family's secret massage techniques—shoulder kneading, leg pounding, and even an exotic eighteen-move routine.  

Elder Zhang moaned in satisfaction as the two engaged in their clandestine activities in the empty auction hall.  

After a while, Lin Shan asked, "How's the technique?"  

Elder Zhang sighed. "Mmm, excellent."  

Lin Shan pressed further, "Would you like to try an oil massage? Ancient SPA techniques? Head pressure therapy?"  

Elder Zhang perked up. "Oh? That sounds intriguing."  

Lin Shan: "..."  

He had only been polite, but the old man was taking him seriously!  

Seeing Elder Zhang still sitting there expectantly, Lin Shan sighed inwardly.  

"Fine! A hundred spirit stones a month—I'll do it!"  

---  

Lin Shan knew that Golden Core cultivators like Left Sage were rarely seen. If he wanted a reliable patron, Elder Zhang—the current chief appraiser—was his best bet.  

Once Elder Zhang left Yichuan, and Lin Shan officially took over the position, true freedom would be his.  

...  

By dawn, Lin Shan was exhausted—his hands cramped, his vision blurry, and his legs unsteady.  

Elder Zhang, however, looked radiant and full of vigor.  

"Not bad, young man. You show promise."  

Seeing Lin Shan thoroughly spent, Elder Zhang decided it was time to explain the job.  

In short, ordinary appraisers handled most auction items. The chief appraiser only stepped in for particularly unusual or obscure artifacts.  

So, chief appraisers like Elder Zhang usually secluded themselves in their caves to cultivate, only emerging occasionally to stretch their legs.  

The only time they were truly on duty was during the three days leading up to the annual auction.  

Lin Shan grew even more excited. No wonder Elder Zhang had advanced to Foundation Establishment so smoothly—this was the perfect cushy job!  

Elder Zhang glanced at Lin Shan and immediately guessed his thoughts.  

Still, he felt compelled to warn him, "As the new chief appraiser, you'll face skepticism from the junior appraisers. You'll need to make regular appearances. When I first took the position, I faced plenty of challenges too."  

Lin Shan eagerly sought advice. "How did you handle their schemes, Elder?"  

Elder Zhang smirked cunningly.  

"Strength is everything! I endured their provocations until I secluded myself to reach Foundation Establishment. After that, none of them dared to even fart in my presence!"  

He gave Lin Shan a knowing look.  

Lin Shan nodded vigorously—Elder Zhang's philosophy aligned perfectly with his own.  

When weak, keep a low profile even if thrust into the spotlight. Secretly grow stronger, then crush all who once looked down on you.  

This was the ironclad law of survival on the immortal path.  

The two exchanged a glance and burst into conspiratorial laughter.  

...  

At dawn, as the auction house opened, several appraisers arriving for work shuddered at the eerie laughter echoing from the hall.  

Some of them seemed to recall unpleasant memories!
