# Chapter 181: Two Lifetimes in Yunzhou, A Trio's Journey

"Wow, is that Li Jianxian's carriage?!"

"I heard you're the reincarnation of a Sword Immortal. Is that true?"

"Did you really carve that sword mark in the Hengyun Sword City?"

When they returned to Yunzhou City, they were met with boiling cheers. Even the wide city gates were blocked solid.

Joy and sorrow are not shared alike. At this moment, Young Master Li only found them noisy.

Li Mo deeply understood what it meant to be like a pig fattened for slaughter once it becomes famous.

"Being a famous swordsman in the eyes of others is so exhausting..."

He had suddenly become famous, and his mental fortitude couldn't quite keep up.

The carriage couldn't move, so Li Mo turned his head to look at the Ice Cube. She was lowering her eyes, quietly drinking tea, as if the outside world couldn't disturb her at all.

"It's almost dark."

"We still wanted to stroll around Yunzhou City."

Li Mo racked his brains. However, before he could come up with a proper solution, Ying Bing suddenly stood up and lifted the carriage curtain.

Her face was expressionless, and her deep, quiet eyes swept over the crowd.

The noisy city gate fell silent instantly.

The oppressive aura of the Ice Cube.

If one were to say who was the most eye-catching at today's martial arts conference, it was naturally Li Mo. But Ying Bing, who was strong to the point of being unreasonable, also left a deep impression. No one could take her three swords, not even the disciples of the Hengyun Sword City. In the end, no one dared to step onto the stage to challenge her.

Her pleasant voice said lightly:

"Move."

"Alright."

The carriage slowly began to move again. Wherever it passed, the crowd automatically parted. Not long after, they passed by the liveliest Yulong Street.

"Rolling Donkey~"

"You love me, I love you, honey water ice cake is sweet~"

"Master, please make way, I'm almost late!"

"Exclusive leaked version of 'The Overbearing Empress Falls in Love with Me,' ten taels of silver, and you can see it first~"

Perhaps because there are many sword cultivators here, even the architectural style has沾染了 the personality of sword cultivators, all unique and elegant. With lanterns and decorations hung up, it looked like a sea of fire and silver flowers under the night sky.

Because of the Martial Arts Summit, Yunzhou City at night was even more bustling than the day, and it was far more prosperous than Ziyang Prefecture.

Whoosh—

The lamplight was hazy, occasionally leaking through the swaying carriage curtains, casting alternating light and shadow inside the compartment.

"It's so lively..."

Jiang Chulong's small body shrank a bit. Staying in the dark place inside the carriage, she carefully looked at the human world's fireworks, as if wanting to memorize every scenery.

Ying Bing took in the prosperous scene, but her heart held a different landscape.

Yunzhou...

In the previous life, in the not-so-distant future, the Southern Frontier would erupt with the most violent beast tide in a thousand years, and the Prince of Zhennan would fall.

The Hengyun Sword City had lost its sword mark for decades and was in a state of decline.

When disaster was imminent, the sword city could have migrated the entire city to join the Tianshan Sword Manor to avoid the calamity. Unfortunately, the then City Lord knew it was impossible but persisted in guarding Yunzhou.

The connections accumulated over the years came into play; they were not alone. Many martial heroes, sects, and aristocratic families stood with them here, sharing the same hatred.

Within three years, the City Lord changed several times: Cao Mu, Bai Jinghong, Wu Chushu.

Before the reinforcements dispatched by the court arrived, Wu Chushu self-destructed his sword body. The once-vibrant sword city was left with only a forest of flowers.

Later on.

The prosperity of Yunzhou, the fine wine and the martial world, the elegance of the swordsmen—these could only be glimpsed through the mouths of the people who escaped and within that evergreen forest of flowers.

The vibrant scene was displayed before her eyes, but Ying Bing felt a sense of unreality, as if separated by a lifetime.

"Thanks for earlier."

The boy's voice suddenly sounded. Surrounded by so many people just now, Li Mo really didn't know how to get away.

"Mm..." Ying Bing snapped back to reality and shook her head. "I want to go back early to practice, but..."

"I see."

Li Mo seemed to relax a bit. He took out two copper tokens from his怀里. "I only managed to get two tickets for the Meihua Pavilion."

"Tickets?" Ying Bing's eyes paused slightly. Her parted lips closed again.

"Listening to an opera?" Jiang Chulong's eyes lit up. But after looking at Brother Li and then Sister Ice, she said quietly, "I... I have something to do tonight... Brother Li can... take me out to play next time..."

"What is it?" Li Mo asked, confused.

Jiang Chulong's lips trembled, her voice getting smaller and smaller. "There's... there's still trash... to pick up..."

Li Mo: "..."

So, after thinking for a long time, the excuse the little Princess Jiang came up with was still going out to pick up trash.

He originally wanted to tease the Ice Cube.

"Actually, I'm a magician. Do you believe it, Chulong?" Young Master Li's performance persona kicked in, his face full of mystery.

"I believe!" Jiang Chulong nodded with firm eyes, answering instantly.

"If you don't believe, then I... huh?" Li Mo was choked, feeling helpless. "...You're supposed to say you don't believe it."

"But... but... I don't know... what a magician is..." The little Princess Jiang tilted her head in confusion.

As long as it's Brother Li, believing is enough.

"A magician is someone who can suddenly make things appear." He explained, then rubbed his hands together. Behind the two copper pieces, he suddenly slid out another one. "Ta-da-da~"

"Now there are three!"

Ying Bing: "..."

So childish.

Jiang Chulong: "Wow... so amazing!"

......

Before listening to the opera, Li Mo took the two girls to a ready-made clothing shop first. The styles and fabrics here were much better than those in the prefecture city, and even Wuyun纱 was openly sold. The price was naturally much higher, but for Li Mo, who was wealthy and generous, it made no difference.

No girl dislikes beautiful clothes. The little Princess Jiang had never been to a ready-made clothing shop and was stunned in front of the dazzling array of clothes.

"Chulong, which one do you like?"

"I... I don't know..."

"Okay, which one do you *dislike*?"

Li Mo changed his approach.

After the little Princess Jiang carefully pointed out the styles that didn't suit her, Li Mo said to the shopkeeper:

"Don't include that one, wrap up all the others."

"Ah?"

The shopkeeper felt a little shock. He even suspected this handsome young man was sent by the clothing shop opposite to cause trouble. Until Young Master Li took out a large box from his spatial artifact and started counting silver bills.

"One, ten, hundred, thousand, Dad, Grandpa, Great-grandpa..."

"Can you deliver these to our residence after wrapping them up?"

"Having been secluded for years, my Iron Legs Floating on Water has finally reached the time to reappear in the martial world!"

"?"

Looking at the two-hundred-plus-pound fat boss, Young Master Li didn't quite understand how he could float.

......

The two girls went in to change clothes. Li Mo looked at the bright moon in the sky. After waiting for a moment, footsteps finally came from behind.

He turned around, and they were both changed.

The Ice Cube now had a bit of contrast. Her celadon-colored dress was slightly shorter, reaching her knees, and her white jade-like legs were visible underneath. She was even wearing a velvet flower hairpin? She frowned, seeming to find it strange herself.

"Maybe I should change..."

"Pfft..."

Li Mo hadn't seen such a contrast before. The boss's wife really knew how to coordinate outfits.

"It looks great like this, no need to change!"

What about the little Princess Jiang?

She had changed into a gold-trimmed red dress, the cloth strip removed. Her small hands were clasped behind her back, her eyelashes trembling as she didn't dare to lift her head.

The dress was gorgeous and figure-hugging, adding a touch of bright elegance to her pure and delicate nature.

By the way, how did the boss's wife搭配 (coordinate) it so perfectly?

"Does it look good... Brother Li?"

"This will be the material for my dreams tonight..."

"Ah?"

"It's nothing. Boss, does your boss's wife offer delivery service?"

"Uh..."
