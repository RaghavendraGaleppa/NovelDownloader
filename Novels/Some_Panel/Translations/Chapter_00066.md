# Chapter 65: Invincible Li Changxiao

A point of white light burst forth from the sword tip, dazzling and blinding, making it impossible to look directly.

"Not bad!"

"Take a sword strike from me too!"

Yang Ji thrust his longsword forward with a fierce motion, his qi locked onto a target. Endless sword qi, imbued with an inexplicable power, swept out. Just like before, the sword qi seemed to carry the weight of the heavens, engulfing everything with immense power and even more piercing sharpness as it surged forward.

This sword strike was incredibly fast; it was the Shock Sword Dao, containing ten percent of sword intent.

Boom!

This sword collided head-on with Jian Chuan's One-Word Killing Sword. Brilliant sparks continuously scattered, and terrifying spiritual wind raged outwards.

Jian Chuan's peerless sword qi, upon touching Yang Ji's Shock Sword Dao, instantly disintegrated as if a subject meeting their monarch, offering no resistance whatsoever. In the blink of an eye, both he and his sword were sent flying.

Bang!

He fell to the ground!

Jian Chuan was not only defeated but also crashed directly onto the ground, looking even more dishevelled than Ren Tianjing.

Yet, no one slighted Jian Chuan, nor did anyone dare to slight Yang Ji. Their eyes were filled with shock; they felt an even more terrifying sharpness and sword intent from Yang Ji's strike than before.

"The sword qi contains endless sharpness, yet it suddenly transforms into formlessness, as if nonexistent yet omnipresent," Jian Chuan said suddenly. "Is that ten percent sword intent?"

"Yes!" Yang Ji nodded.

"You've cultivated a Grand Divine Ability, yet you've comprehended ten percent sword intent." Jian Chuan's heart trembled.

As fellow swordsmen, he knew what this implied.

Taking a deep breath, Jian Chuan said with a tone of envy and awe, "Grand Divine Abilities are complex and difficult to comprehend. For fellow Daoist to achieve initial mastery at this age and even comprehend ten percent sword intent, you are truly a sword dao genius, enviable indeed."

"I consider my own comprehension not bad, but compared to fellow Daoist, I am but a firefly beside a bright moon."

"You are also very strong. If I hadn't used ten percent sword intent, I wouldn't have been able to defeat your strike." Yang Ji glanced at him calmly and asked, "So, do you still wish to fight?"

"No, I won't." Jian Chuan couldn't help but offer a bitter smile.

"Hmph, isn't it humiliating enough? Come back now!" True Monarch Tian Shang's face darkened.

Jian Chuan bowed respectfully and retreated behind True Monarch Tian Shang.

"Little Jian Yuan, I didn't expect you to take in another disciple with such excellent comprehension, but his bone structure is too poor; he'll hardly be of much use in the future," True Monarch Tian Shang said with a sinister tone.

"That's none of your concern." True Monarch Jian Yuan smiled faintly, looking quite pleased.

True Monarch Tian Shang snorted lightly and cast a sidelong glance at the old man behind her.

The old man smiled slightly and stepped forward.

His hair was grey, and his appearance was ordinary, but his eyes were exceptionally sharp, like an eagle's talons, making people afraid to meet his gaze directly.

"I am True Monarch Yin Zhi of the Evergreen Sect. For me to step forward and fight like this is a bit like bullying a junior," he chuckled, yet his aura continuously pressured Li Changxiao, bearing down on him.

Li Changxiao smiled faintly. "Having watched for so long, my hands are itching a bit. Then let us have a match." With a single step, a ripple of sword qi spread out, shattering True Monarch Yin Zhi's qi presence. True Monarch Yin Zhi's expression immediately changed slightly.

"Although this boy is a genius, you are a Nascent Soul True Monarch. You can suppress him with your realm. This level is not so easy to fight across ranks. When you make your move later, remember to be ruthless and give Little Jian Yuan a good show," True Monarch Tian Shang coldly transmitted.

"Good! Master, don't worry, I will definitely deflate this boy's arrogance." True Monarch Yin Zhi sneered.

Although True Monarch Yin Zhi spoke thus, how could he dare to underestimate Li Changxiao, this renowned genius? On the surface, he was calm and composed, but deep within his pupils, solemnity and gravity were etched.

True Monarch Yin Zhi stood there, and wisps of netherworld spiritual mist surged from within him, condensing into a Nine Nether Demonic God over ten feet tall behind him.

Then, he flew into the demonic god's brow.

Li Changxiao floated up into the air, gathering wind and clouds. Wisps of light blue spiritual mist spread from within him, like a celestial immortal descending upon the world. Clearly, he had also cultivated the Spirit Water Art, and his spiritual power carried hints of blue.

The netherworld spiritual mist and the light blue spiritual mist collided in mid-air, erupting into brilliant and splendid light.

Boom!

A low, muffled roar reverberated in all directions.

Waves of immense spiritual might diffused from the collision point of the two spiritual mists.

Circles of spiritual ripples spread out, causing the spiritual energy circulation within everyone's bodies to become somewhat sluggish.

Rumble!

At the intersection of the two spiritual powers, electric snakes slithered, and fire sparks shot in all directions. Thunder even roared, as if a heavenly tribulation was brewing in the heavens above.

All of this was merely the pre-battle accumulation of power between the two, yet it was already so terrifying.

No one knew what kind of earth-shattering spectacle their actual clash would be.

The crowd was shocked and appalled.

They dared not linger any longer and flew directly to the edge of the sky, only then letting out a sigh of relief.

A Nascent Soul True Monarch and a peak Golden Core genius, now clashing, would surely be as magnificent as an epic.

At the convergence of the two spiritual mists, spiritual light shattered and exploded.

Streaks and wisps of energy surged in all directions, causing the surrounding space to crackle.

Just as the two spiritual mists were about to explode, True Monarch Yin Zhi's Heaven-Earth Dharma Manifestation behind him moved with a roar, slamming a finger fiercely towards Li Changxiao.

Seemingly a light touch, it was actually imbued with the great power of heaven and earth.

Li Changxiao wasted no words, immediately manifesting his sword, swift and ruthless. A ferocious aura shot straight into the sky, dispersing the clouds.

A blazing sword, soaring into the air, unleashed mighty divine power. Roaring sword qi enveloped the flying sword, gushing out like the waters of the Yellow Springs, aiming to utterly crush True Monarch Yin Zhi's Heaven-Earth Dharma Manifestation.

A cold sneer crossed True Monarch Yin Zhi's lips.

"The Heaven-Earth Dharma Manifestation can invoke the great momentum of heaven and earth, wielding their immense power. Today, I shall let you witness the might of a Nascent Soul True Monarch."

"Nether King Punch!"

True Monarch Yin Zhi activated his Dharma Manifestation and casually threw a punch.

A solidified black fist flew through the air, expanding to an extreme size, instantly overshadowing the sky and blotting out the sun.

In the darkness, only the flying sword wielded by Li Changxiao roared.

The flying sword seemed intent on piercing through this black fist.

The sword light slammed into the five fingers of the black fist, and sword qi explosively spread, intending to completely shred it.

One could see a long sword within, transforming into a swimming dragon, wreaking havoc and devouring the black nether mist.

"An ant trying to swallow an elephant, how amusing!" True Monarch Yin Zhi sneered, his eyes widening. His Heaven-Earth Dharma Manifestation behind him violently shook, scattering large swathes of sword qi, even causing the flying sword within to halt.

Then, the black fist crushed down. The sword qi shattered instantly, and the flying sword within let out a metallic clang, uncontrollably falling.

"A Nascent Soul True Monarch is indeed somewhat powerful, but this is as far as you go." Li Changxiao grinned, leaping up to receive his flying sword. Intense sword intent surged forth, directly shredding the black fist.

With one sword strike, he dispersed the demonic god Dharma Manifestation.

"What?" True Monarch Yin Zhi paled in shock, his forehead covered in a fine layer of cold sweat. He formed hand seals, attempting to condense his Heaven-Earth Dharma Manifestation again.

But he still couldn't stop the decline.

Boom!

The powerful sword qi blew his face into a distorted ripple, like water, making it impossible for him to even open his eyes.

Pfft!

A point of blood appeared.

Li Changxiao held his flying sword, directly thrusting the tip into True Monarch Yin Zhi's glabella.

"If my flying sword advances another half an inch, your soul will be damaged!"
