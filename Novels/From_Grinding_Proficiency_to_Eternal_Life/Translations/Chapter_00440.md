# Chapter 440: The Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locking Calamity and Suppressing Destiny Method

"This Seat shall impart to you the *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locking Calamity and Suppressing Destiny Method*. It can sever the karma planted by the Nine Abysses and dissolve the confusion in your heart. Once you have successfully cultivated it, there will naturally be matters for you to handle, and at that time, your displeasure can be removed."

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan's heart settled slightly. It seemed that True Lord Qingyuan was indeed protective of his own; at least he hadn't backed the wrong person. However, regarding the specifics of what would follow, he still had to be cautious.

True Lord Qingyuan's voice suddenly became ethereal. "When the time is ripe, this True Lord will naturally help you settle the score."

Within the Primordial Origin Sect, there are no good people.

Xu Yunfan cupped his hands respectfully and said, "Disciple thanks True Lord for his generous gift. I will surely cultivate the *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locking Calamity and Suppressing Destiny Method* diligently and live up to True Lord's expectations."

True Lord Qingyuan's voice grew even more distant, yet it carried an undeniable authority. "The karma secretly planted by that scoundrel of the Nine Abysses was never something you should have borne. Cultivate with peace of mind. When your cultivation method reaches great completion, there will naturally be a time for you to display your prowess."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, and he secretly thought, "Is True Lord implying that I should personally settle this grudge?"

He immediately rejected this thought. Perhaps the plan was to smash the opponent's den when the time was ripe, but killing a True Lord?

Xu Yunfan dared not even think about it.

A True Lord has already formed a Golden Core. Once a Golden Core is swallowed into the dantian, one learns that one's fate is in one's own hands, not in the heavens.

A Golden Core True Lord has attained an alternative path to longevity. Even if their physical body perishes, they can still re-cultivate through reincarnation to regain the position of True Lord.

However, men can stumble and horses can slip.

What twists and turns might occur during the reincarnation of a Golden Core True Lord and their ascension to the throne is unknown.

Even though a Golden Core True Lord possesses immense神通, reincarnation and re-cultivation are not foolproof.

If they encounter obstacles during their ascension, or if their enemies find their reincarnated body, the dangers involved are also unpredictable.

Upon hearing these words, Xu Yunfan's last trace of doubt vanished like smoke.

He bowed deeply. "Disciple will remember True Lord's teachings. I will surely cultivate in seclusion and await True Lord's decree."

Xu Yunfan felt a golden, radiant scripture appear in his soul, each word writhing like a living creature.

Just as he was about to kowtow in thanks, he saw that True Lord Qingyuan had already transformed into a wisp of pure qi and merged into the Destiny-Controlling Lamp. Only his lingering voice echoed in the hall.

"Refine that Ten Thousand Soul Banner well; it might become a treasure for protecting your path in the future!"

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan finally put down a heavy stone. Taking out the Ten Thousand Soul Banner was naturally to show his attitude.

The True Lord might not want it, but you cannot fail to offer it.

This is a matter of attitude.

If this item did not have the True Lord's endorsement and support, and he took it out to show off, he would likely be plotted against.

Xu Yunfan was about to leave the Immortal Palace when he suddenly felt a weight in his sleeve. A dragon-eye-sized green pearl quietly fell into his palm.

The pearl was crystal clear all over, with lightning light wandering inside, and a faint dragon's roar could be heard.

"Congratulations, Daoist Xu!"

True Lord Baiyue stepped forward quickly, his gaze fixed on the green pearl, his tone unable to conceal his envy. "This is the 'Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl,' a supreme treasure refined by True Lord Qingyuan using the Azure Dragon's Saliva from the beams of the Immortal Palace. It is said that True Lord Qingyuan only obtains three drops of Azure Dragon's Saliva every sixty years, and it takes a considerable amount of time to refine such a pearl."

Xu Yunfan was delighted upon hearing this and quickly held the pearl in his palm to examine it closely.

He saw that thunder patterns flowed within the pearl, and a faint shadow of an Azure Dragon could be seen coiling inside.

Just as he was about to ask, True Lord Baiyue continued, "This pearl is not only an essential item for cultivating the *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locking Calamity and Suppressing Destiny Method*, but its more marvelous function is its ability to conceal heavenly secrets. Even if other True Lords use divination techniques to investigate, they would only see a chaotic void."

At this point, True Lord Baiyue suddenly lowered his voice. "To be honest with you, such a treasure for avoiding disasters and blocking calamities is rare even within the entire Primordial Origin Sect. If it were not personally bestowed by the True Lord, even those True Lords would be envious."

His eyes flickered as he stared intently at the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl in Xu Yunfan's hand for a long while, finally letting out a long sigh. "I have cultivated for three hundred years, yet I still haven't obtained such a protective treasure. I am truly ashamed."

Xu Yunfan understood the deeper meaning in his words and discreetly put the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl away. He cupped his hands and said, "Senior Brother is joking. Since this item was bestowed by the True Lord, this junior will surely cherish it."

He smiled and cupped his hands, saying, "Senior Brother Baiyue is joking. You are already at the Great Perfection of the Foundation Establishment realm, just one step away from the Golden Core. To you, such external objects must surely be dispensable."

True Lord Baiyue stroked his beard and laughed. "Junior Brother has deep fortune and blessings. This Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl not only aids in cultivating the *Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locking Calamity and Suppressing Destiny Method* but also allows one to hide one's form and conceal one's trace. If one achieves perfect success with it, and possesses such a heavenly treasure, it is feared that even the heavenly tribulation would not be able to find you."

"And in the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture*, there is also the method of the Coiling Snake and Tortoise Form. If the two are combined..."

True Lord Baiyue couldn't help but clap his hands. "As long as you don't stick your head out in the future, people might not even be able to sense your existence."

Suddenly, his expression turned serious. "But Junior Brother, remember well, this item must never be shown to others easily. Although you have the True Lord's backing, there will inevitably be those who take the risk."

After all, this pearl can be used for more than just cultivation.

Before he finished speaking, the green pearl in Xu Yunfan's sleeve suddenly trembled slightly, emitting a clear dragon's roar.

True Lord Baiyue saw this, a flash of surprise in his eyes, and quickly took a half-step back, forcing a dry laugh. "It seems the True Lord has already placed a restriction within the pearl. It was I who worried unnecessarily."

Xu Yunfan understood immediately and bowed solemnly once more. "Thank you for the reminder, Senior Brother."

He vaguely felt that this seemingly small green pearl was likely far from being an ordinary magic treasure.

To bestow such a heavy treasure...

There is no love in this world without reason.

He who wishes to wear the crown must bear its weight.

After True Lord Baiyue left, Xu Yunfan looked back at the gradually closing sea of clouds, stroking the black banner thoughtfully.

Zhang Ziyang's voice came from within the banner, lowered. "Was the True Lord Qingyuan just now... the person with the highest cultivation in this world?"

Xu Yunfan replied, "Not quite. Although True Lord has formed a Golden Core, within the Primordial Origin Sect, there are still Nascent Soul Dao Lords presiding above him."

Nascent Soul Dao Lords have transcended the mortal world and no longer concern themselves with worldly affairs. Ordinary cultivators might not see their true forms even in their entire lifetimes.

Such existences no longer manifest their traces in the world. According to the Primordial Origin Sect, their true bodies often reside in blessed caves and paradises, contemplating the profound mysteries of higher-level Daos.

He looked towards the distant sea of clouds, his tone carrying a hint of emotion. "The path of immortality is long, and the Dao is perilous. Even for existences like the Nascent Soul Dao Lord, they are merely halfway there. Only after swallowing a Golden Core does one realize that one's fate is in one's own hands, not in the heavens. And only when the Nascent Soul is greatly perfected can one truly glimpse the path to longevity."

After returning to the True Martial Peak, Xu Yunfan immediately activated the formations and restrictions set up on the peak.

He sat cross-legged on the Xuan Jade Mat, inserted the Ten Thousand Soul Banner into the Xun position, and placed the Xuanqiong Thunder Pearl at the Li position, beginning to sort through his gains from this trip.

"Although the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture* has reached great completion, to reach perfection..."

He looked inward at his dantian, seeing his true energy like mercury, slowly circulating through his meridians.

This *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture*, inherited from the True Martial lineage, requires patient and meticulous cultivation at the Foundation Establishment realm.
