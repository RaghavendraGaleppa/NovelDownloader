**Chapter 100: The Overlord's Valor**

It was evening, just as dusk was settling, and the western side of the city glowed with a fiery red hue. This was a man-made sunset, crafted by utilizing fire springs, resembling the lingering charm of a setting sun.

Qin Ming looked at Cui Chongxuan, who had grown taller, almost reaching the height of an adult man. Dressed in gleaming armor, he exuded a certain heroic spirit. Young Cui Chongxuan accompanied a graceful figure as they walked into the distance, chatting as they went. The woman was none other than Wang Caiwei, whom Qin Ming hadn't seen in a long time.

Seeing an old acquaintance, Qin Ming naturally thought of past events. "I feel like a complete patsy, blamed by some in the Wang family, resented by Li Qingxu, and Cui Chonghe is even ungrateful. Yet, Wang Caiwei and I only went on one outing together, and we barely exchanged a few words." If he had truly spent an intimate night with the Wang family's direct descendant, admiring each other, that would be one thing. But even now, his impression of the noble lady from the Wang family remains superficial; there's no "past affair" to speak of.

Yet, all other parties had reconciled, even the Cui and Li families had ceased their conflict. Only he remained in a dangerous situation, just as before. Some people didn't want him to "rise" and return to their sight; they preferred him to stay in a remote place forever. He couldn't be too dazzling, nor could he cause any stir.

Li Qingyue listened to his complaints and comforted him, "Let's go. I'll take you for a stroll and we can taste the local specialties."

Luofu City was vast, with ancient buildings visible everywhere, such as bluestone towers and black-gold palaces that had stood for millennia. In ancient times, Luofu Mountain was renowned in the Nightmist World, counted among its important outer-realm locations. These ancient structures were products of that era. Near the bluestone towers and black-stone palaces, which bore the accumulated marks of time, were bustling restaurants, inns, elixir halls, and weapon pavilions. People moved shoulder to shoulder, and business was booming.

"Many senior experts also like to visit places like this, seeking the splendid scenery of Luofu from a thousand years ago," Li Qingyue, clad in white, introduced these sights. The "sunset glow" from the west of the city spilled over her hair, her radiant white profile, and her slender figure, like an immortal willow. She seemed bathed in sacred light, outlined in gold, making her appear exceptionally ethereal and refined, truly like an immortal banished to the mortal world.

"Try Luofu City's specialty dragon meat; it tastes quite good," Li Qingyue said, queuing at a clean stall to buy two skewers of roasted meat.

Qin Ming took a bite and said, "Fish? It's very fresh and tender, no fishy taste."

"That's right, it comes from Jade Dragon Lake ahead," Li Qingyue said, leading him along the streets of the ancient architectural district, nearing an azure blue lake.

Luofu City possessed high-grade fire springs and was also accompanied by many second and third-grade fire springs. Along the roadsides, there were even dedicated fire spring channels, resembling flowing lava, forming a unique landscape. At night, the fire springs were manually controlled to dim slowly, and the channels were diverted, making the entire city less brightly lit and more hazy. On Jade Dragon Lake, people were boating, and from many large boats, the sounds of zithers, pipas, and melodious singing drifted over. Qin Ming felt slightly lost in thought; he had been away from this kind of life for over two years and felt a sense of unfamiliarity.

"Want to go boating?" Li Qingyue asked with a smile.

"No, I'm afraid of being stared at if I go boating with an outstanding core disciple of the outer realm like you," Qin Ming said, shaking his head with a smile. He wasn't nostalgic for the past, just a little emotional.

"Shall we eat first, or continue to admire the night view?" Li Qingyue asked.

"I'm not hungry yet, let's just walk around," Qin Ming said, looking at the nearby elixir hall, study, and weapon pavilion, feeling a surge of interest.

Li Qingyue nodded, noticing his gaze. "Luofu City has many cultivators, and the items sold in these pavilions are quite good." She led Qin Ming into an old weapon shop. Although she appeared elegant and otherworldly, she was not cold or unapproachable. She smiled and skillfully haggled with the boss.

"I sincerely want to buy this Dragon-Scale Armor, but your price is too exorbitant, isn't it?"

The plump boss was very talkative. "Lady, I've lived my whole life and only met someone as ethereal and beautiful as you today. But if you're going to talk about day-gold, you'll taint yourself with the mundane world."

Li Qingyue remained unmoved, smiling, "I am originally from the mundane world. If I were to become truly otherworldly, I would lose my true self. Halve the price of this Dragon-Scale Armor, then halve it again, and it will be about right."

"Hiss!" The plump boss gasped. "Fairy wielding a wisdom sword, your price-slashing is truly ruthless!" He turned to Qin Ming and said, "Young man, if I were you, I wouldn't even bat an eye. I'd pay the day-gold for the fairy without hesitation and buy this Dragon-Scale Armor. How could you let a fairy-like friend beside you haggle like this?"

Qin Ming was unfazed. "I think her bargaining is excellent. How about this? On top of the price she negotiates, I'll add one day-gold for you."

The boss wanted to glare. This Dragon-Scale Armor was priced in units of hundreds of day-gold. He thought to himself: *Are you kidding me? Only one day-gold? You're so handsome for nothing, yet so stingy! You might as well not have spoken!*

Li Qingyue said, "It's not real dragon hide anyway. At most, it just has a small amount of true dragon blood."

"Senior Brother, look, they're buying Dragon-Scale Armor," a young girl next to them said to a youth.

"Mm, pick whatever you like, I'll buy it for you," the youth smiled. When he looked at Li Qingyue, he was slightly dazed. She truly was a fairy!

Soon, Li Qingyue finished negotiating the price and handed the Dragon-Scale Armor to Qin Ming. "The leather is extraordinary, and the defense is very strong. You should wear it when you go back."

The plump boss looked at Qin Ming with a strange gleam in his eyes, truly impressed. Beside them, the young man was petrified, feeling utterly unwell. Looking at his junior sister, who was still picking out armor not far away, he suddenly found her less beautiful.

Qin Ming chuckled, "This is too embarrassing. You're taking me shopping, treating me to a meal, and now you're giving me such a valuable piece of Dragon-Scale Armor..."

The plump boss really wanted to stop Qin Ming and have a long chat.

Upon hearing this, the young man's feelings became hard to describe. He instantly lost the desire to pay for his junior sister.

"Don't be polite with me. Back when I wanted to taste what wine was like, you treated me to incredibly expensive wine." Li Qingyue and Qin Ming left, walking and chatting, laughing as they recalled past events.

"Who would have thought that today's Fairy Li almost became a little drunkard back then, haha..." Qin Ming laughed. Among his closest friends in the past were Li Qingyue and Ning Siqi.

"The worst part is, you didn't touch a drop yourself," Li Qingyue said, recalling her slightly rebellious phase back then, demanding to drink. It was indeed quite amusing.

"I'm not used to drinking. Actually, I wanted to see Imperial Concubine getting drunk, or a girl doing drunken fist. But you didn't even blush or skip a beat; nothing happened," Qin Ming said, feigning regret.

"Why do I feel like punching you?" Li Qingyue tidied her beautiful hair. This guy actually wanted to see her drunk back then!

"Isn't that Li Qingyue?" someone exclaimed, knowing she was one of the popular candidates vying for a near-immortal artifact. Several outer-realm disciples followed Li Qingyue and Qin Ming into a famous study, which sold books related to cultivation. Qin Ming wanted to look for secret texts that contained the crystallized wisdom of previous generations.

They ascended floor by floor. While the lower floors contained various extraordinary secret texts, Qin Ming couldn't achieve spiritual resonance with them, and he was only allowed to flip through one or two pages. It wasn't until they reached the highest, sixth floor, that Qin Ming discovered a blood-stained black beast-hide book. He immediately became interested, feeling that it might be extremely valuable.

"Young man, just look at this book through the crystal panel. It's truly extraordinary. If you want to buy it, you'll probably need your elder family members to negotiate. Hmm, even small sects can't afford its price," an old man sitting on the sixth floor said.

Qin Ming realized that the origin of this classic might be intimidatingly significant.

"Junior Sister Li, you're here too? What book are you looking for?" A few outer-realm disciples followed them upstairs. One of them feigned a coincidental meeting and greeted them with a smile. Qin Ming realized he didn't know any of them. There were many outer-realm disciples, and aristocratic family members only constituted a small portion. These people were all extraordinary, and the young man who spoke first seemed to be their unspoken leader. His name was Tang Xumi. He wasn't from an aristocratic family, but his talent was exceptional. He was very famous in the outer realms, rising extremely quickly, and was also one of the popular candidates to acquire the legendary item this time.

Qin Ming felt that trouble might be coming his way. Li Qingyue was so outstanding, it was natural that some very powerful outer-realm disciples would want to approach her.

"This is..." Sure enough, Tang Xumi looked over.

"He's my cousin," Li Qingyue introduced with a smile.

Qin Ming had expected some minor mishap, but the situation turned out to be completely different from what he had imagined.

"Brother Li, hello, I feel like we're old friends at first sight," Tang Xumi said enthusiastically, asking what he wanted to buy and offering to help him decide.

"I'd like to look at this ancient volume," Qin Ming said, pointing to the black book in the crystal cabinet.

Tang Xumi actually knew the book and said with a solemn expression, "This is incredible. It's the original text, very famous. Its absurdly expensive price is one thing, but ordinary people are also quite intimidated by its background and don't dare to buy it."

"It has a significant origin?" Qin Ming asked.

Tang Xumi sighed, "Of course. This is the Overlord's Legacy. Over a hundred years ago, the Overlord rose through physical mutation, dominating the Nightmist World. He was a renowned powerhouse, wielding his Overlord's Spear; many outer-realm cultivators could barely withstand a single strike from him."

"So it was him," Li Qingyue also understood what was going on.

Tang Xumi nodded. "That Overlord, the Skyglow Force he cultivated wasn't particularly outstanding, but after he broke through from the Outer Manifestation realm to the Spirit Field realm, he became incredibly fierce. As his cultivation continued to rise, he became unstoppable, truly capable of shaking heaven and earth."

The term "Outer Saint" had been abandoned by many because it wasn't enough to "manifest sainthood," leading to ridicule. The more common term was: Outer Manifestation. After this realm, came the "Spirit Field" realm, the path to new life.

"Someone who wasn't outstanding in the first two major realms could actually soar from the third major realm onwards?" Qin Ming asked in surprise.

Tang Xumi said, "Do you know how he died? Over a hundred years ago, he dominated the world, truly living up to the name of Overlord's Valor. He cleaved an outer-realm expert to death with his great spear, which eventually drew out that expert's master, who personally came out of seclusion and killed the Overlord." He added in a low voice, "That senior who made the move is Li Qingxu's current master, one of the most renowned figures in the Nightmist World!"

Qin Ming realized why many people were intimidated by this original text. A secret volume personally written by someone killed by such a senior expert—ordinary people truly wouldn't dare to buy it. However, he guessed that handwritten copies must have circulated.

Li Qingyue said, "This is the Overlord's Legacy. He hastily wrote it when he was being pursued by that senior expert, so it's incomplete. His world-shaking unique martial art is destined to be lost."

Qin Ming's heart couldn't be calm. He looked at the old man guarding the sixth floor and said, "Senior, may I handle and look at this ancient book?"

"You're not the buyer, so don't touch it," the old man refused.

"Senior, according to the rules of the study, all books can be sampled for a page or two," Li Qingyue spoke up.

Tang Xumi also chimed in to help. "That's right, Senior. My Senior Brother bought a very expensive book from you yesterday. We're considered returning customers, you should give us some consideration." Other outer-realm disciples also spoke up when they saw this. The old man was helpless; with several elite outer-realm disciples speaking on their behalf, he couldn't refuse.

Qin Ming touched the beast-hide book and found that he could only open one page. The inside was sealed with fine golden threads, and there was a special restriction emanating strange fluctuations. However, this was enough for him; even just the beast-hide cover would suffice. He made himself remain calm, without a ripple of emotion, while simultaneously concentrating intensely, achieving an emotional resonance with the ancient beast-hide book.

Clearly, it contained the Overlord's crystallized effort and heart's blood. He could see black bloodstains remaining on both the cover and the first page, which were most likely the Overlord's work written in immense pain. A startling emotional wave instantly surged into Qin Ming's heart, allowing him to witness the Overlord of old, truly capable of shaking heaven and earth. That tall and sturdy figure unleashed a spear strike, actually stirring the turbulent black clouds across the sky, followed by a pouring rain.

Furthermore, Qin Ming saw the old senior. Killing the Overlord was not so easy for him; his radiant white palm had once been partially pierced by the great spear, and glowing blood had flowed. The Overlord's valor was indeed astonishing; he had even shaken the old senior who was renowned in the Nightmist World. That old senior was indeed terrifying. Standing in the distance, his body vibrated, and golden runes began to expand. Then, with a turn of his hand, he struck down, causing one of the Overlord's arms to explode.

...

Qin Ming tried hard to maintain his composure, but in the end, his body still trembled slightly.

"Brother Li, are you alright?" Tang Xumi asked in surprise.

"My cousin was injured a couple of days ago, but it's not a major issue," Li Qingyue said, supporting Qin Ming.

"I'm fine!" Qin Ming recovered. This time, he had gained immensely, acquiring the complete Overlord's legacy and fully mastering it.

"You're injured? I have elixirs here," Tang Xumi said, very concerned.

"It's nothing. I was just moved while touching this ancient book, as if I had crossed a hundred years. I imagined the Overlord's peerless grace in my mind, which stirred my blood, as if I saw an ancient grandmaster walking towards me..." Qin Ming mused.
