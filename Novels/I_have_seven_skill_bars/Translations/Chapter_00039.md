**Chapter 39: Who Did He Kill?**

However, Ding Rui then speculated that the so-called demonic cultivators might be divided into good and evil, much like those he'd seen in works of art before his transmigration. For instance, there might be no truly evil power, only truly evil people; even within the evil faction, there could be good individuals, so perhaps the two sides weren't entirely incompatible. He even imagined himself helping ordinary cultivators and demonic cultivators set aside their prejudices and reconcile. After all, Yang Shou was a demonic cultivator, yet also someone who could live a normal life among them.

But Old Huang's words shattered all his conjectures!

It turned out that demonic cultivators weren't a race. Nor was there any discrimination or prejudice. Whether one was righteous or evil was entirely up to each cultivator's own choice, just like some people chose to be good, while others chose to be bad.

“Among the most severe issues is that they cannot convert other cultivators' true essence into their own in a very short time. After all, the imprint of the original cultivator's self is incredibly strong within their true essence. When this true essence, bearing traces of other cultivators, remains in their bodies, it constantly puts them in a state where they might suffer qi deviation. The faster they cultivate, the higher the chance of qi deviation.”

“Secondly, the souls of other cultivators they slaughter and devour also trouble them, preventing their minds from finding peace and making them prone to emotional outbursts.”

“And these are problems we absolutely will not encounter.”

“Furthermore, Yang Shou didn't infiltrate the sect; he was originally a sect cultivator, growing up within the sect from a young age. He merely stumbled upon a demonic cultivation technique by chance.”

Old Huang sighed in relief after speaking. Clearly, this point was crucial; if overlooked, it might lead some people to proactively become demonic cultivators.

But Ding Rui wouldn't do such a thing. He was just a young boy who had transmigrated only about three years ago, one who hadn't even killed a chicken. Moreover, in this world, even chickens possessed consciousness and souls, no different from horse or bee cultivators, making it even more impossible for him to kill a chicken.

Ding Rui also let out a heavy sigh.

“Later, when Yang Shou went back and tried to discard the hide, he discovered that its contents were indeed a demonic cultivation technique.”

“I heard Yang Shou was also a pitiable person. He once had an elder sister who took great care of him, but she was killed by a demonic cultivator. He wanted revenge, but his talent was limited; even in his twenties, he was still only at the first level of Qi Refinement. Seeing no hope for revenge, he finally set his sights on the demonic cultivation technique.” Old Huang said, then suddenly changed his tone, “But no matter how pitiable he was, that cannot be a reason for him to harm other innocent cultivators' lives for the sake of cultivating a demonic technique. Thus, the sect elders, upon judgment, didn't even ask for his reasons and immediately dealt with him!”

Ding Rui nodded. What Old Huang said was indeed very reasonable; no matter how tragic a person's life might be, they couldn't harm other innocent people because of it.
