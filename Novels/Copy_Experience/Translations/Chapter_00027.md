**Chapter 27: The Death of Mo Qingyuan**

Lu Xu noticed that Old Man Xu was running towards a forest in the distance. The forest wasn't far from the town, making it easier to escape if they got inside.

"Old Xu failed to escape once before, so it seems he's done his homework this time. I'll just follow him!"

In the darkness, the Qi Condensation experts were clashing with each other, while the low-level Qi Condensation cultivators quietly slipped away, fishing in troubled waters.

Old Man Xu and his grandson were about to rush into the forest.

Suddenly, a white light streaked in from not far away, blocking their path.

“Old man Xu, are you still not giving up?”

From within the light, a figure emerged, holding a folding fan and clad in white robes. It was none other than Mo Qingyuan, a disciple of the Mo family.

“You?!”

Upon seeing him, Old Man Xu immediately pulled his grandson behind him, his teeth clenched in a mix of fury and fear as he stared at the man.

The opponent was at the fifth level of Qi Condensation, while he was merely a Talisman Master unskilled in combat.

He stood no chance.

“Once, twice, but no third time. It seems you truly wish to die!”

“Fellow Daoist Mo, I still have some spirit stones here…”

Old Man Xu forced a difficult smile, quickly speaking softly, trying to persuade the other party to spare his grandson and himself.

“Hahahaha, if I kill you, the spirit stones will be mine anyway!”

The moment Mo Qingyuan’s words fell, his folding fan whistled out, flying straight towards Old Man Xu and his grandson.

Old Man Xu gritted his teeth, hastily pulling a talisman from his sleeve.

The talisman spontaneously ignited, and a golden light barrier appeared, enveloping the grandfather and grandson.

“Oh? A Vajra Talisman? Humph! How many blows can that withstand?” Mo Qingyuan scoffed with disdain.

Old Man Xu’s face turned ashen. This talisman was one he had bought years ago at the Divine Talisman Hall for self-defense, and today, he was finally forced to use it.

However, against a fifth-level Qi Condensation cultivator, how long could a Vajra Talisman last?

Old Man Xu suppressed the fear in his heart and pulled a small, earthy-yellow sword from his sleeve, slashing it forward.

“Bang!”

With a gentle flick of the white folding fan, the earthy-yellow small sword was immediately fanned away, its destination unknown.

The folding fan heavily struck the Vajra barrier, making the barrier tremble violently.

It probably wouldn’t take many more blows before the barrier shattered.

Despair filled Old Man Xu’s eyes as he watched.

Just then, a flash of green light suddenly appeared, cutting through the air beside Old Man Xu with lightning speed, striking towards Mo Qingyuan.

Mo Qingyuan hastily recalled his folding fan to block.

The green light was deflected, and the folding fan flew back into Mo Qingyuan’s hand.

“You audacious rogue, daring to ambush me!”

Mo Qingyuan let out a cold snort, his folding fan swiftly flying out towards where the green light had originated.

At the same time, he flicked his finger, and a talisman shot out, transforming into a golden light that enveloped him.

It was also a Vajra Talisman.

Seeing an ally arrive, Old Man Xu’s spirits lifted. He quickly summoned his earthy-yellow small sword and sent it slashing towards Mo Qingyuan.

However, his strength was too weak; he couldn’t break through the opponent’s defense at all, and Mo Qingyuan simply ignored him.

“Clang! Clang!”

The shimmering green light sword clashed with the white folding fan for several rounds, subtly falling into a disadvantage.

Old Man Xu grew even more anxious at this sight, relentlessly driving his earthy-yellow small sword to furiously assault the Vajra barrier.

“Release the talismans!”

At that moment, a low shout rang out, sharply reminding Old Man Xu.

He fumbled in his robes, grabbing a handful of talismans, distributing some to his grandson. Together, they activated them one by one, launching attacks towards Mo Qingyuan.

Head-sized fireballs and ground spikes erupted from the earth.

“This Old Man Xu…”

Lu Xu couldn’t help but feel a little speechless at the sight. The old man truly had no combat experience.

If he hadn’t intervened, Old Man Xu would probably have been killed by Mo Qingyuan already.

While controlling the Azure Radiance Sword to entangle Mo Qingyuan’s folding fan, Lu Xu also pulled out talismans and activated them one after another.

At this moment, battles were raging everywhere across this entire area.

There were seventy to eighty rogue cultivators who had rushed out, but most were in the early stages of Qi Condensation with little strength, and many were quickly killed by the Mo family cultivators.

However, there were simply too many people, and indeed, some powerful experts from the mid to late stages of Qi Condensation were among them, possessing considerable strength.

With their support, the Mo family was generally at a disadvantage, and some patrol members had already fled towards the market town.

“Boom!”

A burst of flames flew from Lu Xu’s side, striking towards Mo Qingyuan.

A first-grade mid-tier Blazing Flame Talisman!

Seeing this, Mo Qingyuan’s face suddenly changed. He slapped his storage bag, and another Vajra Talisman appeared in his hand, which he quickly activated.

“Boom!”

After the explosion, Mo Qingyuan’s figure was sent staggering backward, and one layer of his Vajra barrier was shattered.

“I’d like to see how many Vajra Talismans you have!” Lu Xu sneered inwardly.

He activated another Blazing Flame Talisman, sending it flying out, accompanied by four large fireballs activated by Old Man Xu and his grandson, all rushing towards Mo Qingyuan.

Mo Qingyuan’s face was ashen. He no longer had any Vajra Talismans and quickly switched back to his white folding fan for defense.

Seeing this, Lu Xu immediately controlled the Azure Radiance Sword to slash down fiercely.

“Boom!”

An explosion echoed, and Mo Qingyuan’s figure was sent flying backward in a cloud of dust.

His Vajra Talisman had been broken, but relying on his white folding fan, Mo Qingyuan still managed to block the deadly attack.

The thought of retreat had already sprouted in his heart; he no longer wished to entangle himself with these two rogue cultivators.

His life was far more valuable than theirs. Mo Qingyuan’s eyes flickered, constantly scanning his surroundings, searching for a way to break out.

But Lu Xu had no intention of letting him go!

Strike him while he’s down.

Lu Xu immediately activated more talismans, sending seven or eight fireballs surging forward.

And Old Man Xu, unexpectedly, gritted his teeth and with a flick of his hand, a first-grade mid-tier Golden Blade Talisman flew out.

The massive golden blade swiftly cut through the air, its momentum no less impressive than the whistling Azure Radiance Sword.

Under the continuous barrage, Mo Qingyuan activated several other talismans to resist, but he was quickly overwhelmed by the onslaught of attacks.

“Boom!”

Another loud bang. Mo Qingyuan stumbled backward, blood spilling from the corner of his mouth, clearly having suffered significant injury.

“Stop, I’ll let you go, you can leave now!”

Mo Qingyuan shouted, parrying Lu Xu’s continuous attacks from the Azure Radiance Sword.

Old Man Xu hesitated, his movements slowing.

To actually kill a Mo family member, he still didn’t quite dare; his heart was filled with apprehension.

“Ice Talisman!”

Lu Xu, however, had no intention of letting Mo Qingyuan off. With a low growl, he controlled the Azure Radiance Sword to relentlessly pursue and slash at the opponent, while simultaneously activating several Ice Talismans.

Old Man Xu’s body trembled, and he instinctively obeyed the command, sending out Ice Talismans one by one.

A vast expanse of white chilling mist immediately enveloped the area.

“How dare you! Do you truly wish to completely offend the Mo family? My father is a ninth-level Qi Condensation elder of the Mo family!” Mo Qingyuan was both shocked and enraged.

Without his barrier, and with his folding fan Dharma artifact constrained by the Azure Radiance Sword, he was powerless to resist the chilling attack.

His body quickly began to stiffen, his speed slowed, and even his control over his Dharma artifact became less agile.

“Binding Talisman!”

From the ground, roots and vines rapidly sprouted, coiling tightly around Mo Qingyuan, who was too slow to react, with lightning speed.

“Clang!”

Mo Qingyuan’s spiritual energy could no longer sustain it, and his white folding fan was sent flying by the Azure Radiance Sword.

At that moment, a tremendous terror instantly swept through Mo Qingyuan’s mind and body. Cold sweat profusely seeped out, drenching his back.

“Spare my life!” he screamed in terror.

“Swish!”

A streak of green light struck, severing both of Mo Qingyuan’s legs clean off, sending them flying high into the air.

“Ah!!!”

Blood gushed forth like a spring, instantly dyeing the ground red!

A shrill, agonizing scream pierced the air, the intense pain nearly causing Mo Qingyuan to faint.

His eyes were bloodshot, filled with boundless hatred as he stared towards Lu Xu, as if trying to etch that face into his memory forever.

“Why are you staring so wide-eyed?”

Lu Xu scoffed inwardly, and the Azure Radiance Sword slashed down once more. A fine head flew into the air.

On that face, there was still a strong expression of agony and unwillingness.

“He actually killed him…”

Old Man Xu stared blankly at the scene, his eyes filled with bewilderment and fear.

He had lived his entire life under the shadow of the Mo family’s authority. Despite being oppressed multiple times, he had never entertained thoughts of resistance, at most only thoughts of escape.

Let alone killing the child of a prominent Mo family figure!

“What should we do now? What if the Mo family investigates and pursues us…?” Old Man Xu grew anxious.

He was genuinely fearful and uneasy.

But Lu Xu, on the other hand, felt no ripples in his heart. Killing a Mo family member was no different from killing a pig to him.

His years of experience in the martial world before cultivating had long awakened the deep-seated ferocity within him; killing was simply that.

Killing these high and mighty individuals who oppressed others and had offended him brought him a sense of exhilarating satisfaction.

Lu Xu rushed forward, collecting Mo Qingyuan’s storage bag and folding fan, then searched his body.

“Swish!”

Not far away, a streak of light rapidly approached.

It wasn't a Mo family cultivator, but a rogue cultivator who had been lurking in the back, seemingly only at the third level of Qi Condensation.

This person was clearly the type who wanted to fish in troubled waters. Seeing that the battle here had concluded, he immediately rushed over.

However, he was also wise enough not to provoke Lu Xu and Old Man Xu.

After demonstrating no interest in Mo Qingyuan’s 'legacy,' the man headed straight for the forest, intent on leaving this troubled land.

Behind him, several other figures flew out in succession, also aiming for the forest.

These rogue cultivators, mostly at the second or third level of Qi Condensation, were incredibly excited.

After cautiously observing for so long, they had finally seized an opportunity to escape this place and completely distance themselves from all the chaos.

Old Man Xu also felt a sense of relief. “Forget it, let’s not worry too much. We need to escape first! Getting into this forest will be enough!”

The Vajra Talisman’s barrier dissipated, and Old Man Xu, holding his grandson’s hand, walked forward.

He intended to thank the black-clad youth and then immediately enter the forest to flee for their lives.

The area temporarily fell silent. More rogue cultivators, discovering the situation here, quietly moved closer.

It seemed this place was about to become a breach in the Mo family’s defenses, allowing many rogue cultivators to escape through it.

But then, immediately.

A change occurred!

“Ah!!!”

Less than ten breaths after the very first figure rushed into the forest, a shrill, agonizing scream immediately erupted.

The scream was extremely short, vanishing without a trace in the blink of an eye. Clearly, the person who rushed in was now in dire straits.

This single scream instantly startled the rogue cultivators who were planning to enter the forest, causing them to halt abruptly, their faces turning pale.

Lu Xu’s heart also skipped a beat, and he quickly looked up towards the forest.

In the forest not far away, a patch of white mist began to spread, rapidly covering a large area of the landscape in an instant.

Faint buzzing sounds of insects could be heard within the white mist, sounding noisy and irritating, making one feel dizzy.

“Not good, there are powerful cultivators ambushing us!”

Lu Xu was greatly alarmed. He didn’t bother with looting the corpse, immediately turning around and desperately rushing towards the market town.

The other few individuals also reacted quickly. After the sudden change, they immediately understood what was happening and all swiftly fled towards the market town.

However, one or two had rushed too far ahead, and it was too late to turn back now.

A cloud of insects flew out from the forest, engulfing them amidst their desperate howls.

Lu Xu controlled the Azure Radiance Sword to swiftly escape, while simultaneously glancing back. He saw several figures, completely cloaked in black robes, emerge from the forest.

“Ah!!!”

“Who are those people?”

“Not good, something’s happening!”

“It’s an ambush! Everyone stop fighting, a third party has appeared!”

“This is the Black Robe Society!”

“Oh no, it’s the Black Robe Society!”

From all directions, terrified shouts erupted.

Both the Mo family cultivators and the rogue cultivators ceased their fighting, all looking in terror at the black-robed figures emerging from every direction.
