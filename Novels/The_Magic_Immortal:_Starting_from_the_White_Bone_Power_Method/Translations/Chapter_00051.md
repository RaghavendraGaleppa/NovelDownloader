# Chapter 51: Human or Ghost?

A chilling wind swirled into the river bend, wailing like a mournful cry.  

This gloomy place was perfect for scattering ashes.  

Ripples spread across the water as Wang Chan suddenly leaped out from a puddle on the riverbank.  

With one hand, he waved his sleeve, recalling the four white needles.  

With the other, he retrieved a stack of mid-grade talismans from his storage pouch.  

Among them were three low-grade *Golden Sword Talismans*, five low-grade *Silver Sword Talismans*, one mid-grade *Golden Sword Talisman*, one mid-grade *Silver Sword Talisman*, and one mid-grade *Armor-Piercing Talisman*. Except for the *Armor-Piercing Talisman*, which he had casually purchased during his last visit to the Longing Courtyard, the rest were spoils from his previous battle.  

As the saying goes, *strike while the iron is hot*.  

Having dealt with the black-robed male cultivator, Wang Chan didn’t hesitate—despite the sting of using so many talismans—and hurled the entire stack at the unconscious white-robed female cultivator lying on the ground.  

The woman was currently protected by both a mid-grade *Protection Talisman* and a mid-grade *Golden Armor Talisman*.  

Though the *Golden Armor Talisman* was slightly weaker in defense compared to the *Diamond Talisman*, it had a rebound effect and was far more resilient than the *Protection Talisman*.  

Wang Chan estimated that even his white needles, specialized for piercing defenses, would require three strikes to break through.  

Unfortunately, his remaining spiritual energy wasn’t enough to unleash a fifth needle.  

**BOOM! BOOM! BOOM!**  

The explosions shook the air, blasting a small crater several yards wide. Dust and stones flew, smoke billowed, and water splashed wildly.  

When the chaos settled, the white-robed female cultivator had been torn apart, her limbs and flesh scattered, blood staining the surroundings.  

Her low-grade magic robe was also shredded—what a pity.  

At least her storage pouch remained intact.  

With the woman dealt with, Wang Chan finally exhaled in relief.  

He quickly swallowed two *Low-Grade Qi-Restoring Pills* and slapped a mid-grade *Qi-Restoring Talisman* onto his body.  

His nearly depleted dantian began to replenish, strand by strand, under the nourishment of the pills and talisman.  

Meanwhile, he wasted no time. He first collected the woman’s storage pouch, then flashed to another spot to gather the black scissors, the *Water-Avoiding Shuttle*, the formation disk, and the nine scattered formation flags, stowing them all in his pouch.  

When he picked up the *Water-Avoiding Shuttle*, he couldn’t resist running his fingers over it.  

This cold, thick, and sturdy magic tool was truly a fine item.  

Next, he approached the black-robed male cultivator’s corpse. After taking the storage pouch, he summoned a *Spiritual Hand* to search the body.  

Unexpectedly, he found more loot.  

First, a black low-grade magic robe.  

Second, a tongue stud—also low-grade—hidden in the man’s tongue. It was oval-shaped, much larger than an ordinary stud, with rough, grainy surfaces at both ends.  

Wang Chan couldn’t fathom what purpose this disgusting thing served. A perfectly good low-grade magic tool, ruined by such a vile modification.  

Still, it was worth several hundred spirit coins. Suppressing his disgust, he placed it in a jade box before storing it away to avoid contaminating his pouch.  

Afterward, he gathered the woman’s scattered remains and piled them with the man’s corpse. He then tossed a low-grade *Fireball Talisman* onto the heap.  

**WHOOSH!**  

Flames roared to life.  

While the bodies burned, Wang Chan scanned the surroundings but found nothing suspicious.  

Soon, the fire died down, leaving only ashes.  

Wang Chan expertly activated a mid-grade *Purification Talisman*, summoning an invisible cleansing wind to sweep the riverbank. Then, slapping a *Concealment Talisman* onto himself, he leaped silently into the river and vanished.  

**One cup of tea later.**  

The river bend was silent, save for the howling wind.  

**One incense stick later.**  

Still silent, but the wind grew fiercer, scattering the ghostly will-o'-wisps.  

**Half an hour later.**  

A rustling sound emerged from the crater left by the talisman explosions.  

After a moment, a slender hand reached out from the pit. After a few feeble movements, the fingers formed a seal, and with a flash of yellow light, a naked female figure leaped out.  

Her face, still charming, bore an unnatural flush. A black spider phantom flickered at her brow, tightly binding her mind and body.  

Gasping for air, she steadied her breathing and smoothed her spiritual energy. Then, shaking the silver bracelet on her left wrist, she summoned a thick silver barrier that hummed as it encased her.  

Only then did she dare to look around, her eyes wide with terror. Seeing no movement, she recalled her ordeal and began to sob quietly.  

Had she not used the *Earth Body Talisman*—a life-saving treasure she had kept hidden for over a decade—she would have died then and there. The talisman had allowed her true body to burrow underground at the last moment, leaving behind an *Earth Doppelganger* to take the fatal blow.  

*Water Escape Technique… Thunderous White Needles… casually throwing a stack of talismans… calmly looting the battlefield… burning the bodies and purifying the area before vanishing with a Concealment Talisman…*  

That man who had stared at her backside was no lowly rogue cultivator. Even the most notorious bandits on the wanted list paled in comparison to him.  

She had kicked an iron plate.  

Years of secluded life in her courtyard, drowning in petty romance and gossip, had dulled her instincts. She had forgotten the brutal reality of the cultivation world.  

*"Thankfully, the Earth Body Talisman’s illusion was flawless. Even he couldn’t detect it. He must be at the black market by now… Poor my Xuan’er…"*  

After a bout of weeping, her sorrow and fear gave way to venomous hatred.  

*"Even if your face was fake, I remember that brutal white needle. As long as you remain in the White Mountain region, my Zhou family will—"*  

**SHINK!**  

Black needle shadows burst from her skull, coalescing into a sinister black needle that hummed ominously.  

**BANG!**  

Her head exploded into a crimson mist.  

Instead of collapsing, her headless body also burst apart, the blood forming a crimson spider phantom bearing her vengeful face.  

Whether through some dark art or a symbiotic spirit’s power, the phantom lunged at a nearby ghostly flame.  

*"Found you!"*  

The spider merged into the flame—only to emerge moments later, slightly faded.  

Undeterred, it tried again, targeting another flame.  

After four attempts, the phantom was on the verge of dissipating.  

*"I’ll drag you to hell with me!"*  

*"Come out!"*  

*"Are you human or ghost?!"*  

*"AAAAAH—"*  

The phantom shattered like a bubble, its remnants scattering with the wind.  

**Half a cup of tea later.**  

One of the floating ghostly flames darted down, scooped up the fallen silver bracelet, and vanished into the water.  

---  

**Knock. Knock. Knock.**  

Beneath an ancient spirit locust tree in the Youlin Mountains, Wang Chan rapped three times before stepping back warily.  

A few breaths later, a portal appeared behind the tree. A black-cloaked cultivator at the late Qi Refining stage emerged and chuckled at Wang Chan, who had already retreated a dozen yards.  

*"First time here, friend? No need for alarm. I’m the guide. Show me your black market token and pay fifty spirit coins for entry."*  

Wang Chan tossed the token over without hesitation. As for the fee…  

He had expected an entrance cost—this wasn’t a charity, after all.  

But fifty coins was steep.  

A year ago, he’d have had to starve for months to afford it.  

And the black market’s extravagance was evident—a late-stage Qi Refining cultivator as a greeter?  

According to Madam Cheng’s jade slip, most black markets charged around twenty coins.  

*"Heh. You must know the White Mountain region has new management. Who knows if this market will even open again?"*  

The man’s explanation made sense.  

A new Nascent Soul cultivator now ruled White Mountain City—one from the Misty Cloud Sect.  

With only three markets a year, the premium was justified.  

Besides, desperate buyers would pay.  

And honest merchants didn’t come here.  

Thankfully, his recent windfall made fifty coins trivial.  

*"May your ventures prosper. Enter!"*
