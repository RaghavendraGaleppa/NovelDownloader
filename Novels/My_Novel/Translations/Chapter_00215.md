# Chapter 215: Passionate and Lustful? The Madam Interrogates

The journey of the water-walking flood dragon felt like a grand banquet.

The Dragon Appreciation Banquet had many sections: the Dispatching Waves Section, the Hundred Miles Section, the Thousand Miles Section, the Assisting Waves Section, and the Dragon Protection Section, the Ten Thousand Miles Section...

The Dispatching Waves Section went first, driving away the surrounding common folk. The Hundred Miles Section set up a banquet seat every hundred or hundreds of miles along the river. Several martial arts masters gathered at these seats, waiting for the flood dragon to walk the waters.

If there were difficulties, they would join hands to assist. If there were no difficulties, they would cheer loudly to boost momentum.

This particular water-walking journey was of utmost importance. The critical sections were the "Ten Thousand Miles Section" and the "Dragon Protection Section." For a flood dragon to walk the waters, crossing ten thousand miles of waterway constituted one level.

In the first ten thousand miles, it shed its snake body. In the second ten thousand miles, it initially took on the form of a dragon. In the third ten thousand miles, it possessed a slight dragon's essence.

The experts in the 'Ten Thousand Miles Section' must have contributed the most, even risking life and death and determining success or failure. Wen Caishang was originally the head of the Fourth Ten Thousand Miles Section.

However, the news was leaked.

To avoid trouble from enemies, Wen Caishang swapped positions with Zeng Taian. She changed to the "Dragon Protection Section," boarding the Dragon Riding Ship to accompany the flood dragon along its river journey.

The Dragon Protection Section was truly the most exhausting.

The river currents were swift, the ship rocked violently, and they rushed along the way.

There were seven people in the Dragon Protection Section.

Golden Blade Earth Flood Dragon · Zhu Butong, Sword-Hugging Old Woman · Su Yan, Sighing Sun Scholar · Qi Kaiyan, Sinking Monument Hand · Luo Sheng, Tyrant Cross Fist · Chang Kun.

There was also a blue-robed old man who was cold-tempered, rarely spoke, and rarely showed his face.

Li Xian was already familiar with Zhu Butong, Su Yan, and Qi Kaiyan. But he had never seen Luo Sheng, Chang Kun, or the blue-robed old man.

The great barrier of thirty thousand miles was approaching, and the situation was extremely unfavorable. Inside the ship's discussion hall, the decoration was simple. An oil lamp flickered as the experts gathered to discuss the matter.

The seven people slammed the table and decided to adopt Li Xian's brilliant plan to avoid the enemy's锋芒. Tyrant Cross Fist Chang Kun immediately informed the river flood dragon.

The flood dragon, knowing the situation, weighed the options. It chose to obey the crowd, swimming its dragon body and changing direction, entering the Submerged Flower River.

The river channel suddenly narrowed, making it difficult for the flood dragon's long body to stretch out. It stumbled along for over a hundred miles, reaching a place close to the Rushing Flower River. The flood dragon, carrying the Dragon Riding Ship on its head, suddenly leaped out of the water.

It initially revealed the momentum of riding clouds and mist.

Wherever it went, the water surged to the sky. Although the flood dragon could ride clouds and mist, it was not a true dragon in the end. Crossing several miles was already its limit.

It leaped over a village.

The common folk along the way, seeing the dragon's trace, were all dumbfounded. The flood dragon leaped past, bringing heavy rain along the way.

It was its first time riding clouds and mist, and it was very unaccustomed to it. Its dragon body swayed left and right, and it soon fell back into the river.

Avoiding the thirty-thousand-mile great barrier, the flood dragon gasped for breath. Having walked the waters to this point, it was nearing its limit. After crossing the three-thousand-mile barrier, the dragon beast showed more characteristics.

Its physique grew stronger, and its dragon claws became sharp and fierce.

They had a moment to catch their breath.

The remaining hundreds of miles of river channel were without danger. The flood dragon recovered its energy, and its condition improved somewhat.

On the Dragon Riding Ship.

Qi Kaiyan said, "If it weren't for Young Brother Li's brilliant plan, there would have been a fierce battle at the thirty-thousand-mile mark. Even if we passed that great barrier, the remaining nearly twenty thousand miles of waterway would have been precarious!"

"This humble boy just spoke casually. It is you seniors who have deep foresight, prepare for a rainy day, and resolve this situation. It has nothing to do with me," Li Xian said modestly.

"Good bearing. You have the style of your Madam!" Tyrant Cross Fist Chang Kun laughed.

Wen Caishang frowned slightly, thinking to herself: "Although Li Xian's experience is shallow, he is exceptionally intelligent. Given time, his talent will overflow. At that time, many will try to recruit him. I need to reduce his contact with outsiders."

She waved her hand, calling Li Xian back. She said, "Xiao Xian, this matter indeed has your credit. When we return to the manor, there will be a reward."

Li Xian said, "Thank you, Madam!" Seeing the heroes of the martial world showing off their might, displaying their talents, and stirring the wind and waves, he also wanted more opportunities to accumulate strength.

Wen Caishang's heart stirred, thinking of the past when the two of them hunted and sequestered themselves, practiced sword techniques together, and shared medicinal baths... it was very joyful. If this journey succeeded, she would have to lie low for several years to dispel bad luck. At that time, having Li Xian by her side would certainly not be boring. The joy in this matter is truly hard to describe.

Her expression was calm, and what she was thinking was completely invisible. She just nodded slightly, then turned and entered her room to practice her inner cultivation quietly.

Although the flood dragon had crossed the third barrier, its body was covered in lightning injuries, and the wounds still remained, greatly reducing its speed.

On the fifth and sixth days of the second lunar month, it only traveled a few thousand miles.

The people on the Dragon Riding Ship frowned, all feeling that something was bad.

The flood dragon's strength was depleted, its blood and energy were dissipating. Resisting the natural wind and waves and the raging thunderstorms was already its limit.

It no longer had the strength to fight powerful martial artists.

An old dragon, a sick dragon, a wounded dragon... these were delicious dishes for the Dragon Slaying Banquet. Everyone thought: "Since things have come to this, we can only give our all to assist!"

The Dragon Riding Ship stored wine, meat, and food. Every evening, as the water-walking momentum slowed, the chef on the ship would prepare food, stewing rice and dishes.

That chef was from the Sishui Prefecture of Longxiong Dao. His cooking skills were not bad, but he liked to add chili peppers. The meat dishes were red, looking very spicy at a glance.

In these few days.

Li Xian often communicated with the kitchen. He learned a few cooking skills and inquired about the customs and geography of Longxiong Dao and Sishui Prefecture.

What he saw while riding the river and what he heard while on the boat. All made him feel a great sense of gain: "The Way of Martial Arts lies in comprehending the heavens and earth. My curiosity about all things in the world is what makes me curious about the Way of Martial Arts!"

So another few days passed.

Occasionally, those at the Dragon Appreciation Banquet would cheer loudly.

Occasionally, those at the Dragon Slaying Banquet would shout loudly, crying to kill and fight.

The two sides were mixed, but overall, they progressed slowly. The water-walking had passed more than half.

The great trend was like a river current, rushing forward. Through重重 obstacles, it was possible to avoid one, but difficult to avoid the second.

When the path reached thirty-six thousand miles.

They encountered the powerful "Spring-Winter Couple." Their strength was formidable, and they blocked and killed the flood dragon. This section was unavoidable and inescapable; they had no choice but to fight.

Tyrant Cross Fist Chang Kun punched the river waves, roaring with anger. Sword-Hugging Old Woman Su Yan hugged her long sword with both arms. The two jumped into the river to fight the Spring-Winter Couple.

It was a truly dangerous battle.

A punch was thrown, and the river waves surged wildly, fish and shrimp fleeing. Sword-Hugging Old Woman's footwork was incredibly fast, treading on water as if walking on flat ground. Chang Kun's fist style was overbearing, and his fist momentum was hard to抵挡.

The Spring-Winter Couple, however, were no ordinary opponents. One held a "Spring Drum," the other a "Winter Whip." The Spring Drum resonated, and the Winter Whip struck. A chilling aura spread out.

The two sides were locked in a fierce battle.

The further the ship traveled, the harder it was to see.

Two of the seven sections were gone!

When the path reached thirty-eight thousand miles.

The "Wave排 Blade King" of Longxiong Dao stood迎著 the river, his clothes fluttering. His eyes were cold as he scanned the flood dragon.

The river was torrential, but he stood calmly.

Zhu Butong patted his golden blade and laughed, "Damn it, another good hand who uses a blade. I'll take him on!"

He leaped out and劈去 a blade head-on. The Wave排 Blade King drew his blade to counter. One blade came, one blade went. Gold blade met silver blade. One was like a golden dragon emerging from the world, his blade edge unstoppable. The other was like a silver spear standing firm, unmoved.

They were a perfect match.

The water mist弥漫, and the battle was at its height!

It startled the fish and shrimp to scatter.

The ship followed the water's flow, gradually moving away.

Only four of the seven sections remained!

At thirty-nine thousand miles, it was the sixth day of walking the river. The Rushing Flower River exited Longxiong and returned to Yu'nan! It wound and twisted, its momentum hard to predict.

The forty-thousand-mile barrier was approaching.

At that time, it was evening. The river channel was straight, and the setting sun hung over the river. The river surface shimmered, golden and brilliant.

Having walked the waters to this point, there was no longer the surging momentum of a river. There was only an old dragon gritting its teeth and holding on, swimming with its life.

Wen Caishang said, "Old Dragon Senior, please do your best."

The flood dragon said, "As long as I have a breath left, I will naturally return to the sea."

The setting sun was about to disappear.

Li Xian suddenly felt his hair stand on end, as if shrouded in immense danger. He looked intently and saw two groups of people confronting each other on both sides of the river channel.

On the left were the experts of the Dragon Appreciation Banquet, including his acquaintance Zeng Taian. On the right were the experts of the Dragon Slaying Banquet, numerous in number, all full of energy and spirit.

The two sides were at a stalemate. In reality, the Dragon Slaying Banquet held the upper hand. Inside the Dragon Riding Ship, Qi Kaiyan, the blue-robed old man, Sinking Monument Hand Luo Sheng, and Wen Caishang discussed the matter.

Qi Kaiyan said, "The situation here will likely cost us a few more lives. The order of action should be decided here."

Everyone knew the truth. The stronger one's strength, the more stable the dragon protection. At this moment, Sighing Sun Scholar Qi Kaiyan and Sinking Monument Hand Luo Sheng admitted they were no match for Wen Caishang.

The blue-robed old man had a bland expression and rarely spoke. But he was also a figure of status, a guest of the Looking Tower. It was unknown who was stronger between the two.

The blue-robed old man said calmly, "Wen Caishang, I will exchange a palm with you. Let's see who makes the final move."

After speaking, without waiting for Wen Caishang's reply, he suddenly struck out a palm. Wen Caishang lightly received it. The blue-robed old man took several steps back and said, "Truly formidable. You should go to your room and rest!"

"This barrier, we will handle it!"

The victor was decided.

Wen Caishang nodded and said, "Xiao Xian, there is nothing for you and me to do here. Come back to the room with me."

Li Xian said, "Alright."

They returned to the room. Suddenly, they heard a commotion outside—the sound of splashing water, the sound of fighting, the sound of weapons clashing, the sound of announcing names...

The forty-thousand-mile barrier, dangerous yet surprising, was barely crossed.

Of the seven Dragon Protection sections, only one remained.

The flood dragon swam past the barrier. The green color completely faded, replaced entirely by gold. Only nine thousand miles of river channel remained before reaching the sea.

After the slaughter, there was peace throughout the night.

The river flowed slowly.

Li Xian and Wen Caishang sat at the bow of the ship. The flood dragon had already transformed into a half-dragon, swimming slowly.

Li Xian cracked melon seeds and said with a smile, "Old Dragon Senior, now it's just the three of us."

"Yes," the flood dragon said. "How lively Longzhen Town was. To have reached this point, only we three remain."

Li Xian grabbed a handful of melon seeds, placed them in his palm, shook them, and blew gently. The shells were blown away, leaving only the kernels.

Li Xian said, "Old Dragon Senior, catch!" He tossed the kernels into the air.

The flood dragon raised its head and ate them all in one bite. But it couldn't taste anything. Wen Caishang laughed and scolded, "You boy, you're so rambunctious. Old Dragon Senior, please don't mind."

"How could I," the flood dragon said. "For these last nine thousand miles, I still need to rely on the Madam's assistance."

"I will naturally do my best, don't worry," Wen Caishang said.

Li Xian leaned against the ship's railing and said, "Old Dragon Senior, after you transform into a dragon, if there's a chance in the future, could you give me a ride?"

"Hahaha, no problem, no problem," the flood dragon said, rolling in the water.

Li Xian thought: "I've never ridden a dragon!" Feeling unusually calm and full of curiosity, he asked, "Old Dragon Senior, did you cultivate from a snake beast?"

The flood dragon said, "Yes and no."

"Old Dragon Senior, is a Black Snake," Wen Caishang said. "The Black Snake is a type of snake that has the opportunity to cultivate and transform into a dragon. Among the Black Snakes, there was a rare snake beast."

"It was four hundred years old and walked the waters across the river. It relied on itself to enter the sea and become a dragon. No one assisted it along the way. Those who came to block the river were all swallowed by it. It was extremely powerful."

The flood dragon asked, "Is there truly such a powerful flood dragon in the world? Wen Caishang, how do you know?"

Wen Caishang said, "It is a fact. How I know is my business. Old Dragon Senior, you don't need to ask."

"Very well," the flood dragon said. "Madam Wen has vast knowledge. I, this old dragon, am far inferior."

The flood dragon walked the waters.

At the beginning, its momentum was surging, traveling ten thousand miles a day, wind and rain without cease, thunder never stopping. At the end, it was tranquil and peaceful, yet hidden killing intent.

This nine thousand miles... should be the place with the heaviest killing intent.

The flood dragon asked, "By the way, what is your relationship exactly?"

Wen Caishang said calmly, "What, you old dragon, are you gossiping about my trivial affairs?"

"Naturally, the nature of a dragon is inherently lustful," the flood dragon said. "I feel that this Young Brother Li and I are quite fated. It's possible he is also quite lustful."

Wen Caishang immediately glanced over, her gaze meaningful, her eyes wandering over him. She thought: "If you say this boy has a lustful nature, it can't be said that he doesn't. When I was in seclusion before, he..."

Li Xian wiped away a cold sweat. "Old Dragon Senior, don't talk nonsense. I'm an honest fellow. I'm probably not fated with the word 'lust'."

"Li Xian," Wen Caishang said, her beautiful eyes looking at him, the corner of her mouth slightly raised, full of interest. "Since Old Dragon Senior is curious about our relationship. Then you should tell it."

"Tell it about the relationship between you and me."
