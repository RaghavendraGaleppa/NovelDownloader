# Chapter 41: Great Perfection of Qi Refining

Winter had departed.  

Yet spring seemed reluctant to arrive.  

A lingering chill still hovered over the town, and even ordinary folk could sense the unusual length of this year's winter compared to previous years.  

Many recalled the tales told by Master Wan at the Bowl of Fragrance Teahouse—stories of the ancient ginkgo tree in the River Valley Kingdom and its golden leaves, along with the legend of the impending calamity heralded by their fall.  

Some believed it to be true.  

At times like these, there were always those who scoffed, "Don't overthink it. Master Wan is just a storyteller. What does he know about calamities? His tales are nothing but entertainment."  

But stories could be both true and false—how could anyone be certain Master Wan's words weren't rooted in reality?  

For ordinary people, tending to today's fields, tomorrow's harvest, and the livestock of the days beyond mattered far more.  

Inside teahouses and taverns, they pondered the grand tides of history, but once they stepped outside, their concerns returned to the mundane necessities of life.  

Master Wan had vanished again, leaving Xiao Ji with no one to ask about the four-stringed lute. His questions weren't complicated: if someone found fragments of the lute, they could glimpse the hidden patterns of the world, enhance their insight, alter their fate, or even wield the shards as formidable magical artifacts.  

But what would happen if all the fragments were gathered? What precautions were necessary?  

Preparing in advance was crucial.  

For now, Xiao Ji couldn't uncover more about the Nine Treasures. Perhaps only after collecting all the fragments would he know what to do next.  

Nearly every night, he would take out the lute fragments from his green-brick storage artifact, studying them. The powerful shards filled him with surging spiritual energy, but they also made him increasingly restless.  

He had considered forging the three strings into a single artifact—both to serve as a hidden trump card and to stabilize the fragments. But since his ultimate goal was to gather all nine, he dismissed the idea.  

After all, crafting high-grade artifacts required spirit stones. Though he now possessed over three hundred, in the grand scheme of the cultivation world, that was barely a drop in the ocean.  

Today, his master craved braised pork, so Xiao Ji set out for the market.  

His cultivation plan had changed. Since the New Year, he had stopped visiting neighboring sects, limiting himself to wandering within Willow Town.  

It wasn't that he didn't want to go—cultivating alongside fellow practitioners would have been more effective. But his peculiar behavior had stirred unease among the town's sects.  

No one knew why this city-born Daoist had suddenly taken to frequenting their halls. In the past, they had exchanged mere nods of courtesy. Now, his constant visits raised suspicions—was he trying to steal techniques or artifacts?  

One after another, the sects erected conspicuous signs at their gates:  

**"Visiting Fellow Practitioners Must Make Appointments in Advance. Otherwise, No Hospitality Will Be Offered."**  

Xiao Ji knew he had been too eager in his pursuit of Foundation Establishment, harvesting benefits too aggressively.  

But it hardly mattered now. His goal was nearly achieved.  

His unique ability granted cultivation points only once per subject. Revisiting the same sources would be a waste of time.  

He had also realized that to earn cultivation points without leaving home, he needed to enhance the temple's reputation—attracting more visitors, even travelers passing through.  

Princess Yingxiao took on this task, claiming that wisdom in management and governance was required to make the temple thrive—and that she possessed just that.  

Xiao Ji paid her little mind, as long as she didn't leave—unless it was to return to the imperial palace.  

Walking down the still-chilly streets of spring, Xiao Ji checked his current cultivation level:  

**[Name: Xiao Ji]**  
**[Age: 19]**  
**[Affiliation: Primordial Spirit Temple]**  
**[Spiritual Roots: Erratic, Variable in Number]**  
**[Realm: Qi Refining, 12th Layer (111/120)]**  
**[Cultivation Method: Heaven-Collapsing, Earth-Shattering Purple Gold Art]**  
**[Perception Range: 300 Meters]**  

Through relentless effort, he had reached the 12th layer of Qi Refining. Completing this stage would signify Great Perfection, paving the way for the sacred step into Foundation Establishment.  

Since breaking through to the 12th layer, he had been in a state of exhilaration.  

While Foundation Establishment was insignificant in the broader cultivation world, in the mortal realm, it was a feat worthy of pride.  

But his progress had slowed. If he continued gathering cultivation points only within Willow Town, greater breakthroughs would remain out of reach.  

In the past, he had scrutinized everything—even stray dogs on the road.  

No one knew Willow Town better than he did.  

But to advance beyond Foundation Establishment, he would need to encounter new things—new people, new events, a fresh world beyond this familiar land.  

During the New Year, his cultivation had stalled at this very point. Gazing into a bronze mirror, he had encouraged himself: *"This will mark a brand-new beginning."*  

Yet the numbers hadn't budged since.  

Sometimes, gaining cultivation points was a matter of fate—not every observation yielded rewards.  

Shaking off these thoughts, Xiao Ji quickened his pace toward the market. As he passed the main street, the grand strains of music reached his ears.  

Following the sound, he spotted a peculiar procession entering through the southern gate—ostentatious and extravagant, with yamen guards clearing the way.  

Most striking was the towering three-tiered palanquin, its beaded curtain concealing a mysterious figure.  

At the front, burly men wearing totemic masks scattered spiritless talismans, chanting unintelligible incantations. Behind them, eight musicians played, followed by twenty women performing eerie, creeping dances.  

Trailing the palanquin was a group of uniformly dressed men, women, and children.  

The spectacle was impressive, yet unsettling—an indescribable air of strangeness clung to it.  

"Quite the entourage," Xiao Ji remarked, spotting Constable Song Yuanbao in plainclothes among the onlookers. He approached and clapped him on the shoulder. "Day off today, Constable Song?"  

"Ah, Daoist Xiao!" Song Yuanbao turned, smiling. "Yes, two days' leave. I planned to ride outside the city, but I heard an immortal from Mount Wuliang was arriving to recruit disciples, so I came to see."  

"I see," Xiao Ji chuckled. "I thought you'd be heading to the House of Joy."  

Nearby heads swiveled toward Song Yuanbao.  

"Daoist Xiao, don't say such things in broad daylight!" Flustered, Song Yuanbao pulled him aside. "Are you here for the same reason?"  

"I'm just buying pork belly—my master wants braised meat," Xiao Ji said, eyeing the palanquin. "The commotion drew me over."  

"The immortal will set up a stage in a few days to test spiritual roots," Song Yuanbao explained. "They say he can move mountains and contain seas—someone witnessed him splitting a peak in half!"  

For a town constable, well-traveled as he was, to make such claims without firsthand knowledge was bold.  

"An immortal? Carried by ordinary men?" Xiao Ji kept his gaze on the palanquin. "Seems spring has truly arrived—some creatures have ended their hibernation."
