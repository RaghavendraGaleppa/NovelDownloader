# Chapter 123: Nine Profound Anti-Dragon Cudgel

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows slightly as he watched the scene. The various facilities within the Heavenly Work City were convenient, but he hadn't expected the verification process to be so ingenious.

"Hmm, it is indeed him."

This person originally belonged to the Hidden Blade Pavilion but naturally separated from the Six Ministries after being promoted to Elder.

Upon seeing that the newcomer was Xu Yunfan, the newly promoted True Disciple of the Casting Hall, he harbored no ill intent. After curiously sizing him up a few times, he returned the True Disciple token and instructed, "Without the seal and letter from the Head of your department, you are not allowed to take martial arts manuals out of the Scripture Pavilion. There is another door ahead; simply insert your token to open it."

"Thank you for informing me, Elder."

After taking back the token, Xu Yunfan slowly stepped into the Scripture Pavilion.

The Scripture Pavilion was located deep within the Heavenly Work City, shrouded entirely in the cold glow of fluorescent stones.

Turning the token three times in the slot of the fine steel door before him, the sound of mechanisms operating and the clattering of rotating gears made him feel quite novel.

Once the mechanism opened the door automatically, what rushed out wasn't a musty smell, but a strange scent mixed with metal and medicinal herbs.

As he walked down the spiral stone steps, the rock walls on both sides gradually revealed the shocking truth of this Scripture Pavilion.

The so-called Scripture Pavilion was actually a space carved out of the mountain rock deep within the Heavenly Work Cave, with at least four floors of space.

Embedded in the rock layers were not only scrolls but also countless strange ores sealed in glass, and he could even see flowing magma rushing through transparent pipes embedded in the rock layers.

Glass?!

Xu Yun忍不住上前看了看，透明管道却没有发出丝毫清脆响声，反而带着一种沉闷的感觉。应当是某种矿石。这管道又有什么作用？

Xu Yunfan couldn't help but step forward to take a look. The transparent pipe didn't make any crisp sound; instead, it felt somewhat dull. It must be some kind of ore. What is the purpose of this pipe?

He continued walking until he reached the book consultation area of the Melting Gold Hall on the first floor, where he discovered there were still a few disciples inside flipping through and studying the books.

Looking at the bookshelves packed full of books, the fluorescent stones and the nearby magma illuminated the entire Scripture Pavilion as bright as day.

Xu Yunfan browsed slowly, then suddenly stopped, took the book in front of him, and traced his finger over the yellowed pages of "Earth Vein Ore Identification Classic," which recorded the basic ore identification essentials of the Melting Gold Hall.

He immediately found a seat and sat down.

"...The veins of red copper resemble earthworms; it coagulates frost when meeting cold. The veins of cold iron resemble torn silk; it sings like a dragon when tapped."

Reading this, Xu Yunfan suddenly slapped his thigh. The crisp sound was extremely clear in the quiet Scripture Pavilion, causing everyone to look over.

Xu Yunfan reacted instantly, quickly making an apologetic gesture in response.

When the crowd saw it was Xu Yunfan, the recently prominent True Disciple, they quelled their intentions. Although some wanted to strike up a conversation, they were hesitant and timid.

Back on the training grounds of the True Disciple Hall, the image of Xu Yunfan wielding a heavy hammer with a cold expression was still fresh in everyone's memory.

Xu Yunfan suddenly remembered when he was mining in Ninggu Tower, he had encountered this strange phenomenon several times. At the time, seeing that he couldn't dig through it, he changed directions a few times, only to realize later that it was actually red copper.

He thought back to the piles of meteoric iron next to the old master craftsman in the Casting Hall. It turns out the direction of the ore vein and the folds of the mountain body have such intricate connections.

*You carefully read the Earth Vein Ore Identification Classic and vaguely feel that the Heavenly Work Forging Technique seems to have been completed a bit.*

There's hope!

Xu Yunfan's spirit lifted. He put the book back and went to the Mechanism Hall area. When he pulled out "Essentials of a Thousand Mechanisms," a trembling sound from a mechanism hub came from underground.

Interesting.

Xu Yunfan looked at a mechanism under the "Essentials of a Thousand Mechanisms" on the bookshelf. It was precisely when the book was pulled out that the mechanism hub inside the rock wall made a noise.

It was clearly a clever design for this purpose.

On the yellowed diagram, the first Hall Master of the Mechanism Hall outlined the structure of a repeating crossbow with cinnabar.

*The gear meshing must be divided into seven layers; the tension of the string should be accumulated using a winch. Adding cold iron shavings to the quenching of the arrows can penetrate heavy armor.*

Xu Yunfan slowly flipped through the book. The further he went, the more complex "Essentials of a Thousand Mechanisms" became. The disciples of the Mechanism Hall had continuously studied and added to it over the generations. Until the appearance of the tiger-shaped mechanical beast three hundred years ago, Xu Yunfan finally opened his eyes.

On the deepest bronze bookshelf, the cover of "Essentials of Heavenly Work," a mandatory course for Heavenly Work Department disciples, had a delicate portrait of a human figure.

*...To build a wall, one must take soil from the back of a shady mountain, mix it with sticky rice pulp and oyster ash, and sprinkle rhinoceros blood during ramming to avoid insects and ants.*

Reading this, his gaze swept over the reinforced rock layer next to the magma pipe, and he finally understood why the Heavenly Work Cave hadn't collapsed after a hundred years.

It wasn't until dawn the next day that Xu Yunfan looked at the dozen or so prompts in his vision indicating that the Heavenly Work Forging Technique had been completed.

Xu Yunfan had asked the disciples of various halls. Apart from their martial arts, disciples of each hall had to specialize in these knowledge areas. Only after accumulating a certain level and passing the assessment would they be taught the essential techniques of their department.

Over the years, the martial arts of the various departments have basically been integrated into their professions.

The Melting Gold Hall's Melting Gold Forging Iron Art, the Mechanism Hall's Hundred Refinements Silk Winding Technique, and the Heavenly Work Department's Black Tortoise Carrying Mountain Strength are all learned while working.

"Learning by doing, right?"

When Xu Yunfan asked, a disciple of the Melting Gold Hall who was preparing to leave the Scripture Pavilion shouldered an extremely sturdy mining pick. As the disciple of the Melting Gold Hall's fingers moved, the pick emitted a series of mechanism clicks and quickly transformed into a long-handled mountain-opening broadsword.

The disciple of the Melting Gold Hall laughed and said, "Brother Xu might not know this, but the Melting Gold Forging Iron Art can only temper the body and strengthen the physique by constantly mining when going down into the mines. Over a long period of time, the metal element energy of the earth veins integrates into the flesh and blood, making the physique increasingly strong. It's no worse than the Casting Hall's Copper Body Art."

Getting excited, the disciple of the Melting Gold Hall even showed off his back to Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan: "..."

Then the next second, a steward of the Melting Gold Hall who rushed over gave him a knock on the head, while bowing and apologizing to Xu Yunfan, he quickly pulled the disciple away.

So that's how it is.

Xu Yunfan pondered this. It seems that if one wants to practice the complete Heavenly Work Forging Technique, they will likely have to learn all the martial arts of the four departments thoroughly before they can achieve success.

As Fu Jin said, the two words "Heavenly Work" encompass everything.

It's a rather grand project.

Xu Yunfan immediately gave up the idea. There's no rush for this matter. He'll wait until he completes Bone Refining before coming back to this. While practicing martial arts here, he'll take the time to read through these basics first.

He might as well treat it as grinding for a hidden achievement.

Xu Yunfan immediately set off for home, but turned around and entered the Scripture Pavilion again.

This time, he didn't stay long. He asked the elder on duty and learned that the martial arts collected and created by the Heavenly Work Cave over the generations were all on the third and fourth floors.

The core martial arts of each department were also included, but simply looking at them without actually practicing them yielded very little effect.

After a small half-day, Xu Yunfan once again borrowed a martial arts manual from the Scripture Pavilion, holding a borrowing slip stamped with Zhan Yan's seal.

Nine Profound Anti-Dragon Cudgel.

Although the method of using the cudgel isn't top-tier, not even quite reaching second-rate skills, the various basic force application techniques within it are extremely comprehensive. If practiced to perfection, with Nine Changes Return to Origin as the core, through the combined application of the nine basic force methods, it can easily split mountains and crack stones, achieving the effect of one cudgel breaking ten thousand laws.
