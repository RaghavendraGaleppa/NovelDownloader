# Chapter 54: The Mountain Turtle  

Upon hearing Tu Sheng's words, Han Yue immediately made a request:  

"Senior Tu, may I accompany you on this mission?"  

Tu Sheng pondered briefly before replying:  

"This time, I'm leading the expedition, and I won't rest until I slay at least one third-rank demon beast!"  

"Once the battle begins, I'll have no attention to spare for others."  

"If you can keep up with us, you're welcome to follow. But be warned—once the fighting starts, divine abilities are blind to friend or foe. You'll need to protect yourself!"  

Confident in his own escape skills, Han Yue nodded in agreement.  

With that, Tu Sheng summoned a massive sword, as wide as a door panel, which emitted a deep, resonant hum.  

In response, three second-rank swordsmen leaped out from the Qinglian Sect's base. These were all core disciples of the Qinglian Sword Sect, joining Tu Sheng on the mission.  

With a wave of his hand, Tu Sheng transformed into a colossal streak of light and shot into the distance. The three second-rank swordsmen followed suit, their own lights spiraling together in a formation.  

Initially, their speed was ordinary, but as they accelerated, they caught up to Tu Sheng's third-rank flight speed, keeping pace with him.  

This was the Qinglian Sword Sect's secret technique—the **Three-Phase Shifting Sword Formation**—which allowed three swordsmen to enhance each other's flight speed when moving in unison.  

It was also why Qinglian disciples often fought in groups of three during major battles.  

Han Yue gave a nod to Yang Fan, who lay resting on a magical artifact, then transformed into a golden streak of light and took off.  

His **Golden Light Flight Technique** was unmatched in this world when it came to speed.  

With absolute confidence in his movement abilities, Han Yue effortlessly kept up with the swordsmen, trailing closely behind.  

Yang Fan watched them depart, frustrated that his injuries prevented him from joining.  

The backlash from the **Shattered Jade Pendant** and the wounds from the great ape's attack had left him far worse off than Han Yue.  

Had his sect master not arrived in time with rare medicine to save him, his cultivation path might have been ruined.  

For now, all he could do was watch them leave.  

Yang Fan's unwavering stand against the third-rank demon beast had earned the Qinglian Sword Sect great prestige.  

Once he recovered and with the help of the **Jade Peach** obtained from Hu Le'er, he might even be promoted to a true disciple of the sect.  

Despite his injuries, his heart was at peace.  

Tu Sheng led the way, his aura unrestrained. The sheer force of his mana and the sonic boom of his flight echoed for miles.  

He had absolute confidence in his strength.  

As a long-standing true disciple and a chosen one of a major sect, ordinary third-rank demons were no match for him.  

---  

In the **Jade Sky Realm**, there had always been an ancient **Immortal Alliance Pact**—fourth-rank Immortal Ascendants would not casually slaughter lower-ranked cultivators from opposing factions.  

Even if they did act, they would focus on suppression and containment rather than outright killing.  

With fourth-rank experts unlikely to intervene, Tu Sheng, as the Qinglian Hall Master, armed with protective treasures, had no fear of any opponent he might face.  

Their flight was swift, covering thousands of miles in no time.  

Soon, the two groups of swordsmen split apart.  

The **Three-Phase Shifting Flight** had locked onto its target—a second-rank demon beast—and launched an attack.  

Their mission was to eliminate as many second-rank demons as possible.  

Meanwhile, Tu Sheng pressed deeper into the outer regions.  

Han Yue didn't hesitate—he continued following Tu Sheng.  

Having slain countless second-rank demons himself, he was far more interested in witnessing a battle at the third rank.  

After an unknown length of time, Han Yue had already consumed over ten percent of his **Golden Light Flight Technique**'s energy reserves.  

Suddenly, he saw Tu Sheng halt mid-air, his flight light dissipating.  

Han Yue immediately stopped as well.  

Then, guided by his battle sense, Tu Sheng swung his massive sword in a devastating slash toward a towering mountain ahead.  

The colossal blade, as heavy as it was swift, struck the mountain with thunderous force.  

The impact shook heaven and earth, sending tremors through the land.  

A deafening roar erupted from the mountain itself.  

To Han Yue's astonishment, the thousand-meter-tall mountain suddenly **came to life**.  

The peak shuddered violently, trees and boulders tumbling down its slopes.  

Then, a head, limbs, and a tail emerged—revealing a **mountain-sized demon turtle**!  

The beast had clearly been slumbering for ages, only to be rudely awakened by Tu Sheng's strike.  

The turtle's head alone was as large as a small hill, its two yellowed eyes the size of houses glaring furiously.  

With a thunderous bellow, it unleashed a shockwave that rippled for miles, stirring violent winds.  

Yet Tu Sheng remained unfazed.  

His massive sword, after striking the turtle, rebounded with even greater speed, returning to his side.  

The moment man and blade connected, they separated again—each time faster than before.  

The sword shot back toward the turtle, then returned once more, repeating the cycle.  

Like a ricocheting bullet, the blade bounced between Tu Sheng and the turtle, gaining speed and power with each pass.  

If the first strike had been akin to a wooden pole tapping the beast, after dozens of repetitions, the force had escalated to that of a warhammer.  

The world knew of Tu Sheng, the **Blunt Edge Sword**, Hall Master of the Qinglian Sect's Zhenyuan Hall.  

Among third-rank cultivators, his sword momentum was unrivaled—once engaged, prolonged battle was fatal.  

His unique combat style was now on full display.  

This was the result of his innate divine ability—**Momentum Borrowing**—combined with the **Abyssal Heavy Sword**, the artifact he had nurtured since his second-rank days.  

Originally an unremarkable ability, **Momentum Borrowing** had been refined by Tu Sheng over the years.  

Upon reaching the third rank, he elevated it to a **peerless divine ability**.  

At this level, **Momentum Borrowing** allowed the **Abyssal Heavy Sword** to absorb a fraction of the rebound force from each strike, stacking it into the next attack.  

This compounding effect made every subsequent slash more devastating than the last.  

Once Tu Sheng's momentum built up, his sword's power became unstoppable—until it finally shattered his foe, releasing all accumulated force in one cataclysmic strike.  

Enemies familiar with Tu Sheng would do everything to disrupt his momentum buildup.  

But this slumbering giant turtle had no such knowledge.  

At first, it shrugged off the **Abyssal Heavy Sword**'s strikes with its impenetrable shell.  

Yet soon, it realized the once-negligible blows were growing heavier and heavier.  

At this rate, even its legendary defense would crumble.  

The turtle refused to wait for death.  

Seeing the danger, it activated its divine ability—**Mountain Shifting**—and hurled an entire peak straight at Tu Sheng!
