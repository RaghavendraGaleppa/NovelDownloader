Chapter 208: Fusion

Zhou Tian felt a premonition and extended his palm. The Buddhist Wheel gently landed in his hand, appearing as if crafted from glazed glass, with runes flowing within it.

“This is my Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death; it can be considered a decent treasure and isn’t embarrassing to take out,” Wutian remarked, a hint of emotion in his gaze as he looked at the Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death.

Zhou Tian’s consciousness delved into it. Almost instantly, with the cooperation of the Yin-Yang Wheel, he gained initial control. As for deeper applications, he would need to spend more time nurturing and cultivating it. The Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death floated behind Zhou Tian’s head, emitting a divine glow that made him appear like a deity.

“I told you, what difference does the World Creation, World Destruction Sword make? My body is the relic shed from the human skin book, inherently special. What use is your life-bursting strike?” At this moment, the blood mist began to retract, eventually reforming into the relic form. However, its aura was noticeably weaker, and its body had withered considerably, having been used to mend its injuries.

Wutian gently extended two fingers, pressing them together. “World Creation, World Destruction!”

A torrent of sword qi descended once more, turning the opposing relic into a mass of blood mist. However, Wutian’s fingers—more accurately, Saint Devil’s fingers—emitted a cracking sound, twisting into an odd angle that made Zhou Tian wince in pain just by looking.

“The body is too weak,” Wutian sighed. The World Creation, World Destruction Sword he had just unleashed was even weaker than the one Puzhi had unleashed, simply because Saint Devil’s body was too fragile, prone to damage with even a slight exertion of force.

“Senior, take it easy. That’s my little brother’s body; don’t break it,” Zhou Tian couldn’t help but remonstrate, his own fingers aching just watching.

“Don’t worry, I have a sense of proportion,” Wutian replied calmly. His fingers cracked once more, returning to their original state. He then formed a strange hand seal, and a phantom figure, like a god and a demon, emerged behind him—it was Wutian’s own likeness. From Wutian’s phantom, strands of blood-colored runes emerged, heading towards the three relics.

“Wutian, what are you doing!”

“Wutian, you’re courting death!”

“Wutian, stop!”

All three relics roared in unison, filled with boundless rage.

“What are you yelling about!” Zhou Tian retorted, grabbing the Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death from behind his head and savagely smashing it onto the relic he was fighting. It nearly shattered its body, causing blood mist to permeate the air as it struggled to repair itself.

“He’s making you die! You have no idea how strong we three relics will be once we thoroughly merge!” The relic, realizing it couldn’t escape, began to try and incite Zhou Tian.

“No need for your concern, I can still hold on,” Zhou Tian said calmly. This was too fake; why would it suddenly care about him?

“Can you hold on? You’ll understand then, no one can hold on!” The human skin relic grew hysterical, seeing that it couldn’t shake off Zhou Tian.

The other two relics simultaneously charged towards Wutian, not even taking the opportunity to help the Book of Burials. They understood that not helping the Book of Burials now would only lead to their eventual dissipation after the book was refined, but not stopping Wutian now would mean their immediate demise. Blood-colored runes emanating from Wutian formed chains, connecting to the three relics.

*Bang!*

Wutian was sent flying by one of the relics, spitting out a large mouthful of blood. Yet, the hand seals he formed became faster and faster, his eyes漠然, as if he paid no mind to these relics whatsoever.

Seeing this, Zhou Tian narrowed his eyes, struck out with his Buddha Palm, summoned ten thousand feet of chaotic lightning, and finally pressed down the Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death, firmly suppressing the relic that had blocked him.

His figure vanished.

*Bang!*

A gleaming golden fist smashed heavily into another relic that had attempted to attack Wutian.

“That’s my little brother’s body; not just anyone can touch it!” Zhou Tian bellowed. His fist, like a meteor wrapped in golden lightning, struck the relic squarely.

But that was all he could do; he could only temporarily restrain this one. As for the relic that was overwhelming Wutian, he had no means of dealing with it. More and more blood-colored runes appeared, and the rune chains grew thicker, shimmering with a sanguine glow! Saint Devil’s body was covered in wounds; if not for Wutian’s Grand Dao runes protecting him, his body would have long been obliterated. However, the power of a single relic was, in the end, limited, and Wutian managed to endure.

“Merge!” Wutian finally formed a hand seal and roared fiercely.

“No!” The relic that had just sent the Yin-Yang Wheel of Life and Death flying let out a desperate cry.

*Whoosh!*

The blood-colored rune chains tautened, pulling the three relics towards a single point. Endless blood mist erupted; all the relics tried to break free, but all the unleashed blood mist was instead absorbed by the blood-colored rune chains, coalescing into a mass of sanguine substance at their nexus.

“Everyone must die, everyone will die!”

“This place will be destroyed, no one can escape!”

“You will regret this!”

The three relics uttered their most malevolent curses, dragged together, enveloped by the blood-colored substance, poised to birth some ultimate evil.

“Junior, the power of my remnant soul has reached its limit. Once the Book of Burials is refined, you will naturally find the way out.”

“Senior, do you have any more good stuff hidden away? It’s just sitting there, why not give it to me?” Zhou Tian hastily asked, seeing Wutian about to dissipate, unwilling to let some treasures be lost to time.

“None left. Almost everything shattered in the last battle,” Wutian gave Zhou Tian a speechless look. “Also, I’ll give you a piece of advice: some ancient forces in the Star Realm have their own designs on it. I don’t know the specifics, but you must be extremely careful. Their ambitions are vast, and in the end, everyone might just be a sacrifice, except for themselves.”

Wutian’s figure became translucent, and a message resonated in Zhou Tian’s mind, not through divine sense communication, but by a more secretive means. Finally, he gazed in the direction where Puzhi had dissipated, his eyes growing distant, seemingly lost in thought. This was an unimaginable sight, as Heavenly Venerates were always incredibly resolute, rarely experiencing confusion.

“Alas… you should have left.” With a final soft sigh, the expert who had dominated an era vanished. Few remembered him; in the records of the Buddhist Realm, he was merely a Buddha at the half-step Heavenly Venerate realm.

Saint Devil’s body plummeted downwards. Zhou Tian waved his hand, lifting it up and rousing Saint Devil from unconsciousness.

“Hiss…” Saint Devil groaned the moment consciousness returned, then let out a painful moan, slowly opening his eyes to look at Zhou Tian.

“That old fellow is gone?” Zhou Tian asked with a schadenfrefreude-filled smile.

“Gone, completely dissipated.”

“He really knew how to use me. My body is practically shattered.” Saint Devil pulled out a pile of bottles and jars, chugging their contents. His body radiated light, rapidly repairing itself.

“Still, he had a bit of conscience; he left me a few great divine abilities,” Saint Devil said, a mixture of pain and pleasure in his voice.
