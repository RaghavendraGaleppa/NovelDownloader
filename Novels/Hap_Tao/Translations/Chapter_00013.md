# Chapter 13: The Arrogance of Youth  

"Qin Ziling, don't think you're impressive just because you lasted this long against me today! You're nothing but a poor brat who only knows how to train his muscles and bones. You'll never reach the Membrane Realm in your lifetime, let alone the Strength Realm. If I really wanted to deal with you, I wouldn't even need to lift a finger myself. But out of respect for our shared time at the same martial arts school, here's my offer: tomorrow at noon, when the master goes to dine in the inner hall, you kneel before me in front of all the apprentices and fellow disciples and admit your wrongdoing. If you do that, I might consider letting you off. Otherwise, you'll suffer for it later," said Nangong Yue.  

"Nangong Yue, I know you're targeting me because I once had feelings for Luo Yukē. But that's all in the past. We're both disciples of the same master—why make things so unpleasant?" Qin Ziling replied.  

"Hah! As if someone like you has the right to talk to me about 'unpleasantness'? So, are you going to kneel or not?" Nangong Yue sneered, looking down on him with disdain.  

"Nangong Yue, grudges are better resolved than held. I don’t like trouble, and since you're technically the master’s disciple, I don’t want to make an enemy of you. But if you keep pushing me, then we’ll just have to see how things play out!" Qin Ziling said calmly, though a cold, ruthless glint briefly flashed in the depths of his eyes.  

Seeing Qin Ziling remain so composed from start to finish, Nangong Yue felt an inexplicable chill. But when he realized it, it only fueled his anger.  

"Hmph, we’ll see then!" Nangong Yue snapped, abruptly lowering the carriage curtain.  

As he watched the carriage disappear into the distance, Qin Ziling curled his lips into a cold smile and muttered to himself, "The arrogance of youth! Don’t they know that the deadliest snakes always lurk in the shadows?"  

Then, his footsteps suddenly halted, and his expression turned bewildered.  

Since when had he become so cunning and ruthless?  

"It must be the influence of that old demon," Qin Ziling thought with a bitter chuckle. Though he had no desire to become a scheming, cruel person, he couldn’t deny that merging with the remnants of the old demon’s soul had subtly altered his personality.  

Once outside the city gates, Qin Ziling gazed at the vast Wuyang Mountain Range, which stretched endlessly, nearly encircling half the prefectural city. His eyes narrowed in contemplation.  

Legend had it that the Wuyang Mountains extended all the way from the prefectural city to the capital of Xiyun Province, making it one of the eighteen great mountain ranges of the Great Qi Kingdom.  

With towering peaks and dense forests, the mountains teemed not only with ordinary beasts and birds but also with exotic creatures in its deeper reaches.  

These exotic creatures were said to be descendants of ancient divine beasts and mythical birds that had long vanished from history, having interbred with ordinary animals. Unlike their legendary ancestors, these hybrids were far from intelligent—some even struggled to develop basic awareness compared to normal animals.  

While ordinary beasts might occasionally gain sentience through rare opportunities, even cultivating into demons, the descendants of divine beasts and mythical birds could only awaken their intelligence under extraordinary circumstances.  

Over generations of breeding and countless cross-species unions, these creatures had evolved into a variety of hybrid beasts, each carrying a trace of their divine ancestors' bloodline.  

Because of this divine heritage, their flesh and blood were highly prized by martial artists as potent supplements. Some even had body parts that served as excellent materials for crafting elixirs or weapons.  

However, their divine lineage also made them innately powerful and ferocious. Even Strength Realm martial masters dared not venture alone into the depths of the Wuyang Mountains to hunt them.  

Typically, only groups of three to five martial masters would dare to operate on the outskirts where weaker exotic creatures roamed, avoiding the truly perilous territories inhabited by the more formidable beasts.  

As a result, exotic creatures had always been rare and valuable commodities, affordable only to wealthy families and noble clans. Even among them, only the most favored heirs had the privilege of consuming their flesh.  

"They say that aside from the few domesticated breeds, even the weakest exotic creatures are comparable to Strength Realm martial masters. Right now, I’ve only subdued a single bronze corpse, and my control range is limited to about ten meters. It’s too soon to think about hunting exotic creatures. But since I can now barely manipulate objects with my soul and control the bronze corpse at close range, it shouldn’t be too dangerous to hunt ordinary beasts in the outer reaches or smaller branches of the Wuyang Mountains."  

After a long moment of contemplation, Qin Ziling withdrew his gaze from the towering mountains and strode toward Anhe Village.  

Anhe Village was surrounded by water on all sides. The rivers not only irrigated the fields but also served as a natural moat in these troubled times.  

Unlike single-surname villages, Anhe was a mixed community—a legacy of Fangsuo Prefecture’s past as a frontier region during the previous dynasty. The constant military presence had brought soldiers and their families from all over the country.  

Though the Great Qi Kingdom later expanded its borders, removing Fangsuo from the frontier, many soldiers and their descendants had already settled, becoming locals.  

Anhe Village was home to many such descendants, resulting in a diverse population without a dominant clan. Instead, a few wealthy landowners, relying on their abundant fields and hired guards, held considerable influence in the village.  

As a widow with an only son, Cui Shi’s family was naturally among the weaker households in Anhe.  

Fortunately, Cui Shi was well-mannered and dignified, maintaining good relations with her neighbors. Qin Ziling’s late grandfather had also once held considerable prestige in the village, and with Qin Ziling training at a martial arts school in the city—growing stronger with age—no one dared to bully the Qin family without reason.  

But today was an exception.  

Before Qin Ziling even reached his doorstep, he saw Yin Ranyue running toward him in a panic, her face pale and her hair and clothes disheveled.  

Not far behind her, two young masters in fine silk robes strolled leisurely, flanked by six servants. They fanned themselves with paper fans, chatting and laughing as if enjoying a casual outing.  

One of the young masters was notably obese, his flesh jiggling with every step. The other was tall and well-built but had a face covered in pockmarks, a hooked nose, and a twisted mouth, giving him a sinister and arrogant air.  

Qin Ziling recognized the obese one—Cao Angao, the son of Cao Zhengbin, a wealthy landowner from the eastern part of Anhe Village.  

Two years ago, Cao Angao’s sister had caught the eye of Xu Yuanwu, the young master of Xu Fort, and became his concubine. Last year, she bore him a son, elevating the Cao family’s status. Now, they swaggered through the village, looking down on everyone.  

The other young master, however, Qin Ziling did not recognize.
