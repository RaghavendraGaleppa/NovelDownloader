# Chapter 28: Spirit-Devouring Sky Ants

At this moment, the queen ant's aura suddenly began to surge wildly. In just the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, it grew from having no spiritual energy at all to reaching the late first-stage level.

Its body also expanded two or three times in size, now measuring over half a foot long. The queen then proceeded to devour the original honeycomb in just a few bites.

Seeing this, Qin Chong activated his spiritual sense and transferred it into the spirit beast pouch. The next step was to wait for the queen to build a nest and lay eggs, which would then hatch into worker ants. Only then could he determine the species of this queen ant.

With this matter settled, Qin Chong finally relaxed.

His daily routine now consisted of searching for scattered mineral veins to continue mining spirit stones. With over two years still to endure, he could only hope the ants would hatch soon. If they could consume the Spirit-Protecting Barrier like the queen did, it would be a tremendous help.

As for their combat effectiveness? That would have to be tested later.

After fully recovering his magic power, Qin Chong resumed his search for mining spots.

The tunnels dug by the Armored Earth Beast that day still had many unexplored areas, so he had to investigate them one by one, hoping to find remnants of new mineral veins.

Before he knew it, over half a year had passed. Qin Chong had harvested quite a few spirit stones during this time, but to aid his cultivation, he still needed to purchase a bottle of Qi-Gathering Pills from the trading fair every now and then.

Pills were highly sought-after here, with each one costing seven or eight spirit stones more than in Pingyang City—nearly sixty spirit stones per pill. A single bottle set him back over five hundred spirit stones.

Even so, Qin Chong had managed to save nearly two thousand spirit stones in this past year—a considerable haul for a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator.

With the help of the pills, Qin Chong's cultivation had also reached the peak of the sixth layer of Qi Refinement. One day, while at a newly discovered mining spot, he set up the Five Elements Concealment Array and began attempting to break through to the late-stage bottleneck.

In his hand was a light blue pill—the Harmony Qi Pill he had obtained back at Little Cang Mountain. Now was the perfect time to use it. After gazing at it for a moment, Qin Chong swallowed the pill.

Several days later, Qin Chong's aura surged dramatically as he finally advanced to the late stage of Qi Refinement.

Upon reaching the seventh layer, his spiritual sense had also strengthened considerably. He could now detect objects over a hundred zhang away, and manipulating his top-grade magic artifact, the Four Symbols Rotating Spear, became much smoother.

The only downside was that separating the spear's four heads still felt somewhat strenuous. Nevertheless, the weapon's power was already formidable.

After stabilizing his cultivation, Qin Chong resumed mining spirit stones.

Suddenly, a disturbance came from his spirit beast pouch. He immediately set down his tools and focused his attention inside.

After more than half a year, the eggs laid by the queen ant had finally begun to hatch.

Inside the pouch floated a circular nest about half a zhang in size, rebuilt by the queen. The gray nest was now covered in dense black dots.

The hatched ants had golden heads and black bodies, each about the size of a pinky finger, crawling all over the nest in swarms. Anyone with trypophobia would have fainted at the sight.

From their appearance, they closely resembled Spirit-Devouring Sky Ants—an extremely rare type of spirit insect. However, the golden heads seemed slightly unusual.

Qin Chong didn't dwell on it further. Given his current cultivation level, there were still many texts and records beyond his access. He could study them later when the opportunity arose.

Now was the time to test these flying ants' capabilities.

Following Qin Chong's command, a black cloud of ants surged out of the spirit beast pouch, completely covering a large section of the nearby Spirit-Protecting Barrier in darkness.

A cacophony of gnawing and crunching sounds erupted, so shrill that Qin Chong felt his bones might shatter.

The ants were devouring the barrier at an astonishing rate. In just the time it takes to drink tea, they had cleared an area two to three zhang wide.

Had Qin Chong not ordered them to stop, even the outermost layer of spirit stones would have been consumed.

This gave him an idea: if the ants could eat through the barrier, perhaps they could also clean impurities from spirit stones?

He tested this with a few tainted stones, but the results left him dumbfounded. Even when he commanded the queen to release only a few ants, by the time he called them off, the stones were reduced to half their original size.

These little creatures seemed unable to resist the allure of spirit stones. Resigned, Qin Chong abandoned the idea. Being able to clear the barrier effortlessly was already a huge boon.

Greed knows no bounds. Not every advantage could fall into his lap. After all, Rome wasn't built in a day—he would take things slowly.

With this new ability, his mining efficiency would skyrocket. As long as he found more mining spots, he could continue submitting the usual quota while secretly hoarding extra spirit stones.

However, feeding the flying ants posed another challenge. Using spirit stones was out of the question—he could never afford that.

But with two years left in the mine, he could let them feed on the barrier while underground and use defective spirit stones aboveground. He had collected plenty of those by now.

He had originally planned to evolve them in the Bagua space, but that idea was now shelved.

One day, over half a year later, while searching for new mining spots in increasingly deeper and harder-to-find areas, Qin Chong suddenly detected a faint aura.

He tensed and immediately concealed himself, puzzled.

Could it be a fellow miner? But the tunnels here were a labyrinth—it might still be one of his own.

Soon, an Armored Earth Beast appeared within his sensory range. This one was different from the last—its aura was stronger, at the mid first-stage level.

This time, Qin Chong planned to strike swiftly and capture it alive.

With his seventh-layer Qi Refinement cultivation, subduing the beast shouldn't be difficult.

Just as he was about to act, another aura reached him—this time from a sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. Qin Chong immediately halted.

The man soon appeared not far from Qin Chong, and it became clear the Armored Earth Beast was his pet.

"You wretched beast! I told you to slow down, but you kept digging ahead recklessly. Now look where we are—completely lost!"

"Screech! Screech!" The beast let out a few cries.

"Fellow Daoist, you might as well show yourself. Your concealment technique may have fooled me, but not this Armored Earth Beast."

The beast had detected him? Reluctantly, Qin Chong revealed himself.

"My apologies. I was merely passing by."

Though unsure if the man was friend or foe, Qin Chong preferred to avoid trouble.

"A mere third-layer Qi Refinement cultivator dares to come here? Prepare to die!"

The man attacked without hesitation, catching Qin Chong off guard. This suggested he wasn't from their mining group.
