# Chapter 28: Traces

Ten days passed in a flash. Chen Fei tried to avoid Zhang Yuezhen during the day. After refining five batches of Qi-Blood Pills, Chen Fei would begin cultivating the Startling Suspension Art.

The Startling Suspension Art was already close to Grand Completion. Chen Fei had diligently practiced it recently, and now, it had finally reached Grand Completion.

Inside the alchemy room, Chen Fei slowly opened his eyes and exhaled a turbid breath.

"Compared to the original Wind Suspension Breathing Technique, the Startling Suspension Art alone now grants 17 cultivation points daily, nearly double." Chen Fei murmured softly. This was just by merging the 'Startling' incantation. What if he had the complete Startling Thunder Sword Art?

Chen Fei swallowed. He wondered if those dozens of fake Startling Thunder Sword Art manuals could offer him any surprises. However, he didn't have time to deal with those secret manuals right now, as he still had sword techniques to merge.

"Whoosh..." A sudden clamor erupted from outside the medical hall, mixed with a bustling crowd. Chen Fei, feeling a bit curious, walked out of the alchemy room and saw refugees passing by the entrance.

Chen Fei's brows furrowed slightly. These refugees could enter the city now? Previously, Pingyin County's yamen had prohibited these refugees from entering the city, fearing they would disrupt the stability of the entire county. Only hired refugees were allowed through the city gates.

The eerie appearance of the phenomenon added another layer of urgency for Chen Fei. For now, the strange occurrences couldn't breach the city walls, but who knew what the future held?

Pingyin County that night was more boisterous than usual. From time to time, Chen Fei could hear various noises from afar.

The next morning, upon arriving at the medical hall, Chen Fei saw everyone whispering to each other. Clearly, something else had happened.

"Nineteen people died in the city last night?" Chen Fei looked at Liu Jun with some surprise. Although he had anticipated a restless night, he hadn't expected so many deaths.

"There were refugees and also city residents. In one wealthy household, seven people were killed. The others were spared only after voluntarily offering up silver." Liu Jun said, his voice laced with fear.

Chen Fei's brows furrowed deeply. Those refugees shouldn't have such strength. Wealthy families typically hired guards. If refugees could defeat the guards, they would have already entered the city to work, not waited until now.

"Could it be those bandits, disguised as refugees, returning again?" The images of Jian Liang and his gang involuntarily surfaced in Chen Fei's mind. If that were truly the case, then Pingyin County would truly be unable to find peace in the coming days.

With so many refugees, the yamen officials wouldn't be able to distinguish between bandits and ordinary civilians.

"It's that gang of bandits!"

Stopping in front of a stall, Chen Fei pretended to browse for items, but his attention was focused on his right.

In the black market, most people concealed their true identities. That bandit was no exception; they had even used disguise techniques.

However, this disguise was likely applied by someone else for the bandit. Chen Fei's disguise technique had long reached Grand Completion, so he easily spotted the flaws.

The most crucial point was that Chen Fei had a deep impression of this bandit, because it was he who had kicked and broken Pu Liao's leg after capturing him. At the time, Chen Fei had unconsciously taken a few extra glances at the bandit, thus remembering him.

"They truly came. Last night's incident was, in all likelihood, their doing."
