# Chapter 562: The Sect Master of the Primordial Sect

‘You have successfully slain a Late Foundation Establishment cultivator.’

‘Your proficiency in the Divine Pavilion Nine Sovereigns Mystic Firmament Immortal Sutra has greatly increased.’

‘Your proficiency in the Dao of Formations has increased significantly.’

‘You…’

The attribute panel in his vision was nearly scrolling with notifications.

His battle with Blood Elder Devil had advanced many of the true scriptures on Xu Yunfan’s technique bar by a great step. In particular, the Divine Pavilion Nine Sovereigns Mystic Firmament Immortal Sutra had increased its proficiency by a full hundred points, saving him ten years of bitter cultivation and adding ten years of cultivation depth.

Suppressing the roiling qi and blood in his heart and enduring the weakness brought by the immense expenditure, Xu Yunfan simultaneously devoured the world’s vital essence to replenish his depleted spiritual power. At the same time, he used his spiritual will to command the residual power of the great formation, quietly concealing the dark golden pellet floating in mid-air.

Only after everything was concealed did he finally relax. This great formation had cost him a great deal of effort and naturally had the effect of obscuring causality and heavenly secrets, precisely to prevent those Foundation Establishment True Lords from having a voyeuristic tendency.

Xu Yunfan carefully examined the dark golden pellet the size of a dragon’s eye in his hand, and his heart trembled even more.

Within it was a trace of immortal golden intent. This trace of golden nature was no small matter; it was the signature characteristic of a Great True Lord at the peak of Foundation Establishment.

A trace of immortal intent refined from one’s own Dao Foundation or nascent洞天 (Cave Heaven).

This meant that Blood Elder Devil’s accumulation of cultivation had already reached the peak of Late Foundation Establishment. He was truly just one epiphany or opportunity away from the realm of a Great True Lord, a state of perfect and unobstructed mastery.

“How dangerous… Fortunately, his Five Defilements clouded his heart, and he was blinded by someone, leaving too many flaws in his haste. He completely lost his mind. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have been able to seize such a great opportunity.”

Even Golden Core True Lords still had a lifespan limit. Even a Golden Core Great True Lord at the peak would have a lifespan limit of no more than five thousand years.

However, with this condensed immortal golden nature, one could reincarnate infinitely within the Taihua Spirit Void Realm without fear of attrition.

This was the most important characteristic that allowed one to be called a True Lord.

Xu Yunfan’s thoughts raced.

“This object is the essence of Blood Elder Devil’s five lifetimes of accumulation, and it has even剥离 (stripped) a trace of先天金性 (先天 golden nature). It is of great benefit to me in stabilizing my nascent Cave Heaven, impacting Late Foundation Establishment, and even peering into the realm of perfection.”

If he could use this to refine a trace of golden nature, he would immediately be elevated to a Great True Lord at the peak of Foundation Establishment.

He was just pondering how to utilize this item when his spiritual senses suddenly issued a warning. He sensed two vast, abyssal spiritual wills crossing space and descending upon the peak of the Divine Pavilion.

Two Great True Lords at the peak of Foundation Establishment?!

Within the Primordial Sect, those who could reach the peak of Foundation Establishment could be counted on one hand.

Xu Yunfan dared not be negligent and immediately drew the dark golden pellet deep into his Spatial Bag. He looked up.

He saw the void ahead ripple like water, and two figures appeared almost simultaneously.

The person on the left wore a dark purple robe with star patterns. His face was ancient and simple, and his eyes were deep, as if containing endless galaxies. The qi around his body was round and complete. Though he did not deliberately release it, he naturally drew the surrounding world’s spiritual energy to submit to him, like water droplets converging into a sea.

This was the current Sect Master of the Primordial Sect, the representative of True Lord Pudu, the Great True Lord at the peak of Foundation Establishment who managed the sect’s secular affairs—True Lord Tianyan.

The person on the right wore a simple green robe, with a sharp and inquisitive air between his eyebrows. His aura, though not as vast and boundless as True Lord Tianyan’s, was as solid and heavy as the mountains of the earth, his edge concealed.

This was the chief disciple under True Lord Qingyuan, Xu Yunfan’s nominal direct superior, and also a Great True Lord at the peak of Foundation Establishment—Lu Chuan.

The two Great True Lords had arrived together.

Xu Yunfan’s heart relaxed slightly. If it had only been True Lord Tianyan who came, Xu Yunfan would have been much more solemn.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, suppressed his roiling qi and blood, and bowed respectfully to the two of them. His posture was proper, neither humble nor arrogant.

“Disciple Xu Yunfan greets the Sect Master True Lord and Senior Brother Lu Chuan.”

He addressed Tianyan as ‘Sect Master True Lord’ out of respect for his position, and called Lu Chuan ‘Senior Brother’ to clarify his allegiance to True Lord Qingyuan’s faction.

Logically, with his own faction’s big shot present to back him up, he naturally couldn’t make them lose face.

Lu Chuan’s gaze toward Xu Yunfan was filled with undisguised surprise and inquiry, even mixed with a hint of delight.

The astonishing battle just now had been witnessed by him in its entirety.

Using the strength of Mid Foundation Establishment to counter-attack and slay a Late Foundation Establishment old devil who had been cultivating for many years. Furthermore, when the opponent intended to self-detonate his Dao Foundation and destroy everything, Xu Yunfan combined formations with the secret methods of a true scripture and forcefully refined the devil into a pellet.

He possessed an immeasurable talent in the Dao of Formations.

He was a talent!

Lu Chuan sighed with emotion in his heart. His intention to befriend Xu Yunfan became much more serious, with less casual indifference.

A master of formations might be needed one day.

Xu Yunfan’s methods, his ruthless and precise decisiveness in the face of opportunity, and the arrangement that even Lu Chuan found stunning and admirable—the “Nine Heavens Pavilion Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Formation”—was enough to make Lu Chuan elevate Xu Yunfan’s status in his heart to an infinite height.

This child’s future was limitless.

For the Qingyuan faction to have such a junior was truly a great blessing.

But for me, it is somewhat of a threat.

What if one day True Lord Qingyuan favors him and neglects me?

Lu Chuan felt a bit troubled in his heart, but he didn’t dwell on it too much.

It was the same old saying: a master of formations might be needed one day. Whether it was for his own tribulation crossing, or for arranging the sect’s protective great formations, or creating man-made treasure lands, there were simply too many uses.

His thoughts turned, and Lu Chuan couldn’t help but add a bit of a smile and seriousness to his face.

Seeing the increased warmth and smile on Lu Chuan’s face, Xu Yunfan naturally understood the reason and couldn’t help but sigh again.

The people of the Primordial Sect were indeed pragmatic!

True Lord Tianyan’s gaze calmly swept over Xu Yunfan, then passed over the ruined but not fundamentally damaged Divine Pavilion Peak below, and the disciples on the peak who, though pale, were filled with excitement and fanatical worship for their Peak Master after surviving a calamity. Finally, it fixed on Xu Yunfan’s face, which looked slightly tired but contained a vigorous spirit within.

“Xu Yunfan.”

True Lord Tianyan spoke. His voice was flat, but carried an invisible pressure. Each word was clear, falling into Xu Yunfan’s ears and the spiritual wills of all who were paying attention.

“The rules of the Primordial Sect forbid fellow disciples from harming each other. This is the cornerstone of the sect’s maintenance. Especially in this place, under the watchful eyes of all, even if there was a reason, this is a great taboo.”

This statement seemed to pass judgment, pointing out the fact that Xu Yunfan had “broken a taboo.”

His tone was indifferent, and one could not tell if he was pleased or angry, which only increased the pressure.

Beside him, True Lord Lu Chuan stood with his hands in his sleeves, looking as if he were an uninvolved party. He watched his nose, and his nose watched his heart, as if it had nothing to do with him. He made no comment on the Sect Master’s words and remained silent.

Xu Yunfan’s heart was as clear as ice.

True Lord Tianyan represented the faction of True Lord Pudu, whose duty was to maintain the superficial order of the sect.

His words were both a statement of the rules and a message to the other factions.

However, Senior Brother Lu Chuan’s silence, along with the undisguised approval in his eyes just now, was the greatest support.

The arrival of this direct superior was itself a silent backing, indicating the attitude of the True Lord Qingyuan’s faction on this matter—they firmly supported their capable and resilient Foundation Establishment “Red Banner.”
