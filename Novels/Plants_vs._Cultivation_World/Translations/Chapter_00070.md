# Chapter 70: Becoming an Official Spirit Planter  

Under the infusion of spiritual energy, the new spirit plant before him grew rapidly, forming ears, blooming, and finally reaching full maturity. Gu Mo reached out and plucked the heavy ear of rice.  

The ear still belonged to the Spirit Jade Rice, but compared to ordinary Spirit Jade Rice, this hybridized version—fused with Water Spirit Rice—appeared plumper and contained even richer spiritual energy.  

Gu Mo estimated that this new strain of Spirit Jade Rice had likely reached the mid-grade level of the first tier.  

Losing a high-grade first-tier Water Spirit Rice plant in exchange for a mid-grade first-tier Spirit Jade Rice was undoubtedly a failure in terms of fusion.  

However, as the first creation of Gu Mo's journey to becoming an official Spirit Planter, it was still a success.  

It was akin to an alchemist using high-grade herbs to refine a mid-grade pill. While the refinement itself might be considered a failure, the mid-grade pill was proof enough that the alchemist had mastered the basics.  

Now, all Gu Mo needed to do was register with the sect to officially become the third first-tier Spirit Planter of the Qinglu Sect.  

Only a little over a month had passed since the Spirit Planter Elder's lecture. Gu Mo wasn't sure if his progress would be enough to catch the elder's attention and earn him the chance to become a disciple.  

The thought of the second-tier spirit fields on the elder's spiritual peak made Gu Mo eager. With that in mind, he immediately set off for the Spirit Planting Hall.  

As an outer disciple, Gu Mo didn’t have the privilege to directly request an audience with a Golden Core Elder. To register as a Spirit Planter, he had to go through the Spirit Planting Hall.  

While he couldn’t meet the Golden Core Elder, gaining an audience with Zhao Qiancheng, the hall’s steward, was now an easy task.  

"Have you encountered any difficulties?" Zhao Qiancheng asked, looking at Gu Mo.  

Gu Mo was now the treasure of the Spirit Planting Hall—and Zhao Qiancheng’s lucky star. Ever since Gu Mo successfully cultivated Water Spirit Rice, Zhao’s reputation within the sect had risen steadily, and the resources allocated to him had increased significantly.  

"Steward Zhao, I’ve come to register as an official Spirit Planter," Gu Mo said with a respectful bow.  

"What? You’ve become a Spirit Planter?"  

For a moment, Zhao Qiancheng was stunned—the term "Spirit Planter" was still unfamiliar to him. But he quickly regained his composure, stepping forward with an expression of disbelief.  

Gu Mo had only attended the Spirit Planter Elder’s lecture a little over a month ago. Mastering the basics in such a short time was astonishing.  

The two previous Spirit Planters who had emerged from the hall had taken at least two years to barely qualify. Gu Mo had done it in just one month.  

"Do you have proof?" Zhao Qiancheng asked seriously.  

In response, Gu Mo presented the newly fused plant. Though Zhao Qiancheng wasn’t a Spirit Planter himself, his expertise as a senior spirit farmer allowed him to recognize the hybrid characteristics of Water Spirit Rice and Spirit Jade Rice—a clear sign of a Spirit Planter’s ability.  

"Excellent!"  

With tangible proof, Gu Mo’s status as an official Spirit Planter was all but confirmed.  

Without delay, Zhao Qiancheng submitted the news along with Gu Mo’s application for outer sect disciple status. Originally, Zhao had planned to wait until Gu Mo stabilized his Water Spirit Rice production before submitting the application. But now that Gu Mo had become a Spirit Planter, there was no need to wait.  

If Gu Mo’s spiritual root talent had been slightly better, he might even have had a chance at becoming an inner disciple.  

Mastering Spirit Planting in just over a month—such talent suggested potential for reaching the second tier. However, whether as a second-tier Spirit Planter, alchemist, or artificer, one needed corresponding cultivation levels to control higher-tier spirit plants.  

And Gu Mo’s inferior spiritual roots would be the greatest obstacle to his advancement to Foundation Establishment.

### Spirit Planter Elder’s Residence  

A white-haired but vigorous elder sat drinking tea with Qi Chunde in a mountaintop courtyard.  

"Junior Brother Qi, how long do you think it will take to cultivate these spirit plants?" the elder asked, his gaze expectant.  

In the Qinglu Sect, only one person could address a Golden Core Elder as "junior brother"—the current sect master, Gao Yunrui.  

"Sect Master, though these spirit plants are rare, they should still be available in the Immortal City. Why go through the trouble of having me accelerate their growth?" Qi Chunde was puzzled. The sect master had interrupted his seclusion just to ask him to hasten the maturation of some medicinal plants.  

"Junior Brother, you don’t understand. I’ve already sent people to purchase these herbs in the Immortal City, but it seems another group is buying them up faster than we can. The city’s stock has been nearly exhausted, and the next batch won’t mature for decades," Gao Yunrui said helplessly.  

A market where cultivators traded was called a "marketplace," but when expanded dozens or even hundreds of times, it became an "Immortal City"—a city inhabited by cultivators.  

"Sect Master, artificially accelerated plants have subtle differences compared to naturally grown ones. This could affect the success rate of refining the Nascent Soul Pill," Qi Chunde pointed out.  

He knew exactly why the sect master wanted these plants. Among the sect’s higher-ups, it was no secret.  

Refining a Nascent Soul Pill required extensive preparations—impossible to conceal.  

"But we don’t have time," Gao Yunrui sighed.  

Since the Qinglu Sect’s Nascent Soul ancestor had perished, the changes had become increasingly apparent. Some of the sect’s external resource points were slowly being encroached upon by other major sects. Everyone knew the Qinglu Sect was now vulnerable, an easy target.  

If this continued, it wouldn’t be long before someone dared to attack the sect directly. Though the Qinglu Sect had powerful defensive formations, without a Nascent Soul cultivator, their security was far from guaranteed.  

As the sect master, Gao Yunrui had reached the peak of Golden Core and was the only one in the sect with the potential to attempt a breakthrough to Nascent Soul. After all, as the previous generation’s most outstanding disciple, he had earned his position through sheer talent.  

But attempting the breakthrough directly was too risky. If he were alone, he might take the gamble. But as the sect master—and the only hope for the Qinglu Sect’s survival—he had to be cautious.  

If he failed, the sect might not produce another Nascent Soul cultivator for centuries. And the Qinglu Sect didn’t have centuries to wait.  

Thus, he had decided to gather the sect’s full resources to refine a Nascent Soul Pill.  

The fourth-tier main ingredient had already been secured, but problems had arisen with some third-tier supplementary materials. Certain spirit herbs had been intercepted—clearly, someone was targeting the Qinglu Sect.  

With no way to purchase the needed herbs in the Immortal City, Gao Yunrui had no choice but to ask Qi Chunde to accelerate their growth. The urgency of the situation had forced him to interrupt Qi Chunde’s seclusion.
