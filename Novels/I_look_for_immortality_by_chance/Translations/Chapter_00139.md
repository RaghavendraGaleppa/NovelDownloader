# Chapter 139: Reusing the Stone Liquid, Two Opportunities!

The spring was not large, merely about a foot wide, nestled within a pool built of green stones, surrounded by a faint illusionary formation for protection.

But with a mere flick of his sleeve, Gu Yuan easily shattered the formation with a surge of sword qi.

"Drip! Drip!"

The faint sound of flowing water echoed continuously, and a refreshing aura washed over him. Gu Yuan felt a sudden clarity, as if his entire being had been cleansed, leaving him with a sense of weightlessness.

"The spiritual springs of these islands are the true foundation for survival!" Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh as he gazed at the clear spring before him.

The reason the demons of Nanbo Water Realm fought so desperately and refused to flee was largely due to their unwillingness to abandon the resources produced by these spiritual islands.

This was no longer the ancient times. Whether human or demon, cultivation required vast resources. Merely sitting in meditation was far from sufficient to meet one's needs. The forging of magical seals and the creation of spiritual artifacts all demanded an accumulation of resources.

The greatest treasure of Tianlang Island was not its dense spiritual energy but this "Cleansing Spring" situated atop a spiritual vein. With this spring, one could continuously draw its waters to trade or sell, thereby obtaining various resources.

However, the spiritual spring on Tianlang Island was not solely enjoyed by a single Earth Demon. Additionally, the demons' utilization of resources was rather crude, which might explain why the battle had been so easily won.

"Senior Brother Gu, we've finished clearing the area!" Ma Wu and the others approached together, their bodies exuding a fierce aura as they presented several items to Gu Yuan.

These were the spoils of war from capturing the island, and they dared not make decisions without consulting him.

The remaining resources on the island were scarce, most of them stored within the spatial pouches of the Earth Demons.

"Distribute the bones of the Qi Refinement-stage demons among the disciples. The rest can be divided among yourselves. From now on, any Earth Demons you kill will be yours to handle as you see fit."

"As for this Cleansing Spring, those Earth Demons might have harbored thoughts of returning, so they didn't destroy it. Instead, they took great care of it. We can extract about forty portions. I'll take half, and the rest can be divided among you."

Gu Yuan had already made his plans. With a wave of his sleeve, he took half of the spring water and handed it to Ma Wu.

Hearing this, Ma Wu and the others couldn't hide their joy and bowed deeply to Gu Yuan.

"Thank you, Senior Brother!"

"No need for formalities. Go and cultivate."

Gu Yuan waved them off, and soon, only he remained by the spring.

After ensuring no one was around with his divine sense, Gu Yuan flipped his hand, revealing a bluish-gray stone bottle. Inside, the liquid sloshed like jade striking jade.

"Don't disappoint me," Gu Yuan murmured as he gazed at the bottle.

Conquering Chiyue Great River was of utmost importance to him for two reasons.

The vast expanse of this land, teeming with countless demons locked in endless battles, was an ancient river forbidden to humans under normal circumstances. But with the war underway, opportunities had arisen.

Gu Yuan only hoped that the depths of the great river would hold the grand opportunities he sought.

"Boom!"

As the stone liquid entered his eyes, the world transformed. Stars swirled, and countless strange lines appeared. Everything in his vision turned gray, and the entire Nanbo Water Realm was laid bare before him.

Countless white dots, dense as stars, dotted the islands. Beyond them, numerous green opportunities shimmered faintly in the depths of the great river.

There were many of them.

But Gu Yuan's gaze swept past these green and white dots, focusing instead on two nearly pure silver opportunities deep within the river.

Silver opportunities were those that could, to a certain extent, alter one's fate.

The higher one's cultivation, the harder it was to change one's fate. Thus, as Gu Yuan's realm advanced, silver opportunities became increasingly rare.

Even when he had gone to Jade Pot Peak to fulfill the Elder's request, the opportunity had only been tinged with silver. However, due to the entanglement of the green stone book, Gu Yuan had managed to reconnect with the Elder and obtain the Sword Seal Pagoda—but that was another matter.

A nearly pure silver opportunity was already incredibly precious.

Gu Yuan focused his mind on the closer of the two opportunities, and a vague sensation arose.

"...Law."

But just then, the opportunity suddenly shifted, moving to another island and changing direction.

"Huh?"

This was the first time Gu Yuan had seen an opportunity move.

Could it be that the opportunity was a living being? But why would a living being possess a "law"?

As Gu Yuan pondered this, the opportunity shifted several more times before finally settling on an island, where it remained still. On that same island, a green opportunity flickered incessantly.

"What is this...?"

Before Gu Yuan could ponder further, the vision before him began to blur.

The stone liquid's effect was fading. Without hesitation, Gu Yuan directed his focus toward the second opportunity.

"...Cultivation, body."

Vague information flowed into his mind before the entire vision vanished, and Gu Yuan's sight returned to normal.

"One opportunity for a magical seal, and another for cultivation advancement?"

Recalling the information he had just received, Gu Yuan quickly analyzed it.

For him, cultivation was currently the most important!

Ever since his breakthrough, Gu Yuan had realized that his cultivation progress was painfully slow. After a year of cultivation, he could definitively say that he was utterly mediocre in the path of refining qi!

With only five spiritual apertures and the added difficulty of cultivating three techniques simultaneously, his progress was even slower than during his Qi Refinement stage.

Though his spiritual power far surpassed his peers, and his combat skills were formidable, advancing to the next realm was an arduous task. After a year of cultivation, his spiritual power had barely budged.

"But that moving opportunity seems more urgent..."

An opportunity that could move was unprecedented for Gu Yuan.

Without hesitation, he set off toward the location of the opportunity.

However, he didn't travel openly. Instead, he plunged into the water, activating his Cangming Dao Foundation to conceal his form with water-controlling techniques. Using his divine sense to block external detection, he moved like a silent fish, swiftly and stealthily toward his destination.

Though he hadn't cultivated any water-controlling seals, the Cangming Dao Foundation naturally allowed him to manipulate water. Gu Yuan felt no discomfort in the water; in fact, his speed was remarkable.

Before long, a remote island came into view.
