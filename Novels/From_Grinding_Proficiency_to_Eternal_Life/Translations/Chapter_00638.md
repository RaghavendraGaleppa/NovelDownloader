# Chapter 638: Ah? You Are an Outer Realm Demon!

Strictly speaking, in the entire Aetira continent, the territories occupied by the gods of the Natural Pantheon are mostly areas with relatively harsh environments. In contrast, regions suitable for breeding and habitation are almost entirely occupied by humans, beastmen, and elves.

As for demi-human races like the Barbarians, most of them were driven out of temperate and suitable environments due to their small populations, forced to survive in harsh icy wastelands.

"Titus."

Rockman's voice, like the grinding of glaciers, echoed directly in Xu Yunfan's ear. He looked at him with a scrutinizing gaze.

"Your aura is mixed with a strange fluctuation. And your subordinate god seems to possess a探查 (Investigation) authority. I remember there is a lower god with complete authority over探查 in the Savage West Wilderness?"

His gaze seemed to pierce through Xu Yunfan's disguise, carrying a hint of inexplicable meaning.

But Xu Yunfan was certain the other party absolutely could not see through his disguise. Under the guidance of the weak gods like Delice, he had already clarified the underlying cultivation logic of this world's cultivation system. With three layers of causal secret techniques as backup and the Thunder Godhead as cover, the image of Titus he transformed into was absolutely genuine.

Xu Yunfan bowed slightly: "Honorable Lord Rockman. Your subordinate was ambushed by a group of believers calling themselves 'Starfall' from an Outer Realm evil god the day before yesterday. My divine kingdom suffered damage. Fortunately, I recently acquired a subordinate god who used the authority of investigation to help me lock onto the enemy leader. Although I barely won, I also got stained with some foreign god's aura and need time to purify it."

He deliberately stimulated a trace of residual battle fluctuation within the Thunder Godhead, mixed with some of the unique deep and dark aura of the Star Soul Banner.

The ice mist on the throne churned slightly, and a cold, obscure fluctuation swept over Xu Yunfan's entire body, lingering particularly on the disguised Thunder Godhead and the Star Soul Banner hidden in his sleeve.

At this moment, Zhang Ziyang fully operated the investigation godhead, perfectly integrating his own existence trace into the fluctuations of the Thunder Godhead, while simultaneously sensing the trajectory of Rockman's scan in reverse.

It was a long while before the ice-needle-like fluctuation slowly withdrew.

It was a god's investigation method, but because this God of Winter presided over ice and cold, he wasn't specialized in investigation一类. Xu Yunfan didn't show any unusual reaction to this.

Rockman's voice couldn't discern joy or anger.

"Outer Realm evil god, Starfall? Hmph,又是 those rats from the sewers. Titus, remember your duty. The thunder of the Northern Plains must roar for the will of Winter. Watch over your territory. If there is any abnormality, report immediately. Your newly acquired subordinate god..."

There seemed to be a gaze falling on Xu Yunfan from within the ice mist, but Xu Yunfan remained calm in the face of it.

"... is quite interesting. Withdraw."

The无形 pressure vanished abruptly.

Xu Yunfan bowed again, maintaining the respectful posture应有的 of Titus.

Suddenly, he raised his head.

"Is there only you, a High God, in the Northern Plains of Winter?"

Rockman felt疑惑. Although he was displeased by the other party's impoliteness, he subconsciously responded that Winter was his territory.

Above the throne shrouded in ice mist, Rockman's voice sounded: "The Northern Plains of Winter are naturally my territory. Other High Gods naturally will not be allowed to meddle in it."

The无形 Law Network trembled slightly with his words. Through the Pantheon affiliation contract, Xu Yunfan clearly sensed that the other party was not lying.

The authority of frost over the entire Northern Plains was firmly tied to the throne. And in the Northern Plains of Winter, there was indeed only him, a High God.

A mere late Foundation Establishment realm.

"Then that makes it easier."

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth hooked up, and the respectful posture disguised as Titus instantly faded away.

He straightened his body. The black Dao robe moved without wind. The blue and white thunder patterns between his brows, belonging to the God of Thunder, shattered inch by inch, revealing his true, deep eyes.

"You..."

Rockman had just opened his mouth to speak when a strange feeling touched his heart, and his vision was instantly filled.

Xu Yunfan's figure tore through the spatial distance without warning, taking a single step to arrive before the throne.

The hazy ice mist enveloping Rockman was like a fragile veil, easily pierced by a hand entangled with purple-gold thunder patterns.

That hand accurately grabbed his throat covered by the ice crystal divine robe. A tremendous force, far beyond the cognition of the Aetira Pantheon, erupted with a bang.

*Boom!*

The deep blue glacial throne exploded under the immense force.

Rockman didn't even have time to mobilize the Law Power of the Eternal Frost Court. His divine body was硬生生 pulled from the debris of the throne, his feet hanging in the air.

The innate supernatural power of the North Pole Purple Micro Suppressive Evil Black Qi activated as Xu Yunfan's five fingers clenched. The vast suppressing force, like an invisible shackle, instantly locked down the surging Winter divine power within his body. Even the will of the divine core was forcibly confined, and his thoughts almost stagnated.

This was a technique to suppress both men and gods.

Xu Yunfan's eyes were cold. His idle left hand shot out like lightning, the fingertips jumping with dark and treacherous rune trajectories.

The洞冥蚀天箓 (Dongming Erosion Heaven Talisman).

The moment his fingertip touched Rockman's眉心 (glabella), countless fine as hair, twisting cause and effect Erosion Heaven Talismans钻入 (drilled into) his divine soul origin.

They did not destroy, but like the most venomous parasites, silently entwined with the cause and effect lines of Rockman's existence foundation, constructing a fatal restriction hidden in the void.

Once this world's god引动 cause and effect to investigate or attempt to pass abnormal information to the outside world, the talisman would instantly counterattack, annihilating his divine soul.

Until Xu Yunfan let go, and Rockman stumbled and fell among the ice crystal fragments, his frozen thoughts finally rotated again.

The ice mist completely dispersed, revealing a handsome divine face twisted by shock.

The power that invaded his divine body in the lightning-fast moment just now was violent and pure, carrying a rule aura completely different from this world's divine system, instantly disintegrating the vast divine power he possessed as a High God.

The logic of that power's operation was incompatible with the divine power system of the Aetira world, which relied on divine authority and faith will to build.

"Outer Realm Demon!"

Rockman's voice was hoarse, carrying unprecedented anger and fear. He instantly understood Xu Yunfan's true identity.

This was definitely not some Titus stained with a foreign god's aura, but a terrifying existence that had completely stolen his status and was now extending its claws toward the Lord of Winter.

The ice stalactites hanging from the ceiling of the Court broke off one after another due to his violently fluctuating emotions, crashing onto the ice surface and making crisp cracking sounds, just like his heart on the verge of collapse right now.

*This damn thing isn't even human. His strength is so much higher than mine, yet he still resorts to sneak attacks.*

*Simply shameless!*

"Correct answer, but it's too late."

Xu Yunfan looked down at him. The Star Soul Banner in his sleeve flashed a dark light, confirming that the restriction had been perfectly imprinted.

"From this moment on, the thunder of the Northern Plains will still roar for Winter, but Winter's will must follow my intention."

His words were flat, but carried an undeniable controlling power.

He couldn't kill Rockman for now. Once he moved against the other party, the main god of the Natural Pantheon would likely cast their gaze and pay attention.

After all, as a High God, from the perspective of the Taihua Spirit Ruin World's system, he was considered someone who could enter the eyes of a True Lord.

Rockman naturally knew why Xu Yunfan hadn't killed him.

He was full of dejection. Having fallen from the throne, he lowered his noble head.

*It's better to live a dog's life than to die a glorious death.*

Having been a god for so long, living for so long, no one is willing to die unless it's an extreme moment.
