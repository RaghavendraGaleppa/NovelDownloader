## Chapter 21: Secret

As they climbed, the sun beat down on them, and Li Zhi Ming and Han Li felt their legs ache from the exertion. Finally, they saw the green valley below and decided to take a break. Li Zhi Ming pulled out two pairs of adult shoes from his backpack and handed them to Han Li.

"What are you doing?" Han Li asked, puzzled, but he quickly followed suit, swapping his small shoes for the larger ones. They tied the shoes with grass strings to prevent them from falling off while walking.

The shoes were too big, and they struggled to walk properly. Li Zhi Ming cautioned Han Li to be careful, as their footprints could reveal their age. They couldn't take the risk of being discovered by their master.

Han Li nodded in agreement, still feeling a bit apprehensive about their plan. He had a nagging sense that they might be taking too big of a risk. However, his curiosity got the better of him, and he was determined to uncover their master's secret.

They hid their original shoes in the grass and put on the larger shoes, stomping in the mud to get used to the new footwear. Once they felt more comfortable, they began to climb up the hill and observe their surroundings.

The valley was secluded, and it was unlikely that anyone would stumble upon it. However, they knew that once they entered the stone room, they would be exposed. Han Li carefully observed their surroundings, checking for any signs of people hiding in the trees.

Just as he was being particularly thorough, Li Zhi Ming slapped him on the back of the head. "What's taking so long?" Li Zhi Ming scolded. "Come on, let's go!"

Han Li emerged from the trees, his movements cautious and stealthy. He joined Li Zhi Ming at the stone room entrance, and they both looked around nervously. Li Zhi Ming urged Han Li to hurry up, and Han Li began to search for the hidden mechanism.

After a few moments, Han Li found the trigger and pressed it. The sound of grinding stone filled the air, and the stone door creaked open. Han Li motioned for Li Zhi Ming to wait, then crouched down to examine the interior.

He spotted a thin gray thread and a displaced yellow leaf. Han Li's heart skipped a beat as he realized that their master might have left additional traps. He carefully picked up the leaf and put it in his pocket.

"What's taking so long?" Li Zhi Ming asked impatiently. "As long as we don't get caught, it's fine!"

Han Li shot Li Zhi Ming a stern look but acknowledged that his friend had a point. After checking for more potential traps, Han Li led the way into the stone room, cautioning Li Zhi Ming to be careful.

The two children, feeling like they were getting away with something, stepped over the gray thread and entered the stone room, unaware of whether their actions would go undetected.
