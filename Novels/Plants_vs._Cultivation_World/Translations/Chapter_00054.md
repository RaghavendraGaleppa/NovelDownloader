# Chapter 54: Mature Water Spirit Rice  

"Interesting. They actually refused my invitation!"  

He Shaogang stared at the list where two names were highlighted in red—Yao Shifeng and Gu Mo. Gu Mo's name had an additional special mark beside it.  

"Junior Brother, with your status as the sect master's personal disciple, you could easily recruit outer sect disciples. Why insist on choosing servant disciples?" asked the middle-aged cultivator standing beside He Shaogang. He was the same outer sect steward who had brought He Shaogang to Qinglu Sect.  

"Senior Brother, outer sect disciples are indeed good, but convincing them to join us is difficult. Servant disciples are different—give them an opportunity, and they'll cling to it desperately," He Shaogang replied softly.  

"I understand, but we're running out of time," the middle-aged cultivator said with concern. "Qinglu Sect is preparing to attempt refining a Nascent Soul Pill. If they succeed and produce a Nascent Soul cultivator, we'll lose our chance."  

"Refining a Nascent Soul Pill isn't that easy. Just the preparations alone will take years, and with a little interference from us, it'll take even longer," He Shaogang shook his head. "Our most urgent task now is gathering manpower. Only with enough people can we dismantle Qinglu Sect from within."  

"Senior Brother, I'll leave the screening of the invited servant disciples to you," He Shaogang said, handing the list to the middle-aged cultivator.  

He had selected some capable servant disciples and extended invitations to them, intending to groom them into his pawns. However, not everyone who accepted would ultimately qualify—they would have to undergo numerous trials.  

Unfortunately, the two pawns he valued most had rejected his invitation.  

Though one of them was already on his board, he had hoped to recruit and nurture them properly, as this pawn was currently the best he had.  

He Shaogang recalled the intelligence he had gathered on Gu Mo—a perfected-level Cleaning Technique, outstanding comprehension, and top-tier farming talent. In fact, aside from his poor spiritual roots, Gu Mo's abilities were almost on par with an inner sect disciple's.  

As for Yao Shifeng, while he didn't possess Gu Mo's exceptional comprehension, reaching the second level of Qi Refining in just two years was exceedingly rare among servant disciples. Most importantly, the man had ambition, unlike those servant disciples who gave up on advancing once they realized their limited potential.  

"Don't worry, leave these trivial matters to me. But Junior Brother, you must be careful. The Reincarnation Pill isn't invincible—don't let those old foxes discover you," the middle-aged cultivator warned before taking his leave.

"The progress bar is finally past halfway!"  

Gu Mo stared at the half-green arrow in the cultivation pot, feeling as though he had overcome a major hurdle. After six months of continuous effort, the gray arrow had finally turned half green. This meant that in another six months, he would obtain a second-tier Sunflower.  

Was it worth spending a year to cultivate a single second-tier Sunflower? In Gu Mo's eyes, absolutely. After all, even if he had an entire year, he definitely wouldn't be able to reach Foundation Establishment.  

But the Sunflower could. With a second-tier Sunflower, upgrading other plants would become much easier—the higher the tier of the solar essence, the more efficient the upgrades.  

The cultivation pot wasn't limited to Sunflowers; it could also upgrade Peashooters and Potato Mines. If he could upgrade them to the second tier, Gu Mo would possess combat power equivalent to a Foundation Establishment cultivator. It was no exaggeration to say that upgrading plants was the fastest way for him to gain self-defense capabilities.  

With plant guardians to protect him, Gu Mo could focus on cultivation and improving his realm.  

After checking the Sunflower's condition in the cultivation pot, Gu Mo left the Black Mist Space. It had been a year since he planted the Water Spirit Rice, and now it was finally mature—time for harvest.  

Arriving at the spirit field, a green pea shot out from among the crops, instantly killing a black spirit rat. Meanwhile, jets of water sprayed from the irrigation channels, washing away insects clinging to the rice stalks. A flash of gold and red then darted forward, swallowing the dislodged pests.  

As the Water Spirit Rice ripened, its aura attracted numerous spirit beasts and insects. Though most were blocked by the protective formation, any that slipped through were swiftly eliminated by the Peashooters Gu Mo had planted. Hidden aquatic pests, on the other hand, were hunted down by the koi.  

To better exterminate pests, the koi had even learned to spit water, knocking insects off the rice leaves before devouring them.  

Sensing Gu Mo's presence, the koi swam over eagerly, regurgitating a recently swallowed insect as if to show off before gulping it back down.  

"Good job!"  

Gu Mo rewarded it with a portion of solar essence, feeding it directly into the fish's mouth. To motivate the koi, he occasionally gave it treats, which explained why two-thirds of its scales had now turned gold.  

The increase in golden scales was also thanks to the Sunflower's tier upgrade. Gu Mo's Sunflowers were now mid-tier, producing solar essence of higher quality. Each portion now caused several more golden scales to appear on the koi.  

After dispensing the reward, Gu Mo turned his attention to the rippling Water Spirit Rice. He raised two fingers, and a sharp sword aura burst forth.  

---  

The technique Gu Mo was using now was no longer the novice-level Minor Genggold Sword Qi—it had reached the proficient level. Over the past six months, while all his solar essence had gone into upgrading the Sunflower, preventing him from cultivating, he hadn't neglected his spell practice.  

Especially as the Water Spirit Rice matured, spirit beasts and insects had become frequent intruders. Sometimes, the Peashooters and koi couldn't eliminate them in time, forcing Gu Mo to intervene. The repeated use of the technique had gradually elevated his Minor Genggold Sword Qi to the proficient level.  

This was his second farming spell to reach proficiency after the Minor Cloud Rain Technique. Mastering two proficient-level farming spells placed Gu Mo among the top-tier spirit farmers in the entire Spirit Planting Hall.  

With a sweep of the sword aura, the rice panicles were cleanly severed. Gu Mo then waved his sleeve, activating his Sleeve Dimension technique to collect the falling grains before they touched the ground.  

"Only about 300 catties..."  

After weighing the harvest, Gu Mo immediately knew the yield. Compared to the 800-catty yield of Spirit Jade Rice, 300 catties seemed meager. But for a first-tier, high-grade spirit crop, this was already considered high yield. The highest recorded yield in the Spirit Planting Hall was just over 500 catties.  

Under normal circumstances, 400 catties was the upper limit. Of course, if Gu Mo had a first-tier, high-grade spirit field, he was confident he could reach that ceiling.  

Though the 300-catty yield wasn't abundant, its value far surpassed that of the 800-catty Spirit Jade Rice.  

After harvesting, Gu Mo stored the Sunflowers and Peashooters in the Black Mist Space, preparing to report the yield to the Spirit Planting Hall. As for the Potato Mines, they were well-hidden and didn't need to be moved.  

Come to think of it, the rent-free period for his spirit field would expire in six months. He needed to figure out a way to extend it.
