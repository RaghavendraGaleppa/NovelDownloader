# Chapter 215: The Past is Like a Knife

Qin Lie flicked his wrist, shaking the blood off his blade before sheathing it.

"Senior Brother Qin's Scorching Plains Swordplay has improved yet again," the gaunt man on the right said with a sinister chuckle. A seven-segmented silver whip was coiled at his waist as he removed his face guard. "But I wonder if Junior Brother Lu still remembers who brought you that pot of strong liquor when you were punished to kneel in the Ice Pond for secretly learning the *Essentials of Divine Weapons*?"

Lu Cheng’s Adam's apple bobbed.

The man was Chu Mo, the Chief Steward of the Quenching Pavilion. The crescent-shaped burn scar on the tiger of his hand, left by molten iron during a sword test years ago, was still visible.

Behind the two men, a young master in white robes was leisurely wiping his jade ring with a shark-silk handkerchief. A silver glint flashed between his fingers.

"I have little time," the young master suddenly said, his voice soft and yin-like, like a viper's tongue. "Where is the divine armor of the Divine Weapon Valley?"

The air instantly froze. Everyone fell silent.

Lu Cheng’s expression turned unsightly as he stared at Qin Lie and Chu Mo.

"Cowards!" he suddenly roared, straightening his back. He looked at the two men, whose faces were gradually darkening. "You were cowards thirty years ago, and even after reaching the Marrow Cleansing Realm, you remain cowards!"

Thirty years ago, when the ninth-level Qi Refining Grandmaster shattered the Divine Weapon Ridge with a divine weapon, there were hidden secrets behind it. Qin Lie and Chu Mo were traitors who sold out their master for personal gain, and Lu Cheng despised them for it.

Qin Lie’s expression turned gloomy.

"Junior Brother, you are still the same—stubborn and unyielding," Qin Lie said. "Standing before you is the heir of the Yuwen family from the Great乾's northern territories. With the current chaos in the Great Zhou, the Great乾 will naturally restore order and return to the source. That witch of the Great Zhou has brought suffering to all under heaven; the Great乾 must raise the banner of righteousness. Junior Brother, I advise you one last time: if you speak, you might still be able to preserve a legacy for the Divine Weapon Ridge."

The Six Techniques of Divine Weapons, originally exclusive to the sect leader's direct disciples, allowed one to control all kinds of weapons. Naturally, this made Qin Lie and Chu Mo envious.

Lu Cheng sneered, a mocking smile appearing on his face.

"Senior Brother Qin, do you know that when you first entered the sect, the Master tested your aptitude and bone structure? For years, you thought the Master was biased, but the truth is your aptitude was insufficient to practice this technique," Lu Cheng said, raising his head high. "If I hadn't been severely injured back then and had my martial foundation crippled, the two of you standing before me today would be nothing but chickens and dogs."

Qin Lie’s face grew even more sinister, and even Chu Mo, who had been smiling faintly, turned grim.

However, the young master in white behind them watched the scene with amusement, a faint smile on his face.

"After all these years, Junior Brother Lu, your tongue is still as sharp as ever," Qin Lie said.

He suddenly sprang into action. His Yanling blade split the night, tearing through the air, and a blade beam shot out a full yard long.

Just as the blade was half an inch from Lu Cheng's throat, a seven-segmented whip arrived from behind and wrapped around it.

Chu Mo let out a sinister laugh. "Senior Brother, don't be hasty. Junior Brother Lu has always been soft on the hard and hard on the soft."

With that, he suddenly tossed out a dark wooden box. "Junior Brother, do you still remember this thing?"

A dried head rolled out from the box. A bronze hairpin插 in the white hair was the unmistakable insignia of the Divine Weapon Ridge's sect leader.

The moment Lu Cheng saw the dried head, the blood in his body seemed to freeze.

When his Senior Sister had passed him the remnants of the *Tiangong Kaiwu* scroll, this very hairpin had tapped his vital acupoints three times. Now, the tip of the hairpin was still stained with dark brown blood crust, appearing even darker and more black in the night.

"This witch was incredibly stubborn even before she died," Chu Mo said, stepping on the skull and crushing it. Brains and blood splattered onto Lu Cheng's black boots. "It wasn't until I crushed her ten fingers one by one that she finally spoke of the divine armor hidden deep within the Divine Weapon Ridge. It gave me quite a bit of trouble."

Lu Cheng trembled all over. "Back then, when you were in so much pain from training you couldn't even lift your legs, it was Senior Sister who massaged your shoulders and helped your blood flow!"

His eyes turned bloodshot, the corners of his eyes cracking open as blood trickled down. "How could you... How dare you!"

The young master in white suddenly clapped his hands and laughed softly, the jade ring flashing coldly in the twilight.

"Mr. Lu, do you know that the Great乾's twenty thousand troops are just a hundred li from here? If you hand over the divine armor, I can guarantee the safety of these women and children..."

He suddenly threw a fine steel dart. The tip of the dart pierced the clothes of three children climbing a tree, pinning them to a withered branch.

"...and let them live out their days in peace."

A child's cry rose from the bottom of the cliff, only to be muffled by a woman's hand.

The weeping of the children at the bottom of the cliff pierced through the mist, like a rusty file scraping back and forth in Lu Cheng's heart and lungs. He stared at the swaying blood droplets on the corner of Qin Lie's cloak. Suddenly, he tugged at the corner of his mouth.

"Under the third bellows in the east wing of the Sword Casting Hall, the pair of Mandarin Duck swords left by your brother are buried."

Qin Lie's wrist holding the sword trembled imperceptibly. The sharkskin wrapped around the hilt had long been worn smooth, but now fresh blood was seeping out—it was from the wound on his palm cut by the rust.

"The pair of short swords with jade inlaid on the handles..." Lu Cheng's throat let out a wheezing sound like a broken bellows. "Your nephew traded them for three dou of rice last month."

Lu Cheng glanced at the group of women and children huddled in the corner and said in a low voice, "Qin Lie, do you know that one of your nephews survived that day? He grew up safely, got married, and started a family. There, you have your family's blood..."

Qin Lie's gaze wavered slightly. After a long while, a cold look appeared on his face.

"So what?"

His bloodshot eyes suddenly turned to Chu Mo. "And Senior Brother Chu, do you remember the cellar in the Quenching Pavilion..."

Lu Cheng suddenly looked up, his eyes filled with bloodshot veins.

"Enough!" Qin Lie roared, his blade shattering the bluestone at his feet. Flying gravel scraped across Lu Cheng's cheek, carving a deep gash down to the bone.

Lu Cheng let out a light laugh and closed his eyes, uttering only one word.

"Coward!"

The young master in white still had a faint smile on his face, but a hint of impatience showed in his expression.

"Don't make me wait too long."

Qin Lie fell silent for a moment, then immediately drew his sword and walked toward Lu Cheng.

...

Half an hour later, Qin Lie sheathed his sword. Chu Mo shook the flesh fragments off his nine-segmented whip and looked at Lu Cheng's headless corpse, a cold sneer on his face.

"Senior Brother, your blade is no longer sharp."

Qin Lie remained silent for a long time.

Chu Mo glanced at the women and children lying in a pool of blood, devoid of life. He clicked his tongue, wrapped the nine-segmented whip back around his waist, and quickly walked up to the young master in white.

He cupped his fists and said respectfully, "Young Master, I remember there is a secret passage in the Divine Weapon Ridge. When the ridge was shattered back then, I personally heard the sect leader say that all the sect's foundations were hidden beneath the secret passage. Inside that passage lies the thousand-year accumulation of the Divine Weapon Ridge. The Grandmaster of the ninth level of Qi Refining searched for a long time but found nothing and returned empty-handed. I know a little about it. If we search, we will definitely find a trace of it!"

The young master's interest was immediately piqued. The thousand-year accumulation of the Divine Weapon Ridge—even if they didn't get the divine armor, finding the weapons accumulated over the years would be a great achievement. With the Great乾's thirty thousand vanguard troops sweeping through Yanbei, the more weapons, the better.
