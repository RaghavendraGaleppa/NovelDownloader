# Chapter 8: Spiritual Root Test

"Esteemed young masters and ladies, welcome to the Ascending Immortal Pavilion's Great Heavy Mountain branch. I am your guide to the world of cultivation."

"I am Steward Fuzhong, also the most reputable merchant in the Great Heavy Mountain region. Should you require anything in the future, please consider choosing the Ascending Immortal Pavilion."

"Now, please follow me."

The group of youths descended from their carriages, gathering in a noisy crowd as they were greeted by a short, plump middle-aged man with a prosperous appearance.

Fuzhong resembled a typical merchant—bowing slightly to everyone with a perpetually smiling, amiable expression. But anyone who underestimated him based on this demeanor would surely suffer for it.

Jiang Li casually cast an Appraisal skill toward him.

As his strength had grown, the "danger level" of the internal martial artists in their caravan had shifted to "High." 

But for Fuzhong:

[Name: Fuzhong, Gender: Male, Occupation: Cultivator, Level: Unknown, Danger Level: Extremely Dangerous!]

Another bright red "Extremely Dangerous" rating—this meant Jiang Li stood no chance against him, not even in escape.

Having grown accustomed to the cold indifference and arrogance of martial artists and even their cultivator escorts, Fuzhong's demeanor was striking. Despite possessing power that could crush them effortlessly, he maintained this humble attitude. Truly befitting a merchant.

Fuzhong led them through winding paths until they arrived at a spacious hall.

It somewhat resembled an indoor sports field from Jiang Li's previous life, though constructed entirely from interlocking wooden joints—a testament to ancient ingenuity.

The room was largely empty, with the most prominent feature being ten small arrays arranged in a row.

[Name: Basic Spirit Detection Array]  
[Type: Formation]  
[Grade: Yellow Tier, High Quality]  
[Function: Spirit Root Testing]

"Listen carefully, young masters and ladies. Before leaving your hometowns, you were all tested and confirmed to possess spiritual roots."

"Now, we will conduct a more detailed examination to determine the grade of your spiritual roots. This will decide how far and how fast you can progress on your path to immortality."

"Pay close attention—you only get one chance at this test."

Fuzhong's voice wasn't loud, yet it carried clearly to every ear. The murmuring crowd quickly quieted, the sound of nervous swallowing audible throughout.

Even Jiang Li felt tension creeping in. Would he have the innate Dao Body of a prodigy's beginning, or the lowest-grade spiritual roots of an underdog's start? This was the moment that would determine his fate.

"When I call your names, come forward one by one."

"Wang Ming, Han Ping, Li Baichen, Hu Feifei..."

The first group of ten stepped forward, standing nervously apart.

"Now, sit on the meditation cushions within the arrays. Keep your backs straight in lotus position."

The ten youths complied. Those whose postures weren't quite right were corrected by assistants.

"Good. Now lift the crystal sphere before you, holding it between your palms."

The semi-transparent sphere, about the size of a coconut, appeared somewhat heavy.

"Close your eyes and remain still. Hold the Spirit Testing Orb firmly—no matter what, do not let go. Remember: don't release it until I tell you to come down!"

After the youths nodded solemnly, Fuzhong gave a signal to the assistants stationed by the arrays.

"Begin."

The assistants each produced a spirit stone, pressing them into slots on the arrays. Immediately, the formations glowed with a faint light, and the seated youths began trembling slightly as if stimulated.

No wonder there were no second chances—each test consumed a spirit stone. The Ascending Immortal Pavilion clearly wouldn't cover the cost of mistakes.

After two or three minutes, Jiang Li noticed the orbs in their hands gradually beginning to glow. The colors varied, and the speed at which they brightened differed significantly.

Around the nine-minute mark, one youth's orb flashed brightly before dimming completely.

"Li Baichen, Earth Attribute, High-Grade Spiritual Root!"

The assistant beside him announced excitedly, quickly carving a wooden plaque which he hung around the youth's neck.

Fuzhong personally helped Li Baichen up, even adjusting his clothes with fatherly care, leaving the boy flustered by the attention.

"Young man, your aptitude is excellent. When choosing a sect later, do consider our Ascending Immortal Pavilion."

Li Baichen had been rather inconspicuous during their journey, mostly following Li Chao (who had since died on the road) as a lackey. After Jiang Li had beaten him up, he'd become even more subdued. 

Now, having tested as a high-grade spiritual root, his face lit up with pride as he stood to the side, chin raised. Jiang Li noticed him sneaking glances his way, clearly contemplating something—likely revenge—before pretending to look elsewhere when met with a glare.

The others in this batch fared worse. Only two managed to fill their orbs within twenty minutes, earning Medium-Grade plaques. 

The remaining seven performed poorly—after thirty minutes when the spirit stones depleted and the arrays dimmed, their orbs remained unfilled. Fuzhong didn't even bother addressing them as assistants issued Low-Grade or Inferior-Grade plaques based on their results. Their grim expressions showed they understood the implications—poor aptitude meant a far more difficult cultivation path.

Several more rounds passed. From his observations, Jiang Li pieced together the grading criteria:

Excluding rare special physiques, cultivation world generally classified spiritual roots into five tiers:

Supreme-Grade: Fills orb within 3 minutes.  
High-Grade: Fills orb within 10 minutes.  
Medium-Grade: Fills orb within 30 minutes.  
Low-Grade: Fills over one-third of orb after 30 minutes.  
Inferior-Grade: Fills less than one-third after 30 minutes.

The Ascending Immortal Pavilion's treatment made clear that gaps between tiers were vast. Additionally, dual or multi-attribute spiritual roots—while not as directly beneficial as higher single-attribute roots—still provided significant advantages.

After two more batches:

"Cai Dezhong, Gu Zhiping, Qiao Jiaju, Yan Fengyue, Yan Hong... Jiang Li."

Finally—his turn!

Despite himself, Jiang Li felt the same nervous anticipation as checking college entrance exam results—perhaps even more intense. At least exams depended on effort; this test was pure fate.

Beside him, Yan Hong wasn't faring any better, his teeth chattering audibly.

They stepped forward together, taking their seats on the cushions as instructed. Now Jiang Li could examine the array's patterns up close—interwoven lines of profound mystery that seemed to follow some logic, yet felt strangely rigid. After just moments, dizziness overwhelmed him, forcing him to shut his eyes and recover.

"Lift the Spirit Testing Orb between your palms!"

Jiang Li complied immediately. The semi-transparent orb felt warm and surprisingly light, not entirely solid.

Soon, the air around him seemed to clarify. With each breath, streams of cool energy seeped through his pores, circulating wildly through his body.

Now he understood why everyone trembled—this internal stimulation was indeed hard to suppress. But soon, the energy streams converged toward his palms, drawn unmistakably by the orb.

So the test worked by channeling spirit stone energy through the subject's body into the orb, with absorption rates revealing root quality. But was his speed fast or slow?

Unable to judge, Jiang Li focused on guiding the energy, willing it to flow faster.

Gradually, specks of light emerged in his vision, coalescing into a scene—a cold full moon hanging above an ancient, leafy tree.

"Yan Hong, Water Attribute, High-Grade Spiritual Root!"

An assistant's announcement was followed by the fat youth's triumphant laughter.

"Haha! This young master truly is a genius! Don't worry Jiang Li, I'll protect you!"

Jiang Li could picture Yan Hong's smug face without looking. He mentally cursed the fatty before another announcement came within moments.

"Jiang Li, Yin-Wood Dual Attribute, Medium-Grade Spiritual Root!"

Opening his eyes, Jiang Li exhaled in relief—this was a good result. 

Though Medium-Grade, he'd only been about two minutes slower than Yan Hong, placing him at the top of his tier. Combined with his dual attributes, this aptitude surpassed ninety percent of cultivators.

Fuzhong's eyes lit up after speaking with Yan Hong, and he hurried over to help Jiang Li up with a fatherly pat.

"Young man—Jiang Li, was it? Excellent! Such dignified bearing, surely destined for greatness."

"A pity though—just a dozen breaths more and you'd have made High-Grade. But rules are rules. And with dual attributes... truly unfortunate."
