**Chapter 73: Lei Wanbao: Great-Grandfather Has a New Favorite!**  

Zhang Yan looked at the refining manual in his hand and couldn't help but sigh. There were still good people in this world!  

Lei Kunhai, the master of Thunder Peak, might seem fierce and had even put him through a test, but before the test, he had practically given away the answers. If Zhang Yan still failed after this, it would be entirely his own fault!  

Excited, Zhang Yan took the refining manual and hurriedly excused himself to begin studying it.  

As Zhang Yan left, Lei Wanbao rubbed his face and approached. "Great-Grandfather, you just gave him your refining manual? What if he actually learns how to refine artifacts?"  

Lei Kunhai sighed and glanced at his foolish grandson. "Refining artifacts isn’t that easy. You’re considered a refining prodigy, personally trained by me since childhood, and after decades, you can only craft high-grade magical tools. Do you really think this kid can learn refining just from a manual?"  

He paused briefly before continuing, "Even if he manages to grasp the slightest bit of knowledge from it, I’d treat him like a treasure."  

"Ah?" Lei Wanbao was stunned. He hadn’t expected his great-grandfather to say something like that.  

"What’s so surprising? If someone can figure out the path of refining from just a manual, they’d be a one-in-a-million genius. Thunder Peak only has me as a true artifact refiner—the rest are barely passable. I can’t let our legacy die out!"  

"Great-Grandfather, what about me? I’ll definitely inherit your legacy!" Lei Wanbao thumped his chest confidently.  

"You?" Lei Kunhai smirked. "I’m not belittling you, but your talent in refining has its limits. High-grade spiritual tools are your ceiling. Crafting artifacts? Impossible."  

Lei Kunhai repeated the word "impossible" three times, emphasizing his stance.  

"Fine..." Lei Wanbao’s expression fell, but he didn’t argue.

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan returned to his cave dwelling and immediately equipped the refining manual in his system’s inventory.  

In an instant, a wealth of refining knowledge flooded his mind.  

"So this is artifact refining! I had no idea there were so many intricacies. No wonder refining is considered a top-tier profession—there’s so much to master!"  

Zhang Yan was deeply impressed by the depth of knowledge in the manual.  

Artifact refining was undoubtedly far more complex than spiritual plant cultivation. Without proper guidance, a novice attempting to refine tools would likely fail nine times out of ten.  

But with Lei Kunhai’s manual, Zhang Yan was no longer a complete novice. He could now be considered somewhat experienced—though only temporarily. He still needed to absorb and internalize the knowledge through practice.  

"Once I’ve digested some of this, I’ll seek out Master Lei. I’m sure he’d be willing to guide me further."  

---  

For the next several days, Zhang Yan immersed himself in studying the manual while still tending to his spiritual plants with Mu Sen.  

Refining was important, but so was securing his position as a true disciple. He had to excel in both.  

After more than ten days of study, Zhang Yan felt he had gained a basic understanding of refining and headed back to Thunder Peak.  

This time, no one stopped him as he entered.  

Before long, a man adorned with dazzling jewels approached him—Lei Wanbao, whose face was now unbruised and surprisingly handsome (though still not as much as Zhang Yan).  

"Senior Brother Lei, is the elder on the peak?" Zhang Yan asked.  

"Great-Grandfather is refining artifacts for someone. Want to take a look?" Lei Wanbao smirked, thinking it would be good for Zhang Yan to witness the gap between them. Maybe then he’d give up on refining.  

"Really? I’d love to!" Zhang Yan was thrilled. Observing the Thunder Peak master at work was a rare opportunity.  

"Normally, outsiders aren’t allowed, but I’m his great-grandson. Come on, I’ll take you."  

They headed straight for the refining workshop, where the rhythmic clanging of hammers echoed.  

"Refining involves hammering? I thought it was done in a furnace, like alchemy," Zhang Yan muttered in surprise.  

Lei Wanbao explained, "Refining has two methods: external and internal. Internal refining uses a furnace and is better for delicate artifacts like flying needles or seals. External refining is more versatile and suits most artifacts."  

Zhang Yan nodded in understanding. The manual had mentioned the need for physical strength in refining—now he realized it was for wielding the hammer.  

Inside the workshop, the heat was intense, at least twenty degrees hotter than outside. Fortunately, as cultivators, they could endure it.  

Dozens of disciples were hammering away, their movements resembling blacksmiths.  

"It’s like watching mortals forge weapons..." Zhang Yan mused but followed Lei Wanbao deeper inside.  

The further they went, the hotter it became. Eventually, even Zhang Yan had to circulate his spiritual energy to withstand the heat.  

At the deepest part of the workshop was a cavern leading underground, where the clanging grew louder.  

"Great-Grandfather is in there," Lei Wanbao said, handing Zhang Yan a Fire-Resistance Pearl. "Take this. Wouldn’t want you burning to death."  

"Thanks, Senior Brother." The pearl instantly cooled the air around him.  

"This cavern leads to the Sea of Earthfire. Be careful."  

Though Zhang Yan had taken one of Lei Wanbao’s true disciple slots, the latter didn’t hold much resentment—he was used to it by now.  

The cavern was narrow at first but soon opened into a vast underground plaza.  

There, Lei Kunhai stood shirtless before a massive forge, wielding a colossal hammer. With each strike, the metal on the anvil transformed, taking the shape of a delicate, lifelike flower.  

Zhang Yan watched in awe. The elder’s precision was astounding—he was literally hammering art into existence.  

After an unknown length of time, Lei Kunhai finally stopped and turned to Zhang Yan. "What do you want, kid?"  

"Master Lei, I’ve studied your refining manual and gained some insights. I was hoping for your guidance," Zhang Yan said respectfully.  

Lei Kunhai nearly laughed. "Insights? Save it. If you want to learn, start by hammering metal."  

Zhang Yan didn’t argue. He picked up a hammer and began working on a piece of spirit iron, focusing on purifying it—a fundamental refining skill.  

It was grueling work, especially for someone untrained in physical cultivation.  

"I need to learn a body-tempering technique after this," Zhang Yan grumbled inwardly.  

At first, he relied solely on his own skills, but gradually, he incorporated the manual’s knowledge, refining his technique with each strike.  

Lei Wanbao, who had initially watched mockingly, soon grew uneasy.  

Zhang Yan was improving at an alarming rate.  

Worse, his hammering style was eerily familiar—almost identical to Lei Kunhai’s.  

A horrifying realization struck Lei Wanbao.  

*Great-Grandfather has a new favorite!*  

His heart twisted with betrayal. The man who had doted on him all his life had abandoned him for another!
