# Chapter 166: Has Grandfather Bi Manifested?

Zhou Tian's attire was conspicuously out of place, strikingly different from everyone else's. It drew many gazes. Although some people secretly frowned, they were all at the same banquet, so no one immediately stepped forward to challenge him.

"Brother Gu, I heard your family made a fortune recently." In a small circle of five or six people, someone raised a glass wine cup. The clear, jade-like liquid inside gently swirled, emitting an unusual fragrance, as he spoke to a young man opposite him.

"What great fortune? Just earning some small change by navigating the gaps between the major powers of the Star Realm." The person opposite also raised his cup. Though his tone was modest, the smugness on his face was impossible to hide. After all, being able to make money amidst the major powers of the Star Realm was a skill in itself.

"Brother Gu, I heard that many major Star Realm powers are plotting against Jiuzhou. Is that true?" Someone else in that small circle spoke up.

"Matters between such great powers are not for us to casually discuss." The young man named Brother Gu's expression turned serious, as if he didn't want to elaborate. However, the people conversing with him showed no signs of disappointment.

"However, this isn't a big secret among the high-level powers. I do know a little about it." Brother Gu's tone shifted, and the smugness on his face intensified. It was as if his backing force was a truly great power.

The others felt a bit fed up internally, but they had to admit that Brother Gu's backing was indeed stronger. Also, curiosity gnawed at them, so they slightly cupped their fists and said, "Please enlighten us, Brother Gu."

"Of course, of course." Brother Gu chuckled and began, "This matter can be called a major event in the Star Realm in the past hundred thousand years."

Brother Gu's voice was completely undisguised, even a bit louder. Zhou Tian heard it clearly, pondering silently. He hadn't expected this matter to be spreading so rapidly in the Star Realm. Currently, he was also very curious to see what Brother Gu could reveal, so he took a step and moved closer in that direction. Many people at the banquet also leaned in that direction, clearly very curious. Seeing this, Brother Gu grew even more pleased. This feeling of being the center of attention at the banquet made him feel very good.

"This time, it's rumored to be spearheaded by the Abyssal Tomb..."

"Hiss~" The very first sentence caused a collective intake of breath.

"The Abyssal Tomb? That's a super-power occupying Space Node No. 11. They haven't caused any waves for a long time."

"No wonder several Tomb Lords of the Abyssal Tomb have been appearing frequently recently. So that's why." Brother Gu was very satisfied with the 'show's effect' and continued, "As you all know, the Abyssal Tomb is the Tomb of All Realms. They've seen all sorts of worlds. They've long coveted Jiuzhou, a world artificially reconstituted from nine great worlds. If Jiuzhou itself weren't extremely powerful, it would have long since become just another tomb in the Abyssal Tomb."

"Now that they've made their move, they're clearly determined to seize Jiuzhou. Moreover, Heavenly God Mountain has also shown its stance, sharpening its blades against Jiuzhou. As for what other powers are involved, I'm not sure. Please forgive me."

"Not at all, not at all! Brother Gu, we are already extremely grateful for you clearing up our confusion. Without you, it might have taken us a while longer to get this news." Someone flattered him, a smile plastered on his face.

"Then isn't Jiuzhou doomed to fail? Heavenly God Mountain is also a powerful force occupying Space Node No. 16. With these two formidable powers allied, what can Jiuzhou use to stop them?" Someone raised the question. If that were the case, Jiuzhou would have no choice but to surrender.

"Not necessarily." Brother Gu spoke again, drawing everyone's attention. "Have you forgotten how Jiuzhou rose to power? The Star-Forging Pavilion has always been on good terms with them, even having people intermarry for generations."

"Since the Abyssal Tomb has made its move, the Star-Forging Pavilion naturally won't just stand by. Although the Abyssal Tomb ranks one position higher than the Star-Forging Pavilion, that's largely due to the Abyssal Tomb's unique nature. In terms of influence within the Star Realm, the Star-Forging Pavilion, having operated for many years, is likely even more dominant."

Everyone was once again astonished. They hadn't expected the Star-Forging Pavilion to also be involved. This matter truly seemed to be one of the most significant events in the Star Realm.

Zhou Tian, however, was very curious about Brother Gu's remark about how Jiuzhou rose to power, so he spoke up: "Brother Gu, could you tell us how Jiuzhou rose to power?"

Everyone turned their gaze to Zhou Tian, all frowning slightly. "How did such a disheveled fellow get in here?" Brother Gu also slightly frowned, seemingly displeased with Zhou Tian's tone.

However, before he could speak, a cold, clear male voice sounded: "A mere minor power, occupying a space node beyond the thousandth, dares to presumptuously discuss major Star Realm powers here? Truly courting death!"

Brother Gu's face turned incredibly ugly. The power behind him was indeed only ranked after the thousandth in the Star Realm, but how vast was the Star Realm? To be ranked even after the thousandth was still considered noteworthy. He turned around to see who dared to reprimand him like this.

The speaker was a young man, not dressed in anything resembling a suit, but in a purple-gold long robe. He had long, golden hair draped over his shoulders, a strong and tall physique, golden pupils, and a blood-red mark on his glabella. What was most striking were the two brilliant horns on either side of his head.

He walked towards Brother Gu with a majestic, dragon-like stride, as if a golden divine ox was battling heaven and earth, shattering stars, and destroying worlds—this was the external manifestation of his dense bloodline.

"Ni Gu, isn't it? A temperament like yours will likely invite disaster..." He walked up to Ni Gu, looked down at him, his eyes filled with indifference. "Is the Ni family very strong? I recall a power roughly on your level being annihilated overnight not long ago. All direct male and female descendants of the clan were killed, not a trace of their bones remained, and it's said their ancestral realm was destroyed, leaving only a black hole. In this world, there are always powers we must revere and look up to. Even I dare not casually discuss them, yet you speak rashly here. If someone intentionally frames you and spreads what you just said, the Ni family might not survive until tomorrow. Do you understand?"

"Has Grandfather Bi manifested?" Zhou Tian was speechless upon hearing the man's words. This tactic really worked everywhere. However, he had no impression of this being. This person hadn't been at the banquet moments ago; he was very noticeable, so it would have been impossible not to notice him. He must have just arrived.

"It's Niu Hong of the Primordial Kirin Ox Clan. His clan occupies Space Node No. 173. It's said that one of their ancestors is currently still the mount of a powerful figure in the First Ancient Land." Someone recognized him, as the two horns on his head were too striking, exceptionally brilliant.

Ni Gu's face turned incredibly pale. He also realized the crucial point, having just been blinded by vanity. Now that he was called out, sweat poured down his face.
