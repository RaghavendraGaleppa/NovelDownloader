Chapter 341: The Whole World is the Enemy

The moment the hammer and palm collided, the old eunuch's arms shattered inch by inch like rotten wood. The ghostly blue flames were instantly dispersed by the overwhelmingly tyrannical Ten Extremities True Qi.

The hammer's momentum did not减, crashing heavily onto his crown. A muffled sound of the skull collapsing accompanied a spray of blood mist. The hunched body flew backward like a torn gunny sack, dragging a shocking trail of blood across the blue bricks of the training platform.

Xu Yunfan retracted his hammer and stood still, casting a cold glance at the mangled pile of flesh.

The old eunuch had not yet died, making a "gurgling" sound from his throat, his shattered chest still faintly heaving. The tenacious vitality of a Ninth-Rank Qi Refiner had become a form of torture at this moment.

"You eunuchs are truly..."

Xu Yunfan stepped forward, raising the hammer's edge once more, "You have broadened my horizons!"

This hammer strike carried the momentum of a collapsing mountain and a surging sea. The Ten Extremities True Qi, surging forth with the power of the earth's veins, erupted from the hammerhead, creating a visible shockwave that slammed down!

The eunuch's remains completely exploded under the crushing pressure of the terrifying True Qi. Flesh and shattered bones flew in all directions, lifting the blue bricks and earth within a thirty-foot radius.

When the dust settled, only a ten-foot-deep pit remained at the original location. At the bottom of the pit adhered a few corners of the eunuch's robe stained with blood.

"Xu Yunfan, how dare you betray the country?!"

A shout like the clashing of cold iron rang out. Guo Lang, the Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, stepped out from the edge of the viewing platform. His official robes fluttered, his face filled with rage.

"Betray the country?"

Xu Yunfan suddenly let out a long laugh. He inserted the Mountain Shaking Sea Calming Hammer back into the mechanism at his waist and drew the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel, pointing it at Guo Lang.

"If this 'country' involves sacrificing thirty million lives across the Six Paths and Seventy-Nine Prefectures, using resentful souls as firewood and skeletons as cauldrons, just to extend the female emperor's life by half a cycle..."

He pointed the hammer's edge towards the Imperial City direction, his voice causing the copper pot water clocks in the surroundings to explode. "What does it matter if I betray such a country!"

Xu Yunfan stared at Guo Lang.

"Director of the Imperial Astronomical Bureau, Guo Lang..."

Xu Yunfan's cudgel pointed directly at the other's glabella, the Ten Extremities True Qi vibrating in his throat like a dragon's roar. "Three years ago, you personally built the Star Observation Platform, using thirty million lives from the Seventy-Nine Prefectures as a sacrifice, just to extend the female emperor's life!"

He took a step forward, the Ten Extremities True Qi around him surging like a furious tide. "When the common people wept blood, you sat atop the platform drinking fine wine; where the冤 souls wailed, you held a compass calculating the surplus and deficit of fortune..."

The heavy cudgel tore through the air with a sharp whistle. "Such a butcher of a sorcerer, how dare you speak of loyalty and righteousness under the sun?!"

"Kill!"

Xu Yunfan's Ten Extremities True Qi surged like a raging river. The Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel was entwined with a mysterious yellow aura, each strike carrying the momentum of a collapsing mountain and a surging sea.

He felt an extreme sense of exhilaration. It turned out that when ancient heroes fought on the battlefield, they first raised the banner of "acting on Heaven's behalf." It wasn't hypocrisy; it was only by shouldering a great cause that the act of killing became even more satisfying!

Look, just swinging the cudgel felt three parts stronger, and his spirits were much better than before.

The cudgel's edge cleaved the air like a dragon's roar from the nine heavens. The blue bricks of the Black Tortoise Training Platform beneath his feet shattered inch by inch. Xu Yunfan grew more excited the more he thought about it and immediately let out a long howl: "The Dao Sect fights for the martial fortune of the world today. You people who use blood to sacrifice the country and harm the common people..."

The影 of the cudgel swept horizontally, grinding the incoming blades and spears into dust.

"Deserve to receive this cudgel!"

The Ten Extremities True Qi carried by the cudgel had not yet dissipated when a green light suddenly shot across the training platform.

"Immeasurable Heavenly尊!"

Daoist Guanshan of the Xuanzhen Sect appeared, stepping on the Eight Trigrams steps. The silver hairs of his whisk suddenly grew exponentially like a waterfall, actually managing to bind the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel at the critical moment.

The seemingly soft tail of the whisk clashed with the cudgel, producing a sound like metal striking metal. Xu Yunfan felt the force on the cudgel vanish like a mud cow entering the sea. An incredibly exquisite and peerless method of neutralizing force was dissolving the Ten Extremities True Qi layer by layer!

What great strength!

Daoist Guanshan was shocked inside. His True Qi burst forth, his Daoist robes billowed, and he couldn't help but retreat three steps. The dragon and tiger True Qi transformed into a dragon and a tiger circling his body before he barely managed to stop.

His expression remained unchanged. His left hand formed the Zi Wu seal, his voice like a great bell: "Brother Xu, your killing intent is too strong!"

Although Daoist Guanshan had neutralized seventy percent of the force with his Dragon and Tiger Pill Qi, he was still shaken back three steps, the blue bricks beneath his feet cracking one after another. The tiger's mouth on his left hand inside his sleeve had already split open. The phantom formed by the Dragon and Tiger True Qi was actually shaken into dispersing for a moment—how could this be the strength of an ordinary Ninth-Rank?!

"When I first saw this child on Qingyue Xuanzhen Mountain, he was just a小子 who had barely touched the threshold of the outer three unions..." Daoist Guanshan's heart was filled with towering waves, recalling Xu Yunfan's greenness during his duel with Su Zhenhe that day. The Ten Extremities True Qi contained in this cudgel now was comparable to that of an old monster who had cultivated for a hundred years in the Dao Sect!

"Senior Guanshan?!" Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised, then his voice turned deep.

Daoist Guanshan flicked his whisk. The silver hairs of the tail retracted like a living creature, transforming into a spear tip with a golden thread and jade luster. He lowered his eyes slightly, his voice like an ancient well without ripples: "Young Friend Xu, the Xuanzhen Sect has received the imperial order to guard the earth veins of Yujing."

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrow, his fingers tracing the patterns on the Nine Profound亢 Dragon Cudgel. The Ten Extremities True Qi suppressed itself and slowly poured into it, causing the nine mysterious patterns on the heavy cudgel to light up one after another.

"The Xuanzhen Sect is one of the six great sects of the Great Zhou, possessing the ten prefectures of the Lingnan Dao. The 'Dragon and Tiger Pill Strength' within the sect is said to point directly to the Land Immortal Realm. How could you lower yourself to beg the Great Zhou royal family and willingly become their hounds?"

"Lower ourselves? Willingly become hounds?" Daoist Guanshan's wide sleeves swayed slightly. The divine weapon, the Xuanzhen Sword, hanging at his waist, emitted a cold light. His eyebrows lowered as if observing mountains, yet it made the surrounding air suddenly stagnate: "Do you know, True Disciple Xu, that the Great Zhou royal family possesses the resources of the entire Great Zhou realm? Of the world's Six Paths, the sects share three, while the Great Zhou holds seven. The Great Zhou female emperor holds the 'Suppressing Dragon Seal,' and can even mobilize the thirty-six dragon vein nodes?"

"Simply last year, for the mining rights of the玄 iron ore vein in the Red Flame Rift Valley, the Xuanzhen Sect paid three thousand catties of Star Pattern Steel to the imperial treasury. Not to mention..."

He suddenly raised his eyes, his pupils reflecting the faint True Qi fluctuations behind Xu Yunfan: "The 'Nailing Dragon Technique' currently being cast by the Dao Sect on Qingwei Mountain requires Black Obsidian stones, all of which come from the Ghost Cry Abyss controlled by the royal family."

The sound of gongs from the Imperial City Division came from afar. Daoist Guanshan listened intently for a moment.

"True Disciple Xu, why do you think Hong Baichuan of the Heavenly Work Cave willingly forged weapons for the female emperor? Why are the Three Bitter Monks of the Maitreya Temple appearing on the Dao Sect's Qingwei Mountain?"

He suddenly smiled: "Among the sects under heaven, who is not drinking poison to quench thirst?"

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, and he instantly realized that in this matter, the Dao Sect was acting unilaterally, standing against the major sects.

That makes sense. The Dao Sect wants to sever the Great Zhou's dragon vein, elevating Xu Yunfan to break through his shackles and reach the Land Immortal Realm.

If Xu Yunfan succeeds, and the Dao Sect succeeds, then the balance of power among the Six Paths will no longer exist. Instead, the Dao Sect will cover the sky with one hand, becoming a hegemon among many strong factions.

"No wonder, no wonder the Xuanzhen Sect couldn't sit still..."

Xu Yunfan's Ten Extremities True Qi surged through his body like thunder. The edge of the cudgel exuded a sharp aura.

After a moment of silence, he raised his head, a trace of coldness appearing on his face.

"Of the six great sects, the Maitreya Temple is the female emperor's dog, the Xuanzhen Sect has obtained its techniques, and the Nine Luminaries Sect has always been vacillating..."
