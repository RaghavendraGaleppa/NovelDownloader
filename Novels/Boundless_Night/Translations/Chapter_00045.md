# Chapter 45: A Single Sheet of True Lore

The young nobleman Huang Jingjun wore a faint smile. At a time like this, the youth still had a sparkle in his eyes, staring at the Three-Colored Flower. Indeed, he was just a hunter from a remote area, still unaware of his predicament.

His elder brother, Huang Jingde, remained calm. Whether the youth was genuinely naive or pretending to be innocent to stall for time, it didn't matter.

"I can't believe there's such a mysterious product underground. Can eating it allow one to cultivate Heavenly Radiance Force?" Qin Ming asked.

He was genuinely seeking advice, his eyes filled with the clear purity unique to a youth, very sincere, wanting to understand this knowledge he had never encountered.

"First, you need to choose a suitable Heavenly Radiance Force and cultivate it to the introductory level. That way, consuming the Three-Colored Flower will have the best effect. Hmm, after I go back, I'll need to choose another one; I should think carefully about it."

Huang Jingde chuckled, answering every question. Anyway, it was still early, and he was idle.

What kind of trouble could a youth who had only undergone the First Awakening cause? As a Third Awakened One, he could easily crush the opponent with a flick of his hand.

"There are many kinds of Heavenly Radiance Force. Is there a specific way to choose among them?" Qin Ming was diligent and eager to learn, truly asking questions regardless of the occasion.

Huang Jingde nodded, "Of course. A Third Awakened One is doing well if they can barely cultivate one type of Heavenly Radiance Force. Only with higher cultivation realms can you practice more. And by combining them appropriately, you can unleash even more terrifying power."

Qin Ming frowned, "How to choose, how to combine them reasonably – shouldn't these be core truths that senior Qi-Will Arts schools wouldn't easily pass on?"

Huang Jingde smiled, "Exactly. 'True lore is on a single sheet, false lore fills a myriad of books.' This is the core essence written on a single sheet."

Qin Ming sighed. Who would easily tell others such core truths and principles?

Huang Jingde, being a practitioner of Heavenly Radiance Force himself, also felt something, "What do you think those rare Heavenly Radiance Forces come from? They are all the result of countless trials and errors by predecessors, fusing various force methods and combining them. For example, the legendary Sky-Propping Force and Tathagata Force are even more precious. Who knows how many types of Heavenly Radiance Force they integrate? Even a few leaked words would be priceless."

Huang Jingde spoke with a look of longing. Those things were too far from him, out of reach.

He sighed, "Let's not talk about those legends. Back to reality, any Heavenly Radiance Force with some reputation has been 'tempered a thousand times,' integrating many kinds of force methods. So, our path is difficult. Even if a 'single sheet of true lore' is laid before you, you still have to master all the densely recorded Heavenly Radiance Forces on it."

Qin Ming felt a bit numb. The silk scroll didn't seem to have any records about this? Or was it on the third page? He was utterly bewildered. What should he do?

He asked, "Are there no ways for ordinary people to advance? Without a 'single sheet of true lore,' can't they cultivate powerful Heavenly Radiance Force?"

Huang Jingde said, "There are. Those rare Heavenly Radiance Forces, and the legendary sect-guarding true teachings, were all continuously integrated by predecessors. You can also learn the more common Heavenly Radiance Forces circulating in the world, practice more, and then integrate them yourself."

The young nobleman Huang Jingjun saw that Qin Ming was actually lost in thought. The corners of his mouth curled up, unable to hold back, "Do you think Heavenly Radiance Force is merely superficial knowledge? It's very difficult to cultivate; each type is quite complex. How many types do you think you can master in your lifetime?"

Qin Ming seemed to snap back to reality, "Since you're going back to choose a new Heavenly Radiance Force and won't consume the Three-Colored Flower here, aren't you afraid of the medicinal effect diminishing?"

Huang Jingde said, "No worries. The weather is so cold that it can be preserved for over two months after ripening. It will last longer in a jade box."

He looked at Qin Ming with scrutinizing eyes, "You've asked me so many questions. Are you playing dumb, or are you genuinely confident?"

Qin Ming said calmly, "Zhou Wubing is my junior martial nephew, and Master Xu Kong is my senior martial brother, and they are both nearby. Do you think I have confidence?"

Huang Jingde first stared in a daze, then scoffed, "You probably don't know that Master Xu Kong already left this remote area with Zhou Wubing yesterday."

Qin Ming was startled. Second Sicko had already left. It seemed he wouldn't be able to beat him up anytime soon.

"Here, you can pick the Three-Colored Flower later." Huang Jingde tossed a jade box to Qin Ming, not afraid of him damaging it, as he carried more than one.

Qin Ming caught it, then walked to the side and buried the jade box under a pile of rocks, appearing very cautious, as if afraid of damaging it.

"What do you mean?"

"Afraid of it shattering during combat," Qin Ming replied truthfully.

He had long seen that although Huang Jingde seemed cheerful, he showed no openings. Relying on a sneak attack was impossible. This would be another tough battle.

"Playing dumb won't change anything." The younger Huang Jingjun stepped forward, "I'll teach you a lesson first."

"You're not good enough. Even Nie Rui and Shen Jiayun weren't my opponents. You're far inferior to them," Qin Ming stated truthfully.

Huang Jingjun had a cold smile on his face, "You wouldn't actually believe you're amazing just because the young people from Scarlet Cloud City flattered you a bit that day, would you?"

He sneered, "You, a First Awakened One, dare to put on airs in front of me? Before reaching the realm of a Second Awakened One, you are nothing to me!"

With a clang, he drew a long saber gleaming with cold light, "You're skilled in spear techniques, yet you don't even have a decent weapon."

"It's all the same to me what weapon I use," Qin Ming said, pulling a gleaming long saber from his back. Its quality was even higher than Huang Jingjun's.

After all, this was the weapon of that Third Awakened One from Golden Rooster Ridge.

Huang Jingjun's face was cold. Without another word, he suddenly accelerated, charging towards Qin Ming. The long saber in his hand flashed with a blinding light, chopping down.

In his opinion, with nearly 1,200 jin of strength after his Second Awakening, he could easily crush this young hunter and split him in half with one strike.

Qin Ming performed only two actions: first, he used the back of his saber to strike horizontally, hitting the opponent's saber blade without holding back. It instantly vibrated Huang Jingjun's arm, making him unable to grip the saber hilt, causing him to involuntarily let go.

Moreover, his hands were covered in blood, the soft flesh between his fingers torn by the immense force. He was utterly shocked, and simultaneously, became terrified, retreating at extreme speed.

Qin Ming's second action was to swing his saber forward. Even though Huang Jingjun reacted quickly and leaped backward, he couldn't completely avoid it.

Amidst sparks flying, his fine armor shattered, broken pieces stained with blood flying everywhere.

From Huang Jingjun's shoulder to his abdomen, a terrifying wound appeared. He was nearly cleaved in two diagonally. He wailed as he fell to the ground, and through the huge gash in his chest and abdomen, some of his internal organs were visible.

"Very weak!" Qin Ming commented, then ignored him and looked at Huang Jingde opposite him.

"Brother..." Huang Jingjun stammered, even though he hadn't died yet, he knew that if he wasn't treated immediately, he wouldn't survive.

Huang Jingde rushed over directly, holding a silver spear. All traces of his earlier calm and composure had vanished.

Previously, he had looked down on Qin Ming, so he didn't care and conversed with a playful attitude. Now, seeing Qin Ming's danger, he immediately erupted.

Qin Ming was fearless. He had fought Third Awakened Ones before and gained experience. This time, he wielded the long saber of the elder from Golden Rooster Ridge to meet the enemy.

With a clang, he cleaved out with one strike, directly deflecting the fiercely thrusting long spear to the side, off its original trajectory. He then pushed his saber forward with the momentum. The gleaming saber light vibrated and surged, like vast white waves between the sea and sky, threatening to engulf his opponent.

Huang Jingde's gaze was cold. Holding the spear with one hand, his other hand emitted a pure white Heavenly Radiance, striking the side of the saber blade. He too wanted to deflect it.

Indeed, he accurately struck the side of the saber, but he couldn't completely deflect it. The power of that saber strike was simply too immense. He had a faint illusion that the saber light was gleaming, as if truly amidst the horizon between sea and sky, with rumbling white waves crashing down.

Huang Jingde dodged rapidly. Even so, part of the armor on his chest shattered. That saber strike, after grazing him, possessed such terrifying power, showing a strength far exceeding his expectations, even surpassing his own as a Third Awakened One!

A faint bloodstain appeared on his chest.

"How is that possible?" Huang Jingjun, lying on the ground in intense pain, couldn't believe his eyes. His elder brother, a great master in the Third Awakening realm, actually suffered a loss on the first exchange?

But he clearly saw that no Heavenly Radiance flowed around his opponent during the fight, which meant he hadn't undergone the Third Awakening. How could he already possess such terrifying strength?

"I was careless. I didn't expect someone who hasn't cultivated Heavenly Radiance Force to be so strong, completely capable of matching a Third Awakened One." Huang Jingde's expression was solemn. He held the silver spear with both hands, his mind highly focused, adopting a life-or-death combat stance, ready to go all out.

Huang Jingjun, hearing his brother's assessment, clutched his wound and coughed, more blood flowing out. He truly couldn't accept that the hunter youth could be so absurdly powerful.

Qin Ming's expression also became serious. Although Huang Jingde was much younger than the elder from Golden Rooster Ridge, his actual strength might be even greater.

Indeed, after they exchanged blows again, Huang Jingde was much fiercer than before. The long spear in his hand seemed to transform into a dragon soaring through the clouds, baring its fangs and brandishing its claws, as if coming alive, continuously thrusting at Qin Ming's vital points.

At the same time, Huang Jingde's other hand would occasionally transform into a palm-saber, slashing forward unexpectedly when they were close.

However, he never once managed to break through Qin Ming's defense. Each time, he was blocked by layers of saber light.

What frustrated him most was that the youth's left hand also held a large hammer, which precisely struck his palm-saber several times, causing him intense pain.

The two had been fighting fiercely for a long time. Qin Ming, facing a Third Awakened One with Heavenly Radiance protecting his body, had no better method than to continuously attack, relying on powerful strength and exquisite saber techniques to force the opponent to use his Heavenly Radiance defense repeatedly, thereby rapidly depleting it.

In the distance, the Three-Colored Flower glowed with brilliant colors. Some petals had opened, and the surging mist of light in that area grew denser. Clearly, the spiritual flower was about to mature.

Even from a distance, the fragrance of the flower could be smelled, especially as the three-colored petals became increasingly crystalline and then brilliantly radiant, actually emitting large streams of light rain, appearing quite mysterious and extraordinary.

"How many types of Heavenly Radiance Force can this spiritual flower help one cultivate? I'm truly looking forward to it!" Qin Ming's eyes burned with eagerness.

His fighting spirit surged even higher. He hoped to end the battle soon, as he still needed to pluck the soon-to-be-mature Three-Colored Flower. He unleashed his full power.

In an instant, Qin Ming unleashed his strongest saber strike. It was as if he had entered a rainy night, with lightning flashing and thunder rumbling, and heavy rain pouring down. In that pitch-black night, his saber intent boiled, his spiritual power sublimated. His long saber cut through, as if to sever the entire dark night sky, to cleave all the lightning across the heavens.

Huang Jingde's face showed terror because the opponent's saber strike was too frightening. It seemed to carry endless lightning and misty rain, threatening to cleave open this underground cavern and cut through all obstacles.

He dodged quickly, but the long saber got closer and closer, impossible to avoid. He used his silver spear to block, but it was knocked away by a powerful force.

With his face pale, that saber strike arrived.

Huang Jingde roared, holding the spear with both hands, horizontally bracing it against the long saber. How could he possibly allow his opponent to cleave him in two?

With a clang, he felt as if a great mountain had pressed down. His silver long spear was flung away, and at the same time, his shoulder felt excruciating pain, his right arm dropping towards the ground, blood gushing out.

Though he temporarily saved his life, he completely lost the ability to fight, staggering backward, half of his body stained red with blood.

"You... weren't you just good at spear techniques?" Huang Jingjun, lying on the ground, gravely wounded and dying, asked in despair.

"I'm pretty good with a saber too," Qin Ming replied.
