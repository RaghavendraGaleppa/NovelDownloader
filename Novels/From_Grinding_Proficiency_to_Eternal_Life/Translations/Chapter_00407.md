# Chapter 407: Cold Crow Pass

"Let's meet at Cold Crow Pass at the chen hour, three days from now."

Considering that the others had already signed the blood pact, Xu Yunfan decided to do a good deed. He tossed out two small discs.

"These are geomagnetic compasses. They can detect each other's positions. We can use them to contact one another when the time comes."

The two palm-sized discs arced through the air and were caught by Hua Ling and Li Ergou.

Hua Ling caught hers and took a look.

Her eyes lit up. "Senior Brother actually has attainment in the Dao of Formations?"

Among the hundred arts of cultivation, the four main streams are Pill, Formation, Artifact, and Talisman. Being proficient in any one of them makes one a talent. In particular, the path of formations requires connecting formation lines to resonate with heaven and earth.

"I've learned a little."

Xu Yunfan remained noncommittal.

The territory under the Primordial Origin Sect was known as the "Nineteen Cities of Xuanming," but in reality, it controlled ninety-one cultivation cities.

Cold Crow Pass, a northern border fortress, was guarded in rotation by three Core Formation elders and was the only path to the extreme north.

Once past Cold Crow Pass, one would enter the territory of the Righteous Sect, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Forming a team there would not only avoid the sect's prying eyes but also be convenient for...

He glanced at Hua Ling, who was whispering to Li Ergou. The butterfly hairpin on the young girl's bun was trembling slightly.

"Did this Junior Brother just say he understands geomancy?"

Hua Ling suddenly moved in front of Li Ergou, her nose almost touching his chin.

Li Ergou froze on the spot, the veins on his neck bulging, yet he didn't dare take a step back.

"A l-little."

"That's perfect!"

Hua Ling clapped her hands and turned around, laughing.

"I heard there's an ancient cultivator's cave dwelling in the Frost Wasteland that holds a fragment of the 'Two Elements Micro Dust Formation' diagram from the ancient times."

She blinked at Xu Yunfan, implying something.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered.

The Two Elements Micro Dust Formation was the镇派 grand formation of the Xuanfu Gate. If he could truly obtain this fragment, it would be of great benefit to his comprehension of the Dao of Formations.

But what concerned him more was Hua Ling's source of information. The Frost Wasteland didn't exist on the Primordial Origin Sect's maps; it was the Xuanfu Gate's name for the "Frost Rift Valley."

It seemed this was targeted at him?

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes slightly, his thoughts slowly stirring in that moment.

"See you in three days."

He turned and left, the sound of Li Ergou's suppressed groan coming from behind him.

He didn't need to look to know that Hua Ling was trying to make Li Ergou submit to her charm.

Disciples of the Hundred Desires Peak always try to seduce others before communicating.

Three days later.

The flowing light behind Xu Yunfan gradually faded as he looked at the majestic city ahead.

The walls of Cold Crow Pass were built from the bones of demonic beasts.

Millions of white leg bones were interlocked, with uncoagulating filth flowing through the gaps.

Yunfan stood at the entrance of Cold Crow Pass, the harsh yin wind carrying a piercing chill rushing at him.

He looked down and saw a winding, black river like a giant snake lying beneath the pass. The river was over a hundred miles wide, and the ink-like water was so viscous it seemed almost stagnant.

What was most horrifying was that the river surface was densely packed with countless pale arms. These arms would sometimes stretch out and sometimes curl up, like drowning people struggling for their last breath.

When the mountain wind swept across the river, faint, sharp wails could be heard from the bottom of the river. The sound was like thousands of vengeful spirits crying out at the same time, making one's scalp tingle.

Xu Yunfan focused his gaze and found that the wrists of those arms were all wearing the Primordial Origin Sect's unique玄铁 shackles.

These were mostly the remains of those who fell in the great battles at Cold Crow Pass over the years. The Primordial Origin Sect sank them into the river, and over time, it became a strange place.

On the riverbank, several newly discarded corpses were slowly sinking. The rotting flesh was eroded away by the river water, revealing white bones.

And those arms sinking to the bottom of the river would soon float back to the surface, joining this endless cycle of suffering.

Unable to reincarnate, unable to enter the cycle of rebirth, trapped in the sea of suffering forever until the soul withers and both spirit and soul are destroyed.

Xu Yunfan felt a chill in his heart upon seeing this.

This river contained not only the bones of Righteous Path cultivators but also no small amount of aura from Primordial Origin Sect disciples.

"Senior Brother is early."

Hua Ling's voice came from behind. She had changed into a plain white skirt today, the silver bells in her hair replaced by jade pendants, and even her aura was restrained to that of an ordinary person.

If not for Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Heavenly Eye which could see through illusions, he would have almost thought she was a little rich girl who had sneaked out.

Li Ergou followed behind her, his face even more sallow than three days ago.

The boy had the compass Xu Yunfan gave him hanging at his waist.

"Last night, the patrolling disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect at Cold Crow Pass sent a message to the sect."

His voice was hoarse, as if his entire being had fallen into a state of ashen vital energy.

Xu Yunfan glanced at him but didn't pay much attention. The other party must be practicing some secret technique to appear this way.

There were many strange secret techniques within the Primordial Origin Sect that could make one's external appearance take on a bizarre form.

"The Xuanfu Gate has added a patrol team at Falling Snow Cliff."

A wisp of sword qi was sealed within the ice crystal, pure and awe-inspiring, completely at odds with the surrounding filthy demonic energy.

Hua Ling's eyes flashed with surprise, as if re-evaluating Li Ergou.

"Where did you get this?"

Li Ergou smiled shyly. "I have a fellow villager inside Cold Crow Pass. When I came, I specifically asked him, and he told me. This ice crystal contains the sword qi collected from a deceased disciple of the Xuanfu Gate a few days ago."

"The Xuan Heavenly Extermination Demon Sword Art?" Hua Ling looked at it carefully, a hint of solemnity flashing in her eyes. "Isn't this the sword Dao of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect?"

"Yes. A few days ago, our Primordial Origin Sect had three Core Formation elders come together, annexed a strange place into the sect, and forced the Xuanfu Gate to invite sword cultivators from the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect over. A great battle broke out, and there were many casualties."

"No wonder there have been so many new disciples entering the sect recently..."

Hua Ling blinked at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan responded with a smile.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan was completely unaffected by her Hundred Desires technique, Hua Ling wasn't discouraged.

She just refused to believe it.

Li Ergou looked troubled.

"The圣 sect and the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect are fighting now. If we go out, we'll probably be killed the moment we show our heads..."

"That's why we have to take the Green Louse Ancient Path."

Hua Ling magically produced three talismans. "Aura-Concealing Talismans. They can disguise one as any cultivation method below Core Formation."

The paper was made from the skin of a strange beast, and the cinnabar patterns were embedded with undried blood beads.

When Xu Yunfan took the talisman, his fingertip touched Hua Ling's finger.

She scratched his palm with her finger.

He didn't show it on his face.

You little vixen, just wait and see tonight!

Although his Hundred Desires Swallowing Origin Art was cultivated poorly, the True Martial Swallowing Demon Art could still do some things.

"With this talisman, as long as we are careful and avoid those Core Formation elders, we'll be fine. We're just small shrimps and fish; they won't bother calculating our karma. Lead the way, Li Shidi."

Hua Ling couldn't help but sigh at this. "If only I had a Heaven-defying treasure."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred slightly upon hearing this. The True Martial Swallowing Demon Scripture naturally has a method of aura concealment. As long as one condenses the image of the tortoise and snake coiling together, one can hide oneself from the heavenly secrets.

Hua Ling patted her waist pouch. "I heard there are snow demons on the ancient path, so I specially brought some Blazing Sun Nails."

(There should be more, as I am currently writing.)
