# Chapter 251: Obtained!

Jingming was momentarily convinced that the Xu Yunfan before her was innocent, that someone else had struck.

Madman!

A demon in human skin!

As Xu Yunfan’s face filled with smiles, an even colder chill settled in Jingming’s heart.

“Speak.”

Xu Yunfan lowered his eyelids, looking calmly at Jingming before him.

Jingming no longer hesitated and slowly recited the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique.

Two hours later, after inquiring about all his doubts, Xu Yunfan glanced at his attribute panel.

There was no movement; not a single piece of information had popped up. When Pei Yan had recounted the Void Clearing Sword Art earlier, practice-related notifications had occasionally appeared on the attribute panel.

He looked into Jingming’s eyes and suddenly laughed.

“Recite what you just said, but in reverse.”

Jingming’s expression stiffened slightly. What she had just said was mostly the content of the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique, but it was nine parts true and one part false. In some places, saying a little more or a little less would have a tremendous impact on the technique.

Practicing true Buddhist techniques carries a killing intent, naturally requiring the refinement of Buddhist teachings to resolve the hostility in one’s heart.

Seeing the nun’s frozen expression, Xu Yunfan sneered slightly; she didn’t even know how to lie.

His five fingers suddenly clamped down on Jingming’s head. The gaps between the scales of his Dragon Scale Armor seeped out Red Flood Python Evil Qi, shredding the Buddhist light around her inch by inch.

“Little nun, you have quite a sharp tongue.”

His Red Flood Python Mountain-Splitting Strength circulated, using it to drive the Triple焦 (Sanjiao) Sword Intent,钻入 (drilling) through the Fengchi acupoint behind the woman’s ear and into her meridians.

“Although my Tiangong Cave’s Medicine Valley isn’t famous, we have a unique understanding of the human body. They say there are eight hundred pain points on the human body. I wonder if you can endure them…”

Jingming’s neck veins bulged. She bit her lips until they bled, yet she made no sound.

Xu Yunfan sneered and drove the Red Flood Python Mountain-Splitting Strength. The Dragon Scale Armor scales opened and closed, bursting with thousands of golden threads. That wisp of sword intent suddenly exploded into thousands of wandering threads,钻入 (钻入) the organs and meridians.

This Jingming was only at the Flesh Refining Realm. Although she cultivated Buddhist spiritual secret techniques, she was ultimately a mortal body of flesh and blood and could not become a Buddha.

The female monk finally let out a piercing scream. The Eight Treasure Bodhi Beads burst with golden light to protect her, and the golden silk soft armor on her body vibrated and trembled incessantly, but it was firmly suppressed by the rank pressure of the Dragon Scale Armor, a Level 8 Divine Weapon.

These two divine weapons were only Level 7. Now that Jingming had completely lost her ability to resist, even if they possessed spiritual consciousness, how could they withstand the oppressive aura of the Dragon Scale Armor?

Xu Yunfan snapped the prayer beads from her wrist, his expression cold as he said, “You deliberately reversed the sequence of the marrow-cleansing meridians, hoping that when I go berserk, the evil qi will backlash, right?”

He suddenly yanked Jingming up and slammed her into the rock wall. The immense strength augmented by the Dragon Scale Armor shook the stalactites on the cave ceiling, causing them to fall in rustling layers.

“Practitioners of the Buddhist path are not supposed to lie, so why have you broken your precepts?”

The female monk vomited a large mouthful of blood, a faint smile appearing on her face.

“Benefactor, the path I cultivate is not of this world. Usually, this poor nun loves to tell harmless little lies… Even if you obtain the true version…”

She gasped for breath, forming a lotus seal with her hands, and an extraordinary Buddhist nature actually bloomed from her body.

“Without the harmony of my Non-Self Buddha’s Compassionate Heart Method, you won’t be able to cultivate it successfully…”

She was using him as a whetstone!

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly. He did not hesitate anymore. His fingertip touched Jingming’s forehead, while his other hand crossed his chest, forming the Seal of Lin (Stand).

In an instant, his Ego-Spirit (Self-Spirit) walked out from his Sea of Consciousness. Driven by Xu Yunfan’s will, the mist ahead churned, actually parting to reveal a rugged path that wound its way to the horizon.

This method could be considered something taught by the woman in white within his dreams—of course, it was something he had learned while being tortured.

Entering a dream was originally based on his Sea of Consciousness; in the spiritual world, one can naturally have whatever they wish.

Xu Yunfan’s fingertip touched Jingming’s forehead. As he recited the “Supreme Good is Like Water” Heart Mantra, the ancient runes on the Dragon Scale Armor suddenly lit up, and the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace on his back emitted a low hum.

The Ego-Spirit drawn by the Seal of Lin followed his fingertips and pierced into the female monk’s forehead, breaking through layers of restrictions and stepping into the other party’s Sea of Consciousness.

“Ah!!”

Jingming’s whole body trembled violently, and the lotus seal instantly shattered.

The Golden Body Buddha phantom seated in her Sea of Consciousness was grabbed by the Ego-Spirit’s large hand, its skull torn open. The sky full of Buddhist chants turned into piercing wails.

Xu Yunfan’s Ego-Spirit stood atop a blood wave, stepping on a flood dragon, looking down at the Buddhist Pure Land that the other party had cultivated for years and was about to collapse: “Since you dared to use me as a whetstone, you must have the觉悟 (觉悟) that the knife may break and the person may die!”

The female monk barely formed a hand seal. Deep in her Sea of Consciousness, a Vajra Sutra suddenly appeared, and the shadows of three hundred Arhats formed a formation to protect her core memories.

Xu Yunfan sneered. His Ego-Spirit formed the opening stance of the Nine Profound Flood Dragon Mace. In reality, the Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Mace actually pierced through the void and appeared in the Sea of Consciousness. The Xuanming True Water entwining the mace body turned into a black dragon, twisting with the Red Flood Python to form a Yin-Yang Great Millstone.

In the next instant, this overlapping Yin-Yang Great Millstone crushed down with the momentum of the sky collapsing. The Arhat formation shattered like glass, and the true text characters of the “Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique” within the sutra were forcefully crushed out.

Outside, Jingming’s seven orifices bled, the veins on her neck bulged, and her expression was one of terror. She had never imagined that the spiritual secret technique the other party cultivated could actually step into another’s Sea of Consciousness.

Such a wondrous technique was truly world-shaking!

“You… can actually devour Buddhist…”

Before she could finish, Xu Yunfan’s Ego-Spirit suddenly discovered a Vajra seal hidden within the sutra text.

A final fluctuation appeared in Jingming’s residual consciousness: “Maha Prajna Paramita!”

Wanting to go down together?

Xu Yunfan’s heart moved. His Ego-Spirit glanced at the surrounding Sea of Consciousness, which was about to shatter, and immediately did not hesitate, retreating quickly.

In the outside world, Xu Yunfan’s finger had only just touched Jingming. Even the Lin Seal in his left hand had only just been formed, and he had only spoken a few words of the “Supreme Good is Like Water” Heart Mantra.

Seeing Jingming’s dull expression and unfocused gaze, Xu Yunfan couldn’t help but hold his breath.

Did he accidentally kill her?

“How is the Master?”

Hearing the commotion, Jingming turned her head to look at Xu Yunfan.

“Very good, and you, Benefactor?”

Looking into Jingming’s pure and innocent eyes, Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred slightly.

Has she become an idiot?

“Recite the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique for me to hear.”

Jingming’s gaze was scattered, but the corners of her mouth curled into a strange smile. Her voice was hollow yet fluent, like chanting a sutra:

“Benefactor, listen. Meridians are like dragons turning, Marrow is like mercury flowing. The hundred meridines absorb the morning sun, The Golden Body naturally becomes immortal…”

She mechanically recited the口诀 (mantra), her fingers unconsciously drawing the trajectory of the marrow-cleansing circulation on the ground.

‘You are learning the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique, and seem to have a slight realization.’

Seeing this information pop up in his vision, Xu Yunfan’s spirit was lifted, and he listened carefully.

Half an hour later, a piece of information suddenly jumped out in Xu Yunfan’s vision.

‘You have learned the Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique.’

Looking at the entry ‘Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique (Not yet mastered)’ that appeared in the skill column of the attribute panel, Xu Yunfan finally let out a sigh of relief.

This technique was finally in his hands.

Although he had just met this Jingming, if he were to entangle with her, there was a very high probability that he would be schemed against without realizing it.

Rather than that, it was better to strike early.

Her strength was inferior to his, and they were isolated from the outside world within the Small World Secret Realm. Such a heaven-sent opportunity would be a waste to squander.

In his view, among the six top sects of Great Zhou, not a single one was innocent.
