Chapter 63: Meeting the Immortal of the Jar, The Chest Drum Thunder

The Immortal of the Jar was short and ugly, with a disheveled head and dirty face. His mouth was as wide as a tiger's, his face covered in pockmarks, and his eyes were as small as green beans. On his back, he carried a stone jar the size of a person.

His body was covered in bloodstains, though it was unclear if they were his or someone else's. However, he was indeed injured, with gruesome and terrifying wounds from blades and swords. A patch of skin had been torn from his chest.

Currently, he was caught in an iron net. Startled, he scanned the crowd and saw that they were just a motley crew, yet he remained calm.

Sinisterly, he said, "More people bringing themselves to the soup pot."

Li Xian frowned, finding the man extremely ugly. Not daring to be negligent, he immediately shouted, "Activate the formation!"

Four men holding nets stood at the four corners and began to run in a circle. The iron net wrapped around the Immortal of the Jar pulled tighter under the tension, tangling into a complex mess that was about to turn him into a zongzi.

Li Xian jumped to a high point, drew his bow, and shot an arrow. Unexpectedly, even though the Immortal of the Jar was caught in the net, his strength was still immense. In this situation, he shifted to the left and actually dodged the flying arrow.

Li Xian narrowed his eyes, secretly noting that this fellow was truly formidable. He didn't hold back, nocking another arrow and shooting again, aiming for the vitals with every shot.

The Immortal of the Jar laughed, "Good kid, you're quite accurate. You want to shoot your大爷 (old man)? Dream on!"

His body swayed left and right, like a tumbler. Even with the restriction of the iron net, he could still dodge repeatedly.

"Master Li..."

"He's so strong!"

"I can't hold on much longer!" said a net-bearing guard in panic.

"Hold on, reinforcements will be here soon," Li Xian consoled, continuing to shoot arrows to harass him. At the same time, he shouted, "Spearmen and shieldmen, advance!"

In the Iron Net Capture Formation, four men used nets to restrain, two used spears to attack, two used shields for defense, and two used bows to harass. Their coordination was orderly, balancing offense and defense. It was extremely effective.

Although the Immortal of the Jar seemed to dodge every arrow, in reality, the flying arrows consumed a great deal of his mental energy. Now, with spears and shields advancing together, he was forced back step by step. Several times, he tried to use his internal energy to break free from the situation, but because the iron net covered his body, his hands and feet were difficult to move freely, and his martial arts were thus restricted.

The combined pulling force of the four men was truly formidable. If it were a contest of pure strength, the Immortal of the Jar could easily overpower the four. However, there were long spears stabbing at close range and long bows harassing from afar. If he wanted to wrestle with the net-holders, his feet had to be planted firmly to generate force. But the moment he planted his feet, he exposed an opening, and either a flying arrow or a long spear would immediately draw blood.

If he tried to step forward to attack, there were people with shields to defend.

"Damn it, you little gnats are so annoying! If I weren't seriously injured, how could I let you little brats be so arrogant?"

The Immortal of the Jar's vicious aura flared. Just then, he caught a flaw in the formation and forcefully tried to break out to the left.

Li Xian said, "Shield to the left!" At the same time, he drew his bow and shot a tricky arrow.

The shield-bearer followed the command and blocked to the left. The Immortal of the Jar cursed, "Damn you, get lost!" and headbutted the shield, sending the shield-bearer flying several yards.

But the Immortal of the Jar's momentum was slowed, and he couldn't completely break out of the formation. The guards immediately swarmed back, trapping him within the formation's scope once more.

At the same time, Li Xian's flying arrow arrived again, nailing itself into the Immortal of the Jar's shoulder.

"Good kid, quite clever!"

After being hurt, the Immortal of the Jar cast a cold, gloomy glance at Li Xian. He had figured it out: this formation was different from others, all because of this brat's control.

"Hehehe, you really think this is enough to catch me?" the Immortal of the Jar sneered. "Very well, let me show you my ability."

With that, he leaped into the air, several yards off the ground. The net-holders pulled down with all their might. The Immortal of the Jar chuckled, shifted his center of gravity, and, with his back facing the ground, used the momentum to execute a "Thousand Catty Drop," slamming his body heavily onto the ground.

Li Xian remained vigilant, sensing something was wrong. He could only keep his distance, guarding with his bow and arrow.

With a "thud," the stone jar was unharmed, but the lid sealing it came loose from the mouth of the jar. It turned out that because the Immortal of the Jar was trapped by the iron net, he couldn't open the jar. He could only use the impact force from the fall to shake the lid open.

A yellowish-brown liquid flowed out, and a foul, rotting stench spread.

"What is that?" Li Xian was惊疑 (startled and doubtful), but his expression remained calm. He immediately shouted, "Hold your breath! This man has exhausted all his tricks, there's no need to be afraid."

But the spreading smell still made the net-holders panic.

"It's... it's a head..."

A head rolled to the mouth of the jar. Because of the iron net, it didn't fall to the ground. But the net-holder on the west side saw it and was so terrified his legs went weak, trembling uncontrollably.

"Hehe, this guy was one of yours, from the same place," the Immortal of the Jar said, looking at the guard with a grin. "I put him in the jar. He didn't last two hours before turning into blood water. Kid, if you let go now, I'll spare your life!"

"Stay calm!" Li Xian roared, channeling his Qi.

The guard barely managed to stay calm, but his heart was racing, his hands were shaking, and his strength was fading. Signs of defeat were already showing.

"This man had already fought with other teams before this and killed many people," Li Xian secretly pondered.

Seeing the current scene, he knew that Li Haitang's plan had failed. The Iron Net Capture Formation could indeed trap the Immortal of the Jar, but humans have seven emotions and six desires. If they encounter such a powerful opponent and their formation is thrown into chaos, the formation's power would be reduced by more than half, and they would naturally lose completely.

"Don't be afraid, everyone! Heroine Li just sent me a voice transmission. We just need to hold on a little longer, and this thief will be executed," Li Xian pretended to be overjoyed and shouted loudly.

"Excellent, excellent!"
"Ha ha ha."

Li Xian laughed loudly to encourage everyone. This tactic was indeed effective. Thinking of Li Haitang and the others, the guards became less afraid.

The Immortal of the Jar shuddered all over. If Li Haitang and the others were to catch up, he would indeed be in trouble. But then he sneered repeatedly, thinking:

"Good kid, Li Haitang and the others are only at the Food Essence level. They don't have the profound power to do Condensed Qi Voice Transmission."

"I almost fell for your bluff."

"You're even more troublesome than Li Haitang and the others."

The Immortal of the Jar slapped the body of the jar with his palm.

With a "噗" (pu) sound, liquid from the jar splashed out, followed by various bits of flesh, fingers, teeth... and other human body parts. It was terrifying.

"It's... it's Liu Quan!"

Everyone was horrified. Among the many fragments of flesh, they recognized a finger belonging to the "Grade B Guard" Liu Quan. In the eyes of the many guards, he was a superior existence, yet this was his fate now.

"I'll count to three. Whoever surrenders voluntarily, I'll spare their life," said the Immortal of the Jar. "If not, this will be your fate."

At this moment, the two sides were locked in a stalemate, and neither could do anything to the other. It all depended on who had the steadier temperament and could endure the intimidation.

Li Xian narrowed his eyes. How could he not know that this thief was brutal by nature and his words couldn't be trusted? He could stay calm, but it was difficult for the other guards.

Then, an idea struck him. He knew that the way to counter fear was with another fear!

He immediately took out nine arrows, nocked them on his bow, and drew the string back to a full moon shape.

He said coldly, "Whoever lets go, don't blame me for showing no mercy."

Hearing this, the people realized that they couldn't survive either way, so they had no choice but to keep holding on.

"You brat, you're so damn persistent, so damn persistent. Fine, fine, since that's the case, don't blame me for being heartless," the Immortal of the Jar cursed through gritted teeth. He had no choice but to use that move.

A muffled sound of thunder exploded.

"Is it thundering?"

Li Xian looked up at the sky. There wasn't a cloud for ten thousand miles; it was a clear, bright sky.

"No..."

"It's the chest drum like thunder!"

Li Xian's heart tightened. The Chest Drum Like Thunder was one of the标志 (signs) of the Food Essence level.

"Boom..."

A muffled thunderclap erupted from the Immortal of the Jar's chest, rolling and churning without end. The small stones on the ground trembled with the sound of the thunder...

The muffled thunder rolled, and killing intent brewed.
