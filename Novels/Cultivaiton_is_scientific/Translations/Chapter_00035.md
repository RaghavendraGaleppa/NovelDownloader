# Chapter 35: The Plan

Before leaving, Gu Jia gave Li Shiming another piece of information—Prince Shun would be traveling to Bao'en Temple outside the city tomorrow to pray for blessings. 

Li Shiming understood the implication. This was yet another favor Gu Jia was extending to him.

After seeing Gu Jia off, Li Shiming began contemplating how to kill a protected individual without using cultivator methods and leaving no traces. 

The vast database of the IBM z15 mainframe server contained countless methods to eliminate mortals. His task was simply to choose—selecting the most effective approach that met all requirements.

With the enhanced processing speed of his 190-core CPU brain, a plan quickly took shape. 

He gave some instructions to Mo Yan before returning to his study to examine the map Gu Jia had left behind. The map marked the location of the market and the method to enter it.

In truth, the entry methods for most cultivation markets were similar—they were designed to restrict mortals, not cultivators. Knowing Li Shiming was a novice, Gu Jia had thoughtfully included the entry method along with the map.

The market wasn’t within the capital but twenty li north of the city. 

Li Shiming frowned. Traveling there by horse or carriage was impractical. Though his physical condition was excellent, he hadn’t tested long-distance running. Even if he could, doing so would only reveal his weakness to other cultivators.

"It seems I’ll have to use the 'Light Body Talisman'," he murmured. 

He only had eleven of these talismans, but considering he might be able to purchase more at the market, using one or two wasn’t an unbearable loss.

The market would open again in five days. His immediate concern, however, was Prince Shun and Li Wenfeng.

Information about Li Wenfeng wasn’t hard to obtain. Mo Yan had learned that Li Wenfeng’s residence was some distance from the imperial palace, outside Gu Jia’s protective jurisdiction. 

Killing Li Wenfeng could be done anytime, as long as no cultivator methods or spiritual energy traces were left behind. Gu Jia would likely turn a blind eye. 

Li Shiming even suspected that if he did use spiritual energy, Gu Jia might still shield him. But doing so would mean owing even more favors—something he wished to avoid.

At the eastern gate of the capital, a splendid procession of riders and carriages exited the city. 

This was Prince Shun’s entourage—three carriages escorted by fifty cavalrymen. The lavish carriage in the center carried the prince himself, flanked by four mounted elite guards.

Such security ensured they could handle anything short of a full-scale military ambush. Even then, they could hold out until reinforcements arrived. 

The prince’s journey was foolproof—at least, that’s what everyone in the procession believed.

The cavalry were well-trained, maintaining a steady, unhurried pace. Four riders periodically scouted ahead in pairs, a standard military practice.

Li Shiming had left the city earlier than Prince Shun, ostensibly to visit Bao'en Temple for prayers. By the time the prince departed, Li Shiming was already on his way back to the city.

His own entourage was modest—four guards, Si Qin, and Mo Yan. 

The road outside the city was straight, and his carriage traveled down the center.

"Young Master, there’s a royal procession ahead. Should we yield?" one of the guards reported upon spotting the banners.

When carriages met on the road, protocol dictated that those of lower status give way. Li Shiming’s party, lacking any official rank, had no choice but to defer to the royal family.

"Pull to the side and continue," Li Shiming instructed calmly, having already observed the procession through the window.

This wasn’t the emperor’s procession, nor was the road cleared. Yielding the central lane was sufficient.

As the carriage moved aside, an inconspicuous flat stone dislodged from beneath it and fell to the ground. 

Amid the sounds of wheels and hooves, neither the guards nor the attendants noticed the stone.

Prince Shun’s procession paid no attention to the yielding carriage and continued forward at the same pace.

"That’s the carriage of the Nanling Prefect’s office!" Li Wenfeng, seated beside Prince Shun, recognized the markings with surprise. 

How could he forget the insignia? It was only by suppressing his elder brother that he had gained Prince Shun’s favor and risen to the rank of third-grade Chief Steward.

"Don’t let hatred cloud your judgment. There will be plenty of opportunities to deal with him later," Prince Shun said dismissively, sipping his wine.

The news of Li Shiming’s presence barely registered. To the prince, Li Shiming was insignificant—a minor nuisance to be crushed at leisure, were it not for the emperor’s interest in the auspicious signs. 

He had greater ambitions—to become the next emperor of Great Xia.

As the two carriages passed each other, Li Shiming caught sight of Li Wenfeng. He recognized him instantly from the portraits provided by Steward Zhang and the unmistakable blood relation.

A faint smile touched Li Shiming’s lips. He hadn’t expected Li Wenfeng to be in Prince Shun’s carriage—though it made sense, given his position as Chief Steward.

Li Wenfeng, too, saw Li Shiming through the window—and the smile on his face. 

A chill ran down Li Wenfeng’s spine, his hair standing on end. 

Logically, Li Shiming was just a frail scholar. Yet, in that moment, he seemed like a predator eyeing its prey.

Li Wenfeng wanted to voice his unease, but the presence of elite guards and fifty cavalrymen reassured him. 

The carriages moved past each other, separating. Prince Shun’s procession advanced another hundred meters, while Li Shiming’s carriage remained about two hundred meters behind.

When the prince’s entourage reached the area where the flat stone lay, the lead riders paid it no heed. 

Unless a stone was large enough to obstruct their path, it wasn’t worth noting. Otherwise, they’d never make progress.

As Prince Shun’s carriage rolled over the stone, a sharp *click* sounded, followed by a small flame. 

The flame ignited instantly into a roaring white fire, engulfing the entire carriage in a blaze that reeked of acrid fumes.
