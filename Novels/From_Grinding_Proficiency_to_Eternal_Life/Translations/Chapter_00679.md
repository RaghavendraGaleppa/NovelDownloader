# Chapter 679: One Against Two

Xu Yunfan’s expression quickly calmed down. The Divine霄 (Shenxiao) Dao Fruit operated at full power, with purple-gold lightning flowing over his body like a solid suit of armor. The Dao Rhyme of Destruction pushed back the surrounding chaotic dark light by several zhang.

His gaze was heavy as he swept it over the imposing Chiyang True Lord and then landed on the even more obscure and unfathomable Tongxuan True Lord. A sudden smile appeared on his calm face.

"Chiyang True Lord, I thought only you coveted my Dao Fruit. I didn't expect you to be able to persuade Tongxuan True Lord to join forces. It seems the pure yang fire of your Li Guang Ranyan Chiyang Dao Fruit is a great temptation to this Sword Lord who practices a yin-attributed Dao Fruit."

Chiyang True Lord frowned, looking at Xu Yunfan's fearless appearance. He really couldn't figure out what other tricks the other party could possibly play. A True Lord who had just entered the Golden Core realm might be at the top level within the Taihua Lingxu World, but among peers at the same Golden Core level, Chiyang True Lord felt the other party couldn't make much of a wave.

"You knew I would ambush you?"

The corner of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up, and fighting intent rose in his purple-gold lightning eyes. Since entering the Golden Core realm, he had been eager to see just how powerful his strength had become. Now that Chiyang True Lord had appeared, it just happened to fulfill his wish. Although Tongxuan True Lord was by his side, Xu Yunfan wasn't afraid; if he couldn't win, he could still run.

"You and I are mortal enemies in the Dao struggle, irreconcilable. I have just entered the Golden Core, my foundation is not yet solid, and the Divine霄 Dao Fruit is like a magnet attracting you. When I stepped out of the Primordial Origin Sect and set foot in the界海 (Jiehai), it was the best time for you to act. This is an open scheme, why do I need to guess?"

He paused, his voice suddenly turning sharp, and the Divine霄 Thunder rumbled.

"So what if I knew? Chiyang, Tongxuan, today in the Jiehai, it is the place where our Dao struggle decides life and death. If you want to seize my Dao Fruit, then see whose sword is sharper, my Divine霄 Thunder or yours!"

Before the words had fully fallen, Xu Yunfan had already boldly activated his Divine霄 Golden Core. Purple-gold lightning, like an angry dragon leaving the sea, actively bombarded the Chiyang True Lord who seemed capable of burning the sky and boiling the sea.

The chaotic Jiehai churned, and two powerful sword lights tore through the dark light. To the left, Li Guang Ranyan Chiyang True Lord was surrounded by flames that burned the sky. To the right, Tianji Xuan Shu Sword Soul Tongxuan True Lord's sword soul tore through the void. Xu Yunfan's purple-gold lightning surged, his Divine霄 Dao Body withstanding the dual pressure, and the Dao Rhyme of Destruction pushed back the chaotic airflow.

"I knew you two would join forces, but I didn't expect you to be so urgent," Xu Yunfan said coldly, his purple-gold lightning eyes locking onto Chiyang. "Thirty years of waiting at Chiyang Peak, are you so impatient today?"

Chiyang True Lord's pupils burned with magma. "Xu Yunfan! Stop your glib tongue! Today, this Lord will definitely seize your Dao Fruit and refine my Chiyang Sword Intent!"

The Fenji Sword rang as it left its sheath. A crimson sword rainbow, carrying the power to burn the sky and boil the sea, slashed down. Wherever it passed, the chaotic dark light evaporated and vanished. Tongxuan True Lord remained silent, his sword finger lightly划过. The buzzing invisible sword soul gathered into nine giant blades of black ice, locking down all of Xu Yunfan's evasion space. The extreme yin sword intent and the Chiyang flames strangely blended together, and the deadly trap suddenly tightened.

"Here they come!" Xu Yunfan let out a long cry and pressed his palms together. The Shenxiao Golden Core in his Dantian shook violently. Ninety-nine lightning dragons rushed out from under his Dao robe, forming a ring-shaped lightning prison that expanded outward.

Boom!

The lightning, fire, and sword soul collided head-on. The Chiyang sword rainbow was torn apart by the purple-gold lightning dragon, and Tongxuan's black ice sword blades also cracked under the Dao Rhyme of Destruction. Xu Yunfan did not retreat but advanced instead. His figure turned into electricity and shot before Chiyang. His fingers, like a sword, aimed directly at his glabella. The lightning light gathered at his fingertips was as fine as a hair, but it resonated with the chaotic thunder deep within the Jiehai.

"Seeking death!" Chiyang was shocked and furious. The Fenji Sword returned to block, and the scorching sword intent condensed into a giant shield of molten rock.

Sizzle!

The lightning thread pierced into the shield, and the molten rock actually melted like ice and snow. Chiyang retreated a hundred li in a flash, the sleeves of his Dao robe scorched black and shattered.

Tongxuan True Lord's sword-like brows furrowed sharply. The nine sword souls merged into one, turning into a dark giant sword that slashed down from the air—the Tianji Poxu Sword Intent!

Without looking back, Xu Yunfan's left sleeve swept up. The Zhou Tian Xuan Ling Banner grew rapidly in the storm. The deep banner surface saw the galaxy reverse, and three hundred and sixty-five main stars erupted with Kui Water Yin Thunder. The Yin Thunder net entangled the Poxu giant sword. The star power ground away at the Dao Rhyme and extreme yin sword soul, frantically offsetting them, actually locking the sword firmly in mid-air.

"Lin!" Xu Yunfan spat the true word from his lips and teeth. The humanity in his eyes faded, leaving only the clarity of eternal black ice. In the state of the Supreme's Forgetfulness, the pure yang fire lines flowing in Chiyang's Dao Fruit, the core yin attribute Dao patterns of Tongxuan's sword soul, and the flow trajectory of the Jiehai's dark light... all turned into analyzable networks of threads.

Chiyang True Lord's pupils contracted sharply. "The Lin Art?! The镇派 (Zhenpai) secret transmission of the Wansheng Sword Sect, how could you cultivate it to such a level?!" He and Tongxuan exchanged a glance, both seeing the shock in the other's eyes. This小子 (Xiaozi) had just entered the Golden Core but already controlled a True Lord-level killing move, and had even dug deeper into the Divine霄 Dao Fruit. The fact that the lightning thread had broken the molten rock shield just now clearly showed he had seen the minute lag in the operation of Chiyang's Dao Fire.

"This小子 has reached the perfection of the initial Golden Core stage!" Tongxuan True Lord's voice transmission was like a sword's cry, his cold tone carrying a tremor for the first time. Thirty years! To touch the threshold of the mid-stage in only thirty years, such progress can only be compared to the legendary Tathagata of the Bodhi Pure Land from back then. This小子 absolutely cannot be left alive.

The two of them were extremely默契 (tacitly understanding) in their hearts. In an instant, their killing intent surged. Chiyang's Fenji Sword pointed to the sky, and Tongxuan's sword soul returned to the abyss. One red and one dark, two sword lights shot up from the abyss of the Jiehai. Chiyang's sword light split into thousands of flowing fire meteors, and Tongxuan's sword soul condensed into a Nine Hells Ice Prison vortex.

Li Guang Burning World Sword Array! Xuan Shu Returning to Void Sword Prison! Extreme yang and extreme yin, the power of burning destruction and returning to void twisted space-time, turning into a destruction millstone covering a million li that ground down towards Xu Yunfan.

"Xuan Ling Banner, absorb!" Xu Yunfan commanded coldly. The Zhou Tian Xuan Ling Banner rustled and rolled violently, its banner surface turning into a black hole that devoured all things. Three hundred and sixty-five main stars detached from the banner surface, forming the Zhou Tian Star Constellation Array to forcefully resist the sword array.

Boom!

The flowing fire meteors crashed into the galaxy and were annihilated, the ice prison vortex was washed away and disintegrated by the torrent of star power. The Spirit Treasure-level star banner shook violently, the stars on its surface flickering as if about to shatter, but it forcibly swallowed the combined attack of the two swords!

Chiyang True Lord cried out in disbelief. "Origin Spirit Treasure?! You actually refined one!" The Zhou Tian Star Constellation Array cannot be borne without a Spirit Treasure. This banner's power had already exceeded the scope of a top-grade magic treasure.

Xu Yunfan's fingertips brushed over the cracks on the banner pole, and the lightning light flowed, mending the cracks. "Chiyang, you coveted my Dao Fruit for thirty years, but you didn't know that my artifact refining skill was the best in Taihua?" The Attribute Panel's thousand times of deduction and optimization, plus thirty years of tempering on Shenxiao Mountain, finally produced this banner.

The three figures collided and intertwined in the chaos. Chiyang's Fenji Sword triggered a tsunami of molten rock, Tongxuan's sword soul turned into invisible threads that cut through space, and Xu Yunfan used the Lin Art to predict and evade, his Shenxiao Lightning Dragons bombarding the weak points where the two's Dao Fruits connected. Purple-gold lightning, crimson flowing fire, and black ice sword scars tore the Jiehai apart.

Pfft!

Xu Yunfan's shoulder blade was pierced through by the sword soul, and the black ice Dao patterns eroded his lightning body.

Rip!

Chiyang's left arm was torn off by a lightning dragon, leaving a scorched piece of flesh, and his pure yang Dao fire dimmed. Tongxuan True Lord grunted and retreated, his protective sword soul swept by the star banner, with cracks spreading.

"A pity," Xu Yunfan said. Purple-gold blood stained his robe sleeves, and in the Lin state, he had no joy or sorrow. If there had been a chance to kill Chiyang alone, he could have seized his Dao Fruit now to complete his solitary yang. However, Tongxuan's sword soul was Yin-cold and tricky, always protecting Chiyang's vital point.

Chiyang True Lord leaned on the Fenji Sword in the void, his magma-like blood dripping and burning upon contact. At this moment, Chiyang True Lord's heart was naturally filled with shock, anger, and relief. It was good that he hadn't been arrogant but had pulled Tongxuan True Lord along with him; otherwise, the one dying in the Jiehai would have been himself.

Xu Yunfan gave Chiyang True Lord a deep look, then turned his head and charged towards Aitira.

Chiyang True Lord and Tongxuan True Lord naturally wouldn't let the other party go. Once Xu Yunfan caught his breath, they wouldn't be able to eat or sleep in peace. After all, the other party could even withstand a swordsman, and even fight two without falling behind, which was truly world-shocking. If they didn't kill this小子, they wouldn't dare to sleep.

"Chase!" Chiyang's roar from behind pierced through the lightning barrier. "Xu Yunfan! Even if you flee to the end of reincarnation, this Lord will cut down your Dao Fruit!"

The Fenji Sword burned through the chaos, and two killing rainbows closely followed the lightning light as they plunged into the Aitira World.

(That's it for today, writing the battle is a bit brain-draining.)
