# Chapter 75: Waves of Shock  

Zhou Qing recalled the previous night—racing through the snowstorm with Shang Bing’s severed head in hand, the exhilaration and heroic spirit of a martial artist still surging within him.  

*"The swordsman's tassels sway, his blade bright as frost and snow;*  
*Ten steps, one kill; a thousand miles, no trace left behind."*  

In his youth, when he had read *The Legend of the Condor Heroes*, Qiu Chuji’s grand entrance—charging through the snow with the head and heart of a traitor—had left a deep impression. Last night’s scene was eerily similar.  

*"The reckless heroism of youth, the swift vengeance of a warrior—this is what it means."*  

In times of chaos, one ought to act thus!  

---  

At the foot of Taihe Mountain, Panshi City was adorned with lanterns and decorations as the New Year approached. Under the protection of the Taihe Sect, the city enjoyed rare peace amidst the turmoil of the era.  

What had once been taken for granted now felt precious.  

This year’s celebrations had to be lively—who knew what the next year would bring?  

*"When the hexagram 'Yong Jiu' appears, seeing dragons without heads is auspicious."*  

Today was Shang Bing’s seventh-day memorial. Zhou Qing had cast an auspicious divination.  

Strangely, unlike Squire Zhang, who had returned as a vengeful ghost after death, Shang Bing—also a provincial scholar—had shown no signs of haunting.  

Zhou Qing had initially assumed that scholars of their rank, consumed by resentment, would inevitably become malevolent spirits. But now, it seemed his theory was flawed.  

Perhaps the difference lay in the times. When Squire Zhang died, the world had not yet descended into chaos. Now, with the empire in turmoil, the prestige of a provincial scholar no longer held the same weight. Even Ling Zhizhou, a metropolitan scholar, was routinely beaten by the martial governor of Jiangzhou.  

Zhou Qing pondered the origins of vengeful spirits but found no clear answers.  

"Haisha Gang is truly leaderless now. But can Sect Leader Hu handle their affairs alone?" Lady Lin asked doubtfully.  

"I’ve sent Zhishan with him."  

Lady Lin’s expression cleared in understanding.  

She thought of Zhou Qing’s beheading of Shang Bing.  

The terror of a Xiantian master was bone-chilling.  

And Zhishan traveled with two Xiantian experts at his side. As someone privy to the truth, even Lady Lin felt a shiver of fear.  

Two genuine Xiantian masters, obedient to Zhishan’s commands.  

Perhaps Zhishan was the most prestigious second-generation disciple in the history of Qingfu Temple—no, in the entire martial world of Great Zhou.  

To have two Xiantian martial artists as constant escorts—such power could arguably make him the strongest in the world.  

"Fortunately, it’s Zhishan," Lady Lin sighed in relief. Despite her unease, she knew his character well—steady, reliable, and unassuming.  

---  

Zhou Qing was in no hurry to ascend Taihe Mountain. Instead, he planned to stay in Panshi City for a while, taking the opportunity to teach Lady Lin some genuine martial techniques.  

Having endured the trials of their journey, she was now ready for more advanced instruction.  

For Zhou Qing, this was an intriguing endeavor.  

Molding an ordinary young woman into a Gangjin-level martial artist would deepen his understanding of the human body and unveil its mysteries—a pursuit of great significance to his cultivation.  

Moreover, he was more than willing to see Lady Lin progress and continue aiding him.  

The fist art he taught her was derived from his memories of Wing Chun, a style founded by a woman. With his current insights, he could refine it into a form better suited to her.  

He also incorporated elements of the Ox-Tongue Palm from Zhang Jingxiu’s Bagua Palm—a supremely soft technique with devastating power.  

Lady Lin was remarkably perceptive. Her ability to manage vast business affairs with such precision spoke volumes.  

"Talent is important in martial arts, but wisdom is indispensable. Without it, one cannot reach the pinnacle," Zhou Qing’s words bolstered her confidence.  

---  

In the Prince of Qinghe’s residence, a detailed report on Zhou Qing’s exploits at the Shang Family Fort landed on Yuan Hua’s desk.  

After a long perusal, he set it down with a sigh.  

"To think the young provincial scholar from years ago has now become a grandmaster. A Xiantian expert! If only he could serve me, the throne would be within grasp."  

But Yuan Hua knew it was impossible.  

Such beings disdained nobility and power. They would never bow to secular authority.  

Even Zhang Zhenren’s protection of him was based on generational ties. Asking the Daoist to kill for him? Unthinkable.  

If even Zhang Zhenren was thus, how much more so Zhou Qing?  

A chill ran down Yuan Hua’s spine. Had he not chosen to rebel amidst the empire’s fragmentation, the imperial eunuch grandmaster might have been dispatched to eliminate him.  

The world was only beginning to comprehend the might of Xiantian experts.  

Zhang Jingxiu already seemed divine in Yuan Hua’s eyes—let alone the eunuch grandmaster, who had long since ascended to that realm.  

"Scholar Zhou is too young—barely twenty, yet already a Xiantian master. Who knows how far he’ll grow? Though I aspire to the throne, the gap between us is that of immortal and mortal. Such a man must be treated with utmost respect."  

---  

Yuan Hua had not declared himself emperor.  

Years of planning had taught him patience—he would not take that step until he secured Xijiang Province.  

His current rebellion was a calculated move to break free from the imperial court’s suspicion and control.  

"Old Zhang and Xiao Xiao are overreacting. I didn’t even tell them I single-handedly suppressed the Great Mulberry Tree, preventing it from becoming a demonic entity," Zhou Qing muttered, shaking his head.  

The four of them reunited with Lady Lin in the city before proceeding to Taihe Mountain.  

---  

News of the Shang Family Fort incident reached the office of Tiannan Province’s governor.  

Song He was astounded.  

"A lone man infiltrated the fort and beheaded Shang Bing?"  

He turned to Yong Hu, the martial monk from Golden Light Temple beside him, his expression one of disbelief.  

"Are Xiantian experts truly so formidable?"  

Yong Hu replied, "This subordinate cannot say. But since the deed is confirmed, regardless of how it was done, it was done."  

A look of admiration crossed Yong Hu’s face. This was the true essence of a martial artist.  

Yet such heights were beyond his reach. As his master Zhiwen had predicted, this man would sweep across the world, unstoppable.  

Over a year ago, Zhang Jingxiu had shaken the realm with his Xiantian prowess.  

Now, Zhou Qing’s name resounded everywhere!  

---  

The Shang Family’s patriarch, though weathered by decades of turmoil, could not hide his sorrow.  

Of his three sons, two were missing, and the least capable had brought ruin upon himself, ending headless.  

Yet when facing Zhou Qing, the old minister composed himself, studying the young man intently.  

"Junior Zhou Qing pays his respects to the Grand Secretary."  

The hall was tense, guards and experts on edge. This ghostly, formidable man had returned.  

Would he slaughter them all?  

Unlike his arrogant third son, the Grand Secretary had always been benevolent, avoiding feuds and fostering goodwill. He had even recommended political rivals without claiming credit.  

Only years later would those men learn from the emperor who had truly endorsed them.  

His reputation was impeccable—his eldest son was cautious in office, the second guarded the borders. Only the third had been the black sheep.  

But Zhou Qing knew better.  

A family of such wealth could not be spotless.  

For every virtuous man, there was a villain. Shang Bing had chosen his path.  

"Scholar Zhou, I thank you for allowing me to see the New Year before your visit."  

"You honor me, Grand Secretary. Today, I come only to settle matters. I trust you now see the situation clearly and will cooperate."  

The Grand Secretary nodded. "I’ve inventoried the fort’s vaults. Take what you will. But let this grudge end here."  

The guards and experts were stunned. Their lord had spent days organizing the family’s wealth—only to surrender it?  

Zhou Qing said, "A true man distinguishes enmity from justice. So long as no one from the Shang family troubles me again, this matter is closed. As for the vaults, the Black Tiger Gang will handle them."  

He did not ask what treasures or rare herbs lay within. Such details were beneath him now. Setting the course was enough; his subordinates would manage the rest.  

To micromanage would hinder his cultivation.  

He knew the final resolution of this feud lay with the Grand Secretary. Hence, he had granted the old man face by waiting until after the New Year.  

And he had come alone—a display of supreme confidence in his abilities.  

The Grand Secretary was no fool. With two sons missing and one dead, clinging to the family’s wealth would only invite disaster.  

At over eighty, he had no time to groom a new heir.  

In these chaotic times, without a strong leader, such wealth was a curse. With Shang Bing gone, the provinces once loyal to the Shangs would soon turn predatory.  

Next, the Grand Secretary engaged Zhou Qing in scholarly discourse, as if the latter had not slain his son.  

The guards and experts were baffled.  

Was Shang Bing not his flesh and blood? The way they spoke, one might think Zhou Qing was the favored son.  

Zhou Qing marveled inwardly. To calmly negotiate despite an irreconcilable grudge—this was the mark of a true politician, a fox of a thousand years.  

As he saw Zhou Qing off, the Grand Secretary sighed softly.  

"Bing’er, your father failed you. But I did right by the Shang family. In the netherworld, I shall atone."  

Gazing at Zhou Qing’s retreating figure, he felt both hatred and envy. Had such a man been born a Shang, the empire might have borne their name.  

A pity.  

---  

Over the fort’s walls, Zhou Qing rejoined Zhishan.  

"Junior Uncle, you’re finally out!" Zhishan exhaled in relief.  

Though he had brought the two elder Daoists as backup, he had still feared for Zhou Qing’s safety.  

"Your tone suggests you doubted I’d return," Zhou Qing said with an eye roll. His senior apprentice-nephew truly lacked tact—no wonder Fuso found him irritating.  

"My apologies, Junior Uncle. I misspoke."  

Zhishan dared not argue, though the exchange felt familiar—Fuso had often treated him the same way.  

His junior uncle was indeed extraordinary, entering and exiting the Shang Family Fort’s den of tigers unscathed.  

But if Zhou Qing was so confident, why had he asked for the elders’ presence?  

Zhishan hesitated to ask.  

Zhou Qing sensed his thoughts. "Grandmaster Zhang’s succession ceremony is a grand event for the Taihe Sect. It wouldn’t do for our two elders to miss it. Besides, I’ve heard the great pine of Taihe Mountain has grown sinister. A perfect chance for them to witness it."  

Zhishan nodded, though Zhou Qing’s explanation still felt incomplete.  

But with Zhou Qing and the three elders present, no supernatural force would dare stir.  

If there was a problem, it surely stemmed from the Great Mulberry Tree.  

Zhou Qing conveniently forgot he had sent a mulberry branch to Xiao Ruowang.  

And even if he were at fault, wasn’t the tree the greater culprit?  

"Old Zhang and Xiao Xiao overreact. I didn’t even tell them I single-handedly suppressed the Great Mulberry Tree, preventing it from becoming a demonic entity," Zhou Qing muttered again, shaking his head.  

The group reunited with Lady Lin and set off for Taihe Mountain.  

---  

The Shang Family Fort incident reached the Tiannan Province governor’s office.  

Song He was astounded.  

"A lone man infiltrated the fort and beheaded Shang Bing?"  

He turned to Yong Hu, the martial monk from Golden Light Temple beside him, his expression one of disbelief.
