# Chapter 56: Severing a Finger as a Lesson

Beiyang was located in Liang territory. 

The fastest route to Western Qin would naturally be to cut straight through Zheng territory. However, Dou Changsheng immediately dismissed this option. The longest detour would be heading south through the capital, down to Jiangnan, then crossing the river to Western Qin. 

This route would require multiple river crossings, including traversing the mighty Yangtze River that stretched east-west and divided the continent. Zheng territory was Chen Qingyao's fiefdom—his stronghold. Since Dou Changsheng was trying to avoid Chen's surveillance, he chose to travel north first before turning west into Western Qin. 

Beiyang was a place of trouble, and Dou Changsheng had no desire to linger. However, the prince's residence was located within the city walls, forcing him to wait until dawn when the gates opened before he could depart.

As morning light broke, Dou Changsheng carefully rolled up the calligraphy scroll in his hands—a piece featuring the characters for "Loyalty" and "Monarch." While he dared not study the "Loyalty" character too closely, the "Monarch" character held no such taboos. 

For days now, he had been contemplating this artwork. Initially, he thought the "Thirteen Swords of Geng Metal" inscribed behind the characters were merely Chen Qingyao's playful addition after learning he practiced the Infinite Sword Art. But upon studying the swordsmanship technique, Dou Changsheng realized Chen had spoken true—these thirteen sword forms were intrinsically connected to the essence of the "Monarch" character. 

The Thirteen Swords of Geng Metal emphasized presence—not the presence of a gentleman, but that of a ruler. This was the aura of an emperor. Each day of contemplation brought Dou Changsheng new insights.

As he carefully stored the scroll back into its cylindrical case and packed it away, a sudden realization struck him: This artwork was Chen Qingyao's copy, yet it perfectly captured the artistic conception of the Heavenly Ranking master Three Mountain Elder. That Chen could replicate such imperial majesty so convincingly revealed the true ambition in his heart.

Silently slipping out of the prince's residence, Dou Changsheng made his way toward the city gates. Only when he stepped beyond the city walls did the tension in his chest finally ease. 

In the past, his notorious bad luck would have inevitably drawn him into some conflict. But now, with a "good little sister" to share his burdens, things had finally normalized somewhat.

Once outside the city, Dou Changsheng followed the northern highway. He couldn't help but lament the fine horse he'd lost during the Three Yang Mountain incident—now he was reduced to traveling on foot. 

After half a day's journey, he spotted a roadside tea stall ahead. Normally, he would never stop at such places in the wilderness—they were practically invitations for trouble. But this stretch of highway showed increasing traffic, indicating proximity to another city. Such stalls were common here, offering weary travelers respite—cool tea in summer, warm drinks in autumn.

Approaching the stall, Dou Changsheng selected an empty table. He placed his Hero's Sword on the wooden surface and removed the pack from his back, ordering simple fare while planning his next moves. After this brief rest, he'd purchase a horse in the city or perhaps join a merchant caravan. 

Traveling solely on foot wasn't just slow—it wasted precious time. Even a bumpy carriage ride would allow him to study his scroll or contemplate martial techniques in peace.

No sooner had he sat down than a nearby martial artist abruptly stood up. The sudden movement triggered a chain reaction, drawing all eyes toward the man—including Dou Changsheng's, whose hand instinctively moved to his sword hilt. He wasn't alone; most patrons at roadside stalls were armed travelers ready for trouble.

The standing man was of medium height with a slender build and unusually long fingers that now gripped the center of his sword sheath. His piercing gaze locked onto Dou Changsheng, burning with intensity as he declared:

"Infinite Sword Lord Dou Changsheng—ranked seventy-ninth on the Human Rankings! An honor to meet you."

"I am Gao Yang of Beiyang. I challenge you!"

Understanding dawned in Dou Changsheng's eyes. When Gao Yang first stood, he'd feared being dragged into another conflict. But this was simply the inevitable consequence of making the Human Rankings—a battleground of fame where every listed expert faced challengers seeking quick advancement.

For the unknown, defeating a ranked opponent was the fastest path to recognition. The next ranking update would automatically promote the victor. As a newcomer ranked seventy-ninth, Dou Changsheng knew some would doubt his standing. While the wise recognized his strength, fools would always exist—and this was his first challenger.

Rising slowly, Dou Changsheng studied Gao Yang carefully. Anyone daring to challenge the seventy-ninth rank possessed some skill—this man had clearly reached the Five Qi stage of the Innate True Realm, likely having condensed at least one of the Three Flowers. In terms of cultivation, they were evenly matched.

But the age difference was stark—Gao Yang appeared at least twenty-eight, possibly twenty-nine. This displeased Dou Changsheng; such challengers clearly saw his youth as weakness, viewing him as an easy stepping stone to fame.

Scanning the surroundings, he noticed the excited crowd—spectators clearly eager for this duel. Murmurs identified his opponent as "Gale Sword Gao Yang," ranked one hundredth on the Human Rankings.

Securing his pack and gripping Hero's Sword, Dou Changsheng moved to an open area. Gao Yang had already drawn his weapon—an unusual thin blade resembling a thick steel needle, about five chi long with the thickness of a pinky finger—a truly exotic weapon.

"Ready?" Dou Changsheng asked calmly.

Gao Yang flourished his slender sword and stepped forward. "Draw your blade! Let's see the difference between rank seventy-nine and one hundred!"

With a finger flick, Dou Changsheng released a three-chi-long sword aura infused with divine will that began permeating the surroundings. This was a strike that touched upon the realm of spiritual intent.

Gao Yang's fighting spirit wavered as his eyes glazed over with nostalgia, momentarily transported to memories of home. His sword arm hesitated—just as the aura sliced past.

A thumb tumbled to the ground, blood spraying from the severed stump. Pain jolted Gao Yang back to reality as he stared in shock at his maimed hand. 

"Such injustice!" he lamented inwardly. "One so young has already comprehended divine intent?"

Dou Changsheng's voice remained impassive. "This is the price for drawing steel against your superior."

His gaze swept across the gathered crowd as he posed a final question:

"Any other challengers?"
