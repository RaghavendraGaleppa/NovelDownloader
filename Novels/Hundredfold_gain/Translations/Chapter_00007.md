# Chapter 7: Effortless Mastery of Spells  

Qi Chuan carefully read through the Fireball Technique recorded in the Evergreen Manual, meticulously analyzing each character's meaning and comprehending its principles.  

As expected, when he finished, a line of text appeared before his eyes as anticipated:  

**[You diligently studied the Fireball Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggered a 10x critical effect, granting 10x rewards. Your understanding of the Fireball Technique has slightly improved.]**  

Immediately afterward, a stream of information flooded his mind—a partial comprehension of the Fireball Technique.  

After absorbing this knowledge, Qi Chuan could clearly sense that he had gained new insights into the technique. However, mastering spells was no easy feat. Even though the Fireball Technique was one of the most basic elemental spells, fully grasping it would still require considerable effort.  

Realizing he wasn’t yet capable of casting the spell, Qi Chuan decided to study it again with renewed focus.  

**[You diligently studied the Fireball Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggered a 2x critical effect, granting 2x rewards. Your understanding of the Fireball Technique has slightly improved.]**  

**[You diligently studied the Fireball Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggered a 5x critical effect, granting 5x rewards. Your understanding of the Fireball Technique has slightly improved.]**  

Through his relentless efforts, Qi Chuan’s understanding of the Fireball Technique rapidly deepened. It wouldn’t be long before he could successfully cast it.  

Three days later…  

**[You diligently studied the Fireball Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggered a 50x critical effect, granting 50x rewards. Your understanding of the Fireball Technique has significantly improved. You have successfully mastered the basics of the Fireball Technique.]**  

Qi Chuan’s eyes were slightly bloodshot. Over the past three days, aside from sparing some time to cultivate the Evergreen Manual and refine his spiritual energy, he had devoted nearly all his free time to mastering the Fireball Technique.  

His persistence bore fruit.  

As the text appeared before his eyes, another wave of profound understanding surged into his mind. Combined with his previous accumulation, it was as if he had completed a full circle. In that instant, Qi Chuan’s intuition guided his hands to form the necessary seals while he murmured the incantation.  

A stream of spiritual energy flowed from his dantian, coursing through specific meridians toward his hands. A faint glow emerged between his palms, gradually taking the shape of a sphere, radiating a faint but unmistakable heat.  

The next moment, as the incantation ended, he abruptly raised his hand.  

*Whoosh!*  

A bright flame burst to life in his palm, instantly illuminating the dim room that had previously been lit only by candlelight. Waves of scorching heat emanated from the fireball, distorting the air above it. Yet, despite the intense heat, Qi Chuan only felt a warm sensation—his own skin remained unharmed.  

**"This… is the Fireball Technique!"**  

Qi Chuan’s eyes gleamed as he gazed at the flickering flame in his palm. This was the first time he had successfully cast a spell since gaining spiritual energy—a feat that mortals would consider nothing short of divine.  

This was no ordinary fire. Formed from spiritual energy, it burned at an extreme temperature. A single fireball could reduce anything it touched to ashes in an instant.  

Now, Qi Chuan had truly stepped into the realm of an immortal practitioner, wielding genuine mystical abilities.  

**"But why is this fireball so small?"**  

Examining the flame in his palm, he noticed it was only the size of a red date, its crimson body wrapped in flickering dark embers. Moreover, it wasn’t entirely stable.  

As long as he focused, he could maintain the fireball, but the moment his concentration wavered, it flickered precariously, threatening to dissipate. Additionally, the drain on his spiritual energy was noticeable—he could feel his reserves dwindling.  

Withdrawing the energy supply, the tiny fireball vanished instantly.  

But just then, another line of text appeared before him:  

**[You successfully cast the Fireball Technique and maintained it for a period of time. Triggered a 3x critical effect, granting 3x rewards. Your proficiency in the Fireball Technique has slightly improved.]**  

Immediately, his mind was filled with additional insights—techniques for forming seals, reciting incantations, channeling spiritual energy, and shaping the fireball. It was as though he had cast the spell three times, naturally deepening his mastery.  

**"So, casting the spell also increases its proficiency."**  

Qi Chuan was delighted.  

This meant that by repeatedly casting and sustaining the Fireball Technique, he could leverage the hundredfold critical effect to rapidly improve his skill.  

According to the manual, proficiency in basic elemental spells—and indeed most common spells used in the Qi Refinement stage—was categorized into four levels: **Novice, Minor Mastery, Major Mastery, and Perfection.**  

Currently, his Fireball Technique was at the **Novice** stage. Under normal circumstances, advancing to **Minor Mastery** would take an unknown amount of time. After all, Qi Refinement cultivators—especially those in the early stages—had limited spiritual energy. Casting spells too many times would quickly deplete their reserves.  

Moreover, low-level cultivators had to divide their time between cultivation, refining their energy, and completing tasks to gather resources. Thus, most Qi Refinement cultivators likely only achieved **Novice** to **Minor Mastery** in their spells.  

Possessing even a single **Minor Mastery** spell could serve as a reliable trump card. And mastering multiple spells at that level would make one a formidable opponent, even without high-grade magical artifacts or talismans.  

Thanks to the hundredfold critical effect, Qi Chuan could achieve the same results with far less time and energy, accelerating his progress exponentially.  

**"But Minor Mastery is still a long way off. For now, I should focus on mastering the other four basic elemental spells."**  

His gaze shifted to the remaining four elemental techniques.  

**[You diligently studied the Water Arrow Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggered a 13x critical effect, granting 13x rewards. Your understanding of the Water Arrow Technique has slightly improved.]**  

Soon, another line of text appeared before him, followed by a fresh stream of knowledge—this time, a partial comprehension of the Water Arrow Technique.
