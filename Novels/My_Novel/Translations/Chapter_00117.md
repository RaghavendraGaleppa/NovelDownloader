# Chapter 117: The Twin Swords Merge, the Mistress's Heart is Troubled

The position of Commander carried great responsibility, yet it was relatively relaxed. After Li Xian took office, he arranged everything perfectly and never made a mistake.

Days passed idly.

A few more days went by.

Li Xian had the idea to select another martial art to cultivate meticulously.

Currently, his [Four Directions Fist], [Breeze Leg], and [Emerald Luo Palm] had all reached their peak, and his Qi Lake was already four zhang and seven chi wide. Among martial artists of his age, this was certainly considered abundant.

He practiced the [Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword] every day.

However, this sword technique was incomplete. Practicing it for too long made his body feel dry and hot. Li Xian could endure the heat and force himself to practice, but the path of martial arts emphasized steady, step-by-step progress. Rather than continuing in such a manner, it was better to cultivate another martial art as a调剂 (adjustment), to enrich his martial arts attainments.

As the Commander, the basic martial arts of the One Union Manor were under his management.

Naturally, he could take them at will.

After much selection, Li Xian chose a manual called [Soaring Cloud Hand].

This was a rather miscellaneous martial art, focusing solely on training the hands. If practiced well, its uses were endless. It could be used as a fist technique, finger technique, or palm technique. Of course... precisely because of this, it was somewhat of a jack-of-all-trades, master of none.

Pang Long had also learned the "Soaring Cloud Hand," but he never recommended it to the guards to practice. Of the four hundred guards, not a single one knew the Soaring Cloud Hand, and no one had even heard of it.

The reason was simple: this martial art was too杂 (miscellaneous) and chaotic, difficult to master deeply. Having guards practice it would be no different from harming them.

It seemed powerful, but was actually useless.

Li Xian, however, was intrigued.

He took the martial art manual and practiced it whenever he had time.

All basic martial arts were not difficult to入门 (get started). The Soaring Cloud Hand was even easier; Li Xian got started in just half an hour.

[Soaring Cloud Hand]

[Proficiency: 26/500 Beginner]

[Description: A basic martial art with a wide range of applications. However, its skills in throwing hidden weapons, pickpocketing, and finger probing are solid.]

[Proficiency +1]

[Proficiency +1]

Li Xian practiced according to the method: first, he collected tree sap, mixed it with some herbal medicine, and boiled it over a large fire.

He made a pot of thick sap. He sprinkled black sesame seeds into it, then used his fingers to pick them out one by one.

This trained his fundamentals, opening up the bones in his hands.

Although this martial art was basic, it was extremely particular. The practitioner's fingers were better suited the longer and more slender they were. Li Xian was born with a pair of exquisite hands, with distinct knuckles, fair and slender, which were very compatible with this martial art.

In this way, Li Xian cultivated two martial arts simultaneously: Soaring Cloud Hand and the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword.

They progressed together, and the improvements were noticeable. In between... he would also occasionally review and gain new insights, practicing the Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, and Emerald Luo Palm.

He contemplated in his mind, gradually patching up the flaws in the Emerald Luo Palm.

Three days passed, and the [Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword] finally entered the [Proficient] stage.

[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword·First Layer]

[Proficiency: 34/3000 Proficient]

The Qi Lake within his body, after a long period of accumulation, had reached five zhang and one chi.

But at the same time, Li Xian felt increasingly burned, and the breath he exhaled was slightly scalding.

[Soaring Cloud Hand]

[Proficiency: 114/1000 Proficient]

In comparison, the Soaring Cloud Hand was much easier.

Li Xian did not just practice martial arts blindly. Occasionally, when he had free time, he would brew a cup of clear tea and admire the scenery in the courtyard.

During this season, a type of flower planted near his residence bloomed. It was very vibrant, with a fragrance that filled the air, attracting bees and butterflies.

Madam Wen was difficult to serve; she would issue task requirements from time to time. Li Xian tried his best to fulfill them. Madam Wen did praise him a few times, saying openly that Li Xian's ability far surpassed Pang Long's.

Days passed in this way.

One day.

As Li Xian's [Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword] grew more advanced, he began to feel his blood burning. He had no choice but to seek out the Madam.

"Wait here. The Madam is in seclusion."

In front of the Tranquil Heart Pagoda.

Qiu Yue stopped Li Xian and told him to wait on the spot.

He waited for half a day.

It was not until late at night that the Madam came down from the pagoda. Li Xian stepped forward to greet her, saying, "Madam, I have something I wish to ask for advice." The Madam said, "What is it?"

Li Xian said, "It is about the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword."

"You have only been practicing for a month; it is normal for your progress to be slightly slow. There is no need to be anxious. Just go back and practice slowly." Madam Wen waved her hand, already dismissing him.

"Madam, I do not know if my progress is fast or slow, but recently when practicing the sword, my swordplay has become increasingly smooth, yet my body feels very hot and uncomfortable." Li Xian pretended not to know the secret of the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword.

"Oh?"

Madam Wen heard Li Xian say his body felt hot. This was a sign that the "Yang Sword" had been mastered, and his attainments were growing daily.

The Yang-Yin Immortal Couple Sword was a superior combined sword technique. It was created by an ancient pair of immortal lovers. Legend has it that the couple were deeply in love throughout their lives, inseparable.

Therefore, the true method of practicing this sword technique required a man and woman to practice together. As they progressed, they even needed to be honest and open, blending together like milk and water, naturally.

Thus, if one practiced this sword technique alone, practicing the Yang Sword would cause heat to burn the body, while practicing the Yin Sword would cause cold energy to numb the body.

Madam Wen reached out and pinched Li Xian's pulse. She felt his pulse was strong, filled with a scorching Yang energy. Where did this Yang energy come from? It came from the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword.

She felt very strange in her heart: "Li Xian has just come into contact with a superior martial art, and with no one to guide him, he has actually made such progress? Compared to some prodigies, this speed is average. But it seems he has practiced very solidly, without a single mistake."

She was both surprised and found it understandable. It was unexpected, yet reasonable.

Madam Wen had seen much and knew many martial arts prodigies. Among them, there were those with exceptional talent, a clear martial heart. With just one glance, they could master a martial art, or even become proficient in it.

Li Xian, in less than a month, had practiced the Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword to proficiency. Looking at Qingning County, he was a top-tier genius. But looking at Qiongfu Prefecture, he was just average.

But...

The true difficulty of martial arts has never been the speed of practice. But the stability of progress.

No matter how talented and powerful you are. You can master it at a glance, become proficient, or even achieve minor success. But often, such prodigies are the most likely to be trapped by a bottleneck.

A bottleneck that could last a lifetime.

Madam Wen naturally did not know Li Xian's unique advantage.

"You have only just begun practicing the sword, yet you have such attainments. It is quite good." Madam Wen praised, sizing up Li Xian again.

Compared to a month ago... Li Xian was different again.

His hair had grown much longer, but it was neatly tied up at the back of his head. Sideburns were left on both sides of his forehead, giving him a youthful and heroic air. His eyebrows were like distant mountains, hiding a sharp edge yet appearing open and aboveboard. His eyes shone with a sharp light, and his entire presence was much more spirited.

"With this appearance, although his origins are lowly, if I take him out, he won't lose my face." Madam Wen became increasingly satisfied, especially thinking that this boy had a clear background and his loyalty was evident. He was almost her own possession.

She said, "Follow me."

The two moved to another location.

There was no one around, and the moonlight was lonely.

A gentle breeze blew.

Madam Wen said, "Your situation is actually a sign that the sword technique has gone astray. You were too eager for quick results, so you deserved this calamity. I will guide you, and these symptoms will naturally be resolved."

Li Xian thought to himself: "This wicked woman, not a word of truth comes out of her mouth."

Madam Wen brought two long swords and handed one to Li Xian.

Li Xian asked in confusion, "Madam, are you going to personally demonstrate the sword for me?" Madam Wen said, "I guided you into this, though I am not your master, I will not be stingy with these instructions. I will use the sword to guide you; you just need to execute the sword techniques."

Her eyes, however, were very bright.

She had obtained this sword technique early on and knew its extraordinary nature. When the twin swords merge, the power they unleash even surpasses that of a superior sword technique.

She had coveted it in her early years and forcefully practiced the Yin chapter, which caused Yin energy to stagnate in her body. It took a great deal of effort later to barely resolve it.

Since then, she had always wanted to practice this sword technique. But she had no one to practice with, so it had been left unused. When she taught Li Xian the Yang Sword, she hadn't thought so much; she just wanted to use the sword technique to control Li Xian.

Making him unable to leave or escape.

But seeing Li Xian's good progress, her past thoughts gradually became active again.

"Use the 'Shatter Yang Form' and attack me."

Madam Wen wore a white dress, looking cold and clear in the moonlight. She held her sword with the hilt down and the tip up.

Li Xian nodded and executed the Shatter Yang Form to attack. He had only learned the Yang Sword and did not know how to merge them. The method of merging was entirely in Madam Wen's hands.

Madam Wen's sword moved lightly, her posture graceful. She used the "Spin Yin Form" to block. The Shatter Yang Form emphasized刚猛 (fierceness), while the Spin Yin Form emphasized柔黏 (softness and stickiness). The moment the two swords crossed, a clear sound resonated.

Both sword holders felt a tremor in their hearts.

Their minds were drawn to the sword, and they felt as if they were touching each other intimately.

The combined sword technique was truly different. Even if the two had no intention of it, the moment they executed it together, their minds would be drawn along.

Madam Wen felt a strange sensation: "I never expected that after dominating for decades, I would be practicing the twin sword merge with such a young boy today. If this got out, my reputation as the 'Sword-breaking Madam' would be ruined. But..."

She didn't have time to think too much. Following the flow, she guided Li Xian into the second move. Madam Wen felt a slight itch in her heart. At this moment, they seemed to be practicing against each other, but in reality, they were merging their swords.

Their swords crossed several times.

Li Xian's burning sensation faded a lot. His whole body felt relaxed, and there was a pleasant and comfortable feeling. The broken sword was now complete, and it was all unleashed at once. At this moment, he was executing the sword naturally, and his mind had forgotten everything outside the sword techniques.

Li Xian sent three consecutive sword strikes. This was the "Three Yangs Bring Prosperity" move from the "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword." Li Xian sent his Qi, and the sword body flashed with red light, which was very impressive.

"Good sword!" Madam Wen praised, controlling her strength to parry the corresponding moves. When their sword edges met, they produced a sticky sensation. A Yin energy and a Yang energy seemed to be in confrontation, but were actually dancing together.

The subtleties in the sword were countless.

Li Xian's "burning" sensation completely disappeared. Instead, he felt his body was light, as if bathed in a mysterious power, and his body was much stronger.

This was also the effect of the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword."

Superior martial arts... looking across the Great Wu Empire, they were also rare treasures. The power of these martial arts was not just in the killing power of the sword techniques. But in the unimaginable effects they brought while practicing the sword techniques.

It was said that the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple" had a long lifespan. It was all thanks to this set of sword techniques.

"Madam, I will be rude!" Li Xian cleared his mind of distracting thoughts and completely let go. Madam Wen was usually indifferent, but at this moment she also showed a hint of joy, "Just come at me."

To outsiders, Li Xian's words "I will be rude" would be laughable. How could he offend Wen Caishang. Madam Wen's words "just come at me" would also be confusing.

But the two in the midst of the swordplay were natural and unrestrained.

[Twin swords merge, Yin and Yang complement each other, two energies penetrate the body, Proficiency +100]

[Twin swords merge,牵动神思 (stirring the mind), Proficiency +152]

When they were crossing swords, their eyes would sometimes meet. Li Xian's mind was clear, so it wasn't much. But Madam Wen felt a strange, prickly sensation that was hard to ignore.

When they executed the "Dividing the Two Forms" move.

This sword technique contained both Yin and Yang swords. Executed together, the tips of the swords cleverly touched the same spot. Then they turned their wrists in unison, the sword bodies circcling, clinging to each other, and the swords emitted the same light hum.

This was originally a very clever defensive sword technique.

But at this point, it carried an indescribable meaning. At the end, the two swords were actually entangled together.

"Having received this guidance, do you feel any relief?" Madam Wen withdrew from the sword stance, turned her back, and said calmly.

Li Xian's mind was filled only with the joy of progress in the sword technique. He cupped his fist and said: "Thank you for your guidance, Madam. It is indeed much better."

"Mm."

Madam Wen said, "Practice your sword diligently, do not let it fall into disuse. If you run into trouble again, come find me."
