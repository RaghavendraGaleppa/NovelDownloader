# Chapter 95: My Brother is the Child of Fortune

There's no denying that Lin Fan's flying boat was truly a top-tier magical artifact. Aside from its voracious appetite for spirit stones, its performance and endurance were absolutely impeccable—accelerating to a hundred kilometers in less than two breaths!

However, thanks to the time he'd bought to recover underground, Monk Xingtai had managed to temporarily suppress some of his injuries. Gradually, he regained the flight speed of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, pushing his limits to the extreme. His speed actually began to match that of the flying boat.

No matter how skillfully Lin Shan maneuvered, straight-line flight ultimately came down to raw power. The monk was, after all, a Foundation Establishment cultivator. If he was truly determined to flee for his life, catching up would be no easy feat.

This was precisely why, in the cultivation world, the mortality rate among Foundation Establishment cultivators was far lower than that of Qi Refinement cultivators. Moreover, they rarely made enemies of their peers. After all, if they couldn't win a fight, they could simply flee on their magical artifacts. Unless you specialized in escape techniques, failing to eliminate them immediately would inevitably lead to endless trouble.

Lin Shan and Lin Fan now found themselves in this very predicament. If they didn't seize this opportunity to kill the old monk, how could they possibly endure the constant threat of a Foundation Establishment cultivator lurking in the shadows?

Lin Fan's face twisted with hesitation as he rummaged through his storage bag, which seemed to contain an endless trove of treasures. Finally, he pulled out a jade-green flute.

With a pained expression, Lin Fan lamented, "This Soul-Seduction Flute is a one-time-use magical artifact. I was originally saving it for those two Black Flood Dragons our sect keeps, hoping to coax them into producing a dragon spirit egg for me. Wouldn't that have been perfect?"

He sighed helplessly, feeling that he'd already sacrificed too much for this "Ancient Treasure Map." He could only hope the eventual payoff would justify his investment.

Without further hesitation, he turned sideways, pointing the flute's mouth toward the fleeing Monk Xingtai, and began to play.

A series of strange, intoxicating notes filled the air, suffusing the surroundings with an ambiguous and peculiar atmosphere. Unfortunately, Lin Fan failed to notice that the flute's tail was inadvertently aimed at Lin Shan, who was steering the flying boat.

Lin Shan suddenly felt a powerful melody assault his mind, igniting a primal urge that surged through his body. His blood pressure skyrocketed as visions of ethereal, half-veiled fairies danced before his eyes, their sleeves fluttering like clouds, their gazes brimming with affection.

His grip on the control lever faltered, and the flying boat began to wobble precariously in the sky.

"What the hell, Lin Fan? What are you doing?"

"Ah! My bad, first time using this—got the direction wrong," Lin Fan hastily apologized, realizing he'd accidentally targeted his ally. He quickly adjusted his position, this time pointing the flute's mouth outward and its tail inward, and resumed his playing.

Fortunately, he got it right this time. The old monk, who had been fleeing with all his might, suddenly began to sway unsteadily, as if struggling to suppress something. He even started chanting sutras to steady his mind.

The Soul-Seduction Flute bore some resemblance to the silver foil the monk had used earlier—both targeted the soul. However, while the silver foil directly attacked the soul, the flute merely induced an aphrodisiac illusion.

Lin Shan couldn't help but admire the monk's resilience. Despite his own earlier struggle to resist the flute's effects, Monk Xingtai was managing to keep flying through sheer willpower and Buddhist mantras.

Meanwhile, Lin Fan puffed his cheeks with all his might, blowing into the flute with unwavering confidence.

The chase continued for roughly the time it takes an incense stick to burn. Eventually, the old monk could no longer suppress his internal injuries and spat out a mouthful of blood, his chanting abruptly ceizing.

Seizing the opportunity, Lin Fan blew into the flute with such force that his cheeks bulged like a frog's. Lin Shan winced, half-expecting his brother's mouth to explode from the effort.

The monk's flight became increasingly erratic, his body swaying as if he'd drunk counterfeit liquor, his movements resembling an epileptic fit. He seemed to be resorting to self-harm to resist, but Lin Fan—the so-called "Treasure Boy"—was confident his efforts were futile.

Monk Xingtai's vision blurred, his legs weakened, and his mind succumbed to the intoxicating melody. Images of seductive beauties flashed through his consciousness like slides, their alluring whispers and teasing laughter filling his ears.

"Form is emptiness, emptiness is form; sensation, perception, volition, and consciousness are likewise empty..."

But his chanting grew fainter, drowned out by the sultry laughter of the illusory women. Their breath was fragrant, their touches provocative. A scorching heat surged through him—whether from his internal fire poison or his own arousal, he couldn't tell.

To his utter disbelief, despite his 150 years of age, he found himself... aroused.

"Shameless brats! How dare you humiliate this old monk so!" Monk Xingtai cried out in despair before finally losing control.

His spiritual energy ran wild, and his magical artifact could no longer sustain his flight. From several thousand meters in the air, he plummeted headfirst toward the ground.

The flying boat gracefully banked and followed his descent.

At the foot of a mountainside on the outskirts of the Joy Sect ruins, amidst the shattered remnants of a palace plaza, two young men in white robes stood over a corpse shattered into pieces.

"Truly worthy of a Buddhist Foundation Establishment cultivator. His Vajra Body is as hard as iron. If it were us who fell from that height, we'd be nothing but a bloody pulp by now!"

"This is something to boast about—Qi Refinement cultivators killing a Foundation Establishment expert, and not just any ordinary one at that. Monk Xingtai was renowned among the rogue cultivators of Jiangdong for his mastery of multiple Buddhist techniques. Yet we still managed to turn the tables on him!"

"You lost quite a few treasures this time. Why don't you pick through his belongings first and see if you can recoup your losses?"

The brothers began inventorying their spoils. Monk Xingtai's storage bag contained over two thousand spirit stones, but his talismans and elixirs were completely depleted—likely consumed during his earlier use of the Heaven-Scorching Flame, a minor divine ability.

To Lin Shan's delight, the monk had spent the past six months collecting several Joy Buddha statues from the ruins, which unexpectedly provided him with 40 points of Ancient Charm—essentially doing his work for him.

As for the Buddhist techniques and insights they found, they were largely useless since they required cultivation of Buddhist methods to unleash their full potential.

The monk's high-grade magical artifact, the Golden Wheel, though damaged by the divine ability, was still functional. The set of high-grade flying needles and the silver foil were also intact, but Lin Shan let Lin Fan take them all, considering how much his brother had sacrificed.

The remaining two thousand spirit stones were split evenly between them.

Lin Shan was overjoyed with his share of over a thousand spirit stones—a veritable fortune. To Lin Fan, however, it was mere pocket change compared to the thrill of slaying a Foundation Establishment cultivator.

Feeling somewhat guilty that Lin Shan had taken only the spirit stones while he claimed the rest, Lin Fan tried to offer more. But Lin Shan insisted he'd already gained the greatest prize—the 40 points of Ancient Charm—though he couldn't openly admit it.

When Lin Shan attempted to return the high-grade Five Elements Fan to Lin Fan, his brother tossed it back with a dismissive wave.

"Brothers who fight side by side against a Foundation Establishment cultivator share everything," Lin Fan declared grandly. "Keep the fan for self-defense. I've got plenty of magical artifacts."

Lin Shan still felt bad, knowing Lin Fan had wasted a divine ability talisman that also served as a key to some ancient treasure vault. But Lin Fan brushed it off, insisting, "You're too poor, brother. How can you wander the cultivation world without a decent high-grade artifact? Once you reach Foundation Establishment, you'll be crushed by your peers without one."

After some back-and-forth, Lin Shan noticed Lin Fan's growing impatience and reluctantly accepted the fan, touched by his brother's generosity. Truly, blood ran thicker than water.

Lin Fan had not only taken the fall for him before but had also stood by him against a Foundation Establishment cultivator, sharing the spoils afterward.

[What's it like having a "Child of Fortune" as a brother?]

Lin Shan's answer: "Thanks for asking. Currently in Jiangdong, just disembarked from a flying boat. I'm quite qualified to speak on this matter."
