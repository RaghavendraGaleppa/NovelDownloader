# Chapter 242: Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art

Pei Yan suddenly let out a low laugh, filled with sorrow.

"The youngest Zhiming was only at the age of tying his hair when the flood dragon's claw pierced his chest... yet he continued to swing his sword."

Xu Yunfan remained silent, naturally understanding that the other's heart was as dead as ash.

Truly tragic.

One wrong thought, and the entire game was lost.

Twilight like blood, Pei Yan's knuckles dug deep into the rock crevices.

The afterimages of Xu Yunfan practicing his hammer technique were somewhat piercing to the eye. Amidst the sharp whistling of the heavy hammer tearing through the air, he seemed to hear the sound of bones breaking as the ninety disciples of Sword Pavilion fell into the flood dragon's belly.

Beside him, Qi Huan silently sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, the strands of demonic qi emanating from him making Pei Yan's heart grow increasingly anxious.

It wasn't until evening, just as Xu Yunfan prepared to cultivate the Lin Character Art, that Pei Yan suddenly raised his head, his gaze fixed tightly on Xu Yunfan, his eyes filled with a struggling pain.

"Brother Xu."

Pei Yan suddenly spoke, his vocal cords trembling slightly.

"The essence of Empty Bright Sword Cleansing..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan's feet stirred wind, and he appeared before Pei Yan in an instant.

The Red Flood Dragon Qi that had yet to settle around Xu Yunfan's body cracked the rock walls with turtle-shell patterns. He forcefully suppressed his joy, maintaining a calm expression on his face.

"Brother Pei has made up his mind?"

Pei Yan gazed intently at the surface of the heavy hammer in Xu Yunfan's hand, where faint collision marks could be seen.

He suddenly recalled the admonition stele before the Sword Pavilion's Chengtian Hall.

Sword bones would rather break than bend.

But what if they do break?

He lowered his head to look at the flood dragon poison writhing within the cracks of his chest armor, the dark green poison threads having already climbed up to the Celestial Prominence Acupoint.

When Elder Lingxu had taught him "Sword Qi Walks the Three Corners" back then, he had said that if the poison invaded the lung meridian after being poisoned, the sword heart would be clouded in light cases, and in severe cases, the sword qi would backlash and cause the body to explode.

"What method do you have to wash the flood dragon poison from my body?"

Pei Yan suddenly asked, his fingertips unconsciously stroking the air. At this moment, his heart was extremely conflicted and hesitant.

Xu Yunfan naturally dared not be the least bit careless. If Pei Yan jumped out of his stubborn thinking, then all efforts would be in vain.

He hated that he did not have the Soul Search Great Technique; otherwise, why would he need to go through such great trouble?

"Enough to wash away the flood dragon poison in your Three Corners."

The ginseng qi of the Ten Thousand Year Ginseng King, just a few strands would be enough to fully recover Pei Yan's injuries. If combined with earthfire burning, the flood dragon poison could soon be forced out of the body.

"I want you to swear by the Tiangong Cave!"

Pei Yan finally sat up straight, the struggling look in his eyes quickly calming down. He glanced quickly at Qi Huan, who was roasting meat nearby.

"I'll go pick some spices; what I collected today isn't enough."

Seeing this scene, Qi Huan didn't hesitate at all, flipped over and ran out of the cave, disappearing in a flash.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed. A swordsman who has made a decision naturally wouldn't easily change it.

"When my injuries recover, I can teach you the Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art."

Xu Yunfan's eyes narrowed slightly. "Brother Pei, are you trying to get something for nothing?"

Pei Yan remained silent, understanding that Xu Yunfan was someone who wouldn't let go of the prey without seeing the eagle. He then said, "The Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art is a prerequisite martial art for the Empty Bright Sword Cleansing Art. I can teach you this first. If you can't even cultivate the Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art, then let's not mention this matter. If you can succeed, I will teach you the Empty Bright Sword Cleansing Art, but you must swear! Swear by the Tiangong Cave!"

Xu Yunfan's expression turned solemn, suppressing the joy in his heart. This was absolutely a godsend opportunity. If the circumstances were different, even the Tiger and Leopard Thunder Sound Technique would be out of the question, let alone the Sword Pavilion's secret martial art, the Empty Bright Sword Cleansing Art.

He nodded. "Speak."

"Must not be passed on to others, must not mention this to anyone, must not reveal this method to anyone."

Pei Yan's eyelids drooped, carrying a somewhat deep tone, as if he had figured out some connection, a hint of a smile even hanging on his lips.

"Brother Xu, the Empty Bright Sword Cleansing Art is a true transmission secret method of the Sword Pavilion. Those not of the Sect Master's lineage cannot cultivate it. If it is discovered that it has been leaked, not only will I suffer disaster, but you, and your entire Tiangong Cave, will be utterly annihilated."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. Although these words were unpleasant to hear, what Pei Yan said was the truth. Once exposed, the one who would die wouldn't be Pei Yan, but him.

"Rest assured, Brother Pei."

Xu Yunfan immediately swore without hesitation by the Tiangong Cave and his own character.

"Grandmaster Tiangong Kaowu above! Disciple Xu Yunfan, if I violate the agreement of transmitting the Empty Bright Sword Cleansing Art... may I suffer the pain of the Red Flood Dragon's逆鳞 devouring my heart! May the major acupoints on my body generate festering sores and poison, my lung meridian feel as if pierced by a thousand needles, and the Three-Corner meridians rot inch by inch! May pus flow from my head, and sores grow on my feet, may my entire family in this life die out..."

The speed at which Xu Yunfan swore oaths made even Pei Yan's heart involuntarily raise some doubts.

By the time Xu Yunfan finished those vicious words, which even he had never heard before, he began to doubt if he had been too harsh.

Pei Yan coughed dryly a few times, a rare look of embarrassment appearing on his face.

"That's enough. I will now teach you the Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art. If you can achieve entry within a month, then everything will be as said."

Achieving entry within a month would already be considered a sword dao genius. Xu Yunfan used a hammer, so he was definitely a layman in sword dao.

This was also a psychological comfort for Pei Yan himself; he ultimately needed to find some reasons to cross the hurdle in his heart.

Seeing the embarrassed expression on Pei Yan's face, Xu Yunfan curled his lips. In this life, he was originally a lone man, with no direct relatives to protect.

"Listen well: Tian Tu Condenses Frost, Sword Soul Born; Tan Zhong Refines True Essence in an Alchemy Cauldron; Golden Fluid and Jade Liquid Pass the Heavy Tower; Xuanji Hangs Upside Down, Twelve Peaks; Ren Meridian as Sheath, Hides Autumn Water; Chong Meridian as Furnace, Quenches Cold Stars; Qi Walks the Canopy, Observing Self; Sword Knocks on Purple Mansion, Listening to Dragon's Roar..."

An hour later, after reciting the final cultivation method, Pei Yan had to take a sip of water to moisten his throat and asked, "Did you remember it?"

Xu Yunfan glanced at a line of information floating in his vision.

'You have been taught the Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art'

'Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art (Not Yet入门)'

Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed. Practicing the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer for the past few days had been somewhat exhausting. Now that he had a mental cultivation method, it could help ease his mind.

"I remember."

"Anything you need me to clarify?"

"None for now. I'll practice first."

Hearing Xu Yunfan's casual agreement.

A hint of mockery flashed in Pei Yan's eyes. When he cultivated the Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art back then, it took him a full three days to understand the cultivation method, and another seven days to achieve entry.

Although Xu Yunfan's talent was not bad, and he could be called the number one in Tiangong Cave, within the Six Major Sects, his talent was nothing remarkable.

A genius among geniuses, a demon among demons.

He, Pei Yan, belonged to the demon category with innate sword bones!

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to pay him any mind. Once he achieved entry in a day, it would surely shatter Pei Yan's Dao Heart.

He immediately left the cave, casually broke a branch to use as a long sword, and began to ponder the Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art.

This Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art required flesh and blood to derive qi strength before it could be cultivated. No wonder Pei Yan was compared to those from the Celestial Pivot Gate who refined true qi through unorthodox methods like the Holy Maiden of Birthing. Being able to derive qi strength just from the external three harmonies was truly extraordinary.

The so-called Three-Corner Sword Nurturing Art is to use the Three-Corner meridians as a sword sheath and sword furnace, continuously quenching and nurturing a single strand of sword qi.

With the Red Flood Dragon Coiling Mountain Strength as a foundation, Xu Yunfan was confident he could achieve entry very quickly.
