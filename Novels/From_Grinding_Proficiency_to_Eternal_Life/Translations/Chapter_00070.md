# Chapter 70: Wielding the Divine Weapon

His exceptionally calm eyes, like stagnant water, turned to gaze at Wan Miaoyin, forming an extreme contrast with the violent changes happening to his body.

Wan Miaoyin's heart trembled.

She had only seen eyes like these once before, when her master had taken her to the Great Heavenly Palace and she had looked upon its palace master.

Her lips parted slightly as if to say something, but watching the gilded mace growing larger before her eyes, she ultimately closed them.

The gilded mace shattered the void, its wind whipping up her trailing twelve-panel "Fairy Skirt."

*Thud!*

In an instant, her brain matter burst forth. Wan Miaoyin's head was completely shattered by this divine weapon, leaving her a headless corpse. Her body swayed for a moment before collapsing onto the ground.

*Clang!*

The gilded mace, stained with brain matter and shattered bone, rolled to the ground.

Three breaths.

Xu Yunfan's body, having exited the *Lin* character state, deflated like a deflated balloon. He knelt on one knee among the corpses, the maroon veins beneath his cracked skin visibly shrinking. Black sandalwood-resin-like scabs seeped from the fissures in his flesh all over his body. He looked at his fingers, which were cracked and bleeding; it wasn't just his hands, but his entire body, even his cheeks, were similarly afflicted.

The gilded mace had forcibly挖掘 (excavated) his body's potential, expanding it to its peak within a short time, and was now receding to his mortal form like a tide retreating from the shore.

His bones and tendons, originally as resonant as jade, now felt like mountain rock whose dragon vein had been extracted. When his fingertips touched his side ribs, he could even feel the hollow cavities and the ribs themselves.

After this ordeal, he had visibly lost quite a bit of weight.

Xu Yunfan exhaled with lingering fear. If he had continued to wield it forcibly, his body would have faced irreversible collapse.

The final outcome was clear to see.

After resting for the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Xu Yunfan, finally regaining some strength, rummaged through his bundle to pull out black clothes and trousers and put them on. He wrapped the gilded mace in the black cloth that had covered the pot-shaped hammers and strapped it to his back.

Now, he could only wield this divine weapon while in the *Lin* character state. In his normal state, he couldn't even touch it and could only carry it on his back while separated by the Extreme Dao Remnant.

Even so, he could still feel the wisps of scorching heat emanating from the gilded mace.

A divine weapon!

Truly terrifying.

And this was a fierce weapon that had gone through countless battles, absorbing the killing intent of the battlefield. If an ordinary person touched it, their mind would be shattered by the killing intent, driving them completely insane.

If he hadn't had the Extreme Dao Remnant and the mastered *Lin* character诀 (technique), he would have already died from the weapon's backlash.

The attribute panel in his vision was almost scrolling with information.

Most of it was prompts for the increase in proficiency of the Red Refining Copper Body Cloak Hammer, interspersed with increases in the usage proficiency of the Flying Leg technique.

It had increased by almost two hundred points of proficiency.

Life and death situations truly yield great rewards.

Glancing at Wan Miaoyin's headless corpse, which still possessed a unique beauty, Xu Yunfan stepped forward and searched it, finding only some silver bills and nothing else.

As for the old monk who had turned into a monster, he had already completely turned into a paste of flesh mixed with the surrounding earth and stones; there was no need to search him.

Oh, right, there was also the Mountain Stabilizing Pearl.

Xu Yunfan's spirit stirred as he carefully recalled the direction the Mountain Stabilizing Pearl had flown. Just as he was about to search for it, he saw the pearl suddenly fly out from the jungle. It circled Wan Miaoyin's corpse once, then turned into a stream of light and vanished into the horizon in an instant.

Its speed was so fast that Xu Yunfan didn't even have time to react.

This divine weapon had an owner.

His expression changed slightly. He looked down at himself, confirming that his black clothes and trousers covered him completely, hiding most of his face. Without the slightest hesitation, he quickly left the place.

Two hours later, the moonlight was shattered into jade dust filling the courtyard.

An old man in a white Daoist robe, with white hair but a childlike face, stepped on a line of mountain mist and arrived. The strands of aura falling from his temples left three-inch-deep pits in the earth and stones around him.

The twelve layers of cloud patterns behind him were collapsing and dispersing; this was the price of using the Celestial Pivot secret technique to travel. Each wisp of qi carried killing intent.

Looking at Wan Miaoyin's headless corpse not far away, the old man's gaze was as cold as cold iron. He stared fixedly, not blinking.

The hanging cuff of his sleeve, the Mountain Stabilizing Pearl was still spinning restlessly around his wrist.

He saw the residual black killing intent at the severed neck of Wan Miaoyin's corpse. The cut was neither smooth nor rough, but showed a strange texture like meteoric iron melted through ice, clearly the work of a peerless fierce weapon that had accumulated enough battlefield killing intent.

"Miaoyin..."

The old man slowly knelt down, picking up Wan Miaoyin's corpse and holding it horizontally. Now, her body had been churned by the killing intent, leaving not even a trace of aura to track.

From the scene, however, the opponent used a heavy weapon.

In the suffocating silence where all sounds seemed to freeze, the old Daoist finally turned around slowly, holding Wan Miaoyin, and headed towards the Jade Capital in Central State.

After galloping all night, the gilded mace on Xu Yunfan's back suddenly trembled, like a dragon facing an abyss.

He spun around abruptly to look back, a heavy stone in his heart inexplicably lifting.

It seemed he had avoided some kind of disaster.

Avoiding misfortune and seeking fortune?

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. The profundity of the *Lin* character technique seemed to still be deep enough to explore.

Finally, Xu Yunfan could no longer hold on, stopping in a wild forest to rest silently.

Beicheng City was over six hundred miles away from Changyi, the capital of Qing Province. Along the way, there were many bandits and wild beasts. With his current condition, he couldn't travel long distances.

He needed to hunt and eat.

As withered leaves swirled and landed in the night wind, Xu Yunfan's ears suddenly stopped their slight trembling. Thirty zhang southeast, amidst the sound of iron and earthenware pots clashing, drifted a familiar scent of barley wine mixed with grease.

It was the unique aroma of the Longfeng Tavern's roasted fawn leg with salt and pepper.

He suddenly stood up, the back of his hand pushing aside the thicket, still bearing fresh scabs. When he pushed aside the final cluster of ghost needle grass, his vision suddenly opened up.

Eighteen cloud-patterned sandalwood carriages formed a circle, guarding twenty-three green felt tents. In the center, the extinguished bonfire had a half-burnt wooden skewer stuck in it. The half-golden date remaining on the skewer's tip proved it was the exclusive sign for the top-grade "Drunken Branch" wine shipped to the provincial city by the Longfeng Tavern.

"Who goes there?!"

A familiar, deep voice rang out sharply, accompanied by a clang. A figure, as imposing as a tiger pouncing, crashed through the bronze lamp stand in front of the tent and shot out from the camp.

*Clang!*

The sound of the Yanling saber leaving its sheath sliced through the moonlight.

When the figure saw Xu Yunfan's face, half-lit and half-shadowed by the moonlight, he sheathed his saber and bowed in salute.

"Young Hero Xu?! What are you doing here?"

It was none other than Liu Tianyun, one of the stewards of the Longfeng Tavern and the only martial master there.

Because Xu Yunfan had spent a great deal at the tavern, this steward was quite familiar with him. Meeting him here was an unexpected delight.

Xu Yunfan didn't beat around the bush. From his怀里 (bosom), he pulled out a silver bill. The official bill from the Jade Capital's Baotailong Bank was flicked between his two fingers, creating a slight arc.

"Brother Liu, I wonder if I could purchase some exotic beast meat? It would be even better if you have any pills for supplementing vital energy and blood."

Hearing this, Liu Tianyun noticed that although Xu Yunfan's breathing was even, it was slightly weak, and his figure was a bit thinner than before, as if he had just recovered from a serious illness.

He immediately relaxed. Seeing the lavish spender before him, a natural smile appeared on his face.
