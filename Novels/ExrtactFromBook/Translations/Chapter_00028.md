# Chapter 28: Raising a Dragon  

Han Yue had been searching for new prey in the forest when a thunderous roar in the distance caught his attention.  

Riding a beam of light, he flew toward the source and discovered a massive second-rank wild boar, towering like a small mountain. The boar's muscular frame was covered in coarse fur, and its eyes burned with fury, as if ready to incinerate any foe.  

Yet, despite its imposing presence, the boar was currently pinned to the ground by a small figure, who was dragging it forward step by step. The boar's tusks—thick as spears—were its most fearsome weapons, but one of them was firmly gripped by the figure's right hand.  

Though the figure didn’t seem to exert much effort, the boar lay helpless, unable to rise. As the figure advanced, the entire beast was dragged along, its massive body scraping against the ground. The boar thrashed wildly, toppling trees and shattering rocks in its struggle, yet it couldn’t break free.  

The bizarre scene nearly stunned Han Yue. He couldn’t fathom the sheer strength required to manhandle a second-rank beast as if it were mere trash.  

Flying closer for a better look, Han Yue saw that the figure was actually a slender, youthful girl. Dressed in purple, she appeared delicate and charming, likely only a year or two older than Xiao Liu—yet her power was in an entirely different league.  

Hovering in the air, Han Yue thought himself well-hidden, but the girl suddenly looked up, her sharp gaze locking onto him.  

Before he could react, she called out cheerfully, "Hey, friend up there! Come down and chat! It's been ages since I've seen another living soul!"  

She waved him down.  

After a brief hesitation, Han Yue descended. With his **[Light-Speed Flight Technique]** as a safeguard, he could always flee if needed.  

Once he landed, the girl greeted him warmly. "Hello, friend! I’m Luo Erjia from the Beast Taming Sect. Running into you here is quite the happy coincidence!"  

*Beast Taming Sect!*  

Han Yue was no longer the ignorant newcomer he once was. From Xiao Qing and Fang Yi, he had learned much about this sect.  

The Beast Taming Sect was located in the southeastern part of Guizhou, one of the top sects closest to the Flesh Market. With nearly ten thousand cultivators, it was a thriving powerhouse.  

Their disciples specialized in refining bloodlines and taming demonic beasts, making their cultivation methods unique. Thanks to their powerful beast companions, they often surpassed peers of the same rank in combat—making them notoriously difficult to deal with.  

This girl, hailing from such a prestigious sect, naturally had access to complete legacies and formidable combat prowess. Though she appeared to be only at the second rank—not yet third—her ability to treat a second-rank beast as a plaything wasn’t surprising.  

"I’m Han Yue, from the Flesh Market near the border of the Inner and Outer Domains," he introduced himself. "I came here to hunt demonic beasts."  

"I know of the Flesh Market—it’s quite a distance from here! You must be quite the traveler, Brother Han."  

"My sect brothers call me Xiao Luo. You can call me that too."  

Xiao Luo was remarkably easygoing, her friendly demeanor showing no hostility.  

After exchanging names, Han Yue couldn’t help but ask, "Xiao Luo, you’re incredible. If I wanted to kill this boar, it’d take me half a day and dozens—if not hundreds—of strikes. Yet you’re tossing it around like a toy!"  

"But where are you taking it?"  

Xiao Luo blinked and grinned. "I’m raising a dragon!"  

"A dragon? You have one?"  

"Not yet, but I *will* raise one!"  

"Come see for yourself!"  

Without waiting for his response, she dashed off, dragging the boar behind her.  

Her speed rapidly increased, reaching over two hundred kilometers per hour. The poor boar, battered and bruised, was on the verge of collapse.  

Xiao Luo ran without regard for obstacles, using the boar as a battering ram to smash through anything in her path. The second-rank beast served as both a bulldozer and a wrecking ball, flattening trees and shattering boulders in her wake.  

After a chaotic hundred-kilometer sprint, they finally stopped at a deep mountain pool, its waters clear and unfathomable.  

Xiao Luo tossed the boar onto the shore. After such torment, the beast was barely alive, its bones broken and spirit shattered. It lay whimpering, too weak to even scream.  

Standing at the water’s edge, Xiao Luo shouted, "Come out and eat!"  

"Now!"  

"Don’t make me wait!"  

After several calls, nothing happened.  

"I have a guest today—don’t embarrass me!"  

Still, the pool remained undisturbed. Han Yue watched patiently, but Xiao Luo began to look slightly embarrassed.  

"Stubborn as ever, huh? Fine, you asked for it!"  

She retrieved a crystalline orb from her storage artifact and hurled it into the depths.  

With a snap of her fingers, she commanded, "**Boom.**"  

A deafening explosion erupted from the pool.  

The entire mountain trembled as a colossal force surged upward, blasting water high into the sky. The pool’s level dropped noticeably, and a light rain drizzled over the area.  

The orb had clearly been a powerful spell bomb.  

Almost instantly, a massive crimson serpent burst from the water, its maw gaping wide with rows of barbed fangs, exhaling a foul, bloodthirsty aura.  

But before it could strike, a streak of black light shot down from a nearby peak, slamming into the serpent’s skull with a thunderous impact.  

Dazed, the serpent crashed onto the shore, its jaws snapping shut from the force. Deep gashes split its scales, blood seeping from the wounds.  

"Ha! Finally decided to show up, huh?"  

"Brother Han, behold—this is the dragon I’m raising!"  

"Wait… where’d you go?"  

Turning to Han Yue, she realized he was gone.  

Looking up, she spotted him descending from a kilometer above, having clearly bolted skyward the moment danger appeared.  

Xiao Luo burst into laughter. "Wow, Brother Han, you’re *fast*! I should call you Han the Fleeter!"  

Han Yue coughed awkwardly, only slightly embarrassed.  

Now, he finally had a moment to examine the scene properly.
