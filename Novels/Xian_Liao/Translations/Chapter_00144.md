# Chapter 144: Refining the Water Mansion and Transplanting the Great Mulberry Tree

"Hungry..." The Great Mulberry Tree conveyed this emotion to Zhou Qing.

In the Jiangzhou Herb Garden, Zhou Qing rubbed his forehead. After enduring the lightning tribulation, the Great Mulberry Tree had shrunk to only five zhang in height, though it could still transform into a towering divine tree. However, doing so would consume an enormous amount of spiritual energy.

Having grown to the level of a Golden Core existence, the spiritual energy of the mortal realm could no longer satisfy the Great Mulberry Tree's needs.

"It seems I'll have to transplant the Great Mulberry Tree to the Water Mansion," Zhou Qing mused.

He had already converted all the remaining Divine Sky Thunder True Qi in the Green Gold Sword into Divine Sky Thunder Divine Light. Now, he only needed to release the Green Gold Sword during thunderstorms to absorb thunder essence, automatically converting it into Divine Sky Thunder True Qi, which he could then refine into Divine Sky Thunder Divine Light.

Given the current quality of the Green Gold Sword, once it was fully charged with Divine Sky Thunder Divine Light and he unleashed the "Majestic Heavenly Might" of the Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique, Zhou Qing could hardly imagine the sheer power it would possess.

This could also be seen as a process of charging the Green Gold Sword for the Divine Sword Thunder Control Technique—a trump card-level ultimate move.

Considering the Great Mulberry Tree's needs, Zhou Qing felt it was time to transplant it to the Water Mansion in the Jingyang Dao Domain. No matter what, the spiritual energy of the Jingyang Dao Domain far surpassed that of the mortal realm.

"The Water Mansion's current location isn't deep enough and could be discovered by Golden Core-level beings. It's better to move it to a deeper spot."

With his current cultivation, Zhou Qing had enough power to maneuver the Water Mansion through the waters. He had already thought of a more suitable location—the cave dwelling of the Azure-Eyed Water Beast. The spiritual veins there were superior to those near the Water Mansion's current location.

During his last visit, he had memorized the layout of the Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Array in the Azure-Eyed Water Beast's cave and passed the information to Yuan Mingyue.

Zhou Qing quickly made up his mind to subdue the Azure-Eyed Water Beast and have it guard the Water Mansion. After all, a water-based demon beast was better suited for this role. The Rooster was clearly uncomfortable in aquatic environments, while the little snake, though amphibious, excelled in speed, toxicity, and resilience rather than raw power. At the late Foundation Establishment stage, the snake's venom could slightly affect Golden Core-level beings but couldn't inflict serious harm. Still, it could be used as a surprise weapon in battles.

In battles between powerful beings, advantages were often built up through small details. If one's Qi, body, spirit, divine abilities, spells, and magical treasures were all slightly superior to the opponent's, the cumulative effect could lead to an overwhelming advantage.

After transplanting the Great Mulberry Tree to the Water Mansion in the Jingyang Dao Domain, Zhou Qing planned to nourish it with the Primordial Qi of All Things and the Primordial Heavy Water to see if there would be any noticeable effects. The Great Mulberry Tree could now barely be considered a "Heaven and Earth Spiritual Root," and its growth requirements had become far more stringent than before. Currently, it was still in a post-tribulation transformation phase, so these matters could be addressed gradually without urgency—despite its persistent complaints of hunger. After all, if it had endured hunger for this long, a little longer wouldn't hurt.

"Friend Mulberry Tree, don't worry. I'll prepare a new home for you first," Zhou Qing reassured it.

Once the Great Mulberry Tree was transplanted, Zhou Qing intended to move the eerie peach tree from the Jingyang Cave to the Jiangzhou Herb Garden. That peach tree was a Wood-attribute demonic plant at the Foundation Establishment level, but its evil aura was faint. It was highly nourishing to Qi and blood and even had slight life-extending properties, making it perfect for Fushan to study longevity elixirs. With the Great Mulberry Tree's spirit-gathering abilities, the Jiangzhou Herb Garden had become the most spiritually rich location in the mortal realm, sufficient to sustain the peach tree's growth. Previously, the peach tree had relied on the spirit-gathering array set up by the Jingyang Patriarch in the cave to survive.

### **Jingyang Waters, a Thousand Zhang Deep**

The deeper one ventured into the waters, the harder it became for divine sense to penetrate—a stark contrast to its use on land. However, Zhou Qing's Eyes of Truth were far less affected. With them, he could clearly observe the underwater world.

Releasing his terrifying spiritual pressure without restraint, Zhou Qing made his presence known. The Azure-Eyed Water Beast sensed it but showed no fear—likely due to its trace of ancient divine bloodline. Though not yet at the Golden Core level, its innate essence was extraordinarily high, and its combat power far surpassed that of any Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator.

The beast opened its massive maw, summoning vast water-based demonic energy to blast a towering water column toward Zhou Qing. In response, Zhou Qing pointed a finger, condensing his Golden Core power to meet the attack. The two forces collided, but the water column ultimately dissipated with a thunderous explosion. The Azure-Eyed Water Beast was sent flying, crashing into an underwater mountain and shattering the rock—despite its resilience against the crushing pressure of the depths, it was no match for Golden Core power.

Finally, fear flickered in the beast's eyes. It spat out a shimmering water pearl, its inner core—the Water Spirit Pearl—capable of unleashing overwhelming tidal forces. Zhou Qing observed that this power surpassed even the Blood Spirit Drill talisman treasure he had seen Qin Qing use before.

"This is about 40% of an early Golden Core's strength," Zhou Qing noted inwardly. Such power could sweep away any cultivator below the Golden Core stage. It was no wonder Golden Light had waited for the beast to leave before exploring the cave back then—even a half-step Golden Core Perfection cultivator would be helpless against it.

As the Water Spirit Pearl surged toward him, Zhou Qing stood with his hands behind his back, unmoving. The terrifying demonic pressure made the underwater world tremble as if a small tsunami were brewing. Yet, when the pearl struck, it was halted by a faint five-colored glow—the protective barrier formed by his Supreme Unity Chaos Divine Light. The pearl became trapped in the shimmering film, struggling like a fly in amber.

The Azure-Eyed Water Beast grew visibly agitated, its massive body charging at Zhou Qing. With a casual motion, Zhou Qing raised a hand and pressed it against the beast's forehead.

"Azure-Eyed Water Beast, you've done your best," he said, his tone ambiguous—whether praise or mockery.

His overwhelming physical strength left the beast in despair. Then, his formidable divine sense invaded its consciousness, and he fully unleashed his Soul Bewitchment Technique and Beast Taming Art.

After an indeterminate amount of time, the beast's gaze shifted from resistance to docility.

**Beast Taming Art: Azure-Eyed Water Beast (Foundation Establishment Perfection, Fifth-Rank Peak Demon Beast)...**

The Azure-Eyed Water Beast's defensive power rivaled that of the Earth Armored Dragon, and its strength underwater far surpassed it. If the Rooster didn't step up its game, it would soon lose its title as Zhou Qing's top demon beast. (The Great Mulberry Tree didn't count—it wasn't a beast.)

With the Azure-Eyed Water Beast guarding the Water Mansion and the Great Mulberry Tree soon to be transplanted, even if an early Golden Core intruder broke in while Zhou Qing was away, they would suffer greatly. Once the Great Mulberry Tree completed its transformation, it would be a genuine Golden Core-level entity. The Azure-Eyed Water Beast also had the potential to break through to Golden Core, though the Rooster's chances were even higher.

"Yuan Mingyue, come to the Water Mansion," Zhou Qing summoned his disciple via a message talisman after subduing the beast.

### **Rebuilding the Water Mansion**

Yuan Mingyue, the chief designer of the Luopoling Market, rushed to the Water Mansion upon receiving her master's summons. The defensive and concealment arrays automatically parted for her.

"How is progress at Luopoling?" Zhou Qing asked.

"The main framework is complete. The rest can be handled by the others step by step," she replied.

Zhou Qing nodded. "Good work. For now, just oversee the big picture there. We have a more pressing task—rebuilding the Water Mansion."

He outlined his vision: using his Green Sun Spiritual Fire and Golden Core power to relocate the Water Mansion and integrate it with the spiritual veins near the Azure-Eyed Water Beast's cave. They would then reconstruct the Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Array based on the remnants of the ancient restrictions and array foundations.

With Zhou Qing's Golden Core-level support, many of Yuan Mingyue's ideas could be implemented. The outer defenses would rely on the Five Elements Inversion Array for concealment and protection. At Zhou Qing's current level, the array could withstand full-force attacks from early Golden Core cultivators—especially if powered by high-grade spirit stones.

The inner layer would feature the Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Array as a secondary safeguard, activated only against formidable intruders. Divine Sky Thunder Divine Light could serve as its core. Additionally, they planned to expand the Water Mansion's space, adding a herb garden with the Earth Cauldron for refining Primordial Qi of All Things, as well as a pool where the Azure-Eyed Water Beast could gather water spiritual energy for Zhou Qing to cultivate Primordial Heavy Water.

After finalizing the blueprints, Zhou Qing mobilized resources from Tianxuan City, with Shang Zijian providing full cooperation. Golden Light, now a Golden Core cultivator, focused on consolidating his realm and improving his strength using the late Tianxuan Patriarch's insights. Aware of his mediocrity among Golden Core cultivators, he pinned his hopes on Zhou Qing to safeguard Tianxuan City and thus followed his lead without question.

To further his cultivation, Zhou Qing planned to refine his Golden Core using Yin-Yang Divine Light and, once the Great Mulberry Tree completed its transformation, use its spiritual products to concoct Golden Core-level elixirs. Though he could refine his core on his own, progressing to the second revolution would take at least sixty years—equivalent to the mid-Golden Core stage. While this was already impressive, the nine revolutions grew increasingly difficult, and speeding up the early stages would buy him more time to tackle later bottlenecks.

With a lifespan of eight hundred years—akin to Peng Zu's longevity—Zhou Qing knew time was still precious. He occasionally wondered what lay beyond the nine revolutions. Based on his estimates, the Jingyang Patriarch had likely been at the fourth revolution (Nascent Soul level) when establishing the Jingyang Dao Domain. The gap between them was narrowing.

"Before, there was Jingyang; now, there is Qingyang," Zhou Qing mused. He had taken "Qingyang" as his Daoist title from his Green Sun Spiritual Fire but kept it private, using "Qing Lingzi" publicly to avoid drawing attention—especially given the existence of sinister artifacts like the Seven Star Nailhead Book, which could kill without a trace.

"Spirit cultivators likely have similar techniques. Right now, I lack a proper soul-refining method. Since spirit cultivators excel in this area, I should explore a spirit cultivation ruin after perfecting my divine abilities and the Green Gold Sword's training."

Zhou Qing's soul refinement relied on his innate talent and Lin Wan'er's *Lingfei Miaoyin Scripture*. His previous *Formless Mind Technique* was now useless at the Golden Core stage. Moreover, cultivation methods at this level and beyond were often adapted from predecessors and personal insights. True Nascent Soul-level techniques tailored to the individual were exceedingly rare, as each cultivator's aptitude and temperament differed. Even techniques left by Nascent Soul experts might not suit successors perfectly.

Higher realms placed greater emphasis on the compatibility between method and practitioner, making it incredibly difficult to find suitable successors without institutional support. For a lone expert, locating the right heir was like searching for a needle in a haystack.

### **Transplanting the Great Mulberry Tree**

After extensive efforts, the Water Mansion's reconstruction was finally complete.

Returning to the Jiangzhou Herb Garden, Zhou Qing stood before the Great Mulberry Tree. "Friend Mulberry Tree, time to move."

The tree responded with eager anticipation. Having endured the lightning tribulation, it had come to realize the mortal realm was no longer suitable for it.

Zhou Qing enveloped the tree with his divine sense, soothing it into compliance. As his awareness permeated its form, the five-zhang-tall tree vanished into his internal five-zhang space.

Through the teleportation array, Zhou Qing returned to the Water Mansion's herb garden, where the Great Mulberry Tree materialized above a prepared pit and took root. At the same time, Zhou Qing pointed at the Earth Cauldron. He had previously tasked the Earth Armored Dragon with collecting earth-attribute spiritual materials to feed the Ganoderma, then used parts of it to refine Primordial Qi of All Things.

As the Great Mulberry Tree settled into the soil, the Primordial Qi of All Things showered over it. Instantly, the tree radiated profound contentment, and a drop of crystalline spiritual dew formed. A refreshing, indescribable fragrance filled the herb garden.
