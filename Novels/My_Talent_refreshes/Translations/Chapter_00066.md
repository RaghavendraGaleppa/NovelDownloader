# Chapter 66: The Mighty Talisman Source Spirit Body

Returning to his courtyard, Chu Ning eagerly began unpacking items from his storage pouch. Today's harvest had been truly bountiful.

A mid-grade talisman brush, "Fundamentals of Primary Talisman Crafting," high-grade talismans, the Verdant Wood Sword Art...

After admiring the treasures spread across his table, Chu Ning eventually put everything away except for the jade slip containing the primary talisman crafting basics.

The Verdant Wood Sword Art could wait until he moved to the outer sect quarters. For now, improving his talisman crafting skills took priority—after all, today's windfall had come precisely because he'd demonstrated exceptional talent in this field.

The jade slip contained remarkably detailed information, and Chu Ning found himself utterly absorbed. His previous creation of Wood Escape Talismans had relied mostly on intuition and his innate Talisman Source Spirit Body aptitude, leaving him ignorant of many fundamental principles.

For instance, he'd only vaguely understood talisman grading. According to the jade slip, talismans were classified as Primary, Intermediate, Advanced, and Supreme, with each rank further divided into low, mid, and high grades. Different grades required different types of talisman paper.

The paper Chu Ning had been using was ordinary, suitable only for primary talismans. Intermediate and advanced talismans required corresponding mid-grade and high-grade papers, with some special talismans needing plant or beast hides. Supreme talismans exclusively used hides from special spirit beasts.

Talisman masters were similarly graded based on their ability to craft corresponding rank talismans with at least fifty percent success rates—Primary, Intermediate, Advanced, and Supreme Talisman Masters. Given the wide variation within primary talismans, practitioners often used first to third-tier distinctions for primary masters.

This was just the foundational knowledge. The jade slip contained far more—detailed systematic explanations and, as Liao Yunming had mentioned, numerous personal insights that Chu Ning found immensely valuable.

For most of the day, Chu Ning studied these fundamentals without even glancing at the included talisman recipes. Only after completing this theoretical review did he set down the jade slip, deep in thought.

With his Talisman Source Spirit Body's natural affinity, Chu Ning absorbed and comprehended the knowledge with remarkable speed. After prolonged contemplation, a smile finally appeared on his face.

Rather than immediately examining the included recipes, he retrieved his original talisman brush, ink, and a stack of blank papers. "I'll test my understanding by crafting Wood Escape Talismans first," he murmured.

Picking up the brush, Chu Ning channeled spiritual energy, dipped the tip, and executed fluid strokes—completing a talisman in one smooth motion. A green flash confirmed its successful creation. He repeated this process twenty times before switching to the mid-grade brush Liao Yunming had gifted him.

The difference was immediate—spiritual energy flowed effortlessly to the brush tip. "Truly worthy of a mid-grade brush!" Chu Ning marveled. His spiritual sense enveloped the tool with unprecedented ease, making each stroke feel divinely guided. Another twenty talismans emerged in short order.

Examining both stacks, Chu Ning couldn't suppress his delight. "An eighty percent success rate with the ordinary brush, and ninety percent with the mid-grade one!" Such rates were typically only achieved by intermediate masters crafting primary talismans.

"Talisman Source Spirit Body..." Chu Ning silently repeated the term, awed anew by the potency of innate gifts. His prior experience with the Verdant Wood Evergreen Art had shown him the power of his Yin Wood Spirit Body, but this was something else entirely.

Returning to the jade slip, Chu Ning studied the included primary low-grade talismans: offensive Flame and Mystic Ice Talismans, defensive Earth Armor Talismans, healing Revival Talismans, and surprisingly, a Evergreen Talisman for enhancing spirit plant quality.

For three days, Chu Ning became a hermit in his courtyard—neither entering nor exiting, wholly consumed by talisman crafting. He cycled between studying, practicing, and meditating to restore his energy, experiencing firsthand the addictive obsession Mu Ling had described.

By the end, he'd mastered all five talismans with a forty percent success rate. With absolute confidence, he knew another fortnight would push that beyond sixty percent—another testament to his spirit body's extraordinary capabilities.

On the fourth morning, after his usual routine of mental cultivation, Verdant Wood Evergreen Art, and Nine Revolutions Body Tempering, Chu Ning stepped into his courtyard without picking up a brush.

"Previously, I avoided revealing too much around Lu Yunfang and Luo Hongping next door," he mused. "Their connection to Qi Chongmao remains unclear, but I've always sensed some threat from them. Now that they've moved to the C Zone, I can finally examine the Verdant Wood Sword Art without restraint."

Retrieving the jade slip He Changyou had given him, Chu Ning discovered that despite its name, the "sword art" didn't actually require a sword—the technique merely produced sword-shaped energy attacks. More intriguingly, he understood why He Changyou had recommended it for Verdant Wood Evergreen practitioners.

The Verdant Wood Sword Art shared principles with the growth technique. Where Verdant Wood Evergreen helped plants gather spiritual energy, this art could drain energy from struck cultivators—not just from living targets, but even from protective barriers, absorbing their power to strengthen its own attacks.
