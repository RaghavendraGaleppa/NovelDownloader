# Chapter 661: I Have Waited for You for a Long Time

The Thousand-Hand Form shattered completely, and a bloodline cracked across the "卍" character Buddhist seal between Hui Ri's eyebrows.

"Break for me!"

Blood mist erupted from Han Shi's chest cavity. The Golden Core Dao patterns around him flickered on the verge of extinction under the extreme combustion of the Killing Sword Intent. The sword edge forcefully advanced another three inches.

The terrifying sword qi unleashed by the blade swept out like a torrent of destruction. The Return to Void Sword Intent, carrying the power to annihilate all things, tore through space.

The overwhelming sword pressure swept across the four directions. Several continuous mountain ranges hundreds of miles away were severed at their waists by the dissipated ripples of sword qi. Peaks collapsed, rock layers disintegrated, and smoke and dust soared into the sky, as if the heavens were weeping blood.

*Crack!*

The Prajna Sumeru Barrier shattered instantly.

The sword edge pierced through Hui Ri's chest, and the Return to Void Sword Intent poured into his Vajra Body.

The Great Sun Vajra Fruit let out a mournful cry, and spiderweb-like cracks on its surface spread instantly to its core. Hui Ri was already in a precarious state because Wu Kong had used his own body to fight for his life, causing his Golden Core to self-destruct, making his already unstable Internal Heaven teeter on the brink of collapse, leaving him severely injured.

This time, facing a Sword Dao True Lord—even though he had just entered the Golden Core realm, Sword Cultivators were known for their supreme killing prowess in the Taihua Lingxu Realm—Hui Ri's current state simply could not withstand the attack.

To be fair, in the entire Taihua Lingxu Realm, from ancient times to the present, which Golden Core True Lord would be willing to sacrifice their life to self-destruct, just to pull someone down with them?

Having encountered this now, it was truly a first-time occurrence for Hui Ri. Anyone who saw it would be stunned.

True Lord Pu Du had first attacked and injured Hui Ri. Wu Kong then used his position as the Battle Buddha to detonate himself, sharing the same origin. Following that, another Sword Dao True Lord sacrificed himself for the kill.

"No!!"

Hui Ri's eyes split wide with rage.

The Killing Sword Intent devoured him. He saw his Vajra Body being annihilated inch by inch, saw the roots of the Bodhi Sacred Tree withering, and even saw in the Eastern Wilderness Ruins, Xu Yunfan pressing the Thunder World Prototype towards the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit.

However, Han Shi's sword momentum had not yet ended.

His blood-stained left hand formed a sword finger, carrying the last remaining power of the Cangming Dao Fruit, and pointed towards Hui Ri's brow.

At the boundary of the Bodhi Pure Land, Great Awakening Bodhisattva chanted a low Buddhist name.

"I Buddha is merciful. World Honored One Tathagata is above."

Before the words had fully fallen, his body transformed into a rainbow light, ready to fly eastward towards the Wilderness. However, he had only traveled a hundred miles before he abruptly stopped his form.

Ahead in the void, True Lord Pu Du sat calmly atop the firmament.

Seeing Great Awakening Bodhisattva look over, True Lord Pu Du opened his eyes and said with a smile, "Dao Friend Great Awakening, what matter is so urgent? Why not come over and sit, discuss the Dao, talk about life, speak of great vows, and lecture on Buddhist teachings?"

Great Awakening Bodhisattva sighed in his heart, knowing that Hui Ri's decline was now irreversible.

That Xu Yunfan, a Great True Lord at the Foundation Establishment realm, forcefully controlled two Golden Core avatars to blow the mid-Golden Core Hui Ri Bodhisattva to death on the spot. Although True Lord Pu Du played a hand, the main force was still Xu Yunfan.

Such a stunningly talented and decisive person, the Primordial Sect would surely protect him.

True Lord Pu Du's appearance this time was a clear statement of attitude.

If other Bodhisattvas from the Bodhi Pure Land were to make a move again, that would truly be impolite.

Inside the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, True Lord Pure Yang looked towards the Eastern Wilderness from afar. When he saw this scene, he couldn't help but reveal a look of admiration.

"Good temperament!"

Central Eastern Wilderness.

The finger Han Shi raised was unadorned, yet it condensed his lifelong sword dao cultivation and all his strength, along with the Destruction True Meaning infused by Xu Yunfan, into a single point.

This was a sword strike he initiated by burning his life force, using the detonation of his essence, qi, and spirit as a boost.

*Splat!*

Buddha blood mixed with brain matter exploded in the void.

The instant Hui Ri's head burst, the Great Sun Vajra Fruit fell from the sky, shattering into thousands of Vajra light fragments before it even touched the ground.

The Bodhi Sacred Tree planted in the center of the Eastern Wilderness collapsed with a rumble, and the phantom of the Buddha Kingdom on the ground completely dissipated.

Heaven and Earth mourned together.

A blood rain, thicker than when Wu Kong self-destructed, poured down heavily. The strong wind swept past the Eastern Wilderness, carrying the wailing of billions of冤魂 (yuanhun - resentful spirits).

A Bodhisattva had fallen, and two newly entered True Lords had died. The turbulence of the laws caused by the collapse of their Internal Heavens made all the True Lords of the Three Sects look towards the East simultaneously.

Seeing this scene, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh, lamenting it twice.

But Xu Yunfan didn't feel much reluctance.

The Battle Buddha position carried immense karma. It was formed by the Bodhi Pure Land using the power of faith from all living beings and the devotion of billions of believers over countless years. Once tainted by it, one would never be able to live in peace for the rest of their life.

The Cangming Return to Void Dao Fruit was the exclusive domain of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.

Once taken, even with the protection of True Lord Pure Yang, he would be盯死 (dingsi -盯死 means watched intently/deadly serious watch) by other True Lords of the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect, making it impossible for him to move an inch.

Only the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit, not only possessing an extremely high status but also having its karma erased by True Lord Pure Yang. Once he attained it, naturally, the myriad heavens would be free for him.

Xu Yunfan raised his hand.

The Star Spirit Banner rolled out from the void, instantly enveloping Hui Ri's dissipating soul.

It really worked!

Xu Yunfan relaxed slightly. If the other party was uncontrollable, he would have given up without hesitation.

The Star Spirit Banner had already been refined by him as his life-bound magic treasure. If it were damaged, the loss would outweigh the gain.

Inside the Star Spirit Banner, half a strand of undissipated Vajra Buddha nature within the soul struggled to transform into a Bodhisattva phantom thousands of times smaller.

"Xu Yunfan! The World Honored One will surely make you fall into the Avici Hell forever!"

The残魂 (cánhun - remnant soul) let out a sharp shriek, filled with venom.

"Noisy."

The banner surface surged with dark light, and the Zhou Tian Starry Array crushed down.

The Bodhisattva phantom burst into countless golden dots, eventually condensing into a琉璃舍利 (liuli sheli - crystal relic) embedded in the core of the banner surface.

A prompt appeared in Xu Yunfan's vision at the opportune moment.

‘Star Lord Rank · Great Sun Vajra Buddha (Damaged)!’

‘You have successfully killed a Bodhisattva, your Dao Deeds have greatly increased’

"Hiss..."

Feeling the world becoming increasingly clear, the Dao Fruit becoming more distinct, and his own Dao path becoming more apparent, Xu Yunfan now understood what these Dao Deeds were.

It was only at this moment that Han Shi's残躯 (cánqū - mangled body) fell from the high sky.

The Return to Void Sword Intent of the Cangming Dao Fruit was being抽离 (chōulí - extracted) from his body, captured by the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect using a灵宝 (lingbao - spiritual treasure). The Golden Core Dao patterns rapidly dimmed.

When his last trace of consciousness was clear, he looked in the direction where Xu Yunfan was. His cracked lips moved twice, but ultimately no sound came out.

That gaze mixed with relief and mockery,随 (suí - along with) the light in his pupils completely dissipating.

True Lord Cangming,陨落 (yǔnluò - fallen)!

But dying was impossible.

Xu Yunfan beckoned with his hand, and the Star Spirit Banner rolled up, just like Wu Kong, entering the banner to become a Dao companion.

At this moment.

Ninety-nine strands of Immortal Golden Nature transformed into紫金神龙 (zijin shenlong - purple-gold divine dragons), holding the Thunder World and plunging into the Dantian. The Dao patterns that could destroy all laws branded the entire world.

The Divine Thunder Dao Fruit had already manifested, separating from the Heavenly Dao, and completely descended upon him.

Looking at the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit right before his eyes, Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath.

He raised his hands to hold his own Internal Heaven Prototype and crashed into the Dao Fruit.

Just at this moment, a幽幽 (yōuyōō - faint/dark) voice sounded by his ear.

"Xu Yunfan, you really almost made it."

True Lord Qingyuan's voice pierced through the thunderous roar accompanying the descent of the Divine Thunder Dao Fruit.

Along with the voice, that big hand containing the wondrous methods of the Clear Qi of Heaven and Earth,缠绕 (chánrào - entwined) with the清气 (qingqi - pure qi) of the Celestial Palace, ignored the obstruction of space and had already reached out, pointing directly towards the Thunder World Prototype in Xu Yunfan's Dantian that was about to merge with the Dao Fruit, intending to forcibly interrupt this final moment of proving the Dao.

Xu Yunfan sat cross-legged at the core of the thunder pillar. Facing this fatal strike that was enough to make any Foundation Establishment cultivator's soul scatter in panic, his face not only lacked panic or despair, but instead, he pulled out a smile that made True Lord Qingyuan's heart suddenly tighten.
