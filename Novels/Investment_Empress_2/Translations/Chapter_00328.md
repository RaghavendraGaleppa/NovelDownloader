# Chapter 328: The Headbutt Wave, the Most Valuable Achievement on the Hidden Dragon List

"Phew..."

Li Mo’s body exuded wisps of smoke, and the smell of thick, indelible blood filled his senses as he exhaled a white breath.

Blood holes had burst open all over him; his meridians had exploded. He had never let the power of the world stay on his body for such a long time.

Most of the enemy army had already collapsed, not daring to even look back.

But some of the Disaster Beasts keenly sensed his weakness.

It wasn't just weakness; he felt as if his body didn't belong to him anymore.

The only sensation...

The winter in the Southern Frontier was truly cold.

Li Mo couldn't stand steadily anymore; he couldn't help but lean backward. However, the sensation against the back of his head wasn't the hard ground; on the contrary, it was...

Soft and elastic.

Feeling the "brain waves," Little Li raised his head.

It was that frost-covered face. Her eyes were cold and deep, staring back at the sinister gazes amidst the chaos of war.

Though expressionless, her presence was incredibly oppressive.

Yet, lying in her embrace, the back of his head was indeed filled with a sweet, soft warmth.

This damn sense of security.

Li Mo blinked, looking exhausted yet serious.

"Ice Cube, you might as well have just let me hit the ground."

Ying Bing reached out to wipe the blood and dirt from his face, frowning slightly. "Is it uncomfortable?"

"It's too comfortable. Suddenly being this comfortable, I'm afraid I might fall asleep without realizing it."

"Then sleep."

Ying Bing took off the jade hairpin, letting her silky, waterfall-like black hair cascade down. After all, the jade hairpin was an ordinary object and somewhat fragile.

Li Mo: "......?"

This isn't right.

According to the storybooks, with the atmosphere set just right, she should be slapping his face, frantically telling him not to fall asleep, fearing that if he closes his eyes, he'll never open them again.

Well, right now, even if she slapped his handsome face until it was swollen, it probably wouldn't stop him from falling asleep.

His chaotic thoughts pulled his eyelids heavier and heavier.

In a daze, he heard the sound of the city gate behind him and the city guards charging out in formation.

The last thing he saw before falling asleep was a feather.

It seemed to be the most exquisite creation in the world, something one could remember at a single glance.

If it were a phoenix feather, it probably wouldn't be any more beautiful than this.

........

Nanguan, the Prince of the South's Manor.

A figure on horseback, dusty and frantic, stopped at the entrance. He dismounted and impatiently pushed the door open.

If an ordinary person did this, they would have been captured long ago, but the guards didn't stop him.

"Where is my father?!"

Zhong Zhenyue saw the housekeeper and asked loudly.

"The Prince was summoned back to the Imperial Capital by the Emperor several days ago for a report. He is no longer in the manor," the housekeeper said, wiping his sweat.

"How is that possible?!" Zhong Zhenyue widened his eyes.

The housekeeper sighed. "It's absolutely true. How could I dare lie to you?"

Zhong Zhenyue already had the answer in his heart, but he was unwilling to believe it. He rushed into the courtyard where his father lived, but in the desolate cold wind, there was only a solitary mulberry tree.

He and Zhong Ling searched everywhere, but he didn't see the majestic figure he had in mind.

"Father has really left for the Imperial Capital?"

Zhong Zhenyue's face gradually turned pale.

"Commander Qu... lied to us?" Zhong Ling bit her lips until they bled.

Under what circumstances would Qu Sheng lie to them?

Without his father rushing to aid them, how could Qingmu City possibly withstand the Disaster Beasts and the allied armies of the tribes?

It was questionable whether they could hold out for even seven days!

Zhong Zhenyue didn't dare to think any further.

"Zhenyue, what are you doing?"

"I'm going back to Qingmu City, to be with Brother Li and the brothers!"

"What use is you going back alone? To throw your life away? Our top priority is to catch up with Father and inform him of the military situation in Qingmu City!"

......

Qingyuan Sect, Main Peak Hall.

The charcoal in the stove crackled, echoing through the hall and making it seem empty and gloomy.

The elders sat together, and for a time, no one spoke.

"If Nanguan falls, the flames of war will inevitably spread to the Donghuang Domain. You all know the reasons why."

"We need to make a decision together on whether to stay or leave."

Shangguan Wencang broke the silence, puffing on his dry tobacco pipe.

"Our roots are here. Without Qingyuan, how could we still be called the Qingyuan Sect?"

Qian Bufan sighed, eating a meat bun with a confused expression.

Ziyang Manor was a fief granted by the court.

---

It's easy to say "just leave," but if we leave Ziyang Manor, the Qingyuan Sect cannot establish itself elsewhere; those are someone else's territories.

Unless we go to Beifeng or overseas, where no one controls us.

That would mean the sect's name would exist in name only.

"I say we fight those Disaster Beasts to the death! We'll die on our own land!"

Elder Han He clenched his fists, furious.

"Old Man Han He, I like what you just said!"

Shang Wu took a swig from her gourd and gave a thumbs up. "When I become Emperor in the future, I'll make you a Prince, and Elder Qian can be our Crown Prince."

It was clear that the beautiful Master had entered her battle state, opening with the first move of the King of Brawls' ultimate technique.

She was indeed the inventor of the ultimate technique.

One sentence could offend two people.

Qian Bufan: "?"

Han He: "?"

Even if the Great Shang didn't fall, it wouldn't be your turn to be Emperor.

"I think we should pack up our important belongings first and observe the changes for a while," Xue Jing said with a worried frown.

But he still comforted everyone, saying, "Isn't the Prince of the South still here? He is a God of War. As long as Qingmu City can hold on for a moment and wait for his reinforcement, it won't be the worst-case scenario."

Hearing this, the others nodded, but their worry didn't diminish.

Their sect's two treasures were still in Qingmu City.

However, those two little fellows had already surpassed their peers. Surely they could hold out until reinforcements arrived?

Yes, it definitely won't be the worst-case scenario...

Just then, a person rushed in frantically. It was Xiao Qin.

Usually steady, Xiao Qin was now panting heavily, his expression losing its usual resilience and calm.

"What's wrong? Weren't you out on a training journey?"

"I saw a troop in the Donghuang Domain! They came from the Southern Frontier!"

"They're flying the banner of the Prince of the South!"

?!

The elders' expressions changed instantly.

The Prince of the South was not in the Southern Frontier but had appeared in the Donghuang Domain.

Then... who could save Qingmu City?

*Clatter—*

The gourd fell from Shang Wu's hand. The usually carefree Master of the Jade Peak now showed a hint of panic in her eyes.

That foolish boy... he wouldn't stay in Qingmu City and perish with the city, would he?

He wouldn't be that stupid... he wouldn't...

Shang Wu shook the Heart-to-Heart Bell vigorously.

But she waited a long time and heard no response.

"Shang Wu! Where are you going?"

"He's under my protection. I'd like to see any damn bastard dare to touch my disciple!"

"Hey, if you go now, it'll be too late! You're just throwing your life away!"

"Don't be anxious, Junior Sister. Let's think of a way.无论如何, we need to confirm the safety of Little Mo and Little Bing'er first, then find a chance to rescue them..."

The Main Peak Hall was in a state of chaos for a time.

At the same time.

Yantian Sect.

Tian Miao walked up the steps, just like yesterday, climbing to the top of the high stargazing platform. Only a very few people, including her Master's other disciples, were allowed to go up there.

Soon, she saw her Master's stunned figure.

"Master, what's wrong?"

Tian Miao hurriedly took out a blood-tonifying spiritual medicine.

But the old woman shook her head and remained silent. Puzzled, Tian Miao leaned closer, only to see a green-veined jade slip in her Master's hand.

On it was clearly written:

"Li Mo, the 'Wife-Supporting Fighting Soul,' entered the battle with the might of a ten-thousand-man enemy and slew Han Zhen amidst a hundred thousand troops."

"Ying Bing, the 'Cold Fairy,' used zither music to aid the battle, then manifested a true phoenix, intimidating several high-level Disaster Beasts, slaying thousands of Disaster Beasts, and frightening back tens of thousands of enemy troops from the various tribes of the Southern Frontier."

Tian Miao opened her mouth but couldn't make a sound.

She suspected she wasn't fully awake.

Could this be an achievement on the Hidden Dragon List?

If placed on the Human List or Earth List, it would still seem too exaggerated!

But the names Li Mo and Ying Bing were clearly there.

How did they achieve this?

"Master, should this be sent to the Dragon Gate... and released?"

"This is unprecedented and unparalleled; it should naturally be known throughout the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths."

Tian Miao took the information and grew more shocked the more she read.

This might be the most valuable achievement in the history of the Hidden Dragon List, looking at all the geniuses who have ever made the list.
