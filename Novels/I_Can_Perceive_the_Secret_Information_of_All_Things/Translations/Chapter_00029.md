# Chapter 29: Eliminating the Cuckoo Gang  

What's most important when traveling the cultivation world?  

Safety, of course.  

That's why many cultivators adhere to one golden rule: never flaunt your wealth.  

You can never truly know who might covet what you possess—but Xiao Ji did.  

To track down the missing goods from the second stone shop in Taigu City, he decided to set a trap.  

Knowing the Cuckoo Gang specialized in theft, he suppressed his cultivation to the fourth level of Qi Refining and deliberately displayed his high-quality spirit sword, making sure the gang's third-in-command took notice.  

The best schemes often require the simplest setups.  

After paying for his meal, Xiao Ji wandered through the Black Dragon Market, keeping his target within forty paces at all times.  

His true cultivation was at the eighth level of Qi Refining, but by disguising himself as a fourth-level cultivator, he ensured the gang's sixth-level third-in-command would underestimate him.  

Though the gang thrived on robbery, even the third-in-command wouldn’t dare attack openly in the market.  

Eventually, Xiao Ji left the market and stepped into the desolate outskirts, where only moonlight illuminated the barren land strewn with rubble and dead trees.  

This was no-man’s-land, beyond the borders of the Great Li Kingdom—cold, but without snow.  

"Here will do."  

Xiao Ji stopped and turned around.  

No one was visible behind him.  

[To the left, nineteen paces behind a boulder, hides the Cuckoo Gang’s third-in-command at the sixth level of Qi Refining… To the right, twenty-two paces behind a dead tree, two martial cultivators at the third level lie in wait…]  

Five in total. The Cuckoo Gang truly was cautious.  

Xiao Ji remained still. "Skulking in the shadows—too cowardly to show yourselves?"  

[The third-in-command advances two paces, concealing himself in the shadow of a skeleton. In three breaths, he will strike with the Cuckoo Gang’s signature weapon, the Brain-Piercing Death Needle, aimed at your heart.]  

How ruthless.  

Xiao Ji drew his sword. "Like cockroaches, always scurrying in the dark."  

*Whoosh!*  

The needle shot through the night.  

*Clang!*  

Xiao Ji deflected it with his blade.  

With the ambush foiled, the third-in-command abandoned stealth and lunged forward, twin sickles gleaming with killing intent as he closed in from the side.  

At the same time, the remaining four gang members converged from all directions.  

A single slash from Xiao Ji’s Thunderbolt Sword forced the third-in-command back.  

A sidestep, a horizontal sweep—a crescent of sword light severed the head of the nearest attacker.  

Blood sprayed under the moonlight, painting a macabre scene.  

"You’re not at the fourth level—you’ve hidden your cultivation!" the third-in-command snarled. "You deceived me!"  

"None of your damn business," Xiao Ji replied bluntly.  

On reflection, whether or not Xiao Ji concealed his cultivation had nothing to do with the Cuckoo Gang—they were the ones who had provoked him.  

Thinking of disguising his strength, Xiao Ji silently thanked Zhao Jiuzhou for the inspiration. The man was a master of deception, and the technique proved invaluable.  

"You lured us here on purpose," the third-in-command growled, realizing the truth. That earlier remark—"Here will do"—had been meant for them.  

"More accurately, I lured *you* here," Xiao Ji corrected, glancing at the three surviving gang members. "As for them… just unlucky."  

The trio hesitated, torn between attacking and fleeing—either option likely meant death.  

"What grudge do you hold against the Cuckoo Gang?" the third-in-command asked, subtly signaling his men to strike again while keeping Xiao Ji distracted.  

But before they could move, three flashes of sword light severed their heads.  

The heads rolled to a stop, eyes wide in shock—perhaps they hadn’t even had time to blink.  

Xiao Ji showed no mercy.  

"No grudge," he said calmly. "I just need you to do something for me."  

*Need him?* This was no request—it was coercion.  

"Name it, Daoist," the third-in-command said quickly, sensing a sliver of hope. Given Xiao Ji’s display of power—likely beyond the sixth level, possibly even Foundation Establishment—submission was the wiser choice.  

"Nothing difficult. Just write a letter for me."  

The third-in-command chuckled nervously. "Homesick? Or missing a sweetheart? Can’t write? No shame in that—many Daoists only know how to draw talismans."  

Xiao Ji retrieved an inkstone, brush, and paper from his storage brick.  

"Write what I say. One wrong word, and I’ll take a finger."  

The letter was simple: the third-in-command claimed to have discovered an immortal’s tomb and urged the second-in-command to come alone with a few trusted men to excavate it—without informing the gang leader.  

A transparent lie, but greed would drive them to take the risk.  

Xiao Ji’s plan was straightforward: capture a high-ranking gang member, use them to lure others, and eliminate the Cuckoo Gang piece by piece.  

According to his intel, the stolen goods were stored in a dozen spirit artifacts within the gang’s heavily guarded vault. Breaking in wouldn’t be easy.  

Even though Xiao Ji was at the eighth level of Qi Refining—higher than the gang leader’s seventh—sheer numbers made a direct assault unwise.  

So he resorted to this method.  

Tedious, but effective.  

By dawn, Xiao Ji had wiped out most of the Cuckoo Gang’s leadership. After executing the third-in-command with a single thrust, he strode into the gang’s secret vault unopposed.  

The remaining gang members, knowing their superiors were dead and facing a ruthless killer, fled rather than resist.  

The Black Dragon Market was lawless—no one would intervene in gang warfare.  

Xiao Ji packed up all the gang’s artifacts, keeping only a wooden bow for himself. Its string was one of the four legendary strings of the Pipa, the very relic he had come to find.  

The rest he sold dirt-cheap at the market, netting over three hundred low-grade spirit stones.  

With no reason to linger in such a dangerous place, Xiao Ji left swiftly.  

Instead of returning to Taigu City—where his recent massacre might draw attention—he boarded a floating vessel back to Longxiang Prefecture.
