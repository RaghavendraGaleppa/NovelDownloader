# Chapter 196: Entering the City

"This is a trace of the essence of that powerful individual whom I once slew in Border Purgatory," Huang Qi said. "It has been refined by some strong figures and possesses miraculous effects. You can use it to enter this city."

Rumble!

The towering city gate boomed. The black lotus in Huang Qi's hand floated up, emitting dark light. The lotus patterns on the city gate also flickered, as if responding to each other. The heavens and earth seemed to sense something. Beneath the sky, layers of black mist swirled like ghostly qi. Scarlet lightning continuously tore through the churning demonic clouds, creating terrifying streaks of blood-red light. It was as if roaring blood rivers surged from the high heavens towards the ground, casting this dark world in a grim and terrifying light.

Torrential blood rain fell, but it couldn't touch Zhou Tian and the two others. Invisible protective qi blocked the blood rain. Huang Qi formed hand seals, and the black lotus fully bloomed, slowly drifting towards the city gate.

Boom!

An astonishing scene unfolded. After the black lotus floated near the city gate, it actually merged into it. Then, the city gate trembled violently, strange patterns emerged as if depicting something, and with a huge roar, it slowly opened.

Inside the gate, mist permeated the air. Figures flickered within the mist, and a tearing sound was heard. A figure emerged from the mist, its armor tattered and torn. The broken armor didn't encase flesh and blood, but a withered skeleton; some bones were even weathered. It dragged a rusty machete behind it, and two faint green lights glowed in its eye sockets. It stood beneath the city gate, staring at Zhou Tian and the two others.

"In the records of my Border Purgatory, this city was once the dwelling of this powerful individual's demonic soldiers. It housed countless strong beings. Although it has been ruined for many years, looking at it now, it seems to have undergone a strange transformation," Huang Qi said with a frown.

"When soldiers come, generals block; when water comes, earth covers," Zhou Tian said. "We've already arrived, we can't just not go in, can we?"

Without any hesitation, Zhou Tian and Saint Demon flew towards the city gate. The closer they got, the more an icy chill pervaded. Huang Qi followed closely behind; his earlier words were merely a reminder, he had no intention of retreating.

Stepping to the city gate, Zhou Tian and Saint Demon stopped. A considerable number of Yin Soldiers had already gathered within the city gate. Both sides scrutinized each other in deathly silence, seemingly in a delicate standoff. Blood rain flew. Those Yin Soldiers exuded an ancient and weathered aura, as if they had lived for endless years, appearing like ancient figures reappearing in the present world.

"Do these skeletons possess sentience?" Zhou Tian asked Saint Demon, observing the Yin Soldiers' glowing green eyes.

Saint Demon observed for a long time, runes flickering and golden light shimmering in his eyes, finally saying with some uncertainty, "It's hard to say." He wasn't entirely sure either. Logically, since countless years had passed and their bodies had decayed to such an extent, their souls should have long vanished. However, this was Wu Tian's Yin City, the other side of the Buddhist Kingdom, so anything was possible.

The two finally took the crucial step. The Yin Soldiers inside the city had already ceased their movements, standing there like colossal tombstones, coldly watching them. One step, two steps, three steps... Zhou Tian and Saint Demon entered the ancient city!

It was as if he had crossed a critical point. Zhou Tian felt a momentary daze; one moment he was at the city gate, the next he was in an unfamiliar place, and he was alone. They had been separated again.

This seemed to be an alley. The surrounding buildings, like the city walls, were constructed from an unknown material. Their color was a dark crimson, as if stained and dried by blood, yet they shimmered with an eerie dark light. Most strikingly, there was a blood river in the sky above the city. The roaring sound of the river water echoed, and at the same time, a sky-high malevolent aura permeated the air, accompanied by a pungent, bloody stench. Scarlet blood mist surged, and a roaring blood river flowed across. The nauseating bloody smell left no doubt that it was indeed real blood.

On the surging blood river, a stone bridge appeared at regular intervals. The ancient bridge bodies were carved with images of gods, demons, and ghosts, etched with the marks of time, seemingly revealing something to people. There were also scattered skeletons on each stone bridge. Perhaps due to the passage of countless years, those white bones were almost completely weathered.

"This blood river is completely invisible from the outside." Zhou Tian frowned slightly. From the outside, there was no blood river visible in this city at all.

Black mist permeated the air. Zhou Tian's entire body glowed with runes, and a golden Buddhist Wheel emerged behind his head, radiating golden light that enveloped him, isolating him from the mist.

"This is somewhere inside the city." Zhou Tian pondered silently. Looking at the surrounding environment, it was certainly within the Yin City, but he couldn't discern his exact location, nor did he know where Saint Demon was.

Just then, a gigantic golden sword of light formed in the sky and plunged fiercely towards the ground. However, several Yin Soldiers leaped up, raising their ancient spears and iron halberds, and rushed towards the sword of light in the sky. Their ancient weapons, seemingly rusted and broken, surprisingly managed to block most of the divine sword's power upon impact. The divine sword couldn't actually harm these Yin Soldiers, though these few were indeed knocked back. After that, he couldn't see the rest of the scene.

"It's either Saint Demon or Huang Qi, most likely Saint Demon." Zhou Tian pondered silently. He tried to ascend into the air but felt a massive suppressing force preventing him from flying. However, using his [Teleport] skill seemed unaffected.

"The greatest peculiarity must be this city." He gazed at the nearby walls that emitted dark light. Because when those skeleton soldiers attacked just now, the ancient city also emanated monstrous, eerie light that reached the sky. This sinister dark light blocked most of the attacks, otherwise, these Yin Soldiers would likely have been unable to truly withstand them.

After discerning the direction, Zhou Tian walked towards the place where the gigantic sword of light had appeared. He decided to find the others first.

"Hiss!"

A strange sound entered Zhou Tian's ears. He narrowed his eyes, constantly paying attention to his surroundings, but nothing unusual happened. Only occasionally did strange sounds enter his mind. He remained vigilant as he continued forward. As the path grew narrower, it quickly reached its end. The strange sound he heard earlier was coming from an ordinary residence, with lingering echoes still swirling. However, another sound was even more attention-grabbing.

"Crunch, crunch..."

Based on his intuition, it was a gnawing sound, as if something was tearing at flesh and bone. He didn't know what kind of creature it was. This ancient city had been sealed for countless years, yet now there were sounds of feeding; it was simply incredible.

"Hiss..."

Hissing sounds echoed again not far away, and from more than one location. Zhou Tian realized the sounds were all coming from those dilapidated ancient residences. On both sides of the street, dense ancient residences shimmered with dark light, some tall and grand, others short and simple, not differing significantly from the layout of an ordinary city.
