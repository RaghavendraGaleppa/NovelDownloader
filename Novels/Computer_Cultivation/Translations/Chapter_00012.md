# Chapter 12: The Family Head  

"Are you Fang Jun?"  

Fang Jun had returned without concealing his presence. Dressed in a green robe that fluttered lightly in the wind, he strode calmly into the Fang family's territory.  

Soon, the cultivators of the Fang family noticed him and rose into the air, hovering mid-sky as they gazed at him with complicated expressions.  

An elder of the Fang family was the first to speak, his tone cautious and doubtful. "Fang Jun, is it really you?"  

Fang Jun's expression remained indifferent as his calm eyes swept over the crowd. He gave a slight nod. "It is me."  

Another cultivator couldn't help but step forward, his voice urgent and uneasy. "Where is the Family Head? Where is he?"  

The corner of Fang Jun's lips curled slightly as he replied nonchalantly, "Naturally, he's dead."  

The moment these words were spoken, the crowd was stunned. The air seemed to freeze in an instant.  

After a brief silence, a Qi Refinement seventh-layer cultivator of the Fang family suddenly shouted in agitation, "Impossible! Fang Jun, you must be lying! The Family Head spared your life—that's the only reason you could return unharmed!" His voice was filled with resentment and fury, as though he couldn't accept the truth.  

An elder beside him immediately rebuked, "Silence, Fang Qinen! Stop your nonsense!"  

Yet, Fang Qinen seemed to have lost all reason as he continued to roar, "It must be true! It has to be! With Fang Jun's cultivation, how could he possibly survive against the Family Head? This is absolutely impossible!"  

Another cultivator gave Fang Qinen a cold glance before whispering to his companion, "He's lost his mind."  

The person beside him nodded in agreement, a hint of mockery in his tone. "What do you expect? His faction has always stood with the Family Head—no, the former Family Head."  

None of these cultivators were fools. They had long understood what Fang Jun's return signified.  

Previously, they had witnessed Fang Tianxiong swearing to kill Fang Jun during the family meeting.  

Now, Fang Jun had returned unscathed, while Fang Tianxiong was nowhere to be found. The outcome was self-evident.  

"Whoosh—!"  

Just as the crowd was lost in their thoughts, a sharp sword light flashed past, and Fang Qinen's voice abruptly ceased.  

His body stiffened for a moment before exploding into a mist of blood, his soul scattering into nothingness.  

Fang Jun slowly retracted his finger, his expression still indifferent, as though he had merely brushed away a speck of dust.  

His gaze swept over the crowd as he spoke in a calm yet unquestionably authoritative voice, "From this day forward, I am the head of the Fang family. Who agrees, and who opposes?"  

The air fell into dead silence once more. No one dared to make a sound.  

Even those who harbored resentment toward Fang Jun lowered their heads, not daring to meet his eyes.  

They understood clearly that the Fang Jun before them was no longer the powerless youth who had once been bullied at will. He was now a powerhouse capable of slaying Fang Tianxiong.  

If it had been an outsider, the Fang family might have activated their formations and ancestral artifacts to fight to the death.  

But Fang Jun was different. His veins flowed with the blood of the Fang family. His mother had once been the legitimate wife, married with full rites.  

By tradition, he was the true eldest son of the Fang family.  

Of course, none of that truly mattered. What truly forced their submission was the terrifying strength Fang Jun had displayed—not only had he defeated and even killed Fang Tianxiong, but he had also refined a life-bound artifact while only at the third layer of Qi Refinement.  

Such talent and power were enough to inspire awe in anyone.  

Just then, an urgent voice echoed in everyone's consciousness: "Disaster! The Family Head's life token has shattered!"  

This news was the final hammer blow, shattering any lingering delusions in the minds of some.  

Fang Tianxiong was dead—not merely escaped. There was no longer any room for doubt.  

Even those who had once firmly stood on Fang Tianxiong's side now lowered their heads, resignation and submission flashing in their eyes.  

They knew that from this moment on, the Fang family's world had changed.  

---  

Fang Ming quietly emerged from the secret chamber Fang Tianxiong had left behind. His steps were hurried and heavy, his eyes brimming with hatred.  

Though he was already a hundred miles away from the Fang family, Fang Ming still didn't feel safe.  

He needed an absolutely secure location, a place where he could hide for five years—until the envoys of the upper sect arrived in the region. Only then could he seize the opportunity to leave.  

"Just you wait, Fang Jun, you bastard," Fang Ming gritted his teeth in silent fury. "Once I achieve success in my cultivation, I will return to kill you and reclaim everything that belongs to me!"  

---  

"The Fang family's annual surplus of low-grade spirit stones is 1,326. Most of this year's supply has already been withdrawn."  

Fang Qicheng stood before Fang Jun, his tone respectful. He had been Fang Tianxiong's trusted aide in life, a Qi Refinement eighth-layer cultivator who had managed the Fang family's finances for years and enjoyed deep trust.  

Yet, the moment Fang Tianxiong died, he had swiftly switched allegiance to Fang Jun. The speed of his change in attitude was astonishing.  

His justification was lofty: Fang Jun was Fang Tianxiong's son. It was only natural for a son to inherit his father's position as family head.  

Fang Jun sat cross-legged on the platform, his expression indifferent.  

He had no interest in the trivial affairs of the Fang family. The only thing he cared about was spirit stones. However, upon hearing Fang Qicheng's report, his brows furrowed slightly.  

"So little?" Fang Jun's voice turned cold. "Does that mean we'd have to save for twenty or thirty years without spending anything just to hope for a single Foundation Establishment Pill?"  

Fang Qicheng hurriedly explained, "It's already a considerable amount. We pay ninety percent of our revenue as tribute to the Great River Sect. After accounting for the clan members' stipends and the family's daily expenses, saving over a thousand spirit stones is already the limit."  

Hearing this, Fang Jun instantly understood everything.  

Spirit veins were the source of spirit stones, but spirit stones were the currency of the cultivation world. How could the right to mint currency be easily delegated?  

If the Great River Sect took ninety percent, you should be grateful for their mercy.  

Considering the power Fang Jun himself wielded, suppressing the Fang family single-handedly was effortless.  

Even if those below disobeyed, he could simply kill a batch and replace them with obedient ones. If they still refused to comply, he could kill again—eventually, someone would submit.  

"By the way, where is Fang Ming?" Fang Jun suddenly changed the subject. "I haven't sensed his presence at all." His divine sense had already swept through the entire Fang family, yet he hadn't detected Fang Ming's aura.  

Fang Qicheng lowered his head and spoke cautiously, "He may have already fled. There was some delay when the family noticed Fang Tianxiong's life token had shattered, which suggests Fang Tianxiong tampered with it before his death. But he likely left no such precautions for his own son."  

It had taken Fang Jun about ten minutes to return from the depths of the mountains to Northridge Town—plenty of time for a cultivator to act.  

If Fang Ming had seized the opportunity to escape, it wouldn't be surprising.  

Fang Jun asked, "Do you have any of Fang Ming's personal belongings?"  

Fang Qicheng paused for a moment before nodding. "Yes."  

Fang Jun replied indifferently, "Then bring them to me."  

Without another question, Fang Qicheng bowed respectfully. "As you command."
