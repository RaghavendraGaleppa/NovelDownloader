# Chapter 280: The Audacious Master

Xu Yunfan's voice carried the sharp clang of forging fine iron. "The anvil of the Sky-Crafting Cave will always be the starting point of my martial path."

"Good, good, good!"

Zhan Yan took the teacup and drained it in one gulp.

In the time that followed, Bi Yuan and Zhan Yan discussed in detail the forging orders that the Sky-Crafting Cave's Weapon Forging Hall would undertake.

Bi Yuan then took out a Dao Sect token and proposed that the Sky-Crafting Cave be affiliated with the Dao Sect to walk the Jianghu.

This would undoubtedly bring many conveniences to the Sky-Crafting Cave.

Leaning against a big tree provided good shade, but it would consume their favor even more.

Though Zhan Yan was inwardly shaken, he did not hesitate to politely refuse this kindness. He understood that this was a preferential treatment offered by Bi Yuan out of consideration for Xu Yunfan, but such a debt of gratitude should not be squandered so easily.

Seeing this, Bi Yuan did not insist. The two turned to drinking and making merry, conversing from the Guest Hall to the banquet. The host and guests enjoyed themselves to the fullest, creating a harmonious and joyful atmosphere.

The night was as dark as ink. The evening breeze of Qingwei Mountain, carrying the sound of pine waves, swept through the courtyard.

After sending Zhan Yan back to his guest room, Xu Yunfan walked out of the courtyard gate and looked up.

Bi Yuan stood with his hands behind his back at the end of the bluestone path. The hem of his black Daoist robe shimmered with a faint blue light under the moonlight, as if he had merged with the flowing vital energy of the mountain.

Three inches beneath his feet, a few withered leaves moved without wind, flowing slowly along a certain trajectory, as if expounding some profound principle or demonstrating exquisite knowledge. The natural phenomena triggered by the vital energy of a Ninth-Realm Qi-refining Grandmaster would always cause the heavens and earth to speak.

Xu Yunfan stopped walking and saw the Xuan Seal between Bi Yuan's eyebrows flickering in the shadows, like a star falling into a deep pool.

The sea of clouds at the mountain's peak suddenly surged downward, condensing into a half-foot-high spiritual mist at Bi Yuan's feet.

In the mist, countless dormant sword glows faintly appeared, like flickering fireflies, casting Bi Yuan's face, illuminated by the moonlight, in alternating light and shadow.

"Master?"

Bi Yuan nodded slightly and then said, "Yunfan, matters of martial practice are better started sooner than later. Now, I need to test your martial arts to formulate a training direction for you, so that you can step into the Ninth Realm of Qi-refining in the shortest possible time..."

Bi Yuan's voice grew increasingly solemn. "When the Demon Lord arrives, only those who have stepped into the Ninth Realm of Qi-refining can seize a sliver of life within his 'Ten Thousand Calamities Furnace'."

Having said this, Bi Yuan met Xu Yunfan's gaze and said seriously, "I will not hide this from you. Regarding the matter of the Empress, my Dao Sect did not encourage it, but neither did we stop it. We simply watched from the sidelines."

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan naturally understood what Bi Yuan meant. To put it plainly, this was a case of using another's hand to commit the sins of the world, while the blessings and merits would fall upon oneself.

Seeing that Xu Yunfan remained silent, Bi Yuan did not mind and continued, "Now, the spiritual energy of the world is rising from the earth's veins, but after several decades, it will eventually fall back to the earth. From then on, for a period of three hundred years, the world will fall into a vacuum period of the end of the law."

At this point, Bi Yuan's tone became slightly heavy. "If you wish to seek a true opportunity for longevity, it is now. Once this time passes, there will truly be no more chances. Those who foolishly attempt to use methods like slumber, corpse-transformation, or various other ways to delay their life force are merely trying to scoop up the moon from the water."

"Enough."

Bi Yuan waved his sleeve slightly. "Tell me what you have cultivated."

Xu Yunfan pondered for a moment and finally decided not to hide his current cultivation, except for the Spirit-Commanding Technique.

"Master, after cultivating the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Technique to perfection, it allowed me to step into the Marrow Cleansing Realm. Within the Small World Secret Realm, I obtained a Body Tempering and Marrow Cleansing Art from the Amitabha Monastery's Jingming. I have now already入门 (entered the door/begun practicing it)."

Bi Yuan nodded slightly. He had once visited the Amitabha Monastery, so he could naturally tell that the clear, metallic chime from Xu Yunfan's jade bones was clearly the result of practicing the Body Tempering and Marrow Cleansing Art.

He asked casually, "Jingming... I know of her, the number one figure of the Amitabha Monastery's younger generation. How did you obtain it?"

Xu Yunfan felt a little embarrassed but understood that in front of a Ninth-Realm supreme Grandmaster, trying to lie was still a bit lacking. He said, "I tortured her a little. She couldn't take it, so she told me."

"Wasn't it fake?"

"I was afraid of that too, so I confirmed it four or five times repeatedly, using special methods to verify its authenticity. She did hide the key points at first, but in the end, she told me everything."

"..."

Bi Yuan's eyelids twitched slightly upon hearing this. He looked seriously at Xu Yunfan's pair of pure, innocent eyes.

He couldn't help but ask, "And what about her?"

"Ah, she accidentally fell into the furnace's underground fire and was burned to nothing. But rest assured, Master, no one knows about this."

"...That's fine then. As a man, one must eventually experience blood and fire. I've met that Jingming before; she cultivated a technique of salvation and conversion, causing many Jianghu wanderers to fall prostrate at her feet."

Bi Yuan said this with a hint of mockery at the corner of his eyes.

"A monk playing with such things, a fitting death."

He then said, "Putting other things aside, the Body Tempering and Marrow Cleansing Art is indeed unique in the Marrow Cleansing Realm. It has the effect of changing one's bones and altering one's physique. It's good, very good to cultivate!"

He paused and asked again, "Besides that, what else?"

"...I actually have a technique for organ training."

"Oh?"

Bi Yuan was a bit surprised. His disciple could actually find a way to provide for himself?!

"What is it?"

"...The Sword Pavilion's Void Cleansing Sword Technique. I heard it can cleanse the five organs, reshape the five elements, and thus obtain a chance for re-cultivation."

"Void Cleansing Sword Technique?!"

Bi Yuan was clearly taken aback. Back when he left the mountain for the Sword Pavilion, it was to borrow this true art. Unfortunately, the Sword Pavilion's old ancestor refused no matter what, and even fought him. Although the ancestor lost by half a move, it was enough to show how terrifying he was.

"Where did you get it?"

Xu Yunfan coughed lightly to cover up some of his embarrassment.

"I got it from the Sword Pavilion's Pei Yan."

"...And what about him?"

"Ah, he also accidentally fell into the underground fire of the Small World Secret Realm. I even tried to pull him up at the time."

He did indeed try to pull him, but it was to pull him so he couldn't climb ashore.

"..."

After a long silence, seeing Bi Yuan who remained wordless, Xu Yunfan broke the silence first and asked tentatively, "Master, do you need to see the Void Cleansing Sword Technique?"

Bi Yuan slowly shook his head. "If it was sixty years ago, it would have been useful to me. Now, it's just scrap paper."

He paused and finally couldn't help but ask, "No one found out, right?"

Xu Yunfan grinned. "In the Small World Secret Realm, there aren't even any protectors. Everyone relies on their own abilities, so naturally, no one found out. Besides, the Small World Secret Realm is on the verge of collapse now. It's possible that most people are already dead."

Bi Yuan nodded. If this matter were to explode, it would definitely bring the Sword Pavilion and the Amitabha Monastery to their doorstep. A slight carelessness could even ignite a major sect war. The matter of the Small World Secret Realm's collapse also needed to be covered up, after all, it was only on the verge of collapse, and there were still many places within it where people could live, especially the entrances and exits used by the major sects' secret realms.

He gave Xu Yunfan a few words of instruction. After hearing Xu Yunfan's agreement, he asked again.

"Besides that, what else have you learned?"

"Ah, there's also the Nine Luminaries Swallowing Qi Technique, and the Nine Luminaries Ten Capitals..."

"Enough, stop talking!"

Bi Yuan immediately cut off Xu Yunfan, who was about to spill out these shocking statements like beans from a jar. He covered his chest. Over the past few decades, he had tempered his body to be flawless and pure. But now, after hearing Xu Yunfan's words, he inexplicably felt a pain in his chest.

This wasn't taking in a genius with monstrous talent; this was completely taking in an audacious master who acts without any restraint.
