# Chapter 488: Undercurrents

Sanzang no longer hesitated. Transforming into a dim golden streamer, trailing long afterimages of blood mist, he fled westward in utter disarray.

At that moment, Xu Yunfan, rigid and motionless, was less than thirty meters from the cold, hard bluestone plaza of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

On the plaza, countless low-level disciples of the Wansheng Sword Sect, looking up at the sky, could clearly see his tightly shut eyes, bloodless face, and weak breath.

Some were shocked, some were vigilant, and some even subconsciously gripped their sword hilts.

After all, this person's origins were unknown. Although his aura had been scattered by the sword light, a faint trace of ferocity and demonic nature still lingered, detected by sharp-eyed individuals.

However, just as Xu Yunfan was about to make fatal contact with the cold plaza, causing a wave of gasps, another anomaly occurred.

The space, like water surface into which a stone had been thrown, rippled ever so slightly beneath Xu Yunfan.

There was no flash of light, no fluctuation of energy, not even the slightest change in the sound of the wind.

He simply vanished abruptly.

As if an invisible, formless giant hand had silently "erased" him from his predetermined falling trajectory.

A deathly silence fell over the plaza for an instant.

Immediately after, an unbelievable uproar of exclamations and noisy discussions erupted.

"Where did he go?!"

"He was just there! How did he suddenly disappear?"

"Was it some kind of profound escape technique? Impossible! There wasn't even a ripple of spiritual energy dispersing."

"Could he have been pulverized into ash by the Founder's sword light? But that doesn't make sense either..."

"Is this a ghost?!"

The disciples looked at each other, their faces filled with confusion and suspicion.

The inner sect steward responsible for patrolling the mountain gates looked even more grim. His spiritual sense swept over the plaza and the surrounding void like a tide, but he could no longer capture a single trace of Xu Yunfan's aura.

It was as if this person had never fallen here at all.

The scene shifted rapidly.

The Eastern Continent, the core of the Primordial Origin Sect, one of the Nine Immortal Mountains.

This mountain was isolated and perilous, suspended in the heavens. Its peak was perpetually shrouded in a strange storm of gravity and chaotic flows of vital energy; ordinary cultivators would be crushed to dust upon contact.

Yet, atop the summit, an ancient Daoist temple stood peacefully. Behind the temple was a grove of purple bamboo, within which a corner of a pond shrouded in immortal mist could be faintly seen.

This was the Dao field of the Primordial Origin Sect's Nine True Lords: Clear Source Mountain, Purple Bamboo Pavilion, and Heavenly Lotus Pond.

True Lord Qingyuan, the Mysterious Canopy True Lord of Profound Origin and Wondrous Way, wore an ancient, dark Daoist robe embroidered with the images of the celestial bodies of the zodiac and the veins of mountains and seas. His face appeared that of an ordinary middle-aged man, yet his brow was broad, and between the opening and closing of his eyes flowed a profound Daoist charm of sun and moon setting, and the passage of time and space.

He sat cross-legged on the cloud bed in the main hall of the pavilion. The clear energy around him was dense, as if he had merged with the laws of the entire Clear Source Mountain and the broader heavens and earth.

The instant Xu Yunfan vanished abruptly from the front gate of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

On True Lord Qingyuan's calm, unruffled face, a tiny ripple suddenly stirred in those eyes that contained ancient stars.

His fingers, which had been in a state of subtle resonance, trembled unconsciously, as if he had encountered an unexpected obstacle while plucking the strings of the Great Dao.

"Hm?"

A nearly inaudible snort escaped his nose.

True Lord Qingyuan's brows furrowed slightly. The vast, sea-like spiritual power and divine sense within him surged without reservation.

In an instant, the galaxy reversed in his eyes, and his fingers formed seals like phantoms.先天五行八卦 (Heavenly Five Elements and Eight Trigrams) runes were born and died in the void. His immensely powerful Primordial Spirit soared above the ninth heaven, establishing a mysterious and unfathomable connection with the River of Destiny deep within the nethermost depths of time and space. Countless causal threads and fragments of fate trajectories related to "Xu Yunfan" gathered and were deduced like a torrent.

However.

Something extremely诡异 (strange/uncanny) happened.

No matter how he traced back or deduced, no matter how many supreme methods he used to pry into the secrets of heaven and clearly observe causality, the trajectory of the existence "Xu Yunfan" at that very moment—

The moment just before Xu Yunfan fell towards the Wansheng Sword Sect's plaza—it was suddenly severed.

It was not cut, nor was it obscured; it was completely gone.

As if an invisible sword that could even sever fate itself, or a creative vortex that embraced all and dissolved all things, had forcibly erased his existence from the entanglement of the past and future of time, from the positional markers of space, and even from the causal fate marks that sustain the existence of living beings.

The result of the deduction was a chaotic void.

No direction, no auspice or misfortune, no sign of life.

Only absolute "nothingness."

"How could this be?"

True Lord Qingyuan murmured, his voice carrying a rare hint of gravity and confusion.

This feeling of losing control was extremely rare since he had ascended to the position of True Lord and presided over the fortune of the Primordial Origin Sect's lineage for thousands of years.

Logically speaking, Xu Yunfan bore the "Seed" he had secretly laid, and his fate and aura had long been marked by him with a special secret method. Even if the other party had fallen into the Wansheng Sword Sect and was personally restricted by True Lord Yangchun, he should still be able to vaguely sense his existence and state, at most obscuring the specific location.

But at this moment, it was a complete "no such person found."

His heavenly secrets' trajectory was severed cleanly, abruptly enough to startle the heart!

"That sword light of Yangchun... what kind of great power does it contain? To be able to even sever the thing I marked?"

True Lord Qingyuan's thoughts raced, and his wariness of that old rival deepened another layer.

Immediately after, a deeper worry surfaced: "If Xu Yunfan has truly fallen into Yangchun's hands, with that old Daoist's temperament, plus the fact that Xu Yunfan displayed the 'Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heavenly Creation Scripture' this time, it will inevitably arouse his great interest... Once he digs deep into it, his roots will inevitably be detected..."

If he stays under Yangchun's very nose, then my plan for the 'Chaotic Origin Seed'...

Just then, an extremely obscure thought, hidden deep within the spatial folds of a corner of the pavilion and concealed by the vast terrestrial energy of Clear Source Mountain, also let out a faint sigh at this moment.

"It's a pity, the Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries, evolving creation... This furnace's foundation and potential far exceeded expectations. It was the finest 'nursery,' and given time, it would have been enough to carry my 'Chaotic Origin Seed,' forging a supreme Dao foundation for that step. But who would have thought... it just happened to run into the Wansheng Sword Sect and startled that old fellow Lü Chunyang!"

The owner of this thought was the mastermind behind the distribution of the unique cultivation method "Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Forging Heavenly Creation Scripture," one of the true planners of this scheme.

His or her aura was ethereal and uncertain, as if parasitic within the gaps of the laws, extremely skilled in concealment.

"A thousand years ago, that single strand of Chunyang's sword intent pierced through the Nine Hells and cut down a star from beyond the heavens. Its majestic power still makes one's spirit tremble to think of it even now.

His sword path has reached the ultimate realm, simplifying complexity, returning to the pure essence within the pure Yang vital energy. A supreme expert of such a sword path has a Dao heart that is clear and bright, understanding all methods, and possesses an insight that is minute and profound.

Once Xu Yunfan falls into his hands, it will be as difficult as reaching the heavens to plot against him again. The 'seed' I left on that boy's body, under the笼罩 (shrouding) of that pure Yang sword vital energy,恐怕 (I'm afraid) has already evaporated like dew, and is difficult to use again..."
