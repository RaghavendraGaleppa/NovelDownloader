# Chapter 235: Unbelievable; The Ice Cube's Mixed Feelings (1/2)

The moon was bright and the stars were sparse.

The Clear Abyss Sect had just returned from Sword City, and the disciples were all high-spirited, unable to hide their lingering excitement.

Elders Qian and Xue were beaming with joy.

Their trip to Sword City was like a country bumpkin visiting the imperial palace; it was an eye-opening experience.

Can you imagine the scene? Outer Scenery experts, and Sword Cultivators at the Fifth Realm at that—usually proud, dashing, and influential figures—flattering and sucking up to them?

It felt wonderful.

Although the Clear Abyss Sect had a glorious past, it was now merely a sect of Prefecture level.

Old Xue and Old Qian both felt they had reached the pinnacle of their lives.

"My thoughts are unobstructed, truly unobstructed!"

"I finally understand why Swordsmen love to show off in public. With a good mood, even the bottlenecks feel a bit looser."

"The two of us old folks are riding on the coattails of those two little ones."

The new generation of the sect represents its future height.

The强者 of Sword City fawned over them simply because the sect had produced Ying Bing and Li Mo.

As long as these two little ones stay on the right path.

The Clear Abyss Sect has a high chance of returning to its former glory.

"Right, but those two are still young. Fame at a young age can easily lead to arrogance..."

Before Qian Bufan could finish his words.

Xue Jing suddenly retracted his smile and frowned, asking:

"Old Qian."

"Hm?"

"Do you think it's possible that an Inner Scenery expert, with a fiery aura comparable to an Outer Scenery one, just happened to be in our tavern?"

"Who else could it be..."

Elder Qian stopped halfway, realizing something was wrong.

Shang Wu was fighting someone in the back courtyard of the tavern?

Two figures, one plump and one thin, moved swiftly and instantly stood on the wall of the back courtyard, seeing the scene clearly.

In their minds, the future of the Clear Abyss Sect was currently challenging Shang Wu.

Qian Bufan almost had a blackout on the spot.

Clearly.

Little Li was much braver than they had imagined.

If you want to fight an Inner Scenery expert, you could have come to this old man!

When Shang Wu drinks, she doesn't hold back!

Xue Jing's scalp tingled.

The top twenty on the Hidden Dragon List could indeed withstand the might of an Inner Scenery expert, and the top ten could even face an Inner Scenery expert without falling behind.

But this so-called Inner Scenery expert doesn't include 'Human List' strongmen!

Although Shang Wu hasn't made the Human List, she could absolutely crush the eighth place on the Human List.

If that isn't the result of consuming an external elixir, what is?

...

On the roof.

Not long ago.

Ying Bing recalled the moment just before, her eyes couldn't help but daze, and a sense of weightlessness washed over her heart.

She didn't even have the mood to take out her money jar and count the coins.

Why did she, as if possessed by a ghost, kiss him just now?

Even if it was just a fleeting touch.

Even if he didn't know about it.

If it was just to prevent the system from randomly taking back the reward, she should be satisfied now, but why can't her heart calm down for a long time?

[Ding—]

[Three strikes and you're out. Since the host has lost three battles in a row, the system is reflecting on itself and undergoing an iteration upgrade.]

"Three times..."

Ying Bing felt as if a lifetime had passed.

Not long ago, he was still very childish, often playing tricks on her. Sometimes he put bugs in her clothes, sometimes he deliberately pulled her hair...

Well, he's still a bit childish now.

But he is already the nineteenth on the Hidden Dragon List, even if he was underestimated, and he has become the master of a divine weapon, and he has imprinted his understanding on the Strange Stone, and even became a best-selling author of illustrated books...

He has truly become famous throughout the world.

One day, he will enter the Imperial Capital and stand before all the prodigies of the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths...

Even with a神奇 system like hers, she now...

Oh, the system is upgrading.

The punishments from this system are always so abnormal.

[The system's original intention is to make the host feel shame and then be brave, please do not misunderstand.]

The system, which was in the middle of an upgrade, actually took the time to reply to her.

Ying Bing: "....."

In the silence.

She suddenly heard a shout from below:

"See if you still dare to look down on your master!"

Ying Bing was stunned.

Right.

She didn't agree to fight him just now...

---

Could it be that he... went to find Shang Wu?

...

As fast as lightning.

The two elders and Ying Bing realized what had happened only moments ago.

At this moment.

Shang Wu's fist was indeed about to strike that thin layer of golden light.

If this punch had shattered the golden light, she would have及时 withdrawn most of her strength, and her precious disciple would have only suffered minor injuries.

However, what she didn't expect was that this fleeting golden light remained completely unmoved.

"Vajra Body..."

The firelight was reflected in Li Mo's eyes; he could almost see every single strand of his master's hair. The lotus flower faintly appearing behind her made her look like a demon god descending from the heavens.

But he was completely unharmed.

Even though the effect of the Vajra Body, given his current physique, only lasted for an instant.

But it was in that instant.

He, at the Observation God Realm, had taken his master's attack head-on.

Turning decay into magic.

This... is a Divine Ability!

And this isn't even the upper limit of the Vajra Body.

"..."

Qian Bufan stood dumbfounded on the spot, his head buzzing.

Xue Jing was slightly better, after all, the old man's mentality had been honed by this kid long ago; he had seen plenty of strange things happen to Li Mo.

It seemed that no matter how outrageous the matter, it was reasonable when it came to him.

Just...

How on earth did this kid do it?

He wasn't the only one with this doubt.

On the roof.

"No wonder he asked me to go all out..."

Ying Bing's missed heartbeat finally returned to normal.

Her cultivation had yet to return to its peak, but her vision was still there.

The golden light that appeared just now clearly had nothing to do with the Lunar Deity's Will; it was a strange divine will she had never heard of.

They had just dual-cultivated yesterday.

She didn't detect any unusual divine will fluctuations from his soul.

Is it from the Strange Stone?

He seems to have been going to the top of the Sword Tower quite often lately...

A sense of powerlessness welled up in Ying Bing's heart.

She took out a small purple gourd from the big-headed doll.

So, holding the big-headed doll in her left hand and the small gourd in her right, her clear and deep eyes flickered.

Should she leave for a while and go to the Southern Frontier for training?

[Ding—]

[System iteration successful.]

[The next system ranking will expand the comparison range to a whole province.]

[While maintaining the original ranking mechanism, the comparison time will be more flexible.]

[The shortest interval is adjusted to half a month, and the longest comparison interval is extended to one year. Within the specified time, it can be actively initiated by the host.]

Ying Bing stared at the lines of text, her feelings becoming even more complicated.

She really wanted to win once.

Just once...

At the same time, the senior brothers and sisters who had just followed them in were also startled by the commotion.

Even though they knew that Junior Brother Li was exceptionally talented, when they found out what had happened, they still couldn't stay calm.

That was Elder Shang Wu!

In Ziyang Prefecture, she could make children stop crying at night; even the Sect Master had to give way to her in a fight!

"Junior Brother Li is tough!"

"Did he use a supreme treasure for protection? Given Junior Brother Li's financial resources, it's very possible, and I just saw a golden flash..."

"Did Elder Shang Wu hold back at the last moment?"

The senior brothers and sisters still found it too unbelievable.

Who at the Observation God Realm is this outrageous?

"Treasure disciple."

Shang Wu suddenly became serious.

"Huh?"

Little Li snapped back to attention.

His master's expression suddenly looked very serious.

"Come here, I have a request."

"What?"

"Even if you become more powerful than me in the future, you still have to call me master."

"...Alright."

Li Mo felt this sounded familiar.
