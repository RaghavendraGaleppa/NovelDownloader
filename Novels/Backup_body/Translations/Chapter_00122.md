# Chapter 122: A Sect-Leader-Level Powerhouse! The Flame God King!

The battle between Li Zhengjing and Gao Xuan was a clash between two True Qi realm cultivators, yet it erupted into a near-peak-level confrontation in the world!

The beach collapsed, the surrounding cliffs and trees were obliterated, and the wind and waves raged endlessly!

But as soon as the battle ceased, a chaotic melee erupted among numerous Human Immortals, Divine Spirits, and Arhats!

---

The Jiangshang Prefect mobilized the region's fortune, merging it with the power of the court's righteous deities, the Fangyin Divine General, and numerous elite soldiers, enhancing their strength!

Meanwhile, in the capital, the atmosphere was tense.

The scene displayed on the Zhen Dian Tong Xuan Mirror left the Grand Preceptor feeling uneasy.

"Gao Xuan is utterly exhausted after that sword strike, and Li Zhengjing's mana has dissipated—clearly, he's dead too," remarked one of the Divine Spirits, casting a mocking glance at the Grand Preceptor. "Back in the capital, you didn't dare to act, costing us three hundred spirit mines and even abandoning the Dragon Pillar of the Hall with its twenty-five golden dragons. Now, your excessive caution will likely make you miss the opportunity to seize the Heavenly Star Cave Heaven's fortune from Gao Xuan!"

Another Divine Spirit chimed in, "If not for your overcaution, had we gone to the Southeast Region and joined the battle, we could have secured Gao Xuan's fortune for the court and retrieved the Dragon Pillar of the Hall!"

A titled Human Immortal Prince sighed, "The current Grand Preceptor lacks the boldness of his predecessor."

"..."

The Grand Preceptor knew well that the Divine Spirits and Human Immortals present were trying to force him to step down, stripping him of the power bestowed by the nation's fortune.

Once that happened, he would lose the fortune's blessing and no longer possess near-sect-leader-level strength, retaining only his own Human Immortal Upper Realm cultivation.

With the new emperor freshly ascended and the court unstable, the Divine Spirits and Human Immortals present might harbor ulterior motives.

If the young emperor were misled into forcing him to resign, the Great Zhou Dynasty would descend into true chaos.

Yet the Grand Preceptor remained composed, unperturbed.

Because he had truly seized control of the Imperial Jade Seal.

In the past, a single imperial decree could strip him of his position. But after the recent upheaval in the capital, the new emperor lacked the authority to revoke his fortune-bestowed powers.

Ignoring the assembled Human Immortals and Divine Spirits, he gazed at the scene displayed on the Zhen Dian Tong Xuan Mirror and murmured, "The situation in Hongshan Town is far more complex than what we're seeing here..."

Sweeping his eyes over the crowd, he said slowly, "The little girl by Li Zhengjing's side hasn't appeared yet. Moreover... there's an even more formidable figure present, one capable of evading the Zhen Dian Tong Xuan Mirror's detection."

Clasping his hands behind his back, he added, "Had I not stopped you from going to Hongshan Town, you might have perished there today. If you don't believe me, keep watching."

The Grand Preceptor had a strong premonition.

Li Zhengjing wasn't dead yet!

And he was almost certain that the "corpse of Li Zhengjing," overlooked by the many powerhouses in Hongshan Town, would become the greatest variable in this battle.

"Now that the attention of the Central Plains is focused on the Southeast Region, the movements in the capital won't attract too much notice."

---

By the southeastern coast, chaos reigned as a great battle erupted.

Human Immortals, Divine Spirits, Arhats, and other powerhouses fought to seize Gao Xuan's corpse and claim his fortune.

They also sought Li Zhengjing's corpse, along with the Dragon Pillar of the Hall he possessed.

Some, pushed to the edges of the battlefield, even tried to capture the Five Elements Creation Tree!

Though the tree's origins were unknown, it had developed sentience and wielded power comparable to the True Qi realm. It also possessed an ancient mirror capable of emitting formidable rays of light—a potent weapon!

Amidst the chaos, a small figure emerged, swimming underwater before burrowing beneath the sand. When she peeked out, only half her horned head visible, she had already reached Li Zhengjing's side.

"Dead yet?"

"Not yet," Yuan Zhengfeng's voice replied. "He's refining that broken immortal sword. Protect him so the residual energy from the battle above doesn't disrupt the process. If the sword breaks free, he'll really die."

"Oh."

The little dragon girl picked up the jade fragment Yuan Zhengfeng resided in and dragged Li Zhengjing into the depths of the earth, heading back toward the sea.

But as they moved along the coast, they spotted a flood dragon swimming toward them.

Upon closer inspection, the flood dragon's body shimmered gold, but its true form was made of stone.

It was the Valley River Dragon God!

"Seek, and you shall find—effortlessly!"

The Valley River Dragon God was overjoyed. Sensing the divine battle on the shore, it thought, "They fight to the death, unaware that the prize has slipped into the sea and come right to me. This fortune is mine!"

It opened its maw wide, ready to devour them whole.

But at that moment, the little dragon girl stretched out a hand—her delicate, pale palm now covered in silver-white dragon scales, resembling a dragon's claw.

With a single grasp, the seawater churned into a vortex, trapping the Valley River Dragon God within!

A furious roar erupted!

The Valley River Dragon God struggled free, its divine might surging!

"Hmph?"

Displeased, the little dragon girl transformed both hands into dragon claws, stabilizing the vortex.

But in doing so, she released Li Zhengjing, who floated to the sea's surface.

This drew the attention of the battling powerhouses onshore, their divine senses sweeping over the sea.

A vortex swirled on the surface, imprisoning a stone dragon, while a small girl manipulated the currents.

More importantly, a figure floated outside the vortex—Li Zhengjing?

"Audacious!"

Fury erupted among the combatants.

While they fought fiercely, someone had stealthily tried to spirit away Li Zhengjing's corpse?

Did they take all these Human Immortals, Divine Spirits, and Arhats for fools?

Divine spells and techniques immediately blasted toward the sea.

A Human Immortal previously forced into the shallows turned and charged at Li Zhengjing.

Some, enraged, attacked the little dragon girl and the Valley River Dragon God, while others sought to seize Li Zhengjing's body in the chaos.

The battle on land continued—some chased the Five Elements Creation Tree, others fought over Gao Xuan's corpse.

But part of the battlefield had shifted to the sea!

The skies darkened, thunder rumbled, and flames surged.

Sword energy tore through the earth, annihilating everything in its path!

Torrential rain fell, and seawater flooded inland.

Even the thirty-thousand-strong army brought by the Fangyin Divine General dared not enter the fray directly. Instead, they channeled their military might into the general through talismans and seals.

The Fangyin Divine General plunged into the sea, thrusting his spear into the vortex's center to free the Valley River Dragon God!

With a backhanded grab, he tried to seize Li Zhengjing's corpse.

But at that moment, a beam of light struck, forcing him back.

The attacker was none other than the Grand Preceptor of the Great Xuan Dynasty.

---

Lin Fuxuan waved his hand, conjuring a luminous barrier around Li Zhengjing.

As he prepared to take the "corpse" away, he paused, sensing something. "This kid has suppressed all his energy, keeping it contained within his body without the slightest leak... He's still alive?"

Lin Fuxuan's heart swelled with joy.

What he wanted wasn't a corpse—it was a peerless genius, a future unrivaled powerhouse of the world!

With a grasp, he took the Dragon Pillar of the Hall from Li Zhengjing and unleashed twenty-two golden dragons with a flick of his wrist.

"That guy stole my Dragon Pillar of the Hall!" the Hanging Bird cried out indignantly from the sky.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official was about to speak when he noticed the solemn look in the eyes of the Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Venerate.

Though the Heavenly Venerate wore a bronze mask, his grave expression was evident.

Initially, the Heavenly Venerate had viewed the battle below as child's play—had he intervened, he could have suppressed all parties and claimed every fortune.

But after rising to his feet, he had sat back down, making no further moves.

"Is there someone in Hongshan Town powerful enough to threaten the Ten Thousand Calamities World-Saving Heavenly Venerate?" the Ghost Valley Spirit Official wondered silently.

If the Heavenly Venerate could sense the other party, then the reverse was also true.

The Heavenly Venerate's silence suggested that every word spoken here would reach the other's ears.

The Ghost Valley Spirit Official maintained a calm facade, but his heart sank. "It must be a sect-leader-level powerhouse..."

Such beings were few in the world. Which one had come?

With such a figure lurking in the shadows, who could truly benefit from this chaotic battle?

Li Zhengjing had orchestrated today's clash, but could he secure the fortune he sought amidst this turmoil, with an even greater power lurking behind the scenes?

A chill ran down the Ghost Valley Spirit Official's spine as he watched the battle below. "The mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole behind... They all think they're the oriole, but in truth, they're all just mantises."

Meanwhile, the "dead cicada"—Li Zhengjing—floated on the sea's surface, imprisoned by Lin Fuxuan.

Li Zhengjing had withdrawn all his True Qi into his dantian, even halting his breath.

He leaked not a wisp of energy, for he had no strength left to spare.

Every ounce of his True Qi had transformed into the Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi, focused on refining the fragment of Heavenly Profound Supreme White Metal within him.

An endless sharpness erupted inside his body, only to be healed by the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure!

But the broken sword's edge didn't just harm the flesh—it could injure the soul!

Even Yuan Zhengfeng, a Human Immortal with a solidified Yin Spirit, couldn't withstand its sharpness. That was why Li Zhengjing had expelled him—otherwise, Yuan Zhengfeng would have perished, his soul scattered!

All the sword's锋芒 was borne by Li Zhengjing alone!

"My physical wounds are healed by the Celestial Azure Dao Treasure."

"My soul is protected by the golden page, devouring all sharpness."

"Without these safeguards, even as a Human Immortal, I wouldn't have survived this broken sword's edge..."

Li Zhengjing was now certain—this was an immortal sword wielded by a true immortal!

Nothing in this world could compare to it!

Yet even such a sword had been shattered!

The fragment given by the fake medicine seller was a piece that had broken off during the sword's destruction.

Without this fragment, he wouldn't have been able to refine the broken sword. He would have ended up like Gao Xuan—controlled by the sword, as if possessed!

Now, his Great Yan Cave Void Myriad Transformations Sword Qi was entirely focused on the broken sword, not a trace leaking out.

Without this fragment, his sword qi would have been seen as an "enemy" by the immortal sword, crushed by its sharpness.

But with the fragment reattached, his sword qi could flow through it, eroding the sword's remnants and allowing him to refine it!

Currently, Li Zhengjing's right arm was severed at the elbow. His bones, flesh, and even internal organs were lacerated by the sword's锋芒. The Celestial Azure Dao Treasure continuously healed him, but the sword's erosion outpaced the recovery.

His wounds were still worsening!

"Give me another quarter-hour, and I'll have preliminarily refined the sword."

Li Zhengjing thought, "I won't fully master it yet, but at least it won't keep injuring me..."

He was oblivious to the outside world.

The golden page had shown him that all he needed to do now was focus on refining the broken sword.

Once that was done, no external threat would matter!

Meanwhile, the battle reached its climax as the powerhouses shed all pretense and fought to kill.

The first to fall was the Divine Mother, one of the Southeast Region's three deities. Her divine stone shattered, crashing to the ground.

The Pure Dust Arhat of the Cloud-Sky Monastery, his golden body cracked, fled northward, casting a resentful glance behind him.

The Three Yang Duke's divine power wavered, but he managed to capture the Five Elements Creation Tree and seize the Illuminating Profound Mirror, using its light to wound a Human Immortal from the Luofu Immortal Sect.

Lin Fuxuan clashed with the Fangyin Divine General. Despite the latter's army's might and the Jiangshang Prefect's加持, Lin Fuxuan held the upper hand.

Then, laughter rang out from the sky.

"How lively! I've arrived just in time!"

Two beams of light descended—one landing beside Gao Xuan, the other piercing Lin Fuxuan's barrier to seize Li Zhengjing.

The newcomers were two black-armored divine generals!

"The Qian and Kun Generals under the Flame King?"

The battlefield fell silent.

The Flame King!

A figure who had once contended with the Great Zhou's founding emperor for supremacy!

After his defeat, he had retreated to the Southern Wasteland, where he was said to have died six hundred years ago.

Yet now, he radiated divine power!

His presence suppressed the Human Immortals and Divine Spirits.

In life, he had been a sect-leader-level powerhouse. Even inhabiting a divine vessel, though not at his peak, he remained one of the strongest beings below that level!

Moreover, his Qian and Kun Generals were both Human Immortal Upper Realm experts!

No one had expected the Flame God King of the Southern Wasteland to be drawn here by the fortune!

"Rumor has it the Great Zhou has weakened. It's time for me to counterattack the Central Plains and topple the dynasty..."

The Flame God King laughed heartily. "Today, all fortunes here shall be mine. The Heavenly Star Cave Heaven's fortune is heaven's will!"

The Qian and Kun Generals flashed back to his side.

The Flame God King gripped Gao Xuan's corpse, frowned, and said, "A dried-up corpse, devoid of any marvel. The fortune isn't with him."

Then his gaze shifted to Li Zhengjing.

At that moment, Li Zhengjing slowly opened his eyes.

Their eyes met.

Silence fell.

The wind howled, the waves crashed, and the sound of the tide was deafeningly clear.
