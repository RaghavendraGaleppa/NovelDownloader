# Chapter 34: Flushing Out the Snake  

"Patrol Officer Tian, please forgive me. I know what to do."  

He Changkong quickly turned to Wang Chan, took out five spirit coins, and placed them gently on the table. With a warm smile, he clasped his hands and said, "Brother Wang, I offended you earlier. Consider these five coins a token of friendship. Let’s stay in touch."  

"You’re too kind, Brother He. As they say, no discord, no concord. If you ever visit Lotus Mountain, be sure to drop by for a drink," Wang Chan replied with a smile, though inwardly, he thought, *This He Changkong was arrogant and overbearing earlier, but now he’s groveling. A man who can bend and stretch like that… is too dangerous to leave alive.*  

The beauty mark on the woman’s face twitched slightly in satisfaction as she nodded, allowing He Changkong to leave.  

Originally, He Changkong had planned to collect protection fees from the other tenants on Lotus Mountain. But with Patrol Officer Tian and her team conducting inspections, he had to step aside out of respect for their authority.  

Once they descended the mountain and entered the forest, He Changkong dismissed the rest of his gang, keeping only one stout, mid-level Qi Condensation cultivator by his side. The two walked along a narrow forest path.  

"Boss, I don’t get it. That pretty boy is just some backwater rogue cultivator. Why not just wait for him to leave the mountain and deal with him in a secluded spot…?" the stout cultivator muttered under his breath.  

He Changkong didn’t slow his pace, his voice icy. "After following me for so many years, all the way from Blackwater City to here, you still haven’t learned a thing."  

The stout man flushed, embarrassed.  

"Do you think someone who caught the attention of Bai Shaofeng—a direct descendant of a Foundation Establishment family—is just some ordinary rogue cultivator?" He Changkong shot him a disdainful glance. "Would you even spare a second glance at a stray dog on the roadside?"  

The stout man suddenly understood. "So, Boss, you were deliberately flushing out the snake?"  

"Exactly. The White Mountain region is chaotic, and we’re treading on thin ice here." He Changkong sighed deeply. "When we pushed him like that earlier, did Wang Chan show even a hint of fear or panic?"  

The stout man fell into thought.  

"That pretty boy isn’t simple." He Changkong smirked, his expression unreadable. "And then, right after, we ran into Patrol Officer Tian. You know what’s interesting? She’s Bai Shaofeng’s Dao companion. Quite the coincidence, huh…?"  

"Ah…" The stout man couldn’t help but grin suggestively.  

"Bai Shaofeng treats me like a dog, but he’s not my master. Just because he throws me a bone doesn’t mean I’ll risk my life for him." He Changkong suddenly stopped walking, silent for a moment before adding, "For now, we don’t act rashly."  

The stout man nodded without hesitation.  

"Ah Wei, remember this—never underestimate anyone in this world, or you’ll be the one who ends up dead." Seeing his subordinate’s obedience, He Changkong couldn’t resist offering advice before resuming his brisk pace.

But as he walked, the image of Wang Chan’s warm smile before they parted flashed in his mind. He halted abruptly, a murderous glint in his eyes.  

"But since we’ve already flushed out the snake, we have to kill it—otherwise, it’ll come back to bite us. That pretty boy seems ruthless. Find out everything about him from the past ten years. Dig up his roots and background."  

"Understood." The stout man nodded, then scratched his head with a naive expression. "But what if his background is too solid?"  

"Then we disappear. We leave, as far as possible, before he gets a chance to come after us."  

Hearing this, the stout man felt a surge of admiration. His boss was truly far-sighted and cunning. Eager to learn more, he stepped closer and asked, "Boss, where to now?"  

"Home."  

"It’s still early."  

"You have something else?"  

The stout man leaned in conspiratorially. "Boss, I booked a flower house."  

"What flower house?" He Changkong frowned, sensing his subordinate had picked up some bad habits.  

"Those new courtesans at Blossom Grotto—green-eyed, golden-haired. Their skin’s a bit rough, but they’re all built like warhorses…"  

He Changkong’s interest was piqued, but just as he was about to agree, he suddenly remembered something and shook his head. "Your sister-in-law is home alone. I can’t leave her. You go ahead."  

Without giving the stout man a chance to protest, he strode away like flowing water.  

---  

The morning breeze brushed against his face, lifting strands of his hair. The fragrance from the beauty-marked woman was unexpectedly pleasant.  

Compared to the aloof Daoist Chen, she seemed more… mature.  

Wang Chan was tempted to ask if she used some special spiritual bath or if it was just her natural scent.  

The other patrol officers had already moved on to inspect other parts of Lotus Mountain, leaving her sitting gracefully across the table, sipping tea with an air of untouchable elegance.  

*Now she looks like the proper daughter of a Foundation Establishment family.*  

"Thank you, Daoist Tian," Wang Chan said politely, raising his teacup.  

"Oh?" The woman’s lips curled mischievously as she leaned forward, her ample curves pressing against the edge of the table. She whispered in his ear, "And how do you plan to thank me?"  

Wang Chan immediately stood and stepped back.  

*This woman…*  

He was speechless.  

The newly repaired gate wasn’t even properly closed yet.  

Seeing his retreat, the woman smirked victoriously before resuming her dignified posture.  

They drank tea in silence for a while.  

Then, as if remembering something, Wang Chan broke the silence. "Is Daoist Bai not on patrol duty?"  

"He’s responsible for the eastern district of White Mountain City. Last time, he only came because I was injured." She didn’t lean in this time, much to Wang Chan’s relief.  

But then, unexpectedly, she switched to a secret voice transmission, her tone teasing. "Last month, he resigned from the patrol division due to family matters. He’s visiting old friends in Green Mountain City and won’t be back for a year or two."  

"I see." Wang Chan replied absentmindedly, though for some reason, he felt a weight lift from his chest.  

"Don’t worry, he won’t barge in like last time," she transmitted again.  

"Ah…" Wang Chan was at a loss for words.  

*Damn woman, can’t you just talk normally? One of these days, I might just stop purifying demonic thoughts and teach you a lesson myself.*  

"The wilderness has been restless lately." Seeming to sense his discomfort, she set down her teacup and spoke seriously. "Be careful when you visit the market."  

"Thank you for the warning, Daoist Tian." Wang Chan cupped his hands. "You patrol these lands—stay safe as well."  

"No need for formalities, Brother Wang." She stood, adjusting her snug armor as she walked toward the door. Then, via transmission, she added, "After all, we’re not just friends. We’re neighbors now."  

"What?"  

"Cave No. 70 next door… I secretly rented it."  

Wang Chan: "…"
