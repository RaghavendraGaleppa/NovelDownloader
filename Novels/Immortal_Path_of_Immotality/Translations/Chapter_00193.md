# Chapter 191: Stop Fighting, You Two

The two Confucian scholars stood frozen, carefully examining Lin Shan. The white-robed young man before them radiated a sunny and refined aura, with thunder and wind energies swirling around him, exuding an upright and harmonious presence—nothing like a demonic cultivator. For a moment, they doubted their initial judgment.

Lin Shan smiled faintly. "May I ask for the esteemed names and origins of you two, fellow Daoists?"

The scholar on the left replied, "I am Dai Budong, from the Yun Chuan Academy!"

The one on the right added, "I am Zhu Duiyou, from the Jing Yang School!"

In unison, they asked, "Might we inquire about your background, fellow Daoist?"

"Whoosh!"

Lin Shan flicked open his Five Elements Feather Fan with a flourish. The five feathers—gold, wood, water, fire, and earth—shimmered in a dazzling display, leaving the two scholars momentarily entranced. With one hand tucked behind his back, he deliberately revealed the Lang Huan jade pendant at his waist, showcasing his refined taste.

"I am Bu Peiying, from the—"

"Hmm???"

"...the Wan Liu Academy in the Black... Black Gold Mountain Range."

"Respect, respect!"

After exchanging pleasantries, the two scholars cautiously voiced their doubts. "Forgive our ignorance, but we've never heard of a Wan Liu Academy among the Confucian sects in this kingdom. Might you enlighten us?"

Lin Shan straightened his expression and bowed solemnly toward the distance. "The Wan Liu Academy belongs to the Legalist school, originating from a mysterious and ancient eastern land. It's no surprise its reputation hasn't reached the State of Lu."

The scholars nodded in understanding, though their suspicions lingered. Glancing at the ongoing battle between Immortal Huang and Protector Yan in the sky, as well as the chaotic melee involving Luan Chun and others on the ground, they probed further.

"Brother Bu, if you're not affiliated with the demonic path, why were you traveling on the same boat as these individuals?"

Lin Shan's face twitched slightly. With an inward sigh of apology, he feigned embarrassment and lamented to the heavens, "It's shameful to admit, but I was raised under the strict guidance of my sect elders. As soon as I ventured out to gain experience after achieving some cultivation progress, I was captured by these demonic villains and subjected to relentless torment. Thankfully, you rescued me—otherwise, I'd never have escaped their clutches..."

Though sympathetic, the scholars remained wary, their eyes lingering on the miniature skull pendant dangling from Lin Shan's waist.

"If that's the case, why were you wearing such a ghostly trinket? Was it for cultivation purposes?"

Without missing a beat, Lin Shan yanked off the pendant and hurled it aside with feigned fury. "This was forced upon me by those demonic scoundrels to monitor my every move. It was never mine to begin with."

Just as the two were about to offer consolation, they heard a pained yelp from the discarded pendant and turned to look.

Lin Shan's heart skipped a beat, but he quickly explained, "That thing housed a malevolent ghost planted by the demonic villains. I just exterminated it with my thunder techniques."

Only then did the scholars set aside their doubts, apologizing for their earlier suspicion and begging forgiveness for nearly wronging an innocent. Lin Shan waved it off with a smile, claiming it was only natural.

Yet, in the very next instant—

All three struck simultaneously, their friendly façades crumbling without warning as if by prior agreement.

Lin Shan swung his Five Elements Feather Fan, unleashing a blazing inferno so intense it felt as if their hair might combust.

Dai Budong, clearly prepared, flicked a massive inkstone from his sleeve and hurled it forward. The flames from the fan were instantly doused by ink spewing from the stone, which then barreled toward Lin Shan.

"Clang—"

Zhu Duiyou stood frozen, gripping a disciplinary ruler, as the inkstone clattered harmlessly to the ground.

Dai Budong glared at him in outrage. "Useless fool!"

Lin Shan broke into a cold sweat. He hadn't expected the other two to share his idea of a sneak attack! Thankfully, Zhu Duiyou had deflected the inkstone—had that heavy projectile landed, even his Yun Copper Heart Mirror wouldn't have spared him serious injury.

The three now stood at a standoff, eyeing each other warily.

Dai Budong subtly signaled Zhu Duiyou before solemnly producing a box, cradling it as if it held a priceless treasure. As Lin Shan leaned in to see what was inside—

The box's back split open, releasing a barrage of needle-like projectiles glistening with venom.

Lin Shan's expression darkened. This guy was truly treacherous! He barely managed to leap back, avoiding the deadly hail.

"Swish, swish—"

"Clink, clink—"

Zhu Duiyou stood awkwardly to the side again, now holding a golden net filled with the intercepted needles.

Dai Budong's rage erupted. "What the hell are you doing?!"

Zhu Duiyou looked sheepish. "I thought you wanted me to restrain him..."

Lin Shan exhaled in relief. For a Confucian scholar, Dai Budong was shockingly underhanded—that feint had nearly fooled him. Once more, Zhu Duiyou had unwittingly saved him.

Now, Dai Budong adopted a formal stance, clearly preparing a major technique. As he chanted poetry, dark clouds gathered overhead, rumbling with thunder.

Lin Shan raised his heart mirror for defense while drawing his Water-Severing Sword, watching warily as the incantation crescendoed—until a thunderclap boomed!

Before Lin Shan could react, the ground beneath him shifted. He barely dodged as an armored pangolin burst from below—Dai Budong's chanting had been a ruse to mask his spirit beast's ambush.

Just as the creature's gaping maw was about to clamp down—

"Screech—"

A golden chain lashed out from the side, binding the pangolin tightly and eliciting pained howls.

Dai Budong finally snapped. Rolling up his sleeves, he charged at Zhu Duiyou with the inkstone. "I've had enough of your nonsense!"

Zhu Duiyou scrambled away in panic, pleading, "We have an enemy right here! Don't turn on each other now!"

The two immediately descended into infighting, Dai Budong's pent-up fury from past grievances erupting as he completely ignored Lin Shan.

Watching the chaotic brawl, Lin Shan decided it was best not to complicate things further. With hundreds of thousands of cultivators battling across the region, escaping was the priority.

Just as he turned to leave, another Confucian cultivator—a middle-aged man in a white robe emblazoned with "Supervisor"—approached from the sky. Spotting the internal conflict, he moved to investigate.

Lin Shan's heart sank. Feigning urgency, he shouted, "Brothers Zhu, Dai—stop fighting! Stop this at once!"

The two continued their frenzied duel.

The supervisor eyed Lin Shan suspiciously. "You are...?"

Lin Shan stepped forward. "Bu Peiying of Wan Liu Academy. These two senior brothers are fighting among themselves."

"Wan Liu Academy?" The supervisor frowned.

"That's not important! What matters is they're fighting! Go stop them!" Lin Shan urged.

As the supervisor strode toward the brawlers, Lin Shan seized the moment to flee. The instant he left, a trapping formation erupted behind him, ensnaring the three Confucian cultivators in bafflement.

Unbeknownst to them, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had secretly set up the formation after being tossed aside earlier. Now, it caught up with Lin Shan, and the two vanished into the distance.
