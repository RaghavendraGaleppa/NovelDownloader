# Chapter 186: Soul Battle, Bloodline Power

"Wind Escape Talisman!"

The four mermaid cultivators not only guessed the magic treasure in Lin Shan's hand but also recognized the cyan talisman emitting faint wind spiritual energy. Their hearts sank—a wind-element cultivator paired with a Wind Escape Talisman meant they couldn't touch him no matter how skilled they were.

Luan Chun, who had just opened her eyes, gaped in shock, frozen in place.

Lin Shan didn't bother checking the conch storage artifact—now wasn't the time. With a faint smile, his figure trembled and vanished into the wind once more.

The four mermaid cultivators, having just retrieved their magic weapons, immediately huddled together in fear of being picked off one by one.

However, the late-stage Foundation Establishment mermaid quickly realized that wind escape techniques relied on ambient wind spiritual energy. By disrupting the surrounding spiritual energy, they could prevent Lin Shan from approaching.

"Boom—"

Within a fifty-meter radius, blue water spiritual energy erupted violently. The mermaid held a crystalline deep-blue orb covered in dense inscriptions that crackled with energy, forming a massive vortex around the four of them.

"Swish—"

Lin Shan reappeared fifty meters away. The mermaid's orb, an auxiliary magic tool, had indeed disrupted the wind spiritual energy, preventing his approach.

But Lin Shan wasn't out of tricks yet.

He glanced back at the flying vessel's battle. The mermaid warriors, far outnumbering the demonic cultivators, fought in coordinated formations, each group's combined strength nearing Foundation Establishment level. The demonic cultivators were being pushed back.

Fortunately, Black Skeleton Demon Lord wielded his Bone Banner, summoning skeletal soldiers to hold the line. These skeletons, now armed with various magic weapons thanks to their master's craftsmanship, formed an effective defense.

Seeing the situation under control, Lin Shan turned his attention back to his own battle. Black Skeleton Demon Lord could handle the mermaid warriors—he needed to finish his fight quickly.

---

Lin Shan sat cross-legged in mid-air, supported by a large banner. He produced an ancient black-brown zither and placed it on his lap.

This zither, obtained after the Battle of Bianliang Capital, had never been used in combat. Though its origins were unclear, the five Soul-Striking Inscriptions described by the Enhancement Panel gave Lin Shan confidence.

"Zheng—"

A melodious note resounded across the sea, serene as a mountain stream, ethereal as an orchid in a valley, soothing as aged wine.

"Buzz—"

The four mermaid cultivators froze, their minds ensnared in illusions. In their minds, they swam freely among coral reefs, carefree and joyous.

But as Foundation Establishment cultivators, their spiritual senses stirred, resisting the illusion. Their faces twisted in struggle.

Lin Shan remained calm, plucking the second string.

"Zheng—"

The mermaids relaxed again, now envisioning their childhood visit to the East Sea Dragon Palace with their elder—a grand feast of delicacies and rare wines.

With the third pluck, the scene shifted once more. Their faces contorted with rage as they relived a memory of a golden-core demonic cultivator slaughtering their kin.

---

Above the churning waves, the flying vessel echoed with battle cries.

Lin Shan sat playing his zither while the four mermaids stood motionless, their expressions shifting as they sank deeper into illusions, their souls shackled.

Luan Chun watched from the side, unsure whether to intervene. She studied Lin Shan's profile, struck by how much he'd grown since their first meeting over a decade ago—from a naive youth to someone who could effortlessly suppress five Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Seizing the moment, Lin Shan struck. A jade-green rod shot out, shattering one mermaid's defenses and skull in three swift blows. The body plummeted into the sea.

The remaining mermaids struggled to break free, but the zither—originally prepared by the Black Lotus Sect Leader for his illegitimate son—was a peerless treasure. Once ensnared, escape was nearly impossible.

Two more mermaids fell to the rod's relentless strikes.

Just as Lin Shan prepared to finish the last mermaid, a furious roar split the air:

"YOU DARE?!"

A golden-core mermaid elder, noticing his granddaughter's peril, bellowed in rage.

The shout jolted the mermaid awake. Seeing her companions dead, she barely raised her blue orb in time to block the jade rod.

"Crack—"

The orb shattered, releasing a surge of water spiritual energy.

Lin Shan glanced up. Elder Yan was losing her duel with the mermaid elder, who now glared at him with murderous intent. Undeterred, Lin Shan resumed playing.

"Clang—clang—"

The music turned urgent, evoking charging armies. The mermaid's eyes glazed over as she fell into another illusion.

Lin Shan seized the chance to initiate a forced soul contract. A blue light flickered in her mind as their souls clashed.

"Ah!"

"Ugh!"

The mermaid screamed, clutching her head. Lin Shan's nose bled from the strain.

Black Skeleton Demon Lord, watching from afar, transmitted urgently: "Are you insane? Her soul strength surpasses yours! Stop now!"

"I'm not backing down!" Lin Shan gritted his teeth. "With the Void Star Disc tempering my soul, I can match her!"

He redoubled his efforts. If he could enslave a mermaid, why keep the water bear chieftain? Visions of a beautiful mermaid attendant filled his mind.

Their souls wrestled fiercely. Just as both reached their limits, a surge of starlight from Lin Shan's storage bracelet bolstered his spirit—the Void Star Disc's spirit, Xiao Xin, had intervened at the critical moment.

The blue light in the mermaid's mind dimmed as the contract took hold.

Lin Shan exhaled shakily, exhausted. His opponent fared no better, dazed from the mental assault.

Above, the mermaid elder completed his incantation in a rage.

"Azure Sea Tide Art!"

The sea erupted. A kilometer-wide fog enveloped the area, blinding sight and spiritual sense. Deafening tidal roars assaulted everyone's ears, forcing them to cover them in pain.

Within the fog, Black Skeleton Demon Lord reappeared beside Lin Shan and Luan Chun, deploying defensive artifacts.

"To think a minor mermaid clan would have one who awakened a bloodline power!" he muttered. "I wonder if Elder Yan can withstand this..."
