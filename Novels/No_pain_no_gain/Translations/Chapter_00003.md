# Chapter 3: Seven Absolute Hall

The carriage sped west from Qingniu Town, picking up a few more children along the way. Finally, on the evening of the fifth day, they arrived at Caixia Mountain, the headquarters of the Seven Mysteries Sect.

As Han Li followed Han Zhen down from the carriage, they heard a hearty voice.

"Brother Wang, what took you so long?"

"Hall Master Yue, we were delayed a bit on the road. Thank you for your concern."

Protector Wang stood before the crowd and respectfully bowed to a red-faced old man. With a somewhat fawning expression, he leaned closer and whispered a few words. The red-faced old man's gaze swept over the group of children, finally resting on Han Zhen. Compared to Protector Wang, who still needed to check bone structure, Hall Master Yue's eyes were much sharper; he immediately recognized Han Zhen's extraordinary bone structure, marking him as a promising talent for martial arts. Hall Master Yue nodded with satisfaction at Han Zhen, who met his gaze neither humbly nor arrogantly. "Let them rest well tonight. We'll begin selecting qualified disciples tomorrow morning." As for those who didn't pass, they would naturally be sent back down the mountain.

Over thirty children were arranged to rest in a cluster of earthen houses in the Clear Guest Courtyard. Apart from a few children from wealthy families who showed some disdain, everyone else was excited, discussing their experiences upon entering Caixia Mountain.

The next day, everyone was led to a place called Bone Refining Cliff. Behind Hall Master Yue stood several spirited-looking youths. Seeing all the children present, Hall Master Yue stepped forward, pointed at the distant cliff top, and announced loudly:

"Listen carefully, everyone. From the bamboo forest onwards, only those who follow the markers and reach the cliff top before noon will be admitted into the Seven Mysteries Sect. If you don't make it before noon, but your performance shows commendable qualities, you will still have a chance to become a registered disciple."

As the saying goes, 'looking at a mountain can exhaust a horse trying to cross it.' Most children who had always lived in town didn't take this seriously. Han Zhen looked back at Han Li, seeing that although his expression was a little nervous, he showed no fear, which put Han Zhen at ease. Hall Master Yue waited for a while, and only when the sun finally peeked out did he say, "Prepare to depart. The senior brothers will be behind you, ensuring your safety."

The moment his words fell, over thirty children rushed into the bamboo forest and scattered. Han Zhen took only a few seconds to dash to the very front, quickly widening the gap between himself and the other children. Once the test officially began, Han Zhen, who had been low-key since boarding the carriage, finally showed his fangs. There might only be one spot in the Seven Absolute Hall, and he would absolutely not yield it to anyone. After his bone structure transformation, his body was no longer what it once was. His slender arms were like those of a spirit ape, and Han Zhen glided forward, using the spring-back force of the bamboo. At the same time, Han Zhen still had enough energy to glance back at the other children, only to find that only Hall Master Yue was following him like a phantom, while the others were almost out of sight.

Han Zhen then stopped concerning himself with Han Li's situation and focused his attention on the test. Meanwhile, Wu Yan, who was second in speed, was utterly frustrated, cursing Han Zhen endlessly in his mind. He tried to imitate Han Zhen's movements, but his handwork was far too inferior. Carelessly grasping at air, he almost slipped down the mountainside, which only deepened his hatred for Han Zhen. He knew that only the most outstanding child in each batch could enter the Seven Absolute Hall. Yet, among this batch of children, it had clearly been arranged that there would be no one capable of threatening him. Where did such a formidable individual suddenly come from? Wu Yan recalled that Han Zhen had been among those who complimented him on the carriage, realizing that Han Zhen had clearly been playing him for a fool at the time, which further fueled his rage.

In less than an hour, Han Zhen completed the entire trial. At the cliff top, people were already waiting. One portly old man dressed in a blue official's robe was stunned for a moment upon seeing Han Zhen arrive so quickly, then looked at Hall Master Yue with a questioning gaze. Only after Hall Master Yue stepped forward and exchanged a few quiet words with him did his expression soften. With Hall Master Yue's hint, Han Zhen learned the man's identity: he was Wu Yan's patron within the Seven Mysteries Sect. It seemed Han Zhen had stolen Wu Yan's thunder and coincidentally offended him.

"This junior, Han Zhen, greets Deputy Sect Master." Han Zhen performed a cupped-fist salute, neither humble nor arrogant.

"Mhm." The portly old man nodded, his attitude neither warm nor cold.

Han Zhen had seen plenty of such old schemers who abused their power in his previous life. As he was set on cultivating immortality, he didn't bother to argue and stepped aside. Arriving at the edge of the cliff top, he watched the other children participating in the trial. Before long, he finally spotted Han Li. Like most children who hadn't practiced martial arts, he was slowly climbing upwards. Han Li stopped several times along the way, but each time he was about to fall behind those ahead, he would find a surge of determination, insisting on catching up.

The trial continued until noon. Han Zhen watched Han Li, who was brought up by a senior brother, covered in injuries. His expression was a little sad; this test must have been quite a blow to his mentality. In the end, only eight people qualified. Six entered the Hundred Forgings Hall, while Han Zhen, ranked first, and Wu Yan, ranked second, were directly admitted to the Seven Absolute Hall, qualifying them to learn the Seven Mysteries Sect's ultimate techniques. Hearing that two people were directly admitted to the Seven Absolute Hall in this batch, many senior brothers who knew the rules were initially stunned. However, once they saw the Deputy Sect Master beside Wu Yan, they understood what was going on. Though they showed no outward reaction, inwardly they held nothing but contempt for this 'connected' individual.

What surprised everyone was that among the children who hadn't completed the trial, two named Han Li and Zhang Tie were specially allowed by Hall Master Yue to stay and lay foundations due to their ability to endure hardship. They would be assessed again in six months, and even if they failed that, they could still become outer disciples.

Han Zhen glanced at Zhang Tie, who looked a bit mature for his age, wondering if he should give him a hand if the opportunity arose in the future. Han Li looked gratefully at Han Zhen; thanks to his "Brother Zhen's" instructions, Han Li had persevered until the very end of the trial.

The rest of the unsuccessful children were led down the mountain by Protector Wang and sent home. Han Zhen watched as two other senior brothers led Han Li and the others away, with Han Li occasionally glancing back. The old man in the official's robe exchanged a few words with Wu Yan and then left. Wu Yan, his face dark, stared at Han Zhen with ill intent, his resentment utterly unconcealed even with Hall Master Yue present. Hall Master Yue, however, said nothing, thinking that any conflicts would naturally resolve themselves after a few fights in the future. He then beckoned the two to follow him to the Seven Absolute Hall for registration and to pay respects to the Ancestral Master before officially entering.

Caixia Mountain was vast, its mountain range stretching for dozens of li. There were dozens of peaks, large and small, each occupied by a different hall. The peak Han Zhen was headed to was not in the same direction as Han Li's. Presumably, at this moment, Han Li and Zhang Tie were about to encounter Doctor Mo, who would take them away under the pretext of needing children to refine pills and gather herbs.

"One month," Han Zhen sighed softly in his heart. That was the day Doctor Mo would impart the nameless incantation to Han Li. Whether he could step onto the path of cultivation would soon be revealed.
