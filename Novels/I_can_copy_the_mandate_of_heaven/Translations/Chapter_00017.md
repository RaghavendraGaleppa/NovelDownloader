## Chapter 17: The Longevity Formula

As Li Zhiming watched Da Niu leave, he quickly slipped a bottle of herbs into the pocket of Da Niu's pants, which his mother had sewn for him. He patted Da Niu's back and comforted him, "I'll come visit you again in a couple of days!"

Da Niu looked back at his companion, feeling a growing distance between them.

Upon returning to the valley, it was already afternoon, and Li Zhiming's stomach was growling with hunger. He had skipped breakfast to bring Da Niu a steamed bun. However, being in the valley was still better than going hungry.

Before he could find something to eat, Mo Daren called Li Zhiming and Han Li back to his room.

"Take this book and read it slowly," Mo Daren said, handing them a thin, yellowed booklet. "For now, focus on this. If you have any questions, come ask me. But after a month, I'll ask you about your progress."

With a wave of his hand, Mo Daren indicated that he had other things to attend to. "Go back now."

As they left Mo Daren's room, Han Li and Li Zhiming examined their new material in the sunlight. Li Zhiming asked, "What is this?"

Han Li studied the cover carefully before uncertainly saying, "It seems to be called 'The Longevity Formula'."

"What is it for?" Li Zhiming looked puzzled. Shouldn't they be learning the Seven Mysteries Gate's child formula and practicing the Positive Yang energy?

Han Li shook his head. "Our master told us to practice it, so let's just do it."

The two of them returned to their room, sat cross-legged in the wood storage room, and began to study the booklet. Li Zhiming asked Han Li to read it aloud. The text was a short formula, not obscure, but Han Li struggled to read it. After three readings, Li Zhiming had memorized it.

As Li Zhiming pondered the formula, he felt perplexed. "This thing is supposed to cultivate a 'cool and refreshing' energy inside the body?"

"Isn't the Positive Yang energy supposed to ignite a fire within?" Li Zhiming wondered. "What's the point of this?"

Li Zhiming watched Da Niu's body grow stronger and compared it to their senior brothers, who seemed like powerful beasts. He admired their abilities but felt uncertain about this new formula.

"Let's just practice it as master instructed," Han Li suggested. "You should try it too, so we won't get scolded by master."

Li Zhiming nodded and began to practice. However, as they sat in meditation, Li Zhiming noticed something strange. Above Han Li's head, a line of text appeared: "Deep Red, Great Late Bloomer: Longevity Formula, 0/1300."

Li Zhiming was taken aback. What was happening?

As they continued to practice, Li Zhiming couldn't sense any changes within himself. His body felt like a deep abyss, and he remained still, surrounded by darkness.

Hours passed, and Li Zhiming opened his eyes, feeling frustrated. When he glanced at Han Li, he saw the text had changed: "Deep Red, Great Late Bloomer: Longevity Formula, 3/1300."

Li Zhiming was stunned. Why was this happening?

Han Li opened his eyes, and Li Zhiming asked, "How do you feel?"

Han Li thought for a moment before responding, "I feel... something." He didn't want to reveal too much, fearing it might discourage Li Zhiming.

A month went by, and Mo Daren called them to his room again. Li Zhiming felt a sense of trepidation.

"Let's see how you've progressed," Mo Daren said, his expression neutral. He examined Li Zhiming first, but his body showed no signs of the energy. Then, he turned to Han Li.

As Mo Daren sensed the energy within Han Li, his eyes lit up. "Ah, excellent! You've done it, Han Li!"

Mo Daren's enthusiasm was overwhelming. He had been searching for this for twenty years.

"Continue to practice diligently, Han Li," Mo Daren instructed. "You must focus on it."

As they left the room, Li Zhiming couldn't help but feel dejected. Why couldn't he cultivate the energy while Han Li progressed rapidly?

On their way back, Li Zhiming sighed. "Why aren't you happy?"

Han Li simply shrugged.
