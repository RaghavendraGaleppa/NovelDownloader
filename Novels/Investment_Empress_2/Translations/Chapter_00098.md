# Chapter 98: The Fundamental Diagram of Observing the Gods, The Fury of the Burning Jade Forest (1/2)

“What are you doing?”

“Picking... picking up trash.”

“But I haven’t left yet.”

“Mr. Hammer... doesn’t seem... like a bad person.”

Jiang Chulong first poked Liu Heng with a small branch. Finding that he was like a puddle of mud and truly dead, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.

He was dead. If no one wanted his things, they were trash.

She could take them.

Jiang Chulong timidly raised her head again, her small eyes filled with hope.

“......Go ahead.”

Li Mo’s mouth twitched slightly. He asked again, “You’re not afraid of me, but what if you run into other bad people?”

“I’ve... I’ve run into them before...”

“Bad people... I hit them... with this.”

Jiang Chulong shook the branch in her hand, then used it to pick away the items from Liu Heng’s embrace one by one. She seemed quite excited.

After all, she usually didn’t have so many things to pick up; she could only pick up some odds and ends that no one wanted.

Li Mo fell silent.

So this is what you meant by practicing the sword while picking up trash?

It’s a miracle she hasn’t gotten into trouble until now.

Wait...

It doesn’t seem to be because of luck.

After pondering for a moment, he said in a deep voice, “Don’t come out to pick things up recently. The city isn’t safe.”

“But if I don’t pick... I won’t have... money.”

“What do you need money for?”

“To buy... buy cloth... to make clothes.”

“Is this enough money now?”

Li Mo saw her pull out a few tattered silver notes from Liu Heng’s body.

“Enough... enough.”

Jiang Chulong nodded seriously.

“Then go home quickly.”

He paused, then added, “But you can’t have this thing.”

With a sweep of his internal energy, he卷起 (rolled) the statue that Jiang Chulong had just touched.

“Thank you... Mr. Hammer...”

“I’m leaving now.”

Jiang Chulong was very happy. She even waved her little hand twice lightly before tiptoeing away.

Her thin, small back disappeared into the night, like a tiny weed carried away by the wind, quickly vanishing from sight.

“I should go see her too.”

Li Mo thought to himself.

Should I go tomorrow?

He walked out of the alley.

Behind him, Liu Heng’s corpse, whose internal organs had been smashed into a pulp and lay like mud, silently caught fire and quickly turned into white ash.

He couldn’t withstand the hammer, so he never got to experience this destructive internal energy.

If he were still alive, he would probably feel it was a pity too.

...

Back at the hotpot restaurant, on the second floor.

【Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in ‘Luo Yao’ and saving her life.】

【Reward: Famous Artifact: Peach Blossom Branch of the Jade Sword.】

【Peach Blossom Branch of the Jade Sword】: “A powerful swordsman once observed a peach blossom forest and attained enlightenment. He casually broke off a branch to use as a sword, and it became a Famous Artifact.”

In his palm, a jade-colored branch appeared, blooming with three peach blossoms, as if it had just been plucked.

If internal energy were channeled into it, threads of sharpness would appear on its surface.

This peach blossom branch wasn’t forged by a blacksmith; it looked naturally formed. It was definitely a top-tier Famous Artifact.

“It’s quite suitable for Chulong.”

“I’ll give it to her when she’s about to break through to the Internal Energy Realm.”

Li Mo couldn’t help but curl his lips into a smile.

Putting away the Peach Blossom Branch of the Jade Sword, he took out another item from his chest.

It was a ferocious and terrifying bat statue, with a horrifying face and four wings.

It carried a certain kind of divine charm. If you stared at it for too long, you felt as if your consciousness was being sucked in.

In a daze, it felt as if this bat had come to life...

“This thing is extremely strange.”

Li Mo focused his mind and energy, finally breaking free from that state.

“This statue records the Fundamental Diagram of the Night Ghost.”

As soon as he finished speaking, a cold and clear voice came from the doorway.

---

Li Mo looked up.

Ah, it’s her. Black cloud gauze, resembling black silk.

As her legs moved slightly, they refracted flowing light.

Why are all my subjects silent?

His gaze moved upward, and he saw Ying Bing walking into the room wearing night clothes, which were made of the same material, fitting her figure closely...

‘Is it possible for a Great Artisan to make black cloud gauze into a fishing net shape, or even more styles...’

Li Mo calmly pinched his own thigh.

“Do you recognize this object?”

“Hmm, this is used to comprehend the Observing the Gods Realm.”

Ying Bing nodded slightly: “The so-called Observing the Gods is about observing objects, living beings, and even the divine charm of heaven and earth, to temper the spirit.”

“Over time, the spirit forms a connection with the external material, dissolving the Xuan Dan, and one can be considered to have entered the Observing the Gods Realm.”

“Once your spirit is strong enough, forming an inner heaven and earth, and you can project the scene in your heart onto the outside world, you will have achieved the Inner Scene Realm.”

The ice lump rarely spoke so much at once.

But the amount of information was immense, basically covering the specific methods from the Internal Energy Realm to the Observing the Gods Realm, and then to the Inner Scene Realm.

It sounded as if she had personally experienced it herself...

Li Mo couldn’t help but recall the illusory yet real Yin wind and ghost shadows that appeared when Liu Heng was practicing his technique.

He must have been observing this ‘Night Ghost Statue’ for a long time, and was progressing from the Internal Energy Xuan Dan Realm towards the Observing the Gods Realm.

If Li Mo hadn’t undergone Shang Wu’s special training, he probably would have had to use brute force to overwhelm the opponent to defeat him.

“You practice the Fire Heart Lotus Method. You can first learn the ‘Extreme Yang Fire Lotus Strength’ from her, and then have her draw a picture of the Southern Ming Fire Lotus for you...”

Ying Bing said, her delicate brows slightly furrowed.

Shang Wu didn’t seem like someone who could draw fundamental diagrams, let alone do any carving.

“Wouldn’t it be better to observe the real thing directly?”

Li Mo asked.

“Naturally.” Ying Bing nodded.

Whether it’s a statue or a painting, it can never perfectly reproduce the divine charm.

After pondering for a moment, Li Mo asked again, “What about observing the sun directly?”

The sun is hanging in the sky, so wouldn’t that mean you can observe it whenever you want?

And everyone in the world can observe it.

“It’s not enough to just have the object.”

“First, you need the corresponding martial art.”

“Second, you must be able to withstand it. Under the heavens, apart from the Great Yu Imperial Family, no one can observe the divine charm of the Great Sun. Otherwise, before the practice is complete, the soul would be extinguished.”

Ying Bing, in the Observing the Gods Realm, observed the Great Yin, which is the moon.

This was also because her physique was exceptional, allowing her to withstand the cleansing of the Great Yin’s power.

Li Mo looked up and glanced out the window.

What he was practicing now wasn’t the Extreme Yang Fire Lotus Strength.

When the time comes, as long as his safety is guaranteed, he really could try observing the Great Sun’s divine charm.

If that doesn’t work, he could observe the Pan Jie Meteor Hammer, and enter the Observing the Gods Realm through body refinement.

“I’m only at the Internal Energy Condensing Realm, there’s no rush for this matter.”

“Shall we go see Chulong together tomorrow?”

“Alright.”

After the conversation, the two fell into silence.

Li Mo sat on the bed.

Ying Bing remained silent, simply pursing her lips.

It was time for the much-anticipated dual cultivation session.

However, for Li Mo today, it was a test.

The ice lump didn’t change her clothes.

As is well known, in a cold state, male ball-shaped babies tend to become dispirited.

But it’s also well known that Little Li is immune to heat and cold, and he practices a Yang-type martial art, making him even less likely to feel cold.

This is tough.

...

Meanwhile.

A certain young girl, who was pretending to be a young hero running away from home, ran back to the government office in a disheveled state.

“Brother, I was bullied! I almost died! Wuuuuuuuu!”

Her voice was extremely loud.

“What?!”

“Who was that bastard?! I’ll chop him up and feed him to the dogs!”

“Trying to take advantage of the chaos? And targeting our Burning Jade Forest!”

The true disciples of the Burning Jade Forest were furious.
