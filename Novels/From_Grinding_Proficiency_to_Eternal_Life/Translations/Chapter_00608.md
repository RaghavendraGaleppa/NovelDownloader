# Chapter 608: The Swordsman's One Sword to Break Ten Thousand Methods

Spiritual energy surged from all directions, forcibly torn from the grass, trees, mountains, and stones, and drawn from the flowing earth veins. In an instant, a massive, swirling vortex of spiritual energy, so dense it seemed almost solid and shimmering with the color of jade, formed before Lu Chuan.

The vortex spun rapidly, exuding a crushing pressure, as if Lu Chuan held a continuously rotating gravitational core in his hand, drawing upon the world's primordial power.

This was the Xuanqing Edict Decree True Art. When cultivated to its perfection, it could command the world's essence to serve its user, following the path of a king. If Lu Chuan could complete the ritual and receive the corresponding Dao Fruit, it would become a true Law Word True Incantation, his very words containing the laws of heaven.

He intended to use this grand and righteous force to command the power of this world, crushing the dazzling, rapidly approaching sharpness from afar.

At the same moment Lu Chuan made his move, Zhang Qiaoluo acted as well.

She did not summon the grand momentum of the world like Lu Chuan, but instead suddenly became incredibly strange and dangerous.

The aura she had been suppressing around her body erupted with a bang. A profound, icy, soul-freezing darkness spread out, causing Sun Yue, who was standing nearby, to instinctively take half a step back.

Her slender, jade-like fingers rapidly formed seals as she chanted profound and esoteric incantations.

Drops of thick, black liquid, each weighing over a thousand pounds, seeped from her fingertips.

Sun Yue was startled. "Xuanming Heavy Water?"

Xuanming Heavy Water was not condensed from ordinary Gui Water power. It was refined from the extreme yin cold energy of the nine abysses. A single drop could pierce through mountains and rocks, and it contained a venomous power that could extinguish life force.

It was also a necessary condition for initiating the ritual of the Xuanpin化幽戮魂真经 to receive the Xuanpin Dao Fruit. Only by condensing Xuanming Heavy Water could one begin to draw upon the Dao Fruit.

At this thought, Sun Yue's mind shifted. Zhang Qiaoluo must be preparing for her ascension to a higher realm.

The next instant, as she completed her hand seal, she flicked her fingers, sending more than ten drops of Xuanming Heavy Water flying.

*Swish, swish, swish!*

These black droplets did not fly directly toward the source of the sword intent. Instead, they bizarrely hovered around her, spinning rapidly.

Each rotation sent out visible ripples of energy, like black waves.

Xu Yunfan could see it clearly. Even from the side, he could feel a chilling sensation run up his spine.

He couldn't help but suck in a cold breath of air. *How many people had this damn woman killed to cultivate such a神通?*

This was not water; it was a tangible, chilling, and venomous spiritual soul impact.

"The Xuanpin is profound, a sacrifice for the Soul Slaying!"

Zhang Qiaoluo's eyes turned into deep pools as she uttered the core of the incantation.

*Hum!*

The ten-plus drops of Xuanming Heavy Water violently collapsed inward, instantly condensing into a tiny point of darkness no larger than a walnut. It was pitch black on the outside but exuded a terrifying gravitational force.

The Xuanpin Soul Slaying Pearl.

As soon as the pearl was formed, a deadly killing intent specifically targeting the soul's origin expanded madly. It shot silently but swiftly toward the sharpness.

The formless Soul Slaying power of the Xuanpin化幽戮魂真经, perfectly fused with the extreme yin, heavy, and turbid physical destructive power of the Xuanming Heavy Water, was the ultimate killing move against the Primordial Spirit.

At the entrance of the valley, a figure finally appeared.

It was Ye Yuan.

His face was as cold as iron, his eyes like stars. His snow-white robes were unstained by dust, and his figure stood tall and straight like a solitary peak.

Faced with Lu Chuan's grand momentum, a vortex of Qingqi that seemed to crush space itself, and faced with Zhang Qiaoluo's Xuanpin Soul Slaying Pearl, which condensed the essence of Xuanming Heavy Water and was enough to freeze and annihilate a soul, his handsome face showed not a single ripple. Not even his eyes changed in the slightest.

He simply made the simplest of movements, one taught in the most basic sword manuals.

He raised his hand and thrust.

His sword was just a seemingly plain, unadorned iron sword.

But the moment Ye Yuan raised his hand, this iron sword instantly came to life.

He spoke four words clearly, like a proclamation from the heavens.

"Yaoguang, Split the Sea."

*Clang!*

A clear and piercing sword cry, as if capable of piercing one's eardrums, rang out, like the simultaneous vibration of a billion pieces of metal.

A tyrannical, magnificent, and fearless sword intent erupted from Ye Yuan's body, capable of severing all tangible and intangible things in the world.

Its momentum was brilliant and awe-inspiring, enough to make all evil spirits keep their distance and all methods bow their heads.

Xu Yunfan's expression changed instantly.

Ye Yuan had comprehended a fierce and unyielding sword intent. Though different from the Ancestor of Pure Yang's 'No-Return' sword intent, it was also extremely fierce, a path of sacrificing oneself for righteousness.

The moment he unleashed his sword, a vast and boundless sword path phenomenon faintly appeared in the void behind him.

Seven colossal sword souls, each with a different form, hung high in the center of the sky, like the Big Dipper spanning the heavens. In particular, the star representing the 'Yaoguang' position now shone with a thousand rays of light, as if the power of the entire star river was being poured into the iron sword in Ye Yuan's hand.

This was the highest manifestation of the sword path he cultivated, the *Tianji Xuan Shu Jian Po Tong Xuan Zhen Jing*.

Sword Soul Tong Xuan, drawing upon the power of the stars for one's own use.

Lu Chuan's vortex of Qingqi, which had drawn upon a hundred zhang of spiritual energy and was enough to leave a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator helpless, was actually completely suppressed by Ye Yuan's simple thrust of 'Yaoguang Split the Sea'.

The formless sword intent arrived later but struck first, precisely piercing the core operational node of the massive spiritual energy vortex, a node formed from countless laws and principles.

*Puff!*

It was like a soap bubble being popped.

The heavy, mountain-like vortex of spiritual energy struggled and twisted violently, then let out a groan as if unable to bear the strain. The laws and decrees of the world that formed the foundation of its immense power were severed and dissolved at their very root by this 'Yaoguang Split the Sea' sword qi.

The spiritual energy, which had been forcibly gathered, lost the constraint of the decree and instantly went out of control. It exploded violently, transforming into countless chaotic energy currents that surged and blasted in front of Lu Chuan.

Lu Chuan hadn't even had time to react before he was struck as if by a heavy hammer. He grunted, a trickle of crimson blood overflowing from the corner of his mouth. His body was involuntarily sent flying backward by the powerful backlash, crashing heavily into the middle of a mountain, with cracks spreading out in all directions.

The *Xuanqing Shenxiao Edict True Art*, which he had been so proud of and which could command Qingqi, had had its very foundation broken by a single sword.

At the same time, Zhang Qiaoluo's silent, soul-devouring Xuanpin Soul Slaying Pearl also shot to a spot just a foot in front of Ye Yuan.

The terrifying coldness that could freeze a soul and the soul-slaying power that could tear a soul apart had already enveloped Ye Yuan's entire body.

However, the formless 'Yaoguang Split the Sea' sword qi did not stop. It trembled slightly as if it possessed its own life, and a will to split rivers and sever seas erupted once more.

*Sss!*

That black pearl, which had condensed the Xuanming Heavy Water and the soul-slaying power, was perfectly sliced in two by an almost invisible, distorted line of light, as if it were the most fragile glass.

The two halves of the Soul Slaying Pearl did not explode. The fierce and unyielding sword qi instantly dissipated all of its cold, heavy, and even venomous aura.

The two halves of black material silently disintegrated and dissipated, transforming into wisps of green smoke that vanished without a trace.
