# Chapter 4: The Minor Cycle of Life and Death Needles  

Half an hour later, Wang Chan descended from Lotus Mountain and walked about half a mile toward Small Tea Mountain before stopping at a bend in the path to survey his surroundings.  

The spot was quite secluded—perfect for any unsavory activities without fear of discovery.  

He channeled a surge of mana, spreading it across his body to form a faint cyan protective barrier. This shield could ward off wind and rain, as well as block noxious fumes, offering a degree of defense.  

Suddenly, he understood why the voluptuous female cultivator from Cave No. 48, despite her long-standing side business and numerous male visitors, had never sought medical help. She must have had ample experience with protective mana barriers.  

But a barrier alone wasn’t enough. Inside his left sleeve, a protective talisman with ten layers of inscribed restrictions lay snug against the fabric. A thread of mana coiled around it, ready to activate at the first sign of danger.  

With both the mana barrier and the talisman as dual defenses, Wang Chan was confident that even if caught off guard by an attack—unless it came from a mid-tier demonic beast or ghost—he could at least block it long enough to react.  

Additionally, he had retrieved nine Minor Cycle of Life and Death Needles from their case. He held two in each hand, with the remaining five hidden in his sleeves for emergencies.  

No one knew he possessed nine needles—outsiders only knew of three.  

Nor did anyone know their true name. Since he had always used their Wood Essence Qi to restore vitality and yang energy, his previous incarnation had referred to them publicly as "Revitalizing Needles."  

Truth be told, his former self had been a crafty—no, a cautious—individual, meticulous in his dealings. It was a pity his poor cultivation talent hadn’t led to his death at the jaws of a demonic beast but rather to a fatal qi deviation.  

In reality, when these needles were used offensively with their Grave Yin Qi, they were formidable—swift as a shadow and capable of piercing defenses.  

Moreover, if the needles' power remained latent after striking a target, they could seal the victim’s mana channels, immobilizing them instantly.  

With all nine needles combined, even a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator could be subdued if caught unaware—provided they could be struck in the first place.  

These needles had been indispensable to his former self, allowing him to survive years of medical practice in the wilderness.  

Over the past few days, Wang Chan had taken every opportunity to practice with the needles, mastering their use and even discovering new tricks.  

Though traveling during the day in Lotus Mountain territory wasn’t particularly dangerous—most demonic beasts and ghosts lurked in hiding, reserving their hunts for nighttime—it was still wise to remain cautious in the wild.  

Before leaving, Wang Chan had even upgraded the needles' restrictions to thirteen layers, significantly boosting their power. They now felt sturdier in his grasp.  

"Ha!"  

With preparations complete, Wang Chan exhaled sharply, channeling mana into his legs. His body shot forward like a galloping horse, the scenery on either side of the mountain path blurring into streaks behind him.  

Soon, half the journey had passed in the time it took to drink a cup of tea, yet his breathing remained steady.  

If he’d had such stamina in his past life, he wouldn’t have needed to rely on his wits—he could’ve lived off his looks. A single livestream would’ve had his mature female fans fighting for the top spot in his rankings.  

As he admired the landscape and felt the wind rush past his ears, Wang Chan took a deep breath and accelerated further, merging seamlessly with the breeze.  

A real man should be as swift as the wind.  

Just as he was reveling in the sensation, an unexpected sight appeared—a white cloud drifting over the forest ahead, accompanied by a commanding voice:  

"Halt, fellow Daoist below! Patrol inspection!"  

Before the words faded, the cloud descended and solidified into a barrier a dozen paces ahead.  

Thud! Thud!  

Wang Chan skidded to a stop, his feet digging into the ground. Before he could catch his breath, five cultivators in white, standardized soft armor emerged from the cloud, sending a jolt of panic through him.  

Ignoring the turbulence in his mana, he nearly flung his needles on instinct but managed to restrain himself just in time.  

Next, he raised his hands and clasped them behind his head, his knees buckling as if to crouch—only to abruptly realize his mistake.  

This was a world of immortal cultivation. He was a cultivator, not some criminal. What was there to fear?  

Straightening his back, he lowered his hands calmly and waited for the patrol to approach.  

From memory, inspections by wilderness patrols were common. His former self, as a traveling physician, had been checked many times and knew the drill.  

As long as he cooperated, they wouldn’t hassle a minor rogue cultivator like him.  

The patrol consisted of five members, led by a dignified, clear-eyed woman with a tall frame, a perfectly placed beauty mark, and her hair styled in a married woman’s bun.  

Wang Chan felt a pang of envy for her Dao companion.  

Yet he dared not look too long. Though only at the mid-stage of Qi Refining, her aura was formidable—likely possessing over sixty strands of mana, not far from the late stage.  

The other four patrol members—two men and two women—were also mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators. Though less impressive than their leader, their fierce demeanors spoke of considerable skill.  

Patrol duty in White Mountain City wasn’t for just anyone. Without ability or connections, entry was impossible.  

"Greetings, honored patrol," Wang Chan said with a cupped fist salute as they approached.  

The group ignored his courtesy. A square-jawed male cultivator stepped forward, summoning an ancient bronze mirror.  

"Inspection," he said flatly.  

"Proceed," Wang Chan replied, dispelling his mana barrier.  

The man channeled mana into the mirror, which emitted a pale golden light that swept over Wang Chan’s body before dissipating into motes of spiritual energy.  

Wang Chan tensed under the mirror’s oppressive aura. As a mere early-stage Qi Refining rogue cultivator, why was a mid-grade artifact necessary for a routine check?  

"Clear."  

Seeing no anomalies, the man stowed the mirror and gestured for Wang Chan to leave before returning to report.  

Relieved, Wang Chan turned to slip past—only to freeze at a sharp command:  

"Stop!"  

It came from the beauty-marked woman.  

Wang Chan halted, lowering his head slightly with a frown. What could they possibly find suspicious about him?  

"Brother Feng, look again," she ordered sternly.  

"...Understood, Captain," the square-jawed man replied, stepping closer. His eyes glowed green as he scrutinized Wang Chan from head to toe.  

After a moment, he turned back. "Captain, nothing stands out."  

The woman paused, then approached herself, bringing a pleasant fragrance. Her gaze remained fixed on Wang Chan as she addressed her subordinate:  

"Look at his brow and eyes."  

The man studied him again before declaring, "Strong and defined!"  

"His features?"  

"Handsome!"  

"His build?"  

"Tall and lean!"  

"His aura?"  

"Graceful in green—quite pleasing!"  

Wang Chan had braced for some damning revelation, but this...  

Unsure whether to laugh or cry, he kept his expression neutral, though the weight in his chest lightened.  

"Doesn’t he resemble the demonic cultivator Li Yuan?" the woman snapped.  

The man’s eyes widened. "Now that you mention it, there is a two- or three-tenths resemblance in demeanor. Though Li Yuan usually looks gloomy, if he suppressed it, he might appear this agreeable. Captain, that scoundrel excels at concealment—the Minor Evil-Detecting Mirror might not catch him. Better to err on the side of caution. Let’s take him in for a thorough—"  

Demonic cultivator?!  

Wang Chan felt as though he’d been plunged into an icy abyss.
