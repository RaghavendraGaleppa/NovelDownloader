# Chapter 66: Sweet-Flavored Foundation Establishment Pill

The premium synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill had a success rate seven times higher than its inferior counterparts. It could be taken orally without any special preparation and was currently priced at thirty thousand yellow-grade spirit stones per pill.

There was no issue with the pill's quality. If one were to independently procure such a pill, it would cost between fifty to seventy thousand spirit stones. Thus, many cultivators without the means or those who didn't mind others knowing about their impending breakthrough would come to the auction house to secure one.

Of course, there were also those who had no shortage of funds and were in a hurry to establish their foundation.

Purchasing Foundation Establishment Pills at auctions wasn't always cost-effective—in fact, most of the time it wasn't. This was because those eager to break through and with considerable financial resources acted like spoilers, constantly driving up the auction prices.

The newly appointed host donned white silk gloves and carefully accepted a delicate small box from an assistant, placing it gently on the podium.

When the box was opened, a glossy black pill inside caught the attention of the surrounding crowd, eliciting gasps of admiration.

"Wow~"

"Oh~"

"Whoa~"

Even those who had already established their foundations couldn't help but exclaim, deeply influenced by the atmosphere.

The synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill was now on display, though who would ultimately win it remained unknown.

"It looks just like a century egg," Xiao Ji remarked, somewhat disappointed by the pill's appearance.

"Mm, a very expensive century egg," Qian Duoyu chimed in beside him.

The audience murmured among themselves.

This auction session was specifically for Qi Refinement cultivators, so most attendees were at that stage. Few Foundation Establishment cultivators were present, and those who were had likely come to bid for their disciples or children.

The auction house in Taigu City hosted various themed sessions daily, and today's was the Qi Refinement special.

"This synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill was refined by the alchemy master Wumingzi. As you can see from its appearance, its color is richer, and its aura purer," the host said mysteriously. "Beyond its foundational effects, the master has incorporated some personal preferences—for instance, this pill has a sweet flavor..."

The introduction was compelling.

The cultivators were already itching to bid for this premium pill.

However, it also sparked a minor controversy.

"Why isn't it salty? Shouldn't Foundation Establishment Pills be salty?" someone complained.

"Could Master Wumingzi be from the north?"

"Sweet-flavored Foundation Establishment Pills are fine."

"It's hard to imagine swallowing a sweet Foundation Establishment Pill."

The scene grew somewhat chaotic.

The host had no choice but to rap the podium.

"Esteemed fellow cultivators, let's not lose sight of the main point. The key reason for purchasing a Foundation Establishment Pill is to achieve a breakthrough—as long as it's effective, that's what matters. For those who dislike sweetness, you can always dip it in soy sauce when consuming it!"

Now that was professionalism.

This host was truly adept—resolving the sweet-versus-salty debate with a single sentence.

"He makes a good point."

"I've realized—the flavor of an object isn't inherent. It's in our hands. We can make it sweet or salty as we please... Hahaha..."

A spiritual light flashed as a cultivator's crown emitted a radiant halo.

Someone had attained enlightenment on the spot.

"Get a couple of people to carry him out and find a physician to check on him," the host instructed upon seeing the enlightened cultivator collapse—whether from epiphany or mental overload was unclear.

This auction was destined to be extraordinary.

The bidding for the synthesized Foundation Establishment Pill resumed.

"Such a premium Foundation Establishment Pill—starting bid, one spirit stone. Let the bidding begin!"

With the host's enthusiastic announcement, the room erupted.

A starting bid of one spirit stone was indeed an attractive hook.

The auction house dealt primarily in yellow-grade spirit stones, so all bids were in that denomination.

Of course, Xiao Ji knew the starting price didn't reflect the final bid.

Even disregarding other interested cultivators, the price couldn't possibly stay low with Taigu City's professional bidders scattered throughout the venue.

Though the item didn't belong to Taigu City, they stood to profit from commissions. Thus, from their perspective, the higher the price, the better—preferably with enough bidders to spark a bidding war.

"I bid one hundred." A cultivator in the middle raised his placard.

"Excellent! We have an offer of one hundred spirit stones. Any other bids? No? Very well—one hundred, going once!" The host struck the podium with his gavel, producing a crisp sound.

"Three hundred," another voice called.

"Five hundred," someone countered.

"One thousand."

"Three thousand."

"Five thousand."

The price of the Foundation Establishment Pill skyrocketed.

Still, it remained within the market's expected range.

Xiao Ji didn't rush to bid. With only a little over ten thousand spirit stones, jumping in recklessly wasn't wise.

Moreover, most current bidders knew they wouldn't win—they simply wanted to impress the fairies accompanying them by flaunting their wealth.

Serious bidders would wait until others had exhausted themselves before making their move.

Xiao Ji needed to gather more information about his competitors.

Naturally, he had a backup plan. If his ten-thousand-spirit-stone strategy failed, he could always turn to Plan B.

He glanced at Qian Duoyu beside him. "If I borrowed some spirit stones from him, he wouldn't refuse—he might even be delighted."

A true friend, worth keeping.

"Current bid stands at six thousand three hundred spirit stones. Any higher offers? Going once... Going twice..." The host struck the podium twice, heightening the tension.

One more strike, and the pill would be sold.

[He won't strike a third time.]

Xiao Ji waited calmly until the host's awkward pause dragged on before speaking. "Six thousand five hundred."

The crowd turned to look.

Bids had been coming from the front rows, so a voice from the back was surprising.

Conventional wisdom held that the wealthy always sat up front.

The auction house also required bidders to register in advance, with seating arranged based on status—though casual attendees could still participate.

The cultivator who had bid six thousand three hundred frowned and turned to see a plainly dressed Daoist.

He was displeased.

This was a serious bidder—a cultivator in yellow robes with narrow eyes, flanked by similarly dressed companions, clearly from the same sect.

"Six thousand six," the narrow-eyed cultivator said coldly, staring at Xiao Ji.

"Six thousand seven," Xiao Ji replied steadily.

"Seven thousand," the other snapped back.

"Seven thousand one," Xiao Ji countered methodically.
