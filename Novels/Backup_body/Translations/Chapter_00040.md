# Chapter 40: The Crown Prince's Death! Hunting the Gu King!

This black cicada was undoubtedly a gu insect!

Li Zhengjing recognized it—this was the very gu insect that had nearly claimed his life half a year ago!

Back then, while walking through the capital, he had been stung by this black cicada. The gu poison invaded his body instantly, bringing him to death's door. The physician summoned at the time had advised the Jian'an Marquis household to prepare for his funeral. The Marquis and his wife, along with his elder brother Li Pu, were overcome with grief—especially his mother, Lady Jia, who wept uncontrollably.

Had it not been for the golden page absorbing the gu poison, he would have long perished!

"The crimson blood streaks on its carapace and the missing left leg—it's identical," Li Zhengjing thought to himself. "This is no coincidence. It's the same gu insect!"

He stared at the counterfeit medicine peddler with a grave expression. Seeing the anger in Li Zhengjing's eyes, the peddler didn't hide anything and explained immediately.

This gu insect had been obtained from an inner disciple of the Beast Taming Hall.

"He just returned from the capital," the peddler whispered. "Elder Gu led a group of disciples to the capital for training, but they encountered a gu master from the Southern Wastelands. Elder Gu was poisoned, and more than half of the disciples were killed or injured. By the way, that senior brother who was supposed to draw the Divine Movement Talismans for us also died from the gu poison..."

"The capital?" Li Zhengjing's expression darkened.

"This senior brother from the Beast Taming Hall was one of the four disciples who escorted the bodies back to the mountain," the peddler continued. "He captured this gu insect in the capital. Since it was a product of unorthodox methods, he couldn't report it to the Hall of Merit to exchange for contributions, so he sold it privately."

"Moreover, according to unreliable rumors, the Crown Prince of the Eastern Palace was poisoned and bedridden half a year ago—also the work of this gu master..."

"This time, the sect sent people to the capital because the Crown Prince was poisoned again..." The peddler lowered his voice. "He's on the brink of death now. The future of the Great Zhou Dynasty might be about to change..."

"What?" Li Zhengjing's expression shifted. "The Crown Prince was poisoned half a year ago?"

The peddler nodded. "He barely survived back then, but this time, there's no saving him."

Li Zhengjing's thoughts raced.

Half a year ago, he had been poisoned by a gu insect, and the Crown Prince had suffered the same fate?

After he miraculously recovered overnight, his father had immediately sent him away from the capital. Had his father sensed something ominous?

As his mind swirled with countless thoughts, the peddler spoke again.

"According to the latest news last night, that gu master was severely injured by Elder Gu but managed to escape the capital, heading east."

"The Great Zhou government has issued a bounty for his capture, offering a heavy reward. Cultivators from all sides are now hunting him down."

"Based on current reports, I believe he's likely trapped somewhere near the Xuanling Prefecture."

"The Xuanling Prefecture borders the territory under the jurisdiction of our Feather Transformation Immortal Sect. I doubt the sect will stand idly by."

The peddler whispered, "After all, the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is a sacred land within the Great Zhou. Since this matter involves the nation's heir apparent, our sect will surely assist the imperial court in capturing this criminal!"

Li Zhengjing paid 1,800 taels of silver for the gu insect.

After the peddler left, he stared at the insect and thought to himself, "That one-armed barbarian who nearly killed me has caused such a huge uproar?"

He had long known that this gu master was no ordinary figure and that he must have had accomplices sheltering him in the capital—otherwise, the Jian'an Marquis household wouldn't have failed to find him.

But he hadn't expected this man to have poisoned the Crown Prince half a year ago and remained hidden in the capital all this time without being caught!

Even an inner sect elder of the Immortal Sect, a True Qi realm expert, had been severely injured by his gu poison. This gu master was no ordinary foe!

"The Great Zhou Dynasty has gathered experts from across the land, and even the military boasts True Qi realm powerhouses. Yet in the end, they had to request the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect to send an elder to subdue him!"

"This gu master's background must involve far-reaching connections!"

"Still, this man nearly took my life... If I get the chance, I'll make sure he tastes my Blazing Fire Divine Sword!"

As Li Zhengjing pondered this, a delighted voice suddenly reached his ears.

"Master, how did you know I'd love this treat?"

The wall-clinging bird snatched the gu insect with its beak, overjoyed.

For days, the master had only nurtured that foolish tree, leaving the bird resentful. Now, it seemed the master still valued it—it had just taken some time to procure such a precious gu insect.

With this thought, it tilted its head back, opened its beak, and prepared to swallow the insect.

Then it was kicked—sent flying into the wall before sliding down slowly.

"Who said you could eat that?" The Five Elements Creation Tree extended a newly sprouted branch, waving it as it spoke. "Taking without asking is theft! My household has taken you in, and you should be grateful! How dare you eat our things without permission?"

"Since when is this your household?" The wall-clinging bird flared up in anger, pecking seven or eight holes into the tree trunk.

"Ah—Master! It pierced me!" the Five Elements Creation Tree wailed.

"Silence!"

Li Zhengjing stared at the gu insect, his expression complicated.

Within the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect, there were no unorthodox methods for refining gu insects—or at least none he had access to.

The counterfeit medicine peddler had always assumed Li Zhengjing bought the medicine cauldron to raise poisonous insects, believing he possessed the skills to refine gu insects.

But in truth, Li Zhengjing knew nothing about refining or using gu insects.

Yet none of that mattered to him!

He pressed his finger against the black cicada.

The insect resisted instantly, its legs piercing deep into his finger like needles.

"Master!" 

Both the wall-clinging bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree cried out in alarm, thinking the same thing: "Why would the master, with such a bright future ahead, suddenly decide to end his life?"

But the next moment, Li Zhengjing tossed the gu insect into the medicine cauldron, his expression unchanged.

He thought to himself, "The gu poison enters my body and is absorbed by the golden page as spiritual energy—equivalent to about two low-grade spirit stones."

Though this gu poison wasn't as potent as the gu eggs from Pei Ying's banquet, its advantage was its ability to regenerate.

Now that the gu insect had released its poison, it lay weak and exhausted. But its poison would gradually replenish—as long as it lived, it would accumulate toxicity again, becoming fully potent in a few days.

To Li Zhengjing, this gu insect was nothing short of a "spirit stone generator"!

"It can't kill me," Li Zhengjing said to the bird and the tree. "Take good care of it and feed it properly. Don't let it starve! Especially you, green-horned bird—if you dare eat it again, I'll roast you alive!"

With that, Li Zhengjing returned to his room.

The wall-clinging bird's eyes flickered with suspicion.

"Why does the master keep the gu insect if he's not refining it?" it wondered aloud. "Is the poison not strong enough yet? Is he waiting to gather enough to kill himself in one go?"

"Then why would the master want to die?" the Five Elements Creation Tree asked. "Could it be that, like you, he has a female bird he can't woo, who's already laid seven nests of eggs?"

"The sages say, 'A scholar would rather die than suffer humiliation!'" the wall-clinging bird roared. "You dare insult me! I challenge you to a duel to the death!"

"Tree Lord will fight you to the end!" 

The Five Elements Creation Tree extended hundreds of roots, engaging in fierce battle.

Three breaths later, the tree conceded defeat and begged for mercy.

Meanwhile, in his room, Li Zhengjing removed his long saber and prepared to change clothes.

Just then, a bell tolled, resonating throughout the entire sect!

This wasn't the bell of the Ancient Moon Peak—it was the bell of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect's main hall!

"A matter concerning the entire sect?"

Li Zhengjing looked up, astonished.
