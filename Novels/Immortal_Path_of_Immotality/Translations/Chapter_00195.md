# Chapter 193: Moonview Immortal City

Five days later, Lin Shan leisurely floated through the sky atop his Descending Cloud Banner.

After escaping the Demon Sect's headquarters that day, he had been traveling nonstop westward. Now, he had finally reached the territory of the Confucian School in the Lu Kingdom.

The most dangerous place was also the safest. As long as he reached here, no one could prove he was from the Demon Sect. After all, he didn't practice demonic techniques, and having just arrived from the southern Song Kingdom, few people knew him.

As for figures like Immortal Huang, Lin Shan didn't need to worry about them—nor did he have the capability to do so. The Confucian School's opponents were the Nascent Soul cultivators of the Demon Sect. Immortal Huang had merely stumbled into the situation by accident and should have no trouble withdrawing, taking along Protector Yan, Luan Chun, and others before leaving.

Moreover, the three major Demon Sects had eight or nine Nascent Soul cultivators. Even if their sects were annihilated, a few would surely escape.

As for the followers who had accompanied him all the way from the Eastern Sea, the summoning contracts in his soul were still active, indicating most of them were alive—likely staying with Immortal Huang and Protector Yan. They were undoubtedly safer with them than with him.

Thus, Lin Shan had no immediate plans to summon them.

Another pressing concern was the Black Lotus Sect's plan to resurrect the Green Lotus Fairy.

Judging by the name, she seemed connected to the "World-Honored One's Phantom" summoned by the sect's Dharma King using vast amounts of faith power. It was unclear who this mighty figure was, but even in death, she had laid plans for her resurrection.

The title "Fairy" was common in the cultivation world—any female cultivator, regardless of whether she was at the Nascent Soul, Golden Core, Foundation Establishment, or Qi Refinement stage, could be addressed as such.

But the Enhancement Panel wasn't so casual. Since it clearly referred to her as a "Fairy," there was a high probability she truly was one!

An immortal—how distant and magnificent a realm.

Refining the Void to unite with the Dao, transcending the physical to ascend, the mind free from birth and death, breath without ingress or egress. The heavy, turbid form transforms into light, pure qi, a body of pure yang, capable of infinite divine transformations.

At that stage, the body becomes pure yang, the yang spirit fully formed, possessing the power of limitless divine transformations.

The last time Lin Shan had heard of such beings was in the mirage over the Zangdu Great Canyon—figures referred to by the Black Skeleton Demon Lord as celestial immortals, commanding armies of millions, capable of annihilating starships millions of miles away in the void with a flick of their fingers.

And then there was his first encounter, when he had casually wandered into an ancient temple in the wilderness and stolen the Buddha's bowl. A single glance from that immortal had pierced through countless realms, its might vast and unfathomable, shaking the cosmos.

And here he was, merely at the Foundation Establishment stage, already having indirectly provoked the Buddha of the Immortal Realm and the Green Lotus Fairy. Who knew what other trouble he might stir up in the future?

Especially after having just stolen one-tenth of the faith power—he could only hope the Black Lotus Sect's Nascent Soul Dharma Kings wouldn't come after him. Fortunately, he had used the names of Mountain Lord Bear and Pure Lotus Hermit back then, so he could shift the blame onto them when the time came, sharing the burden.

With that thought, he felt slightly relieved.

Currently, he had a total of 170 points of Ancient Charm, enough to significantly improve his cultivation. Breaking through to the Golden Core stage as soon as possible would elevate him to the upper echelons of the cultivation world, making travel and movement far more convenient.

However, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord was now bound by a new contract and had reached late Foundation Establishment. Perhaps he could loosen its restrictions slightly, allowing it to recover to the Golden Core stage and serve as his protector.

Lin Shan stroked his chin, deep in thought, as the Descending Cloud Banner carried him steadily onward.

---

Half a month later, after asking around, Lin Shan arrived at an immortal city.

Moonview City.

The Lu Kingdom's cultivation world differed greatly from the Song Kingdom's. Though resource monopolies existed here as well, it was far more prosperous.

Here, Confucianism was revered, led by the two great Confucian families of Kong and Meng, supported by the Ten Great Confucian Academies, beneath which were various sects and cultivation clans.

Mortal cultivators here could enter Confucian academies to study as long as they could afford spirit stones, learning basic techniques and spells. Dedicated instructors would teach them cultivation experience, including the six arts of cultivation—alchemy, artifact forging, talisman-making, and more.

After graduation, they would enter various professions within the cultivation world, supplying the Lu Kingdom with a steady stream of talent.

If a mortal cultivator displayed exceptional talent or insight, they might even be recruited as direct disciples by an academy, equivalent to joining a major faction—ensuring no prodigy went unnoticed.

Some cultivation clans had deep collaborations with certain academies, sending their younger members to study under renowned masters before returning to serve their families.

Others, ambitious and eager to make their mark, would leave the academies after completing their studies, seeking opportunities in the immortal cities.

Thanks to this open system, the Lu Kingdom's cultivation world nurtured vast numbers of cultivators. Coupled with its proximity to neighboring nations and abundant trade, it presented a scene of flourishing prosperity.

Moreover, situated at a crossroads of cultures, the kingdom's industries thrived, producing innovations that seemed novel and even unbelievable.

The immortal cities here were akin to the Song Kingdom's marketplaces but several times larger, with populations numbering in the tens of thousands year-round—and all conflicts were strictly prohibited.

Upon arriving at Moonview City, Lin Shan found that even the gatekeepers were Foundation Establishment cultivators. Entry cost ten spirit stones, registration another ten, and the identity badge required yet another ten.

"Processing fees? Why does every document come with a charge?" 

Grumbling inwardly, he followed the crowd into the city.

The streets were broad and immaculate, lined with tidy shops. The passing cultivators all seemed vibrant and energetic, and ahead, a bustling marketplace thrummed with activity.

No sooner had Lin Shan stepped into the marketplace than he was surrounded by several cultivators.

"Esteemed Daoist, I am an executive from the Cultivation World Building Materials Market. Here's my card."

"Daoist, I'm a sales representative for Trendy Robes of the Dao. My card."

"Brother, I'm a spirit field leasing agent. Here's my card."

"Young master, I'm a promotional specialist for the Pleasure Pavilion. My card."

...

Lin Shan collected a stack of cards before finally shaking them off. Flipping through them, he found simple introductions—mostly advertisements for short-term work.

The last few cards stood out, featuring suggestive illustrations with addresses and contact information.

Glancing around cautiously, Lin Shan tossed the rest but kept those.

Further down the street, he encountered another marketplace, even livelier than the last. Rows of tables were set up, with cultivators sitting stiffly as others approached with papers in hand—resembling job interviews.

The Lu Kingdom's cultivation world was truly unique, its customs markedly different from the Song Kingdom's. It seemed to operate on a more innovative system, allowing mortal cultivators to leverage their skills and settle in the immortal cities.

Curious, Lin Shan eavesdropped as a young cultivator with a faint mustache sat before a middle-aged interviewer, nervously presenting his resume.

"Honored interviewer, I am Ma Wentong, graduate of the Hongshan Academy of True Knowledge. I placed in the third tier of the academy's artifact-forging competition and have designed two major inventions: the Sect-Guarding Satellite and the Demonic Energy Flying Ship."

The crowd gasped in astonishment. Lin Shan, too, was amazed—who would have thought an ordinary academy student here could possess such talent?

The interviewer frowned slightly, studying the resume before remarking thoughtfully, "The Hongshan Academy is a standard institution, and your competition wasn't a kingdom-wide event, so the prestige is limited. Your inventions also seem impractical—more theoretical than functional. Their feasibility remains questionable."

Ma Wentong grew flustered. "My professors unanimously praised my work! With sufficient funding for development, they could revolutionize the cultivation world, ushering in a new era of progress!"

The interviewer remained unconvinced, stroking his beard. "Sects already have protective formations—what use is a satellite except as a target? And flying ships operate stably on spirit stones. Why switch to volatile demonic energy?"

Ma Wentong eagerly elaborated: "Protective formations are too rigid, vulnerable to sabotage. During the recent war, didn't the Demon Sect's headquarters' formation get altered by our Confucian alliance, trapping them inside?

"With satellites, we could detect intrusions early, preventing sabotage. They could also complement formations—I have detailed plans for a satellite network and cost projections.

"As for flying ships, spirit stones are always in short supply. Why not adopt demonic energy as an alternative? After the war, we've captured countless demonic cultivators—put them to work generating demonic energy. Two birds with one stone!"

As Ma Wentong spoke passionately, the crowd nodded approvingly, impressed by his vision.

Lin Shan was dumbfounded.

Who would have thought a mere academy graduate here could possess such insight? The world was vast and full of wonders. Had he not left the Song Kingdom, he would have remained a frog at the bottom of a well.

He couldn't help but reflect—he needed to broaden his perspective, to break free from the Song Kingdom's outdated systems.

The path of immortality would inevitably progress over time—how could it remain stagnant?

With cultural exchange and development, artifacts and treasures would evolve. Those clinging stubbornly to the past would be left behind!

The interviewer pondered Ma Wentong's explanation. While the young man's imagination was commendable, his inventions still had too many limitations. The merchant guild's leaders were unlikely to invest—the trial-and-error costs were too high.

Thus, Ma Wentong failed the interview and left to seek another opportunity.

The watching students grew anxious about their own prospects.

Next, another graduate stepped forward—a scholarly-looking youth exuding refinement.

"I am Meng Chuanjun, of the Meng family's collateral line. Skilled in networking, I have connections across major sects and cultivation clans, capable of coordinating trade and expanding business channels..."

This Meng Chuanjun, though from a prestigious family, belonged to a lesser branch and sought to forge his own path, leveraging his connections to secure resources.

"Congratulations! Welcome to our guild."

Without hesitation, the interviewer shook Meng Chuanjun's hand, accepting him immediately.

No further questions were asked—the contrast was stark.

Such was the power of background.

In any world, in any era, it served as an invaluable stepping stone.

With it, one's starting point was inherently higher.

Even without exceptional talent or mastery of the six arts, familial influence and social connections opened doors unavailable to others.

The interviewer's reasoning was simple: Meng Chuanjun's extensive network could help the guild establish new trade routes and gather insider information, making him an ideal liaison.

Merchant guilds in the cultivation world sought profit above all.

As more students took their turns, Lin Shan observed interview after interview, realizing he couldn't possibly integrate into this system.

He had never attended an academy—he was entirely self-taught.

His earlier claim of studying at the "Ten Thousand Willows Academy" had barely fooled Dai Budong and Zhu Duiyou, let alone seasoned interviewers.

The Lu Kingdom's top ten academies were prestigious institutions, some housing Nascent Soul elders, others led by Golden Core experts—each a golden ticket in the cultivation world.

Without an academy's endorsement, Lin Shan couldn't even pass the initial screening for reputable guilds or businesses. He'd never get a chance to showcase his abilities.

Cultivators like him—without "credentials"—were relegated to menial labor in immortal cities.

But then again, did it matter?

He wasn't short on spirit stones.

Work for others? Never.

Between the 200,000 spirit stones from the Turtle Hermit (of which over 100,000 remained) and the 150,000 extorted from the Gongsun family using his Demon Sect envoy identity, plus the accumulated wealth from fallen foes, he now possessed over 300,000 spirit stones!

He could live comfortably in Moonview City for a lifetime without exhausting that fortune.

"For now, I should rent a cave abode and focus on cultivation."

Strolling through the bustling streets, surrounded by cultivators, Lin Shan felt a rare sense of peace.

"Back in the Song Kingdom, as a mortal cultivator, I lived in constant fear. Later, joining the Demon Sect brought the pressure of conversion quotas. The war between righteousness and demonic factions was chaos—only my wits kept me alive.

"After escaping to the Lu Kingdom, I thought I'd found stability at the Black Lotus Sect, with Immortal Huang as my patron, drowning in resources and Ancient Charm.

"Yet while I gained plenty of Ancient Charm, the sect collapsed, and my backers vanished, leaving me a mortal cultivator once more.

"Truly, fate is fickle and unpredictable..."

As he walked, Lin Shan reflected on his next steps.

"First, I'll use the spiritual liquid from the leyline surge to reach the peak of mid-Foundation Establishment. Then, I'll undergo prolonged stellar energy tempering and Illusory Spirit Liquid refinement—strengthening myself on all fronts!

"As for the breakthrough pill to late Foundation Establishment, I'll need to find one."

Without the Black Lotus Sect's resources, obtaining a rare pill like the "Purple Heart Pill" would be challenging.

Though the Lu Kingdom was relatively open, monopolies still existed. Foundation Establishment pills were highly sought after—when they appeared on the market, local factions snapped them up instantly, leaving outsiders like him empty-handed.

Without pills, his progress would slow. Failed breakthroughs could even regress his cultivation, leaving behind "Dao Scars"—accumulated flaws that increased the difficulty of future breakthroughs.

The more Dao Scars one had, the harder advancement became, until further progress became impossible. Many aged experts stagnated precisely because of this.

Thus, in early stages like Foundation Establishment, it was best to break through cleanly in one attempt, avoiding repeated failures that would complicate future cultivation.

Lin Shan had heard such advice many times, which was why he always spent Ancient Charm to guarantee success rather than gamble on low odds.

After all, his ambitions reached beyond the heavens—he aimed for immortality!

But now, the problem was clear: reaching the peak of mid-Foundation Establishment wasn't the issue—finding the breakthrough pill was.

Surely he couldn't repeat the process of developing a "low-tier Foundation Establishment pill" from scratch again?

Counting on his fingers, Lin Shan grimaced. Starting from basic pills, refining them to Qi Refinement-grade Jade Pills, then Foundation Establishment-grade Dharma Pills—if the success rate still fell short of 90%, he might even need to upgrade them to Golden Core-grade Treasure Pills, as he had in the Eastern Sea.

That would cost a whopping 56 points of Ancient Charm!

"Given my current comprehension, should I study alchemy?"

Between cultivation,阵法 studies, and now alchemy, he'd be stretched too thin.

Just then, the miniature skeleton at his waist spoke up. Though it didn't understand what Lin Shan was calculating, it could guess his dilemma.

"Brother, if you're looking for a breakthrough pill, perhaps consider an alternative approach. There's another way."
