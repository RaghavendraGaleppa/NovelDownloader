# Chapter 188: Reunion and Divine Spirit Manifestation

Everyone stared dumbfounded at the massive yellow ring in the sky, formed by the convergence of countless earth spiritual energies from heaven and earth. As it rotated, whether it was raging winds or towering waves, everything came to a silent standstill.

This method of absolute suppression by mobilizing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to alter local weather and calm the seas could only be achieved by one answer:

A Nascent Soul grandmaster.

An unremarkable old man emerged from the demonic sect's flying vessel. Step by step, he walked on air, slowly approaching the suspended Yan Yuanchun at the center of the battlefield. Under her disbelieving gaze, he gently embraced her.

"Yuanchun, I'm here."

These words seemed to have been pent up for countless years, carrying the weight of endless longing that had settled in his heart, turning over in every dream, stealing countless glances, and passing by each other in chance encounters time and again. Who could resist the stirring in his heart?

The willow by the palace, once so green—does it still stand today?

His aged, trembling body, with skin as loose as old vines on withered trees, was a far cry from the dashing immortal prodigy he once was, now reduced to a decrepit old man with clouded eyes.

Since parting, memories of our meetings linger; how many times have we met in dreams? Tonight, holding up the silver lamp, I fear this reunion is but another dream.

Yuanchun reached out in disbelief, touching the weathered face before her, where traces of the familiar features from years past could faintly be discerned. Tears streamed down her face.

"How did you become like this?"

The old man held Yuanchun with one arm while covering her delicate hand on his face with the other, his voice choked with emotion.

"Back then, I was blinded and abandoned you, obsessed with seeking the opportunity to break through to the Nascent Soul stage. Though I barely succeeded, it cost me centuries of lifespan, leaving me in this state..."

"I was too ashamed to face you, so I could only silently watch over you from the shadows."

"All these years, I've been filled with regret. If only I hadn't left back then..."

The two wept as they poured out their hearts, embracing each other in the warmth of their long-awaited reunion, oblivious to the world around them. In that moment, nothing else existed but each other.

Lin Shan and the demonic sect underlings stood dumbstruck, watching the affectionate couple at the center of the ring, their minds struggling to process the scene. The young Luan Chun, unexpectedly a romantic at heart, covered her mouth, nearly bursting into tears.

All eyes were fixed on the pair, witnessing their miraculous reunion, unable to conceal their shock.

Lin Shan stared blankly at the old man, who wore Zhong Laotou's clothes but had the face of...

Huang Xianshi?!

So where was the original Zhong Laotou? And how had the deceased Huang Xianshi come back to life?

After all, Lin Shan had personally buried Huang Xianshi deep in the mountains of the Yan Yun range. He had witnessed Huang Xianshi being devoured by the green-robed elder's flying ants. How could he have been resurrected? And as a Nascent Soul grandmaster, no less?

The demonic sect followers were equally stunned. They had spent over a decade with Zhong Laotou—spreading their teachings in the Xianyu Sea, traversing the Poison Burial Canyon, chasing Foundation Establishment cultivators in the puppet war chariot, and participating in the final battle between the righteous and demonic sects.

And now, this old man was a Nascent Soul grandmaster?

The righteous sect members from the Zixiao Sect were equally terrified. Weren't all the demonic sect's Nascent Soul elders supposed to be trapped in the volcanic islands of the East Sea? How was there one here? And after ganging up on his woman, would he seek revenge?

Quick-witted individuals like Lei Yuzi and Lin Fan had already begun inching away, preparing to flee at the first sign of trouble.

After all, Nascent Soul grandmasters could manifest divine powers beyond comprehension, far beyond what Golden Core or Foundation Establishment cultivators could handle. Why not take advantage of the lovers' reunion to slip away unnoticed?

But while imagination was rich, reality was stark.

Huang Xianshi turned his head at just the right moment, his voice icy with killing intent.

"And where do you think you're going?"

"Uh..."

The Zixiao Sect members froze mid-step, reluctantly turning back with expressions caught between laughter and tears.

Fortunately, their middle-aged leader had some presence of mind. Knowing that they had just beaten the man's beloved to a pulp, he realized there was no chance of talking their way out. It was better to scatter and flee.

"Split up and run!" he bellowed.

"Run? Where to?"

Before the righteous cultivators could react, Huang Xianshi flicked his sleeve. The golden ring in the sky descended, transforming into earthen prisons that trapped all the Foundation Establishment and Qi Refinement cultivators.

The five Golden Core cultivators, with their profound mana, weren't so easily restrained by mere elemental energy.

Huang Xianshi simply pushed his palm forward, and a massive earthen handprint flew out, gathering the surrounding spiritual energy as it grew to colossal proportions.

"Come back here!"

The sky-obscuring hand swept forward, effortlessly capturing all five Golden Core cultivators. Their struggles were as futile as ants beneath a human's fingers, pitiful and laughable.

The demonic cultivators erupted in cheers, thrilled by the sight of Zhong Laotou—now revealed as a Nascent Soul grandmaster—effortlessly suppressing five Golden Core experts with a wave of his hand. Morale soared.

As for the tangled history between Zhong Laotou and Protector Yan, they wisely chose to ignore it.

The five Zixiao Sect Golden Core cultivators struggled desperately, trying to escape Huang Xianshi's grasp, but the earthen handprint was clearly an extraordinary divine ability, far beyond their power to break. They could only flail about like headless flies.

The thousands of righteous cultivators on the battlefield wore expressions of despair. Facing a demonic Nascent Soul elder, they couldn't fight or flee. Death seemed inevitable.

Lin Shan couldn't help but worry for Lin Fan and Lei Yuzi, fearing Huang Xianshi might casually execute them. After all, they were his sworn brothers and life-saving benefactors.

But over a decade had passed. Would Huang Xianshi still acknowledge their past friendship? Moreover, Lin Shan had once exploited Zhong Laotou as cheap labor, and Lei Yuzi had just beaten up his woman...

Indeed, Huang Xianshi's killing intent was palpable. Normally, he wouldn't have bothered with the squabbles between the righteous and demonic sects. His sole purpose had been to secretly protect Yan Yuanchun.

He had hesitated to reveal himself, burdened by guilt and shame. But when the righteous cultivators had nearly killed her, he could no longer stand by.

If they dared to strike first, they couldn't blame him for striking back!

A flash of malice crossed Huang Xianshi's eyes as he clenched his fist, preparing to crush them all with his divine ability.

Just then—

"Ah..."

A sigh, ancient and weary, echoed through heaven and earth, as if having witnessed all the world's splendor and the sorrows of mortal life. A dragon-like, overwhelming presence suddenly descended.

The calm sea surged once more, the stilled winds howled, and the scattered rain poured down in torrents. Wood spiritual energy within a thirty-mile radius went berserk, forming an emerald vortex in the sky as beautiful as a celestial river's rings.

From among the righteous cultivators, another unremarkable old man stepped forward.

"......"

Everyone stared in stunned silence at this spectacle, feeling as if they were in a dream.

Who?

Who was this?

Copying Huang Xianshi's entrance was one thing, but creating opposing celestial phenomena?

Today had shattered their worldviews. First, a hidden Nascent Soul elder on the demonic side, and now one on the righteous side too?

Amid the storm, lightning, and thunder, a plainly dressed old man leisurely stepped forward. His movements carried an indescribable grace, and the emerald ring in the sky rotated in rhythm with his steps.

With a gentle point of his finger, countless green vines sprouted within the massive earthen handprint, entangling and wrapping around it before—

"Boom!"

It exploded into motes of spiritual energy, dissipating into the sky. The intermingling yellow and green lights created a dazzling display.

The five Zixiao Sect Golden Core cultivators, now free, hurriedly retreated to their ranks, eyeing the old man with suspicion. None recognized him from the righteous sects.

Clearly another Nascent Soul grandmaster, specializing in the Wood Dao, his calm demeanor spoke volumes.

"Fellow Daoist, such skill cannot belong to an unknown figure. Dare you reveal your true form?" Huang Xianshi's expression was cold, showing no fear as he held Yan Yuanchun and glared at the newcomer.

"Why not?"

The old man smiled slightly, first offering a courteous bow before his face shimmered and transformed, revealing his true appearance.

The crowd gasped in unison, Lin Shan included. This man was legendary—not only had they heard of him, but most had seen his portraits.

"Venerable Pure Lotus!"

The only Nascent Soul rogue cultivator in the East Sea, a monster who had dominated the region for seven centuries. In terms of seniority, he far surpassed everyone present, having been famous long before most were born.

No one knew exactly how old he was or the extent of his cultivation, as he rarely made moves.

As far as anyone could remember, this Nascent Soul grandmaster had lived quietly on Ku Xu Island in the East Sea, cultivating in seclusion. Yet his formidable reputation in the Great Song cultivation world remained untarnished.

"Fellow Daoist, this old man was entrusted by the Zixiao Sect's elders to look after their disciples in the East Sea. I apologize for any offense caused."

Venerable Pure Lotus was the picture of courtesy, his words as refreshing as a spring breeze. He exuded vitality, like an ancient evergreen tree—towering and majestic.

The righteous cultivators finally understood: the Zixiao Sect elders, worried about their safety, had secretly enlisted the help of this East Sea powerhouse.

After losing one Nascent Soul seed, Lei Yinzi, the sect couldn't afford to lose another in Lei Yuzi. With Lin Fan, the "troublemaker," also in their ranks, it was no surprise the elders had sought external protection.

Huang Xianshi silently gauged the other's overwhelming aura but stood his ground. Before his beloved, he was resolute.

"These juniors injured my wife. This matter cannot be dropped so easily!"

Seeing Huang Xianshi's defiance, the previously cowed demonic cultivators straightened up again. With their own Nascent Soul elder standing firm, why should they fear?

Venerable Pure Lotus chuckled, shaking his head with hands behind his back. "Fellow Daoist, though you've reached the Nascent Soul stage, I've been at this realm for centuries. You are no match for me."

"Whether I am or not, we'll find out soon enough!"

Huang Xianshi straightened his hunched posture, his sleeves billowing as his aura surged.

"Roar—"

A colossal beast, neither deer nor horse, with four antler-like horns and a flowing white tail, materialized behind him, roaring at the heavens.

"Jue Ru!"

Everyone recognized it—the legendary divine beast, Jue Ru.

The heavens and earth were boundless in their wonders. Just as artifacts could birth innate spirits, so too could nature produce divine beasts.

These true spirits embodied the essence of mountains and rivers, the brilliance of the sun and moon, and the vast fortune of the cosmos. Born with the power to traverse realms and wander the void, they moved freely between worlds, unbound by constraints.

Such beings were rarely seen in the mortal realm, appearing only in legends of the endless void or the immortal world. Fewer than a hundred had ever been recorded.

It was said that true spirits were unique—born of heaven and earth, they could propagate their bloodline, but their descendants could never inherit their true spirit status.

Only when a true spirit perished could a new one be born or ascend, as if inheriting a singular divine imprint.

Creatures like dragons, phoenixes, and qilins were merely descendants of true spirits. The true Dragon and Phoenix were singular entities, lofty beings comparable to immortal kings.

Some demonic clans inherited traces of true spirit bloodlines, awakening divine abilities that dominated their kind. Human cultivators who studied true spirits might also manifest corresponding avatars upon reaching the Nascent Soul stage.

Nascent Soul cultivators could command the spiritual energy of heaven and earth across dozens of miles. In battle, summoning their avatar could amplify their divine abilities manifold.

Huang Xianshi's Jue Ru avatar, clearly aligned with the earth element, granted him innate mastery over earth-based techniques, enhancing his combat prowess.

The crowd gazed up at the towering avatar with awe, envy, longing, and fear. This was the pinnacle of power, a force none dared provoke in the cultivation world.

The righteous cultivators turned to Venerable Pure Lotus, wondering if he would abandon them or stand his ground.

With a carefree laugh, the old man trembled slightly. Behind him, chaos parted as a green lotus rose gracefully, swaying amidst a mist of radiant colors. Though barely three feet tall—shorter than the man himself—no one dared underestimate it.

Nascent Soul avatars took countless forms: divine beasts, plants, weapons, artifacts, even demons and buddhas. This unassuming lotus might hold unimaginable power.

The green lotus's symbolism rivaled that of true spirits, revered in both Daoist and Buddhist traditions. Clearly, Venerable Pure Lotus's heritage was extraordinary.

The sky split into yellow and green, the two auras dividing the heavens. One side was calm, the other stormy; the Jue Ru stood menacingly as the lotus swayed in the rain.

Huang Xianshi and Venerable Pure Lotus faced off, their auras clashing.

The battle was about to begin.
