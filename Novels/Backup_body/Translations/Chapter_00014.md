# Chapter 14: From This Day On, Ascending to the Heavens!

The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect was divided into six branches.

The Ancient Moon Peak branch currently had twenty-three outer sect disciples who had cultivated their external martial arts to the peak. 

For this inner sect examination, three were present! 

As for the others, they had yet to reach the "Internal Qi" realm and thus did not participate in the assessment.

Apart from Li Zhengjing, the other two disciples looked at him with complex expressions. 

Li Zhengjing had only been in the sect for half a year. At the beginning of this month, he had reached the peak perfection of external martial arts, and by now, he had already cultivated Internal Qi within his organs.

The other two, lacking recommendation tokens from inner sect elders, had spent five years as labor disciples before being accepted into the outer sect. 

It had taken them several more years to reach the peak perfection of external martial arts. 

Now, they had finally cultivated Internal Qi, but one had taken nine months, while the other had taken a year and three months. 

In terms of combat prowess, Li Zhengjing's feat of slaying a spirit beast yesterday had already spread throughout the sect, far surpassing them!

Ignoring their gazes, Li Zhengjing looked ahead and thought, "Is that the inner sect elder overseeing this examination?"

Five stone plates stood in the courtyard. 

Four outer sect deacons stood on either side, while an elderly man sat at a long table in the center. He appeared to be in his sixties, wore a golden token at his waist, and had a calm demeanor.

"Outer sect disciple Li Zhengjing, step forward!"

At the deacon's call, Li Zhengjing stepped forward, removed his upper garment, revealing his tall and muscular physique. 

He approached the five stone plates, clenched his fist, and his blood and qi surged. 

With a burst of force from his organs, his muscles and bones expanded instantly, his skin thickened, and his fist, now the size of a sand pot, struck downward.

**Boom!**

The stone plate before him shattered into pieces! 

As dust scattered, Li Zhengjing withdrew his fist and heard the inner sect elder's calm voice.

"His blood and qi surge with force, and his skin, flesh, and bones have been tempered to their current peak solidity. His external martial arts have indeed reached the pinnacle of perfection."

"When shattering the stone plate, his Internal Qi circulated flawlessly, showing a solid foundation in the Internal Qi realm."

The inner sect elder took out a seal and stamped it beside Li Zhengjing's name, saying indifferently, "External arts perfected, Internal Qi achieved—verification complete!"

He then gestured for Li Zhengjing to step forward, took the silver token used as proof of assessment, inspected it, and said, "Stand aside and carve your name into this token with your finger. From now on, it will serve as your inner sect identity token!"

Li Zhengjing took the token and stepped aside. 

The token was light and made of a special material—only three fingers wide and less than half a foot long. 

Carving characters into it required more than brute strength; only those who had cultivated Internal Qi could achieve it with refined force.

This was the final stage of the inner sect examination. 

Without hesitation, Li Zhengjing channeled his Internal Qi to his fingertip and began carving his name stroke by stroke onto the token.

**Crack!**

He had only carved the first character when he heard the sound of another stone plate breaking. 

Looking up, he saw another participating disciple punch a stone plate, leaving it covered in cracks—though it hadn't shattered completely.

"His innate bone structure is slightly inferior, and his strength is somewhat lacking."

"But he has indeed reached the peak perfection of external martial arts and cultivated Internal Qi."

"Verification complete!"

Elder Gao stamped the seal, inspected the disciple's token, and returned it. 

The disciple took the token, walked back, and stood beside Li Zhengjing, looking up at him with a complicated expression.

"The Feather Transformation Immortal Sect is not a martial arts school—it is an immortal sect!"

The disciple lowered his voice and said slowly, "This is only the first threshold of cultivation. In the future, cultivation won't rely solely on physical strength! In the Internal Qi realm, I will surpass you!"

Li Zhengjing tilted his head, glanced down at him, and replied, "Alright."

The disciple looked up at him, inexplicably feeling a surge of frustration before lowering his gaze in dejection. 

Meanwhile, Li Zhengjing thought to himself, *"Yes, this is only the first threshold of cultivation."*

He now understood why, if he hadn't advanced to the inner sect within six days, he would have died without a complete corpse. 

To the Thousand Illusion Divine Lord, if one couldn't even cross this first threshold, they were unworthy of being one of his spare vessels!

Putting aside his thoughts, he focused on carving his name. Once the three characters "Li Zhengjing" were complete, he stepped forward and handed over the token.

The inner sect elder took it, inspected it, and suddenly gave him a scrutinizing look before smiling. 

"So, you're the young man who entered the sect with Yuan Zhengfeng's token?"

"Indeed."

Li Zhengjing looked up, noticing the elder's smile, and felt a flicker of hope. 

*"It seems Elder Yuan Zhengfeng didn't just have enemies in the sect—he had friends too!"*

*"This elder seems kind-hearted and nostalgic. If I'd met him earlier, perhaps I wouldn't have been harassed by Chen Youyu so often..."*

With this in mind, he couldn't help but feel anticipation, thinking, *"With his support in the inner sect, life will be much easier."*

Then the elder spoke indifferently, "Yuan Zhengfeng was always arrogant. In the past, he broke three of my ribs."

Li Zhengjing took a deep breath. 

*Could Elder Yuan do anything right?*

*How did he manage to make enemies everywhere in the sect?*

Exhaling, Li Zhengjing put on a solemn expression and said, "Fellow disciples should be friendly and supportive. Elder Yuan went too far!"

After a respectful bow, he added seriously, "To be honest, I'm not familiar with him at all—I've never even met him..."

The elder gave him a strange look before continuing, "But later, we developed a sort of friendship. He was aloof and had no friends in the sect. Before leaving the mountain, he left a jug of wine at my residence. Now that he's fallen outside the sect gates, I feel rather sorrowful..."

Li Zhengjing maintained his composure and said solemnly, "Though I never met Elder Yuan, I've long admired his legacy. My ancestors, who earned his favor, instructed their descendants that upon entering the sect, we should regard him as a revered forebear!"

The elder stared at him for a long moment before chuckling in approval. "Young man, you truly have no shame!"

With a wave of his hand, he said, "Very well, go pack your things and prepare to move into the inner sect."

Then he stood and addressed the three new inner sect disciples. 

"Remember, within three days, use your inner sect tokens to claim two sets of robes, one weapon, and one combat technique."

"As new inner sect disciples, these are granted freely—a privilege from the sect!"

"But from now on, to obtain robes, weapons, techniques, elixirs, talismans, and other resources, you must contribute to the sect and earn merits!"

"Having just reached the Internal Qi realm, your abilities are still weak. Avoid overly dangerous tasks—act within your limits!"

With that, he waved them off and left. As he passed Li Zhengjing, he murmured softly, "As a new disciple, you can take on tasks like compiling texts. The merits are small, but it's safe."

Li Zhengjing paused, recalling the texts in the outer sect's library—likely compiled by new inner sect disciples for merits.

After Elder Gao left, he returned to his courtyard, stuffed the Five Elements Creation Tree into a chest containing gold and silver using a sack and chains, then packed a few clothes before heading to the inner sect.

"Below Ancient Moon Peak lies the outer sect."

"The mountainside is home to the inner sect."

"Higher up reside the true disciples and inner sect elders."

"And at the peak stands the grand hall—the residence of the current Ancient Moon Peak Master, the First Seat True Person!"

As he ascended the mountain, he gazed at the scenery of the Feather Transformation Immortal Sect.

The sect's six immortal peaks towered into the clouds, ethereal and dreamlike.

Green mountains, clear waters, blue skies, and white clouds.

From this day on, he would ascend to the heavens!
