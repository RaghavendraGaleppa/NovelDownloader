# Chapter 487: The Sword Rises, the Sword Extinguishes

The moment it appeared, it seemed to forcibly freeze time and space for an instant.

This sword light was as vast as a surging starry sea, yet as condensed as a needle capable of piercing the heavens.

It disregarded distance entirely. The moment it was born, its supreme sharpness had already traversed the firmament.

Its target was none other than the琉璃 (Glass-like) Buddha Palm, descended by the supreme will of the Buddhist Sect, which was about to seize Xu Yunfan.

Where the sword light passed.

There was no earth-shattering explosion.

No surging tide of annihilating energy.

Only a silent...

*"Sss."*

It was like a hot branding iron pressed into soft snow, or a paper knife slicing through the thinnest silk.

That琉璃 Buddha Palm, which contained supreme Buddha power capable of capturing stars and moons and suppressing the heavens—along with the countless threads of karma entangled upon it, the boundless aura of purification, and the faintly visible seated phantom behind the palm—failed to even create a single ripple or obstruction. It was simply bisected by the sword light descending from the peak of the Sword Peak.

Clean! Sharp! Absolute!

The severed琉璃 Buddha Palm froze for a moment, then transformed into countless pure琉璃 light spots. Like fireflies scattered by the wind, they silently dissipated into the void between heaven and earth.

The phantom also trembled violently, like an image with an unstable signal. The lingering trace of anger and the indifference of impending success on its face were completely replaced by an indescribable horror at this moment.

True horror!

Incomprehensible, unbelievable horror.

Instantly filled the empty, spiritual eyes of that majestic figure.

This was not fear in the face of power.

It was as if it had seen something that should not exist in this world, should not appear here and now—something that overturned all cognition, an absolute...

Impossibility.

The sword light did not stop. After obliterating the琉璃 Buddha Palm, its force remained unabated. It stood between heaven and earth like a supreme sword curtain dividing light from dark and separating life from death, hanging silently in the air. The tip of the sword pointed directly at the "Three藏" phantom, whose face had yet to lose its expression of horror.

Cold, pure Sword Intent silently locked onto it.

It seemed to be questioning, or perhaps declaring: This is the Sword Domain. Those who cross the line...

Will be slain!

And that small black shadow saved by the sword light, Xu Yunfan, his body buffeted by the aftermath of this terrifying Sword Intent, could no longer hold on. His vision went black, and like a kite with a broken string, he fell straight down toward the wide bluestone plaza of the Wansheng Sword Sect's mountain gate.

The supreme sword curtain standing between heaven and earth possessed a cold, pure Sword Intent as deep as an abyss. Simply hovering before the "Three藏" phantom brought a terrifying pressure capable of freezing the soul and severing the cycle of karma.

The scene of the sword light slaying the琉璃 Buddha Palm was not a suppression of power, but more like an absolute transcendence and negation of a certain established law.

In the vast, spiritual eyes of the Amitabha Buddha's manifested body, the lingering horror had yet to fade when it felt the foundation of its own existence.

That琉璃 pure light and boundless Buddha rhythm, refined by the supreme Buddha will, were emitting silent cries of grief and disintegrating under the dead silence and cutting intent brought by that sword light.

*"Hum!"*

The seated phantom trembled violently, like a琉璃 mirror surface struck by a boulder, its surface manifesting countless fine cracks.

On the face that originally lowered its brows and gazed down with compassion for all living beings, the pain and disbelief of the "Three藏" true nature clearly appeared for the first time.

*"World Honored One... Tathagata..."*

A wisp of will, weak to the point of almost shattering, attempted to communicate with the Western Buddhist Kingdom, seeking a response or aid from that supreme existence.

However, what responded to it was absolute silence.

As if the sword curtain standing before it had not only severed the琉璃 Buddha Palm, but also severed an invisible line of karma spanning endless time and space.

The Bodhi Pure Land seemed to be isolated behind an invisible barrier.

The heart of Three藏—no, the core will currently occupying this projection body—sank heavily.

It was not that the World Honored One Tathagata had abandoned him, but rather...

Nanzhou, Wansheng Sword Sect!

The existence residing at the peak of the Sword Peak, who wielded such a world-shocking sword...

Its power and rank were no longer comparable to that of an ordinary True Lord.

And this mountain gate was precisely the territory of the Wansheng Sword Sect!

Currently, the one cultivating in seclusion atop the Sword Peak, guarding this place, and the current controller of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

Pure Yang True Lord!

The Wansheng Sword Sect was not merely the leader of famous orthodox sects. Behind it lay a supreme tradition capable of making even the immortals of the Nine Heavens take notice—a supreme tradition that possessed a Dao Lord!

The Wansheng Sword Sect also had a Dao Lord.

The will of the Amitabha Buddha's manifested body instantly realized. Pure Yang True Lord had intervened, and with such an undeniable, resolute stance akin to "slaying demons to protect the Dao," he had obliterated its attack projection. This was a clear display of will.

This place would not tolerate the Buddhist Sect's arrogance.

The fact that it could keep this projection body from being completely annihilated on the spot, dissolving into light spots rather than having its soul scattered, was already Pure Yang True Lord giving the utmost tolerance and a way out, considering the boundless face of the World Honored One Tathagata.

Further entanglement would be futile. If it forced the issue, not only would this projection body, which cost a great deal to refine, be completely extinguished, but it might also trigger an unpredictable, heaven-shaking catastrophe between the Bodhi Pure Land and the Wansheng Sword Sect.

*"Amitabha... It is good, it is good..."*

A grand Buddha name, filled with extreme helplessness, grievance, and a trace of lingering fear, accompanied by the faint sound of shattering琉璃, echoed through the sky, yet sounded incredibly pale.

The next moment, the phantom, covered in cracks, suddenly collapsed and burst apart like residual snow melting completely under the sun.

There was no earth-shattering explosion, only fragments of light as pure as琉璃, yet containing the essence of infinite Buddha power. Like fireflies in the wind, they rapidly dimmed and decomposed, ultimately transforming into countless imperceptible golden rays of Buddha light that shot toward the distant Western direction, vanishing beyond the horizon in the blink of an eye.

In the original location, only the true body of the Three藏 monk remained, stumbling back and spitting out a large mouthful of golden blood.

His face was as pale as gold paper, his aura decaying to the extreme, like a candle in the wind, struggling even to maintain his levitation.

The faded kasaya was soaked in his own golden blood, sticky and cold.

The compassion and detachment in his eyes were long gone, replaced only by deep-seated fear, unbelievable confusion, and an indescribable sense of humiliation.

He struggled to look toward the sky above the peak of the Wansheng Sword Peak, which was once again shrouded in chaotic clouds. Deep in his eyes were unwillingness and venom, but ultimately, they transformed into deep apprehension and powerlessness.

He truly had not imagined that Pure Yang True Lord would actually intervene for a demonic path True Person. And if he were to intervene, he would do so with such force that even the Amitabha Buddha's manifested body could not withstand it.

He could be certain that this Sword Intent had not exceeded any boundaries; it was merely using the level of a Foundation Establishment perfection, a Great True Person, to counter him. Yet even so, he still could not withstand a single sword strike.

He supported himself with his last bit of Buddha power, not even daring to leave a threat, let alone attempt to call upon the World Honored One Tathagata again. He knew he had failed his mission. Fortunately, the World Honored One Tathagata had never descended in true body; otherwise, he would surely have been slapped into oblivion.
