# Chapter 40: A Fake Core Is Still a Core  

The moment the dragon pearl fulfilled Wei Qian's wish, a torrent of information surged into his mind.  

Countless images and fragments flooded his consciousness, as though he had spent the past twenty-six days diligently practicing the *Art of Flame Manipulation* without rest.  

In the real world, Wei Qian opened his eyes and raised a finger before his face.  

In the next instant, spiritual energy surged from his dantian and erupted from his fingertip, transforming into spiritual flames.  

The flames danced at his fingertip, shifting shapes according to his will—now a fire serpent swimming through molten lava, now a galloping steed of flame, now a fiery bird spreading its wings in flight.  

Such mastery over spiritual flames was something only alchemists with over a decade of experience could achieve. Yet Wei Qian, at just twenty-six years old and having studied the art of alchemy for less than two months, had already reached this level.  

With a thought, the flames transformed into a fiery lotus and flew toward the charcoal beneath the cauldron, instantly igniting it.  

A raging fire blazed beneath the cauldron, its tongues of flame occasionally darting out to sweep medicinal herbs into the vessel, reducing them to liquid in mere moments.  

A dozen globules of medicinal essence merged together, gradually solidifying as the heat diminished.  

After a quarter of an hour, a rich medicinal fragrance filled the air, signaling the completion of the alchemical process.  

Twelve high-quality Qi Restoration Pills lay within the cauldron—each one a masterpiece.  

"Being a genius feels pretty good," Wei Qian remarked with genuine satisfaction.  

He gazed at the pills, but what he truly saw was a mountain of spirit stones. If he sold them, he could earn three—no, five times the profit!  

"Too bad I can't sell a single one."  

Every pill in this batch was of exceptional quality, and selling them would draw far too much attention.  

"If I ever do sell pills, I'll have to deliberately lower their quality," he mused.  

Wei Qian retrieved a small white jade vial and carefully stored all the pills inside. He would keep them for his own use.  

"Now, I can try refining Purple Qi Pills. But the ingredients are rare and expensive, and I can't source them from the Li Clan."  

His thoughts turned to Bai Fugui.  

After returning from Dan Ding Immortal City, Wei Qian had met with Bai Fugui once. The man had lamented that since Lu Ping's departure, he had lost a steady supply of high-quality talismans, causing his small business to suffer.  

Though Bai Fugui had spoken casually, Wei Qian had taken note.  

"I can use him to gather ingredients for me and sell the pills through him. A small cut of the profits should suffice." The more he thought about it, the more the idea appealed to him.  

He found an opportune moment to summon Bai Fugui and mentioned that he had recently taken up alchemy, hoping Bai Fugui could help him procure certain rare herbs.  

The moment Bai Fugui heard this, his innate business instincts kicked in. "Brother Wei, what's your current success rate with pill refinement?"  

Wei Qian feigned hesitation, dragging out his response before finally admitting that his success rate with Qi Restoration Pills was just one step away from profitability.  

"Fantastic!" Bai Fugui exclaimed, nearly jumping with excitement. "Brother Wei, if you ever decide to sell pills, you *must* give me a chance to work with you!"  

Selling pills was far more lucrative than talismans!  

From what Bai Fugui knew, Wei Qian's alchemical talent wasn't extraordinary, but it was certainly decent. Given his youth, there was even a chance he could become a second-rank alchemist in the future.  

A second-rank alchemist! Even the scraps from such a figure would be enough to make a lowly Qi Refining cultivator like Bai Fugui rich beyond measure.  

"If you help me gather the right ingredients, I'll definitely consider you first when I start selling pills," Wei Qian promised.  

He had a favorable impression of Bai Fugui and didn’t mind letting him share in the profits.  

"Ah, the feng shui of Misty Ridge Mountain must be exceptional. Not only has the Li Clan's fortune risen, but they've also gained a future master alchemist like you," Bai Fugui mused.  

Wei Qian's mind sharpened at the comment. "Rising fortune? What do you mean?"  

His question caught Bai Fugui off guard.  

"You... you don’t know? Elder Lai from the Ten Thousand Stars Sect just visited not long ago."  

The mention of the Ten Thousand Stars Sect immediately sharpened Wei Qian’s focus.  

"I know, but I’ve been so absorbed in alchemy that my mind’s been foggy. Tell me what you’ve heard—in detail," Wei Qian deflected.  

Bai Fugui didn’t suspect anything. After all, mastering any of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation required immense focus. Wei Qian’s behavior wasn’t unusual.  

He had no way of knowing that Wei Qian was a once-in-a-generation alchemical genius.  

"Word’s spread all through the local rogue cultivator circles."  

"Li Xianyao, the Li Clan’s Foundation Establishment elder, once saved someone’s life in a hidden cave realm during his youth. That person turned out to be Elder Lai Changyuan of the Ten Thousand Stars Sect, who visited recently."  

All elders of the Ten Thousand Stars Sect were Core Formation cultivators—a fact that aligned with Wei Qian’s earlier deductions.  

"Everyone only found out now that the Li Clan had such a connection. Elder Li kept it well-hidden."  

"Now that it’s out in the open, the Li Clan has stabilized overnight. I’ve heard even the Wang Clan of Blackwater Pond has been lying low, staying within their territory and avoiding unnecessary outings!"  

The Wang Clan had a poor reputation, so Bai Fugui was pleased to see them humbled.  

"Elder Li keeping it hidden... That doesn’t add up. Not at all."  

Though Bai Fugui spoke casually, Wei Qian, well-versed in human nature, immediately sensed something amiss.  

If the Li Clan had possessed this connection all along, they would have used it long before now—not held onto it until the last moment.  

The simplest solution would have been to ask Elder Lai to escort their disciples to Dan Ding Immortal City’s auction. There would have been no need for convoluted schemes or paying exorbitant prices to travel to Black Serpent Immortal City instead.  

Even if they hadn’t used the connection, merely revealing its existence would have been enough to deter the Wang Clan.  

A fake Core is still a Core!  

When true Golden Cores are absent, a fake Core is still a true cultivator!  

In short, if the Li Clan had this connection from the start, they would have exploited it in countless better ways—not in this haphazard, inefficient manner.  

There was definitely more to this story—something involving high-level cultivators.  

What Bai Fugui knew was merely the surface.  

Wei Qian had no interest in digging deeper into the hidden machinations.  

He only cared about one thing: Would the Li Clan remain stable?  

"Ever since I joined the Li Clan, one major event after another has unfolded."  

"Surely that’s just a coincidence... right?"
