# Chapter 40: The Most Tragic Second-Life Revenant in History!

Heavens above!  

Earth below!  

There’s always a way out!  

Dou Changsheng’s heart, which had been utterly lifeless just moments ago, suddenly surged back to life.  

Watching Qingyang Daoren glare at him with furious, hate-filled eyes, Dou Changsheng’s smile grew even brighter. The angrier Qingyang Daoren became, the more excited Dou Changsheng felt.  

In just half an hour, Dou Changsheng had experienced the highest highs and lowest lows. A game that had seemed utterly lost had been miraculously turned around by his own actions, flipping the situation on its head.  

Qingyang Daoren stared at Dou Changsheng with undisguised malice, his hand trembling as he fought the urge to slap the young man dead on the spot. No matter how prodigious Dou Changsheng’s talent, if he never lived long enough to mature, it would all be meaningless.  

But Qingyang Daoren could sense a cold, detached gaze watching him from above—Princess Ye, Tang Qingyan. Even though Dou Changsheng stood right before him, if Tang Qingyan chose to intervene, she could whisk him away effortlessly.  

Though Tang Qingyan was merely a Pure Yin Grandmaster—a rank shared by many—she was listed on the Earthly Rankings, while others could only gaze upon it from afar. The reason? Her unparalleled speed, ranked third in the world.  

Qingyang Daoren seethed with hatred, muttering bitterly, "I... I actually fell so easily."  

He had never imagined that someone like Dou Changsheng could exist.  

The Rebirth Mystic Water, refined through the secret techniques of the Three Yang Divine Lord, was a rare treasure of heaven and earth, a miraculous healing substance. In an era where the Three Yang Divine Lord had vanished, the value of this Rebirth Mystic Water would skyrocket.  

For most people, such a treasure would be hoarded, used only in life-or-death situations.  

But Dou Changsheng had used it on a corpse.  

The legend of reviving the dead was just that—a legend. Who would dare gamble with the last remaining Rebirth Mystic Water on such a gamble? Even the most curious would restrain themselves.  

Yet here was this fool, doing exactly that.  

And with that, Qingyang Daoren’s flawless plan had been shattered by the biggest oversight of all—he hadn’t died. He had been revived.  

"If I’d known this would happen," Qingyang Daoren lamented bitterly, "I would have used a fake Rebirth Mystic Water."  

Dou Changsheng sneered and cut him off. "No, you wouldn’t. If the Rebirth Mystic Water had been fake, your death would have been flawed. The world would have suspected you of framing me rather than believing I’d obtained the Qingyang Secret Arts."  

"To make it convincing, to ensure all attention was diverted to me so you could hide safely in the shadows..."  

"The Rebirth Mystic Water had to be real."  

Dou Changsheng’s tone was absolute.  

After a brief pause, he continued, "You must have planned this for a long time, just waiting for the right opportunity."  

"An ordinary person wouldn’t be a suitable scapegoat for the Qingyang legacy."  

"But my appearance gave you the perfect chance."  

"I came from the wilderness, but because I obtained fragments of martial arts early on, people mistook me for a descendant of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan."  

"You believed it too—that I had extraordinary talent and a powerful background. The Wang Clan would never abandon me, so even if I became the inheritor of the Qingyang legacy, they would shield me from the greedy masses. I wouldn’t die anytime soon."  

"And in that time, you could fake your death and escape cleanly."  

"Admittedly, it was a brilliant plan."  

"But your cleverness was your downfall."  

"You succeeded because of the Rebirth Mystic Water—and failed because of it."  

Qingyang Daoren’s expression darkened. He had never once doubted the value of the Rebirth Mystic Water, which was precisely why he never imagined someone would feed it to a corpse. And since no one would do that, the greatest secret of the Rebirth Mystic Water would remain hidden.  

His faked death would have gone off without a hitch.  

Even if his body were damaged, it wouldn’t matter—the Rebirth Mystic Water could revive the dead and regrow flesh from bones.  

Dou Changsheng looked at Qingyang Daoren with pity, as if gazing upon a corpse.  

Because that’s what he was—dead.  

The Rebirth Mystic Water was already invaluable, tied to the former top-ranked figure on the Earthly Rankings, the Three Yang Divine Lord. Now, with its ability to revive the dead, its worth would skyrocket to unimaginable heights.  

Especially since the Rebirth Mystic Water was artificially refined, not a natural treasure.  

The secret technique behind it could reshape the world.  

Of course, Dou Changsheng knew that true resurrection was impossible. The Rebirth Mystic Water couldn’t bring back the fully dead—Qingyang Daoren had only revived because his spirit hadn’t fully dissipated. He hadn’t been completely dead.  

But the world wouldn’t care.  

Even Earthly Ranking Grandmasters had regrets.  

Take the current head of the Xiangzhou Wang Clan, Wang Tianyang. In his youth, he had been a prodigy, excelling in both civil and martial arts. After entering officialdom, his integrity earned him the favor of the late emperor, making him a pillar of the state.  

The Wang Clan had flourished because of him.  

The current clan head, however, had been a troublemaker in his youth, often relying on his elder brother’s care.  

Their bond had been deep. If given the chance to bring his brother back, wouldn’t he take it?  

And that was just one example. Brothers, fathers and sons, husbands and wives—the bonds in the martial world were countless.  

Who in life had no regrets?  

Lost loved ones, departed friends.  

Now, they had a chance for a second life.  

Even if the odds were slim, they would go mad for it.  

It didn’t matter that the Three Yang Divine Lord had disappeared. Even if he were still alive, people would risk everything for this power.  

Men would die for wealth, birds for food—when the stakes were high enough, nothing was off-limits.  

Qingyang Daoren’s remaining years would be spent in captivity. Even if he revealed the Qingyang Secret Arts, he would never be freed.  

He would become the greatest treasure in the martial world.  

Compared to him, the struggles between the Military and Civil Factions were trivial.  

Only an Earthly Ranking Grandmaster in the top ten could stand above such dangers.  

But Qingyang Daoren was just an ordinary Divine Marvel Grandmaster.  

He was alive, but already dead.  

A fate worse than death—unable to die even if he wanted to.  

Realizing this, Qingyang Daoren let out a bitter laugh but made no further attempts to resist.  

Because a figure clad in azure robes, with graying temples and a nine-tiered exquisite pagoda resting in his palm, had appeared silently just three steps away.  

The man was stern-faced, exuding an aura of unquestionable authority.  

He spoke calmly:  

"Qingyang, you used the 'Five Ghosts Transport Technique' to embezzle military funds, selling them to Southern Chen and betraying Great Jin."  

"The evidence is irrefutable."  

"Come with me."  

A light laugh rang out as Tang Qingyan brushed aside a strand of her dark hair. Her voice was cool as she said, "Qingyang recently murdered subjects of Southern Chen. Our Great Chen has always upheld the principle of blood for blood, tooth for tooth."  

"He must be taken to Jiangdu for judgment by the Demon Master."  

Dou Changsheng quietly retreated, signaling his desire to stay uninvolved.  

But after just one step, a hand rested on his shoulder, and a slice of freshly cut watermelon was pressed into his palm. An elderly figure materialized beside him, munching on his own slice as he mumbled, "The Pagoda-Bearing Heavenly King, Liu Baiyu!"  

"One of the few remaining formidable figures of the Jin imperial clan."  

"Ranked fourteenth on the Earthly Rankings, with hopes of breaking into the top ten."  

"Pity he was born in the wrong era."  

"If this were a few decades earlier, he’d have the strength for it."  

"But in recent years, since the new Wolf Lord took power, conquering all in his path and hailed as a once-in-a-millennium ruler of the grasslands..."  

"Not only is the Wolf Lord peerless, but the grasslands have also produced a surge of experts, entering an era of prosperity."  

"Major tribes have been subjugated, and even warriors from the Polar Regions have entered the grasslands, submitting to the Wolf Lord’s command."  

"Among them, two earth-shaking figures have emerged."  

"Combined with the Wolf Lord himself, the grasslands now hold three of the top ten spots on the Earthly Rankings."  

Dou Changsheng was familiar with this Wolf Lord—as were most, given that the Demon Master of Southern Chen ranked first on the Earthly Rankings, while the Wolf Lord ranked second.  

The Hu barbarians of the grasslands were a dire threat, and much of that stemmed from him.  

Second on the Earthly Rankings, peerless in martial arts, and commanding hundreds of thousands of elite cavalry—his power and authority had reached their zenith.  

The old man tossed his watermelon rind aside and sighed. "Since the Wolf Lord’s rise, it’s as if the heavens favor the grasslands."  

"The Polar warriors, who once kept to themselves, now have a Great Sage who entered the royal court with a wooden staff, becoming the grasslands’ State Preceptor."  

"The Shamanic Sect has also emerged from seclusion to serve him."  

"Other grassland warriors have ventured south, clashing with the four great nations—winning far more than they lose."  

"The long-dormant grasslands seem to have accumulated a thousand years of fortune, all bursting forth in this generation."  

The old man shook his head, suddenly finding the current conflict meaningless.  

With the grasslands’ rise, their experts had claimed spots on the Earthly Rankings, squeezing out others. The Martial Forest Pavilion, impartial in its rankings, hadn’t excluded the grasslands, but the consequences were stark—three of the top ten spots now belonged to the grasslands.  

The remaining seven were divided among the four great nations and smaller states.  

"The grasslands have risen, while Great Jin remains mired in infighting."  

"The generals and ministers are at odds."  

"This empire..."  

He left the rest unsaid, but the implication was clear.  

Without external threats, Great Jin’s sheer size would ensure its survival—though not without turmoil. But the Wolf Lord was no guard dog.  

He was a wolf.  

A ravenous, insatiable beast.  

Though he had remained quiet for years, when he finally moved, the world would tremble.  

Wang Tianhe sighed repeatedly. Yu Yun’s voluntary imprisonment hadn’t quelled the conflict—it had escalated it.  

The northern territories were in turmoil, no longer under imperial control. If things worsened, the north might rebel. Recalling Wang Tieqiang’s words—"Three days to besiege Daliang, ten to conquer Liang, then march on the capital"—sent a chill down his spine.  

That was Yu Yun’s sworn brother, a high-ranking general of the Military Faction. If even he spoke like this, the sentiments of other northern Grandmasters were obvious.  

Decades of marginalizing the north, treating its people as barbarians, had borne bitter fruit. The north no longer sought recognition—it sought to take what it wanted by force.  

The north now boasted five Earthly Ranking experts—nearly a third of Great Jin’s total.  

Their martial prowess far outstripped their wealth, fueling deep resentment.  

Why fight the Hu barbarians when the wealthy south lay within easy reach?  

The late emperor’s sudden death had left the northern issue unresolved, festering until it became a mortal threat.  

But this was none of his concern.  

As long as the Wang Clan endured, nothing else mattered.  

The more one acted, the more mistakes one made.  

His elder brother had failed to understand that, meddling in imperial affairs—and so he had died.  

The Wang Clan was the Wang Clan. Xiangzhou was Xiangzhou.  

If the worst came, they could always flee south. The Demon Master would shield them.  

Let the tall bear the brunt.  

Wang Tianhe glanced at the standoff between Liu Baiyu and Tang Qingyan, then at the hidden observers. With a light push, he nudged Dou Changsheng forward.  

"The Three Yang Divine Lord was a marvel of the ages."  

"His Qingyang Secret Arts were meant to benefit the world."  

"This young man, Dou Changsheng, is the inheritor you chose for the arts."  

"Why not teach him, then let him share them with the world? A noble endeavor, wouldn’t you agree?"  

Liu Baiyu shot Wang Tianhe a cold look. This "Cloud Crane of the Nine Heavens" was a far cry from his elder brother—skilled at evasion and sophistry, but little else.  

Finally, Liu Baiyu fixed his gaze on Qingyang Daoren. "Don’t think silence will save you."  

"You slandered the emperor and colluded with Southern Chen."  

"These are grave crimes."  

"We have ways to make you talk."  

Qingyang Daoren’s eyes burned with despair. He knew it was true.  

Before, they hadn’t resorted to such measures out of respect for the Three Yang Divine Lord and because the Rebirth Mystic Water’s value hadn’t justified the cost of soul-searching techniques.  

But now, it did.  

Even if the Three Yang Divine Lord stood here, they would say the same.  

In less than an hour, Qingyang Daoren had soared to the heights of heaven—only to plummet into the depths of hell.  

His gaze locked onto Dou Changsheng, hatred blazing in his eyes. This man had doomed him, leaving him with no escape.  

If not for Dou Changsheng, he would never have considered using him. If not for Dou Changsheng feeding him the Rebirth Mystic Water, its greatest secret would have remained hidden.  

Dou Changsheng was the root of it all.  

Qingyang Daoren closed his eyes, then reopened them, his expression calm once more.  

"I will teach him the Qingyang Secret Arts."  

"The method to refine Rebirth Mystic Water."  

The cost of soul-searching was immense, but if multiple factions shared the burden, it would become trivial.  

Wang Tianhe nodded. "Speak here."  

"Those present are all esteemed figures. None would eavesdrop."  

A private conversation was out of the question.  

Wang Tianhe wanted it public to avoid becoming a target. By having Dou Changsheng spread the knowledge, they would earn the world’s gratitude.  

Any underhanded schemes would only backfire.
