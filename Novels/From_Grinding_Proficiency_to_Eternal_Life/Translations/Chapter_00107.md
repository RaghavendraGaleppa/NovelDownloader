# Chapter 107: Sinew Perfection

‘You practiced the Flying Leg Technique diligently, feeling the Qi and blood in the soles of your feet surge like burning flames. Each step caused the earth to tremble slightly. When accelerating, it was as violent as a tsunami surging; when decelerating, it was as stable as a calm, waveless lake. Proficiency in the Flying Leg Technique has increased.’

‘You...’

‘The Flying Leg Technique has reached Perfection.’

‘Flying Leg Technique (Perfection)

Special Effects: Treading Water Without Sinking, Earth-Shrinking Step (Pseudo), Light-Shadow Separation, Sinew Thunder Resonance, Iron Plow Rending Earth, Void-Stepping Star Tread, Wind Born in a Hundred Bones, Swallow Treading Loop, Waterfall Severing Reverse Flow.’

In an instant, waves of warm currents surged within his body, rushing toward the major sinews throughout his system and beginning to strengthen them rapidly. As the sinews continuously twitched and snapped, they actually emitted sounds like the humming of bowstrings. Over time, twelve spiral-shaped collagen fibers rose within his body, coiling around pillars like dragons, gradually altering his original meridian distribution.

His spine suddenly cracked with seven crisp sounds, like a heavy crossbow being drawn.

Under the pressurized pumping, his blood took on a rusty scent, and the fascia network over his entire body multiplied and reconstructed at a visible rate.

Twelve pairs of spiral collagen fibers grew wildly along his kinetic lines, weaving his originally loose tendons into a composite armor structure.

He suddenly fell from a tree branch, stumbling to steady himself against a stone lock. His knuckles pressed against the blue stone surface, actually leaving five indents.

The fascia in his arches underwent a jade-like transformation amidst violent spasms. Faint blue blood vessels appeared under the moonlight like blood marrow embedded in ice种 jade.

It was more suitable for generating force, more suitable for explosive power, and more suitable for endurance.

He clearly saw the fascia on his soles unfurling layer by layer like tempered steel wire, evenly dispersing the impact force to his 287 foot bones.

This feeling was like installing the latest ultra-alloy high-strength spring steel onto his originally old springs.

Xu Yunfan raised his arm, clenched his fingers into a fist, and gently thrust forward. His body acted as the bow, and his great sinews stretched and snapped.

*Boom!*

A clear and audible sound of an air explosion suddenly rang out in the courtyard.

Success!

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, his face filled with joy. He shook his head continuously, digesting the cultivation memories that had spontaneously appeared in his mind.

Perfection of the major sinews, manifesting the appearance of Jade Meridians. In his memories, he had spent a full twenty years of bitter cultivation to achieve this, and even then, he had only barely stepped in after adding various harsh methods. The scenes of his daily practice were something he couldn't bear to look at.

It was too tragic.

What depressed him most was that in his memories, this body of his, remodeled with Jade Meridians, had taken a full twenty years.

It was too long.

Looking at the rooftop thirty meters away, Xu Yunfan moved his feet. The blue bricks under his feet silently cracked with a spider-web pattern, and the air suddenly let out a sharp whistle.

The next instant, Xu Yunfan had already stepped onto the rooftop and stood there, as if he had been standing there all along. He looked up at the thick, heavy clouds. Atop the summit of Guniu Mountain, it was as if it had become a Thunder Accumulation Mountain, with thunder and lightning flickering and winding down from time to time.

Coming like thunder收震怒, stopping like the river and sea凝清光.

It had only been two months, and he had achieved Sinew Perfection again!

Just as he was preparing to leave the city and stretch his legs to test his limit speed, a sound of clashing metal suddenly rang out from the depths of the Heavenly Work Cave, shaking the heavens.

*Buzz!!*

Xu Yunfan's eyes flashed, and he turned to see Fu Jin running over with all his might. Fu Jin stomped his foot, creating a pit in the ground, and leaped onto the roof. With continuous movements under his feet, the roof tiles were trampled into disarray, making Xu Yunfan's eyelids twitch.

If he had to have the Heavenly Work Department disciples come and repair the house, it would probably cost another dozen or so silver taels.

Before Xu Yunfan could speak, Fu Jin grabbed his wrist.

"Still showing off on the roof? Hurry and come with me! Your weapon has been forged by the Master!"

Dragged along by Fu Jin in a mad dash, Xu Yunfan saw Fu Jin's ecstatic expression and couldn't help but ask, "Senior Brother, what was that commotion just now?"

"A Treasure Artifact, a Treasure Artifact! When a Treasure Artifact is forged, it produces a resonant sound of its own accord. It can penetrate the clouds and announce its birth to the world."

Fu Jin's face was a mix of shock and joy, and he laughed heartily.

"You're a lucky小子, Master hasn't forged a Treasure Artifact in several years. Who would have thought that in just two months after you arrived, a Treasure Artifact has been forged. You cultivate a fortunate Dao. Your Senior Brother here has only ever used two lower fourth-grade Sharp Grade weapons, and that's only because I benefited from the Weapon Forging Hall."

Xu Yunfan was both shocked and delighted upon hearing this. He naturally understood just how rare a Treasure Artifact was.

Below Divine Weapons lay Treasure Artifacts. In terms of hierarchy, they were only one step away from Divine Weapons.

When Xu Yunfan was pulled by Fu Jin through the seventh layer of bronze gates, the scorching, searing heat washed over him, making his breathing painful.

On both sides of the corridor, thirty-six bronze human statues were pulling iron chains as thick as a bowl's mouth. The roar of meshing gears mixed with the scent of sulfur rushed at them.

When they burst through the final water curtain barrier before their eyes, Xu Yunfan's pupils were instantly filled with the crimson red before him.

A boiling Thunderfire Pool drawn up from deep within the earth lay like a fire dragon crouching on the ground's veins. Three ten-zhang-tall cast-iron bellows were being pushed by twelve bare-chested master craftsmen from the Weapon Forging Hall, the billowing airwaves causing the golden-red molten iron in the pool to surge like angry waves.

Above the Thunderfire Pool, a thick, barrel-sized refined steel pillar hung suspended, its other end reaching the cavern's dome.

"Steady your feet!"

Fu Jin suddenly grabbed Xu Yunfan's shoulder. As the two's toes tapped repeatedly on the suspended iron chain bridge, the iron pillar actually传导出 thunder that fell into the Thunderfire Pool. The electricity diffusing in the air instantly made Fu Jin's hair and beard stand on end.

His entire body went rigid, his feet slipped, and he was about to tumble into the fire pool below when Xu Yunfan grabbed Fu Jin's arm in reverse, standing steadily.

"Good小子!"

Fu Jin came to his senses, looking at Xu Yunfan, who stood motionless on the swaying iron chain bridge, with complete surprise.

"Excellent lightness skill."

Xu Yunfan grinned. "It just so happens that the sinew-refining technique I cultivate is a lightness skill."

He looked down at the only platform below. The surrounding temperature was so high it made him feel somewhat unbearably hot and dry. However, Zhan Yan, standing bare-chested on the platform, seemed completely oblivious.

Zhan Yan's fierce shout exploded on the forging platform of the Thunderfire Pool, echoing throughout the cavern.

"Lift the hammer!"

His spine was taut like a bowstring. Amidst the exhaustion on his face was a peculiar kind of excitement. The玄铁火钳 in his hand held a hammer handle that actually showed frost patterns. The hammer head was a streamlined cone. Between the twelve spiral forging patterns, one could see the unique silver spots of meteoric iron. What was even more astonishing was that the hammer face was densely covered with dragon-scale-shaped grooves. Whenever molten rock from the surging Thunderfire Pool splashed onto it, it would spark青紫色电芒.

By the time Fu Jin reached the forging platform, Zhan Yan had just grasped this heavy hammer.

"Three hundred forty-eight catties and seven taels."

Zhan Yan swung the hammer with a flourish. The hammer head suddenly shot out an invisible force. As it破空, it actually cleaved a trench in the molten iron three zhang away. He held it lovingly, his expression filled with irrepressible joy.

After a good while, he said to Xu Yunfan, "You came at just the right time. This Treasure Artifact has just left the furnace. The handle is six chi and three cun long, with seven meteoric iron beads inside to balance the center of gravity."

As he pressed the mechanism at the end of the hammer handle with his fingers, the entire war hammer suddenly disassembled into three sections of a chain hammer. The fine steel chain shimmered with a dark blue light amidst the firelight.
