# Chapter 23: Spiritual Plants

Li Shiming took out a whole bag of spiritual rice seeds at once. Instead of conducting small-scale experiments first, he directly used half of his seed stock in one go.

With extensive knowledge of soilless rice cultivation techniques and near-omnipotent perception with micron-level control within his computational space, failure wasn't an option. If this attempt failed, he had no alternative methods for growing spiritual rice in the short term.

Each passing day saw his body accumulating more contamination from mundane food. He needed to cultivate a batch of spiritual rice quickly to resolve this pressing issue.

The spiritual rice seeds were placed in a specially formulated nutrient solution—a seedling culture medium prepared according to optimal ratios. His consciousness remained focused on the seeds, not daring to relax for even a moment.

Within the nutrient solution, the seeds began absorbing nutrients. Their embryonic sprouts swelled inside the seed coats. Yet Li Shiming sensed their struggle—left unchecked, these sprouts might never break through their shells, preventing proper seedling formation.

Channeling spiritual energy from his body, Li Shiming visualized the Spring Breeze and Nourishing Rain technique's runes within his computational space. As thought translated to spell, dark clouds materialized overhead.

A spiritual rain showered across twenty square meters. Every drop was meticulously captured by his consciousness and directed into the seedling solution at the cultivation layer's base.

Infused with this magical rain, the spiritual rice seeds burst with vitality. Embryonic sprouts broke through their shells one after another. While observing these changes, Li Shiming simultaneously recorded data into the IBM z15 mainframe server.

The Spring Breeze and Nourishing Rain technique saturated the nutrient solution with spiritually enriched water. Unlike conventional methods where most rainwater would be absorbed by soil, Li Shiming's zero-waste collection system ensured maximum efficiency—every drop benefited the plants.

This represented a fundamental departure from traditional spiritual farming. For countless generations, cultivation had been inseparable from soil—an ingrained mindset no spiritual farmer had ever questioned. Without comprehensive understanding of plant nutrition spanning botany and chemistry, soilless cultivation remained unimaginable in this world.

The technological achievements stored in his IBM z15's database represented centuries of cumulative scientific progress from his previous life. Here, spiritual rice seedlings grew rapidly. After two days, they were transplanted to the four-tiered cultivation racks above.

To cast the Spring Breeze and Nourishing Rain technique repeatedly, Li Shiming drew upon the computational space's limited spiritual energy, replenishing his reserves through the Five Elements Absorption Method. He strictly minimized consumption—ceasing energy absorption the moment his spiritual power recovered.

Spiritual plants inherently required energy-rich environments. Fortunately, soilless techniques multiplied the rain technique's effectiveness, drastically reducing both casting frequency and energy expenditure. He deliberately avoided learning two other spiritual farming spells—the Metal Severing Technique and Earth Spirit Technique—to conserve energy.

The Metal Severing Technique exterminated spiritual pests—microscopic yet destructive organisms resistant to conventional pesticides. The Earth Spirit Technique replenished spiritual fields between growing seasons. Neither was necessary: his soilless system eliminated the need for field maintenance, and his computational space's sterile environment precluded pest infestations. His consciousness alone sufficed for any microscopic intervention.

Under his meticulous care, the spiritual rice plants thrived. He optimized light quality, intensity, photoperiods, and nutritional factors to maximize photosynthetic efficiency—inducing early flowering and accelerating growth to dramatically shorten the cultivation cycle.

Traditional spiritual rice required sixty days to mature. In his computational space, plants received continuous photosynthesis across twelve daily hours. Precise adjustments to LED lighting maintained ideal growing conditions. After just twenty-five days, the plants reached maturity.

Remarkably, the cultivation process didn't deplete the space's spiritual energy—it actually increased slightly. Each plant's photosynthesis generated trace amounts of spiritual energy. Across seventy square meters of four-tiered cultivation racks, this accumulated into perceptible concentration gains—enough to offset daily rain technique expenditures. After twenty-five days, the space's spiritual energy density had risen rather than fallen.

Though insufficient for personal cultivation, this self-sustaining cycle perfectly served his farming needs. Throughout this period, Li Shiming maintained seclusion in his study—ostensibly preparing for imperial examinations. His father, Li Wenyuan, had issued strict orders against disturbances.

Today marked the culmination of twenty-five days' labor—countless sleepless nights with consciousness devoted to monitoring growth. Success manifested in golden stalks heavy with grain. The joy of harvest thrilled him.

A month of reduced food intake had left his body laden with impurities. Spiritual rice represented liberation—a return to the pristine clarity he'd experienced before. His current contaminated state introduced spiritual sluggishness; prolonged deterioration might eventually impede energy manipulation entirely.
