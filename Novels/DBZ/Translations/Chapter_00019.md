# Chapter 19: The Current State of the Li Family

Li Wanqing wasn't one to beat around the bush. As soon as Wei Qian arrived, he got straight to the point:

"I'm preparing for an extended period of seclusion. During this time, you'll be responsible for tending to the remaining spiritual peach trees in the orchard."

"Any remaining fruits and profits from the trees will be handled by you and Steward Fu together."

"If any problems arise in the orchard, unless they're particularly serious, handle them yourself and don't disturb me," Li Wanqing said solemnly.

A flurry of thoughts raced through Wei Qian's mind, but all he said was a simple "Understood."

Only after leaving Li Wanqing's cave abode did Wei Qian allow himself to revisit the thoughts he'd suppressed earlier.

"Li Wanqing only recently broke through to the ninth level of Qi Refinement. Why is he rushing into seclusion again? And with such formality too."

The path of cultivation wasn't something one could succeed at through sheer stubborn persistence.

One needed to understand the balance between tension and relaxation.

Even Wei Qian sometimes forced himself to pause and rest.

"Could it be...?" He recalled a certain rumor.

This rumor was connected to the auction incident from two years ago.

That auction had been interrupted halfway by an attack from demonic cultivators, not only causing it to fail but also claiming many cultivators' lives.

The heavy losses suffered by rogue cultivators were expected.

But many clan cultivators had also perished.

To appease these cultivation families, the Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan had decided to refine an additional batch of Foundation Establishment Pills in recent years, selling them at standard prices to the cultivation families who had participated in that auction.

The Alchemy Cauldron Xiao Clan was a behemoth with a third-grade alchemist in residence.

Between their own production and commissioned orders, they'd refined countless batches of Foundation Establishment Pills, with an astonishing success rate.

They guaranteed at least three Foundation Establishment Pills per batch, with exceptional performances yielding up to five.

Adding the three unsold pills from the auction, that made six Foundation Establishment Pills available for purchase.

This was undoubtedly good news for the Li Immortal Clan.

They stood a good chance of acquiring one.

No wonder Li Wanqing was in such a hurry to enter seclusion. If he could advance his cultivation further before these pills were ready, given his status, any Foundation Establishment Pill the family acquired would likely go to him.

After all, Li Wanqing had managed to stand among the older generation of "Lu"-named elders despite belonging to the "Wan" generation—all thanks to his alchemy skills and his status as a top-grade first-rank alchemist!

"Aligning myself with Li Wanqing's faction has really paid off. His family has been thriving these past two years."

In these two years, it wasn't just Wei Qian who had progressed. That kid Li Guchen had also advanced from the fifth to the sixth level of Qi Refinement.

"But Clan Leader Li Wanlong also stands a good chance of obtaining this Foundation Establishment Pill."

When Wei Qian first met Li Wanlong, the man had already been at the ninth level of Qi Refinement. After all these years, it would be normal for him to reach Great Perfection of Qi Refinement.

The Li Family's most pressing matter was to produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator before their ancestor passed away.

Considering this, if they managed to acquire a Foundation Establishment Pill, there was a significant chance it would go to Li Wanlong.

Moreover, Li Wanlong's daughter Li Caiwei had proven more promising than Li Guchen!

About a year and a half ago, Li Caiwei had been discovered to possess remarkable talent in the Dao of Formations, one of the Hundred Arts of Cultivation.

This had even startled the Li Family's Foundation Establishment ancestor, who considered sending Li Caiwei to join the renowned "Myriad Forms Formation Sect," a major sect specializing in formation arts.

However, as this sect was located not in the Zhao Kingdom but in the foreign land of Xin Country—millions of miles from Misty Ridge Mountain—the plan was ultimately abandoned.

"Whether the Li Family can acquire a Foundation Establishment Pill, who they give it to if they do, or whether they successfully produce another Foundation Establishment cultivator—none of that really concerns me."

"What does concern me is that my 'Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art' has reached a bottleneck. Figuring out how to break through this quickly is what I need to focus on."

Using the [Wishing Dragon Pearl], he'd determined that breaking through this bottleneck would require 388 days of cultivation—just over a year.

Under normal circumstances, this wouldn't be an issue.

But now, Wei Qian had to consider one thing:

Would the Li Family take him along when they went to purchase the Foundation Establishment Pill?

This wasn't an idle speculation.

Because Wei Qian had survived the auction incident, other cultivators viewed him as someone blessed with good fortune.

In this world, while mortals might be superstitious, cultivators were even more so!

Over these past two years, limited by his background as a rogue cultivator and lack of knowledge, Wei Qian had purchased a large collection of miscellaneous books through Bai Fugui to educate himself.

Coincidentally, he'd come across an example:

A certain cultivator who studied divination would only choose one auspicious day each month to venture out.

It was said that when his father passed away, the funeral day wasn't auspicious, so despite all persuasions, the cultivator adamantly refused to attend his own father's funeral.

Thus, Wei Qian wondered: when the Li Family went to purchase the Foundation Establishment Pill, would they insist on bringing him along for good luck?

He made a wish with the [Wishing Dragon Pearl], wishing to remain safely on Misty Ridge Mountain for the next three years.

The pearl's feedback indicated this wish would require over two thousand days to fulfill!

"Nearly six years of wishing time just to avoid going—this must be the decision of the Li Family's Foundation Establishment ancestor."

Knowing he'd likely be sent out, all Wei Qian could do now was do everything possible to strengthen his survival capabilities.

A crucial part of this was advancing his 'Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art' to the Minor Achievement realm, equivalent to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement for body cultivators.

"According to the 'Thousand Tribulations Body Forging Art,' medicinal baths can accelerate progress. It seems I need to gather the necessary herbs," Wei Qian thought to himself.

He could also take this opportunity to collect more potent poisons, venoms, and toxic materials.

Wei Qian hadn't forgotten how effective his poisoned spike artifact had been last time.

This time, with stronger poisons combined with the power of wishes, he might be able to create a super-toxin capable of instantly killing late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators!

That would significantly improve his safety.

Surely he wouldn't encounter another unknown Golden Core cultivator this time?

"Before officially setting out, I should also make a wish to assess the level of danger."

If it required thousands or even tens of thousands of days to ensure safety, Wei Qian wouldn't hesitate to flee the Li Family immediately.

He wasn't the type to "know there are tigers in the mountains yet insist on traveling through them."

"I should contact Fat Bai first. Maybe I can get everything I need from him." Wei Qian still had a favorable impression of Bai Fugui.

Over these two years, they'd completed three more transactions, all satisfactory.
