# Chapter 581: The Hundred Desires Peak's Cultivation Method is Truly Excellent

"Speak, and I will grant you a swift end, sparing you the agony of soul-searching and soul-refining. Or perhaps, I might even spare your life."

The Heavenly Empress, her Sea of Consciousness gravely injured and violently assaulted, trembled violently. Pain and fury burned in her eyes like tangible flames.

She clenched her teeth, more blood trickling from the corners of her mouth, yet she refused to utter a single word.

As the Mother of the Heavenly Court, she knew that the Hidden Dao Fruit was the last spark of hope for this world. Even if her soul perished and her body was devoured by ten thousand demons, she could never reveal it.

Furthermore, the Will of the Heavenly Dao screamed a silent warning within her remaining consciousness.

These Outer Realm Demons had come specifically to devour this world.

Xu Yunfan wasn't surprised by this reaction. It was extremely difficult to pry the core secret regarding the survival of an entire world from such a figure.

He was just about to speak when, at that moment, a desperate roar that shook the entire Heavenly Realm and made all laws of creation tremble and mourn came from the distant sky.

It was the voice of the Heavenly Emperor.

Immediately after, followed the calm, ancient, yet supremely majestic command of the Universal Salvation True Lord.

"Suppress."

*BOOM!!!*

An explosion of light, as if all the stars in the firmament had shattered simultaneously, bloomed across the sky.

The Judgment Greatsword of the Qingyuan True Lord, the Formless Sword Qi of the Dongxu True Lord, and the crushing pressure of the Universal Salvation True Lord's Dao Realm projection—the combined force of the three completely shattered the resplendent, pure light that symbolized the existence of the Heavenly Emperor.

Illusions of法则锁链 (law chains) breaking apart filled heaven and earth.

The Heavenly Dao let out a sharp, piercing wail for the fall of a True Lord.

Heaven Weeps!

The Heavenly Emperor has fallen!

The shockwave swept through the Six Harmonies and Eight Wastes. Even here by the remote Heavenly River, one could feel the violent tremors. The fine temporal rifts on the Star Sand Shoal suddenly multiplied.

The Heavenly Empress's body trembled violently as she spat out a large mouthful of golden blood mixed with fragments of her primordial law. The last light in her eyes, along with the fall of the Heavenly Emperor, was completely extinguished, leaving only a gray, deathly stillness.

Her luck and fate were completely tied to the Heavenly Emperor. At this moment, she truly felt the sorrow of sharing his death.

However, Xu Yunfan's gaze suddenly turned sharp as a hawk's, filled only with excitement.

How good it is that he died!

But then, Xu Yunfan slapped his own thigh hard.

With the Heavenly Emperor dead, the True Lords would soon turn their attention to the Western Buddha Head and the complete plunder of this world.

The concealment of that Hidden Dao Fruit would be greatly reduced.

Time was truly pressing.

There was not a shred of pity in his eyes, only the habitual emotion of a Primordial Origin Sect cultivator who would stop at nothing for the Great Dao.

The cold smile on Xu Yunfan's face instantly widened, carrying a hint of nearly evil mockery. His voice was low, like a devil's whisper.

"Very well! You are stubborn, and I like a fiery temperament. So, Your Majesty, as the Empress of the Heavenly Realm, your vision is limited to the sorrow of just the Heavenly Emperor's fall? If that is the case..."

His fingers gripping the Heavenly Empress's wrist tightened, his fingertips nearly sinking into her tender skin. His other hand rose, seemingly to tear the already tattered palace gown and rainbow dress she wore.

"Then let Your Majesty also experience the might of my Primordial Origin Sect's Hundred Desires Peak's *True Scripture of Yin-Yang Union and Separation in the Exchange of Heaven and Earth*."

"Taste what it's like to have your divine body defiled by Outer Realm Demons, your soul's origin drained, until you are squeezed dry into an exquisite furnace vessel! Surely Your Majesty has never experienced this with that proper Heavenly Emperor."

"This Lord will now fulfill your wish to be a true woman for once."

His voice wasn't loud, but each word was like a poisoned dagger, ruthlessly stabbing into the Empress's most fragile self-esteem and deepest fears.

"By the way..."

A cruel playfulness colored Xu Yunfan's smile as his fingers suddenly exerted force. With a *tearing* sound, the tattered rainbow palace gown ripped apart under his immense strength, revealing the skin beneath, stained with dark golden divine blood yet as smooth as congealed cream, marked with glaring bruises and gashes.

The curves of her jade-white figure, outlined by the shattered star sand and residual bloodstains, presented a凄厉 (miserable) and breathtaking fragile beauty.

"It seems Your Majesty is determined to witness the Primordial Origin Sect's Hundred Desires Peak's *True Scripture of Yin-Yang Union and Separation in the Exchange of Heaven and Earth*. Very well, this Lord shall personally teach you what true divine and wondrous methods are. Let's not disappoint Your Majesty."

Before the words had fully faded, Xu Yunfan's immense magical power, without the slightest reservation, violently surged into the Heavenly Empress's ravaged body.

How it was done is not detailed here, omitting ten thousand words...

"Ugh!"

The Heavenly Empress's body arched as if struck by lightning, a broken sob catching in her throat.

The surging magical power was not nourishing, but carried the overbearing, plundering intent of the Hundred Desires true transmission.

The *True Scripture of Yin-Yang Union and Separation in the Exchange of Heaven and Earth* was the peak treasure canon of the Hundred Desires Peak, a side branch of the Primordial Origin Sect. It did not merely seduce with lust; its core was to manipulate the changes of Yin-Yang union and separation, forcibly reversing auras, and drawing out the other's primordial power and soul essence to use as nourishment, either for forcible plunder or to cultivate oneself by refining them into a furnace vessel.

What Xu Yunfan was using now was the most brutal method of "Origin-Stealing and Soul-Refining," used for interrogation and torture.

Invisible Dao patterns spread from Xu Yunfan, instantly enveloping the Heavenly Empress.

While practicing dual cultivation, Xu Yunfan pointed a finger at her body. She felt a chilling and scorching sensation entwine, an endless agony like millions of fine needles stabbing her soul, or countless vortices tearing at her organs, erupting from her four limbs and hundred bones, from her marrow sea and purple mansion.

This pain far surpassed any Dao injury she had ever experienced in the past, penetrating to the origin of her soul and reaching her true spirit imprint.

"Ah!!"

A blood-curdling, world-shaking scream finally could not be suppressed and burst from the Heavenly Empress's mouth. Her long, swan-like neck arched back violently, blue veins bulging. Her peerless face was twisted and deformed by the ultimate agony.

Even more terrifying was that the诡异 (bizarre) magical power circulated within her, forcibly牵引 (pulling) the foundation of her Immortal Dao, which she had cultivated to great perfection, and the primordial power containing the luck of the Heavenly Court. It was like a red-hot branding iron plunged into ice water.

The two violently clashed and collided, erupting in tearing conflict, yet were pushed by the force of Yin-Yang Dao power, forcibly separating and uniting.

It transformed into streams of chaotic, disorderly, and violently uncontrolled energy, which in turn surged through her remaining meridians and Sea of Consciousness, doubling the torment on her soul.

Her consciousness drifted in a boundless sea of suffering. The last of her cold and noble will, under the assault of this peerless demonic technique targeting the soul and origin, was like a candle flame in a storm, flickering on the verge of extinction.

Humiliation, agony, the fear of imminent annihilation, and the despair of having her once world-dominating dignity trampled into the mud instantly overwhelmed the last of her mental barriers.

"Speak!"

Xu Yunfan's voice was flat, yet under the *True Scripture of Yin-Yang Union and Separation in the Exchange of Heaven and Earth*, it carried a soul-corroding demonic sound that poured into her chaotic Sea of Consciousness. The last glimmer of clarity in her dilated pupils completely dissipated.

"How does one obtain the Hidden Dao Fruit? Where is the Dao Fruit of the Grand Yin Black Mirror hidden?"
