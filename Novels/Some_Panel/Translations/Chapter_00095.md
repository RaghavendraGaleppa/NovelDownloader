**Chapter 94: The Auction**

“I am Bai Bi’er of the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance. Fellow Daoist Yang, please feel free to ask if you have any needs this time.” The white-robed woman smiled sweetly.

“Fellow Daoist Bai, please be seated.” Yang Ji appraised her, finding her temperament extraordinary and quite remarkable. After she took her seat, he asked curiously, “Fellow Daoist Bai, may I ask when I became a VIP of your Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance? If I recall correctly, this is my first visit.”

Bai Bi’er looked at Yang Ji, a smile playing on her lips. “Fellow Daoist Yang is a successor of the True Eastern Demonic Emperor. Who doesn’t know that? A disciple like you, highly regarded by the sect’s high-ranking figures – who wouldn’t know? Such an identity is certainly enough to make you a VIP of our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance.”

She giggled. “Does Fellow Daoist Yang not realize that you’ve already become a prominent figure?”

“So that’s how it is.” Yang Ji nodded, feeling quite surprised. Firstly, he was surprised that his identity could warrant such special treatment from a power like the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance. Secondly, he marveled at their formidable information-gathering capabilities. There were only a few people at the Hellish Training Ground back then, yet the news reached the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance in such a short time. He had to admit, the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance truly possessed some impressive methods and audacity.

“My Lord, this Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance is really good; your Buddha Child likes it. If I become a mighty being in the future, I’ll definitely come here to show off my power,” Buddha Child transmitted with a chuckled.

The Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance truly handled their business in a way that made one feel utterly comfortable. Such exceptional treatment put Yang Ji in a remarkably good mood. It seemed having a "reputation" had its benefits. Yang Ji hadn't expected to be considered a prominent figure in others' eyes.

“Fellow Daoist, please tell me anything you need during this visit. Our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance sells everything: magic treasures, divine abilities, pills, materials, talismans, and even information!” Bai Bi’er said.

Yang Ji got straight to the point: “Does your alliance sell spiritual items that can enhance root bones? Also, do you have top-grade materials for forging Dao artifacts?”

“To be frank, spiritual items that enhance root bones are extremely sought after in all major worlds. We do sell ordinary spiritual items, but those heaven-defying ones capable of raising root bones to supreme-grade or even transforming them into spirit bodies are exceptionally rare. We don’t have any here at the moment.”

“However, they can be found, but it will take some time. If Fellow Daoist Yang has such a need, our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance will naturally mobilize our human resources to collect them from across the myriad realms, prioritizing your requirements,” Bai Bi’er said with a smile.

“Your Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance is willing to mobilize such significant resources for me?” Yang Ji’s eyes flashed. He still had a clear understanding of himself; he didn’t believe his influence was so great as to make such a large merchant alliance revolve around his needs.

“Our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance boasts interconnected information and integrated resources, operating under a perfected system. If such a spiritual item is discovered anywhere, we only need to transmit a message and have it transferred, requiring no major mobilization of personnel,” Bai Bi’er explained with a smile. “Of course, the needs of a genius like Fellow Daoist Yang are worth our attention and consideration. Our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance traverses the myriad heavens and realms, and we particularly enjoy dealing with geniuses.”

Yang Ji nodded. Even the Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance didn't currently possess high-grade spiritual items for enhancing root bones, which left a hint of disappointment in his heart.

“Then, do you have top-grade materials for forging Dao artifacts?” he asked again.

“Such materials are rare and depend on fate, but Fellow Daoist, you’ve come at just the right time. Tonight, our trade house is holding an auction, and among the items being auctioned is a piece of Titanium White Essence Gold, which can be used to forge a high-grade Dao artifact. As a VIP, Fellow Daoist can participate directly from your room via the Light-Shadow Stone,” Bai Bi’er replied.

“Titanium White Essence Gold?” Yang Ji’s eyes lit up, instantly piqued. “Excellent, I’ll wait for tonight’s auction then.”

He glanced at Bai Bi’er and added, “Fellow Daoist, please go attend to your duties for now. If I need anything else, I’ll call for you.”

“Understood. Fellow Daoist Yang simply needs to press the white jade stone on the left wall, and I will come at once,” Bai Bi’er said, gesturing towards the white jade gem on the wall, before rising and leaving the private room.

Time passed quickly.

Night fell.

The large Light-Shadow Stone in the room lit up, revealing a scene within. It was a lower-level platform, where an old man stood. Around him, on seats higher than the platform, numerous cultivators were now seated.

Yang Ji looked down at this scene from above, a sudden sense of superiority as a genius arising within him. He once again felt the advantages of being a genius. If not for this, he would have been one of the clamoring crowd below.

Soon, the old man on the platform spoke with a smile, “It’s about time, and everyone has arrived. Before the auction begins, I want to make one special declaration.”

“All items auctioned tonight have been strictly inspected and appraised by our Myriad Realms Merchant Alliance, confirmed to be authentic and without any falsification. Everyone can bid with confidence.”

“If there are no objections, I won’t waste any more words. Tonight’s auction officially begins now.”

“The first item up for auction is the Black Silkworm Treasure Robe, a low-grade magic treasure.”

A small stone platform suddenly rose in front of the old man, holding a brocade box. As soon as the lid opened, a burst of lustrous treasure light shone forth. Everyone fixed their gaze, seeing a black robe within the box, its spiritual light flowing. It was clearly a rare and valuable item.

“This Black Silkworm Treasure Robe is woven from the silk of a Demon Emperor-level black silkworm. Swords and blades below mid-grade magic treasures cannot cut through it. It is light, yet incredibly tough, making it a truly rare treasure.”

“The starting bid is one hundred thousand Heavenly Spirit Pills, with each subsequent bid increasing by ten thousand Heavenly Spirit Pills,” the old man announced.

Yang Ji knew about Heavenly Spirit Pills. Their medicinal potency was similar to Demonic Core Pills. A cultivator with low-grade root bones could gain roughly 80 cultivation points per day from them. Within the Dao Sect, cultivators from early Foundation Establishment to peak Foundation Establishment received this type of pill.

One hundred thousand pills! That was equivalent to a thousand Golden Core-level demon beasts slaughtered and refined into pills. This was truly astounding. Such a quantity of pills would be enough for the Azure Waves Sect to cultivate for many years. Only on the Cultivation Continent, with its abundant spiritual lands and countless treasures, could spiritual herbs be cultivated in such large quantities and pills refined so profusely, allowing for such extravagance.

However, compared to the Heavenly Spirit Pills, a treasure robe made from special materials seemed incredibly cheap. Indeed, what is rare and useful becomes precious and can command a high price. Of course, this only applied to pills that primarily aided cultivation speed. If it were pills with immensely greater uses, like Immortal Ascension Pills or Enlightenment Pills, then even ten magic treasures might not be enough to exchange for them. Truly, desirability dictates its worth.

One hundred thousand Heavenly Spirit Pills was enough to supply many cultivators’ needs, a truly massive sum. As expected, the old man’s opening bid immediately suppressed many eager cultivators.

Yet, several cultivators with robust financial backing calmly stated, “One hundred and ten thousand.”

“One hundred and twenty thousand,” a deep voice suddenly resounded.

“One hundred and thirty thousand.” The initial voice remained calm, seemingly not even batting an eye, displaying immense wealth.

“One hundred and forty thousand.” Still, others, unwilling to be outdone, called out a higher price.

“One hundred and fifty thousand.” The initial bidder calmly called out again.

Finally, no one else spoke, and the first item, the Black Silkworm Treasure Robe, was sold for a high price of one hundred and fifty thousand.

Yang Ji was astonished. One hundred and fifty thousand Heavenly Spirit Pills! This wasn't one hundred and fifty thousand low-grade spirit stones. These people truly had vast resources. However, considering that spiritual herbs could be cultivated while some materials were hard to find, he felt enlightened. Indeed, scarcity dictates value.
