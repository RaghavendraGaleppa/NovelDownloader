# Chapter 72: Conclusion

Though Li Shiming had witnessed the cruelty of the cultivation world many times before, seeing the young boys he'd spent days with reduced to cold corpses made him deeply feel the malice pervading this world.

He hadn't interacted much with these youths and thus felt no profound grief, but a sense of mourning for fellow victims overwhelmed him. 

"Isn't that Jin Shufeng?" He recognized one of the corpses.

All previous schemes had become laughable jokes in the face of absolute power. Without matching strength, survival meant keeping a low profile.

As Li Shiming contemplated this, he collected the body of the Profound Nether Sect's Qi Refining cultivator into his storage pouch. During this process, he noticed Elder Cui hadn't taken the deceased's storage bag.

He removed the storage bag and hung it at his waist, intending to return it to Elder Cui later.

After completing these tasks, he began arranging the young disciples' bodies, lining them up neatly and reassembling any missing parts. His efficient movements caught the attention of the surviving boys gathered nearby.

Jin Fengzhi was the first to stand up, her face pale as she began helping move bodies. Three other boys soon joined, while the remaining five remained frozen in fear.

Li Shiming said nothing. These youths, aged twelve to seventeen, had been well-protected by the Great Xia Kingdom. Having never faced danger before, their fearful reaction was understandable. Yet if they couldn't overcome this trauma, they would achieve little even after entering the sect.

Twenty-one corpses now lay arranged on the first floor. Despite being properly arranged, their final expressions of terror, fear, and unwillingness remained frozen on their faces, creating an oppressive atmosphere that kept the surviving boys sitting far away.

Li Shiming sat beside the corpses—not because he was particularly brave, but because he sought to temper himself through this experience. This was the path he'd chosen; to pursue immortality meant contending with such realities. 

He vowed to himself: Be cautious. Survive. Or end up like these twenty-one lifeless youths.

The first floor remained silent until Elders Zhao, Dai, and Cui entered.

"Ai!" Elders Zhao and Dai sighed softly upon seeing the arranged corpses. These youths had represented five years' worth of cultivation seeds for their sect, now more than half gone.

Their gazes swept over the ten survivors. Li Shiming's composure reassured them once more. Though his early cultivation played a role, it also reflected his formidable willpower.

Of the other nine, four seemed relatively stable, while the remaining five might never fully recover.

Elder Zhao approached the corpses and with a wave of his hand, stored them all in his storage pouch. While there was no need to return them to their families, proper handling was essential—most sect cultivators came from similar backgrounds, and their sentiments needed consideration.

"Rest well. Here are nine calming pills—take one each," Elder Zhao instructed, producing a porcelain bottle and distributing pills to the nine boys.

They obediently swallowed the pills and fell asleep within moments.

"Li Shiming, come rest on the second floor," Elder Zhao beckoned.

As Li Shiming felt the flying boat lift off, he couldn't help but ask, "Elder Ma and Elder Wu—" He stopped mid-sentence, realizing what their absence meant. Unlike the twenty-one boys, he'd developed genuine friendships with both elders during the voyage.

"They fell in battle," Elder Zhao said with a shake of his head.

The three elders ascended to the second floor, with Li Shiming following silently behind.

Compared to the first floor, the second level bore more intricate patterns on its surface, and spiritual energy density had multiplied.

"What a shame we couldn't keep Jiang Bing today," Elder Dai said bitterly after sitting down.

"Elder Cui's sword strike wounded Jiang Bing severely. If not for that Iron Corpse protecting him, we would have kept him there. Even so, Jiang Bing won't reappear for years," Elder Zhao replied with a smile.

"It was only possible because you two trapped him first, otherwise how could my strike have landed so easily?" Elder Cui said modestly.

The three Foundation Establishment cultivators adjusted quickly—or perhaps, accustomed to life and death, they knew how to control their emotions. By the time they reached the second floor, no trace of sorrow remained visible.

Li Shiming marveled inwardly at Jiang Bing's formidable strength—to hold his own against two opponents and still escape Elder Cui's ambush. He didn't know Elders Zhao and Dai's exact capabilities, but having witnessed Elder Cui's devastating sword strike—the most powerful attack he'd ever seen—he could only imagine how fearsome Jiang Bing must be.

"Li Shiming, you've rendered great service this time. The sect will reward you, and I personally owe you a debt. Once you've settled in, you may make one request of me," Elder Zhao said with a smile.

From Elder Cui, he'd learned that Li Shiming had single-handedly lured away a Profound Nether Sect Qi Refining cultivator—a near-suicidal act given the disparity in their cultivation levels. Yet this very action had allowed Elder Cui to arrive in time to save the nine remaining boys, preventing total annihilation.

Had all perished, Elder Zhao would have faced both sect punishment and peer condemnation upon return. He wasn't worried about Li Shiming abusing this promise—the boy's intelligence ensured any request would be reasonable, and Foundation Establishment cultivators could easily fulfill most Qi Refining stage needs.

"Count me in. You may make one request of me as well," Elder Dai added.

Both elders took this seriously. Had they demanded immediate requests, Li Shiming's limited knowledge might have led to undervalued rewards. By having him wait until familiar with the sect, they ensured proper compensation for his contribution.

Foundation Establishment cultivators had their pride—neither would compromise when fulfilling a Qi Refining disciple's request.

"My thanks to both elders," Li Shiming bowed deeply.

"You've earned it," Elder Zhao said warmly.

"Elder Cui, this storage bag belongs to the Profound Nether Sect cultivator you killed," Li Shiming said, presenting the bag at his waist.

"Keep it. I trust your judgment—just don't study the Profound Nether Sect's techniques. They corrupt one's nature, breeding bloodlust and slaughter," Elder Cui waved dismissively.
