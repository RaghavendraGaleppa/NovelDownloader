# Chapter 31: A Grand Unison

“Brothers, kill! Don’t let a single Mo family member escape!”

The first to shout this was surprisingly someone from within the market city. He had donned a black robe at some unknown point, his eyes gleaming with excitement as he charged towards the Mo family compound.

With someone taking the lead, countless black-robed figures suddenly emerged from the streets and alleys, all rushing towards the Mo family. The genuine Black Robe Society rogue cultivators outside the market city were momentarily stunned. Had their leader arranged for so many inside agents?

“Kill!”

With a thunderous roar, the Black Robe Society members also charged in, slaughtering indiscriminately.

“Go!” Old Man Xu was as anxious as an ant on a hot pan.

“No rush, wait a little longer!” Lu Xu held him back, remarkably calm.

They used aura-concealing talismans to hide their presence, waiting quietly in a small building. The Black Robe Society members, having surged in from outside the market city, quickly passed their area, heading towards the Mo family compound in the center of the market.

“Go!”

At this moment, Lu Xu let out a low cry, his figure shooting out. He had already donned a bronze mask at some unknown time, completely altering his appearance. Old Man Zhang, with his grandson, also rushed out. The two chose different directions, splitting up to escape. Red Maple Alley, where they were located, was itself on the edge of the market city, so escaping didn’t require flying far.

They encountered no obstacles along the way. The true experts had all rushed towards the Mo family. As soon as Lu Xu revealed his fourth-layer Qi Condensation aura, no one dared to provoke him. He successfully flew out of the market city.

From the Mo family compound, intense sounds of battle resonated, with various colored lights shooting skyward. A total of four to five hundred people were besieging the Mo family, far exceeding the number of Black Robe Society members. Lu Xu even saw some white-haired old men, at the third layer of Qi Condensation, clad in black robes, their eyes filled with excitement, manipulating low-grade magical artifacts as they charged towards the Mo family.

“Old Man Zhang?!”

He turned his head again and saw Old Man Zhang, with dark skin, a slight hunchback, and a face full of deep wrinkles, wielding a glowing spiritual hoe as he charged towards the Mo family. Even the spiritual farmers had come out!

“All heroes are joining this grand occasion!”

“Fight, fight! Just fight! Fight until the heavens turn upside down, that’s when I can leave this place!”

Such thoughts flashed through Lu Xu’s mind. He mounted his Azure Glow Sword and, with a *whoosh*, flew into the distance without a hint of reluctance.

*Boom!*

From the Mo family’s side, waves of powerful fluctuations erupted. Two Foundation Establishment cultivators had clashed, and an unknown number of people in the vicinity died without even a whimper, caught in the aftermath.

The Mo family cultivators were fleeing outwards in droves; they had little will to fight. It was clear that the Mo family was finished; staying here would only mean burying themselves with it. As long as the green mountains remain, there’s no need to worry about firewood. As long as they could escape, there was still hope for rebuilding the Mo family in the future.

Despite many people trying to block them, quite a few Mo family experts broke through the layers of defense, transforming into streaks of light as they burst out. But immediately, others pursued them. Everyone knew that many of the Mo family’s treasures might be on these escaping cultivators. Thus, behind every fleeing figure, three or four figures simultaneously followed.

*Whoosh!*

Lu Xu flew over the mortal town below, seeing it was already in ruins, with rubble and broken walls everywhere. Many mortals wailed and wept in front of their ruined homes. Buried beneath the debris were their relatives, friends, parents, wives, and children. A father held two blood-dripping bags in his hands; one contained his child, the other also contained his child. In the face of cultivators’ immense power, their fate could only be described as pathetic.

They were, in fact, collateral damage. The Black Robe Society only wanted to kill a few thousand people as material for attacking the grand formation. Of course, they also considered massacring all these mortals for a blood sacrifice, but that was only if the market city’s grand formation couldn’t be breached. They had no interest in destroying mortal homes; doing so would only waste their magical power. However, many rogue cultivators who hadn't retreated into the market city had hidden in this town. Therefore, when the Black Robe Society searched, they engaged in fierce battles, turning the place into a wreck.

“How helpless! Weakness is the greatest sin!”

“I must become strong, stronger than everyone else!” Lu Xu secretly vowed in his heart.

After passing through the town, Lu Xu saw the forest again, and his speed unconsciously slowed.

*Whoosh! Whoosh!*

Several streaks of light behind him caught up, surpassed him, and plunged into the forest, quickly disappearing from view under its cover. Lu Xu slowly followed, finding no anomalies within the forest.

“It seems the Black Robe Society members truly all went to attack the Mo family!”

Lu Xu felt relieved and, mounting his Azure Glow Sword, plunged into the forest. Streaks of light shot across the sky, flying in all directions. In the midst of the chase and escape, a large number of Mo family disciples, rogue cultivators, and ordinary cultivators burst out of Qinghu Market City.

The market city instantly became deserted, with only a few people moving through the Mo family compound, scavenging for any valuable items the Mo family members might have left behind. In the sky, the two Foundation Establishment cultivators were still locked in fierce combat, but judging by the precarious state of the red light, it was clear that the Mo family patriarch wouldn't last much longer.

A powerful Mo family, just like that, was destroyed! Even if a portion of them managed to escape, it would likely be difficult for them to regain power. Who knew what fate awaited Qinghu Market City in the future?

“It has nothing to do with me anymore. Having escaped the Mo family’s cage, now the sky’s the limit for me!” Lu Xu thought to himself as he moved through the forest.

From time to time, *whoosh! whoosh!* streaks of light would flash overhead, each one emanating an incredibly powerful aura. Quite a number of people were fleeing in this direction. This made sense; fleeing in the other three directions would lead straight into the Myriad Monsters Mountain Range, where arrogantly flying on artifacts was no different from seeking death.

Lu Xu did not fly into the sky; doing so would make him easily dealt with by a passing late-stage Qi Condensation expert. He also didn't dare to use his Azure Wind Boat for flight, as it was too large and conspicuous a target, which would draw attention. He had to escape to a sufficient distance before using the Azure Wind Boat to leave at full speed. They were still too close to Qinghu Market City. Hiding below, flying with the concealment of the trees, was the safest option.

“Don’t let her go, she’s the Mo family patriarch’s granddaughter!”

“Young Miss Qingchan, why are you so loyal to the Mo family? You know what your father suffered in the Mo family, don’t you? Why not join our Black Robe Society? We can recommend you to the Thousand Extinctions Sect!”

“Silence! You scurrying rats, you’ll be wiped out sooner or later!”

A clear, cold voice sounded. Lu Xu looked up and saw a strikingly beautiful woman in a black dress, enveloped in a blue light, flying rapidly towards them from behind. It was Mo Qingchan! Behind her, six streaks of light pursued closely, each emitting an incredibly powerful aura.

“Damn it, what rotten luck!”

Lu Xu cursed inwardly at the sight. How did he end up on the same escape route as such a “big fish”? Continuing to fly would definitely lead to him being discovered. He quickly stopped and hid in the canopy of a large tree, slapping an aura-concealing talisman onto himself.

*Whoosh!*

Mo Qingchan sped past directly above him, and the several streaks of light behind her followed closely. It was unclear if any of the seven cultivators had noticed Lu Xu below. However, even if they had, it was unlikely anyone would have the leisure to bother with such small fry.

Lu Xu breathed a sigh of relief: “Good thing it didn’t turn into a melodramatic cliché!” He had almost thought he would be forced into a heroic rescue, but with his meager cultivation, he couldn't play the hero anyway.

Remounting his artifact, Lu Xu quickly changed direction and flew off towards another side.

Not long after, the Mo family market city behind him was no longer visible. The forest was also nearing its end. Lu Xu felt a sense of relief; he should be able to use the Azure Wind Boat to leave quickly now.

*Boom!*

At this moment, a rumble sounded in the distant sky behind him. Lu Xu quickly looked up and back, only to see a red light streaking across the horizon, with a black light in close pursuit. As the red light flew, it continuously activated talismans to attack the black light behind it.

Judging by their speeds, Lu Xu knew these were late-stage Qi Condensation experts, and they would soon catch up to him. Cursing inwardly, Lu Xu quickly stopped, slapped another aura-concealing talisman onto himself, and hid.

The two streaks of light flew over Lu Xu’s head about a dozen breaths later. They did not discover Lu Xu. This was the advantage of flying through the forest; Lu Xu could timely spot people in the sky, but those in the sky couldn't see him due to the dense forest cover. Of course, the trade-off was that flying through the forest was much slower than flying in the open sky.

However, this time, the two streaks of light did not fly off as quickly as Lu Xu had hoped. After flying about fifty to sixty zhang further, the red light in front suddenly stopped.

“Fellow Daoist, give up. You won’t be able to defeat this old man. Why don’t we both take a step back?”

A familiar voice echoed nearby. Lu Xu’s heart jumped. Wasn’t that the Mo family’s alchemy elder? If he remembered correctly, his name was Mo Changkong?

“Give up? Humph, give me your storage bag, and I’ll turn around and leave without another word!”

“Alas, then it seems there’s nothing more to say!”

*Bang!*

*Boom!*
