# Chapter 319: A Temporary Plan and the Art of Taming a Husband

Little Tuan was very young and knew nothing of the complexities of love. She watched the two of them, now good, now bad—sometimes drawing swords, sometimes whispering sweet nowords. Their expressions were different from each other, leaving her utterly confused.

Wen Cai-shang said, "Good Li Lang, if I wanted to kill you, you would have died long ago. You should know I cannot bear to kill you." Li Xian knew his life was safe, but didn't know whether to be happy or worried. The affection in Wen Cai-shang's words was true or false, he couldn't tell, but it was still somewhat comforting. He went along with it and said, "I also cannot bear to part with you, Madam."

Wen Cai-shang's expression softened slightly. She leaned against Li Xian and said, "Li Lang, it is rare that we have met. I have something for you." She flicked her sleeve. A Heaven and Earth Box appeared before the stone table.

Wen Cai-shang wanted Li Xian to fear her, be afraid of her, yet also lust for her and love her. She didn't want him to fear her too much or be too terrified of her. Just now, the accounts had been settled, so she immediately changed her attitude, preparing a sweet date in advance.

The Heaven and Earth Box was opened. Inside was a cluster of reddish-yellow light, like mist or rosy clouds, slowly surging. It was the Human Yellow Essence Treasure, "Morning Yellow Dew." Wen Cai-shang smiled and said, "I know you were planning to get this, to complete the Recipe for Golden Light. You... by sheer luck obtained the Yellow Nine Ginseng, just one step away. I specially prepared this small gift. Are you happy?"

Li Xian said, "I am happy, and also flattered." Wen Cai-shang said, "Go ahead and drink it. As for the Art of Golden Light... I have only heard of it, never seen it used. Everyone has their own destiny. You are fated with this technique."

Li Xian said, "Thank you, Madam."

Wen Cai-shang's beautiful face flushed red. She acted coquettishly and said, "You should thank me. After running away this time, you should have realized how dangerous the Jianghu is, how rare resources are, and how hard money is to earn. To get this 'Morning Yellow Dew,' you had to brave great danger, endure great hardship, and suffer greatly, and even then you barely got it, or might have returned empty-handed. But I bought it with money and got it easily with words. If you serve me well, would I ever withhold these things from you?"

Li Xian said, "Madam's great kindness makes Li Xian惶恐 (惶恐 - huang kong - terrified/reverent)." Wen Cai-shang looked closely at him. Seeing the face she had dreamed of right before her, her heart stirred, passion grew strong, and thoughts of their past intimacy flooded her mind. She was extremely intelligent, calculating accounts clearly, demanding perfection in everything. But after going through so much with Li Xian, her love had sunk into her bones. She wanted to settle accounts with Li Xian clearly, to calculate everything precisely. Yet she didn't want to settle things clearly, her mood contradictory. She thought that if things were settled clearly, wouldn't there be no more connection?

Wen Cai-shang said, "That's right, Li Lang... do you remember what you promised me?" Li Xian was extremely smart and said, "Madam is referring to... my eyes."

Wen Cai-shang said, "Correct, Li Lang~ You wouldn't bear to lie to me, right? If you gouged out your eyes for me, I... I would be very happy." She rested her head on Li Xian's shoulder.

Li Xian's heart was filled with bitterness. To receive the favor of the Madam was truly hard to say if it was good or bad. He said, "I will gouge out my eyes for the Madam."

Wen Cai-shang's beautiful eyes were filled with joy, hard to express. She coquettishly said, "If it weren't for your wild nature and dishonesty, I wouldn't make you do this. Don't blame me." Li Xian pulled Wen Cai-shang into his arms. Holding this beauty, his mind raced. He said, "I don't blame the Madam, but could you give me a few more days?"

Wen Cai-shang's expression turned cold, piercingly icy. "It seems you are still unwilling in the end."

Li Xian said sincerely, "It's not that I am unwilling, but it is rare to see the Madam again. If I gouge out my eyes now, I will no longer be able to see the Madam's beautiful appearance. I really cannot bear it."

Wen Cai-shang was very moved. She thought, *Ah! That is true. If Li Lang gouges out his eyes now, he won't be able to see me. I need to let him look a few more times, so he engraves it into his heart.* She smiled and said, "So that's it. I misunderstood."

Li Xian said, "Please give me some time to look at the Madam properly." Wen Cai-shang said, "Of course, there is no problem. This face of mine is all dressed up for you."

Li Xian said, "No wonder I was shocked by your beauty. Madam... the two of us..." Wen Cai-shang was very tempted, but suddenly thought that this boy was cunning. If she got intimate with him too quickly, she might lose the rhythm and control. A little impatience would ruin the grand plan. Taming a husband is not an easy matter.

Wen Cai-shang flicked her sleeve, throwing Li Xian several zhang away. She looked似笑似嗔 (似笑似嗔 - si xiao si chen - half-smiling, half-angry) and said, "You... go rest first, always fantasizing. I'll let you delay for today. Don't think that a few sweet words will work on me. I want to forgive you, but I haven't forgiven you yet."

She turned and walked away quickly. Her mind was in turmoil. A reunion after a long separation was like a dry well containing new streams, or dry wood meeting a spark. Undercurrents surged, and hidden fire burned her body.

Li Xian coughed twice, patting the dust off his clothes. Wen Cai-shang's voice drifted from afar: "Xiao Tuan, take him to the side pavilion to bathe."

The Blue Fragrance Water Pavilion was four stories high, consisting of one main pavilion and three side pavilions. It was fresh and elegant, with a clever structure. The second floor of the main pavilion had a waterfall landscape, which was rare to hear of. Xiao Tuan led the way in front, and Li Xian looked around carefully. He was startled to find that the layout of the courtyard involved the "principles of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements."

Using mountains, water, flowers, grass, artificial rocks, and green lakes... it formed a clever trap. Li Xian had some skill in the Five Elements Strange Escape, so he couldn't fully see through its principles for the moment, but he could already see the clues. He knew that if he took a wrong step in this place, Yin and Yang would be reversed, heaven and earth would hang upside down, causing imbalance and confusion. The more urgently one tried to escape, the more惨重 the fall.

Arriving at the side pavilion, Xiao Tuan said, "Young Master Li, we have arrived. From today on, you will live here." Li Xian said, "Okay, thank you, Xiao Tuan."

Xiao Tuan chuckled and said, "Young Master Li's demeanor is truly extraordinary. The last imposter was scared silly after just a couple of moves, his狼狈 (狼狈 - lang bei - wretched) appearance was hilarious... well, take care of yourself." She hurriedly retreated. She felt as if she were sitting on pins and needles, guessing that the Madam was watching closely. If she said half a word more, Li Xian would be fine, but she might lose her life.

Xiao Tuan hurried back and reported to Wen Cai-shang. Wen Cai-shang frowned and looked over, scrutinizing her carefully. Seeing that Xiao Tuan was young but had delicate features, her jealousy flared. She had just抓得情郎 (抓得情郎 - zhuo de qing lang - caught her lover), and her feelings of love and hate were unclear. She didn't want any other woman near him, so she said淡淡道 (淡淡道 - dan dan dao - indifferently): "Li Xian's affairs, I will handle personally in the future. If he speaks to you, you are not to respond."

"Do not approach the East Side Pavilion area."

Li Xian saw that the residence was elegant, spacious, and open. Green plants and vines were planted inside, and there was a small pond with goldfish. He couldn't help but mutter: "After these twists and turns, it's actually better than the inn I stayed in."

Inside, there was a pool with curling white mist. It was natural spring water diverted into the pool, warm and comfortable, flowing clear. Li Xian undressed and jumped into the pool to bathe. His brows furrowed and relaxed from time to time, facing a great dilemma.

"The Madam treats me with genuine affection. But this Madam's temper is too terrifying. The title 'Madam Who Breaks Swords' is truly fitting. She wants to break others' swords, and also wants to break mine."

"My martial arts were bestowed by the Madam, and I have feelings for her too. But I cannot sink into infatuation. If there is a chance, I still need to leave. A real man must stand tall and proud. I need to surpass the Madam, suppress the Madam... rather than obediently gouge out my eyes and accept her sword, covered by her skirt."

Li Xian looked inward at his whole body. Wen Cai-shang's finger Qi had spread, locking his tendons and bones, evolving to the extreme, making it very difficult to break free. Li Xian tried to circulate his internal Qi, but it couldn't leave his Qi Lake. He tried to use his strength, but couldn't调动 even a ten-thousandth.

Li Xian couldn't help but sigh. The one who understood him was Wen Cai-shang. Wen Cai-shang had countless methods, perfectly countering him. Knowing he was born with divine strength, she locked his tendons and meridians. Li Xian bathed simply and found a set of clothes next to the bath pool. They were of silk texture, with a exquisite style.

They looked quite luxurious. There were also jade pendants, hair crowns, swords... and many other male accessories. Li Xian put them on one by one and looked in the mirror. He saw the figure in the mirror was heroic and outstanding, unbearably handsome, his appearance even more enhanced.

Li Xian's eyes flickered with dark light. Since Wen Cai-shang wasn't killing him immediately, he had a chance to escape. He would stabilize Wen Cai-shang for now, then plan something else. The scenery in the residence was pleasant. Since he was here, he settled down, appreciating and viewing, increasing his knowledge.

By evening.

The setting sun was setting. Li Xian found an ordinary long sword in the residence. Seeing the spacious room, his hands itched, so he practiced the "Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword."

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Proficiency +1\]

\[Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword·First Layer\]

\[Proficiency: 75499/80000 Peak Mastery\]

\[Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword·Second Layer\]

\[Proficiency: 73569/80000 Peak Mastery\]

\[Archery\]

\[Proficiency: 48965/50000 Peak Mastery\]

Martial arts are endless. Is there another landscape above Peak Mastery? Li Xian's "Four Directions Fist," "Breeze Leg," "Green Silk Palm," and other martial arts had long reached Peak Mastery. Every time he used them, proficiency was accumulated. All had tens of thousands of proficiency.

Among them, "Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword" and "Archery" were used the most. The Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword was a rare trump card, often practiced, hiding a killing intent. Archery had many uses, often used, and progressed quickly.

Now that he had come back to his senses, he realized the proficiency of the Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword had accumulated over seventy thousand. Just a half step further, and Peak Mastery would be full. Li Xian danced as if he had forgotten himself. The sword edge swept past, containing an indescribable subtlety.

It was evening, which matched the meaning of the setting sun. The sword body was agile and graceful. Li Xian finished several sword dances, his blood and Qi surging, his internal Qi growing.

Accumulating over time, his Qi Lake was already over a hundred zhang wide. His internal Qi was vast and restrained. The "Heavy Vein Finger" Qi around Li Xian was very difficult to施展 (施展 - shi zhan - use). He finished his martial arts practice and felt hungry and tired. He remembered that the "Morning Yellow Dew" was already in his hands.

"The Recipe for Golden Light, the Morning Yellow Dew needs to be drunk at the time of Zi (11pm-1am), and one must sit still during the process, waiting for the morning sun to cover the whole body. Then the drinking is successful. The Recipe for Golden Light is relatively easy to drink."

"But the current situation is unstable. I'll wait two days to see the situation."

The next day. Wen Cai-shang came specially to check on Li Xian's situation. Seeing him living safely, as if it were the past, she was very happy. She had Li Xian accompany her to tour the courtyard and enjoy the scenery. Li Xian supported her as they walked, slowly appreciating the scenery.

Whenever Li Xian saw something strange or puzzling, he asked directly. Wen Cai-shang would explain in detail, making the origin, meaning, and use... all clear. After walking half the circle, Wen Cai-shang said幽幽 (幽幽 - you you - faintly/sadly): "Li Lang... originally, I hated you so much. When I saw you, I wanted to stab you three thousand six hundred times to vent the hatred in my heart. The rest of the number, I would slowly repay."

"But after really seeing you, I couldn't bear it in the end. But I keep my word, and you keep yours. You said you would repay, so you must repay. Starting today, you will begin to repay. You must endure the pain well. Don't run away again in the future."

She had Li Xian extend his hand. She swept her sleeve, and two sword marks appeared on his palm. Although the sword marks were faint, the pain was extreme. This sword was called "Heart-wrenching Sword," a martial art from the "Wounded Mad Sword Sect" of the Great Yu period.

It was now lost. Wen Cai-shang had read widely and remembered it in her heart, but had never practiced it. This sword technique emphasized "hurting people and paining people." In the early stage of the sword technique, the sword wound caused severe pain, directly connecting to the opponent's heart and liver, hurting the soul. Just a scrape on the skin would cause painful convulsions. It was extremely fierce and powerful. When the sword technique reached the high depths, it reversed.

When the sword injured the enemy, the enemy felt pain and I also felt pain. The wound was on the enemy's body, but the pain was in my heart. This was the true meaning of the sword technique, and its power increased suddenly. Wen Cai-shang's sword was barely proficient, still in the early stage.

But if she really stabbed him millions of times, she could surely reach perfection and understand the true meaning of the sword. At that time, although she would hurt Li Xian, she would also hurt herself. Li Xian's physique was very strong. He endured the pain without a word and quickly suppressed it. But his back and forehead were covered in cold sweat.

Wen Cai-shang felt both heartache and satisfaction. She gently wiped him with a fragrant handkerchief and said, "Li Lang, I'll return one sword today. This courtyard scenery was carefully arranged by me. You accompany me for a stroll."

Li Xian said, "Okay." The two walked hand in hand through the courtyard. The courtyard covered an area of over ten mu, but they strolled for nearly two hours. They talked intimately, leaning on each other. This relationship was truly strange.

At noon, three maidservants brought lunch from the "Delicacy Building" next to the Blue Fragrance Water Pavilion. The Delicacy Building was a famous restaurant in Flying Dragon City, with "Nineteen Dishes" of delicacies, famous throughout the world, known for their strange flavors.

Wen Cai-shang usually didn't cook, buying dishes from the Delicacy Building. Every morning, noon, and evening, maidservants would deliver them to the courtyard. As usual, they ate and drank, and Wen Cai-shang had Li Xian join her at the table.

Wen Cai-shang frowned, displeased with the serving maid. She had Li Xian gouge out his eyes and destroy his sight, and during this time, she didn't want any other woman to enter his sight, not even a fraction. Xiao Tuan was very young and was also sent away. She said, "From today on, let a man deliver the food."

Before the maid could reply, she was wrapped in a gust of strong wind and fell out of the residence in a wretched state. They looked terrified and fled in a hurry. Wen Cai-shang was angry for no reason and stabbed Li Xian with another "Heart-wrenching Sword." Then she felt heartache again and helped Li Xian sit down.

Li Xian thought to himself: *I only hate that my strength is still weak, otherwise how could I let the Madam act so arrogantly.* He thought of another plan and temporarily complied. The lunch included many unique dishes with distinct names and lingering flavors, such as Exquisite Phoenix Roast, Green Willow Singing Shade... Li Xian tasted the dishes and pondered their preparation methods.

Whenever he tasted something delicious, he couldn't help but think: *If I had enough ingredients, could I also recreate it? When can I, relying on myself, run a restaurant with famous, delicious dishes?*

While savoring slowly, the small noon banquet ended. Wen Cai-shang said, "Li Lang, how long has it been since you practiced the sword?" Li Xian said, "I practice every day, my sword path is not rusty."

Wen Cai-shang smiled and said, "Good, then I will test your sword path. Where did your Sunken River Sword go?"

Li Xian said, "It's embarrassing to say, I lost it." Wen Cai-shang said, "Although Ou Yezi's forging is excellent, the Sunken River Sword was not his masterpiece. Since it's lost, there's nothing to regret. I have a Green Sword and a Purple Sword. These two swords were originally a pair called the 'Green Purple Twin Wall Swords.' Now you take the Green Sword, I take the Purple Sword, let's try the Twin Sword Union."

Li Xian's Sunken River Sword was hidden at the inn. To hide his identity, he didn't carry it with him. He lied deliberately. Although Wen Cai-shang was sharp and smart, she didn't think deeply about it. A long box was placed next to the table. Opening the hidden latch, two long swords came into view.

The Green Sword was straight and slender, the Purple Sword was ethereal and hazy. Each sword had its own strengths. Li Xian immediately took the Green Sword. As he danced, his figure was crisp and bright, extremely sharp, sharper than the Sunken River Sword.

Wen Cai-shang watched for a moment and praised in her heart: *What a heroic bearing, worthy of being my Li Lang.* Her delicate hand flipped, her sleeve rolled up the Purple Sword, and she held it in her hand. She was wearing a white dress and had long planned to dance with the sword. She施展ed the "Yin Sword Chapter" of the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword.

Initially, her sword hid killing moves, showing no mercy. Several moves were all blocked by Li Xian's Yang Sword. Li Xian's Yang Sword skill was actually higher than Wen Cai-shang's. Li Xian gradually took the initiative. The sword momentum connected, making it difficult for Wen Cai-shang to withdraw.

The two first dueled with swords, but the sword momentum became increasingly soft and sticky. The meaning of the sword duel gradually faded, taking on another kind of charm. Wen Cai-shang began to smile, feeling very satisfied. She shouted, "Watch the sword!" Her voice was crisp, as if playing a joke.

Li Xian received the sword and turned. Every time the Green and Purple Twin Swords touched, there was a feeling of Yin cold and Yang heat blending. Like natural wonderful power pouring over the head and body, roaming the infinite ocean.

\[You Twin Swords Union, sword intent blends, Proficiency +12\]

Li Xian used a move "Hanging Sun Standing." This was a killing move from the first layer of the Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword, a move from bottom to top. The sword tip pointed straight at the blazing sun, receiving the sunlight, making the sword body shine with dazzling light.

When Li Xian first obtained the Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword, he had practiced this move recklessly and almost injured himself. Now with the Twin Swords Union, this sword move could be used. Wen Cai-shang used "Falling Moon Like Drop." Her white dress fluttered, her body hung in mid-air, sword tip pointing down.

The two sword tips met exactly, not a fraction off. The evolution of the move was profound. The wind rose and clouds surged around, now bright, now dark, as if several days and nights passed in an instant. Li Xian and Wen Cai-shang were both surprised.

Li Xian thought: *The Madam's strength seems even more profound and unpredictable.* Wen Cai-shang thought: *Li Lang's progress is so fast. It hasn't been long since we parted, and he already has such skill. If I don't watch him for a moment, he becomes incredibly naughty. His progress is too fast.*

At this time, both their strengths were no longer what they used to be. This Twin Swords Union finally showed the capability of the sword technique. Their minds were agile, but only an instant passed around them. They only felt the Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword was vast and profound.

\[You Twin Swords Union, honing sword moves, Proficiency +124\]

From the first layer to the second layer, from the second layer to the third layer.

\[Yang Sword Sheathed, Proficiency +2\]

\[Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword·Third Layer\]

\[Proficiency: 1243/8000 Small Accomplishment\]

This third layer sword technique pointed directly at the essence, breaking through illusion, reaching the inside. It was a watershed in the sword technique. Wen Cai-shang was originally anxious and angry at Li Xian, how could she be willing to show embarrassment early. But once the sword momentum rose, their hearts blended, so she went with the flow and practiced the third layer sword technique together.

Until evening.

\[Setting Sun Declining Blood Sword·Third Layer\]

\[Proficiency: 1536/8000 Small Accomplishment\]

The sword path had made great progress. Wen Cai-shang's body was weak and exhausted. Although her cultivation was very strong, her strength was lacking.

Xiao Tuan lowered her head and called out, "Madam, Madam." She looked around everywhere. The courtyard was quite messy, with precious flowers and plants trampled and broken. The sword practice had been intense just now, which was hard to avoid.

Li Xian called out, "The Madam is here. If you have something to say, say it." Xiao Tuan acted as if she didn't hear, keeping her head down and not looking, but walked nearby. Li Xian asked strangely, "Xiao Tuan? Xiao Tuan?" He called several times.

Wen Cai-shang smoothed her clothes and said softly, "Li Lang, help me comb my hair." She called Li Xian behind her. Her voice was still charming and seductive. Xiao Tuan was startled hearing this: *The Madam is extremely powerful. I thought I was clever, but I never really understood the Madam. Hearing her voice, could it be that just now...*

The courtyard blocked sound. If you moved half a zhang away, you couldn't hear it. So although the movement was loud just now, and Wen Cai-shang didn't suppress her voice, Xiao Tuan didn't察觉 at all. If she looked up now and saw the messy garden scene and the two people's clothes, she could guess what happened. But she became even more terrified of Wen Cai-shang and didn't dare look up, afraid of seeing Li Xian, and even less dare to respond to Li Xian's words.

Wen Cai-shang took her time smoothing the traces of disorder on her body. She said, "What is so urgent?" Xiao Tuan said, "Madam, outside... City Lord He is looking for you."

Wen Cai-shang frowned and said, "He Wentian?" She was already unwilling to receive him. She saw that Xiao Tuan was very sensible, keeping her head low, covering her ears, absolutely not talking to Li Xian, absolutely not letting Li Xian see her. Her mood improved slightly. She thought: *This little girl is skillful and also smart and sensible. Much better than Qiu Yue and the like.*

She waved her hand and said, "I know. You withdraw quickly." Xiao Tuan fled quickly.

Wen Cai-shang had opened the taboo and her interest was strong. She originally wanted to return to the bedroom to talk in detail, but He Wentian was looking for her. She said, "This He Wentian... sometimes he is really annoying."

Li Xian asked, "Madam doesn't want to see him?" Wen Cai-shang said, "Naturally. He Wentian is not simple." She walked forward and suddenly saw a light red embroidered shoe hanging on a flower branch.

Wen Cai-shang's beautiful face turned red. She cursed and恶狠狠地 (恶狠狠地 - e hen hen di - viciously) glared at Li Xian. Just now the situation was chaotic, she didn't know how her shoe ended up on the branch. Li Xian took down the embroidered shoe and bent down to help her put it on.

Wen Cai-shang's heart stirred. Seeing Li Xian's meticulous actions, lifting her skirt, holding her foot, putting on the shoe, the movements were细微 (细微 - xi wei - subtle), but touched her heart deeply. Her eyes showed a strange light, extremely sweet. Suddenly she frowned again, afraid that Li Xian would also put on shoes for others in the future. She flicked her sleeve, and another sword mark appeared on Li Xian's palm.

She saw Li Xian in pain but didn't explain. She slightly raised her hand, asking him to support her.

Although Li Xian felt severe pain, his face didn't show it. He secretly got vicious. *Next time we use Twin Swords Union, I will definitely make the Madam狼狈万分 (狼狈万分 - lang bei wan fen - extremely wretched).* He supported her and walked together in the flower corridor. He asked, "I heard that City Lord He is a good person. Why doesn't the Madam want to see him?"

Wen Cai-shang smiled and said, "You, you are smart, but your experience is shallow. The thing that is least trustworthy in this world is so-called rumors. Sometimes even personal contact can lead to misjudging a person. What's more, the nonsense of outsiders."

Li Xian said, "Is that so? I heard... from others that this He Wentian has quite a scholarly demeanor, it doesn't seem to be without reason."

Wen Cai-shang nodded and said, "He Wentian's current actions do match the rumors. But he can fool others, but it's not easy to fool me."

Li Xian said, "Did the Madam discover something strange about him?"

Wen Cai-shang said, "I can't say I discovered it. It's just that this person seems easy-going and scholarly, but actually quite utilitarian. He learned of Fu Haoran's location and visited him daily, hoping to build a connection, asking about knowledge daily. But his knowledge is very shallow."

Li Xian said, "In the Madam's eyes, it is shallow, but in others' eyes, it might not be profound." Wen Cai-shang covered her mouth and laughed: "Little bootlicker, you really know how to talk. But if he really has no such knowledge, he wouldn't be able to appreciate Fu Haoran's calligraphy. Why would he still respect him so much? Learning that Fu Haoran left, he even shed tears, not like a man at all."

Li Xian heard this and felt it made more sense.

Wen Cai-shang said, "And this person's archery is excellent. If I guess correctly, he hides great ambition. His easy-going and scholarly demeanor is all a disguise. People like this who come to visit may hide other purposes. That's why I don't want to see him."

They arrived at a fork in the road. Wen Cai-shang said, "Go this way, and you can return to the side pavilion." She gently patted Li Xian's hand and said, "Rest well."

Li Xian returned to the side pavilion. Although he hadn't探清 (探清 - tan qing - figured out) the depth of Madam Wen today, he had探清 the depth of Wen Cai-shang. He waited until the time of Zi (11pm-1am) and drank the "Morning Yellow Dew."

\[You drank Morning Yellow Dew, Cooking skill Proficiency +56\]

\[The Recipe for Golden Light is now complete.\]
