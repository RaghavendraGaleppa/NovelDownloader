# Chapter 317: The Empty City Stratagem—BBQ Edition!

“Report!”

A messenger rushed into the hall in a panic, shouting loudly, “The twelve armies from the various tribes of the Southern Frontier, along with their disaster beasts, are heading toward Qingmu City! Their speed is incredible; they will arrive at Qingmu City in at most half an hour!”

Qu Sheng frowned. “Notify every camp to ascend the city walls immediately. Send the logistics troops to deploy the military equipment right away. All logistics personnel are to move out!”

Order after order was issued, passed down by dozens of personal guards.

Garrison Commander Wu Lang asked in confusion, “Grand Commander, is it really necessary to send so many people to transport our military equipment?”

Maintaining the basic structure of the Qingmu Camp was already difficult enough, let alone dealing with military equipment. Some of the artifacts were more precious than human lives. Without support from the Imperial Court, it was simply impossible to afford them.

“Young Master Li sent...”

“Ahem!”

A certain unknown ‘Wang Qi’ (Wife-empowering) Dou Hun coughed.

Qu Sheng corrected himself, “Ah, Young Master Li led me to unexpectedly find a stockpile of military equipment from the previous dynasty. There are many killing weapons inside, all as clean and new as the day they were made.”

“?”

Many question marks appeared above the generals' heads.

*Commander, are you listening to what you're saying?*

*The previous dynasty? As clean and new?*

However, seeing Young Master Li’s serious expression, the generals were no fools. Even if Young Master Li had provided these items, was this something that could be spoken of so casually?

*Found them. We definitely found them.*

“Young Master Li is truly the Chosen One; he actually stumbled upon military equipment.”

“This is the will of Heaven. It seems the Heavens wish for us to win this battle!”

“Having military equipment is good, but the enemy is almost here. In such a hurry, will we have time to deploy all of it?”

Setting up military equipment was no easy task. For example, the Disaster-Resisting Array Stones—even if one had enough Xuan Crystals to spare, covering the entire city wall would take at least two hours.

“Why don't I lead a few camps out to intercept them?”

Wu Lang stood up with a look of facing death unflinchingly.

“Commander Wu is admirable!”

“You haven't disgraced the Qingmu Camp!”

“Go ahead, Brother Wu. I’ll join you shortly.”

To go out and intercept the enemy meant a death with no escape. Without the resolve to die, Wu Lang would not have volunteered.

For a moment, the atmosphere in the military camp was no less than that of the ancient poem: *The wind is bleak by the Yi River, as the brave warrior leaves never to return.* Send-off wine was already being poured.

“Wait,” a voice from the side suddenly caught everyone’s attention. It was Young Master Li.

Li Mo looked at the generals ready to die for their cause and felt it was a bit strange. *In the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, do they not like using strategies when fighting?*

“We cannot sacrifice our soldiers recklessly. If the goal is simply to buy time, I have a humble suggestion.”

He didn't know much about leading armies, which was why he had remained silent until now.

But everyone knew that Young Master Li was a genius!

Qu Sheng nodded slightly, signaling for him to speak.

Li Mo stood up and scanned the generals. With a calm expression, he said, “Based on my experience fighting him, Han Zhen is a cunning old fox who is suspicious by nature. He schemes deeply and is not easy to deal with.”

Everyone nodded. That old monster had borrowed a corpse to return to life; how could he not be a calculating man?

To deal with such a person, ordinary strategies would likely be ineffective, which was why Wu Lang had chosen to buy time with his life.

“To deal with such a person, there is a specific method. What is the biggest flaw of a wise man?”

“Overthinking!”

“People who like to scheme plan ten steps ahead for every step they take. So, we shall do the exact opposite!”

“He expects us to be on high alert, but we will act as if we are completely defenseless.”

“Why not leave the city gates wide open? While we secretly deploy our equipment, we can set up barbecue grills and let the soldiers on the walls eat barbecue and sing songs. How will he respond then?”

“???”

The generals leaned back in tactical shock. The question marks above their heads multiplied as they sucked in a cold breath.

*This... will this actually work? Isn't this too risky?*

---

However, some of the more strategic generals, such as Qu Sheng and Wu Lang, fell into deep thought. Putting themselves in the enemy's shoes, their eyes gradually lit up.

What do smart people fear most? They fear the abnormal.

*If something is abnormal, there must be a trick behind it.* One would inevitably ponder it deeply.

Han Zhen was certainly not a reckless youth.

“If Han Zhen reacts early and charges into the city regardless?”

“Then we would still have to order the soldiers to resist. Wouldn't intercepting them outside result in casualties anyway?”

“Incredible. This plan is brilliant. Young Master Li actually knows military strategy? May I ask what this plan is called?”

The generals felt it was truly feasible and looked at Li Mo with looks of admiration.

This Wang Qi Dou Hun not only knew martial arts but also military strategy. Who could withstand such a person?

In his heart, Li Mo thanked Grand Preceptor Zhuge, then smiled and said, “The Empty City Stratagem—BBQ Edition!”

.......

Three hundred miles outside Qingmu City.

Under the night sky, the ferocious and terrifying Bronze Witch Spirit statues moved slowly, making the warriors around them look exceptionally small. There were dozens of these statues, each containing the accumulated faith of the masses over the years.

Behind the Witch Spirit statues were various siege engines, battering rams, and arrow towers, pulled forward by strong warriors.

In the center of the army, inside a temple being carried by many warriors.

This was none other than the temple Han Zhen had in Senluo Valley. Now, being carried by so many warriors, it looked like a mobile palace.

“Prince Helian, you have the style of your ancestors. I remember drinking and laughing with God of War Helian back in the day. Now, the times have changed, and the people are gone,” Han Zhen said, looking at the man drinking not far away.

The man was tall and slender, wearing a black vine armor that seemed to writhe with life. He had an aquiline nose and an unruly look.

This man in vine armor was no simple identity.

The Helian clan was similar to the Zhong family, ordered to guard the Southern Frontier.

When the border army returned to the capital, the Helian clan remained in the Southern Frontier. After the fall of the Great Shang Dynasty, they were preserved because they continued to guard the frontier. After thousands of years, they remain the leaders of the Southern Frontier tribes.

Helian Wu possessed the aura of invincibility among the younger generation and had once ranked sixteenth on the潜龙榜 (Hidden Dragon List).

Under his call, the tribes of the Southern Frontier were gradually uniting.

“You overstate things, State Preceptor. The Emperor of Great Yu promised to marry his youngest daughter to me, but he went back on his word and said she ran away. Hmph, he is clearly making a fool of me!”

Helian Wu slammed his cup onto the table heavily.

Han Zhen smiled. “Once we retrieve one of the Ancestral Spirits, the Divine Phoenix, and restore the former glory of the Great Shang Dynasty, let alone one princess, even the beauties of the Hundred Flowers List would be offered to Great Yu on a silver platter.”

Helian Wu curled his lips, a red light flashing in his eyes. “According to the State Preceptor, how long will it take to break Qingmu City?”

“Seven days. At most seven days.”

Helian Wu raised an eyebrow.

There were eighty thousand defenders inside, all under the command of the King of the South. They were much harder to chew than the garrison troops scattered everywhere else.

Han Zhen narrowed his eyes and smiled. “Emperor Jingtao of Great Yu had long planned to abandon the Southern Pass, which is why he put so many restraints on the King of the South. Without a leader behind them, seven days is already giving the Qingmu defenders too much credit.”

“Oh? But the King of the South is still there. If he comes...”

“After the city is broken, let my warriors kill and slaughter for a few days. Once the Southern Pass City is屠戮 (slaughtered), I can take control of the Profound Way.”

“The King of the South... after all, is not a true Seventh Realm.”

As these words fell, the many ferocious figures in the hall became excited, turning the temple into a ghostly realm for a moment.

Half an hour passed in the blink of an eye.

Before long, the massive city of Qingmu was already within sight.

The cold wind howled.

*Hmm?*

Han Zhen frowned and sniffed.

*What is that smell?*

It... actually smelled quite delicious.
