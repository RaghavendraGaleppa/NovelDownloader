Chapter 249: Minor Success of the Seven Stars, Diligent Study of Medicine, Three Flowers Above the Head, The Second Manifestation!

The wind howled mournfully through the Tiger's Cry Ridge, a desolate sound echoing from all directions.

Another sleepless night had passed. The sparse sunlight was reluctant to descend, with only faint speckles proving the arrival of day. Spending a night in the wet forest was far from comfortable. Wen Caishang held Li Xian tightly, yet she felt a surprising warmth, save for a trace of dampness.

She awoke naturally and sat down to practice her internal arts. Her hair swayed slightly as she worked to prevent her profound skills from regressing.

The rain began to subside.

Li Xian thought to himself, "The Tiger's Cry Ridge stretches for eight hundred miles, and the endless mountain ranges beside it span several provinces and prefectures. To cross them is an extremely difficult task, certainly not something that can be achieved in a single day or night. My martial arts practice cannot be neglected!"

He immediately took a stance and began practicing the "Seven Stars Step." The steps corresponding to the celestial positions of the Celestial Pivot, the Open Yang, and the Jade Balance were already memorized in his heart. As he repeated the movements, his body felt light and agile, darting left and right among the towering ancient trees.

The dense forest blocked out the sky, and there was no star chart to reference, but Heaven rewards the diligent. His hard work and bitter practice would eventually pay off. He naturally stepped into the "Minor Success" realm, and his Qi Lake expanded by another zhang.

[Proficiency +1]

His blood and Qi surged, driving back the damp chill as they continued their journey. Li Xian knew full well the dangers of the Tiger's Cry Ridge; whether they would encounter fortune or misfortune was beyond his control. All he could do was walk the path beneath his feet well.

He chose a direction and walked with determination, carving markers along the way to mark his path.

After walking for about half a day, the surroundings had become exceptionally quiet, with no trace of human presence to be found.

The weeds grew taller than a person, and the shrubs were like solid walls.

The vegetation was covered with "poisonous leeches," dense black dots. Whenever a person drew near, the leeches would sway and writhe, latching onto skin and flesh to suck blood.

Li Xian, fearing he might lose his way, walked straight ahead without avoidance. He crossed mountains when he encountered them and chopped down trees when they blocked his path. When the weeds and thickets before him obstructed the way, he would swing his sword to cleave through them, sweeping aside the obstacles as if breaking rotten wood and carving out a path.

With a "crack," a branch fell to the ground. Poisonous leeches immediately swarmed over it, hundreds and thousands of them clinging to the sword's body. With a flick of his wrist, Li Xian sent a surge of Yang Yuan sword energy through the blade. The scorching Yang fire incinerated the leeches on the spot.

Wen Caishang rolled up her sleeves and drew her sword. Her swordplay was precise, striking repeatedly into the air. She skewered the poisonous leeches, which were still writhing, not yet dead. With a flick of her soft sword, she flung the leeches away.

Li Xian blazed the trail, while Wen Caishang protected the two of them. They cooperated seamlessly, occasionally exchanging glances, feeling a strange and wonderful connection.

But the number of leeches was too great!

Wen Caishang raised an eyebrow, her wrist turning gently. The White Snake soft sword flickered, its speed incredibly fast, and it seemed to vanish into thin air. The leeches that fell from the air were ground into fine powder.

Li Xian asked, "Madam, what sword technique is that?" Wen Caishang said calmly, "The Avici Sword Art. You have seen it before. It is a killing sword, but how it is used depends on my will."

It turned out...

Her Avici Sword Art could unleash over a hundred sword strokes in an instant. It fully displayed the characteristics of a soft sword! Each stroke clung tightly to clothing without tearing it. It was as if an extra layer of sword clothes was attached to the outside of her garments!

Li Xian was filled with envy and a strong desire to learn it. But in the end, he couldn't bring himself to ask. Wen Caishang suddenly sheathed her sword and said, "You try the Chest Drum Thunder Sound."

Li Xian did as he was told, shaking his chest drum, causing a thunderous sound to reverberate. The black leeches within a hundred-zhang radius rained down with a clatter. It was terrifying. Li Xian waved his sword to block, managing to avoid them all.

Li Xian joked, "If we were drenched by that, it would be unforgettable for a lifetime!"

Wen Caishang said, "Let's hurry and leave. I really don't like this place." Li Xian said, "Neither do I," and quickened his pace.

However, the poisonous leeches numbered in the millions. After taking a few steps forward, they were once again covered in black dots slowly writhing.

The thunderous sound from the drum could keep them at bay, but frequent use was extremely draining on his energy and internal Qi. After walking several li, he had already consumed several zhang of his Qi. Wen Caishang, with her broad knowledge, furrowed her slender brows slightly. She observed the flowers, grass, and trees along the way, gathering materials on the spot to prepare medicine.

She crushed various forest herbs like "Five Aconites," "Barrier South Leaves," and "Dust-Repelling Powder," and smeared them on their bodies. This could repel the poisonous leeches.

The effect was excellent.

But the forest was damp, and the medicinal properties were easily diluted. Following her method, Li Xian boiled and prepared another batch, making sachets, pendants, and ointments... in ample supply to carry with them.

Wen Caishang said, "The principles of medicinal compatibility in the world are varied, and the theories of pharmacology differ, so the methods to be respected are different. This is the pharmacology of Yin-Yang and the Five Elements. You always ask me for advice. In this dense forest... I shall teach you as we walk!"

Her clothes were soaked, clinging to her skin. Her white dress was semi-transparent, yet her beauty was undiminished. Even in the deep mountains and old forests, she radiated a glow. At this moment, her gentle and soft voice tugged at the heartstrings.

Li Xian, with his extraordinary composure, was fearless despite being in a dangerous situation. He was as thirsty for knowledge as ever and said joyfully, "Thank you, Madam!"

Wen Caishang said with a charming turn of her phrase, "You little rascal, you're always hoping to pick up some useful knowledge from me. Do you think I can't see it?" She pinched Li Xian's ear and sighed, "You, you're only well-behaved for a moment when you're asking to learn. Once you've learned it, you turn around and order me around."

In the mountains and forests, medicinal herbs were everywhere. Although the two were fleeing for their lives, they relied on each other, chatting casually, exchanging feelings, discussing the martial path, and talking about court affairs... it was not without its interest. After walking more than ten li, they saw over a hundred types of medicinal herbs along the way, and Wen Caishang explained their uses and properties one by one.

Li Xian memorized them firmly, and he gradually became more accustomed to the dangers of the forest.

That noon, Li Xian felt a rumbling in his stomach and only then remembered that they hadn't eaten for several days. It was all because the Tiger's Cry Ridge was filled with malevolent and strange energies, and the two were on high alert, so neither had thought of their hunger.

Li Xian drew his bow and shot some game. He caught two wild rabbits, skinned and gutted them, started a fire to roast them, and sprinkled some salt grains, managing to have a decent meal.

After eating and drinking his fill, Wen Caishang felt a bit tired. Li Xian smiled and said, "Alright, let's rest early today." He stamped on the forest floor, which was still wet and sticky.

He looked up and selected a branch about three zhang high, using his lightness skill to leap onto it. He swept his sword horizontally, chopping it flat. It was just right to accommodate the two of them for sleeping.

Seeing that the rain was gradually stopping, Li Xian's mood brightened, and he felt a bit of the open-mindedness that comes with "since it has come to this, let's be at ease." After the two lay down, Li Xian drew his bow and shot an arrow, knocking down the leaves above them.

Starlight filtered down through the gaps.

Li Xian said, "Madam, your knowledge of celestial patterns and astrology is also extremely formidable. Please teach me now as well." Wen Caishang chided, "You're at it again!" In the past, based on their calculations of mutual benefit, she would not have agreed easily. But now, their lives were intertwined, and the calculations of benefit had long since faded. It was hard for her to give Li Xian a cold refusal, so she said softly, "Very well, I'll teach you. Listen carefully."

Her voice was gentle as she spoke eloquently. The study of the stars was complex and profound, and Li Xian listened, captivated. He saw Wen Caishang's speech gradually slow down until she finally fell asleep.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Madam, Madam... don't blame me for taking advantage of your knowledge. I have to get some benefit. When I roam the Jianghu in the future, with a wealth of knowledge, I won't be capsized in a ditch."

Seeing Wen Caishang's incredibly beautiful face, her white dress slightly transparent, revealing a hint of a golden-red inner garment. Li Xian, at the age of passionate blood and vigor, also felt a surge of desire. He forcefully suppressed it and closed his eyes to sleep.

Suddenly, he heard a rustling sound.

Li Xian's sleep was very light. He followed the sound with his gaze, and his dual pupils showed faintly. In the pitch-black darkness, on a large tree, a human face was peering in their direction.

Li Xian thought to himself, "Peeking in the middle of the night means it's an enemy, not a friend. Why should I be polite?" He immediately drew his bow and shot an arrow, his movements flowing like water.

The figure quickly fled, its speed extremely fast. Li Xian narrowed his eyes slightly. The arrow left the string with a sound like thunder. A yellow light附着 (clung) to it, and it split into three. The figure was pinned to the tree.

Li Xian's Qi was abundant, his spirit vigorous, and he was resolute and strong. Wen Caishang's knowledge was vast, she was well-informed, and her pharmacology was first-rate. If either of them were missing, they would surely be trapped to death in the forest. Therefore, they were inseparable and relied on each other.

Li Xian woke Wen Caishang, and they went together to investigate. The forest was dark, but both had strong eyesight. They groped their way in the dark to the figure's side.

The dead creature was bony and short, its body like a monkey's, its face like a human's.

"It's this thing!" Wen Caishang said.

Li Xian asked for details. Wen Caishang said gravely, "This is a Ruan Monkey, a rare pack-dwelling demon. It has a monkey's body and a human's face, and is cunning and vicious. It likes to hunt prey in groups. This is... a scout monkey. If I am not mistaken, we have already been targeted by a pack of Ruan Monkeys."

Li Xian asked, "What will happen then?"

Wen Caishang said, "It's very dangerous. Ruan Monkeys have the habit of imitating humans. If a powerful martial artist is captured by them, they won't eat them immediately but will torment them to the extreme."

"A large pack of Ruan Monkeys will learn to cook like humans. After tormenting their victims, they will throw them into a pot to be cooked and then share the meal."

Wen Caishang spoke of the Ruan Monkeys. Suddenly, they heard a "rustling" sound, as if something was approaching. They looked around and found that they were already surrounded by hundreds of Ruan Monkeys.

"Squeak! Squeak!" The Ruan Monkeys let out several strange cries. They held poisonous fruits and shot them over. Wen Caishang said, "Those fruits are poisonous. If they break, the toxic gas will cause numbness and paralysis."

Li Xian held Wen Caishang, his feet treading lightly on the leaves as he darted and dodged through the forest. At the same time, he shot arrows into the air, killing several monkeys.

After a brief struggle, the pack of Ruan Monkeys displayed abilities like "traps" and "ambushes." Li Xian and Wen Caishang were both quick-witted and naturally resolved them easily.

Wen Caishang said, "This pack of Ruan Monkeys has actually evolved to use traps and bows. It seems their scale is不小 (不小, not small). It's pointless to fight them for long."

Li Xian nodded, took the bell from his waist, and infused it with Qi, shaking it. A dull "dong long" sound spread out. The Ruan Monkeys all covered their ears, gnashing their teeth and letting out mournful cries. Dozens of them fell from the trees.

Li Xian let out a cold snort and shook the bell again with greater force. The Ruan Monkeys began to retreat. Just at this moment, a Ruan Monkey reached out from the shadows, trying to snatch the "Demon-Repelling Bell."

Wen Caishang let out a cold snort and flipped her sleeve, drawing her sword. She severed the Ruan Monkey's arm and followed up with several sword strokes, killing it completely.

The Ruan Monkey's cunning was fully revealed. Li Xian said, "A single Ruan Monkey is nothing to fear. But hundreds or thousands of cunning Ruan Monkeys, eyeing us from the shadows, is a very bad situation. I need to be more vigilant and protect the Demon-Repelling Bell."

Li Xian asked, "Is the meat of this Ruan Monkey considered a fine treasure?"

Wen Caishang thrust her long sword and flung the Ruan Monkey away, saying, "The flesh of any demon can be considered a fine treasure. But... the meat of the Ruan Monkey is the most inferior. It needs good charcoal, a good fire, and good water to cook it, and only then can it barely be turned into [Fine Treasure] meat. But it contains very little of the essence of heaven and earth. Therefore... Ruan Monkeys are extremely disliked by martial artists. In the Jianghu, 'Ruan Monkey' is an insult. If you say that word, it's a great humiliation, and it will definitely lead to a 'fight to the death' situation!"

Li Xian said, "I see. Madam, why didn't you tell me sooner? I've been using the word 'Ruan Monkey' to curse people like Su Qiuwu and Li Quan. Take a look... don't they two look very much like them?"

Wen Caishang couldn't help but laugh and said, "They do look very similar. But since you are under my tutelage, I won't allow you to use such foul language. When have you ever seen me curse people? Walking in the Jianghu, one should have decorum."

"Besides... cursing someone as a Ruan Monkey will damage your grace. You are not allowed to do it."

Li Xian smiled and said, "Yes, I will obey the Madam's command. Then, Madam, should we go east or west?"

Wen Caishang rolled her eyes and said, "In this matter, it is for you to decide." She then headed east.

The forest path was long, and no one disturbed them. Although there were dangers and perils, the combined abilities of the two could resolve them all.

One day.

[You have ventured into a perilous land, visited the heavens and the earth, and the digestion of the essence of heaven and earth has accelerated.]

Li Xian's whole body trembled slightly. The aura within him grew thicker, and a halo glowed from his brow. The manifestation of the "Ethereal Melody" was fully displayed.

His palm moved lightly, producing a light sound like the gentle clinking of jade, capable of playing a melody. The two hundred and six bones throughout his body all resonated, and the full essence of the "Ethereal Melody" manifestation was revealed!

Wen Caishang said:

"The Ethereal Melody is the sound of heaven and earth. It is the first manifestation of the second realm of the martial path, and also a very important cornerstone of the martial path."

Li Xian opened his mouth to speak, but suddenly exuded rolling white mist. A second manifestation appeared consecutively... Three Flowers Above the Head!

The manifestations that martial artists develop all have an internal logic. They are external expressions that appear when a transformation reaches a certain level.

The Three Flowers Above the Head is no exception. It has another alias, called "Firewood in the Belly"!
