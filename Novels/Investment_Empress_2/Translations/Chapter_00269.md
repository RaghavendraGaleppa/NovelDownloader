# Chapter 269: The Jade Feather Whistle, Silk Stockings, and the Contents of the Brocade Bag

The moon was cool as water.

Shadows of trees swayed, rustling softly in the night breeze.

Li Mo turned toward the sound and saw a figure standing in the clear, moonlit Buddhist hall, hands clasped behind their back, casting a long shadow on the ground.

She stood quietly in the ancient temple under the cold moon, eyes slightly lowered. This added a touch of ethereal grace to the Zen-like tranquility, making even the Bodhisattva statue nearby seem to fade into the background.

"The brocade bag fell down. I wanted to hang it back up," she said.

Li Mo quickly tied a secure knot in the brocade bag, and after confirming it wouldn't come loose, jumped down from the tree.

"What's inside the brocade bag?"

"If I say it out loud, will it... lose its effectiveness?"

The ever-unsuperstitious Li Mo jumped down from the tree, thought for a moment, and then asked with a completely serious expression.

"....."

Ying Bing's lips parted slightly. Her gaze fell on the brocade bag swaying on the branch, as if she could see right through it.

She had been about to say that a mere tree could not dictate a person's fate.

Yet, she remembered the earnest warnings from the Qing Luan clan woman before she left their territory: never let anyone know the contents of the bag...

"Fine."

Ying Bing didn't press further. Her figure moved with the wind as she lightly landed on the treetop and took out another brocade bag to hang there.

Her movements were swift, and she returned to the ground in an instant.

She then saw the young man looking up at the bag with longing eyes.

"You hung it..."

"It loses its effectiveness if spoken aloud," Ying Bing said softly. Without needing to see the curve of her lips, one could hear the hint of a smile in her tone.

"......Alright." Li Mo sat down.

"......" Ying Bing sat beside him.

The two sat together, watching the moon, just like many nights in the past.

If any road demons had passed by, their jaws would have dropped in shock. The two of them—the Qing Luan Goddess and the Peerless Flood Dragon, who might draw blood whenever they met—were sitting together watching the moon as naturally as if it were the most ordinary thing in the world?

"冰坨子 (Ice Cube), you've gotten much stronger," Li Mo said, looking at the girl. The haze in his eyes cleared, becoming bright and clear.

This was what the Eyes of Divine Fate had told him. Ying Bing's progress in observing the Divine Will was even faster than his.

"Mm."

"What have you been doing in the Southern Frontier?"

And so, Ying Bing began to speak in her clear, quiet voice about her experiences after arriving in the Southern Frontier, starting from the time she shaved the scalp of a Peng demon.

It could be summarized very simply: observing the Divine Will and slaying demons.

"Other than that, you didn't do anything else?"

Li Mo clicked his tongue. Ice Cube was just as hardworking as Princess Jiang, truly worthy of being her. Speaking of which, Princess Jiang had a hobby of scavenging for junk as well.

"Mm..."

Ying Bing caressed the big-headed doll.

Did zoning out count as doing something?

"By the way, and you?" She looked up at him. Her moon-drenched eyes seemed to see right into his heart. "The Peerless Flood Dragon?"

"....."

Li Mo suddenly felt a bit hot.

Strange, summer was long over, wasn't it?

"Well, you know, the water tribes... in terms of choosing a mate, they're quite... open-minded."

"Mm."

"During the water tribes' selection process, I figured I needed to make a bit of a showing to qualify for coming to the Empty Mountain Temple."

"And then?"

"Some demon or other started spreading rumors that I have the bloodline of a true dragon. The rumors got more and more exaggerated, and now a lot of water tribe women are coming to give me gifts."

Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed slightly.

She didn't know how to describe the feeling. It was just that the image of Li Mo surrounded by a group of female demons flashed through her mind, and her hand instinctively wanted to reach for her sword...

"The demons' traditions are very strange. Accepting a gift means you agree."

"So I didn't accept a single gift."

The only gift Li Mo had accepted in person was the pearl from Zhen Bang, and he had paid for it, including that very large one. He had found ways to return all the other gifts.

He was just about to continue.

*Crack—*

"!"

A chill ran down Li Mo's neck as he saw the big-headed doll's head being twisted off by a slender, jade-like finger.

And then...

A... jade feather whistle was taken out from inside?

"The Qing Luan clan makes instruments that sound like birdsong according to their own voices."

The jade feather whistle lay in the girl's palm, seeming to glow with a watery luster.

---

"I originally planned to come to the Southern Frontier to get some things to take back as a souvenir for you. I didn't expect you to come to the Empty Mountain Temple. You..."

"I love it," Li Mo said with a solemn expression, his eyes clear, his tone absolutely firm!

"But you haven't even heard its sound yet."

"No need. It sounds good just looking at it."

"....."

Li Mo quickly took off the red string from his wrist, threaded the jade feather whistle onto it, and put it back on.

Ying Bing looked away as if nothing had happened, her lips pressed together.

"By the way, I also prepared a gift for you. It's made from pearl-white lotus silk. I made quite a few of them."

"What is it?"

"Silk stockings."

"?"

"I don't know if they'll fit. I suggest you try them on now."

Li Mo felt that the bird clans of the Qing Luan territory probably didn't produce silk stockings.

Gifts should be things the recipient can use and has difficulty obtaining themselves.
— Lu Xun.

Li Mo had always been very good at understanding the wisdom of his predecessors.

And not just understanding it, but knowing how to practice it!

What's the use of understanding so much if you don't practice? How can you call it the unity of knowledge and action?

"You..."

"Say no more."

Shielded by the tree's shadow, Li Mo reached out and removed the Qing Luan Goddess's shoes, revealing a delicate, jade-like foot.

Li Mo's expression was righteous: "See, I told you so. It's hard to buy socks in the Southern Frontier. It's uncomfortable not to wear socks, isn't it?"

"I haven't..."

The small, warm, soft-jade-like foot in his palm slightly curled.

"It smells fragrant, it's definitely fragrant!"

Li Mo felt that if she soaked it in water for a bit, someone could drink from it for years. Who could say it wasn't fragrant?

What if her feet got chafed without socks? Where would she go to complain?

What if the texture wasn't good anymore? Who would take responsibility?

Li Mo gently pinched it, confirming that the texture was still the same soft, warm jade, and his heart eased. He put the silk stockings on her.

"All done."

"I'm the one wearing them, I know."

"Then your hand..." Ying Bing's gaze was profound.

"Occupational hazard," Li Mo said, touching his nose.

As expected, although the texture of the pearl-white lotus silk was good, it depended on what it was compared to.

He took out a few more pairs of silk stockings for Ice Cube.

Of course, he had made more than just these few pairs. But Li Mo, the gentleman, felt that some of the styles were not quite suitable to bring out right now.

"Boss Mo, Boss Mo? Where are you?"

Wu Meng's voice, like a cracked gong, cut through the night sky. It wasn't clear what matter he was looking for Li Mo for.

"It's probably about the competition for the Divine Jade. I'll head back first."

"Mm."

Watching the young man's figure disappear into the darkness, she didn't收回 her gaze for a long time.

*Patter—*

Suddenly, something appeared in her hand.

Ying Bing looked down and saw that it was a brocade bag. It was clearly the one the young man had just tied to the Marriage Tree, but for some reason, it had fallen down again.

It fell on its own.

If it fell, then it should be okay to look, right?

She gently unwrapped it. After seeing what was inside, the girl's silver-white eyelashes, dyed by the moonlight, trembled slightly.

Half a red bean mooncake with a snowy crust.

Why half? Because aside from the Ice Cube pattern, the other half had been eaten, still bearing teeth marks.

She was silent for a long moment.

She took out the brocade bag from her sleeve and unwrapped it.

From inside, she also took out half a lotus seed paste mooncake.

Two halves.

Put them together, and they make a whole one.

Held up, it was just the right size to block the moon in the sky.

A perfect reunion.

PS:

My little sister came over from school. I promised to take her out for some good food. This little author also needs to clear his mind and relax, and think about the details of the Divine Jade competition. So, only two chapters today.

I'd love if you readers would give me a big charge, hehe.
