# Chapter 15: Qingyun Pavilion

After spending a night at the inn, Qin Chong headed to the market the next day.

The market was an ordinary street just over a li long, much narrower than the main thoroughfares. Stalls lined both sides, displaying all sorts of peculiar items, though the vendors took care not to block the entrances of the permanent shops. These street vendors had to pay spirit stones to the nearby shops for the privilege of setting up their stalls.

The scene reminded Qin Chong of an antique market—or perhaps more accurately, a bustling vegetable market. Some haggled discreetly using sound transmission techniques to keep their dealings private, while others preferred loud, open negotiations.

As soon as Qin Chong entered, several vendors rushed to solicit his business. One persistent seller even followed him for quite a distance, evoking a wry smile—it almost felt like being back in his past life.

Most of the goods on display were the lowest-grade items in the cultivation world, though occasionally, rare treasures could be found. Whether one could acquire them depended on both discernment and luck. It was much like treasure hunting in an antique market, though outright counterfeits were rare here. At worst, vendors might exaggerate an item's potency, but experienced cultivators could easily see through such claims.

Suddenly, Qin Chong spotted a familiar figure loudly hawking wares at a stall.

"Isn't that Third Uncle?"

It was indeed Qin Ming, his father's younger brother. However, Qin Chong chose not to approach him. Instead, he turned away and continued browsing, deliberately avoiding the stall.

This wasn't Qin Chong's first visit to the market. He had come many times before to peruse jade slips—though only the less valuable ones were available for free browsing. Still, even those had greatly expanded his knowledge at the time. Yet, this was the first time he'd seen a family member running a stall here.

A quick scan with his spiritual sense revealed a variety of materials, some of decent quality. For a cultivator at the seventh layer of Qi Refinement like his uncle, acquiring such items wouldn't have been easy. Most were likely gathered by Qin Chong's father, Qin Hao. As the family's resource manager, his uncle bore the responsibility of maintaining their modest clan's operations through whatever means necessary.

With the family's elder in seclusion, Qin Chong's father shouldered most responsibilities. Keeping the Qin family afloat was no simple task. Having never ventured out before, Qin Chong had never truly grasped the hardships of cultivation life. Seeing his usually taciturn uncle reduced to street peddling stirred an unexpected pang of sorrow in his heart.

*I must cultivate diligently,* Qin Chong resolved. *I will help our family establish a proper shop in Pingyang City.*

Yet he knew opening a shop was no simple matter. Approval from the Canglong Valley sect was required, along with substantial annual spirit stone payments. Moreover, only those with recognized strength could qualify—something the Qin family currently lacked, unless they produced a late-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator. Even then, resources to sustain a shop would be an issue.

The six cultivation arts—alchemy, artifact forging, talisman crafting, formations, beast taming, and puppet mastery—were essential for shop operations. Without expertise in at least one, mere buying low and selling high wouldn't suffice. Currently, only Qin Chong's father and grand-uncle could barely produce low-grade pills, and even that barely met family needs. Mastering any of the six arts required tremendous resources.

This realization birthed another idea in Qin Chong's mind: joining a major sect like Canglong Valley. There, he could access better resources and learn the six arts. However, their recruitment only occurred every decade—likely still two or three years away. By then, if he reached the eighth or ninth layer of Qi Refinement, he might stand a chance despite his mediocre aptitude and advanced age.

Lost in thought, Qin Chong suddenly heard a familiar voice. To his surprise, it was Old Man Zhao Yin, also running a stall. Qin Chong approached but didn't greet him directly, instead examining the wares.

Zhao Yin's expression darkened upon seeing Qin Chong. As the young man silently inspected the items, the old man grew suspicious. "What are you up to now, you little rascal?" he finally asked through clenched teeth.

"Just browsing," Qin Chong replied innocently, though his teasing smile unsettled Zhao Yin further.

"Scram! Don't scare off my customers," Zhao Yin snapped, then added via sound transmission, "Meet me at Ningxiang Tower tonight. We'll talk then."

Satisfied, Qin Chong moved on. The crafty old man clearly understood what he wanted to discuss.

After an unfruitful market round, Qin Chong turned to the larger shops, where he could get better prices for surplus materials—though they might reject lower-grade items. He also needed combat gear—at least two superior-grade magical instruments—to ensure he could escape if confronted by late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators.

Most shops here belonged to Canglong Valley, but Qin Chong avoided them. Their reputation for bullying customers was well-earned. Instead, he chose Qingyun Pavilion, affiliated with the powerful Qingyun Trading Alliance.

"Welcome to Qingyun Pavilion," greeted a graceful attendant at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement. "How may I assist you?"

"I'd like to see your superior-grade magical instruments," Qin Chong said directly.

The attendant's eyebrows rose slightly—it was uncommon for a sixth-layer cultivator to seek such high-grade equipment. Most mid-stage Qi Refinement practitioners considered themselves fortunate to afford mid-grade items.
