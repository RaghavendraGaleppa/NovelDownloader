Chapter 331: The Wondrous Stone Pill

Li Xian sighed with emotion: "The creations of heaven and earth are endless. Strange and wondrous events emerge one after another. Whenever I think my knowledge has grown and I have glimpsed the ways of the world, a new novelty appears to tell me that my vision is still shallow and my eyes are short. This object is strange; we must be careful."

He saw the stone tripod standing tall. Inside the cave, colorful light flowed, illuminating the surroundings with scattered spots of light. Occasionally, the sound of a spring could be heard, tinkling and clear. It was quiet and leisurely, breathtakingly beautiful. He cautiously approached, taking only two steps before immediately retreating.

He had almost stepped on a venomous snake. The snake was brightly colored, its scales smooth and lustrous. It was extremely dangerous, yet also extremely exquisite. Li Xian’s vision was exceptionally sharp and should have detected it long ago. Yet, he had not noticed it just now. It was only at the moment he was about to place his foot down that the intuition of his [Perfect Physique] warned him, allowing him to narrowly avoid it.

Li Xian observed the side of the cave and immediately understood: "The colorful light flowing through this cave disturbs the eyes. Combined with the reflection of the snake scales and their趴伏 on the ground, they are extremely difficult to see. My experience is still shallow; I didn't anticipate this. Moreover, snakes love to hide in damp, hot caves. Although this place is relatively cool, it is warmer than other areas. By nature, they gather here to nest and breed."

He looked closer and saw that between the stone walls, in the crevices, and on the ceiling... venomous snakes were coiled and lying in wait. The dense clusters of snakes made one’s scalp tingle. Because the clusters were so dense, the snake bodies twisted and entangled, forming complex knots.

Li Xian moved with quick eyes and fast hands, using the "Cloud Chasing Hand" to catch snakes. He pinched the three-inch vital spot of a snake, observing the colorful venomous snake closely. He saw its fangs were sharp, and its venom was a pale yellow. Suddenly, he thought: "This venom might be useful. As for the snake meat, we have been eating wild vegetables and fruits for days; perhaps we can have some meat today!"

He threw the snake back. Treading lightly with his qinggong, he avoided the snake groups and safely arrived at the side of the stone tripod. The stone tripod was about a zhang high, milky white. From a distance, it looked like jade; up close, it was stone. Its appearance was coarse, shaped like a four-legged square tripod. Although it was hollow inside, it had no lid.

Li Xian drew his Green Sword and cut a lid. Inside was a "Small White Stone Pill," emitting a faint fragrance. Sniffing it refreshed the spirit, but looking at it was strange. Li Xian used his sword to lift it; the sword tilted upward, and the small pill rolled down the blade into his palm.

It was about the size of a knuckle. Touching it felt like stone or jade, with a hard texture. Li Xian pondered: "A stone pill born from a stone tripod. This pill is made of stone and not suitable for oral consumption. What exactly is its use? My knowledge is shallow. If the Madam were by my side, I could immediately ask her for clarification. But if she were by my side, how could I be safe?"

Thinking of the Madam's figure, his mood became complex. He said: "The Madam might be in the tomb treasure. If I encounter her, it would be a truly huge trouble."

Suddenly, he saw all the venomous snakes in the cave retreating in panic. His mind moved, and he held the pill close. The snakes avoided it as if they couldn't get away fast enough, deeply fearing the breath of the stone pill. So, the stone tripod contained a stone pill. The pill was not for "oral consumption," but for "visual consumption." Every time one looked at it, one secretly gained its medicinal effect.

Heaven and earth’s wondrous pills do not necessarily have to enter the stomach!

Stone pills gather the essence of heaven and earth, containing the creation of all things. They are catalyzed by wind and water and nurtured by the earth's veins, gathering all sorts of coincidences and fate. Like stone, like jade, like a bi-disc... they possess the wonderful effects of avoiding poison and solidifying life. Poisonous beasts retreat upon seeing them. Those whose lives are hanging by a thread... if they look at this pill, they can keep their life from fading. Even if their five organs are destroyed and their bodies rot, as long as they stare at this pill, they can maintain a spark of life and not count as dead. However, the longer one looks, the greater the danger of petrification.

This is the "Wall Dust Pill." The Nanong family's "Jade Avoiding True Sutra" records it; it is of great benefit to this technique, even a "match made by heaven." But the world is full of tricks. The Nanong family sought it bitterly but could not find its trace. Li Xian encountered it by chance and easily obtained it.

But Li Xian did not possess the true text of the "Jade Avoiding True Sutra," and what he knew was all from Nanong Qili's oral account. It was incomplete, so he did not know this object. But he was naturally intelligent. Thinking it over left and right, he understood the wonderful use of "avoiding poison." He thought: "Although I have 'Clear Qi' protecting me and am not afraid of poisonous mists or miasma, I have no way to deal with poisonous beasts and snakes. Obtaining this pill, if I encounter poisonous beasts or snakes in the future... it will naturally be useful. Once I escape this predicament, I can slowly study its uses."

Li Xian took out the Heaven and Earth Treasure Box and stored the 'Wall Pill.' Indeed, the snakes no longer fled. Snakes love warmth and even drilled into the tripod. Li Xian tiptoed, his footwork light as he leaped over. Seeing the stone tripod packed with snake bodies, he couldn't help but think:

"The feng shui here is strange. Since it can nurture a strange pill, perhaps it can also nurture a strange beast. Now that I have cut open the stone tripod, the snakes can enter it. If this goes on for a long time, won't it breed a Snake King?"

He then laughed: "To breed a Snake King would surely take hundreds or thousands of years. It is too far in the future. The urgent matter is to use your bodies to fill our stomachs first. I trouble you to suffer, and please take a tumble in hot soup and hot oil."

Li Xian vibrated the "Chest Drum Thunder." *Boom*, a muffled sound shook the room, and the snakes writhed in terror, fainting in droves. Li Xian wanted to vibrate it again, but suddenly saw dust falling and cracks spreading on the walls. He feared that vibrating the thunder again would cause a collapse.

He took out a personal sachel, the size of a palm, containing a woman's faint fragrance, embroidered with golden patterns, very exquisite. This item came from "Embroidery City's Luo Family," a gift from Luo Feiyan.

He grabbed the mouth of the sachel and shook it up and down three times. Each shake, the sachel grew a bit larger. After seven or eight shakes, the sachel expanded to a zhang long and a zhang wide, enough to hold three people. If he met a strong enemy and knew he couldn't win, he could even hide inside the sachel, using it like a thin layer of armor to protect his body. This small sachel contained the essence of the Luo Family's martial arts.

Li Xian was very pleased and thought silently: "Family items are naturally extraordinary. No wonder they stand unshaken and dominate a region; they truly cannot be underestimated." He put the fainted snakes into the bag. Li Xian used the "Breeze Leg" to sweep them, sending them *rustling* into the sachel. After several moves, all the snakes on the ground were in the bag.

Li Xian shook the sachel and thought: "Not enough yet. These snakes aren't enough to feed two hundred people.正好 my Cloud Chasing Hand hasn't been practiced for a long time. I'll use you all to practice."

He leaped up and drifted toward the wall. His hands moved like lightning, reaching into a pile of snakes. Between his fingers, he夹住了 three snakes each, precisely gripping their three-inch vital spots. The snakes twisted their bodies to struggle, but it was futile resistance. He slightly vibrated his Qi to knock the snake beasts unconscious and threw them into the sachel.

[You reached out to catch a snake, Proficiency +3]
[You reached out to catch a snake, Proficiency +4]

Li Xian caught a pile of snakes and pulled hard. The snake group guarded against him and struck to bite. Every time Li Xian reached out, dozens of snake mouths and nearly a hundred fangs would attack. His technique was exquisite and became more and more handy. He cleared out one pile of snakes and moved to another.

After half an incense stick of time, the sachel was packed full and heavy. Li Xian sealed the mouth. The Ghost Python Gun shot out from his sleeve, hanging the snake bag at the end, and he carried it away like this. His steps were fast, and soon he saw the traces of the women.

The women saw his figure and immediately gathered around. Mu Hongchou asked: "Brother Li, what is in that bag?" Li Xian laughed heartily: "Naturally, it is a great tonic."

Li Xian asked: "Did you find anything?" Li Xian had arranged things orderly. Mu Hongchou, Yi Qianqian, Luo Feiyan, and Lin Aoshan were in slightly better condition and had stronger strength. He had ordered the four to walk a few steps ahead to scout the surroundings and report back if they found anything unusual.

Mu Hongchou, Yi Qianqian, and Luo Feiyan had no gains. Lin Aoshan found an orchard of unknown fruit, unsure if it was toxic. She asked Elders Zhao Chunxia and Tang Mengluo to inspect it. Finding it non-toxic but astringent, it could barely fill the stomach and warm the stomach. She then led a dozen or so women to pick them.

At this time, the sky was gradually darkening. The women were hesitating, worried that Li Xian had not returned, feeling flustered and uneasy. They were just about to send someone to look for him when Li Xian happened to return, and the women settled down.

The few exchanged brief updates. Li Xian said: "Today, we might have some meat!" The women were delighted to hear this. Lin Aoshan asked curiously: "This bag is so big, did you hunt a wild boar?"

Li Xian smiled: "Better than wild boar." Yi Qianqian said: "Could it be a mountain deer? It doesn't look like it."

Li Xian said mysteriously: "You will know soon. Ladies, I have a favor to ask. Please go ask among the various sects who has a sister with a clever mind and deft hands. Ask her to come here to help."

The women heard him call "sister" intimately and naturally, and their hearts hid some joy. But hearing him call "sister" to everyone, they couldn't help feeling disappointed.

Soon, dozens of people came to help. Li Xian untied the sachel, revealing the dense snake beasts, with their colorful scales and sharp fangs. The women stepped back in fright, but having endured capture, imprisonment, and escape along the way... their hearts had been tempered, and they quickly calmed themselves. Li Xian explained: "I found a cave with venomous snakes inside. I was also frightened, but I thought that snake meat is delicious. If we cook snake soup and snake dishes, it would be a rare delicacy, so I caught them all. Ladies, please don't be too frightened. We are in a dangerous place, our lives hang by a thread. What is there to fear from a mere snake beast? Please help me collect the venom and put it in bottles. Then, peel the snake skins, take the snake guts, bury the pot, and start a fire... Today we will eat snake soup, I guarantee we can eat to our heart's content."

The women heard his gentle voice. Although they were resistant to snake beasts, they were willing to help. They grabbed snakes to extract venom, then peeled skins and took guts... the division of labor was clear and very fast.

Tang Mengluo, Zhao Chunxia, Peng Sanluo, He Lijun... and other elders also尽力 to help. The women from various sects had different temperaments, and it was not easy to unite their hearts. It was inevitable that they would harbor resentment and secretly form cliques to exclude others. Li Xian commanded the women and was able to avoid this hidden danger. Li Xian was neither from the five sects nor did he have great prestige. He was usually easy-going and gentle, yet不失 decisive and strict. Punishment for faults, reward for merit.

With the support of the elders from the various sects, the hearts of the "ranks" were united. The elders took this opportunity to teach the disciples martial arts, integrating sword techniques into "extracting snake venom, peeling snake skins, and taking snake guts."

The women pooled their wisdom and were in high spirits, creating a set of sword techniques: "Skin Peeling Sword Art." Although it was only in its infancy, it was fierce with killing intent, tricky and sharp... the sword stance was fast and fierce. Tang Mengluo held a wooden stick and demonstrated it publicly. Her posture was graceful and curvaceous, combining sword and waist, her sword stance was extremely moving, like a snake and scorpion beauty sucking the marrow from the bone.

This sword technique secretly combined the five sword schools, though it was very basic. But every move was quite profound. Although it was not yet perfected and had many flaws, Li Xian watched silently from the side and memorized it. He thought: "Martial arts in the world are nothing more than this. I will remember it well. If I have free time in the future, this 'Skin Peeling Sword Art' is quite worth practicing and studying."

Yang Piaoxue said: "Today we peel snake skins and take snake venom; tomorrow we kill enemies and destroy thieves."

When the snake beasts were all skinned, Li Xian personally cooked the snake soup. He put wild fruits and wild vegetables... to good use, throwing them into the pot, showing his culinary skills. The fruit tasted strange, the snake meat was fishy, the wild vegetables tasted odd... but with seasoning, heat control, and technique, they became delicious dishes.

This day, the snake soup warmed the body, the snake broth moistened the body, and the snake meat filled the stomach. In the cold snow and dark gorge, firelight scattered, creating a unique scenery.

After eating and drinking their fill, the women sang folk songs and told interesting stories... connecting their feelings, and then orderly went to sleep. In a private tent, Li Xian lit a lamp and pondered, drawing the terrain of the gorge. Zhao Chunxia brought the snake venom, all stored in jade bottles, and asked: "What is the use of this snake venom?"

Li Xian said: "This place is strange and unpredictable. Even if we walk out of the gorge, we might encounter the soldiers of Flying Dragon City again. They are proficient in formations, have deep experience, and have trained together for a long time. I take the snake venom to coat the arrowheads, which will be the icing on the cake. If we meet a strong enemy, we can naturally shoot them with poisoned arrows."

Zhao Chunxia's beautiful eyes stared fixedly. Along the way, she often observed Li Xian. Seeing him arrange things properly, think things through thoroughly, and make decisions accurately and decisively, possessing both courage and wisdom, she felt increasingly strange, actually gradually developing admiration and worship. She smiled: "You are indeed thoughtful. You have no connection to my sword sect, yet you trouble yourself to save us. Along the way, you have exhausted yourself, and you are the most tired. I really... don't know how to thank you."

Li Xian laughed: "Righteous deeds, why speak of thanks? Senior Zhao Chunxia, please rest well and recover your strength as soon as possible. Wouldn't that make you a stronger backing for me?"

Zhao Chunxia smiled and agreed, then suddenly said: "I have asked the sword sect disciples to boil hot water. You have worked hard for a day; shall I wash your feet for you?" Li Xian was startled and said strangely: "How dare I, how dare I. I am full of energy and don't need my feet washed." He thought in his heart: "I met her by chance at the Visiting Immortal Inn in the past, and she almost killed me. Now meeting again, she actually wants to wash my feet. This is really strange."

Zhao Chunxia said: "Even if you are full of energy, you need to rest and need someone to take care of you. You saved my life; it is natural for me to wash your feet for you."

Li Xian saw there was no avoiding it. Seeing Zhao Chunxia with her head lowered and face red, her eyes containing autumn waves, her long hair simply tied up, possessing a mature charm. He thought: "This Senior Zhao Chunxia is truly a good person who knows how to repay kindness. Her washing my feet should be a way to repay the favor. Well, this is a favor given by the flow of water; why let it hang in the heart for too long?" He said: "Then, alright!"

The next day, they set off again. The women looked refreshed and were in high spirits. They walked for about half a day. Suddenly, the path ahead forked, one going left and one going west. Li Xian pondered: "At forks in the tomb path, one must be careful." He ordered Mu Hongchou and Yi Qianqian to scout the left and right forks respectively. Each held a strand of hair; if there was a situation, the hair would react and let them know.

After a while, the two women returned from their investigation and reported the situation. The right fork was covered in marshes, growing strange flowers and plants, with nowhere to step, desolate to the extreme. Aside from plants, there were no other living things. The left fork was spacious and flat, but there were black holes in the mountain walls, from which came the sound of "huffing" breath. Mu Hongchou went to investigate and saw that they were sleeping lizard beasts, huge in size. And there were many of them; if they poured out of their nests, it would be extremely dangerous!

Li Xian faced a choice. He thought: "The right path is full of marshes. Although there is nowhere to step, we all have qinggong, so deep wading should be no problem. However... this path is desolate, with scarce life, and might hide other dangers, making it hard to discover. Even if it doesn't hide dangers, along the path supplies are lacking. If we can't walk out for several days, we will inevitably fall into a dilemma. The left path has giant lizards, looks dangerous, and is indeed dangerous, but the danger is visible. As long as we find a way to solve it, there is a better chance of survival."

He told his thoughts to the elders and disciples. Zhao Chunxia, Tang Mengluo, and others had originally thought to go right to avoid the lizards. But hearing Li Xian's analysis, they all felt it made sense. They even thought: "This young man's thinking is unique; he is truly a rare talent!"

They all agreed to go left.

Li Xian asked: "Sister Mu, do you recognize the species of the lizard beast? If you know the species, you know its habits. Then, according to its habits, we can avoid the danger."

Mu Hongchou "ah"ed, apologizing: "I... I didn't think of that layer. Seeing this lizard beast breathe like a tiger roaring, it was quite startling, so I retreated to report."

Li Xian said: "Sister Mu, trouble you to go again and look at the lizard beast's appearance clearly. If possible, try to draw it." Mu Hongchou said: "Okay!" Holding paper and pen, her figure was light, and in a few leaps she was gone.

Heshan Sword Sect's He Lijun sighed with relief: "Suffering this calamity, Hongchou's temper has become more steady!"

After a while, Mu Hongchou returned to the camp, having drawn the lizard beast's appearance. Li Xian handed the drawing to the elders to view. Zhao Chunxia, Peng Sanluo... did not recognize it. Tang Mengluo looked at it for a moment and recognized this type of "lizard beast," named "Giant Tiger Lizard."

This lizard is fierce in temperament and very sensitive to blood Qi. Its speed is incredibly fast, and its cry is like a tiger's roar or a wolf's howl. Its strength is immense. It originally lived among the cliffs of the "Southern Frontier" mountains. Tang Mengluo had been to the Southern Frontier and encountered this type of lizard, so she recognized it.

The Giant Tiger Lizard has poor eyesight but a keen sense of smell. Li Xian gradually formed a strategy. He, Mu Hongchou, Lin Aoshan, and Luo Feiyan stole some Giant Tiger Lizard feces. They started a fire and boiled the feces in a pot.

They placed their clothes over the pot to熏 them with the foul smell. Then they wore these clothes to cross the fork in the road. The women blushed with shame, but they didn't mind the small details and changed into the foul-smelling clothes. That night, they stepped onto the forked path.

Walking several miles, they indeed saw countless holes in the mountain walls on both sides. Looking up lightly, there were hundreds or thousands... if they provoked the holes, the lizards would pour out like a storm. Even with supreme martial arts, the only option would be to flee.

From the lizard caves came the sounds of "tiger roars and wolf howls," rising and falling, loud and echoing. The women were terrified and walked cautiously. Li Xian occasionally spoke to comfort them.

They walked until midnight. Suddenly, a "clicking" sound was heard. The Giant Tiger Lizards came out of their caves one after another, their sharp claws扣进 the walls, hanging sideways on the mountain walls to move. The larger the body, the higher the cave it lived in.

Mu Hongchou suddenly covered her mouth and nose, her eyes wide with shock, her body trembling, pointing to the high mountain wall. They saw a Giant Tiger Lizard nearly twenty zhang long, its body like rock, its tail like a mountain peak, hanging sideways on the mountain wall. It breathed like a sudden wind, a foul smell tickling their noses.

Li Xian thought: "It's not as good as Senior Ao Mo. If I had seen this beast for the first time, I would surely have been extremely frightened. But having seen the sea dragon, this kind of lizard beast cannot shock me." He said in a deep voice: "Don't panic, we will walk slowly." Going deeper along the path, Li Xian counted the caves, a total of forty-nine thousand eight hundred and seventy-two.

Suddenly, a "thumping" sound was heard, and the ground shook frequently. They saw two Giant Tiger Lizards on a distant mountain wall fighting over a cave, scratching and biting each other. They entangled and rolled down from the mountain wall, hitting other Giant Tiger Lizards along the way. This caused a mess ahead, with dozens of Giant Tiger Lizards fighting chaotically, raising clouds of dust.

Li Xian ordered each group to watch their companions. They tried to gather into a ball and rest on the spot. The deeper the night, the more violent the nature of the Giant Tiger Lizards. Behind them came the "thumping" sound of lizards fighting again.

In this way, the path ahead and behind were blocked. The women trembled, at a loss. Li Xian ordered them to wait quietly on the spot and act according to the situation. They stayed awake all night. Until the next morning, the lizards stopped fighting, and the survivors crawled back into their caves.

There were hundreds of lizard corpses along the path. Li Xian said: "Be extremely careful not to step on the blood of the Giant Tiger Lizards." The women raised their spirits to the maximum, avoiding the lizard corpses and moving slowly.

The next night, the lizards came out of their caves to move again. Although there were occasional fights, they were resolved on the rock walls and did not cause a large-scale melee. Li Xian held his mind firm, calm and composed, dealing with all sorts of strange situations.

At noon that day, the lizard caves along the way gradually decreased. After walking another half hour, they slowly left the danger zone. The women hugged each other and wept with joy. Li Xian also wiped away a great deal of cold sweat. To be safe, they walked another dozen miles before resting.

There was no snow here. It seemed they had passed the "Ten Thousand Lizard Path" and entered the heart chamber of the Nine Apertures Dragon Heart Cave. Li Xian spat out clear Qi, eliminating all the foul stench.

The women all gathered around Li Xian, feeling very dependent on him, letting him make the next decision. Li Xian pondered: "Rest for a day, then go further inside! There will surely be more dangers later, but we have endured hardships and are no longer what we used to be. A mere trial cannot harm us."

Tang Mengluo sincerely admired: "Brother Li is exceptionally resolute and wise. If my sword sect disciples could learn one or two percent of it, that would be a great joy."

The women said: "I'm afraid it's difficult. Brother Li's spirit and strategy are not something others can imitate." "Although I am a disciple of the sword sect, to be fair, my senior and junior brothers have decent talent, but in terms of temperament and character, they are immediately inferior." "I used to think that my senior brother was the model of a talented man, but now... perhaps my senior brother is still the model, but Brother Li..."

The women chattered on. Li Xian was naturally modest and quickly stopped them. The women feared he would be displeased and stopped mentioning it, but they had already made a judgment in their hearts. They all thought: "Feasts and banquets can make friends, but a man's elegance and demeanor are best reflected in dangerous situations. A man doesn't necessarily need to be exceptionally handsome, but being able to stand alone and remain calm in the face of matters is what matters most."

At this time, they ignored his appearance and figure, all won over by his demeanor. There was no distinction between day and night here. After resting for half an hour, Li Xian faintly heard the sound of a bell shaking. There was no path ahead, so he followed the sound of the bell.

The road went straight ahead; there was no other path to take. After walking for about half an hour, the road suddenly stopped, blocked by a fifteen-zhang-high jade wall. In front of the jade wall was a stone tablet with the words "Reflection Cliff" written on it.

Lin Aoshan asked curiously: "This jade wall is about fifteen zhang high. Compared to other mountain walls, it seems a bit short. With qinggong, it would be easy to climb over. How can it make people reflect?"

Li Xian said: "There might be a trick?" He observed carefully but saw nothing wrong. Lin Aoshan said: "Little Li, I will use qinggong and try to go up. You are smart and alert, just back me up."

Li Xian said: "Okay!" Lin Aoshan stepped on her qinggong and leaped up, easily rising several zhang. When she stepped on the jade wall, preparing to borrow force to leap again, she suddenly felt the bottom of her foot slip. The jade wall was extremely smooth, with nothing to borrow force from.

Lin Aoshan turned in mid-air, her body like a dragon, and thought: "It's only a dozen zhang high. Even if there is nowhere to borrow force, I can cross it purely with qinggong." She rose another few zhang in the air, still having room to spare.

Just as she was about to force her way over, her expression suddenly changed. Her lightness vanished completely, and she fell from a high place. Li Xian used "Xun Wind Breath," combined with the iron lung characteristic of "Iron Copper Body," and blew a gust of fierce wind.

He supported her body, preventing her from falling. Lin Aoshan barely steadied herself and let out a long breath. She said: "Little Li, did you hear any sound?"

Li Xian said: "The bell sound? I have been faintly hearing it since just now. It ripples faintly every ten breaths or so. I find it strange." Lin Aoshan said: "It's the bell sound, I heard it too. But when I leaped to seven or eight zhang, the bell sound suddenly became louder, and my heart seemed to stop. Then my internal Qi was gone, and my martial arts seemed to失效... No... not失效, it's that they had their form but couldn't manifest their effects."

Li Xian said in a deep voice: "There is such a thing? Let me try!" He stepped on the Seven Star Step and tried to jump over the Reflection Cliff. After leaping to seven or eight zhang, he indeed heard the bell sound coming from afar. His martial arts manifestations disappeared, and the internal Qi in his body instantly vanished. He fell straight down.

The women hurried to help, but Li Xian was already prepared. He used the "Light Formula," his body as light as a feather. After landing, his whole body shook, but he was not injured.

After the bell shook, the anomaly immediately disappeared, extremely strange.

Li Xian drew his Green Sword and hacked at the jade wall. He couldn't leave a single scratch. He said: "So that's how it is. This wall looks light and easy to pass, but it is actually like a natural moat. The jade wall is smooth and solid, with nowhere to borrow force from. Without relying on martial arts, who could lightly jump over a wall more than ten zhang high? The design of this place is frustrating and truly sinister."

The women hurriedly asked: "Brother Li, what do we do now? Do we turn back?"

Li Xian smiled: "Why turn back? He forgot that we have many people!" He flicked his sleeve and the gun shot out, the Ghost Python Gun looking fierce and divine. He said: "Those among you with better qinggong, stand on my gun. Then have others stand on your shoulders, piling up seven or eight people. Sister Hongchou, you stand at the very top, then use qinggong to leap over the jade wall in one breath."

The women's eyes lit up upon hearing this, thinking Li Xian's strange plans were endless. The women with the best qinggong immediately stepped onto the gun body, stepped onto shoulders... piling up very high. Li Xian's strength was immense, and the women's bodies were light, so naturally, there was no problem.

But the woman standing on the gun body found it hard to support. So only seven or eight people stood, about five zhang off the ground. Li Xian threw them with great force, and the women were flung into the air, screaming in shock.

Mu Hongchou stood at the top. The woman below her borrowed force to push her, allowing her to use her qinggong to float up lightly, her rising momentum strong. Even though the bell shook, dissolving the manifestation of martial arts and the use of internal Qi, the momentum was already formed. She still drifted toward the top of the cliff.

Her eyes shone. Seeing the jade top in front, she twisted her body in mid-air, adjusting her posture. Her waist was slender, her red skirt eye-catching, her long hair thick, like she was dancing. The rising momentum gradually faded, her speed slowed, and she got closer and closer to the top of the cliff. She reached out to grab the edge of the top, but the jade was slippery, and she accidentally slipped and fell, plummeting down.

Li Xian used the same trick again to save Mu Hongchou. He said: "Let's do it again. This time I will use more force." He repeated the trick, and this time there was no mistake. Mu Hongchou leaped onto the top of the cliff.

She threw down a "snake skin rope," which was obtained from peeling snakes several days ago. She threw it down to the bottom of the cliff. Li Xian, Zhao Chunxia, Lin Aoshan... climbed up one after another, passing another southern pass.

The bell rang faintly. Every time it rang, everyone who heard it felt as if they had returned to an ordinary mortal body. Li Xian followed the sound of the bell and vaguely saw a towering hall.

Li Xian said: "Since we have arrived here, there is only one path to the dark end!" He led the women forward.

He did not know that the hall was extremely lively inside. The young heroes of the five sword sects, elders, He Wentian, Wen Caishang... were all there!
