# Chapter 66: A Blade of Grass, Cleaving the Sun, Moon, and Stars! Li Mo: "What has she comprehended now?"

Just as the Ice Lump still didn't know how she was supposed to lose, Li Mo was in his room. He finished refining the notes he had just copied, adding his recent conclusions at the end. After completing all this, he looked at the paper, the four words "skill close to Dao" echoing in his mind.

"For others, this might be a dead end with no visible conclusion."

The night breeze was gentle, causing the candlelight to flicker faintly in Li Mo's pupils. Having spent a long time with Princess Xiaojiang and the Ice Lump, he deeply understood that those bearing the Mandate of Heaven all possessed extraordinary talent and walked unconventional paths. The conventional path was too long. But for an 'ordinary person' like him, it was the only way out. The difference was that with the presence of Martial Dao Insight, he could rocket forward on this ordinary path.

"In the future, I'll invest any extra Martial Dao Insight into swordsmanship," Li Mo thought. Hammer techniques naturally needed to be his main focus; there was no need to elaborate on that. Beyond hammer techniques were movement techniques, mental techniques, and body hardening. Only after these areas reached their current peak could he consider swordsmanship. After all, both Destiny's Daughters by his side were unparalleled prodigies in swordsmanship. It would be a waste not to learn. Moreover, if he remained a swordsmanship novice, it would be difficult to interact with them.

"Speaking of Martial Dao Insight."

"How much do I have now?"

Li Mo checked. Martial Dao Insight remaining: 71 years. This was a lot for hammer techniques, but too little for swordsmanship. It was a bittersweet situation. After a moment of thought, Li Mo decided: "Let's claim the rewards first." Investing in Princess Xiaojiang and his recent discussion of Dao with Ying Bing had both brought him rewards.

*I am not a genius of the sword, merely a porter of truth. Then, I make a tiny profit in between...*

[Congratulations to Host for discussing Dao with 'Ying Bing' and providing a summary for her sword Dao theory.]
[Investment Feedback: Martial Dao Insight 60 years.]

[Congratulations to Host for helping 'Jiang Chulong' recover her body and repair her foundation.]
[Investment Feedback: Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk (one bottle).]

[Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk]: "Consuming a single drop can extend a common person's lifespan by twenty years, making them immune to all poisons, free from illness, and greatly increasing their physical strength. It is a material for refining longevity pills and a sacred item for tempering vital qi and blood."

The Ice Lump truly lived up to her name. With Martial Dao Insight, she exploded a full sixty years. In the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, many ordinary people couldn't even live to be sixty. Princess Xiaojiang hadn't disappointed him either. Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk was something Li Mo had never heard of before. Perhaps it had appeared in the Eastern Desolation Region, but it must have been a rare treasure whose news rarely spread. After all, anything that extended life was usually kept for personal use by whoever obtained it.

Which of the two was more precious? Li Mo believed they were roughly equivalent in the System's definition. Ying Bing's Mandate of Heaven level was higher, but the recent discussion actually didn't help her much; it was merely better than nothing. However, the medicinal pill he invested in could allow Jiang Chulong to recover from her injuries and repair her foundation.

Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk...

"I was just worrying that the speed of condensing my meridians was getting slower and slower."

"Ordinary Earth Vein Spirit Milk doesn't have much effect on me anymore."

Li Mo hadn't expected it. After the twenty-four meridians, condensing meridians became hellishly difficult. Even maintaining the unity of heaven and man at every moment, the speed was no different from a tortoise's crawl.

"If this Mystic Yin Immortal Physique appeared on anyone else, it would simply be a bottomless pit."

"Who knows how many years it would take to even break through the Qi-Blood Realm."

Li Mo opened the jade bottle, and the pure essence of the Earth Vein Spirit Milk wafted to his nose. To avoid damaging the room, he ventured out in the dark to the waterfall not far from Autumn Water Pavilion. First, he dug a pool the size of a bathtub, filled it with water, and then poured a single drop of the Ten-Thousand-Year Earth Vein Spirit Milk into it. Then, he picked up the bottle and took a small sip. Anything produced by the System was guaranteed to be a premium product. Ninety-nine percent purity, a rare treasure. With both external application and internal consumption, the energy immediately surged within him.

"I hope my Internal Breath Realm cultivation is worth this hardship..."

Li Mo stepped into the pool.

...

The next day.

Inside the World Seed.

"The so-called Way of the Sword, is nothing more than three realms."

"The first realm, is that of sword techniques and sword methods..."

The esteemed Yuanshi Tianzun Lord was expounding the Dao. Jiang Chulong was still wearing her tattered clothes, though they were now clean, and her small face was free of dirt. She sat obediently at the table, her small hands folded together, her grey-white eyes gleaming with unusual brilliance.

Our esteemed Tianzun Lord was all about vivid descriptions, not only speaking but also presenting with visual aids.

"The second realm is having no sword in hand, but a sword in heart."

"With sword qi in your chest, sword intent in your heart, and then leveraging the grand momentum of heaven and earth, at that point, a single blade of grass can cleave the sun, moon, and stars!"

His voice was awe-inspiring, calm yet imbued with boundless霸氣!

"A blade of grass, cleaving the sun, moon, and stars?!" Jiang Chulong's small mouth parted slightly. Historical records stated that of the three suns in the sky, two were transformed from the ancestors of the Yu Dynasty emperors, including Emperor Taizu Wu of Great Yu. They were all peerless powerhouses who had dominated their eras and proven themselves invincible. Could they... be destroyed by a tiny blade of grass? This was simply... too far beyond her imagination.

"Hehehe..." The teacher seemed to sense the doubt in her eyes and chuckled softly. With a casual wave of his hand, a blade of grass, appearing from who knows where, was caught between his fingertips. He waved it gently. Limitless sword qi tore through the firmament. World-shattering sword intent shattered galaxies. Every trace swept away all creation. That sword intent, sword qi, and sword momentum were all reflected in Jiang Chulong's grey-white eyes. Neither she nor even Li Mo himself noticed it, but something was sprouting wildly in her heart, like a weed...

"As for the third realm..."

...

An incense stick later, the Tianzun's Swordsmanship Mini-Class concluded.

"I trust that with your comprehension, you have understood everything."

"Mhm mhm! Teacher is so amazing..." Jiang Chulong clapped her small hands, her dirty little face full of adoration. The things she had vaguely understood but didn't know how to name, were they called sword qi, sword momentum, sword intent? But... a blade of grass cleaving stars? She had never imagined that those things could achieve such a feat! But since Teacher said it was possible, then it must be! It was just that she was too weak now, and her understanding of the Way of the Sword was not deep enough...

...

Ziyang Prefecture City.

"A blade of grass, cleaving the sun, moon, and stars!"

Mudhorn Alley. The calm yet domineering words still echoed in her ears. Jiang Chulong slowly awoke, the boundless sword intent seemingly still not having faded from her eyes. She smeared dirt on her face again and wrapped a strip of tattered cloth around her eyes. Picking up a dried branch from the ground, she practiced diligently in the courtyard. She wanted to become stronger... For her mother. To not disappoint her teacher...

*Swish—*

Her slender arm held the gnarled dried branch, yet her face was utterly serious. To an outsider, she might simply look like a small beggar playing idly. However, the weeds and leaves in the dilapidated courtyard began to stir without any wind.

...

Qingyuan Sect.

Li Mo looked at the newly credited Martial Dao rewards from the System and fell into contemplation.

"Ermmmmmm..."

"What has she comprehended *now*?"

"If I actively ask, will it make my Yuanshi Tianzun persona seem less prestigious?"

"Hm, next time I'll say it's a test." Li Mo once again silently praised his own wit. Being a middleman isn't easy either. And just like that, Princess Xiaojiang had more questions... filling three entire pages.

Just as Li Mo was searching for the Ice Lump in the courtyard, a woman cautiously peered over the wall of Autumn Water Pavilion.

"Master?" It was none other than Shang Wu.

"My precious disciple, you're back? Good thing you ran into me first."

"Stay here any longer, and you'll die!" Shang Wu whispered, her almond-shaped eyes full of vigilance.

"Huh?" Li Mo was utterly bewildered.

"No time to explain! Little Bing'er has recently become obsessed with cooking!"

"Quick, follow me, your Master!" Shang Wu was extremely serious.

Li Mo: "..."

*Guess when I got back? I was wondering where Master had been for the past two days. As the saying goes, there's always a bigger fish. Even Master, who fears nothing, has moments of caution.*
