# Chapter 360: A Glimpse of Passion, Returning Home (1/2)

On the Somersault Cloud, the System’s text floated silently in the void.

**[Would you like to proceed with the extraction now?]**

“......”

Ying Bing subconsciously lowered her gaze, her eyes reflecting the figure of the "gentleman" Li Mo not far away.

As if sensing her thoughts, the System spoke again.

**[Correct, no need to doubt. Since the host ranked first last time, the penalty conditions will be extracted from the mind of the one who ranked first previously.]**

To put it bluntly.

It was still those... those images from the "Gentleman" Li Mo’s mind... the ones that opened the doors to a new world. If any of them were drawn...

The temperature of the "Ice Cube," which had just gone down, began to rise again.

However.

It had to be done sooner or later.

Before the geniuses of the Hidden Dragon List gathered in the Imperial Capital, she had to become one of the top three on the list. Those ranked higher on the list were not easy to deal with—the Holy Son of the Demon Summoning Sect, the Wonderful Immortal of the Heavenly Derivation Sect, the God Sword of Calamity, the Star Child of Penglai. The strength gap between these geniuses was actually very small, and each backed a major force with unfathomable foundations.

She and Li Mo were situated among them, indicating that in the eyes of the Heavenly Derivation Sect, their strength was very close.

Then there was the existence that stood alone among all geniuses—Crown Prince of the Great Yu.

In her previous life, she had defeated this person at exactly twenty years old, the age of twenty, when she had achieved the Nine Apertures of the Divine Observer realm.

Now, it was three years earlier.

**[Extracting the next penalty condition for the host...]**

As the thought fell, a light screen identical to the last one appeared, with various images flashing within it.

The scene was a somewhat dark room. There was light, but it wasn't shining from above; rather, it came from... the ground? The light was pink...

Was that a bed? But it was clearly filled with water. Who fills a bed with water?

On top of it was a woman dressed unlike anyone from the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths. Her eyes were covered with a cloth, different from Princess Jiang; it was black.

Oh, and she was tied up. It was tied in a way similar to Senior Brother Ouyang's style...

“Is this penalty about escaping?”

A hint of curiosity appeared on Ying Bing's cold, quiet face.

What kind of penalty was this?

“Is the Ice Cube spacing out?”

Li Mo was eating a spiritual fruit meant to nourish the soul. It was a bit like a watermelon, crisp and delicious, but the lack of ice was a slight flaw.

Well, the "Gentleman" Li Mo truly didn't know that the learning material folder in his mind had already been revealed to the world...

Ahem, saying "revealed to the world" might not be entirely accurate, after all, only the Ice Cube saw it.

If he saw it, he would probably exclaim: *‘Damn, a uniform...’*

“Hmm?”

Li Mo's gaze shifted downward, noticing that her slender, fair fingers were pinching the hem of her skirt, clenching it into a tight ball.

She seemed very uncomfortable, almost in pain.

What was going on?

**[Penalty Option 1: The Do-As-One-Pleases in the Secret Room.]**

“......”

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled slightly, deep ripples stirring in her eyes. The tree wished to be still, but the wind would not stop.

Where did he see these things?

Perhaps it was because the two of them had just acted together, she subconsciously replaced the male and female leads in the System's images with the Best Actor and Best Actress of the Clear Abyss Sect.

It turned out that having too much imagination wasn't a good thing...

The images continued.

This time, it was a riverside park at sunset. A man and a woman sat on a bench, bathed in the twilight. The woman sat in the man's lap, her head buried in his shoulder. Her movements were like a violent storm, gnawing with a *squelching* sound, as if they were fighting.

A moment later, the woman raised her head, acting shyly:

“What is that thing? It's poking me.”

And the man's neck was already covered in a large patch of red marks.

The Ice Cube's eyes reflected all of this.

The Empress of the Phoenix received a tiny shock from the period of passionate love.

---

She had never seen these things.

The Osmanthus Palace was hardly different from the Green L Clan's territory, perhaps even more so. The Green L Clan waited for their destined ones, while the disciples of the Osmanthus Palace followed their Palace Master in transcending the mortal world.

What were romantic feelings compared to the pursuit of the Dao with a pure heart?

**[Penalty Option 2: Planting Forty-Nine Strawberries.]**

“Is... is this normal?”

The Cold Fairy's gaze lost its focus slightly. She truly didn't know.

But these were the thoughts of the "Gentleman" Li Mo.

“Ice Cube, what are you muttering about?”

At this moment, her shoulder was gently pushed. Ying Bing subconsciously turned her head and saw him looking at her with concern. His Adam's apple moved slightly, as if he had just swallowed something...

The images that had just been suppressed surged into her mind again.

Ying Bing's heart suddenly felt a bit itchy. The sensation followed her blood to her fingertips, making her fingers curl unconsciously.

“No wonder the underwear you bought were like that.”

“Ahem, those were local styles from the South Frontier. The shopkeeper insisted...”

The "Gentleman" Li Mo was still being stubborn.

Ying Bing raised her eyes, tucking a strand of hair behind her ear:

“When I passed by, I heard the shopkeeper say a gentleman from the Central Plains was there, talking all about 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'.”

“......”

Under her deep, quiet gaze, the "Gentleman" Li Mo swallowed hard.

Why did it always feel like the Ice Cube could see right through his heart?

He quickly straightened his expression and pointed into the distance:

“Ice Cube, we're almost there. Look, is that our house?”

“Mm.”

Although Ying Bing didn't recognize the way, she still nodded lightly.

She wanted to act as if nothing had happened, but the System's penalty extraction wasn't over yet.

**[Displaying Penalty Option 3 for the host...]**

...

At dusk.

The Somersault Cloud passed over thousands of mountains and rivers, finally leaving the South Frontier and arriving in the East Wilderness, which was closest to the South Frontier.

From high in the sky, one could see the many rivers of the water system and the orderly buildings along the banks.

Ahead lay Qinghe County.

Before the Somersault Cloud even landed, a huge banner could be seen hanging there.

**[Congratulations to the Li Family's Children for reaching the Hidden Dragon List and ranking in the Top Five!]**

Extravagant. Way too extravagant.

“What Li Family's children?”

Li Mo felt something was off and turned to Ying Bing. “Ice Cube, you don't have the surname Li.”

Ying Bing clutched the big-headed doll, not looking at him, and it was unclear if she heard him.

“It isn't the end of the month...”

Little Li Mo found it strange.

Was the Ice Cube feeling homesick?

Seeing the banner, Li Mo decided to just go straight home. If he and the Ice Cube appeared on the street, it would likely be troublesome.

He didn't want to be surrounded by onlookers, but since they were all locals, if they asked about his well-being or asked for help, he couldn't just act aloof.

He simply landed with Ying Bing directly in his own courtyard.

But things didn't go as planned.

Even if he didn't go out wandering around, the house wasn't peaceful. The main hall was bustling with noise and activity; it happened to be dinner time, looking like a banquet.

“Big Dragon Nephew, our old Li family's ancestral grave is smoking with green smoke! We've produced a genius on the Hidden Dragon List!”

“We haven't visited each other for a long time. Ah, Li Mo, when I held you as a baby, you even peed on me. In the blink of an eye, you're such a big lad.”

“Back then, I thought it was someone with the same name. Who would have thought?”

“Xiao Mozi and Xiao Bing'er, are your relationship still the same as before?”

“Do you two still fight?”

...
