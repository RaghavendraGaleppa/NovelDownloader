# Chapter 27: Coercion

"Restoring the Agile Pill will be quite difficult. For now, I should focus on cultivating my techniques, with pill formula restoration as a secondary task!"

Chen Fei pondered for a moment, putting the pill formula matter aside for later. It wasn't that it wasn't important, but rather that it was the most challenging. Given that all three—cultivation, technique mastery, and pill formula restoration—contributed equally to his strength improvement, his choice became clear.

Time flew by. Chen Fei spent his days in the medical hall refining pills, though not very often. After making about a few batches of Qi-Blood Pills, he would stop. His main focus then shifted to improving the proficiency of his Immortal's Guidance technique, as this was the most direct way to enhance his combat strength. Once Immortal's Guidance reached Grand Completion, Chen Fei’s ultimate move would be fully formed.

Fortunately, finger-flicking was indeed a simple task, primarily testing one's hand speed. In just two days, Chen Fei had cultivated Immortal's Guidance to its peak.

[Technique: Immortal's Guidance (Grand Completion)]

"Whoosh!"

In the courtyard, a sword qi flashed, and a hole appeared silently in the rockery. Chen Fei calmly sheathed his sword, walked over to inspect the hole, and a smile involuntarily appeared on his face.

"Manager Chen, Manager Chen, are you there?"

Liu Jun’s voice rang out from outside the door. Chen Fei, feeling a little puzzled, opened the door to see Liu Jun standing there, panting.

"I heard Manager Zhang has a very good relationship with the Young Miss," Liu Jun whispered.

Chen Fei nodded slightly. Their relationship was likely indeed extraordinary, otherwise, she wouldn't have been put in charge of the North City Medical Hall. However, having just fled to Pingyin County and now taking over as manager, the North City Medical Hall was likely in for a busy time.

"Before I came, I looked at the medical hall's ledgers. The profits are far from matching those of Qingzheng Medical Hall. I won't pursue what happened in the past, but from now on, I hope we can catch up, or even surpass Qingzheng Medical Hall."

As soon as he stepped into the medical hall, a voice rang out. Chen Fei looked up to see Zhang Yuezhen staring intently at everyone present, her imposing aura suppressing them all.

"Alright, everyone return to your posts. If I need anything, I will speak with you individually!"

Zhang Yuezhen waved her hand, and the subordinates scattered as if granted a great pardon.

"Greetings, Manager Zhang!" Chen Fei stepped forward and cupped his hands.

"You are Chen Fei?"

Zhang Yuezhen brazenly scrutinized Chen Fei from head to toe, then continued, "Si Nan told me about you. Your talent in alchemy is quite good."

"The Young Miss is too kind," Chen Fei replied modestly.

"I have been entrusted by Si Nan to come to North City Medical Hall to rebuild it, and for that, I need many people's help."

"It is our duty to contribute to the medical hall!" Chen Fei said with a smile.

"I will strive to recover quickly and refine more pills," Chen Fei said with a smile.

Zhang Yuezhen remained silent, her eyes fixed on Chen Fei. Chen Fei did not shy away, meeting her gaze directly.

"Very well, remember your decision today!"

Zhang Yuezhen snorted coldly, then turned and left. Shan Xiang glared fiercely at Chen Fei before following Zhang Yuezhen's footsteps.

"Manager Chen..."

Liu Jun, seeing Zhang Yuezhen walk away, approached with a worried expression. Was it perhaps not ideal to conflict with the new manager on her first day?

Chen Fei patted Liu Jun's shoulder and walked towards his alchemy room.

Zhang Yuezhen, as a new official, was clearly starting with a bang, and Chen Fei was obviously her first target. If Chen Fei had truly agreed to her demands, not only would his time be completely consumed, leaving him no energy for his own matters, but it would also set a precedent.
