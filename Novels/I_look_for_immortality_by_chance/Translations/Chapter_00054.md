# Chapter 54: The Unexpected Reason for the Ambush  

The moment Gu Yuan saw the Star Spirit, an uncontrollable greed surged within him.  

But in the next instant, all his avarice was shattered by overwhelming fear.  

"Ha!"  

With a sharp exhale, Gu Yuan's robust figure shot forward several feet, his terrifying strength propelling him toward the young man.  

The fierce wind against his face made the young man's scalp tingle.  

But he no longer had any demonic beasts left to block the attack.  

"Yellow Sand Seal!"  

He could only activate the earthen-yellow seal in his dantian, attempting to summon a storm of sand to shield himself.  

"Roar!"  

Yet, at that very moment, the roar of a dragon suddenly echoed in his mind.  

An overwhelming spiritual force assaulted his consciousness, leaving him stunned and unable to react. The seal remained unactivated.  

"Bang!"  

Then, an excruciating pain erupted from his dantian.  

Looking down, he saw an ice-blue fist piercing through his abdomen, shattering his dantian and leaving behind a gaping hole.  

With such a grievous wound, the young man lost all ability to resist, unable to muster even a trace of spiritual energy.  

But he wasn’t dead yet.  

"P-please… don’t kill me!"  

"Spare me, spare me! I’m also a disciple of the Dao Academy—you can’t kill me!"  

His face ashen with terror, the young man pleaded desperately.  

"How did you track me? And why did you ambush me?"  

Gu Yuan tightened his grip around the young man’s slender neck and demanded coldly.  

"It was the Seeker Insect! I have Seeker Insects!"  

"Mi'er carries the scent of Shiva Incense. If you spend time with her, the fragrance lingers on you. The Seeker Insect is a rare demonic beast—the Moon Bamboo Market’s Mist Veil can block spiritual senses and magical sight, but it can’t mask natural scents."  

"You bought the Soul-Binding Technique, so you must have a rare spirit beast. That’s why I ambushed you!"  

"The Azure Water Ape is an experienced bandit. I knew about it, so I set this trap. I scattered Fire-Eye Powder along your path to make it think you had bought Fire-Eye Pills!"  

"I wanted to reap the benefits, but I never expected you to be so powerful!"  

"I was blind, utterly blind! Please, spare me!"  

"I’m willing to—"  

"Snap!"  

Before he could finish, Gu Yuan twisted his hand and snapped the young man’s neck.  

With a flick of his finger, a scorching flame erupted, reducing the corpse to ashes—leaving behind only a storage pouch and four spirit beast pouches.  

"Agh!"  

As the young man died, the weasel and the Azure Water Python, still struggling against the Cloud-Walking Seal and the "Purple Lightning Chisel," let out a final wail before collapsing lifeless.  

---  

Gu Yuan watched everything unfold, his eyes dark and unfathomable. He sighed softly.  

"So, it was the Soul-Binding Technique that gave me away…"  

"On the path of cultivation, one can never be too cautious…"  

Gu Yuan never expected that today’s events weren’t due to the Fire-Eye Pills from the auction, nor the Young Titanwood, nor any personal vendetta.  

It was simply because he had let his guard down for a moment in the market and carelessly flaunted his wealth.  

Then, a bandit he had never met before set a trap for him.  

If not for his formidable strength, he would have died without ever knowing who had ambushed him—or why.  

It would have been an unsolved mystery.  

"Shiva Incense? Mi'er?"  

After a moment of reflection, Gu Yuan’s gaze turned cold.  

The root of this oversight was nothing more than a lingering fragrance and a mere Qi Refinement second-layer woman.  

"Why must you force me to sever all sentiment?"  

With another sigh, Gu Yuan summoned his Jade Dragon Shuttle and turned back toward the Moon Bamboo Market.  

---  

"Mercy, honored guest!"  

"Thud!"  

Before her plea could fully escape her lips, the azure sword had already severed her delicate head.  

A young, vibrant life vanished in an instant.  

But it was all her own doing.  

Gu Yuan stared indifferently at the headless corpse, his expression unreadable.  

"Honored guest, please calm yourself. I had no idea someone would exploit fragrances to bypass the Mist Veil."  

"However, the market sees countless visitors daily. Even the master’s seals cannot account for every possibility. I beg your understanding."  

"Still, since this incident occurred under our watch, Moon Bamboo Market takes full responsibility. Your entry fee will be refunded, and we’ll provide you with a token granting you free access henceforth."  

"Additionally, here are fifty spirit stones as compensation. Does this satisfy you?"  

Beside Gu Yuan stood a frail, elderly man with green-tinged skin and emerald eyes—a bamboo demon at the ninth layer of Qi Refinement.  

This elder was a steward of Moon Bamboo Market, a bamboo spirit enlightened by a master cultivator, granting him human form and keen intelligence to oversee the market’s affairs.  

Above him were bamboo demons at the Foundation Establishment stage, but for this matter, the market deemed a ninth-layer steward sufficient.  

"Has this happened before?" Gu Yuan asked.  

"Well… to be honest, it has, though rarely. Few can bypass the Mist Veil so effectively," the elder admitted after a pause.  

---  

"Very well. This ends here."  

Hearing this, Gu Yuan understood everything. He took the token and spirit stones without further questions and left.  

He had realized the truth.  

The market had long been aware of such schemes but turned a blind eye.  

If victims survived and raised complaints, they were placated.  

If they died? Silence.  

After all… bandits needed the market, and the market needed bandits. Without them, who would buy stolen goods?  

The market wasn’t entirely safe. The six-spirit-stone entry fee only eliminated most threats. If someone targeted you, it was simply a matter of skill.  

Gu Yuan had no choice but to accept this.  

Had he not revealed his status as a disciple of Green Peak Dao Academy today, resolving this matter might not have been so easy.  

"From now on, I must be even more cautious. No safeguard is as reliable as one’s own strength…"  

Previously, the security of the Heavenly Star Black Market within the sect had lulled him into complacency. This incident served as a harsh lesson.  

"Now, I should be able to cultivate in peace for a while."  

"I won’t leave seclusion until I break through to the seventh layer of Qi Refinement!"  

As Gu Yuan reflected, the gates of Green Peak Dao Academy came into view.  

Guiding his shuttle through the entrance, he returned to his cave abode.  

After meditating briefly, he waved his hand and retrieved two storage pouches and several spirit beast pouches.  

Though the ambush had been unexpected, it had also yielded spoils.  

Before planting the Young Titanwood, Gu Yuan decided to sort through these items—there might be unexpected treasures among them.
