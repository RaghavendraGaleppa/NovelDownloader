# Chapter 483: Eight Scenery Clouds Refine Creation

What is the Unformed Realm?

It is a temporary dimension opened by a Foundation Establishment cultivator using their magical power, existing between reality and illusion.

When a cultivator steps into this realm, they can avoid the entanglement of mundane karma, allowing them to move mountains and overturn seas without being tainted by the karmic forces of the mortal world.

It resembles a琉璃 (lapis lazuli) mirror, reflecting the real world but distorted and deformed. Space is layered and folded like origami, and the flow of time differs from the outside world.

The aftermath of battles is confined within this realm. Even if the fight shatters the heavens and cracks the earth, the outside world would only see a sudden change in wind and clouds, or startled birds taking flight.

Only those at Foundation Establishment level and above can sense its existence. To mortals, it appears as a mirage, forgotten in an instant.

But Xu Yunfan naturally would not give this Sanzang any chance.

If he were to truly rush in and fight, this opponent would be incredibly difficult to deal with, leaving Xu Yunfan with nowhere to cry if he lost.

Just from the current situation, Sanzang had already revealed a strength not inferior to late-stage Foundation Establishment.

Xu Yunfan secretly felt fortunate. If he hadn't cultivated the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra* to the extreme realm of "Divine Martial Unity," he would likely have been suppressed by that Boundless Golden Body by now.

As the leader of the demonic path for ten thousand years, the Primordial Origin Sect not only possessed the complete True Martial inheritance system but also included thirty-six accompanying commentaries ranging from Foundation Establishment to Golden Core.

During the three years of bitter cultivation in the Scripture Pavilion, the *True Martial Subduing Devil Sutra* had been annotated by generations of true masters. He had pondered over every word of the key points—"Divine Nether Interdependence"—annotated by Grandmaster Xuanxiao himself, which allowed him to forge a True Martial Dao Foundation capable of clashing head-on with the Buddhist Golden Body.

All this was bought with contribution points loaned from the Primordial Origin Sect.

In contrast, cultivators from small sects, even if they were lucky enough to get a fragment of the true sutra, without the *North Pole Purple Star Suppressing Nether Qi* to harmonize yin and yang, and without the *Nine Turns Jade Liquid Returning Pill Art* to solidify their foundation, they would possess killing techniques but lack methods to nurture the Dao.

Just like the loose cultivators outside the Cold Crow Pass, they couldn't even gather a complete Foundation Establishment cultivation method. If they encountered a high monk like Sanzang from the Pure Land of Bodhisattvas, they probably couldn't even withstand the pressure of the Golden Body and would be converted into guardian puppets by the Buddhist light in an instant.

Xu Yunfan's True Martial Manifestation was fierce and domineering, clashing head-on with the Great Bodhisattva's Golden Body without falling behind. His moves were open and expansive, carrying a determination to destroy all laws.

However, that Boundless Light Illuminating the Ten Directions and Eight Divisions Guardian World Golden Body was as stable as a rock, with a more profound foundation. The Buddhist power was vast and endless. Every move seemed casual but contained higher-level Dao laws, dissolving and dispelling the fierce attacks one by one.

Especially the transcendent rank power contained within the Golden Body was like a natural moat, constantly grinding away the divine light of Xu Yunfan's Manifestation.

If it weren't for the North Pole Purple Star Suppressing Nether Qi constantly amplifying, suppressing, and transforming this Buddhist light pressure, his True Martial Dao Foundation would likely have already shown signs of decline!

The battle situation was changing subtly amidst the intense stalemate. The three-zhang Golden Body ultimately had a deeper foundation.

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Heavenly Eye, the Word of Battle, and the North Pole Purple Star Suppressing Nether Qi—his three great divine abilities were all deployed. Simply using the Word of Battle and the North Pole Purple Star Suppressing Nether Qi for amplification made him invincible within the same realm.

Aside from the Word of Calmness which remained hidden, Xu Yunfan had truly utilized his innate divine abilities to the extreme.

After a fierce collision, the eight-armed Golden Body suddenly pressed down with a palm. Within that palm, it seemed to contain a pure land of the Buddha. Countless chanting voices converged, forming an absolute force capable of suppressing the four elements.

**BOOM!!!**

Xu Yunfan's True Martial Manifestation was struck by this palm and shook violently. The nether qi, ice flames, and chains condensed on the six arms all dimmed simultaneously, as if承受ing an unimaginable pressure. The main body of the manifestation showed signs of collapsing.

His own face turned pale, he let out a muffled groan, and a trickle of blood seeped from the corner of his mouth.

Sanzang's voice transmitted through the Golden Body Manifestation, carrying a sense of detachment as if the dust had settled: "Amitabha! Benefactor, resistance is futile. This is the destination of your karma, and also this poor monk's karmic mission. Why not come with this poor monk to the Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss and quickly attain Bodhi? With your talent for battle, you might even be able to attain a Buddha position."

A large hand of the Golden Body Manifestation, wreathed in golden light, reached down towards the slightly deflated True Martial Manifestation below. Within the palm, Buddhist power transformed into countless golden Sanskrit chains, aiming to completely imprison Xu Yunfan!

At this critical moment, Xu Yunfan's eyes suddenly erupted with unprecedented brilliance, within which many emotions were mixed, but fear and despair were nowhere to be found.

Sanzang felt a sudden unease.

His strength was an all-round suppression. What means did the other party have left to turn the tide?

"Western Paradise of Ultimate Bliss? I'll send you to the West!"

Xu Yunfan's hand seals changed abruptly.

The seemingly exhausted True Martial Manifestation instantly dissipated, transforming into eight colorful, illusory and real, fluctuating clouds.

These eight clouds appeared extremely abruptly, without any warning, as if born from thin air.

They instantly entangled the giant golden Buddhist palm reaching down.

坎 Water Cloud (Kan Shui Yun): Deep and dark blue, like the water of the Xuanming Cold Abyss. Silent and soundless, yet it instantly neutralized and froze the scorching Buddhist nature within the resplendent Buddhist light.

离 Fire Cloud (Li Huo Yun): Crimson and violent, yet not ordinary fire. It was the void celestial fire that refines all things. As it climbed up, the Sanskrit on the Golden Body, and even the materialized Buddhist power constituting the Buddhist palm, were ignited, emitting sounds of "hissing" and burning.

艮 Mountain Cloud (Gen Shan Yun): Heavy and thick like Mount Buzhou, instantly condensing into a weight of billions of jun, squeezing the structure of the Buddhist palm from within.

巽 Wind Cloud (Xun Feng Yun): Formless and invisible yet sharp and peerless, frantically cutting the meridians and channels of the Buddhist palm.

兑 Marsh Cloud (Dui Ze Yun): Viscous and turbid, possessing strong power to defile and dissolve. It adhered to the golden light, causing the mirror-like pure Buddhist light to appear mottled.

震 Thunder Cloud (Zhen Lei Yun): Carrying the power of the nine heavens' thunderbolts, suddenly erupting within the Buddhist palm.

乾 Heaven Cloud (Qian Tian Yun) and 坤 Earth Cloud (Kun Di Yun): These two clouds (implied by the Eight Sceneries) manifested the mechanisms of heaven and earth, reversing yin and yang, and distorting laws! The Eight Sceneries flowed, creation followed the heart.

*Eight Sceneries Clouds of the Mysterious Capital, Refining Heaven and Creating Creation.*

*Eight Scenery Clouds: Manifesting Heaven and Transforming Matter.*

"What... is this?!"

The grand Golden Body Manifestation of Sanzang let out a muffled groan for the first time, filled with astonishment.

That golden Buddhist palm, capable of capturing mountains and grinding away divine abilities, under the erosion of the Eight Scenery Clouds' bizarre and unreasonable power, actually seemed to encounter its natural nemesis. It rapidly dimmed, disintegrated, and melted away at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The pure Buddhist power constituting the Buddhist palm was actually reverse-refined and decomposed by these eight seemingly gentle clouds.

Refining Heaven and Creating Creation, it naturally excels in the word "Refine"!

What was even more terrifying was that this power derived from Refining Heaven and Creation did not just act on the Buddhist palm itself; it actually spread rapidly upwards along the Golden Body Manifestation's arm, devouring as it went.

Wherever it passed, the sacred Golden Body, as if遭遇ing the most terrifying plague and pollution, saw its structure collapse and its Buddhist light extinguish.

The stable and rock-solid Eight Divisions Guardian World Golden Body began to shake violently, its surface golden light flickering frantically, bright and dim in succession.

The sound of Sanskrit and Buddhist chanting came to an abrupt halt, replaced by a fine sound like shattering glass.

"Ugh!"

Sanzang's true body spat out a mouthful of golden blood. His ancient and unsophisticated face instantly lost all color. Those compassionate and clear eyes were filled with incomprehensible shock and a hint...

Horror!

How could this be?!

What kind of Dao art is this?
