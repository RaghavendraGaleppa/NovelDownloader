# Chapter 11: Channeling the Dao Rhythm

Night had fallen.

Zhang Jing sat cross-legged on his bed with eyes closed. Thanks to the spirit beast meat, waves of warmth flowed through his bloodstream, circulating throughout his body. In this process, his previously exhausted mental energy from continuous cultivation seemed to regain its vitality, becoming vigorous once more.

Activating his Dharma Seed, a familiar illusory third eye gradually appeared and slowly opened. On the jade talisman, the proficiency of the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique began to increase rapidly. Countless new insights converged into surging waves that crashed directly into Zhang Jing's consciousness.

One breath... two breaths... seven breaths!

The duration of maintaining the third eye had easily surpassed his previous record, yet Zhang Jing felt none of his usual fatigue. At this moment, waves of warmth emanated from deep within his body, continuously replenishing his depleted mental energy.

Nine breaths!

Ten breaths!

Finally, the duration stabilized at fourteen breaths! Zhang Jing even sensed that fourteen breaths wasn't his limit—but pushing further would damage his mental energy, making it not worth the cost.

His gaze shifted as the semi-transparent jade talisman appeared before him, briefly displaying the skill information of the Pure Essence Breathing Visualization Technique.

"With the help of spirit beast meat this time, the technique's proficiency actually increased by 9 points?" Zhang Jing was momentarily stunned. He had anticipated some improvement, but hadn't expected the difference with spirit beast meat to be so dramatic.

At this rate, with a steady supply of spirit beast meat, he could master the visualization technique within five days at most. Today was only the second day, and he'd already met the requirements for a Grade B evaluation!

"Instructor Wang's words from today's lecture echoed in Zhang Jing's mind: "The higher your evaluation grade, the more the Dao Academy will value you. You four have the potential for Grade B evaluations and may enter the inner academy in the future. Seize this opportunity and don't slack off."

The message was clear—the difference between Grade B and Grade C evaluations wasn't just about receiving mid-grade versus low-grade inheritances. More importantly, it determined whether one could enter the inner academy.

"So I must strive for a Grade B evaluation," Zhang Jing said firmly. "The spirit beast meat issue needs to be resolved quickly." He didn't want to miss this opportunity.

But how to obtain spirit beast meat?

Wait—perhaps he could shamelessly mooch some from Ji Bochang every day? He could repay him double later. But since this concerned Ji's own future prospects too, he might not agree...

Or maybe get credit at the spirit food hall? There didn't seem to be any precedent for that.

Zhang Jing's mind churned with possibilities until he suddenly remembered—"That's right! Last night I forgot about... the Dark Python Devouring Void Dao Rhythm!"

Slapping his forehead, Zhang Jing realized he'd been so focused on the visualization technique that he'd completely neglected the incomplete Dark Python Dao Rhythm he'd acquired. With nothing else to do, why not try it now?

His interest was piqued, especially since this "Dark Python Devouring Void Dao Rhythm" was something he'd comprehended using his third eye Dharma Seed while observing a Dao Academy elder in meditation. It must be related to cultivation.

After calming his excitement, Zhang Jing closed his eyes and sank his consciousness deep within, repeatedly recalling the special state he'd perceived that day, attempting to draw out that wisp of Dao Rhythm.

Time passed silently. The room became eerily quiet—even the usual insect sounds vanished as if intimidated by some terrifying presence. Gradually, a heavy, icy sensation began permeating Zhang Jing's consciousness.

Suddenly—ROAR!

A primordial roar exploded in Zhang Jing's mind without warning, followed by a metallic scraping sound that grew increasingly loud and chilling.

At some point, Zhang Jing felt himself transform into a black python—if it could be called that. Its teeth were like blades, with broken whiskers on one side, no horns on its head, and no limbs. Less than one-tenth of its body was visible—a sleek, powerful form covered in glistening black scales.

The python's eyes opened, flashing with brutality, then instinctively gaped its maw. Immediately, wisps of spiritual energy gathered around Zhang Jing's stone house before streaming into the incomplete python's mouth like rivers returning to the sea.

"So this is what spiritual energy looks like?" Zhang Jing, now seemingly merged with the python, barely had time for this realization before becoming fully absorbed in drawing in the energy.

I'll absorb! And absorb more!

The spiritual energy wasn't abundant, but it was continuous. After passing through the python, it became incredibly pure, directly integrating into Zhang Jing's body. Unlike the warm currents from spirit beast meat, this felt like soaking in a hot spring—every part of his body rejoiced.

His qi and blood strengthened gradually, his heartbeat grew more powerful, and his depleted mental energy steadily recovered.

Until... dawn arrived.

Zhang Jing opened his eyes in confusion. An entire night had passed since he began channeling the Dark Python Dao Rhythm, yet in his perception, only half a cup of tea's time had elapsed. This drastic discrepancy between perception and reality nearly disoriented him completely.

After a long while, he recovered. "They say cultivation makes time meaningless—now I understand." He exhaled deeply, then couldn't suppress his excitement.

His body now brimmed with incredible vitality—even surpassing spirit beast meat's effects by half. Overnight, his situation had transformed completely. With the Dark Python Dao Rhythm's assistance, he could master the visualization technique within three to five days at most. Achieving a Grade B evaluation was now just a matter of time.

An indescribable exhilaration filled Zhang Jing's heart. He vaguely sensed that the Dark Python Dao Rhythm—limited by his still-mortal body—could currently only absorb spiritual energy to aid cultivation. Its true terrifying potential would only manifest after he stepped onto the immortal path. And this was just an incomplete Dao Rhythm! Zhang Jing couldn't fathom how powerful that Dao Academy elder truly was.

Returning to the present, Zhang Jing looked at his hands with wry amusement. "I haven't even mastered the basic immortal visualization technique, yet I can already sense and absorb spiritual energy. This is like running before learning to walk."

Then he remembered those monstrous talents who achieved Grade A evaluations. The more he thought about them, the more absurd they seemed. Even with his jade talisman's proficiency assistance, the Dark Python Dao Rhythm's energy absorption, and his third eye Dharma Seed accelerator, he still couldn't master the visualization technique within three days.

"Ah, the path to immortality is long indeed." Setting aside his pride, Zhang Jing resumed cultivation.

Two days later.

A satisfied smile appeared on Zhang Jing's face—his progress was slightly ahead of schedule. "With a final push, I can master the technique tomorrow. A full day earlier than the Grade B evaluation deadline. What a genius I am."

"Oh right, there's Instructor's lecture today—can't be late." With that, Zhang Jing hurried toward the lecture hall.
