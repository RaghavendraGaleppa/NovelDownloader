Chapter 63: Princess Xiao Jiang's Heaven-Defying Sword Talent, Poor Ice Lump?

"Teacher... if I practice with you... will I be able to bring back the dead one day?" Jiang ChuLong's eyes shone with hope.

Her father, the emperor, had always disliked her because of her mother. If she could bring her mother back to life...

Yuan Shi Tian Zun, also known as Li Mo, fell into deep thought upon hearing her words. Was it possible? As far as he knew, there was no method to revive the dead.

As the master of a small world, he understood that life was a creation of the heavens and earth, and even he, as the ruler of this world, couldn't create life out of thin air. The emperors of Da Yu Dynasty must have wanted to live forever, but if there was a way to achieve that, why not let the founding emperor, Wu Di, be reborn?

However, he had the System, an existence beyond the norm...

It was unclear whether it was because he thought of this or didn't want to crush her hopes, but Li Mo nodded and said, "Yes, it's possible."

Jiang ChuLong was stunned, as if struck by lightning, and the spark of hope in her eyes grew brighter. She wanted to become stronger!

"I really am amazing," Li Mo thought to himself, watching the girl clench her small fists and cheer herself on.

Li Mo breathed a sigh of relief. It wasn't easy to fool a princess. Fortunately, as a seasoned bookworm, he had a wealth of knowledge to draw upon. When it came to bragging, no one could beat those novelists.

Princess Xiao Jiang seemed to have been thoroughly convinced.

"Teacher... thank you..." The girl suddenly stood up and bowed deeply, her thin shoulders trembling with excitement. She looked like a small white flower in the ruins, growing towards the sunlight with all her might.

Li Mo felt a slight pang of guilt in his heart. Deceiving such a girl didn't feel right. However, Princess Xiao Jiang needed some confidence, and it was just a white lie...

"Alright, let's keep this between us. Sometimes, knowing too much isn't a good thing," Li Mo said. "Just focus on practicing with me from today onwards, and with time, the Da Yu Dynasty will be at your feet."

"Yes!" Jiang ChuLong nodded vigorously.

This conversation would have sounded absurd to outsiders, but Princess Xiao Jiang had already put her faith in her teacher, Tian Zun, after learning about his background.

"Then... Teacher... what will you teach me first?" she asked.

"Well, you've never practiced martial arts before, so we'll start with the basics of Qi and Blood Realm," Li Mo said, lowering his voice. "You need to take it one step at a time. Although you've lost your Sword Bone, it has actually stimulated the potential of your innate Sword Fetus, making your foundation stronger."

Jiang ChuLong blushed at the praise and lowered her head. She hadn't expected that losing her Sword Bone could be a good thing.

"Teacher... can I... cultivate my own method?" she asked.

Li Mo was taken aback. He had been thinking about what Qi and Blood Realm martial arts to teach her.

"You said... to forge my own path..." Jiang ChuLong stammered.

Li Mo understood now. Although she hadn't learned martial arts, during her time at Tian Shan Sword Manor, she had watched many broken sword artifacts and had been taken around the sword tombs by an old guardian. As a result, she had intuitively grasped a martial art, but her father had forbidden her from practicing it.

"Recite the general outline for me," Li Mo said.

"It's... quite... rough... please, Teacher, guide me," Jiang ChuLong said, sharing what she had figured out.

Li Mo listened in silence, his expression growing more serious with each passing moment. The martial art she had grasped wasn't particularly strong; it was only a mid-level martial art, something he could easily find a similar version of. However, the fact that she had grasped it without any prior knowledge or training was remarkable - she was a true prodigy.
