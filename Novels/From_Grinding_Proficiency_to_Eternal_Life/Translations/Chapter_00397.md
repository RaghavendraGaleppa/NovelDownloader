# Chapter 397: Remolding the Meridians

“Don't stand on ceremony, Junior Brother. There are no special requirements for the Pulse-Opening Pill; it can be refined using the Hundred Meridians Nether Technique.”

Xu Yunfan took out a few dark red blood crystals from his Sumeru Bag and gently placed them on the counter.

The surface of the blood crystals shimmered with an eerie crimson light, and thick vital energy and blood qi lingered around them.

The deacon disciple’s expression tightened abruptly. He reached out, picked up a blood crystal, and brought it close to his eyes for a careful inspection.

After a long while, a look of surprise flashed through his eyes, and he clicked his tongue in amazement. “Such rich blood qi... it must have refined at least a hundred strong men... Good stuff!”

He looked up at Xu Yunfan, his tone carrying a hint of probing. “Junior Brother, you are quite the dark horse. This blood crystal is of top quality. One piece is worth five contribution points.”

Xu Yunfan nodded slightly, but his heart chilled.

Although he had long known that blood crystals were of an evil origin, he didn't expect they were refined from the fresh blood of living people. These disciples of the demonic sect were truly inhuman!

There were at least two hundred such blood crystals inside his Sumeru Bag.

Seeing Xu Yunfan’s silence, the deacon disciple thought he found the price too low and added, “If it were an ordinary blood crystal, it would be worth at most three points. But these pieces of yours... tsk tsk, they were probably refined from men with pure vital energy and unbroken primordial yang, right?”

Xu Yunfan neither confirmed nor denied it, simply saying indifferently, “If that isn't enough, I have other things.”

The deacon disciple perked up, leaning forward slightly. “Oh? Why don't you take them all out and let me see?”

Xu Yunfan didn't waste any words. With a wave of his hand, a pitch-black flying sword flew out of the Sumeru Bag, its blade entwined with wisps of Yin evil qi.

The deacon disciple’s eyes lit up. He reached out to take it and lightly flicked the sword body with his finger. Immediately, a ghostly wailing hum rang out.

“A Yin Sword Seed, forty-two points!”

He quoted the price without hesitation, then looked at Xu Yunfan again. “Anything else?”

The corners of Xu Yunfan's mouth curled up slightly, and he took out three bottles of Jade Marrow Heart-Nourishing Pills from his chest. The bottles were crystal clear, and the pills inside could vaguely be seen flowing with a faint spiritual light.

The deacon disciple opened the stopper and took a sniff, immediately beaming with joy. “Top-grade pills, twenty points per bottle, totaling sixty points for three bottles!”

Xu Yunfan thought for a moment and used the remaining blood crystals to make up the rest. This item was useless to him, and besides, using it made him feel physically uncomfortable.

When he walked out of the Joyful Courtyard, the setting sun was like blood, casting long shadows from the pillars.

The Pulse-Opening Pill in Xu Yunfan's hand emitted a piercing chill. The purple-black patterns flowing on the surface of the pill squirmed like living things, radiating waves of cold, sinister energy.

His fingertips trembled slightly. In a daze, he seemed to hear a faint hissing coming from within the pill, like a living creature.

Back in the simple tile-roofed house, the dull sound of the wooden bolt falling was particularly clear in the silence.

Xu Yunfan tore open his clothes, took off the Dragon Scale Armor, and threw aside the Extreme Dao Remnant, revealing a stomach as strong and firm as cast iron.

Just as he placed the pill three inches below his navel, his skin suddenly moved without wind, covered in a spiderweb of dark green and black patterns. Under the skin, it seemed as if hundreds of small snakes were frantically swimming, pushing the flesh into strange protrusions.

This pill was causing his flesh and blood to fall into chaos.

“Truly strange...”

His expression remained normal. His right hand formed a sword with his fingers, and the Ten Extremities True Qi condensed into a golden light an inch long at his fingertips.

“Have you thought this through clearly?”

The originally soft and drooping Extreme Dao Remnant suddenly moved without wind, slowly unfurling in the abundant spiritual qi of heaven and earth.

Ripples like water waves appeared on the surface of the human skin. Every fold was adjusting its position on its own, as if an invisible hand were carefully ironing it out.

Xu Yunfan’s pupils contracted slightly. The face of Yu Congling, which should have been dead and silent, now showed vivid expressions under the infiltration of spiritual qi.

The slightly downturned curve of her mouth, the furrowed lines of her brows, even the fluttering of her eyelashes when her eyelids opened and closed were clearly visible. More bizarrely, the fatal sword wound on the neck of the human skin was squirming and closing up. The edges of the gap were growing fine, hair-like flesh buds that entangled each other.

“This Pulse-Opening Pill...”

As the lips of the remnant moved, the throat bulged and flattened, producing a clear, cold voice like the sound of metal striking. “...planting it is like engraving the brand of the Origin Demon Sect into your bone marrow. At that time, every inch of your new meridians will be entwined with demonic patterns. The Hundred Meridians Nether Technique, exclusive to the demonic path, will soak into your bone marrow.”

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but laugh softly. “Miss Yu is joking. Now, I only have this one path to take.”

Yu Congling said, “You could go to the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect. With me as your backing, the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect will definitely accept you as a disciple. Then, you can cultivate the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Bone and also remold your meridians.”

Xu Yunfan didn't even lift his eyelids. “Thank you for your kindness, but I have already become a disciple of the Origin Sect. If I go out, which orthodox sect would believe a demonic disciple?”

Before Yu Congling could speak, Xu Yunfan’s five fingers spread out虚张. A dark golden true qi, like chains, wrapped around Yu Congling’s remnant and sucked it over in an instant.

The human skin trembled violently. The sword wound on the neck suddenly burst with a piercing green light, as if trying to break free from its restraints.

“Why are you in such a hurry, Miss Yu?”

Xu Yunfan’s fingertip traced the Heavenly Spirit Acupoint of the human skin, and the Ten Extremities True Qi formed a Nine Palace Seal at the acupoint. “Wait until the day I build my Foundation, I will naturally send you to find the Ten Thousand Chariots Sword Sect.”

The remnant’s struggle suddenly ceased. Yu Congling’s voice carried a hint of sarcasm. “I have always been by your side. Do you think I would believe what you say?”

Xu Yunfan laughed softly but didn't answer. He simply folded the sealed remnant into a square shape and stuffed it into the inner layer of his Dragon Scale Armor.

This Extreme Dao Remnant had a great use. If he obtained any puppet techniques in the future, he could refine and fill it. With Yu Congling's strength, it would definitely be a great help.

With a soft *chi* sound, the extremely sharp energy at Xu Yunfan’s fingertips cut through his skin. Before the blood could even seep out, the Pulse-Opening Pill, like a leech smelling blood, actively钻入 the wound.

Then, an extremely bizarre scene occurred.

The flesh and blood at the wound suddenly rolled over and squirmed, healing back to its original state in the blink of an eye.

The next moment, Xu Yunfan’s whole body shook violently. A muffled sound like tree roots breaking through the ground came from his abdomen.

Under the internal observation of the Martial Dao Sky Eye, he could see the pill explode into thousands of purple threads at the intersection of his Dantian and flesh. Like living things, they pierced into his five viscera and six bowels.

What was most terrifying was at the spine. Those purple threads actually climbed upward along the bone marrow cavity. Every inch they advanced brought a pain like scraping bones and grinding marrow.

“Hiss...”

Xu Yunfan sucked in a breath of cold air. He had made ample preparations, but his teeth gritted until blood foam splattered onto the meditation cushion.

Under the internal observation of the Martial Dao Sky Eye, he could see the medicinal power condensing into a vortex at the Qi Sea. Countless filament-like things were piercing into the nearby organs.

The most painful part was the spine. It felt as if millions of red-hot steel needles were crawling up the bone marrow, forcibly chiseling open channels through the originally blocked meridians.

Xu Yunfan dared not be negligent and immediately operated the Hundred Meridians Nether Technique to guide the medicinal power, beginning to remold the meridians within his body.

As the Hundred Meridians Nether Technique operated, a heart-wrenching *kacha* sound came from deep within the spine, as if countless tiny ice picks were growing inside the bone marrow cavity.

Xu Yunfan’s forehead bulged with blue veins. His ten fingers dug deep into the meditation cushion, his knuckles turning white from excessive force.
