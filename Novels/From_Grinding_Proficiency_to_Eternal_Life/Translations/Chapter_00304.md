# Chapter 304: The Heaven Sword, Dugu Qiu

The Meridian Cleansing Marrow Technique activated on its own, blood and Qi surging rapidly. The pure Yang true Qi rushed through his flesh and blood like a raging tempest, and a layer of fine sweat instantly beaded on his back.

His right hand instinctively reached back for the Scarlet Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel.

The pores all over his body instantly closed, and his skin took on a faint golden luster.

"Senior, when did you..."

The moment the words left his mouth, Xu Yunfan's pupils constricted.

He had just realized with shock that he hadn't sensed the old man's presence at all!

Even though the other party was standing less than ten feet away, his spiritual sense passed over them as if facing an empty valley or a deep, still pool. Only the occasional flash of sword light in those turbid eyes proved that this was a living, peerless powerhouse.

What was even more terrifying was the change within him. The originally lively and flowing pure Yang true Qi had shrunk back to the depths of his Dantian as if encountering a natural enemy. The disguised Qi aura formed by the entry-level "Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Breathing Technique" had long since been torn to shreds by an invisible sword intent.

In that lightning-fast moment, Xu Yunfan's hair stood on end all over his body, like a prey animal being stared at by a primordial beast.

He could clearly feel the pure Yang true Qi circulating within him retreating like a tide, hiding deep within his flesh and blood.

Even the carefully constructed disguise aura of the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Breathing Technique had crumbled under the old man's turbid gaze. Only the unfathomable Lin Seal continued to flicker with a faint light in his Niwan Palace, serving as his last piece of covering cloth.

When he looked up, however, the old man's hunched figure seemed to have transformed into a ten-thousand-zhang sword peak. Every wrinkle flowed with the most concentrated sword intent imaginable.

Xu Yunfan could even hear the faint trembling sounds of his own bones under the pressure, a suppression more suffocating than the malevolent energy of the Sword Burial Abyss.

He suddenly remembered some martial arts information he had discussed when paying his respects to Bi Yuan.

"There is a world of difference even among Grandmasters of the Ninth Realm. Some are trapped at the threshold for their entire lives, while others can push this realm to the level of a Land Immortal."

Xu Yunfan's fingertips unconsciously traced the patterns on the Scarlet Fire Devouring Dragon Cudgel.

With focused concentration, the thousand-jun of strength that could previously shatter mountains and crack stones began to slowly flow again through his flesh and blood.

A flicker of surprise appeared in the old man's turbid eyes. His thin, withered face twitched slightly, revealing a hint of意外 (surprise).

"Interesting..."

The old man's hoarse voice seemed to come from deep within the earth, carrying a grating, metallic quality. "You little brat, you've actually cultivated a technique for refining the spirit and soul? No wonder you could break free from this old man's 'Formless Sword Intent'."

He suddenly grinned, revealing a few yellowed, broken teeth. "Interesting, truly interesting. I didn't expect to encounter a kindred spirit at the bottom of this Sword Burial Abyss."

Xu Yunfan's body trembled violently upon hearing this, the hair on the back of his neck standing straight up.

The old man's casually spoken words were like a thunderclap exploding in his mind.

The three words "kindred spirit" echoed repeatedly in his Niwan Palace, causing the golden light of the Lin Seal to ripple.

He clearly saw that when the old man spoke, a heart-piercing sword light flashed through his turbid whites.

Three hundred years ago, from the Sword Pavilion, he suppressed the top swordsmen of his era, known as the Heaven Sword, Dugu Qiu!

Xu Yunfan's throat bobbed, his voice dry as sandpaper.

"Heaven Sword... Dugu Qiu?!"

The old man's turbid pupils lit up, and his thin, withered fingers stopped on the rust-covered sword scabbard.

The moment this name left Xu Yunfan's lips, the ancient swords all around trembled and hummed in unison.

"Interesting."

Dugu Qiu grinned, revealing his broken, yellowed teeth. "Three hundred years have brought great changes, yet you little brat still recognize this old man's name."

Xu Yunfan forcefully suppressed his churning blood and Qi, forcing a stiff smile to his lips. "What a... coincidence. I never thought I would meet you here at the bottom of the Sword Burial Abyss."

When the Heaven Sword Dugu Qiu first emerged back then, he came south with a single sword, challenging the Great Zhou Imperial Court. In his battle with that female demon, he打得 (beat her so badly) that she has been cowering in Yujing Dao to this day, not daring to move easily.

Who would have thought that this peerless powerhouse of the Heaven Sword would actually be hiding within the Dao Sect's Sword Burial Abyss? If this news got out, it would definitely make even Bi Yuan's scalp tingle with fright.

Dugu Qiu's thin, withered fingers gently stroked the long sword in his hand, making a rustling sound.

The abyssal malevolent energy flowed slowly with his breath, as if the entire Sword Burial Abyss was resonating with him.

"Coincidence?"

Dugu Qiu let out a low laugh, a playful glint in his turbid eyes. "This old man is merely using the abyssal malevolent energy here to temper my sword intent and practice my cultivation."

He suddenly took a step closer, the rusted sword scabbard letting out a piercing hum. "But you... little brat, the scent of marrow-cleansing energy on you is exactly the same as what I cultivated back in the day. It's very interesting, so I followed you to take a look."

A chill ran down Xu Yunfan's back. He forced himself to remain calm, but his right hand had already quietly formed the Lin Seal. "You jest, Senior. How could my meager skills dare to be compared with yours... Back when you left the Sword Pavilion to challenge the world, you tested your sword against the six great sects, borrowed the strengths of a hundred schools, and performed the act of ten thousand methods returning to one, gathering the ultimate martial arts of all realms into your own body. Such a feat, in the last two thousand years, has been yours alone."

"Heh..."

Flattery is always welcome, and Xu Yunfan spoke with such genuine sincerity that it made the smile on Dugu Qiu's face widen.

But the words he spoke next sent a chill through Xu Yunfan's heart.

"You little fellow, if you had said this before I comprehended the fourth step of the sword path, I would have flayed you alive to prevent your wild talk from polluting my flawless sword heart..."

Dugu Qiu had a faint smile on his face. "But now... say more. I like to hear it."

Xu Yunfan's heart relaxed, and he couldn't help but give a bitter smile as he cupped his fists. "You must find me amusing, Senior."

"Boring."

Dugu Qiu shook his head slightly and asked casually, "Now that the world's spiritual energy has been forcibly awakened by that madwoman, has the Small World Secret Realm... opened yet?"

Xu Yunfan's heart skipped a beat. So this old monster was lying low in the Sword Burial Abyss precisely to wait for the Small World Secret Realm to open!

Xu Yunfan forcefully suppressed his churning blood and Qi. The corner of his eye swept over the trembling ancient swords at the bottom of the abyss. The sword bodies hummed like cries, as if in fear of the old man's presence.

These divine weapons, which had been silent for hundreds of years, were not trembling for no reason. They were responding to the nearly decaying yet boundless and unparalleled sword intent within Dugu Qiu.

The other party had condensed a sword heart that was indestructible, but under the erosion of time, this flawless sword heart, while continuing to advance and grow thicker, gradually becoming more magnificent, carried a hint of twilight.

This was because Dugu Qiu's lifespan was coming to an end.

"The Dao Sect's Profound Heaven Mirror has already destroyed most of the Small World Secret Realms."

"Foolish!"

Dugu Qiu's withered face suddenly twisted, and a heart-piercing cold light burst from his turbid pupils.

The abyssal malevolent energy surged with his anger. The bronze chains moved without wind, emitting a piercing clang.

Xu Yunfan could even hear the sound of bones misaligning within the old man's body. A sword intent that could make the entire Sword Burial Abyss tremble slightly was gradually awakening within him.

Outside the Sword Burial Abyss, the surging malevolent energy suddenly churned violently like a raging sea. The bronze chains trembled violently against the abyss walls, producing a grating sound of clashing metal.

Bi Yuan stood with his hands behind his back, his robes snapping in the turbulent malevolent energy, a hint of solemnity flashing in his profound gaze.
