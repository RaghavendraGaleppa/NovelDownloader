# Chapter 48: The Appearance of a Hoe

Broadly speaking, the history of the Sect Domain is the tale of a cultivator, whose origins are unknown, establishing an advanced power in the relatively desolate Huqing Realm and subsequently developing it. As for where the founders of the Sect Domain came from, or if they had any other purpose in the Huqing Realm besides developing their own power—no one knows. Not a single person in the entire Sect Domain knows. This is because the ancestors of the Sect Domain passed away centuries ago, one after another, in battles against powerful evil cultivators in the Huqing Realm.

However, no one in the Sect Domain has ever truly cared about where they came from. Their lives are quite good, and since their ancestors left no instructions, they don't feel the need to ponder such matters. Even if they knew, it would be impossible for the entire Sect Domain to abandon centuries of accumulation and leave.

Ding Rui was bewildered. He had originally thought he might uncover everything about this cultivation world on this trip, but in the end, he realized that what he knew was merely the tip of the iceberg. The Huqing Realm was nothing more than an island in a vast ocean. No matter how large or all-encompassing this island might be, it was still just an island. The true nature of this cultivation world remained a mystery in Ding Rui's eyes, and unless something unexpected happened, this mystery might persist for a very long time.

However, cultivators in the Sect Domain are extremely vigilant; evil cultivators have no chance of infiltrating. Any cultivators of uncertain danger who wish to enter must first abolish all their cultivation and then practice the Sect Domain's cultivation techniques. Regardless, the Sect Domain has always been moving forward steadily.

Of course, the deep-rooted presence of evil cultivators in the Huqing Realm is not easily resolved. Furthermore, if the Sect Domain rises too quickly, it might provoke a sense of crisis among evil cultivators, leading them to launch a coordinated attack. Therefore, for safety, the Sect Domain continues to develop in a low-key, step-by-step, and steady manner. Things like the saddles and stirrups Ding Rui created for transportation this time allow the Sect Domain to take another solid step forward in the Huqing Realm. Naturally, the rewards for Ding Rui were not stingy in the slightest.

Chatting as they walked to the Mashu's living quarters, Ma Yun and Ma Tu led Ding Rui directly to the Mashu's treasury!

"These are all good things our Mashu acquired fighting evil cultivators on the battlefield. Most of them are stored here. Some are kept as mementos and might not be that powerful, but more often, they are very useful tools. Of course, there are also various items sent by other sects. Feel free to pick anything you fancy and take it," Ma Tu said to Ding Rui.

Ding Rui, meanwhile, had long been dazzled by the array of treasures before his eyes.

He quickly skimmed past the cultivation technique section and arrived at the artifacts display. Compared to cultivation techniques, the number of artifacts was even smaller. This was because most evil artifacts of evil cultivators were refined using special methods, generally requiring the sacrifice of other cultivators' lives. They inherently carried an evil aura and could only be activated by an evil cultivator's true essence. Therefore, evil artifacts seized from evil cultivators were mostly melted down, disassembled, and reforged by the sect, making it almost impossible for them to remain as they were.

The items that the Mashu tribe were able to collect were mostly very ordinary things. But even so, Ding Rui had never seen them before. He slowly scanned over the various artifacts: flying swords, gourds, flags, cloth fragments, and even intricate mechanical puppets... These items fully demonstrated that evil cultivators were not as primitive, backward, or brutal as Ding Rui had imagined. Among evil cultivators, there also existed a magnificent civilization and creativity.
