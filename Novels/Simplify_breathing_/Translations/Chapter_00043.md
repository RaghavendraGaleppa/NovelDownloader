# Chapter 43: Scrutiny

"Discovered Returning Origin Archery. Do you want to spend one tael of silver to simplify Returning Origin Archery?"

"Returning Origin Archery is simplifying... Simplification successful... Returning Origin Archery → Mixed Noodles!"

Another completely unexpected simplification result. Chen Fei blinked. What connection did this archery technique have with mixed noodles? Did they both involve a 'single strand'?

But noodles aren't tendons either.

Chen Fei grimaced, then rummaged through his food reserves but found no noodles. However, this problem was easily solved; he could just ask the Zhao family to send some over tomorrow.

Currently, in the Zhao family's eyes, Chen Fei was a highly valued worker. A request for some noodles would definitely be met.

Unable to grind proficiency for now, Chen Fei took out the medicinal ingredients for the Light Spirit Pill he had received today.

The proficiency for the Light Spirit Pill was still some way from Grand Completion, estimated to be finished in a few more days. However, refining Light Spirit Pills was already completely unproblematic, and the yield was not low.

Chen Fei now produced at least two pills per batch of Light Spirit Pills; with good luck, he could get three. Therefore, in the dark market, exchanging one set of ingredients for one Light Spirit Pill, plus an additional six taels of silver, was a highly profitable deal for Chen Fei.

Ultimately, mastering a skill was equivalent to mastering the secret to wealth.

Chen Fei, quite directly, mixed and ate one serving at a time, and that entire basket of noodles immediately maxed out his proficiency. The only downside was that he had eaten too much mixed noodles recently, making him feel a bit salty.

As for the power of this archery technique, it was very ordinary. After all, it only cost one tael of silver to simplify, which showed just how basic this archery technique truly was. Comparatively, it was like the Extreme Mountain Fist he had learned in the past.

Chen Fei was quite satisfied. After all, in just a few days, he had gone from a complete novice to an archer who could hit whatever he aimed at. What was there to complain about about such efficiency?

There were still two archery techniques left. According to Chen Fei's estimation, he could complete their cultivation in another five or six days. At that point, he would purchase a better longbow, thus completing this stage of cultivation.

Night, Dark Market.

"Here's today's batch."

Chen Fei placed the Grass Reversion Pills and Light Spirit Pills on the counter. The stall owner inspected them briefly, then accepted them with a broad smile, simultaneously handing Chen Fei the silver and five sets of Light Spirit Pill ingredients.

Chen Fei packed his things and turned to leave. He hadn't gone far from the dark market when he stopped.

"Esteemed sir, our master requests your presence. Would you honor us with your company?"

Several figures in black surrounded Chen Fei, their blades glinting with a cold chill under the moonlight.

Chen Fei's expression remained calm. Given the current circumstances, selling pills in the dark market, he had anticipated trouble. After all, a rogue alchemist was a highly sought-after commodity these days.

Regardless of who sent these people, or if there were others observing from the periphery, Chen Fei's objective of deterrence had already been achieved. The aim was to make those aristocratic families understand that this alchemist was not easily controlled. An alchemist of such cultivation could easily retaliate if pushed, making the current cooperative method much safer.

Chen Fei had long anticipated this, and to distinguish himself from his previous identity, he wasn't even using his sword. To make money, one always had to take some risks.

"Good eyesight, but mediocre saber techniques."

Not far away, Ling Hanjun watched Chen Fei's moves and subtly shook his head.

"Let's follow him. This person's disguise technique is quite impressive; I can't even discern his true appearance. If you show him the portrait, perhaps he can make something of it," Xing Wenxiang said from the side.

"Alright!"

Ling Hanjun nodded, and their figures flickered, pursuing Chen Fei.
