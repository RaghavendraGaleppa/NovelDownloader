## Chapter 56: Timid

The chaos of the afternoon had subsided, and Big Bull had left after rubbing his round belly. At night, Li Zhiming was about to start his foot bath as usual. Outside the door, Zhong Jun and Xi Xia were pushing and shoving each other, their faces flushed with embarrassment and excitement.

"Go ahead," Xi Xia said.

"No, you go," Zhong Jun replied.

"It's your turn today. You're so timid!" Xi Xia scolded, tapping Zhong Jun's forehead.

According to their arrangement, the three of them took turns serving Young Master Li. Jiang Yun, the eldest, didn't participate, and the other two, Zhong Jun and Xi Xia, took turns. Yesterday, Xi Xia had gone in, and now it was Zhong Jun's turn, but she was hesitant.

Xi Xia was frustrated with Zhong Jun's timidness. "You're so useless!" she said, tapping Zhong Jun's forehead again. "What if Young Master Li eats you alive?" she teased, trying to encourage Zhong Jun to go in.

Zhong Jun's face turned red, and she looked down at her feet, fidgeting with her skirt. "I'm just not ready yet, sister. Please, you go instead," she begged.

Xi Xia grabbed Zhong Jun's cold hands, which were shaking. "You're really shaking. How can you serve Young Master Li like this?" she said, exasperated.

Xi Xia eventually decided to go in herself, scolding Zhong Jun for being so timid. As she entered the room, she composed herself, putting on a gentle and submissive demeanor.

Inside, Li Zhiming was sitting with a serious expression, holding a brush and a piece of paper with some scribbles on it. He was so engrossed in his work that he didn't even notice Xi Xia's arrival.

Han Li was sitting across from Li Zhiming, holding a book on "immortal techniques." He was so focused on reading that he didn't dare to glance at Li Zhiming's servants, let alone ask them to do anything for him.

Xi Xia approached Li Zhiming, trying to be as quiet as possible. She helped Li Zhiming take off his shoes and socks, and then carefully placed his feet into the hot water. She began to wash his feet, gently pouring water over them.

Li Zhiming was enjoying the foot bath, and he let out a satisfied sigh. He was so relaxed that he didn't even notice Xi Xia's presence.

As Xi Xia finished washing Li Zhiming's feet, she couldn't help but steal a glance at him. She thought to herself that Zhong Jun was missing out on this opportunity.

Just then, Li Zhiming suddenly grabbed a ruler and tapped Han Li's leg, as if he had just remembered something. Han Li quickly moved his leg away, and in a swift motion, he slapped Li Zhiming's head.

Li Zhiming gritted his teeth, thinking about how to retaliate.

"Young Master," Xi Xia said softly, trying to break the tension.

Li Zhiming looked up, noticing Xi Xia for the first time. He didn't know much about her, except that she was one of the three maidservants sent by the sect leader. She was younger than Jiang Yun, and this was her second time serving him.

Xi Xia continued to serve Li Zhiming, washing his feet and making sure the water was warm enough. Li Zhiming was enjoying the luxury, and he felt like he was in heaven.

As the foot bath continued, Li Zhiming became more and more relaxed, eventually getting ready to go to bed, feeling content and satisfied.
