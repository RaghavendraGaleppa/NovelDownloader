# Chapter 263: Jade Slip

The other party’s expression carried a hint of complexity as they deeply gazed at Xu Yunfan.

“You have the qualification to obtain one. Take his token.”

“What is a ‘position’?”

Faced with Xu Yunfan’s inquiry, Yu Congling offered no explanation, merely saying, “The spiritual qi rising from the earth veins has accelerated the timeline. Very soon, you will understand. You must enhance your strength as quickly as possible. Use any method you can think of. Even if you must defy the heavens and tread upon blood to ascend the steps, you must not hesitate. If you can break out of the cage, I shall bestow upon you the path to longevity.”

Xu Yunfan abruptly opened his eyes. He looked up at the high platform. The demonic figure known as Jiang Xu had already vanished.

Using secret arts combined with a blood sacrifice, the Jade Corpse had maintained its physical form for two thousand years, keeping the flesh from decaying and the soul dormant. Now that it had been disturbed, it could no longer remain as it was; its physical body was rapidly approaching collapse, forcing it to attempt to seize Xu Yunfan’s body through self-sacrifice.

If it had been anyone else, Jiang Xu might have succeeded. But against Xu Yunfan...

Not to mention Yu Congling’s supreme legacy remnant, even without it, Xu Yunfan could refine the intruder to death within his sea of consciousness by entering the state of Taishang Wangqing through the meticulous cultivation of the Lin Character Art.

“This cage of a world...”

Xu Yunfan’s eyes narrowed slightly. If that were the case, these two individuals likely did not belong to this world.

If so, it explained why only the Way of Martial Arts was passed down in this world to this day. Although the six great sects of Great Zhou possessed various secret martial arts due to their long histories, they ultimately belonged to the martial path, falling far short of true immortal arts.

Xu Yunfan lightly tapped the tip of his foot against the blood sacrifice jade platform and instantly flashed to the front of Jiang Xu’s remains.

The shell that had once shimmered with a clear luster had already disintegrated. Only a few jade slips emitting a faint dark light were scattered on the ground. The secret patterns flowing on their surface were identical to the cloud patterns on the ceiling of the White Jade Palace.

Xu Yunfan took a step forward, arriving at the spot where Jiang Xu had sat on the high platform. He clearly saw several jade slips scattered there. These had fallen from Jiang Xu’s body when his physical form collapsed and his soul essence turned into a clear luster.

“Jade slips...”

Having read plenty of xianxia and fantasy web novels in his previous life, Xu Yunfan was almost certain that they recorded the techniques of the Immortal Dao.

He flicked a finger, sending a surge of Red Python Vital Energy. The jade slips did not budge; the force poured in like a mud cow entering the sea, vanishing without a trace.

Undeterred, Xu Yunfan tried to pick them up with his palm wrapped in pure yang internal breath, but the jade slips still showed no reaction.

After thinking for a moment, he placed the jade slips against his forehead and entered the Lin Character State to sense them carefully.

A long while later, Xu Yunfan put down the jade slips and exited the Lin Character State.

It still didn't work.

It seemed that to open the jade slips, he needed to ask Yu Congling.

He scanned the White Jade Palace once more to ensure nothing was left behind, then turned his gaze to the blood sacrifice jade on the three-zhang-high platform.

This blood sacrifice jade had the ability to absorb human blood essence. Moreover, if paired with a certain secret art, it could even keep the flesh from decaying and the soul dormant, achieving the same effect as the Source Ancient Jade Wall that sealed Yu Congling, which he had dug up from the Ninggu Tower mine in the Eight Hundred Miles of Wasteland Ice Plains.

But to him, it was useless.

Xu Yunfan reached back and grasped the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, paused for a moment, then shifted his grip to the dragon-swallowing mouth of the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane.

Although the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was a treasure weapon, after entering the Marrow Cleansing Realm, he could already freely wield seventh-grade divine weapons. While this cane was not as heavy as the hammer, the destructive power it could unleash was several times greater.

The moment the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane was drawn, the scales of the Dragon Scale Armor rippled with crimson gold.

Xu Yunfan poured his Triple Jiao Sword Qi into the cane body. The nine layers of cloud-fire patterns lit up with azure thunderfire section by section. Only the unique sign of vital energy penetrating the marrow, specific to the Marrow Cleansing Realm, could fuse the Red Python Coiling Mountain Force and the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer Method into a new killing move and unleash it through the heavy cane.

He stepped forward. The shadow of the cane transformed into a crimson dragon piercing the sun, carrying the fury of magma earth-fire as it struck the core of the blood sacrifice jade.

*Boom!*

The instant the Crimson Fire Swallowing Dragon Cane, carrying magma earth-fire and Triple Jiao Sword Qi, struck the core of the blood sacrifice jade, the dark red blood patterns densely covering the jade platform suddenly exploded, like dried blood vessels torn apart by violent external force.

A shockwave of interwoven crimson and black erupted from the core. The jade fragments melted into foul-smelling blood droplets in the high temperature, only to be vaporized into mist by the azure thunderfire.

The stagnant blood essence and violent energy of two thousand years on the platform turned into piercing shrieks. Countless distorted warrior phantoms struggled to emerge from the cracks, but were annihilated under the entanglement of the sword qi and earth-fire.

The body of the blood sacrifice jade cracked inch by inch, revealing the rotten jade marrow structure inside. The channels once soaked in the essence and blood of all living things now snapped like withered branches. Finally, with a deafening explosion, it completely collapsed, turning into a pile of foul-smelling crimson powder.

In the aftermath of the collapse, a wisp of clear luster drifted from the jade dust. Blending with the blood mist, it briefly caused a celestial phenomenon, causing the runes on the dome to dim.

Meanwhile, Xu Yunfan’s Dragon Scale Armor greedily devoured the dissipating blood essence, the crimson gold ripples on its surface growing even more intense.

Xu Yunfan looked down at the Dragon Scale Armor on his body. Although the will of the evil dragon within it had been subdued and shattered, the remnant spirituality was still extraordinary, capable of devouring others to strengthen itself.

Such a strange characteristic, even though Xu Yunfan possessed the Heavenly Crafting Art, he had never found any similar records.

When he pushed open the heavy doors of the White Jade Palace and stepped out, the cold moonlight fell, casting a shadow over his features that revealed a hint of chilling menace.

Although he had gained some opportunities in this White Jade Palace, he had truly felt the threat of death. In the future, even if someone else acted as guarantor, he could not be so reckless again.

As he pushed open the door, he found a youth wearing the robes of a Nine Luminaries Sect disciple standing outside, frozen in place. He显然 had not expected to run into someone here.

The moment their eyes met, the disciple’s pupils constricted, and his face turned deathly pale in an instant. He recognized Xu Yunfan.

“X-Xu Yunfan?!” The disciple’s voice trembled as he instinctively took a step back.

“Teng Lingchuan?”

Xu Yunfan tilted his head, somewhat surprised.

This person was exactly the one who, back when the Heavenly Crafting Cave had not yet relocated and was still in Yanbei, had jumped out to challenge him without regard for the Heavenly Crafting Cave’s reputation during his true disciple ceremony held by his master, Zhan Yan.

If Xu Yunfan had lost that day, the Heavenly Crafting Cave would have become the laughingstock of Cangzhou.

This person disregarded others, caring only for his own selfish interests...

A smile appeared on Xu Yunfan’s face. “Brother Teng, Brother Teng. Truly, where in life do we not meet? I didn't expect to encounter you in this secret realm. It brings me a bit of joy.”

Teng Lingchuan abruptly stopped his retreat, his expression quickly calming down. Back at the Heavenly Crafting Cave, Xu Yunfan had only barely won by a single move.

Why should he fear him now?

However, why was Xu Yunfan coming out of this White Jade Palace?

Teng Lingchuan’s gaze quickly turned dangerous, but upon seeing the Dragon Scale Armor on Xu Yunfan’s body, with its scales slowly flaring and contracting, a hint of caution flashed through his eyes.

He asked in a deep voice, “Have you seen any of my Nine Luminaries Sect disciples?”

“Are you referring to Zhou Tianyan?”

Teng Lingchuan’s expression perked up. “Are they inside?”

“Yes.”
