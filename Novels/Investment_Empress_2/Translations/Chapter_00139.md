# Chapter 139: Ying Bing: "He's So Strange"

Li Mo roughly knew what the Golden Creation Seal was.

As for the *Zhou Tian Xing Dou Xuan Dan Fa*, although he didn't know exactly what kind of martial art it was, just hearing the name told him it was definitely extraordinary.

The feedback coming from the Ice Cube couldn't possibly be bad.

Moreover, it was related to the Xuan Dan realm.

Coincidentally, he was almost at the Xuan Dan realm himself.

"I'll study it after we get back."

Li Mo retracted his mind and spirit, taking a Six-Striped Pill to regulate his breathing. He looked at the collapsing space and tried to stand up.

However, his internal energy was depleted, and his physical body was severely overdrawn. Just standing up made his vision go black, and he couldn't help but fall.

But then.

A slender, jade-white hand reached out to support him at that moment.

Li Mo looked up. It was none other than the Ice Cube.

Ying Bing bit her red lips for a moment, then said softly:

"Stand firm. Now is not the time for you to fall."

Li Mo: "..."

Sometimes, he really couldn't understand what the Daughter of Destiny was thinking.

He could actually manage on his own...

Well.

Although the Ice Cube was cold to the touch, she was soft and smelled nice. Leaning against her was actually quite comfortable...

In the distance.

A domain, centered around a golden Money Tree, was rapidly approaching.

Elder Qian was almost here.

Li Mo let out a sigh of relief, and his mind finally relaxed completely.

Ying Bing suddenly asked in a soft voice:

"The battle soul behind you... what was that?"

It was clearly the manifestation of the Divine Observation realm.

If it was activated by a secret technique, the price was usually extremely high. For example, even though she was consuming the power already stored within the Blood Phoenix Essence, the burden on her was still immense.

Power that doesn't belong to you often comes with a hefty price.

Li Mo smacked his lips:

"It was a Talisman I got by accident. Unfortunately, it can only be used this one time."

"How are you feeling now?" Ying Bing asked again.

"Ah, I feel terrible."

As soon as Little Li finished speaking, Ying Bing's delicate brows furrowed.

Then, she heard him sigh:

"After experiencing that kind of powerful strength, I feel like I'm so weak now."

"I really want to reach the Divine Observation realm as soon as possible."

Now that the power had left his body, he really wasn't used to it. He felt as if his whole body was as heavy as if it were filled with lead.

"..."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes, her expression complex.

He didn't seem to have any discomfort, which meant that Talisman was of extremely high quality and a very precious item. If he still had that Talisman, she wouldn't be able to rank above him in the next system ranking.

Thinking of this.

A vision flashed through her mind: a少年 (young man) bathing in divine light, looking like a god.

Now Li Mo had lost that Talisman, while she had completely refined the Blood Phoenix Essence.

But why couldn't she feel happy about it?

She had to admit.

If it weren't for him, let alone the Blood Phoenix Essence, she might not even be able to stand here right now...

*Whoosh—*

The Money Tree arrived, enveloping the two of them. It didn't just carry them; it also took in Tang Xiaobao and quite a few other geniuses from various factions.

"No time to explain."

"The Demonic Cultists from the Demon Summoning Sect have arrived, and the battle outside is even more intense."

"I'll take you all to a safe place first."

Qian Bufan stood atop the Golden Tree, saying gravely.

Then, the shadow of the tree enveloped everyone and lifted them into the air.

A large area of space collapsed in front of them.

Old Qian seemed to feel the pain in his wallet. He fished a bar of red gold from his pocket and threw it into the Golden Tree.

His aura suddenly grew stronger.

*BOOM—*

The Golden Tree forcefully rammed its way out.

Li Mo: "...You can get stronger by paying money?"

He suddenly felt that learning Elder Qian's martial arts wasn't a bad idea either.

The other Inner Scenery experts also displayed their own methods. For instance, the middle-aged man in scholar's robes from the Fen Yulin faction, whose domain was like a continuous landscape painting; the old man from the Hengyun Sword City was even more straightforward, transforming into a real giant sword横空 (crossing the sky), sweeping away everything in its path.

Finally.

Everyone rushed out of that secret realm.

*Rumble—*

Old Qian was right.

---

The outside was even more chaotic now. The people from the Demon Summoning Sect had come to provide support and had clashed with the experts from the various factions. For a moment, it was impossible to tell who had the upper hand.

"Yin Hua, you old dog! I've wanted to beat you up for a long time!"

"Hmph, you think you can escape!!?"

A voice, full of murderous intent yet still bright and clear, rang out across the heavens.

A fiery lotus bloomed.

A woman in palace attire punched the half-human, half-dragon Yin Hua Xuan squarely on the head, shattering his dragon horn and sending him crashing through a mountain peak.

"Shang Wu! Don't push me!" Yin Hua Xuan roared in fury.

"Barking like a traitor."

"Heh, compared to me, you're the real traitor..."

As the words fell.

Shang Wu's almond-shaped eyes narrowed slightly, and her pink fists clenched with a cracking sound.

"I, Shang Wu, am the Peak Master Elder of the Qunyu Peak."

"That is all!"

*BOOM—*

And then...

A brutal beatdown ensued.

The half-human, half-dragon body of Yin Hua Xuan was actually used by the woman like a weapon, swung around to smash several Demon Summoning Sect Protectors until they spat blood and retreated in defeat.

Under the Golden Tree, everyone watched, their scalps tingling and their hearts pounding.

"Which sect's elder is that woman?"

"Heavens... she's so brutal."

"Shang Wu? I know about her... I used to think those rumors were exaggerated, but now it seems, they might have been conservative..."

Everyone lowered their heads.

Even Bai Jinghong didn't dare to look in that direction, afraid of being noticed and beaten up along with the others. He was being very honest and well-behaved.

"Ahem, that elder is from our Qingyuan Sect, and she's also..."

"Li Mo's master."

Ouyang said with a bitter smile.

Everyone suddenly understood.

That explains it.

"Senior Brother, you..."

Li Mo couldn't help but hold his forehead.

He wanted to salvage the situation, so he gave everyone a gentle smile:

"Actually, most of my martial arts... I learned them on my own."

"My true expertise is actually the sword..."

*Clatter—*

The Star-Poking Hammer slid out from his sleeve and fell onto the domain.

Everyone: "..."

"Damn it, I forgot to put it away!"

Li Mo picked up the hammer and waved it around in annoyance.

Then he looked at everyone with a friendly expression again:

"You guys know... Huh? Senior Brother Ouyang, why are you kneeling?"

"I believe you!" Tie Qi nodded vigorously.

"I also believe you, Brother Li! You're born to be a dashing swordsman."

"Anyone who says otherwise, I'll fight them!"

Looking at the gleaming hammer in Li Mo's hand, which looked like it could swing down on his head at any moment, Ouyang said righteously.

See, Yin Hua Cheng didn't believe him.

What was his fate?

Bai Jinghong clenched his fists.

He felt in his heart that martial artists who didn't use swords were all vulgar, let alone those who used hammers.

How many famous hammer users are there in the Jianghu?

Coincidentally, Luo Yu thought the same thing.

But he remembered his sister telling him several times about the "Hammer King of the Northwest."

He also remembered the dead Yin Hua Cheng, and the secret realm shattered by a single hammer strike.

"I, Bai Jinghong, admit that your swordsmanship is superior to mine."

"Brother Li, I'm quite familiar with the reporters from the *Nine Heavens Ten Earths Daily*. I'll personally write an article for them to help promote you."

"I'll help with the illustrations, I'll make sure to draw you looking handsome!"

"Keep it low-key, low-key, it's just a虚名 (empty fame)..."

...

While a world-shaking battle raged outside, they were busy spouting nonsense here.

Ying Bing watched the young man, who was putting on a show, acting humble while his嘴角 (corners of his mouth) were harder to suppress than a pig's during New Year's, for a long time.

She couldn't quite figure him out.

He was the one who was always busy in the kitchen at the Qunyu Pavilion.

He was the one who leaped down from the Qingyuan Peak with her.

He was the one who looked like a god of war, standing in front, confidently telling her to refine the Blood Phoenix Essence.

From beginning to end, he hadn't even harbored a single thought about a treasure like the Blood Phoenix Essence.

He's so strange...

In both her past and present lives, Ying Bing had never been so unable to understand a person.
