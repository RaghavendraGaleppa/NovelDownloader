# Chapter 43: Brothers Reunited

After flying for a while in the direction of Weidu, Lu Xu gradually noticed something amiss.

Many people entered and exited Heaven's Gate City daily, so it was normal to see a few streaks of light following him after leaving the city. However, after flying for some time, Lu Xu realized that one particular streak of light consistently tailed him. No matter which direction he flew, the other party followed.

"Is someone following me?"

"Who could it be?"

Lu Xu's brows furrowed. He thought carefully; few people in Heaven's Gate City knew him. He always used his bronze mask to change his appearance whenever he traveled. The appearance altered by the bronze mask was absolutely impenetrable by the Spirit Eye Technique. Unless it was a Foundation Establishment cultivator's divine sense, but Lu Xu had never been involved with any Foundation Establishment cultivator.

The light gradually drew closer. Lu Xu activated his Spirit Eye Technique and saw a burly figure standing on a magical artifact.

"Why does this face look a little familiar!"

After scrutinizing the figure for a few moments, surprise flashed in Lu Xu's eyes:

"Tan Hu?!"

Yes, this face looked remarkably similar to Tan Hu, whom he had killed previously.

"Could it be Tan Hu's relatives or friends seeking revenge? But how did this person find me? Even Gao Tianqiang, who knows me best, couldn't possibly track my whereabouts!"

"Qi Condensation Layer 7. Should I escape?" Lu Xu felt conflicted.

He possessed the Light Breeze Boat. If he activated this flying magical artifact, shaking off the pursuer shouldn't be a problem. However, using the Light Breeze Boat would be too conspicuous, and the pursuer wasn't slow. Even if he could shake him off, it would take a considerable amount of time, causing him to miss this secret market trade fair. Moreover, Lu Xu still hadn't figured out how this person found him, which remained a hidden danger.

"Qi Condensation Layer 7, not impossible to fight. Don't I have over eighty mid-grade talismans? Can't I bury him under them?"

Seeing the light drawing ever closer, Lu Xu could no longer hesitate. He steeled his resolve, and the Azure Radiance Sword beneath his feet trembled, immediately diving towards the mountains and forests below.

"This kid is actually Qi Condensation Layer 6? Didn't A-Qiang say he was Layer 5?"

"Never mind, whether he's Layer 5 or 6, how much combat power can a low-grade talisman master have? How can he possibly contend against a late-stage Qi Condensation cultivator like me?"

A cruel smile appeared on the burly man's face. He had no intention of capturing Lu Xu alive. His sole goal in coming here was to kill the person who might have killed his brother. No! Before killing him, he would torture him thoroughly, interrogating him about how his brother died. If anyone else was involved, he would absolutely not spare them either.

The burly man immediately flew into the forest. As soon as he landed, he saw Lu Xu, shrouded in a golden light, standing there waiting for him. A sinister grin instantly appeared on the burly man's face, and he opened his mouth, about to say something.

"Whoosh!"

Lu Xu didn't waste any words with him. He flicked his hand, and a crimson light shot out fiercely.

Departing Fire Hook!

With his Qi Condensation Layer 6 cultivation, Lu Xu forcibly activated this high-grade magical artifact, sending it hurtling towards the burly man.

"Courting death!"

With a furious roar, the burly man immediately jumped off his flying sword. Then, under his command, the earthy-yellow great sword savagely chopped towards the Departing Fire Hook.

"Clang!"

The two magical artifacts collided, erupting with a loud clang, and the Departing Fire Hook was knocked away. Lu Xu was not surprised by this outcome. Ignoring the Departing Fire Hook, he flipped his palm, revealing a handful of talismans.

"Whoosh!"

A Golden Blade Talisman was activated, and a dazzling golden blade light appeared, swiftly slicing towards the burly man. Following closely, ice cones emerged one after another, releasing an intimidating chill that instantly covered the entire ground with a layer of white frost. Lu Xu's attacks came in continuous waves, without any pause. In the blink of an eye, ten mid-grade talismans had been unleashed.

The burly man was startled by this spectacular display of attacks. He had never seen talismans thrown like this before; these were mid-grade talismans!

"He's not a low-grade talisman master, he's a mid-grade talisman master?!" The burly man was greatly shocked. But he couldn't afford to ponder it further. He quickly pointed a finger, and the earthy-yellow long sword rapidly expanded, turning into a giant sword. He commanded this giant sword to slash at the talismans. With one strike, the golden blade broke; with another, the ice cones shattered.

The power of mid-grade talismans was difficult to withstand against a Qi Condensation Layer 7 cultivator's attacks. However, each time a talisman was blocked, a portion of the burly man's spiritual energy would be consumed. This was equivalent to several mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators continuously attacking him with spells. If this continued for long, his spiritual energy would definitely be depleted.

The burly man glanced at Lu Xu, seeing that the other party was still calmly and unhurriedly activating talismans. His eye twitched involuntarily.

"I can't let this continue!"

The burly man slapped his storage bag, and a few talismans appeared in his hand. With a sweeping motion, a Vajra Talisman appeared, shrouding his body in a golden light barrier. He then consecutively activated several other talismans with his spiritual energy, charging fiercely towards Lu Xu.

"Boom!"

The collision of numerous talismans and magical artifacts unleashed a tremendous roar, dust billowed, and various colored lights flickered erratically.

"Die!"

The burly man roared. He no longer used his magical artifact for defense, planning to let the Vajra Talisman withstand the opponent's talismans while he himself used his magical artifact to quickly slay Lu Xu. With his roar, the earthy-yellow giant sword flew out swiftly, ignoring everything else as it charged towards Lu Xu.

Lu Xu remained unfazed by this sight, continuing to activate various talismans in an orderly fashion: Vajra Talismans, Fiery Flame Talismans, Golden Blade Talismans... He applied five layers of Vajra Talisman shields to his body. At the same time, when he saw the opponent's magical artifact no longer defending but instead attacking, a walnut-sized spherical bead slipped from Lu Xu's sleeve. Unnoticed, it hid behind a ball of flame from a Fiery Flame Talisman and flew towards the opponent.

"Bang!"

The burly man's giant sword struck first, instantly shattering two layers of Vajra Talisman shields and covering the third layer with cracks. Seeing this, the burly man's heart rejoiced, and he quickly commanded the giant sword to strike again.

At this moment!

"Boom!"

An earth-shattering explosion occurred. Flames and lightning intertwined, and several large trees in the forest were directly snapped in half, the terrifying explosion engulfing the entire area.

"Ah!!!"

The explosion was accompanied by a piercing shriek. Fearing his opponent might not be dead, Lu Xu quickly activated three more Fiery Flame Talismans and sent them blasting over. Simultaneously, he once again manipulated the Departing Fire Hook to charge into the cloud of explosive smoke.

Once the smoke cleared, a severely mangled corpse appeared on the ground. Lu Xu quickly moved forward to confirm the burly man's death, then rummaged through his body, finding two storage bags. After collecting the storage bags and picking up the earthy-yellow giant sword that had fallen to the ground, he flicked out a fireball to engulf the corpse.

After destroying the body and erasing all traces, Lu Xu swiftly departed the area.
