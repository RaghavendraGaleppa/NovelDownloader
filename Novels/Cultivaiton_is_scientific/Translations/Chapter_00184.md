# Chapter 184: Resolution

Li Shimin toyed with a black chess piece in his hand. Made from some third-grade material, this piece, along with 180 other black pieces, 180 white pieces, and a chessboard, formed a complete set of magical artifacts.

"What a pity," he sighed softly.

This wasn't the array-deploying artifact he had imagined, but rather a simple concealed weapon-type artifact. The chessboard served as defense, while the 361 black and white pieces functioned as long-range attacks, all controlled by the chessboard.

He even suspected that the creator of this artifact hadn't considered combat at all, but had merely used precious third-grade materials to craft this chess set.

He could sense that this chess set artifact had an owner. Until its master died, it couldn't truly be considered his.

Moreover, even if the Six-Fingered Sound Demon were truly dead, with his current early Foundation Establishment cultivation, he wouldn't be able to use such a high-level artifact, let alone refine it for ownership.

Li Shimin chuckled. He didn't know whether the Six-Fingered Sound Demon had been arrogant, believing that no cultivator entering the ruins could erase the spiritual imprint on the artifact, or whether he thought he could reclaim the artifact at any time given the short distance.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he stored the entire chess set in his Machine Room space, then nodded to Li Yuanba.

Li Yuanba took out the Corpse Storage Bag from his waist and tossed it to Li Shimin, who also stored it in the Machine Room space.

This chess set artifact was a trap set by the Six-Fingered Sound Demon. As long as someone carrying it got close enough to his body, his divine sense could control the chess pieces to attack.

While the chess pieces' attacks weren't particularly powerful, they were absolutely lethal to Foundation Establishment cultivators. Combined with the element of surprise, controlling any intruding cultivator wouldn't be a problem.

To prevent prying eyes, the cave abode was constructed with materials that blocked spiritual senses. Otherwise, at this distance, he could have controlled the chess set with his divine sense.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon, a cunning old fox, had considered multiple possibilities to ensure nothing went wrong.

He never expected Li Shimin to act so unconventionally, using unmanned aerial vehicles—something he'd never seen before—to deliver a massive amount of concrete, trapping him in an inescapable predicament.

The moment Li Shimin stored the chess set in the Machine Room space, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon sensed his connection to the artifact being severed.

A wave of terror washed over him. Severing a master's connection to their artifact was no ordinary feat—it was something even a Golden Core cultivator couldn't achieve.

Inside the Machine Room space, the Jiangshi was released. Under Li Shimin's command, it began attacking the chess set relentlessly.

Though the Jiangshi was only at the peak of the Iron Corpse stage, not yet a Silver Corpse, it retained a considerable amount of sword intent in its bones, imbuing its attacks with additional power.

This sword intent wasn't particularly strong, but the Six-Fingered Sound Demon wasn't at his peak either. Moreover, the chess set was completely cut off from him, like water without a source. The spiritual imprint within it weakened with each strike from the sword intent.

As the chess set was attacked and its spiritual imprint continuously weakened, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's spirit also suffered violent tremors.

Though he couldn't sense the chess set's presence, the spiritual imprint remained connected to him through some unknown means. As the imprint was attacked, the backlash struck his own spirit.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul was wracked with excruciating pain, further damaging his already depleted spirit.

Li Shimin observed the situation inside the Machine Room space. After hundreds of consecutive attacks from the Jiangshi, the spiritual imprint in the chess set was finally erased.

Just as he was about to retrieve the artifact, he heard a piercing shriek—not through his ears, but through his soul.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon could wait no longer. The destruction of his spiritual imprint in the chess set had caused a backlash that left his spirit unable to hold on much longer.

If he didn't act now, he would perish completely.

At this point, his only option was to strike with all his might, seize a cultivator in the main hall, and forcibly possess their body. Only then might he have a sliver of hope for survival.

Without hesitation, he entrusted his soul to his Golden Core. He wanted to take his spatial ring and his lifebound artifact, but with most of his power gone, he lacked the strength to retrieve them from beneath the concrete.

Using the Golden Core as a vessel, he sent it flying from his mouth. The new 130-grade concrete—harder than granite—was as soft as tofu before the Golden Core, which passed through effortlessly.

The Golden Core didn't linger. Every moment the soul spent outside the body in the Golden Core consumed what little remained of his life force.

The Golden Core emerged from the concrete and flew into the garden. Sensing the state of his carefully cultivated plants—most of which had withered from lack of spiritual energy—his hatred for Li Shimin grew even stronger.

The Golden Core shot toward the main hall.

The walls, reinforced with sturdy and fortified runes, were effortlessly pierced by the Golden Core, which entered the hall.

Li Shimin saw the Golden Core—one he recognized all too well.

He stepped back, activating the formation before him. He had considered every possibility, but never imagined a Golden Core cultivator could project their core to attack from a distance.

This was a gap in his knowledge of Golden Core cultivators, stemming from their abilities exceeding his understanding of the world.

The Golden Core plunged into the formation. But the Six-Fingered Sound Demon, a veteran Golden Core cultivator, had dabbled in various disciplines over his long life.

Given his status, even the fragmentary formation knowledge he'd acquired far surpassed what Li Shimin had learned.

The Golden Core moved through the formation like a fish in water, navigating the layers of defensive barriers by following the spiritual energy lines, steadily closing in on Li Shimin.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon didn't use his divine sense—it was too weak. He needed to suppress Li Shimin and Li Yuanba with his Golden Core first, then use his divine sense to seize a body.

Though he didn't use his divine sense, he still sensed Li Yuanba's condition.

Li Yuanba's aptitude was clearly superior to Li Shimin's, and his obvious swordsman traits made the Six-Fingered Sound Demon shift his target almost instantly.

At the same time, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's intention toward Li Shimin turned to murder. Since Li Shimin was no longer useful, he would kill him to vent his hatred.

As the Golden Core drew nearer, Li Shimin sensed overwhelming killing intent.

The formation before him bought him only a moment. The Golden Core's terrifying aura nearly shattered his composure.

When the Golden Core was just fifty centimeters away, a figure suddenly appeared—Li Shimin had summoned the Jiangshi from the Machine Room space.

The Jiangshi's claws struck the Golden Core. With a thunderous boom, the Jiangshi was sent flying, crashing into a wall over ten meters away and leaving a deep dent.

The gap between Golden Core and Foundation Establishment was truly vast.

The Jiangshi was at the peak of Foundation Establishment, even possessing a hint of Golden Core power in some respects.

Yet facing a Golden Core cultivator's core directly, it was flung aside like a child.

Of course, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon didn't fare much better. The sword intent transmitted into the Golden Core, though quickly expelled by the core itself, still affected his soul.

The pain from the sword intent, striking directly at his soul, briefly disrupted his control over the Golden Core.

Seizing the moment, Li Shimin reached out and pressed his hand against the Golden Core. He didn't use any spiritual energy—just physical contact.

Before his fingers even touched the core, the Golden Core's aura shattered his bones, leaving only his thumb—replaced with the sword bone from Golden Core swordsman Yun Xingyi—to make contact.

The moment his thumb touched the Golden Core, he willed it to vanish.

With the Golden Core gone, only the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul remained in the void.

When Li Shimin stored the Golden Core, he hadn't intended to take the soul within it. The Machine Room space, following his will, collected only the core.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul, just recovering from the sword intent's pain, suddenly found the Golden Core it rode in gone—completely beyond its perception.

A strange soul entity emerged, accompanied by ten weaker soul fragments, and pounced on the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul.

This was Li Shimin's primary soul and ten split souls, cultivated through the "Soul Control and Division Technique." Unsure what abilities the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul still possessed, he attacked with everything at his disposal.

The primary soul, having devoured thousands of sea beast souls and numerous Foundation Establishment souls, showed no fear. Devouring souls was its innate purpose, etched deep into its being.

Even as a mere soul, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon was a terrifying presence.

A sweep of his divine sense shattered all ten split souls, leaving only the primary soul, which was sent flying but not destroyed.

In that brief moment, Li Shimin deployed the Nine Palaces Sword Formation, trapping the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul within.

Simultaneously, he prepared the "Lightning Strike Technique" and chanted the "Diamond Sutra" through the "Lotus of Buddhist Sound," a technique particularly effective against souls.

Li Yuanba struck, his sword light carrying an indomitable sword intent aimed at the soul.

The Jiangshi climbed out of the wall, unharmed thanks to its formidable defenses, and charged into battle, attacking the soul as well.

"All of you, die!" the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul roared, unleashing a divine sense blast that sent Li Yuanba, the Jiangshi, and Li Shimin flying.

Even as blood spilled from his mouth mid-flight, Li Shimin continued chanting the "Diamond Sutra"—controlled not by him, but by IBMz15.

The soul's full-force attack left Li Shimin and Li Yuanba seriously injured, though the Jiangshi remained unscathed.

After this final strike, the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul let out a shrill cry of frustration—his last-ditch effort hadn't killed two mere early Foundation Establishment cultivators.

By now, any hope of possession was gone. His soul was too damaged to attempt it.

Yet even his final divine sense attack hadn't killed his enemies, leaving him filled with bitter resentment.

Both Li Shimin and Li Yuanba possessed extraordinary defenses. Though they hadn't practiced body-refining techniques for long, their foundations were exceptionally solid—surpassing many Foundation Establishment cultivators even during Qi Condensation.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon's last attack would have killed ordinary Foundation Establishment cultivators instantly, but for them, it caused only manageable injuries.

Exposed to the outside world for too long and bombarded by the "Diamond Sutra" from the "Lotus of Buddhist Sound," the Six-Fingered Sound Demon's soul could no longer maintain its form.

It grew fainter and fainter, eventually dissipating into the void.

Li Shimin stopped chanting. Exchanging a glance with Li Yuanba, both saw shock in each other's eyes.

Despite all their preparations, they had nearly met their end.

Had they known, they might have simply used explosives to obliterate the cave abode.

But then, little would have remained of its treasures.

"Greed truly brings death," Li Shimin murmured.

Yet knowing that a late Golden Core cultivator's treasures and legacy lay within, how could he not contend for them? To do otherwise would be to abandon cultivation altogether and return to an ordinary life.

His path to power had always been paved with struggle.

His injuries—mostly broken bones—were quickly set and would heal within days, thanks to his body-refining cultivation. The lack of lingering Golden Core spiritual energy in the wounds made recovery far easier.

Li Yuanba's condition was similar, requiring only days to recover.

Li Shimin directed the unharmed Jiangshi to repair the cave abode's formations, restoring them to their original state.

With both him and Li Yuanba injured, they were in no condition to fight.

The Six-Fingered Sound Demon's formations once again enveloped the cave abode, returning everything to how it had been.

Two days later, Li Shimin had recovered enough mobility to lead the Jiangshi to the room where the Six-Fingered Sound Demon had been trapped.

The Jiangshi's claws tore through the hardened concrete with ease.

Li Yuanba stood guard, ensuring no important items were damaged.

Meanwhile, Li Shimin entered an adjacent room to inspect the cave abode.

This was a bedroom, furnished like a mortal's—a bed of spiritual wood, blankets of spirit silk used for crafting robes, and a pillow of spiritual jade.

Every item in the room was made from second-grade materials, a level of luxury only a Golden Core cultivator could afford.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, Li Shimin collected everything into his storage bracelet. Whether for decoration, repurposing into artifacts, or selling, their value was considerable.
