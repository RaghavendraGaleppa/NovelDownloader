# Chapter 180: The Map Revealed (Bonus Chapter for Tom2017)

Yi Lingling felt her entire body go cold. Due to the effects of the formation array, she couldn't clearly see the battle between Li Shiming and Li Yuanba, but the battlefield revealed after the Nine Palaces Sword Formation was withdrawn left her utterly shocked.

Five Foundation Establishment cultivators—including one mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator and Yi Yichen, the son of a Golden Core cultivator—had all been killed on the spot.

If one were to speak of who died most unjustly here, it would undoubtedly be Yi Yichen, the son of a Golden Core cultivator. Li Shiming had immediately deployed a formation array upon attacking, rendering Yi Yichen's various means useless. When Yi Yichen finally decided to use his talisman treasure, Li Shiming ended him with a single shot from his top-grade magical artifact, the electromagnetic cannon. All of Yi Yichen's life-saving measures were rendered ineffective by this instant kill.

Li Shiming paid no attention to Yi Lingling. He collected all the corpses into a storage bag, along with all the spoils of battle, and tossed them into his machine room space. He had experience dealing with the consequences of offending Golden Core cultivators.

Battle traces needed to be cleaned up, and none of the spoils could be used until he had a powerful backing or joined a major sect. His spiritual sense swept repeatedly over the battlefield, ensuring nothing was left behind, before he grabbed Yi Lingling, switched to another flying boat, and headed into the distance.

Under the effects of the Binding Spirit Rope, Yi Lingling wanted to speak but couldn't control her body. Li Shiming's spiritual sense swept over her, and soon her storage bag was taken, along with a jade hairpin from her hair, a jade pendant from her chest, and a pair of jade bracelets from her wrists.

Yi Lingling was quite beautiful, but Li Shiming felt no attraction. In the world of cultivation, who knew how old a beautiful woman might be? Especially among Foundation Establishment female cultivators, their ages could range from thirty to a hundred. Moreover, Yi Lingling was an enemy—one involved in matters concerning a Golden Core cultivator. No matter what, she had to be silenced.

Yi Lingling wasn't just physically cold; her heart was frozen with fear. She had already realized Li Shiming's intentions—once he finished interrogating her, she would end up like the other cultivators. The way Li Shiming methodically cleaned up the battlefield showed he was no stranger to killing. His calm and thorough handling of the aftermath was not something an ordinary cultivator could manage.

Yi Lingling glanced at Li Yuanba. In her heart, he was a thousand times better than Li Shiming. Though she had been defeated and captured by Li Yuanba, he was just too handsome.

As her thoughts wandered, Li Shiming found a hidden cave. With a sweep of his spiritual sense, he drove out a black bear inside and cleared the foul air before dragging Yi Lingling in.

---

Li Yuanba took out thirty-six formation flags and arranged them at the cave entrance, setting up an array that isolated spiritual fluctuations while also providing defensive effects.

Li Shiming tossed Yi Lingling onto the ground and took out the Soul-Piercing Needle.

"Name?" he asked coldly, loosening the Binding Spirit Rope's restriction on her speech just enough for her to answer.

"My name is Yi Lingling, I'm—" As soon as she spoke, an excruciating pain seared through her soul, cutting her off mid-sentence. Tears and snot streamed down her face uncontrollably—this level of pain was unbearable even for a Foundation Establishment cultivator, let alone a female one.

"Answer only what I ask. Any extra words or lies will be punished," Li Shiming said icily.

Yi Lingling blinked rapidly, signaling her understanding. She no longer had any other thoughts—Li Shiming's ruthlessness had terrified her.

In the cultivation world, who would spend resources crafting a torture artifact unless they had a particular inclination? And yet, Li Shiming had a whole set of such artifacts. The Binding Spirit Rope and Soul-Piercing Needle were precisely that. They had been useless on Heavenly Island, but here in Northern Shu, they proved their worth.

"Where is Treasure Mountain? Who is Yi Zhen?" Li Shiming demanded.

Yi Lingling looked surprised. She hadn't expected there to be cultivators in this region who didn't know about Treasure Mountain or Yi Zhen.

"Treasure Mountain is the largest power within ten thousand miles. Yi Zhen is its master, a mid-Golden Core cultivator," she answered succinctly, fearing the Soul-Piercing Needle.

"And the young cultivator leading the group earlier—what was his relation to Yi Zhen?"

"Yi Yichen was Yi Zhen's only son." After answering, Yi Lingling stole a glance at Li Shiming and saw his expression darken.

Li Shiming shook his head. This was truly an unforeseen disaster. Did he have some kind of feud with Golden Core cultivators? He had only been in Northern Shu for a short time, yet he'd already killed another Golden Core cultivator's son.

But what was done was done. He'd just have to be more careful in the future. He believed he had cleaned up the battlefield thoroughly enough that Yi Zhen would have a hard time tracing it back to him.

"What did you take that made Yi Yichen chase you?" Li Shiming continued.

He hadn't checked Yi Lingling's storage bag yet—the items weren't going anywhere, and he could inspect them after questioning.

"I obtained a spirit zither at an auction in Tianhua Mountain. Someone recognized it as an artifact once used by the Six-Fingered Tone Demon. The rumors spiraled out of control, claiming the zither was a key to the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's hidden cave abode, containing its location and entry method," Yi Lingling confessed honestly.

---

Li Shiming knew nothing about the Six-Fingered Tone Demon, but he assumed it must have been a powerful cultivator from history. His knowledge in this area was severely lacking, but that wasn't something he could remedy quickly.

His spiritual sense swept through Yi Lingling's storage bag, retrieving two identical boxes—likely one was meant to deceive him. He opened both, revealing two guqins.

One had clear spiritual artifact fluctuations, but upon closer inspection, it was merely a facade. The other, which showed no such fluctuations, felt peculiar to him.

This was Li Shiming's first encounter with such an artifact. Though sound-based techniques were common on Heavenly Island—he had mastered the Buddhist "Lotus from the Mouth" and the demonic "Demonic Tone Pierces the Ear," even combining them into "Demonic Lotus Tone"—this was his first time seeing a sound-based spiritual artifact like the guqin.

His spiritual sense swept over the guqin but found no obvious markings.

"If you suspected this guqin had nothing to do with the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's cave, why didn't you just hand it over?" Li Shiming asked, puzzled.

"Because Yi Yichen sent people to find me. He offered to buy it at double the auction price. At the time, I was still in Tianhua Mountain, and he didn't dare to take it by force there. Given his status, if he hadn't learned something, he wouldn't have made such an offer. Treasure Mountain's influence is vast—their knowledge of the cultivation world far surpasses ours," Yi Lingling admitted, knowing she couldn't hide the truth.

Li Shiming nodded slowly. A spark of lightning appeared at his fingertip, dancing across the guqin's surface.

Refining the guqin didn't take long—just ten breaths, and he had refined about a tenth of it. As he did, a stream of information entered his mind.

The guqin was named the "Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin." Just the name alone revealed the demonic nature of the Six-Fingered Tone Demon. Apart from Buddhist cultivators, nearly all cultivators referred to their ultimate goal as the "Dao." Daoist cultivators in particular placed the Dao Ancestor on equal footing with the Dao itself.

The Six-Fingered Tone Demon's naming of the guqin as the "Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin" was a blatant disregard for the Dao. Li Shiming couldn't fathom why the demon had chosen such a name.

Along with the guqin's name, a piece of music called the "Annihilation Tone" also entered his mind.

Li Shiming had never learned to play the guqin. As his fingers plucked at the strings aimlessly, his consciousness connected to IBMZ15, beginning to study guqin techniques.

Yi Lingling listened to the discordant, meaningless notes, unsure what Li Shiming was trying to do. It was clear he had no idea how to play.

---

Just as she was thinking this, Li Shiming had already mastered the basics of guqin playing. Through his earlier random plucking, he had also familiarized himself with the sound characteristics of the Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin.

He sat cross-legged, placing the guqin on his lap. Recalling the Annihilation Tone in his mind, a trace of Wood Thunder spiritual power gathered at his fingertips.

A strange melody began to flow from his fingers. The Annihilation Tone carried a hatred for the world, a desire for destruction. In his mind's eye, he saw the earth splitting, mountains collapsing, seas flooding the land, and life withering into bones.

Unconsciously, Li Shiming fell into this vision. Just then, IBMZ15 issued a warning, snapping him out of it.

Above the Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin, a map had appeared, with a bright dot marking a location. Beside it was an incantation for entering the formation.

IBMZ15 recorded both the map and the incantation. Li Shiming exhaled deeply and stopped playing.

His consciousness was linked with Li Yuanba's, so when he regained clarity, so did Li Yuanba.

A wave of fear washed over Li Shiming. He was the one playing the guqin, and the Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin wasn't even fully refined, yet it had already exerted such terrifying power, pulling him into that horrifying vision. Had he been fully immersed in that world-destroying vision, he had no idea what might have happened.

When he thought of Yi Lingling, he realized just how terrifying the effects of the "Annihilation Tone" were.

Yi Lingling, who had appeared to be in her twenties, now looked like a woman in her seventies. Her once-lustrous hair had turned into dry straw, and her life force had vanished.

Under normal circumstances, Yi Lingling wouldn't have been affected so quickly. But restrained by the Binding Spirit Rope and traumatized by the Soul-Piercing Needle, her spirit was already weakened. Hearing the Annihilation Tone, she had fallen into the horrific vision, dragged into oblivion as the world in the melody was destroyed.

Li Shiming shook his head. He had suspected Yi Lingling was much older than she appeared. Her earlier attempts to seduce him into sparing her now struck him as utterly repulsive.

With a flick of his finger, a spark of Fire Thunder spiritual power landed on Yi Lingling's corpse. Without the protection of life force, even a Foundation Establishment cultivator's body couldn't withstand it. Within moments, only ashes remained.

He sat back down. Though the Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin was unsettling to use, its power was undeniable.

---

Sound-based attacks had the unique advantage of wide coverage and being difficult to defend against. Unfortunately, Li Shiming's use of the guqin was still at a rudimentary level—far from unleashing the true might of the Annihilation Tone.

He didn't know who the Six-Fingered Tone Demon was, but he now had a clearer understanding of the Annihilation Tone's power.

From the soundwave data collected by IBMZ15, the Annihilation Tone's frequencies were bizarre, constantly pushing beyond normal auditory limits. Moreover, the melody had a psychological effect, subtly drawing listeners into its destructive vision, damaging their souls until they were utterly destroyed.

Of course, this was the combined effect of the Annihilation Tone and the Earth Tone Annihilation Guqin. Li Shiming couldn't imagine how much more devastating it could be with proper technique.

His interest in the Six-Fingered Tone Demon's cave abode grew. Previously, he hadn't cared much about hidden caves. On Heavenly Island, rumors of such places were rare—the island had long been dominated by the seven sects, and all powerful cultivators belonged to them. Any caves they left behind wouldn't be their main abodes, and the treasures within would be limited. A sect cultivator's primary abode would always be within their sect, where it was safe and had ample spiritual energy.

Though he was now somewhat intrigued by the cave, he needed to gather more information about the Six-Fingered Tone Demon before making a decision.

Truthfully, if not for the Annihilation Tone's formidable power, he might have ignored the cave altogether. At the very least, he wouldn't have explored it before joining a major sect. Right now, he had sufficient resources and techniques—there was no urgent need for more.

But the Annihilation Tone had piqued his curiosity. Compared to it, his "Demonic Lotus Tone" seemed like child's play.

Li Shiming directed IBMZ15 to compare the map obtained from the guqin with known maps of Northern Shu. He wasn't very familiar with the region, but he had acquired maps from the Golden Core sword cultivator Yun Xingyi and the Wei family's library.

While such terrain comparisons might take a cultivator years, IBMZ15 completed the task in seconds.

Before Li Shiming's eyes appeared a map of the Hundred Thousand Mountains, with the location marked. IBMZ15 also provided the safest route based on the previous maps.

The areas he had traversed before might have seemed like remote wilderness, but they were actually well-trodden paths confirmed safe by cultivators. The Hundred Thousand Mountains weren't inhabited solely by humans—countless other beings, including powerful spirit beasts, dwelled there.

The danger zones marked on the maps indicated areas with confirmed powerful spirit beasts, making passage highly risky. Still, humans—particularly cultivators—dominated the Hundred Thousand Mountains, keeping the spirit beasts in check and coexisting with them.
