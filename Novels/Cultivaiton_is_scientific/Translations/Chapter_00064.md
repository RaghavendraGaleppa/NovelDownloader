# Chapter 64: Farewell  

After reaching the third level of Qi Refinement, Li Shiming noticed that the speed at which the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" enhanced his spiritual energy vortex had significantly slowed down.  

With daily cultivation using the Spirit Gathering Plate, it would take him at least two years to reach the fourth level of Qi Refinement. However, the amount of spiritual energy he could now utilize had greatly increased, prompting him to consider imprinting his mark on the high-grade wooden sword artifact.  

"Painting the Dragon!" As his fingers lightly tapped the wooden sword, the runic formations within it faintly appeared. His fingers swept over the formations, and the "Dragon-Dotting Technique" made the patterns clearer.  

"Dotting the Eyes!" Three bright spots emerged on the sword's runic formations, and he pressed down on each with his fingers.  

"So, your name is Green Kite Wooden Sword!" Li Shiming held the small wooden sword, a smile forming on his face.  

He attempted to channel his spiritual energy into the Green Kite Wooden Sword. Instantly, half of his spiritual energy was drained away. Just as he marveled at how much energy the sword had absorbed, he suddenly felt as though the sword was about to slip from his grasp.  

He released his hold, and the small wooden sword hovered in the air. He hadn't used the "Object Control Technique"—the sword was floating on its own.  

"Go!" Relying on his connection with the sword, he waved his hand, and the Green Kite Wooden Sword shot forward.  

That single motion drained the remaining half of his spiritual energy, leaving only a trace to barely sustain the operation of his spiritual energy vortex.  

He quickly stopped controlling the sword, which had already plunged into the ground. Fortunately, his spiritual energy was insufficient; otherwise, he would have had to dig up the ground to retrieve it.  

"Can this be considered a flying sword?" Li Shiming mused about the sensation of using the Green Kite Wooden Sword. He recalled the scene of Elder Cui wielding sword light, though their techniques were incomparable. Still, the wooden sword had indeed flown through the air according to his will.  

In the days that followed, Li Shiming added several new tasks to his daily spiritual energy expenditure. Aside from the fixed consumption of the "Spring Rain Technique," he also practiced the "Dragon-Dotting Technique."  

The Blazing Flame Sword, the Green Kite Wooden Sword, and a white robe artifact called the "Breeze Robe" became his focus. Fortunately, after reaching the third level of Qi Refinement, his spiritual energy had more than doubled, allowing him to sustain such consumption.  

As his connection with these artifacts deepened, he found it easier to wield the Blazing Flame Sword, using it like a conventional weapon.  

However, the Blazing Flame Sword still couldn't be freely controlled with the "Object Control Technique." He guessed the reason—it was likely a handheld low-grade artifact. To use it like a flying sword, he would probably need to learn the corresponding sword techniques.  

---  

After strengthening his bond with the Green Kite Wooden Sword, Li Shiming could now control it to perform a flying strike—though only once. A single strike consumed over half of his spiritual energy, leaving him unable to perform a second.  

Still, the flying strike of the Green Kite Wooden Sword was his most powerful attack. He felt certain that its strike was unstoppable.  

As for the Breeze Robe, it wasn’t a defensive artifact as he had initially thought, but rather a speed-enhancing one. When activated, it granted him the effects of the "Light Body Technique."  

To be honest, he wasn’t entirely satisfied with this effect. Although he possessed two defensive artifacts—a low-grade shield and a mid-grade shield—both bore the Hao family’s mark and couldn’t be used here.  

He would have to wait until leaving Zhongdu before attempting to refine the mid-grade shield for his own use.  

By the end of September, the anticipated retaliation from the Netherdark Sect still hadn’t arrived. It was as if the sect was unaware that one of its members had perished in Zhongdu.  

On the last night of September, Li Shiming summoned Siqin, Moyan, and Steward Zhang.  

Siqin already knew part of his plans. When Moyan and Steward Zhang entered the study, they found her in tears.  

"Steward Zhang, this is a letter for my father. If I don’t return tomorrow, please deliver it to him," Li Shiming said, handing over the envelope.  

"Young Master, what is this about?" Steward Zhang asked, bewildered as he accepted the letter.  

Of course, he wasn’t a fool. He had noticed something unusual about the young master.  

The young master had earned the title of Tanhua (third-place scholar in imperial examinations) and received lavish rewards from the emperor, yet was only granted an honorary position—something highly irregular.  

If the emperor didn’t value the young master, why had he bestowed such excessive rewards?  

"I’ve corresponded with my father and decided to join a cultivation sect. He has agreed," Li Shiming explained with a smile.  

His father, Li Wenyuan, had been extremely supportive. In his reply, he expressed concern but did not oppose his decision.  

To Li Wenyuan, his son was grown and had the right to choose his own path—just as he himself had once defied the Zhongdu Li family for the sake of his wife and left for Nanling Prefecture.  

Speaking of the Zhongdu Li family, after Li Shiming received the "Jinshi Jidi" plaque (honoring his imperial examination achievement), a clan elder had come to take it back to the ancestral hall.  

However, Li Shiming hadn’t even allowed the elder to enter his home. Unless his father changed his mind, he had no intention of reconnecting with the Zhongdu Li family.  

---  

Steward Zhang was stunned. Living in Zhongdu, how could he not have heard of the legends of immortals?  

Though information was tightly controlled, the recent massacre of dozens of households in the city—reportedly due to battles between immortals—couldn’t be completely suppressed.  

"Moyan, learn well from Steward Zhang. Be steady in your temperament," Li Shiming instructed Moyan.  

"Young Master…" Moyan responded gloomily.  

Li Shiming had arranged for him to become a steward, and Steward Zhang understood the implication.  

"Siqin, I’ve left you some silver. In my letter to Father, I’ve also asked him to find you a good match when you come of age," he said softly, turning to Siqin.  

She was the one he worried about most. If not for the sect’s prohibition against bringing mortals, he would have taken her with him.  

"Young Master, I don’t want you to go!" Siqin burst into tears, clutching his sleeve.  

"It’s not like I’ll never return. In three to five years at most, I’ll be able to leave the sect on business and come back to see you," Li Shiming reassured her gently.  

He had left her a thousand taels of silver and several exquisite pieces of jewelry—mundane items he had obtained from cultivators’ storage pouches.  

Since he couldn’t stay with her, this was the least he could do.  

"Promise you’ll come back to see me," Siqin whispered, her voice so soft that neither Moyan nor Steward Zhang heard.  

But Li Shiming, with his heightened senses, heard every word.
