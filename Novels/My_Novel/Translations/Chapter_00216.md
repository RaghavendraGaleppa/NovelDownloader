Chapter 216: The Dragon General Returns to the Sea, Words Shatter the Zen Heart

Li Xian felt a prickling sensation on his back as he looked at Wen Caishang.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Go ahead and speak boldly. Will I blame you?" She also wanted to hear, her eyes hidden with anticipation. She thought to herself, "Let's see how this小子 tries to explain."

Li Xian pondered: *The Madam is truly vicious. My relationship with her is very close. It's not strange anymore to have skin-to-skin contact. However, regarding the nature of our relationship, I really am unsure! Forget it... It is better to speak of it extravagantly than lightly. I should make it sound sickeningly sweet.*

Li Xian formulated his words and said, "Since Elder Old Dragon wants to hear, and the Madam has agreed. Then I shall speak. The Madam and I are truly..."

Suddenly, the python蛟 let out a piercing shriek. The water surface boiled, and the ship shook violently.

The python蛟 rolled in the river, instantly covered in countless wounds, blood flowing non-stop. However, looking around, the river channel was wide, and there were no experts blocking the way on both banks.

There was no reason for it, and no experts around.

Wen Caishang frowned, sensing something was wrong. She flipped her sleeve and drew a sword, plunging it into the river. She retracted her sleeve and sword, holding a red shrimp beast in her hand.

It was the size of a palm, with pincers like iron. It turned out that in this stretch of water, someone had raised "Red Pincer Shrimps," a type of aquatic pest. They were the great enemy of sailing ships.

The iron pincers were powerful enough to drill through the hull.

Wherever Red Pincer Shrimps ran rampant, there were sure to be river bandits.

Wen Caishang said calmly, "Little Xian, go to my room and fetch that jar of wine."

Li Xian did as told and brought the fine wine. He uncorked it and poured it into the river. The Red Pincer Shrimps all got drunk and fell over, truly strange.

Not long after, river dolphins smelled the alcohol and swam over, competing to eat the Red Pincer Shrimps. A great crisis was resolved with ease.

Li Xian sighed with emotion: *The Madam is knowledgeable and wise, truly having made full preparations. By her side, I can truly learn much of the ways of the Jianghu and the philosophy of life.*

The python蛟 spat out several mouthfuls of foul air and cursed, "Damn it! A group of little shrimps, are you rebelling against the heavens? You actually want to eat me!"

It had been besieged by a swarm of shrimps. The scabs left by the lightning tribulation were torn open and bleeding. Old wounds had not healed, and new ones were added. Although its whole body was golden, indistinguishable from a dragon, it was extremely disheveled, with none of a dragon's dignity.

Wen Caishang sat sideways, her waist curve fully displayed, and said, "Is it surprising? When a python蛟 takes to the water, the heavens and earth are enemies. Besides, aren't there many people who want to eat you?"

The python蛟 fell silent, its mood gloomy. Having reached this point, it was exhausted and its energy was fading. Whether it could enter the sea and transform into a dragon now depended entirely on Wen Caishang's assistance.

The python蛟 praised, "Brother Li, your Madam is truly extraordinary. If she can help me transform into a dragon today, she might not be unable to help you reach great heights in the future."

Li Xian thought secretly: *Although Elder Dragon's words were unintentional, they serve to sow discord. Is he trying to harm me? How could the Madam help me reach the top? She would never allow me to be higher than the hem of her skirt.*

He remained清醒ly aware that the kindness was real, and the shackles were also real. He said, "Elder Old Dragon, you are mistaken. Why would the Madam need to help me? The Madam herself has the ability to reach high places..."

Wen Caishang interrupted softly, "Are you blaming me for not helping you?"

Li Xian said, "I absolutely do not mean that. My current cultivation is entirely due to the Madam's help. What I said just now meant that I have no intention of competing for height with the Madam. It was just a slip of the tongue..."

"Enough," Wen Caishang said. "You are the one I cultivated. I know your nature."

Wen Caishang walked over slowly and said, "You are young, and you should have the ambition to climb high. How could I blame you? We have been traveling by boat for days, and there were many eyes and ears on the ship. Now it is quiet and peaceful, the water is neither急 nor slow. This rare river scenery is nice. Come and massage my feet."

Li Xian was quite practiced. He took off her boots and placed her fair feet on his knees. Wen Caishang said, "Lift my skirt a little."

The implication was: *You should have the heart to climb high. I need to see your high spirits to appreciate and love you. But you must remain under my skirt, holding up the hem of my skirt, to be obedient and reassuring.*

The skirt was lifted, revealing fair ankles. A red thread was tied on the left ankle, adding a touch of brilliance. After days of travel on the river, the Madam had also broken a slight sweat, and a faint scent of it could be smelled.

Wen Caishang felt very pleased. Feeling the touch at her feet, she felt peaceful and calm. She gently pressed and played with the red mole between Li Xian's eyebrows, thinking to herself: *My things, in my hands, there is no reason to lose them.*

*No matter how talented you are, what can you do?*

She slightly raised her foot, the tip of her toes pressing against Li Xian's throat, her toes gently turning and prodding.

The python蛟 submerged into the river. It knew it had spoken improperly. Its original words were meant to praise Wen Caishang's extreme power. Upon reflection, Wen Caishang values profit and benefit highly; why would she help others climb high for no reason? With that energy, wouldn't it be better for her to climb even higher herself?

The nine-thousand-mile river channel gradually widened.

Along the way, they encountered several dangers and obstacles. But all were resolved by Wen Caishang's wisdom.

The journey was nearing its end.

At forty-three thousand miles.

Suddenly, a strange sound was heard. From both banks of the river, someone laughed loudly and said, "Friend from afar, if you can break my tune, this wide river is yours to travel as you please."

With that, an ethereal jade flute sound rose.

The flute melody was gentle and soothing, confusing the mind. After hearing the first three notes, eyelids grew heavy, and a heavy sleepiness descended. After hearing the next three notes, breathing became light, as if one had already fallen asleep.

After hearing several more, the heartbeat gradually stopped, and blood flow ceased. It was at this moment that the flute sound suddenly became piercingly harsh, making one spiritually invigorated and filled with rage.

But it was too late. The body was no longer under one's own control. Blood did not flow, the heart did not beat. Only the fading spirit remained, tortured by the demonic sound.

Falling into great panic, suffocating to death in despair. Such a death was truly extremely cruel. Not a drop of blood was seen, yet it made one wish for a swift beheading.

Wen Caishang said, "So it is an expert from the Niao Yue Mountain. Since you hide your head and show your tail, not daring to show yourself, and use sound to kill Caishang. Very well... To not return a courtesy is rude. Please listen, everyone."

She捏 formed a strange hand gesture and blew. A whistling sound spread out, and the flute sound immediately stopped. Wen Caishang snorted coldly, changed her hand gesture, and whistled again.

The whistle was sharp and piercing, spreading out again. The river surface splashed with dense water, and the rocks on both banks trembled violently.

"Stop! Stop... We have lost, spare us, please spare us!" Wails came from both banks.

Wen Caishang said, "Since Caishang has started playing, how can I not finish to my heart's content? You gentlemen may listen a little longer." Her hands changed again, complex and connected, the hand seals intricate. Her red lips blew again.

This time, the whistle was incredibly muffled, shaking the mountain body slightly. In the distant high mountains, a huge boulder was shaken loose. It rolled down violently and crashed into the river.

"Petty thieves," Wen Caishang said calmly.

No more sound was heard as the river boat sailed past.

The hidden figures who had been playing the flute earlier all had blood flowing from their five orifices, their eye sockets ruptured, dying miserably on the spot. Their corpses lay strewn across the bank.

Li Xian sighed: *Such a powerful martial art! Such terrifying methods... I still cannot fathom the Madam's foundation. Even if I have the diligence rewarded by the heavens, without strange encounters, it would likely take a long time of tempering to surpass the Madam.*

*But there is no rush. I must steady my pace. Bit by bit, progress is enough. Surpassing the Madam... is my first goal!*

Li Xian's cultivation was still shallow, so he did not understand the profound mystery within. Otherwise, he would have been even more shocked. Wen Caishang is indeed proficient in music, but those three whistles just now were not musical martial arts, but boxing techniques!

She has dabbled in many powerful martial arts, integrating them, her understanding of martial principles is breathtaking. What she just施展ed was the "Five Elements Long Fist." But she used it with a whistle, blasting out with strong internal energy.

These flute-playing assassins all died from their five organs being destroyed. They died from boxing, yet had no boxing wounds.

The python蛟, though old in age, did not know either.

They continued on.

At forty-five thousand miles.

The Ben Hua River flows into Yu Nan Dao, Qiong Shan Prefecture. They passed through a rarely traversed jungle.

Trees on both banks towered high, with venomous snakes coiled among the branches. Wen Caishang asked the kitchen for meat ingredients and threw them into the river. Countless piranhas swam over to compete for the food.

Just as they were relaxing...

Suddenly, they saw ahead...

A one-armed old man, legs crossed, sitting cross-legged on a bamboo stalk. He pressed the bamboo down so it bent, hanging right in the middle of the river channel.

This man had protruding lips and no cheeks, with fur on his face. He resembled a monkey or ape.

"This Old Man is an ascetic monk cultivating within Yu Nan Dao. My dharma name is Yuan Seng. I pity the python蛟 entering the sea, stirring wind and waves, causing floods to overflow and the livelihoods of the people to wither. Thus, I block the way here. Please, benefactor, turn back."

The Yuan Seng spoke calmly, his Zen aura thick.

Li Xian thought: *It sounds nice, but ultimately it's just for his own benefit.* He already knew this was an enemy, not a friend, so there was no need for courtesy. Intending to tease him, he asked curiously, "Elder Old Ancestor, are you a real monkey or a fake monkey?"

Yuan Seng said calmly, "All things rise equally. What difference is there between being human, monkey, or ape? Whether I am human or monkey, let you say as you please."

Li Xian said, "Elder is broad-minded, this junior admires you. But there is one matter I ask of you, hoping you will agree."

"If it is to ask me to move aside, benefactor, there is no need to speak further," Yuan Seng said.

Li Xian said, "How could I speak of such a俗 matter."

"Oh?" Yuan Seng said, "Then speak, let me hear."

Li Xian said, "I ask the Elder to turn around and take off your pants. I want to see if your butt is red or not."

Wen Caishang "pfft" laughed, and the python蛟 laughed so hard it rolled, saying, "This小子, truly interesting."

"Old monkey, did you hear? Let us three have a look at your butt."

Yuan Seng stood up in anger and cursed, "Brat, how dare you humiliate me!" Li Xian said, "It seems the Elder is a monkey, not a human. Your butt is very red. I already know, you don't need to take off your pants."

Yuan Seng roared, "Brat, come here and die!"

He leaped from the bamboo and attacked主动ly.

Li Xian took half a step back, standing behind the Madam. Wen Caishang struck out with a palm, the air wave knocking Yuan Seng back more than ten zhang.

Li Xian said, "It seems the Elder has not seen through the physical appearance. It is truly a pity, truly a pity. The common people of the world do not need a monkey to worry about them."

Yuan Seng was furious. He possessed the Rebirth Phase [Zen Monkey Form], a rare treasure form of Buddhism, with great wonders in cultivating Zen. Having chanted Buddha's name for many years, he believed he had cast off all appearances, his Zen heart clear and bright.

However, deep down, he actually hated this appearance. Usually, he was powerful, respected, and virtuous, admired by others, so he had not noticed.

Today, suffering such humiliation, he wanted to argue, but found it hard to express. Moreover, although Li Xian's words were harsh, they contained a bit of sincerity.

"Hm?"

Yuan Seng was stunned, suddenly feeling his internal energy running amok.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Elder Old Ape, you have cultivated Buddhism for decades, yet you don't even know if you are human or monkey. Truly pitiable, truly pitiable."

"The phrase 'a monkey wearing a cap' is truly tailored for you."

Yuan Seng was extremely angry, but feeling his internal energy running amok and his mind wavering, he had no time to worry about the dragon-slaying matter.

He let out a long howl and flew away.

Wen Caishang covered her mouth and laughed, finding Li Xian increasingly interesting. This Yuan Seng was an extremely powerful martial artist in Yu Nan Dao.

He was actually driven away by a few words.

The python蛟 swam in the river, thinking: *These two men and women are quite a match. Wen Caishang is knowledgeable and her martial arts are terrifying. This小子 is sharp-tongued and very clever. If it weren't for him on this trip, it would have been quite troublesome.*

Forty-eight thousand miles.

They had traveled ninety-nine percent of the way.

Today, the river was calm and windless.

A black iron ship stood across the way. The hull was pitch black, towering a black flag. The flagpole was gold, carved with exquisite patterns, and the flag was embroidered with dragon patterns.

Wen Caishang frowned and muttered, "The Black Dragon Cult?"

At the bow of the ship, a middle-aged man stood proudly, his clothes fluttering, saying calmly, "I didn't expect the python蛟's journey to the water to reach this place."

At the bow of the ship stood a middle-aged man.
