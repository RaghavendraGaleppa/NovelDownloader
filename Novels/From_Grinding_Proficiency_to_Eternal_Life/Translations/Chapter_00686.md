# Chapter 686: All Trapped in the Jar

Orion, the God of Light, let out a piercing psychic shriek. His divine body shattered piece by piece in the starlight, ultimately transforming into a pure source of light origin that was forcibly absorbed by the Starry Banner.

The massive body of the Nature Lord, Orion, rapidly withered and weathered after the force of all things' vitality was stripped away. In the end, only a jade-green crystal containing immense natural life force remained, which also plunged into the banner.

On the other side, the extraction of Dongming Zhenjun was nearing its end.

As the last wisp of the dark and profound power of Eternal Night's Fall was devoured by the Nine Abyss Evil Mist, the Dark God Ymir's divine body completely turned into nothingness. Only that pitch-black Dao Fruit, radiating a cold and extinguishing aura, remained. Dongming Zhenjun carefully sealed it within a bone jade treasure chest using a profound evil secret method.

To utilize these unorthodox Dao Fruits, one needed a considerable amount of time to refine them to match one's own Dao Fruit; otherwise, it would be detrimental.

The sky of the Aetila World seemed to let out a heavy, sorrowful lament.

The brilliance of the three Great Gods' authorities had completely faded. The world's Heavenly Dao origin suffered a heavy blow, falling into an unprecedented silence and weakness.

Betrayed, the world's Heavenly Dao naturally sensed Xu Yunfan's treachery and immediately unleashed endless divine punishment, wanting to kill him.

Xu Yunfan accepted it all without refusal.

After bombarding him for a while and finding it could do nothing to Xu Yunfan, the Heavenly Dao could only helplessly withdraw and fall silent.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan收回了 his Star Spirit Banner. He sensed the two newly acquired Dao Fruit authorities within the banner, along with the Chiyang Dao Fruit he had previously suppressed, but felt little joy in his heart.

His mind was on the escaped Tongxuan Zhenjun.

Golden Core Zhenjun, especially sword cultivators from the Wansheng Sword Sect who are unparalleled in their offensive prowess, were indeed extremely difficult to kill.

Tongxuan Zhenjun used a precious sword Dao spiritual treasure as the price, escaping right under the noses of two Zhenjun of the same level. This decisiveness and life-preserving ability made Xu Yunfan extremely wary.

If he hadn't借了 the suppression of the Aetila Heavenly Dao and the restraint of Zhang Ziyang's incense-fire divine path, and taken Chiyang by surprise, the outcome would have been hard to predict.

Dongming Zhenjun looked at the empty界海 (World Sea) and fell silent.

Although this battle had yielded the Eternal Night's Fall Dao Fruit, it had also completely offended the Wansheng Sword Sect. Furthermore, Xu Yunfan's growth and scheming made her even more wary of him.

The sky of the Aetila World was filled with cracks left by the annihilation of energy, and the aftershocks of the three Great Gods' authorities' destruction were still reverberating.

Xu Yunfan收回了 his Star Spirit Banner. The two newly suppressed Dao Fruit authorities within the banner, All Things' Vitality and Great Light's Immeasurability, were faintly restless, while the Chiyang Dao Fruit was tightly bound by a purple-gold lightning net.

Dongming Zhenjun played with the bone jade treasure chest that sealed the Eternal Night's Fall Dao Fruit. The tip of her finger, wreathed in Nine Abyss Evil Mist, brushed over the surface of the chest, her eyes filled with delight.

With this Dao Fruit, her cultivation would surely advance another step.

The two of them stood on a piece of shattered ruins, beneath their feet lay dried-up divine blood and fractured mountains and rivers.

Xu Yunfan was the first to break the silence. His purple-gold lightning eyes swept over Dongming.

"Senior Sister, you've reaped quite a harvest this time. The Eternal Night's Fall Dao Fruit is enough to harmonize with the Nine Abyss Evil Mist. With the mutual nourishment of yin and yang, breaking through to the mid-stage of the Golden Core is just around the corner."

He deliberately glossed over his own gains, steering the conversation towards the other's weak point.

"Junior Brother is joking. As for finding a suitable Dao Fruit to form a small celestial cycle, I haven't even taken the first step yet."

Dongming Zhenjun leaned languidly against a shattered temple pillar. Her black Daoist robe was stained with golden blood, but the smile in her eyes didn't reach them.

"Senior Brother Xu, why do you beat around the bush? You stripped the Chiyang Dao Fruit and suppressed the authorities of Light and Nature. With the Divine霄 Thunder supplemented by pure yang fire, you're probably closer to the mid-stage threshold than I am."

Her tone suddenly shifted.

"Speaking of which, Junior Brother, do you know how much time I spent to prove this Nine Abyss Evil Dao Fruit?"

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred, but his expression remained unchanged.

"I am all ears."

To become a Golden Core Zhenjun in the Taihua Lingxu World, who isn't a brilliant genius with great wisdom, great fortune, and great perseverance?

"When I was at the Foundation Establishment realm, I went through five cycles of reincarnation. To seek the pinnacle, each life was a near-death experience."

Dongming Zhenjun's fingertip twirled a wisp of profound evil aura, her voice tinged with nostalgic remembrance.

"Each life, I cultivated to the peak of Foundation Establishment, but was always assassinated by human tribulations when I tried to summon my Dao Fruit.

Until six thousand years ago, when the three great sects were embroiled in a chaotic battle in the North Abyss Sea, the workings of fate were as turbulent as boiling porridge. The Great Compassion Bodhisattva of the Bodhi Pure Land and the Xuanji Zhenjun of the Wansheng Sword Sect fought until their Dao Foundations shattered. I took advantage of their inability to pay attention to anything else, using the Nine Abyss Stealth Technique to sneak into the Underworld Sea's Ruins. Using the accumulated essence of my life's Yin Evil Marrow as a catalyst, I forcibly summoned the Dao Fruit's favor."

She raised her eyes to look at Xu Yunfan, a mocking curve on her red lips.

"If I had been half a breath slower that day, and been detected by the Dongxiao Zhenjun who patrols the界 of the Primordial Origin Sect, I would likely be a handful of yellow earth by now."

The Zhenjun mentioned by Dongming Zhenjun had mostly perished in the great tribulation. Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh inwardly.

The old depart, and the new take their place.
Nothing could be truer.

Xu Yunfan caught the key point.

"The lifespan of a Golden Core initial stage is only five thousand years. Senior Sister has lived for six thousand years, could it be..."

He deliberately paused, prompting her to explain.

"I cultivated a karmic secret art that can deceive my own lifespan limit, greatly extending my life, and it is also protected by an indestructible golden nature."

Dongming Zhenjun said, "The true spirit of a Golden Core is indestructible. Even if the physical body is destroyed, one can still reincarnate in the Taihua Lingxu World and gather past wisdom.

However, this method is extremely dangerous. After reincarnation, one's spiritual root aptitude and family background are all determined by heaven. If one is born into a mortal family or an enemy sect, they might be casually crushed before awakening.

Even if one is lucky enough to return to the path of cultivation and find their past cave heaven, merging with the Dao Fruit still requires a long time. With the slightest carelessness, one might never be able to return, left to cycle through lives forever, with past wisdom but unable to step onto the true path. What can one do?"

Xu Yunfan pondered this.

According to Dongming Zhenjun, the Taihua Lingxu World, having accumulated countless years of history, likely has a considerable number of Golden Core Zhenjun hidden within the mortal world, or forever stuck at Foundation Establishment, with no chance to climb higher.

What a tragic fate that would be.

To have seen the peak but be doomed to only look up at it for countless lifetimes.

A hint of melancholy appeared in her eyes.

"But secret arts for longevity are just that—longevity. How can it compare to the mid-stage of the Golden Core, where one's cave heaven hangs high? To hold one's own cave heaven aloft in the Void, with the true spirit forever residing within it. Even if the body perishes and the Dao is extinguished, one can reincarnate in an instant, then reshape one's Dao body and be reborn on the spot. That is the true meaning of long-lasting life and vision."

Xu Yunfan looked inward at the Divine霄 Golden Core floating in his Dan Tian, where purple-gold lightning light flowed ceaselessly.

What Dongming said confirmed what the Attribute Panel had later deduced: to reach the mid-stage of the Golden Core, one needed to hold a cave heaven aloft.

He took the opportunity to probe, "Since Senior Sister knows the path ahead, why not refine the Eternal Night Dao Fruit now to seek a breakthrough?"

Dongming Zhenjun was about to respond when a gentle and calm voice suddenly pierced their psychic barrier and sounded by Xu Yunfan's ear.

"Junior Brother Xu, this great world has an exceptional status. The Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit you just absorbed is of the same origin as a Dao Seed I lost many years ago. I wonder if you would be willing to part with it and trade one of the Dao Fruits you just obtained to return it to me?"

Xu Yunfan's heart trembled violently, and lightning instinctively erupted around his body.
