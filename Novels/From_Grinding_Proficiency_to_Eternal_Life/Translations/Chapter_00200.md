# Chapter 200: Killing Intent Arises!

When the battle armor fit perfectly, the body frozen in its prime years felt like a young girl's soft, waxy skin after a flower bath when fingers brushed against his waist.

“...”

Xu Yunfan snapped his eyes open, sweeping his gaze across his surroundings before it locked onto the white-clad woman before him, a wry smile forming.

In the valley shrouded by morning mist, a stream gurgled over a pebble beach. The century-old ginkgo tree Xu Yunfan leaned against scattered golden leaves, like flakes of gold cast into the air.

The white-clad woman stood on a rock across the stream, half her body bathed in the orange-red of the rising sun while the other half remained in the gray-blue shadows. Droplets kicked up by the stream hung from her skirt hem like a tiny rainbow.

Xu Yunfan’s gaze slowly lifted. This wicked woman was truly a lotus in autumn water; one could never tire of looking at her. Her wrists, revealed by snow-white sleeves, were finer than the finest mutton-fat jade. Her eyebrows were like ink lines lightly drawn, yet her eyes held a warm amber hue. A smoke-green crepe sash cinched a waist softer and more slender than willow branches in March. Beneath her plain dress, illuminated by the sunlight to a slight transparency, stood two perfectly round, long legs.

“Defeat me, and I will let you go.”

The wicked woman’s opening line remained the same, but in an instant, her lifeless, puppet-like eyes gained a trace of spirit, filled with a hint of surprise.

“Your progress in martial body refinement seems... rather fast.”

“Fast? I find it slow. Others would say I should have reached the Marrow Cleansing Realm by now,” Xu Yunfan casually lied. His body trembled slightly as his muscles swelled rapidly, his veins twisting like gnarled roots. He grew several inches taller in an instant.

“You truly are persistent. I thought I could finally get a good night's sleep tonight.”

The words had barely left his lips when Xu Yunfan stomped his foot, the ground collapsing into a large crater. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swung overhead, trailing a thunderous boom. The hammerhead, forged from thunder-patterned steel, glowed like molten iron, its shadow leaving a scorched, fan-shaped tear in the morning mist.

The stream within a thirty-meter radius was whipped into a frenzy by the gale, splashing noisily. A dragon-like roar rumbled from his throat, and fine bloodlines cracked open on his arm muscles as he swung. The hammer swept upward, snapping three century-old pines at their waists. The broken ends spewed smoke and sawdust like a torrential rain. The ground where the hammer wind passed was churned layer by layer, and pebbles the size of bowls exploded and bounced in the air like popping beans.

A fine steel longsword appeared in the white-clad woman’s hand不知何时. She tapped her sword and retreated, the blade scraping against the hammer face to draw dazzling sparks. Her sleeves fluttered as she moved like a swimming dragon.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, adding another three-tenths of weight to his hammer. This time, she was using footwork to evade, unlike before when she would simply raise her hand to unleash sword qi that could split mountains and steles.

As the woman’s toe touched the ground, the shaft of Xu Yunfan’s hammer shot over like a venomous dragon swinging its tail. The heavy hammer roared, shattering the sound waves and causing rocks to fall from the cliff face. As the woman drifted backward and leaned, the hammerhead grazed the tip of her nose, blasting the ten-person-span ginkgo tree behind her into a waterfall of flying golden leaves and wood chips.

It missed.

Xu Yunfan’s expression remained unchanged. The Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength caused faint blood lines to writhe like earthworms under the skin of his back, finally coiling around his arms and waist like a blood serpent. This made the heavy hammer in his hand刮起 a turbid white gale, and the force bursting from the hammerhead transformed into a surging wave of energy charging at the wicked woman.

The white-clad woman’s expression did not change in the slightest. With a tap of her toe, she slipped past him by a hair's breadth.

When the hammer missed for the seventh time, the veins on Xu Yunfan’s neck bulged violently. He suddenly spun and swung the hammer handle backward. The energy driven by the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength drew a crimson afterimage in the air. This time, the hammer changed direction before its momentum was exhausted, and the Qilin head wrapped in thunder and fire slammed heavily toward the woman’s left shoulder.

The ground within a radius of fifteen meters collapsed three feet with a thunderous crash. Flying stones struck the distant mountain wall, drilling out honeycomb-like holes. The woman’s embroidered shoes danced over the crumbling rock layers as she gracefully retreated. The lotus hairpin in her hair was stimulated by the hammer wind, its layers blooming. As she used her sword tip to borrow force and leap into the air, Xu Yunfan’s hammerhead had already crashed into the spot where she had just stood. The mountain let out a grating cracking sound as a three-zhang-wide fissure tore open along the position where the hammer handle had plunged in. Gurgling mountain spring water suddenly burst from the fissure, shooting up into a ten-zhang-high water column.

It was still a miss!

This was a humiliation!

Fury surged in Xu Yunfan’s heart, and a thunderous roar erupted from his mouth.

“Lin!”

The true word exploded from Xu Yunfan’s throat, echoing nine times in the canyon. The Lin seal formed with one hand moved with the Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength. The boiling rage did not burn through his organs but instead turned into a clear, cold spring. His pupils became as still as a dead pool, not a single ripple. Even the tremor of the mountain wind brushing past his sweat hairs became ripples he could count on his fingertips. Everything within three zhang of him became crystal clear in his heart.

“...”

The next morning, Xu Yunfan woke up in bed and looked down at the Extreme Dao Remnant Skin wrapped tightly around his body. After a long while, he finally let out a slow breath, looking at the information prompt appearing in his vision.

*‘You engaged in a fierce battle with a mysterious woman in your dream. Your Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique was executed with great familiarity. Proficiency in Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique has increased.’*
*‘...’*

Excellent. Just one night had added forty points of proficiency. If this continued, the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique would likely reach the Minor Completion stage within a month.

In the following period, the weather grew colder, and the maple leaves planted within the Skyforge City turned from green to yellow. The deep autumn season inevitably carried a touch of desolation.

On this day, Xu Yunfan habitually inhaled the ginseng spirit from the ginseng baby to practice the Pure Yang One Qi Technique, restoring and strengthening his Pure Yang internal energy. Feeling the internal energy slowly transforming into Red Serpent Coiling Mountain Strength under the effect of Endless Regeneration, he prepared to practice the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique.

In just a day or two, the Thousand-Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Technique would reach Minor Completion. Just as he was about to start training, Xu Yunfan paused. He raised his hand in confusion, examining it closely. It seemed his palm was slightly larger than yesterday.

He immediately realized that the Flesh Refining Realm focused on training the body to be most suitable for the current martial art. Heavy weapons were naturally for martial artists with immense divine strength and terrifying physiques. Now, the nearly four-hundred-jin Thunderfire Qilin Hammer felt slightly light in his hand. He seemed to be undergoing a second growth spurt.

Before he could investigate further, Fu Li crashed through the courtyard gate, his voice filled with panic and helplessness.

“Senior Uncle Xu, the弟子 of the Giant Kite Squad sent a message. Master... he’s about to be surrounded in Cangzhou!”

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flickered. He looked up at the sky where a giant mechanical wooden bird, the Giant Kite, pierced by crossbow bolts, was plummeting from the clouds toward the Skyforge Platform.

The situation in Yanbei Dao had collapsed in an instant.

The fierce winds of Yanbei Dao howled between the thousand-ren cliffs, and Fu Jin’s tattered clothes snapped in the wind, revealing the blood-soaked玄铁软甲 beneath.
