# Chapter 233: An Almost Abnormal Cultivation Method

Xu Yunfan's eyes shone brightly, unable to hide his excitement.

Divine armor of this caliber could greatly enhance one's strength, allowing one to fight across realms without taking damage.

If anyone knew that Xu Yunfan was wearing a piece of divine armor of the eighth rank, the entire martial world of Great Zhou would likely go mad over it.

A true disciple without any supervision!!!

Xu Yunfan's eyes sparkled with brilliance, unable to contain his excitement.

He had already pushed the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art to the Marrow Cleansing realm, which was its limit. If he did not find a new cultivation technique to switch to soon, it would severely delay his progress.

The cultivation methods practiced by the true disciples of these top sects were undoubtedly the sects' most顶尖的 divine arts and supreme techniques.

If he could obtain them...

Wouldn't he have no worries about stepping into the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining?

After all, the only true art in the Tiangong Cave that could achieve the Ninth Realm of Qi Refining was a technique passed down exclusively to the sect master's direct disciples.

Compared to the martial arts of those six top sects, it was truly a bit embarrassing.

"Senior Brother Qi, do you know the general direction of those sect disciples?"

Hearing Xu Yunfan's faint voice, Qi Huan's heart jolted, and he hurriedly replied, "Generally, I generally know the direction. Ever since my body changed, I can always sense the scent I left behind."

Upon hearing this, the deep, solemn expression on Xu Yunfan's face instantly broke into a smile.

He reached out and patted Qi Huan's shoulder, saying seriously, "Senior Brother Qi, we are from the same sect. When we are out in the world, we should naturally be as loyal as liver and gall to each other and keep each other warm. Right now, if we want to get out, we naturally need to find the true disciples of those major sects."

With this thought, Xu Yunfan also gave up on the idea of hammering Qi Huan to death.

Qi Huan's heart also relaxed slightly. Although he didn't know what Xu Yunfan was thinking, the killing intent directed at him from the bottom of his heart had already disappeared.

Since his body had mutated into that of a demon, he was extremely sensitive to the emotions of others. From the moment he woke up, Xu Yunfan had been harboring a vague killing intent towards him.

And as the information he revealed went deeper, the killing intent grew stronger and stronger. If he hadn't agreed so quickly, perhaps Xu Yunfan's large palm would have already come crashing down.

"Senior Brother Qi, take good care of your injuries. Once your injuries are healed, we will set out immediately."

In the following time, under Qi Huan's complex gaze, Xu Yunfan cultivated almost without sleep or rest.

Every morning, he stood atop a mountain peak, facing the rising morning glow, cultivating the Pure Yang One Qi Art.

After eating the demon flesh at noon, he would rest for half a cup of tea's time before tirelessly practicing the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art until late at night. Then, he would sit cross-legged in meditation for nearly two hours before starting to cultivate again just like the previous day.

For seven consecutive days, Qi Huan couldn't help but ask, "You haven't slept or rested for seven days, eating six meals of demon flesh daily, practicing strength training through meditation in the morning, practicing the hammer art at noon, and meditating late at night. Aren't you tired?"

"Tired?"

Xu Yunfan slowly straightened his body, completing the final set of hammer techniques. As he settled his stance, he glanced at the attribute panel in his vision.

*'You have diligently practiced the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art. As the essence and energy within your body are channeled and your blood and Qi are empowered, through continuous practice, you have become increasingly familiar with the force application of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art. Your proficiency in the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art has increased.'*

Seeing a proficiency information prompt floating out from the attribute panel, a hint of a smile couldn't help but appear on Xu Yunfan's face.

Looking at the expression of enjoyment on Xu Yunfan's face, Qi Huan felt a series of twinges in his heart.

Seven days and nights without sleep or rest, cultivating as if possessed by a demon, it made him feel immense admiration in his heart.

"You really have made me look at you with new eyes."

Qi Huan exhaled, and the imbalance in his heart was much more balanced at this moment.

He considered himself diligent in martial arts, but compared to Xu Yunfan's level of training, his own practice was like casting a net for three days and fishing for two.

No wonder he was highly valued by the sect.

"It's not that extreme, I just enjoy cultivating."

"..."

This was completely impossible to respond to. Such cultivation that could be called demonic made him unable to summon any desire to compete.

Seven days and nights without sleep or rest, relying solely on meditation to restore mental and physical energy, it was simply abnormal.

After a good while, Qi Huan couldn't help but ask, "Aren't you leaving yet?"

Xu Yunfan glanced at the remaining elephant demon flesh. These days, he had eaten six meals a day and absorbed the ginseng qi from the ginseng baby three times. He only tore off a few strips of meat for Qi Huan to sustain his life every couple of days, but there was still quite a bit left.

He replied, "It's not time yet. Let's wait patiently."

Qi Huan followed Xu Yunfan's gaze to the elephant demon's flesh and naturally understood that the other party wanted to eat the elephant demon completely before leaving.

"Aren't you in a hurry?"

"Why should I be in a hurry?"

Xu Yunfan countered, "This place is rich in primordial spiritual energy, and there is also the essence of demon flesh to replenish me. It is completely a sacred land for cultivation. If you asked me to go out now, I wouldn't be willing."

Qi Huan opened his mouth and finally fell silent.

Faced with a martial arts fanatic like Xu Yunfan, this place was absolutely the best choice.

Time flowed like water, and in the blink of an eye, a month passed.

When Xu Yunfan sucked the last elephant bone until it turned white, Qi Huan's throat convulsed violently.

Over the past month and more, he had watched with his own eyes as the three-zhang-tall elephant demon corpse was stripped of flesh and bone by Xu Yunfan. The roasted flesh and its essence were devoured into Xu Yunfan's stomach without any restraint.

At this moment, Xu Yunfan's back was slightly arched, the knotted muscles rising and falling with his breath like living things, and even scorching heat seeped from the gaps between his dragon scale armor.

*'You are practicing the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art. Under your arduous training, your proficiency has increased.'*

Looking at the attribute panel, the proficiency of the Thousand-Jun Mountain-Shaking Hammer Art in the skill column had increased by a full 863 points. It had already progressed nearly one-fifth of the way to the 5,000 proficiency required for perfection.

Xu Yunfan suddenly rose, the clashing sound of armor scales startling the cold crows in the forest.

He casually tossed the leg bone towards a deep ravine thirty paces away. The bone bounced off the rock wall seven times before falling into the clouds and mist. Before the echo faded, he had already shot like an arrow released from a bow towards the mountains in the southeast.

Qi Huan's spirit was lifted. Naturally, he had recovered from his injuries during this period. He had intended to leave, but a few days ago, after Xu Yunfan intentionally or unintentionally displayed a strand of his strength, he realized in despair that the other party had already reached the Blood Transformation realm and seemed to be on the verge of achieving minor success in Blood Transformation.

As for martial arts realms, he was only at the Outer Three Unifications.

"Are we going to look for Pei Yan and the others now?"

Looking at the spiritual energy node a hundred miles away that was entwined with demons, Xu Yunfan's eyes shone with a brilliant light.

"It's not time yet."

Xu Yunfan turned back to look at Qi Huan, but he had no intention of restraining the other party.

Now, if Qi Huan wanted to go out, he could only rely on him. If he appeared in front of Pei Yan and the others in his current state, he would likely be treated as a demon and killed.

"Follow me for now."

Hearing Xu Yunfan drop a sentence, he strode towards the mountain ridge without hesitation.

"Wait!"

Qi Huan's green scales stood on end. Limping as he chased out of the cave, he only saw the ring-shaped shockwave that had exploded on the mountain path. It was the aftermath of Xu Yunfan gathering his momentum and taking a step, breaking the sound barrier.

In the distance, a hundred miles away, on the mountain peak shrouded in purple qi, a grayish-green evil aura suddenly rose, and the phantom of a nine-headed巨蟒 loomed faintly amidst the clouds and mist.

Qi Huan's pupils contracted slightly. When he had come here initially, his instincts had made him avoid this place.
