# Chapter 138: The Scholar Who Gambles With Life

Xiao Ji left Windblown City and traveled fifty li north. Ensuring no one was watching, he chose to rest among a desolate pile of boulders while keeping an ear to the city's movements.

He always carried ample supplies whenever he journeyed, and this time was no exception. With the addition of liquor purchased in Windblown City, his provisions were more than sufficient.

Setting up his tent, he arranged a small table and lit the portable stove. As the flames flickered to life, he brewed a pot of tea and reclined on his long chair, allowing himself a rare moment of empty-minded repose.
