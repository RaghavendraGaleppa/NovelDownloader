# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb  
Chapter 122: The Xu Siblings  

Following the young man named Muyan, Lin Xuan flew into the Biyun Mountain.  

After passing through several barriers, they arrived at the sect's main grounds. Along the way, the number of cultivators gradually increased.  

To Lin Xuan's surprise, although most of the disciples they encountered were at the Qi Refining stage, nearly eighty to ninety percent of these low-level disciples actually possessed spirit artifacts.  

Noticing Lin Xuan's astonished expression, Muyan smiled slightly. Though his demeanor remained respectful, a trace of pride flashed in his eyes. "Senior need not be surprised. In our Biyun Mountain, any disciple who reaches the mid-stage of Qi Refinement is granted a spirit artifact by the sect."  

Lin Xuan maintained a calm expression, but inwardly, he couldn't help but marvel. Compared to Yanzhou, the cultivation standards in Youzhou were indeed higher, but gifting spirit artifacts to mid-stage Qi Refining disciples was still an extravagant display of wealth.  

Truly befitting one of the three great sects—such generous benefits explained why rogue cultivators were so desperate to join prestigious sects.  

Aside from Biyun Mountain disciples, they also encountered many cultivators from other sects along the way. Like Lin Xuan, these individuals had come in response to invitations from various factions.  

As leaders of their respective sects, their cultivation levels were impressive. Most were Foundation Establishment cultivators, with a few even reaching the Core Formation stage, followed by entourages of disciples.  

However, there were also many like Lin Xuan who had come alone. Although the current cultivation world was dominated by sects, rogue cultivators weren't necessarily devoid of experts.  

"Senior, we've arrived. Please wait here at the Welcome Immortal Bridge for a moment. Other senior brothers will soon guide our honored guests into the sect."  

Muyan bowed respectfully before retreating. About fifty to sixty zhang ahead stood a magnificent bridge constructed entirely of jade.  

This bridge marked the boundary between Biyun Mountain's inner and outer sectors. Crossing it would lead to the sect's most sacred core area.  

The Welcome Immortal Bridge was vast, and though it already hosted five to six hundred cultivators, it didn't feel crowded at all.  

Lin Xuan flew over on his light beam.  

Upon closer inspection, he noticed the cultivators were clearly divided into two factions. One side, making up about seventy percent of the crowd, wore uniform attire—these were sect or clan cultivators.  

The other side, far fewer in number, had varied and eccentric attire—these were rogue cultivators from all over.  

Though the two groups weren't openly hostile, their mutual disdain was palpable, and they avoided speaking to each other.  

Frowning at the sight, Lin Xuan hesitated briefly before flying toward the sect faction. Though he appeared to be a rogue cultivator, his true identity was the young master of the Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

---  

The atmosphere on the bridge was already tense, and Lin Xuan's arrival naturally drew attention from both sides.  

"Kid, you're in the wrong place. Rogue cultivators should scram over there."  

Hearing the rude remark, Lin Xuan raised an eyebrow and turned toward the speaker—a burly, rough-looking man in his forties.  

Dressed in brown robes, he was followed by seven or eight disciples in identical attire.  

"Thunder Sword Sect," Lin Xuan recalled.  

As the Spirit Medicine Mountain provided alchemy services to other sects, he was familiar with most factions. The Thunder Sword Sect was a minor sect from northern Youzhou, barely ranking as fourth-tier. True to its name, it specialized in sword techniques.  

This burly man was the sect's leader, yet his cultivation was only at the early Foundation Establishment stage.  

*Such a weak sect, yet so arrogant.* Lin Xuan wasn't one to stir trouble, but that didn't mean he would tolerate disrespect—especially now that he knew the hidden strength of the Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

His philosophy was simple: *If others don’t provoke me, I won’t provoke them. But if they do, I’ll make them regret it for life.*  

Glancing at the man, Lin Xuan didn't immediately retaliate, instead considering the best way to teach him a lesson. Suddenly, the sound of celestial music reached his ears.  

"The Welcoming Melody!"  

All attention shifted as a group of cultivators, led respectfully by Biyun Mountain disciples riding immortal cranes, approached from the distance. The entourage numbered in the dozens.  

"It's the Heavenly Mountain Sect!"  

"Indeed, though their sect leader isn't among them."  

"That's Xu Feng, the rising star of the new generation in Heavenly Mountain."  

Among Youzhou's many sects, aside from the three giants, there were several top-tier factions. Though none had Nascent Soul monsters, they boasted Core Formation experts aplenty.  

Heavenly Mountain was one such elite sect.  

In the cultivation world, strength dictated status. For Biyun Mountain to dominate Youzhou, alliances were essential, and Heavenly Mountain—slightly inferior in power—was a key target for their diplomacy.  

Thus, unlike the reception for ordinary cultivators, the ceremony here was exceptionally grand.  

Aside from the three giants, Heavenly Mountain's strength allowed them to traverse Youzhou unimpeded. Though other cultivators might envy them, none dared show dissatisfaction. The Thunder Sword Sect leader, in particular, wore an obsequious expression.  

*A classic bully—timid before the strong yet tyrannical toward the weak.*  

But his attempts to curry favor fell short—he wasn't even worthy of their notice.  

The Heavenly Mountain group arrived swiftly at the bridge.  

"Esteemed friends, please wait a moment. Our senior brothers will soon arrive to welcome you."  

"No need for formalities," Xu Feng waved magnanimously. "I'd like to acquaint myself with the fellow cultivators here. Please attend to your duties, senior brothers."  

The other cultivators studied the Heavenly Mountain group, especially Xu Feng. Rumor had it that at just thirty-five, he had already reached the peak of Foundation Establishment.  

While hard work played a role, his innate talent was undeniably remarkable.  

Xu Feng's spiritual sense swept across the bridge, and his face lit up with recognition. In a flash, he appeared beside Lin Xuan.  

"Brother Lin! You're here too! Where's Master Tongyu? Introduce me at once."  

"Master didn't come. I'm representing our sect."  

"Oh? Has the venerable master secluded himself to research some new elixir?"  

Lin Xuan smiled without answering. He had become acquainted with Xu Feng months earlier when the latter had gathered ingredients for a pill refinement at Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

By coincidence, Master Tongyu and the other renowned alchemists were all in seclusion, reportedly studying a new medicinal herb.  

With no time to wait, Xu Feng had been at a loss until Lin Xuan stepped in and successfully refined the pill for him.  

"Little sister, come quickly! Didn't you always say you wanted to meet your savior? This is Brother Lin. If not for his skill in refining the Revitalizing Pill, you'd be separated from me by life and death."  

Xu Feng's tone was affectionate as a girl of seventeen or eighteen emerged from behind him. With a doll-like face, she was delicate and charming, her cultivation at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement.  

"This is my younger sister."  

The girl approached Lin Xuan and stole a glance at him. "This humble one is Xu Yin. Greetings, Senior Brother Lin. Thank you for saving my life."  

"A trivial matter. No need for formalities, Miss."  

---  

Lin Xuan chatted amiably with the Xu siblings.  

"Brother Lin, I heard your alchemy skills have surpassed Master Tongyu's, and you've been named the next sect leader of Spirit Medicine Mountain. Is that true?"  

Lin Xuan quickly shook his head. "Not at all. My meager skills are nowhere near Master's level."  

"Brother Lin is too modest. At the very least, your alchemy talent surpasses Master Tongyu's. And your appointment as the next sect leader is undeniable."  

"Exactly!" Xu Yin's eyes sparkled with admiration. "Elder Brother told me you reached Foundation Establishment at just twenty. Your cultivation speed rivals his!"  

---  

As the three conversed cheerfully, the surrounding cultivators wore varied expressions—especially the Thunder Sword Sect leader, whose face had turned ashen.  

A habitual bully, he had unwittingly kicked an iron plate.  

Who would have thought this unassuming youth wasn't a rogue cultivator but the heir of Spirit Medicine Mountain?  

While Spirit Medicine Mountain's strength was only slightly superior to his own sect, their status in Youzhou's cultivation world was incomparable.  

Thanks to their peerless alchemy, Spirit Medicine Mountain cultivators were deeply respected—even the three giants treated them as honored guests.  

The oversight likely stemmed from Muyan's inexperience. Had the reception been proper, Lin Xuan would have been greeted with the same grandeur as Heavenly Mountain.  

Sweating profusely, the Thunder Sword Sect leader—Lei Ao—approached Lin Xuan and bowed deeply.  

"My apologies for my earlier rudeness. I hope you can overlook my offense..."  

"Oh? Did this man offend you, Brother Lin?" Xu Feng turned, his gaze sharpening.  

Lei Ao paled further. Having overheard their conversation, he knew Lin Xuan and the Xu siblings were close. If Lin Xuan spoke ill of him, Xu Feng wouldn't hesitate to act. With Heavenly Mountain's might, annihilating Thunder Sword Sect would be effortless.  

*Words can be deadly.* The fate of his sect now rested on Lin Xuan's whim.
