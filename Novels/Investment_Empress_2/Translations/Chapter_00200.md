# Chapter 200: Her Moonlight Shines Upon Him (1/2)

Moonlight flowed through the door, illuminating the room with a soft, radiant glow.

Their eyes met.

Both were taken aback.

Li Mo looked at the Ice Cube. Her dark hair was braided and draped over her shoulder, her sleeves rolled up, as if she had just finished some household chores. Amidst her usual coolness was a touch of恰到好處的 (perfectly appropriate) domestic charm.

It seemed... she wasn't so piercing to the eyes anymore?

New skin for the Ice Cube—The Domestic Empress?

Hmm... the room had even been cleaned. The entire house was spotless, and the walnuts on the table were practically gleaming...

It was just... suddenly bald.

Looking at the stunned Little Li.

Ying Bing spoke softly:

"I was idle, so I tidied up the place."

Li Mo pondered for a moment, then suddenly put on a serious face and said loudly:

"The Royal Nectar!"

Ying Bing: "?"

What kind of nonsense?

Li Mo fell silent for a moment, then试探着 (tentatively) asked:

"Prosperity, Democracy?"

Ying Bing: "....."

Li Mo felt increasingly strange.

She didn't even know that, so it seemed she wasn't like him, having解开 the seal of the womb and awakened memories of a past life.

Then...

"It's almost midnight."

Ying Bing walked to the bed and patted the mattress.

Li Mo walked to the bed, step by step, deep in thought.

It was a single bed, quite small.

They had shared a bed before, and even soaked in a hot spring together, but now that Li Mo sat on the bed, he felt something was off everywhere.

"Are you ready?"

It was rare to see Li Mo looking uncomfortable. A hint of amusement flashed in Ying Bing's eyes as she raised her chin slightly.

It seemed the benefits of the Clarity of the Sword Heart weren't entirely reflected in martial arts... but also in the strength of the mind.

She wouldn't be like last time, during the punishment for the loser, when they soaked in the hot spring together.

She definitely wouldn't.

Just as she thought this, her vision suddenly went dark.

"This bed is a bit small."

Li Mo shook his head.

He sat down, directly blocking the moonlight outside.

The second layer of the Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh naturally required both parties to be in the Divine Observation state to achieve the best effect.

"Then let's sit on the floor," Ying Bing said softly.

"Sitting on the floor..."

Li Mo's gaze swept over the floor, then he suddenly thought of something.

He let his consciousness sink into the System Space.

When he was categorizing the rewards earlier, it seemed he had received quite a few miscellaneous items.

For example, an adjustable massage chair.

*Slap—*

Two massage chairs appeared in the room.

He lay directly on one, finding it surprisingly comfortable, and his mood improved.

Seeing this, Ying Bing walked over and, without any hesitation, lay down on the other chair just like Li Mo.

A soft sensation came from her back.

She looked up at the sky, where a clear moon hung high.

The sense of quiet tranquility grew even stronger. Observing the Divine at this moment was simply too suitable.

"Hand."

"Okay."

A cool, smooth sensation came from his palm.

Completely different from the daytime, Li Mo now felt much more from Ying Bing's Soul Intent, and sensed her power on a deeper level.

"Mmm..."

Ying Bing kept her eyes straight ahead, looking at the moon.

At the same time, within her Soul Intent, the moonlight Li Mo was observing became increasingly clear.

"I am currently observing the Divine through two apertures, while you are still at one."

"I will release a small portion of my Soul Intent first."

"Okay."

This was actually similar to the first layer of the Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh.

After all, it was the same martial art.

Li Mo also became serious.

He was now standing with one foot at the threshold of the second aperture.

The next moment.

He felt a touch of coolness in his mind.

He originally couldn't observe the Great Yin outside, but now, because of the Ice Cube, the moonlight outside also illuminated his Soul Intent.

He felt no discomfort, but found it somewhat strange.

---

The trace of moonlight brought by Ying Bing seemed to be fundamentally different from the one he was observing.

"Indeed..."

Ying Bing had discovered this during the day.

But in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, there are three Great Suns, yet the Great Yin has always been only one.

The more they practiced dual cultivation, the more she discovered that the Great Yin Li Mo observed had many different details.

But it was unfamiliar, yet it gave her a strange sense of familiarity.

Half an hour later.

As the two Soul Intents flowed back and forth.

Li Mo gently let out a breath:

"We can still strengthen the Soul Intent further."

Ying Bing's eyelashes trembled slightly: "That's all I have."

Now, Li Mo's second aperture still hadn't opened.

Yet, even though he had one less aperture than her, the intensity of his Soul Intent was on par with hers.

And...

Why was his second aperture so solid?

It gave her the feeling as if she were breaking through the fifth or even sixth aperture of Divine Observation.

She possessed two Divine Forms, though neither was a complete Great Dao Divine Form.

"What should we do..."

Li Mo was troubled.

"Empty your mind, just focus on operating 'Phoenix Singing in the Heavenly Marsh'," Ying Bing suddenly said.

"Huh?"

Li Mo was puzzled for a moment, but immediately did as Ying Bing said.

The next moment.

The connection between their Soul Intents became even closer.

He seemed to be able to empathize with the Ice Cube's current mood.

She was very serious.

Mmmmm.

Li Mo felt like he was playing a duo lane, he was the ADC, and suddenly his phone was snatched away. The god-tier support thought he was trash and started playing two accounts alone...

It wasn't just seriousness.

He also seemed to feel the tranquility in the Ice Cube's heart, that powerful and unshakable mind...

This was brought about by the deeper spiritual communication.

The next second.

Two distinct yet harmonious moons appeared in Ying Bing's clear, deep eyes.

She controlled the power of their two Soul Intents, using them to help Li Mo冲击 the acupoint for the second aperture of Divine Observation!

That acupoint was originally flawless like jade, impenetrable.

But the Ice Cube's operation truly opened Li Mo's eyes!

She simultaneously controlled their two Soul Intents to凝聚, alternating ceaselessly to strike the exact same point on the barrier.

That point was incredibly small.

But the Ice Cube's control was even more meticulous!

If there is no flaw, create a flaw?

Li Mo recalled the tenet of the *Solitary Nine Swords*.

Time passed.

After a thousand grinding strikes and ten thousand blows.

A thousand-mile堤 (dyke) is destroyed by an ant's hole. Finally, the barrier blocking the acupoint showed its first tiny crack.

After that, things became simple.

*Crack—*

不知过了多久 (How much time passed, who knows).

Suddenly, a sound that seemed inaudible to the ear echoed in Li Mo's consciousness.

The second aperture was achieved naturally!

He instantly felt as if he had entered a new world!

He also felt.

The trace of exhaustion in her, who had just been controlling his Soul Intent.

There was no time for joy. Li Mo opened his eyes.

"Ice Cube?"

"It's nothing..."

Ying Bing's face was slightly pale, and a faint shimmer of sweat appeared at her temples. She shook her head with a light smile.

She was a bit tired, but a faint sense of joy welled up in her heart as well.

Her moonlight could also shine upon him...

"Thank you."

"It was nothing."

"Our Soul Intents are still connected, I can tell... How about I help you relax?"

"Huh?"

"For example, a massage. I just happen to know a supreme massage technique, and this chair is also..."

"?"

...

PS: The little failure author is here to apologize. My rent is up. I wanted to write this morning, but the landlord came to collect the apartment, and the moving company came at noon. Sorry for the delay.

The updates won't be short. I'm going to grab a bite to eat first.
