# Chapter 18: The Use of Ironvine

Early the next morning, Chu Ning got up, had breakfast, and first made his rounds through the spirit rice fields. After using the Cleansing Technique to remove a few weeds, he headed to the premium spirit field where the Dark Bamboo was planted.

**[Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique (Yellow Grade Low Tier), Second Layer (17/900)]**

Before beginning his cultivation, Chu Ning first checked his progress with the second layer of the Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique. As he had expected, despite his diligent cultivation over the past period, the need to meditate and recover his spiritual energy after using the Growth Acceleration Technique meant he couldn't achieve one proficiency point per day. After twenty-one days, his second layer proficiency had only reached 17.

Without hesitation, Chu Ning selected a cluster of Dark Bamboo shoots, channeled his spiritual energy, formed hand seals, and cast the Wood Spring Technique. After repeating this several times, he sat down to wait for the technique to take effect on the bamboo. Based on his experience over the past three months, the best time to cultivate the Evergreen Wood Longevity Technique was half an hour later.

Half an hour passed, and Chu Ning immediately sat cross-legged to begin his cultivation. The significantly faster rate of absorbing spiritual energy compared to before filled him with satisfaction. He continuously circulated the technique, drawing in the spiritual energy emanating from the bamboo shoots. After an hour and a half, he concluded his session.

His first action was naturally to check the results of his cultivation.

His proficiency had increased by one point. Indeed, cultivating with the aid of the Wood Spring Technique yielded better results. Normally, it would take a full day to gain one proficiency point, but now he could achieve the same in a single session.

"If I combine this with my morning and evening cultivation, I can gain two to three points per day. That's two to three times faster than before. At this rate, I should be able to complete the second layer and reach the mid-stage of Qi Refinement in about a year to a year and a half," Chu Ning calculated silently, feeling much more at ease.

Glancing at the Dark Bamboo before him, Chu Ning cast the Wood Spring Technique again. These bamboo shoots were an important source of income for him in the coming months, so he had to take good care of them. Applying the technique daily was essential. Since the effects of the previous Wood Spring Technique had already been absorbed, it was time to replenish them.

After casting the technique and sensing the vibrant vitality of the Dark Bamboo, Chu Ning left the field satisfied.

After lunch, instead of returning to the spirit fields, Chu Ning headed to the mountain behind his courtyard. Over the past twenty days, he had been too busy planting Scarlet Spirit Rice and Dark Bamboo to practice the Thorn Technique and Vine Armor Technique. Now, he could finally give them a try.

The Thorn Technique could theoretically be cast using any plant, but vines were the most suitable. Chu Ning had already identified a plant called Ironvine growing on the mountain behind his courtyard. Though it lacked thorns, its natural toughness made it ideal for practicing the Thorn Technique.

Although he hadn't had time to practice the technique earlier, Chu Ning had already memorized the incantations and methods. Finding a patch of Ironvine in the mountains, he observed the slender, iron-gray vines with their small but lush leaves. Some mature vines even bore purple flowers.

Standing beside the Ironvine, Chu Ning quickly formed hand seals and pointed at a nearby tree. A vine shot up and lashed toward the tree—only to fall limply to the ground moments later.

Shaking his head at his failure to control his spiritual energy properly, Chu Ning took a deep breath to steady himself and tried again. This time, the vine flew straight to the tree and coiled tightly around its trunk, which was as thick as a bowl. Chu Ning formed another seal, and thorns sprouted from the vine, digging deep into the bark as the vine constricted further.

Once the vine had secured its target, Chu Ning no longer needed to channel spiritual energy to maintain it. Walking up to the tree, he marveled at how deeply the vine had embedded itself into the wood.

"If this were wrapped around an ordinary person..." he mused, understanding why mortals held such reverence for cultivators. Even a basic mid-tier offensive spell like this could be deadly.

With another hand seal, the thorns vanished, and the vine loosened and retracted, leaving behind deep grooves in the tree's bark. Chu Ning then moved on to practice with another vine.

After spending some time on the Thorn Technique, he switched to the Vine Armor Technique.

Unlike the Thorn Technique, the Vine Armor Technique didn't require an external plant. Instead, it used the caster's own spiritual energy to form a protective barrier resembling vine armor around their body. This meant the caster had to continuously expend energy to maintain it.

As another mid-tier Wood-element spell, Chu Ning's innate Wood Spirit Physique allowed him to master it after a few attempts. However, the drain from practicing the Thorn Technique left him with little energy to sustain the Vine Armor Technique for long.

Having learned both offensive and defensive spells, Chu Ning now needed to practice them diligently to reduce casting time and increase their potency. As dusk approached, he prepared to leave but paused, looking back at the Ironvine.

"Why not plant some of this around my courtyard?" he thought.

Ironvine was technically a spirit plant with medicinal properties used in some elixirs. However, its hardiness and ubiquity made it largely overlooked. For Chu Ning, though, it had several advantages: its flowers could beautify his courtyard walls, it would allow him to practice the Thorn Technique at home in emergencies, and—most importantly—he might be able to use the Wood Spring Technique on it to aid his cultivation at night.

The sect discouraged disciples from staying in the wild spirit fields at night, as patrols didn't cover those areas, leaving them vulnerable to beasts or rogue cultivators. Chu Ning had previously considered using the Wood Spring Technique to enhance his nighttime cultivation, but most spirit plants had strict soil requirements, making them difficult to cultivate. Ironvine, however, was an exception.

With this in mind, Chu Ning found the previously ordinary Ironvine much more appealing. Instead of digging up existing vines, which were of poor quality, he searched the mountain for a mature vine with dark purple flowers and collected its seeds to plant around his courtyard walls.

Planting was second nature to Chu Ning. After using the Growth Acceleration Technique on the seeds, he planted the Ironvine along the inner walls of his courtyard and applied the Wood Spring Technique to each vine. Testing his cultivation, he confirmed that the technique still provided a boost, though the effect was weaker compared to the Dark Bamboo.

After experimenting over the next day, he found that two cultivation sessions with the Ironvine could yield one proficiency point—still an improvement over his previous rate. Combined with his daytime cultivation in the Dark Bamboo field, he could reliably gain two proficiency points per day while reserving half a day for spell practice.

Over the following month, Chu Ning divided his time between tending the Dark Bamboo and spirit rice, practicing the Thorn Technique, Vine Armor Technique, and other spells like Cleansing Technique, Blade Technique, Nectar Technique, and Telekinesis Technique—none of which he could yet cast instantaneously. He also visited the Technique Hall once to learn the Fireball Technique and Aura Detection Technique, both basic spells.

Even after being assigned individual spirit fields, disciples like Chu Ning could still visit the Technique Hall monthly for new techniques and insights, though the frequency was reduced from biweekly to once a month.

Time flew by, and before he knew it, another month had passed, marking half a year since Chu Ning had joined the Green Stream Sect. One morning, as he was about to leave for the fields, a voice called out from outside his courtyard:

"Chu Ning!"
