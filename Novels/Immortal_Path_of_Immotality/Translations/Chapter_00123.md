# Chapter 123: The Man Who Never Backs Down

Lin Shan returned to Xiayi Island and spent considerable time mastering summoning techniques. Apart from binding a group of miscellaneous "seafood," he also bound all the Qi Refinement stage cultivators under his command. 

But there was one thing he hadn't forgotten—Bear Mountain Master! 

This bastard had dared to scheme against him, instigating the Black and Red Twin Fiends to seize his territory. Unforgivable! 

Did he really think a Water Escape Talisman would let him run wild in the East Sea? The arrogance!

Lin Shan took out the broken half of the spiked club he'd picked up on Red Shrimp Island. Since it was just a broken piece, the enhancement panel only provided a simple appraisal without the option to enhance it. 

Not that Lin Shan intended to enhance it anyway. This artifact had been refined by Bear Mountain Master for years—it was more than sufficient as a medium for his curse technique. 

After over two years, his sect's signature divine ability, "Nailhead Seven Arrows Book," would finally see use again. 

Back in his cave abode, Lin Shan sealed off all external light sources. In the pitch-black chamber, he lit two candles and placed the straw effigy and spiked club before him. Before beginning the curse, he set the mood. 

Then, he retrieved the bow and arrows he had crafted in his early years from his storage pouch. Activating the divine ability seed in his soul, he drew the bowstring and aimed at the straw effigy. 

Instantly, the effigy connected to the void, transporting Lin Shan's consciousness to an unfamiliar stretch of sea. There, a burly man with a thick beard was flying on a sword. 

It seemed Bear Mountain Master had mostly recovered from his injuries over the past few days. Right now, he was traveling at full speed—who knew where he was headed? 

But Lin Shan couldn't care less. He loosed the first arrow, striking the effigy dead center. 

"Ah!" 

Bear Mountain Master screamed mid-flight before plummeting from his sword and vanishing into the vast sea. 

Lin Shan's consciousness returned to his body. This wouldn't do—if his target sank into the ocean, how would he know his condition? 

Without hesitation, he nocked a second arrow, drew the bowstring taut, and activated the divine ability again. His consciousness was once more pulled into the void. 

This time, the scene shifted underwater. Bear Mountain Master was now enveloped in black mist, with eerie red hairs sprouting wildly across his body like bamboo shoots after rain. He clawed frantically at the red hairs while screaming in terror. 

"What the hell is this?! Get off me!" 

But the more he clawed, the more the red hairs multiplied. His body was soon covered in bloody scratches, and the scent of blood quickly attracted a swarm of sea beasts. In the distance, countless schools of fish were already converging toward him. 

Lin Shan's "viewing time" was up. He had no choice but to loose the second arrow before his consciousness snapped back to reality. 

"This is too short! I need a membership!" 

Grumbling, Lin Shan drew a third arrow, determined to use up all three daily attempts in one go. 

His consciousness traversed the void once more, arriving at a deep-sea location. 

Bear Mountain Master had now transformed into a red-haired monster. Purple tentacles had sprouted from his armpits, ears, back, soles, and even... other places. 

This was Lin Shan's first time seeing such bizarre purple tentacles. Each seemed to possess its own consciousness, writhing independently rather than moving in sync with Bear Mountain Master's body. 

Drawn by the blood, swarms of sea beasts—fish, jellyfish, electric eels, sharks—descended upon him in a frenzy. 

The red-haired Bear Mountain Master panicked, stuffing antidotes and healing pills into his mouth while rummaging through his storage pouch for artifacts to fight his way out. But when he reached inside, his mind suddenly cleared with a chilling realization— 

Where the hell was his high-grade flying sword?! 

He'd been flying on it just moments ago before inexplicably falling into the sea. Had he lost it just like that? 

That sword had been hard-earned! After currying favor with a Golden Core protector from Lu State, he'd risked life and limb in the East Sea's Turtle Fishing Island campaign, fighting for two full years before barely managing to join the Black Lotus Sect as a Clean Altar Envoy. 

The high-grade flying sword had been issued to him on his very first day, and he'd treasured it dearly. 

During his battle with Lin Shan on Red Shark Island, he'd rather let his spiked club take damage than lose that sword. 

And now it was just... gone? 

Frantic, Bear Mountain Master abandoned thoughts of escape and instead summoned his high-grade paired artifacts—the Mother-Child Plum Blossom Nails—along with a set of poisoned needles and even the broken half of his spiked club. Howling like a madman, he fought his way back to the surface. 

The deep sea became a bloodbath as countless sea beasts fell to his frenzied slaughter. Truly a mid-stage Foundation Establishment cultivator—he'd never fought this desperately against Lin Shan. 

Meanwhile, the purple tentacles on his body writhed incessantly, secretly absorbing blood in the water. As they drank more, black patterns began to glow across their surfaces, forming mysterious inscriptions. 

But the scene ended there. Lin Shan had to loose the third arrow, snapping back to reality. 

In the dark cave, the two candles still flickered, their flames burning brighter than before. The light cast shadows across Lin Shan's frustrated face as he stared at the straw effigy pierced by three arrows, scratching his head in restless agitation. 

"Did Bear Mountain Master make it out? And what were those purple tentacles?" 

---

Meanwhile, in the neighboring "Water Bear Sea," Bear Mountain Master was preoccupied with thoughts of his beloved "silver flying sword." 

By now, several more purple tentacles had sprouted from his body—emerging from his navel, nostrils, chest, and even... his rear. 

He could tolerate the others, but having a tentacle suddenly burst out from such a humiliating place was too much! 

In a mix of shock and fury, Bear Mountain Master grabbed one of the tentacles and smashed it with his spiked club. 

"Ah!" 

"Ah!" 

Two screams echoed simultaneously—one his own, as the pain felt like he'd struck his own limb, bringing tears to his eyes. The other... came from the tentacle itself? 

Could tentacles growing from his own body scream? 

A chill ran down Bear Mountain Master's spine, but he gritted his teeth and continued smashing the tentacle relentlessly. 

Eerie, bone-chilling shrieks erupted from the tentacle with each blow. 

After over a dozen strikes, the tentacle finally snapped, spewing foul purple-black blood that instantly poisoned the surrounding seawater. 

Sea beasts drawn by the scent of blood died in droves. 

As the tentacle bled profusely, Bear Mountain Master felt as though his own blood was draining away. Panicking, he desperately tried to shove the severed tentacle back into his body. 

Thankfully, his monstrous strength prevailed—the half-broken tentacle reluctantly retracted, though he now felt dizzy. Worse, the purple-black blood in the water seemed to be poisoning him! 

What kind of nonsense was this? His own blood was toxic to himself? 

No time to dwell on that. He swam back to the surface and took flight on a mid-grade artifact. 

Gazing at his reflection in the water—a red-haired monster covered in writhing tentacles—Bear Mountain Master let out a heartrending roar. 

"What the hell is happening to me?!" 

The vast, empty sea offered no answers. Left alone to lick his wounds, he spent a long moment in silent anguish before gritting his teeth and tearing out the red hairs one by one. 

This time, the hairs didn't regrow, leaving his body covered in bloody gashes. 

Truly the ruthless spirit of a pirate lord—Bear Mountain Master's tenacity was unmatched. 

Next, he took out a blade artifact and hacked off all the tentacles, yanking out their roots and tossing them into the sea. 

But when it came to the tentacle at his rear, no matter how hard he slashed with the blade or even the spiked club, it refused to break—its toughness defied all logic. 

Even a high-grade artifact couldn't sever it. 

Left with no choice, Bear Mountain Master stuffed the "tail" into his pants. The tentacle slapped his buttocks in protest, much to his humiliation. 

Exhausted and wounded, the pitiful man flew back to the earlier location, searching for an entire hour—but his beloved high-grade flying sword was nowhere to be found. Probably snatched away by some passing sea beast. 

After enduring supernatural horrors, plucking hairs, severing tentacles, and losing his treasured sword, the once-indomitable Bear Mountain Master silently shed tears. 

The man who never backed down had never known such sorrow.
