# Chapter 172: What Divine Art Is He Studying? Bai Jinghong's Greeting

The carriage traveled far toward Yuncheng City.

Li Mo sat inside the compartment, flipping through the booklet in his hand.

To be honest, he felt that this investment feedback was simply outrageous and seemed utterly useless.

But he still had to read it.

Mostly out of curiosity.

Could a massage technique really become a peerless masterpiece?

"The first move, 'Roaming Through Mountains and Waters.' What mountains? What waters?"

Li Mo leaned back in his seat, greatly shocked.

This really was a peerless masterpiece!

If he learned it and went to work as a technician at the Spring Breeze Tower, he would definitely be top-notch.

Jiang Chulong looked on with curiosity.

What was Big Brother Li reading?

Unfortunately, just as she tried to lean over, Big Brother Li wouldn't let her see...

By the tea table, Ying Bing placed the Frost Sword across her knees, a cup of tea in front of her, her gaze lowered.

At the Cloud Province Martial Arts Summit, there were no shortage of martial artists who would later make their names known throughout the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Just the Dragon Ranking prodigies alone numbered four or five, along with many powerful figures who had been lying low for a long time.

Many prodigies viewed the Hengyun Sword City as the first battle in their debut of testing their swords against the world.

A match between experts is also a clash of spirit and will.

She naturally wasn't worried about whether she could become one of the top three.

But the Divine Sky Heart Sword emphasizes advancing without fear.

Its momentum grows stronger the more it is accumulated.

It starts from this very moment.

"The eighth move... Hiss..."

Little Li's惊叹 (exclamation) with a sharp intake of breath was heard.

Ying Bing frowned slightly.

Is he... studying a new martial art again?

"The twelfth move, damn... so strong, truly a genius."

Li Mo exclaimed in admiration.

That goes without saying.

If he weren't a genius, could he have developed a massage technique into a peerless masterpiece?

Ying Bing couldn't help but open her eyes and look at the booklet in his hand. On it was clearly written:

'Thread of Flowers Finger.'

With her knowledge, it wasn't hard to see a trace of extremely subtle Zen meaning from this name.

Could it be... a profound Buddhist martial art?

Otherwise, why would he show such an expression of astonishment...

Ying Bing's heart tightened.

It was strange.

She used to never know what nervousness was.

But watching the young man sometimes exclaim in admiration, sometimes shake his head and sigh, her mind became slightly disturbed.

"Who came up with this thing? It's too strong."

"It surpasses even Divine Arts."

Li Mo finished reading the Thread of Flowers Finger and sighed.

To be honest.

He originally had no interest in this thing.

But now that he saw it, he really couldn't help but learn a thing or two.

"What are you reading?"

Ying Bing couldn't help but ask.

When he was studying the peerless masterpiece 'Sun Wheel Sword Canon,' she hadn't seen him so astonished.

Even surpassing Divine Arts?

In the System's judgment, he was already stronger than her. If he were to learn this 'Thread of Flowers Finger' on top of that...

"Oh, this?"

Li Mo shook the booklet in his hand.

"A peerless masterpiece."

"Specifically for researching massage techniques."

Little Li felt a bit embarrassed.

He wasn't sure if this massage technique was proper or not.

After all, for the sake of the massage effect, there were no restrictions on places that should or shouldn't be touched...

No wonder it says not to use it on the opposite sex easily, or you might get arrested.

"Peerless masterpiece..."

Ying Bing's heart just relaxed slightly, but then she felt something was wrong.

"Mas... sage?"

She thought of the content of the next punishment:

【Request the winner to touch...】

Originally, she didn't have much imagination about this aspect.

But not long ago, when the two were sparring sword moves...

Just thinking of that sensation of electric current surging through her, her heart was filled with mixed feelings. The initial anger had dissipated, leaving only an indescribable feeling lingering.

"Learning this kind of martial art... is a waste of time."

"Don't worry, I'm just reading it for fun."

Li Mo smiled.

Was she worried that learning martial arts would distract him, making him jack of all trades but master of none?

Ice Cube is actually a pretty good person.

Wait.

Little Li noticed that between Ice Cube's beautiful brows, there was a hint of worry.

What's wrong with her?

【Name: Ying Bing】
【Age: 16】
【Constitution: Taiyin Moon Phoenix Body.】
【Realm: One Aperture of Divine Observation.】

---

【Destiny: Red (Bearing the Emperor Bone, with玄冰 (mysterious ice) as fate and autumn water as spirit, possessing the appearance of a Phoenix Sovereign.)】
【Evaluation: Fate is full of calamities, but she always turns misfortune into blessing. Currently, her feathers are not yet full. When the wind and clouds change, she will surely hang high in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, ruling the Six Directions and Eight Wastelands.】
【Recent Occurrence: Hopes to enter the top three of the Martial Arts Summit to observe the Hengyun Sword Mark and become the true number one of her generation.】

"Huh?"

Li Mo instantly became alert.

Ice Cube is... nervous.

And there are peers who make her feel inferior?

There are other experts?

Instantly, Little Li became much more cautious about his trip to Cloud Province.

...

Not long after.

Looking up, a magnificent and prosperous city came into view. Its grandeur was countless times greater than the rebuilt Ziyang Prefecture City, as if it had stood for countless years.

And the current Yuncheng City was even more lively than before.

"Wow..."

Jiang Chulong stretched out her little head, looking around like a curious child.

She had never left the palace when she was in the Imperial City.

After arriving at Ziyang Prefecture City, she rarely went out.

When had she ever seen such a scene?

She was both curious and timid, carefully holding onto Li Mo's sleeve.

"The city is big, so there must be plenty of delicious food," Li Mo smiled. "I'll take you to eat something good later."

"Okay," Jiang Chulong carefully curled the corners of her mouth. "Big Brother Li is so good to me..."

Li Mo: "....."

This silly girl is lucky she met him first. If she met a bad person, she would probably be tricked and still help count the money for them.

He wondered how she lived in the palace, being so trusting of others.

Due to the recent influx of many martial artists, the number of guards at the city gate had increased, and they enforced strict discipline.

Everyone had to be inspected upon entering the city.

After the inspection, they could pass by paying one tael of silver as an entry fee.

"One tael per person, hiss..."

Senior Brother Ouyang was shocked.

How much silver is that? That's enough for him to work himself to death for several years just to earn it!

"The culture of valuing martial arts in Cloud Province is much stronger than in the Eastern Wasteland Domain," Xu Zhiqing said, feeling both excited and a bit nervous.

In Ziyang Prefecture, she was considered a dashing and heroic figure with quite a reputation, but here, she was as insignificant as a drop of water in the ocean.

"There are indeed many swordsmen here," Li Mo nodded, tightening his grip on the Red Dawn Sword.

Hmm!

Who dares say he is not a swordsman?

He activated the Eyes of Destiny.

Whenever he arrived at a new place, he would check to see if there was anyone worth investing in.

"Wow, the new Dragon Ranking is out!"

"Zhong Zhenyue! He's also on the Dragon Ranking. I heard he followed his father, the Marquis of the South, to the border to resist the disaster beasts. Will he come to Yuncheng this time?"

"He's ranked eighty-ninth? I remember the original eighty-ninth was Young Master Bai Jinghong of Hengyun Sword City."

"Young Master Bai is eighty-first now!"

The Dragon Ranking!

It was the most authoritative prodigy ranking in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, published by the Celestial Derivation Sect, based on combat records.

The Martial Arts Summit is inherently a stage for young martial artists to shine.

Therefore, while other rankings exist, the crowd around the Dragon Ranking is the largest.

"I probably have no chance of making the list in my life," Senior Brother Shen Yunfei sighed. His age makes it hard to call him a young talent anymore.

As he spoke, he looked not far away.

He wasn't the only one; the other disciples of the Clear Abyss Sect also looked over.

"Junior Sister Ying Bing, Junior Brother Li..."

"After the Martial Arts Summit, when they shine, how astonishing will they be?"

"In the future, the stage of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, they will be the true protagonists..."

They were just sighing with emotion when...

"It's Young Master Bai!"

"Young Master Cao and Young Master Wu too!"

"The Three Heroes of Hengyun are here to see the rankings!"

Suddenly, someone exclaimed, recognizing the young master riding a white horse with a cold expression and an aura of an expert.

And it wasn't just him.

Along with Bai Jinghong were two other prodigies also on the Dragon Ranking, and their rankings were even higher than his.

People made way for them, after all, they were not only prodigies but also true disciples of Hengyun Sword City.

However.

Just as everyone was admiring their heroic swordsmen demeanor and unparalleled elegance, Bai Jinghong's gaze suddenly froze.

Thump—

Young Master Bai, as if seeing some terrifying monster, his pupils contracted.

Then, as if by reflex, his knees went weak, and he slapped down onto his knees.

Everyone: "????"

Li Mo: "....."

He was holding a star poker chip in his hand, about to put it away into the System space.

This is awkward.

Going to someone else's territory, and having them kneel down to you in front of everyone... what do you do?

Waiting for an answer online, it's urgent.

...

PS: My results suddenly dropped a lot yesterday, probably because this little author wrote a side plot. I was stunned for a long time today, so the update is late... There's still one more chapter, I'll probably have to pull an all-nighter to write it, so you can read it tomorrow.

Sorry, dear readers, mwah.
