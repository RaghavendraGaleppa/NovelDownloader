# Chapter 34: Truth and Lies

Upon entering the crevice, Qin Ming’s fatigue vanished. The feeling he had outside was not an illusion; the place where he had nearly died but was reborn was now completely different.

He looked up, the exit only about four meters above him. Around him, silver light spread like spider silk, connecting and extending underground. When his body touched it, there was a slight warmth.

Qin Ming held a short sword in one hand and a long-handled black-gold hammer in the other, walking forward. Last time, after accidentally falling in, he hadn't ventured deep. Now, he wanted to explore.

The ground was very uneven, with various sizes of stones scattered about. It was damp, and the stone walls on both sides were covered in water droplets, dripping occasionally. The path ahead was rugged and gradually narrowed until it was only wide enough for one person to pass.

Although underground, it wasn't dark, as the crisscrossing silver threads wove randomly, casting a faint glow. Qin Ming was not harmed by touching the silver light. He brushed against the stone walls, picking up a little dampness, and then entered a more open area where the scattered stones on the ground became fewer, and the surface was much smoother.

In this area, the silver threads grew thicker, densely filling the entire space, as if many giant spiders had spun their webs here, intertwining with each other. Moreover, some threads piercing through the stone walls carried faint golden specks, and white mist steamed in the air.

Standing there, Qin Ming felt even clearer: his body felt light, tense muscles relaxed on their own, and a warm sensation enveloped him, like soaking in a hot spring. He frowned. Was this due to the drastic changes in a special node in the mountain? Or had he adapted to this place after the torment he experienced last time?

Qin Ming vividly remembered the terrifying experience from before: his heart had thumped violently, the sound like a fierce drum, his chest almost bursting, and his blood flow was terrifyingly fast, making him faintly hear the sound of a waterfall. He pondered the various changes since leaving here. The most unusual was his "unorthodox method" of cultivation, which had shown no "movement" for years. After enduring near-death, when he practiced again, it actually produced a special reaction.

Now he knew that the unorthodox method was not unorthodox; it was recorded on a silk scroll. He had diligently practiced it since childhood. "Someone told me the silk scroll couldn't be cultivated, that it had been torn and burned..." The remaining twenty or so pages of the silk scroll could indeed be cultivated, but it required guidance from someone who had practiced it, and those people should have long since died.

"I couldn't find such a person, no one helped me, yet I ultimately succeeded. Is it related to this place?" Qin Ming mused, making various connections. "Could it be that to cultivate the techniques on the silk scroll, one initially needed the protection of a predecessor to enter these extremely dangerous, special nodes..." Qin Ming pondered deeply.

He then walked forward, observing this special place, and began to cautiously touch the thick threads with a faint golden luster. Not long after, as he ventured deeper, he also saw glowing threads with purple qi steaming from them, piercing through the stone walls, a magnificent sight that did not harm the body.

In the dense forest outside the great mountain, a purple-eyed crow was flying when suddenly a large patch of black mist billowed forth, blocking its path. "Who's there?" It immediately grew vigilant, its purple eyes swirling with mysterious symbols, gradually discerning the scene within the dense mist.

A massive owl, easily over a meter tall, stood on a large tree, its two wings agile like human hands, flipping through a beast-hide book.

"Long time no see. Care for a few drinks?" the owl spoke, the dense mist not dissipating. It tucked the book under one wing.

"I'm on patrol. No time," the crow refused, somewhat wary of the owl.

"What's your status now? This isn't your territory. You've really fallen, guarding a decrepit old man?" The owl blocked its way, seemingly displeased with its actions, intent on lecturing it there. The black mist grew thicker, enveloping the forest.

The purple-eyed crow said, "Old Cat, I have business to attend to. Recently, I've taken a liking to a promising young talent and need to go check on him. Don't block my way."

If Qi Huai'en knew this, he would surely break into a cold sweat. Like Yu Liangyun, he had not yet been truly recognized and was still undergoing testing and observation.

The owl said, "You're really not returning to the Black Mist World in the wild? You're from a renowned family, a great clan among birds, with high-level spirit blood. You're a bird with deep roots. How can you degrade yourself? Do you intend to re-contemplate your true form, become a two-legged beast, and live permanently in a city?"

The purple-eyed crow nodded, saying, "Hmm, it's not impossible. I have the talent to change my true form. Aren't there also some who wander near the forbidden lands in the deep mountains and great marshes, transforming into unusual beings? Why can't we do the opposite and find a path suitable for ourselves?"

The owl reprimanded, "What impropriety! Humans will no longer be human, beasts no longer beasts. You're clearly a crow from a prominent family, yet you want to become a human! I'm telling you, Old Crow, I'll pluck all your feathers and manually turn you into a bald two-legged beast!"

The two began to argue.

"Mind your own business and don't block my way! You might delay my important matters. What if they test that kid prematurely and something goes wrong? If that kid is trainable, I'll need him in the future to retrieve something for me in the human world of myriad temptations, something crucial to my future path. You know what I'm talking about, so get out of my way!" the crow insisted. Yu Liangyun had told it that they would likely test Qin Ming in about two days, but might act sooner if the opportunity was right.

"Master Crow, have you returned from the depths of the mountain? Something big has happened! It's terrible, everyone's dead!" A mutated sparrow flapped its wings, screeching.

The purple-eyed crow broke free of the black mist and appeared outside, asking, "What happened?"

"Master Crow, I diligently carried out your instructions, but during the process, a three-meter-tall bear led a large group of two-legged beasts chasing me. I was startled and fled for only a moment, but when I returned, a group of people there were all corpses. I smelled their blood, but I don't know how they died."

The purple-eyed crow followed it to the vicinity of the incident, carefully sensing. It was exceptionally sensitive to the aura of life and death. After closing its eyes for a moment, it opened them again, muttering, "Qi Huai'en is dead. There's no death qi from that young man here. Interesting. Was Qi Huai'en killed by outsiders, or did he die from a confrontation with that young man?"

It waved its wings, signaling the sparrow to leave. "If that young man is truly that capable, reaching this point on his own, then it's fine even if he doesn't go to Flowing Light City. I don't need to get involved now." The purple-eyed crow flew away.

Yu Liangyun was reporting to the woman in the snow: "Qi Huai'en tested Qin Ming and said he was ultimately just a bit short. The mountain is very chaotic; before I left, there was a fierce conflict in that dense forest..."

The purple-eyed crow flew back, landing on a small tree, and said, "Qi Huai'en rushed to save someone, but died himself. A bit of a pity."

"Stay here," the woman in the black fur cloak told Yu Liangyun.

"Ah?" Yu Liangyun was stunned, then immediately performed a deep bow, his expression incredibly agitated.

In the depths of the mountain, the soaring five-colored mist gradually dimmed. Ling Xu and Wei Mo both rose, discarding their wine cups and jars. Ling Xu lightly stomped his foot with his long blade, partially tearing his beast-hide boots, exposing his toes. Then he lightly patted his chest, and his white robe ripped. His slender body did not look very strong, but under the illumination of the distant mist, his undulating muscles were smooth and seemed outlined in gold by the light. He deliberately messed himself up, and with a flick of his finger, bloodstains appeared on his skin—a masterful act of deception.

Wei Mo spoke, "Lord Ling, who is always so clean, bright, and particular about his appearance, can actually make himself look like this. People outside would likely be quite amused." Despite his words, he was also acting, removing some red armor plates from his gauntlet and tucking them into his embrace, making himself look equally disheveled.

In another part of the mountain, a calico cat captured a huge black mountain cat, disdainfully smeared some of the black cat's blood on itself, and then sprinkled some glowing spiritual substance. Not far away, a praying mantis beast was doing the same.

Undoubtedly, the high-level figures of Scarlet Mist City and the extraordinary creatures in the great mountain were unwilling for other powerful individuals to contend with them for the rare resources within the special node, so the two sides joined forces again.

If they simply and brutally ambushed those experts, it would certainly not work, as it would incite public outrage, and major organizations would seek revenge. Earlier, when they had joined forces to drive away the migrating high-level beings who sought to usurp their territory, they had slain an extremely powerful extraordinary creature, extracting its rich spiritual essence to ignite a special node, artificially creating the five-colored mist area, attracting all parties to compete.

Ling Xu, the calico cat, and other high-level extraordinary creatures in the mountain, however, were engaged in mutual "fake battles," holding each other back and staying outside the true battlefield. Of course, they couldn't all fake it; for instance, Old Weasel was genuinely intercepted by an opponent, and the mysterious mountain master even rushed into the center of the battlefield to participate.

The effect was quite good; some experts had already died near the five-colored mist area, and some foreign high-level creatures and powerful individuals from major organizations were seriously injured.

In the depths of the crevice, Qin Ming began to practice the techniques from the silk scroll. He felt increasingly clear and comfortable throughout his body, as if a mysterious warm current was cleansing him from head to toe. This place had various glowing threads intertwined, which were very harmful even to people like Wang Nian, who had undergone a second rebirth and urgently needed the blood of spiritual creatures for self-replenishment. Now, Qin Ming had been here for a long time, not only unharmed but even feeling a subtle improvement in his physical constitution.

"Could it be that the techniques recorded on the silk scroll are more suitable for cultivation in a place like this?" he wondered. However, no one could answer him now. The people of those times were either dead, crippled, or had disappeared. The silk scroll itself had yellowed, an artifact from who knew how many years ago.

Suddenly, the ground underground vibrated violently, almost causing Qin Ming to fall.

Outside, in the central area where the five-colored mist was gradually dimming, high-level extraordinary creatures and experts from mysterious organizations stood in confrontation, all in terrible condition. No one had managed to enter that node. At this moment, all the light within the node suddenly dispersed, and in the distance, a brand new five-colored mist erupted violently, even more astonishing than the earlier anomaly in this place.

"Why is there another one?"

"No, the rare resources born here have shifted along the spiritual ley lines and moved to a different location!"

Ling Xu, Old Weasel, and the others, who still had "follow-up plans," were now stunned along with everyone else. They didn't even need to conceal anything; the true five-colored mist realm had appeared!

Rumble!

Suddenly, the entire mountain range shook violently, more astonishing than before, accompanied by dazzling light. The dark night sky was torn apart, completely illuminated, and an even grander abnormal phenomenon appeared.

"What am I seeing? Ten colors! Those beams of light are like giant pillars, propping up the night sky. This is an unheard-of wonder! What kind of rare treasure is about to appear?" Even the high-level beings were dumbfounded; this far exceeded their imagination. In an instant, no matter how severe their injuries, all the powerful individuals vanished from their original spots. They didn't even glance at the truly revealed five-colored mist realm, rushing directly towards the place with the even grander abnormal phenomenon, where endless light rain steamed and fell, attracting everyone's gaze.
