**Chapter 3: Qi Condensation**

When Zhao Di was five years old, he and the other children began receiving guidance from an elder of the Jian family, embarking on their respective paths of immortal cultivation.

The one responsible for teaching these children introductory cultivation methods was a bald, white-bearded old man from the Jian family named Jian Shi. Although quite old, his cultivation wasn't very high, and his status within the family was quite ordinary.

Zhao Di still remembered the first time he saw Old Man Jian Shi demonstrate immortal magic that day. It excited him so much that he often dreamed of similar scenes for the next half month.

Old Man Jian merely mumbled a few incantations, then held up his right palm flat. With his left index and middle fingers joined, he lightly pointed towards his right hand. Suddenly, a fireball about six or seven centimeters in diameter, the size of a fist, appeared a few centimeters above his right palm, eliciting gasps of surprise from the children.

The old man's incantations continued without pause, and his left hand constantly changed gestures, pointing repeatedly at the fireball above his right hand. The fireball grew larger and larger, finally reaching about the size of a human head. Zhao Di, who was closer to the old man, could already feel a scorching heat emanating from the fireball, clearly indicating its extremely high temperature. At this moment, the old man uttered a "Go!" and the fireball swiftly flew diagonally away, smashing into the rocky ground ten meters away. After a loud explosion, the hard rocky ground was actually blasted into a large pit over a foot deep and three feet wide.

"A single fireball from this old man actually has such terrifying power!" Zhao Di felt utterly shocked. He felt that nothing from his past life experiences could explain what was happening before his eyes, and this further deepened his interest in immortal cultivation.

After the old man finished demonstrating, he looked at the children's astonished expressions, nodded with satisfaction, and then began teaching the basics of immortal cultivation. As expected, the children, captivated by the old man's performance, listened with extreme seriousness.

Zhao Di even forced himself to remember every word the old man said without missing a single one.

It turned out that the path of immortal cultivation, according to different cultivation realms, could be divided into nine major stages. From lowest to highest, they were: Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, Soul Transformation, Void Refinement, Body Integration, Mahayana, and Tribulation Transcendence. Among them, the Qi Condensation stage could be divided into thirteen levels, while stages after Foundation Establishment only had three levels: early, middle, and late. As for the Tribulation Transcendence stage, it was rumored to have only one level: to undergo the Immortal Tribulation. Successfully passing the Immortal Tribulation would lead to becoming an immortal, living as long as heaven and earth.

The purpose of cultivators' continuous practice was to improve their cultivation realm. The higher the realm, not only would their magic power and divine abilities greatly increase, but their lifespan would also multiply. Generally speaking, cultivators in the Qi Condensation stage had lifespans not much different from mortals, usually living to about a hundred years if they died naturally. Foundation Establishment cultivators could live to over two hundred years. As for Core Formation and Nascent Soul cultivators, their lifespans also increased exponentially. It was rumored that many Nascent Soul cultivators could live for over a thousand years, and there were a very few such individuals in the Blazing Gold Nation.

As for this old man, he was at the early Foundation Establishment stage and had already lived for over one hundred and eighty years!

"Live for over a thousand years, even as long as heaven and earth!" Upon hearing this, Zhao Di was practically going crazy; he couldn't wait to begin his path of immortal cultivation.

Old Man Jian Shi didn't make them wait too long. After simply introducing some cultivation precautions and basic methods, he took out five different cultivation manuals for the children to choose from.

These five books looked very ancient, their covers neither silk nor paper, clearly extraordinary items. On their covers were written "Sharp Metal Art," "Evergreen Art," "Wave Chasing Art," "Blazing Flame Art," and "Earthstone Art," corresponding to the five spiritual root attributes of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, respectively. All of them were introductory cultivation techniques for Five Elements spells. As long as one possessed the corresponding spiritual root, they could cultivate. For example, a cultivator with wood, fire, and earth spiritual roots could cultivate any one of "Evergreen Art," "Blazing Flame Art," or "Earthstone Art." Theoretically, cultivators with multiple spiritual roots could also cultivate multiple techniques simultaneously, but in practice, no cultivator did so. One must remember that "it is better to be a master of one than a jack of all trades." Cultivation realm is determined by the highest cultivation level of a certain technique. For example, cultivating "Evergreen Art" to the thirteenth level means being at the thirteenth level of the Qi Condensation stage; one more step would make them a Foundation Establishment cultivator. However, even if a three-spiritual root cultivator spent a lot of time and effort cultivating all three wood, fire, and earth attribute techniques to the twelfth level, their cultivation would still only be at the twelfth level of Qi Condensation. Neither the amount of their spiritual power nor the power of the spells they cast would be comparable to a Qi Condensation thirteenth-level cultivator.

Of course, techniques of different attributes also had their unique characteristics. Generally speaking, fire attribute techniques had the strongest offensive power, while water attribute techniques were slightly easier to cultivate. Wood attribute techniques focused more on self-regulation; cultivators practicing this technique often had slightly longer lifespans than cultivators of the same level. Metal and earth attribute techniques also had their respective characteristics.

Since each child already knew their spiritual root attribute, they were allowed to choose freely.

Zhao Di had Five Spiritual Roots, possessing all five types, so he could cultivate any of these five techniques. After hearing Jian Shi introduce the characteristics of each attribute technique, he unhesitatingly chose "Wave Chasing Art," which was the fastest to cultivate. After all, his spiritual root attribute was originally poor, so choosing an easier one might not make his cultivation too slow. As for the water attribute technique having the weakest power, he didn't pay much mind to it.

The other children, however, were different. Almost everyone with a fire spiritual root chose "Blazing Flame Art," perhaps drawn in by Jian Shi's demonstration.

After everyone had chosen their cultivation techniques, several mortals from the Jian family brought out pre-prepared paper and pens for each child. Once all the children had their paper and pens, Old Man Jian Shi made a series of peculiar hand gestures and then pointed into the air at each of the five cultivation books. Instantly, the five books emitted spiritual lights of various colors, forming five glowing orbs about two feet in diameter, enveloping the books. Immediately, glowing characters quickly flew out from the orbs, hovering above them. These incomparably brilliant five-colored light orbs attracted even more attention from some children than the previous fireball spell.

"These are the incantations for the first five levels of the five techniques. Hurry and copy them down, the light orbs will disappear in one hour." Old Man Jian's voice was not loud, but it struck the children, mesmerized by the five-colored orbs, like a sudden blow. They trembled, then quickly picked up their pens and began to record.

Zhao Di copied quickly, not bothering to think about the meaning, knowing he would have plenty of time later. After copying the first five levels of "Wave Chasing Art," he felt he still had time, so he casually recorded the first five levels of "Evergreen Art," which had the shortest text.

In less than an hour, all the children had finished copying. Old Man Jian collected the five books, dropped a phrase, "Cultivate diligently, and come find me at the Ruzi Pavilion when you've mastered the first level," and then left.

Hearing the old man say this, Zhao Di thought the first level would be easy to cultivate. Who knew it wasn't like that at all!

He carefully read the first-level incantation and memorized it thoroughly. Then, he began to follow the method described, slowly guiding the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into his body with each breath, controlling this spiritual energy to circulate within his body along the prescribed routes, finally entering his dantian and converging into his own spiritual power, completing a Lesser Heavenly Cycle. He managed this quite easily, but the amount of spiritual energy gathered each time was exceedingly small, even far less than the children who started much later. Although he tirelessly absorbed spiritual energy every day, sleeping only four or five hours, and became increasingly proficient, with the time taken to complete a circulation shortening, it still took him nearly a full year to finally gather enough spiritual energy in his dantian and successfully control it to break through several important acupoints in his body, reaching the completion of the first level and entering the second level of Qi Condensation.

It was worth noting that some five- or six-year-old children completed the first level of cultivation in just two or three months, and most of the others did so in about half a year.

Despite his diligent and hard cultivation, he couldn't even compare to these five- or six-year-old children. Zhao Di felt a bit speechless about his inferior spiritual roots.
