# Chapter 155: Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect

Such a massive object naturally drew the attention of the martial arts sects in the two regions.

Since they were entering another's territory, Sect Master Hong Baichuan personally went to pay a visit to the leader of the Lingnan Dao martial arts world, bringing a treasure weapon as a gift.

Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect.

At the third watch, the mist over the Qingyue Mountains had yet to disperse. Hong Baichuan had already ordered his men to carry a gilded, heavy iron box up the stone steps.

The nine-thousand-step "Path-Seeking Heavenly Ladder" gleamed with the cold sheen of moss in the morning light, yet he refused to let his disciples take over. Instead, he personally carried the box on his shoulder, holding the copper lock.

This was the rule of the northern weapon-forging sects, and also their way of survival. When visiting another sect to pay respects, the Sect Master must carry the weapon personally, to demonstrate that "the Way is carried by martial might, and the weapon is as heavy as a mountain."

Back in Yanbei Dao, when the Tiangong Cave faced the incense-worshipping cult's invasion alone in Cangzhou, the Nine Luminaries Sect showed no sign of support, not even sending a single person. They turned a blind eye, and the various halls of the Tiangong Cave were naturally displeased.

Although the Tiangong Cave was famous throughout Yanbei for its forging techniques, it was ultimately not a top-tier sect with a Grandmaster of the Ninth Realm presiding over it.

When the incense-worshipping cult conspired with the imperial hounds within Cangzhou's territory, the Tiangong Cave nearly faced destruction, with nearly half of its members dead or injured.

The flying kite disciples sent to the Nine Luminaries Sect went straight to the mountain gate. For three days and three nights, they didn't even receive a single reply.

The tributes the Tiangong Cave sent to the Nine Luminaries Sect each year were never lacking, yet when the sect's survival was at stake, they merely watched from the sidelines.

Years ago, when he personally presented the Eight-Treasure Gilded Armor to the Sect Master of the Nine Luminaries Sect, the promise of being "of the same breath and branch" had long since turned to ash along with the corpses beneath the Tiangong City.

That was an improper deed.

The Nine Luminaries Sect probably never expected that the Tiangong Cave would leave so decisively, moving its entire foundation in one go.

Xu Yunfan, with the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer and the Mysterious Steel Hidden Mechanism Box on his back, looked up at the massive mountain.

He hadn't gone to the Ghost Weeping Abyss, but was instead pulled out by Hong Baichuan to bolster their presence. After all, among the younger generation, Xu Yunfan was the most outstanding talent.

Although the Tiangong Cave was here to pay respects at the mountain gate, they also had to show off their own foundation.

Otherwise, how could others look upon them with high regard?

Even so, Xu Yunfan, having been pulled out by Hong Baichuan, felt a sense of apprehension. He had read many novels in his previous life.

If a genius suddenly emerged from a sect, and the local top-tier sect saw that a genius from another sect had surpassed their own, they naturally wouldn't stand for it and would try to stifle the genius in the cradle.

Then, if a powerful expert came to eliminate him early, he would truly have nowhere to cry.

"What do you think of this place?"

Hong Baichuan turned his head to look at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan was secretly calculating the possible difficulties they might encounter when he heard Hong Baichuan's question. He immediately replied without thinking, "It gathers the spiritual essence of heaven and earth, and contains the elegance of mountains and rivers. It harbors outstanding talent, and displays a distinguished and extraordinary style."

"Good words, good words!"

Before the words had faded, a long laugh suddenly came from below the mountain steps.

Hong Baichuan was not surprised at all. With his Bone Marrow Cleansing Master realm, he had already sensed someone coming up from below the steps.

Xu Yunfan looked towards the sound and saw a figure in a sky-blue sharkskin robe emerge from the mist.

The person had a jade-bone folding fan slanted over his shoulder. The cracks on the fan's ribs were like spreading ice crystals, and the star chart painted on the fan with scorched ink swayed with his steps, as if a river of stars was flowing.

As he drew closer, Xu Yunfan could see his face, and he couldn't help but inwardly praise him as a fine young master.

He truly had a magnificent bone structure.

His eyebrows were like black pines covered in snow, his eyes like a cold pool quenching stars. A half-melted rime on his hair tip, stirred by the mountain wind, rustled and fell onto his shoulders.

Though dressed like a scholar, his nine-foot-tall, imposing figure stood like an iron tower. The black waist belt tightly bound him, and the outline of his muscles was faintly visible, like a coiling dragon.

Xu Yunfan's pupils contracted slightly.

Such a physique clearly showed that he had trained the External Three Unions to the level of flesh, muscle, and bone, at least reaching the圆满 (perfection) stage of two of them, and had already entered the Great Martial Master realm of the External Three Unions!

Lingnan Dao consisted of nineteen states in total, and the Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect was ranked first. Even the power of the Great Zhou government was less effective here than the Xuanzhen Sect.

It was a pity that when the incense-worshipping cult ran rampant, they only protected their core three states, turning a blind eye to the other states.

"This one is Su Zhenhe, greetings to Sect Master Hong."

The folding fan "swished" open, startling the cold sparrows on the branches three zhang away.

His voice was clear and resonant like a sword's hum, yet his demeanor was as gentle as jade, making it hard to tell whether he was a martial artist or a refined young master.

He left a deep impression.

Hong Baichuan stroked his beard and laughed heartily. "Twenty years ago, Master Guanshan said the Xuanzhen Sect had produced a Qilin son. Seeing you today, your presence is indeed extraordinary."

"My master is already waiting at the mountain gate."

Su Zhenhe cupped his hands in salute. The fact that Master Guanshan would personally wait at the mountain gate to receive them was enough to show the weight of the Tiangong Cave.

After all, in the current martial world, having a high-quality weapon greatly enhanced one's own combat strength.

Let alone a weapon-forging sect that could forge treasure weapons.

These words made Hong Baichuan's smile grow even wider.

Su Zhenhe's gaze seemed to fall on Xu Yunfan unintentionally. "This brother's demeanor is calm and resolute. Could he be Sect Master Hong's esteemed disciple?"

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists in return, stated his name, and then smiled. "That's not quite right. I am merely a true disciple of the Tiangong Cave's Forging Hall for now."

Hearing this, Su Zhenhe did not look down on Xu Yunfan and remained polite.

"Brother Xu's words are mistaken. To be brought here by Senior Hong, you must have exceptional abilities. There is no need to be overly modest."

Hearing this, Sect Master Hong felt even more pleased in body and mind. No wonder the Xuanzhen Sect sent only Su Zhenhe down to greet them. The young man's mind was clever and quick-witted, and his words filled one with positive emotions to the brim.

Xu Yunfan didn't feel much. In his previous life's workplace, he had seen plenty of such people. Upon meeting, they would praise you to the skies regardless of whether you looked human or ghost.

It had him believing he was a handsome guy after being called "handsome" so many times.

Unfortunately, his confidence was shattered by being called a "dumbass" in the end.

This person seemed courteous on the surface, but there was a faint sound of clashing weapons in his breathing. As for what he was really thinking, Xu Yunfan had a pretty good guess.

The Qingyue Xuanzhen Sect, also known as the Qingyue Xuanzhen Monastery, was the leader of Lingnan Dao and one of the six top sects, possessing its own pride.

If it weren't for the special nature of the Tiangong Cave, if it were any other sect paying respects at the mountain gate, they wouldn't receive such treatment.

The three of them walked up the steps, the frost patterns on the bluestone slabs shattering under their feet.

Su Zhenhe talked and laughed with ease, his sleeves flipping and turning in a way that subtly conformed to the Seven Star Step pattern, stepping precisely on the nodes of Xu Yunfan's qi flow with each move.

Probing me?

Xu Yunfan remained expressionless. He glanced silently at Hong Baichuan, who, as if oblivious, still carried the gilded iron box on his shoulder while chatting and laughing with Su Zhenhe, calling him "junior" and "senior" with great familiarity.

He shifted his heel half a step, the stone chips crushed by his sole leaving a straight trail behind him. With each step he took, though there was a trail, his foot landed without a sound. Silently, he cut off the empty space in Su Zhenhe's qi interception technique.

Although the light body technique "Flying Leg" had a vulgar name, the methods of light body movement within it, from his current perspective, could still be called exquisite.

Su Zhenhe's expression faltered for a moment, then immediately returned to normal.

It was Hong Baichuan who, as if he had said something funny, let a rumbling thunder of a laugh roll from his throat.

This old fellow...
