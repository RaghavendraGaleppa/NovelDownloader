# Chapter 469: The Correct Use of the Cloud Chest Avatar Technique

Escape?

The Divine Martial Realm was now under the complete control of the True Lord. Although the local Heavenly Dao was struggling, this was a minor realm to begin with—how much resistance could its Heavenly Dao possibly muster? There was nowhere to run.

Struggle?

It would be like an egg smashing against a rock.

Wait for death?

That would be sitting still and waiting for death, completely betraying all the hardships and opportunities that came with stepping onto this path.

Xu Yunfan's eyes sparkled as he looked up at the heavens.

Then, was the Purple Micro Heavenly Gang of the Northern Dipper that the "True Lord" had prepared for him truly existent within the Divine Martial Realm?

This was currently the only thing he could obtain that would allow him, at the Foundation Establishment realm, to touch a trace of true "origin" power!

It was the key to breaking through all cognitive limits of the same realm!

The foundation enhancement it brought could not be compared to the Northern Dipper Breaker Army Gang, White Tiger Metal Evil, or Black Turtle Water Evil!

Only by refining this Qi would he have the slightest chance of breaking free.

Should he choose the other罡煞 (Gang Sha) that seemed safe but was actually equally dangerous with a low ceiling, or face this most brilliant and dangerous temptation? Choosing the former might allow him to survive a bit longer, but like a frog in warm water, his fate of being harvested would be hard to change. Choosing the latter was like picking chestnuts from a fire—one wrong step and he would be incinerated, but... there might be a slim chance to escape!

Anyone with a will to resist would naturally choose the second option without hesitation.

"Heh..."

A strange smile slowly curled at the corners of Xu Yunfan's mouth.

That smile was cold and calm, without a hint of hesitation, instead carrying an absolute clarity after seeing through all the cruelty.

So what if it's a conspiracy?

So what if it's a trap?

He couldn't escape this garden, but he could choose to become the strongest one in it!

Strong enough that when the moment comes in the future, he would have the power to turn this fruit into thunder that burns everything to ashes the instant the True Lord's finger touches it!

Xu Yunfan slowly raised his head, all fluctuations in his eyes having disappeared, leaving only a light that intertwined deep calmness and madness, like a cold night sky.

The starlight trajectory that was said to be embedded in the nine heavens of this realm was clearly imprinted in his Sea of Consciousness.

Target: Purple Micro Heavenly Gang of the Northern Dipper!

The last trace of emotional fluctuation in Xu Yunfan's eyes also vanished, leaving only deep coldness.

In his Sea of Consciousness, as the True Warrior Subduing Devil Scripture operated, the starlight trajectory in the nine heavens of the Divine Martial Realm was crystal clear—Purple Micro Heavenly Gang of the Northern Dipper!

A flash of understanding passed through Xu Yunfan's heart.

"This damn..."

It was actually quite good to him. He didn't expect it to actually bring such a rare external Heavenly Gang and Earth Evil Qi.

This was not only his only path to survival, but also the strongest fuel to sever his shackles.

Since you think the overall situation is in your grasp, let me see if you'll find it troublesome to hold this sword of mine when the time comes.

With his mind made up, there was no more hesitation.

Naturally, Xu Yunfan wouldn't immediately activate the ritual. Before that, there were some things he needed to arrange.

His mind sank deep into his Sea of Consciousness, where the secret technique chapter of the "Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Chest" shone brilliantly. The profound text of the "Cloud Chest Avatar Technique" flowed through his heart.

The Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes at minor completion was already quite rare.

This technique was no small matter—it wasn't merely about condensing a Qi body or illusion, but about refining a "True Spirit Avatar" with an independent meridian system that carried the root of one's soul, almost equivalent to creating another "self."

However, to accomplish this technique, the expenditure was immense.

After all, it was about using the path of artifact refining to achieve an avatar, so naturally, external objects were needed for assistance.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate to flip his hand and pass over several storage bags at his waist. These were all the precious spiritual materials he had accumulated during his time in the Primordial Origin Sect, especially what he had squeezed out while guarding the Cold Crow Pass.

With a sweep of his spiritual sense, the various spiritual materials in these four storage bags were like mountains piled up. The so-called spirit stones formed from worldly spiritual energy weren't even worth mentioning, swept into a corner as stepping stones.

He took out twenty-eight small flags, set up a concealment formation, then slapped a storage bag.

In an instant, multicolored light erupted, and spiritual energy surged like tides, enveloping his form.

只见他掌指连弹，以神识牵引法诀。一滴滴蕴含浓郁生机的“万载沉阴铁”髓液被剥离出来，这是铸就化身的“骨”。

一块块流淌星辉的“天辰秘银”在法力催动的八景灵焰中熔化为液态灵光，化身为“脉”。

数瓶足以让筑基修士眼红疯狂的“凝魂玉髓”被小心祭出，这将是分化真灵、赋予生命的核心媒介，构成化身的“魂基”。

更有“通明宝莲心”散开万道清光，洗涤杂质，为化身打下澄澈根基。

寒鸦关阴煞地脉深处获取、沾染了无尽修士怨恨却依旧蕴含大地元力的“九幽黄泉土”亦被炼入其中，增添一丝不灭韧性……

Xu Yunfan's hand seals moved like dragons and snakes, extremely complex and profound.

Every change in the hand seal was accompanied by the intense consumption of large amounts of spiritual material essence. Spiritual light continuously merged into the hazy human-shaped light shadow that was taking form.

Time seemed to solidify amidst the steaming spiritual mist and interweaving treasure light.

As the refinement deepened, sweat appeared on his forehead, and his Sea of Consciousness transmitted waves of sharp pain. At a crucial juncture, Xu Yunfan's brow suddenly opened his Martial Dao Heavenly Eye, as if glaring in fury, shooting out light that could rival the Dipper and Ox constellations, forcibly splitting out a wisp of origin true spirit and soul power, as if cutting himself with a blade.

The mountain-like precious spiritual materials quickly dimmed and shattered, finally turning into dust and dissipating in the庚金 (Metal)罡 wind.

The foundations accumulated from battles at Cold Crow Pass, and from guarding and trading during that time, were exhausted at this moment, not a trace remaining.

After forty-nine days and nights, finally, when the last wisp of light converged, a figure almost identical to Xu Yunfan himself stood quietly before him.

Facial features, body shape, and even the unique domineering true energy aura of the "True Warrior Subduing Devil Scripture" flowing around him were no different.

The only difference was that when this avatar's eyes first opened, they seemed slightly empty, lacking a sense of vicissitudes, and instead carried the purity of a newly born spiritual creature.

This was the true Cloud Chest Avatar!

Neither illusion nor shadow, but a second "self" that existed independently!

Xu Yunfan looked at the avatar before him, his mind exhausted yet incredibly excited.

One of the ultimate uses of the "Cloud Chest Avatar Technique" recorded in the "Mysterious Capital Eight Scenes Forging Heaven Creation Cloud Chest" was "one thought, two bodies, divine soul exchange."

As long as the main body's consciousness still existed, the main consciousness could instantly transfer without obstruction between the main body and the avatar through secret techniques.

In other words, once this secret technique was cultivated to perfection, Xu Yunfan could achieve: the main body is me, and the avatar is also me!

The power, insights, and realm carried by the main body— the avatar also possesses the foundation.

And the avatar's experiences and gains can also nourish the main body.

As long as the divine soul takes residence, it naturally becomes the main body.

This was an extremely profound path of self-differentiation and integration.

Originally, this technique was meant to allow the cultivator to split out a true body to assist in artifact refining, thereby increasing the success rate of artifact refining.

But with the assistance of the attribute panel, at the minor completion level, Xu Yunfan, who understood the method of the Cloud Chest Avatar Technique, could only斥之 as a waste of heaven's gifts.
