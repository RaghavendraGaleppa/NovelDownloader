# Chapter 186: Transaction

"Huang Qi? That's quite a name." Zhou Tian couldn't help but complain when he heard their appellations. While the appellation of the Abyssal Tomb Dao Lord was normal, the name of the Frontier Prison Dao Lord was too peculiar. He was a Dao Lord, yet his name sounded like an old yellow dog from the village entrance.

"That's not his name; it's his designation," Saint Devil said, hearing Zhou Tian's complaint.

"Designation?"

"That's right. The Frontier Prison is divided into the Heaven, Earth, Black, and Yellow Prisons. They aren't categorized by strength. According to vague intelligence from the Star Realm, they are likely divided by different roles. This Huang Qi is the seventh jailer of the Yellow Prison." Saint Devil explained to Zhou Tian, then sighed, "The Frontier Prison is extremely ancient. Its origins are probably only known, in part, by those occupying the top five void nodes."

"How cute these Daoist friends are! Why chase them away?" Huang Qi feigned confusion, leaving everyone present speechless. No matter what, these were Heavenly King-level experts, their hands stained with no less than four-digit casualties. On their own turf, they were figures capable of silencing crying children at night, yet Huang Qi used the word "cute" to describe them.

"Huang Qi, what if you and I join forces and split this World Source equally?" Yuan Chi ignored whatever Huang Qi was saying and proposed his own suggestion. Given the current situation, it seemed impossible for him to monopolize the World Source alone.

Huang Qi's eyes narrowed thoughtfully. Profit was paramount in the world. Although he couldn't stand Yuan Chi, partnering with him to split the World Source equally was indeed a good suggestion given the current circumstances.

"Huang Qi," Saint Devil frowned and called out.

"I am from Kyushu. I wish to make a deal with you."

"Oh?" Huang Qi was slightly surprised. He hadn't expected this third Dao Lord to be from Kyushu. At the same time, he realized why Yuan Chi had sought cooperation with him instead of this Dao Lord. Since he was from Kyushu, things became clear.

"What deal?"

"I can refrain from interfering with what you're after next, and I can even help you obtain it. But for this World Source, I hope you can help us acquire it," Saint Devil said to Huang Qi, his hands clasped behind his back.

"You know what I want?" Huang Qi asked indifferently, showing little reaction. He wouldn't agree to anything based on just one sentence from Saint Devil.

"I know a thing or two. After all, this place is where an ancient great figure from my Kyushu attained nirvana," Saint Devil said pointedly.

Huang Qi's pupils contracted, and a thoughtful expression appeared on his face. Saint Devil had already indicated it; it seemed he genuinely knew Huang Qi was here for that forbidden item. The Frontier Prison had sent him to act cautiously. A Heavenly Venerate's move would cause too much commotion, attracting too much attention. The Frontier Prison hadn't yet reached a point where it could openly contend against the entire Star Realm alone.

"Stop being so cagey! What 'thing to snatch later' are you talking about?" Yuan Chi said, his face flushed with anger, utterly confused. He had no idea what Saint Devil and Huang Qi were discussing. He didn't know whose tomb this was; he had only come because his clan had sent news that a World Source was about to emerge here. Thus, he was unaware of any forbidden item.

"Alright, I can agree to that. However, I don't need your help; just promise not to interfere. I also won't participate in this struggle for the World Source. But if you die, or if the final recipient isn't you, then I will intervene." Huang Qi finally agreed to Saint Devil's conditions. Retrieving the forbidden treasure was not so simple; it required a specific secret art. What he feared was that Saint Devil and his companions also possessed some secret art, given that they were from Kyushu, and the tomb's owner had intricate ties to Kyushu.

"Agreed." Saint Devil consented. His offer for Huang Qi to help them was merely a test. If he agreed, great; if not, it didn't matter, as long as he didn't intervene.

"Huang Qi, I also won't participate in snatching what you're after later. I want you to help *me*." Yuan Chi's eyes darted, and he also feigned a serious tone to Huang Qi.

"Brain-damaged." Huang Qi rolled his eyes and ignored him. "What nonsense are you talking about 'not intervening'? If you knew what that was, you wouldn't even care about this World Source."

Yuan Chi's face turned ashen, and his body trembled, clearly enraged.

Subsequently, the three of them made a Dao Heart Blood Oath, including Zhou Tian. Huang Qi was indeed cautious in his actions, not forgetting Zhou Tian's presence.

"I..."
"..."
"..."
As the three made their blood oath, two strange blood-colored runes emerged from Saint Devil's and Huang Qi's foreheads respectively, then merged together, signifying the oath's completion.

"You..." Huang Qi frowned and looked at Zhou Tian, as he was the only one without the oath completion mark.

Saint Devil retracted the aura covering Zhou Tian.

"You're a mortal!?" Even Huang Qi was shocked. He hadn't expected Zhou Tian to be a mortal, nor that Saint Devil would bring a mortal into this place.

Zhou Tian shrugged. "I said I couldn't swear, but you insisted I do. I'm quite helpless too."

After learning Zhou Tian was a mortal, Huang Qi no longer paid him mind. Such oaths were made to one's Dao Heart. In the countless worlds of the Star Realm, oaths invoking the Heavenly Dao as a witness were essentially useless. Only oaths made to one's own Dao Heart were universally accepted. Zhou Tian didn't even have cultivation, let alone a Dao Heart.

The others were also shocked. With their "big brother" and "little brother" appellations, one would expect at least a Heavenly King, but he turned out to be just a mortal. That was truly... something else. As for Zhou Tian hiding his cultivation, Huang Qi hadn't detected it. Some people did have that thought, but only for a fleeting moment. After all, Huang Qi was a Dao Lord. For someone's true cultivation to be undetectable even by a Dao Lord, what realm would that be? A Heavenly Venerate? If he really were a Heavenly Venerate, why would he bother with such complications? He'd just crush them directly.

Meanwhile, Yuan Chi regained his confidence. What was a mere mortal doing here, pretending to be a big shot?

Boom! Boom!
The roar of the Great Dao resounded. The golden palm was almost flattened, with only the extending golden rune chains still binding the cluster of World Source. The golden palm began to turn ethereal, but the rune chains became even more dazzling, all energy transferring to them. The seal had reached its final moments, on the verge of failing to suppress the World Source.

Bang!
The void exploded. A black stone tablet descended from above Zhou Tian's head. Saint Devil pointed a finger, and a golden lotus bloomed from the void, blocking the black stone tablet, sending ripples of spatial energy scattering outwards.

Yuan Chi immediately made his move, wanting to eliminate all competitors before the World Source fully emerged.

"Which of you three is the strongest?" Zhou Tian asked, looking up at the black stone tablet.

Saint Devil's body glowed, an imprint appearing on his glabella. His aura was vast and imposing as he confronted Yuan Chi.

"Huang Qi is the strongest, Yuan Chi is second, and I am the weakest," Saint Devil replied honestly.
