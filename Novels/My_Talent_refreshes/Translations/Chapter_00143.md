**Chapter 143: A Different Thousand Lakes and Islands, Completion of Mana Tempering**

Chu Ning's spiritual sense was powerful, his vision far surpassing that of ordinary Qi Condensation cultivators. From afar, he spotted a dock for boats and immediately steered his vessel towards it. Upon disembarking, a long, bustling street greeted his eyes, surprisingly prosperous with people coming and going. Among them were many cultivators, yet surprisingly, about half of the people were mortals with no cultivation whatsoever.

At this moment, Chu Ning hadn't altered his appearance, but he displayed his cultivation at the eighth level of Qi Condensation. Upon arriving at a new place, he naturally wouldn't fully expose his cultivation. However, in such a mixed place, having too low a cultivation wasn't a good thing either. As expected, Chu Ning's eighth-level Qi Condensation cultivation still held some deterrent power. It didn't matter if some mortals couldn't discern it. Occasionally, cultivators would glance at Chu Ning. Seeing his unfamiliar face and sensing his late-stage Qi Condensation cultivation, they immediately averted their gaze. At the same time, people would subtly keep their distance. Chu Ning naturally noticed this, yet his face showed little emotion.

After all, Rainbow Mist Island was merely an outermost spiritual island in the Thousand Lakes and Islands region. Judging by its spiritual energy density, it was quite ordinary. It was likely that late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators were not numerous on this island. Chu Ning proceeded along the street, looking for a place to gather information. Just then, a figure swiftly approached him.

"Fellow Daoist, you look quite unfamiliar. Are you new to the Thousand Lakes and Islands?"

Chu Ning heard the voice and stopped to look. Before him stood a middle-aged man dressed like a scholar. The man wore a scholar's robe, held a paper fan, and appeared to be around forty years old. Faint mana fluctuations could be felt from his body. However, his cultivation was pitifully low, only around the third level of Qi Condensation. Chu Ning didn't avoid the man; he nodded and said:

"Indeed, I've just arrived. May I ask what advice Fellow Daoist has for me?"

Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, the middle-aged scholar immediately smiled. "I wouldn't presume to advise, but seeing that you've just arrived and likely wish to inquire about information, I, Chen, am untalented but hoping to earn a few spirit stones."

Chu Ning's interest was piqued. "Oh? Is Fellow Daoist well-informed?"

The middle-aged scholar's face showed a hint of smugness, but he quickly reined it in, chuckling as he said: "My spiritual root aptitude is extremely poor, making cultivation hopeless. Lacking other immortal cultivation skills, I found another path and ventured into the business of selling information. Please forgive my impudence, Fellow Daoist."

Chu Ning nodded. "Alright, let's find a place to talk. I coincidentally wish to hear about some matters concerning this place." He had indeed seen an introduction to the Thousand Lakes and Islands in the Azure Stream Sect's records before, but he didn't believe that information was entirely accurate or comprehensive. Since he had arrived, it was naturally better to inquire locally.

The scholar named Chen heard this and said with a pleased expression: "Fellow Daoist, please follow me. We can converse at Drunken Immortal Pavilion."

"Drunken Immortal Pavilion." Chu Ning stood beneath the establishment, softly muttering the name. He hadn't expected to encounter the name of a mortal world inn here. At this moment, the scholar named Chen beside him spoke: "Fellow Daoist, don't underestimate these three words. Drunken Immortal Pavilion is the number one inn in the Thousand Lakes and Islands. Any island with significant human traffic has a Drunken Immortal Pavilion. It's rumored that this pavilion was directly founded by several of the Thousand Island Alliance Masters' families. Oh, and by the way, the name Drunken Immortal Pavilion isn't for show; there's a wine here called 'Immortal's Drunk.' Even cultivators at the perfected Qi Condensation stage will get drunk if they drink too much of it. Fellow Daoist might want to try some later."

Chu Ning was greatly surprised upon hearing this. An immortal cultivator's body is cleansed by spiritual energy; let alone perfected Qi Condensation cultivators, even mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivators wouldn't get drunk from alcohol. Yet, this cultivator named Chen claimed that perfected Qi Condensation cultivators would get drunk from this wine, which truly made him curious. However, once they sat down, when Chu Ning heard that a single pot of this wine cost five spirit stones, he immediately shook his head and said: "Forget it, five spirit stones is a bit too expensive. Let's just have some ordinary tea." He did have quite a few spirit stones in his storage bag, but upon arriving at a new place, he naturally wouldn't carelessly reveal his wealth.

Hearing Chu Ning's words, the scholar named Chen showed a hint of disappointment, but quickly concealed it and said: "I am Chen Wangdao. I haven't yet asked for Fellow Daoist's esteemed name."

"Chu Ning!"

Chu Ning didn't bother changing his name again. This place was, after all, quite far from the Azure Stream Sect, and the northern region was under the influence of other major sects. The Azure Stream Sect's reach wouldn't extend this far.

"So it's Fellow Daoist Chu. May I ask what kind of information you wish to hear?" Chen Wangdao inquired.

"The general power distribution of the Thousand Lakes and Islands, some matters requiring attention, how to find a better place to establish a cultivation cave, and so on..."

After Chu Ning finished speaking, Chen Wangdao nodded and began to narrate. After listening, Chu Ning was slightly astonished. "You mean, even if one is willing to pay spirit stones now, they cannot purchase a place from the Thousand Island Alliance to establish a cultivation cave?"

"That's right. Decades ago, one only needed to pay spirit stones to the Thousand Island Alliance. However, in recent years, the number of cultivators in the Thousand Lakes and Islands has continuously increased. Islands with spiritual veins, even those with the lowest-grade spiritual veins, have long since been occupied by cultivators." Chen Wangdao nodded, explaining to Chu Ning: "In the past few decades, the management of the Thousand Lakes and Islands has changed significantly compared to before. Almost every spiritual island now has one or several late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators jointly serving as island masters. They are responsible for collecting spirit stones from the island's cultivators and then submitting them to the Thousand Island Alliance."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but frown slightly. "So, if I want to find a place to establish a cultivation cave now, I shouldn't approach the Thousand Island Alliance, but rather the island masters of each island?"

Chen Wangdao gently fanned himself with the folding fan in his hand and said: "Indeed. Furthermore, in these various spiritual islands, most places with relatively dense spiritual energy already have late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators. Fellow Daoist is at the late-stage Qi Condensation realm. Even if you approach the various islands now, it might be difficult to obtain a satisfactory location."

Hearing this, Chu Ning's brow furrowed even deeper. Without a place with abundant spiritual energy, his cultivation would be greatly affected. After all, even if he could create talismans, the spiritual plants he possessed would ultimately need to be planted in a spiritual energy-rich area, which was equally important for his cultivation.

"However, it's not entirely without a solution." Chen Wangdao now spoke slowly with a smile. Then, under Chu Ning's gaze, he unhurriedly said: "Thirty years ago, the Thousand Island Alliance introduced the Thousand Island Grand Competition, held once every five years. If a cultivator set their sights on another island, then during the Thousand Island Grand Competition, they could issue a challenge to that island. If they won, they would gain the right to reside on and govern that island."

"Thousand Island Grand Competition?" Hearing this, Chu Ning vaguely guessed that Chen Wangdao's words were related to this. Indeed, the other party immediately continued: "One month from now is the Thousand Island Grand Competition. Large islands with mid-grade or higher second-tier spiritual veins might not have much activity. But some islands with low-grade second-tier or first-tier spiritual veins are now actively recruiting various experts, hoping to strengthen their island's power, either to avoid being taken over by others, or to be able to move to a better island." At this point, Chen Wangdao looked at Chu Ning: "With Fellow Daoist's strength, as long as you're willing to join, I believe there will still be islands willing to accept you."

Chu Ning now understood: he first had to represent an island in the Thousand Island Grand Competition. If he could help that island win, he would naturally be able to obtain a place for a cultivation cave. Hearing this, Chu Ning's brow furrowed slightly. He had originally thought that upon arriving here, he could resolve the matter of a cultivation cave by simply spending some spirit stones. He hadn't expected that he would ultimately have to participate in these combat trials. However, after some thought, Chu Ning still sighed inwardly, resolving to give it a try. After all, he had been away from the Azure Gorge Mountain Range for several months, and his cultivation had been slowed down significantly. Many spiritual plants in his storage bag were also at the point where they had to be planted. For a while, he truly couldn't find a suitable place other than this one.

So, Chu Ning asked Chen Wangdao: "Where can one find information about islands recruiting assistance?"

"I am untalented, but I happen to have a copy of that information in my possession. If Fellow Daoist desires it, I shall present it with both hands for just two spirit stones." Chen Wangdao looked at Chu Ning with a knowing smile, as if he had anticipated this.

Chu Ning didn't waste any more words. He immediately took out four spirit stones from his storage bag and handed them to Chen Wangdao, along with the fee for the information he had just received. Just now, Chen Wangdao had also given Chu Ning a rough map of the Thousand Lakes and Islands, calculating the map and the information together as two spirit stones.

Chen Wangdao was instantly overjoyed and said: "Fellow Daoist is truly straightforward." As he spoke, he took out a thin pamphlet from his storage bag and handed it to Chu Ning. Chu Ning immediately took it and carefully flipped through it. Although Chen Wangdao's strength was ordinary and he seemed quite money-grubbing, this item was rather good. After Chu Ning opened the small booklet, he saw that it meticulously recorded which islands were recruiting how many assistants and what cultivation levels they required. There were actually hundreds of pieces of information. Chu Ning quickly browsed through it and then put it into his storage bag. At this moment, Chen Wangdao continued:

"Fellow Daoist, the competition in a month's time will be held on Thousand Illusions Island, where the Thousand Island Alliance is located. Therefore, most islands are currently concentrated there to recruit personnel. Fellow Daoist only needs to go to Thousand Illusions Island."

After Chu Ning nodded, he asked the other party: "Then how does one get to Thousand Illusions Island?"

"Through a teleportation array, of course." Chen Wangdao looked at Chu Ning with a hint of bewilderment. Then he patted his head and said, "I forgot Fellow Daoist just arrived here. Actually, short-distance teleportation arrays aren't difficult for sects to arrange; many sects can set them up. However, managing teleportation arrays between different sectarian forces is a major hassle. So I've heard that outside of areas governed by major sects, teleportation arrays are relatively rare elsewhere."

Chu Ning nodded. For example, the area around Azure Stream Sect wasn't large, and Azure River Market was nearby, so there wasn't a significant need to set up a large-scale teleportation array. And for places like Wind Gorge Market, setting up an array didn't seem suitable either. Of course, this also had a lot to do with the fact that the Azure Gorge Mountain Range itself wasn't skilled in the Dao of formations. Thinking of this, Chu Ning asked with some curiosity: "Then, within this Thousand Island Alliance, are there perhaps individuals proficient in the Dao of formations?"

"Fellow Daoist, you guessed correctly." Chen Wangdao replied with a smile. "Among the successive Alliance Masters of the Thousand Island Alliance, there is a family named Cen. Members of this family are indeed proficient in the Dao of formations." Only then did Chu Ning's face show enlightenment.

Immediately after, he bid farewell to Chen Wangdao and left, following the indicated direction to find the teleportation array located in the center of the island. At the teleportation array, there was currently a cultivator in his early thirties. After Chu Ning explained his intention, the cultivator said expressionlessly: "Travel to Thousand Illusions Island costs ten spirit stones per trip. You can pay ten spirit stones yourself and leave immediately, or you can wait here for enough people to gather before going."

Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately chose the second option. Having just entered the Thousand Lakes and Islands region, it was better to remain low-key. The cultivator wasn't surprised and simply let Chu Ning wait by the formation. Fortunately, Rainbow Mist Island had quite a few people, and since Thousand Illusions Island was the main island of the region, many people were heading there. Chu Ning only waited there for less than the time it takes for an incense stick to burn, and ten people had gathered. After each person paid one spirit stone, the cultivator in his early thirties activated the teleportation array.

"So this is Thousand Illusions Island?" Stepping out of the teleportation array, Chu Ning looked around and saw that the island was enveloped in spiritual mist, its density vaguely comparable to that of the ordinary inner sect of the Azure Stream Sect.

"This island probably possesses a relatively high-grade second-tier spiritual vein." Chu Ning secretly muttered to himself, but then he recalled that this was the Thousand Island Alliance's stronghold, and his mind was put at ease. Walking into the street, Chu Ning observed carefully. Compared to Rainbow Mist Island, there were far fewer mortals on this island. Looking around, surprisingly, seven or eight out of ten were immortal cultivators. Moreover, their cultivation levels were higher than on Rainbow Mist Island, with most having mid-stage Qi Condensation cultivation or higher. Late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators were not particularly rare either. However, ninth-level Qi Condensation and perfected Qi Condensation cultivators were not common.

Chu Ning wasn't in a hurry to check the places where various islands were recruiting assistance. Chen Wangdao's previous words were just his side of the story. Although he generally believed some of it, he naturally wouldn't believe it entirely and still needed to make some inquiries.

Drunken Immortal Pavilion. Chu Ning once again chose this relatively mixed-up place. The information one could hear in such places, though mixed and often rumors, still contained many useful tidbits. Compared to the Drunken Immortal Pavilion on Rainbow Mist Island, the one on Thousand Illusions Island was larger and had more people. Furthermore, most of the cultivators gathered there were at mid-stage Qi Condensation or higher. Many of them were even using sound transmission techniques when conversing. However, under Chu Ning's powerful spiritual sense, all these conversations were heard one by one.

Two *kechen* later, Chu Ning exited Drunken Immortal Pavilion. "It was indeed as Chen Wangdao said: the Thousand Island Grand Competition would be held in a month. However, judging from the discussions among the people in Drunken Immortal Pavilion, those currently rushing to recruit were mostly islands with relatively ordinary spiritual energy and strength. Those islands possessing second-tier spiritual veins weren't worried about failing to recruit people, so they would only begin recruiting in the last ten days."

These pieces of information surfaced in Chu Ning's mind, and he made his decision. "Although I don't intend to join those large islands with the densest spiritual energy, I still need a decent place. Given this, I'll have to wait a bit longer. However, there is a dedicated trading place for rogue cultivators on this island, which I can go and observe. I'll need many spirit stones in the future, so perhaps I can create some talismans in the next few days and sell them." Chu Ning thought to himself and then walked towards the rogue cultivator gathering place on the island, preparing to scout it out first.

After half a day had passed, Chu Ning checked into an inn on the island specifically prepared for visiting cultivators. Though called an inn, it was built atop a mountain and possessed a certain mysterious quality.

"This room is actually constructed from special spiritual stone, not only capable of isolating mana fluctuations, but also spells from cultivators below the mid-stage Foundation Establishment realm cannot damage it." Chu Ning surveyed the ten-zhang-sized room, a hint of curiosity in his heart. He tried directly unleashing a Verdant Wood Sword Art, and sure enough, the room's walls remained completely undamaged. "It's indeed a good place for cultivation, but the price is quite high: four spirit stones a day. Even renting for a month costs 100 spirit stones." Chu Ning shook his head. This price was simply unaffordable for ordinary cultivators. However, this place was relatively close to the core spiritual vein on Thousand Illusions Island, and the spiritual energy density was good. Moreover, one hundred low-grade spirit stones truly weren't too much for Chu Ning, and he already had a need for a cultivation site. Therefore, even though the price wasn't low, he still chose to rent a room.

"The cultivation of the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art needs to accelerate. I must complete all mana tempering within this month. At the same time, I must quickly catch up on other delayed cultivation." Having made up his mind, Chu Ning merely glanced around before immediately sitting down cross-legged.

[Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art] (Profound-tier High-grade), First Layer (90/5000)
[Nine Evolutions Body Refinement Art], First Volume, Unbroken Sinews (868/1500)
[Spirit Refinement Art], Second Layer (255/2000)

For these three months, Chu Ning had been in an area lacking spiritual energy, so he had basically been unable to absorb sufficient fire-attributed spiritual energy. Thus, the progress of the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art naturally couldn't be fast. However, Chu Ning wasn't without gains. Because he relied entirely on the generation and conversion of wood-attributed mana within his body, he had gained a deeper understanding of 'wood generating fire'. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth here was relatively dense, so Chu Ning simply didn't use any pills or fire spirit crystals. He continued to use the most basic method, a painstaking 'water-grinding' effort, to complete the tempering and conversion of his mana.

This cultivation lasted for a full seven days. Seven days later, Chu Ning, who was cultivating, suddenly opened his eyes.

[Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art] (Profound-tier High-grade), First Layer (100/5000)

Just as he had anticipated, when the proficiency of the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art reached 100, all his mana had completed its tempering and conversion. Chu Ning casually raised a hand, and a wisp of mana condensed at his fingertip.

Sensing the perfectly balanced wood and fire dual-attribute mana on it, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction. Nearly a hundred days of painstaking effort had undoubtedly yielded very significant results. Not only did he further consolidate his ninth-level Qi Condensation cultivation, but he also gained incredibly pure and effortless control over his wood and fire dual-attributed mana.

At this moment, with a thought from Chu Ning, the mana at his fingertip immediately transformed into pure wood-attributed mana. Then, with another flick, a wisp of fire-attributed mana appeared on his left fingertip. The next moment, with a thought from Chu Ning, the two wisps of mana instantly transformed again, becoming balanced wood-fire dual-attributed mana.

"Only now can I truly consider myself to have entered the true path of the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art. From now on, the cultivation of this art can proceed normally. And it's also time to cultivate some fire-attributed spells!"
