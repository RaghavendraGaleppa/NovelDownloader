# Chapter 93: Breakthrough, True Talisman Spirit Body (Two-in-One)

"Your pee can actually help spiritual plants grow?" Chu Ning asked Ling Xiaobai through a spiritual sense transmission, and Ling Xiaobai responded with a "Ying" sound. There was a hint of pride in the sound.

"Want to eat!" The next moment, Ling Xiaobai's spiritual sense transmission echoed in Chu Ning's mind. Clearly, Ling Xiaobai could master more than just the words "Let me go." This made communication much more convenient.

"Okay, remember to help this Iron Stem Orchid grow every day. If it really produces Iron Orchid Fruit, I'll share a few with you." As soon as Chu Ning finished speaking, Ling Xiaobai let out a "Ying" and immediately went to the other Iron Stem Orchids.

Over half an hour later, the spiritual energy absorbed by the Iron Stem Orchids was completely transferred and absorbed by Chu Ning. He had not forgotten that Ling Xiaobai could launch attack spells when they first met.

Chu Ning's figure flashed, and he took Ling Xiaobai directly out of the market, arriving at a small hill on the northeast side of the spirit field. This was the exact spot where he used to cultivate the Cangmu Sword Art.

He lightly murmured, a smile gracing his face. Feeling the spiritual power transformed from the medicinal pills within his body, Chu Ning began to circulate the Green Wood Evergreen Art to cultivate.

Ling Xiaobai, who had never paid much attention to Chu Ning's cultivation, tilted its small head, looking quite surprised at the scene. He hadn't forgotten that Ling Xiaobai could launch attack spells when they first met.

He thought about a possibility but didn't rush. Instead, he tried again every short while.
When Chu Ning took out the Vajra Talisman, he paused, then put it back down. He then casually took out a few other talismans from his storage bag.

He thought, *This little guy has quite a few abilities.*

He thought of this, and Chu Ning did not stop, sending out streams of Green Wood Spring Bloom Art to cover the entire circle of Iron Stem Orchids. This was a method he could use for his daily cultivation. He had no Earth Spirit Root, so it had nothing to do with whether he had a Metal Spirit Root.

"Picked it up? What kind of spiritual beast is this? I don't recognize it."

*Spirit Refining Art, First Layer (341/1000)*

Since that was the case, consuming it for a bit longer probably wouldn't matter. As Chu Ning lifted his brush, a blue light flashed, and then a talisman appeared before him.

Chu Ning cultivated for half a day, feeling very satisfied with the speed of his cultivation aided by the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art. He picked up a Yuan Gathering Pill and swallowed it directly. For example, the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art, Cangmu Sword Art… At the same time, the Iron Stem Grass had begun to grow normally five days after being planted, and Chu Ning was also using the Iron Stem Orchids to cultivate with the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art. Later, he even purchased edible spirit chickens and grey spirit rabbits from some cultivation families to eat with spirit rice. Therefore, buying medicinal pills with spirit stones to assist cultivation became the best method.

At this moment, Chu Ning couldn't suppress his eagerness. Clearly, Ling Xiaobai, this cute pet, was very appealing to women.

"Metal talismans work too!"

Midway, Chu Ning's Yuan Gathering Pills ran out once. He then used a shapeshifting spell to change his appearance and bought 30 more from Gu Xiaoqing. When Chu Ning went out, it trotted along beside him.

"Thirty pills?" Gu Xiaoqing was slightly stunned.

The Green Wood Evergreen Art successfully increased by 1 proficiency point. Chu Ning immediately checked the proficiency prompt in his mind. Gu Xiaoqing saw that Ling Xiaobai wasn't very willing to acknowledge her, so she regretfully retracted her hand, looked at the small beast a few more times, then turned to Chu Ning and said, "Yuan Gathering Pills? Junior Brother Chu wants to consume them himself."

At the same time, that talisman turned directly into ashes. He then sat beside it, cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art. Chu Ning agreed, reaching out with 300 spirit stones to the other party, then taking the Yuan Gathering Pills.

"This little spiritual beast is too adorable..."

In the afternoon and evening, he continued cultivating his cultivation art, body refinement, and spirit refinement in peace. Moreover, there was no need to hide anymore; he could just go to Gu Xiaoqing's place to buy them.

Chu Ning blinked his eyes after hearing this. After finishing these tasks, Chu Ning sat cross-legged in the densest part of the Green Spirit Fruit planting area, ready to cultivate the Green Wood Evergreen Art.

"So Junior Brother Chu is about to break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement." Gu Xiaoqing gave Chu Ning a gentle smile.

"If this little guy pees like this every day, will it smell too strong if I cultivate in the middle of these Iron Stem Orchids?" This way, his cultivation speed increase also had a good reason; after all, he couldn't stay stuck at the current "fourth layer of Qi Refinement" publicly.

Spirit stones were consumed one after another. Recently, among Chu Ning's three types of cultivation—Qi Refinement, Body Refinement, and Spirit Refinement—body refinement had been the most steady. Chu Ning thought of a possibility. He didn't rush, but tried again every short while. Gu Xiaoqing first greeted Chu Ning, then her gaze fell on Ling Xiaobai beside Chu Ning.

"Ying!"

"Our cultivators are quite sensitive. Don't talk about 30 pills. Even 5 or 10 pills, if the pill poison isn't expelled in time, we can detect it during cultivation." She then took out another jade bottle, poured out two pills, and said with a smile, "I won't reduce the price for Junior Brother Chu, I'll just give you two extra pills. When Junior Brother Chu's Golden Yuan Fruit ripens, don't forget to give me a discount."

Spiritual energy entered Chu Ning's body, flowed into his dantian to be converted into spiritual power, and then circulated outside the sixth ring of spiritual power. These were the Yuan Gathering Pills he had just bought from Gu Xiaoqing.

The proficiency of the Green Wood Evergreen Art indeed entered the third layer. Chu Ning then turned to the Green Spirit Fruit and cast streams of Green Wood Spring Bloom Art. Chu Ning continued to absorb the spiritual energy from the spirit stones, consuming them one after another. The spiritual power talisman symbols actually flew directly from the talisman and drilled into one of the small light points in Chu Ning's palm.

Chu Ning thought for a moment, "Thirty pills." As for Qi Refinement, needless to say, he had Yuan Gathering Pills and spirit stones. And according to his previous estimation, as long as he broke through the 900 threshold, he would be able to directly break through the mid-Qi Refinement stage and enter the late-Qi Refinement stage!

The Yuan Gathering Pills were gone, and Chu Ning had no intention of buying more. Instead, he directly took out a pile of spirit stones, preparing to break through from mid-Qi Refinement to late-Qi Refinement in one go. Then, as Chu Ning's gaze continued downward, his eyes widened in pleasant surprise. Chu Ning dismissed this thought and simply stopped fretting over it.

On days when the market wasn't open, Chu Ning would go to the spirit field in the morning to tend to his crops. However, this woman was clearly attracted by the somewhat adorable Ling Xiaobai. Chu Ning shook his head and said, "I don't know what kind of spiritual beast it is either."

For nearly two months, Chu Ning fully focused on improving the Green Wood Evergreen Art with the help of Yuan Gathering Pills, spirit stones, and the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art. He directly took out three bottles of Yuan Gathering Pills and handed them to Chu Ning. Until now, Chu Ning hadn't relied too much on medicinal pills for cultivation. With this in mind, Chu Ning made up his mind.

When the tenth spirit stone beside Chu Ning turned into powder, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes. Previously, it was mainly due to the beast tide, which had diverted too much of his energy to talisman crafting. What pleased Chu Ning even more was that all 50 Iron Stem Orchids had actually flowered.

When the True Talisman Spirit Body talent was refreshed, Chu Ning naturally understood how to use True Talisman Arts. As this spiritual power increased, it gradually formed a faint, larger ring of spiritual power above the sixth spiritual power ring. These were the Beast Trapping Talisman, Dark Thunder Talisman, Earth Evasion Talisman, Geng Metal Sword Talisman, and Vajra Talisman.

"Under normal circumstances, it's best to take this Yuan Gathering Pill once every three days to fully absorb its medicinal power." This meant that spells like the Ice Control Art and Earth Evasion Art could be directly converted into his instant-cast spells.

"How many do you want?" He would even occasionally use spirit stones. Ling Xiaobai looked warily at Gu Xiaoqing approaching, very guarded, as if ready to attack at any moment. Chu Ning went straight to the backyard. Chu Ning immediately followed the incantations of the Green Wood Evergreen Art, integrating these scattered spiritual powers and forcing them closer to the sixth ring of spiritual power.

"Okay, thank you, Senior Sister." For the next period, Chu Ning led a highly disciplined life. The effect was good; Ling Xiaobai could gradually understand some simple words. After adjusting his spiritual sense state to its best, he held a spirit stone in his hand and began cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen Art.

A crucial reason for this was that Chu Ning possessed the Wood Spirit Body, allowing him to absorb spiritual energy from spirit stones very quickly. Leaping up, Chu Ning first went to the table, picked up his talisman brush, and laid out talisman paper. He didn't have a Metal Spirit Root, and he had made no progress whatsoever when he previously tried to learn the Metal Sword Art.

For the next ten days, Chu Ning cultivated, farmed, and played with Ling Xiaobai every day. He planned to buy some more and continue cultivating with the help of medicinal pills. Normal cultivators couldn't quickly absorb spiritual energy from spirit stones. He deliberately trained Ling Xiaobai to listen to his normal speech, sometimes saying a sentence and then transmitting it again via spiritual sense. Upon hearing the spiritual sense transmission, Ling Xiaobai lowered its guard. The little guy, seeing Chu Ning's mischievous gaze, immediately felt something was amiss.

As for Spirit Refinement, with daily talisman crafting and the black wooden sword, Chu Ning's spiritual sense not only recovered quickly but also grew stronger rapidly.

"Senior Sister Gu, I'll be careful. I'll buy a little, and I'll manage the dosage myself." Chu Ning finally felt a little relieved. Chu Ning didn't stop there. The next moment, he pulled out a jade bottle from his storage bag. With these pills, he could properly cultivate and improve his progress for the next period. He wanted to first try the magic of this True Talisman Art.

Chu Ning first took out the Beast Trapping Talisman and moved it closer to one of the glowing spots. The next moment, the talisman symbols within the Beast Trapping Talisman flashed with white light.

"One Yuan Gathering Pill increased proficiency by 3 points." Having tasted the sweetness, Chu Ning arrived at Gu Xiaoqing's shop early that morning. Then he found a secluded place to cultivate the Cangmu Sword Art, which gained more and more proficiency under Chu Ning's continuous cultivation.

"Junior Brother Chu has arrived."

"Senior Sister Gu."

"Senior Sister Gu, do you have Yuan Gathering Pills for sale? I'd like to buy some."

"Xiaobai, don't be afraid, I'm just trying out a spell." When Chu Ning picked up the Vajra Talisman, he paused, then put it back down.

"This little guy just got picked up; he's still a bit shy." Seeing this, Chu Ning quickly transmitted a spiritual sense message to Ling Xiaobai, indicating that this was his friend and there was no danger. Chu Ning leaped up and landed right in the middle of a circle of Iron Stem Orchids. And he also had to take them out of his storage bag. Then, without exception, they all integrated and transformed into True Talisman Arts.

He directly tossed one into his mouth and then resumed cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen Art. Thinking this, Chu Ning casually took out several talismans from his storage bag. However, it was clearly not suitable to try out various spells in this courtyard. By then, he would use the Seven Star Spirit Fruit to break through the bottleneck in one go. He peed again.

Chu Ning didn't continue cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen Art. Instead, he first cultivated the Spirit Refining Art. Besides Chu Ning casting the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art every day, Ling Xiaobai was also indispensable. After praising Ling Xiaobai, Chu Ning cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art a full thirty times on the Iron Stem Orchids. Anyway, from the current perspective, this frequency of pill consumption had no adverse effects on him.

"Qi Refinement Seventh Layer!"

"Oh, what a cute spiritual beast! Junior Brother Chu, is this a spiritual beast you bred? I've never seen one like it before."

*Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Undying Bone (251/600)*

Chu Ning began to ponder in his mind. He had been taking them for ten consecutive days, but he hadn't felt any pill poison. Since arriving at the sect, his cultivation hadn't been normal. Chu Ning's reaction was no longer like yesterday's; his only thought now was...

After half an hour of cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, when the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art began to show better effects on the Iron Stem Orchids, a circle of differently colored talisman light points suddenly appeared on Chu Ning's palm. He continued cultivating until the entire Yuan Gathering Pill was fully refined, then he stopped and began to craft talismans. However, when Chu Ning tried to bring another talisman closer to the initial talisman light point, it didn't succeed.

After another thirty uses of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art, Chu Ning finally finished casting spells on the Iron Stem Orchids. In the afternoon and evening, he cultivated peacefully. Instantly, streams of spiritual energy from the Green Spirit Fruit gathered towards Chu Ning's body. Gu Xiaoqing, hearing Chu Ning say this, naturally said no more. This talisman was a gift from Liao Yunming at the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. It was actually a low-grade superior defensive talisman recorded in the Spirit Talisman Catalog, which Chu Ning had never used. It was important to note that even talismans required time to be activated by spiritual power.

His eyes flashed with a sharp glint, then returned to normal. He hoped Gu Xiaoqing would recognize it, but clearly, this fellow disciple was also unaware. Ling Xiaobai's white spell seemed to be ice-elemental, and its power didn't seem weak either. In the first few days, he had made some progress with the help of spirit stones, but after the Green Spirit Fruit and Iron Stem Orchids were successfully cultivated, this innate ability was already powerful enough.

Half a month ago, after more than four months of cultivation, Chu Ning had cultivated the low-grade superior spell, Cangmu Sword Art, to the instant-cast stage. However, soon, the little guy lay down again and fell into a deep sleep. He then immediately checked the Green Wood Evergreen Art.

*Green Wood Evergreen Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Second Layer (532/900)*

Although this talisman transformed into a True Talisman Art, casting this spell was actually the same as activating a talisman.

"This might mean that five True Talisman Arts can be transformed?" However, Chu Ning wasn't in such a hurry. His Undying Bone proficiency was already close to 200. Thus, Chu Ning took out the black wooden sword again, placed it on his feet, and began cultivating the Spirit Refining Art. However, at this moment, Chu Ning was still preparing to give it a try. He was already at the sixth layer of Qi Refinement, and this Yuan Gathering Pill was more effective in the mid-Qi Refinement stage.

At this moment, it actually walked directly to Chu Ning's side.

*Green Wood Evergreen Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Second Layer (528/900)*

He could use Yuan Gathering Pills to cultivate for a while now. As he spoke, Chu Ning raised his hand, and a white light flew out, enveloping Ling Xiaobai. He put away the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman and then picked up the Vajra Talisman again, bringing it closer. Then, he began to cultivate the Green Wood Evergreen Art.

"It really only works with talismans I made myself." This was mainly because Chu Ning had the benefit of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art, so his cultivation speed wasn't slow. With so many boosts, Chu Ning's Green Wood Evergreen Art cultivation improved rapidly, at a rate of nearly 5 proficiency points per day. Whereas in a fight, life and death are often decided in an instant. It probably wouldn't take long to reach the instant-cast realm. Although he had blocked it with a magical artifact, the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield was a mid-grade magical artifact.

Chu Ning, seeing Ling Xiaobai's demeanor, quickly explained his intention. When he arrived at Gu Xiaoqing's shop, she was holding several jade bottles, arranging pills. If his previous speculation was correct, he would encounter a bottleneck when Undying Bone reached 300.

"Low-grade superior talisman! Cangmu Sword Talisman!" A golden light flashed, and the talisman symbols drilled into the second light point in his palm. Then, he casually took out the low-grade superior talisman, Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman, from his storage bag. Chu Ning was overjoyed at the sight. Then, the spiritual plants he had planted hadn't grown well, and the effect of his most common cultivation method, aided by the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art, hadn't yet manifested. Although it still stated that the number of True Talisman Arts was limited, it was enough to greatly excite Chu Ning.

The breakthrough of Undying Bone, even if it was slower than breaking through to the late Qi Refinement stage, shouldn't be much slower. "This increase is roughly the same as, or even slightly less than, directly using 10 spirit stones." So, all things considered, using this Yuan Gathering Pill could save some time and help him speed up his cultivation. But once he broke through this boundary, it would be much more than that.

Looking at the white talisman light spot flashing in his palm, Chu Ning's gaze turned to Ling Xiaobai, looking amused. Thinking this, Chu Ning picked up the Dark Thunder Talisman and Earth Evasion Talisman and tried them as well. Ling Xiaobai didn't know why, but its sleep these past two days seemed to be even less than before. He squatted down directly, looking at Ling Xiaobai and asking curiously:

*Green Wood Evergreen Art (Yellow-tier Low-grade), Second Layer (899/900)*

The brush landed on the paper, and with a thought, Chu Ning's talisman brush moved across the paper. And this Iron Stem Orchid, once it flowers, is guaranteed to bear fruit.

"Integrate!" Thinking this, Chu Ning said to Gu Xiaoqing: This was something Chu Ning had never even dreamed of when he first joined the Green Stream Sect. Chu Ning looked at the high-quality talisman before him and couldn't help but marvel at the magic of this True Talisman Art. Thinking of this, he asked Gu Xiaoqing:

"Senior Sister Gu, can we cultivators sense the residual pill poison in our bodies?"

"It's already integrated?" As she spoke, Gu Xiaoqing reached out, wanting to touch Ling Xiaobai. He was testing the Cangmu Sword Art! Chu Ning wouldn't attribute this to his Green Wood Spring Bloom Art; it could only be Ling Xiaobai's ability.

"The little guy has quite a few abilities." After a quarter of an hour, another Beast Trapping Talisman finally integrated into the talisman ring in his palm. Until today, the proficiency of the second layer of Green Wood Evergreen Art finally reached the critical point of 899. He had been taking 10 pills continuously, one every day, but he hadn't felt any pill poison.

This place was precisely where he had been cultivating the Cangmu Sword Art. He didn't stop for a moment, continuing to utilize his Wood Spirit Body's ability, picking up more spirit stones to cultivate. Ling Xiaobai, however, was unwilling. It leaped away, directly onto Chu Ning's shoulder. Gu Xiaoqing, seeing Ling Xiaobai's expression, clearly became even more interested. Chu Ning immediately formed a hand seal to release the Beast Trapping Talisman. It was the spiritual power restraint formed by the Beast Trapping Talisman.

Indeed, the next moment, the talisman flashed and disappeared directly into the talisman ring.

*Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Undying Bone (251/600)*

He immediately had a great desire to try the wonders of the True Talisman Art. After absorbing three spirit stones, Chu Ning felt that the sixth ring of spiritual power in his dantian had reached saturation. Checking his current proficiency, Chu Ning closed his eyes and began to cultivate. It was precisely due to Ling Xiaobai's persistent "irrigation" every day that the Iron Stem Orchids grew as they did now. And whenever Chu Ning needed a major breakthrough, he would directly use spirit stones.

"Of course, you can!" Gu Xiaoqing nodded slightly. Gu Xiaoqing just curiously observed Ling Xiaobai. And the second aspect, which followed, surprised Chu Ning even more. After two years in the sect, he had broken through to the late Qi Refinement stage! "Even if it's 5 or 10 pills, if the pill poison isn't expelled in time, it can be detected during cultivation."

And the meaning of True Talisman Arts was that all the spells he could instantly cast could be transformed into talisman arts. Chu Ning could directly draw these spells onto talisman paper through talisman crafting.

*Spirit Refining Art, First Layer (171/1000)*

*Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art, First Volume, Undying Bone (181/600)*

However, Chu Ning now understood it without being taught. After finishing the day's various talisman crafting, Chu Ning's spiritual sense was largely depleted. Chu Ning, however, did not stop cultivating directly. He took out the Yuan Gathering Pills he bought from Gu Xiaoqing. At worst, if he felt any pill poison, he could stop taking the pills and expel the poison. However, it seemed to know what Chu Ning had just said, so at this moment, it did not resist.

As for cultivation, Chu Ning took one Yuan Gathering Pill a day to cultivate the Green Wood Evergreen Art, without neglecting Body Refinement or Spirit Refinement. With a thought, Chu Ning made the circle of light disappear. When he looked at his hand again, he couldn't see any difference. However, Chu Ning could clearly feel that with just a thought, the five talismans in his hand could be activated at any time.
