# Chapter 3: First Level of Qi Refinement, Sect Benefits  

"Three attributes!"  

Zhang Yan had thought it was just an ordinary hoe.  

But unexpectedly, it actually had three attributes—one offensive and two supportive. The two supportive attributes were especially useful to him. With these, farming would become much easier. At the very least, he wouldn’t accidentally mistake spirit rice for weeds and uproot them.  

"Equip!"  

Without hesitation, Zhang Yan equipped the spirit hoe.  

After equipping it, the cultivation jade slip reappeared in his hand.  

"Can only have one equipment at a time?"  

Seeing the jade slip, Zhang Yan understood the limitation.  

"Equip!"  

He tried switching to the jade slip, but it remained in his hand.  

"So, there’s a cooldown for switching equipment. I wonder how long it is. But since I equipped the jade slip yesterday and can switch to the hoe today, the cooldown must be less than a day."  

Zhang Yan pondered. Though this golden finger had its restrictions, they were manageable. Switching between the hoe and the jade slip would suffice for his daily cultivation and work.  

Surveying the vast spirit fields, Zhang Yan wasted no time and began weeding.  

Even though the spirit hoe was equipped in his inventory, its sharpness attribute made the task effortless. Weeds were cleanly severed at the roots.  

Elder Lin only required cutting, not uprooting, since the roots were too deep to remove entirely. It was tedious labor, but Zhang Yan didn’t complain. He worked diligently until dusk, managing to clear five acres by the time the sun set.  

With Elder Lin responsible for a hundred acres, at this rate, it would take Zhang Yan twenty days to finish. And by then, the first fields would already have new weeds sprouting.  

"I need to find a way to speed this up," Zhang Yan sighed. Otherwise, he’d spend all his time weeding with no room for anything else.  

After Elder Lin inspected his work, they returned to the spirit plantation.  

"Didn’t expect you to be so capable!" Elder Lin remarked, clearly pleased.  

For a first-timer, clearing five acres in a day was impressive. Not a single weed was missed, and none of the spirit rice was damaged.  

"You’ve got a knack for cultivation! You might even become a spirit planter!"  

Elder Lin patted Zhang Yan’s shoulder warmly.  

In the world of cultivation, survival wasn’t just about strength—it was about mastering a craft. The so-called "Hundred Arts of Cultivation" included prestigious paths like alchemy, artifact forging, formations, and talismans. However, these elite arts required talent, heritage, and resources, making them inaccessible to ordinary cultivators.  

Spirit planting, though less glamorous, was stable and reliable. A skilled spirit planter could cultivate rare plants and earn substantial rewards.  

Though Zhang Yan wasn’t fond of farming, without better options, mastering this craft was his best bet. With the hoe’s attributes—**Spirit Plant Care (Proficient)** and **Spirit Plant Identification**—he could quickly become a competent spirit planter.  

"Once you become a spirit planter, you can manage your own plantation, recruit disciples, and lease large fields, just like me," Elder Lin said, stroking his sparse beard.  

"I’m still inexperienced. I’ll need your guidance, Elder Lin."  

"Of course, of course."  

Elder Lin was fond of diligent disciples like Zhang Yan, who worked hard without cutting corners. After a brief chat and dinner, Zhang Yan returned to his room to cultivate.  

---  

Though becoming a spirit planter was tempting, Zhang Yan knew cultivation was his true foundation.  

"Switch!"  

The jade slip vanished, replaced by the spirit hoe.  

"About six hours to switch?"  

Calculating the cooldown, Zhang Yan nodded. It was manageable and wouldn’t hinder his cultivation. He immediately resumed his practice.  

---  

Two months passed in the blink of an eye.  

Between cultivation and weeding, Zhang Yan grew noticeably thinner.  

One day, as he meditated, spiritual energy surged through his meridians, converging toward a stubborn acupoint.  

*Crack.*  

A faint sound echoed as the barrier fractured.  

"It’s breaking!"  

Zhang Yan focused, channeling more energy until—  

*Boom.*  

The dam shattered.  

Spiritual energy flooded through the newly opened meridian, cycling once before settling in his dantian.  

"Success at last!"  

Exhaling deeply, Zhang Yan grinned.  

After two months of relentless effort, he had broken through to the **First Level of Qi Refinement**, officially stepping into the ranks of cultivators.  

"And now, I can finally learn spells!"  

He had long yearned for this moment. Previously, without opened meridians, spellcasting was impossible.  

But now, as a true Qi Refinement cultivator, the path of magic was his to explore.  

"Best of all, reaching this stage means I can claim my sect benefits!"
