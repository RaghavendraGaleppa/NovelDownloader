Song Yuanbao came straight to the point, trying to alarm Xiao Ji.  

Xiao Ji was well acquainted with this constable's temperament. The square-faced officer always exaggerated whenever he sought his help—likely fearing refusal. But was Xiao Ji the kind of man to turn others away so easily?  

As long as the reward was sufficient, anything could be negotiated.  

Song Yuanbao, too, had come to understand Xiao Ji quite well. He knew that Daoist Xiao was kind-hearted—especially when it came to spirit stones, gold, silver, and even copper coins. His goodwill toward such things was particularly strong.
