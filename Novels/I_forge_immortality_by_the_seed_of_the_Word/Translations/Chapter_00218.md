# Chapter 216: The First Natal World

*Buzz!*

Before Zhang Jing could react, a piece of information suddenly appeared in his mind.

After a long moment, he slowly opened his eyes, a flash of enlightenment illuminating his thoughts. "So that's how it is!"

The so-called Natal World was a pseudo-world, created using the generative essence of Taiyi and the foundation of the twenty-four Heavens Worlds – no, now thirty-six Heavens Worlds illusory projections – through Innate Primordial Immortal Light. It existed by relying on Zhang Jing.

Of course, such a minor world couldn't compare to a true world. However, it was exceptionally profound.

Especially since each Natal World could nurture an Innate Divine Being, which could be considered a clone of Zhang Jing, or even another Zhang Jing. The power of his Innate Divine Ability, Taiyi Heavenly Gang Myriad Gods Natal World, was intricately linked to the Natal Minor Worlds he developed and opened. The reason it currently had no quality was precisely because none of the thirty-six Natal Worlds had been developed yet.

Thinking of this, Zhang Jing couldn't help but look up, a hint of pleasant surprise in his eyes. He had bet correctly!

In terms of potential and power, the Taiyi Heavenly Gang Myriad Gods Natal World far surpassed the divine ability he had fused during the Golden Core Divine Ability Realm of the World Derivation Path: the Innate Primordial Immortal Light.

Naturally, Zhang Jing's gaze flickered. He extended a single hand, and a wisp of hazy immortal light immediately appeared, shimmering with an extremely sharp and terrifying edge. The aura of earth, fire, water, and wind flowed within it. The surrounding void instantly became unstable.

Within the Taiyi Heavenly Gang Myriad Gods Natal World, Innate Primordial Immortal Light was also born. And clearly, all this spontaneously generated Innate Primordial Immortal Light was under Zhang Jing's command.

"So, even without a single Natal World opened, the Taiyi Heavenly Gang Myriad Gods Natal World is at least a mid-third-grade grand divine ability! But to open and develop a Natal World—"

As if he had thought of something, the excitement on Zhang Jing's face abruptly faded, replaced by a faint worry. His brows furrowed subconsciously. He recalled the information that had just appeared in his mind. According to it, the opening and development of each Natal World required a divine item containing Innate Dao Laws as a catalyst. The quality of this divine item, in turn, directly correlated with the quality of the corresponding Natal World being opened.

"In that case, it's quite troublesome."

"Divine items containing Innate Dao Laws... none of them are anything but extremely precious existences. How could they be so easily found? And even if found, whether I could afford them is another question entirely."

"Not to mention, thirty-six Natal Worlds mean a full thirty-six different Innate Divine Items are needed." Zhang Jing sighed, and the Innate Primordial Immortal Light in his hand instantly dissipated.

Immediately after, a wisp of exceedingly light and ethereal azure cloud qi quietly appeared. Countless tiny Dao Law divine chains flickered within it, faintly connecting to the vast and boundless Innate Pure Qi Grand Dao. The terrifying scene of pure qi rising to form an boundless firmament constantly emerged within.

Zhang Jing's gaze fell upon the Innate Azure Heaven Cloud Qi in his hand. This was one of the only two Innate Divine Items he currently possessed that could be used for the development of a Natal World. After a moment of thought, he didn't hesitate.

Behind him, the thirty-six layers of chaotic and hazy illusory projections of the Heavens Worlds slowly manifested. Following Zhang Jing's will, the wisp of Innate Azure Heaven Cloud Qi trembled slightly, then shot straight into the first layer of the Heavens World projection, immediately erupting with waves of towering emerald immortal light.

*Boom—*

A deafening sound suddenly resonated in his mind, as if proclaiming the birth of some existence!

...

Who knew how much time had passed? Zhang Jing's consciousness gradually regained clarity. He carefully sensed the first Natal World, which was currently in a state of opening and evolution. His attention lingered for a long time on the cosmic embryo incubating within it. A hint of understanding flashed in his eyes.

"It will still take three hundred years to complete its evolution? That's normal."

Zhang Jing looked at the jade talisman in his Niwan Palace. In the ethereal realm, he suddenly had a feeling: the universal experience points, formed from the power of origin, seemed to be able to accelerate the formation of the Natal World.

Zhang Jing was instantly tempted. However, when he saw that he only had just over three hundred million universal experience points remaining:

[Universal: 335,250,000]

His gaze instantly dimmed. He reluctantly gave up on the idea. Anyway, he had nothing pressing to do at the moment, so he might as well let the Natal World slowly evolve. There was no need to consume the extremely precious universal experience points.

Thinking this, Zhang Jing once again shifted his attention to the jade talisman. All his current skills immediately came into view.

…

…

…

"Azure Cloud Immortal, is that the name of the Innate Divine Being incubating within the first Natal World? It really is related to the Innate Divine Item I invested." Zhang Jing's gaze sharpened.

He couldn't help but think of the other item he still possessed that could be considered an Innate Divine Item: the Innate Blood Gold Essence that his teacher, Seven Desires Divine Monarch, had given him previously. If that item were used as the root for the evolution of the second Natal World, what kind of minor world would it open up then? An Innate Blood Sea World? The being nurtured within that would surely be an Innate Divine Being of the blood, sin, and defilement path.

But... Zhang Jing shook his head slightly. The Innate Blood Gold Essence definitely couldn't be used, as it was crucial for cultivating the Supreme Red Karma Immortal-Slaying Demonic Blade.

"Sigh, troublesome, troublesome!" The thought of needing thirty-six Innate Divine Items made his head ache immensely.

…

Meanwhile, in the Bronze Immortal Hall of the Daoist Ancestral Court.

"In five hundred years, disciples from our human race's great Immortal Dao lineages can descend into the Great Azure World to participate in this struggle for the Child of Fortune. At that time, the royal families of the Myriad Spirits Faction of the Heavens, as well as various Dao lineages from the Jianmu World and the Nine Netherworld, will also have juniors below the Heavenly Immortal Realm descend into it."

"It will be interesting to see which side can gain the upper hand in this fortune struggle."

"In its desperate straits, the Heavenly Dao of the Great Azure World will certainly not stint on resources for one last gamble. Origin Crystals, various Innate Divine Items, and even Innate Magical Treasures will appear one after another."

"By Master's decree!"

"The number of our Dao Sect disciples whose True Spirits will descend into the Great Azure World this time will be a full complement. Among them, there are quotas for the Dao Integration Realm, Dharma Aspect Realm, and Golden Core Realm, respectively..."

A grand Daoist chant echoed within the Immortal Hall. As he spoke, True Monarch Yuanming's eyes flashed with a hint of surprise, as if he had sensed something.

"It's not the Innate Primordial Immortal Light, but an apparently even grander divine ability? What exactly did that little fellow do?" He thought with a touch of curiosity. A hint of praise rose in his heart.

Heavens, Divine Beings... that's quite interesting. The World Derivation Path truly holds infinite possibilities. He's only in the Golden Core Realm, yet that little fellow already shows signs of forging his own path, and with limitless potential.

Perhaps, this youngest disciple of his truly has a hope of attaining the Immortal Golden Immortal Dao Fruit!
