# Chapter 136: Earth Cauldron

Half an hour passed, with Jinguang and Crane Immortal looking utterly dejected.

The protective formation outside the cave required the spiritual sense of a Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivator to suppress. The two of them, along with Zhou Qing, used their spiritual senses to suppress the formation's energy flow. However, even though the formation's operation became sluggish, their combined attacks still failed to break it.

Jinguang said, "At this rate, it might take ten days to half a month to break the formation. Moreover, using too much force might trigger other changes."

With Zhou Qing present and their numbers, even if the Emerald-eyed Water Beast returned, they could still handle it. However, if the beast returned with the formation's power, the group would likely be overwhelmed. Additionally, the beast's abilities were most potent in deep water.

Despite Jinguang's usual composure, he was now visibly agitated.

Zhou Qing spoke softly, "Let me try alone."

The group was startled. They had just attacked together, with Zhou Qing participating, yet the formation remained intact. Could Zhou Qing really break it alone now?

"Has Fellow Daoist Qinglingzi discovered something?"

Zhou Qing nodded slightly. "I've gained some insights from our earlier attempts. If I break the formation, I'd like to choose two treasures first upon entering. How does that sound?"

Jinguang laughed heartily. "If you succeed, that's only fair. However, if any items are useless for your Golden Core formation but beneficial for ours, I hope you'll consider exchanging them with me."

Zhou Qing agreed. The cave's information came from Jinguang, so Zhou Qing couldn't monopolize everything. Moreover, he sensed an indescribable danger lurking, and they would need everyone's cooperation inside.

Alone, he approached the Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Formation. Opening his Truth-Seeking Eye, his Green Bamboo Sword flew out from his body, circling him once before igniting with Qingyang Spiritual Fire and darting into the formation.

To the others, the formation seemed unchanged. They thought Zhou Qing had failed.

But after a while, the formation erupted with multicolored light pillars and thunderous roars. The Green Bamboo Sword slithered out like a small snake.

"Everyone, retreat!" Zhou Qing commanded.

Sensing the danger, the group swiftly retreated before he finished speaking.

After a long while, the thunderous roars outside the cave finally ceased. They had retreated dozens of miles away.

Zhou Qing observed for a moment. "We can go back now."

Returning, they saw the cave entrance devastated. If not for being thousands of feet underwater, the destruction would have been unimaginable.

The cave bore no name. With the formation destroyed, the entrance narrowed to a single-person passage. No one asked Zhou Qing how he broke the formation—such secrets were taboo.

In truth, Zhou Qing had used the Green Bamboo Sword and Qingyang Spiritual Fire to trigger the Eight Trigrams Immortal Thunder Formation's full power. Without his third-level Truth-Seeking Eye, spiritual sense surpassing ordinary Foundation Establishment Perfection cultivators, and the earlier suppression by Jinguang and Crane Immortal, he wouldn't have noticed the formation's intricacies, let alone triggered it.

He memorized many details to share with Yuan Mingyue later. From his experience, this formation was incomplete but more than sufficient against Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Cautiously, they entered the narrow passage, which soon widened. The walls were sturdy, and to avoid complications, they refrained from damaging them.

However, new ancient restrictions soon appeared. Zhou Qing's Truth-Seeking Eye could detect them, but these restrictions followed ancient principles vastly different from modern ones in the Jingyang Dao Domain.

Jinguang was prepared, and Crane Immortal had studied ancient restrictions. Zhou Qing learned that Jinguang knew many ancient caves used such restrictions, hence his readiness.

In contrast, Zhou Qing's Water Mansion and parts of the Divine Water Palace he'd explored followed more contemporary designs, though the latter held many mysteries.

Ancient and modern methods differed primarily in approach. Even if Patriarch Tianxuan had lived in ancient times, he'd have been unmatched among Golden Core cultivators.

Modern methods prevailed because they suited most cultivators better. Ancient methods faded either due to obsolescence or lack of suitable inheritors.

Jinguang and Crane Immortal were adept at breaking ancient restrictions, but without Zhou Qing's Truth-Seeking Eye and superior spiritual sense, they missed some hidden ones. Thanks to Zhou Qing's warnings, they avoided traps.

Fusong and Zhang Jingxiu, as body cultivators, were unskilled in such matters. They accompanied Zhou Qing mainly for experience and as backup.

---

The cave was small, putting Qi cultivators at a natural disadvantage against body cultivators. Even well-intentioned individuals might succumb to greed given the opportunity.

Zhou Qing said, "I understand. Thank you for your concern."

On the way, Zhou Qing refrained from using his Soul Bewitchment Art on the honest Shang Zijian. A rare figure in the Jingyang Dao Domain, Shang Zijian was known for his sincerity and mild temper, making him a trusted mediator in Tianxuan City.

His story of becoming Tianxuan Patriarch's disciple was legendary. As a mere Qi Refinement fourth-level rogue cultivator, he had carried the ashes of Tianxuan's dying disciple across ten thousand miles of peril to Tianxuan City, returning the disciple's storage pouch intact—a fortune that could have elevated him to Foundation Establishment.

When Tianxuan Patriarch asked why he hadn't used the resources to strengthen himself first, Shang Zijian sheepishly replied, "I forgot I could do that." Moved, Tianxuan took him as a disciple.

Zhou Qing had let Fusong take the dull bronze bell from the cave, suspecting it held special powers. Jinguang and Crane Immortal showed no interest, focused solely on Golden Core formation. Ancient artifacts without known uses were worthless to them.

Zhou Qing's only regret was not finding a sword technique. Dismissing such thoughts, he began refining Geng Metal. Though painful, the process strengthened his Lung Metal Thunder and his Green Bamboo Sword.

Half a month later, Fusong summoned Zhou Qing to Tianxuan City with an invitation from Tianxuan Patriarch.

Meeting the unkempt, broad-shouldered patriarch, Zhou Qing handed over the Life-Severing Blade without hesitation. Tianxuan melted it into a white liquid, presenting it as premium material for upgrading Zhou Qing's natal treasure.

When Zhou Qing requested Geng Metal, Tianxuan explained it had been exhausted during the beast tide but promised future notifications. Zhou Qing then sought cultivation advice, but Tianxuan declined, emphasizing self-reliance in the Dao.

Shang Zijian later clarified Tianxuan was developing a supreme technique and had made time despite his busy schedule. Zhou Qing assured him of his support in the next beast tide, though Shang Zijian hoped more for his Golden Core breakthrough.
