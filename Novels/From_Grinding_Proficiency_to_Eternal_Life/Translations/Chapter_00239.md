# Chapter 239: Sword Pavilion Walker

The chains driven by blood sacrifice moved faster than the naked eye could follow.

Pei Yan barely managed to cross his sword to block. The moment the Bamboo Sword collided with the chain, the frost patterns on the blade shattered like brittle porcelain, flaking away piece by piece.

Xu Yunfan saw the first flicker of terror in the Sword Pavilion Walker’s eyes. The end of the chain wasn't attached to an iron ring, but to ninety Sword Pavilion identification plaques!

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, suddenly understanding. No wonder this Sword Pavilion Walker was so enraged.

Another ninety Sword Pavilion disciples had been lost.

*Crack!*

The Bamboo Sword let out a mournful hum. Though a divine weapon, it was now covered in cracks, on the verge of shattering completely.

The sound of Pei Yan’s sternum caving in and the chain shattering erupted simultaneously. Blood mixed with ice shards hadn't even hit the ground before it was whipped into a mist by the follow-up strike of the python’s tail.

This arrogant Sword Pavilion Walker flew backward like a broken paper kite, smashing through seven crimson sword peaks along the way. By the time he embedded himself into the obsidian wall three miles away, he was nothing more than a blood-soaked gourd.

Xu Yunfan was shaken.

He’s still alive?!

He didn't expect that Pei Yan, having reached the Muscle Refining Realm within this small world secret realm, could withstand such a tail strike without exploding.

He must be wearing top-tier defensive armor!

And the sword qi unleashed by the Bamboo Sword was also terrifying, at least equivalent to the full-force strike of an ordinary Blood Transformation Realm expert.

Unfortunately, he only had the strength for one sword strike.

Xu Yunfan glanced at him and stopped paying attention, merely pondering the armor on Pei Yan. Even for him, taking the python’s tail strike head-on would be fatal without the Dragon Scale Armor to dissipate most of the force.

Qi Hu’s Adam's apple bobbed, his vertically slit pupils trembling violently.

“Let’s go!”

Watching Xu Yunfan rush without hesitation toward the wall where Pei Yan was embedded.

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate for a moment. He stomped his foot, and the ground shattered. Stones and dirt shot out like bullets.

Qi Hu, seeing this, his expression shifting, finally gritted his teeth and followed closely.

It was too late to run now. If they hadn't encountered Pei Yan, he might still have had other ideas. But meeting Pei Yan again meant there was no way out.

To leave this small world secret realm, they had to rely on true disciples like Pei Yan from top sects.

“Rise!”

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer shattered the rock layer in response. Using his shoulder as a lever, Xu Yunfan smashed through the obsidian wall and immediately saw Pei Yan lying amidst the rubble.

Pei Yan, wedged in the crevice, had his chest armor twisted into a bizarre shape. His clothes were shredded into strips. The surface of his cracked inner armor floated with sapphire light spots resembling the Big Dipper, and the armor itself was still humming.

“The Sword Pavilion has quite a few life-saving methods.”

Xu Yunfan’s fingers clamped onto Pei Yan’s shoulder armor, and the Red Python Mountain-Crushing Strength climbed up his arm bone by bone.

As the force erupted, the ice crystals that the inner armor had spontaneously spread over the wall exploded into dust.

Confirming that Pei Yan still had a breath left, Xu Yunfan grabbed his shoulder and dragged him out of the crevice.

He glanced at Qi Hu, who had just rushed over, stomped his foot, and quickly moved away from the area.

Qi Hu didn't hesitate and followed closely.

After running frantically for three hours, Xu Yunfan suddenly stopped. An endless abyss lay ahead.

“This... is the end of this small world.”

Heavy panting came from behind. Qi Hu took a long breath before speaking.

Xu Yunfan looked at it quietly for a long time before withdrawing his gaze.

He casually found a nearby canyon and tossed Pei Yan onto the ground.

Qi Hu tensed up and hurriedly stepped forward to check. He couldn't help but mutter, “Xu... Xu brother, be... be careful. If Pei Yan really dies, our hope of getting out is slim.”

Xu Yunfan didn't care and said casually, “Don't worry, he won't die. The python tail smashed him through seven sword peaks, and he didn't die. A little toss like this won't kill him... If he really dies, then it’s just his bad luck.”

Qi Hu: “...”

To be called a Sword Pavilion Walker, even if he is only in the Muscle Refining Realm, the ease with which he just unleashed his strength shows he has reached an extremely deep level in this realm.

He has likely reached the point where every inch of his flesh and blood contains lingering strength.

Qi Hu looked complexly at Xu Yunfan, seeing the undisguised desire in his eyes, and naturally knew what he was planning.

Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't waste his Spirit Ginseng to heal Pei Yan. As a Sword Pavilion Walker, Pei Yan definitely had plenty of life-saving methods.

Half a day later, when the moon was high in the sky, the comatose Pei Yan coughed violently and slowly opened his eyes. The flickering flame of a bonfire came into view.

The dancing shadows of the bonfire cast three figures on the rock wall. The crackling of burning pine resin woke the sleeping night owls.

The moment Pei Yan opened his eyes, his fingers were already pressing the mechanism on his waist’s frost-patterned sword sheath, but his heart sank. His Bamboo Sword was gone. Only when he saw the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer hanging upside down behind Xu Yunfan did his tense shoulder blades slowly sink back into the shadows.

As his gaze swept around, he saw two figures sitting cross-legged by the fire.

“Awake?”

Xu Yunfan looked up and saw Pei Yan’s gaze. A hint of a smile played on his lips.

“Truly a Sword Pavilion Walker...”

Xu Yunfan poked the fire with a stick. Several wild game were roasting by the bonfire, the branches crackling under the flames and sparks jumping continuously.

“Even after such a severe injury, you can still grip your sword sheath.”

Pei Yan’s pupils contracted slightly.

He had indeed made a move the moment he woke up. Having Xu Yunfan point it out made him a bit embarrassed.

Just as Pei Yan was about to answer, his eyes moved slightly. Qi Hu, who was adding firewood, paused, the demonic green scales on his neck rippling.

This slight tremor made Pei Yan’s sword-like brows frown. He naturally noticed the anomaly on Qi Hu.

“Qi Hu was accidentally tainted by demonic qi. He has regained his sanity now,” Xu Yunfan explained casually. He then saw a bitter smile appear on Qi Hu’s face at the right moment.

“Brother Pei, please excuse the sight.”

Pei Yan shook his head slowly and didn't speak immediately. He silently guided the strength within his body to slowly crawl, repairing himself.

Though he was saved, how could a sharp-witted person like him not understand that these two were uninvited guests.

At this time, Xu Yunfan’s face held a hint of admiration.

“Brother Pei’s Nineteen Forms of Frost-Vanquishing is indeed faster than the恶蛟’s (Evil Python’s) tail whip by three points. If not for running out of strength at the end, you might have actually beheaded that evil python.”

Pei Yan stared at the dancing firelight and suddenly began to cough violently.

Black blood spat from his mouth onto the side of the bonfire, turning a few sparks into green smoke.

Xu Yunfan’s eyes flashed. He naturally knew that Pei Yan had likely been poisoned by the evil python.

The evil python’s strength was terrifying, beyond imagination. A single drop of its venom could poison a city of people. But under the protection of the divine armor belonging to Pei Yan’s inner armor, it was greatly delayed.

When Pei Yan looked up again, his gaze fell on Qi Hu’s vertical pupils. He slowly said, “Green scales choking the throat, blood煞 piercing the eyes, green skin and ox horns... It reminds me of a bull-headed great demon recorded in the Sword Pavilion’s library.”
