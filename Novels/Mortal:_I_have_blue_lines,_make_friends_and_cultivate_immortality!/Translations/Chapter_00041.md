# Chapter 41: The Mysterious Five Elements Seal! (2/3)

Moreover, this was merely the foundation. Even if you possessed the Five Spiritual Roots, without abundant resources, you could only reach the Foundation Establishment stage at most by cultivating the Mysterious Five Elements Art—and that was only possible in the Spirit Realm.  

In the Human Realm, with its sparse spiritual energy, you likely wouldn't even break through to the fourth level of Qi Refinement.  

Originally, cultivating with Five Spiritual Roots was already slow, but this method required simultaneously cultivating five different techniques. Many couldn't even pass this first hurdle.  

Given the immense resources required and the numerous prerequisites, the benefits of successfully cultivating the Mysterious Five Elements Art were unimaginable.  

Beyond the enhancements to escape techniques and spells provided by the five elemental bodies—Metal, Wood, Water, Fire, and Earth—the sheer volume and quality of your spiritual power and true essence would far surpass that of other cultivators.  

Not just surpass—utterly dominate.  

If we take an average cultivator as the baseline:  

At the same cultivation stage, during Qi Refinement—before you could even cultivate the elemental bodies—your spiritual power would be five times that of an ordinary cultivator.  

Thus, in Qi Refinement:  
1 Lin Yun = 5 average cultivators = 5 Han Lis.  

Upon reaching Foundation Establishment, the increase in your spiritual power and true essence wouldn’t be as dramatic as others'.  

Therefore, after advancing to Foundation Establishment:  
Your spiritual power and true essence would only be twice that of an average cultivator.  

Before cultivating the first elemental body in Foundation Establishment:  
1 Lin Yun = 2 average cultivators.  

This ratio would persist until you completed the cultivation of your first elemental body.  

Once the first elemental body was fully cultivated, your spiritual power and true essence would quadruple that of an average cultivator.  

First elemental body:  
1 Lin Yun = 4 average cultivators.  

Second elemental body:  
1 Lin Yun = 8 average cultivators.  

Third elemental body:  
1 Lin Yun = 16 average cultivators.  

Fourth elemental body:  
1 Lin Yun = 32 average cultivators.  

Fifth elemental body:  
1 Lin Yun = 64 average cultivators.  

This was the terrifying aspect of the Mysterious Five Elements Art. Once Lin Yun fully cultivated all five elemental bodies, his spiritual power and true essence would be **64 times** that of an ordinary cultivator!  

To put it into perspective: even Han Li, who cultivated the Three Revolutions Profound Art and the top-tier Azure Essence Sword Art, only possessed spiritual power three to five times that of an average cultivator.  

Lin Yun would have **64 times**!  

Taking the midpoint (four times):  
1 Han Li (after cultivating Azure Essence Sword Art) = 4 average cultivators.  

Thus, converting:  
1 Lin Yun = 16 Han Lis.  

Beyond the sheer quantity and quality of spiritual power, the divine abilities embedded within the Mysterious Five Elements Art were also extraordinary.

### Divine Abilities of the Mysterious Five Elements Art  

1. **The Annihilating Immortal Hand of the Five Elements**—a devastating attack.  
2. **Five-Colored Cloud**—allowing one to traverse the heavens and earth.  
3. **Immortal-Binding Chains of the Five Elements**—a restraining technique that seals an enemy’s spiritual power and true essence.  
4. **Five Elements Protective Barrier**—a 360-degree, instant-cast shield with extreme resistance to elemental spells.  
5. **Divine Light Sword of the Five Elements**—a piercing attack combining power and speed, capable of breaking through defensive barriers.  

The **Annihilating Immortal Hand** could be used once all five basic techniques reached perfection (Qi Refinement completion), though its power scaled with the cultivation of the elemental bodies.  

The **Five-Colored Cloud**, **Immortal-Binding Chains**, and **Five Elements Protective Barrier** could only be used after cultivating the corresponding elemental bodies. Similarly, the associated escape techniques and spell enhancements were tied to the elemental bodies—for example, the Fire Body could use the **Fire Cloud**, **Fire-Binding Chains**, and **Fire Protective Barrier**.  

The **Divine Light Sword**, however, required all five elemental bodies to reach a certain level before it could be used.  

Lin Yun stared at the **Annihilating Immortal Hand**, feeling like he had heard of it before.  

If he remembered correctly, the Great Immortal Hu from the Tianlan Grasslands had a technique called the **Capturing Immortal Hand of the Five Elements**, which had severely injured Han Li. At the time, Han Li (Mid-Nascent Soul) was nearly killed by this attack from the Late-Nascent Soul Great Immortal Hu.  

The names were only one character apart. Was there a connection between the two?  

Another question arose in Lin Yun’s mind:  

**Could he cultivate other techniques alongside the Mysterious Five Elements Art?**  

Upon reviewing the entire manual, he noticed a key difference—this art focused less on cultivation stages and more on the elemental bodies.  

Upon closer inspection, the so-called "elemental bodies" seemed akin to artificially created acquired spiritual physiques.  

If he already possessed such a physique, making him highly attuned to a specific element, wouldn’t cultivating a corresponding elemental technique be effortless?  

If the creator of the Mysterious Five Elements Art heard this idea, he’d probably cough up blood in frustration. He had never considered or attempted this because the resources required for cultivating the five elemental bodies were already astronomical, leaving no time for other techniques.  

Of course, the five elemental bodies had another drawback beyond slow cultivation and high resource consumption:  

**They didn’t enhance physical strength.**  

Additionally, the Mysterious Five Elements Art included methods for refining two types of treasures.  

---  

### The Mysterious Five Elements Seal  

The first was called the **Mysterious Five Elements Seal**.  

Lin Yun’s lips twitched at the name. The creator of this technique was undoubtedly an edgelord—daring to name his treasure "Mysterious Heaven," knowing full well the significance of those words in the Spirit Realm.  

Upon closer inspection, Lin Yun found that the **Mysterious Five Elements Seal** was indeed extraordinary.  

And it wasn’t something that could be called "Mysterious" just by refining it.  

The method for crafting this treasure was derived from a fragment of a **Golden Jade Book Page**, not the creator’s own invention. He had merely simplified it so ordinary cultivators could refine it.  

Thus, the **Mysterious Five Elements Seal** had a unique advantage: **high adaptability**. As long as suitable materials were obtained, the treasure could be continuously refined.  

Of course, it wasn’t that simple.  

Refining the seal required materials of all five elements. Any additional materials used for upgrades also had to maintain a balance of the five elements.  

If the balance was disrupted, the seal would explode!  

Lin Yun examined the most basic version of the seal and nearly laughed.  

He was certain that no one else in the Human Realm could refine it—only he had the qualifications.  

Because the foundational materials for the most basic **Five Elements Seal** (the "Mysterious" title could be dropped at this stage) were **five top-grade elemental spirit stones**—one for each element.  

These five spirit stones formed the core of the seal’s **mutual generation and restraint cycle**, allowing further refinement with other elemental materials.  

One of the seal’s functions was to **store and replenish spiritual power and true essence**, acting as a reserve in critical moments.  

To Lin Yun, this seemed redundant—after cultivating the Mysterious Five Elements Art, running out of spiritual power would be rare.  

Another function was to **act as a medium for manipulating ambient spiritual energy**. When suspended above the user’s head, it could draw in surrounding spiritual energy, mimicking the ability of **Nascent Soul cultivators to command heaven and earth’s power**.  

It could **amplify spells and treasures’ power!**  

As a seal-type treasure, it naturally possessed immense destructive force.  

If **materials from five different single-element spirit beasts** were incorporated during refinement, the seal could **manifest their forms and command them in battle**.  

The wielder could also **channel the beasts’ innate abilities through the seal**.  

This sparked another thought in Lin Yun’s mind:  

**"If spirit beast materials work, what about cultivators’ Nascent Souls or souls?"**  

The manual didn’t address this—perhaps the creator was too righteous to consider or test such a method.  

But if spirit beasts worked, surely cultivators’ souls would too... right?  

**"Cultivate hard, or become a brother in my Five Elements Seal!"**  

**"Fellow Daoist, stay a while—care to join me in the seal for eternal life?"**  

However, since spirit beast materials had to be single-element, would cultivators need to be **Heavenly Spiritual Root holders**?  

Beyond this, the seal could also unleash **Five-Colored Spirit Light attacks**, similar to those of the Feiling Clan’s Peacock Tribe, with additional mysteries unlocked as its grade improved.  

But all of this remained theoretical.  

The creator himself had never refined the **Mysterious Five Elements Seal**—he had deduced the method from a fragment of a Golden Jade Book’s outer page but died to heavenly tribulation before he could attempt it.  

In fact, he died **because** he was too focused on simplifying the seal’s refinement method, neglecting his cultivation progress.  

Instead, he had refined the second treasure mentioned in the manual:  

**The Five Elements Immortal Needles!**  

These could be used with a divine ability called **"Five Elements Annihilation Needles."**  

At this point, Lin Yun guessed the origin of the Mysterious Five Elements Art.  

Its earliest version likely belonged to the **Five Elements True Monarch**—a legendary Late-Soul Formation cultivator from ancient times, renowned among humans and demons, whom Han Li had encountered at the Tianyuan City auction.  

But the original owner of this body hadn’t obtained the complete technique—or perhaps the Five Elements True Monarch’s version was simply too difficult—so he had modified it.  

Of course, this was just Lin Yun’s speculation.  

Perhaps the Five Elements True Monarch and this technique’s creator had drawn from the same source—or maybe the True Monarch’s version was derived from the Mysterious Five Elements Art.  

Lin Yun didn’t care about the technique’s origins.  

Only one question remained:  

**Should he cultivate it or not?**
