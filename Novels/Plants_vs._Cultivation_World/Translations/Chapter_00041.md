# Chapter 41: The Inner Sect Senior Sister's Request

Growing Spirit Jade Rice only required casting the Minor Cloud Rain Technique once daily. However, cultivating Water Spirit Rice was entirely different—it demanded continuous application of the technique to keep the spiritual fields perpetually submerged.

To put it bluntly, the cultivation requirements for first-grade high-tier Water Spirit Rice far surpassed those of Spirit Jade Rice. Without mastering the Minor Cloud Rain Technique to an advanced level, achieving a decent yield would be nearly impossible.

Yet Gu Mo ultimately chose to cultivate Water Spirit Rice for a simple reason: he was on the verge of breaking through to the advanced stage of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique. Having fully comprehended the technique's principles, Gu Mo faced no bottlenecks—only the need to accumulate proficiency.

Among the five specialized farming spells, the Minor Cloud Rain Technique was currently his most practiced, given its daily use. Moreover, having reached the second level of Qi Refinement and possessing a perfected Cleansing Technique, Gu Mo's spiritual energy reserves were triple that of his peers—far surpassing his capabilities at the first level of Qi Refinement.

At the first level, three to five castings of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique would deplete his energy. Now, he could effortlessly perform over a dozen castings. Even without reaching the advanced stage of the technique, his current reserves met the minimum requirements for cultivating Water Spirit Rice.

Having outlined the challenges, it was only natural to highlight the benefits of Water Spirit Rice—why Gu Mo had chosen it over other first-grade mid-to-high-tier spiritual plants.

Beyond meeting the cultivation requirements, Gu Mo was drawn to its high-tier quality and its unique ability to nourish meridians and strengthen the physique. While Spirit Jade Rice was a neutral spiritual grain, Water Spirit Rice, as its name suggested, contained water-attribute spiritual energy.

This made it particularly effective for cultivators practicing water-attribute techniques. Unlike medicinal pills, which had consumption limits, Water Spirit Rice could be consumed liberally, allowing practitioners of water-attribute techniques to surpass their peers in cultivation speed.

Even for those not specializing in water-attribute techniques, the rice's high-tier quality ensured abundant spiritual energy. Additionally, its meridian-nourishing properties could heal minor injuries sustained during cultivation. Successfully cultivating Water Spirit Rice would yield rewards far beyond those of Spirit Jade Rice.

However, a minor hiccup occurred when Gu Mo went to collect the rice seeds. As a mere outer sect disciple who had joined the Spiritual Plant Hall just over a year ago, his request for first-grade high-tier Water Spirit Rice seeds gave the distribution manager pause.

High-quality seeds were precious. Even with Gu Mo's reputation as a top Spirit Jade Rice producer, the two crops were in entirely different leagues. Handing over Water Spirit Rice seeds only for him to fail would mean wasting valuable resources.

While losses of mid-to-low-tier seeds were tolerable, Water Spirit Rice was a high-tier plant with significant value. The manager sent a message to Zhao Qiancheng, the hall's deacon, for guidance.

Upon receiving the message, Zhao was startled—barely a year in, while other outer sect disciples were still doing menial tasks, Gu Mo was already attempting to cultivate high-tier Water Spirit Rice. Only a handful of veteran farmers in the hall, all with advanced mastery of the Minor Cloud Rain Technique, could manage it.

"Could it be...?" Zhao mused, recalling Gu Mo's exceptional comprehension skills. 

With that thought, Zhao approved the request, secretly hopeful. If Gu Mo succeeded, he might consider granting him the full privileges of an inner sect disciple. Veteran farmers with specialized skills, despite lacking the spiritual roots for formal inner sect status, often enjoyed equal or better treatment.

The manager's consultation with Zhao hadn't escaped Gu Mo's notice, but he was prepared. In farming, he aimed to showcase his talents to gain benefits, whereas in cultivation, he preferred to remain low-key. Excelling as a farmer wouldn't draw undue attention, but rapid progress with inferior spiritual roots would inevitably raise eyebrows—after all, while not everyone aspired to farm, every cultivator craved faster advancement.

Returning to his fields with the seeds, Gu Mo spotted a petite figure with striking red-and-black hair—the same young woman he'd seen accompanying Deacon Zhao. 

What was she doing here? They had no prior interactions.

"Greetings, Senior Sister," Gu Mo bowed. Despite her apparent youth and only recently entering Qi Refinement, her inner sect robes demanded respect.

"My name is Yuan Niya," she introduced herself with a smile, devoid of any inner sect arrogance—after all, she was here to ask a favor. 

"May I ask why Senior Sister seeks me out?" Gu Mo inquired politely, puzzled by her visit.

"I heard you've mastered the Cleansing Technique to perfection," Yuan Niya said.

"Indeed," Gu Mo nodded. This wasn't a secret within the Spiritual Plant Hall.

"I'd like to ask you to perform a meridian cleansing for me," she stated earnestly. Upon learning of Gu Mo's perfected technique from Zhao Qiancheng, she'd conceived this plan—if she couldn't master the technique herself, she'd enlist someone who had.

"Ah?" Gu Mo was taken aback. While his mastery of the Cleansing Technique was known, no one had approached him for such a request in over a year.
