# Chapter 55: The True Monarchs' Council

"Disciple, come out for a moment."

Just as Yang Ji was about to continue his cultivation, Sword Yuanzi's voice suddenly reached his ears.

Yang Ji immediately ceased his cultivation and exited his secret cultivation chamber.

Seeing Sword Yuanzi's smiling face, he roughly understood why his master had called him out.

"Disciple, I never expected you to comprehend the True Adamant Divine Art and break through to the Foundation Establishment realm so quickly. You truly have given your master a pleasant surprise." Sword Yuanzi scrutinized him from head to toe, and the more he looked, the deeper the satisfaction in his eyes grew.

"This disciple was fortunate enough to comprehend it," Yang Ji bowed slightly, smiling.

"There's no need to be modest. Come, your master will take you somewhere to meet the sect's high-ranking members." Sword Yuanzi grabbed Yang Ji, transformed into a streak of light, and swiftly flew out of the main hall, arriving at an uninhabited mountain peak in an instant.

At the summit of the mountain peak stood a grand hall, named the Deliberation Hall.

To the side of the hall hung an ancient, rustic yellow bell.

Sword Yuanzi condensed spiritual energy into a hammer and struck the bell three times in succession.

*Dong! Dong! Dong!*

The yellow bell immediately emitted a melodious and profound sound, not loud, but extremely penetrating, rapidly spreading throughout the entire Azure Wave Sect.

For a moment, on various mountain peaks, nine individuals were the first to perceive the bell's sound. They all opened their eyes from their meditative states.

"The Yellow Bell rings thrice. This is the Council Bell. What could have happened?"

Amidst their confusion, everyone rose and walked out of their cultivation grounds.

Before long, streaks of light, accompanied by the rush of wind, converged into the Deliberation Hall.

Seeing Sword Yuanzi already waiting there, they immediately asked, "Junior Martial Brother Sword Yuan, did you initiate this council meeting?"

"Indeed, Senior Martial Brothers, please take your seats!" Sword Yuanzi smiled faintly, gesturing with his hand.

Yang Ji glanced around and saw that all eight of the arriving individuals were elderly men. Their temperaments varied; some were cold and stern, others gentle and scholarly, or benevolent and kind. But without exception, the aura they exuded was exceptionally powerful.

Yang Ji had experienced this kind of aura from True Monarch Crimson Flame, True Monarch Southern Kui, and others, and the impression was particularly deep. He knew that the eight individuals present were undoubtedly Nascent Soul True Monarchs.

Before he could reflect much further, circles of spiritual light and auspicious mist suddenly emanated within the Deliberation Hall, making it appear supremely sacred.

Unbeknownst to him, a plump old man clad in white robes was already seated cross-legged at the head of the hall. His white beard reached his knees, his silver hair cascaded over his shoulders, and with the face of a child amidst the white hair of an elder, he exuded an ethereal quality. Spiritual light flowed from his entire body, giving off a strong immortal charm and bearing.

Although this person had restrained his aura, judging by the immortal bearing he revealed, no one would doubt his power.

In Yang Ji's perception, this was clearly a Soul Transformation Supreme.

"Disciple, let me introduce you. The one at the head is your Grandmaster White-Brow."

"To your left, below the main seat, are Senior Martial Uncles Guanxiao, Yunguang, Yong'en, and Changye. To your right are Senior Martial Uncles Hongming, Qinghe, Mingcheng, and Shengyu," Sword Yuanzi said with a smile.

"Greetings, Grandmaster! Greetings, Senior Martial Uncles!" Yang Ji immediately bowed respectfully.

"And your Junior Martial Uncle Linggu!" Suddenly, a streak of light darted in. It was precisely True Monarch Linggu, who had received Sword Yuanzi's message and rushed over.

"Junior Martial Uncle!" Yang Ji also bowed.

"You must be Little Ji, Sword Yuan's new disciple," White-Brow smiled kindly, speaking slowly. His voice naturally carried a spiritual charm; it was deep and resonant but not jarring, appearing grand and majestic, radiating righteousness and power.

"This disciple is indeed Yang Ji!" Yang Ji bowed.

"Sword Yuan, did you ring the Yellow Bell today for your disciple?" Supreme White-Brow asked again.

"Reporting to Supreme, it is precisely for my disciple," Sword Yuanzi replied.

Upon hearing this, the assembled Nascent Soul True Monarchs all looked towards Yang Ji.

The second person in the Azure Wave Sect to comprehend a Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Projection, whose comprehension was extraordinary—everyone had heard of him. Moreover, his treatment as a quasi-Nascent Soul True Monarch had been approved by all of them.

In their eyes, Yang Ji was merely a genius who had displayed unusual comprehension in Sword Dao. However, his performance in other aspects was still unknown, unlike Li Changxiao, whose extraordinary comprehension was all-encompassing.

Although they had heard of this genius, the level of importance they placed on him was far less than half of what they placed on Li Changxiao.

In fact, more or less, a trace of doubt lingered in their hearts.

The thought had crossed their minds that perhaps he had merely been lucky to comprehend the Severing Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Projection. After learning that he possessed only inferior innate talent, this doubt had not dissipated.

After all, in their eyes, innate talent was generally directly proportional to comprehension; it was impossible for someone with merely inferior innate talent to possess extraordinary comprehension.

Comprehending the Severing Sword Dao might have simply been a sudden flash of insight.

True Monarch Guanxiao glanced at Yang Ji, then spoke directly, "Junior Martial Brother Sword Yuan, are you initiating this council meeting again to secure cultivation resources for Junior Martial Nephew Yang?"

"Precisely!" Sword Yuanzi smiled. "I wish to discuss with the Supreme and all Senior and Junior Martial Brothers about securing a Spirit Cleansing Pill for my disciple."

"A Spirit Cleansing Pill? This is a sacred pill that can improve innate talent. Changxiao used one, leaving two. Many excellent disciples covet these two, and they cannot be used indiscriminately," True Monarch Hongming said indifferently, his words implying refusal.

True Monarch Yong'en frowned even more, stating bluntly, "Junior Martial Nephew Yang is indeed outstanding, capable of comprehending half a stance of the Severing Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Projection. He should be valued, and we have granted him the treatment of a quasi-Nascent Soul True Monarch. However, this Spirit Cleansing Pill might be beyond that level of treatment. Based solely on half a stance of the Severing Sword Dao comprehended from the Sword Dao Projection, I fear it is not enough."

True Monarch Yunguang also chimed in, "Let's speak plainly, as one family. I'm always direct. I believe this junior martial nephew is not qualified to receive a Spirit Cleansing Pill."

"Indeed, comprehending only half a stance of the Severing Sword Dao from the Sword Dao Projection is not enough for Junior Martial Nephew to obtain a Spirit Cleansing Pill. After all, the sect only has two left, and many disciples with superior innate talent are eyeing them. If the allocation is unfair, I fear resentment might arise among the disciples," True Monarch Qinghe said slowly.

"Everyone, calm down first. Let's hear what Sword Yuan has to say. We've known each other for hundreds of years; you should know he's not an unreasonable person. Since he brought Little Ji here and is striving for a Spirit Cleansing Pill, could it be that Little Ji has displayed some other talent?" Supreme White-Brow said with a gentle smile.

Seeing Sword Yuanzi with a faint smile on his face, not speaking up to argue, everyone quieted down amidst their confusion, exchanging glances.

Sword Yuanzi saw that everyone had ceased speaking, then smiled and said, "Reporting to Supreme, my disciple has indeed displayed talent in other aspects of comprehension."

"Oh? Tell us," Supreme White-Brow became interested. The stronger the talent of his disciples, the more gratified he naturally felt.

"Disciple, show your spiritual energy to the Supreme and your Senior Martial Uncles," Sword Yuanzi said with a smile.

Yang Ji nodded and immediately channeled a wisp of spiritual energy—a wisp of faint aquamarine spiritual energy.

The moment it appeared, it exuded a sense of sharpness.

"This is sword qi?" True Monarch Mingcheng was startled, then shook his head, "No, this is True Adamant Spiritual Energy?"
