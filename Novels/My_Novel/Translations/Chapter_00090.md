# Chapter 90: The Poisoned Arrow and the Fox, Framing and Shifting Blame

Peng the Fox was forced back three steps in succession. On the fourth step, he stomped his foot down hard, using a protruding rock to finally halt his momentum.

The two stood in a deadlock, neither giving an inch. Peng the Fox rallied his spirits and once again raised his Qi for a hard clash.

His Qi condensed like steel, as if forged through a thousand hammer strikes, incredibly concentrated. A dark light flickered along the edge of his palms.

At this moment, it was purely a contest of internal Qi; neither could afford to disengage.

In a martial artist's deadly battle, momentum is crucial. At key moments of confrontation, if one主动 retreats and shows fear, defeat is not far behind.

"Brat, who are you?! Where did you come from!" Peng the Fox roared angrily.

Li Xian threatened, "Yi He Manor! These people are the Madam's tenant farmers. How can you dare to touch the Madam's property? Can you bear the losses?"

"Yi He Manor?" Peng the Fox was taken aback. He had recently heard rumors that the Black Water Gang's Zheng Blood Palm had clashed with Yi He Manor and suffered a great loss, ending up in a very sorry state.

However...

Without any evidence, Peng the Fox was naturally suspicious and didn't believe it. But because of this, he paid a bit more attention to that neighbor, neither too close nor too far.

"Stop waving the big banner at me, Grandpa."

"I've bullied the Black River Village for years, and I've never seen anyone from your manor come."

"Heh heh, if your manor really has the ability, so be it if you compensate. What can you do? I'm determined to take the lives of these lowly commoners!"

Peng the Fox laughed loudly. Cunning as a fox, how could he be easily deceived? He pushed with both palms, his palm force becoming even fiercer.

Li Xian stopped talking and focused on condensing his Qi for the contest.

Since learning martial arts, he had been through over a dozen battles, big and small. There were times he won against the strong with the weak, times he won the strong against the weak, and times he stood in a deadlock...

He had even clashed with a "Soul Eater" martial artist.

But none were as intense as today's battle. It wasn't a contest of moves or adaptability, but of the sheer volume of their internal Qi.

Peng the Fox was a master of "Qi Circulating the Heavenly Cycle" and "Solidifying Blood and Closing Pores." He had perfected the martial art [Extreme Iron Palm], perfected [Mountain Wind Fist], and perfected [Hard Body Art].

In addition, he had two other fist techniques at the minor success stage and three leg techniques at the minor success stage, along with six other basic martial arts he had mastered.

Decades of practice had built up an incredibly profound foundation.

Each martial art, through eating and training, generated a considerable amount of Qi. Over a long period, these trickling streams merged into a lake and then a sea, resulting in his current "Qi volume."

Now, it surged out, turbulent and mighty.

In contrast, Li Xian.

He had only been practicing martial arts for a few months, so the number of martial arts he knew was not high. However, he had perfected [Four Directions Fist] and perfected [Breezy Leg], giving him an extremely high level of martial attainment!

The internal Qi generated by these two alone was enough to match four or five perfected martial arts.

Furthermore, his proficiency in the [Emerald Green Palm], an intermediate martial art, provided another boost of Qi.

It all converged in his Dantian...

If it came down to "Qi volume," he was丝毫不输 (not the least bit inferior) to an old hand like Peng the Fox.

The two exchanged palms for a moment. Peng the Fox exerted all his strength, yet he still found it difficult to resist.

Their internal Qi was hard to distinguish between high and low, but the palm techniques they each employed had different properties.

[Extreme Iron Palm] was a fierce and violent killing move, pursuing a single palm to kill the enemy. Its palm force was relentless, and its killing intent was fully contained in the instant the palm was struck.

[Emerald Green Palm], however, was both gentle and vast.

It was released with follow-up force; when one wave subsided, the next was even larger. The palm force was continuous and coherent, leaving no gaps. [Extreme Iron Palm] failed to take him down immediately, and in that, it had already lost. The longer the stalemate, the greater the loss.

"Hmph!"

Li Xian pushed hard.

With a "bang," the stone Peng the Fox was using for support shattered. He was also struck by the palm force entering his body, thrown back several zhang, and fell to the ground.

Li Xian pressed his advantage and pursued, executing the Four Directions Fist technique. He打出 (struck) several fist shadows, which "bang, bang, bang" three times, solidly hammering Peng the Fox's body.

"Ah!"

Peng the Fox let out several agonized screams. The [Hard Body Art] saved his life, but his internal Qi was insufficient, and he couldn't block all the damage. By now, he was severely injured.

In his panic, he fled in a sorry state.

Li Xian drew his bow, intending to finish him off.

Suddenly, he heard a whinny. Peng the Fox's brown horse kicked and trampled towards Li Xian. Li Xian, unfazed by the danger, rolled across the snowy ground to avoid the attack.

Peng the Fox seized the opportunity, grabbed the saddle, and barely managed to lie on the horse's back, saying weakly, "Run!"

This brown horse was truly exceptional,懂得 protecting its master. It broke into a gallop, its speed incredibly fast. Li Xian sneered, drew his bow again, and shot an arrow that struck Peng the Fox in the shoulder.

"This arrow is coated with a poison that seals the throat upon drawing blood. That should be enough to take his life!"

Li Xian wanted to give chase. However, the recent battle had exhausted all his internal Qi. If he were to encounter another enemy, things could turn against him.

"Sir, thank you for saving our lives!"

The commoners, seeing they were saved, were all overjoyed. Women hugged their children, and men comforted their women.

"Don't celebrate too early. Get back to the village quickly," Li Xian said with a solemn expression. Although things had gone mostly as he expected, there were still some oversights.

"If that beast hadn't interfered, that great mountain bandit would be dead by my arrow."

"Now that he's been hit by a deadly poison, if he returns to the Mountain Wind Stronghold, it will definitely alert the stronghold. They will send people out for revenge."

"Fortunately, from his earlier conversation, it seems the stronghold's forces are incomplete, and their manpower is limited?"

Li Xian analyzed the pros and cons and said to the crowd, "The Mountain Wind Stronghold's pursuers will be here soon."

"You all must flee back to the village. Remember, it's best to go in pairs or threes, scattering and running separately."

"Don't gather together; that makes too big a target and you'll be caught up to quickly!"

Hearing this, everyone knew the situation was serious and took small paths to flee toward the village.

Li Xian lagged behind slightly, setting up traps and ambushes along the way to disrupt the pursuers and buy time for the villagers.

He had learned [Breezy Leg], and in the mountain forests, his speed was not inferior to a horse's, yet he was more agile. He wouldn't say he could come and go as he pleased, but he had confidence in his ability to advance and retreat.

"It seems specializing in Breezy Leg was the right choice."

Li Xian felt incredibly fortunate.

Although [Breezy Leg] was a basic martial art, its effect far surpassed [Four Directions Fist] and [Emerald Green Palm].

"[Four Directions Fist] for head-on confrontation, [Breezy Leg] for escape and maneuvering. Now, my proficiency in Four Directions Fist is over seven thousand, and it's not far from reaching its peak!"

"[Emerald Green Palm] is also incredibly powerful. I'd like to see just what is so special about this martial art!"

On the other side.

Peng the Fox felt a pain in his shoulder and knew he had been hit by an arrow. The palm and fist wounds on his body, plus the arrow wound now, truly made for the most sorry state he had been in for over a decade.

After running for a while.

He suddenly felt a stabbing pain in his heart, and his head grew dizzy. A chill ran down his spine.

"Could there be poison on the arrow!"

He pulled out the arrow and sniffed it. There was the scent of tree sap.

"Not good!"

Although Peng the Fox didn't know what poison it was, he knew it couldn't be simple. He immediately "Solidified his Blood and Closed his Pores" to slow the poison's circulation throughout his body.

But the poison was already in his system. Even if his blood flow was extremely slow, it was still spreading slowly. As the poison seeped deeper, his mind grew increasingly groggy.

Since becoming the Third Leader, he had rarely been in such a sorry state. Now, fear outweighed anger, and he only wanted to quickly take an antidote pill.

The Mountain Wind Stronghold was located on treacherous terrain, easy to defend and hard to attack.

Fortunately, the brown horse knew the way and galloped back to the stronghold's entrance. Peng the Fox's mind relaxed, and he spat out a mouthful of foul blood before losing consciousness, his breath weak.

"Fourth Leader, come quickly! The Third Leader is about to die!"

The bandit guarding the stronghold shouted.

The entire stronghold was thrown into chaos in an instant.

The Fourth Leader, 'Niu Liang', heard the shout and immediately came down the mountain, exclaiming in shock, "Third Brother! Who? Who did this to you!"

"Fourth Leader, the Third Leader has been poisoned and shot with an arrow!" a bandit shouted.

"Quick, hurry, help Third Brother解毒 (cure the poison)."

Niu Liang was a reckless man, only knowing how to charge forward blindly, without any quick wit. He didn't know how to arrange things.

"Fourth Leader, look."

The bandit took the arrow and handed it to Niu Liang.

Fourth Leader Niu Liang looked, and on the arrow shaft, the words "Black Water Gang" were clearly written.

When Li Xian was setting up his ambush, bored, he had carved words on the arrow to create a diversion.

He actually hadn't thought it would be effective, as the intent to frame someone was too obvious; only a fool would believe it.

However...

The Fourth Leader was simple-minded and had no plan. Seeing that Peng the Fox was poisoned, unconscious, and nearly dead, he had already lost his composure and had no time to think about whether the situation was reasonable.

Moreover, they had an old feud with the Black Water Gang. He immediately cursed angrily:

"Damn it!"

"Take good care of the Third Leader, brothers! Grab your weapons, we're going to the Black Water Gang to demand an explanation!"
