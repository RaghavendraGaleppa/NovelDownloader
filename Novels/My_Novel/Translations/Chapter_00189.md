Chapter 189: Displaying True Talent

Li Xian remained calm. "May I ask if the speaker is an elder of the Cao clan?" His voice, infused with Qi, boomed like a spring thunderclap.

Across from Dragon Gate Tower stood a turquoise pavilion named Phoenix Gate Tower. The Cao clan members were located there.

Cao Shuang, an elder of the Cao clan, had been using his Qi to amplify his voice while conversing with the prodigies of the Heavenly Man Tower. His words had been somewhat polite, but toward Li Xian, deep-seated grudges made it impossible for him to speak with a good tone.

Cao Shuang's Qi vibrated as he said, "What if I am?"

Li Xian knew that no amount of courtesy toward the Cao clan would make them let him go. They were using the situation to suppress him, so he had to retaliate with sarcasm. "How ridiculous, how utterly ridiculous. For an elder of the prestigious Cao clan to be so narrow-minded."

"You are even worse than a boy from a poor county."

"You!" Cao Shuang snorted coldly. "Silver-tongued devil. You were just spouting nonsense, tricking the fine young men of the Seven Mountains Sect with your taunts into eating the wrong dish. It led to them being poisoned and collapsing, their lives hanging by a thread. I was lenient because it was your first offense and didn't want to ruin the banquet, so I didn't hold you accountable. Yet you grow even more insolent. Do you really think the martial competition is as childish as your previous antics?"

Li Xian said calmly, "If that is the case, truth is found in practice. I invite Li Ruhu to attack me with the martial art he just used. I will only use the Four Directions Fist."

Li Ruhu immediately attacked, his moves ruthless. Although it was just a basic martial art, he had channeled his internal Qi to its fullest. Li Xian countered with a punch, and fist shadows erupted.

Although Li Ruhu doubted that Li Xian's Four Directions Fist could break his technique, he assumed Li Xian's mastery of the fist was certainly not weak, at least at the Great Perfection level.

There is always a difference between verbal debate and actual combat.

Therefore, he was extremely cautious, having already planned how to maneuver, how to use his techniques effectively, and how to counter.

But he never expected...

Li Xian defeated him with a single punch!

Li Xian threw a punch. Fist shadows manifested, each looking as real as the original. The moment he struck... the aura of reaching the pinnacle, the intent of "who else but me," was so vast, so arrogant!

Reaching the pinnacle, I am number one.

Second Realm martial artist, Third Realm, even Fourth Realm... in the art of the Four Directions Fist alone, I, Li Xian, surpass everyone in the world!

Reaching the pinnacle! After perfection, seeking the supreme.

One cannot imagine it until one encounters it. Originally, the "Four Directions Fist" was merely a basic martial art. Even if one reached the pinnacle, what of it? Ruhu had mastered many lower-tier martial arts, several of which were at Great Perfection.

If he used them, he could surely handle it.

But in this situation, it was too late for regrets. It is common for martial artists to hide their skills during a fight, but it is also common to die without ever getting to show one's lifelong skills.

Li Ruhu felt as if he were facing a towering mountain, a majestic peak. The martial art he executed was crushed instantly. His power, his momentum, his intent—all showed signs of defeat. The force of Li Xian's fist was even more strangely immense.

He sent Li Ruhu flying seven zhang away, crashing through tables along the way, sliding backward until he slammed into a tripod. With a deafening "dong," wine from the tripod splashed out. Only then did he barely come to a stop.

"Pin..."

"Reaching the pinnacle! There really is a martial art that has reached the pinnacle!"

Li Ruhu scrambled to his feet, speaking in terror. That unique aura just now, he had never encountered it anywhere else. It was like looking up at a distant, unreachable peak.

As soon as these words were spoken, inside and outside the lake, inside and outside the pavilion, it was as if a "boom" had exploded. The lake waves rippled, circles spreading endlessly.

Discussions flew through the air, refusing to settle for a long time. "Reaching the pinnacle? I've never seen a martial art reach the pinnacle in my life!"

"It's incredibly rare. Even for a basic martial art, how easy is it to cultivate it to the pinnacle?"

"It's not just 'how easy,' it's as difficult as ascending to heaven. If it were a superior, middle, or lower-tier martial art, it would be manageable. After all, martial arts are hard to come by; if you get one, you should master it thoroughly. Spending ten or twenty years, you might have a chance to reach the pinnacle."

"But for a basic martial art to reach the pinnacle, that is truly terrifying. It shows this boy has extremely high talent in martial arts!"

"Oh? Why do you say that?"

"Think about it, people strive for higher things. Given the premise of having a proper martial art, who would bother studying a basic one? Therefore, for this basic martial art to reach the pinnacle, it must have been achieved with very little time, naturally and effortlessly."

"If that's the case, is this boy invincible? If other martial arts also reached the pinnacle, then..."

"Not necessarily. Perhaps he is just perfectly suited for this specific fist art. That's why he reached the pinnacle; it would be different for other martial arts."

Lin Aoshan was ecstatic, clapping and cheering. Gu Nianjun frowned slightly, feeling very surprised. From her knowledge, those who reached the pinnacle... were extremely rare, few and far between.

The most surprised person was the Lady Wen in the sixth-floor private room.

Lady Wen had been in contact with Li Xian day and night, yet she did not know of his "pinnacle" level. This was because "reaching the pinnacle" meant being the number one in the current world. Li Xian usually didn't show it off intentionally, so no one knew his exact level.

Lady Wen scolded, "This boy, he should be punished!"

However, amidst her anger, she couldn't help but feel a bit of appreciation. The young man's sharp spirit had pierced the sky. It should be so; her person, her things, should be just like this.

Li Xian's voice boomed as he asked, "May I ask if the Cao clan ancestor is ignorant and uninformed?"

The lake surface fell silent; the Cao clan had no reply.

Li Xian laughed three times, his elegant and unrestrained charm momentarily unmatched by anyone. The charm of a martial artist lies in strength as one aspect, and that unique spirit and will as the second.

Li Xian's wings were not yet fully grown, but his spirit soared to the heavens. Because he was trapped in a den, unsure if he had any assistance, he was burning his boats, opening his mind, adding a touch more carefree spirit than usual.

He asked again, "I am going to the upper floors. Does anyone have any objections now?" The prodigies on the third floor, still in shock, did not respond.

Li Xian casually took a wine cup, drank directly from it, and said, "The wine on the third floor, I have tasted its flavor. I shall take my leave now." He had already ascended to the fourth floor!

The moment he reached the fourth floor, there was a fierce tiger blocking the path. A burly man stood in Li Xian's way, shouting in a low, deep voice, "How dare you be so arrogant, insulting an elder!"

This burly man was named Cao Tieshen, also a member of the Cao clan. Li Xian said, "What of it?"

Cao Tieshen sneered, "I challenge you to a martial debate. If you lose, you will kneel and kowtow, apologizing to my clan elder. Then you will swim two laps in the lake."

He wanted to teach Li Xian a lesson to uphold the clan's prestige. He initially wanted a real fight, but then he thought:

"This boy has revealed a fist art at the pinnacle. If I switch to a real fight, I can use a proper martial art to teach him a lesson."

"But in that case, wouldn't I, Cao Tieshen, be 'avoiding his strong point'? In daily martial exchanges, this is understandable. But in this situation today, I must defeat him in the martial debate. A single fist art at the pinnacle isn't necessarily that powerful."

Cao Tieshen was the top of the fourth floor, ranked twelfth on the Hero List, and had his own pride. He grew stronger when facing the strong.

Li Xian said, "Alright. If I win, I just want you to get out of my way and not block my sight."

Cao Tieshen felt deeply insulted. This boy's speech was calm, seemingly easygoing, but actually filled with an indescribable arrogance. He paused for a moment, then spoke clearly, his voice spreading across the four shores of the lake.

He spoke of how he would execute the Cao clan's 'Close-fitting Blade', 'Cao Chain Blade', 'Iron Chain Fist', and other basic martial arts. Under the condition of using the same basic martial arts, he would highlight his strengths and avoid his weaknesses. Using various techniques, he would suppress Li Xian's Four Directions Fist.

This would make it so that even though Li Xian had a fist art at the pinnacle, he couldn't fully display it.

He spoke eloquently, causing the lake waves to ripple even more intensely. At this moment, deep within the lake bottom, it seemed as if something was about to emerge.

The martial artists of the Jianghu all said Cao Tieshen was formidable. When martial artists fight, they should see the moves and break them.

They were also curious: since Li Xian's Four Directions Fist was useless, how would he win?

Li Xian smiled lightly, using the same trick again, saying something astonishing: "I will break it with my legs." He explained how to use leg techniques to deal with various dangerous situations, and how to counter the Cao clan's Close-fitting Blade, Iron Chain Fist, Chain Blade, and other martial arts, using the Four Directions Fist in配合 with the Breeze Legs, breaking them one by one.

The leg techniques involved could not be achieved unless they were at the "pinnacle."

Cao Tieshen's expression changed, and he took several steps back. "Could it be that your leg technique is also..."

Li Xian said calmly, "As you have heard, it has also reached the pinnacle."

Cao Tieshen didn't believe it and immediately struck to grab him. He used the moves he had just described verbally, but his internal Qi was extremely robust, far surpassing Li Ruhu's, making his momentum even fiercer.

Li Xian sneered. The Breeze Legs took the lead in defeating the enemy. The leg technique looked light but was actually heavy. With just two kicks, he dismantled the carefully designed moves of Cao Tieshen.

Another martial art at the pinnacle!

Even if they were basic martial arts, possessing two at the same time was enough to shock everyone.

Li Xian aimed for the top seat and ascended another floor. His overwhelming intent to climb high感染ed the旁观者.

For a time, martial debates, seeking advice, drinking, delicacies, the first snow, the lake... the banquet on the floors of prodigies was extremely lively.

Li Xian was unstoppable; no one could阻拦 him. He was almost guaranteed victory in martial debates. When he reached the fifth floor, the prodigies he met were even stronger. But all of this... collapsed completely when he revealed his third basic martial art at the pinnacle, leaving people in despair.

All the prodigies were horrified: "Monster! How many martial arts has this person cultivated to the pinnacle!?"

There were those who were unconvinced and resentful, thinking: "Hmph, a basic martial art at the pinnacle is indeed rare. But it's only powerful in martial debates. If restrictions were lifted and I used all my means, I would surely defeat you."

He arrived at the sixth floor.

There were only four people here, two men and two women, all with extraordinary bearing. They already knew of Li Xian's prowess, his strength in martial debates that suppressed everyone. Yet, they all had the pride of prodigies, and none were willing to defeat him through a "real fight."

If they did so, wouldn't they lose their spirit and appear narrow-minded? Words failing, so they resorted to force?

The four looked at each other, none wanting to face Li Xian.

Li Xian said, "Miss Ji, please make room."

Ji Hongyan, sitting on the right, gave a bitter smile. "Mr. Li's talent in the Dao of martial arts, Hongyan has truly never heard of nor seen before."

"Three martial arts, though only basic, have all reached the pinnacle. There is no need for further debate. Hongyan admits defeat."

"Previously, due to street rumors, I misunderstood you greatly. If you are willing in the future, you may visit the Immortal Fluttering Tower to see me. At that time, I would be willing to play the zither for you all night to express my apology."

After speaking, she bowed slightly and vacated a seat. The delicacies on the table had only been tasted in small bites; lipstick remained on the spoon.

She was indeed a beauty with great charm.

Li Xian smiled in response, preparing to sit down and taste the feast on the sixth floor.

Just then, he suddenly felt the wine cup in front of him shaking. Wine spilled over the rim, dripping onto the table. The tremor continued to intensify, becoming more and more obvious. Finally, the entire "Heavenly Man Tower" was swaying left and right.

Ou Yezi shouted loudly, "Good, good! The golden carp is not a creature of a shallow pool..."

Ripples stirred in the previously calm lake bottom. A golden light shot out.

It is said that the精华 of heaven and earth, thirty-six celestial essences, seventy-two terrestrial treasures, and one hundred and eighty human treasures...

All are extremely rare. If consumed, one can enjoy infinite benefits and gain insight into the Dao of the art.

The one hundred and sixth human treasure is the Golden Carp.

Born of heaven and earth, formed naturally. Its entire body is golden, its scales exquisite. This fish loves to feed on "talent Qi."

It must be the talent Qi of vibrant youth.

The精华 of heaven and earth, the Golden Carp in the pool, appears!
