# Chapter 58: Breaking Through to the Seventeenth Meridian, the慕容 Family's Gratitude

**Part 1**

The慕容 Family Estate.

The Meditation Room.

This was usually the cultivation ground reserved for the heads of the慕容 family over the generations.

慕容霄 had to get permission before walking into the Meditation Room.

"Grandfather, why have you summoned me?"

As soon as he entered, he saw his grandfather, 慕容海, sitting on a meditation cushion with a wooden box beside him.

"Naturally, to check your progress. I want to see if you have slacked off after entering the Qingyuan Sect," 慕容海 said, looking up.

Even now, the fate of the慕容 family was still decided by his single word.

However, he would eventually grow old.

His son, that is, 慕容霄's father, had yet to be heard from.

The other branches had long been eyeing the position of family head.

Fortunately, 慕容霄 had consistently displayed immense talent, keeping those people to merely thinking about it, without daring to take any real action.

"Rest assured, Grandfather. I have kept your words in mind," 慕容霄 said earnestly.

"What stage have you reached in the Qi and Blood Realm?" 慕容海 asked.

慕容霄 replied honestly, "Seven meridians. I'm only a step away from the eighth."

"Good, very good. You are much stronger than I was at your age."

"I just don't know how your combat prowess is."

慕容海 nodded and stood up.

The aura emanating from him was suppressed to the level of the seventh meridian of the Qi and Blood Realm at this moment.

"Come, let's have a match, grandfather and grandson."

"Grandfather?"

"Don't worry, I won't use martial arts beyond the Qi and Blood Realm."

Sounds of fists and feet colliding, and surging force, echoed within the Meditation Room.

After the time it takes to burn an incense stick...

"Enough, enough! Grandfather, you are too厉害 (powerful)."

慕容霄 sat on the ground, looking frustrated, his entire body covered in sweat.

"You are already much stronger than an ordinary practitioner of the Qi and Blood Realm," 慕容海 said, looking at his grandson with satisfaction. "If you can step into the eighth meridian and refine your Golden Bell Shield to the initial proficient stage, an ordinary Qi and Blood Realm practitioner without a divine weapon would likely be unable to break your defense."

"Am I that powerful?"

Hearing his grandfather's praise, 慕容海 (Note: The original text says 慕容海 here, but context implies it should be 慕容霄) tiredly revealed a smile.

"Naturally. At the Nine Peaks Tournament, it wouldn't be difficult for you to get into the top five."

"It's hard to say, Grandfather. In my generation, there are many powerful people," 慕容霄 shook his head.

Brother Li, 嬴冰, 林江, 萧勤—these were geniuses he knew of.

The true disciples of the other peaks also had outstanding talents that shouldn't be underestimated.

"You are just too prone to self-deprecation," 慕容海 shook his head. "Your generation has indeed produced many outstanding figures, but you are not necessarily inferior to them."

"Last month, I met the most renowned genius of the Fen Yulin generation. He was still three points inferior to you."

His grandson's character was a bit too timid.

With such talent, he was absolutely top-tier in the Ziyang Prefecture, with the ability to elevate the慕容 family to a higher level in the future.

For some reason, he always viewed himself so lowly.

"Take this."

慕容海 handed the box on the table to his grandson.

Upon opening it, there were two green pills inside.

Each one had four pill patterns.

"Two fourth-grade Breaking Meridian Pills. These will be enough for you to open another meridian in the coming days."

"Grandfather, won't the other uncles and aunts of the other branches have objections?" 慕容霄 asked quietly.

This was undoubtedly using family assets to purchase them, and the cost was不小 (not small).

The problem wasn't scarcity, but inequality. He had received preferential resources since he was young, and the other branches had long been quite vocal about it.

"You are the genius of my慕容 family, the future pillar of the family."

"If the money isn't spent on you, should I let them squander it?"

"Take it right here."

慕容海 snorted, his tone decisive.

Only after personally watching his grandson swallow one of the pills did he sit back down.

*Crack—*

Not long after.

A light sound came from 慕容霄's body.

He was already just a step away. With his mind calm today, he actually broke through in no time.

"Hahaha, good."

"As expected of the Qilin of my慕容 family."

慕容海's brow relaxed.

He thought his grandson would need two Breaking Meridian Pills, but who knew one would suffice.

Then he saw 慕容霄 carefully put the remaining Breaking Meridian Pill back into the box.

"Grandfather, I want to give this one to Brother Li. He gave me pills before too."

"What kind of pills?"

慕容海 smiled, not opposing it, and casually asked.

This question left the old man speechless.

"A bottle of sixth-grade Clear Heart Pills."

"...... Wait a moment."

慕容海's mouth twitched. Looking at his grandson's expression, it didn't seem like a lie.

Well, 慕容霄's nature was to never lie.

A sixth-grade pill, a whole bottle...

Seeing his grandfather's eyelids twitch, 慕容霄 walked into a small room within the Meditation Room. Sounds of rummaging came from inside, leaving him puzzled.

What was Grandfather doing?

Not long after, 慕容霄 returned with another box in hand.

"I picked a few of my treasured items. Let's go."

"Okay."

The grandfather and grandson walked out of the Meditation Room, heading towards the courtyard where Li Mo resided.

Along the way, 慕容海's feelings were complex.

He had intended to give a favor, but ended up having to repay one instead.

And it might not even be a debt he could fully repay.

A top-tier martial art technique of exquisite quality, a bottle of sixth-grade pills—these were things that almost changed 慕容霄's life.

Just as he was thinking this...

A strange fluctuation caught his attention.

"Hm?"

"This is..."

慕容海's expression suddenly changed.

The closer they got to the courtyard, the stronger that inexplicable sense of palpitation became.

"Grandfather?"

慕容霄 didn't understand, but hurriedly followed.

Soon, they arrived at the entrance.

They saw that in the courtyard, for some reason, there were already many animals, all harmoniously and quietly staying in the yard.

Spring had already passed.

But in the courtyard, the peach trees had sprouted new buds.

慕容海's beard fluttered in the wind, his eyes full of astonishment.

When he was young, he traveled the world and once had the fortune to see an Outer Scene expert breaking through.

The scene back then was remarkably similar to this moment?

"Could it that this young friend Li is actually a high expert hiding his realm?"

He couldn't help but wonder.

However.

*Roar—*

A sound like a tiger's roar and a dragon's cry, like a giant bell, shook the spirit.

A powerful fluctuation of Qi and Blood came from the room.

Undoubtedly, this was the sign of a breakthrough in the Qi and Blood Realm.

Li Mo was indeed in the Qi and Blood Realm.

It's just that the signs of his breakthrough were a little bit extraordinary...

"Brother Li is breaking through?"

慕容霄 scratched his head.

Seeing the commotion of the breakthrough before him, he even doubted his own breakthrough.

Just at this moment.

*Roar—*

*Crack—*

Another sound of a breakthrough.

This time, it seemed something had shattered.

"Within a few breaths... breaking through two realms consecutively..."

The old man, 慕容 Hai, a proper观神境 (Observing God Realm) expert, actually felt like he couldn't catch his breath for a moment.

Just now, he had thought his own grandson was a genius.

But now, he suddenly felt like he was a frog in a well.

"Grandfather, what's wrong with you?"

"Brother Li is always like this. You're just being overly surprised," 慕容霄 said, as if it were common.

慕容海: "......"

He finally understood why his grandson didn't think he was a genius.

Being around people like Li Mo, it's really hard to have much self-confidence.

Just as the grandfather and grandson were staring at each other, speechless.

The door opened.

Li Mo, having changed into a new set of clothes, walked out with an apologetic expression.

"Sorry about that. It seems I broke the bathtub."

It wasn't that the fine bathtub made of golden-threaded wood had any problems.

He just hadn't expected the Earth-Buried Spirit Milk to be so potent, and the commotion from breaking through to the seventeenth meridian to be so great.

That's right.

Little Li had reached the seventeenth meridian.
