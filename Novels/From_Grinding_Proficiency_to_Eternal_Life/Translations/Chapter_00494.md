# Chapter 494: Venerable Pure Yang Ancestor Above!

Xu Yunfan’s heart trembled slightly upon hearing those words. In the Divine Martial Realm, his clone had been discovered in a similar manner, yet he never expected the Venerable Pure Yang Ancestor to see through it with a single remark.

*This fellow’s cultivation base seems to be immeasurably profound,* he thought.

He knew well that the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture* could sever the "True Body Dao Physique." With his Attribute Panel, every time he stepped into a new realm, he naturally understood the profound mysteries within.

However, even at the Great Completion level of the technique, it only allowed Xu Yunfan to split off a clone that was nearly as good as his original source. It was still a far cry from achieving a True Body Dao Physique.

Only upon reaching Perfection could it be fully realized.

"However..."

Lu Chunyang’s tone shifted again as he shook his head slightly. "With your current Mid Foundation Establishment cultivation, even if you possess the wondrous methods of the *Scripture*, you are still ten thousand miles away from the Perfection realm where you can sever your True Body Dao Physique. Distant water cannot put out a nearby fire."

Xu Yunfan wasn’t surprised to hear this. He glanced at the Attribute Panel in his vision.

The proficiency for the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture* was still 4,832 points short of Great Completion.

After all, he had only entered the Great Completion realm not long ago.

Great Completion was easy to train, but Perfection was difficult to attain.

Whether it was the martial arts he cultivated in the Divine Martial Realm or the Dao techniques he cultivated in the Taihua Spirit Void Realm, this remained true.

Great Completion was easy to enter, but Perfection was hard to seek.

To advance the *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture* to Perfection, even with the assistance of the Attribute Panel, would require another twenty to thirty years. By then, the yellow chrysanthemums would have turned cold—meaning it would be too late.

"However..." Lu Chunyang’s voice sounded again, carrying a hint of composure as if he had a plan already. "Since this True Lord has met a talented junior of the Dao Sect today, and heard that the Dao Sect is still flourishing, yet you are trapped by the karma of the Buddhist sect... I should naturally lend you a hand."

He swept his large sleeve, and a warm, majestic, pure vital energy that seemed to condense a trace of pure life from the beginning of the universe flew out from his sleeve.

The light hovered in front of Xu Yunfan, its radiance gradually fading to reveal an object.

It was a gem the size of a human head, entirely of a chaotic black-and-yellow color, with a misty purple aura flowing on its surface.

It didn't seem to be a solid object, but rather a solid manifestation of a Dao law. Inside, it seemed as if countless tiny stars were being born and destroyed, containing a majestic, immense, yet gentle primitive life essence. It also possessed a tough and unyielding virtue of carrying all things.

"This is the 'Black and Yellow Fetal Stone'."

Lu Chunyang introduced it. "It is neither gold nor jade. It was obtained by this old man during his early years traveling the outer realms, at a strange point of void creation. It contains a trace of the creation true fetal mother energy from when chaos first opened and yin and yang were not yet distinguished. Its nature is a perfect match for the creation Dao expounded in your *Mysterious Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture*."

Xu Yunfan was overjoyed and bowed deeply to thank him. "Thank you, Ancestor, for the treasure!"

He received the Black and Yellow Fetal Stone with both hands, solemnly.

The moment he touched it, the Attribute Panel abruptly flashed a message prompt.

`[Detected: Innate Creation Source Quality - Black and Yellow Mother Energy]`

Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred. For the Attribute Panel to pop up a specific information prompt meant this Black and Yellow Fetal Stone was incredibly precious.

The Venerable Pure Yang Ancestor had simply given it away.

He was naturally immensely grateful.

The fetal stone was warm and smooth, exuding a majestic vitality. The scene of stars being born and destroyed within the chaotic black-and-yellow body became even clearer. The misty purple energy drilled into his seven orifices like living snakes.

Before Xu Yunfan could even urge it, the chaotic black stone the size of a head, pulled by the creation mother energy, began to dissolve and collapse on its own. It turned into a thick, mellow black-and-yellow liquid that surged and seeped into his four limbs and hundred bones.

Xu Yunfan’s body shook violently, his form instantly turning translucent like glazed glass.

Lu Chunyang said, "If not refine it now, when?"

Xu Yunfan dared not delay. Deep within his 365 major acupoints, the shadows of the Eight Scenery Divine Palaces bloomed with a rumble.

The "Shock Palace" light, with its wind and thunder agitation and rising dragons and snakes, first solidified.

Immediately after, the "Li and Kan Palaces," with Li-fire burning the plains and Kan-water surging, intertwined and manifested.

Finally, all the light and shadows converged at the "Primordial Palace" between his eyebrows—the ancestor cavity. The immense creation force washed over every inch of his flesh, bones, and tendons. The entire Void-Exploiting Heaven Realm was illuminated by the eight-colored divine light, creating a bizarre spectacle.

"Focus your spirit! Sever the thought!"

Lu Chunyang’s shout was like thunder from the ninth heaven, causing spatial ripples to ripple through the area.

A fishy, sweet taste churned in Xu Yunfan’s throat.

A tearing pain that seemed to split his soul pierced through his spiritual platform. He gritted his teeth. Under the operation of the *Scripture* secret method, a core of his soul, condensed to the extreme and identical to his main soul, was forcibly split out.

This wisp of divided spirit, carrying the light and shadows of the three Divine Palaces—Shock, Li, and Kan—violently crashed into the core of the suspended, flowing Black and Yellow Mother Energy.

*Hum!*

The scene inside the hall changed abruptly, as if chaos had just opened.

The black-and-yellow liquid boiled and churned. Under the guidance and suppression of the Eight Scenery Divine Palace shadows, it rapidly重组 (reorganized). Bones, tendons, the five organs, and six bowels clearly formed within the boiling chaos. Thousands of tiny stars flowed and extinguished within the meridians and acupoints of the new body.

In just a few breaths, a "True Body Dao Physique" identical in appearance to Xu Yunfan, yet flowing with chaotic Dao patterns all over, and with a chest that rose and fell slightly with the breathing of the Black and Yellow Mother Energy, hovered in mid-air, exuding a majestic vitality.

But the next moment, this body, identical in appearance, rapidly curled up and turned into a fetal form, no longer resembling Xu Yunfan.

At this moment, Lu Chunyang’s eyes flashed with a cold light. He pointed his fingers like a sword and slashed through the air.

"Sword Three: No Return!"

High above the Void-Exploiting dome, the gloomy Sword Intent engraved with the ancient characters "No Return" suddenly lit up. It turned into a gray line that annihilated all traces and had no return, plummeting down instantly.

The sword light did not cut toward any physical body, but precisely severed the invisible yet tightly connected causal threads between Xu Yunfan’s main body and the newly born True Body Dao Physique.

*Sizzle!*

Countless dark golden chains, flowing with Sanskrit mantras, were forcibly pulled out from the top of Xu Yunfan’s head by the gray sword light.

Each chain was as solid as substance, exuding a terrifying Buddhist dignity. The ends of the chains pierced through the void, firmly anchored in the immeasurable golden Buddhist light in the distant Eastern Wasteland.

Simultaneously, the shadow of the玄龟 (Black Tortoise) and Snake, condensed by the martial arts true intent of the *True武 Subduing Demon True Scripture* residing in Xu Yunfan’s Dantian Qi Sea, let out an unwilling howl. It was also carried by the No Return Sword Intent, leaving his body entirely. It transformed into a Black Water light and slammed into the ancestor cavity of the True Body Dao Physique.

The Attribute Panel prompt flashed coldly.

`[Root Law Stripped: True武 Subduing Demon True Scripture (Transferred)]`

In an instant, Xu Yunfan felt the invisible shackles that were like a mountain, constantly pulling him toward the Eastern Wasteland, suddenly vanish.

His body felt light as if it could fly, and his soul was clearer and more transparent than ever before.

"It is done."

Lu Chunyang withdrew his sword and stood with his hands behind his back.

Inside the Void Hall, the oppressive atmosphere of Buddhist karma entanglement was completely gone, leaving only pure Black and Yellow creation and sharp sword intent.

However, the suspended True Body Dao Physique suddenly opened its eyes at this moment, its curled body stretching out.

Its pupils contained dark golden Buddhist light intertwined with the rhythm of the Black Water Black Tortoise. A new, powerful independent spirituality, not entirely controlled by the main body, was gestating and sprouting within.
