# Chapter 527: Cultivation Is Karmic Connection with the Buddha

Xu Yunfan secretly calculated the rewards for protecting the Dao that Chu Chengnan had promised before his ascension. A Great True Person who had accumulated five lifetimes and reached the peak of the Foundation Establishment realm possessed wealth that was truly immeasurable. The gains from Cold Crow Pass were nothing more than mosquito legs in comparison. This was his greatest tangible gain from this trip. Moreover, upon returning, he would learn two secret arts. It was simply perfect.

With this thought, Xu Yunfan's gaze once again fell in the direction Chu Chengnan had vanished, his eyes growing even deeper. A pawn and a discarded piece were separated by but a thin line. And that so-called "half of his wealth" was nothing other than a "pacification" and "advance payment" from True Lord Qingyuan, for Xu Yunfan was still a pawn of some use. Everything fit perfectly with Chu Chengnan's parting words: Trust no one, trust only your own strength!

Just as Xu Yunfan was about to depart, he felt a slight stir in his heart. His vision shifted back to the Eastern Wasteland, connecting to the sight of his clone, Sun Wukong. Leading the group was the one with a gleaming bald head, wearing a tattered monk's hat, his cassock in shreds. He carried a massive pack on his back, looking utterly wretched yet still striving to maintain a solemn demeanor. He was Sanzang. By his side were still Wukong, Wujing, and Wuneng. The group traveled in silence, merely pressing onward in quiet procession.

The aftershocks of the Great True Lord battle in the Eastern Wasteland had also impacted this unfortunate scripture-seeking party. Wuneng, up to this point, still occasionally let out faint, terrified mutterings. After the commotion in front of the Zhenyuan Temple, they followed the guidance of the predestined "Ritual for the Guiding of the Self-Existing King Buddha's Position" set by the Bodhisattva's Pure Land, heading deeper into the Eastern Wasteland. This journey required great wisdom, great perseverance, and great courage. Only with Wukong as the intermediary could they hope to receive the favor of the Buddha's position. At this moment, they were silently departing this place of danger and strife, once again embarking on the uncertain journey west.

Xu Yunfan only glanced at it briefly before shifting his gaze away from his clone, Sun Wukong. Regardless of what other schemes the Buddhist sect had, the muddy waters of this Journey to the West game, in the wake of Chu Chengnan's disastrous defeat, were not something a Foundation Establishment cultivator like him could meddle in, nor should he pay too much attention to it. They had True Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect or Bodhisattvas of the Bodhisattva's Pure Land to weigh and layout their own plans. The only thing Xu Yunfan had to do now was to leave this place as soon as possible, digest the vast resources left to him by Chu Chengnan, and figure out how to find a sliver of opportunity for survival and growth within the intricate and even more oppressive web of the sect.

His clone, Sun Wukong, and his clone, Han Shi, were definitely of great use! After the Unrivaled Sword of the Pure Yang Ancestor had severed his karma, unless the Lord of the Dao personally descended, Xu Yunfan was certain that these two clones would be the foundation upon which he would seek the Golden Core and prove the Dao in the future. It was about time to pull Han Shi out of the Divine Martial Realm. With his talent, it would be a sure thing for him to be directly accepted into the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

A gentle breeze stirred Xu Yunfan's robes, bringing him back to his senses. He took a deep breath. The potent energy of destruction and rebirth from the still-lingering Primordial Clarity and Turbidity pierced his lungs and viscera, only to be instantly refined by the circulation of the True Scripture of the Celestial Thunder, transforming into pure spiritual power flowing within him. He did not linger any longer. There was no better time than the present; he did not wish to wait another three days at Cold Crow Pass. Choosing a direction, he transformed into a streak of light shrouded in Eight Scenery Cloud Qi and fine Celestial Thunder lightning. A few feet off the ground, he shot silently and swiftly back toward the mountain gate of the Primordial Origin Sect, away from Cold Crow Pass.

Several days later, at the True Martial Peak of the Primordial Origin Sect.

As the place of inheritance for the True Martial Subduing Demons lineage, which he had personally established, True Martial Peak still maintained the solemn and majestic atmosphere Xu Yunfan had originally envisioned. A massive Black Tortoise stone sculpture stood before the mountain gate, inhaling and exhaling the vast spiritual energy of water. Among the overlapping peaks, jet-black palaces were built into the mountains, their halls scattered in a picturesque manner.

However, when Xu Yunfan set foot on this long-absent main peak, his feelings were completely different from the past. Although there were many people on the peak, and under the management of Bi Yuan and the others over the years, True Martial Peak had been thriving, it now seemed to carry a certain heaviness. This was because Xu Yunfan had switched to cultivating the True Scripture of the Nine Celestial Chambers of the Celestial Thunder, leaving True Martial Peak in a somewhat low state.

Disciples hurried about, and from the training grounds came the shouts of disciples practicing the combat techniques inherited from the True Martial Subduing Demons True Scripture. However, Xu Yunfan's keen spiritual sense detected an unusual sense of decline. Spreading out his spiritual sense, he quickly picked up the gist from the disciples' conversations.

The True Martial Subduing Demons True Scripture was now something he had switched from cultivating, and this very scripture was being manipulated by the Bodhisattva's Pure Land. Although the Divine Martial Realm was still in the hands of the Primordial Origin Sect, if anyone cultivated it to a certain level, they might develop a karmic connection with the Buddha and be pried away by the Bodhisattva's Pure Land by any means necessary. Then, they would be converted, brainwashed, and given a one-stop service into the monastic life. Damn it, this was simply too shameless!

Xu Yunfan cursed inwardly. The Bodhisattva's Pure Land and the Primordial Origin Sect were clearly pulling against each other. The Divine Martial Dao Fruit nurtured in the small world of the Divine Martial Realm was simply impossible to prove. The Bodhisattva's Pure Land, for the sake of the ritual to guide the Self-Existing King Buddha's position and receive the favor of the Buddha's position, saw that the Divine Martial Realm was firmly clutched in the Primordial Origin Sect's hands, and could only transform it into a Scripture of the Battle-Buddha for Sun Wukong to cultivate. The Primordial Origin Sect, on the other hand, truly did not want the Bodhisattva's Pure Land to have it good.

The severance of their lineage and the uncertainty of the path ahead cast an invisible shadow over the heart of every disciple who cultivated diligently. Cultivation to a certain level was karmic connection with the Buddha. This was utterly preposterous! No matter how hard they worked, the True Martial Subduing Demons True Scripture was a dead end with no room for cultivation or progress. Their efforts were mostly a futile inertia maintained in the midst of panic.

Xu Yunfan's arrival was silent and unannounced. He did not go to see Bi Yuan and the others for the time being. They were all still in seclusion, and he did not wish to disturb them too much. After all, asking them to废掉功法 (废掉功法:废掉 means to abolish/destroy, 功法 means cultivation method. This is a common phrase meaning to abandon one's current cultivation method and start over from scratch, often at great cost) and start over would be quite fatal for them given their age. He had to think about how to improve it. He directly returned to a relatively secluded cave dwelling on the mountainside.

The restrictions on the cave dwelling were triggered, and soon, three figures rushed over from different directions. The leader was a man with a resolute expression, dressed in a black tight-fitting outfit, his aura steady. He was Wu Yan, an inner disciple whom Bi Yuan had taken in as a disciple and who was代理 (代理: acting/acting in charge of) the affairs on the peak. Close behind him was a youth with an honest-looking face who had already undergone a complete transformation. He still had a hint of youthful greenness on his face, but his steps were steady, and his physique and vitality were extremely robust. He was Chen Tiezhu, who had cultivated Bi Yuan's "Great Ox Demon Fist" to a profound level. A pure body-refining cultivator. The last person was a tall, slender cultivator with a阴柔 (yīnróu: yin-like, soft, or insidious) aura and flickering eyes, like a shadow.

"Peak Master! You've returned!"

When Wu Yan saw Xu Yunfan safe and sound, a look of relief and awe flashed in his eyes, and he immediately bowed respectfully. Chen Tiezhu's eyes also shone with undisguised admiration as he clumsily bowed. The阴柔 cultivator also bowed, but his gaze was lowered, not daring to look directly at Xu Yunfan.

Xu Yunfan gave the three of them a淡淡 (dàndàn: light, faint, nonchalant) glance, his gaze lingering for a moment on Chen Tiezhu, feeling somewhat satisfied with his progress during this time. He walked into the inner chamber of the cave dwelling and took the main seat.
