# Chapter 79: Nut Barrier Formation

A first-grade, low-tier Nut could withstand a full-force strike from a cultivator at the eighth or ninth layer of Qi Refinement. This level of defensive capability, surpassing two entire realms, was truly formidable.

For comparison, a first-grade, low-tier Potato Mine could instantly kill early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators and severely injure mid-stage ones, but its effectiveness against late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators was limited.

Moreover, as Gu Mo ceased his attacks, the Nut began absorbing spiritual energy from the field, gradually healing its wounds. Before long, the damage would be completely restored.

This meant that if an enemy's damage couldn't outpace the Nut's regeneration, they would never be able to break through its defense.

However, why would an enemy stubbornly attack an immobile Nut when they could simply bypass it? The Nut had no offensive capabilities and couldn't hinder enemies who walked past it.

The Nut was incredibly strong—its terrifying defense could withstand attacks from enemies two realms above it. If Gu Mo upgraded it further, it might even block attacks from Great Perfection Qi Refinement cultivators.

But the Nut also had significant drawbacks: immobility and lack of control effects. If it had a taunt ability, it would be perfect.

This thought sparked an idea in Gu Mo's mind. If the Nut didn't have a taunt effect naturally, perhaps he could artificially add one. The Nut's large surface area could accommodate inscriptions...

His train of thought was interrupted when he touched the Nut's rough surface, but the idea broadened his perspective. There were no useless plants—only those whose true potential hadn't been discovered yet.

"Wait—formations!"

Suddenly, inspiration struck. Could the Nut be used as a formation stone? The quality of formation stones determined a formation's strength. Many formations failed not because they were flawed but because the stones shattered after repeated attacks, causing the formation to collapse.

If the Nut's incredible defense and regeneration were leveraged as a formation stone, breaking the formation would become exponentially harder—especially for defensive formations, which would be the perfect fit.

Of course, this was just speculation. Gu Mo wasn't a formation master and couldn't confirm its feasibility.

"Looks like I need to ask Chu Feifei." Gu Mo took out his communication jade slip. This was where having a trustworthy formation master as an ally proved invaluable.

Using the Nut for formations meant Chu Feifei would inevitably discover it. While the Nut wasn't as conspicuous as the Sunflower, entrusting an unfamiliar formation master with the task carried risks. With Chu Feifei, those risks were minimized.

"Gu Mo, what's so urgent?" About two hours later, Chu Feifei arrived on her paper crane, landing outside Gu Mo's spirit field.

Gu Mo hadn't specified the details in his message, only asking her to visit when she had time. He hadn't expected her to come so promptly.

"I have some questions about formations." Gu Mo opened the barrier and led her to the Nut in a corner of the field. "This is a new spirit plant I recently developed. Do you think it could work as a formation stone?"

Now a certified Spirit Planter, Gu Mo's claim that the Nut was a hybrid plant he'd created was entirely plausible. Unsurprisingly, Chu Feifei didn't question it.

"Using plants as formation stones isn't impossible, but two conditions must be met." Chu Feifei examined the person-sized Nut. From her knowledge, formation stones required materials that were both durable and allowed spiritual energy to flow freely. Durability prevented easy destruction, while energy flow ensured the formation operated smoothly.

"No problem there!"

Gu Mo confirmed the Nut met both criteria. Its durability was self-evident—he'd tested its defenses firsthand. As for energy flow, the Nut was a living spirit plant, so spiritual energy could circulate within it naturally.

"Then I can give it a try."

Chu Feifei agreed, though actual testing was needed to verify its viability. The experiment couldn't be conducted in the spirit field, so Gu Mo uprooted the Nut and replanted it in a secluded area.

Since the new location wasn't a spirit field, the Nut's regeneration would be severely weakened, but its defensive capabilities remained intact—similar to the Potato Mine. The Peashooter, however, required a spirit field for sustained attacks.

As Gu Mo replanted the Nut, Chu Feifei set up a simple defensive formation. Her talent in formations was exceptional; she'd mastered many basic ones long ago. Once she reached the third layer of Qi Refinement, she could inherit proper formation techniques and become a true formation master.

"Done."

The formation complete, Chu Feifei nodded. The Nut served as the formation's core, and per Gu Mo's suggestion, it would bear the brunt of all attacks.

Though unconventional—formation cores were typically protected—this was just an experiment, so Chu Feifei obliged.

With the formation active, its strength could now be tested. The question of whether the Nut could function as a formation stone had already been answered.

Observing the faint barrier, Gu Mo clenched his fist and struck.

**Boom!**

His punch tore through the air with a deafening crack, slamming into the barrier. The impact sent violent ripples across the luminous shield, which then converged onto the Nut at the core.

**Crack!**

A deep fissure split a third of the Nut's surface. Gu Mo's eyes lit up—success!

The Nut had absorbed the full force of his strike, preserving the formation. Without it, such a basic defensive formation would've shattered instantly.

Gu Mo's physical strength was nine times that of his peers, and his punch had reached the power of a sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator. With a body-refining technique and a powerful martial skill, he could even rival the seventh layer—a goal he planned to pursue once he saved enough sect contribution points.

Turning to Chu Feifei for her assessment, he found her utterly stunned.
