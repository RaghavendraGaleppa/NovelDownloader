# Chapter 2: I Have Seven Skill Slots

"Xiao Ding, fetch us three cups of water." A shout suddenly came from not far away.

But how could Ding Rui be in the mood to fetch water now? He immediately turned back and shouted, "I've mastered the Golden Radiance Art! I need to quickly go and consolidate it. Please forgive me, senior brothers!"

"You mastered it!"

"Indeed, you should go consolidate it. Hurry!"

"In a few more days, my work will become much easier..."

The cultivators were also very happy to hear the good news, each waving goodbye to Ding Rui.

"Thank you, seniors!"

Ding Rui rushed non-stop to his thatched hut.

Then he focused all his attention on the skill slots in his mind.

"It can't just be for looking, right?"

He thought, looking at a golden icon on the skill bar. Clearly, this was the Golden Radiance Art he had just mastered. It was now recognized as a skill. He could choose to place it in a skill slot or discard it, which meant forgetting it.

With a thought, the golden icon was embedded into a skill slot. There was nothing to hesitate about, because according to game settings, once placed, it could be removed at any time without any cost. However, if a skill was discarded, it was truly lost. To regain it, one would have to re-comprehend it.

"Golden Radiance Art."

He knew this much about skill management now, but when Ding Rui first transmigrated, he certainly hadn't had such an easy grasp. He had studied for a long time before gradually becoming proficient, and now cultivating manually was almost as natural as breathing.

In this world, almost all living beings could cultivate, naturally absorbing spiritual energy to strengthen themselves. Cultivation methods, however, merely accelerated this process or served as tools to imbue the absorbed spiritual energy with other properties. In other words, Ding Rui could cultivate and become powerful even without the Golden Radiance Art, but he could only cultivate unaligned true essence. Unaligned true essence was useless in the spiritual fields and naturally couldn't earn him spirit rice. His cultivation speed was simply no match for other cultivators.

After meditating for a while, all the spiritual energy was naturally absorbed by his body and condensed into unaligned true essence. Ding Rui then once again clicked on the Golden Radiance Art icon in his skill slot with a thought.

The icon lit up.

Immediately, the previously dormant unaligned true essence in his dantian suddenly began to move on its own. Ding Rui exerted no control whatsoever. The true essence, controlled by some unknown force, slowly flowed out of his dantian, following the prescribed route of the Golden Radiance Art, moving steadily through his meridians.

Smooth and swift.

It was several times smoother than when he controlled it himself, almost perfect! The unaligned true essence continued its journey into his lungs, circulating fully without the slightest hitch, and then stored itself in the acupoints around his lungs.

A mere thought, and cultivation became fully automated.

He could even cultivate while eating.

Cultivate while napping.

Cultivate while working.

As long as he was alive, as long as resources were sufficient, as long as he had a single thought!

Spirit field cultivators had a lot of work and almost no time for cultivation. This situation wouldn't significantly improve even if they became outer disciples, because this was the rhythm of life in the Xuanfu Sect. But at this moment, all these problems ceased to exist for him! As long as he wanted to cultivate, doing some simple work while cultivating was absolutely not impossible.

And it wasn't just the Golden Radiance Art!

He even speculated that in the future, no matter what cultivation method or other ability, as long as he could successfully comprehend it into a skill and place it in a skill slot, it would all operate 100% automatically!

"This is truly... amazing!"

Ding Rui took a deep breath, so overwhelmed by surprise that he couldn't speak. It seemed he wasn't far from reaching the pinnacle of his life. After all, in this cultivation world, the strong would always be revered.

As for whether his new skill was truly useful in practice, Ding Rui could only judge for himself.

The managing cultivator felt the sharp aura of the Metal attribute emanating from Ding Rui's hand. His expression paused for a moment, then a smile appeared on his face. No matter what, as long as Ding Rui had cultivated it successfully, he could contribute to the sect, which was a good thing!

He nodded, took out a small bag of spirit rice, and handed it to Ding Rui, his tone becoming a little more cordial. "This reward for mastering a cultivation method can only be claimed once, and the first time the amount is relatively small; it won't last long. Make sure to take good care of the spiritual fields. The rewards issued by the sect after the harvest are the main prize. Work hard and ensure a good harvest."
