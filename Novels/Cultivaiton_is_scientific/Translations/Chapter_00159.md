# Chapter 159: Deploying the Formation  

Li Shiming was unaware of the events unfolding at Seven Stars Island. As he descended, he had already thrown out all thirty-six formation flags.  

By the time his feet touched the ground, he stood at the center of a formation.  

With a flick of his fingers, six mid-grade spirit stones were sent into the formation's nodes.  

There was no spirit vein here, and the formation intended for battle couldn't rely on the sparse ambient spiritual energy.  

As the six mid-grade spirit stones were placed, the thirty-six formation flags flashed and disappeared, giving rise to a grand formation around him—the *Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation*, a defensive formation of astonishing power.  

Recognizing the formation, the cultivators on both sides were momentarily stunned. This wasn't a pre-made formation disk but an actual deployment using formation flags, requiring real-time calculations to account for environmental variables.  

The chaotic spiritual energy field created by the two Golden Core cultivators made it nearly impossible for even an advanced formation master to quickly derive the necessary data to set up such a formation. Yet Li Shiming had done it with astonishing speed.  

With the *Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation* activated, Li Shiming felt much more at ease. At the very least, he was now in an invincible position.  

Upon learning that formations could be used in this operation, he had prepared suitable battle formations in advance.  

Thanks to his ample supply of spirit stones, he had crafted numerous formation flags, allowing him to deploy most formations as needed.  

Of course, these flags were made from first-grade materials, limiting their effectiveness.  

But a thirty-six-flag *Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation* was something no Qi Refinement cultivator could break—unless they used a talisman treasure.  

"Senior Brother He, won’t you join me inside the formation?" Li Shiming invited He Chuan after setting up the formation.  

"Since Junior Brother Li has invited me, how could I refuse?" He Chuan didn’t hesitate. Aware of the risks in this battle, he swiftly entered the formation.  

Li Shiming then glanced at Shang Haoquan. Though he didn’t speak, the invitation in his eyes was clear.  

"Thank you!" Shang Haoquan also didn’t hesitate, stepping into the formation as well.  

The battle began shortly after.  

Unlike military formations, cultivator battles didn’t emphasize strict formations. Their movements were too fast, and individual speeds varied, making rigid formations more of a hindrance for those who relied on agility.  

Thus, as soon as the fight started, the Qi Refinement cultivators engaged in one-on-one duels.  

Three Qi Refinement cultivators from the Northern Shu faction charged toward Li Shiming’s group. Clearly, the Northern Shu cultivators had planned their targets carefully.  

Even with the formation in place, the three Northern Shu cultivators showed no hesitation in their assault.  

"Junior Brother Li, these cultivators are far stronger than expected," He Chuan remarked with a frown, observing the battle from the safety of the formation.  

At first contact, the Seven Sects' cultivators were already being overwhelmed.  

The Northern Shu cultivators didn’t rely on any special techniques—they simply outmatched their opponents in every aspect, from artifact control to spiritual energy utilization.  

He Chuan wasn’t the only one who noticed. The Golden Core elders of Seven Stars Island saw it too.  

"As expected of Northern Shu cultivators—their foundation is far superior to ours," Elder Zhuo of the Demonic Spirit Sect sighed.  

"Northern Shu is vast, with a massive population and abundant resources. It’s no surprise they’re stronger than our Seven Sects. But I didn’t expect their Qi Refinement cultivators to suppress our elite disciples so thoroughly," Elder Gong added bitterly.  

The land occupied by the Seven Sects, though they called it a "continent," was known to outsiders as Tianhai Island—just a large island.  

This was a fact the Seven Sects avoided mentioning in their records or maps, a reluctant act of self-deception. Tianhai Island was isolated from the mainland by treacherous seas, with minimal contact.  

Even if they knew of the outside world, leaving Tianhai Island was nearly impossible.  

The Northern Shu cultivators had only come here because their homeland had become uninhabitable. Who would abandon a prosperous land for this backwater otherwise?  

And the cost had been high—a Golden Core sword cultivator, their strongest, had died just scouting the path. Even with Yun Xingyi guiding them, the journey had still incurred heavy losses.  

"Elder Yin, we must gather the Qi Refinement cultivators inside the formation. Otherwise, they stand no chance against the Northern Shu cultivators," Elder Gong urged.  

"Elder Yin, think of the bigger picture. If our cultivators fall, even Li Shiming’s formation won’t hold for long," Elder Sheng added quietly.  

After a moment of silence, Elder Yin nodded.  

Li Shiming effortlessly blocked the three Northern Shu cultivators with his *Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation*.  

"Senior Brothers, this formation allows us to attack from within. Feel free to use spells or artifacts," he said to He Chuan and Shang Haoquan, who had been watching idly.  

"That’s fantastic!" He Chuan’s eyes lit up as a small hammer flew out from his side.  

The hammer transformed into a massive phantom, smashing down on a Northern Shu cultivator.  

The Northern Shu cultivator dodged hastily. If He Chuan had been nearby, he could have countered easily. But from within the formation, retaliation was difficult.  

The hammer was a top-grade artifact, each strike equivalent to a peak Qi Refinement cultivator’s full-force attack.  

Shang Haoquan also unleashed his artifact—a whip, a rare choice among cultivators. In his hands, it moved like a serpent, entangling two other Northern Shu cultivators.  

"Shiming, let the other sect members enter the formation to fight together," Elder Yin’s voice transmitted into Li Shiming’s ear.  

Li Shiming surveyed the battlefield. Some Seven Sects cultivators were already at a disadvantage, while others were struggling. None held the upper hand.  

"Everyone, enter the formation! Let’s fight together!" Li Shiming called out, recognizing the Northern Shu cultivators' strength.  

At the same time, a streak of sword light shot from his hand, intercepting a Northern Shu cultivator fighting a young monk from the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect, giving the monk a chance to retreat.  

Seizing the opportunity, the monk hurled his bronze alms bowl at another nearby battle.  

Though the Northern Shu cultivators were strong, they couldn’t handle two elite opponents at once. The targeted cultivator retreated to avoid the heavy strike.  

The battlefield dynamics shifted instantly. The Seven Sects cultivators, all experienced, didn’t rush into the formation immediately. Instead, they helped each other disengage, buying time for everyone to regroup.  

They fended off the Northern Shu cultivators while retreating into the *Inverted Nine Palaces and Eight Trigrams Formation*.  

Only the Sacred Ice Sect cultivator hesitated. He knew of the conflict between Li Shiming and his sect—Li Shiming had taken the place of Du Bingyan, whom he had killed.  

His hesitation cost him.  

The Northern Shu cultivators, caught off guard by the Seven Sects' coordinated retreat, redirected their fury toward the lone Sacred Ice Sect cultivator left outside.  

The cultivator’s ice armor and top-grade defensive artifacts shattered instantly under the combined assault. He was pierced through and died on the spot.  

A Northern Shu cultivator retrieved his artifacts and storage pouch, waving them mockingly in a taunting gesture.  

The Sacred Ice Sect elder watching the battle looked grim, mourning the loss of another talented disciple while fuming at his hesitation.  

Despite being down one cultivator, the Seven Sects now had the upper hand.  

Inside the formation, they could attack freely while the Northern Shu cultivators' assaults were blocked. Unless the formation was broken, they were untouchable.  

"Break!" A Northern Shu cultivator hurled a talisman at the formation.  

Li Shiming sensed its peculiar nature and sent his sword light to intercept it. But the talisman transformed into a burst of energy the moment it was thrown, impossible to block.  

The talisman struck the formation, causing it to tremble.  

"Junior Brother Li, it’s a *Formation-Breaking Talisman*!" He Chuan warned.  

Li Shiming could already feel the talisman disrupting the formation’s spiritual energy pathways, attempting to force errors and collapse it.  

Without him inside, the talisman might have succeeded.  

A *Formation-Breaking Talisman* was essentially a sealed fragment of a formation master’s calculations, requiring rare materials and personal sacrifice to create. The more powerful the talisman, the rarer it was.  

Given that these were elite Qi Refinement cultivators, such a talisman wasn’t surprising.  

Li Shiming estimated its creator was a top-tier advanced formation master.  

His spiritual sense swept through the formation, stabilizing the disrupted energy. The talisman’s effects were neutralized within seconds.  

After five seconds of failing to break the formation, the talisman’s energy dissipated.  

The Northern Shu cultivators paled. If the Seven Sects could fight from within the formation, this would turn into a war of attrition.  

The Seven Sects cultivators could rest or even sleep inside, while the Northern Shu cultivators would tire.  

Worse, the Seven Sects could focus their attacks, overwhelming individual Northern Shu cultivators.  

The Northern Shu side had no choice but to retreat beyond the formation’s hundred-meter range.  

"Thank you, Junior Brother Li!" The Seven Sects cultivators finally had a chance to express their gratitude.  

In a large-scale battle like this, a sturdy formation was invaluable.  

After exchanging thanks, they began strategizing.  

"The Northern Shu cultivators are individually stronger. In a one-on-one fight, I’d lose within minutes," the Ten Thousand Buddha Sect monk admitted gravely.  

"The formation protects us but doesn’t guarantee victory," He Chuan said with a frown.  

"If anyone has hidden techniques, now’s the time to use them. This battle is to the death," another cultivator added.  

Li Shiming observed the two Profound Nether Sect cultivators, each accompanied by a top-tier bronze corpse.  

In their duels, they had held out the longest, effectively fighting two against one.  

Seeing his gaze, the Profound Nether Sect cultivators assumed he was prompting them.  

"We can detonate our bronze corpses. The explosion would be equivalent to a mid-stage Foundation Establishment strike, but we’d suffer backlash, reducing our combat strength by half," one explained frankly.  

Two detonations could wipe out several Northern Shu cultivators.  

"But after the battle, we’ll need intact corpses from the enemy," the other added.  

This was understandable—bronze corpses were vital to the Profound Nether Sect, and high-quality materials were scarce.  

The requirement for heavenly spiritual roots meant they were essentially competing with other sects for top disciples.  

Li Shiming was surprised his casual observation had been misinterpreted.  

He underestimated his influence. At this moment, his formation had saved all the Seven Sects cultivators, making them more receptive to his suggestions.
