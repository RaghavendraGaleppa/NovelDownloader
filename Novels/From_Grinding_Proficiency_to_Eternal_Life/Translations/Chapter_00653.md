# Chapter 653: Nine is the Limit

Within the Dantian Cavern Heaven, ninety-nine strands of purple-gold Immortal Gold Nature roared like ninety-nine ancient divine dragons, constantly converging to unleash a power that exceeded Xu Yunfan's imagination.

"Nine is the limit. This is enough. If we continue, problems might arise instead," Zhang Ziyang's voice sounded by Xu Yunfan's ear.

Xu Yunfan had no time to respond at this moment; he was carefully sensing the surging vital energy within his body.

It seemed that a quantitative change had triggered a qualitative one. The power within him was rapidly ascending, and his own cultivation base was leaping upward continuously.

On his vision, the attribute panel's notification messages were flickering and refreshing non-stop.

The vast and boundless Immortal Implication seemed as if it would burst out of his body.

Xu Yunfan's Dao Foundation was being rapidly solidified.

The nascent imagery of the Divine Thunder's destruction of all laws and the Indestructible Profound Vault had never been clearer in his mind than at this moment.

Even faintly, there was a trend of it condensing from nothingness into substantial Dao patterns.

A mighty aura, desiring to break through the Foundation Establishment barrier and point directly to the Golden Core Great Dao, surged toward the heavens.

However, just at this moment of impending success.

A terrifying fluctuation, far surpassing anything before and causing the entire Aitila World to tremble violently, erupted from the very core of the battlefield.

The three Main Gods were attacking Zhenjun Qingyuan.

Having their wills toyed with and deflected by Zhenjun Qingyuan, and witnessing Xu Yunfan harvesting wildly right under their noses, these always high-and-mighty Main Gods were extremely furious.

How dare these foreign demons be so brazen!

Using them as nourishment!

Nature, Darkness, Light.

Three types of divine power with completely different attributes but all reaching the peak of this world, under the combined force of the three Main Gods, forcibly resonated and merged in the void.

A three-colored divine punishment spear, entwined with dark currents and containing a storm's eye, an extreme cold ice core, and a holy flame that burned the world, took form with the加持 of the Heavenly Dao.

The divine power of the Main Gods of Darkness, Nature, and Light, like a world-ending torrent, slammed toward Zhenjun Qingyuan.

The barrier formed by the Qingqi of the Immortal Palace trembled violently. Although Zhenjun Qingyuan's expression was grave, he had to go all out to deal with it.

This place was Aitila's native land. The three Main Gods received the加持 of the Heavenly Dao's authority, and their strength could not be underestimated. Even though Zhenjun Qingyuan's power of Dao Fruit had a higher upper limit, he was ultimately only at the initial stage of Golden Core. At this moment, he had to be cautious and naturally had no spare energy to lock onto Xu Yunfan.

Seizing this opportunity, Xu Yunfan did not hesitate. The Void Crossing Boat instantly appeared in his palm.

Having had the experience of traversing the界海 once, he had a clear understanding of the Chaos Birth and Destruction Mystic Light within the界海 that was enough to annihilate Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Relying on his own attainment in artifact refinement, he had improved the array patterns etched on the boat's surface, greatly increasing its safety. This time, crossing the界海 was no longer like a headless fly like before.

His divine sense swept over the edge of the chaotic battlefield, and Xu Yunfan accurately captured the concealed Zhang Ziyang.

He操控 the Void Crossing Boat stealthily to Zhang Ziyang's side and said in a low voice, "Patriarch, it is time to leave!"

Zhang Ziyang, however, slightly shook his head. The silver star in his brow, symbolizing the authority of investigation, flickered slightly as he pointed to the devastated world.

"This world, on the contrary, is of great benefit to me."

His speech was extremely fast, carrying a long-lost excitement.

"Aitila's coordinates have already been discovered by the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. Zhenjun Qingyuan merely used your karma to descend first, acting as a vanguard. More Zhenjun will surely come at the news! This place will become a chaotic vortex of gods in混战 and faith collapsing. It is the perfect breeding ground for me to achieve the Dao of Incense Fire Divinity! The Mystic Spirit Transformation God Dao I cultivate precisely requires such troubled times to accumulate vast amounts of willpower."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan instantly understood Zhang Ziyang's plan.

He no longer insisted, merely solemnly admonishing, "Patriarch, be careful in all things!"

A gentle yet confident smile appeared on Zhang Ziyang's face, and he reminded in return, "You still need to be careful. The界海 is perilous and unpredictable, and the Taihua Spirit Ruins World is not a pure land either. Those Golden Core Zhenjun..."

He paused, his eyes filled with expectation. "I hope that when you return to this world next time, I can see you achieve the honor of Golden Core Zhenjun."

Xu Yunfan stood at the bow of the boat, sensing the surging, immense power of the ninety-nine strands of Immortal Gold Nature roaring within his Dantian Cavern Heaven, and the imagery of "Divine Thunder's destruction of all laws, the Indestructible Profound Vault carrying all heavens" so clear it was almost forming substantial Dao patterns. A smile curled at the corners of his mouth.

"Patriarch, rest assured. Upon returning this time, it will be to achieve Golden Core in one fell swoop!"

He needed to return to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World.

Only in that land that nurtured the Divine Thunder Jade Clarity Nine宸 Profound Vault Ten Thousand Transformations Indestructible Dao Fruit, when his imagery completely solidified, could he, with the most majestic momentum, attract the favor of the Dao Fruit.

This was a heaven-defying opportunity that he could not give up.

Moreover, with the indestructible foundation forged by his ninety-nine strands of Immortal Gold Nature, coupled with his exceptionally clear imagery, it was highly likely that he would succeed in one go. Not only could he achieve the position of a Great Perfected one at the peak of Foundation Establishment, but he could also use the power of this Dao Fruit to cross that great chasm.

To achieve Golden Core!

After hearing this, Zhang Ziyang sincerely praised and wished him well.

"Good! Seeking the Golden Core Dao with ninety-nine strands of Gold Nature, the number one Foundation Establishment cultivator from ancient times to the present! I hope for your success!"

Their conversation, amidst the thunderous collision of divine power behind them that seemed to destroy the heavens and the earth, was completed in an instant.

Xu Yunfan had no more hesitation and immediately全力催动 the Void Crossing Boat.

Dark light flared. The spatial array patterns carved on the Void Crossing Boat glowed with brilliance. The bow of the boat, like a sharp blade, pierced towards Aitila's already unstable world barrier.

Just a piercing tearing sound was heard. The world barrier was forcibly torn open. The Void Crossing Boat transformed into a dark stream of light, carrying Xu Yunfan as it instantly plunged into the violent, chaotic, and mystic light-rampant界海 Chaos.

On the boat's surface were the Heaven-Eroding Talismans that Xu Yunfan had carefully inscribed, resonating with his own perfected Cavern Erosion Heaven Talisman, which could precisely deflect the Chaos Birth and Destruction Mystic Light capable of annihilating Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Having had an experience of traversal, Xu Yunfan's操控 of the Void Crossing Boat had reached a superb realm. Although there were still dangers, it was much more composed than last time.

Perhaps an instant, perhaps several months.

The界海 has no time; one does not know the years.

Xu Yunfan only knew the coordinates and traveled towards that方位.

After不知 how long, the Void Crossing Boat trembled slightly.

Xu Yunfan's spirit was lifted.

He had returned!

As soon as he stepped into the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, the familiar, pure spiritual energy surged like a tide into his limbs and bones, instantly smoothing the depletion of magical power and the exhaustion of his soul brought about by forcibly activating secret techniques in Aitila.

Xu Yunfan put away the Void Crossing Boat and casually found a mountain peak to stand on in the wilderness. He greedily inhaled and exhaled the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. The pores all over his body opened up, and the Divine Thunder magical power operated on its own, like a long drought receiving sweet rain.

A long while later, he slowly opened his eyes, feeling immensely satisfied.

"That cursed place Aitila, its energy is impure and violent. Refining it is a task with twice the effort for half the result, far inferior to even one ten-thousandth of this world."

His thoughts raced. The magnificent Dao Foundation forged by his ninety-nine strands of Immortal Gold Nature and the clear imagery of "Divine Thunder's destruction of all laws, the Indestructible Profound Vault carrying all heavens" surged within the nascent Dantian Cavern Heaven.

The time had come; it could not wait any longer.

Now that Zhenjun Qingyuan was tied down in Aitila, then, as long as he started the preparations laid down previously, the chance of success would be greatly increased.
