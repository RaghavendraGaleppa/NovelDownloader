# Chapter 45: Overwhelming the Enemy with Awe-Inspiring Might  

Two quarters of an hour later, the spiritual energy in Lin Shan's body had recovered from one-fifth to three-fifths of its capacity.  

Still feeling it wasn't enough, he continued.  

After half an hour, the spirit stone in his hand crumbled into dust as its energy was exhausted. Lin Shan slowly opened his eyes.  

Now, his dantian was brimming with spiritual energy, filling him with confidence.  

At his peak, he could unleash over a hundred Wind Blade spells. Against a thousand enemies, he could indeed carve a bloody path through them! Moreover, unlike the Southern Immortal Master, who was limited to close combat and forced to endure attacks passively, Lin Shan wasn't so constrained.  

Of course, he believed that metal-attribute cultivators must have long-range spells. However, judging by the Southern Immortal Master's reliance only on Golden Spear techniques and explosive throwing attacks—and his sister's sole use of Fireball spells—they were likely impoverished rogue cultivators with incomplete combat methods, which was why they had been overwhelmed by mortal martial artists.  

Most importantly, Lin Shan, a cultivator, had been assisting with sneak attacks from the sidelines. Otherwise, even if the enemy's numbers had doubled, it was uncertain whether they could have killed the Southern Immortal Master.  

But now, with his full strength restored, these people no longer stood a chance.  

If there had been an opportunity, it would have been the moment he had boldly stepped forward. Had they united with the momentum of just having slain the Southern Immortal Master and turned their combined force against him, they might have had a real chance.  

But human nature is selfish, greedy, complex, and fickle. All the innate masters belonged to different factions—how could they possibly be of one mind?  

One person's hesitation would spread to all!  

Hesitation leads to defeat.  

……  

Lin Shan chuckled softly. Now at his peak, it was time to break the stalemate.  

Surveying the surrounding gazes filled with mixed emotions, he declared loudly, "You've all been standing here for so long—neither advancing nor retreating."  

"Are you waiting for me to personally hand over the Vermilion Fruit to you?"  

His voice, amplified by spiritual energy, echoed far and wide, resounding across the cold pond and its surroundings for a mile.  

The crowd remained silent, a growing sense of resignation settling over them.  

The innate masters exchanged glances, each inwardly lamenting their lack of unity.  

But none were willing to retreat just like that.  

Having risked their lives and paid a heavy price to kill the Southern Immortal Master, withdrawing now would mean all their efforts had been in vain—merely paving the way for Lin Shan's gain.  

Yet, staying here and facing the white-robed immortal master, who was clearly at his peak, left them too afraid to act!  

At that moment, an unfamiliar voice suddenly chimed in, stirring the pot.  

"Our immortal master is graciously sparing your lives—showing you mercy! Don't throw that mercy back in his face! As for the Vermilion Fruit, it is a treasure of the immortal path, never meant for the likes of you. Scram!"  

Lin Shan turned to see it was the Jiangling Nightingale Branch Leader. The man immediately flashed an obsequious smile when Lin Shan looked his way. Lin Shan gave him an approving nod.  

Jiang the Protector couldn't stand idly by. He cursed the Nightingale Branch Leader inwardly for his shamelessness—a dignified innate master groveling so openly in front of his subordinates.  

But his body betrayed his thoughts as he stepped forward and added, "Indeed! Consider the fallen innate masters. Don't throw your lives away for greed."  

The innate masters on the opposing side wavered. Before long, one of them led his men away from the cold pond, retreating into the distance.  

It was the leader of the Flying Blade Sect, Ren Wuyou.  

His son, Ren Wukuang, kept tugging at his sleeve, urging him to leave. The sect's red-clad members behind them were all unsettled, silently resolving to drill their forces harder upon returning.  

Especially Ren Wukuang! His father had given him such a bold name, yet his courage remained lacking.  

Wait—was it because of the "reverse psychology" naming?  

As he left, the Flying Blade Sect leader couldn't help but wonder suspiciously.  

……  

As the saying goes, where one leads, others follow. With the Flying Blade Sect setting the precedent, two more sects soon withdrew. As their numbers dwindled, the remaining factions lost confidence in competing for the Vermilion Fruit and began leaving one after another.  

Soon, more than half had departed. Only a few, like the Nine Counties Constable of Jingxiang and other peak innate masters, remained. But as their allies continued to leave, even they had no choice but to abandon their hopes and retreat reluctantly.  

……  

"Immortal Master, I shall lead my men to follow and monitor them, ensuring they don't set up an ambush ahead. Once they've truly left the island by boat, I'll send a signal to notify you," the Jiangling Nightingale Branch Leader offered considerately.  

Lin Shan nodded repeatedly. This branch leader was thoughtful and meticulous—a rare talent.  

Glancing sidelong at Jiang the Protector, Lin Shan wondered if it was time to replace his current follower.  

Jiang the Protector caught the look and felt a sudden chill. Sensing impending replacement, he hastily volunteered to join the scouting mission.  

Lin Shan waved them off, and the two led the black-clad assassists in pursuit of the departing sects.  

Alone, Lin Shan sighed inwardly. Truly, the early bird gets the worm, but the cautious survive. What a pity for the Southern Immortal Master—a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator with his sister's assistance—to be the first one eliminated.  

……  

From dusk when they entered the island until now, nearing the second watch of the night, twilight had deepened.  

About half an hour later, a signal flare streaked into the night sky like a shooting star before fading away.  

Lin Shan recognized it as the Nightingale's unique signal, indicating all was clear.  

Gathering wind spiritual energy beneath his feet, he leaped toward the cold pond.  

As a wind-attribute cultivator, light-footed techniques were child's play to him. Tricks like the Dragonfly Skimming Water were effortless.  

Lin Shan bounded across the water's surface in a series of leaps, but before he could make much progress, a school of fish suddenly surged from the depths.  

Their spined backs shimmered under the moonlight, scales glinting white. Their gaping mouths revealed rows of razor-sharp teeth as they unleashed a barrage of water arrows infused with spiritual energy.  

"Damn it!"  

Lin Shan, mid-leap, nearly lost his balance in shock.  

He hastily redirected his wind spiritual energy, dodging to the side.  

But the relentless fish blocked his path, showering him with another volley of water arrows.  

"Persistent little bastards!"  

With a snarl, Lin Shan retaliated with Wind Blade spells, trading blows with the aquatic assailants.  

……  

About ten breaths later, a thoroughly drenched Lin Shan hauled himself onto the small island at the pond's center.  

Behind him, the water's surface gradually became littered with floating fish carcasses.  

Gasping for breath, Lin Shan shuddered at the close call. After exhausting his spells, he had lost his footing and plunged into the water—after all, he couldn't fly yet.  

To his dismay, the pond held far more fish than he'd expected. His Wind Blades could only penetrate about three meters underwater before losing effectiveness. In the end, he had to resort to a combination of spellcasting and desperate dog-paddling to reach the island.  

"No wonder none of those martial artists tried to snatch the Vermilion Fruit earlier—they'd all end up as fish food."  

Though he understood now, Lin Shan still wondered how the Twelve连环坞 had discovered the fruit in the first place.  

But solutions always outnumbered obstacles. Lin Shan dismissed the thought and focused on the plant before him.  

It was verdant and lush, crowned with a four-petaled exotic flower. At its center rested a fruit streaked red and blue, surrounded by a faint, condensed aura of water spiritual energy.  

This had to be the legendary Vermilion Fruit of martial arts fame!
