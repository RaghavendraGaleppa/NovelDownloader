# Chapter 401: Descending into the Tomb (1/2)

"???"

The atmosphere in the entire hall fell silent for an instant. Everyone watched as Li Mo, as if no one else existed, took Han Xianzi's other hand as well. Their expressions varied, but most were completely stunned.

*For safety, my foot.*

*How does the entrance to this underground palace look anything like it has a teleportation array?*

Among the crowd, the disciples of Hengyun Sword City remained expressionless and silently took a few steps back.

"Senior Sister, shouldn't we go greet Young Master Li?"

Wei Zhaoliu was momentarily dazed. Her hair had already grown back to ear-length.

Well, since Ying Bing wasn't at Hengyun Sword City, she no longer needed to shave her head every day to show her determination.

She turned around and saw that her junior brothers had all turned into complete strangers. She found it strange, after all, she thought Li Mo was a pretty good guy.

"Senior Sister, aren't you full?"

Wu Chushu grimaced, feeling a sour pain in his gums.

"Why would you feel sour?"

"Can't you smell the sour and stinky smell of that dog food? And you still want to go up and eat it?"

"What is dog food?"

Wei Zhaoliu looked completely bewildered.

It was Bai Jinghong who understood this sword-crazy senior sister better. He said seriously, "Senior Sister, when you see Miss Ying Bing make her move later, you won't be able to keep your hair."

"..."

Wei Zhaoliu fell silent for a moment, then nodded.

"Going up to greet them now would indeed be inappropriate."

Not long after, a foul wind suddenly blew from the deep entrance of the underground palace, and faintly, there were ferocious, inhuman roars.

"What sound was that?"

Whoever heard the sound felt a chill run down their spine.

For a moment, many people swallowed hard, looking at the dark entrance of the underground palace as if it were a beast ready to devour them.

"Let us enter."

Jiang Yu was the first to step into the entrance of the underground palace.

Tan Zhuyin had initially been afraid of the dangers inside and unwilling to be the one to test the waters. But now, seeing that Jiang Yu had gone in, he feared the other would get there first.

Thus, he gave Li Mo a sinister look and also led his people into the underground palace.

"That sound... it wouldn't be zombies, would it?"

Li Mo mused while holding the Ice Cube's hand.

"Zombies? That term isn't quite accurate," Ying Bing said softly, shaking her head.

"That's right. To be precise, it's a special kind among zombies."

A voice suddenly sounded from behind.

Li Mo raised an eyebrow. For some reason, hearing this voice made him angry. He was supposed to be a gentle gentleman, so why did this voice alone make him so annoyed?

"We meet again, Young Master Li."

Tian Miao revealed a pale-faced smile.

"You... how did you get here?"

"I followed the guidance of the heavens and arrived by your side."

Tian Miao spoke in riddles from the very start, and in a particularly infuriating way.

"Young Master Li, you might find the alias on the Hidden Dragon List unpleasant to hear, but that was my Master's intention. She pays attention to karma, so there must be a reason for her to do so."

Li Mo narrowed his eyes. "You'd better have a good reason for looking for me."

Riddle-solvers were truly讨厌 (annoying).

What was even more troublesome was that this riddle-solver wasn't just putting on airs; she genuinely had real skills.

"I wish to explore the tomb, so I want to join you," Tian Miao said seriously.

"Then why don't you follow the Crown Prince instead? Why follow us?"

"No, following you is better."

"Then give me a reason why I should let you follow."

Li Mo was afraid he might not be able to hold back and take out his Forty-meter-long Blade to give her a good whack on the back of the head.

"I am sufficiently knowledgeable, and I am well-versed in the Five Elements, Feng Shui, and机关 (mechanism) techniques. I can also divine good and bad fortune."

Tian Miao pointed to the deep cave entrance.

"For instance, the 'Ba' inside the tomb."

---

"Ba?"

Tian Miao began to speak unhurriedly, recounting ancient knowledge.

Such beings are neither demons, nor ghosts, nor living creatures. They are bodies without a soul, preserved from decay by the nourishment of Spiritual Evil Qi, and driven by unwillingness or lingering obsessions in their hearts.

Ordinary zombies usually absorb the essence of the sun and moon. However, in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, they have been extinct for a long time.

Ba, on the other hand, absorbs Spiritual Evil Qi, growing increasingly powerful and giving birth to all sorts of supernatural abilities.

For example, the kind that causes a great drought as soon as it appears is called a Hanba (Drought Demon), which is also the most well-known type.

There are also Huoba (Fire Demon) that ignite raging fires, and Diba (Earth Demon) that cause mountains to shake and the earth to tremble.

But the most troublesome for humanity is the Jiba (Famine Demon), which causes a great famine as soon as it appears in the world...

"Stop! I get the idea. Welcome to the team."

Li Mo waved his hand, indicating there was no need to say more.

The Destiny Divine Eye终究 (after all) has its limitations. It can only see people, or at least beings that have taken a human form, like Senior Brother Xiaobao...

He hadn't been idle just now either, using the Destiny Divine Eye to look over everyone present.

Among them, the ones worth remembering were the few from Hengyun Sword City, and several investment targets with blue, blue mixed with purple, and even pure purple destinies.

Of course, there was also one who was targeting him.

【Name: Zhu Renji】
【Age: 56】
【Physique: Yin-Yang Hidden Killing Body.】
【Realm: Outer Scene First Heaven.】
【Destiny: Blue mixed with Purple】
【Evaluation: Suffered from an eye disease from a young age and was mocked by others. At the age of ten, he killed those who mocked him. At thirteen, he became a bandit, but was later expelled for often不分敵我 (not distinguishing between friend and foe). Coincidentally, the Rain Pavilion had a trial for undercover agents, so he joined them.

Later, he successfully assassinated the eldest son of the Thunderbolt Fortress, earning the江湖 (Jianghu) moniker '不分人畜，雞犬不留' (Sparing neither humans nor livestock, chickens nor dogs). He heard that the Yin-Yang Hall of the Summoning Demon Cult could cure all kinds of疑难雜症 (difficult and miscellaneous diseases), so he left the Rain Pavilion and joined the Summoning Demon Cult.】

From bandit to assassin to a member of a demonic cult.

My, his life was getting more and more "criminal."

【Recent Events: Received two side jobs, both to assassinate Li Mo and Ying Bing. Decided to take both contracts.】

"Outer Scene Realm..."

Li Mo watched the other's back disappear into the entrance of the underground palace.

A moment later, those who remained were mostly hesitant Jianghu wanderers.

Li Mo also put away his little notebook, and the three of them descended into the underground palace together.

*At first, it was extremely narrow, just wide enough for a person...*

Well, the entrance was actually quite large, but the dark space made it seem even more vast and empty. So many people had entered just now, but now you couldn't even hear footsteps.

Only the footsteps of the three of them echoed, so quiet you could hear your own heartbeat.

Li Mo took out a night pearl, dispelling the thick darkness.

As far as the eye could see, there was still no sign of anyone.

"Where did all those people go?"

Li Mo couldn't help but mutter to himself.

Tian Miao pondered for a moment and said, "They are not in the same underground palace."

"?"

Li Mo turned back to look at the entrance of the underground palace, only to find that it had turned pitch black behind them, without a single ray of light.

Ying Bing's hand gripped her sword. "This underground palace... is moving."

A moving maze?

This underground palace, which had been buried deep underground for many years, was still moving to this day?

"We should be heading for the main burial chamber."

Little Li Xuesheng thought of the tomb-raiding novels he had read in his previous life.

Tian Miao looked at him with surprise and nodded. The hair ornaments on her head made a slight sound.

"What we need to confirm now is which period this tomb belongs to."

"The layout and structure of great tombs from different eras are vastly different, let alone the fact that this underground palace is still moving."

Tian Miao's eyes lit up with excitement.

"If we can't find the solution to this place, then..."

"We might be trapped here forever, never to see the light of day again."

Li Mo: "?"

So why are you so excited about that?
