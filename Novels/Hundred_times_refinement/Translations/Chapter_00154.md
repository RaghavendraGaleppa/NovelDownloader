# Chapter 102: Pill Formation  

A flash of surprise crossed Lin Xuan's face, but it quickly gave way to understanding.  

Among low-level cultivators, he was considered quite knowledgeable, yet this was the first time he had encountered a defensive spirit artifact. In a way, such artifacts were even more valuable than offensive ones.  

"Learn to endure blows before learning to strike."  

This saying from the mortal martial world also applied to the cultivation realm. Battles between cultivators were far more perilous—a single misstep could mean death, with one's head severed before they knew it.  

Thus, before engaging in combat, both sides would layer themselves with various protections: spiritual barriers, defensive talismans, and even higher-level spirit artifact shields.  

No matter how profound one's cultivation or how refined their techniques, without any defense, a single strike from the opponent could spell instant death.  

Among defensive measures, shields formed by spirit artifacts were naturally the strongest, making them highly sought after. However, aside from top-grade spirit artifacts that could inherently generate shields, artifacts of other grades typically had more singular attributes.  

Defensive spirit artifacts were also relatively harder to forge, so it was no surprise Lin Xuan had never seen one before.  

But upon further reflection, this was Youzhou, where the level of cultivation was higher, and the opponent had reached the peak of the Spirit Movement stage. Possessing a defensive spirit artifact didn't seem too far-fetched.  

These thoughts raced through Lin Xuan's mind in an instant, yet his hands never paused. Seeing the fiery rain blocked by the spirit artifact, he swiftly formed another hand seal and directed it toward the formation.  

One divided into two, two into four, four into eight—the Eight Trigrams pattern in the sky began to shift. Though its size diminished, its numbers multiplied.  

Instead of raining fire, it now shot out crimson beams of light.  

Tan Ming's expression darkened. He formed a hand seal and pointed at the floral-patterned cloth above his head. The spirit artifact instantly transformed into a spherical shield, enveloping him completely.  

As a peak Spirit Movement stage cultivator, Tan Ming had already deduced that he was trapped in a formation talisman. Unlike formations set up with flags or disks, talisman-based formations had much weaker energy reserves.  

From the current situation, it seemed the person inside was either at a critical juncture in their cultivation or otherwise unable to act freely, only able to spare a sliver of spiritual power to drive the formation. Once the talisman's energy was exhausted, Tan Ming could still kill and plunder as intended.  

Lin Xuan observed Tan Ming's expression through his spiritual sense. With a flip of his hand, he produced another talisman—this one slightly larger than usual, depicting a vividly drawn bird.  

A beast talisman!  

A top-grade first-tier spirit beast's power was equivalent to that of a peak Spirit Movement stage cultivator. The Skysoar Bird sealed within this talisman had failed to advance to the next tier, making it even more formidable. Dealing with this scheming intruder shouldn't be a problem.  

Lin Xuan channeled his spiritual power into the talisman.  

A clear, resonant cry rang out as the beast soul talisman erupted with intense light. A massive, three-eyed, single-clawed bird materialized.  

"Go!" Lin Xuan pointed at the Skysoar Bird.  

Meanwhile, outside the cave.  

Countless crimson beams rained down like a storm. Tan Ming poured his spiritual power into his spirit artifact, barely managing to hold his ground. Though strained, his expression was one of triumph.  

The ferocity of the attack suggested his opponent was desperate to finish him off quickly. If he could endure this onslaught and deplete the formation talisman's energy, he could break through the barrier and storm the cave to claim his prize.  

The thought that the cultivator inside might be a Foundation Establishment expert—helplessly at his mercy due to being at a critical juncture in their cultivation—filled Tan Ming with malicious glee.  

"Just a little longer," he muttered to himself, licking his lips, his eyes gleaming with greed and cruelty.  

Suddenly, a clear cry pierced the air, parting the darkness as the three-eyed, single-clawed bird swooped toward him.  

"What is this?!" Tan Ming's face paled as he sensed the overwhelming spiritual pressure radiating from the creature. Its power was nearly on par with an early Foundation Establishment cultivator!  

Watching Tan Ming's terror, Lin Xuan smirked and drew a small black banner from his robes. Instantly, a chilling wind howled as dozens of disheaved ghosts surged forth from the Hundred Souls Banner.  

"Go!"  

Lin Xuan pointed at the ghosts. Truthfully, the Eight Trigrams Formation and the Skysoar Bird alone were enough to eliminate Tan Ming. However, the beast talisman's energy was finite, and Tan Ming was a peak Spirit Movement stage cultivator. To minimize the talisman's depletion, Lin Xuan summoned the ghosts as well.  

Listening to the intruder's panicked cries, Lin Xuan remained impassive. With his current strength and arsenal, eliminating a cultivator of the same level was hardly a challenge.  

Men die for wealth, birds perish for food. Those who let greed guide them must be prepared to face the consequences.  

Lin Xuan refocused on the pill refinement. He retrieved an Earthfire Talisman...  

Half an hour later.  

A soothing medicinal fragrance wafted through the cave. A flicker of joy crossed Lin Xuan's face, but it was soon replaced by solemnity.  

This was the critical moment of pill formation—no room for carelessness. After a brief hesitation, Lin Xuan summoned the Jade Snow Ring, channeling his spiritual power into it. Soon, a pure white flame flickered to life in the air.  

Innate Flame!  

A technique only Foundation Establishment experts could wield, but with the aid of a top-grade spirit artifact, Lin Xuan managed it—albeit at a tremendous spiritual cost.  

Compared to Earthfire, the Innate Flame was far more suited for pill refinement.  

With the success of the top-grade Marrow Cleansing Pill at stake, Lin Xuan had no choice but to go all out.  

Balancing the flame's output with the pill's refinement, another half-hour passed before a thunderous boom echoed through the cave. Spiritual energy erupted, blowing the cauldron's lid clean off.  

Rather than alarmed, Lin Xuan was elated. Ignoring his exhaustion, he sent forth a beam of white light, which coiled around the cauldron and drew it back to him.  

The cave filled with an intoxicating aroma. Examining the pill, Lin Xuan's eyebrows rose. Its color, scent, and even the faint glow on its surface matched the ancient records perfectly. A pill with heaven-defying effects indeed lived up to its legend.  

After admiring it for a moment, Lin Xuan carefully stored the Marrow Cleansing Pill and the cauldron. He then sat cross-legged, gripping a spirit stone in each hand to replenish his energy.  

Unlike absorbing ambient spiritual energy, using spirit stones was far quicker. Within a quarter-hour, Lin Xuan's reserves were fully restored.  

The two mid-grade spirit stones had dimmed. Smiling faintly, Lin Xuan exited the cave.  

The Eight Trigrams Formation's energy was nearly depleted, and the Skysoar Bird appeared weary. Lin Xuan was slightly surprised—Tan Ming had been stronger than expected.  

Regardless, the intruder was now dead, his corpse lying on the ground.  

Lin Xuan pointed a finger, and a translucent soul emerged from the body, staring fearfully at the young man. "Spare me, fellow Daoist! This was all a misunderstanding—I meant no harm!"  

"Still lying?" Lin Xuan scoffed.  

"Please, I beg you! My body is already destroyed—all that's left is this wisp of a soul. Have mercy!"  

Lin Xuan remained unmoved. It wasn't cruelty but pragmatism—sparing an enemy was inviting future trouble. He had no intention of leaving loose ends.  

He retrieved the Hundred Souls Banner.  

"A demonic artifact?!" The soul shrieked, trying to flee, but trapped within the formation, it was like a fly in a jar.  

Dark mist billowed from the banner, ensnaring the soul...  

A flash of black light later, the banner's sinister aura thickened. Lin Xuan nodded in satisfaction. Adding a cultivator's soul had slightly enhanced its power.  

Lin Xuan had no desire to kill indiscriminately, but he saw no issue in using his enemies' souls to strengthen his tools.  

According to the demonic cultivation manual, the Hundred Souls Banner was a growth-type artifact—its power would increase with each soul it absorbed.  

After tidying up, Lin Xuan surveyed the cave. It was no longer safe to stay.  

Today's intruder had been a low-level cultivator, but had it been a Foundation Establishment expert, the outcome could have been disastrous. Though he'd escaped unscathed, the incident served as a stark reminder—cultivation was fraught with peril, and disruptions could be fatal. If he hoped to break through his bottleneck, he'd need to find a more secure location.  

"Return."  

Lin Xuan pointed at the Skysoar Bird, which dissolved back into a crimson talisman. He then collected Tan Ming's storage pouch. While he had no shortage of spirit stones, the spirit artifacts—especially the floral-patterned defensive cloth—were precisely what he needed.  

Summoning his flying sword, Lin Xuan unleashed a brilliant flash of light. With a deafening roar, the entire mountain collapsed into rubble.  

No trace remained of the cultivator who had once trained here—nor of Tan Ming's corpse. Satisfied, Lin Xuan transformed into a streak of azure light and vanished into the horizon.
