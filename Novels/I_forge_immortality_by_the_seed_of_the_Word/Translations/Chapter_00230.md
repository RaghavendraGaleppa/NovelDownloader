# Chapter 228: Heavenly Construct Ghostgod Number Twenty-Four, Greetings, Sir

"Hiss—what a terrifying saber strike!"

Among the many loose cultivators standing on the periphery, some slowly came back to their senses, belatedly sucking in a cold breath as they exclaimed in awe. Even though a considerable amount of time had passed, the trajectory of that saber strike remained deeply etched in everyone's minds, impossible to erase.

Suddenly, someone seemed to remember something and couldn't help but look at the cultivators from Sanyuan City around them, saying faintly: "Are you truly certain that person is a Core Formation realm grand cultivator? Excuse me, which Core Formation realm cultivator can unleash such power? That was clearly an Existential Dharma Idol realm being!"

Faced with this question, the many loose cultivators from Sanyuan City immediately exchanged bewildered glances. For a moment, they were at a loss for words.

"What exactly is the identity of this 'Jade Young Master'? That person who just came from the Dongming Blessed Land within the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect seemed very respectful towards him." A voice full of doubt rang out, instantly causing everyone to fall into contemplation.

Meanwhile, among the crowd, four Core Formation realm cultivators gathered, subtly led by a black-robed man. This man was none other than the cultivator who had sat beside Zhang Jing at the Immortal Ascension Banquet in Sanyuan City Lord's Estate. He stared intently at the spot where Zhang Jing had just been, waves of shock surging in his heart.

"Was that... truly Fellow Daoist Zhang? Who exactly is he?!" Recalling the words he had spoken to the other party back then, the black-robed man couldn't help but blush, his old face reddening. He wished he could dig a hole on the spot and bury himself.

On the other side, the three from the Yellow Sand Dharma World carefully approached the golden-robed man, Huang Jiulong, and asked cautiously, "Excuse me, Senior Brother, who was that person just now?" Behind them, Qi Lianyuan, who had only recently joined the Dao Sect, quietly perked up his ears to listen. He was particularly concerned about this. After all, he had just tried to recruit this Jade Young Master for Sanyuan City at the Immortal Ascension Banquet. Yet, who would have thought? The other party appeared to only have Core Formation realm cultivation, but when he truly acted, his power was terrifying to such an extent. Even their strongest Existential Dharma Idol ancestor in Sanyuan City would likely be far inferior to him in terms of combat power.

A shiver of lingering fear instantly ran through Qi Lianyuan's heart. He had no doubt that if this Jade Young Master had erupted in anger and attacked at the Immortal Ascension Banquet, the entire Sanyuan City would have been destroyed in moments. No one could have stopped him.

In the center of the crowd, Huang Jiulong, dressed in golden robes, replayed the scene of Zhang Jing's attack over and over in his mind, completely mesmerized and unable to extricate himself. Only at his level of cultivation could he faintly perceive the true horror and profound subtleties of that saber strike. It seemed to contain some extremely formidable Dao principles.

What a pity—Huang Jiulong's eyes gradually regained clarity, and a hint of disappointment and unwillingness suddenly appeared on his face. He simply couldn't comprehend even a tiny bit from it. This feeling of knowing there was a treasure mountain but having to return empty-handed was maddening.

"If Senior Brother Zhang Jing from the Scarlet Bright Grand Heaven Blessed Land could deliver a sermon, how wonderful would that be! Wait, Senior Brother is establishing a Daoist sanctum; by custom, he should deliver a sermon, right?" Huang Jiulong's eyes lit up, and a look of anticipation instantly appeared on his face.

A long while later, Huang Jiulong, who had recovered his senses, saw his junior brothers and sister gathered before him and suddenly remembered something, saying with a smile: "The one who just entered the spiritual land was Zhang Jing, the True Disciple of the Scarlet Bright Grand Heaven Blessed Land. He came here because he took a fancy to this spiritual land and intends to establish a Daoist sanctum here."

"Scarlet Bright Grand Heaven Blessed Land! True Disciple Senior Brother!" Upon hearing this, the three of them exclaimed in unison. Their eyes were filled with shock. The three of them had unexpectedly encountered a legendary True Disciple. What incredible luck!

"Alas, we just didn't react quickly enough to seize the opportunity and proactively greet Senior Brother Zhang Jing; it's truly a sin. Otherwise, if we could be remembered by a True Disciple Senior Brother, wouldn't our future path in immortal cultivation be—" The leading man among the three was filled with deep regret. The other two also unconsciously showed hints of self-reproach on their faces. Clearly, in their hearts, missing the chance to speak with a True Disciple Senior Brother, someone they normally had no opportunity to interact with, was an enormous loss.

Not far behind the group, Qi Lianyuan's pupils contracted. "True Disciple! Blessed Land!" That 'Jade Young Master' was actually a True Disciple of the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect! What exactly had he done... At this moment, a deep sense of dread suddenly welled up in Qi Lianyuan's heart.

Just then, Li Jie had somehow sidled up to Qi Lianyuan and asked curiously, "Um, Young Master, what exactly are the Scarlet Bright Grand Heaven Blessed Land and True Disciples they're talking about?"

Qi Lianyuan explained simply: "A Blessed Land is the Daoist sanctum of a Heavenly Immortal True Monarch, and a True Disciple is... well, it's hard to explain clearly in a moment. Just understand it this way: True Disciples are the disciples of those legendary Heavenly Immortal True Monarchs, truly great figures within the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect whose single word can determine the fate of countless Dao Sect disciples!"

Hearing this, Li Jie's expression instantly froze. So, he had actually missed the chance to cultivate alongside a great figure from the Dao Sect? At this moment, he felt a sharp pang in his chest. If he had only persisted a bit more back then, perhaps that great figure would have been moved by his sincerity. How imposing would he be today? And how boundless his future prospects?

Dozens of yards away, the long-browed man, the gentle woman, and City Lord Qi Lian unconsciously exchanged glances, immediately seeing complex emotions flickering in each other's eyes. Among them was worry, but more prominently, excitement.

A True Disciple of the Grand Unity Boundless Dao Sect was about to establish a Daoist sanctum here! What this meant, the three of them couldn't be clearer. This vast, boundless region would welcome its true sovereign. At the same time, all immortal cultivation forces distributed within it would face different fates. This was an unprecedented revolution, either soaring to new heights or perishing, with risks and rewards coexisting. And their three factions had clearly seized the initiative!

Subtle spiritual sense fluctuations began to spread among the three. "Let's form an alliance. Only by advancing and retreating together can our three factions progress further in this wave!"

"Good!"
"Excellent!"

In just an instant, the three factions, who had previously been scheming against each other and fighting to the death, became the closest of allies. And all of this was simply driven by self-interest.

***

Mount Ling Shu, the tallest of the thirty-six main peaks. The mountain peak was steep and perilous, shaped like a long sword piercing the earth and thrusting directly into the cloud-piercing firmament, exuding a majestic and boundless aura. Clouds surged around its waist, reflecting the myriad golden rays cast by the great sun in the sky, extending as far as the eye could see.

At the peak, Zhang Jing stood with his hands behind his back, his Daoist robe fluttering. The sky pressed extremely low, as if one could reach out and touch it. He lowered his gaze slightly, and a magnificent and bizarre golden sea of clouds instantly appeared in his sight. Following that, Zhang Jing's gaze directly pierced through the sea of clouds, taking in the entirety of Mount Ling Shu, covering a hundred thousand miles, into his view.

"This is the place!" He thought to himself, a hint of determination flashing in his eyes.

The next instant, a chaotic Dao Seal, faintly tinged with purple, slowly emerged between his brows. With a thought, Zhang Jing felt his mind connect with a familiar, vast consciousness: Flowing Light Immortal Realm! His eyes narrowed, and he immediately transmitted the idea of establishing a Daoist sanctum.

Boom! The sky faintly split open, and an indifferent, emotionless eye suddenly appeared. As its gaze shifted, it cast a vast and ancient look downwards. Suddenly, Zhang Jing felt the Dao Seal between his brows begin to tremble, and at the same time, streams of information rapidly flashed through his mind.

[Identity verification in progress...]
[Scarlet Bright Grand Heaven Blessed Land True Disciple: Zhang Jing]
[Permission granted, eligible to establish Daoist sanctum]
[Location: Mount Ling Shu, Jiuliao Domain, Eastern Extremity Continent]
[Rename?]
[...]

***

Time passed by little by little.

"True Disciple Zhang Jing, from this moment forth, the hundred thousand miles of Mount Ling Shu shall, in terms of Daoist principles, belong to your Daoist sanctum. Within its boundaries, you shall possess the power to dominate any existence." A vast Daoist voice suddenly resounded in his mind.

Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, a faint look of excitement couldn't help but flash across his face. He now had a Daoist sanctum. Next was how to establish and build it. The Daoist sanctum's main gate, palaces, immortal caves, immortal root spiritual gardens... everything had to be built from scratch, bit by bit. The sheer magnitude of this project was terrifying.

However, not a trace of worry could be seen on Zhang Jing's face. Because, as far as he knew, all these tasks could be entrusted to a special type of being called "Mighty Heavenly Construct Ghostgods." As long as one was willing to pay with Karma Luck!

Thinking of this, he couldn't help but connect with the Flowing Light Immortal Realm once more. Not long after, as a pained expression flashed across Zhang Jing's face, four towering ghostgods, over a thousand zhang tall, with a hundred arms and a hundred eyes, suddenly appeared within Mount Ling Shu. They immediately half-knelt towards Zhang Jing, their enormous eyes wide and round, and spoke in a booming, muffled voice:

"Heavenly Construct Ghostgod Number Twenty-Four, greetings, Sir."
"Heavenly Construct Ghostgod Number Twenty-Five, greetings, Sir."
"Heavenly Construct Number Twenty-Nine..."
"Heavenly Construct Number Thirty..."
