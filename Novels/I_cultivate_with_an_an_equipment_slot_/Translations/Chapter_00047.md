# Chapter 47: The Gourd of Brewing

Tea, in a certain sense, has never been merely a consumable good.  

Rather, it has always been a gift and a symbol of status.  

Though this is a world of immortal cultivation, as long as humans are involved, such needs will always exist.  

Thus, Zhang Yan decided to turn the Hundred Flowers Tea into a luxury item—selling a small portion while keeping the rest for gifting.  

After all, it contained traces of second-grade spirit tea, making it inherently valuable. Combined with the numerous spiritual herbs and plants infused within, labeling it a luxury was no exaggeration.  

Moreover, this business venture was exclusive.  

Because, well…  

Even if ordinary people possessed the skills of a spiritual plant cultivator, they wouldn’t have access to second-grade spirit tea.  

"Still, I could experiment with ordinary spirit tea to see if it has similar effects. But that might require specialized expertise in blending." Zhang Yan had initially paired the spirit tea based on the medicinal properties of the spiritual plants.  

However, he had never studied tea blending in depth.  

The success he achieved was partly due to luck and partly because of the high grade of the spirit tea.  

If he were to use ordinary spirit tea, he might need a professional to refine the blend.  

In any case, the foundation for the Hundred Flowers Tea was already laid—only minor adjustments were needed. Though time-consuming, it wouldn’t be difficult.

With spirit stones in hand, Zhang Yan wandered through the sect’s marketplace once more, searching for valuable items.  

Unfortunately, the artifacts available were either of poor quality or had mediocre attributes, leaving him unimpressed.  

"This won’t do. I can’t rely solely on my own efforts to find good items—I need to open a shop." Zhang Yan surveyed the marketplace of the Qingheng Sect.  

Though it was an internal sect market, the sheer number of disciples ensured a steady flow of customers. Opening a shop here would be viable.  

However, the cost of setting up a shop within the sect wasn’t cheap.  

His current funds were insufficient, so he would have to wait until the next harvest from his spirit fields before considering the venture.  

"Hmm?"  

"This looks promising!"  

As he passed by a tavern, Zhang Yan suddenly spotted a wine gourd.  

**[Equipment Name]**: Brewing Gourd  
**[Equipment Quality]**: Blue  
**[Equipment Effects]**:  
- **Bottomless Tolerance** (As a master brewer, how could you get drunk after just one cup?)  
- **Master Brewer** (You can brew exquisite spirit wine.)  

"Fellow Daoist, how much for this wine gourd?"  

Upon seeing its attributes, Zhang Yan immediately stopped and asked the tavern owner.  

"Wine gourd?"  

The tavern owner looked at Zhang Yan in confusion, unsure what he was referring to.  

This establishment only sold spirit wine—not wine gourds.  

He thought Zhang Yan was eyeing the wine gourds used for storage behind him and quickly clarified.  

Those gourds weren’t even artifacts, so Zhang Yan naturally had no interest in them. What he wanted was the gourd the tavern owner carried on his person.  

"This is my personal wine gourd—it’s not for sale." The owner stared at Zhang Yan as if he were looking at a madman.  

He sold spirit wine, not wine gourds—especially not his own.  

"Fifty spirit stones."  

Ignoring the refusal, Zhang Yan casually named a price.  

"Huh?"  

"Fifty spirit stones?"  

Hearing this, the tavern owner’s indignant expression instantly softened. A second later, it turned downright ingratiating.  

"Ah, esteemed customer, this gourd is now yours! Would you like it filled with wine as a complimentary gift?"  

"No need for the wine—just the gourd will do."  

Zhang Yan chuckled, shaking his head as he took the gourd and left.  

The tavern owner watched his retreating figure, muttering under his breath. He couldn’t fathom why Zhang Yan would spend fifty spirit stones on a used gourd.  

Though the gourd had some spiritual properties, it wasn’t an artifact—just something that helped preserve the spiritual energy of wine.  

Its actual value was no more than two or three spirit stones, and it had already seen plenty of use.  

Today, he had simply encountered a fool—and profited handsomely.  

That was the tavern owner’s perspective.  

Meanwhile, Zhang Yan, despite spending fifty spirit stones, was in high spirits.  

For just fifty spirit stones, the tavern owner had unknowingly passed on his brewing expertise to Zhang Yan.  

*He truly is a generous soul—I could cry!*  

---  

Back in his cave abode, Zhang Yan summoned Liu Yiting and gathered some spiritual rice, preparing to brew wine.  

"Young Master, are you sure this is the right way?" Since joining him, Liu Yiting had taken to addressing him as "Young Master."  

"Trust me—it’ll work!"  

After equipping the Brewing Gourd, Zhang Yan was brimming with confidence in his brewing skills. Though Liu Yiting had her doubts, she didn’t dare voice them.  

She could only watch as he busied himself with the preparations.  

Soon, the initial steps were completed. All that remained was fermentation. Since this was his first attempt, he opted for a simple spirit wine recipe that required only about ten days of fermentation.  

After a month of diligent work, Zhang Yan finally succeeded in brewing his first batch of spirit wine.  

The distilled liquor carried a rich, intoxicating aroma.  

"Hey, silly bird! Come here—I’ve got something tasty for you!"  

Zhang Yan beckoned to the foolish bird nearby.  

Upon seeing his grin, the bird immediately spread its wings and tried to flee.  

But alas—  

How could Sun Wukong escape the Buddha’s palm?  

Zhang Yan swiftly caught it.  

"Trying to run?"  

With a cold snort, he poured a generous amount of spirit wine down the bird’s throat. Over time, this creature had grown increasingly intelligent—but also increasingly disobedient.  

After drinking, the bird began flapping wildly, its flight erratic and unsteady.  

Before it could even take off properly, it crashed to the ground.  

"Oh no, Young Master! Did your wine poison it?"  

Liu Yiting rushed over in alarm.  

After inspection, she concluded:  

The wine was fine—the bird just couldn’t hold its liquor.  

A few sips had gotten it completely drunk.  

Assured that the wine wasn’t toxic, Zhang Yan eagerly took a sip himself.  

To his delight, the flavor was excellent—crisp, refreshing, and lingering on the palate.  

"It seems that tavern owner really knew his craft." Zhang Yan’s respect for the man grew.  

"Here, you try some too." He poured a bowl and handed it to Liu Yiting.  

She took a small sip, only to immediately stick out her tongue, gasping from the burn.  

"Young Master, this is too strong!" She had never tasted alcohol before.  

"If you can’t handle it, no need to force yourself." Zhang Yan didn’t insist.  

Just as he was about to say more, a talisman suddenly flew into the cave abode from outside.  

"Young Master, someone seems to be here—I’ll check."  

Liu Yiting hurried out and soon returned with the message talisman.  

"Young Master."  

"Let me see."  

Taking the talisman, Zhang Yan’s brows furrowed slightly as he read its contents.
