# Chapter 71: I Desire to Cover the Heavens

Fengan Fort housed fewer than ten horses in total, and Yang Can had brought all of them.

Although Yang Can and his group had taken a detour, which shortened the straight-line distance, they had struggled considerably while crossing the mountain.

Yang Can was afraid of wasting time and arriving after the battle had already begun.

Therefore, he instructed the able-bodied men to proceed slowly while he and the mounted men rushed ahead.

In the end, he was still a step too late.

However, for Kang Zhengyang, Yang Can’s arrival was not late at all—it was perfect timing.

“Lord Manor!” Kang Zhengyang called out in surprise and delight.

“Is everything resolved?” Yang Can asked.

“It is resolved.”

“Who were they?”

“We don’t know who they were, but...”

Kang Zhengyang gave a bitter smile. “But I saw their cargo. I’m afraid this will be a huge trouble.”

“Cargo? What’s wrong with their cargo?”

Kang Zhengyang said grimly, “Lord Manor... if you turn back now and pretend you saw nothing, I... I wouldn’t blame you.”

“Huh? What on earth is it? Why are you being so mysterious?”

Yang Can found it somewhat amusing. He strode forward and boldly lifted the tarp with a heroic flourish.

“It can’t possibly be a cart full of naked men that would burn my eyes... right?”

His smile didn’t vanish; it just froze.

One cup of tea... one stick of incense...

At some point between a cup of tea and a stick of incense, Yang Can blinked.

Then, he slowly covered the tarp back up and carefully smoothed it out.

“Squad Leader Kang, if I leave right now, do you think I still have a chance?”

Kang Zhengyang didn’t answer. He just looked around at the more than one hundred men slowly gathering around them.

Yang Can let out a bitter laugh. He finally understood the great trouble Kang Zhengyang had stirred up.

He was the Second Steward of the Yang Clan’s main branch and the Lord of Fengan Manor.

Since he was already here, whether he had seen the cargo or not was irrelevant.

The owner of this batch of goods would never believe he was in the dark. They would even think that everything Kang Zhengyang and his men did was under his direct orders.

Want to stay out of it?

No, he was now the mastermind.

*I must be in a retrograde period this year!* Yang Can thought to himself. *I’ve been in this world for three years, and it’s been fine for three whole years.*

*But this year has been chaotic. First, I got dragged into the mud by Suo Chanzhi, and now I’ve plunged headfirst into a huge pit.*

He secretly sighed and forced himself to scan the “battlefield” that had yet to be cleaned up.

“Squad Leader Kang, how many people usually pass through this canyon?”

“Not many. Very few!”

Kang Zhengyang’s mouth seemed to be filled with bitter gourd as he grimaced.

“The area beyond this valley entrance is a grassland where a Xianbei tribe often grazes. This isn’t the road to the Western Regions. Unless they are doing business with the Xianbei tribe, merchants won’t come this way. Those Xianbei people are lawless; it’s common for them to kill for money and seize goods. There aren’t many merchants, and there are even fewer civilians.”

“So, this batch of goods... is very likely a transaction between these people and the Xianbei tribe?”

Hearing this, Kang Zhengyang finally realized, “Yes! That is highly possible.”

Yang Can stroked his chin and pondered for a moment. “How long is this valley path, and which tribe is outside?”

“The mountain path is less than four miles long. It leads to the grassland outside. The leader of that tribe is called Balimo. He is extremely cruel and warlike.”

Yang Can gave Kang Zhengyang a look. Kang Zhengyang hurriedly followed him, and the two stopped under a cliff.

“Squad Leader Kang, are all these carts filled with armor?”

“Yes...”

“No matter whose armor this is or who he intends to sell it to, the power behind this person is something you and I cannot contend with.”

“Yes...”

How could Kang Zhengyang not know?

Even if an ordinary person had money, they wouldn’t have a channel to acquire armor.

The owner of this armor must be both wealthy and powerful.

One must know that the requirements for making armor are extremely high, and it is time-consuming and labor-intensive.

The production of a single set of armor requires a craftsman six months to a year.

If it is the “Mingguang Armor” used by nobles and generals, it might even take skilled artisans several years to forge a single set.

However, the effect of armor is truly immense. There is a heaven-and-earth difference between a warrior wearing armor and one without.

Take the same warrior. In the chaos of battle, not to mention dying, getting injured is inevitable, right?

That injury might cause him to lose his combat effectiveness on the spot.

Even a small wound could lead to infection and death.

But if he wears armor, it can at least block more than seventy percent of the damage.

Equipment that can save a life is already priceless.

Moreover, once you put on armor, it’s like having nine lives?

Precisely because armor is so effective and difficult to make, the owner will never let this matter rest.

Kang Zhengyang said nervously, “Lord Manor, what if we send this armor to Phoenix Manor?”

“The Clan Master would certainly investigate strictly. However, before the Clan Master finds out the truth, you and I might already be dead.”

Kang Zhengyang’s face stiffened for a moment, but he knew that although Yang Can’s words were harsh, they were the absolute truth.

To be honest, Yang Can might still have a way out.

After all, Yang Can had improved the plow and the waterwheel, which had made him famous.

The Clan Master might transfer him back to Phoenix Manor for safety. If that happens, it will be much harder for anyone to deal with him.

But what about himself?

He could only pray for good luck.

“Lord Manor, how about this? We bury the armor and say we never caught up to those bandits?”

“How do we explain the dead people?”

“We say... we caught up, fought a big battle, but the bandits escaped?”

Yang Can’s lips twitched, feeling both amused and exasperated.

“Squad Leader Kang, do you want to hide this from the owner of the armor, or from the Clan Master?”

Kang Zhengyang was stunned for a moment before he understood the meaning.

*That’s right. Our goal is to make the owner of this armor not target us. My idea... does nothing to achieve that!*

Kang Zhengyang said helplessly, “Then... does the Lord Manor have a plan?”

“I did think of a plan, but...”

Yang Can looked at the soldiers in the valley. “Among them, how many know about this? Can we ensure their silence?”

“Less than ten people heard or saw it. They are all trustworthy brothers...”

Yang Can said, “I’m asking, can we ensure their silence!”

“Yes. As long as you give the order, Lord Manor, they will absolutely keep their mouths shut. Even if they get drunk, they wouldn’t dare say a word.”

Hearing such a firm answer, Yang Can couldn’t help but think of Zhang Yunyi, who had covered the sky with one hand.

Even if there was a great injustice, the villagers wouldn’t dare utter a word before Zhang Yunyi fell.

It was because they lived here for generations. Offending a local snake was far more terrifying than offending a dragon from another river.

And now, Yang Can was no longer alone.

In Fengan Manor, there was a large group of new vested interests who relied on him.

He was now the new local snake of Fengan Manor.

“Furthermore, I will give orders. If anyone dares to run their mouth and bring disaster, I will make their whole family wish they were dead!”

When he said this, Kang Zhengyang’s face was somewhat ferocious.

When life and death were at stake, no one would be careless.

Moreover, he wasn’t originally a kind-hearted old farmer.

Yang Can nodded. “That is excellent. I have a plan that might shift the blame to someone else.”

*What is the plan?*

Kang Zhengyang looked at Yang Can with his bull-like eyes, which instantly sparkled with hope.

Yang Can said, “Someone who can trade with so much armor is certainly not an ordinary person, and his methods must be extraordinary. Therefore, we must act on several fronts simultaneously, setting up a confusing situation where truth is mixed with falsehood. Only then can we have a chance to deceive the heavens.”

Kang Zhengyang said cautiously, “So, what exactly should we do? Please instruct me, Lord Manor!”

Soon, the people who had seen the armor or heard something were gathered by Kang Zhengyang for a lecture.

Kang Zhengyang was stern and full of killing intent. He explained the serious consequences of the leak in detail, breaking it down and rubbing it in.

There was no choice; this was the experience that these grassroots leaders had accumulated over time.

Even in modern society, where everyone has received a good education, there are still people who just don’t understand.

In this era, most people are illiterate. Combined with isolation and lack of mobility, many people’s comprehension abilities are even worse.

The good thing is that these people are single-minded. As long as you hit their pulse, they are very easy to manage, like herding cattle and sheep.

The bad thing is that what you think is a simple truth, they truly don’t understand!

You must use words they can understand and explain it to them carefully.

Kang Zhengyang ensured that every single one of them realized the seriousness of the situation. Only then did he arrange for people to clean up the battlefield according to Yang Can’s instructions.

Yang Can’s arrangement for the cleanup was very simple.

The felled trees were dragged to the roadside, and there was no need to drag them into the dense forest.

The bodies of the men who transported the goods were left where they lay, not even buried.

The bloodstains and signs of a fight on the ground were completely ignored.

However, the carriage with the broken wheel was repaired on the spot.

These long-distance carts had spare parts like wheels, axles, hubs, and spokes on board.

There were quite a few people in the village who could repair carriages. Using the spare parts for replacement, they could quickly restore the carriage to its original state.

The rest of the soldiers were mainly responsible for clearing the obvious traces they had left on the mountain top and the slopes.

After these tasks were assigned, Yang Can called Kang Zhengyang and Leopard Head to his side.

Kang Zhengyang already knew Yang Can’s plan, and his expression showed both nervousness and excitement.

Leopard Head, on the other hand, looked completely confused.

Yang Can said, “Dakuan, Squad Leader Kang, you two each pick a few people. I need those with good martial skills, who are quick-witted, and absolutely trustworthy.”

To meet all these conditions, the first choice was naturally their own brothers and nephews.

Yang Can said, “Then, you go...”

Yang Can instinctively lowered his voice. After giving his instructions, Kang Zhengyang immediately acknowledged with a deep voice.

Leopard Head was extremely surprised by Yang Can’s instructions, but he asked nothing.

Ever since following Yang Can, he seemed less glorious than before, but in reality, he had gained too many benefits.

The Cheng family was now the number one family in Fengan Manor under the Yang family.

The Yang family currently only had Yang Can, so the Cheng family’s prestige in Fengan Manor could be imagined.

And all of this was given to him by Master Yang.

“Understood!” Leopard Head immediately cupped his fists and agreed.

Soon, the two picked four or five people each. They were all their brothers, cousins, and nephews.

These men mounted the warhorses Yang Can had brought and galloped along the cleared mountain path toward the other end of the mountain.
