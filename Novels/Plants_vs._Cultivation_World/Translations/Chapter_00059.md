# Chapter 59: Spiritual Power Vaporization

As Gu Mo absorbed the solar essence containing golden specks, it instantly transformed into a mist-like spiritual energy. The moment this vaporous energy appeared, his meridians experienced a heavy, oppressive sensation.

"This is..."

Feeling the mist-like spiritual energy within his body, Gu Mo immediately realized something, his expression turning to one of astonishment. For a Qi Refining cultivator to break through to the Foundation Establishment stage, one crucial criterion was the transformation of their spiritual energy from a gaseous state to a liquid state. 

Between the gaseous and liquid states lay an intermediate phase—the vaporous state achieved at the peak of Qi Refining. Now, by absorbing the solar essence condensed from a second-tier Sunflower, Gu Mo had unexpectedly obtained this vaporous spiritual energy that should only be accessible at the Great Perfection of Qi Refining.

The same amount of spiritual energy in a vaporous state was clearly more potent than in its gaseous form, which explained the heaviness Gu Mo felt—it was the weight of the enhanced spiritual power.

Obtaining vaporous spiritual energy at the fourth layer of Qi Refining, a state typically mastered only at the Great Perfection stage, would bring him immense benefits. In some aspects, it could even grant him abilities comparable to a Great Perfection cultivator. 

For instance, when casting low-level spells, since both he and a Great Perfection cultivator possessed vaporous spiritual energy, the power of their spells would theoretically be equal. However, for higher-level spells, the difference in total spiritual energy would still leave Gu Mo at a disadvantage compared to a true Great Perfection cultivator.

Even so, wielding partial Great Perfection combat strength at the fourth layer of Qi Refining was already astonishing enough.

And this was from an imperfect solar essence. The second-tier Sunflower wasn't planted in second-tier spiritual soil, so the condensed solar essence wasn't perfect. Gu Mo wondered—if he planted this second-tier Sunflower in proper second-tier soil, would the fully matured plant produce solar essence capable of granting him liquid spiritual energy directly?

If this speculation proved true, his future breakthrough to Foundation Establishment would become significantly easier. Advancing from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment involved two major hurdles. The first was transforming spiritual energy from gaseous to liquid—a challenge heavily dependent on a cultivator's spiritual roots. Those with inferior roots would find this stage particularly difficult.

This was precisely the hurdle Gu Mo dreaded most. With his low-grade spiritual roots, breaking through to Foundation Establishment would be exceptionally hard. But if Sunflowers could directly provide him with liquid spiritual energy, this obstacle would effectively vanish, bypassing the limitations of his spiritual roots entirely.

The second hurdle of Foundation Establishment was condensing divine sense, which wasn't tied to spiritual roots but rather depended on a cultivator's soul foundation—an area where Gu Mo felt relatively confident. Moreover, he was currently cultivating the Wine God Soul-Tempering Technique, a special method specifically designed to enhance soul strength. Once his soul reached a sufficient level, condensing divine sense would come naturally.

In essence, as long as Gu Mo could secure a plot of second-tier spiritual soil and continue strengthening his soul through the Wine God technique, his path to Foundation Establishment would be virtually guaranteed.

"Amazing!"

Having discovered this broad avenue to Foundation Establishment, Gu Mo couldn't help but shout excitedly.

Unfortunately, he currently possessed only one second-tier Sunflower. To convert all his spiritual energy to the vaporous state, he would need more second-tier plants. Thus, Gu Mo decided to use the solar essence from his second-tier Sunflower to upgrade other first-tier mid-grade Sunflowers. Using higher-tier solar essence would dramatically improve the upgrade efficiency.

The effects of the second-tier solar essence proved even more remarkable. Whereas previously it took 100 units of ordinary solar essence to upgrade a first-tier mid-grade plant to high-grade, the second-tier essence required only 10 units.

While the efficiency improved, this didn't necessarily mean less time was needed. A single second-tier Sunflower took ten days to produce ten units of solar essence, whereas fourteen first-tier Sunflowers could generate 100 units in under ten days. 

The main limitation was quantity. Alternatively, if the second-tier Sunflower reached full maturity—likely achievable in second-tier spiritual soil—a single complete portion of second-tier solar essence might suffice for an upgrade. This would truly demonstrate the plant's potential, but without second-tier soil, Gu Mo remained constrained.

However, having successfully upgraded one second-tier Sunflower, Gu Mo knew that with time he could produce more. Moreover, with one second-tier plant already established, upgrading subsequent ones would likely take only about six months rather than a full year.

As the number of second-tier Sunflowers increased, the time required for further upgrades would progressively decrease until all his Sunflowers reached second-tier status.

The thought of possessing fifteen second-tier Sunflowers within a few years filled Gu Mo with excitement. However, the trade-off would be stagnant cultivation progress during those years, as all solar essence would be dedicated to upgrading plants rather than enhancing his own power.

The prospect of no advancement for several years left Gu Mo somewhat uneasy. He hadn't forgotten that he remained a prime target for that mysterious demonic cultivator. There was no telling when the threat might strike, and Gu Mo knew his current fourth-layer Qi Refining strength was far from sufficient to face such dangers.

Alternatively, if he abandoned Sunflower upgrades to focus solely on cultivation, even several years of effort would at best bring him to the Great Perfection of Qi Refining. To properly counter the demonic cultivator threat, achieving Foundation Establishment seemed the safer option.

"Perhaps I should upgrade the Peashooters and Potato Mines first," Gu Mo eventually concluded, settling on a more balanced approach. Prioritizing these two offensive plants to second-tier would grant him Foundation Establishment-level firepower. 

While they might not match true Foundation Establishment cultivators, upgrading just one second-tier plant now required only about six months. Obtaining a plant with Foundation-level combat capabilities in half a year represented extraordinary value.

With second-tier Peashooters and Potato Mines for protection, Gu Mo could safely focus on upgrading his Sunflowers. Once all Sunflowers reached second-tier, his cultivation would experience explosive growth. If he could then acquire second-tier spiritual soil, his breakthrough to Foundation Establishment might follow swiftly.

Wasting no time, Gu Mo uprooted a Peashooter from his spiritual field and transplanted it into a cultivation pot within his dimensional space, initiating the six-month upgrade process.

After completing these preparations, Gu Mo gathered his Sunflowers and prepared to visit the market for the annual gathering. He could also deliver the Water Spirit Rice promised to Chu Feifei.

"This paper crane won't last much longer," Gu Mo mused as he summoned the talisman. With repeated use, its spiritual glow had noticeably dimmed. 

Once it became unusable, he planned to switch to the mid-grade flying sword given by Yuan Niya. Now that he could cultivate Water Spirit Rice, no one would question a spiritual farmer of his means owning such transportation.
