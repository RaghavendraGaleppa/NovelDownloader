# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Grass - Chapter 95: An Unexpected Treasure  

A golden beam shot straight into the sky as the rumbling grew increasingly louder, shaking the earth as if the mountain itself was about to collapse.  

Observing the phenomenon in the distance, Lin Xuan wore a thoughtful expression while Qin Yan's delicate face flickered with a strange light.  

Suddenly, Lin Xuan's expression changed. Amidst the deafening roar, he could hear terrifying shrieks—evidently, the tremors had disturbed the demonic beasts nearby.  

Demonic energy filled the air as several winged beasts fled in panic.  

Lin Xuan turned his head and locked eyes with the Celestial Maiden of the Clouds. Both saw the same intent in each other's gaze: retreat. Now was not the time to settle their differences. Survival came first.  

Lin Xuan summoned his Jade Snow Ring and was about to flee when the rumbling intensified dramatically. If the earlier noise had been like lightning splitting the heavens, now it felt as if the very fabric of the world was tearing apart.  

Even as cultivators, Lin Xuan and Qin Yan couldn't help but shudder at the sheer force of nature.  

Meanwhile, the golden beam piercing the sky began to spin, faster and faster, transforming into a golden tornado.  

Such a display of natural power was undoubtedly a precursor to the emergence of a rare treasure. Yet Lin Xuan merely glanced back once before preparing to leave.  

But in that single glance, the golden light shifted again. Amidst its spiraling motion, three silver streaks shot outward—coincidentally, straight toward them.  

Lin Xuan froze for a moment, then immediately turned and flew toward the streaks. Mid-air, he formed a sphere with his hands, rapidly weaving hand seals. A blue light emanated from his body, twisting into a massive hand in the sky that snatched at the streaks.  

He successfully caught two of them. With a flick of his divine sense, the blue light wrapped around them and flew back into his storage bracelet. He then turned to look at the third streak.  

A delicate, slender hand caught it mid-flight. As the streak halted, Lin Xuan saw that it was a small jade slip.  

In the distance, the terrifying roar gradually faded, and the golden beam piercing the sky dimmed...  

Lin Xuan and Qin Yan exchanged a glance before simultaneously activating their artifacts and flying toward the exit of the Ravine of Leaping Streams.  

---  

Meanwhile, beneath the violently trembling mountain...  

The once-solid earth had turned molten. Trees nearby burst into flames, filling the area with fire and smoke. Over a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators from the Fire Spirit Sect hovered in the air, their faces twisted with despair, fury, and uncertainty.  

Their sect leader had yet to return, yet the treasure had emerged prematurely. Left with no choice, they had activated the formation under the guidance of their most senior disciple. At first, everything had gone smoothly. Even without the Clear Spirit True Person, a dozen Foundation Establishment cultivators were enough to operate the formation and retrieve the treasure.  

Just as the golden beam shot into the sky, however, the prayer beads held by the temporary leader suddenly shattered without warning.  

Every cultivator present paled in horror—those beads were linked to the Fire Spirit True Person's life force. Did this mean their sect leader had perished?  

In their shock, several disciples faltered in channeling their spiritual power, destabilizing the formation.  

The elder's expression darkened as he urgently warned the others, but it was too late. The formation's instability caused the emerging treasure to veer off course, transforming into streaks of light that shot into the distance.  

Trapped by the formation's backlash, the cultivators could only watch helplessly. Moments later, the formation's effects dissipated, and the elder's face twisted with fury as he immediately took flight. The others followed suit.  

Each wore a grim expression. Not only was their sect leader's fate unknown, but the treasure they had painstakingly schemed for—even betraying their allies—had slipped through their fingers. Now, the Fire Spirit Sect had become the target of the entire Yanzhou cultivation world, yet they had gained nothing.  

There were undoubtedly remnants of other sects still in the Ravine of Leaping Streams. They had to hunt them down and reclaim the treasure.  

Though unaware of the full situation, Lin Xuan and Qin Yan knew better than to linger. Their artifacts transformed into streaks of light as they raced toward the exit.  

Lin Xuan remained composed. Now was not the time to conserve spiritual power. He channeled his energy into the Jade Snow Ring, which hummed with thunderous energy, doubling its speed.  

Qin Yan's eyes flickered with surprise at Lin Xuan's refined cultivation. She formed a hand seal, accelerating to keep pace.  

Soon, they reached the exit. Seeing two streaks of light burst forth at incredible speed, the low-level disciples guarding the teleportation formation were stunned. Seizing the opportunity, Lin Xuan poured even more spiritual power into his artifact, pushing his speed further.  

Just as they were about to break free, Lin Xuan's heart swelled with triumph. Once they escaped the Fire Spirit Sect's territory, all they needed was to conceal their auras, and they would vanish like needles in a haystack.  

---  

Before he could finish that thought, an overwhelming divine sense swept over them from above. Lin Xuan frowned—a Foundation Establishment cultivator?  

He slapped his storage pouch, producing several talismans. "Activate!"  

He flung them outward. A dazzling array of spells erupted—Ice Needles, Dragon Transformation, Mountain Crush, Timber Impact...  

The approaching Foundation Establishment cultivator recoiled in shock at the barrage of high-level spells. He hastily halted, summoning his artifact to defend himself.  

Seizing the distraction, Lin Xuan shot past without pause.  

The cultivator, Qingyangzi, was the highest-ranking Fire Spirit Sect disciple guarding the teleportation formation. Furious and alarmed—his sect leader had ordered that no outsider leave the ravine—he dared not risk his life against the spells. He erected his strongest barrier, bracing for impact.  

Yet the spells fizzled harmlessly. The "Ice Needles" turned into mere ice pellets, and the rest were equally feeble. These were nothing but low-level talismans disguised as advanced ones—counterfeit goods Lin Xuan had purchased. But their deceptive appearance had bought him enough time.  

By the time Qingyangzi realized the trick, Lin Xuan and Qin Yan were long gone.  

With their top-tier artifacts, their escape was swift. Pursuit was futile.  

Fuming, Qingyangzi could only watch helplessly.  

Lin Xuan and Qin Yan flew for half an hour before stopping. By now, the sect's other experts would be closing in. Continuing to flee would only make them easier to track. Lin Xuan planned to conceal his aura—with the Red Vine Grass elixir masking his spiritual power, they should remain undetected.  

But what about Qin Yan?  

Before he could speak, she retrieved two red talismans from her storage ring, handing one to him.  

Lin Xuan's eyes lit up. These were Invisibility Talismans, capable of completely masking one's presence and cultivation. As long as they remained still, even higher-level cultivators wouldn't detect them.  

Accepting it, Lin Xuan affixed the talisman to himself and chanted an incantation. Under the infusion of spiritual power, it glowed brightly, enveloping him in white mist. Moments later, the mist dissipated—and so did he.  

Qin Yan did the same.  

The talismans lasted three hours—plenty of time. Once their pursuers gave up and searched elsewhere, Lin Xuan wasted no time meditating to recover his energy.  

---  

Three hours later, Lin Xuan opened his eyes, relief flashing across his face. During that time, Fire Spirit Sect disciples had searched the area multiple times, but the talismans had concealed them perfectly.  

Barring any unforeseen circumstances, their venture into the Ravine of Leaping Streams had concluded more successfully than expected. Not only had they obtained the Moonlight Silverflower and Glowgrass—key ingredients for the legendary Perfect Marrow Cleansing Pill—but they had also eliminated the Fire Spirit Sect leader, whose storage pouch now lay in Lin Xuan's possession.  

If the ancient texts were accurate, the pill's heaven-defying effects would allow him—despite lacking spiritual roots—to achieve Foundation Establishment.  

A Foundation Establishment cultivator not only enjoyed a lifespan twice that of a mortal or Qi Condensation cultivator but also wielded incomparable power.  

Only then would he truly step onto the immortal path.  

But the greatest surprise was the treasure that had fallen into their hands. The Fire Spirit Sect had betrayed allies for it—its value was beyond imagination...
