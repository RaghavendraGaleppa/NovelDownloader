Chapter 1: The Desolate Ancient Continent

On the Desolate Ancient Continent, where the strong preyed upon the weak, spiritual energy was as abundant as the ocean, and the laws of the Great Dao were obscure and profound. Here, martial artists cultivated to ascend to the heavens, and powerful experts could shatter mountains and rivers with a single punch.

In the vast and endless wilderness, a figure was desperately fleeing. It was a young man who looked about sixteen or seventeen years old. His clothes were ragged, his face was pale, and he was covered in blood. He was running with all his might, but his steps were unsteady, as if he would collapse at any moment.

Behind him, several fierce-looking men were chasing him closely. Their eyes were filled with ruthlessness and murderous intent.

"Xiao Chen, you can't escape! Hand over the 'Heavenly Dragon Bloodline' you obtained from the ancient ruins, and I might spare you a miserable death!" A coarse voice sounded from behind.

The young man named Xiao Chen gritted his teeth and ran faster. In his mind, the memories of the past few days flashed by like a movie.

He was originally an ordinary disciple of the Xiao Clan in Azure Dragon City. Because he had a low-level spiritual root, he was bullied and despised by his clan members. Three days ago, by a twist of fate, he accidentally fell into an ancient ruin and obtained a drop of primordial blood essence left behind by an ancient Heavenly Dragon. This blood essence contained a terrifying power and the complete Heavenly Dragon Bloodline.

However, this news was leaked, and the Xiao Clan's young master, Xiao Feng, immediately led people to hunt him down, intending to seize the Heavenly Dragon Bloodline for himself.

Xiao Chen knew that once he was caught, the only fate awaiting him was death. He had to escape!

"Roar!"

A beast roar suddenly sounded in front of him. A huge Black Scale Tiger blocked his path. Its eyes were scarlet, and it emitted a powerful aura of a Level 3 Beast.

Xiao Chen's heart sank. A Level 3 Beast was not something he could contend with in his current state.

At this moment, the pursuers also caught up. Xiao Feng, dressed in luxurious clothing, stepped forward with a sneer: "Xiao Chen, you're finished. Even the heavens are helping me. Now, hand over the bloodline!"

Xiao Chen looked at the Black Scale Tiger in front and the sneering Xiao Feng behind. A sense of despair rose in his heart. Could it be that his fate was truly doomed?

No! I don't accept it! I, Xiao Chen, refuse to accept a life of being trampled by others!

In his desperation, the drop of Heavenly Dragon blood essence in his body suddenly boiled. A terrifying power surged through his limbs and bones, and the Heavenly Dragon Bloodline hidden in his blood began to awaken.

"Since you want the bloodline, I'll give it to you!"

Xiao Chen let out a furious roar, and his body began to change. Scales appeared on his skin, and his eyes turned golden. He felt an unprecedented power filling his body.

He turned around and charged towards Xiao Feng.

"Courting death!" Xiao Feng sneered and slapped out with a palm.

However, the next moment, his expression froze. Xiao Chen's punch directly shattered his palm force, and then heavily landed on his chest.

*Crack!*

The sound of bones breaking was clear and crisp. Xiao Feng spat out a large mouthful of blood and flew out like a broken kite.

The surrounding pursuers were all stunned. The young master, who was usually arrogant and domineering, was actually defeated with a single punch by this废物 (waste) who they had always looked down upon?

Xiao Chen didn't stop. He turned and charged towards the Black Scale Tiger. With the power of the Heavenly Dragon Bloodline, he actually fought head-on with the Level 3 Beast.

After a fierce battle, the Black Scale Tiger let out an unwilling roar and fell to the ground. Xiao Chen stood amidst the corpse, his body covered in blood, but his eyes were extremely bright.

He looked at his hands, feeling the surging power within him. He knew that his life had completely changed from this moment on.

"From today onwards, I will no longer be the废物 (waste) who anyone can bully. Those who have humiliated me, I will make them pay a hundredfold!"

Xiao Chen raised his head, his gaze piercing through the clouds and mist, looking towards the vast world beyond.

The path of martial arts was long and arduous, but he had already embarked on it.
