**Chapter 110: A Single Hand Plucks the Stars!**

Staring at Qin Tianhe and Xu Xin, who stood before him with utmost reverence, Lu Yang froze for a moment. The words "Senior Brother," almost escaping his lips, were swallowed back down with difficulty.

At this moment, revealing his true identity would only lead to an awkward situation.

As for why he was mistaken for a True Person, Lu Yang could guess the reason: his current standing was simply too high, causing Qin Tianhe and Xu Xin to misjudge him. After all, he now cultivated three Great Divine Abilities, including the Saint's Heist and the Nine Transformations Dragon Art. His standing was barely a step away from Foundation Establishment. To those standing at the foot of the mountain, whether one was at the mountainside or the peak made no difference; both were equally unreachable. Thus, it was quite normal for them to mistake him.

So, Lu Yang didn't deny it. He simply stated, "I have been ordered to seek an audience with True Monarch Chongguang here, but I do not know how to proceed. I ask that you two fellow Daoists instruct me."

Qin Tianhe and Xu Xin immediately looked flattered. Rarely did a "True Person" in the Sacred Sect act with such courtesy. They dared not delay and quickly replied, "If True Person has come by order, the Formation Spirit within Sacred Flame Cliff will surely have a record of it. After True Person notifies it, it will naturally guide True Person."

"Thank you." Lu Yang nodded, then summoned a ray of escape light and swiftly flew towards Sacred Flame Cliff, disappearing from their sight shortly after.

"Which True Person was that?"

"I don't know..."

Xu Xin and Qin Tianhe exchanged glances, both feeling puzzled. Lu Yang was truly unfamiliar, and his polite demeanor was so uncharacteristic it made them uncomfortable.

"It seems we were lucky."

"If it were other True Persons, they might not ask; they might just directly search our souls..."

"Who knows which battlefield that True Person came from? The Jiangxi Pure Land, Jiangdong Dao Court, Jiangnan Sword Pavilion... none of the factions have been peaceful lately."

Lu Yang naturally didn't hear their laments. By now, he had already flown into Sacred Flame Cliff. And just as Qin Tianhe had said, the moment he stepped into Sacred Flame Cliff, streams of light converged, eventually transforming into a woman of peerless beauty, clad in colorful robes, who gracefully descended before him.

Lu Yang quickly stopped, cupped his hands, and said, "Lu Yang greets this Senior Sister."

The woman paused at his words, a strange glint appearing in her eyes before vanishing. She said indifferently, "Core Disciple Lu Yang, please follow me. Do not wander off." With that, she turned and departed without another word.

Lu Yang quickly followed, secretly musing:

'This is the Formation Spirit of Sacred Flame Cliff... I've heard that this place is where the True Monarchs cultivate in seclusion, and the formations here are at least of the third rank.'

So advanced!

As a seventh-rank Formation Master, Lu Yang couldn't help but feel an itch in his heart, wanting to dissect the Formation Spirit before him and thoroughly study its structure. However, in the end, Lu Yang restrained himself.

Soon, led by the Formation Spirit, Lu Yang arrived at a grand hall on the outermost edge of Sacred Flame Cliff. The hall was brightly lit by the heavens, illuminating the four directions of the sky. Lu Yang strode into the hall and immediately saw True Monarch Chongguang seated at the head of the hall. His hands were clasped behind his back, and on the palace wall before him, a vast map was unrolled, encompassing the four directions and even extending overseas. Every territory on the map was covered with dense annotations.

"Disciple Lu Yang greets Martial Uncle Chongguang."

Without a word, Lu Yang first performed a Daoist bow, then stood silently in place, patiently waiting for True Monarch Chongguang to respond.

After a long while, True Monarch Chongguang finally regained his focus. He turned around, opening a pair of dazzling, fiery white pupils. His gaze, like a falling blaze, swept over Lu Yang, scrutinizing him from inside out.

Seeing this, Lu Yang straightened his back and chest, not feeling the slightest bit guilty.

A moment later, True Monarch Chongguang retracted his gaze, a hint of surprise on his face. "These Great Divine Abilities of yours... were they all taught to you by Junior Brother Yinshan?"

"Indeed!" At this moment, Lu Yang held nothing back. All the Great Divine Abilities he possessed—the Corpse Liberation True Method, Heavenly Silkworm Secret, and Saint's Heist—were openly displayed. Moreover, he could guarantee that the origin of all these divine abilities was traceable. They were all passed to him by True Person Yinshan after he became a Core Disciple on Skeleton Mountain. It was just that he had cultivated all of them to completion on his way back to the Sacred Sect. There was nothing at all suspicious about it.

What? I cultivated too quickly?

There's nothing I can do. With the blessing of a Foundation Establishment Protector Deity's status, cultivating Great Divine Abilities is just like this. If you don't have one, it's hard for me to explain it clearly to you.

Looking at the self-righteous Lu Yang, True Monarch Chongguang's eyes gradually brightened. True Person Yinshan had already informed him about Lu Yang. And just now, he had personally deduced the karmic ties and thoroughly checked him inside and out, basically confirming there were no issues. For a Core Disciple's investigation, his level was the limit. After all, Lu Yang was still just a Qi Condensation disciple; even if he caused a colossal stir, it wouldn't alarm a Golden Core True Monarch.

"You are quite good." Thinking this, True Monarch Chongguang's tone became significant. "With your cultivation, you could actually attempt to break through to Foundation Establishment right now, and you'd have at least an eighty percent chance of success." However, he quickly changed the subject. "But I hope you don't rush into Foundation Establishment."

"The War for the Dao between the righteous and demonic factions is about to resume. If you can join it and help the Sacred Sect win this war, it will be of great benefit to you even after you reach Foundation Establishment."

True Monarch Chongguang's attitude could be described as gentle. Lu Yang could tell that even if he refused, True Monarch Chongguang would most likely not blame him. But in that case, he would lose the opportunity to earn merit. If he didn't earn merit, how could he advance in the Sacred Sect?

Therefore, Lu Yang didn't hesitate and immediately said, "This disciple is willing to participate in the War for the Dao."

"Good!" True Monarch Chongguang smiled relaxedly upon hearing this, and his gaze towards Lu Yang grew a little kinder. "From today onwards, you are a Core Disciple of my Sacred Sect."

"Your generation is the Yuan generation."

"You have inherited the lineage of the Witch Ghost Dao, and you likely carry a good deal of karmic sin from killing. I will bestow upon you the character 'Tu' (屠, meaning 'slaughter' or 'butcher'). From now on, your Daoist title shall be Yuantu. How does that sound?"

As soon as True Monarch Chongguang spoke these words, Lu Yang immediately understood that the other party was essentially openly trying to win him over; otherwise, he wouldn't personally bestow a Daoist title upon him. Thinking of this, Lu Yang quickly cupped his hands and said, "Yuantu greets Martial Uncle."

True Monarch Chongguang then laughed heartily and beckoned to Lu Yang. "Come here. When the War for the Dao begins later, this place will be the best observation point."

"Observation point?"

"Indeed. The True Monarchs are about to establish the battlefield for the War for the Dao."

Lu Yang felt curious, but showed no trace of it on his face. He obediently walked to True Monarch Chongguang's side. Not long after, a soft exclamation reached his ears:

"They're here!"

Almost simultaneously, Lu Yang looked up at the sky.

At this moment, the entire ceiling of the grand hall suddenly transformed, as if it had become a round mirror, dispelling illusion and revealing a vast spectacle. It was the boundless firmament. And at this moment, the entire Sacred Sect, the connecting Heaven-Reaching Cloud Sea, was gently vibrating. The cloud sea churned, murky waves surged, and a Dharma Body slowly rose from within the cloud sea.

With just this single movement, the Dharma Body's head shattered thirty-six layers of astral clouds, and behind its head, wave-like halos rippled outwards, resembling mountains encircling small waves and snow surging from flying peaks. It stood with its hands clasped behind its back, the vast Heaven-Reaching Cloud Sea of the Sacred Sect seeming like nothing more than a chessboard beneath it. Its form was even continually expanding.

Its eyes merged with the sun and moon in the sky, their light becoming its gaze as it calmly swept over all living beings below. Gradually, Lu Yang could no longer even discern the complete form of the Dharma Body. Everything about it overlapped with the surrounding world in Lu Yang's vision, making its full appearance impossible to behold. Only an indescribable shock surged through his heart.

Mountains and peaks formed its body, the vast sky its head! Rivers flowed as its veins, the sun and moon as its eyes!

The next second, Lu Yang's vision shifted again, only to see two similar, magnificent Dharma Bodies slowly rising on the distant horizon. One had a perpetual smile, full of compassion. One was clad in official robes, with dragons and phoenixes bowing to it.

The three Dharma Bodies, each encompassing tens of thousands of li of territory, interacted with one another, drawing a circle on the vast land and fixing the earth veins within that circle.

"Golden Core True Monarchs... So this is a True Monarch!?"

Lu Yang's eyes widened, almost shedding two lines of bloody tears, before he could barely make out the movements of the three Golden Core True Monarchs—they slowly raised their hands. Three palms, simultaneously aimed at a single star above the firmament. Then, they clasped their hands together.

The next second, Lu Yang saw that brilliant star in the firmament being grasped, dragged, and finally sent plummeting towards the earth by the three True Monarchs!

A single hand, plucking the stars!
