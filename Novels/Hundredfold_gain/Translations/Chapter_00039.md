# Chapter 39: Dividing the Spirit Ginseng Fruits, Final Harvest  

Qi Chuan flew out of the valley mouth and arrived at a patch of rocky ground.  

By now, the Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees and Qi Chan'er had already vanished without a trace. However, the two had previously agreed on a rendezvous point. After scanning his surroundings, Qi Chuan chose a direction and carefully concealed his aura as he headed that way.  

Before long, he arrived at a dense forest and leaned against a large tree, closing his eyes to wait. In this vast woodland, such thickets were common, but the tree behind him bore knife marks—a prearranged signal.  

Time passed quickly as he waited.  

After a while, Qi Chuan's ears twitched, and he opened his eyes. He had heard faint buzzing in the distance, gradually fading away—heading back toward the valley. It was likely the swarm of Bloodthirsty Spirit Bees returning.  

"Phew..."  

Soon, footsteps approached, and Qi Chuan saw Qi Chan'er again, panting heavily. Her cheeks were flushed, and beads of sweat trickled down her face. Unharmed, she had clearly succeeded in luring away the bees, though the task had not been easy.  

"Did you get it?"  

Standing before him, Qi Chan'er fixed her gaze on Qi Chuan, her eyes brimming with anticipation.  

Qi Chuan nodded and stood up. With a wave of his hand, six jade boxes floated in the air before him. As they opened, six Spirit Ginseng Fruits were revealed—each the size of half a palm, pure white in color, covered in fine root-like tendrils, and exuding a rich spiritual aura.  

A smile bloomed on Qi Chan'er's delicate face. The Black Mystic Grass she had risked her life to gather from the Black Marsh, home to the Water Cloud Crocodiles, paled in comparison to the value of these Spirit Ginseng Fruits. With these, her cultivation in the outer sect would progress much more smoothly.  

She reached out, and three of the jade boxes flew into her hands, which she promptly stored away.  

"As agreed, since there are six Spirit Ginseng Fruits, we each take three. A successful partnership."  

Qi Chan'er smiled faintly at Qi Chuan and extended her slender, delicate hand toward him.  

True to her word, she asked no questions about what Qi Chuan might have done in the valley. Perhaps he had harvested additional spirit herbs, but their cooperation had been half partnership, half repayment of a debt. Even if he had taken extra spoils, what did it matter?  

After all, he had saved her life.  

Because of this, Qi Chan'er was actually in high spirits—she had finally repaid at least part of her debt.  

Hesitating internally, Qi Chuan ultimately decided against mentioning the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body or the talisman treasure. The talisman was far too valuable—an absolute life-saving treasure before reaching the Golden Core stage.  

As for the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body, if an opportunity arose, he could make a copy for her. But bringing it up now would be difficult to explain.  

With these thoughts in mind, Qi Chuan extended his hand and clasped hers briefly, feeling a soft, smooth touch.  

"Successful cooperation."  

After a light shake, they quickly withdrew their hands.  

"With our business concluded, the Rising Cloud Mountains aren't a place to linger. Should we return to the sect?" Qi Chuan glanced toward the direction of the sect's exit.  

"Agreed. Let's go back together."  

Qi Chan'er nodded without objection. Having narrowly escaped danger and profited greatly from this venture, she was ready to return to the Moon Breeze Sect.  

Thus, the two set off toward the mountains' edge, moving cautiously and suppressing their auras to avoid attracting unnecessary battles with any demonic beasts.  

---  

Some time later, at the Moon Breeze Sect's main gate.  

"It's time to part ways. If you ever face difficulties, you can find me in the inner sect," Qi Chuan said to Qi Chan'er with a sigh.  

Though Qi Chan'er had promised not to pry into his other gains in the valley, he still felt he had taken advantage of her. In a way, he now owed her a favor.  

As for his earlier act of saving her life, Qi Chuan considered it balanced by the information she had provided about the Spirit Ginseng Fruits.  

After all, while Qi Chan'er might see her life as priceless—something no material reward could truly repay—from Qi Chuan's perspective, saving her had been a simple, effortless act. The Water Cloud Crocodiles had posed little threat to him, so he wouldn't demand more from her.  

"Thank you again for everything," Qi Chan'er said sincerely.  

"If you ever need my help, don't hesitate to come to the outer sect. I won't refuse."  

In her heart, she didn't believe her life debt could be so easily repaid.  

After exchanging a few more words, the two finally parted ways at the sect gate. Qi Chuan headed toward the inner sect, while Qi Chan'er returned to the outer sect.  

Along the way, Qi Chan'er turned back and watched Qi Chuan's retreating figure for a few moments before shaking her head with a wry smile.  

"I originally thought that after entering the outer sect, I'd train hard to surpass Qi Chuan and make it into the inner sect."  

"Yet this trip to the Rising Cloud Mountains ended with him saving me and me owing him a life debt... Ah, well."  

"I'll just keep cultivating diligently in the outer sect. The future can wait..."  

With that, she steeled her resolve and vanished into the outer sect.  

---  

Meanwhile, Qi Chuan made his way back to the inner sect.  

Lost in thought about the events of his journey, he suddenly realized he had arrived before the Mission Hall.  

"Since I'm here, I might as well turn in the mission," he muttered with a self-deprecating chuckle.  

Entering the hall, he handed over the Water Cloud Crocodile tusks to complete the mission.  

Seven sets of tusks, each worth three inner sect contribution points, netted him a total of twenty-one points.  

In the inner sect, one contribution point was equivalent to ten low-grade spirit stones—enough to exchange for twenty-one Gathering Yuan Pills.  

Under normal circumstances, to avoid pill toxicity and resistance, one pill was consumed per month. Twenty-one pills would last nearly two years, ensuring Qi Chuan wouldn't need to worry about cultivation resources for a long time.  

However, after leaving the Mission Hall, Qi Chuan only exchanged for five Gathering Yuan Pills at the inner sect's Alchemy Pavilion before heading back to his upper-tier first-grade cave abode.  

After all, while the pills could be exchanged anytime, contribution points could be saved for emergencies.  

Soon, Qi Chuan returned to his cave abode.  

The door sealed shut, and the formation activated.  

Inside a quiet chamber, he took out the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body manual, a faint smile playing on his lips as anticipation flickered in his eyes.  

"Let's see what wonders the Minor Mystic Crystal Jade Body holds."
