# Chapter 30: Entering the Wind Moon Sect, the Overtly Recognized Top Inner Disciple Talent (Seeking Favorites)

On the flying carpet, the young men and women couldn't help but show looks of astonishment upon hearing the information shared by the Grand Elder.

"Wind Spirit Mountain? Moon Shadow Mountain?"

Qi Chuan, however, remained silent in contemplation.

"But these are third-grade spiritual veins. I wonder just how rich the spiritual energy is within them. Presumably, cultivating there without taking any elixirs would yield results comparable to—if not surpassing—those achieved with elixirs," Qi Chuan thought to himself as he gazed at the outlines of the two massive mountains shrouded in mist within the vast Wind Moon Lake.

Just as everyone was marveling at the scenery of Wind Moon Lake, the flying carpet continued its approach, drawing ever closer until it finally descended before a mountain gate outside the ring of mountains surrounding the lake.

"Who goes there?"

As the flying carpet landed, a gatekeeping disciple stepped forward to inquire.

"I am the Grand Elder of the Qi Family. These individuals are our clan's youths seeking to join the esteemed sect," the Grand Elder promptly stepped forward to explain the situation, presenting his identity token and other credentials.

"Ah, members of the Qi Family. Follow me."

After verifying the credentials, the gatekeeping disciple nodded slightly, then turned to lead the group through the mountain gate.

Thus, they entered the sect grounds.

Before stepping inside, Qi Chuan glanced back and saw numerous streaks of light still flying toward the Wind Moon Sect's mountain gate. Among these, some were undoubtedly from other cultivation families.

Beyond the gate, through the long white jade staircase and drifting mist, he could vaguely make out a large crowd gathered at the mountain's base—likely rogue cultivators who had come to participate in the sect's grand recruitment.

During the journey, the Grand Elder had mentioned that while the Wind Moon Sect accepted disciples from cultivation families, most rogue cultivators who joined ended up as outer disciples or, more commonly, menial disciples. Of course, those with clean backgrounds and exceptional talent might be admitted as inner disciples, though such cases were rare.

At that moment, a brutal selection process was likely unfolding at the mountain's base. However, this had little to do with Qi Chuan, as he already held a spot as an inner disciple.

Retracting his gaze, Qi Chuan followed the group into the sect, arriving at a plaza. Beyond it stood several grand halls.

The gatekeeping disciple had them wait outside one of the halls before entering. Shortly after, two individuals dressed in steward attire emerged, rechecked the credentials, and then declared, "Members of cultivation families are not permitted to linger within the sect without reason."

Hearing this, the Grand Elder understood it was time to part ways.

"From now on, you will cultivate within the sect. If any issues arise, you may send word back to Red Maple Valley. The family will assist however possible. I shall take my leave now," the Grand Elder said to Qi Chuan and the other three.

Everyone nodded and bid the Grand Elder farewell. The exchange was brief, as most instructions had already been given during the journey. Soon after, the Grand Elder departed through the mountain gate and flew away on his carpet.

Once the Qi Family's Grand Elder had left, the two sect stewards turned their attention to Qi Chuan and the others.

One steward's gaze settled on Qi Chuan, and he nodded slightly. "You are Qi Chuan, the Qi Family's nominee for the inner disciple position?"

"Yes," Qi Chuan replied.

"Then follow me to the inner sect," the steward said without further ado, turning to lead Qi Chuan away.

Qi Chuan followed, glancing back to see the other steward guiding Qi Chan'er and the remaining two toward a different direction—likely the outer sect.

Back in Red Maple Valley, the four had all been members of the Qi Family. Now, upon entering the Wind Moon Sect, their paths would diverge.

As this thought crossed his mind, Qi Chuan locked eyes with Qi Chan'er. Her determined gaze seemed to convey a silent challenge—perhaps she still refused to accept being surpassed and aimed to overtake him in the outer sect.

Such resentment was natural. Anyone with a fourth-grade spiritual root surpassed by someone with an eighth-grade root would likely feel the same. Of course, they wouldn't know about his hundredfold multiplier cheat.

Shaking his head slightly, Qi Chuan averted his gaze. With his golden finger and the sect's resources, his cultivation speed would only accelerate, widening the gap between him and Qi Chan'er irreversibly.

Soon, under the steward's guidance, Qi Chuan arrived at the inner sect—a designated area within the mountains surrounding Wind Moon Lake, where the spiritual veins were of higher grade, featuring numerous peaks.

He was brought to a plaza on the mountainside of one peak and led into a grand hall. This peak was called Inner Affairs Peak, and the hall was the Inner Affairs Hall, where many matters pertaining to inner disciples were handled.

Upon entering, Qi Chuan noticed about ten young cultivators gathered around what appeared to be a sand table-like object. To his surprise, it resembled the sand tables from his previous life—though it seemed to be a single integrated piece, likely a magical artifact.

This sand table artifact displayed models of various peaks, marked with red and blue dots—mostly blue, with very few red ones—leaving Qi Chuan puzzled.

After bringing Qi Chuan inside, the steward departed.

After some thought, Qi Chuan approached the sand table artifact, observing silently. Occasionally, he felt the gazes of the other young cultivators upon him, accompanied by whispers, but he paid them no mind.

After a while, based on his observations and the reactions of those around him, Qi Chuan began to form a hypothesis.

"This sand table artifact likely maps out the inner sect's peaks, with the red and blue dots representing available caves or residences?"

"No wonder these youths are so focused on it. These ten must be nominees from other cultivation families, here to choose their caves. This is crucial—better caves mean higher-grade spiritual veins and richer energy, greatly aiding cultivation. I hope I don't end up with a poor one..."

As these thoughts surfaced, Qi Chuan began to mimic the others' keen interest in the sand table. However, lacking knowledge about the peaks and markings, he couldn't make sense of it.

While he was studying the artifact, two or three more young cultivators arrived under the guidance of stewards. Like Qi Chuan, they gathered around the sand table, pointing and discussing the markings.

Once this group arrived, the hall fell silent—no more newcomers appeared. Presumably, all cultivation family nominees had assembled.

The Inner Affairs Hall was divided into front and rear sections. Moments after everyone gathered, an elder in his fifties or sixties emerged from the rear. His attire differed significantly from the stewards', exuding an air of nobility.

With thick eyebrows, the elder immediately drew everyone's attention, his presence imposing an immense pressure.

"I am Zhao Jing, elder of the Inner Affairs Hall. Today, I shall assign your caves," the elder announced with a faint smile.

"A sect elder—that means he's at least at the Foundation Establishment realm! So this is how caves are assigned, but what's the method?" Qi Chuan wondered silently.

The other youths also grew visibly excited and expectant.

"Elder, how will the caves be allocated?" a richly dressed youth stepped forward and asked courteously.

This youth appeared around sixteen, with an air of nobility and slightly elongated earlobes. His demeanor was gentle and amiable, though a hint of cunning lurked in the depths of his eyes.

"It's Ye Liang, the Ye Family's prodigy," some of the other youths whispered, their expressions tinged with wariness.

The Ye Family was a major power, with three Foundation Establishment experts anchoring its position as arguably the foremost cultivation family under the Wind Moon Sect's jurisdiction.

Ye Liang himself possessed a third-grade spiritual root and, at just sixteen, had already reached the fifth level of Qi Refinement—one step away from the sixth level and the late-stage bottleneck. On the surface, he was undoubtedly the top talent among the gathered nominees, someone none dared to provoke lightly.

In response to Ye Liang's question, Elder Zhao Jing ignored him and instead produced a bamboo tube-shaped artifact containing several bamboo slips with blurred inscriptions.

"So it's a random draw," Qi Chuan noted inwardly. This method relied purely on luck, free from favoritism—fitting for someone of the elder's status, who wouldn't stoop to cheating.

The question was, as a transmigrator, was his luck good or bad?

Meanwhile, slight embarrassment flickered in Ye Liang's eyes at being ignored, but he quickly masked it and stepped forward with a smile. "Elder, allow me to go first."

Elder Zhao Jing handed him the bamboo tube without objection.

After careful examination, Ye Liang confidently drew a slip marked: first-grade, mid-tier.

"Elder, this is...?" Ye Liang inquired.

The elder retrieved the slip, rubbed it between his hands, and a beam of light shot out, linking to a blue dot on one of the peak models in the sand table.

After a glance, the elder handed Ye Liang a token.

Realizing the bamboo slips corresponded to caves—with "first-grade, mid-tier" denoting the spiritual vein's grade—Ye Liang deduced that all new inner disciples received mid-tier caves, with the draw merely determining location.

Checking the peak model, he noted his cave's favorable position and retreated, satisfied.

"Who's next?" the elder asked.

"I'll go," a plain-looking youth in gray stepped forward—Murong Fan of the Murong Family, fifteen years old and at the fourth level of Qi Refinement.

His draw also yielded a first-grade, mid-tier cave, and he received a token.

One by one, the youths drew their slips—all first-grade, mid-tier—confirming Ye Liang's earlier assumption.

Watching this, Qi Chuan waited until last before approaching the elder. Having observed the process, he knew all caves were mid-tier and thus felt no urgency.

He drew a slip casually, expecting no surprises.

The other youths glanced at him disinterestedly, anticipating the same outcome.

But when Qi Chuan unfolded his slip, his expression froze in surprise.

"First-grade, high-tier!" Elder Zhao Jing remarked with a faint smile. "You've got quite the luck. Though there are a few high-tier caves vacant, the odds of drawing one are slim."

At these words, the previously indifferent youths snapped their attention to Qi Chuan's hand, their eyes widening in shock.

There, clear as day, the bamboo slip bore the inscription: "First-grade, high-tier."
