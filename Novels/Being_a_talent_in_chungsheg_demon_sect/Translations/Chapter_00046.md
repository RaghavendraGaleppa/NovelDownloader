# Chapter 46: Stealing Heavenly Secrets

“This art is called ‘Stealing Heavenly Secrets’.”

With Lu Yang’s permission, Zhao Xuhe took out a jade slip. After imbuing it with his spiritual sense, he handed it to Lu Yang, revealing it to be a brief introduction to the Foundation Establishment secret art he spoke of.

Lu Yang swept his spiritual sense over it and immediately revealed a look of astonishment.

Lu Yang knew at a glance that this art of “Stealing Heavenly Secrets” was created by a senior expert from the Sacred Sect, as its words and phrases carried the unique style of the Sacred Sect.

The so-called ‘Stealing Heavenly Secrets,’ as the name implies, involves first finding a female cultivator whose age, talent, and cultivation are on par with one's own, then forming a Dao Companion relationship with them. Through continuous cultivation, one gradually implants one's own Qi mechanism into the other party's body, replacing their Qi seed.

Once successful, the other party no longer cultivates their own Qi seed, but the Qi seed of the caster.

At that time, no matter what opportunities the other party obtains or what breakthroughs they make, everything will ultimately be stolen by the caster, their entire life's cultivation becoming a mere bridal gown for another.

Insidious, vicious, treating people as mere resources… truly classic.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang glanced at Zhao Xuhe again and suddenly recalled hearing in a previous, previous life that Zhao Xuhe had apparently become Dao Companions with Immortal Feixia.

*So that’s how it was. No wonder they both perished after failing to break through to Foundation Establishment.*

*Looking at it now, Zhao Xuhe probably killed Immortal Feixia first, and then died from his own failed Foundation Establishment. All his schemes ultimately came to naught.*

While Lu Yang inwardly muttered, he also secretly felt a chill.

From his perspective, Zhao Xuhe’s preparations in that previous, previous life were absolutely perfect; he had utilized almost every available resource.

In that previous, previous life, after Zhao Xuhe and Immortal Feixia became Dao Companions, he rose sharply by relying on Skeleton Mountain. Not only did he break through to Qi Condensation Grand Perfection, but he also obtained two Foundation Establishment wondrous items. If one considers this art of “Stealing Heavenly Secrets,” Immortal Feixia’s share was essentially also Zhao Xuhe’s property.

All told, Zhao Xuhe had prepared a full three methods to break through to Foundation Establishment!

Yet, what was the outcome?

He still failed!

“Foundation Establishment, Foundation Establishment, the Immortal Foundation of the Great Dao… Without Foundation Establishment, one is ultimately a mediocre mortal. No wonder only Foundation Establishment cultivators can be called True Immortals.”

“Foundation Establishment is difficult, more difficult than ascending to the heavens…”

After sighing, Lu Yang looked at the jade slip in his hand again.

“What do you think, Junior Brother?” Zhao Xuhe asked with an expectant expression, “I offer this as collateral. Junior Brother, lend me thirty thousand contribution points. The deadline is three months from now. I will definitely repay the money within three months.”

“If I don’t repay it, the secret art will be yours as repayment for the debt.”

“But even if I do repay it, I will still give the secret art to Junior Brother as a thank you for providing timely help and assisting me through this difficult period!”

Zhao Xuhe spoke generously and grandly, but Lu Yang inwardly sneered upon hearing him.

*It sounds like as long as I’m willing to lend, this art of Stealing Heavenly Secrets is mine, and I won’t lose anything no matter what… But in reality, it’s not like that at all!*

The key was not the secret art, nor was it the loan.

It was the three-month time limit.

Because as long as he lent the money, if Zhao Xuhe encountered any crisis within those three months, Lu Yang would have to intervene, or else he wouldn’t be able to recover his money.

So, this loan wasn’t about money; it was about people!

Zhao Xuhe clearly wanted to use this Foundation Establishment secret art to tie Lu Yang down, forcing him to pay for his future adventures and the karma he incurred!

In short, it was a sugar-coated bullet.

And precisely because it concerned Foundation Establishment, Lu Yang couldn’t refuse.

*But what if I want the secret art but don’t want to be responsible?*

Lu Yang looked at the jade slip in his hand, wondering if there was a way to eat the candy coating and throw the bullet back, for instance, by sending Zhao Xuhe to become sworn brothers with Liu Xin…

However, Lu Yang quickly dismissed this idea. Just as he had taken Ouyang Haoze as a banner spirit but failed to obtain the Divine Martial Sect’s cultivation method from him, the cultivation world had plenty of means to prevent the leakage of cultivation methods and divine abilities. Since Zhao Xuhe dared to come to him, he must have been prepared.

The success rate was too low.

Lu Yang fell silent for a moment, then suddenly said, “...Alright.”

“I can agree to Senior Brother’s loan, but I also have a condition. If Senior Brother cannot accept this condition, I would rather give up the secret art.”

Zhao Xuhe was overjoyed upon hearing this. “Please speak, Junior Brother!”

“The condition is simple,” Lu Yang said softly, “Senior Brother must give me the original copy of the secret art. Otherwise, what if Senior Brother goes back on his word later and doesn't give it to me?”

“Of course, you can set a restriction on the original copy of the secret art, for instance, one that causes it to self-destruct immediately if tampered with, and then you can unlock the restriction after three months. With Senior Brother’s magic power, the restriction can last for at least eighty years. This way, I’m at ease, and you’re at ease. What do you think, Senior Brother?”

Zhao Xuhe thought about it. It seemed there was nothing wrong with it?

The only issue was that his magic power was limited, and the restriction would automatically unlock after eighty years when his magic power was exhausted. But by then, it would be too late.

One must know that the lifespan of a Qi Condensation cultivator is around one hundred and fifty years.

And once past a hundred years, with essence, qi, and spirit weakening, there was basically no hope of breaking through to Foundation Establishment.

Lu Yang was already over twenty this year. Eighty years later, he would definitely be over a hundred, practically with one foot in the grave. Even if he obtained the Foundation Establishment secret art, it would be useless.

After all, this life would almost be over; how could he establish his foundation then?

In the next life?

The more Zhao Xuhe thought about it, the more he felt that Lu Yang's ability to propose such a well-thought-out plan, which both achieved the transaction and avoided mutual suspicion, was truly a win-win!

“Junior Brother’s request is entirely reasonable. Let’s do it!”

Zhao Xuhe nodded decisively, immediately took out another jade slip, first condensed his magic power to engrave a restriction on it, and then handed it to Lu Yang.

Seeing this, Lu Yang naturally took it with a smile.

For a moment, both host and guest were pleased.

*From now on, Zhao Xuhe is basically useless.*

*If he can return alive, then so be it. If he really causes trouble, I won’t intervene. At worst, I’ll wait eighty years to look at the secret art.*

*Either way, I don’t lose anything.*

After seeing Zhao Xuhe off, Lu Yang hummed a little tune, happily setting up his market city. After all, this market city was now his foundation for survival.

Moreover, the Hundred Bones Returning to Truth Grand Formation within the market city was a seventh-grade formation, while his Blood-Washing Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram was only ninth-grade, its power relying entirely on the Heavenly Demon Blood Transformation Divine Light. Therefore, if he could thoroughly understand the Hundred Bones Returning to Truth Grand Formation, it would significantly help his formation attainments through analogy.

Soon, time flowed by.

In the blink of an eye, another month passed. Lu Yang awoke from his meditative trance, suddenly feeling a fragrant breeze. Then, he saw a graceful figure walk into the Blood-Clad Tower.

“Senior Sister…”

Lu Yang smiled, saying, “You don’t visit the Three Treasures Hall without a reason. Could it be that Senior Sister has gained some new insights into formations and wishes to exchange pointers with me?”

“How many times have I told you, just call me Feixia.”

Immortal Feixia glared at Lu Yang impatiently, then habitually sat into Lu Yang’s embrace before softly saying, “Someone from the Sacred Sect has arrived.”

“Haven’t they already arrived?”

Lu Yang said nonchalantly, “I said it last time; I just want to cultivate peacefully and have no intention of stirring up trouble. I’m not interested in that Witch Ghost Secret Realm.”

“The person who came this time is different.”

As Immortal Feixia said this, Lu Yang’s eyes immediately narrowed. “…Who is it?”

“It’s the Second Senior Brother.”

Immortal Feixia’s expression was serious. “The Second Senior Brother of the Three Rivers Association, a True Disciple at Qi Condensation Grand Perfection. This time, he personally sent me to deliver the message.”

Lu Yang’s expression gradually darkened upon hearing this.

Because if he remembered correctly, the founder of the Three Rivers Association, that large internal faction within the Sacred Sect… was a True Immortal at the Foundation Establishment realm, right?
