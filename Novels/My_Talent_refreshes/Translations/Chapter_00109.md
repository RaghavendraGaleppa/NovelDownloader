# Chapter 109: Secret Mission Location

From being enveloped by white light to directly entering the restriction, it was but a blink of an eye. Chu Ning had no time to react before Ling Xiaobai brought him into the restricted area.

Caught off guard, Chu Ning's face immediately fell when he found himself in a completely different place. "The spiritual energy is so dense. Did I accidentally stumble into the Inner Sect?" he wondered, then lowered his head to look at Ling Xiaobai, gritting his teeth in frustration. "You're going to get me killed!"

However, after looking around, Chu Ning quickly overturned his initial judgment. He was indeed in a mountain range, but the trees were lush and green, completely unlike a place where cultivators would reside or frequent. "Is this some forbidden ground of the sect?" A thought flashed through his mind, and Chu Ning's expression remained grim. "Stinky Xiaobai, quickly take me out!" he ordered Ling Xiaobai. He didn't want to cause trouble by accidentally entering some forbidden area of the sect.

"Ying, divine ability not recovered."

At this moment, Chu Ning sensed Ling Xiaobai's spiritual transmission and could only force a bitter smile. Clearly, Ling Xiaobai's act of enveloping him in white light and entering the restriction must have been some divine ability it acquired after becoming a First-Order High-Grade demonic beast. However, using this ability might come at a cost, making it temporarily unable to recover.

"How long will it take?" Chu Ning asked Ling Xiaobai.

"One day," Ling Xiaobai replied.

Chu Ning sighed in relief upon hearing this. They had planned to depart from the sect for Yanji Market early on the day the market opened, so there was still time. If he were to suddenly disappear from the sect, it would be difficult to explain.

"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai called out to Chu Ning, signaling him to follow.

Chu Ning asked around and, after confirming there were no other cultivators or demonic beasts, hesitated for a moment but still followed Ling Xiaobai forward. If he could leave, Chu Ning would undoubtedly turn around and walk away without a second thought. But since he couldn't leave and was already in this place, he might as well figure out exactly where this was.

As Chu Ning followed Ling Xiaobai, he also released his divine sense to scan the surroundings. However, aside from trees and mountains, there was truly nothing else.

Aside from the dense spiritual energy, there was no obvious difference from most mountains in the Green Gorge Mountain Range. What Chu Ning found strange was that this restricted area seemed to have certain rules. While spiritual power could be used, Chu Ning found himself unable to fly when he attempted to ride the wind, and his Windchaser Shuttle couldn't fly either. He also tried taking out an escape talisman, but it was likewise unusable. This place seemed to prohibit all escape techniques, forcing Chu Ning to walk on the ground. Fortunately, having undergone spiritual power marrow cleansing and being a body cultivator, his pace was naturally not slow.

During this time, Chu Ning experimented again and found that the Wind Riding spell wasn't entirely unusable; as long as he didn't take to the air, it was fine. However, this ground-level wind-riding halved his speed.

After walking for about half an hour, Chu Ning arrived at a mountain hollow. He noticed that the spiritual energy here was even denser than on the path he had just taken. He speculated that Ling Xiaobai's spirit fruit must have been picked here. Indeed, after a few more steps, Chu Ning saw a thorny shrub bearing four or five red spirit fruits, looking exactly like the one Ling Xiaobai had just eaten.

"Help me pick them," Ling Xiaobai's spiritual message echoed in Chu Ning's mind.

Only then did Chu Ning realize that the little creature had brought him here to help it pick these spirit fruits. Vaguely guessing a possibility, Chu Ning asked Ling Xiaobai, "You can only eat one at a time? Do these need to be picked and preserved?"

"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai chirped, nodding its head repeatedly.

Chu Ning immediately took out a jade box from his storage pouch and carefully picked the spirit fruits, placing them inside. "Alright, the items are picked. Where do we go now?" Chu Ning asked Ling Xiaobai after putting the jade box back into his storage pouch.

"Ying!" Ling Xiaobai chirped, looking like it knew the way, and led Chu Ning further forward.

As Chu Ning walked, he sensed that the spiritual energy indeed grew denser in this direction. After walking for another significant half-hour, they arrived at a flat clearing. Chu Ning stopped, intending to tell Ling Xiaobai that they should head back. After all, flying was impossible here, and walking too far would make the return trip difficult. He wanted to leave this place as soon as Ling Xiaobai's divine ability recovered.

Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, his expression suddenly changed.

Someone was here. Ling Xiaobai also sensed something at this moment and quickly chirped "Ying" at Chu Ning. Chu Ning patted his spirit beast bag, taking Ling Xiaobai inside. He cast an illusionary transformation spell, changing his appearance. At the same time, his Tigerwood Spirit Body's aura changed, mimicking a Sixth-Layer Qi Condensation cultivator.

At that very moment, several figures appeared within Chu Ning's line of sight. All four were wearing green sect robes. To Chu Ning's surprise, they included both Outer Sect and Labor Disciples. The four also spotted Chu Ning, and one of them, an Outer Sect disciple with an aquiline nose, spoke to Chu Ning, "Oh, you're quite early." As he spoke, the few people came over to Chu Ning and sat down on the ground. "Let's wait for the others; they should be here soon."

Chu Ning was incredibly surprised. The spiritual energy here was clearly so rich, yet there were so many Outer Sect and Labor Disciples. Moreover, judging by their cultivation, the highest was the one who had just spoken, appearing to be at the Ninth Layer of Qi Condensation. The Labor Disciples were all at the Sixth Layer of Qi Condensation. Chu Ning's face remained calm, but something suddenly dawned on him. He decided to sit down with them.

Soon after, a few more people arrived. After about twenty people had gathered, the aquiline-nosed Ninth-Layer Qi Condensation disciple, who had first spoken to Chu Ning, slowly began, "Those who can come should be here. Now, everyone, please show your identity tokens." As he spoke, this person reached into his robes and, to Chu Ning's utter astonishment, pulled out a bamboo token.

The Yin Demon Sect! Chu Ning was aghast when he saw the bamboo token. It was identical to the one he had obtained from Qi Chongmao—the Yin Demon Sect's token. After him, the others also successively pulled out their bamboo tokens. Finally, when it was Chu Ning's turn, he lightly gritted his teeth and took out the bamboo token he had kept in his storage pouch, untouched until now.

"Good, everyone has seen them, no issues," the aquiline-nosed youth said, his face turning solemn. "However, we cannot be careless. The Green Stream Sect knew about our sect's infiltration early on. Our previous senior and junior brothers used the Yin Demon Malice to identify themselves. But later, the Green Stream Sect discovered it, which is why we now use these ordinary bamboo tokens. If there's any movement, they can be easily destroyed and eradicated.

This is how we were able to successfully reach this formation deployment site." He paused, then continued, "Perhaps something unexpected happened along the way, otherwise there would be more of us from the sect here. My idea is to be even more cautious. After we meet today and get to know each other, we should immediately destroy our identity tokens to avoid being accidentally discovered by the Green Stream Sect and causing further complications."

As soon as he finished speaking, everyone else agreed. So, they all crushed the bamboo tokens in their hands and immediately began to size each other up. Chu Ning naturally pretended to do the same with the others.

Meanwhile, the aquiline-nosed youth spoke again, "Now, let's exchange information. If anyone can successfully get out, please be sure to relay this information back to the sect. I'll go first. My name is Duan Yuewu, and I came in through the Green Stream Sect's Outer Sect Artifact Forging Hall. The Green Stream Sect has deployed the Five Elements Qiankun Array within this restricted area. It's highly probable, as our sect surmised, that they have indeed discovered a Spirit Seed here. We just don't know its attribute, nor the progress of the Spirit Seed extraction."

"Indeed, the Green Stream Sect has been sending so many Qi Condensation disciples away over the years, all gathered here for this Five Elements Qiankun Array. But so far, I haven't figured out where the entrance to this restricted area is."

"We seemed to have flown for a long time on the sect's Spirit Boat back then, so the entrance should be far from the sect. Oh, right, after entering the restricted area, I was teleported to a cave with a High-Grade First-Order demonic beast inside. If others hadn't drawn its attention, I probably wouldn't have made it to this place."

...

Everyone started speaking, one after another. Chu Ning listened carefully, gathering all the information. The general outline of the entire situation gradually formed in his mind.

After seeing the group, Chu Ning had vaguely guessed that he might have stumbled upon the Green Stream Sect's secret mission location. Now, it certainly seemed to be the case. And what the Green Stream Sect called a "secret mission" was likely what these Yin Demon Sect disciples referred to as "extracting the Spirit Seed." These disciples came in to power the grand array called the Five Elements Qiankun Array. Because only Qi Condensation disciples could enter this restricted area, and driving the Five Elements Qiankun Array was not easy, so many Qi Condensation disciples were required.

Moreover, after entering, they would encounter various demonic beasts and dangers, incurring significant losses. This was why the Green Stream Sect regularly organized disciples to come in. At the same time, driving the Five Elements Qiankun Array also seemed to offer benefits, as some disciples' strength could greatly increase. These individuals would then be reassigned by the Green Stream Sect to become Inner Sect disciples. Although he didn't know more details, Chu Ning finally had some understanding of the sect's secret mission.

As for why the Yin Demon Sect members were here, they must have learned of this news from somewhere, which led them to arrange for so many Qi Condensation disciples to infiltrate. Chu Ning even suspected that the Yin Demon Sect's previous attacks on them and other market disciples outside were very likely related to this matter. By killing some Green Stream Sect disciples, would their Yin Demon Sect infiltrators have a higher chance of getting in? The high-ranking officials of the Green Stream Sect must have long seen through this conspiracy, scrutinizing everyone's identity before entering the restricted area. Some Yin Demon Sect disciples must have been identified and eliminated directly. However, these individuals managed to evade the inspection using the simplest of methods. From the words of these Yin Demon Sect disciples, Chu Ning gathered that it took them a considerable amount of time to reach the so-called formation deployment site after entering the restricted area. They would then wait for a period before officially being assigned to drive the Five Elements Qiankun Array.

"Hey, what about you? What information do you have? Why have you been so quiet?" At this moment, Duan Yuewu's gaze fell on Chu Ning, a hint of suspicion on his face.

"My name is..." Chu Ning opened his mouth, preparing to casually fabricate a story like the others had. Just then, his heart tensed. With his sensitive divine sense, he detected many people rapidly approaching. The next moment, Duan Yuewu, at the Ninth Layer of Qi Condensation, also seemed to notice something.

"No good, we've been discovered!" he yelled, leaping to his feet. The others also sprang up in alarm. At that very moment, a group of figures appeared, and various spells were unleashed towards them.

"Kill all these little brats from the Yin Demon Sect!" Duan Yuewu's face changed drastically as he roared. "Damn it, run!" With that, Duan Yuewu bolted in one direction. However, when he looked up, he saw a figure even faster than him. It was Chu Ning, the one he had thought was unusually quiet.

"It must be this person who's problematic!" Duan Yuewu immediately made a judgment in his mind. At this moment, he increasingly felt that Chu Ning's earlier behavior had been abnormal. It was one thing for him to have arrived earlier, but he barely spoke a word the whole time. Despite appearing to be at the Sixth Layer of Qi Condensation, his reaction and escape speed were faster than his, a Ninth-Layer Qi Condensation cultivator. Thinking of this, Duan Yuewu immediately gnashed his teeth and chased after Chu Ning.

Chu Ning was indeed the first to react. When the later group appeared, he had already shot out. The subsequent events also helped Chu Ning roughly understand what was happening. Clearly, even Duan Yuewu and the others' actions today had already been detected by the Green Stream Sect. The reason they were allowed to gather was likely so they could be caught in one swoop. If it were any other time, Chu Ning would naturally applaud such a scene. But at this moment, the thought of being mistaken for a Yin Demon Sect disciple and being besieged sent shivers down his spine. He wouldn't believe that those senior and junior brothers would listen to his explanation. Therefore, Chu Ning had only one thought: escape!

Although escape techniques were unusable, fortunately, Chu Ning possessed another secret divine ability: Startling Thunder Steps! In two bounds, before the spells could even land, Chu Ning was already rushing back in the direction he came from. As expected, he quickly put distance between himself and everyone else; he didn't even notice any Green Stream Sect members keeping up. Thinking that his speed was extremely fast and that those people might not have noticed his departure, Chu Ning felt a slight relief.

However, when he extended his divine sense, his heart tensed. He vaguely sensed that not far behind him, there was another figure moving at extremely high speed, also following him. This figure hadn't entered the range of his divine sense, so Chu Ning couldn't pinpoint who it was. But when Chu Ning turned his head slightly, he could see a black light following him not far behind.

"Someone can actually keep up with my Startling Thunder Steps?" Chu Ning's face showed a hint of surprise. Although he used only ordinary Startling Thunder Steps after breaking out of the encirclement to conserve spiritual power, even so, it was still much faster than typical escape techniques. Yet, in this place where escape techniques were supposedly forbidden, someone was still able to keep up with him. How could this not shock him?

At this moment, Chu Ning no longer cared about conserving spiritual power. He took a bottle of Rejuvenation Pills from his storage pouch and popped one into his mouth. The next moment, spiritual power surged into his feet. He shot out with a "whoosh." With the enhancement of spiritual power, the Startling Thunder Steps' speed dramatically increased, and he rapidly widened the distance between himself and the person behind him.

However, to Chu Ning's slight astonishment, in just a short while, the black shadow behind him began to faintly glow red and actually caught up again.

"Could it be Duan Yuewu?" Chu Ning now had a faint guess. The other party was at the Ninth Layer of Qi Condensation and seemed to have been a member of the Yin Demon Sect for quite some time. It was highly likely that he had used some demonic secret art to keep up.

But this, paradoxically, made things difficult for Chu Ning. In a sense, it was better to be chased by Duan Yuewu, who thought he was a Yin Demon Sect member, than to be hunted by the Green Stream Sect. However, he needed to leave the restricted area tomorrow. If Duan Yuewu remained by his side, how would he handle it?

As he pondered this, the two of them ran one after another for a considerable distance. During this process, Chu Ning swallowed another Rejuvenation Pill to maintain his spiritual power at a relatively abundant state. Seeing that he wasn't too far from where he had entered the restriction, and the figure behind him was still in hot pursuit, Chu Ning frowned. He simply flickered his figure and hid in a patch of bushes. Simultaneously, his Tigerwood Spirit Body's aura concealment ability activated.

No sooner had he hidden than a black shadow, tinged with a faint bloody hue, appeared. Chu Ning looked up and saw that it was indeed Duan Yuewu. However, he didn't charge past as Chu Ning had expected. Instead, he stopped after only a few steps, then turned his head, slowly looking at Chu Ning's hiding spot, and coldly commanded, "Come out!"

Seeing this, Chu Ning sighed slightly in his heart. He had already realized that it wouldn't be easy to hide from the other party. After all, being unable to fly, he could only move on the ground, and the dense vegetation here made it too easy to leave traces. This was also why Chu Ning dared not continue forward. He didn't want to expose Ling Xiaobai's ability to bring him in and out of the restricted area.

Chu Ning slowly stood up from the bushes, deliberately putting on a slightly relaxed expression. "Senior Brother Duan, it's you! I thought it was someone from the Green Stream Sect chasing me. You gave me quite a fright."
