# Volume 2: Stealing the Immortal Herb - Chapter 93: Lightning Summoning Technique (Third Update Seeking Votes)

A look of gravity appeared on Qingling Zhenren's face as a terrifying spiritual pressure radiated from him, expanding outward. A dark cloud, ink-black with flickering lightning, gathered above the trio.

"Lightning Summoning Technique!"

Lin Xuan's expression darkened. This was a more advanced technique than the Palm Lightning, and the fact that the Fire Spirit Sect leader could wield it demonstrated his extraordinary cultivation.

After a moment's consideration, Lin Xuan retrieved the Jade Snow Ring and tossed it into the air. The palm-sized ring rapidly expanded, spinning above his head and emitting a hazy white light. With this additional barrier from a top-grade spiritual artifact, Lin Xuan now had seven or eight layers of defensive formations surrounding him.

Qingling Zhenren's expression shifted—where did this kid keep pulling these endless treasures from?

Qin Yan, noticing the jade ring floating above Lin Xuan, flashed a strange look before forming sword seals with her fingers. She directed the Autumn Water Sword to engage with the Fire Spirit Sect leader's solidified spiritual energy, hoping to alleviate some of Lin Xuan's pressure.

Normally, summoning so many artifacts would exhaust a cultivator of the same level, but Lin Xian still had energy to spare. The reason was simple: over the past year, besides consuming large quantities of Marrow-Cleansing Pills, he had also treated ginseng essence as snacks. The ginseng's essence refined his spiritual energy, enhancing its purity and quality. Combined with his spiritual sense, which rivaled that of a Foundation Establishment cultivator, he could effortlessly control multiple spiritual artifacts.

Qingling Zhenren's expression grew even more solemn. Though focused on casting spells, Lin Xuan still observed his opponent closely, noting every subtle change in demeanor.

A thought struck Lin Xian. He had witnessed the sect elders in action—their power could truly move mountains and part seas. Logically, a late-stage Foundation Establishment expert like the Fire Spirit Sect leader should be far beyond what he and Qin Yan could handle together. Yet, the opponent's current display of strength didn't match his cultivation level.

Qingling Zhenren wasn't holding back, yet he hadn't used any spiritual artifacts. Though unsure why, Lin Xuan sensed an opportunity.

With one hand gripping a spirit stone and the other channeling energy into the Hundred Souls Banner, a chilling wind howled as over a hundred vengeful spirits emerged, coalescing into a crimson skull that shrieked toward the enemy. After absorbing numerous yin souls and demonic essences, the banner's power had grown formidable. Nine eerie, dark-green ghost fires swirled around the skull.

Seeing the yin soul-formed skull, the Fire Spirit Sect leader's eyes flashed with malice. He spat a burst of vital energy onto his barrier, causing the yellow light around him to ignite like wildfire.

Then, he cast a spell toward the dark cloud above.

The cloud churned violently, as if boiling oil had been doused with water, its lightning flickering more intensely.

"Strike!"

With Qingling Zhenren's command, countless tiny bolts of lightning intertwined, forming a thick, bowl-sized bolt that crashed down toward Lin Xuan.

Lin Xuan's expression remained calm, though his pupils contracted slightly. Taking a deep breath, he unleashed his spiritual energy like a bursting dam. Waves of cyan energy visibly poured into the layered defenses before him.

Crack!

The lightning struck, shattering the Jade Snow Ring's white barrier in seconds. Several lower-tier defensive talisman barriers were pierced in succession. However, after breaking through four layers, the Lightning Summoning Technique was finally halted by a golden bell-shaped barrier.

A mocking smile tugged at Lin Xuan's lips. As long as the mid-tier barrier held, he was safe. With a wave of his hand, he summoned more low-tier defensive talismans, and the Jade Snow Ring returned to hover above him, radiating white light once more.

Disbelief flickered across Qingling Zhenren's face. How could a mere Qi Condensation cultivator possess so many talismans? Though the Lightning Summoning Technique was powerful, overusing it in his current state would harm him. After a brief hesitation, his expression hardened with resolve.

Just as he prepared to cast again, two sharp cracks echoed behind him. Turning in surprise, he saw his solidified spiritual energy dissipate under Qin Yan's assault.

Qin Yan extended a slender hand, casting a spell that caused the Autumn Water Sword to swell into a massive, azure blade several zhang long, its chilling glow striking fear as it slashed toward the Fire Spirit Sect leader.

Lin Xuan's heart leaped. Swinging the Hundred Souls Banner, he unleashed a surge of ghostly mist that enveloped the skull, which had paused its assault during the lightning strike. Empowered by the mist, the skull's aura intensified, shrieking as it charged toward Qingling Zhenren.

Lin Xuan recalled the Jade Snow Ring into his storage bracelet—not out of arrogance, but to conserve energy. With the opponent occupied, there was no need to waste spiritual power on defense. Against a stronger foe, efficient energy allocation was key.

The enlarged Autumn Water Sword crashed into the enemy's barrier with tremendous force, shaking it violently. Qingling Zhenren's face cycled from red to pale and back three times before the barrier miraculously stabilized.

Yet before he could sigh in relief, his expression soured again—the crimson skull was now within three chi of him.

"I underestimated them. I shouldn't have acted while injured," Qingling Zhenren thought bitterly. Lin Xuan's tenacity had exceeded his expectations, and with the famed Cloud Fairy aiding him, the situation had grown dire.

Gritting his teeth against the pain in his chest—his wounds flaring from the battle—he faced the oncoming skull with grim determination. Pressing his palms together before parting them, a pure white flame ignited in his hands.

The innate fire of a Foundation Establishment cultivator—a blaze capable of reducing all things to ashes!
