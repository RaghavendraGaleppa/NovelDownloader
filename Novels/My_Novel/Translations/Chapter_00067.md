# Chapter 67: A Body of Jade, Scalding and Intense

In the southwest corner of the village, in an area dense with dilapidated houses, lay a large, rarely visited courtyard containing two large坛 (vats).

Inside the vats was a blood-colored precious liquid. Even before approaching, a pungent, fishy odor assaulted the nostrils.

"The Madam's beast blood medicinal bath is made by gathering the heart blood of a hundred beasts, along with over a hundred types of herbal medicines, placed in a cauldron and simmered over a slow fire for over a hundred hours."

"Of course, that kind of precious soup is naturally for the Madam's enjoyment."

"The two vats here are 'waste soup.' They are the dregs from boiling the precious soup, mixed back with fresh spring water and boiled again."

"Although it is waste soup, it is still of great help to us who are in the Mud Body stage."

"You have hunted many mutated beasts, so you deserve a share of the 'waste soup.' The Madam is fair with rewards and punishments, so you should be grateful."

Pang Long walked up to the large vats.

Firewood burned beneath the vats to keep the beast blood scalding hot. Only in this way would the medicinal efficacy not settle, and it would be repeatedly stimulated.

"But I'm telling you beforehand."

"These two vats of waste soup are at a very high temperature. Don't stubbornly endure it. If you greedily chase that bit of medicinal efficacy and end up stewing yourself alive, it wouldn't be worth it."

"I will also enter a vat to soak. By then, I will have no time to look after you. You must judge the limits for yourself."

Pang Long warned beforehand.

The vats were as tall as a person. If one were to soak inside, only their head would remain outside. Although the precious liquid wasn't boiling, it was exceptionally hot. Just a light touch with a finger would scald it red and painful.

"So this is what a medicinal bath is like," Li Xian thought, his knowledge broadened.

"It's not entirely like this," Pang Long explained. "Warriors eat, nurture, practice, and soak. There are a thousand ways to eat, a thousand ways to nurture, and similarly, a thousand ways to soak."

"This is the most common method of the Fire Soak."

"If you're ready, jump into the vat. Whether it's bitter or spicy, you'll only know after tasting it yourself."

Pang Long grinned, stripped off his clothes, and leaped into the air, reaching a height of ten feet. His figure was rough and rugged, but his martial arts skill was quite exquisite.

He fell into the vat without splashing a single drop of water, unwilling to waste a bit.

He held his breath and focused his mind, closing his eyes. The scalding heat from all sides assaulted him, the pain unbearable. His facial features twisted together, looking ferocious.

But if he wanted this medicinal efficacy, he had to endure it forcefully, using Qi circulation techniques to alleviate the pain.

In fact...

When the young masters of aristocratic families undergo a Fire Soak, they often apply a special medicinal ointment to their skin beforehand to keep their bodies cool and prevent burns.

But whether it was Pang Long or Li Xian, neither had such conditions.

In the end, the two were just picking up the things the Madam didn't use and treating them as treasures.

"Hu."

"This place is secluded. Pang Long must have set it up here to avoid being disturbed."

"A medicinal bath is before me. Even if it were a sea of fire or a mountain of knives, I must take the step."

Li Xian saw Pang Long's ferocious expression and tightly closed facial features, realizing he wasn't having an easy time. If he was like this, Li Xian would only have it worse.

He took off his clothes.

He grabbed the snow on the ground with both hands and smeared it all over his body.

Grabbing the edge of the vat with both hands, he exerted a little force, lifted his body, and jumped into the large vat. With a "splash," water splashed everywhere.

In the end, he couldn't achieve Pang Long's level.

The blood-colored precious liquid covered his entire body. A violent burning sensation swept over him from every part of his body.

Pain!

A dense, overwhelming pain.

Beyond the scalding heat was the pain of countless ants boring into him. It was the medicinal efficacy beginning to work on his physique.

"Is this what a medicinal bath is?"

As Li Xian muttered to himself, the moment he opened his mouth, a faint golden mist drifted out. It was the medicinal efficacy of the bath flowing into his body, but it leaked out through his mouth.

"No wonder Commander Pang keeps his mouth and eyes tightly shut."

Li Xian suddenly understood. He closed his mouth and eyes. His skin suffered the scalding, an indescribable pain, but a cool medicinal efficacy grew within his body.

It washed over every part of his body.

Nourishing his physique.

Unlike the [Heaven and Earth Essence] he had consumed previously, this was a physique-strengthening effect, used to increase strength, reinforce bones, and temper his vital energy and blood.

It placed his innate, broken, leaky Mud Body into a great fire to be baked and tempered.

Filling the gaps and mending the leaks.

"Commander Pang is right. If the physique is burned, it will have the opposite effect."

"I should know my limits. I'll hold on for another half-quarter of an hour, then get out!"

Li Xian knew that if he stubbornly endured, he could easily last another half an hour. But skin burns would affect his martial arts training for the next few days.

It wasn't worth it.

He focused his mind on absorbing the medicinal efficacy.

His skin flushed red. During this process, his skin seemed to become more resilient as well.

Pang Long's body was rising and falling slightly.

"The bottom of the vat is heated by the fire, so it's extremely hot. The burns on the soles of the feet are far more severe than on the skin."

The firewood beneath the vat burned vigorously.

His feet felt as if they were stepping on burning charcoal.

Li Xian suddenly had a stroke of inspiration. He executed the "Breeze Leg" and lightly kicked the vat. The vat didn't react, but the "waste soup" inside slowly began to rotate.

This was the "spinning force" of the Breeze Leg.

Li Xian had just gained some insight.

He kicked again, and the waste soup formed a vortex. Li Xian, caught in the middle, spun slowly. Using the rotation of the vortex, Li Xian's feet lifted off the bottom of the vat.

He was surprised to find that the scalding sensation on his skin had lessened considerably.

It turned out that this vortex made the soup's medium uniform, making it easier to absorb. At the same time, because it was deep winter, the temperature was freezing. The soup on the upper layer was relatively cool, while the soup on the bottom was exceptionally hot.

After forming a vortex, the two layers neutralized each other, reducing the scalding sensation somewhat. But overall, it was still very difficult to endure.

"Temper, temper."

"Who would have thought it would literally be 'stewing'."

Li Xian couldn't hold on any longer, but he didn't want to get out of the vat too quickly. He scooped up the soup with his right hand and threw it at the firewood.

The flames were reduced by more than half.

The temperature naturally dropped. In this way, he could hold on for a while longer without getting burned.

The medicinal efficacy trickled into his body.

His vital energy and blood were very vigorous.

His internal Qi also grew in response.

He had planned to get out after a quarter of an hour, but he ended up persisting for a full hour. Only when he felt he could no longer absorb any medicinal efficacy did he jump out of the stone vat.

The beast blood had congealed into filth, sticking to his skin.

"Hu——"

He threw a punch into the air, his bones cracking loudly, like firecrackers exploding.

Every time his muscles and bones grew stronger, there would be a similar reaction.

"Commander Pang is truly formidable. He can still hold on after being stewed in such a great fire for so long."

On the other stone vat, Pang Long's facial features were twisted, still stubbornly enduring. Unlike Li Xian, who was flexible, he only endured forcefully, but the medicinal efficacy he absorbed was definitely thicker than Li Xian's.

Not far away was a well.

There was flowing water in the well. Li Xian picked up a bucket and drew water. With a light pull, "哗啦" (splash), the bucket rose too quickly, spilling water all over the ground.

"My strength has increased so much!"

Li Xian was astonished.

This time, he controlled his strength and successfully drew up the cold water. He poured it over his body, and the filth was washed away.

Li Xian's entire body was fair and white. Under the moonlight, he looked like a fine piece of jade.

This medicinal bath made his skin tougher, his bones stronger, and his strength greater.

He benefited immensely!

His internal Qi also saw significant growth, far surpassing mere bitter training.

He put on his clothes and waited a moment longer. Just then, with a "splash," Pang Long also jumped out of the vat.

However, compared to Li Xian, he was much more disheveled. His entire body was covered in severe blisters, and the burns were more serious.

"So Commander Pang was the one stubbornly enduring," Li Xian thought.

Boom—

A faint, muffled thunder-like sound was heard.

Pang Long had also made great progress, gradually manifesting the third sign—his chest drumming like thunder.
