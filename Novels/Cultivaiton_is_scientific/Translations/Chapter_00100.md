# Chapter 100: Counterattack

Li Shiming screamed, his body convulsing uncontrollably as unimaginable pain seared through his soul. 

While Baili Jinyan laughed maniacally, he remained oblivious to the fact that Li Shiming still had enough mental capacity to analyze the formation disk on the ground. 

IBMz15 had recorded the intricate patterns on the disk's surface. Although Li Shiming didn't know the disk's name, the fundamentals of formations were universal. Being immersed in the disk's energy field allowed him to clearly perceive the flow of its power. 

Before his eyes, virtual energy pathways were being mapped out—dense and intricate like a spider's web. 

All these energy lines originated from the formation disk on the ground. While they appeared chaotic at first glance, they followed an extremely complex yet discernible pattern. 

An ordinary formation master wouldn't have been capable of such calculations. It was as if Li Shiming's brain had compressed months of the original formation master's work into mere moments—and continued calculating without pause. 

A human brain, even that of a cultivator, couldn't achieve this. 

But IBMz15 could. No matter how complex the calculations, they were well within the capabilities of a supercomputer. 

However, as the computations began, IBMz15's power consumption surged dramatically. To ensure stable operation, all nine shadow servants were mobilized to maximize the output of the perpetual motion generator. 

The 190 CPUs—masterpieces of human technology—unleashed terrifying computational power. 

Li Shiming's screams grew louder. Using the "Demonic Sound Infiltration" technique, IBMz15 multitasked—processing massive data calculations while simultaneously emitting processed screams through Li Shiming's mouth. 

Since these screams weren't infused with spiritual energy, their potency was greatly diminished. 

But precisely because they lacked spiritual energy, Baili Jinyan never suspected that Li Shiming—seemingly reduced to mere speech—could still mount a counterattack under such circumstances. 

Baili Jinyan was no ordinary cultivator. The number of cultivators who had died by his hand numbered at least eighty, if not a hundred. 

He had experience dealing with all kinds of cunning opponents. No matter how sly they were, none had ever bested him. 

As a true heir candidate of the Sacred Ice Sect, once he reached Foundation Establishment, his status would surpass even that of the sect's deacons. 

A glance at the two artifacts he wielded was enough to demonstrate his caution. 

The Spirit-Binding Rope was a mid-grade artifact specialized in sealing spiritual energy. Though classified as mid-grade, its value surpassed even high-grade artifacts. 

Normally, it could be used as an ordinary whip. But once it ensnared an enemy, its spirit-sealing effect rendered them helpless. 

Even Foundation Establishment cultivators below mid-stage couldn't break free from its grasp. 

The Soul-Piercing Needle was a high-grade artifact that targeted the soul directly—a rarity among needle-type artifacts. 

Once embedded in a cultivator's body, it inflicted continuous soul-rending pain that was impossible to endure. 

With such agony clouding their mind, even the most determined cultivator would be unable to focus, let alone plot an escape. 

Baili Jinyan reveled in Li Shiming's screams, his mood soaring. 

The cries induced a hallucination—as if he had become an invincible cultivator, with countless peers bowing before him and beauties flocking to his side. 

This was the hypnotic effect generated by IBMz15, amplifying Baili Jinyan's desires to their limits through Li Shiming's screams. 

The moment Baili Jinyan succumbed to the illusion, a cooling sensation surged from his spiritual vortex, jolting his mind awake. 

Though his spiritual root was metallic, he had trained in the Sacred Ice Sect's secret techniques, which granted formidable resistance to mental attacks. 

Had IBMz15's screams carried even a trace of spiritual energy, Baili Jinyan wouldn't have fallen prey so easily. 

Simultaneously, Li Shiming made his move. 

He summoned the bronze corpse, then stored both the Spirit-Binding Rope and Soul-Piercing Needle in his server room space. 

The bronze corpse grabbed Li Shiming's body and twisted through the air in an unnatural motion. 

Li Shiming wasn't idle either—he hurled a white phosphorus grenade and a thermite grenade from his server room space. 

The bronze corpse appeared beside the formation disk, tapped it a few times with its fingers, then flashed out of the energy cocoon's range. 

Though the sequence seemed lengthy, it was completed in an instant. 

Li Shiming knew all too well that Baili Jinyan wouldn't be easily subdued. The distraction created by IBMz15 wouldn't last long. 

Sure enough, Baili Jinyan was only affected for a single breath—but that was all the time Li Shiming needed to escape the formation's confines. 

"Bastard! You're dead!" Baili Jinyan roared in fury. 

He ignored the white phosphorus and thermite grenades on the ground. Like most cultivators unfamiliar with modern military explosives, he dismissed mundane objects lacking spiritual energy. 

He had every reason to be confident. Had Li Shiming been his equal, he might have exercised caution. 

But rage clouded his judgment. This mere fourth-level Qi Refining cultivator—this thief who had stolen his beloved—dared play tricks right before his eyes! 

Worst of all, he had fallen for it. Even if only for a breath's time, the humiliation was intolerable. 

His figure blurred as he gave chase. 

But the moment he touched the energy cocoon, it repelled him violently. 

The unexpected resistance sent him reeling from the impact. 

How could he have anticipated his own formation disk betraying him at such a critical moment? 

This was no malfunction. Li Shiming, still recovering his physical and spiritual strength, couldn't fully control his body yet. 

Instead, he had directed the bronze corpse to alter the formation disk's energy flow before escaping. 

The modification wouldn't last long before the disk self-corrected, but it bought enough time. 

Li Shiming knew escaping the energy cocoon wasn't enough. Given their disparity in strength, Baili Jinyan would easily hunt him down across the open sea. 

His sect identification jade—which could summon reinforcements—was still in Baili Jinyan's possession. Even if he had it, rescue wouldn't arrive before Baili Jinyan finished him off. 

Recognizing Baili Jinyan's ruthless nature, Li Shiming knew capture would mean instant death—no second chances. 

Inside the formation, Baili Jinyan shook his head, reaching for a formation-breaking talisman only to remember he'd already used it. 

In that moment of hesitation, both grenades detonated simultaneously. 

Li Shiming had triggered them upon release, but their chemical reactions required brief delays before explosion. 

Terrifying heat and shockwaves erupted from the blast centers—but confined within the energy cocoon. 

The formation disk's exceptional quality made its barrier far more resilient than anticipated. 

When the explosions erupted beside him, Baili Jinyan activated his body-refining techniques and defensive treasures. 

Under normal circumstances, the grenades' explosions wouldn't have threatened someone of his resources. 

But trapped inside the energy cocoon with the blasts contained, the compounded shockwaves magnified the damage exponentially. 

His defensive treasures mitigated some of the heat, but the reverberating concussive forces proved unbearable. 

As his life hung in the balance, an emergency safeguard activated automatically. 

His body transformed into a streak of light, ricocheting insanely fast within the cocoon—faster than even an early Foundation Establishment cultivator could follow. 

Yet the same barrier that should have enabled his escape now trapped him in a deadly pinball effect. 

Inside the cocoon, scorching heat and chaotic shockwave rebounds created an inescapable hell. 

Baili Jinyan's clothes disintegrated, revealing skin cracked but not ruptured—a testament to his peak Qi Refining body-refining cultivation, achieved through extravagant resources. 

His hardened body withstood the heat's internal damage, though his skin suffered. 

But the relentless shockwave reverberations inflicted fatal internal injuries. 

Li Shiming didn't flee. He waited outside the island, unsure of the explosions' full effects but certain Baili Jinyan would be severely wounded if he survived. 

He needed to deliver the finishing blow—Baili Jinyan couldn't be allowed to live. 

From the man's methods and words, his status was clearly extraordinary. 

Even disregarding that, his strength alone meant Li Shiming would have to flee to the ends of the earth to escape future retaliation. 

Strangely, the explosion wasn't as violent as expected. The island remained eerily quiet past the anticipated detonation time. 

Then he sensed a change—the Spirit-Binding Rope and Soul-Piercing Needle in his server room space had suddenly altered. 

When a fully refined artifact's owner died, the artifacts became ownerless and could be claimed by others. 

Previously, the artifacts had resisted his touch. Now, that resistance was gone—they could be refined at will. 

"He must be dead," Li Shiming realized with relief. 

The combined white phosphorus and thermite grenades had killed the terrifying Baili Jinyan. 

Without hesitation, Li Shiming re-entered the temporary cave. 

The energy cocoon had grown translucent, on the verge of collapse. 

Toxic fumes swirled inside—the aftermath of explosions whose flames had already extinguished in the oxygen-deprived space. 

Amidst the poisonous haze lay Baili Jinyan's body—remarkably intact. 

Li Shiming's eyelids twitched. What level of body refinement could achieve such resilience? 

If this was Qi Refining, how much more formidable would a Foundation Establishment cultivator's refined body be? Could his bombs even harm them? 

His reliance on explosives as a trump card now seemed precarious. Strengthening his offensive capabilities would require further study. 

Donning a respirator, he waited before approaching to dismantle the formation. 

Having already deciphered the disk's patterns, breaching it from outside—though complicated—was manageable. 

Energy pathways materialized before his eyes, far more complex when viewed externally. Identifying nodal points to create an opening demanded immense computational power. 

Within ten seconds, Li Shiming extended a finger—now fully in control of his spiritual vortex and energy. 

His touch at a critical node sent spiritual energy piercing through the formation's core. 

An opening appeared before him. 

Outside air rushed in as toxic fumes and residual heat blasted outward. 

Li Shiming conjured a spiritual hand to fan the cocoon, accelerating the air exchange. 

Once the interior was clear, he stepped inside. 

IBMz15 confirmed Baili Jinyan's death through Li Shiming's senses. 

Ignoring the corpse for now, Li Shiming approached the formation disk. 

With its owner deceased, the disk was now unclaimed. 

He activated the "Dragon Dotting Art," not to fully refine it, but just enough to control the formation without further calculations.
