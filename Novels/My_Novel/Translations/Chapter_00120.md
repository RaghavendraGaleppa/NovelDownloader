Chapter 120: Leaving the Manor, Upholding Justice

The Great Martial Empire's territory was vast and expansive.

The realm was divided into four great Heavenly Domains: East, South, West, and North. Each Domain was governed by "Daos," which in turn were subdivided into Prefectures, and further down into Counties or States.

Not long after leaving the manor, the setting sun vanished, plunging the world into pitch-black darkness.

The steed, "White Cloud," was not particularly fast, but its steps were incredibly steady. Li Xian sat outside the carriage, holding the reins, though the specific destination was not for him to decide.

Lady Wen sat cross-legged inside the carriage, resting and recuperating.

With nothing else to do, Li Xian pondered the "Azure Luan Palm" in his heart. He had already grasped this palm technique deeply and was simulating the variations of its moves in his mind, gradually filling in the gaps...

"Once every hour, ring this bell to drive away the demons," Lady Wen said. Just as she was about to sink into her cultivation, she suddenly caught a whiff of a demonic aura. With a wave of her fair hand, she tossed a black bronze bell out of the carriage.

Li Xian asked, "Lady, is this an exorcism bell?"

"Mm..." A voice came from inside the carriage. The Lady had already closed her eyes.

Li Xian caught the bell. It was completely different from the exorcism bell Pang Long had held last time; this was the genuine Demon-Deterrent Bell.

The purpose of this trip was to acquire medicinal herbs. The Lady wished to avoid unnecessary trouble, so she intended to drive away demons along the way to prevent any disturbances.

Li Xian shook the bell. Surprisingly, it made no sound. He channeled his Internal Qi into it and shook it again. Only a faint sound emerged. How could such a weak sound scare away demons?

Li Xian raised his Internal Qi, pouring a large amount into the Demon-Deterrent Bell, and shook it vigorously.

*Ding-a-ling!*

A sound rang out, carrying a mysterious power.

Immediately, rustling sounds came from the pitch-black depths.

The demons lurking in the shadows, upon hearing this bell, were frightened and scattered.

"Wow, there are really so many demons," Li Xian was startled. He knew demons existed in the world, hiding everywhere, but he didn't expect there to be so many.

When he was in Black River Village, he often went up the mountains to hunt. Sometimes he went deep into the mountains and stayed overnight in the wild if it got late.

But he had never encountered a situation where he was surrounded by demons.

Why was it so troublesome now that he was traveling with the Lady?

Actually, martial artists who have undergone a Body Transformation are naturally prone to attracting demons. Furthermore, Qingning County had been quite chaotic recently. Chaotic areas naturally became habitats for demons, which was why so many of them were eyeing them covetously. It would be much better once they left Qingning County.

Li Xian rang the bell every hour. Every time the bell rang, it inevitably scattered a group of demons.

But ringing the bell was not an easy task.

By the time he rang it for the third time, the sky was gradually brightening, and the demons had become fewer.

"There is a river up ahead; let us stop and rest," the Lady's voice came from the carriage again.

Li Xian looked intently and saw that a few miles away, there was indeed a river. He immediately stopped the carriage on the riverbank, in a patch of lush green grass.

"Lady, where are we going?" Li Xian asked.

"Chimu State, Fulai Manor," the Lady replied casually. However, Li Xian had never heard of either "Fulai Manor" or "Chimu State."

This was the first time he had truly left home. Although he had gone to Huangyu County before, it was to save his younger brother, and he stayed for less than two days.

During the rest period, Li Xian was unwilling to waste time and found a place to practice his martial arts whenever possible.

[Proficiency +1]
[Proficiency +1]

The Withering Sun Decaying Blood Swordplay became increasingly refined. When he swung his sword, it was fierce and overwhelming, the blade edge carrying a thick, scorching heat.

[Withering Sun Decaying Blood Sword]
[Proficiency: 1367/3000 (Proficient)]

Lady Wen watched from a distance, nodding slightly. This Li Xian could be considered "diligent enough to make up for a lack of talent." His aptitude was not top-tier, but his diligent and resilient nature meant his achievements would not be low.

She sat cross-legged, eyes closed and breath focused, seemingly cultivating some strange technique as well. After a long while, she slowly opened her eyes and murmured, "Cultivating like this is very ineffective; there are even signs of regression. Is there really no other way for the Silkworm Feather Jade Correction Technique?"

Lady Wen called out, "Come back, we continue heading southeast."

Li Xian heard this, stopped his sword movements, and hurried back to the carriage. However, he had just been practicing the Withering Sun Decaying Blood Swordplay, so his Yang Qi was rich and his blood was surging. As he approached, he felt like a wave of heat.

Lady Wen saw that Li Xian's Yang Qi was rich and the youth's vitality was strong, and she couldn't help but look at him a few more times. She said, "Fine, wait a moment. Go to the river and stabilize your breath."

The river water was cool. After soaking for half an incense stick's time, Li Xian's scorching sensation was suppressed. He acted as the driver again, continuing to drive the carriage southeast...

By the afternoon, they had already left Qingning County, and even left Qiong Tian Prefecture.

Traveling along a mountain plank road, the steed "White Cloud" stepped lightly, seemingly walking amidst clouds and mist. The plank road wasn't even as wide as the carriage, yet it could travel steadily upon it.

Knowing he wouldn't fall off the cliff, Li Xian relaxed.

Feeling as if he were riding the clouds and mist, he looked around, gazing into the distance.

He saw mountains intersecting, with a myriad of scenes. The mountain shapes were varied: some had strange, towering rocks; some pierced straight into the clouds; others were densely covered with green vegetation...

Further away, there was a silver-white waterfall cascading down, the surging waters flowing endlessly. It was truly something he had never seen before.

A hundred zhang? A thousand zhang?

It was likely far more than that!

"What a vast world. If a great man is born here and cannot experience it to the fullest, it would truly be a wasted trip!"

The magnificent scenery bolstered his heart. Li Xian took in the myriad forms of heaven and earth, and in his heart, he harbored the grand ambition to "ask the heavens for its height."

If Li Xian were traveling alone, he would really want to find a mountain peak right now, shout against the wind, display his spirit and胸怀 (chest/mind), and vent his ten thousand zhang of heroic spirit.

"Lady, what is this place?" Li Xian asked.

After a long while, the Lady replied briefly: "This is Yunshan State, a poor and barbarian land, with a terrain of many mountains and forests." The Lady, who was accustomed to seeing beautiful scenery, didn't find it particularly special.

They traveled like this for two days.

Although Li Xian had little time to practice martial arts, the "Withering Sun Decaying Blood Swordplay" rose steadily. Now, his proficiency had reached [1584] points.

He was only halfway to the Minor Success stage.

On the third day, Lady Wen wanted to enter a large city to buy some rare forage to properly reward the steed "White Cloud."

She was not familiar with this area and didn't know where the city center was, so she sent Li Xian to inquire.

The carriage stopped in the wilderness, while Li Xian, lightly dressed, walked along the road, believing he wouldn't have to wait long to see pedestrians.

"The footprints here are dense; it seems many people just passed by. Let's see if I can catch up and ask for directions."

Soon, he saw many chaotic footprints. Li Xian raised his Qi to his chest and followed the footprints. The further he chased, the more uneasy he felt, because the depth of the footprints on the ground was uneven, exuding a sense of panic and chaos...

Just as expected, after chasing seven or eight miles, he found traces of people.

He heard a clamor.

"You bastards! Hearing that our Yellow Dragon Army is coming, you didn't prepare a banquet for three days, send your sons and daughters, or voluntarily join the army. How dare you try to run away?"

"If you run and he runs, and everyone runs away, how can we accomplish a great cause? Most importantly, if you all run, what will our Yellow Dragon Army eat?"

"Brothers, show them your skills!"

"Let these lowly commoners taste our might!"

Up ahead, not far away, seven or eight commoners in cloth clothes, dragging their families and carrying their children, were surrounded by four soldiers.

The soldiers were mounted on horses, wearing armor, and holding long spears. They looked robust and fierce, full of malice.

They were clearly elite soldiers of the "Yellow Dragon Army," highly valued.

Li Xian looked intently again...

He saw blood on the ground; someone was already injured. It was a child of eight or nine years old, his body pierced by a long spear and lifted into the air.

"Hey, catch!"

The soldier shook his spear and threw the child into the air. Another man laughed heartily, "Watch my might!" His spear shot out, stabbing at the child.

"My son..." A middle-aged man knelt on the ground, wailing loudly. His family huddled together, their eyes filled with despair.

The child's breath was weak, he had no strength to cry out, and was about to die.

Li Xian's heart tightened. He had grown up in Qingning and knew that the Great Martial Empire was precarious, with various rebel armies making great waves.

Qingning County was in a remote location and had luckily avoided several rebellions in the past.

He was only seeing it now.

The corruption of the Great Martial Empire's court was naturally bad, but the various rebel armies were bloodthirsty and murderous, and not good people either.

Seeing their scene of cruelty, Li Xian frowned. "These people are truly hateful. It's a good chance to test my sword's might!"

He was eager to try, so he immediately drew his sword and charged, knocking the helmet off one soldier's head.

"Who?!" The four of them were startled in unison.

Li Xian replied, "Your grandpa." He thrust his sword diagonally upwards. The sword intent was thick, actually piercing through the armor, entering through the abdomen and destroying the liver and spleen.

One sword killed him...

"Kill!" The other three were both shocked and afraid. They charged on horseback, their long spears thrusting forward in unison.

Li Xian raised his palm and struck. His martial art manifested strangely; his Internal Qi turned into a green wave shadow, surging out. It blew the horses over, tumbling and turning, and their formation fell into chaos.

Li Xian leaped up, high above, and executed the "Three Suns Bring Prosperity" move, striking three times in a row. He killed all three men respectively.

The commoners were saved. Some hugged the dead child and cried bitterly, while others kowtowed to thank Li Xian for his great kindness.

Li Xian comforted them slightly, then got straight to the point. "I am passing through here by chance and wish to find a large city to rest. Is there a decent big city nearby?"

An old man said, "Benefactor, no... please don't... We just escaped from the city."

"What is the situation?" Li Xian frowned.

The old man said, "Three days ago, we heard that the Yellow Dragon Army was about to enter 'Xiang Le City,' so we prepared to flee."

"That damned county magistrate said it was all rumors and told us not to believe them. He even killed the rumor-mongers in the street."

"We were foolish and believed him completely. Unexpectedly, last night, the county magistrate himself ran away first. My family realized what was happening and hurriedly fled as well."

"It was already too late. The Yellow Dragon Army entered the city early this morning, burning, killing, and looting on a large scale. Some of their mounted personal soldiers are even capturing people for fun."

Li Xian asked, "The Yellow Dragon Army?"

The old man was just a farmer and didn't know much.

But from his mouth, Li Xian did learn that within a hundred-mile radius, Xiang Le City was the largest. Now it had been occupied...

"Alright, you all hurry and flee," Li Xian took out some water and rations and distributed them to the crowd.

He could only help within his means; he couldn't help everyone.

"Thank you, Benefactor, thank you, Benefactor."

The crowd kowtowed three times, took the water and rations, and ran off into the distance.

As for the four corpses... Li Xian searched them and took any money. Items like "armor" and "long spears," he also wanted to take; they could be sold for a good sum of money.

But he was traveling with the Lady, so it was truly inconvenient. He had to give up with regret.

He wandered around the area, rescuing several groups of fleeing commoners and clarifying the situation. Then, he returned to the carriage and reported everything to the Lady in detail.

The Lady frowned. "The Yellow Dragon Army?"

"These rebels and the like cannot achieve anything; they are no threat. But they do plenty of burning, killing, and looting."

"What a pity."

The Lady wasn't showing kindness or lamenting the injustice of the world for the commoners.

Martial artists who cauldron-boil refined food require a large amount of manpower to assist. Therefore, such indiscriminate killing was "pitiful" in her eyes.

Compared to the rebel armies, the Lady was a genuine Living Bodhisattva.

"Lady, should we still go to Xiang Le City? Within a hundred miles, I'm afraid only Xiang Le City can supply rare horse feed," Li Xian asked.

"The Yellow Dragon Army is no threat, but they have many people. We will simply take a detour," Lady Wen said calmly.
