# Chapter 41: Teacher Ice Block Comes Online, Li Mo's Strange Talent

After Elder Hanhe left.

"Elder Shangwu, do you have any arrangements for Li Mo these past few days?" Ying Bing asked.

Shangwu squinted her almond-shaped eyes slightly, thought for a moment, and said, "Besides cooking, there's nothing particularly important."

"Then I'd like to trouble you to lend him to me for three days. I want him to learn swordsmanship from me for three days," Ying Bing said softly. After all, she wasn't Li Mo's master. If she wanted to teach him something, she still had to ask the 'rightful owner'.

"Little Bing'er, I trust your swordsmanship, but three days... he won't learn much, will he?" Shangwu nodded in agreement, a hint of curiosity in her voice.

"I have this." Ying Bing took something out from her sleeve: three sky-blue incense sticks.

"Spirit Rhinoceros Incense? The Sect Master even gave you this? How generous..." Shangwu's almond eyes widened slightly, clearly aware of the item's value. This wasn't a product of the Eastern Barren Domain. It originated from the Central Divine Province, crafted from a rare treasure called Spirit Rhinoceros Wood, ground into powder, and refined with other precious materials. Igniting it to comprehend martial arts could greatly enhance one's intellect.

However, Spirit Rhinoceros Wood grew slowly, only an inch every three hundred years, making its yield extremely scarce. The sect likely didn't have much left; what they did possess was passed down from the founding patriarchs, saved meticulously by successive sect masters. Giving Ying Bing three sticks at once clearly showed how highly she was regarded.

Shangwu scratched her head, feeling a little embarrassed. It seemed all she'd done was give her disciple two martial arts manuals and mooch off his cooking...

"Wait, you mean... you're going to use the Spirit Rhinoceros Incense on Little Mo?" Shangwu snapped back to reality.

"Yes, it's useless for me to keep it," Ying Bing nodded.

"Alright, then I'll leave him to you. Tsk tsk... this kid is quite lucky." Shangwu nodded in agreement, smiling. It was the same as if she had used the good stuff herself, as long as her disciple benefited.

"Learn swordsmanship from you?" Li Mo had just opened another meridian. With eleven meridians, his small world had expanded by a few more zhang. Just then, he saw Ying Bing push the door open and enter.

"Yes, follow me downstairs." Ying Bing's expression was calm; she turned and went downstairs after speaking.

"What's gotten into her suddenly..." Li Mo scratched his head, seemingly understanding. The Ice Block wasn't one for many words. What happened under Clear Abyss — she might not have said anything, but she definitely remembered it in her heart. Good. With the Ice Block around, he could save himself a lot of martial dao insights. Although he knew he wasn't a natural swordsman, little Li didn't intend to give it up entirely. Besides, he didn't have any other martial arts he could practice right now.

On the open ground of Autumn Water Pavilion. In the bronze censer, green smoke curled gracefully. The scent of the incense, upon inhaling, brought a sense of clarity and mental activity. Li Mo knew this was good stuff.

"From 'Great Accomplishment' to 'Perfection,' it means you've truly made the martial art your own, no longer restricted by specific moves. Indeed, you won't even need to rely on sword forms anymore. Similarly, any sword move approaches the true essence of a sword dao; master one, and you'll understand a hundred."

Ying Bing pressed her fingers together and lightly brushed them against a nearby bamboo stalk. Immediately, traces of crane feathers appeared on it, but they weren't fiery red; they were ice-blue. Li Mo's eyes widened slightly, inevitably filled with awe. 'Fire Crane's Thousand Feathers' had actually been transformed into 'Ice Crane's Thousand Feathers' by the Ice Block. This showed that she had completely understood and mastered this superior sword art. And he had never even seen her practice it.

"The Transformation stage of your swordsmanship should allow you to freely control the timing, quantity, and position of your power's burst. You can even condense a thousand feathers into one, focusing it to a single point, like water dripping through stone." No sooner had she spoken than — *Crack!* — one of the crane feathers suddenly exploded, its power ten times greater than a single burst.

"What you need to do now is forget 'forms.' Pick up your sword."

"Okay." Li Mo drew out his chipped green steel sword. Just as he was about to make a move, a cool, soft small hand grasped his own, followed by the faint fragrance of a maiden wafting towards him. Ying Bing held his hand tightly. Li Mo: "!"

This felt different from when he jumped down Clear Abyss. Back then, in free fall, his mind was blank; he had no capacity to think of anything else. Now...

"Don't get distracted. I'll only guide you once." Her clear voice sounded beside his ear. Truly, hand-in-hand teaching. Even among her disciples in her previous life, many were incredibly talented, yet she would at most offer a few pointers. Ying Bing had never taught anyone with such seriousness.

"Okay." Li Mo composed himself and began to learn diligently.

A quarter of an hour later. Ying Bing released his hand and stood silently beside him.
