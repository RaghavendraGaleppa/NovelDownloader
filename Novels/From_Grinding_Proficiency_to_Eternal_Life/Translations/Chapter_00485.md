# Chapter 485: Irresistible Force

The divine martial phase, with its three heads and six arms and a killing intent that pierced the heavens, manifested almost instinctively in an attempt to counter this supreme pressure.

However.

The moment the phantom arms began to solidify and a sliver of True Martial divine light began to rise, a gentle, invisible force that pierced through the soul gently swept over them.

Like melting spring snow, the ferocious Divine Martial Foundation, strong enough to clash with a Golden Body, was silently and soundlessly suppressed back into the depths of Xu Yunfan's body.

He could not break free!

He could not resist!

At this moment, the gap was no longer a matter of power, but a disparity in essence. It was a suppression of status.

Although the other party was still at the Foundation Establishment realm, the manifestation of Amitabha's Incarnate Body had granted it a trace of a True Lord's might.

No matter how much Xu Yunfan flushed his face red, he could not bring his own Dao Foundation to erupt.

In the utter silence, Sanzang's voice—or rather, the voice of the seated phantom—resounded calmly at the very depths of Xu Yunfan's heart. It was devoid of emotion yet carried an ethereal and majestic quality that transcended endless time and space, as clear as his own thoughts.

"Good. Your karmic connection with the Buddhist sect is a matter of predestination. It is neither karma nor an obstacle, but a Great Bodhi Seed, a Great Gate of Convenience.

The Eastern Wilderness is ignorant, plagued by countless demons. Only the universal salvation of the佛法 can resolve the suffering of all sentient beings.

Even after enduring countless kalpas and tribulations, you will ultimately become the Dharma-protecting Bright King for the transmission of my Buddhist teachings to the East.

This bond was determined long ago within the net of Indra, and cannot be changed by this body or this world. You cannot escape."

Every word seemed to be etched upon the river of time and space, carrying an undeniable sense of fate.

There was none of the previous 'compassion' or 'firmness' of Sanzang, only a calmness that stated a foregone conclusion. It was as if he were stating that 'the sun rises in the east and sets in the west,' so certain that Xu Yunfan's destiny was to convert to Buddhism and become the guardian of its transmission to the East, with no other option.

You cannot escape!

These three words were like invisible shackles, instantly locking onto Xu Yunfan's heart.

A great sense of despair and powerlessness surged forth, as if he were facing the very operating rules of the universe. This feeling was even more terrifying than the suppression of the Golden Body before. Because previously, he was fighting a tangible enemy, but now, it felt as if he were opposing 'Heaven's Will'!

But in the next instant, this despair was torn apart by an unyielding and fierce resolve that sprang from his very marrow!

Cannot escape?!

To hell with your Buddhist karma!

This old man refuses to believe in this evil!

A startling brilliance suddenly erupted from Xu Yunfan's eyes, and the Martial Dao Heavenly Eye between his eyebrows widened in a furious glare.

He did not hesitate for a moment, nor did he attempt to shake that irresistible existence.

Just as the calm voice had yet to fully fade, an unprecedentedly dazzling light of escape burst forth from his body.

*Boom!*

The coiled dragon and snake transformed into a light of escape, pushed to its absolute limit by him. The true energy within his body burned recklessly, disregarding the consequences.

His entire form transformed into a pitch-black meteor that tore through the sky. Abandoning all defense and forgoing any offensive posture, he hurtled towards the massive sword peak that rose from the ground and pierced the clouds—the mountain gate of the Wansheng Sword Sect—at a speed far surpassing his previous limits.

"Hm?"

The seated phantom, or rather the will that now dominated it, seemed slightly surprised by Xu Yunfan's so decisive and resolute escape.

What was manifested before him now was no longer the monk originally known as Sanzang. More accurately, this body and the manifested 'Amitabha's Incarnate Body' phase was a projection Dharma Body refined by the boundless Buddhist power of the Bodhi Pure Land, carrying the descent of Amitabha's supreme will.

However, enlightenment did not mean replacement.

This Dharma Body was not a puppet completely possessed by the Buddha. Its inner core still retained the 'self-phase' of Sanzang as the 'one who was enlightened.' That is to say, the subjective perspective and individual feelings of 'Sanzang,' which naturally formed and operated independently from the moment of enlightenment, still existed.

The Buddha's will was like a vast and mighty ocean enveloping and guiding this body of water, but the water itself still had its own flow and fluctuations. The shock, confusion, and absurdity belonging to 'Sanzang' still truly existed in the depths of this sea of consciousness.

Immediately after, a calm and unperturbed expression appeared on the face of 'Sanzang,' transforming into a 'solemn and majestic visage' that was both compassionate towards the world and grandly supreme.

He did not immediately出手 to block, but simply locked onto the escaping light with his divine sense. His grand voice, like rolling thunder, chased after Xu Yunfan's figure and spread with a boom:

"Obstinate in your ways, the calamity is inescapable. The Demonic Path's sins run deep, and karma entangles you. The Wansheng Sword Sect ahead is the leader of the righteous sects, its sword锋 pointing towards the slaying of demons and elimination of evil. When they see you, burdened with demonic qi and with a foundation deeply rooted in demonic arts, how could they save you? They would only join forces with my Pure Land to slay the evil demon together and protect the righteous path! Turn back to the shore, convert to my Buddha, and you may still attain the Bodhi fruit, sparing yourself the suffering of soul-scattering! Benefactor, you must think this through carefully."

This voice clearly reached Xu Yunfan's ears as he flew at full speed, and also echoed like a muffled thunder throughout the heavens and the earth. It was highly seductive and struck right at the要害.

It pointed out his identity as a member of the Primordial Sect and the stance of the Wansheng Sword Sect in eliminating demons and defending the Way.

Xu Yunfan paid no heed.

Setting aside the Cloud Scripture Clone hidden in the Divine Martial World, even if it were the Foundation Establishment Fifth Life Cycle, he could still break away from this threat. Although the Fifth Life Cycle of Foundation Establishment traverses the Sea of Bitterness, each life more difficult than the last, and there is still a question as to whether one can awaken past-life wisdom in the end, it is undoubtedly a method to sever ties with his previous life.

The grand Buddhist sound that could disturb the mind and shake the Dao Heart was now completely shut out by the madness and desire for survival burning in his heart. He simply burned his magical power with all his might.

He burned everything usable within his body, even growing a pair of winged magical treasures on his back. With a single flap of his wings, he traveled dozens or even a hundred miles, pushing his escape speed to the absolute limit.

In his eyes, there was only the Wansheng Sword Peak mountain gate, which was getting closer, larger, and radiating an awe-inspiring sword intent.

The mountain gate of the Wansheng Sword Sect was built upon a solitary peak. This peak was no ordinary mountain; its form was straight and steep, piercing the clouds, its entire body as black as profound iron. The mountain itself seemed to be naturally covered with countless sword marks, each radiating a sword qi that was either sharp, heavy, or ethereal.

The entire peak was like an unrivaled divine sword plunged into the earth, the source of the sword intent here, and a symbol of the sect's supreme majesty. The peak was hidden deep within the clouds, invisible to the eye.

Closer.

Even closer.

The vast and mighty sword intent pressure rushed to meet him, stabbing at his very soul.

Xu Yunfan could even see the astonished looks of the low-level disciples of the Wansheng Sword Sect on the huge plaza at the foot of the mountain as they looked up.

The phantom of 'Sanzang' remained seated, its gaze following the escaping light. It seemed to find Xu Yunfan's frantic escape into the arms of a mortal enemy to be the most foolish and ridiculous behavior in the world.

On that solemn and majestic face, between those lowered eyebrows, there seemed to be an indescribable meaning—not mockery, but a kind of indifference that saw through everything yet found it somewhat... absurdly comical.
