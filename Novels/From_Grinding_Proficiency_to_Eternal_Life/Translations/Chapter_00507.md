# Chapter 507: Exchange and Transference

Subsequently, they were led to an elegant, quiet chamber.

In but a moment, the Sect Master appeared.

He wore a simple, dark green Daoist robe, his features indistinct as if shrouded in a hazy halo. Only his eyes were as deep as the sea, and within their opening and closing, it seemed as if sun and moon rotated and thunder was born and extinguished.

An indescribable, gentle, yet boundless aura, akin to Heaven and Earth itself, spread out, causing Xu Yunfan’s heart to immediately pound with alarm.

Even Wukong’s桀骜, unruly expression unconsciously softened slightly.

This person’s strength far surpassed imagination.

He was certainly no ordinary Golden Core True Lord! No wonder Sanzang was so cautious.

Was this the “Universal Salvation True Lord”?

Xu Yunfan’s heart chilled.

Mid Golden Core?

Or a Great True Lord of late Golden Core?

The Universal Salvation True Lord did not speak much, merely letting his gaze linger on Sanzang and Wukong for a moment, especially sweeping over the four Immortal Peaches.

He casually waved his sleeve, and four jade plates appeared out of thin air. On the plates lay four Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiendish Immortal Peaches, just plucked and still steaming with spiritual energy.

They were identical to those picked in the main hall.

“I, a humble Daoist, had a sudden realization and knew that honored guests were coming from afar to form a karmic bond. These mere spiritual fruits are not worth mentioning. Please enjoy them at your leisure. I have urgent matters and must return to the mountain sect. I shall return in three days. Please stay as guests for now. We shall discuss matters with the Venerable One upon my return.”

The True Lord’s voice was calm and gentle, betraying no emotion. After speaking, his figure dissolved like ink in water, fading away, leaving only a lingering trace of Dao charm for a long time.

It seemed his only purpose in appearing was to gift the peaches.

Xu Yunfan, watching from the side, naturally said nothing more.

The Primordial Sect was known as the Primordial Demon Sect, but sometimes even the Bodhisattva and Pure Land had to grit their teeth and address them as Daoist Lords.

Sanzang closed his eyes and recited sutras, treating the jade plates and Immortal Peaches as if they did not exist.

Wuneng could not hold back any longer. He snatched the two peaches belonging to him and Sha Wujing, and with a nimbleness that belied his fat body, swallowed them whole.

In an instant, his pig-like face flushed red. Thick Earthly Fiendish Qi and a trace of water vapor spewed from his mouth and nose. His body swelled like a balloon, letting out a satisfied grunt. His blood and energy churned, and he clearly benefited immensely.

Sha Wujing was much steadier but was also quite impatient. He ate the peach wreathed in Earthly Fiendish Qi in small bites, then sat cross-legged. The aura of black water around him surged and rushed.

Xu Yunfan held his own portion and the one meant for Sanzang. Feigning an eagerness that dared not be disrespectful in the True Lord’s Temple, he swallowed them in one gulp.

In the Cold Crow Pass of the Northern Continent, tens of thousands of miles away, Xu Yunfan’s heart stirred.

He flipped his hand, and two fruits, glowing with radiance and possessing a strange, alluring fragrance, condensed with the aura of Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiendish Qi, appeared in his hand.

The exchange method within the Profound Capital Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Scripture, aided by the Attribute Panel, had the miraculous effect of turning decay into magic, allowing him to move objects through thin air.

These two fruits, one was entirely entwined with fine, silk-like purple lightning arcs, crackling with sound, faintly radiating the domineering destructive aura of the depths of the Nine Heavens Thunder Prison.

The other was entirely pitch black, its surface seeming to condense the cold glint of ancient stars, deep and heavy. Within, it faintly revealed the grand pressure of the Ninefold Celestial Palace and the vast, boundless atmosphere of the Dark穹 (Xuanqiong).

These were precisely the auxiliary Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiendish Qi condensations capable of bearing the subsequent cultivation paths of the *Mystic Capital Nine Celestial Dark穹 Indestructible Scripture*.

Although the Gang and Fiendish Qi contained within these two Immortal Peaches still had a slight gap compared to the most perfectly compatible core origin fiendish energies described in the scripture—such as Heavenly Gang of the Mystic Purple Mansion and Earthly Fiendish of the Nine Celestial Dark穹—they were not extremely suitable for the cultivation needs of the *Mystic Capital Nine Celestial Dark穹 Indestructible Scripture*.

However, the Thunder attributes and the Nine Celestial Dark穹 atmosphere contained within were already rare. They were enough to serve as a catalyst to help him break through his current bottleneck and re-enter the mid Foundation Establishment perfection realm.

With these as the catalyst for the fire, combined with his Great Achievement realm of the Mystic Capital Golden Body foundation, plus the deduction and optimization of the Attribute Panel, he would surely break through smoothly, and his strength would see a great leap.

At that time, he would only need to condense the embryonic form of his inner heaven and naturally step into late Foundation Establishment.

Moreover, with this method of practice, he should be able to gain another Divine Ability.

But what made Xu Yunfan’s main body even more excited was that just as his Divine Sense swept over that Immortal Peach Tree, he clearly sensed that deep within the canopy, there were four other Immortal Peaches radiating an origin aura that made his very blood boil.

The four fruits contained the core records within the *Mystic Capital Nine Celestial Dark穹 Indestructible Scripture*’s secret manual: the ‘Mystic Purple Mansion Destruction Heavenly Gang’, ‘Nine Celestial Dark穹 Suppressing Prison Earthly Fiendish’, and the mutually generating and restraining ‘Supreme Clarity Cleansing Origin Demon Fiendish’ and ‘Zodiac Dipper Pivot Splitting Golden Gang’.

These four origin Gang and Fiendish Qi perfectly matched the fundamental principles of the Mystic Capital Nine Celestial Celestial Palace Imagery and the Dark穹 Indestructible Golden Body.

Once obtained and refined and fused, it would not only solidify his Foundation Establishment Dao Base but even allow him to possess the terrifying combat power to fight head-on against late Foundation Establishment, or even perfection, while still in mid Foundation Establishment. Crossing realms to battle was by no means an empty boast.

If he had to gather these four Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiendish Qi himself, his lifespan would likely be exhausted, and he would die of exhaustion without managing to collect them all. Gathering even one would be a stroke of great luck.

He must obtain them, no matter what!

Xu Yunfan’s expression was extremely excited. If necessary, it would be worth sacrificing the clone Wukong.

The scene shifted back to the Eastern Wastes, inside the guest room of the Zhenyuan Temple.

The night was deep, and the Dao Temple was一片靜謐 (a sheet of quiet).

Wuneng and Wujing, having digested the pure Gang and Fiendish Qi within the Immortal Peaches, had already woken from their cultivation.

Pig Wuneng rubbed his belly, which was still round but faintly showing a metallic luster, and couldn't help but smack his lips, muttering softly, "Big Brother, Junior Brother Wujing, what do you guys think... I, old Pig, didn't really get to taste the flavor of that Immortal Peach properly. I was too busy swallowing it whole. That marvelous Fiendish Qi started transforming as soon as it entered my stomach. I didn't get to savor any taste at all."

Sha Wujing also nodded in rare agreement, his low voice carrying a hint of aftertaste: "The Water Yuan power contained within that Earthly Fiendish Qi is extremely pure and refined. It truly is a good thing. Unfortunately, it was too vast. I didn't dare to distract myself while digesting it. If I could swallow another one, I might be able to enter mid Foundation Establishment."

The two men's gazes unconsciously drifted towards Wukong, who was sitting with his eyes closed.

Wukong’s eyelids slowly opened, and a sharp glint flashed in his golden eyes.

Xu Yunfan naturally watched silently from the depths of Wukong’s heart. Sometimes, he didn't need to exert himself to take control. He just needed to use the strong control provided by the Attribute Panel to slightly guide Wukong’s thoughts to get what he wanted.

Wukong, completely unaware that his thoughts had been passively altered, pondered internally.

*These two blockheads being gluttonous is just right.*

*That Heavenly Gang and Earthly Fiendish Immortal Peach Tree has excellent peaches. Several of the fruits' Gang and Fiendish Qi are extremely suitable for the Battle Buddha Scripture. And the other types of Gang and Fiendish Qi on the entire tree are also precious resources.*

*That Universal Salvation True Lord deliberately left this full tree of temptations and made the excuse of leaving for three days. He is clearly setting a bait.*

*Since the bait has been cast, how can the fish not bite?*

*Master fears trouble, but I do not.*

*Along the way, the demons have become increasingly powerful. I urgently need these Gang and Fiendish Qi to refine my Dao Base and Divine Abilities.*
