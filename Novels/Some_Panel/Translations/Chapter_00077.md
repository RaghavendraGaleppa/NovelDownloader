# Chapter 76: The Hope of the Entire Village

As they advanced, Gui Xiao quickly led the group to a sealed underground secret chamber.

At the center of the chamber stood a square altar, three *zhang* high, three *zhang* wide, and three *zhang* long. In the middle of the altar, a palm-sized mushroom astonishingly grew. The mushroom's cap was perfectly round, adorned with blue patterns that emitted a faint blue glow, pulsating rhythmically as if breathing. With each pulse, the blue patterns intertwined to form a lifelike ghostly head, appearing as though it wished to leap off the mushroom cap.

Since the secret chamber held no other furnishings, everyone immediately spotted the mushroom on the altar upon entering, and its miraculous appearance filled them with surprise.

"City Lord, what is this?" someone asked.

"Oh, this is the Sacred Mushroom," Gui Xiao replied with a smile.

"Sacred Mushroom?" Someone scrutinized the mushroom carefully, then suddenly exclaimed, "Is this a sacred medicine?"

"No, no, it's merely a minor sacred medicine; it's still a bit short of transforming into a true sacred medicine," Gui Xiao glanced at everyone, a profound smile playing on his lips. "However, it will soon transform into a sacred medicine because of you."

"Transform because of us?" A more perceptive and vigilant individual narrowed their eyes, scanning the chamber. "City Lord, what about the auction? Is this minor sacred medicine the item to be auctioned?"

"No, there is no auction at all," Gui Xiao said, still smiling.

"Hmm?" Hearing this, everyone frowned. Some more agile individuals had already begun to quietly retreat, for they perceived an undisguised killing intent in Gui Xiao's smile.

But before they could reach the passage entrance, they heard a resounding boom. The passage they had entered through slammed shut, forming an impenetrable stone wall. Their escape route had vanished, and the chamber truly became an air-tight, sealed space.

At the same time, blood-red patterns inexplicably emerged on the ground beneath their feet, rapidly interweaving and transforming into a lifelike, bloodthirsty beast with a gaping maw, as if it intended to devour them all.

"What is this?" Everyone recoiled in fear, some even leaping into the air.

"Heh heh, this is the Blood Refining Great Array. When you die later, your flesh and blood essence will be refined to nourish the Sacred Mushroom, prompting its transformation into a true sacred medicine," Gui Xiao revealed with a candid smile.

"What? You mean to kill us and turn us into nourishment for this Sacred Mushroom? How can this be a Sacred Mushroom? It's simply a Demonic Fungus, sucking human flesh and blood!" Everyone's expressions changed drastically. They instantly unleashed attacks on the sealed passage, but with each strike, a layer of spiritual light shimmered on the chamber's surface, dispersing their attacks and neutralizing them into nothingness.

"Don't waste your efforts. The walls of this secret chamber are inscribed with thirty-six defensive restrictions. With your strength, it will be difficult to breach them in a short time. You might as well just wait for death; why struggle?" Gui Xiao surprisingly urged them with a smile.

"Gui Xiao, you demon! How dare you act so brazenly and try to kill us? If so many of us disappear, aren't you afraid that the forces behind us will unite to completely eradicate your Eight Profundities City? And tear you to pieces?" someone roared sharply.

"Once I've killed you all, the Sacred Mushroom will have matured sufficiently. There's no longer any need to stay here. I can just move to another place and change my identity," Gui Xiao said with an indifferent smile.

"You demon, your actions are inhumane! Aren't you afraid of retribution?" Everyone was both shocked and enraged. How could they have imagined that the Eight Profundities City Lord, usually revered for his virtue and uprightness, was actually a demon? It wasn't that they weren't cautious, but that this demon had hidden himself too deeply! Truly, the Dao may be one foot high, but the devil is ten feet high.

"Retribution? Today, I am your retribution!" Gui Xiao sneered at the crowd and then abruptly retreated.

The attacks unleashed by some cultivators who had been secretly brewing their killing intent missed their mark, and while lamenting their misfortune, they also cried out, "Let's attack together! Kill this demon and destroy this demonic mushroom!"

Before anyone could charge forward, the entire secret chamber suddenly rumbled and shook. Rows of black grooves appeared on all four stone walls, including the ceiling, emitting a chillingly dangerous aura. Immediately afterward, sets of top-grade spirit artifact crossbows extended from these grooves. Each low-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolt loaded onto them was as thick as a calf.

Seeing these crossbow bolts, everyone's faces paled, and fear gripped their hearts. A single low-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolt was not terrifying, but the sheer number of dense low-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolts, fired from top-grade spirit artifact crossbows, would unleash absolutely potent attacks.

"No good, everyone be careful!" A Golden Core Peak elder's expression changed. He immediately summoned a spirit artifact and blasted it towards one of the stone walls, intending to destroy a row of powerful crossbows and create a breakthrough. But a crossbow bolt instantly shot forth, tearing through the air and forcing his spirit artifact back.

"Damn it!" The elder's face darkened, his heart sinking to the extreme.

"Quick, form a circle and defend together!" A seasoned Golden Core expert immediately shouted. Everyone understood that this was a moment of life and death and quickly moved, forming a circle to defend collectively.

*Thwang! Thwang! Thwang!*

The vibrations from each low-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolt firing were so clear. From the front, back, left, right, and above... bolts shot from all directions. Within the confines of this secret chamber, they couldn't move much, yet the farthest crossbow bolts were only ten *zhang* away, and the closest, from the ceiling, were merely five *zhang*. It was too close, too perilous.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The air was torn apart! Hundreds of thick low-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolts instantly crisscrossed, almost entirely engulfing and covering the entire secret chamber.

"Everyone hold on!" the crowd shouted.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Some Golden Core elders, wielding their magic treasures, perfectly blocked the crossbow bolts attacking them from the front. These old fellows were simply too experienced.

"Damn it, damn it!" However, the cultivators below the Golden Core realm were much more panicked. They struggled to resist with their magic treasures.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

The high-speed, head-on attacks from the crossbow bolts were too powerful; they found it very difficult to defend against them.

*Thump!*

A Foundation Establishment cultivator in his prime used a long saber to deflect a crossbow bolt. Though the bolt was bounced away during the block, he still felt its immense impact.

After one round, everyone barely managed to hold on. But in the next round, they discovered that the bolts on the top-grade crossbows had all been replaced with mid-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolts. They had struggled against low-grade spirit artifact crossbow bolts; now that they were facing mid-grade ones, most of them would surely perish.

*Thwang! Thwang! Thwang! Thwang! Thwang!*

The next round of crossbow bolts was fired. Arrows rained down densely, causing cold sweat to break out on everyone's brows.

"No!" *Pfft!* An arrow shot out, instantly piercing and exploding a Foundation Establishment cultivator's arm. Immediately after, another arrow approached his head, causing the young man to scream in terror, losing all presence of mind.

"Hmph!" Just at this critical moment, a flying sword suddenly shot out, deflecting the incoming arrow and preventing it from harming the young man. The one who acted at the crucial moment was precisely the white-haired elder who had come for the assessment. He chuckled, "Everyone, since the Dao Sect sent us to eliminate evil, how can we let villains commit murder before our very eyes? I sense that the other City Lords of Eight Profundities City are behind that stone wall ahead. They can't escape, so there's no need to worry about disturbing the snake anymore. Let's attack together!"

"Good, let's attack together!" the refined middle-aged man shouted.

Everyone explosively unleashed their powerful Golden Core Peak cultivation. The incoming spirit artifact arrows were deflected and shattered one after another. In the next moment, they combined their strength in a single strike. With a *bang*, they destroyed the defensive restrictions and blasted open the path, revealing the secret passage once more.

"It's the Dao Sect disciples! Haha, we're saved!" Everyone was overjoyed, and their fighting spirit instantly soared.

"You all, withdraw from the secret chamber first!" the refined middle-aged man shouted.

Without needing further instruction, everyone valued their lives like gold and quickly retreated towards the passage entrance. With Yang Ji and the others helping to block, it wasn't long before everyone had safely exited the secret chamber.

"You, Dao Sect disciples?" Gui Xiao's face darkened at this sight. These people had hidden their true strength; had he not personally tested them, he would never have been able to discern their real cultivation simply with his naked eyes.

"Hmph! Today, we'll take your heads!" The white-haired elder snorted coldly, exchanged glances with the others, and unleashed a combined strike towards the stone wall ahead. With a *bang*, the stone wall shattered, revealing seven figures hidden in the secret chamber behind it. Their gazes met, and killing intent flickered in everyone's eyes.

"Each pick one, kill!"

"Dao Sect disciples? Ruining my plan, you must die too!" The decisive, murderous man was the first to charge out, confronting the white-haired elder. The Dao Sect disciples also surged forward, engaging Gui Xiao, the silent bloodthirsty man, the old woman who toyed with poisons, the handsome young man, the middle-aged man manipulating flying needles, the short and ferocious strongman, and the enchanting woman holding a flute.

The remaining person was a barefoot, naive-looking little girl. She gazed at Yang Ji softly, observing him with innocent cuteness. Suddenly, she vanished from her spot.

Yang Ji only saw the information `Earth Evasion Technique` flash before his eyes. The next moment, the little girl eerily emerged from the ground in front of him, a silver dagger aimed directly at his Dantian. Yang Ji reacted swiftly, deflecting the dagger with a single sword stroke, then spun his flying sword, fiercely slashing towards the little girl. With a *clang*, the little girl was instantly sent flying several *zhang*. Her expression changed drastically, and she haughtily huffed, "Hmph, you're so forceful, I won't play with you anymore!"

With a flash, she vanished underground.

"Trying to run?" Her head was an assessment token; how could Yang Ji let her just leave? Although he couldn't use the Earth Evasion Technique, with the power of his 'Golden Finger', he could accurately determine the little girl's location. His sword continuously slashed downwards, sending sword energy deep into the earth, intending to kill her. The little girl was so terrified she screamed, constantly fleeing underground, even escaping the secret chamber and heading outside. Yang Ji cleared a path with his sword, continuously excavating a dirt tunnel, and pursued closely.

Meanwhile, back in the secret chamber, the battle raged intensely. Everyone confident enough to join the Dao Sect and participate in the assessment possessed extraordinarily powerful strength, far exceeding those of their peers. The masters' battle lasted only a few dozen breaths before a victor was decided. The white-haired elder's divine abilities and secret arts were formidable, and he quickly defeated the decisive, murderous man before him.

Just as he gleefully severed the man's head with a sword, the man's corpse instantly transformed into a wisp of black smoke. This black smoke then intertwined with the black smoke formed by the enchanting woman, who had just been slain by the energetic girl, forming a completely new person. A strange face, powerful strength.

Indeed, the combined power of the two intertwining black smoke figures was even more formidable, instantly sending the white-haired elder flying with a single move. In a mere instant, he absorbed the black smoke formed by the five other individuals who had just been slain by the others. His appearance changed again and again, transforming instantly into a fiendishly charming man with an effeminate air. He raised the blade in his hand and said with a low, gentle smile, "You all deserve to die! Not a single one of you will live."

"What's going on?" Everyone watched this scene in astonishment. Seven living people had suddenly turned into black smoke and merged into one? Before they could be too surprised, the fiendishly charming man gave a cold smile, and with a *whoosh*, he vanished from his spot. All they saw were afterimages flashing before their eyes, followed by flying blood and cries of alarm. *Bang! Bang! Bang!* In just an instant, besides the energetic girl, the white-haired elder, the cold youth, the refined middle-aged man, and the others were all heavily wounded and collapsed to the ground, their faces now pale with shock.

"His... his strength..." Everyone lay on the ground, their expressions horrified.

"Oh? You can actually take one of my moves? Interesting, let's go again." The fiendishly charming youth eyed the energetic girl, who remained standing, with surprise, then his expression turned sinister. The energetic girl had been concealing her aura, appearing utterly unremarkable, but now, as her killing intent surged, everyone could feel that this woman was completely different. Her gaze was like a blade, and her entire intangible aura made one feel a sense of sharpness and dread! This was the sharp edge of a true master, usually hidden within its sheath, but once unleashed, it would make hearts tremble.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The fiendishly charming youth summoned the curved blade in his hand. It moved at extreme speed, cutting an arc through the air, and attacked the girl.

"Hmph!" The energetic girl's eyes were filled with killing intent. With a flip of her right hand, a green longsword appeared. Wielding her sword to slay the enemy, the green flying sword *whooshed* as it shot out.

*Boom!*

The green flying sword was too fast; its tip created an arched vacuum, with air currents rapidly rushing backward, and the air tore with a terrifying sharp whistle. The fiendishly charming youth's face slightly changed upon hearing this sound. The green flying sword was too quick; in a single collision, his curved blade was instantly repelled. He had no time to take out another weapon to block and immediately flashed his figure, dodging aside.

*Thump!*

The flying sword struck the stone wall behind him, causing large sections of rock to explode. The green flying sword plunged directly into the stone, disappearing from sight.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The fiendishly charming youth successively pulled out several black curved blades. The curved blades were flung out, tearing through the air, their invisible aura pressing down on the energetic girl.

*Boom!*

The energetic girl's flying sword mysteriously broke through the stone wall behind her and *clanged* against several incoming curved blades. One curved blade grazed past the energetic girl, *boomed* into the stone wall, then eerily shot out from another side of the wall, the black arc-shaped blade attacking the energetic girl at extreme speed.

The energetic girl's flying sword was not currently being wielded. She swung the green flying sword, and in a blink of an eye, it formed a green sword lotus. The sword lotus was made of green sword shadows, and all incoming curved blades were cut apart. The force of the collision was immense, causing the curved blades to fly uncontrollably in all directions.

The fiendishly charming youth narrowed his eyes, recalled all his curved blades, and combined them to form a cold, gleaming long blade. He coldly shouted, "Seven-Spin Slash!" The black curved blade in the fiendishly charming youth's hand spun rapidly like a top, flying horizontally, its blade light shooting out in all directions with the rotation.

The energetic girl showed no fear. She held her flying sword before her chest, like a blooming lotus. In a flash, a sword lotus formed around her as its center. The sword lotus did not appear delicate; its petals were sharp and exposed, their sword qi reaching for the stars, grand and magnificent. The blade light shot forward, colliding with the sword light in the void, sparks flying and green smoke billowing.

This scene terrified the heavily wounded white-haired elder and the others, forcing them to retreat repeatedly. The battle between the fiendishly charming youth and the energetic girl was too intense, and the residual energy of their combat was extremely powerful; a moment of inattention could cause them severe harm again.

The blade light impact yielded no results, and the black curved blade went straight for the energetic girl. The energetic girl snorted coldly, her sword lotus contracting into a gigantic lotus sword, which directly slashed at the black curved blade.

*Clang!*

The black curved blade was directly cleaved away, spinning several times before returning to the fiendishly charming youth's hand. The sheer force of the impact made the fiendishly charming youth retreat three steps. Cold light flickered in the fiendishly charming youth's eyes, and his killing intent surged. He instantly transformed into three afterimages and shot out. Because of his extreme speed, the afterimages hovered in the air like real people, difficult to dispel.

The afterimages attacked the energetic girl from three directions, both illusionary and real, locking onto her, giving her no escape. "Inch Punch! Within an inch, I am invincible!" The fiendishly charming youth's cold voice emanated from the three afterimages.

"Lotus Bud!" The energetic girl let out a delicate cry. Her longsword danced, forming an unbloomed lotus that thoroughly protected her. As long as the lotus petals remained unbroken, she would naturally be unharmed.

*Clang! Clang! Clang!*

Countless metallic sounds echoed as iron fists and lotus petals collided innumerable times in an instant. The extreme speed and terrifying attacks failed to break through the energetic girl's absolute defense. In this exchange, the energetic girl clearly held the upper hand.

They separated with a single touch. The fiendishly charming youth retreated, his fists covered in bloodstains, clearly wounded by the sword qi upon striking the lotus petals.

The energetic girl withdrew her sword lotus and shook her head. "Your divine ability cannot break through my Great Realm Lotus Art. Outside the lotus realm, let the waves rage; inside the lotus realm, I remain calm as water. So, prepare to die!" The energetic girl raised the longsword in her hand, pointing it directly at the fiendishly charming youth, her eyes remarkably calm.

The fiendishly charming youth showed no anger at this moment. He said indifferently, "What a formidable 'Great Realm Lotus Art,' its defense is truly unparalleled. However, I have one more move, and I hope you can withstand it. When my blade strikes, I don't even know where it will cut. I call it 'Blade of Psychic Connection'."

The fiendishly charming youth gripped his curved blade. He stood there quietly, like a towering pillar, becoming increasingly sharp. He gradually merged with the void, transforming into a massive crescent moon. The blade had no edge, yet it possessed a keen sharpness, seemingly able to cleave the secret chamber and split the heavens in two. The blade rapidly became incredibly sharp, dividing into countless blade shadows arrayed around it. Blade light swirled around his body, tearing apart countless spaces. Where he stood, it seemed as if space itself would collapse; the entire world appeared unable to contain him.

"What a powerful aura, an aura refined to its extreme, it can be called a domain." The energetic girl's expression slightly changed, and she became serious. As soon as the energetic girl finished speaking, a strange phenomenon emerged behind her: an immortal land, shrouded in primordial qi, yet eerily silent. Amidst the swirling spiritual energy, a lotus bud grew from the immortal land. The golden lotus slowly grew and blossomed, releasing boundless vitality. Its petals gradually became sharper, incredibly keen, like an innate sword lotus.

The energetic girl leaped, merging with the phenomenon, and sat cross-legged on the immortal lotus. She closed her eyes, formed a hand seal, and the immortal lotus immediately burst forth with brilliant light. She suddenly opened her eyes, which seemed like primordial chaos, exuding a misty aura. A divine light shot forth from her eyes, and as her eyes opened, the lotus petals beneath her exploded, like innate swords, shooting forward.

*Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!*

The immortal lotus swords, accompanied by the divine light from her eyes, swiftly shot towards the fiendishly charming youth. As the lotus swords cut through, they sliced space like tofu, utterly sharp. The divine light served as a guide, locking onto the fiendishly charming youth, leaving him nowhere to hide.

At the same time, the curved blade that the fiendishly charming youth had transformed into vanished, tearing through nothingness, as if entering an empty realm, and slashed towards the energetic girl. The fiendishly charming man, having transformed his body into a blade, became the ultimate killing blow.

In the air, the primordial qi violently churned. The curved blade emerged from the void and slashed across the sword lotus. When the primordial qi stabilized and the dust settled, the energetic girl was still the energetic girl, but her clothes were torn, her body bore several blade marks, and blood was gushing out. The entire secret chamber was now silent, save for the *drip-drip* sound of her dripping blood.

*Pfft!*

The energetic girl's face flushed, and she spat out a large mouthful of fresh blood, her eyes filled with disbelief. "My body didn't move, yet the blade light merged with the void, subtly touching upon the Dao of the Void. What a 'Blade of Psychic Connection'! Who exactly are you?" The energetic girl's face was now pale with shock; clearly, she had lost. Clearly, the person before her was not merely a simple Eight Profundities City Lord.

Seeing the girl collapse, the white-haired elder and the others also turned ashen, secretly thinking things had gone terribly wrong.

It was precisely at this moment that Yang Ji, chasing the girl who had used the Earth Evasion Technique, arrived back in the secret chamber. The moment she surfaced, a sword flashed, instantly severing her head. Though she was cute, Yang Ji wasn't swayed.

"Ah, you killed me? You're finished! You've released a demon that shouldn't have been released, you're dead!" The girl's severed head shrieked, then suddenly transformed into a wisp of black smoke and drifted backward. Yang Ji focused his gaze, realizing that the black smoke had actually merged into the body of the unfamiliar fiendishly charming man, who then began to change again.

"Hm? You all are...?" At the same time, Yang Ji also noticed the heavily wounded white-haired elder and the others looking at him bitterly. He had evidently become the hope of the entire village.
