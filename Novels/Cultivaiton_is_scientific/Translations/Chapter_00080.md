# Chapter 80: Questions  

"Patriarch Liu was wrong—this is no mid-level Qi Refining bronze corpse!" Li Shiming assessed the bronze corpse's condition while consulting the "Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual." He could accurately determine the corpse's strength.  

The bronze corpse he had subdued possessed the power of the seventh level of Qi Refinement, far exceeding the mid-level Qi Refinement Patriarch Liu had described.  

Now that the bronze corpse was successfully subdued, Li Shiming faced a new problem: the vast gap between his own strength and the corpse's.  

Initially, he had assumed the bronze corpse was at mid-level Qi Refinement. Given his own third-level Qi Refinement cultivation, subduing it and forming a blood contract wouldn't have posed much trouble.  

But a seventh-level Qi Refining bronze corpse was far too powerful for him.  

He would now face the worst-case scenario described in the "Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual"—suffering backlash from the bronze corpse every night at the hour of Zi, just like during the blood contract formation.  

This was a burden, but not an insurmountable one.  

First, he could have IBMz15 play the "Great Compassion Mantra" every night at Zi hour, occupying his five senses beforehand to weaken the backlash's effects.  

Second, he needed to improve his cultivation level as quickly as possible. Once he reached the fourth level of Qi Refinement, the gap between him and the bronze corpse would narrow, and the backlash would naturally disappear.  

He wanted to continue studying the "Profound Nether Corpse Refining Manual," but he was currently in the Clear Autumn Pavilion. Although there were isolation arrays in place, he couldn't be certain whether releasing the bronze corpse would trigger the pavilion's detection mechanisms.  

He took out the Spirit Gathering Plate and placed it beneath him.  

In moments, a glowing sphere formed above the plate. Inside it, Li Shiming felt as though he were submerged in a pool of spiritual energy.  

In such an environment, even simply breathing would enhance his cultivation, let alone actively practicing.  

Now he understood what Senior Brother Zhu Ji had meant by the "newcomer benefits." With the Spirit Gathering Plate and the dense spiritual energy here, his breakthrough to the fourth level of Qi Refinement would come much sooner.  

He activated the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique." In his perception, countless points of spiritual energy surrounded him.  

Through the acupoints in his body and his breath, he absorbed as much spiritual energy as possible.  

Moreover, due to the overwhelming density of spiritual energy, he had the luxury of choice—he focused solely on absorbing the golden-hued energy points.  

After listening to Senior Brother Zhu Ji's explanation, Li Shiming believed that with his 81-point Metal Spiritual Root, absorbing metal-attributed spiritual energy was the best choice.  

He wasn't sure if this approach was correct, but he reasoned that newcomers selected cultivation techniques based on their spiritual roots precisely to better absorb corresponding elemental energies.  

The "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique" had no specific requirements regarding spiritual energy attributes. Absorbing metal-attributed energy versus absorbing three different attributes seemed to make little difference in cultivation efficiency.  

---  

After completing one cycle of the "Five Elements Qi Absorption Technique," he checked the time—it had taken about two hours.  

His body needed at least twelve hours—a full day—to recover before he could cultivate again.  

This felt like an enormous waste to him. He wished he could spend every possible moment cultivating.  

But he also understood the need for patience. His body was still undergoing spiritual transformation.  

He stood up, stored the Spirit Gathering Plate in his machine room space, and left his room.  

Downstairs, he saw that only one newcomer remained with Senior Brother Zhu Ji, asking questions. He waited nearby.  

"Senior Brother Zhu Ji!" Li Shiming approached and bowed once the other newcomer had finished.  

"Ask away. I'll be leaving in half an hour," Senior Brother Zhu Ji replied with a smile. Assigned to mentor newcomers, he had a patient temperament—even after hours of questions, he remained amiable.  

"Senior Brother, after practicing my primary cultivation technique, I have to wait a full day before I can cultivate again. Is there any way to speed up recovery and reduce this waiting period?" Li Shiming asked without hesitation.  

"It seems you haven't switched your primary cultivation technique. At the third level of Qi Refinement, your body is still in its transformation phase and can't withstand the strain of continuous cultivation.  

"Once you reach the fourth level, the interval between cultivation sessions will shorten to about ten hours. In the later stages of Qi Refinement, it will reduce further to around six hours. By the time you reach Foundation Establishment, you'll be able to cultivate as long as you want—your body will no longer be restricted by the primary technique," Zhu Ji explained with a smile.  

Li Shiming wasn't satisfied with this answer. It offered no actionable solution—more like an acceptance of the natural course.  

"Isn't there an active solution?" he pressed.  

"There is. Strengthen your body by practicing body-refining techniques. A stronger body recovers faster, reducing the interval between cultivation sessions," Zhu Ji replied, still smiling.  

He didn't think this solution was feasible for Li Shiming. Body-refining techniques required significant merit points, and the resources needed for their practice were beyond the means of ordinary cultivators.  

In the sect, only elite disciples who received special attention were granted access to body-refining techniques. The sect would allocate some resources, supplemented by the disciples' backing factions, making such cultivation possible.  

"I have another question, Senior Brother. Among the spoils from the Profound Nether Sect that Elder Cui rewarded me with, there was a black banner. Do you know what it is?" Li Shiming moved on, not wanting to waste this opportunity for free advice.  

Since Elder Cui had given him the banner, there was no need for secrecy.  

"Elder Cui?" Senior Brother Zhu Ji paused momentarily before realizing who he meant. "Ah, you mean Steward Cui. I didn't know you were acquainted with him."  

His smile grew noticeably warmer.  

"The black banner from the Profound Nether Sect is a 'Five Ghost Soul Refining Banner,' one of their signature artifacts. It allows the user to command five malevolent ghosts in battle.  

"While the sect doesn't explicitly forbid these banners, their enhancement methods are considered too sinister. Typically, captured banners are purified first to reduce the ghosts' resentment before use.  

"After purification, the 'Five Ghost Soul Refining Banner' loses much of its combat effectiveness but can still serve as a helper for simple tasks." Zhu Ji provided an unusually detailed explanation this time.  

"I happen to have the purification method for the 'Five Ghost Soul Refining Banner.' It's not a sect-restricted technique, so I can share it freely." He retrieved a manual from his storage pouch and handed it to Li Shiming.  

The sudden enthusiasm from Senior Brother Zhu Ji felt surreal. Fortunately, with no other newcomers around, it didn't affect his composed demeanor.
