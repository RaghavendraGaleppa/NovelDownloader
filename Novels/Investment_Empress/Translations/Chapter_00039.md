# Chapter 39: Big Haul, Three Investment Feedbacks

At Qiushui Pavilion.

Young Master Li hummed a tune, beginning his busy day. The ingredients were exotic beast meats hunted that very day. His good mood made cooking all the more enjoyable. His talent as a chef was, without a doubt, a *billion* times stronger than his talent as a swordsman.

Spicy Winged Serpent with Ginger, Clear Stewed Spined Tortoise, Scallion Stir-fried Black-horned Sheep, Braised Scorched-ring Wolf, plus a plate of green vegetables... Four dishes and one soup, a truly delicious feast.

"It smells so good."

No sooner had the dishes been placed on the table than a figure in palace attire appeared at the doorway. She swiftly moved to the table, reaching out to pick up a piece of mutton and pop it into her mouth.

"Master, aren't you with the elders discussing matters?" Li Mo handed her a pair of chopsticks.

The Qingyuan Sect was currently in a turbulent period. The news of Ying Bing receiving the inheritance had set the entire sect abuzz. If before, everyone saw Ying Bing as a future Sect Master, now they regarded her as a figure akin to the Qingyuan Sect's founding ancestor. If she weren't only sixteen, the elders would have already enshrined her. At this critical juncture, the fiends of the Demon-Summoning Cult had also caused trouble. The Sect Master had immediately summoned all high-ranking officials to Qingyuan Main Peak for a meeting.

"Those old farts just go on and on, repeating themselves. I couldn't be bothered to listen." Shang Wu clicked her tongue, her beautiful brows furrowing in disdain for the old fogeys.

Li Mo: "..."

Well, he couldn't expect his master to offer any constructive opinions.

"The Sect Master did give me a task to do, though." Shang Wu propped her chin on her hand, her chopsticks flying. "I reluctantly agreed."

Li Mo blinked. "Master, you actually listen to the old man's orders?"

"He told me to move to Qiushui Pavilion to make it easier for me to teach you." Shang Wu rested her chin on one hand, giving a light snort. "If little Bing'er wasn't here, I wouldn't have bothered coming."

Li Mo gave a wry smile. He probably understood the Sect Master's intention. It was less about teaching him and more about guarding Ying Bing. His master might be unreliable, but her combat prowess was genuinely formidable; if provoked, she might even pluck a few handfuls of the Sect Master's beard. With such a formidable guardian overseeing things, Qiushui Pavilion's safety factor would soar.

After they finished their meal.

"Little Bing'er, what kind of inheritance did you receive today?" Shang Wu asked, lowering her voice.

Ying Bing set down her chopsticks. Towards this boisterous Elder of Qunyu Peak, she was surprisingly less cold than usual. As she activated her Qi-blood, a layer of radiant light gradually enveloped her. Shang Wu's eyes widened in astonishment. She casually tossed a wine cup towards Ying Bing. The wine cup was gently held by a soft force, fixed within the radiant light, slowly rotating. The wine within the cup was also controlled by Ying Bing, flowing out to form a sphere of water that orbited around her.

"To be able to manifest inner qi externally at the Qi-Blood Realm... no, this is far stronger than mere inner qi." Shang Wu clicked her tongue in wonder.

"Mm, just a minor application," Ying Bing nodded slightly, and the radiant light abruptly pulsed.

*Shatter—*

The wine cup exploded into fragments.

Offensively, the radiant light could expand and contract, invisibly harming foes. Defensively, it could transform strength, deflecting a thousand catties with four ounces of force. Shang Wu clapped her hands, truly impressed by its power.

Li Mo looked forlornly at the scattered porcelain fragments on the floor. "My azure jade porcelain wine cup!"

Suddenly, a thought struck him. "Ice chunk, how much water can you control?"

"Water?" Ying Bing walked to the water缸. With a subtle pull of her radiant light, a torrent of water instantly transformed into a water dragon, swirling and coiling around her with effortless grace.

Li Mo's eyes lit up. He placed his finished rice bowl into the water current enveloped by the radiant light, letting it spin merrily with the flow.

Ying Bing: "?"

Li Mo: "It cleans pretty well."

Young Master Li looked as if he had discovered a new continent. Seeing the wonder and admiration in the youth's eyes, Ying Bing's slightly furrowed brows relaxed. She suddenly found this feeling not unpleasant at all. A small sense of accomplishment even bloomed in her heart...

"Can you add two more bowls?"

"Mm, naturally."

"Wow, that's amazing, amazing!"
