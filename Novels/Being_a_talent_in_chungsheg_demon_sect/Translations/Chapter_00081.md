# Chapter 81: The Advancing Yu Suzhen

After refining the black-robed ghost with the Myriad Spirits Banner, Lu Yang no longer lingered. He immediately conjured a streak of light and sped away, ready to begin his grand ghost-hunting endeavor.

"The most pressing matter is to gather a large number of vengeful spirits and complete this [Netherlord Xuanming's Soul-Seizing Rank]."

"Additionally, the cultivation of the *Heavenly Silkworm Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to See My True Self* must also be put on the agenda. And there's Yu Suzhen; I wonder how her progress is."

"If everything goes smoothly, once I gather Third-Grade True Qi, master the Sage's Theft, forge the Immortal rank of a Corpse-Liberation Immortal, cultivate the *Heavenly Silkworm Secret Art of Severing Thoughts to See My True Self*, obtain the [Netherlord Xuanming's Soul-Seizing Rank], and then drain Yu Suzhen dry using the Art of Stealing Heavenly Secrets, I should have a sixty percent chance of successfully breaking through to Foundation Establishment."

Thinking of this, Lu Yang frowned again.

Sixty percent chance was still not stable enough. If he could also obtain the Ascension Token from True Person Yinshan, then a seventy percent chance would truly be worth a gamble.

"The Ascension Token isn't entirely out of reach."

If he could control the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm and resolve the trouble of the Golden Core Sword Qi, he might be able to trade it for the Ascension Token with True Person Yinshan.

"That being said, I still need to plan carefully."

Lu Yang knew very well that in this life, he was not an insider of the Three Rivers Guild. Rather than trading with him, the Saint Sect's style was to kill him and then seize his assets through brutal means.

"Perhaps I can have Yu Suzhen figure something out..."

With that thought, Lu Yang immediately controlled his avatar to find a desolate spot to hide. Then, he withdrew his consciousness, intending to check on Yu Suzhen's situation.

***

Prime Saint Sect, Sky-Connecting Cloud Sea.

Yu Suzhen had long been refined into a puppet of the Art of Stealing Heavenly Secrets by Lu Yang, with extremely deep karmic ties. Thus, her divination was effortless, and she quickly sensed her target.

Inside an immortal cave of the Three Rivers Guild on Heaven-Mending Peak.

The immortal cave, both inside and out, was already a sea of people, bustling with activity. One after another, cultivators affiliated with the Three Rivers Guild enthusiastically and fawningly surrounded a young man.

"Congratulations, Senior Brother Luo, on cultivating a Grand Divine Ability! Foundation Establishment is within sight!"

"Please do look after us in the future, Senior Brother Luo!"

"Senior Brother Luo, do you remember? I once treated you to a meal back then..."

At the banquet, Luo Wuya maintained a calm facade, but inwardly he was quite satisfied. After all, he was still young, and being able to cultivate a Grand Divine Ability meant he had good prospects for Foundation Establishment in the future.

Thinking of this, a surge of pride welled up in Luo Wuya's heart:

'Big Brother took the first step and achieved the True Person rank. I may not necessarily be inferior to him in the future!'

Just then, a commotion suddenly erupted outside the door. Soon, someone appeared with a look of surprise, saying with a tone of longing, "Fairy Suzhen has arrived too!"

The next second, a graceful figure stepped into the immortal cave.

With alluring and refined features, a slender yet curvaceous figure, combined with her frosty demeanor and a cultivation of Qi Refinement sixth layer, the newcomer appeared as pristine as a proud, icy snow lotus. Yet, it also made one yearn to imagine what passion would burst forth if that aloof facade were stripped away.

"What a beautiful woman..."

Many people looked at Yu Suzhen, revealing expressions of admiration.

"As expected of Fairy Suzhen! It hasn't even been a year since she officially joined, yet her cultivation has advanced by leaps and bounds. She's just one breakthrough away from becoming a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator!"

"Suzhen greets Senior Brother Luo."

Yu Suzhen gracefully walked to Luo Wuya, offering a slight bow. Her movements were appropriate and devoid of any seductive charm; her dignified posture paradoxically stirred a longing in people's hearts.

"Junior Sister Yu, you're so thoughtful."

Luo Wuya smiled contentedly. Yu Suzhen had quite a reputation on Heaven-Mending Peak, yet she generally kept to herself, rarely socialized, and almost never attended banquets. The fact that she was willing to accept his invitation and attend this banquet greatly satisfied his vanity and made him quite fond of this Junior Sister.

"And Senior Brother Zhao, Junior Sister Qinghe."

Turning around, Yu Suzhen bowed again to Zhao Xuhe, who was beside Luo Wuya, her gaze briefly sweeping over Fairy Qinghe, who had accompanied him.

"And Senior Brother Lu too. Many thanks to both Senior Brothers for your care."

Immediately after, she looked towards Lu Yuanchun, who was also beside Zhao Xuhe and a core disciple of Heaven-Mending Peak. Their eyes met briefly, but she quickly looked away as if nothing had happened.

Soon, the banquet began.

Before long, Luo Wuya and Yu Suzhen were surrounded by people, some seeking profit, others craving beauty, quickly heating up the atmosphere.

Such a scene naturally caught Luo Wuya's attention.

He himself was at the center of the crowd, adept at dealing with fawning individuals. Naturally, he was curious how Yu Suzhen would handle it.

As he looked at Yu Suzhen, he saw that while she remained aloof, she was not so arrogant as to evoke disgust. Instead, her movements were appropriate, and she handled herself with impeccable grace. She responded to everyone, her words seemingly close and familiar, yet the next second she would be happily conversing with someone else.

In short, it was a subtle push-and-pull.

However, no one present noticed this dynamic. Even if they had, they would have likely thought, 'She's playing hard to get with me; she must be interested in me...'

Poor junior brothers, being played in the palm of this woman's hand.

Luo Wuya shook his head, but an unusual feeling welled up in his heart. From beginning to end, Yu Suzhen had not actively tried to get close to him.

She truly seemed to be that kind of aloof, proud woman solely devoted to cultivation.

'An interesting woman.'

The banquet didn't disperse until sunset. Yu Suzhen came before Luo Wuya, still dignified and graceful, and bowed slightly:

"It's getting late, and Suzhen still needs to cultivate, so I'll take my leave."

Luo Wuya chuckled softly, "You've worked hard, Junior Sister. After all, you usually focus solely on cultivation. Dealing with all these people must have been quite a bother for you."

"...You know that much, Senior Brother."

Upon hearing this, Yu Suzhen raised her head, her previously frosty expression suddenly softening. She gave Luo Wuya an exasperated glance, half-complaining.

Such a tone, such an expression, was completely contrary to the dignified pride everyone had seen at the banquet. It was as if ice and snow had melted, revealing a fleeting charm that stirred Luo Wuya's heart, even exciting him, as if he had glimpsed another side of the aloof fairy.

However, Luo Wuya quickly regained his composure.

He let out a hearty laugh. "Then that's my fault, Junior Sister. Very well. If you have any questions about your cultivation in the future, you can come ask me at any time."

"Then I thank Senior Brother."

Only then did Yu Suzhen show a hint of surprise and delight. She then nodded solemnly before turning to leave under the admiring gazes of the crowd.

***

Seeing this scene, Zhao Xuhe, not far away, suddenly had a gleam in his eyes.

Soon, he also brought Fairy Qinghe over to bid Luo Wuya farewell. Luo Wuya outwardly agreed, but inwardly, his mind stirred, giving rise to a hint of suspicion.

The next second, he split off a wisp of spiritual sense, which quietly followed Zhao Xuhe as he left.

After leaving the immortal cave, Zhao Xuhe first politely sent away Fairy Qinghe, who had still intended to discuss the Dao with him, and then found a secluded spot to hide.

He then took out an Invisibility Talisman to conceal his form and made his way to Yu Suzhen's immortal cave. After matching the secret signal on the door, he quietly snuck inside. Upon entering, he immediately saw the graceful figure seated at the dressing table. Her jade-like, smooth back was mesmerizing...

Zhao Xuhe's heart instantly blazed with desire.

"Suzhen..."

"Mmm~"

Yu Suzhen arched her slender neck, letting out a sigh that was either helpless or resigned, yet she allowed Zhao Xuhe to do as he pleased with her.

The two instantly ignited the quiet room of the immortal cave.

Zhao Xuhe, recalling Yu Suzhen's aloof demeanor at the banquet and her passion now before him, felt an inexhaustible surge of strength.

A long time passed before the two gradually ceased.

On the bed, Yu Suzhen entwined herself with Zhao Xuhe and whispered, "Xuhe... I don't want to wait anymore. Can our relationship truly never be made public?"

"Suzhen, I have my own difficulties."

Zhao Xuhe shook his head, but said no more, casually fobbing her off with a few words. The truth was simple: the Heaven-Mending Peak Master had arranged a marriage for him with the Peak Master's daughter. Under such circumstances, how could he openly have a Dao companion? So, it could only be an underground affair.

Thinking of this, Zhao Xuhe even felt a hint of guilt.

After all, Yu Suzhen was so naive, yet he was deceiving her like this...

The two then lingered intimately for a long time before Zhao Xuhe reluctantly departed, leaving behind some cultivation pills for Yu Suzhen before he left.

After watching Zhao Xuhe leave, Yu Suzhen gradually hid the charm on her face. She then concealed the pills and immediately took out a jade slip.

After she input a line of message into the jade slip, a moment passed.

"Thump, thump-thump, thump..."

The agreed-upon signal knock came from outside the door. Yu Suzhen immediately went to open it. A moment later, a figure darted in and directly lifted her by the waist.

"No! Senior Brother Lu, I'm not that kind of person..."

"What do you mean 'no,' you hypocritical slut? I knew you still harbored feelings for Zhao Xuhe. Don't forget, I still have leverage over you..."

"Wuwuwu..."

Another two hours passed.

Lu Yuanchun left satisfied. Yu Suzhen lay on the bed, silently shedding tears. But the next second, soft footsteps suddenly sounded from behind her.

Yu Suzhen turned back in astonishment, looking at the figure that had suddenly appeared behind her. A look of smug satisfaction at her successful plan flashed in her beautiful eyes, yet on her face, she cried out in surprise:

"Senior Brother Luo!?"

Lu Yang retracted his spiritual sense and fell into a deep silence. After a long while, he sighed with emotion:

"What a master of her craft."

Even he had never imagined that in just a few months, Yu Suzhen would achieve such tremendous success in her grand scheme of manipulation.

He couldn't comprehend it, but he was profoundly shaken.
