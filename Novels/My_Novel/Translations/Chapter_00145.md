# Chapter 145: First Meeting with Aoshan, The Divine Use of Treasure

This devastating battle was over in a flash. Zhou Long, Iron Bear, Mei Ren Du, and Hu Shengnan all screamed in agony, their faces ashen.

They had thought themselves clever, setting up an ingenious scheme.

But they underestimated their opponent and ended up in this state, which was entirely their own fault.

Li Xian said, "Senior brothers, how was that? Was my plan to everyone's satisfaction?"

Iron Bear was now blind. Usually mighty and domineering, he had bullied the locals for years. But he was a coward at heart. After just one exchange, he saw Li Xian's extraordinary power and martial prowess, which far surpassed his own. Fear gripped him, and he was the first to submit. "It's satisfactory, very satisfactory! Magistrate Li, whatever you say goes!"

What could the others do, even if they were unconvinced? They had no choice but to soften their words and change their attitude.

"Magistrate Li, we were blind and failed to recognize a great master. If you want this treasure, just take it."

"Yes, actually, you didn't need to go to all this trouble. We obtained this treasure with the intention of gifting it to you."

"Sigh, what a misunderstanding. It's our fault for not making ourselves clear. We martial artists are blunt, please don't hold it against us, Magistrate Li."

This was a scheme that could advance or retreat.

If Li Xian were weak, they would press the attack. At best, they would force him to retreat; at worst, they would take his life. If Li Xian were strong, they would retreat, speaking only of the treasure and not of their intentions to target him.

Li Xian smiled. "Since that's the case, why wait for another day? Since everyone is here, please take a seat."

"Take a seat?" The crowd was confused.

Li Xian said, "As the newly appointed Magistrate, I should be in regular contact with you all to exercise my duties. I had planned to host a banquet to invite you all to discuss matters together."

"It's a coincidence that you're all here today, so we can skip the banquet. But there are some rules we must discuss."

"Mag... Magistrate Li, please... please draw your blade, I am willing to obey your commands." Hu Shengnan's face was as pale as paper.

She had been run through the arm by the black blade and pinned to the wall. The pain was unbearable. She had tried to pull it out several times, only to be shocked by the immense force behind it. It wasn't just stuck in the wall; it felt as if it were locked into it.

This single move was something she could not hope to achieve. In the path of martial arts, strength is determined after just one fight.

Li Xian smiled. The blade he had thrown earlier combined the throwing force of the [Cloud-Treading Hand] with the Qi circulation technique of the [Jade-Green Palm]. His Qi, like tangled threads, had locked it into the wall.

Li Xian pulled the blade out.

Hu Shengnan sealed her blood flow, glanced at Li Xian in terror, and obediently carried a wooden stool to sit in the middle of the hall.

Iron Bear, Zhou Long, Mei Ren Du, and the others, who dominated Qingning, did not dare to resist and sat in a row obediently. They were all injured, but Li Xian had shown restraint, not threatening their lives.

"Master Miao, you too." Li Xian said calmly.

Miao Xichun had witnessed the entire ordeal. He swallowed hard. This was his own territory, yet he felt like an outsider.

He sat down honestly.

Li Xian got straight to the point, his presence even more imposing. His heroic aura was dazzling as he spoke. "As the Magistrate, I must establish rules."

"I don't care how things were in the past. I only care about the present and the future."

"From now on, if any sects have a conflict, they must report it to me in advance. You must not harm ordinary people. If you do... I will personally pay you a visit."

"Furthermore, from now on, all factions and sects must restrain their disciples and members. Disputes between factions leading to injury or death are common, but if you disrupt the lives of ordinary citizens, I will punish you severely."

"As for protection fees and apprentice fees... you may collect them, but they must be regulated. No arbitrary or excessive charges!"

Li Xian laid down the law one by one. He was a native of Qingning, had grown up here, and had experienced the hardships of the common people firsthand. The rules he established now came from the bottom up, not empty talk.

These rules harmed the interests of the various factions and sects, and they were naturally unwilling. But under such overwhelming pressure, they dared not disobey.

With the establishment of numerous rules, Qingning County was now under his control.

Li Xian said, "In addition, the Magistrate's Office manages many factions, and the人力 and material resources required are considerable. Every martial arts hall and faction in Qingning County must pay fifty taels per month as an operating fee."

The major factions had been tyrannical for a long time, always extorting money from others. Today, they had finally met their match, and they had no words to express their suffering.

"Excellent!"

"Brother Li is absolutely right!"

Suddenly, a shout was heard. Lin Guolong jumped over the threshold, then turned back. "Be careful, Grandma, watch the step." He helped Lin Aoshan through the door.

Lin Aoshan said, "I can walk myself." She glared at him, refusing his support.

Lin Guolong puffed out his chest and walked toward Li Xian. "Brother Li, what you said is spot on. Every word was for the people, it truly moved me. I, Lin Guolong, support you, and so does the county guard!"

"If you need anything, just let me know. We county guards are not to be trifled with!"

The masters of the various factions and halls couldn't help but change color. Strong as Li Xian was, he was still just one man, and a man's strength is finite. But with the support of the county guard, his power was now established!

Li Xian smiled. "Brother Lin, what brings you here?"

Lin Guolong said, "How could I not come for such a major event? How are things? Do you need my help?"

"No need. Everyone has been very amiable. We've had a very pleasant conversation." Li Xian smiled meaningfully, then turned to Lin Aoshan and asked, "And this is..."

Lin Guolong introduced her. "This is my grandmother, Lin Aoshan, the illustrious Marquis of Xuan from the Heaven-Surveillance Division!"

"Greetings, Senior Lin." Li Xian cupped his fist and smiled. "How strange. Please forgive my poor eyesight, but no matter how I look, I don't see you as Brother Lin's grandmother. You look more like a young heroine in the bloom of youth."

Lin Aoshan glared at Lin Guolong, then turned back. "Your flattery is ill-timed. You've flattered the wrong horse's leg. Though I am his grandmother, I am only twenty this year."

Li Xian exclaimed in surprise, "So you're not Grandmother Lin, but Sister Lin! My mistake, my mistake."

Lin Aoshan's face held a smile. She had found Li Xian's actions interesting from the start. This man was certainly not a rigid stickler for rules, yet he didn't lack for ruthless methods or a domineering style. It was quite unexpected to find such a figure in a small county like Qingning.

"So you're calling me Sister now?" Lin Aoshan said with a charming laugh.

Lin Guolong interjected, "No, no! Brother Li, you and I are brothers. You should call her Grandma!"

"呸呸呸," Lin Aoshan said. "You little sprout, calling me Grandma doesn't bother me. But for this tall and handsome young man Li to call me Grandma, I wouldn't like it."

"Just call me Sister. I'm older than you."

"No, that won't do." Lin Guolong made a bitter face. "That would be all mixed up."

Li Xian laughed. "In that case, let's each follow our own relations. Sister Lin, Brother Lin, please come inside and talk."

Spring Leaf Martial Hall.

In the courtyard pavilion.

Lin Aoshan smiled. "I arrived in Qingning several days ago and have been curious about you, Young Master Li, but I only got to meet you today."

"I wonder if you are disappointed, Sister Lin?" Li Xian, though calling her "Sister" to intentionally draw closer, felt no ill will upon their first meeting. However, he had no intention of currying favor; it was just a normal form of address.

Lin Aoshan did not find it unpleasant. She smiled. "Not at all. You are more... than I imagined."

"...Unconventional."

Her gaze was a little strange.

At first, when Li Xian forcefully took the treasure, she thought he was just another domineering and unreasonable youth. She had seen many such people, so it was nothing new.

Later, when Li Xian established his rules, every word and phrase was a surprise to her, even an eye-opener.

That was why she couldn't wait to speak with Li Xian and truly meet him.

"Unconventional?" Li Xian said, surprised. "But those who know me well all say I'm honest."

Lin Aoshan couldn't help but laugh, as beautiful as a flower in bloom. *You, honest? That's a good one,* she thought. *Who was it that just ran circles around those people?* She said seriously, "I'm not going to argue with you about this. Honesty isn't about what you say, but what you do."

"Sister, if you sought me out, is there something you need?" Li Xian asked.

Lin Aoshan said, "It's my little grandson. He was afraid he couldn't handle the situation, so he begged me to come. It wasn't specifically to see you."

Lin Guolong wanted to speak but hesitated, not daring to argue.

Li Xian said, "I see." Seeing that Lin Aoshan's teacup was empty, he refilled it halfway.

Lin Aoshan raised an eyebrow. "Speaking of which, you and my Lin family are actually quite fated."

"Your younger brother is in the provincial capital now. His master, Fu Haoran, has quite a connection with the Lin family."

Li Xian thought, his brother might have some connection with the Lin family, but the ties probably weren't that deep. The Lin family was powerful, but he didn't need to rush to rely on them.

So he changed the topic without showing any emotion. Lin Aoshan didn't mind. They chatted idly for a long time, about lake views and poetry. Li Xian's conversation was elegant, and to his surprise, Lin Aoshan found him very agreeable.

Unknowingly, it was already evening.

This first meeting went quite smoothly.

They parted ways at the end of the street at dusk.

Li Xian brushed the dust from his clothes. He had wasted a whole day on these trivial matters. He returned to the Magistrate's Office to practice his martial arts diligently.

"Magistrate Li, you were so impressive today!"

Zhang Hou was full of admiration.

As soon as he returned to the Magistrate's Office, he had spread the story everywhere. How Li Xian had subdued the three halls and dominated the two factions, all with seeming ease, as if he still had strength to spare.

"If you practice diligently, you can achieve this day as well." Li Xian encouraged him.

He entered the inner courtyard to practice.

He went through the Breeze Leg, Four Directions Fist, Jade-Green Palm, and Great Luo Blade, then practiced the Cloud-Treading Hand and the Waning Sun, Fading Blood Sword.

His proficiency increased steadily.

His Qi Lake had reached fourteen zhang.

"My martial arts are still too few, mostly basic ones. During the fight today, Iron Bear's Bear Hardening Body Art truly surprised me."

"If I get the chance, I should learn new martial arts to expand my strength. Though I have the superior martial art, the Waning Sun, Fading Blood Sword, due to its sword techniques, I'm not sure if it's mid-tier or not when used alone."

"It's a pity... it's not easy to enter the Madam's Leisurely Martial Pavilion. There's a price for the Madam's things. I have some strength and money in the county now. Soon those factions will be sending money..."

"Perhaps I can acquire a martial arts manual with my own abilities. I don't need to ask for favors!"

Li Xian clenched his fist.

A light shone in his eyes. Martial artists may need to leverage external forces, but strength and wealth... must truly belong to oneself to go far.

The sky gradually darkened.

Li Xian sent Wang Wu to buy some crispy chicken and duck, and to the wine alley for some fine wine. The six of them drank and ate meat together, having a great time.

They ate and drank their fill, winning people over, and had a delightful conversation.

After the evening meal.

Li Xian returned to his bedroom.

The Magistrate's Office covered several acres and had many rooms. Some had been dilapidated for years and were uninhabitable. Lacking the funds to repair them, Li Xian had left them as they were.

The west wing was in better condition and served as Li Xian's bedroom.

Li Xian closed the doors and windows, then took out the [Strange Treasure] from his chest. A blue-green glow filled the room.

He wanted to see what kind of rare treasure it was.
