# Chapter 170: Battle

The four mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators were quite sensible—as were most cultivators when faced with opponents of clearly superior strength. While there were indeed those who could fight above their level, such individuals would never be found among rogue cultivators. 

What could they rely on? Their barely passable magical artifacts? Or talismans whose power couldn’t even match their own spells?

"Thank you for saving our lives, fellow Daoist!" The eldest of the Guan brothers bowed deeply to Li Shiming.

Li Shiming remained silent, simply staring at him.

"This is the Netherworld Token—please accept it!" The Guan elder quickly feigned realization and retrieved a wooden plaque from his storage bag, handing it over.

Though Li Shiming had never seen a Netherworld Token before, his spiritual sense swept over the plaque and immediately detected something amiss. 

Since the Netherworld Token was issued by the Netherworld Sect and served as a credential, it naturally wouldn’t be an ordinary item. The plaque the Guan elder produced was carved from spirit wood and bore the words "Netherworld Token," but its craftsmanship and the spells imbued within were clearly the work of a low-grade artifact craftsman.

Li Shiming was no rogue cultivator—he was a sect disciple himself. If this token were genuine, how would the Netherworld Sect verify its authenticity? 

Even without considering other craftsmen, Li Shiming himself could produce countless identical, indistinguishable fakes as long as he had the raw materials.

"Why make things difficult? Handing it over properly would have been fine. Since you chose to deceive me, your lives are now forfeit," Li Shiming said calmly.

A flash of sword light swept past, and the Guan elder's head flew into the air. Almost simultaneously, the head of the second Guan brother—who hadn’t even had time to react—followed suit. 

Only the third Guan brother remained, his scream dying in his throat as he found himself paralyzed.

Li Shiming’s spiritual sense swept over them, collecting their storage bags. He then grabbed the third brother and smiled faintly in the direction of the Zhao caravan leader—a silent warning. A seasoned man like Zhao would know better than to spread rumors.

Sword light carried Li Shiming and his captive far away until he found a cave. A sweep of his spiritual sense cleared the cave of debris and foul air before he entered, tossing the third Guan brother to the ground.

He retrieved the three storage bags and emptied their contents. From within a low-grade shield, he pried out a wooden plaque.

Truth be told, the Guan brothers' hiding methods were decent—just not against someone with spiritual sense. Under such scrutiny, their tricks were laughable.

---

Li Shiming picked up the wooden plaque and nodded in satisfaction after scanning it with his spiritual sense. 

This plaque employed an extremely unique spell-imbuing technique, and its surface bore a special mark with an intricate flow of spiritual energy—likely the work of a secret method. 

This had to be the real Netherworld Token. 

Whether it was or not, the third Guan brother would confirm it. 

He had spared the man for this very purpose—and to gather information about the local cultivation world. 

The Guan brothers had disrupted his original plans. He had intended to travel to Guanquan Mountain in disguise to investigate whether cultivators resided there. 

Instead, the three brothers had delivered themselves to him and even provoked him, giving him a reason to act. 

By Li Shiming’s principles, he wouldn’t act like a demonic cultivator, attacking unrelated people without cause.

A rope flew from Li Shiming’s hand, binding the third Guan brother tightly. 

This was the Spirit-Binding Rope he had taken from Baili Jinyan. Back in Tianhai Island, he hadn’t dared to use it. 

Now, as a ninth-level Qi Refining cultivator nearing Foundation Establishment, the rope and its companion artifact—the Soul-Piercing Needle—would have remained unused if not for the Guan brothers. 

After Foundation Establishment, artifacts would become nearly obsolete. 

For example, the two top-grade artifacts in Baili Jinyan’s storage bracelet—once formidable to Li Shiming—were now worthless compared to the supreme-grade artifacts he could wield. They had become mere mementos.

"What are you doing? I won’t tell you anything!" the third Guan brother shrieked in terror. 

He knew all too well what awaited him at the hands of another cultivator—torture was inevitable. He could only hope Li Shiming’s methods would be mild. 

But when he saw the professional Spirit-Binding Rope and the needle-shaped artifact, his composure shattered. 

After a single use of the Soul-Piercing Needle, the third Guan brother spilled everything—whether he should have or not.

Li Shiming finally understood what the Netherworld Token was: a tool the Netherworld Sect used to sow chaos among minor factions. 

As a demonic sect, the Netherworld Sect’s methods were unpredictable. By releasing a batch of these tokens, they incited conflicts among factions in the Hundred Thousand Mountains. 

Though these factions paled in comparison to the Netherworld Sect, their sheer numbers and ambiguous ties to other major sects made them a nuisance. 

The tokens fueled endless infighting, as every faction sought to send one of their own into the sect, thereby securing a connection. 

This accelerated the Netherworld Sect’s plans to dominate the Hundred Thousand Mountains. 

At the same time, the tokens served to recruit talented individuals. Those who survived the journey to present a token were undoubtedly resourceful—exactly the kind of people the sect valued.

Li Shiming also learned the standard methods for entering and exiting markets in Northern Shu, as well as the locations of some. 

By the time he asked these questions, even the dull-witted third Guan brother realized Li Shiming wasn’t from Northern Shu. 

No local cultivator—especially one at the ninth level of Qi Refining—would be ignorant of such basics. 

But Li Shiming didn’t care what the man guessed. The third Guan brother’s fate was already sealed. 

After disposing of him, Li Shiming stored the three storage bags in his machine room space as inventory. 

From the Guan brothers’ belongings, he selected a low-grade robe, a low-grade sword, and several hundred spirit stones. The rest—useless junk—was buried in the cave. 

Perhaps someday, a lucky youth would unearth these treasures. Though worthless to Li Shiming, they might still be valuable to early-stage Qi Refining cultivators.

He rested in the cave, contemplating a new plan of action. 

Now that he had a basic understanding of Northern Shu’s cultivation world, he knew one word described it best: chaos. 

The Netherworld Tokens were just a small part of it. The main cause was the Netherworld Sect’s relentless encroachment on other sects’ interests, inciting minor factions to fight over resources. 

The sect, vast and powerful, disdained minor resources—but to smaller factions, they were invaluable. 

Ambitious groups sought expansion, while others simply killed and plundered, worsening the turmoil. 

The Netherworld Sect’s management style differed from conventional sects, and its focus on expansion left it no time to govern the Hundred Thousand Mountains, allowing the chaos to fester.

---

Li Shiming shook his head helplessly. Entering the Hundred Thousand Mountains now was ill-advised. Even as a rogue cultivator, he risked being mistaken for a spy and killed on sight. 

As he pondered, his gaze sharpened as he looked outside the cave. 

Five auras were rapidly approaching—one belonging to a Foundation Establishment cultivator, the other four to the mid-stage Qi Refining cultivators he had spared earlier. 

"It seems I’ll need your help again," Li Shiming said to his clone, his fighting spirit rising. 

"Today, we slay a Foundation Establishment cultivator together!" the clone replied eagerly. 

Since creating the clone, Li Shiming had maintained a state of dual consciousness. Even when the clone was in the machine room space, it conducted research. 

This method transformed the otherwise useless martial arts technique "Dual Wielding" into genuine multitasking. 

Of course, the technique was merely a key—his powerful mind and spiritual sense enabled true parallel consciousness. 

The longer this state persisted, the more both consciousnesses strengthened within their respective bodies. 

Li Shiming and his clone stepped out of the cave just as the Foundation Establishment cultivator and his four subordinates arrived. 

"Uncle, that’s the one who stole the Netherworld Token!" one of the Qi Refining cultivators pointed at Li Shiming. 

The Foundation Establishment cultivator’s spiritual sense swept over them, confirming their strength—two ninth-level Qi Refining cultivators, insignificant in his eyes. 

The gap between Qi Refining and Foundation Establishment was vast. Only a handful of geniuses from major sects could bridge it. 

"Hand over the Netherworld Token and your storage bags, then kill yourselves," the Foundation Establishment cultivator commanded indifferently. 

"The token is right here. Come and take it if you dare," Li Shiming replied with a smile. 

He summoned the Shu Mountain Seal. Now at the ninth level of Qi Refining, he could finally wield it, having been channeling spiritual energy into it all along. 

His target, however, wasn’t the Foundation Establishment cultivator. At his current level, the seal’s binding power couldn’t restrain a Foundation Establishment cultivator—even an early-stage one, the weakest of the rank. 

"Supreme-grade artifact!" The Foundation Establishment cultivator’s eyes lit up with greed. 

Even he only possessed one supreme-grade artifact, the rest being top-grade. 

But he quickly realized his mistake—these two Qi Refining cultivators dared to resist. 

He unleashed the spiritual pressure of Foundation Establishment, intending to crush them. 

This was a common and effective tactic against Qi Refining cultivators. Without spiritual sense, they had no defense against it, often being paralyzed or even incapacitated. 

But this time, his opponent was different. Both Li Shiming and his clone possessed spiritual sense—even trained in spiritual attacks. 

Their spiritual strength surpassed his, rendering his pressure useless. 

The clone lunged forward. Previously standing behind Li Shiming, its flawless appearance now fully visible, it stunned the Foundation Establishment cultivator. 

Even after a century of life, he had never seen such perfection—a face without flaw, as if all beauty in the world had converged upon it. 

His momentary distraction allowed the clone to close the distance, thrusting the top-grade Golden Strike Sword like a melee weapon. 

This sword, originally refined by Baili Jinyan, had gone unused in Tianhai Island to avoid detection. 

Though a top-grade artifact, its true value lay in its compatibility with Baili Jinyan’s cultivation. 

Meanwhile, Li Shiming activated the Shu Mountain Seal, trapping all four Qi Refining cultivators. 

Under its weight, they couldn’t even twitch—let alone escape. 

A single strike reduced them to pulp. 

"You dare?!" the Foundation Establishment cultivator roared in fury. 

But his rage was impotent. Once the clone closed in, his advantages as a Foundation Establishment cultivator dwindled. 

The clone practiced the "Sword Demon Codex," its close-combat prowess overwhelming any non-body-refining cultivator. 

Though the Foundation Establishment cultivator’s body had been tempered during his breakthrough, it couldn’t compare to the clone’s—especially after absorbing a drop of Golden Core essence blood, elevating its power beyond the Qi Refining stage. 

Trapped in melee, the Foundation Establishment cultivator could only unleash spiritual attacks, desperate to break free. But the clone was faster, circling him relentlessly, the Golden Strike Sword flashing.
