# Chapter 336: This Thirty-Year-Old?!

The true art required the practitioner to circulate true qi through the Eight Extraordinary Meridians, following the Twelve Regular Meridians and the three hundred and sixty-five acupoints to establish a complete Heavenly Circuit.

However, after his body had been remolded by this world's martial arts, his meridians had long since transformed into an integral whole of "jade marrow and golden bones." The so-called meridian nodes of traditional martial arts left no corresponding traces within him.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered, and his figure shot out of the pavilion like a ghost.

In less than a moment, he returned carrying two unconscious ruffians. In this dragon-and-snake-mixed city of Yujing City, there were naturally no shortage of petty thieves taking advantage of chaos to plunder. With the spiritual perception of a Nine-Realm Supreme Grandmaster, catching such trash was as easy as turning his hand.

His fingertip pressed against the ruffian's wrist pulse, and a thread of Ten Extremes True Qi drilled into the other's body like a fine strand.

As his true qi circulated to investigate, Xu Yunfan's brow furrowed deeper and deeper.

In this mortal body, the Ren and Du meridians were indistinct and unmanifest, and the Twelve Regular Meridians were intermittent and broken, vastly different from the "meridian network like a sky full of stars" described in the *Sutra of Annihilation and Dust*.

The Sutra stated that everyone should possess a complete meridian network.

He reached out to probe another person.

There was none.

Unwilling to accept this, Xu Yunfan shot out again and brought back several more people.

His fingertip true qi, like a silk thread, probed into the seventh ruffian's meridians one after another.

According to the *Sutra of Annihilation and Dust*, a mortal's Twelve Regular Meridians should be like rushing rivers, and the Eight Extraordinary Meridians like intersecting hidden canals.

Yet, within this body before him, aside from the pulse that indicated a mortal's physical state, there was no meridian system for practicing the path of the extraordinary.

Xu Yunfan tested them one by one, and the results were all the same.

There was none, still none.

There was none of the meridian phenomena described in the Sutra of Annihilation and Dust.

No wonder his master, Bi Yuan, called them demons. Such a cultivation system was indeed different in their eyes.

But in his previous life, this was the orthodox path of cultivation!

The path of immortality was like this, and the path of martial arts was also like this.

The martial arts of this world practiced the path of blood and qi; it seemed that because there were no Eight Extraordinary Meridians within the human body, they turned to cultivating muscles, skin, and membranes instead...

Xu Yunfan slowly sat down, his expression dark and uncertain. He glanced at the jade slip that had already cracked into several pieces in his palm and fell silent.

He would have to wait until he returned to ask for the result.

The next morning, at the central plaza of Yujing City.

The morning mist had yet to disperse, but the四周 of the Xuanwu Arena were already surrounded by martial artists.

The major event from yesterday naturally drew these reckless people who feared not death to watch the excitement.

This arena, cast from a single block of profound iron, stood nine zhang high, its surface carved with dragon-suppressing patterns. Four corners were adorned with bronze-cast Xuanwu statues, and the eyes of the intertwined turtle and snake glinted with a cold light in the morning sun.

Xu Yunfan arrived to the tolling of the morning bell.

He wore a plain cyan robe, the *Mountain-Shaking Sea-Calming Hammer* hung at his waist, the *Red Fire Swallowing Dragon Cudgel* was strapped to his back, and the *Sky-Piercing Cloud-Breaking Bow* was slung diagonally. The dragon head carvings on the bow tips were faintly visible in the mist.

The moment his foot landed on the ground, a series of "cracking" sounds came from the viewing platform. The objects in the hands of seven officials in purple robes from the Celestial Oversight Department were shattered by his extremely thick aura; the copper needles of their aura-detecting devices twisted into spirals.

"So strong!"

Guo Lang on the edge of the viewing platform was greatly shocked, a shadow of worry unconsciously falling over his heart.

This person was not a simple Nine-Realm expert.

"Xu! Yun! Fan!"

A gritted teeth growl came from the western viewing pavilion.

Minister of War Zheng You dug his nails into the sandalwood armrest, the great Zhou generals beside him turning pale with anger.

Behind them stood three hundred elite soldiers of the Imperial City Division clad in black armor, but these fierce warriors who once made the martial world tremble with fear did not dare to grip their sword handles firmly at this moment.

Last night, the Empress had personally issued an oral decree: "When this person mounts the stage, no matter the grudges and grievances, you must abide by the rules. This is a scheme to slay a dragon, not something that can be resolved with blades."

On the eastern side of the arena, a commotion suddenly broke out among the disciples of the five sects other than the Dao Sect.

"That's... the 'Bone-Eroding Incense' of the Maitreya Temple?"

A disciple suddenly covered his mouth and nose. Three zhang away, several gray-robed monks were burning incense and chanting scriptures, the smoke from the censer rising and condensing, drifting towards the distance.

"Those bald donkeys, their schemes are truly vicious."

A true disciple of the Xuanzhen Gate squinted his eyes.

Last night, the abbot of the Maitreya Temple entered the palace to meet with the great Zhou Empress, clearly reaching some sort of agreement.

Further away, Su Wanqing of the Tian Shu Gate stood silently with twelve sword maids. The wooden box at her waist seeped frost, and the qi she unconsciously emitted combined with the frosty sword qi, spreading spiderweb-like cracks across the green stone slabs.

"Silence!"

With the hoarse voice of the assessor, a one-zhang-high Kui ox drum was beaten. The drum skin was made from the belly skin of a northern sea flood dragon; every beat made one's internal organs tremble.

The old steward in a vermilion official robe unrolled the scroll, but his voice reading the rules suddenly caught in his throat, as if he had seen an incredible name.

The old steward's Adam's apple bobbed, and he finally shouted, "First Arena contender, Xu Yunfan, and... Lü Hou!"

The entire arena fell silent, everyone guessing who this Lü Hou could be.

"Lü Hou?"

"Among the top three of the seventy-two states' martial arts competition, I've never heard of such a person!"

A rustling sound immediately arose from the viewing platform.

The roster of the top three martial artists from the seventy-two states had long been thoroughly scrutinized by every sect, but this name had never appeared.

When the person was clearly visible, even Xu Yunfan's pupils contracted sharply.

Walking out from the shadows of the arena was a hunched, white-haired old eunuch.

That indigo-blue python robe, washed until it was pale, swayed slightly. Lü Hou hunched his body and took two steps forward, his left hand, thin as a chicken's claw, pinching a silk handkerchief embroidered with a flower of the underworld, occasionally covering his mouth to cough.

"This one, Lü Hou, greets Master Xu."

His hoarse voice was like a blunt knife scraping rotten wood. As he bowed, the purplish-black corpse stain on the back of his neck cast a诡异 glow under the sunlight.

When he raised his head, the face full of senile freckles squeezed out a sinister smile, but there was not a trace of mirth in his turbid eyes.

"Sixty years ago..."

He coughed again, a rattling sound coming from his throat, "This one delivered the late Emperor's 'Iron Certificate of Feud' to the Dao Sect..."

His emaciated fingers stroked the gilded token at his waist, "Today... *cough cough*... let's use a different method to interact."

Is this right?

Xu Yunfan turned his head to look at the spectator's stand, pointing at Lü Hou and saying, "This is under thirty years old?"

The old steward expressionlessly unrolled the roster, his voice flat and toneless. "Lü Hou, age thirty, registered in Yujing Circuit."

"*Kekeke*..." Lü Hou suddenly let out a string of strange laughs like a night owl, his orchid fingers held high. "This one is indeed... thirty years old..."

As he spoke, he shook a stack of yellowed registration documents from his sleeve; the top one was stamped with a vermilion seal of the Tian Shun thirty-fifth year, exactly thirty years ago to this day.

Xu Yunfan sneered repeatedly upon hearing this. The great Zhou imperial court was truly shameless, dragging even someone who should be in a coffin out and changing their household registration to thirty years old to enter the competition.

This old eunuch was undoubtedly of the Ninth Realm. Having lost his manhood, he had spent his entire life in cultivation. The great Zhou imperial court was filled with hidden dragons and crouching tigers; the saying refers to these old eunuchs who have lost their "handle."

"Please."

Xu Yunfan said calmly.

The old eunuch suddenly exploded into motion!
