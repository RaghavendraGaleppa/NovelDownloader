# Chapter 26: Mastering Object Control and Cultivating Various Spells

When Qi Chuan left the Exchange Pavilion, he carried not only a manual of Qi Refining spells but also a bottle containing three Spirit Tempering Pills.

The cost? A mere twenty-five low-grade spirit stones.

...Well, though he suddenly felt rich with a hundred low-grade spirit stones, they disappeared quickly—a quarter gone in an instant.

Unlike the Evergreen Technique bestowed by his family years ago, this spell manual didn't need to be returned. He could keep it for himself and practice the spells whenever he wished.

Returning to his private mountain peak, Qi Chuan wasted no time in attempting to learn the Object Control Technique. Compared to other spells, mastering this technique and wielding the high-grade artifact "Flying Ash" would maximize his current combat potential.

Sitting cross-legged on his bed with the manual open before him, Qi Chuan studied the page detailing the Object Control Technique.

"According to this, the Object Control Technique is more challenging than other common Qi Refining spells?" he mused. "But unlike other spells, once I grasp the basics, I can control artifacts."

"Higher levels of Object Control don't significantly enhance combat power, unlike spells like Fireball, where each level brings a massive leap in power."

After a quick scan, Qi Chuan absorbed the key points about the technique. He then focused intently on studying it.

Soon, he finished his first thorough reading. Closing his eyes, he contemplated what he had learned before opening them again.

**[You diligently studied the Object Control Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggering a 10x multiplier, you gained tenfold comprehension, slightly improving your understanding of the technique.]**

As expected, familiar text appeared before him. Almost immediately, insights about the technique flooded his mind—far more than a normal reading would provide, thanks to the tenfold boost.

Qi Chuan closed his eyes again, absorbing this newfound knowledge. Soon, he felt his understanding of the technique deepen slightly.

This improvement alone wasn't enough to master the basics, but if he continued at this rate, he would achieve proficiency in no time.

"Then, let's keep studying!"

With renewed focus, Qi Chuan continued poring over the manual, and text notifications appeared intermittently:

**[You diligently studied the Object Control Technique, triggering a 9x multiplier...]**

**[You diligently studied the Object Control Technique, triggering a 12x multiplier...]**

...

**[You diligently studied the Object Control Technique, triggering a 60x multiplier, significantly improving your understanding. You have mastered the basics of the Object Control Technique!]**

Three days later, Qi Chuan opened his eyes in his room, greeted by this final notification. He felt his comprehension of the technique surge, confirming he had reached the basic mastery level.

He nodded in satisfaction. Over these three days, aside from his regular cultivation, he had dedicated all his effort to the Object Control Technique, avoiding other spells. Now, he had finally succeeded.

As the manual had indicated, this technique was indeed more challenging than common Qi Refining spells—it had taken him three full days to grasp the basics.

Turning his gaze to the gray-hued dagger "Flying Ash" beside him, Qi Chuan recalled the technique's methods. He chanted an incantation, then pointed two fingers at the dagger.

Instantly, spiritual energy flowed from his dantian, while a faint stirring in his brow signaled the activation of his mental energy. The Object Control Technique required both.

For simple manipulation, spiritual energy consumption was low, but mental energy usage was higher. However, unleashing the artifact's full offensive power demanded significant spiritual energy.

For now, though, Qi Chuan only needed minimal energy to test its movement.

*Hum.*

As his energy flowed, the dagger trembled slightly before hovering in mid-air. It darted back and forth, then transformed into a gray streak, circling Qi Chuan with a sharp whistling sound.

It almost seemed capable of defensive maneuvers—though in reality, this high-grade artifact was purely offensive. Its defensive capabilities couldn't compare to even the Golden Skin Technique.

Without an opponent, Qi Chuan couldn't test its full power, so he withdrew the dagger.

**[You successfully executed the Object Control Technique and maintained it for a period. Triggering a 3x multiplier, you gained threefold comprehension, slightly improving your understanding.]**

As he deactivated the technique and stored the artifact, another notification appeared, granting him further insights. Absorbing them deepened his mastery.

"Basic proficiency is enough to wield this high-grade artifact for now," Qi Chuan mused. "But pushing it to higher levels would naturally be ideal."

He nodded. Unlike other spells, the Object Control Technique would improve naturally with use over time, eventually reaching perfection. At that stage, even if higher levels didn't drastically boost power, the refined control would be invaluable in combat.

"Next, I'll focus on mastering other essential spells for emergencies. Starting with... the Invisibility Technique."

After mastering Object Control, Qi Chuan turned his attention to other spells, settling on Invisibility first.

"This technique is incredibly useful... At the basic level, it can deceive mortals. At higher levels, even cultivators struggle to detect it."

Skimming the manual's description, he began studying earnestly.

**[You diligently studied the Invisibility Technique, attempting to master its basics. Triggering a 15x multiplier, you gained fifteenfold comprehension, slightly improving your understanding.]**

Soon, another notification appeared...
