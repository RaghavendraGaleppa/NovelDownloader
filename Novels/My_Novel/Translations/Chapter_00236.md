Chapter 236: The Sea of Flowers, The Sword Is Drawn

Forests of shadows concealed lethal traps.

Li Xian’s hand flashed, and his blade fell, cutting down another pursuer. Seeing the encirclement closing in from all sides and the enemy formation solidifying, he grabbed a vine and swung his body through the air, leaping several zhang away. Using the momentum to swing further, he followed up with the "Seven Star Steps," treading on air with incredible speed.

His figure darted and vanished into the forest. The surrounding mob shouted to kill and capture, but they could not catch him.

Li Xian had hunted since childhood and was exceptionally skilled in forest battles.

"The formation is strong, but it requires the coordination of many. I just need to lead them by the nose to render it useless."

Li Xian’s long sword was stained with blood as he cut down several more men. Finally, he saw the sea of flowers on Luanfang Mountain; it was truly a fairyland.

Wildflowers bloomed in abundance, vying for beauty. In the distance, towering mountains stood tall, and a winding river flowed. Colorful mist hovered in the air, spreading a fragrance that intoxicated the soul.

Wen Caishang had seen many beautiful sights in her life. But having just survived numerous dangers and now seeing this sea of flowers, the feeling was incomparable to anything before.

Li Xian felt completely uninhibited and shouted loudly, "Wonderful! It was worth fighting to the death to get here."

"Madam, is this place beautiful?"

Wen Caishang said, "Very beautiful. But we are about to die." Influenced by Li Xian, she cast life and death to the back of her mind.

Li Xian ran wildly, enjoying the flowers and the mist, while using his peripheral vision to observe the terrain. High mountains stood on all sides, cliffs rising a hundred zhang high. It looked like a cage of heaven and earth.

Only one river flowed outward. The water rushed ceaselessly, but the current was not fast.

Li Xian thought, "Though this river is long, the current is slow. If I escape by boat, my speed would be inferior to running on land. If I dive to escape, the water would encase me, making it hard to施展 lightness skill, turning me into a turtle in a jar."

When the Fragrant Mist Flowers bloom, they are accompanied by the strange phenomenon of "colorful mist." For such flowers to grow all over the fields, the area must be rich in water and surrounded by mountains.

Otherwise, the pollen would scatter to the four seas and eight directions, and the colorful mist would disappear. Li Xian ran extremely fast, whipping up a strong wind that stirred the colorful mist.

Wen Caishang said, "You boy, you really aren't afraid of death." She felt both helpless and deeply moved.

Suddenly, a furious voice rang out from outside the sea of flowers: "Hahaha, I thought this小子 was cunning, but it turns out he’s just a reckless fool!"

"Anywhere else to run, yet he enters a cage of his own accord, coming to this sea of flowers. Truly, he has no door to heaven and no path to earth!"

Su Qiuwu, Xi Kairen, Qian Jingpeng, Zhao Zhiyuan, and Li Quan had all arrived.

It turned out that when Li Xian fought his way through, the commotion was detected. Su Qiuwu, Xi Kairen, Qian Jingpeng, Zhao Zhiyuan, and Li Quan were each guarding a vital path. Upon receiving the signal and knowing Li Xian's location, none rushed to kill him immediately. Instead, they followed the plan, pressing forward steadily to shrink the encirclement.

None of them encountered Li Xian on the way. They pressed all the way to the edge of the sea of flowers, met up, and completely trapped him.

Though the sea of flowers was vast and the scenery magnificent, the surrounding cliffs were like a prison room. Seeing that the dust had settled, the several men wore expressions of delight.

The hundreds of disciples behind them had all arrived at the formation. Wen Caishang murmured, "Even if I were uninjured, facing such a siege, I would find it troublesome. There is no path to avoid here; how can we escape?"

Li Xian stood in the mist, saying proudly, "Hmph, a group of old men. The flower mist here is thick; can you catch me?"

Su Qiuwu saw Li Xian carrying Wen Caishang, the two of them looking miserable, a pair of fated lovers. He felt victory was in hand and speculated: "Wen Caishang finds it hard to move; it seems her injury is something she cannot handle. What waves can a mere小子 raise? She has nowhere to run here, surrounded by towering mountains where lightness skill is hard to use. Jumping into the river would be suicide. But to be safe, I should test the waters."

He sneered and said, "You nameless pretty boy, a mere weakling. Usually, you’d have to kowtow and beg just to catch a glimpse of me. Hmph, now you speak boldly, daring to challenge me? You must have cultivated the fortune of several lifetimes. Wen Caishang, you were arrogant and invincible, hahaha, but did you ever imagine today?"

Wen Caishang said coldly, "In the Jianghu, the victor becomes king and the loser becomes a bandit. You men have strength without strategy, strategy without courage, or courage without wisdom. To be honest, I have never looked upon you. Even if I die today, I cannot be bothered to look at you twice."

Everyone was furious and wanted to retort, but they felt powerless. Joining forces to besiege her was not a glorious act to begin with. Although they all held grudges against Wen Caishang, they couldn't help but admire her peerless elegance. The thought that Wen Caishang looked down on them even unto death left a suffocating郁气 in their hearts.

Su Qiuwu said, "Hmph, take him alive! I want to crush all your pride! Only then will I see if you look down on us."

"As for that pretty boy, strike him dead with one palm; he’s an eyesore!"

Su Qiuwu turned his head and said, "Brother Zhao, Brother Li, please join forces." Zhao Zhiyuan said, "Of course!" Li Quan snorted coldly, "A sycophant!" Annoyed by Su Qiuwu's changing attitude, he still commanded, "Attack!"

These men had similar thoughts and were wary of each other, so they sent their subordinates to test the waters. The disciples of the Yellow Sand Sect, Sword Rain Tower, and Taixin Sect, numbering in the hundreds, heard the order and arranged their formations, pressing into the sea of flowers.

Colorful mist swirled, obscuring vision.

Seeing the fierce attack coming, Li Xian swept his leg, unleashing a massive wave of Qi. Dozens of men cried out in alarm, raising their arms to shield their faces.

Colorful mist danced.

Li Xian executed the "Mist Locking the Jianghu" move of the Vast Mist Leg. The Vast Mist Leg derives its meaning from a "vast and misty lake surface," where white mist envelops the lake, making it appear and disappear.

Although this place was not a lake, the colorful mist was thick and hung suspended overhead, achieving a similar effect. By using this move, Li Xian was acting the "host," fully utilizing the advantage of the terrain.

The Yellow Sand Sect摆下了 "Sand Manipulating Soul Lock Formation," the Sword Rain Tower摆下了 "Sword Rain Flying Sword Formation," and the Taixin Sect摆下了 "Bear, Wolf, Tiger, Leopard Formation." The formations were complex and mixed with profound doctrines. Although there was no coordination between them, they were all extremely powerful.

Seeing the killing intent surging and the momentum unstoppable, Li Xian remained calm, using the colorful mist to maneuver skillfully.

Formations rely on coordination, but are also defeated by it... Mutual restraint acts like shackles, inevitably making them clumsy. Although Li Xian carried Wen Caishang, he had trained in lightness skill, and seven clusters of internal Qi gathered to lighten his form. His body was as light as a feather, combined with the characteristics of the "Breeze Leg" and "Vast Mist Leg," allowing him to flash and dodge within the mist, evading repeatedly.

Although the enemy numbers were great and the formations strong, they could do nothing to him. Tied down by his agility, they were like monkeys being played.

It was a pity that such a beautiful sea of flowers was trampled into a mess. The colorful mist grew thicker, and the floral scent attracted poisonous bees.

Screams rose and fell, creating a scene of utter chaos. A disciple of the Sword Rain Tower, holding a sharp sword, thrust into the mist and cursed, "Evil thief, die!" He had several large bumps on his head, dizzy from the flower mist.

Li Xian laughed and said, "Here’s a gift for you." He casually waved his hand, grabbed a ball of flower mist, and threw it using his Qi. It hit the man's face, and the flower mist钻入 his brain through his nose.

The man’s eyes rolled back and he fainted instantly.

Li Xian was like a fish in water, darting back and forth. As the enemies trampled the ground, they stirred up the flower mist, making it even thicker.

Outside the sea of flowers, Su Qiuwu frowned and cursed, "To be delayed by such a person."

Close by, the mist obscured their vision; far away, bees harassed them. The disciples were busy defending themselves, and their formations gradually fell into disorder. One man shouted, "Forget the formation, just catch that小子 first!" and they scattered to pursue.

However, the three sects were gathered here, not very familiar with each other and lacking tacit understanding. While maintaining their formations, they could still distinguish friend from foe. Now that it was chaotic, who knew who Li Xian was?

In this way, Li Xian cleverly used the terrain to turn the disadvantage of being outnumbered into an advantage.

The men were suffering, but they were in a dilemma. The sea of flowers was vast, figures were乱, and the mist was thick. The chaos was overwhelming, and directions were hard to distinguish. It was now extremely difficult to escape this place.

Xi Kairen was anxious and helpless, shouting orders, but the disciples were struggling to protect themselves and were panicked; how could they listen? He cursed, "What a cunning小子!"

Su Qiuwu, Li Quan, Zhao Zhiyuan, and the others looked grim, all feeling their sect's dignity was受损. Catching a turtle in a jar, yet being toyed with by the turtle. A cornered beast fighting back, struggling to the death, yet they truly could not catch him for a long time.

They all thought: "This小子 has followed Wen Caishang for some time and must have learned some tricks. Our disciples are many, but there are no outstanding ones. The terrain here does not give us the advantage in capturing him. If I were to enter the fray personally, capturing him would be easy. But I fear Wen Caishang might still have a fraction of her strength left."

"If she launches a desperate attack and takes my life, where would I go to reason?"

The five men hesitated, observing each other silently. After a moment, Su Qiuwu said, "Brother Li, when you captured the witch last time, your martial prowess was extraordinary and you showed great might. But it was entirely due to carelessness that she escaped. Such a great opportunity, why not show your hand, capture the witch a second time, and prove your strength."

Li Quan was easily provoked, but he had a great dislike for Su Qiuwu. If someone else had asked, he might have charged into the sea of flowers in a surge of passion. But now he said, "Hmph, Brother Su speaks sweetly, but I haven't seen you make a move. You plan from behind the scenes and have a long-term strategy. If you acted personally, it would be a sure thing. Why ask me to interfere?"

"Brother Zhao?" Su Qiuwu, seeing Li Quan refuse, turned his head.

Zhao Zhiyuan sneered, "Su Qiuwu, don't try to scheme against me. Your calculations, Li Quan might not see, but do you think I don't?"

The group fell silent for a while. Qian Jinghao said, "Since that's the case, let the five of us join forces to capture and kill. No one needs to calculate, so we don't give the witch any cheap advantage."

Su Qiuwu said, "Alright!" Li Quan, Zhao Zhiyuan... had no objections. They exchanged glances and charged into the mist!

Wen Caishang murmured, "These men barely stepped into the Third Realm. In my eyes, they are nothing. But right now, you would find even one hard to handle."

Li Xian laughed, "I was afraid they wouldn't come." He ran away with all his might. Li Quan's speed was incredibly fast, closing in in the blink of an eye and striking a palm down.

Li Xian grabbed a man beside him and threw him at Li Quan. With a bang, a mist of blood scattered, terrifying to behold. Li Xian drew his long sword, thrusting out the "Setting Sun Like Blood" move from the "Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword."

Li Xian’s swordsmanship was far inferior to Li Quan's. But Li Quan felt the "Setting Sun Like Blood" sword was very exquisite and profound in its artistry.加之 Wen Caishang was behind Li Xian, he felt constrained, like a mouse fearing the cat, and did not dare use ruthless moves.

Li Xian’s sword wind swept, and he laughed, "You eunuch, look at the others! They are all using you as the vanguard!"

Li Quan shrank back and indeed saw Su Qiuwu and the others intentionally slowing down, keeping a great distance, intending to watch the show. Li Quan was both angry and annoyed, and his intent to attack dropped immediately.

Li Xian seized this gap, leaped up, and his figure rose several zhang high. The seven clusters of internal Qi condensed by the "Seven Star Steps" burst open at the base of his spine. Li Xian stepped on the air, and his figure rose several zhang higher.

Li Quan was angry at his companions' treachery, but seeing Li Xian about to make a big move, worried that another dangerous plan would emerge, he disregarded everything and leaped to grab him.

Wen Caishang frowned and sneered, "Watch the sword!"
