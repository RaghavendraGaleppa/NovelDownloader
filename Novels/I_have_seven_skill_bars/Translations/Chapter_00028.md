**Chapter 28: Departure**

Ding Rui was still stuck at Qi Condensation first level, not daring to advance. Wu Ang and Le You had only recently entered Qi Condensation second level, still diligently cultivating, far from condensing all their True Essence into liquid form to reach the peak of Qi Condensation second level. Yang Shou, at the peak of Qi Condensation third level, was considered the strongest in Spirit Field 377. Moreover, with Yang Shou's current cultivation, it wouldn't be long before he would directly enter the Foundation Establishment stage, then leave the spirit field and become an outer disciple!

However, although Yang Shou's cultivation was high and he was older, his temper was excellent, and his attitude towards Ding Rui was even the most respectful among the three. This put Ding Rui greatly at ease. He was somewhat afraid that new arrivals with strange temperaments might cause conflicts in the spirit field. That would be too much of a waste of time.

After the few of them got to know each other, Liu Yun, who had gone to logistics to get his Spirit Farmer identity certified, finally returned. When Ding Rui saw Liu Yun again, the latter was already wearing a set of yellow-green Spirit Farmer clothes, the colors a bit abstract, but still much better than the entirely dull yellowish-brown robes of the spirit field cultivators. His entire demeanor immediately seemed to elevate several notches. Liu Yun himself was beaming with joy. The difficulty of becoming a Spirit Farmer was no less than that of becoming an outer disciple. In fact, in some aspects, it was even harder than forming a foundation and becoming an outer disciple.

Ding Rui also took this opportunity to thoroughly inquire about his cultivation problems. Although there was no wine or food, Ding Rui didn't feel that this farewell lacked flavor. For the first time, he felt the joy of discussing the Dao, even though both of them were currently mere novices, and what they exchanged could hardly be called a Dao discussion. But this method of exchange indeed possessed a unique charm!

Early the next morning, Liu Yun departed. Ding Rui also woke up early. Although he hadn't slept a wink, he didn't feel tired, which was naturally one of the benefits of cultivation. Ding Rui knew he had to work even harder. With Liu Yun's departure, he was once again assigned a rain-summoning task, and his overtime hours would naturally be less than before. However, the reward resources after the harvest would also increase by one portion. He had no complaints about this; with his skill slots, he could quickly finish these tasks. Moreover, he was destined to become a Spirit Farmer; if he couldn't even handle these tasks, how could he manage an entire spirit field in the future?

It's worth mentioning that during this period, the spirit rice in Spirit Field 377, thanks to Ding Rui's presence, suffered no losses from the start, as if the giant aphids were nonexistent. This was despite cultivators like Old Huang and Liu Yun having left the spirit field. Although Ding Rui also helped other spirit fields, they still incurred some losses. In comparison, Spirit Field 377 naturally had a higher yield. To those mobile spirit field cultivators, it was slightly unfair. But there was nothing to be done about it. Absolute fairness was hard to achieve, and even if there were differences in yield between spirit fields, they wouldn't be too significant, so the spirit field cultivators had already implicitly accepted this imperfect fairness.

After Ding Rui and the new cultivators had spent some time in initial contact and exchange, Spirit Field 377 quieted down once more.
