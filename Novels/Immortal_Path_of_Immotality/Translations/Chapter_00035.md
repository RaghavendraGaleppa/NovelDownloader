# Chapter 35: Duel with an Innate Expert

At the Zhao residence, Lin Shan was inquiring with the family head and elders about pills that could help break through to the Innate Realm. Now that he possessed Ancient Rhyme, his confidence had grown. He wanted to test his theory and see if he could quickly advance to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement.

However, the Zhao family elders all claimed they had never heard of such pills. 

Patriarch Zhao frankly admitted that if such pills existed, they would have consumed them long ago—otherwise, the Zhao family wouldn't lack an Innate expert to oversee their affairs.

As for pills to break through to the Postnatal Realm, the Zhao family did possess some, but they were similar to the Meridian-Clearing Pills Lin Shan had taken earlier—merely increasing the chances for an ordinary person to enter the Postnatal Qi-Exchange stage. 

Pills for higher realms were rare treasures. Even if obtained, they would be consumed immediately—who would be foolish enough to leave them for future generations?

With no leads, Lin Shan turned his attention to another matter. Given his current strength, what once seemed unattainable was now within reach.

At the Nightingale headquarters, in the Tranquil Abode's third floor.

"Where the hell have you been these past two years? You didn't complete a single mission! If I hadn't covered for you, your identity token would've been revoked long ago!" 

Steward Jiang huffed and puffed as he berated Lin Shan.

Rubbing the back of his head sheepishly, Lin Shan could only smile apologetically. He couldn't very well say he'd become addicted to cultivation and lost track of time. 

After offering repeated apologies—since the old man had gone out of his way to help him—Lin Shan quickly brought up his request to meet Guardian Jiang. This time, Steward Jiang didn't object and led him upstairs directly.

After all, following Lin Shan's last visit, Guardian Jiang had clearly taken a liking to the young man, gifting him two Innate-level cultivation manuals. Steward Jiang wasn't entirely sure about the nature of their relationship now.

Upon reaching the fourth floor, they found Guardian Jiang seated on the hall's steps, "swallowing clouds and spitting mist" as he cultivated. Lin Shan watched with fascination.

*Hmm, the true qi of an Innate expert is indeed different from a cultivator's spiritual energy. It carries an overbearing, explosive quality, with faint traces of blood essence mixed in,* Lin Shan mused as he observed.

In contrast, the spiritual energy he cultivated was far gentler, harmonizing with nature, pure as water—unlike the impure, chaotic nature of true qi.

---

About fifteen minutes later, Guardian Jiang concluded his session. Without keeping Lin Shan waiting, he dropped a bombshell:

"Should I address you as Lin Shan... or Innate Expert Young Master Lin?"

Guardian Jiang wore a knowing smirk, while Steward Jiang beside him gaped at Lin Shan as if seeing a monster.

"You—you're an Innate expert?!"

"Tsk, no need to shout! I've noticed Nightingale folks always make such a fuss. It's quite startling, you know?" 

Now that his strength had grown, Lin Shan's courage had swelled accordingly. He voiced the dissatisfaction he'd harbored for some time.

"N-no, I was just surprised..." Steward Jiang's voice trailed off. Though he still found it hard to believe, if Guardian Jiang said so, there was no room for doubt.

Lin Shan paid no mind to whether the old man believed him—it hardly mattered. 

He wasn't surprised Guardian Jiang knew either. Nightingale had its intelligence network, and after the incident at the Zhao residence that night, any influential figure in Zangke City would be aware—except perhaps idle retirees like Steward Jiang.

With a faint smile, Lin Shan clasped his hands toward Guardian Jiang. 

"I haven't yet thanked you for your kindness that day. Actually, I've come today to ask a favor."

Though he spoke of requesting assistance, Lin Shan's demeanor subtly suggested an equal footing.

"Oh? It seems you've encountered tremendous fortune these past two years. Having reached the Innate Realm, your courage has grown considerably." Guardian Jiang didn't inquire how Lin Shan had leaped from Postnatal to Innate. Instead, he beckoned.

"Exchange a few moves with me. Let me gauge your worth. If I'm satisfied with your strength, we can discuss anything."

Lin Shan's excitement stirred. He'd been curious about his current level—while he could slaughter Postnatal experts, even first-rate martial artists, with ease, he'd never faced an Innate expert before. 

Judging by Guardian Jiang's aura, he seemed to have progressed beyond half-step Innate, possibly crossing that critical threshold!

"In that case, I'll gladly oblige!"

"After you!"

"After you!"

---

Without ceremony, Lin Shan unleashed two three-foot-wide wind blades that shot forth with a *whoosh*, mere blurs of cyan light carrying razor-sharp pressure.

Guardian Jiang startled at their speed, hastily drawing his saber to block left and right.

*Clang! Clang!*

The wind blades shattered against his saber, but the impact forced him back two steps.

"Not bad, kid!"

His praise barely left his lips when two more wind blades came slicing toward him.

Again, Guardian Jiang dispersed them with powerful saber strokes, though the force drove him back another two steps.

*Huh? So the wind blades don't just cut—they also repel.* Lin Shan rubbed his chin thoughtfully while simultaneously launching three more—high, middle, and low trajectories.

---

Guardian Jiang had no time to dodge. Pouring true qi into his blade, he barely managed to shatter the projectiles, but the effort brought a metallic taste to his throat as he staggered back until his shoulders hit the wall.

Before he could swallow the blood rising in his throat, five wind blades bloomed toward him like flower petals, sealing all escape routes.

*What the hell?!*

Guardian Jiang nearly cursed aloud. Wasn't this supposed to be a spar? Since when did they escalate to lethal force? Had he offended the kid somehow?

With no time to ponder, he mustered 120% focus—slicing left, twisting to evade low, then rolling desperately to avoid the remaining three.

*Boom! Boom! Boom!*

The deafening impacts behind him heralded a sudden icy gale sweeping through the hall. Without looking, Guardian Jiang knew the wall had been pierced—why else would outside wind be rushing in?

Massaging his aching wrist, suppressing the internal tearing from his abrupt maneuvers, he looked up to see Lin Shan preparing another five wind blades.

"Stop! Stop! That's enough!"

"???"

"Hold it right there! Cease!"

"..."

Lin Shan was baffled. He'd barely warmed up—the exchange had been going well, hadn't it? 

Seeing Guardian Jiang successively counter his attacks, he'd finally felt matched. Why call it off just as things got interesting?

Guardian Jiang regarded him like some apparition, his expression a mix of shock and wariness. "What realm *are* you in? How can you release sword qi so rapidly—and so massive at that?"

"I'm not sure about my realm. Sword qi? Well, close enough. Isn't this basic for Innate experts?" Lin Shan sounded genuinely puzzled.

*Basic?!* Guardian Jiang nearly choked on his own blood. Had he not stopped when he did, those last five blades would've sent him straight to the underworld!

Meanwhile, Steward Jiang stood frozen like a wooden chicken, especially when he saw the gaping hole in the far wall where Lin Shan's attacks had cleaved through. 

*This* was an Innate expert? Firing consecutive sword qi from ten paces without breaking a sweat? In comparison, Guardian Jiang seemed like a mere Postnatal practitioner barely holding his ground.

For a moment, Steward Jiang wondered if Guardian Jiang had been replaced by an impostor.

*How can there be such a gap between Innate experts?*

---

Lin Shan watched Guardian Jiang approach. "Are you sure you weren't holding back earlier?"

He couldn't shake the feeling Guardian Jiang had easily countered his attacks while restraining his true power—as if conducting a measured test.

Guardian Jiang's expression was complex. "That *was* my full strength. I never imagined your sword qi could reach so far with such force! If not for the Kunwu Blade you gifted me, my weapon would've shattered on the first strike. As for the rest..." He shook his head.

"But projecting true qi is fundamental for Innate experts. Why didn't you counter with sword qi of your own?" Lin Shan pressed like an inquisitive child.

Without a word, Guardian Jiang raised his Kunwu Blade, gathering true qi until his aura surged like a rainbow.

With a mighty swing toward the far wall—

*Is he finally showing his true power? He was holding back after all! Did he fear injuring me earlier?* Lin Shan's eyes sparkled with anticipation.

A three-inch cold light shot from the blade—like a serpent's flickering tongue—before dissipating five paces away.

"???"

"That's it?!" Lin Shan blurted out.

Such a puny projection couldn't compare even to his Qi Refinement first-layer days—and the range was half his current capability!

"......"

Guardian Jiang's face twitched, wishing he could vanish into the floor. Compared to Lin Shan, his display was indeed... lacking in both length and potency.
