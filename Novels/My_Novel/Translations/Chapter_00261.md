Chapter 261: Past Intimacy, a Dreamlike Shadow; Scoundrel, You Betrayed My Sincere Heart

The night sky was dotted with stars, but dark clouds obscured the moon.

The异马 (Strange Horse), Haoxue, galloped down the road, its mane flying and its body sleek. The Yihe Manor was extremely wealthy. Wen Cai Chang raised seven strange horses: Baiyun, Haoxue, Zhufeng, Qianyue... Each had unique abilities and the appearance of a gentleman among horses.

The cold wind brushed past her hair tips, and her willow-like eyebrows furrowed and relaxed intermittently.

She arrived at Huangshan Town late at night. The idle soldiers at the city gates were drowsy, and the shops on the streets were closed. Pedestrians, mostly martial artists, came and went in small groups.

The current situation was chaotic. Many places enforced a curfew, but martial artists roamed the four corners of the world, fearing the scorching sun and often choosing to travel at night. This inevitably clashed with the curfew.

A single set of rules was difficult to apply to all.

Wen Cai Chang dismounted and gently stroked Haoxue's mane. The horse's sweat exuded a fragrance, and its speed was incredibly fast within a radius of dozens of miles. Under the moonlight, its body seemed to be shrouded in a dark halo.

As soon as she entered the city, the martial artists on the street couldn't help but cast their gazes her way. Only after the beautiful horse and the stunning woman had moved far away did they come back to their senses.

Wen Cai Chang walked slowly down the street, her eyes scanning the surroundings. She didn't see Li Xian's figure and thought to herself:

"What surprise is Li Xian preparing? Why hasn't he returned for so long? With his intelligence and strategy, even the most dangerous and wicked affairs should be resolvable by him. I suppose he is safe and sound. If... if anyone truly dares to harm a single hair on his head, humph, I will make them pay dearly."

Her beautiful eyes filled with killing intent as she walked to the middle of the street.

Her clothes fluttered, and her steps were graceful. In her white dress and silk shoes, her coiled cloud-like bun remained undisturbed. After turning through several streets, she suddenly saw the inn where they had stayed the night before. Thinking of the tenderness of last night and the romantic atmosphere in the inn, her pretty face couldn't help but flush. She thought: "Could Little Xian have returned here? I'll go in and ask."

The inn was hung with yellow lanterns, and candlelight shone through the window paper.

The innkeeper's apprentice was on the night shift, dozing off. Suddenly, he smelled a fragrant breeze and heard a clear voice: "Innkeeper, has my husband been here?"

The voice was crisp and melodious, secretly carrying internal energy that instantly sharpened his senses.

The innkeeper's apprentice immediately woke up, secretly lamenting that his good dream had been brief and vanished in an instant. Last night, he had served Wen Cai Chang and Li Xian and had exclaimed that they were a celestial couple, feeling immense envy. He had stared at them for a long time, his imagination running wild until he fell into a dream. When he opened his eyes, he saw the fairy-like woman standing before him again.

He said, "Your husband... ah, that young man?"

Wen Cai Chang casually tossed a piece of silver and said softly, "That's right."

The innkeeper's apprentice said, "He's been here, he's been here. He rented the same room as last night."

Wen Cai Chang's face lit up with joy. "He's really here!" Her eyebrows instantly relaxed, and her face was filled with pleasure and intoxication, which made the innkeeper's apprentice stare, captivated.

After watching her leave, the innkeeper's apprentice gently sniffed the silver. Fearing he might be noticed, he carefully wrapped it up, unsure where to put it. He was afraid to carry it on his person, lest it contaminate the fragrance, but also feared someone might steal it.

Wen Cai Chang lifted her skirt and went upstairs, remembering the bedroom from last night. When she reached the door, she saw footprints on the ground, confirming it was indeed Li Lang. But when she pushed the door open, the room was empty. How could it look like someone was there?

She had originally guessed that Li Xian had rented the room because he planned to stay in this town for a few days to prepare a "surprise" for her. He must have gone to take care of it now, which was why he wasn't in the room. Her heart was full of anticipation, and she felt that Li Xian was thoughtful, full of strange ideas and bad water. She also thought she should leave and pretend she didn't know, so as not to spoil his plans.

But then she suddenly saw a letter pinned under the corner of the table. She was startled, realizing it was left by Li Xian. A sense of foreboding washed over her, and she quickly picked it up.

She opened the envelope and read the contents. Although Li Xian's calligraphy was only at a beginner's level, his spirit was strong, and his character was firm and pure. His writing, like himself, was naturally bold and open-minded, with a free and elegant touch in the hooks and strokes. However, the transitions in several places, though improved, were still a bit lacking.

Though his brushwork was shallow, it was extremely pleasing to the eye.

Wen Cai Chang's heart lurched when she saw the four characters "To Madam Wen." She thought: "We are so close, why is there a need to convey matters through a letter?" She read further, and the brief words struck her like a blow to the heart.

When she read the words "our debts of gratitude are settled," her whole body trembled, and she was completely oblivious to her surroundings.

How could she believe it!

She put down the envelope, closed her eyes, and took a deep breath. Trembling, she read the letter's contents again.

This time, there was no mistake. The content was concise, and the tone was resolute.

Her eyes couldn't help but well up, and her eyelids turned red. "Our debts of gratitude are settled... our debts of gratitude are settled... Li Lang... what a good Li Lang! So... you were always... always calculating the debts of gratitude, and from the very beginning... you wanted to leave me!"

"What I hate most is being deceived, yet you have deceived me so much. You said you would gouge out your eyes for me, but secretly you were preparing to escape. You... you truly cannot be trusted, you have no truth in you. I... I have a lifetime of prestige, yet I keep being fooled by you!"

"I, Wen Cai Chang, treat you with such sincerity. When have I ever fallen for someone else like this? I am only like this for you, yet you... you... don't know what's good for you! Fine, fine! Since you are heartless, don't blame me for being unrighteous. You say our debts of gratitude are settled, but when have I, Wen Cai Chang, ever been polite to strangers? Our debts are settled, and you think I'll let you go? Dream on!"

She flicked her sleeve. After her injury had healed, she had accumulated a bit of internal energy. At this moment, she unleashed it, and it was bone-chillingly cold. Frost filled the room, and the wooden bed, table, and windows... all made "cracking" sounds, shattering into pieces.

Her aura suddenly dropped, and the coldness melted away. The joyful experiences of these past days were something she would never forget in her life, and many past events surged into her heart.

She was completely lost. Matters of the heart, the more you calculate, the more chaotic they become.

They had been separated for only half a day, yet she missed him as if a knife were cutting her heart. In the future, there would be no one to share joy with, no one to confide in. How unbearable would the long years be?

She hated Li Xian for running away on his own, yet she loved him极 (extremely).

"You scoundrel. Do you think you can get away?"

Wen Cai Chang's eyes were cold and dark. She circulated her energy to regulate her breath, gradually suppressing her loss of composure. She carefully folded the letter and hid it seriously in her sleeve, thinking: "Hmph!"

"When I catch you and bring you back, I will make you explain the meaning of this letter in detail."

Her gaze softened, and she said: "Li Lang, if you admit your mistake properly, I... I won't blame you anymore."

Thinking of the past sweetness, it was truly a rare and joyful time in her life. Her heart was stirred, and her affection was already poured onto Li Xian. But thinking of the words "settled" in the letter, hatred, annoyance, and helplessness once again filled her heart.

All kinds of emotions surged. She took a few steps, her legs went slightly weak, her face and lips were pale, her soul seemed to have left her body, her thoughts were numerous and complicated.

The innkeeper's apprentice saw her coming downstairs and racked his brains to get a few more glances. Seeing her lost and dazed, she even exuded an air of desolation.

She had fled with Li Xian along the way and knew well that Li Xian was clever and full of tricks. She mounted her horse and searched the surrounding mountains and wilds.

She couldn't find a single trace.

Considering that her injury had just healed, it was difficult for her to find him. She said: "Li Lang, oh Li Lang, you are indeed clever. In the past, this cleverness saved me..."

Her face was gentle as honey. Suddenly, a coldness flashed through it. "Fine, now you use this cleverness to avoid me!"

She sneered: "Can you escape? Hmph, we'll see."

She used to love this cleverness so much, but now she hated it. She rode her horse eastward, intending to return to the manor quickly.

She pondered in her heart:

"This scoundrel is too cunning. Searching like this is useless. I need to recover my strength to forty percent as soon as possible. With the Silkworm Clothes Green Jade Art, I should be able to find him."

Wen Cai Chang was full of anxiety. When she returned to the manor, the sky was just beginning to turn pale. The outer courtyard sounded with gongs, and the guards were conducting their morning patrol around the manor.

Suddenly, she heard an urgent order to assemble.

In the spacious open space of the outer courtyard, Wen Cai Chang's face was as cold as frost. She said淡淡ly (calmly):

"Li Xian has betrayed the manor, his crime is heinous. All of you, go and find him."

Ding Hu's heart skipped a beat, filled with endless emotion. He couldn't help but sigh: "We saw him build his高楼 (high-rise building), we saw his building collapse. Li Xian actually dared to betray the manor, truly... truly audacious to the extreme! Li Xian is also a rare talent, but unfortunately, his heart is not content, and in the end, he has ruined himself. Everything he has was given by the Madam. If the Madam decides to take it back, then he will have nothing."

He quickly said: "Madam, this traitor was highly valued and enjoyed the manor's cultivation. Now he has forgotten his roots and betrayed his righteousness, actually daring to betray the manor. As the commander, it is my duty to capture this traitor!"

Wen Cai Chang's willow eyebrows furrowed, and her sleeve sword shot out, slicing off the upper lip of Ding Hu. Blood gushed out. She said coldly: "Li Xian is indeed ungrateful, humph, but it is not your place to comment on him. You just need to do your duty, find clues about him for me, and capture him."

"Without my permission, you are not to curse him."

Ding Hu's face was covered in blood. He sealed his acupoints to stop the bleeding and lowered his head deeply. He thought to himself, Li Xian has betrayed the manor, why is the Madam protecting him like this? Could there be another reason?

Wen Cai Chang sighed in her heart:

"Li Xian is such a person, how could you lot capture him? It's just that I can't go personally for the time being, so I need you to try. It's better than nothing. And this scoundrel Li Xian is best at doing the opposite. He might be hiding nearby. Spreading a wide net might have a miraculous effect."

Wen Cai Chang immediately made arrangements:

"Each of you will take a hundred taels of silver, hire friends from the martial world, and use various connections to spread the net wide. Ding Hu, you will take a thousand taels of silver and go quickly to the Qingning County government office to communicate with the county magistrate for assistance."

"Whoever finds a clue will be heavily rewarded. Whoever captures him alive will be even more heavily rewarded. A hundred mu of good land, buildings and shops, a thousand taels of gold, top-tier martial arts, fine treasure recipes, rare treasures... I will not be stingy."

Suddenly, she thought that if her layout led to Li Xian being surrounded and attacked, covered in wounds and blood, he would be so pitiful. Her heart softened, and she said: "But he must be captured alive, and... and don't injure him too severely."

The guards didn't know the reason and all mourned for Li Xian in their hearts: "The Madam hates Li Xian to the core and wants to capture him alive. It must be to torture him with cruel punishments to warn others."

They all responded with a loud shout.

Wen Cai Chang waved her hand and said: "Go, each of you!"

A moment later, Uncle Xiang hurried over and asked: "Madam, why are you making such a big fuss? The money you're spending is a lot."

Wen Cai Chang was调配 (preparing) medicinal herbs, feeling her own pulse, and said calmly: "I have my own plans."

"Uncle Xiang, this boy is cunning. I need to heal and recover from my injury for now. You should also go and search."

Uncle Xiang said: "Madam, this seems like using a sledgehammer to kill a chicken..." Wen Cai Chang said sternly: "Go."

Uncle Xiang said: "Alright!" and also left the manor.

Now, speaking of Li Xian, who fled overnight, he figured that Wen Cai Chang, whether angry or furious, would surely send guards to pursue him.

"The Qiong Tian Prefecture has many enemies. I haven't had peace for long, and there's another chase. It's better to do the opposite. I'll flee along the routes I'm most familiar with."

The Shou Long Banquet was over.

He fled from the Hua Shui Prefecture, passing through Tiger Cry Ridge and the mysterious mountain range. After the waters darkened and the flowers brightened, he arrived at Chong Ling Prefecture and returned to Qiong Tian Prefecture. He moved around between these prefectures for several months. The choice of routes, the handling of enemies, and the management of daily life were all decided by Li Xian himself, holding the map. Wen Cai Chang would massage his shoulders and legs and serve him food and drink. She rarely paid attention to the route of travel.

He had an excellent memory and still remembered the escape route clearly. Therefore, he was more familiar with the route connecting Hua Shui Prefecture and Chong Ling Prefecture.

If you flee south, go north; if you flee north, go south.

Li Xian sighed: "The world plays tricks on people. I am like duckweed, floating wherever the wind blows, unable to control myself."

He traveled through the night, with a light pack and simple preparations. In the latter half of his escape with Wen Cai Chang, they had ample money and wealth, like a tour, spending money like water. Now, feeling his pockets, he only had a little碎银 (broken silver).

"Spending other people's money, one is heroic and generous. Spending one's own money, one has to be careful and calculating. Although I can beat up纨绔 (rich playboys) and rob some money, it's more likely to attract trouble. If Madam Wen were to come personally, she knows my habits, and I would be in great danger."

"If she really catches up, she will most likely want to kill me. At the very least, she will break my hands and feet. Alas, when I risked my life to save her, I had already foreseen this. So what? I just want to leave without shame. I will hold my head high."

Li Xian slept in the wild at night, finding a gravelly open space. He raised his palm and swept it, scattering the gravel and laying down soft grass as a bed. Lying in it, the forest wind mixed with the fragrance of plants and the faint moisture of water mist... it was quite comfortable.

Li Xian unfastened his water bag. Thinking of their flight across thousands of miles, in the most dangerous times, they shared a water bag, drinking from each other's mouths without feeling it was strange. Now, they had turned against each other.

He could only drink to the moon.

Sleeping under the stars and the moon, he always felt an emptiness in his arms, and it felt a bit uncomfortable.

"Strength... my strength is still too weak. If I were stronger than the Madam, how could I let her be so arrogant? Hmph, I would spank her with a big slap and make her submissive."

Li Xian thought this was quite interesting. The sadness instantly lessened, and his desire to pursue the martial path grew stronger.

He had high ambitions and disliked being constrained. Although he lamented that his life was like duckweed, drifting with the wind, his character was open-minded. When the wind blew and he drifted, he did not feel inferior, pity himself, or sigh with sorrow. Instead, he felt the vastness of the world and its infinite beauty.

"When I achieve success in the martial path in the future, I will surely sweep away all the injustices in my heart. But no matter how big the matter is, it's not as good as a good dream tonight. I'll just sleep!"

He bent his arms and used them as a pillow, his breathing calm.

The next day.

Li Xian climbed the mountains and traveled. After walking more than ten miles, he saw an official road. Following the official road, he entered a town.

He didn't know where to go for now, but he knew his money was running out. He only had a few taels of gold left on him.

So he went to a money shop and exchanged the gold for silver. Dozens of taels of silver were heavy, and he hid them in his chest pocket. The bulging pocket made him feel very secure.

Li Xian pondered: "I have left the Yihe Manor, our debts of gratitude are settled, and I have returned to being a free man. But I only have a一身 (whole body) of martial arts, no property or business under my name, and I need to save all my resources."

"In this world... money is not easy to earn!"

His stomach was growling with hunger. Nearby, he saw a tea stall. Since it was still early, there were few customers. He sat in a remote corner and ordered a bowl of plain hot porridge and some fried small crispy vegetables.

While waiting for the food, he sorted out everything he had:

Thirty-four taels of silver, poison powder, darts, jade pendant, sachet, silver hairpin, jade dagger, Shenjiang sword, Gang Lei Zhi martial art, Hua Long Men token, Crane Middle Pillar, brush, ink stick, water bag, Green Water Pearl, Iron Copper Body martial art, seven scrolls of paintings, nine scrolls of calligraphy...

Since he was poor as a child, he cherished everything he obtained. He had thought of discarding some杂物 (miscellaneous items) to travel light several times, but after thinking it over, he couldn't bear to part with any of them.

When traveling, his appearance was handsome and dashing, but under his clothes, it was packed full of杂物.

Even during their flight across thousands of miles, he had gained something.

He actually had a few more treasures.

Li Xian originally had the "Yellow Dao Bow," which was very powerful. But the tomb in the mountains was too dangerous. When Wen Cai Chang was surrounded, Li Xian disguised himself as a disciple of the Wuji Dao Sect. To be safe, he was afraid that carrying the Yellow Dao Bow would reveal his identity, so he found a hidden place and buried it.

The jade pendant, sachet, and silver hairpin were all from Wen Cai Chang. During their chaotic and passionate moments, they had unconsciously ended up on his body. Li Xian thought: "I'll just keep these things as souvenirs. I'll hold onto them for now."

He searched around. Luckily, he didn't bring out any stockings or肚兜 (stomach wraps).

Li Xian spread out the calligraphy and paintings.

The calligraphy was crooked and uneven... all from Wen Cai Chang. At the bottom left of each piece of calligraphy, there was a "signature." The year and month, the place and the person who wrote it.

Wen Cai Chang was extremely reluctant. This was very damaging to her face. She thought that if it were to leak out in the future, wouldn't she lose all face? Li Xian, full of bad ideas, had to force her. His attitude was strong. Wen Cai Chang resisted for a moment, then gave in and had to obediently sign her name.

Nine scrolls of calligraphy and seven scrolls of paintings... all had signatures. Li Xian coughed twice, rolled up the paintings, and hid them under his clothes.

"The martial arts manuals I possess are two: Gang Lei Zhi and Iron Copper Body... I bought these two when I was at the height of my glory, spending a lot of money."

"I have already practiced them to perfection. If I really need money, I can sell them to get money. With these thirty or so taels, if I spend it frugally, it can last me a long time."

The innkeeper's apprentice brought the plain porridge and small dishes. It was steaming hot, refreshing and not greasy. Li Xian ate the small crispy vegetables and finished the plain porridge in one go.

He put down a few copper coins.

The street was already very lively. Li Xian knew his appearance was eye-catching and wanted to avoid crowded places in the town. He saw a roadside cart vendor selling dry cakes, coarse grains, and cured meat.

Li Xian said: "Shopkeeper, how much?"

The vendor said: "Three wen for the filled ones, two wen for the unfilled ones."

Throughout the dynasties, Qiong Tian Prefecture was poor and sparsely populated. Dry cakes were made from "coarse millet," which was rough and difficult to swallow. Unless it was for a long and arduous journey, ordinary people would not eat them.

Li Xian said: "Give me thirty filled ones and thirty unfilled ones." He hesitated for a moment, then added: "And another cured sausage."

The vendor was startled and said with a smile: "Sir, are you crossing the mountains?" He counted thirty dry cakes each and pressed them down with a wooden board.

He wrapped them tightly in coarse cloth. Li Xian paid and settled the bill, carrying the dry cakes on his back. He weighed them lightly. They were very solid.

To the east of this city was a large mountain. Li Xian walked into the wild mountains to avoid pursuit. He figured it would be hard to see anyone for several days, so he bought food in advance.

This saved him the trouble of hunting, and during this period, he could focus on practicing martial arts.

"Senior Lu's Five Organs Avoiding Turbidity Meeting Yang Meridian has been in my mind for a long time. But I haven't practiced it once. Now is the time to practice it."

Li Xian already had a direction.

To improve his martial path and enhance himself, there is a broad path ahead. Along the way, he saw some bookstores and spent some of his remaining money on calligraphy, paintings, brushes, and ink.

After leaving the town, he walked into the continuous mountain ranges.

He filled his water bag, and Li Xian took a bite of dry cake and a mouthful of water. It was quite free and easy.

Now, speaking of the other side.

Wen Cai Chang, with the help of good medicine, disrupted the five elements of the "Food Qi Gu" (Food Energy Worm), reversing its yin and yang, making its speed of transforming into Qi sharply decrease.

She also successively drank "Red Treasure Ancestral Ginseng" and "Prayer to Heaven Pure Water"... to speed up her healing. These many rare treasures and strange medicines were very difficult to find.

Her injury had been stable for a long time, and the situation was stable. With slow conditioning, she would be fully recovered in ten days or so. She didn't need to use these rare treasures and strange medicines. But she couldn't calm her mind, and she knew Li Xian was cunning. The more days she wasted, the harder it would be to find him.

So when preparing the medicine, she used heavy and strange medicines. "Red Treasure Ancestral Ginseng" was a powerful healing medicine with a very strong effect, and it could stir up distracting thoughts.

She couldn't help but think of the matters on the boat again. When she was intimate with Li Xian, she had been worried that Li Xian would leave her. Who knew that her worries would come true, and Li Xian would really escape.

"Men in this world are always fickle. It's really wrong to indulge them. Li Xian... Li Lang... if I catch you. Don't blame me for punishing you severely. If I don't punish you, my heart aches so much, who should I take it out on?"

Her figure was graceful as she walked into the Yun Xiang Building. She selected more precious medicines and started another furnace to boil. Suddenly, she heard a voice: "Stinky woman, where is the boy beside you?"

The black sea cucumber, with its soft body,钻出 (crawled out) from between the cabinets. It could escape repeatedly and was extremely powerful.

Wen Cai Chang couldn't be bothered to pay attention to it. She walked around gracefully, taking the medicinal herbs. This Yun Xiang Pavilion held countless treasures, and it was not all collected by her alone.

The black sea cucumber clamored: "Stinky woman, where is the boy beside you? Did my blessing work? Aiyo... I see you with furrowed brows, hurt by love. Hahaha, you lewd woman, as expected..."

It rambled on nonsense, completely out of line. Wen Cai Chang usually rarely paid attention to it. But today, she was inexplicably angry and flicked the black sea cucumber up with her sword.

The sword light was dense, thousands of sword flashes in an instant. The sword shadows flashed quickly, shining frequently, and then completely disappeared. But the black sea cucumber was chopped into pieces, then into mincemeat, and finally into fine dust that was almost invisible and melted into the heavens and earth.

The black sea cucumber shouted: "Pain! Pain! Ah, so painful! Stop, stop chopping, aiyo... it's killing me!"

When it was split in two, its voice split into two. When it was split into four, its voice split into four... Later, countless voices shouted, making Wen Cai Chang extremely annoyed.

She pulled back her sleeve and sheathed her sword, and said calmly: "If you say one more word of nonsense, can't I deal with you?"

The black sea cucumber's powder was everywhere, and they all said in unison: "Crazy woman... aiyo, aiyo, it's killing me. I've followed you in the Great Yu for over a thousand years, and you... you damn bitch chop me like this! Aiyo, you damn bitch are really trying to kill me. Help, someone help, someone take this crazy woman away, I can't stay here anymore."

Wen Cai Chang ignored it coldly. She took the herbs and turned to leave. The black sea cucumber saw that its wailing was useless and felt it was pointless. It touched and merged, becoming one again.

It obediently crawled back into the medicine cabinet,缩在 (huddled in) the cabinet, and muttered: "Sullen woman, ignoring me. By the way, did that boy take it? Did he believe my slander and really go after that crazy woman, only to be killed by a sword? Alas, what a pity, what a pity. A handsome young man, it's all a matter of time and fate."

Wen Cai Chang was decocting the herbs. Seeing that the soup would take some time to be ready, her strength had already returned by two-tenths. Suddenly, she thought: "I remember that the scoundrel had some friends in Qingning County. Maybe there are clues?"

So she went to Qingning County and found the Wu Wei Tang (Martial Commandery).

She saw Luo Xia training the officers. Zhang Hou and Wang Wu were acting as her left and right hands. After months of suppressing bandits and killing murderers, they had honed an impressive aura.

But when they saw Wen Cai Chang arrive, their expressions changed. They all stopped their actions and cupped their fists, saying: "Madam!"

Wen Cai Chang nodded slightly, crossed the threshold, her beautiful eyes swept over everyone, and said softly: "Has Little Xian been here recently?"

Luo Xia felt as if she were sitting on pins and needles. She had heard some rumors and said truthfully: "He has never been here, Madam... I... we didn't know he... he would dare to betray you. It's really... really unexpected."

Wen Cai Chang walked slowly, leaving a fragrant breeze that teased the nose. She thought: "Li Lang is loyal and righteous, with a kind and easy-going nature. He wouldn't even want to牵连 (implicate) ordinary clay statues for no reason. It seems they really don't know any clues."

"Hmph! Since I'm here, you are Li Xian's life-and-death brothers. Don't blame me for venting my anger on you!"

She said softly: "All of you, follow me." No one dared to disobey, and they all followed her slowly.

Wen Cai Chang sat in the主位 (main seat) and said: "Li Xian betrayed my Yihe Manor and stole my secret treasures. You say you don't know his whereabouts, but I don't believe it."

Luo Xia was sweating profusely: "Madam, what do you want to do? None of us... none of us are your match. Please just give the order."

Wen Cai Chang frowned and said: "Miss Luo, from your tone, are you saying that I am unreasonable and use my power to oppress others?"

Luo Xia said: "Naturally... naturally not." But she thought: "If you aren't, then no one is."

Wen Cai Chang said: "I suspect Li Xian is hiding in your homes. Please prove your innocence."

Luo Xia understood: "This woman is here to find fault and vent her anger. Li Xian, oh Li Xian, what... what earth-shattering thing did you do to make the prestigious折剑夫人 (Madam Broken Sword) so angry with you?"

Luo Xia knew that no matter what she said, Wen Cai Chang would find fault to punish them, or even take all their lives. But she still carefully dealt with it: "That's simple. Please send someone to search our homes one by one."

Wen Cai Chang said: "Hmph! Since you dare to say that, you must have hidden him elsewhere."
