# Chapter 83: Passing Through  

Li Shiming was physically and mentally exhausted, falling into an unusually early sleep.  

In the midst of his slumber, he was abruptly awakened by the alarm from IBMz15. Checking the time, he realized there were only ten seconds left until midnight.  

Fortunately, IBMz15 didn’t require preparation time to play the "Great Compassion Mantra." As the chant echoed, the copper corpse inside the Corpse Storage Bag began to struggle and roar with its soul.  

Midnight was when yin energy was at its peak, and the copper corpse was in its most agitated state. Through the blood contract, Li Shiming sensed the corpse’s desperate attempts to break free, its soul bombarding his mind with waves of negative emotions.  

The ordeal didn’t last long. After the time it took to burn a stick of incense, the copper corpse quieted down.  

Listening to the "Great Compassion Mantra" for that duration didn’t disrupt Li Shiming’s sleep—instead, it improved its quality. He slept soundly until the next morning, waking up feeling refreshed.  

A servant disciple delivered spirit food to him. After eating, he headed to the first floor.  

Li Shiming had prepared several questions to ask Zhu Ji. Calculating Zhu Ji’s daily availability at the Qingqiu Pavilion and the fact that there were ten newcomers in total, he estimated he could ask no more than three questions per day.  

But when he reached the first floor, he was stunned.  

A crowd of youths had gathered—easily over a hundred.  

Li Shiming was confused. Weren’t the Spirit Root seedlings from the mortal regions of the Tianhai Sect gathered only once every five years during the Ascension Assembly? He and the other nine youths should have been the last surviving Spirit Root seedlings from those five years.  

So where had this crowd of over a hundred come from?  

"Senior Brother Zhu Ji, are these newcomers as well?" Li Shiming approached Zhu Ji, who was momentarily unoccupied.  

"These are children with Spirit Roots from the sect’s maritime territory. They’re also recruited every five years. Unlike mortals, the commoners here are descendants of cultivators, so the likelihood of Spirit Roots appearing is much higher. However, those with better Spirit Roots were already selected earlier. The remaining ones are mostly Quad-Spirit Roots or Penta-Spirit Roots."  

Zhu Ji, seeing it was Li Shiming, didn’t withhold his explanation.  

"The three-month newcomer period is a screening process—their last chance. Those who show sufficient potential will become official disciples, while the rest will become servant disciples."  

Li Shiming understood. This was a form of welfare. Regardless of their Spirit Roots, as long as they were born within the sect’s maritime territory, they could at least become servant disciples.  

As for why Penta-Spirit Root seedlings from the mortal world weren’t accepted, the sheer number of Spirit Root seedlings here made it clear—the sect’s servant disciple quota could be filled by those from the maritime region alone.

"I hope none of your batch is slower than them in reaching the first level of Qi Refining!" Zhu Ji shook his head.  

The newcomers in Li Shiming’s group, even if they had Quad-Spirit Roots, were still among the better ones, meeting the Tianhai Sect’s standards. If their cultivation progress lagged behind these newcomers with inferior Spirit Roots, it could only mean their attitude toward cultivation was lacking.  

Taking advantage of Zhu Ji’s free time, Li Shiming asked his questions about cultivation, and Zhu Ji patiently answered each one.  

Days passed. On the fourth day after entering the Qingqiu Pavilion, Jin Fengzhi became the first to form a spiritual energy vortex, reaching the first level of Qi Refining.  

In the following days, the rest of their batch followed suit.  

Li Shiming began to doubt his own talent again—but this time, he wondered if it was far better than he had thought.  

Even Jin Fengzhi, the fastest among their batch, had taken four days (three if excluding the first day spent selecting a cultivation technique) to form the spiritual energy vortex.  

Looking back, Li Shiming had achieved it in his very first attempt under far worse conditions.  

The spiritual energy gathered by the Spirit Gathering Plate in the mortal world was incomparable to the density in the Qingqiu Pavilion. Yet, he had formed the vortex immediately.  

He didn’t mention this to anyone—there was no need.  

Two newcomers from their batch still hadn’t formed their spiritual energy vortices.  

By the thirtieth day, some of the later newcomers had advanced to the first level of Qi Refining, followed by more in succession.  

It was clear that Spirit Roots had a significant impact on cultivation.  

Apart from those two, the rest of Li Shiming’s batch had all reached the first level within fifteen days. Meanwhile, the later newcomers with inferior Spirit Roots only began advancing after a month—the gap was already evident.  

Li Shiming paid no attention to others. Every morning, he sought Zhu Ji’s guidance, practiced the "Five Elements Absorption Art" and the "Diamond Body Protection Divine Technique," and spent the rest of his time refining the Blazing Flame Sword and the Green Kite Wooden Sword using the "Dotting the Eyes Art."  

The Blazing Flame Sword was a temporary weapon. Once he reached the fourth level of Qi Refining, he would barely qualify to use the Green Kite Wooden Sword.  

The copper corpse’s midnight struggles were no longer a problem for him.  

In fact, resisting the corpse’s backlash had noticeably strengthened his spirit.  

By the end of the newcomer period, he no longer needed the "Great Compassion Mantra" to withstand the copper corpse’s resistance at midnight.  

Of course, since his cultivation level was still insufficient, the copper corpse’s resistance to the blood contract persisted. This issue would only be resolved once he reached the fourth level of Qi Refining.  

Over the three months in the rich spiritual energy environment, though his major realm hadn’t advanced, he had progressed to the mid-to-late stage of the third level of Qi Refining. He estimated he would soon reach the late stage.  

The refinement of the Blazing Flame Sword had long been completed, but the Green Kite Wooden Sword was only halfway done—it would take at least another three months to fully refine.  

On the final day of the newcomer period, Zhu Ji stood at the front, facing the gathered youths.  

Li Shiming, Jin Fengzhi, and the other six from the first batch stood at the forefront. The remaining two from their batch stood at the back, among the eighty-plus who hadn’t reached the first level of Qi Refining.  

Li Shiming knew it wasn’t a matter of talent—Spirit Root testing didn’t make mistakes. Their problem was psychological.  

The sect provided a cultivation environment but didn’t address their mental barriers.  

Thus, despite having decent talent, they failed to reach even the first level of Qi Refining in the best possible conditions.  

Moreover, he saw the harsh reality of the cultivation world. Out of the hundred-plus newcomers in the second batch, over eighty still hadn’t reached the first level after three months.  

No wonder the sect had no interest in mortal seedlings with inferior Spirit Roots—Spirit Roots were simply too crucial.
