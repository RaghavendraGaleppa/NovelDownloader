# Chapter Two: Minor Auspice in the North – From Woodcutter to Dao Master

Green represents vitality, healing, longevity, and so on. Yellow signifies precious objects and noble individuals. He Shou Wu is a precious medicinal herb, said to extend life, which perfectly matches the green-with-gold aura.

Chu Jiang carefully dug out the He Shou Wu. Its root was oval-shaped and dark brown. He meticulously placed it into his bosom. After bowing towards the crape myrtle tree, Chu Jiang picked up his firewood and left.

As he made his way back down the mountain, Chu Jiang couldn't shake the feeling that something was off. He had been to the crape myrtle tree's location more than once, and many people from the town had visited it too. Yet, no one before him had ever discovered the He Shou Wu. If it had been found, it would have been picked long ago.

He couldn't help but glance back. That was the west. His Qi-gazing revealed a white aura mixed with black, indicating blades, bloodshed, and a great omen of misfortune. The black Qi was pure. If he were to head west, he would very likely be killed in the mountains! This 'blades and bloodshed' didn't only refer to military disasters; it could also mean other calamities: wild beasts, venomous snakes, or even dying from a fall, all fell under the category of bloodshed. Having already verified his Qi-gazing ability with the He Shou Wu, Chu Jiang had no intention of going west to court death.

He descended the mountain and walked along a small path, which suddenly opened up. The main road was wide, flanked by dense forests and overgrown weeds. As Chu Jiang carried his firewood, many hunters approached him.

“Brother Jiang, did you sleep in the mountains last night?” a sturdy young man with dark skin, carrying a knife and bow, walked up from behind. Behind him were four other people, all carrying bamboo baskets.

“Brother Jun,” Chu Jiang grinned. “Indeed, it was too dark last night, so I simply slept in the mountains. Were you all in the mountains last night too?”

The person who approached was Chu Jun, a hunter from the town. The four people beside him were his companions, forming a hunting party. Chu Jun was an honest and kind person. Chu Jiang had bought many hunted animals from him, and over time, they had become acquainted. Moreover, Chu Jun also loved fishing, and the two often went fishing together.

“Last night was so dark, we couldn't see anything, not even a speck of starlight or moonlight,” Chu Jun said. “The four of us got lost and couldn't find our way out at all, so we just slept in the mountains.”

Chu Jiang glanced at the bamboo baskets on their backs. They contained quite a few rabbits, pheasants, and a deer. This was a decent haul, enough for their expenses for a while.

“Want to go fishing later?” Chu Jun suggested.

“Sure, after I sell the firewood, I'll grab my fishing rod and go,” Chu Jiang replied. Minor Auspice in the North, should be in the water. Today is suitable for fishing!

The group chatted and laughed as they walked back. Along the way, more and more hunters emerged from the mountains. Last night had been truly too dark, so most had chosen to spend the night in the mountains.

“Has anyone seen San Lengzi?” a middle-aged hunter suddenly rushed up from behind, loudly asking the surrounding hunters.

Chu Jiang and the others looked back. It was Chu Dashan. San Lengzi was his nephew, Chu Sanxiong, nicknamed 'Chu Dadan' (Bold Chu) and 'San Lengzi'. He was extremely daring. Back then, no one had taken him into the mountains, yet he had gone in alone to hunt and even brought back a wolf.

“Uncle Dashan, what's wrong with San Lengzi?” Chu Jun asked from a distance.

“He's missing! Last night we got lost in the mountains, and this morning when we woke up, we couldn't find him. Have any of you seen him?” Chu Dashan asked anxiously.

“Haven't seen him,” the hunters shook their heads.

One hunter said, “Uncle Dashan, don't worry. Dadan is quite capable. He might have already gone home. You should go back and check.”

“Right, go home and check, go home and check,” Chu Dashan hurried back.

“Oh, right, Brother Jiang, you slept in the mountains last night. Did you hear anything?” Chu Jun suddenly asked.

“Sounds? What sounds?” Chu Jiang asked, puzzled. “I just slept nearby and woke up with the sunrise.”

“True, you don't go deep into the mountains,” Chu Jun chuckled, shaking his head, feeling he had asked the wrong person.

“What do you mean? Were there sounds in the mountains last night?” Chu Jiang pressed.

“A strange cry, somewhat like a 'great beast's' roar, yet not quite,” Chu Jun said. “I barely dared to sleep all night, only catching a few winks.”

“Us too,” the other four chimed in.

Chu Jiang shook his head. He truly hadn't heard anything. Perhaps the distance was too great? Seeing that he didn't know, the others didn't press further. As a woodcutter, Chu Jiang didn't need to know about matters deep within the mountains.

Chatting idly, they soon arrived at the town. Chu Jiang carried his firewood to Zhang's General Store. Zhang's General Store dealt in firewood and hunted goods. Every month, they would transport firewood and game via the Changmin River. One load of firewood weighed just about one 'shi' (approximately 100 catties). After weighing it, he received twenty copper coins.

Chu Jun's hunted goods were still being weighed. He said, “Brother Jiang, you go back and get your fishing rod. I'll dig up some earthworms and come find you later.”

“Alrighty.” Chu Jiang agreed and returned home.

His home was on the east side of Dongjiang Town: a small courtyard enclosed by a fence, with two earthen houses that his parents had built. He had inherited the property. He took out a small jar, placed the He Shou Wu inside, and hid it under his bed.

“Minor Auspice in the North. The north is exactly where the Changmin River flows. Could I be catching a big fish today?” Chu Jiang mused. He'd find out by trying. He only knew 'Minor Auspice in the North' meant it should be in the water, but the specifics were unclear. If he caught a big fish, he'd stew it with He Shou Wu to nourish his body.

He grabbed his fishing rod, brought a pouch of clean water, and picked up his fish basket before heading out. He hadn't walked many steps when Chu Jun arrived. He carried two fishing rods, a fish basket, and had already dug up the earthworms. Beside him was a young boy, Chu Yingcai, his younger brother.

“Yingcai's coming too?” Chu Jiang said with a smile. “First-time fishers usually have good luck.”

“This kid was idle at home and pestered me to bring him along, so I did,” Chu Jun said.

Chu Yingcai, also familiar with him, laughed, “Brother Jiang, today, watch me reel in a big one.”

“Alright, I'll wait for you to catch a big fish,” Chu Jiang chuckled heartily.

The three walked through the town, spending one copper coin halfway to buy two flatbreads for lunch. Leaving the town, they walked a few miles until they reached a tributary of the Changmin River. The water here was calm, perfect for fishing.

Many people had already claimed their spots. The usual good fishing spots were all taken. Chu Jiang scanned the area. The northern spots had a lot of weeds and trees, making it easy to get hooks snagged, not very suitable for fishing.

“There aren't many good spots left, let's just pick one,” Chu Jun said. “I'll take Yingcai up ahead to fish for some small fish.”

“No way, I want to catch something big!” Chu Yingcai grumbled. “They say first-time fishers have good luck, and you're trying to cut off my luck.”

Chu Jun patted his head. “Fine, clear a new spot. Just don't complain if your feet get pricked.” The riverbank was full of weeds and thorns. Since they wore straw sandals, getting their feet pricked was common.

Chu Jiang thought for a moment and decided to fish under the tree. If he was careful, he shouldn't get snagged. After all, his compass divination showed 'Minor Auspice in the North,' and he was at the northernmost spot, how could he possibly get snagged?

He broke off the nearby weeds, clearing out a fishing spot. He baited his hook with an earthworm and cast his line into the water. Chu Jun and his brother had also mostly cleared their spots. They fished together, not far from Chu Jiang, making it convenient to share earthworms.

Just as they cast their lines, Chu Jiang's bobber was dragged underwater. He immediately pulled up his rod. A palm-sized dace was reeled in by Chu Jiang.

“You got a fish!” Chu Yingcai said enviously.

“This dace is a bit big, not as tasty,” Chu Jiang said. “Smaller ones are better fried.”
