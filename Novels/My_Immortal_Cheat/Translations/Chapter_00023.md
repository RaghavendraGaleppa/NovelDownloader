## Chapter 23: Proclaimed to All Under Heaven!

Just as their carriage exited the Imperial City, an earth-shattering dragon roar erupted from the palace behind them. A golden divine dragon, tens of thousands of feet long, soared into the sky. Its body was thick, like a continuous mountain range, its scales gleamed golden, radiating precious light, each one the size of a millstone. It circled above the Imperial Palace. Looking closely, a brilliant golden light floated above the dragon's head – a scroll, outlined with golden silk cloth. Around it, various mysterious and wondrous phenomena appeared: a myriad of living beings, a holy era of humanity.

As the divine dragon circled, the scroll slowly unfurled, emitting immeasurable golden light. With a long cry, the dragon, tens of thousands of feet long, plunged into the scroll—which was still smaller than a single one of its scales—in an extremely strange posture. The phenomena emanating from the scroll became even more astonishing. Chanting sounds echoed, and every strand of golden silk cloth shimmered with vibrant light, filled with the sacred aura of humanity.

A faint, ethereal voice seemed to echo in Zhou Tian's ears. He shook his head, and the voice vanished, making him wonder if he had imagined it.

"Concentrate, and listen carefully!" Zhou Yi, beside him, said indifferently.

Zhou Tian paused, puzzled. What did he mean? Was it not his imagination? Nevertheless, he closed his eyes and listened intently to the voice from the void.

"...Today, We, the Emperor, have heard that the Haotian Sect has a maiden, Tian Ling, who possesses both talent and beauty, is respectful, refined, gentle, virtuous, gracefully soft, possesses clear virtue, righteous beauty, tranquil and dignified bearing, moves in harmony with jingling jade pendants, and is perfectly skilled in rites. As Qin King's Heir, Zhou Tian, has now reached adulthood, his character is noble, and his filial piety commendable, it is fitting that a worthy maiden be chosen as his consort. Since Tian Ling is still unwed, We hereby grant this marriage to the two of them, perfecting this beautiful union!

Proclaim this to all under heaven! Let all hear it!..."

It was an imperial decree of marriage! Zhou Tian opened his eyes, only to find the voice had vanished again. Yet, when he listened carefully, it still reverberated in the void, truly miraculous.

"This uses the 'Qi of Human Dao' to proclaim the imperial decree to every corner of our Tianqin realm. Only by listening carefully can one hear it, and it won't interfere with daily life. It will last for one day," Zhou Yi explained, seeing Zhou Tian's confusion.

So much advanced tech! Zhou Tian secretly marveled, this world truly isn't simple. And what about that 'gene technology'? He'd have to thoroughly investigate what that so-called 'Machina State, Land of Contraptions' was all about when he got back. He remembered very clearly that Emperor Qin had said the vial of reagent was sent by the ruler of the Machina State, Land of Contraptions.

The imperial decree floated silently above the Imperial City, radiant with golden light. With its promulgation, many places reacted differently.

On a remote mountain peak, a middle-aged man in a green robe stood. After hearing the imperial decree from the void, a complex expression flashed in his eyes, and a wisp of black qi flickered in his brow. A faint, ethereal voice whispered in his ear.

"'Tian Ling is so pitiful, sold to the Tianqin Dynasty by the master who raised her since childhood!'"

"'No! I did it for the Haotian Sect!'" Struggle flickered in the green-robed man's eyes.

"'Yes, yes, for the Haotian Sect, and also for his beloved master to survive for a little longer...'"

"'Enough!'" The green-robed man roared in anger, and with a sweep of his hand, unleashed a ten-thousand-foot-long sword qi. Azure light overflowed, the sea of clouds churned, and a hundred-zhang-wide chasm was cleaved open, splitting apart on both sides.

***

In a magnificent, resplendent palace, a large bed made of warm jade stood in the center, draped with a red, exquisite gauze curtain. Through the curtain, a beautiful woman could be seen lying on the bed, dressed provocatively, barely covering her vital areas. Her eyes were glazed, her face flushed, and she bit her lower lip. Listening to the imperial decree from the void, her entire body trembled uncontrollably. Finally, with a violent tremor, the beauty collapsed onto the bed, drops of an unknown liquid dripping from the corner of the quilt.

"'Emperor Qin's... voice... is still... so pleasing to the ear...'" The beauty on the bed, like a girl in love, had a sweet curve on her lips. After a while, she finally spoke.

"'Withdraw all arrangements targeting the Haotian Sect. Since Tian Ling is about to marry Zhou Tian, the Haotian Sect is now tangentially related to the Zhou family. Since it's related to the Zhou family, it's related to Emperor Qin. And since it's related to Emperor Qin, then it's related to me... mmph~...'"

Before she could finish, her delicate body was seized by another violent tremor...

"'Yes!'" The maid outside the bed acknowledged the order and withdrew, leaving only the gasping beauty on the bed.

While Zhou Tian was pondering this world, Tian Ling, nestled in his arms, also opened her eyes. In fact, she had woken up earlier but, feeling Zhou Tian pinching her cheek, she was too embarrassed to face him. Now that Zhou Tian was inexplicably spacing out, she quickly decided to get up and not let him take advantage of her anymore!

However, Tian Ling clearly underestimated Zhou Tian's shamelessness. Feeling a faint struggle in his arms, Zhou Tian snapped out of his daze, looked down, and saw that Tian Ling had already opened her eyes. He quickly said, "Ling'er, are you alright?" And casually tightened his embrace.

"I'm fine... are *you* alright?" Tian Ling's small face flushed. She subtly pushed away Zhou Tian's improper hand and asked in a low voice. The last thing she had seen before losing consciousness was Zhou Tian teleporting. Being an intelligent person, she guessed that her unconsciousness must have been caused by either Zhou Yi or Emperor Qin, which was why she asked if Zhou Tian was alright.

"Me? What could happen to me? Don't worry..." Zhou Tian replied, wrapping his arms around Tian Ling's shoulders and resting his chin gently on her head. This was his hidden ultimate killer move, far more effective than any 'wall slam' or 'bed slam'; it was guaranteed to make any girl swoon.

After her initial struggle, Tian Ling realized Zhou Tian had no intention of letting her go. She resigned herself to it; she had just heard the imperial decree, and she would be Zhou Tian's sooner or later. In that case, this didn't seem so bad. She leaned gently against Zhou Tian's chest, feeling his heartbeat. This posture gave her an indescribable sense of security.

The atmosphere was quiet and warm, except for Zhou Yi's occasionally twitching mouth, which somewhat ruined it.

'Who did I offend to have to witness this?'

***

The journey back to the Qin King's Estate was silent. As soon as Zhou Yi returned to the Qin King's Estate, he disappeared, adhering to the principle of 'out of sight, out of mind' when it came to the two of them.

Holding Tian Ling's small hand, Zhou Tian escorted her all the way to Clover Garden. After two days of Zhou Tian's attentive coaxing, she no longer resisted such intimate gestures.

"Ling'er, do you really have to participate in that 'Youth Competition'?" Zhou Tian asked at the entrance of Clover Garden. Tian Ling had told him a few days ago that she intended to participate in the so-called Youth Competition. There was nothing inherently wrong with participating in the Youth Competition. The key issue was that she would have to enter secluded cultivation for a period, meaning she couldn't accompany him. This was quite frustrating; their sweet, blossoming relationship was about to be cut short before it even truly began.
