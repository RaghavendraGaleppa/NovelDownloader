## Chapter 3: The Dilapidated Temple

Chen Fei searched the two men, finding only some copper coins. Fine rain began to fall from the sky. Chen Fei glanced at his surroundings, then ran southeast.

Night fell. In a dilapidated temple, a faint aroma of roasting meat permeated the air, accompanied by intermittent chatter.

Rumor had it that an immortal once appeared on Pingyin Mountain, capable of overturning rivers and seas, omnipotent. Later, an immortal temple was built on Pingyin Mountain, but it wasn't particularly efficacious. After only a few years, it fell into complete disrepair, becoming a temporary shelter for those spending the night on Pingyin Mountain.

Chen Fei carefully turned the rabbit meat on the branch. He had been lucky enough to catch a rabbit. At that moment, several medical hall apprentices chatted amongst themselves, their gazes occasionally darting towards the rabbit meat, their eyes filled with longing. The medical hall's meals didn't include meat. To eat meat, they had to buy it themselves. But with an apprentice's wages, they couldn't even taste meat once a month.

"Knock, knock, knock!"

A knocking sound echoed. One of the apprentices went to open the door. Cold wind swept in. Chen Fei subconsciously glanced outside, his eyes narrowing slightly before he withdrew his gaze.

"Great, rabbit meat! I'm starving," Qi Chun exclaimed delightedly upon seeing the roasted rabbit.

"Just you? I thought the others were with you too," the apprentice who opened the door peered outside, puzzled.

"I don't know either," Qi Chun shook his head, sat on the ground, and stared at the nearly cooked rabbit meat.

Chen Fei remained silent, his gaze fixed on Qi Chun's neck. There was no sign of normal flesh there.

"Everyone, run!"

Chen Fei roared. Before leaving, he used his woodsman's knife to snatch the money pouch from Qi Chun's waist, then dashed out of the dilapidated temple without looking back.

"Hehehe!"

A sinister laugh echoed through the temple. The other apprentices, as if waking from a dream, stared at the headless figure that had stood up by itself. They instantly understood something and all fled the temple in terror.

Chen Fei's expression was grim. He hadn't expected to truly encounter a malevolent entity on Pingyin Mountain. Fortunately, his breakthrough to the Skin-Refining Realm earlier that day had given him some sensitivity to such eerie presences. Otherwise, if he had stayed in the temple, who knew what might have happened.

Now, the most important thing was to return to Pingyin County overnight. Strange occurrences rarely happened in Pingyin County town, rumored to be because the county yamen possessed a treasure that suppressed them. Chen Fei didn't know if this was true, but at present, he only wanted to return quickly to be safer.

"Chen Fei, my neck hurts so much! Your blade cut me so badly!"

A faint, eerie voice came from behind. Chen Fei's expression immediately changed. Wasn't it said that after cultivating martial arts, with vigorous qi and blood, the eerie beings would first pursue those with weaker qi and blood? How could it have caught up so quickly? Unless the other apprentices were all dead?

Qi Chun's voice sounded directly behind Chen Fei's ear, as if pressed against his back, even the expelled breath could be felt.

Chen Fei's face changed, and he punched backwards. The various mysteries of the Extreme Mountain Fist flowed through his mind, and the temperature of Chen Fei's fist rapidly rose.

"Bang!"

With a dull thud, Qi Chun shrieked. The spot on his chest where he had been struck was now charred black.

"It works!"

Chen Fei's eyes lit up slightly. He stopped fleeing, gripped his woodsman's knife, and charged back towards Qi Chun.

After mastering the Extreme Mountain Fist, Chen Fei had a rough understanding of how to use qi and blood. He now infused it into his woodsman's knife. With a few slashes, Qi Chun's limbs were directly severed.

"How can you be so strong?!"

Qi Chun shrieked agonizingly, but Chen Fei's expression remained unmoved as he continuously swung his knife.
