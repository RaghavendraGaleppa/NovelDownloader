# Chapter 280: Astonishing Skill, Beautiful Eyes Glancing, Winning the Grand Prize, and Bountiful Harvest

Nangong Liuli’s beautiful eyes looked over and saw Li Xian stepping onto the stage for the duel. She was instantly overjoyed. Among the many Flower Cage Bandits, she always found Li Xian the most pleasing to the eye.

She couldn't help but worry inwardly. She stared intently, wanting to shout words of encouragement, like "Beat these Flower Cage Sect villains to death for me!" However, restricted by the "Flowing Glances of the Rainbow Skirt," her entire body was stiff and rigid, not daring to move in the slightest. The words reached her lips but were changed to silent muttering in her heart.

Li Xian cupped his hands forward. His opponent was over thirty years old, dressed in luxurious clothes, wearing a token at his waist, and was named "Du Tiechang."

They stared at each other for a moment, exchanging empty pleasantries. In the next instant, they both made their moves. Li Xian avoided the锋芒, parrying and countering several moves in a heated exchange. He probed Du Tiechang’s background and secretly determined that defeating him would not be difficult.

Du Tiechang saw that they were fighting back and forth. Seeing Li Xian’s youthful face, he marveled that one so young could possess such skill, which was truly extraordinary. He took three steps forward, pushing his palms out rapidly. The attack was fierce and swift, like a stormy sea. This was the opening stance of the "Stabilizing Wave Palm." The Stabilizing Wave Palm was thick and heavy; when executed, the mind must be calm and steady. Du Tiechang was preparing for a long battle.

Li Xian sidestepped and countered with three punches. The path of the fists was cunning and strange, mimicking the soaring of a flying snake, adding the wonder of the "Four Directions Fist" where the force lines suddenly change. *Bang, bang, bang*—three punches landed on Du Tiechang’s left shoulder, lower abdomen, and chest. Li Xian’s internal Qi was both condensed and surging. His physical strength was both fierce and refined.

Years of tempering had made it extremely formidable.

Du Tiechang was immediately sent flying backward, tumbling off the擂台. He could no longer resist. Lifting his clothes, he saw three indented, bruised marks on his shoulder, lower abdomen, and chest, with condensed internal Qi lingering. He had hastily used the "Body Unification Technique" to protect his body, but it couldn't withstand it in the slightest. He looked at Li Xian in disbelief.

Nangong Liuli cheered: "Good! Good... Ouch... It's so itchy." She almost stood up, but her acupoints were restrained. The Yongquan acupoints on her soles, the acupoints on her back, and the acupoints on her ribs felt itchy and numb.

Furious to the extreme, she dared not move recklessly. Her eyes immediately welled up with tears. She thought that in this state, anyone could bully her.

Shi Yufei nodded secretly, paying a little attention. Ye Cheng and Meng Han glanced over slightly but didn't care much. The Flower Cage Sect engaged in banditry; its members lived frivolously and neglected their martial arts cultivation.

They were unskilled in the four arts of the zither, chess, calligraphy, and painting.

Organizing the grand meeting, they naturally kept it simple, setting up a擂台 for combat, with the victor being respected.

Li Xian won his first match and retreated to the shade of a tree. He leaped up and lay横跨 on a tree branch. Watching the battles in the field, he thought:

"The Flower Cage Sect is a mixed bag, but there are indeed extremely formidable opponents. I should try to hide my strength and not show off, attracting attention. But when it's time to use it, I shouldn't hold back."

And so it went.

After several more matches, he defeated his opponents with basic martial arts, winning consecutively, yet no one seemed to notice him. Only Shi Yufei frowned slightly and looked at him a few more times.

Nangong Liuli was naturally happy to see him win continuously. But seeing him win so ordinarily, as if relying entirely on a set of exquisite fist techniques, she couldn't help but worry secretly. If he encountered a strong opponent, wouldn't he fall instantly?

Flower Cage Sect disciples were spread throughout the world, but those who could gather at the Water Altar were less than one in a hundred. This was because the Water Altar’s entrance and exit were secret, and the disciples were scattered far and wide, unlike ordinary sects.

The battles grew increasingly intense. About half an hour later, Li Xian stepped onto the擂台 again. His opponent was a woman named "Zeng Xiaoke." She was a fellow senior sister of the "Qu Xiaoyou" he had encountered earlier.

This woman was extremely skilled at using poison, having tempered a pair of毒掌. When she struck, she released a thick poisonous mist, dark black mixed with a faint purple. It spread out, extremely potent.

Her cultivation was at the Food Essence realm. Over the years, she had tempered her毒掌. Through several battles, her opponents had all died under her palms. Now, she was striking for the kill.

Her vicious methods, combined with her beautiful appearance and female identity, drew the attention of all the spectators.

The onlookers sighed and exclaimed:

"This kid is done for, encountering Zeng Xiaoke... Her毒掌, even a brush of a fraction of it carries the danger of death."

"We need to wait for Ding Zelin, Wolf Blade... such figures to deal with her毒掌."

"Her move 'Gathering Mist to Lock the Smoke' envelops her entire body; opponents find it hard to get close. Don't mention ordinary disciples, even a strong martial artist of the Second Realm, without a specific counter, would have to look on helplessly, with no way to deal with it."

If Li Xian had "Three Flowers Overhead, Pure Breath from the Mouth," he could easily blow the poison mist away. But he dodged several palms, retreating repeatedly, never硬接. When Zeng Xiaoke grew impatient, he suddenly spat out a blood mist.

The blood mist contacted the poison, and the blood immediately turned black and turbid, breeding foul and ugly bugs. This showed that the poison invaded the bloodstream; if touched even slightly, the blood would be corrupted and useless.

Li Xian was surprised: "This poison mist contains both poison and tiny eggs. Upon contact with blood, the poison stimulates the eggs, which hatch instantly and suck the blood dry."

His gaze was sharp. He saw that under Zeng Xiaoke’s fingernails, she nurtured four mother bugs. Each time she struck a palm, the mother bugs secretly spat out eggs. This set of palm techniques was called the "Ten Thousand Poisons Palm" and the "Moth Killing Claw."

These two martial arts complemented each other. Even if the opponent dared not fight硬拼, the eggs floating in the air would turn into moths to attack. Then, the sky would be full of poisonous moths, scattering poisonous fluff... how terrifying.

Zeng Xiaoke was extremely proud. She had used this combination of "Ten Thousand Poisons Palm" and "Moth Killing Claw" to capture and kill a famous beautiful heroine within Huaiyin Prefecture. If that heroine had fallen into the hands of other Flower Cage Sect members, she might have survived. But being captured and killed by her was truly tragic, with her body难以保全, all turned into nourishment for the poisonous moths.

Ye Cheng’s expression changed slightly: "The poison of the Poison Flower Taoist is becoming more and more potent. She really should discipline her disciples. With such attacks, who can survive?"

Meng Han laughed: "Our Flower Cage Sect is not some righteous sect. Once on the擂台, death and injury are inevitable."

Liu Yu shook his head: "That may be true... but if you use this move later to capture flowers, wouldn't it be a great waste?"

Zeng Xiaoke suddenly震 chest drum. The poison mist trembled, and the eggs were gradually stirred up. Then, poisonous moths mixed with poisonous gas would spread across the entire area. How could Li Xian survive? The disciples watching nearby would also be affected.

Nangong Liuli frowned anxiously, so worried she wanted to stomp her feet. But her jade shoes concealed fine needles; walking would stimulate the Yongquan acupoint, causing extreme itchiness. If she stomped, it would pull on the needles, causing self-inflicted suffering. She could only rub her toes slightly, focusing her eyes on the changes in the field.

Suddenly, she saw Li Xian spit out blood mist again. The onlookers thought he was driven to a dead end, resisting in his last moments, repeating his old trick. Zeng Xiaoke sneered twice, pushing her palm force, and the poison mist surged forward.

Li Xian raised his hand and震 his chest. The blood mist became even thicker, almost obscuring the sky and sun. Shi Yufei, Ye Cheng, Meng Han... were all slightly startled. Surprised by Li Xian’s abundant blood energy, they all shook their heads slightly. Poison mist克制 blood mist; trying to overpower it with sheer quantity was futile.

Suddenly, the blood mist became scorching hot, and with a *hum*, it ignited into a blazing black fire. The fierce black fire swept through the poison mist, burning all the poison and eggs instantly. Zeng Xiaoke’s face filled with shock. The flames had already reached her face, burning her so badly she rolled around miserably. She was immediately defeated.

Ding Zelin, Wang Changjiang, Wolf Blade, Bao Zixian... all looked over, feeling extremely shocked. They secretly pondered countermeasures and began to guard against Li Xian.

They all thought: "I noticed this小子 earlier when he kept winning. I didn't think he had much ability, but this battle... him spitting blood mist and turning it into blood fire is truly surprising. If I encounter him in the future, I must be wary of this strange technique!"

Li Xian made a stunning debut and could no longer remain low-key. He remained calm and composed, hiding his strength to build momentum. When he unsheathed his sword, he revealed his锋芒. Honor and disgrace did not startle him; coming and going, he was at ease. Shi Yufei nodded secretly; this young man truly met his approval.

Zeng Xiaoke’s skin was burned and ruined, rolling on the ground, extremely miserable. Li Xian swept a cold glance over, completely indifferent. Meng Han said: "Why aren't you helping her away to treat her injuries?"

"Quick... quickly apply my Qiongxiang Yulu Ointment to her. Oh dear... such a fine skin."

Two disciples beside him immediately obeyed the order. They carried Zeng Xiaoke off the擂台 and began to treat her injuries.

Ye Cheng frowned: "Old Meng, are you trying to pursue the Poison Flower Taoist? You scoundrel, you never lift a finger without profit. Why are you being so attentive?"

Meng Han laughed: "I cherish talent. Oh dear, look... such a fine girl, ruined like this, it's so pitiful."

He said to Shi Yufei: "Chief Envoy... I'll step away for a moment to help look after the junior's injuries."

Shi Yufei stroked his beard: "It's rare for you to have this intention, go ahead."

Nangong Liuli was delighted: "This little thief really held back. Good! He is clearly very strong, but he deliberately hid his strength earlier, making me worry for nothing."

She gradually felt hopeful.

It was noon. The scorching sun hung high, hot and humid. The disciples watching sought the shade of trees to cool off, and the grand meeting’s battles were nearing the end.

The remaining matches could be counted on one hand, making them even more intense. Even Ding Zelin, Wolf Blade, Wang Changjiang, Bao Zixian, and others had to spend energy and手段 to win.

He defeated strong enemies consecutively. The Flower Cage Sect disciples were all discussing, talking about Li Xian. The name "Hua Wu Cuo" (Flower No Mistake) immediately spread throughout the Water Altar; everyone knew a dark horse had appeared at the grand meeting.

This match...

Li Xian faced Wolf Blade. Bao Zixian, Wang Changjiang, and Ding Zelin all stared intently. Wolf Blade was short and stocky, looking at Li Xian solemnly, secretly raising his internal Qi, carefully on guard.

The two exchanged pleasantries. Then, they used basic martial arts to probe each other's background. Flower Cage Sect disciples were not擅长 single combat, but each was cunning as a fox. Wolf Blade used the "Blowing Smoke Palm" to attack and kill. Li Xian used the "Flying Snake Hand" to counter.

The Blowing Smoke Palm excels in its ethereal lightness. Wolf Blade was secretly happy to see Li Xian use the "Flying Snake Hand." Based solely on the characteristics of the martial arts, the Blowing Smoke Palm slightly surpassed the Flying Snake Hand.

Li Xian pondered: "Even with a thousand jun of strength, I shouldn't use it all in one place. I should be cautious and see your style." He executed three moves of "Soaring Snake Leaping."

Wolf Blade hurriedly retreated. The advantage of the Blowing Smoke Palm lies here; the palm technique is ethereal like smoke, able to retreat and attack, be aggressive, or disappear without a trace. The "Flying Snake Hand" is fierce and precise, cunning and fierce... it greatly tests the martial artist's control of timing. If encountering the "Blowing Smoke Palm," with its elusive and mysterious moves, its flaws are naturally revealed.

After exchanging several moves like this, Wolf Blade used the mystery of the Blowing Smoke Palm to flash to Li Xian's left side. He struck three palms rapidly. The palm Qi was very heavy, but it gave the illusion of "blowing smoke to caress the face," not worth blocking.

Li Xian used the move "Reaching for Clouds and Taking Mist" from the "Soaring Cloud Hand." He lightly grabbed Wolf Blade's wrist. With a slight exertion, a *crack* was heard. Wolf Blade let out a miserable cry.

He thought his strength was not weak, but he felt Li Xian's hands were like giant pincers cast from玄 iron, hiding immense power. Wolf Blade was at the Second Realm of martial arts, his bones tempered to be extremely tough.

This was why they didn't shatter completely. But the cracks in his wrist bones were dense, and the pain was imaginable. Wolf Blade desperately wanted to break free. But he felt his internal Qi was far inferior, and his pure physical strength was even more a thousand miles apart.

He was secretly terrified: "In my Flower Cage Sect... where did such a monster come from? What is this terrifying strength for?" Amidst his screams, he faintly let out a wolf's howl.

Li Xian suddenly let go. Wolf Blade immediately fled. His wrist was dark, having suffered a heavy blow. Long wolf-like needles grew from his护腕. This was the "Wolf Gang Technique."

This Wolf Gang Technique was a strange protective skill, training the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" to be like a wolf's howl. This was internal Qi condensed like wolf fur, able to刺出 the flesh and protect the whole body.

If Li Xian had let go a moment later, his palm would have been pierced by the wolf fur. He was both shocked and delighted. The world has infinite strange techniques, showing endless wonder. He had a natural liking for strange and eccentric things; every time he increased his knowledge, he felt extremely satisfied.

Ding Zelin, Wang Changjiang, and Bao Zixian heard about the dangerous fight just now. They all felt extremely危急 and secretly hoped Wolf Blade would win. Seeing Li Xian's young and handsome face, they suddenly felt a faint sense of压迫.

Meng Han had already left his seat. He偷看 this way and muttered: "This家伙 is so arrogant, he really does have some strength!"

Li Xian laughed: "Come again!" Boosting his morale. Wolf Blade took a long knife from his back and bit it horizontally in his mouth. His whole body lay almost flat on the ground.

This made it extremely difficult to move, almost like throwing himself into the net, exposing his weakness. But his abdomen stretched and contracted, moving at an astonishing speed. He moved quickly like a snake.

This move was both strange and fierce. Imagine an ordinary martial artist fighting someone. The moves used assume the opponent is in front, behind, beside, or overhead... it's hard to imagine the opponent crawling on the ground.

Even if there are moves to deal with enemies on the ground, there are only a few, and they are never studied in depth, wasting time. Although Wolf Blade has "Wolf" in his name, it was chosen deliberately.

In martial arts moves, "Wolf" often implies fierce, swift... meanings. And Wolf Blade's earlier "Blowing Smoke Palm" had no trace of "fierce" or "swift." It took a阴柔 path, killing the enemy unprepared.

He abandoned his hands and feet,靠 belly to the ground. The martial art for fast movement was called "Ground Snake Breathing Technique." This martial art was neither lightness skill nor footwork. It was a "nurturing and healing" martial art.

It aimed to lie on the ground, feel the rhythm of the earth, regulate the body through breathing, alleviate exhaustion, and even allow one to lie静卧 like a snake for months without needing any external food or drink.

However, during practice, Wolf Blade discovered that his abdomen was soft, and its stretching and contraction far exceeded others, possessing the "Water Belly Phase" of the Transformed Body Phase. After cultivating the "Ground Snake Breathing Technique" to perfection, he suddenly found he could move like a snake, at great speed.

Based on this characteristic, he devised a ground-based sword technique called "Earth as Water, Belly as Boat, Hands and Feet as Rudders, Mouth Holding Sword," specifically attacking the opponent's lower body.

His speed was extremely fast. During snake breathing, his abdomen stretched and contracted, and in an instant, he killed his way to Li Xian's front. The mouth-sword slashed at Li Xian's ankle. Li Xian lifted his foot to avoid it. He slapped the ground with his hand, his body spinning and flipping up. The mouth-sword spun with him, slashing at Li Xian's neck, upper arm...

This move was invincible. When others saw him use this set of martial arts, in their surprise, they would surely assume he would continue to attack the lower body, so they would严防 their feet. Who knew that his next move, following the body rotation, would make the mouth-sword attack the opponent's upper body from a刁钻 angle, from bottom to top.

An ordinary martial artist encountering this move would, at best, have their hands severed, or at worst, be beheaded on the spot. Li Xian leaned back his body and dodged again.

Wolf Blade moved his belly to pass through Li Xian's crotch. With this move, Li Xian's lower body would be lost. Even if he didn't die, he would have lifelong regrets. Li Xian thought: "Good... this set of martial arts is really vicious. This person is indeed not weak..."

He stepped on the Star Step and turned to avoid it. Wolf Blade felt this young man was厉害; several strange attacks were all easily dodged. He was about to use his hidden card when he suddenly felt the ground tremble violently.

He saw Li Xian step on the ground, and the immense force透进 the ground. It actually lifted Wolf Blade into the air. His "Ground Snake Breathing Technique" relied entirely on his belly贴地 moving. Whether rolling or横移, his movements were unpredictable. Martial arts masters could predict the angle, force, and position of the next move from the opponent's footwork changes. But him swimming on the ground was completely out of reason. He used this move to often maneuver and wander, coming and going easily.

But when he left the ground and was震飞, he suddenly lost his hands and feet, losing his movement power instantly. He didn't expect his proud move to be破解 like this.

Terrified, he hurriedly回手 to block. But he saw Li Xian kick him in the face, sending him flying off the擂台, rolling another five zhang, and hitting a tree trunk. The trunk shook violently, and those hiding from the sun and seeking shade beside the tree fled in all directions.

Suddenly, it was quiet.

Ding Zelin, Wang Changjiang, Bao Zixian... looked at each other, all extremely shocked. The battle just now seemed back and forth, but Li Xian had actually won by a margin.

"This Wolf Blade's strange martial art, if used on me, would be very difficult to resolve. This young man... is truly a great enemy of this trip!"

Nangong Liuli clapped her hands: "Good! Oh dear..." Seeing Li Xian so strong, defeating another strong enemy, she was extremely happy.

Suddenly, her pretty face turned red: "Nangong Liuli, Nangong Liuli. This little thief Hua wins, and you are so happy. Are you rushing to deliver yourself to his mouth?"

Shi Yufei was secretly satisfied. His eyes were sharp, guessing that Li Xian hadn't used his full strength. His strength naturally surpassed Wolf Blade, and thus surpassed Ding Zelin... and the others. Flower Cage Sect martial arts are light and graceful, lingering... accustomed to winning by巧取 and围攻.

He was just missing a disciple who was fierce and direct, capable of standing alone. He thought: "I'll test his skills and see how厉害 he is." He said to Deputy Envoy Yan Hao: "In my opinion, in this battle, this young man will surely win."

Yan Hao said: "I don't think it's necessarily so. Ding Zelin and the others are also not bad. Martial arts restrain each other. Victory and defeat are common matters. This..." He didn't know Li Xian's name.

Ye Cheng laughed: "Hua Wu Cuo."

Yan Hao said: "This Hua Wu Cuo defeated Wolf Blade, it was indeed because martial arts restrained each other. It's not certain he can defeat Ding Zelin, Bao Zixian, and Wang Changjiang."

Shi Yufei pondered secretly. What Yan Hao said was reasonable, but his own eyes were sharp and rarely wrong. Moreover, Yan Hao was精通 five elements and eight trigrams, geomancy... but far inferior to him in martial arts combat.

Shi Yufei said: "Let's do this... let's change the rules of the competition. Let Hua Wu Cuo stand on the擂台, and the others can challenge him freely."

Ye Cheng said: "Chief Envoy... isn't this a bit too unfair? Hua Wu Cuo will be attacked consecutively; his Qi and strength won't last, and he will surely lose."

Shi Yufei said: "I remember there are three prizes for this grand meeting, right? A beautiful wife, merit money, and treasures... these three sets of rewards were originally for the top three."

"Like this... if he can defend the擂台 for half an incense stick's time, he can choose one of the three prizes first. If he can defend the擂台, then all three prizes will be his."

Ye Cheng was slightly surprised,一时弄不清 Shi Yufei was intentionally nurturing Li Xian or specifically targeting him. Since the rules were set, the others had no objections.

The rules changed. Li Xian stood on the擂台, and others challenged. Nangong Liuli heard this news, her pretty face turned pale, furious at the Flower Cage Sect villains. She saw Li Xian defeat Wolf Blade, guessing that in single combat and擂台 fighting, his chance of victory was at least sixty percent.

Defending and attacking the擂台 were different. When the Nangong family held banquets, they would also organize擂台 attacks and defense. It was very intense; the defender would be围攻. The family banquet was like this; the Flower Cage Sect grand meeting would surely be even more dangerous.

Li Xian defended the擂台. Ding Zelin, Bao Zixian, Wang Changjiang watched like tigers,默契攻擂, attacking together.

The three had different martial arts styles. Ding Zelin's attacks were阴柔 and swift, Wang Changjiang was擅长 ethereal fairy sounds... every move contained the wonder of fairy sounds, making ordinary moves no longer ordinary. Bao Zixian had a solid foundation, a tall and big physique, following the fierce and hard-training path. But when fighting, although his physique was strong, his moves were still迂回, daring not to fight directly.

He lacked Li Xian's sharpness.

The three attacked simultaneously, their ferocity unprecedented. Nangong Liuli secretly broke into a cold sweat. Li Xian's eyes darted, his vision pushed to the limit. He看清 the details of the three's moves and迅速 made counterattacks.

In this instant... facing three alone, he showed no sign of defeat. After several exchanges, Bao Zixian's expression changed greatly, vaguely experiencing Wolf Blade's feeling. This young man's moves seemed light, but all contained heavy and immense power.

He had trained his physique fiercely; after taking several punches, his arms felt numb. The more he fought, the more terrified he became. Li Xian successively used "Four Directions Fist," "Breeze Leg," "Vast Leg"... martial arts, all at an extremely high level, natural and flawless.

Moving among the three, he showed elegance and ethereality. His posture was fully displayed, giving a feeling of elegance and handsomeness. In single combat earlier, Li Xian won easily. Even with Wolf Blade, there was only slight anxiety, not fully showing his style.

Now surrounded by three. The three were anxious, fighting fiercely. Li Xian gracefully resolved it. The contrast highlighted his extraordinary nature.

Nangong Liuli's eyes shone with wonder, murmuring: "This little thief Hua is actually this厉害."

This time, his skill astonished the whole field. Li Xian remained calm, neither joyful nor excited. Every move had been practiced tens of thousands of times; he struck with ease. The three broke out in cold sweat. Suddenly, their footwork changed, and they默契摆设 the "Triangle Snake Belly Formation."

This formation was powerful. If formed, it could defeat a strong opponent with weak strength. Li Xian had anticipated this and had been guarding against it.借 the moment the three set up the formation, he immediately struck迅猛, concentrating his force to attack one.

Bao Zixian was closest to him. He was the first to be threatened by the fist light. His footwork suddenly became chaotic. He hurriedly used the "Copper Body One Qi Technique" to block. His whole body's martial arts showed异象, as if wrapped in a copper bell.

Li Xian's fist light struck, and with a *dong long* sound, the copper bell was震响 by immense force. Seeing he had blocked this move, Bao Zixian's face filled with wild joy. Li Xian condensed his breath and震, using the "Iron Copper Body." A dark light radiated from his whole body.

The Chest Drum Thunder Sound drummed like thunder. The third killing finger of the "Gang Thunder Finger," the 'Startling Thunder Finger,' was added to the fist intent. His fist light added even more surging killing势. The fist Qi震 the copper bell.

Bao Zixian was包裹 by the thunder sound,震 inside his body. The "Copper Body One Qi Technique" was broken, and he was heavily砸飞.

Ding Zelin and Wang Changjiang wanted to form the formation. The formation was未成, and they had already lost one. Their morale was gone; they had already completely lost. Li Xian spat out blood mist. Ding Zelin and Wang Changjiang both fled left and right, fearing the blood fire would cover their faces.

Li Xian stepped on the Seven Star Step, his speed extremely fast. He caught up to the two and defeated them one after another.

At this time, the incense had not burned halfway.

All the onlookers were horrified. Thinking it over, he had won even faster than when he fought Wolf Blade alone.

Nangong Liuli's beautiful eyes glanced around, her gaze rippling.
