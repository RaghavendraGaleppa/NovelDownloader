# Chapter 65: Slaying a True Qi Master! Buried Together in Fengdu Mountain!

The sword light arrived in an instant—razor-sharp!  

In that fleeting moment, Li Zhengjing activated the *Windshadow Movement Technique*!  

He narrowly avoided the strike, his heart filled with relief. Realizing his shortcomings in combat, he had specifically spent his merit points to acquire this movement technique. Had he not done so, the consequences of facing a True Qi Realm expert's sword strike would have been unthinkable!  

*"You've only been a disciple for a little over a month, yet your cultivation progress is astonishingly fast. And you still found time to learn a movement technique? Your talent truly is peerless!"*  

A hoarse voice echoed as the sword light adjusted its trajectory and struck again!  

At the same moment, a blazing inferno surged from the side—Guabinuo, now at the peak of the Inner Qi Realm, had unleashed its innate *Divine Fire*!  

The White Phoenix’s innate fire ability was indeed formidable. Even a True Qi Realm expert dared not let the flames touch him. The attacker halted abruptly and retreated.  

Li Zhengjing steadied himself, drawing the *Dragon-Patterned Evil-Suppressing Saber*, and said coldly, *"It's you!"*  

The black-robed, masked figure chuckled. *"You figured it out quickly. Not bad."*  

*"Obviously!"* Li Zhengjing snapped.  

Before arriving at Twin-Nine City, he had no enemies here. The only person who held a grudge against him was Elder Chen Xuan—the very man who had been punished and exiled to this desolate place because of him!  

Taking a deep breath, Li Zhengjing said, *"If I die, you’ll be the prime suspect. Aren’t you afraid of the consequences?"*  

Elder Chen Xuan extended his True Qi outward, pointing his sword at Li Zhengjing.  

*"I am old. Had I stayed in the sect, I might still have had a future!"*  

*"But because of you, I was sent here for twenty years! My path of cultivation is severed—no hope of reaching the Human Immortal Realm!"*  

*"For a cultivator, having one’s path cut off is worse than death!"*  

With a slash of his sword, a blade of True Qi shot forth, aiming for Li Zhengjing’s neck!  

This was the difference between the True Qi Realm and the Inner Qi Realm!  

An Inner Qi cultivator could strengthen their body and enhance their physical power, but in battle, they were still limited to close combat.  

A True Qi expert, however, could project their energy—killing from a distance!  

Chen Xuan’s True Qi could form sword beams or spells, allowing him to fight Li Zhengjing from several feet away.  

By shielding himself with True Qi, he prevented Li Zhengjing from closing the distance. No matter how strong Li Zhengjing’s body or how sharp his saber, they couldn’t touch him!  

In this battle, Chen Xuan was practically invincible!  

*"Li Zhengjing, you can’t even get close to me!"*  

*"You think killing the Venom King Xin Xuan makes you invincible?"*  

*"Back in Four-Leaf City, if not for the threat of the Divine King Gu and the swarm of insects, Xin Xuan wouldn’t have lasted thirty breaths against me!"*  

*"Today, I’ll show you the difference between a True Qi expert from a proper sect and a mere Southern Wasteland poison master!"*  

Chen Xuan charged forward, but Guabinuo swooped down, spewing flames!  

Unfazed, Chen Xuan raised his left hand, conjuring a chilling light to counter the fire.  

*"This green bird has impressive bloodline abilities, but it’s still just a peak Inner Qi beast—not enough to kill me!"*  

His *Frozen Heart Palm* from the Inner Qi Realm had evolved into the *Polar Soul Frostlight* in the True Qi Realm.  

Normally, fire-based techniques countered frost, but with his superior cultivation, Chen Xuan suppressed Guabinuo’s flames, sending the bird tumbling away!  

At the same time, his sword pierced through the air, striking Li Zhengjing’s heart!  

Li Zhengjing was sent flying, crashing through a wall and buried under rubble—silent.  

*"Pathetic!"*  

Chen Xuan sneered. *"The northern Yin energy often sweeps through Twin-Nine City, claiming lives. I’ll just summon it to erase all evidence!"*  

Sheathing his sword, he turned to finish off the strange bird, confident Li Zhengjing was already dead.  

But as he turned, his peripheral vision caught movement—a hand emerging from the rubble!  

His pupils shrank.  

**BOOM!**  

A burst of fire and sword intent erupted from the rubble, fusing into a single devastating strike!  

*"Damn it!"*  

This attack was far stronger than Guabinuo’s flames—and it came when his guard was down!  

He barely had time to raise a True Qi barrier before the fiery sword beam shattered it!  

Chen Xuan desperately swung his sword and unleashed *Polar Soul Frostlight*, but it was too late!  

The attack struck him head-on!  

When the flames dissipated, Chen Xuan lay charred and broken, barely alive.  

*"Did you really think you could kill me?"*  

Li Zhengjing pushed himself up, brushing dust off the mirror embedded in his chest. *"Feigning weakness to strike back—this was taught in the outer sect. Seems you’ve forgotten, Elder."*  

He had two protective mirrors—one on his back, given by the sect before his mission, and one on his chest, a high-grade treasure gifted by Elder Gu.  

Chen Xuan’s sword strike hadn’t pierced it.  

And that gave Li Zhengjing his opening.  

*"You… have a divine ability?"* Chen Xuan’s eyes widened in disbelief. Now he understood how Li Zhengjing had slain Xin Xuan.  

*"Surprised?"* Li Zhengjing grinned, raising his saber. *"Just like you, I don’t need to fight up close."*  

Truthfully, with his *Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique*, *Great Void Sword Qi*, and his left arm’s divine ability, he could have fought Chen Xuan head-on.  

But he had hidden his strength—waiting for the perfect moment to ensure a decisive kill.  

If he had revealed his *Flameblade Sword* too soon, Chen Xuan might have fled, becoming a future threat.  

Now, with the elder crippled, Li Zhengjing stepped forward, ready to behead him.  

But in that instant—  

Darkness swallowed everything.  

Li Zhengjing’s instincts screamed danger, but his saber still swung down.  

Warm liquid splashed onto him—blood.  

He had struck Chen Xuan.  

He swung again—but hit nothing.  

Chen Xuan was gone.  

*"Master, retreat!"* Guabinuo shrieked from above.  

Too late.  

The darkness had already consumed the entire courtyard—even the airborne Guabinuo was trapped within.  

*"I meant to use this to summon the northern Yin energy… to erase your corpse."*  

Chen Xuan’s weak voice echoed, filled with malice. *"Now, we’ll all be buried together in Fengdu Mountain!"*  

**SWISH!**  

Li Zhengjing slashed toward the voice.  

Something heavy hit the ground—likely Chen Xuan’s head.  

But in the suffocating darkness, he couldn’t see.  

A bone-chilling cold seeped into his body from all directions.
