Chapter 15: Brotherhood and a Talisman of Peace

The second and third brothers, Wang Chun and Zhuo Yilie, were both Class D guards. Their monthly earnings were around two hundred coins each: a base salary of one hundred and fifty coins, plus an attendance bonus of several dozen coins.

"It's Jiang Yun!"

Suddenly, the crowd erupted in noise. Zhao Han looked around and saw a tall woman approaching from a distance.

She had a delicate face, an arrogant brow, and her long hair was tied into a high ponytail. As her gaze swept over Li Xian and the other laborers, she let out a disdainful "Hmph," revealing her haughty nature.

"Who is Jiang Yun?"

Watching Jiang Yun walk away, Li Xian asked.

Zhao Han explained, "She's a Class B guard. This woman has always looked down on men. Her 'Jade-Carving Leg Technique' is extremely formidable. Fourth Brother, if you see her in the future, it's best to steer clear. Don't provoke her."

Wang Chun added, "I heard she has some background. She's distantly related to Qiuyue, Madam's personal maid."

"Second Brother, Third Brother, Fourth Brother, let's go closer and listen. Let's see how much she earns," Zhao Han said, unable to hide his curiosity.

Li Xian didn't really care about this matter, but he went along with them. They turned back and eavesdropped outside the accounting office.

"Jiang Yun, Class B laborer. Monthly earnings: six hundred coins, plus one Bear Blood Pill."

"There's a Bear Blood Pill this month? Thank you, Sir, for the reward."

"If you want to thank someone, thank the Madam. Everything in the manor, from top to bottom, belongs to the Madam, including you and me."

The sound of a conversation drifted out from inside the accounting office.

Li Xian was secretly astonished.

His buyout price was only five hundred and twenty-five coins. It didn't even match her monthly earnings.

"Big Brother, what is a Bear Blood Pill?" Li Xian asked.

"A Bear Blood Pill... now that's a good thing," Zhao Han smacked his lips, full of envy. "It's a precious pill that increases physical strength. Our daily, bitter training probably can't compare to the effect of a single pill."

Wang Chun said, "Big Brother, you should work harder and become a Class B guard yourself. Then you might get a chance to taste a Bear Blood Pill."

"That's right. Even without a Bear Blood Pill, a Class B guard can get some Deer Blood Pills every month as a minimum," Zhuo Yilie agreed.

"Hard, hard, it's too hard!" Zhao Han let out a long sigh.

Yet, a light flickered in his eyes. He truly coveted the position of Class B guard. If the chance arose, he wouldn't mind giving it a shot.

After collecting their pay, on the way back, Zhao Han and the other two were all off duty today, a rare occasion for them to be together.

Li Xian asked the question on his mind: "We're in the manor, and we have our earnings, but where can we spend them?"

"You can go to the Miao Dan Pavilion to exchange for pills. The effect of one pill can replace several days' worth of food."

"You need to know that the most important part of martial arts training isn't practice, but eating. If you eat well, your physique and strength will improve, allowing you to achieve greater heights in martial arts."

Zhao Han said with a teasing smile, "Of course, you can also ask for leave and go to the nearby Qingning County for a stroll. There are plenty of places to spend money. As long as you return on time."

Li Xian's heart stirred: "How do I ask for leave?"

"Just tell Commander Pang. What is it, Fourth Brother, want to go out for a walk?" Zhao Han nudged Li Xian with his elbow, his expression teasing.

Li Xian nodded: "Indeed."

"Alright then, since all four of us brothers are free today, why don't we all ask for leave and take a trip to Qingning County together?"

"We've been training for so long, it's time to find someone to vent our fire. Otherwise, it'll burn a hole in our bodies, haha."

Zhao Han spoke with great enthusiasm. Wang Chun and Zhuo Yilie both agreed. Having received their money, they eagerly anticipated going out to have some fun.

Li Xian wore a smile, but in his heart, he wasn't thinking about venting his fire. He was thinking that he hadn't seen his younger brother in a long time. With the academic exam approaching, he shouldn't be overworking himself.

As for asking for leave, Zhao Han was an old hand at it and quickly handled everything properly.

The four of them left the manor entrance, followed the mountain path, and arrived in Qingning County.

"I heard that in this county, there are several wealthy gentlemen with immense fortunes."

"By the way, if a rich young lady in this county took a liking to one of you and was willing to spend real gold and silver to buy your freedom, would you be willing or not?"

The third brother, Zhuo Yilie, suddenly had a strange thought.

"Willing or not..." Zhao Han laughed. "It depends on how the young lady looks. If she's as beautiful as a celestial maiden, then of course, I'd be more than willing."

"If she's ugly, then forget it."

"Big Brother, if she's not ugly, she wouldn't look at us four brothers anyway."

"Oh? So, Second Brother, you're willing?"

"I'll grit my teeth and endure it. I won't fall out with money."

"When my Wang Chun has money and makes it big, I'll wave my hand generously and get each of us four brothers a mansion, and keep a few charming beauties."

"As for me, I'll have to sacrifice myself to the demon. If I don't go to hell, who will?"

"Second Brother... I didn't expect you to have such a broad mind."

The four of them walked side by side, chatting about everything under the sun, the atmosphere extremely harmonious.

Passing by an alley, Li Xian said, "Big Brother, Second Brother, Third Brother, you guys go ahead. I won't be going to the pleasure house."

"Fourth Brother, you..." Zhao Han said in surprise.

"My younger brother is home alone. It's rare for me to get out, so I have to go see him," Li Xian said with a smile.

"Alright." Zhao Han waved his hand, saying nothing more. This Fourth Brother had always been a lone wolf.

It was approaching noon. Thinking of his younger brother, Li Xian couldn't help but quicken his steps.

His younger brother was sensible from a young age, clever and innocent. After their father committed suicide, Li Xian, as the elder brother, took on the responsibility of caring for his younger brother. The bond between brothers was deeper than anything else.

Broken Vase Alley.

In front of a shabby thatched hut, Li Xian called out loudly, "Ah-Fan, Ah-Fan!"

After three calls, a惊喜 voice came from inside the house, "Brother, is that you, Brother?"

A small, thin figure ran out急急. He was wearing a tattered hemp robe left by his father. The small body couldn't support the large garment. His hair was disheveled and his face was dirty, but his eyes were very bright.

The moment Li Xiaofan saw Li Xian, his eyes welled up with tears. He ran over and hugged his big brother tightly. Li Xian felt a deep ache in his heart.

His younger brother was still so young, living alone in a thatched hut in this cannibalistic, chaotic world. Li Xian worried that his clothes might be snatched, his copper coins stolen, and that he might be bullied. Seeing that his younger brother was safe on this return, he finally put his mind at ease.

"Safe and sound, that's good, really good," Li Xian sighed.

"Brother, you've gotten so much more handsome!" Li Xiaofan said with admiration, his eyes shining.

"Of course, your brother is no ordinary person," Li Xian laughed. "Once your brother has money, we won't be bullied anymore."

"Brother, I know you've become a laborer, you must have suffered a lot. I... I prayed for a Talisman of Peace for you to carry," Li Xiaofan said, pulling out a yellow paper talisman folded into a triangle.

"You went to the Empress Temple?" Li Xian was taken aback. "That's more than twenty li from here."

"I went to buy books and stopped by to pray for the talisman on the way," Li Xiaofan said with a smile.

"You little rascal, trying to fool your brother, you're still too young," Li Xian gently tapped Li Xiaofan on the head, his tiger-like eyes a little moist.

"Brother, I'm not stupid. In this world, it's just the two of us against the world. You joined the Yi He Manor. A while ago, I heard that many laborers in the manor have worked themselves to death."

"I was so worried I couldn't sleep. The only thing I could do was pray for a Talisman of Peace for you," Li Xiaofan said.

"Your brother is a guard now, not as bitter as a laborer," Li Xian gently stroked Li Xiaofan's head. "Don't do such a silly thing again in the future."

"Hehe, maybe it was the Talisman of Peace that worked," Li Xiaofan said with a cheeky grin.

A look of determination flashed in his eyes: "This winter's exam, I won't let my big brother down!"
