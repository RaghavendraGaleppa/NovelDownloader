Chapter 136: A Vicious Heart, the Tragic Fate of the Leopard Blade

Li Xian rode a steed at the forefront. Behind him was the carriage carrying the Madam, followed by a pitch-black coffin.

After entering the city gates, the citizens rarely saw such a handsome and elegant figure. Hearing the sound of hooves, many turned their heads to look.

Someone shouted, "It's Li Dalang! Li Dalang has entered the city!"

A commotion ensued. The citizens gathered along the street, curiously observing, their mouths filled with words of praise:

"So this is Li Dalang? He is truly as young and handsome as the legends say."

"What a divine Li Dalang, he is like an immortal descending to the mortal world."

"No wonder he could take the enemy general's head and suppress ten thousand soldiers. His aura is indeed different from that of ordinary people."

"To catch a glimpse of such a figure is a blessing in itself."

Li Xian now realized his reputation was considerable. It was understandable for the citizens to seek entertainment, but the Madam's thoughts were unpredictable. If she were to become displeased, it would be inevitable that a few innocent lives would be lost. He glanced back at the carriage.

Seeing that the Madam made no comment, Li Xian felt slightly relieved. He cupped his fists toward the citizens and said, "Elders and fellow townsfolk, I have official business to attend to. Please make way."

The crowd parted to both sides. Their eyes were all fixed on Li Xian, completely ignoring the conspicuous coffin behind him.

The surroundings were noisy, but Madam Wen did not dislike it. If one were not admired by others, wouldn't that mean one was mediocre?

After passing through several main streets, Li Xian saw the crowd growing even larger. Helplessly, he cupped his fists again and said, "Everyone, please return to your homes. It would be best if you did not spectate what happens next."

He was humble and polite, yet不失 domineering. His shout was neither too loud nor too soft, but it was just enough to make the citizens obey, and they gradually dispersed.

After one more street, they arrived before the gates of the Leopard Blade Sect.

The vermilion gates were tightly shut.

Xu Liefeng believed he had left no loopholes and absolutely no flaws. However, it was hard to avoid a guilty conscience, so the Leopard Blade Sect had been closed to visitors for the past few days.

The disciples inside had heard the commotion from the bustling street, but no one came out to investigate.

Li Xian dismounted and hammered on the gate with force. The sound was powerful, echoing into the.

A disciple of the Leopard Blade Sect was about to open the gate when Li Xian kicked it. The vermilion gate was sent flying several yards away, and he walked straight into the courtyard. The knocking was a show of courtesy first; the kick was the prelude to force.

In an instant, disciples of the Leopard Blade Sect surrounded him, wielding sabers, spears, clubs, and staves of all kinds. Xu Liefeng's fourth disciple, Yang Tong, shouted, "Li Xian, how dare you! My master spared your life last time, and you dare to show your face again!"

Another disciple said, "Don't think you're so powerful. I'm telling you, taking the enemy general's head amidst ten thousand soldiers was just luck on your part. If my master wanted to, he could do it too!"

"Exactly! You dare to kick our gate now? Are you asking for death!"

The disciples of the Leopard Blade Sect raised their voices in unison. They had heard had had had had had had had had had had... drowned They had...................... drowned...... drowned drowned.......... drowned............ drowned................. drowned drowned...................... drowned drown er.... drowned drowned..

.

.... He was both fearful and furious.

Li Xian leaped over the heads of the crowd, landing outside the gate beside the carriage. "Madam, I have coaxed Xu Liefeng out. Please descend from the carriage."

 Xu Liefeng's face turned from pale to white, his teeth stuttertered. " "…夫人…夫人… I… I have never offended the Madam… If I unintentionally…不知…何处冒犯夫人，还…还请夫人，看…看在先…先辈交情上…给…给我一个…改…改过机会."

Madam Wen said, "Li Xian, you explain."

Li Xian said, "Master Xu, since you don't remember, let me help you recall. A few days ago, you secretly met with a general of the Yellow Dragon Army, used a borrowed knife to kill, and led the Yellow Dragon Army toward the One Unity Manor."

"This matter, you shouldn't have forgotten, right?"

Xu Liefeng's heart went cold. He desperately denied it. "Nonsense! Li Xian, you brat! I merely had some conflict with you, and you slander me like this! How venomous of you!"

"Madam, please investigate clearly. I have always admired you. How could I do such a thing? And what benefit would I gain from this? Madam, please don't believe this man's slander!"

Li Xian laughed. "Naturally, you coveted the Madam's martial arts. You used the Yellow Dragon Army to drive the Madam away. It wouldn't be difficult for you to seize some of the treasures and martial arts from the manor amidst the chaos, would it?"

"Nonsense!" Xu Liefeng roared. "Li Xian, I'll duel you!" His inner energy surged, and he struck a palm toward Li Xian.

The palm was powerful and incredibly fast. However, the Madam caught it with two fingers and gently twisted. Xu Liefeng's whole body trembled, and blood slowly seeped from every pore, large and small.

His life force slowly drained away.

Madam Wen asked, "Do you have anything else to say?"

Xu Liefeng dared not fight anymore, filled with immense terror. With that gentle twist of the Madam's two fingers, she had shattered all the blood vessels in his body. Blood was filling his flesh, but if he took a great medicine now, combined with techniques to solidify blood and close pores, and the vigorous life force he had after being reborn, he could still survive.

Between the brink of death and life, a powerful will to survive erupted.

Xu Liefeng begged, "Madam, his words are all baseless, you cannot believe him! Evidence… Yes… Ask this man to produce evidence! If he can produce evidence, I will submit willingly. Even if you kill me, Madam, I will not frown."

"Evidence?" Madam Wen laughed. "A joke. When has this Madam ever needed to present evidence when I suspect someone?"

Her palm turned over虚翻. She drew in seven leaves. With a gentle flick of her fingers, a leaf flew out and severed Xu Liefeng's right hand.

Another flick…

Leaves fluttered, and his right leg was severed.

Xu Liefeng wailed and pleaded, "Madam, spare me, spare me…"

Madam Wen flicked again, and Xu Liefeng's right eye was gouged out.

Xu Liefeng said, "Madam, you cannot kill me! You promised the Xu family! You cannot break that promise!"

Hearing this, Madam Wen truly stopped, tossing the leaves in her palm away.

"Since there is an agreement, I will not kill you," Madam Wen said, looking at Li Xian. "You will kill him for me."

"I have already severed one hand, one leg, and one eye. First, bury the残肢 in the coffin. This coffin will be placed outside the gate, and no one may move it."

"One month from now, you will come to kill him. Let him be buried in the black coffin with his body whole."
