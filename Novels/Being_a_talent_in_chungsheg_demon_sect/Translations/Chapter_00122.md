# Chapter 122: One Palm!

At this moment, the entire Earth-Traversing Boat was almost completely scrapped.

Rolling demonic qi obscured the sky, and Buddhist dharma was in decline. Even the mere clash of their auras was like two majestic mountains colliding, emitting thunderous roars.

"...Benefactor, what exquisite means."

With the appearance of Su Nü, "Guanghai"'s expression became incredibly solemn. He clearly no longer dared to view Lu Yang as a mere Qi Refinement cultivator he could easily manipulate.

Logically speaking, external intervention from Foundation Establishment cultivators was not permitted in Dao Contention battles. The fact that he could display such power was entirely due to a unique trick of the Pure Land. Strictly speaking, he was not the Subduing Dragon Arhat; he was "Guanghai." He had merely temporarily borrowed the arhat's status from the Pure Land. The reason he could borrow it was that Guanghai was originally a disciple of the [Subduing Dragon Temple].

Pure Land cultivation was about enlightenment, realizing that one's self was a part of the World-Honored One. "I" am the World-Honored One, and the World-Honored One is "I"—Brahman and self become one to achieve the Great Dao. However, this step was not achieved overnight. It required a gradual process. For disciples like Guanghai, it was impossible to realize "I" am the World-Honored One; the gap in realms was too vast. His enlightenment was "I" am "Subduing Dragon Arhat." This was true for disciples in countless Pure Land temples and Zen forests: first, they enlightened to the "self" of their temple's master, and only then did they enlighten to the self of the World-Honored One.

Such a cultivation method could be called bizarre. Especially their utilization of Qi Refinement disciples, which was no less potent than the Sacred Sect's. If not for this, the Pure Land would not have been called the Heretical Pure Land Sect back then. Nevertheless, it was undeniable that this cultivation method indeed provided many conveniences for junior disciples. Because essentially it was still "Guanghai," not true external power, its use in a Dao Contention battle was unexceptionable. It was Guanghai's greatest trump card.

However, what Guanghai found hard to accept was that he had risked losing himself just to barely borrow a portion of the Subduing Dragon Arhat's status. What was going on with this demon in front of him? Why did he have a complete Foundation Establishment True Person!? What kind of price had he paid? Could it be that he paid nothing at all?

Looking at Lu Yang's relaxed expression, Guanghai's lips trembled slightly, feeling a surge of wrath. In an instant, boundless fierce winds swirled into existence.

Seeing this, Lu Yang immediately sneered, "Impatience?"

Boom!

Before his words even fell, Guanghai lifted his foot forward. With his step, the earth shook and mountains swayed, and Buddhist light poured forth, instantly piercing through the black clouds formed by the demonic qi above. With just this one step forward, Guanghai's aura suddenly soared. As his lips parted, a thunderous, boundless Buddhist sound erupted: "Should I achieve Buddhahood, if my light has limits, failing to illuminate even a hundred thousand myriad nayutas of Buddha-lands, then I would not attain supreme perfect enlightenment!"

In an instant, Buddhist light illuminated everything. What met the eye was only an immeasurable light, piercing through the sky, golden and magnificent, dazzling and brilliant, extending infinitely both upwards and downwards, with no end in sight.

The Boundless Light Great Incantation! The boundless light generated by this Great Incantation was said to illuminate all demonic obstacles in the world, and it was the most powerful Great Incantation Guanghai possessed. What was referred to as "demonic obstacles" was not truly about good or evil, or righteousness versus evil, but rather self-determination. Anyone considered a "demon" by oneself fell within its scope of influence.

"Today, this humble monk shall eliminate demons, uphold the Dao, and propagate the true Dharma!"

Guanghai appeared with a solemn and majestic demeanor, and the boundless divine light in his hand immediately cascaded downwards, sweeping towards Lu Yang with a majestic force, as if the heavens were falling! Wherever it passed, large swathes of demonic qi were ignited, burning into nothingness. Even Su Nü showed some discomfort; clearly, this Great Incantation had a very poor compatibility with her. While it wouldn't harm her, she couldn't remain completely unscathed. As for the Sacred Sect's true disciples in the distance, their faces all turned pale, showing grave expressions. This was because even from a great distance, that immeasurable light still made them feel a scorching heat, a divine ability powerful enough to severely wound them!

However, seeing this, Lu Yang burst into laughter: "Eliminate demons and uphold the Dao?" Immediately after, he curved his lips into a smirk, his face full of mockery: "Calling me a demon... Very well, today we shall see who is the true demon!"

As his words fell, Lu Yang clasped his hands together. Swish swish—! Behind him, the Myriad Spirit Banner unfurled, and Patriarch Ting You quietly appeared, sighing, "It cost me some effort, but I've finally managed to complete most of it..."

The next second, figures appeared behind Patriarch Ting You. Without exception, these were all Buddhist cultivators who had previously died by Lu Yang's hand and then been collected into his Myriad Spirit Banner. Even at this very moment, Buddhist cultivators who had fallen in battle outside were continuously being added. Immediately, these Buddhist cultivators all pressed their palms together in unison. "Amitabha!" The Buddhist chant was vast and uniform, surprisingly also unleashing a boundless Buddhist light that blessed Lu Yang, converging into an illusory Buddha statue!

A combined attack technique of Buddhist cultivators! Patriarch Ting You had actually managed to comprehend a method to apply the Pure Land techniques to the [Yama's Palace], using a large number of Buddhist cultivator banner spirits to replace earth veins!

"Now I lack nothing!"

As his words fell, Su Nü descended, entering Lu Yang's body. The boost from her peak state also made the Buddha statue behind Lu Yang grow even more solid.

Saint's Plunder! Previously, when Lu Yang circulated this cultivation method, he would condense a "Saint's Aspect." However, at this moment, this "Saint's Aspect" had transformed into the appearance of a Buddha! All at once, the demonic qi vanished completely, replaced by pure Buddhist light covering the sky and earth. It was even grander than the boundless light Guanghai unleashed with all his might, so much so that when that boundless light fell upon the "Buddha Aspect," it couldn't even cause the slightest ripple on its golden body, like a gentle breeze passing over it!

"Since you have seen the true Buddha, why do you not bow?"

The Buddhist sound was like a thunderclap in the ears, containing Lu Yang's spiritual sense, which was comparable to Foundation Establishment. It rattled Guanghai as if he were dreaming, his mind momentarily swaying: "How, how could this be? Buddha? A true Buddha?"

The next second, the mountain-sized golden Buddha smiled slightly, a compassionate smile: "Demon, repent to your Buddha."

As his words fell, Lu Yang raised his palm. And the "Buddha Aspect" behind him simultaneously raised its hand, slowly descending. Violent spiritual energy burned and exploded in its palm, transforming into boiling, flowing fire. As the palm descended, the heavens brightened immensely!

At this very moment, not just Guanghai, but all the Buddhist cultivators on the battlefield couldn't help but show devout expressions, clasping their hands and softly chanting: "Amitabha..."

Boom!

After a colossal sound, everything returned to peace. Only a colossal palm print remained on the spot. All the Buddhist cultivators had turned to ashes, and hundreds of souls, without a fixed abode, floated into the Myriad Spirit Banner. On the palm print, the Sacred Sect disciples who hadn't been affected stood dumbfounded, staring at the huge palm-print crater beneath their feet, unable to regain their senses for a long time. At the edge of the palm print, Guangming, who had luckily escaped death for the third time due to his entanglement with Qin Tianhe, felt his legs go weak and immediately fell to his knees.

Almost simultaneously, beyond the Boundary Heaven. "...Slanderer of Buddha!"

The True Monarch from the Pure Land suddenly stood up, his face extremely grim, for he had clearly sensed that his fruit-position treasure had shattered. Lu Yang's single palm strike had nearly annihilated all Buddhist cultivators! The very few who weren't killed were because Guanghai had acted earlier, and some Buddhist cultivators had been left behind, not arriving in time. Yet even so, the remaining Buddhist cultivators were no longer a force to be reckoned with and could only be slaughtered at will. In other words, in this Dao Contention battle, the Pure Land had already been eliminated! How could the Pure Land True Monarch, who had prepared so many methods beforehand and placed such high hopes on this battle, accept this?

On the other side, True Monarch Pure Snow, however, had a look of concern: "Bodhisattva, don't be anxious."

"Why bother with anger and rage, losing your demeanor for nothing?"

"Victory and defeat are common in warfare. Look at my Sacred Sect; although we haven't lost a single Dao Contention battle recently, even if we were to lose, we would absolutely not get angry."

As soon as these words were uttered, the Pure Land True Monarch became even more enraged. If it were any other Sacred Sect True Monarch, it might have been fine, but who didn't know that True Monarch Pure Snow was a famous madwoman of the Sacred Sect, with a history of misconduct! When you lost a Dao Contention battle, you would simply turn hostile and refuse to admit defeat! Now you're trying to advise me? You beast!
