# Chapter 141: The Might of the Greatsword

[Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art, Second Level: 85/2000]

After completing a day's cultivation, Chu Ning glanced at his Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art proficiency. It had increased by 2 points. At the same time, Chu Ning could feel that one of the hundred drops of divine consciousness liquid in his Niwan Palace had grown stronger.

"Analyzing the Rune Source can indeed strengthen divine consciousness!" Chu Ning rejoiced inwardly.

For the next two days, Chu Ning continued his cultivation while waiting for Cheng Jinhe to recruit the necessary people. He cultivated the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art to temper his mana and practiced his divine consciousness while analyzing the Rune Source. Even in this mortal world, in a place where spiritual energy was sparse, his cultivation wasn't too affected.

Midway, Cheng Jinhe and his group would proactively call him to join them for every meal. He didn't have to worry about food, lodging, or daily necessities.

Three days passed in this manner. On the morning of the third day, Chu Ning was continuing to analyze the Sword Sealing Talisman when a knock suddenly sounded on his door, followed by a voice from outside.

"Young Hero Chu, the patron asks you to pack your belongings and meet in the inn's backyard. We're about to set off."

Have they recruited enough people? Hearing this, Chu Ning immediately rose, grabbed his greatsword, slung his beast-hide bag over his shoulder, and headed out.

Outside the door, one of Cheng Jinhe's assistants, whom Chu Ning had seen before, was smiling at him. "Young Hero Chu, the patron has found the people. We're setting off now."

"Alright, let's go." Chu Ning descended the stairs with the assistant, somewhat surprised. "Yesterday, your patron looked so troubled about this long journey, and today he's already found people?"

"Yes, a few people arrived yesterday afternoon and today, and that completed the group."

As they spoke, the two arrived at the inn's backyard. At this moment, besides Cheng Jinhe and the short-bearded man named Li Song, there were over thirty other people in the backyard. Most were dressed as assistants, currently loading boxes onto carriages. Another six or seven people were dressed as escorts, like Li Song. These must be Cheng Jinhe's original guards. There were also five others dressed differently. It seemed they were the additional guards hired for the escort.

Everyone couldn't help but size each other up. Li Song then began introducing them to one another.

"This is Young Hero Chu Ping…"

Through Li Song's introduction, Chu Ning got to know the four men and one woman.

The oldest was a medium-built, grey-clad man in his forties named Yu Zhengchun. He was a man of few words and carried a sheathless blade. There were two other men who looked two or three years younger. One was slender like a monkey, with a long whip hanging from his waist, named Dai Zuen. The other was tall and burly, carrying a large bronze hammer in one hand, named Han Wangang. The only woman among the five was around thirty, dressed in a tight-fitting outfit. Her appearance was plain, but she had a certain fullness to her figure. She carried a long sword and was named Du Huarong. The last person, a young man around twenty-six or seven, was named Shen Shaohai. He was dressed like a scholar and carried a fan. Chu Ning only glanced at it and noticed that the fan contained something strange; it was likely a hidden weapon.

After introductions were made, Li Song immediately called out to everyone, "The patron's buyer is waiting, so we'll depart directly. We'll be troubling everyone along the way."

Cheng Jinhe also quickly added, "I'll be troubling all the brave individuals on this journey. As long as we can reach our destination safely, this Cheng promises a generous reward."

As they exchanged pleasantries, the assistants finished loading most of the boxes. Li Song then had the inn's waiter bring out several horses. From their appearance, they were indeed fine horses. Chu Ning took the reins from a waiter but didn't immediately mount, choosing to observe the others first. He remained on the ground until everyone else had mounted their horses.

Seeing this, Shen Shaohai, who held the iron fan, couldn't help but ask with a smile, "Brother Chu, why aren't you mounting your horse? Don't tell me you can't ride a horse."

Chu Ning smiled, then flipped agilely onto the horse's back. He hadn't ridden a horse before, but as a cultivator, his body had been cleansed by spiritual energy, and he also practiced body tempering. His control over his body was naturally far beyond that of ordinary mortal martial artists. He had learned how to mount and ride simply by watching the others.

"Good skill!" Shen Shaohai praised.

"You flatter me, Brother Shen," Chu Ning said humbly.

Li Song then assigned positions to everyone. Chu Ning, Shen Shaohai, and Han Wangang, the one with the large hammer, were assigned to the very front of the convoy, along with two of their own guards. Li Song himself, along with the remaining hired individuals, rode on the flanks of the convoy. At the very rear were all of their own guards. Among them was a man named Yao Rong, who wore two daggers at his waist and looked very capable. He was a leader among the guards, similar to Li Song, serving as the deputy leader.

The group departed from the North Gate of Yuhua City. As they had just set out, the atmosphere was quite relaxed. After traveling for a while, Shen Shaohai proactively spoke to Chu Ning, "Brother Chu, you look a year or two younger than me. May I ask which sect you hail from, to be adventuring alone at such a young age?"

Chu Ning shook his head. "I have no sect. I merely stumbled upon some rudimentary techniques by chance; they wouldn't be worth mentioning to you, Brother Shen."

"I doubt that," Han Wangang interjected from the side. He was burly, and his voice was gruff. "Brother, that greatsword of yours isn't a weapon just anyone can wield."

Chu Ning's expression remained calm, and he smiled. "I just happen to have a good deal of strength and not much else, so I use a heavy sword to make myself look impressive."

"Having strength is good!" Han Wangang laughed heartily. "Old Han here relies entirely on strength. Brother Chu, how about we spar when we rest?"

Chu Ning quickly waved his hand. "No, no, Brother Han, I wouldn't be able to handle two blows from your hammers." Hearing Chu Ning's words, Han Wangang casually lifted his large hammer and laughed, a hint of pride on his face.

As they chatted, Shen Shaohai sought Chu Ning out for conversation several more times, subtly probing his background. Chu Ning smoothly parried his questions, giving away nothing. After a few attempts, Shen Shaohai gave up. However, he continued to chat with Chu Ning and Han Wangang occasionally throughout the journey, acting very familiar. The three of them together made for a livelier group than the quieter people behind them.

After traveling for most of the day, the woman, Du Huarong, rode her horse to the front. Han Wangang, seeing Du Huarong approach, let out a chuckle. "Sister Du, you specifically came all the way to the front. Are you interested in old Han here? Or perhaps these two young lads?"

"Pah!" Du Huarong playfully spat at him, then smiled sweetly. "I was just getting rather bored at the back, so I came to chat with these two young brothers. You crude fellow, I wouldn't be interested in you."

"Don't just look at the face," Han Wangang chuckled again. "There are plenty of people who are all show and no substance." After saying this, he seemed to realize something and gave an embarrassed smile to Chu Ning and Shen Shaohai. "My apologies, brothers, I wasn't referring to you two…"

With Du Huarong's addition, the atmosphere became even more jovial.

In a flash, the convoy had traveled for nearly a month. This month wasn't entirely peaceful; they encountered two or three groups of petty thieves along the way. However, most were dealt with cleanly by the existing guards. Among the newly hired, only the battle-eager Han Wangang had impulsively made a move once. The others hadn't done much. This was also something Li Song had already agreed upon: minor bandits didn't require their intervention. They were only needed when the numbers were large or the situation was tricky.

This evening, the convoy arrived at a place called Emerald Plateau. Since the nearest village or town was still more than half a day's journey away, they had to find a relatively open spot in the wilderness to rest.

After everyone settled down, Cheng Jinhe and Li Song approached Chu Ning and the others. As a patron, Cheng Jinhe was indeed quite good. Although he rode in a carriage throughout the journey, he would always join everyone whenever they paused. He would also personally help with chores like distributing rations and cooking. He was always polite to both his assistants and the recruited martial artists like Chu Ning. Whenever they reached a larger settlement, he would treat everyone to good wine and food. It was truly a case of "harmony brings wealth."

At this moment, Boss Cheng was distributing dry rations to each of them. "Tonight, I must trouble you brave individuals to camp out in the wilderness. I also ask everyone to keep a close watch throughout the night. When we reach the town tomorrow, I'll prepare excellent wine and dishes."

As soon as Cheng Jinhe finished speaking, the more impulsive Han Wangang immediately said in a gruff voice, "Boss Cheng, you're too polite. We've eaten and drunk well all this way. What's wrong with a little hardship for one night? We are all rough folk; sleeping here is no trouble at all." Chu Ning and the others didn't speak, but their expressions were similar.

Cheng Jinhe naturally expressed his gratitude. At this point, Li Song spoke in a deep voice, "Everyone, tonight we'll have to trouble you to take turns on watch for the first and second halves of the night. There's a notorious group of horse bandits active nearby, so we must be careful."

Saying this, he divided them into groups. Chu Ning and the others who were at the front, along with Li Song, were assigned to the first half of the night's watch. The rest were assigned to the second half. No one had any objections. After eating their dry rations, those not on watch lay down to sleep, and the entire camp gradually quieted down.

The people on watch each occupied themselves differently. Li Song leaped onto a large tree, sat cross-legged, and vigilantly observed his surroundings. Han Wangang paced back and forth, looking quite bored. Du Huarong, using the campfire light, actually started doing needlework, not at all resembling a martial arts woman. Shen Shaohai, on the other hand, held a small knife and carved something from a tree root. Chu Ning, at this time, simply sat cross-legged with his eyes closed, appearing to be meditating and recuperating.

It was naturally inappropriate to cultivate the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art in front of so many people. No matter how much he controlled it, there would still be a slight mana fluctuation when he cultivated. Chu Ning didn't want any unforeseen complications. Therefore, he would cultivate his art when he could rest in inns or similar places. In the wilderness, Chu Ning generally cultivated the Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art.

At this moment, Chu Ning's mind was constantly analyzing and pondering an Intermediate Lower-grade talisman called the Profound Water Spirit Talisman. He had long since completed the analysis of the Sword Sealing Talisman's rune patterns. Now, if he wanted, he could easily craft Sword Sealing Talismans of high quality. So, Chu Ning had turned his attention to the Profound Water Spirit Talisman. This talisman was one of the Intermediate Lower-grade talismans he had purchased from the Cloud Sea Pavilion.

Chu Ning had also found after several attempts that when first analyzing a talisman, he indeed needed to observe the talisman carefully to comprehend and analyze its rune patterns. However, once he reached a certain stage of comprehension, these rune patterns seemed to be etched into his mind. When he wanted to analyze and comprehend them, he only needed to meditate in his mind to gradually understand the principles of the rune patterns within. This also made it convenient for him to pass the time on the road. Sometimes, even on horseback, he could pretend to be resting with closed eyes while researching this Art of Rune Source.

He didn't know how much time had passed, but Chu Ning finally blinked his eyes slightly and let out a soft breath. "This Intermediate Lower-grade talisman's rune patterns are indeed much more profound than those of Elementary Upper-grade talismans. It only took me six days to analyze and comprehend the Elementary Upper-grade Sword Sealing Talisman. But this Profound Water Spirit Talisman has taken over twenty days. Of course, this is partly because I didn't have as much uninterrupted time, but the profundity of the talisman itself is also a major reason."

After sighing inwardly, Chu Ning began cultivating the Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art. Such seated meditation, let alone half the night, even an entire night would be no problem for him. After cultivating the Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art, Chu Ning felt his divine consciousness fully restored, and there were even signs of it subtly strengthening. He inwardly examined his Niwan Palace and indeed saw that among the hundred-plus drops of divine consciousness liquid, another drop had grown to the size of the original undivided drop from the first level of the Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art.

Chu Ning then checked the progress of his various cultivation arts in his mind and gained a clear understanding of their progress.

[Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art (Profound-tier Upper-grade), First Level (35/5000)]
[Nine Transformations Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Tendon-Breaking Stage: 868/1500]
[Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art, Second Level: 145/2000]

If the proficiency of the Blazing Fire Divine Wood Art's first level reached 100, it likely meant that all his mana had been converted into wood-fire dual-attribute mana. With less than 1 point of proficiency increase per day, it would still take some time. His body tempering art had been largely stagnant recently. As for the Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art, perhaps when all one hundred drops of divine consciousness liquid reached the size of the original undivided drop, the proficiency would reach 2000. That was still a considerable distance, but currently, with the aid of Rune Source analysis, the Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art could increase by about 2 points a day. This was considered relatively fast among his various cultivation methods.

For Chu Ning, who had previously cultivated extremely fast, such a pace was, in some ways, a bit agonizing. However, Chu Ning regarded it as a method for tempering his state of mind.

Having completed his Divine Consciousness Cultivation Art cultivation, Chu Ning ended his session and was about to get up and stretch. The next moment, he abruptly opened his eyes, his gaze casually falling on the direction of the western forest, his body remaining still.

After a long while, Li Song, who was sitting in the tree, suddenly let out a roar: "Horse bandits! Be on guard!"

As he shouted, Li Song leaped down from the tree, grabbing the saber at his waist. The others, hearing Li Song's shout, also sprang up, drawing their weapons.

"What's wrong? Horse bandits?" Cheng Jinhe now emerged from his carriage, his face filled with worry and lament. Clearly, for him, this kind of unexpected trouble was the last thing he wanted to see.

"Patron, please return to the carriage and hide well. There are quite a few bandits this time, it might take some effort." Li Song said, glancing at Chu Ning and the others. His meaning was clear: this time, they would have to contribute. Chu Ning nodded in response, and the others also nodded.

Just then, a group of masked men surged out of the forest, easily seventy or eighty of them.

"Kill!" With a roar, both sides quickly clashed.

Chu Ning, carrying his greatsword, charged forward. He hadn't learned any mundane martial arts, nor did he know any techniques. However, in his eyes, every movement of these people was full of flaws. This alone was enough!

The greatsword swung with ease. Horse bandits who came close to Chu Ning were either struck, their bones directly shattered, or accurately severed at the neck, their heads falling off entirely. In the blink of an eye, five or six horse bandits lay dead by Chu Ning's hand.

Seeing no one on his side, Chu Ning's figure flickered, and he arrived at the rear of the convoy. Compared to the front, the guards here were clearly weaker and were struggling. This was thanks to Yao Rong, the deputy leader, who wielded his twin daggers in a blur, attracting the encirclement of several horse bandits. Otherwise, some of the guards at the rear might have already been injured.

However, everything changed completely once Chu Ning joined. These guards watched in astonishment as Chu Ning plunged into the bandit group, cutting them down one by one with his sword as if slicing watermelons. In a flash, only four horse bandits remained, still besieging Yao Rong at the rear.

Chu Ning's figure swept forth again, using only forty percent of his ordinary Thunderclap Step speed, yet to the others, it was just a blur before their eyes. The next moment, Chu Ning had already appeared beside Yao Rong. With a swing of his heavy sword, two horse bandits were instantly beheaded. The remaining two horse bandits, seeing this, were terrified and turned to flee.

Chu Ning casually flicked his greatsword from the ground, and two bowl-sized stones shot out like cannonballs, striking the two horse bandits in their backs. "Pfft!" Both men spat out large mouthfuls of blood, then tumbled to the ground.

The guards stared blankly at this scene, then turned to look at Chu Ning, their eyes filled with nothing but shock and awe. Such strength, to them, was truly astonishing.

"Things are bad, let's scatter!" At this moment, the other horse bandits also seemed to realize something was wrong, and one of their leaders shouted. Immediately, the remaining horse bandits scattered in all directions.

The few guards still engaged in combat wanted to pursue, but Li Song immediately roared to stop them. "Do not pursue a desperate foe!"

When the horse bandits had dispersed, all eyes, including Li Song's, Shen Shaohai's, and Han Wangang's, fell upon Chu Ning. Although everyone had been fighting, their strength was not weak, and they had naturally been observing their surroundings. Chu Ning's effortless methods of slaughtering the horse bandits, leaving none alive, were naturally seen by everyone.

"Brother Chu, what exquisite skill!" The woman Du Huarong was the first to praise him, a complex look in her eyes.

Han Wangang's eyes widened, and he immediately followed up, "Let me see, you killed thirty bandits in total, and you alone killed thirteen of them. Damn it, good thing I didn't spar with you earlier, wouldn't that have been asking for trouble?"

Yu Zhengchun, the middle-aged grey-clad man, Dai Zuen, who was thin as a monkey, and Shen Shaohai, who usually talked the most, did not speak. However, their gazes towards Chu Ning were now filled with apprehension.
