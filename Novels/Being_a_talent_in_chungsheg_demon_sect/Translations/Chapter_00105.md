**Chapter 105: Third Visit to the Witch Ghost Realm**

Although he decided to go to the novice village to show off, Lü Yang still planned to make the best preparations beforehand, aiming to complete at least three small objectives before going.

"First, the True Disciple identity of the Saint Sect. This is the simplest."

"As long as I replicate my actions from the life before last, methodically revealing my Great Perfection Qi Condensation cultivation and simultaneously cultivating a great divine ability, it should be enough."

"Second is Skull Mountain's leyline."

"Although I successfully inherited the [Yanluo Palace] after restarting with the Myriad Spirit Banner, I lost the blessing of Skull Mountain's leyline."

"I need to figure out a way for this."

"Otherwise, without Skull Mountain's leyline blessing, the power of the [Yanluo Palace], in Su Nü's current state, would be less than half of its peak during my previous life."

"Lastly... Old Ancestor Yun of the Yun family."

"The Heavenly Secret Supreme Treasure in his hands is extremely useful to me. Perhaps it can help me calculate karma in advance and eliminate variables to the greatest extent."

These three small objectives: the first provides identity and status, the second ensures his combat strength, and the third prevents unexpected situations. Coupled with Zhao Xuhe as a shield, this four-layered insurance made him confident he could deal with Fulong Arhat.

In fact, Lü Yang's thoughts didn't stop there.

Fulong Arhat, after all, was at the Mid-Foundation Establishment stage. Even if he broke through, being constantly targeted by such a powerful expert would undoubtedly be a huge hidden danger.

If possible, he wouldn't mind luring Fulong Arhat over and then ambushing and killing him directly!

That would be a permanent solution!

Lü Yang secretly set his goals in his heart. The world was vast, filled with crises everywhere. Only by achieving the position of a True Lord could he gain the qualification to overlook the entire world.

With his goals set, Lü Yang was already familiar with the rest of the matters. He only needed to directly replicate his actions from the life before last, without needing to do much more.

He speculated on substitute Yin puppets, earning tens of thousands of contribution points, and then announced he was entering seclusion.

Lü Yang was very patient, not rushing things at all.

In a blink of an eye, ten years passed.

Within these ten years, Lü Yang successively cultivated back his great divine abilities from his previous life. His True Qi was perfected, and he once again reached the peak state where he could attempt Foundation Establishment at any time.

Ten years later, Lü Yang emerged from seclusion, successfully 'breaking through' to the Late Qi Condensation stage.

Soon, everything fell into place. Immortal Fairy Feixia, representing the Three Rivers Assembly, came to recruit him. Lü Yang decisively agreed, and incidentally, freeloaded another great divine ability.

The great divine ability Lü Yang chose this time was named "Twelve Capital Heavenly Fiend Secret Demonic Calamity Light."

As the name suggests, this great divine ability was completely different from the Corpse Disintegration True Method and the Heavenly Silkworm Secret. Rather than increasing the chances of Foundation Establishment, its purpose was more inclined towards combat.

"To achieve this divine ability, one must refine a treasure, make it fly high into the vast sky, enter the thirty-six layers of Gang Clouds, and use it to gather boundless malevolent energy from beyond the heavens. Accumulating day by day, this energy would eventually condense into a beam of calamity light, which could then be drawn down from the sky when needed. Wherever the calamity light passed, all living beings would perish!"

"Moreover, the longer it accumulates, the greater its power!"

"However, just making the magic treasure fly up to the thirty-six layers of Gang Clouds is almost impossible for a Qi Condensation cultivator; the difficulty is outrageously high."

Of course, this was a minor issue for Lü Yang.

"Let Su Nü endure a bit more hardship."

Lü Yang summoned Su Nü, then handed the Blood Sun Sword Pellet to her, instructing her to fly into the thirty-six layers of Gang Clouds and cultivate this great divine ability on his behalf.

"With this great divine ability, I'll have one more trump card in future combat."

"If I'm fully prepared later, my chances of breaking through Foundation Establishment could even increase to ninety percent. I can then use the Righteous-Demonic War to complete the last ten percent."

Perfect Foundation Establishment!

Although Lü Yang hadn't initially intended to deliberately pursue this achievement, in this life, he wanted to be absolutely foolproof, so he likely had to take this step.

Perfect Foundation Establishment meant reaching the peak of early Foundation Establishment immediately upon breakthrough!

Perhaps only then would he truly possess some ability for self-preservation.

A month later, Lü Yang methodically followed the plan. At Immortal Fairy Feixia's invitation, he, she, Zhao Xuhe, and Lu Yuanchun went together to oversee the Skull Mountain Market.

However, compared to the life before last, this life had an additional variable in Zhao Xuhe.

In the life before last, Zhao Xuhe was extremely down and out due to the loss of the Coiling Dragon opportunity, and could only bring a Heavenly Secret Stealing Art to Skull Mountain Market for a final gamble.

However, in this life, Zhao Xuhe was much more full of vigor and ambition. As the reincarnation of "True Lord Coiling Dragon", his cultivation progress could almost be described as miraculous. Furthermore, with Lü Yang's secret funding, he reached Great Perfection Qi Condensation within ten years, similarly reaching the threshold of assaulting Foundation Establishment.

However, this was exactly what Lü Yang wanted.

After all, True Lord Yinshan needed a Saint Sect disciple to open the secret realm, and Lü Yang certainly wouldn't cooperate. It was perfect to have Zhao Xuhe step in.

Northern Frontier, Skull Mountain.

"I'm back."

Quietly leaving the group, Lü Yang soon returned to the entrance of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, preparing to have the [Yanluo Palace] re-attach to Skull Mountain's leyline.

However, the next second, he froze.

"Skull Mountain's leyline... has an owner!?"

As he activated the [Yanluo Palace], just as he intended to connect with the leyline, he discovered that a majestic palace already stood at the center of the leyline!

It was precisely also a Yanluo Palace!

"This is... Patriarch Tingyou!?" Lü Yang frowned deeply as experiences from his previous lives flashed through his mind, and an expression of realization appeared on his face.

In the life before last, the news of the Witch Ghost Secret Realm first spread from the Divine Martial Sect, and it was discovered by Divine Martial Sect disciples. At that time, he hadn't noticed.

However, reconsidering it now, if he hadn't appeared, and a few Divine Martial Sect disciples entered the secret realm, how could Patriarch Tingyou, who was on the verge of death, not notice? How could he sit idly by and do nothing? Moreover, the price of his Soul Seizing Secret Art was to kill everyone within the entire Witch Ghost Secret Realm.

And in the life before last, the Witch Ghost Secret Realm was empty!

In an instant, Lü Yang reached a conclusion: "At this point in time, Patriarch Tingyou has probably already seized the body of a Divine Martial Sect disciple and lived out his fifth life!"

So, Patriarch Tingyou from the life before last actually won.

Because at the end of the life before last, True Lord Yinshan resolved the Golden Core Sword Qi and reopened the Witch Ghost Secret Realm, yet only took away a strand of [Heavenly Corpse Malice]...

The leyline was still there!

True Lord Yinshan, for the sake of his cultivation path, lured away the Heavenly Corpse Malice, little knowing that he himself had become Patriarch Tingyou's bait, used to lure away that Golden Core Sword Qi!

"...Remarkable!"

If Patriarch Tingyou was indeed still alive, then all his schemes had actually succeeded! On the contrary, it was his own appearance in the previous life that caused him to fail at the last minute.

After figuring everything out, even Lü Yang couldn't help but marvel.

Because without him as a variable, Patriarch Tingyou would have been a miracle: a Foundation Establishment cultivator who escaped from a Golden Core True Monarch over a thousand years!

Just then, a consciousness was suddenly transmitted from the center of the leyline:

"Who are you!?"

The voice was full of surprise, doubt, and even a hint of bewilderment. It was none other than Patriarch Tingyou. Lü Yang's eyes darted, and he instantly reacted.

Because he was using the [Yanluo Palace] to connect with the leyline!

And the [Yanluo Palace] was a supreme divine ability created by Patriarch Tingyou, a secret not passed down. In his view, logically, only he should be able to cast it.

How could there be a second one?

Thinking of this, Lü Yang's expression quickly changed, filled with ecstasy and shock. His voice even carried a hint of a choked sob: "Patriarch Tingyou, is that Patriarch Tingyou?"

"You're really still alive!"

"Heaven above, Heaven does not want our Witch Ghost Dao to perish!"

With that, without another word, Lü Yang bowed down and performed a grand bow, saying: "Lü Yang, 376th generation disciple of the Witch Ghost Dao, greets Patriarch!"

Patriarch Tingyou: "...?"
