Chapter 116: Ancient Bronze Creation Seal, Autumn Water Pavilion Team Building Game

After agreeing to look out for each other in the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm, Li Mo descended the mountain against the sunset.

He felt a bit tired, as if his body were weak...

Well, that was just an illusion.

Little Li knew that he was actually much stronger than before he went up the mountain. The nine-petaled lotus in his Dantian had now bloomed with two leaves.

It was just that the feeling was far inferior to having the Dragon and Tiger Golden Core in his Dantian, the kind of feeling where one commands the wind and clouds, and one's entire aura is condensed into one.

As soon as Senior Brother Xiao Bao left, Li Mo felt his own body grow heavier.

"With this experience, it will be much easier for me to condense my Profound Core in the future."

Little Li was full of hope for his Profound Core realm.

Walking down the mountain, he went to the Outer Affairs Hall to buy groceries while checking the investment feedback he had just received.

【Congratulations, Host, for helping 'Tang Xiao Bao' achieve enlightenment.】

【Investment Feedback: Ancient Bronze Creation Seal.】

【Ancient Bronze Creation Seal】: "When used on a Divine Contemplation Diagram, it can upgrade a High Grade or lower Divine Contemplation Diagram by one rank."

"Creation Seal... something similar to the Heavenly Book Seal?"

Li Mo thought for a moment.

He only had two Divine Contemplation Diagrams on him. One was the Golden Crow Transforming into the Sun Contemplation Diagram, which was of the Extreme Form, and couldn't be used with the Creation Seal at all.

The other was the Night Ghost Stone Sculpture, a Lower Form Divine Contemplation Diagram.

Using it on that would be a waste of a treasure.

"I'm so handsome, practicing this thing would be an even greater waste."

Little Li decided to store this Creation Seal for the time being.

By the time he returned to Autumn Water Pavilion, the sky was dark.

As soon as he stepped in, a lingering chill met him. If the wind blew on it, an ordinary person would definitely shiver from the cold.

Evidently, a certain ice lump had just finished her training.

"It's just a little wind and frost."

Li Mo walked in carrying a basket of groceries.

The sight that greeted him was of a girl sitting under a tree, playing Go.

She had somehow dug up a Go board and, in her spare time, played against herself.

The moonlight was like water, filtering through the leaves and making both her and the Go board shimmer.

Hearing the footsteps at the door, her high-bridged nose twitched.

"What's that smell on you?"

*Hmm*

Li Mo brought his sleeve to his nose and sniffed, then suddenly realized.

"It's the fragrance of pills from Pill Alchemy Peak."

"By the way, why are you playing Go by yourself?"

Ying Bing turned her gaze to the side, towards Shang Wu.

Well.

The Master didn't seem like the type to play Go.

Li Mo thought for a moment. It was about time to organize some team-building activities.

It was necessary for maintaining his relationship with his big investor, the ice lump!

"It just so happens we're eating something delicious today. We can play while we eat."

"I'll teach you all a game later, even the Master can learn it."

Shang Wu looked up and rolled her eyes at him.

Polite Master translation: "You, punk?"

.....

Soon, a pot was set up in the small courtyard.

The pickled vegetable casserole bubbled and gurgled.

"This is the delicious food you were talking about?"

Shang Wu curled her lips.

She still preferred meat and fish.

"That's because you don't understand, Master. Do you know what they call..."

Li Mo hummed a little tune as he cut tofu.

"Eating pickled vegetables with tofu~ The emperor himself~ is no match for me~"

Actually, the pickled vegetables and tofu in the pot weren't ordinary.

As everyone knows, Little Li wouldn't give up a rare investment opportunity just to change his taste.

The tofu was ground from Exquisite Cardamom, and the pickled vegetables were made from Seven-Leaf Moistening Qi Grass. They were incredibly fragrant.

Shang Wu hummed along for a couple of lines, then took a bite of tofu. Her almond-shaped eyes lit up.

"Eating hot pot and singing... it is pretty fun."

"Your voice isn't bad either. Have you considered letting me be your agent? We could debut directly at the Pavilion of Myriad Flowers?"

"Hmph, forget it. If I went, would their lead singer even need to compete?"

"Quite right, quite right."

The master and disciple ate and chattered away.

Ying Bing's originally tense heartstrings inexplicably relaxed a bit at this moment.

She had only just learned about the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm today.

In her previous life, she had obtained the Blood Phoenix Essence by killing Han Zhen, which was already after she had reached the Law Body Realm.

But unlike her previous life, the Blood Phoenix Secret Realm this time was causing a huge commotion, attracting attention from all sides, which would lead to many unforeseen changes.

"Ice lump."

"Hm?"

Li Mo's call brought her back to her senses.

"Have you learned it?"

"Learned what?"

Ying Bing gently placed a piece of tofu in her mouth.

"Gomoku. If you haven't learned it, I'll teach you again."

Li Mo didn't wait for her agreement and directly picked up some stones to demonstrate.

"Like this, connect five in a row, and you win."

"Aren't these games for children?"

Ying Bing shook her head.

Seeing she wasn't interested, Li Mo could only shrug and continue playing with Shang Wu.

The beautiful Master relied on luck and never lost, but when it came to technique, she never won.

"Master, you're so bad at this."

"Gah! I won't accept this!"

Shang Wu had a slip of paper stuck to her eyebrow.

Two minutes later.

"Skill up... but to lose in the hands of the Unrivaled Go Sage of the Clear Abyss Sect, it's an honorable defeat for you."

Li Mo's performative personality kicked in, clasping his hands behind his back as if he were looking down on all living beings.

"Little Bing'er, help me get revenge!"

Shang Wu sought outside help.

She already had two slips of paper on her face.

Li Mo also looked over with a smile.

Just now, the ice lump said it was boring, but she had actually been watching them closely.

"Do you want to play a few rounds?"

"You said it's a child's game, so prove you can win against me."

If it were anyone else saying this, Ying Bing would have just ignored it.

Why would she need to prove herself by beating others?

But it was Li Mo.

"Alright."

She put down her chopsticks, her clear, deep eyes fixed on him.

Li Mo: "!"

Strange, where is this burning desire to compete coming from?

It seemed even more confident than during the Nine脉 Tournament on the arena.

The ice lump's competitive spirit was really strange.

But Little Li was the 'founder' of Gomoku, how could he lose his momentum?

"Hmph, with just a slight move from me, you will be utterly defeated!"

......

One minute later.

Li Mo stared at the Go board, questioning his life.

He lost?

He was a national-level Gomoku master! The grid notebooks he used in high school and middle school could wrap around Autumn Water Pavilion three times.

He actually lost the very first game?

"It seems we won't be playing many rounds."

Ying Bing said calmly.

Her eyes, like a clear spring under the moonlight, flashed with a hint of pleasure.

"Fine, fine, I accept my loss."

Seeing her relaxed expression, Li Mo cut a piece of paper.

"Come on, stick it on."

"Mm..."

Ying Bing took the slip of paper, lowered her eyes for a few seconds, then poked her jade-like finger at a certain someone's philtrum.

Li Mo: "?"
