Chapter 302: The Sword Burial Abyss

"Enough with the pleasantries," Qing Luan interrupted him, sliding a golden needle out from her sleeve. "After taking the pill, immediate acupuncture is required to lock in the lightning spirit qi within."

Though the spiritual energy of heaven and earth has only been recovering for a few decades, it has been enough to revive many previously useless exquisite techniques.

She turned to the attendants and instructed, "Place the medicinal cauldron in the courtyard and prepare a bucket of Cold Jade Ice Spring Water."

Chi Shao had already opened the medicine box on her own. Pinching the Purple Gold Forging Bone Pill between two fingers, she waved it in front of Xu Yunfan. "Junior Brother, open your mouth..."

Xu Yunfan swallowed the pill without hesitation. Instantly, the medicinal efficacy felt like a raging fire burning through his body. He grunted softly but used the momentum to circulate his technique, forcing the medicinal power into his four limbs and all his bones.

At this moment, Qing Luan lightly tapped the bronze medicinal cauldron with her slender hand. The medicinal soup inside churned, unexpectedly radiating a faint, luminous glow.

"Junior Brother, this is the Dao Sect's secret 'Eight Treasures Cleansing Heaven Soup.' Enter immediately after taking the pill, and remember, you cannot wear any clothing."

Xu Yunfan didn't hesitate upon hearing this. He stripped off his robe directly. With a thought, the dragon scale armor on his body peeled away layer by layer, leaving him naked.

Under Qing Luan's slightly flushed cheeks and Chi Shao's unblinking gaze, he forcefully suppressed the rising heat below and stepped into the bronze cauldron with an unchanged expression.

"Guard your mind and focus on moving your blood and qi to digest the medicinal efficacy. Leave everything else to us," Qing Luan said, tapping Xu Yunfan's Jianjing acupoint with her fingertip. The medicinal efficacy seeped into his flesh and blood through the Nine Turns Palace Pushing Hands.

Xu Yunfan felt a piercing pain all over his body, as if being bitten by ten thousand ants, but amidst the agony, he sensed his bones and muscles transforming once again.

Chi Shao's palm wind, like a butterfly, forced the medicinal qi into his Dantian and whispered, "The Sect Master instructed that after this medicinal bath, you must use the Dragon and Tiger Hibernation Breath Technique to seal your aura. Do not let outsiders see through your foundation."

Amidst the steam rising from the medicinal cauldron, Xu Yunfan's muscles and bones began to glow. The mixed and chaotic techniques within his body gradually became harmonized under the modulation of the secret medicine.

He clenched his fists and thought to himself, "The perfection of Marrow Cleansing is just within reach..."

The morning dew had not yet dried, and the clouds atop the Qingwei Summit had not yet dispersed. Xu Yunfan had already stepped onto the green stone steps and arrived before the Qingwei Hall.

Two bronze Kirin statues stood on either side of the hall doors, their eyes glowing with spiritual light as if scrutinizing the visitor.

He took a deep breath, straightened his robe to cover the dragon scale armor underneath. Today, he was to meet not only his master, Bi Yuan, but also many high-level figures of the Dao Sect. There was no room for the slightest breach of etiquette.

Pushing open the doors, a rich sandalwood scent rushed towards him. The interior of the hall was dimly lit. Thirty-six eternal lamps hung from the ceiling, illuminating Bi Yuan seated in the main seat.

The Ninth Realm Qi Refining Grandmaster was not in his usual attire today. Instead, he wore a black robe with golden patterns and a Seven Star Crown, his majesty surpassing that of ordinary days.

The Head of the Punishment Hall, Cui Yu, stood beside him like an iron tower. A long sword emitting a chilling aura hung at his waist, his gaze sweeping over the people in the hall like lightning.

Xu Yunfan's gaze shifted slightly. He saw more than ten profound and unfathomable elders standing on both sides of the hall. Each one was a figure who could shake the Dao Sect with a single stomp.

The first on the left was the Dragon Tiger Peak's Head, Li Zhi. With a red face and long beard, his sharp sword intent, though deliberately restrained, still made the skin of those nearby tingle.

An ancient sword without a scabbard hung at his waist, its blade faintly revealing dragon and tiger patterns. It was the famous "Dragon Tiger Golden Core Sword" that shook the Qingzhou region.

Beside Li Zhi was the Jade Balance Peak's Head, Zhou Xuanqing. He appeared to have the demeanor of an immortal, holding a white jade whisk. However, when he turned slightly, his broad Daoist robe revealed muscles as knotted as old tree roots.

This giant, nearly two and a half meters tall, cultivated the "Giant Spirit Divine Gang." He relied on brute force to conquer all techniques and had once torn apart a wild elephant from the South Desert with his bare hands. At this moment, he was squinting to size up Xu Yunfan, the tassel of his whisk moving without wind.

Further back was the Green Mist Peak's Head, Lu Jiuxiao. His face was cold and stern, and a chilling aura circulated around him. Rumor had it he had cultivated the "Xuan Ming Jade Book" to perfection, only a step away from turning the qi in his body into true qi.

But this step, he had stumbled over for half a century without making progress.

On the right side was led by the Deputy Sect Master, Shen Wuya.

This heavyweight who had been in a covert struggle with Bi Yuan for many years特意 changed into a black Daoist robe today. The Cold Crow Peak's Head, Wu Ming, was as thin as a bamboo pole, his ten fingernails glowing with a dark luster. It was said that his "Nine Nether Poison Aura" could corrode iron and steel. Although he had not reached the Ninth Realm, due to the recovery of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, he managed to refine a trace of poison aura, which was quite extraordinary.

Xu Yunfan, having quickly scanned the hall, felt his heart tighten slightly. If these people were to step out of the Dao Sect and onto the Jianghu, each one would be a top expert capable of shaking the entire Jianghu with a single stomp.

He walked forward steadily and stopped three zhang from the main seat, performing a three-kowtow and nine-bows salute. "Disciple Xu Yunfan greets Master."

His clear voice echoed in the silent hall.

Bi Yuan smiled and raised his hand, a gentle force lifting Xu Yunfan up. "Rise."

This simple action made several elders' pupils contract slightly. The Sect Master's display of qi, perfectly balancing yin and yang, undoubtedly showed that he had reached an extremely profound level within the Ninth Realm.

Xu Yunfan then turned to Cui Yu and the various elders, saluting them one by one with the etiquette of a disciple.

When facing Li Zhi, he deliberately performed half a salute. When approaching Bai Wuchen (Note: The name Bai Wuchen appears here, likely a typo for Zhou Xuanqing or another elder, but translated as written), he deliberately slowed his movements, making his posture extremely respectful.

These details fell into everyone's eyes, each with their own thoughts.

After the salutations, Bi Yuan stroked his beard and laughed. "I called you here today because there is good news. At noon today, the tide of evil qi will be at its lowest, which is the perfect opportunity to enter the abyss and retrieve a weapon."

As he spoke, his gaze turned to Shen Wuya, his tone carrying a hint of amusement. "Deputy Sect Master Shen is generous, gifting you his spot in the Sword Burial Abyss. According to the rules, the holder of the token can take two divine weapons."

The air in the hall suddenly solidified.

Shen Wuya's smile remained unchanged. As he stood up and cupped his hands, a faint sound of bones cracking came from his sleeve. "Junior Brother Xu has conquered thirty-six arenas in a row. I am naturally pleased to see this."

But Wu Ming, standing nearby, clearly saw the Deputy Sect Master's left hand, hanging by his side, twitching slightly. Having been together for so many years, he naturally knew that Shen Wuya was suppressing his anger, causing such a physical reaction.

Xu Yunfan keenly sensed that when Bi Yuan mentioned "two divine weapons," at least five sharp and piercing gazes swept over him.

He calmly circulated the "Dragon Tiger Hibernation Breath Technique," trying to disguise himself as an ordinary Marrow Cleansing realm practitioner. Some things are better left partially hidden; this would make people think and guess more, daring them to extend their claws too recklessly.

He also bowed deeply to Shen Wuya. "Disciple thanks the Deputy Sect Master for his generous gift. I will not fail this opportunity."

Bi Yuan's gaze swept over the slightly fluctuating aura of Xu Yunfan as he secretly circulated the "Dragon Tiger Hibernation Breath Technique," and an unfathomable smile appeared at the corner of his mouth, but he did not expose it.

He turned to face the various Heads and elders in the hall, cupping his hands in a salute with a gentle sweep of his sleeves. "Fellow brothers and sisters, senior uncles, this is the Xu Yunfan who will enter the Sword Burial Abyss today."

As soon as his words fell, the atmosphere in the hall became subtly tense.

Dragon Tiger Peak's Head Li Zhi was the first to nod, his red face and long beard trembling slightly.

Jade Balance Peak's Zhou Xuanqing, his giant-like body leaning forward slightly, had the tassel of his whisk moving without wind. The Punishment Hall's Cui Yu directly applauded with a laugh, nodding with a smile. The表态 of these three immediately prompted more than half of the elders to follow suit in agreement.
