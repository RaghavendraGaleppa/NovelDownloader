# Chapter 634: Just Luring the Snake Out

Zhang Ziyang instantly understood. "Take its divine core, refine and brand its authority. Though it won't become your own Dao Fruit, it can serve as a suit of armor. In the eyes of this world's Heavenly Dao, you will become one of their own. Your actions will be much more convenient, no longer needing to tread on thin ice like today."

As he spoke, Zhang Ziyang couldn't help but look at Xu Yunfan with an approving gaze. "Although your talent and comprehension are rather average, after all these years, you won't suffer any losses."

Xu Yunfan: "..."

My talent is actually quite impressive.

If you were to inquire in the Taihua Void Realm, who else is like Xu Yunfan? In less than 150 years, he has already reached the late stage of Foundation Establishment, and even condensed his own Intent Image with a mere flick of his hand, taking a single step into the perfect Foundation Establishment stage to achieve the rank of Great True Person.

Although the assistance of the Attribute Panel was indispensable in this process, he still cultivated step by step on his own merit.

"...You flatter me, Sect Master."

Zhang Ziyang nodded slightly. "This plan is feasible. However, the Pantheon of the Natural Heart has deep roots. According to Dilys, although it cannot compare to the two great pantheons of Light and Darkness, and does not claim supremacy through might, it cannot be underestimated either."

"That God of Thunder, while not the true Thunder God of the Light Pantheon, has authority that touches its periphery. This makes him the perfect target for you to make your move. However, since he wields thunder, his strength must not be weak. We need to deploy meticulously. First, let's see what kind of strength he possesses."

It was simple: if the opponent was weak, they would seize an opportunity to take him down in one go. If he was strong, they would need to plan for the long term.

However, Xu Yunfan estimated that even if he was strong, he couldn't be that strong.

From the intelligence they had gathered, this world's Main Gods could barely compare to a Golden Core True Lord.

Yet, this world only had three Main Gods in total.

Therefore, time was of the essence. If the Taihua Void Realm followed the trail and found this place, and those Golden Core True Lords caught wind of it, they wouldn't even be able to drink any soup.

After all, this world's Heavenly Dao materialized its authority into Divine Cores. In the eyes of the True Lords of the Taihua Void Realm, this was no different from scattering money in public. Coming here would be like picking up money.

"Precisely."

Xu Yunfan nodded. "So, please take the lead, Sect Master."

He looked at the Divine Core mark on Zhang Ziyang's forehead. "You have just acquired this ability, Sect Master, so it is the perfect time to showcase your prowess. Find the nest of that God of Thunder for me and scout the range of his faith and his power nodes. Only by knowing yourself and the enemy can we strike with certainty."

Zhang Ziyang smiled knowingly. His Divine Sense moved slightly, and the silver star on his forehead shimmered. An invisible, formless, yet all-penetrating power of investigation spread silently into the distance like water ripples.

The God who originally held the authority of investigation was completely useless, but in Zhang Ziyang's hands, it had a magical effect of turning decay into something miraculous.

With Zhang Ziyang's talent, he could naturally develop the authority of investigation to its full potential. In an instant, he was able to rely on the authority to achieve various marvelous effects.

Because it was the authority of the Heavenly Dao, in his hands, it was no less than a divine ability.

He sat cross-legged, his mind completely immersed in the application of his new authority, and began to search for the踪迹 of the God of Thunder belonging to the Pantheon of the Natural Heart in this vast and dangerous Western Wilds.

Xu Yunfan stood quietly to the side, his Divine Sense looking inward.

Thirteen strands of Immortal Golden Nature floated within the nascent Inner World, and the dark light of the Star Spirit Banner reflected his calm face.

The tranquility of the Western Wilds had been broken by him, and the stage of hunting weak gods had come to an end.

接下来, the spearhead will point towards stronger existences. As long as they get their hands on that God who governs natural thunder, everything will become much easier.

Zhang Ziyang sat cross-legged in quiet meditation. Suddenly, the silver star on his forehead flared brightly.

The authority of investigation spread silently with his Divine Sense, like invisible water ripples sweeping over the withered mountains of the Western Wilds, covering a range of several hundred thousand miles that he meticulously scanned.

Xu Yunfan watched from the side, somewhat surprised. He truly hadn't expected this Divine Core to be so effective in Zhang Ziyang's hands.

It was truly a waste of talent for it to have been stored in the Star Spirit Banner all this time.

Finally, Zhang Ziyang retracted his authority.

"There are no more gods in the Western Wilds. This place is inherently barren with few living creatures. As long as one aspires to progress, few gods would come here. We need to look at other regions."

Xu Yunfan naturally had no objections.

The investigation lasted for three days, and the feedback from the entire Western Wilds was nothing but empty echoes.

Zhang Ziyang's Divine Sense turned towards the North.

The Northern Wastes of Winter, where the Pantheon of Nature resides.

Ultimately, Zhang Ziyang's investigative power penetrated the perennially howling, piercing northern winds.

The moment his investigative power touched the Northern Wastes of Winter, the faithful prayers surged at him like a blizzard on the ice plains.

The chilling snow faith of the "Wrath of Winter" Pantheon, the cold wave fluctuations of the "Eternal Silent Glacier" Pantheon.

Although the discerning authority granted by the Divine Core was of a lower level, in Zhang Ziyang's hands, it could precisely filter out the miscellaneous faith tides of the Natural Heart, and within the vast torrent of faithful prayers, it locked onto a unique and violent thunderous rhythm.

"Found him. God of Thunder, Tatus."

Zhang Ziyang opened his eyes, and a divine text condensed at his fingertips.

"Deep in the Northern Wastes of Winter, above the 'Frost Skull' tribe of barbarians. His Divine Kingdom hangs above the clouds, summoning a thunderstorm that never ceases."

Without hesitation, the two immediately transformed into two streaks of light and shot off.

In half a day, they arrived above the frost-covered Northern Wastes.

Xu Yunfan's gaze swept over the hide tent clusters visible at the end of the ice plains.

The thunderclouds above the dome were thick as a lead curtain, and blue-white electric snakes writhed deep within the clouds.

The rough chants of the barbarians drifted with the cold wind, and thick streams of faithful prayers rose and converged, supporting a Divine Kingdom hidden within the clouds.

Xu Yunfan's Martial Dao Celestial Eye opened, and he saw it clearly.

Inside the Divine Kingdom, a ten-foot-tall giant stone statue, with muscles coiled like knots, was surrounded by bucket-thick blue-white chains of lightning, sitting high on a throne.

This was Tatus, the God who wields the authority of thunder.

"Luring the snake out?"

Xu Yunfan flipped his palm and took out a prism-shaped Divine Core.

This item came from a certain Spring Guardian. Its divinity was weak and already damaged, its surface covered in spiderweb-like cracks, yet it still emitted an irresistible tempting aura to gods.

Other gods would find it as irresistible as a starving beast smelling blood.

This was also a shortcut for gods in this world to improve their strength.

Zhang Ziyang instantly knew what Xu Yunfan was planning to do and nodded.

"We can try it."

The plan was quickly finalized.

Xu Yunfan transformed into a faint shadow and shot towards the West, until he was a thousand miles away from the Frost Skull tribe.

He chose a desolate valley backed by an ice cliff, embedded the Divine Core heavily into the frozen soil, and then used his Divine Celestial Power to simulate the chaotic energy aftershocks of a self-detonation, deliberately pointing the direction towards the Western Wilds.

The fabricated traces were crude but effective.

Shattered ice crystals splintered out in a radial pattern, and the scorched soil emitted a faint, burnt smell of divinity being annihilated, perfectly matching the rumors of hunters cleaning out the Western Wilds.

After all, with so many captured weak gods turned into Banner Spirits within the Banner, Xu Yunfan could make it look quite convincing.

Inside the Thunder God's Kingdom, the sound of metal and stone clashing and the wild laughter of women suddenly stopped.

A bewildered Tatus pushed away the barbarian priestess on his lap. A bronze wine cup rolled down, and the fine liquor splashed onto the stone steps inlaid with thunder patterns.
