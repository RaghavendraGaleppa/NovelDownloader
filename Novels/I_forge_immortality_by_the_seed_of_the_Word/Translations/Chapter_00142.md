# Chapter 140: Yuanming True Monarch

"This is the feeling of completing the Dao principles within my body?"

Zhang Jing felt a surge of excitement in his heart.

His consciousness shifted to the Muddy Pellet Palace, where he saw the Taishi Dao Foundation trembling slightly, exuding a faint sense of perfect harmony.

Seeing this, a trace of a smile appeared in his eyes.

Looking back, he saw that Deer Thirty-Eight had already fainted, yet the aura emanating from the deer was identical to his own.

"Junior Brother, come out quickly if you're done. I still need to take you to meet our teacher," came the teasing voice of Senior Brother Feng Wuyu.

"Coming right away," Zhang Jing promptly replied.

Soon after, a bronze divine light shot upward and disappeared in an instant—along with Zhang Jing and Deer Thirty-Eight from the Immortal Transformation Pool.

At the original location, the tall man looked at the now-empty pool with a sudden expression of fear.

"To think it was actually a legendary True Disciple who descended. It's fortunate he didn't blame us earlier, otherwise—"

"You're overthinking it," the shorter man said dismissively. "Even though he's a True Disciple from the Nine Domains lineage, he's still a True Disciple. If he were to make trouble for us over such a trivial matter, wouldn't he become a laughingstock among the True Disciples of our Celestial Realm lineage?"

"Besides, we were just following standard procedures. What right would he have to blame us?"

"Even so—" the tall man began, but the shorter one cut him off.

"On the other hand, I've already inquired about that junior brother in purple robes earlier. He was directly accepted into the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven."

"The Nine Domains have snatched another Grotto-Heaven quota from our Celestial Realm!"

The shorter man gnashed his teeth, his voice filled with envy, jealousy, and resentment.

Elsewhere, as they ascended higher and higher, Zhang Jing's gaze was drawn to the ten colossal suns—some crimson, some blazing white, others pitch-black—hanging at the highest point of the Qingxiao Xuanming Heaven's dome.

Vast and boundless! Majestic beyond measure!

They seemed to have existed since time immemorial, emanating an aura of ancient and terrifying grandeur.

"Senior Brother, where are we going?" Zhang Jing couldn't help but ask within the bronze Dao domain.

"See those great suns above us?" Feng Wuyu asked with a smile.

Zhang Jing nodded.

"The crimson sun is our destination—the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven. It's where you'll be cultivating from now on. Our teacher is waiting for you there."

---

"This is the Chiming Taihao Grotto-Heaven?"

A trace of astonishment flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes.

"Indeed. This Grotto-Heaven was personally opened by our teacher as his Dao sanctuary," Feng Wuyu said, his voice brimming with pride.

In a seemingly endless expanse of void, chaotic energies roiled incessantly, causing the space to tremble without pause.

Yet at the very center of this turmoil stood a bronze palace, ancient and weathered, its surface bearing the marks of erosion from the chaotic void—as though it might collapse at any moment.

But in the next instant, waves of immeasurably heavy aura emanated from the palace, instantly pacifying the turbulent void across trillions of miles.

Within the empty palace, a single eternal lamp cast a dim glow.

Beneath the lamp, a gray-robed man with disheveled hair slowly raised his head, revealing a face that resembled an eagle's, with golden feathers at his temples shimmering with divine radiance, interwoven with terrifying principles of the Dao.

The eagle-faced man seemed to exist within layers upon layers of void.

Suddenly, a light chuckle echoed through the hall.

"Haha, they've arrived."

Time passed slowly.

A streak of azure divine light appeared in the hall, dissipating to reveal Feng Wuyu and Zhang Jing.

Before Zhang Jing could steady himself, Feng Wuyu's voice boomed forth:

"Teacher, as entrusted, I have successfully brought Junior Brother Zhang Jing to you."

"Well done," came a gentle voice that seemed to originate from an unfathomable distance.

"This disciple will take his leave now."

Feng Wuyu bowed deeply and turned to exit the hall.

A voice suddenly reached Zhang Jing's mind: "Junior Brother, I'll wait for you outside."

As the doors closed softly, Zhang Jing's gaze fell upon the eagle-faced figure approaching him, each step causing ripples in the void.

At the sight of this figure, Zhang Jing felt as though an immeasurably vast void was moving toward him—a presence both terrifying and boundless.

"Zhang Jing? To have comprehended the Taishi Primordial Realm at the Qi Refining stage within the Myriad Gods Minor Void Heaven speaks well of your talent and comprehension. Hmm, your temperament is also commendable."

"I am Yuanming True Monarch. Are you willing to become my nominal disciple? If not, you may wait until the other True Spirit Ranking disciples from the Nine Domains ascend and choose to cultivate in one of the blessed lands or Dharma realms with them."

Without hesitation, Zhang Jing knelt and bowed deeply.

"Disciple Zhang Jing pays respects to Teacher!"

"Excellent! Rise quickly."

Yuanming True Monarch's expression softened with satisfaction.

"Thank you, Teacher."

Only after receiving permission did Zhang Jing rise, his gaze lingering on his teacher with unspoken questions.

Noticing his confusion, Yuanming True Monarch smiled gently.

"No need for surprise. This is but one of my thirty-six Dao manifestations."

Zhang Jing understood—these "Dao manifestations" were likely akin to avatars.

"There's no need for formality here. Sit."

At these words, a cushion appeared behind Zhang Jing.

"Thank you, Teacher."

As he sat, Yuanming True Monarch's gaze rested upon his newest and youngest disciple.

"Zhang Jing, I summoned you for two reasons. First, to formalize our master-disciple relationship. Second, to discuss the Taishi Primordial Realm inheritance you cultivate."

"By now, you must have some understanding of the Taishi Primordial Realm's unique characteristics?"

Zhang Jing nodded. "Teacher, this disciple has some limited understanding. I know the Taishi Primordial Realm is like a seed that can grow along different paths depending on the Dao principles one comprehends."

"Correct."

Yuanming True Monarch's serene gaze met Zhang Jing's.

"Which path do you wish to follow? Remember, each path of the Taishi Primordial Realm represents a distinct cultivation method. Once chosen, turning back becomes difficult."

"Please enlighten me, Teacher."

Suppressing his excitement, Zhang Jing bowed again.

Originally, he had been completely in the dark about how to cultivate the Taishi Primordial Realm or which Dao seeds and principles to incorporate.

Now, it seemed his teacher had already prepared the answers.
