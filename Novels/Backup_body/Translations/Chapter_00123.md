# Chapter 123: A Perfect Match, Partners in Crime

Zhongzhou, Southeast Region, Jiangshang Prefecture, Hongshan Town, by the sea.

A violent storm raged, with thunder, lightning, and flames lighting up the sky! The earth trembled, waves surged to the heavens, and rocks and trees turned to ashes!

Had Li Zhengjing not deliberately moved the battlefield to the seaside, the entire Hongshan Town—along with the surrounding villages—would have been utterly destroyed by now!

Amid this chaos, the arrival of the Flame God King, accompanied by his Qian and Kun Generals, actually suppressed the gathered immortals, deities, and arhats—transcendent beings of immense power!

In the capital, the images displayed by the Xuantian Mirror of the Imperial Hall plunged the atmosphere into dead silence.

The Imperial Preceptor remained expressionless, as if he had anticipated this.

The other immortals and deities, however, wore varied expressions—especially the deities, most of whom were incarnations of founding heroes of the dynasty. They were all too familiar with the Flame God King, who had once vied for supremacy against the Great Zhou Dynasty, and they harbored deep hatred for him.

"If we were in Hongshan Town today, working together, we could eliminate this great enemy, seize the opportunity of the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven, and reclaim the Dragon Pillar of the Imperial Hall… Why did the Imperial Preceptor insist we remain in the capital?"

"The Great Zhou's territory is vast. There is more than just the Southeast Region—there are countless Hongshan Towns…" The Imperial Preceptor finally spoke. "If all of you were gathered in the Southeast Region and disturbances arose elsewhere, how would the court respond? Moreover… he has finally appeared!"

A faint smile appeared on the Imperial Preceptor's face. "He didn't come from the Southern Wastelands. He has been lurking near the capital all along. Now that he has arrived in Hongshan Town, we no longer need to fear his interference in the capital's affairs… The real task that requires your presence in the capital can now begin!"

As he spoke, he glanced at Li Zhengjing in the Xuantian Mirror and thought to himself, "But regarding this boy… could I have been mistaken?"

He had always had a strong premonition that Li Zhengjing must have been prepared for something. Yet, even Li Zhengjing likely never expected that the events in Hongshan Town would attract the attention of a sect leader-level figure.

Now that Li Zhengjing had been captured and brought before the Flame God King, how would he escape?

Just as this thought crossed his mind, the Imperial Preceptor's pupils suddenly constricted!

A blinding sword light erupted, illuminating the entire Xuantian Mirror and obscuring all other visible scenes!

The sheer sharpness of the sword intent seemed to pierce through the mirror itself, sending a stinging sensation through the gathered immortals and deities.

At this moment, above the seas near Hongshan Town, Li Zhengjing—who had been captured by the Flame God King—unleashed an unparalleled, razor-sharp brilliance!

"What?!"

Every faction present was stunned by the overwhelming sword intent emanating from the Flame God King's location in the sky.

Elsewhere in the clouds, Ghost Valley Spirit Official glanced at Wall-Climbing Bird, who shook its head in confusion. "I don't know anything about this."

The Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities Crossing World's tone was complex. "The opportunity from the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven has transferred from Gao Xuan's body into Li Zhengjing's."

While the others were shocked and uncertain, the little dragon girl in the sea paid no attention to the outside world, continuing to pummel the River Valley Dragon God relentlessly.

Above the clouds, the Flame God King's pupils shrank, his face filled with astonishment.

Before him, Li Zhengjing opened his eyes, revealing only a faint smile before unleashing a blinding sword light.

The Kun Yuan Divine General, who had been holding Li Zhengjing captive, had no time to react before being pierced by over a hundred sword beams erupting from Li Zhengjing's body. With a scream, he plummeted from the sky!

Meanwhile, the wound on Li Zhengjing's right arm began to heal visibly, flesh and tendons regenerating at an astonishing rate.

The half-severed sword in his body no longer corroded him. Though he couldn't wield it, the Great Yan Void-Transforming Sword Qi he had cultivated—after being refined by the broken sword—burst forth from his left arm in a devastating beam of light that nearly split the heavens!

"What?!"

Every observer was shaken to their core!

The Flame God King's divine light erupted instantly, but even so, the sword beam pierced through it before he could react!

With a deafening crash, the Qian Yuan Divine General stepped forward, shielding his lord!

Yet even this upper-tier immortal was effortlessly impaled through the chest by the sword light!

The residual force struck the Flame God King's chest, sending him flying back over a thousand feet and cracking his divine stone body!

The god-king's eyes were filled with disbelief.

Li Zhengjing slowly descended from the sky, his right arm still severed, his left arm raised as he calmly surveyed the crowd.

At the same time, the Prefect of Jiangshang, who controlled the region's fortune, was the first to sense something amiss and sent a message through his official seal.

"You're only at the True Qi realm?" The Three Yang Duke, receiving the message, was stunned. "The immortal-level power you displayed earlier wasn't your own?"

After Li Zhengjing spat out the jade fragment containing Yuan Zhengfeng's remnant soul, his true Qi realm cultivation had been exposed. However, he had withdrawn all his aura to refine the broken sword. Amid the chaotic battle, those standing farther away had assumed he had perished.

Now, Li Zhengjing had revived.

Despite his sword light repelling the Flame God King—a former sect leader-level existence—the aura he exuded was still that of True Qi, not immortal-level mana!

"A technique that borrows external power?" The Grand Elder of the Feather Transformation Sect was shocked. "Could he have obtained our sect's lost 'Tiger-Leopard Thunder Prison Technique,' which has such an effect?"

As suspicion and doubt flickered in the eyes of the onlookers, Li Zhengjing landed on the sea's surface.

His gaze swept over the crowd before settling on the Flame God King a thousand feet away. He smiled and said, "The Flame King, who once sought to conquer the world—a figure comparable to a sect leader—has now been reborn in a divine body."

He raised his left arm and declared, "I expected immortal-level experts from various factions, but never imagined a former sect leader-level figure would appear!"

His left arm pointed at the Flame God King in the sky. "The opportunity from the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven is now mine. Who dares to challenge me?"

"..."

The Flame God King sighed, waving his sleeve to retrieve the severely wounded Qian and Kun Generals before descending to the ground.

Placing a hand on the cracks in his divine stone chest, he channeled vast amounts of faith power to mend the damage.

Then he stepped forward and said, "I never imagined Zhongzhou would produce such a prodigy in recent years. I heard your cultivation time was short, yet you possess such power… That single sword strike just now wounded two upper-tier immortals and forced me to expend thirty years' worth of faith power to heal."

He approached within a hundred feet and said slowly, "Earlier, I was careless—unprepared and unable to dodge. Now, I shall truly test your strength!"

In an instant, a radiant halo appeared behind the Flame God King as he summoned a pair of golden maces.

"Today, I will neither kill you nor seize your opportunity," the god-king declared, transforming into a beam of divine light as he charged. "I admire talent. If you lose, acknowledge me as your father. When we overthrow Zhongzhou and establish the Great Flame Dynasty, I shall make you a king!"

"Let’s talk after I lose!" Li Zhengjing laughed, activating the Blazing Sun Divine Sword in his left arm.

The friction of 36,500 muscle fibers generated flames—flames imbued with Great Yan Void-Transforming Sword Qi, amplified by the broken sword!

With a deafening explosion, the fiery sword beam tore through the void!

The Flame God King, about to close in, abruptly halted as his halo of faith power blocked the attack!

The halo shattered!

The god-king's pupils contracted as he barely dodged the residual sword beam.

Simultaneously, Li Zhengjing's 365 acupoints released True Qi—each strand infused with his refined sword intent.

Previously, he had used Yuan Zhengfeng's immortal-level mana to hastily form sword beams externally. But this time, he had accumulated and refined the Great Yan Void-Transforming Sword Qi within his body, enhanced by the broken sword—its power unparalleled!

Three hundred and sixty-five sword beams shot toward the Flame God King!

Yet the god-king's divine light surged as he swung his maces, closing in to within ten feet of Li Zhengjing!

Their auras clashed, scattering in all directions and disrupting the senses of all present.

At this moment, Li Zhengjing raised his left arm, his palm aimed at the Flame God King's head.

The god-king's mace pointed at Li Zhengjing's chest.

Their auras clashed, their gazes locked.

"You cannot kill me," the Flame God King's voice echoed in Li Zhengjing's ears.

Li Zhengjing replied, "And you cannot suppress me."

The Flame God King stepped within three feet, his eyes sharp. "Li Zhengjing, your body cannot endure such sharp sword Qi. Soon, you will end up like Gao Xuan."

Li Zhengjing said calmly, "After death, you became a deity, losing your original power. You are no longer a sect leader-level figure. Even if I can't kill you, I can still inflict severe damage."

The Flame God King's eyes flickered. "Even if you wound me, you won't fare any better."

Li Zhengjing remained silent, his gaze turning icy.

The Flame God King pressed closer.

Li Zhengjing's left arm, charged with the Blazing Sun Divine Sword, was ready to strike.

To the onlookers, the clash of divine light and sword Qi was overwhelmingly fierce.

One was a legendary figure who had once vied for supremacy a millennium ago.

The other was a rising star, having cultivated for barely a year yet possessing power rivaling upper-tier immortals—a prodigy unmatched in history!

"When I sought to conquer the world, your ancestors eighteen generations back were likely mere ants in the chaos," the Flame God King muttered with self-mockery. "Never did I imagine I would one day face a junior like you in battle."

"Look at the sea—each wave pushes the last. Each generation surpasses the last!" Li Zhengjing retorted before unleashing the Blazing Sun Divine Sword!

The Flame God King blocked with one mace while striking Li Zhengjing's body with the other!

BOOM!

A thunderous explosion shook the heavens!

Both figures were sent flying a thousand feet apart!

The crowd held their breath as the light faded and the dust settled.

Li Zhengjing lay on the beach, his right arm still severed at the elbow, his left arm charred black, a gaping hole in his chest, his entire body covered in wounds, his aura feeble.

His True Qi was nearly exhausted!

At the other end, the Flame God King's divine light had dissipated, his divine body riddled with cracks, utterly battered.

A mutual defeat?

"Both are spent—at their limits!" The Three Yang Duke roared, raising the Xuantian Mirror and directing its light at the Flame God King.

The god-king barely evaded. His divine light was gone—he could no longer maintain even upper-tier immortal strength.

"Li Zhengjing, you are formidable!" the Flame God King conceded, transforming into a beam of divine light as he fled south.

This former sect leader-level figure, who should have dominated the battlefield, had been grievously wounded by Li Zhengjing and was now forced to retreat!

The Three Yang Duke gave chase!

"All troops, follow me to slay the Flame King!" General Fang Yin bellowed.

The Flame King, who had once sought to conquer the world, was a lingering threat to the Great Zhou. Killing him today would honor the founding emperor!

But for the other factions, the Flame God King's fate was irrelevant.

Their attention was fixed on Li Zhengjing.

This youth, merely at the True Qi realm despite his young age and short cultivation time—already a peerless genius—now possessed the Heavenly Star Grotto-Heaven's opportunity!

An opportunity that had allowed Gao Xuan, a True Qi realm cultivator, to overpower upper-tier immortals!

Now, it had enabled Li Zhengjing to repel an ancient god-king!

"He's exhausted and suffering backlash!" The Grand Elder of the Luofu Sect lunged at Li Zhengjing, elated. "He's now a turtle in a jar—helpless!"

"He is a disciple of the Feather Transformation Sect!" The Feather Transformation Sect's Grand Elder intervened.

"This opportunity isn't reserved for sects alone!" Another powerhouse descended from Hongshan Town.

"Uncle Ghost Valley?" Wall-Climbing Bird tilted its head. "Shouldn't we save our master?"

"Aren't you going to act?" Ghost Valley Spirit Official asked the Venerable Ten Thousand Calamities.

"This little fox…" The Venerable sighed but made no move.

As the factions fought over the seemingly lifeless Li Zhengjing, the Luofu Sect's Grand Elder finally unleashed his sect's treasure—a great banner that repelled all challengers.

With their sect leader dead, securing this opportunity would ensure the Luofu Sect's survival!

Thus, he had brought the Luofu Heaven-Summoning Banner!

The heavens trembled as thunder rumbled!

Planting the banner in the sand, he blocked all approaches!

Then he reached for Li Zhengjing.

Only for Li Zhengjing to open his eyes, smile, and grab his hand with his left arm.

"..."

The Grand Elder's heart lurched with terror. "You faked death again?!"

The Blazing Sun Divine Sword erupted!

"The Luofu Heaven-Summoning Banner is mine!" Li Zhengjing declared, rising calmly.

Meanwhile, in the distant sky—

The Three Yang Duke screamed. "Flame God King! You weren't wounded by Li Zhengjing?!"

His divine body shattered into rubble, scattering across the land.
