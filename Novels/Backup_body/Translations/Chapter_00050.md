# Chapter 50: Golden Order Soars! Northbound Against All Odds!  

"Initially, I thought releasing the Gu insects in Jingye Prefecture and Tianyuan Prefecture to create traces of Xin Xuan would divert all the forces hunting him.  

"But I never expected the Great Zhou Dynasty to mobilize troops so flexibly, dividing them into three routes to easily surround Jingye Prefecture, Tianyuan Prefecture, and Xuanling Prefecture.  

"Other factions were indeed lured away, but the young sect master of Kunlun and the Buddhist disciple from the Diamond Temple seemed to know the truth and came straight to Xuanling Prefecture."  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master looked at the bronze mirror and whispered, "Now, Xin Xuan no longer trusts us. He believes it's our delay that prevented him from leaving Xuanling Prefecture, leading to his current predicament. This complicates things."  

He spoke with suppressed anger. In his heart, even if Xin Xuan had been allowed to flee on his own, he would never have escaped in the end!  

This barbarian from the Southern Wastelands had no idea of the methods employed by the factions of the Central Plains. Without their protection, he would have been captured long ago!  

"I foresaw this and have already made preparations. We can pin everything on the deceased Zhou Li afterward."  

The voice of the Moonpeak Sect Leader echoed from the bronze mirror. "Follow the original plan. Order Xin Xuan to reveal himself tonight and lure the hunters to him!"  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master hesitated. "Xin Xuan is skilled in using Gu insects and possesses a vast number of them. If he acts covertly, he can destroy an entire city—he is extremely dangerous. But in the open, he is merely a Qi Refinement cultivator."  

He paused before continuing, "Once his whereabouts are exposed, he stands no chance of escaping the encirclement unless he still has the treasure bestowed by the 'Creditor' to turn the tide..."  

"Enough! Carry out the order!"  

The voice from the bronze mirror cut him off, and the light within flickered before vanishing.  

The Law Enforcement Hall Master frowned but ultimately sighed, donning the mask of "Zhou Li" once more before leaving the courtyard.  

---  

At this moment, in the northeastern part of Xuanling Prefecture...  

Li Zhengjing carried a string of Buddhist beads, burying one every thirty li and marking the spot.  

"The southwest direction is where the Wall-Climbing Bird and the Five Elements Creation Tree went together."  

"If they encounter the Great Zhou army under the Chen family's orders, they can pretend to be ordinary creatures. No issue there."  

"Jia Shifang is armed with artifacts all over his body. Even if he encounters a Qi Refinement expert, he'll be fine."  

"As for me, I need to be cautious to avoid running into fellow disciples sent out on patrol, lest I'm charged with desertion."  

"Only three beads left..."  

Li Zhengjing pondered, thinking, *Xin Xuan's cultivation far surpasses mine, and now, all factions are determined to capture him.*  

He tallied the forces involved in this hunt—it was a massive operation.  

Apart from the sect's elders, even the chief true disciple, Lu Huaiyuan, had personally descended the mountain.  

The Kunlun Immortal Sect had sent their young sect master, once hailed as the strongest below the Human Immortal realm!  

The Diamond Temple had dispatched a Buddhist disciple!  

Under the watchful eyes of these top-tier experts, Xin Xuan had no chance of escape!  

*In such a situation, how can I kill him?*  

His focus shifted to the golden page in his mind. The "Fortune" section showed insufficient spiritual energy.  

Taking a deep breath, he retrieved two spirit stones and swallowed one.  

Only then did the complete method to alter his fate appear under the "Fortune" section.  

"Before the third quarter of the hour of Zi tonight, reach this location?"  

"The timing must be precise to the moment?"  

"Not even a single instant of deviation?"  

A strange expression crossed Li Zhengjing's face.  

At that moment, a green-horned, golden-feathered bird descended from the sky, clutching half a tree planted in a clay pot.  

"Master... we've planted all the beads..."  

"So fast?" Li Zhengjing looked up.  

"I'm always diligent," the Wall-Climbing Bird boasted. "Back when I studied, I rose at the crow of the rooster and never slacked."  

"When was this?" The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches in confusion. "I've had you perched on me for three years. How come I never knew?"  

"Blame the sect for not having roosters," the bird muttered, avoiding eye contact. "Otherwise, I wouldn't have been so lazy these past three years..."  

"Then you might as well rename yourself the White Phoenix Rooster," the tree retorted.  

"..."  

Before Li Zhengjing could speak, his brows suddenly raised as he looked toward the distant sky.  

A streak of light shot upward, illuminating the heavens.  

"That's..." The Wall-Climbing Bird gasped. "A Golden Order Soaring! An inner sect elder used Qi to propel the order into the sky... They've found Xin Xuan's trail!"  

Li Zhengjing murmured, "They've already found him? Then how am I supposed to kill him?"  

He glanced at the golden page and fell silent.  

"Master, aren't we going to claim a share?"  

The Wall-Climbing Bird was excited. "Even if we can't take him down, we can at least witness an epic battle!"  

"Our sect's chief true disciple and inner sect elders, the Great Zhou Dynasty's Qi Refinement experts, the Kunlun Sect's young master, and the Diamond Temple's Buddhist disciple—they'll all be there!"  

"They're all determined to capture Xin Xuan. There'll definitely be clashes. It'll be spectacular!"  

"If we're late, that Gu King might be torn apart, with each faction taking a piece!"  

The bird grew even more animated. "He's called the Gu King—he must have raised countless Gu insects. In the chaos, we can grab a few to roast..."  

Li Zhengjing checked the golden page's guidance and shook his head. "No. We head north!"  

"What?"  

The Five Elements Creation Tree waved its branches. "Xin Xuan's trail is south. We're going the wrong way..."  

"You illiterate twig!"  

The Wall-Climbing Bird scoffed. "This is called 'Northbound Against All Odds'! What would a tree know?"  

Then it whispered into Li Zhengjing's ear, "Master... we really are going the wrong way..."  

Li Zhengjing paused before replying, "A wise man does not stand beneath a crumbling wall. It's too dangerous there. The factions won't cooperate smoothly in capturing Xin Xuan. The chaos could easily spill over and claim bystanders. If we go, we might end up dying with him!"  

The bird faltered, muttering the phrase "A wise man does not stand beneath a crumbling wall." Feeling intellectually outmatched, it dared not argue further.  

Meanwhile...  

In Xuanling Prefecture, the Diamond Temple's Buddhist disciple gazed at the golden light piercing the sky.  

"Xin Xuan's trail has been exposed?"  

He flicked his sleeve, and his kasaya floated in the air.  

Leaping onto it, he rode toward the source of the golden light.  

Elsewhere, the Kunlun Sect's young master narrowed his eyes.  

"Another diversion, like in Jingye Prefecture? Using Gu insects to lure everyone away?"  

With a thought, he channeled Qi into his eyes, piercing through illusions to survey the battle unfolding dozens of li away.  

"Not a diversion. Xin Xuan has truly revealed himself?"  

Retracting his gaze, his expression turned icy. With a single step, he soared into the air.  

His eyes gleamed with anticipation.  

*A rat hiding in a ditch is hard to find.*  

*But a rat running into the open?*  

*One stomp is all it takes!*  

"What nonsense 'Southern Wasteland Gu King'?"  

The Kunlun young master smirked. *Under the Great Derivation Void-Severing Sword Qi, let's see if you can withstand a single strike from me!*
