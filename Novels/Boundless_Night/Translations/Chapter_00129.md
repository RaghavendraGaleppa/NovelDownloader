# Chapter 129: Rising Storm

"Alright, your mindset is quite good. I thought you'd be a bit nervous after being targeted by a direct descendant of the Cui family," Meng Xinghai praised.

"When Cui Hong came to Black-White Mountain to find me last time, ordered to confine me to that remote area for 'raising', I already knew this wouldn't be over," Qin Ming said. He was mentally prepared, familiar with their way of doing things.

Meng Xinghai nodded. "The cultivation method you're looking for has a formidable origin. It will be quite difficult to obtain all its scriptures. Its full name is the 'Evergreen World-Preserving Scripture'."

"World-Preserving Scripture?" Qin Ming was surprised. Just based on those last three characters, he knew this likely surpassed the scope of a mere wondrous technique.

Meng Xinghai informed him, "This is an extremely rare ancient text. Practitioners of this scripture can absorb the essence of mountains, rivers, and plants, greatly increasing their lifespan and maintaining eternal youth, allowing them to remain in the world for a very long time. It is exceptionally difficult to cultivate, but once mastered, it can extend one's life by up to 'half a lifetime'!"

"I've considered it. If they truly want to intervene and send someone, they will at least have to offer the 'Wood Essence Scripture', which is a condensed version of the secret canon, but still a wondrous technique in itself."

Qin Ming was not greedy. Even if he were given the full Evergreen World-Preserving Scripture at his current stage, he probably couldn't cultivate it. A single wondrous technique was enough for many to painstakingly cultivate their entire lives. He was sure that even Cui He himself had likely not fully mastered that ancient text; otherwise, his cultivation achievements would have soared, and he would have long been a renowned grand expert.

For the next two days, Qin Ming remained calm, without the tension typically preceding a major battle. The "duel" between the two cities was being systematically arranged. The "number one" chosen by Qi Daoming for Zhuoguang City was still kept confidential.

Meng Xinghai had stated beforehand that if Zhuoguang City's "number one" was an Outer Saint, then there would be no need for a duel. Chixia City would not participate if they intended to crush them with a higher realm.

"Oh, you always have a bias against me. Am I really that kind of person?" Qi Daoming replied in his letter.

"Yes!" Meng Xinghai's reply was a single word.

Qin Ming sat in meditation. With each breath, white light emerged from his mouth and nostrils. He felt all his pores open, feeling quite comfortable. This was the Jade Splendor Vigor, obtained from Li Tianhe, a registered disciple of the Jade Purity lineage. Practicing it once a day was like consuming a bowl of nourishing tonic. Although this analogy was exaggerated, persistent practice over many years would indeed continuously improve his physique.

Afterward, he began to practice the Tiger Roar. Instantly, his internal organs seemed to roar like wild beasts, vibrating subtly. If others knew that he had only begun to comprehend it a few days ago and had already completely cultivated the technique to resonate within his internal organs, they would be utterly astonished. In the Land Near Immortals, the Outer Saint who had exchanged cultivation methods with Qin Ming once said that making the internal organs emit a tiger roar was extremely difficult, not to be expected for several years. In the initial stage, one could only vibrate the throat, allowing external sounds to enter the body. Directly producing internal sounds was something even extraordinary individuals with peerless talent might not be able to achieve.

Qin Ming's body slightly sweated from this; the effect was very obvious. This was tempering his internal organs. The tiger roars continued, starting from the viscera and spreading towards his flesh and blood. It was strengthening his internal organs and stimulating the vitality of his flesh and blood.

Qin Ming realized that this was an underestimated cultivation method! He had exchanged it thinking it was an ordinary Heaven's Light Vigor technique, never expecting such an extraordinary effect. For a moment, his thoughts ran wild. According to that Outer Saint, there was also the "Five Thunder Organ Tempering Art" above it, and even higher, the "Eight Sceneries Divine Illumination Art". This gave Qin Ming quite a few ideas; he must diligently seek them out in the future.

Afterward, he went on to practice the incantation taught by Li Qingyue, as well as the method recorded in the very thin booklet passed down by Meng Xinghai's grand-uncle-master. Indeed, the spiritual light of consciousness and divine wisdom Qin Ming cultivated could still only accumulate a small amount; most of it was absorbed by his flesh and blood, slowly improving his physique.

Finally, he resumed cultivating the method from the depths of the Night Fog World. Although currently, he only possessed three pages of the scripture, they formed the general outline. It could extend life, change one's bone structure, and even sweep away the dust from one's heart.

Qin Ming's Heaven's Light Vigor was full of Yang energy, very unfriendly to otherworldly beings, like a great sun traversing the sky, casting its illuminating rays. Such Heaven's Light Vigor circulated and expanded within his flesh and blood, forming a dense web, reaching all parts of his body, creating a complete cycle. Qin Ming's body was illuminated from within. The Heaven's Light Vigor flowed ceaselessly, pouring into various channels, like golden rivers traversing the night-fog-shrouded land, dispelling darkness. These golden rivers were like pioneers, spreading throughout his body, bringing golden light to the waiting, cultivated land of his flesh and blood, breaking through the darkness and manifesting vitality.

These were Qin Ming's daily required lessons. They didn't take much time, but over time, subtly, his already astonishing innate talent could still be further enhanced! He decided to persevere in his practice, come rain or shine. Moreover, the next time he fused Heaven's Light Vigor, Qin Ming planned to do his utmost to see if he could also unify these "internal strengthening" cultivation methods with the Silk Scroll Method.

While awaiting the "duel" between the two cities, Qin Ming also paid attention to news from the outside world. The grand examinations across various regions were progressing in an orderly fashion, now reaching their later stages and attracting increasing attention. This was because in different regions, in various cities, those outstanding and remarkably talented young men and women were beginning to emerge and gradually become known. The so-called unified examination was merely the first stage, which was the same every year and relatively uneventful. It was only in the final stages, when geniuses were filtered out and various prodigies appeared, that it would cause a sensation and draw people's attention.

In recent days, local night reports had been increasing their coverage because the "number ones" of various cities had almost all appeared. There were even friendly "sparring sessions" already taking place between different cities.

"Mountain Master, I've taken care of my family affairs. When you leave Chixia City, my brood of children should be ready to leave the nest. We birds grow fast. Can I, little Yuque, follow you?" Yuque flew in, entering the City Lord's manor. Qin Ming currently resided there; Meng Xinghai, fearing for his safety, didn't allow him to stay outside.

"You're abandoning your wife and children; this is clearly scumbag-bird behavior!" Qin Ming looked at the highly "ambitious" Yuque, wanting to lecture it.

Yuque, with its deep blue feathers and eyes like black diamonds, showed an innocent expression and said, "We birds are naturally like this. We reproduce every spring, and then go our separate ways. You can't impose human moral standards on a bird." Then it added, "Besides, the spiritual substance you gave me, Mountain Master, was very rich, too much for a little sparrow. I shared it with my wife and children, and even after dilution, it allowed them all to evolve once. Now, all the Yuque sparrows on Black-White Mountain say I'm a great husband and father, with fatherly love as vast as a mountain."

Qin Ming truly didn't know how to evaluate it. This "scumbag-bird" had actually become a radiant "model bird."

"The Rise of a Young Grandmaster..." He continued reading the night report and couldn't help but be surprised. There was actually such a high evaluation, mentioning a young man from Liuguang City, who was remarkably brilliant in his region, praising him without reservation.

"Liuguang City, Master Wu is there," Yuque blinked, mentioning the purple-eyed raven it encountered on Black-White Mountain, and the mysterious woman Tang Jin, who wore a black fur cloak.

"Could it really be the successor of that special sect Master Wu pledged allegiance to?" Yuque leaned over, looking at the report with him. It actually knew how to read! No wonder it said it had developed divinity and wanted to embark on the path to godhood. This bird was indeed quite unusual.

Qin Ming said, "If they are disciples of that sect, would they still need to participate in such a grand examination and compete with people from other cities?"

Yuque nodded, saying, "Master Wu briefly mentioned that the sect it serves is extraordinarily powerful, and in the early stages, it requires various practical combat experiences to improve oneself." Then, it lowered its voice, "That black-clothed woman, Tang Jin, her master is incredibly formidable. Otherwise, how could Master Wu willingly pledge allegiance to him? It's said that this person is forging a new path and might even become a Patriarch-level figure!"

Qin Ming read on and found that the night report spoke very highly of the young man, saying that every movement, every stance, was exquisitely perfect, already possessing the demeanor of a rare young grandmaster!

Yuque hesitated for a moment, "Mountain Master, I'll tell you a piece of news, but don't get angry."

"Go ahead," Qin Ming looked at it.

"As far as I know, that woman in the black cloak, although her true face is unbelievably beautiful, well..."

Qin Ming said, "Why are you being coy? Just say it directly. I won't get angry."

Yuque revealed the secret, "You actually fell into her sight back then too. However, she didn't seem to favor you and chose someone else as her teacher's direct disciple. Most likely, it's this young grandmaster mentioned in the night report."

Qin Ming nodded and simply hummed. What was there to be angry about? After experiencing so many things, such missed opportunities no longer stirred ripples in his heart.

"Let's go, it's time to depart," Meng Xinghai arrived, informing Qin Ming that they were going to Zhuoguang City, an "away game" situation. He smiled as he mentioned that the "stake" this time was quite good. If they won, the other party would probably feel very heartbroken.

"You consumed the Five-Colored Spiritual Branch last time, and its effect was extraordinary, wasn't it? It originated from a blessed land, from a treasure tree rooted in the Heaven's Light Pool. That was just its tender new sprout from early spring. This time, the stake Qi Daoming is offering is a 'fallen fruit' from that old tree."

Zhuoguang City was similar in scale to Chixia City. The two cities were not far apart, only four hundred li, and Qin Ming and Meng Xinghai quickly arrived by flying mount.

"Elder Li!" Qin Ming saw Li Qingyun here. He hadn't expected him to come as well.

"Fight to your heart's content, no one will dare to cause trouble," Li Qingyun said with a smile. His hair was snow-white and sparkling, and his face was rosy, making him appear especially amiable and benevolent. He was reassuring Qin Ming, and it also implied that there was probably some issue, but since he had personally come, there should be no problem.

"Someone tried to interfere?" He looked at Meng Xinghai and Li Qingyun, asking in secret.

"Not exactly. It's fine now," Meng Xinghai didn't elaborate.

In Zhuoguang City, many people were discussing the upcoming duel. At the same time, people also mentioned remarkable individuals from other places.

"A young grandmaster actually rose in Liuguang City, that's absurd!"

"Can our Zhuoguang City win against Chixia City in this duel? Can we even contend with that young grandmaster?"

"Are you dreaming? What is a young grandmaster? Like a bright moon high in the sky! How can Zhuoguang City and Chixia City's 'candlelight' compare!"

...

Qin Ming and Meng Xinghai walked down the street, overhearing these discussions. Clearly, the duels in various regions had sparked heated debate, and all parties were beginning to pay attention.

The next day, Qin Ming arrived for the duel, ready to face Zhuoguang City's "number one."

"Qingyue will be here to watch the battle," Meng Xinghai told Qin Ming. Li Qingyue had brought the complete text of that mysterious ancient scripture and had secretly arrived in Zhuoguang City.
