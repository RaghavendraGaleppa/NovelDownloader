**Chapter 6: Uncle-Master Li**

Logically, talismans are so difficult to craft that talisman crafters should be rare. However, in reality, among the four most sought-after professions, talisman crafters are the most numerous. This is because there are simply too many types of talismans, and the crafting method for each is quite different. Even a grandmaster talisman crafter who has reached a high standard in crafting certain talismans would find their success rate significantly lower when switching to a different type, though perhaps not as low as a complete novice. Therefore, most talisman crafters can only skillfully produce a limited number of talisman types.

Upon receiving this information, Zhao Di felt he had a certain opportunity. In his previous life, he was quite versatile, especially enjoying drawing and painting during his studies!

“Crafting talismans is just drawing some strange symbols, isn't it? I'm sure I can draw them well!”

Seeing a glimmer of hope, Zhao Di quickly made up his mind to become a self-sufficient junior talisman crafter.

To craft talismans, one must first learn the corresponding spells. This is undeniable. The Jian family had dedicated elders responsible for teaching children above the third level of Qi Condensation how to use some basic Five Elements spells. Zhao Di originally had the chance to learn spells several years ago, but he felt that while those techniques were flashy and powerful, they offered no help to his own cultivation. If he had ample time, he would certainly have been willing to learn a few practical spells, but back then, he diligently cultivated seventeen or eighteen hours a day. Where would he find the time to study spells?

Now that he had paused his rigorous cultivation, he finally had some time. However, learning several spells and practicing talisman crafting within a year, he wasn't sure if it would be enough time. Zhao Di wasn't confident about it; he could only do his best. He had heard that even Jian Kun, who possessed excellent cultivation aptitude, took three months to learn two of the simplest spells. If Zhao Di's talent for learning spells was as poor as his spiritual root aptitude, he might not even learn one spell in a year.

With an uneasy heart, Zhao Di arrived at the "Skill Transmission Pavilion." It was a vast courtyard, hundreds of *zhang* wide, with extremely simple furnishings. Aside from a small hexagonal pavilion in the center and a small pond in the eastern corner, there were just various shapes and sizes of stones scattered all over the ground. Inside the pavilion, a square-faced middle-aged cultivator with thick eyebrows and large eyes was explaining some techniques and mysteries of the "Fire Serpent Art." Three seventeen or eighteen-year-old youths sat attentively around the square-faced cultivator, none of them noticing Zhao Di's arrival. The "Fire Serpent Art" was a mid-level Qi Condensation spell that only cultivators at or above the seventh or eighth level of Qi Condensation could master. It was not Zhao Di's goal today, but he wisely stood silently to the side, listening carefully, not daring to disturb them in the slightest.

This square-faced cultivator was one of the few Jian family cultivators responsible for teaching basic Five Elements spells. His surname wasn't Jian, but Li, and children like Zhao Di all called him Uncle-Master Li. It was said that Uncle-Master Li was not originally a Jian family cultivator but a rogue cultivator with no sect or faction. In his youth, he coincidentally met a female Jian family cultivator, and the two immediately became good friends, quickly forming a dual cultivation partnership to jointly comprehend the Great Dao of Immortality. Uncle-Master Li thus came to the Jian family. Unfortunately, not many years later, Uncle-Master Li's partner tragically perished during a family mission. From then on, Uncle-Master Li became disheartened, finding it difficult to continue his cultivation. He remained in the Jian family, teaching the younger generation to live out the rest of his days.

Uncle-Master Li had an excellent reputation among the younger generation. Not only did he possess profound and unique insights into the basic Five Elements spells, but he was also incredibly patient, always demonstrating repeatedly until the younger generation could understand and apply them, never scolding or yelling at them. Whenever Uncle-Master Li appeared at the Skill Transmission Pavilion, many people would go to listen. Zhao Di had specifically rushed there because he knew it was Uncle-Master Li's turn on duty at the Skill Transmission Pavilion today. He had even intentionally chosen the afternoon, when there were usually fewer people, yet unexpectedly, three other youths were still there.

After Uncle-Master Li finished a section of his explanation, the three youths asked some more questions, and Uncle-Master Li answered each one in detail. More than two hours later, the three youths reluctantly bid farewell to Uncle-Master Li and returned to their respective practices. Before leaving, one of the youths recognized Zhao Di and mocked him, saying, “Oh, isn't this Brother Five Roots? You're here to learn spells too? Don't waste too much of our Uncle-Master Li's time.”

Even with Zhao Di's thirty-plus years of experience, hearing this ridicule made his face flush slightly. Uncle-Master Li, however, paid it no mind. After asking about Zhao Di's spiritual root attributes and other basic information, as well as his purpose for being there, he encouraged Zhao Di: “Learning spells is quite different from cultivating spiritual power. The former is about how to use spiritual power, while the latter is about how to gather spiritual qi and convert it into one's own spiritual power. Generally speaking, spell usage is a matter of practice making perfect. You can master them with more practice, and it doesn't have much to do with spiritual root attributes. As long as you compensate for your shortcomings with diligence, you can quickly master one or more low-level spells. As for mid-level or higher Qi Condensation spells, your cultivation is insufficient, and you don't have enough spiritual power to use them, so you cannot learn them yet. What spell do you want to learn now? You possess all five spiritual roots, so you can learn any low-level Five Elements spell. However, I suggest you start with the simplest, the Fireball Art, and progress gradually. That would be more suitable.”

“Thank you for your encouragement, Uncle-Master. As you suggested, this nephew will start with the Fireball Art.” Zhao Di had been in the Jian family for so long that it was rare to hear someone speak to him without mockery, and he felt quite touched. It seemed Uncle-Master Li's character truly was as good as everyone said.

Next, Zhao Di began practicing the Fireball Art under Uncle-Master Li's guidance. Uncle-Master Li first concisely explained the method of utilizing the spiritual power within the *dantian*, then recited the incantation for the Fireball Art once. The incantation wasn't very long, and Zhao Di carefully listened once and memorized it firmly. Afterward, Uncle-Master Li told Zhao Di to go back and begin practicing, instructing him to come find him anytime if he had any questions.

Zhao Di bowed in gratitude to Uncle-Master Li. Upon returning to his quiet room, he eagerly began practicing the Fireball Art according to the incantation. He easily mobilized a wisp of spiritual power from his *dantian*, guiding it through certain meridians in his body to the tip of his right index finger as the incantation instructed. However, he found it very difficult to release the spiritual power from his fingertip out of his body. After trying more than ten times consecutively, Zhao Di felt a significant depletion of spiritual power and was somewhat fatigued. He dared not attempt more, calming his mind to meditate overnight to fully restore his spiritual power.

For the next few days, Zhao Di continuously attempted to force spiritual power out from his fingertip according to the incantation, but he consistently failed. Every day consisted of nothing but practice and meditative rest; this continued for seven or eight days straight. Just as he was growing increasingly frustrated and on the verge of giving up, planning to seek guidance from Uncle-Master Li, a casual practice session suddenly yielded a breakthrough. He distinctly felt a wisp of spiritual power surge out from his fingertip, forming a small spatial ripple above it. Then, with a 'sizzle', a small, inch-long flame appeared as if the nearby air had ignited. Although this small flame only lasted for a few breaths before its spiritual power was exhausted and it vanished, it greatly surprised Zhao Di, making him practice the spell even more diligently.

He didn't know if this unexpected success had "opened his insight," but his subsequent practices became smoother; almost every time he could ignite flames of varying sizes. Finally, when he was almost a month into cultivating the Fireball Art, Zhao Di successfully released a complete small fireball. Although its diameter was only a little over an inch, it signified that he had at last initially mastered this spell. Mastering his first spell in just one month, while not a world-shattering feat, still greatly startled many who had looked down on Zhao Di.

Upon hearing of this, Uncle-Master Li praised Zhao Di even more, often using his example to encourage younger generations with poor aptitudes. For a time, Zhao Di also became a topic of discussion among the masses. Some said that although his spiritual roots were extremely poor, he might possess a higher talent in learning spells. Of course, these discussions only lasted for a short period, quickly replaced by the astonishing progress of some talented younger generations within the family.

Only Zhao Di himself knew that he had no special talent; at most, he was just ordinary. When others learned spells, they cultivated Qi Condensation while simultaneously studying spells. They would never completely stop their cultivation like him, dedicating themselves wholeheartedly to learning a single spell. Although he only studied for one month, his practice sessions were only more numerous than others, never fewer.
