# Chapter 20: Blending Light with Dust

In the shallow night, Qin Ming, carrying a long-handled dark gold hammer and a short sword, moved as if his feet were winged, charging into the dense forest at an extremely fast pace, almost lifting off the ground.

He felt a sense of urgency. The nobles from Scarlet Cloud City had arrived, and once they entered the mountains, they would surely search for various spiritual substances. He didn't want the Blood Bamboo Forest to be preempted; it was crucial for his second Rebirth.

The night fog had dispersed, and the forest remained somewhat dim, but with his eyesight, he could clearly discern distant objects.

"The Blood Bamboo Forest won't be easy to enter. There must still be dangers." Otherwise, Feng Yi'an and Shao Chengfeng would have acted long ago; why wait until their deaths to leave regrets?

"I'm a little agitated." Cold snowflakes drifted onto him, some even entering his neck. This chill gradually calmed Qin Ming. His hurried travel just now was no different from old man Liu last night, wishing he had wings to fly into the Blood Bamboo Forest to pick up frozen blood snakes.

"Calm my mind." Qin Ming slowed his pace, adjusting his breathing in the mountain forest. It was just a second Rebirth, wasn't it? Even without obtaining spiritual substances, he could still break through successfully with his own conditions.

"An unstable mind easily makes mistakes." Qin Ming stepped on the thick snow, proceeding unhurriedly, gradually becoming composed and calm. The Blood Bamboo Forest must be quite dangerous. With a second Reborn like Fu Entao, even the Mountain Patrol Team hesitated to act, which was enough to prove the point.

Qin Ming moved silently through the dense forest. Eventually, he dug out the blade manual from a certain spot. The old leather pages were curled and heavily worn, indicating frequent past perusal. The entire book was not thick, exuding an ancient charm, and Qin Ming wondered where Fu Entao had obtained it.

"Read the crystallization of the predecessors' efforts to calm my mind." Qin Ming sat down in the forest. A moment later, he was completely engrossed, fully immersed in the book. Unknowing, he stood up from the snow, holding the leather book in one hand and gripping the long-handled dark gold hammer in the other, wielding it like a long blade.

This was originally a heavy weapon, but in his hands, it was like a light wooden hammer, swung freely, and gradually took on a natural, artistic beauty. To undergo Rebirth, one needed to practice corresponding scriptures, such as the Dark Night Meditation Art or Qi Energy Cultivation, which could enhance physical qualities like strength, flexibility, and speed. Various combat techniques, on the other hand, were skills that utilized the body's strength and speed to achieve efficient attacks.

Qin Ming's physical quality was exceptionally strong, surpassing even a golden foundation. However, his combat techniques hadn't undergone systematic training; most were practical, loose forms. Some were derived from the unorthodox Rebirth methods he had practiced for years, extracted from special movements, while others were learned from old hunters in the village. His combat ability was very strong, honed in the great mountains.

The forest at night was dangerous. Hunting in such an environment meant facing attacks from various fierce birds and beasts; a half-second delay in reaction meant death. Although what he practiced was mostly loose forms, even describable as unorthodox, their lethality was truly immense. Fighting for his life against wild beasts, he followed no rules, relying on strength, speed, and on-the-spot adaptability.

It was precisely because of this that Fu Entao found him exceptionally tricky; he couldn't find any "fixed patterns" in Qin Ming's attacks, making them unpredictable. Now, as Qin Ming read the blade manual, combining it with his experiences fighting ferocious beasts and his insights from life-and-death situations, he became utterly engrossed. Unconsciously, he held the book in one hand and the hammer in the other, continuously changing his "blade forms" based on his understanding.

Qin Ming absorbed the insights of the predecessors from the blade manual. When fully immersed, he increased the force of his movements. Although there was no visible blade light, a blade intent permeated the air, causing the snow on the ground to fly into the sky. The long-handled dark gold hammer transformed into a flash of lightning, shattering the forest's tranquility.

He "slashed" at a large tree. Instantly, the thick trunk exploded. This "slash" was simply too violent. Some strange creatures that had been lurking nearby, eyeing him menacingly for a long time, were now all scared and fled with their tails between their legs. This included a mutated black tiger, over four meters long, which now turned its head and ran.

"Still daring to peek here? Not leaving?" Qin Ming saw a human-faced vulture, much larger than its kind, circling close to the trees, about twenty meters from the ground, stubbornly refusing to leave. He had just comprehended the "Throwing Blade Form" from the book and immediately executed it. The heavy "hammer-blade" in his hand instantly vanished into the night, soaring high into the sky.

"Pfft!" Blood splattered in mid-air, and feathers rained down. The mutated human-faced vulture, with a wingspan of several meters, had been quite fierce, but now it was as fragile as porcelain, shattered by Qin Ming's "Throwing Blade Form"! His arms possessed the strength of a thousand catties, so there was no suspense in such a strike. The long-handled dark gold hammer smashed the gigantic fierce beast into pieces, utterly broken, with large chunks of flesh and scattered feathers falling to the ground.

Some other strange creatures in the distance witnessed this scene and immediately bolted, feeling that this bipedal human-beast was exceptionally ferocious and must be avoided. This area was no longer safe.

"What excellent blade techniques!" Qin Ming exclaimed, picking up the long-handled dark gold hammer and practicing again. For him, this blade manual was like a bright lamp in the night fog, illuminating his path and swiftly elevating his various practical experiences and unorthodox combat methods by integrating them. Qin Ming was utterly absorbed, even forgetting himself by the end, unable to extricate himself.

He practiced all the blade forms from beginning to end. While not achieving complete enlightenment, his combat skills certainly improved, and his strength significantly increased. This blade manual was worth studying, giving him profound insights and being of extremely high value!

"If Fu Entao had thoroughly mastered this blade manual, he would indeed be very troublesome," Qin Ming muttered to himself. However, if he could fully comprehend this book, Fu Entao wouldn't have stopped at the second Rebirth. This was more than just a blade manual; it also contained some research on Rebirth methods, which greatly inspired him.

For example, the book mentioned "Heavenly Light," which first appears during the third Rebirth but will permeate the entire Rebirth domain. Even after Rebirth is complete, one cannot do without deep research into Heavenly Light. Heavenly Light, in this era where the sun has disappeared, embodies people's beautiful hopes and carries infinite aspirations.

The Heavenly Light mentioned in the book is naturally not the light of the sky people yearn for, but a light within the body, given a beautiful name by people. When a person undergoes their third Rebirth, they will initially manifest this "Heavenly Light." It is born within the body, a sign of the elevation of life's essence. At this point, the Reborn's strength will significantly increase, allowing them to fight various dangerous strange creatures bare-handed, and all of this is bestowed by "Heavenly Light."

Because, once Heavenly Light is born in the body, "Heavenly Light Energy" will appear. This is a special kind of energy with extremely strong penetrative and tearing abilities. Otherwise, how could Reborns, with their delicate and small bodies compared to giant beasts, contend with such enormous creatures? The appearance of Heavenly Light Energy allows Reborns to tear open the scales of mutated giant beasts; this energy can penetrate their tough, solid flesh.

However, in the Rebirth domain, Heavenly Light Energy can only be applied to the body surface, extending slightly beyond the fists and feet, and cannot yet extend to weapons. In fact, Heavenly Light Energy is just a general term; it can be subdivided into many types. This book must have passed through many owners, as there are various insights, notes, and annotations on its pages, all from different hands. Among them, some highly praised a certain type of Heavenly Light Energy, leaving a sigh: "How I wish I could cultivate the Tathagata Energy!"

For a Reborn like Qin Ming, who came from an unorthodox background, the various records and descriptions in the book made him yearn for them. Unfortunately, although this blade manual mentioned the names of some strange and powerful Heavenly Light Energies, it did not record how to cultivate them at all. Qin Ming was somewhat lost in thought, pondering for a long time.

Further turning the pages of this blade manual was somewhat unsuitable for him to read; he had not yet reached that level. However, among the insights left by his predecessors, he discovered a very practical secret method called "Blending Light with Dust," which could ensure one's safety. After carefully studying it, he couldn't help but break into a cold sweat and felt somewhat fortunate to have found this record.

According to the predecessors, the gaze of higher-level beings is terrifying; they can see through the strength of other beings' vital energy with a single glance, even in the deep night, they can "see" those strong or weak bio-fields. This is frightening; lower-level beings have no secrets from higher-level ones. Especially when Heavenly Light is born within a Reborn or a strange creature, to higher-level beings, it's like a cluster of flames in the dark night.

"I must cultivate this quickly!" He wiped a cold sweat, suddenly feeling very dangerous in the mountains. Fortunately, Blending Light with Dust was merely a practical secret method, not some profound, difficult-to-practice, abstruse classic.

"Meditate on stillness and emptiness, body like a withered tree, mind like cold ashes, obscuring vital energy, gradually becoming faint, also making the spirit and qi obscure." He slowly gained some comprehension, already having entered the initial stage. Qin Ming sat there quietly for a long time, silently comprehending and pondering, gradually discovering more intricacies. Blending Light with Dust could conceal a portion of one's vital energy, allowing one to blend in with ordinary people. Moreover, this "degree" could be controlled. After reaching a certain level, even if Heavenly Light was born in the body after the third Rebirth, it could be concealed if needed.

At this point, Qin Ming let out a long breath. However, upon careful thought, he couldn't help but laugh wryly. Perhaps his sense of crisis was too strong. Even if a higher-level being passed by, capable of seeing through his vital energy, they probably wouldn't care, right? After all, he had only undergone Rebirth once; in the eyes of such strange creatures, he was still just one of the "multitudes" in the mountains.

He then thought of the high-ranking officials of Scarlet Cloud City. Since they could negotiate and confront the mysterious beings in the mountains, they should also possess equivalent abilities, right?

"Don't bite off more than you can chew. Learning this much today is enough. I need to consolidate, master, and firmly grasp everything!" Qin Ming stood up, found a secluded spot, and reburied the blade manual. Undoubtedly, he had gained immensely today. After carefully studying those blade forms and integrating his own insights, his strength had significantly increased.

Qin Ming muttered to himself, "If I were to encounter Fu Entao or Feng Yi'an now and fight again, I think it would be much easier." Most importantly, this book broadened his horizons, allowing him to learn many things he couldn't access before.

"Fu Entao isn't so bad after all; he gave me a good book." After leaving this dense forest, he headed towards the Blood Bamboo Forest.
