# Chapter 28: Minor Achievement in Body Cultivation  

After more than three months, Li Wanqing successfully broke through the bottleneck of the ninth level of Qi Refining and advanced to the tenth level!  

From here, all he needed was to patiently cultivate his spiritual energy to naturally reach the Great Perfection realm, granting him the opportunity to attempt Foundation Establishment!  

Considering that Li Wanqing had only broken through to the ninth level of Qi Refining less than a year ago, this closed-door breakthrough was nothing short of a miracle!  

At the Misty Ridge Mountain, in Li Wanqing’s cave abode.  

When Wei Qian saw Li Wanqing’s current state, he was stunned.  

Li Wanqing’s face was tinged with purple, and his aura fluctuated erratically—sometimes weak, sometimes strong. His condition was far from that of a normal breakthrough.  

After emerging from seclusion, Li Wanqing summoned Wei Qian once to inquire about the state of the Spirit Peach Grove before dismissing him again. Having just broken through, he still needed time to stabilize his cultivation.  

On his way down the mountain, Wei Qian’s thoughts naturally drifted. In the past, he wouldn’t have understood how Li Wanqing had managed to break through a whole level in just three months or why he appeared in such a state.  

But now, with the foundational knowledge of alchemy he had acquired and the miscellaneous books he had read, Wei Qian was certain—Li Wanqing’s breakthrough was due to consuming the breakthrough pill, *Purple Mist Elixir*.  

This pill was notoriously potent. A Qi Refining cultivator who consumed it could directly advance by one level.  

If a cultivator in the early stages of Qi Refining took it and survived, they might even break through two levels at once.  

"The medicinal potency of this pill is immense. Judging by Li Wanqing’s condition, he clearly hasn’t fully refined the elixir’s effects yet," Wei Qian concluded.  

Regardless, with time, Li Wanqing would gradually refine the remaining medicinal energy and soon reach the Great Perfection realm.  

By then, the Li Clan would have two Great Perfection Qi Refining cultivators—Patriarch Li Wanlong and Elder Li Wanqing!  

The next Li Clan ancestor to reach Foundation Establishment would likely be one of these two.  

"If the Li Clan obtained a Foundation Establishment Pill, who would it be given to?" Wei Qian couldn’t help but ponder.  

Personally, he hoped it would be Elder Li Wanqing. After all, Wei Qian could be considered part of his faction.  

Naturally, the stronger Li Wanqing became and the higher his status within the Li Clan, the more Wei Qian and others aligned with him would benefit.  

If Li Wanqing became a Foundation Establishment expert, he would undoubtedly dedicate much of his time to furthering his own cultivation.  

At that point, Wei Qian might even be assigned to work in the Spirit Herb Garden.  

"Still, even if I enter the Spirit Herb Garden, I wouldn’t be able to freely take herbs to refine pills..." Wei Qian rubbed his temples in frustration.  

---  

If he couldn’t figure it out, there was no point dwelling on it. No need to suffer needless headaches.  

After seven days of rest, Wei Qian’s life returned to its usual rhythm.  

First, he made a wish—to replenish the power of his *Frostlight Needle*. The response was that it would take twenty-seven days of prayer. Less than a month—quite a bargain.  

Second, Bai Fugui had visited during this time, bringing cultivation pills and medicinal herbs for Wei Qian.  

Alchemy could wait. The second most important task now was to advance his body cultivation.  

Once the *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art* reached the Minor Achievement stage, he would possess physical strength comparable to a mid-stage Qi Refining cultivator—a significant boost to his safety and future prospects.  

Twenty-seven days later, the *Frostlight Needle* was fully restored.  

Rather than further enhancing the needle, Wei Qian wished for an improvement in his body cultivation.  

Thanks to the large amount of spirit stones spent on medicinal baths, the [Wishing Dragon Pearl] responded with a fifty-day timeframe.  

Fifty days—that was all it would take to break through to a body cultivation level equivalent to mid-stage Qi Refining!  

Overjoyed, Wei Qian patiently waited on Misty Ridge Mountain, venturing down only once during this period.  

That single trip was prompted by a message from Lu Ping, who had come to bid farewell. He was preparing to leave for the rogue cultivator’s holy land—Black Flood Dragon Immortal City—to seek his fortune.  

Wei Qian still remembered his words to Lu Ping: "Forgive my bluntness, but your unique talent in talisman arts makes you stand out too much among rogue cultivators."  

"Why not join the [Myriad Stars Sect]?"  

The [Myriad Stars Sect] was the only Nascent Soul-level force in the Zhao Kingdom’s cultivation world, holding supreme authority.  

Lu Ping’s Blood Talisman Spirit Body would attract covetous eyes elsewhere, but within the [Myriad Stars Sect], not only would he be shielded from malicious intentions, but he would also have a high chance of receiving guidance from senior sect members—ensuring a bright future.  

Yet Lu Ping only smiled bitterly and replied, "I come from a clan of sinners..."  

Hearing this, Wei Qian immediately understood and said no more.  

"Black Flood Dragon Immortal City lies thirty-eight thousand miles away. May your journey be smooth, fellow Daoist!" Wei Qian offered his sincere blessings.  

Lu Ping had repaid the five hundred spirit stones he owed before leaving, which greatly improved Wei Qian’s impression of him.  

After all, if Lu Ping had simply fled with the debt, Wei Qian would have had no way to chase him across thirty-eight thousand miles to the lawless Black Flood Dragon Immortal City.  

"May your words prove auspicious," Lu Ping clasped his hands in gratitude before turning to leave.  

---  

Watching Lu Ping’s retreating figure, Wei Qian felt a sudden stirring in his heart.  

He had a vague sense that their fates were not yet severed—they would meet again someday. But whether that would be in a few years, a decade, or several decades, he couldn’t say.  

Shaking off the memory, Wei Qian returned to the present.  

At the moment, he was soaking in a large wooden tub filled with warm water, its surface covered in floating medicinal herbs.  

The medicinal essence seeped into the water, clinging to his skin and gradually being absorbed by his body.  

"Just half a month more, and my body cultivation will break through!" Wei Qian thought.  

But he had one concern—would he even have that time?  

Recently, the atmosphere on Misty Ridge Mountain had grown tense. Clan members and elders who had been away were returning one after another.  

Li Wanqing had successfully reached the Great Perfection realm and had been meeting with many clan members, seemingly rallying support to secure the right to consume the Foundation Establishment Pill.  

This was the calm before the storm!  

"Just give me a little more time," Wei Qian prayed to the heavens—a rare act for him.  

Perhaps his prayers were answered, or maybe it was just luck, but Wei Qian achieved the Minor Achievement stage of the *Thousand Tribulations Body Tempering Art* two days ahead of schedule!  

The exhilaration was beyond words!  

"Now, I’ll feel much safer when venturing outside."  

Of course, the most effective way to boost his sense of security was still the Dragon Pearl’s divination. Wei Qian trusted it more than anything else.  

He made a wish to the Dragon Pearl—to return safely and unharmed to Misty Ridge Mountain—and soon received a response.  

Fourteen days of prayer!  

"It seems the danger this time really isn’t that great." Wei Qian sighed in relief.  

Indeed, encountering a demonic path Golden Core True Person last time had been a freak accident. How could he possibly run into such misfortunes every time? He had simply been overthinking things!
