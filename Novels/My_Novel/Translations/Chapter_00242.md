Chapter 242: Rising on the Crimson List, the Husband Steals and the Wife Runs Amok

Li Xian found the days peaceful and began to roughly plan his journey south. Before setting out, he needed to accumulate money, so he went into the fields to catch fish, shrimp, crabs, and eels... taking them to the county town to exchange for cash.

After several days of hard work, he had saved a dozen or so copper coins, but it was still far from enough for travel expenses. He turned his attention to the county office's "Crimson List," hoping to capture a fugitive for the reward.

Suddenly, he heard that a new list had been posted. Li Xian informed Wen Caishang and immediately set off for the county administration, heading straight for the bustling market's bulletin board. The crowd was dense, forming a wall of people. With his agile movement technique, Li Xian made his way to the front of the board.

His eyes scanned the list and he suddenly froze. Two portraits were particularly eye-catching, bearing a seventy percent resemblance to Li Xian and Wen Caishang, but with added malevolence. The details of the eyebrows, eyes, mouth, and face shape... were manipulated to add a sense of sinister, bloodthirsty madness. The painting was exquisite, crafted with great care.

Below the portraits, written in vermilion brush, were the titles: "Heart-Eating Young Master, Li Ren Shan" and "Blood-Drinking Vicious Woman, Wen Snake Scorpion."

A bailiff pasting up the notices said, "Fellow townsfolk, come and take a look. See if these two have appeared nearby."

A spectator asked, "Official, what did these two do?"

The bailiff replied, "The husband is a thief and the wife runs amok; they have committed every evil deed imaginable! Li Ren Shan carves out people's hearts and livers, while Wen Snake Scorpion severs their hands and feet. In the past half month, the two have traveled through several villages, leaving behind a trail of gruesome atrocities. It is enough to make gods and men alike furious; the scenes are too horrible to behold!"

"In short... everyone, be on your guard. If you have any information, report it quickly. These two are extremely dangerous. If you're not careful, the consequences will be dire!"

The commoners all cursed the adulterous pair, feeling a great deal of fear.

It all started because...

After the defeat at the Sea of Flowers, Su Qiuwu, Zhao Zhiyuan, and the others felt deeply humiliated. After tallying the dead and wounded, their rage became uncontrollable. They went mad, searching everywhere, but to little effect.

After several days, their anger gradually subsided. Su Qiuwu, Li Quan, Zhao Zhiyuan, and the others gathered to discuss a strategy, sitting around a table and talking by candlelight.

The night passed with little result. Li Xian was cunning and clever, far surpassing Su Qiuwu. Su Qiuwu was frustrated and dejected, and everyone else felt sullen and wronged.

Li Quan slammed the table and cursed, "That bastard小子, ruined my grand plan! I wish I could pull out his tendons and peel his skin!"

The speaker meant no harm, but the listener took it to heart.

Su Qiuwu's eyes flashed, and a vicious plan suddenly came to him. He muttered, "Pull out his tendons, peel his skin?" Li Quan cursed, "What of it?" Su Qiuwu smiled and said, "I have a brilliant plan, but... it's extremely ruthless. Are you all willing to hear it?"

Zhao Zhiyuan said with deep concern, "If you have one, please speak quickly. Otherwise, with Wen Caishang's temperament, she will surely come looking for us in the future!" He had glimpsed a fraction of Wen Caishang's methods and found it hard to sleep.

Su Qiuwu said, "Our biggest problem is that we can't find that小子. After he broke out of the encirclement, he was incredibly cunning, managing to leave no trace... If we could find him, we could gather the brothers from the Unbounded Blade and the Corpse-Raising Village and capture him naturally."

Zhao Zhiyuan asked, "How do we find him?" Su Qiuwu replied, "By pulling out tendons and peeling skin, of course!" He then explained, "We pull out *other people's* tendons and peel *other people's* skin. We create horrifying murders and blame them on Wen Caishang and Li Xian. Then, someone else will help us find them, leaving them nowhere to run."

Zhao Zhiyuan said, "It's a vicious plan, but it is feasible. However, the title 'Madam of the Broken Sword' has been around for a long time. If it spreads, what if someone comes to her aid?"

Su Qiuwu said, "That's why... in the Crimson List wanted notice, we cannot include words like 'Madam of the Broken Sword' or 'Wen Caishang'. We'll call her the 'Blood-Drinking Vicious Woman, Wen Snake Scorpion'. Wen Caishang has been out of the Jianghu for a long time. With this kind of wanted notice, who would think she is the Madam of the Broken Sword? They would just think she's a wanted criminal who drinks blood and does evil. We would be acting as agents of justice. Isn't that perfect?"

Everyone pondered it and felt it made sense. The plan was ruthless and effective, so they immediately put it into action that night. Using vicious methods, they slaughtered several villages, creating horrifying murder scenes.

Zhao Zhiyuan had an elder brother named "Zhao Zhigao," who was part of the Patrol Sky Division. He wrote a letter to inform him of the situation.

Through clever manipulation and by having people come forward to testify... they fabricated the identities of "Heart-Eating Young Master, Li Ren Shan" and "Blood-Drinking Vicious Woman, Wen Snake Scorpion." The news spread throughout the world, constantly brewing.

Through word of mouth, the information was disseminated. The storm gathered across the land, and suddenly it was closing in. Li Xian had been hiding for a long time, but he was truly forced out by this scheme.

Li Xian thought to himself, "What a vicious plan. Even if the Madam is ruthless, she doesn't kill without reason. To kill the two of us, they would commit such atrocities!" He used the chaos to leave, employing his lightness skill to rush back to the earthen hut.

The small courtyard with its earthen walls. Wen Caishang was holding a sword and dancing lightly. Her movements were light and soft, yet her swordsmanship was exceptionally profound. Li Xian said joyfully, "Madam, you can walk now?"

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Last night, I circulated my blood and qi, connecting my bones and tendons. I can walk now. Why are you in such a hurry?"

Li Xian recounted everything he had heard in the city. Wen Caishang's eyes flashed with a cold light. After a brief discussion, they decided to leave immediately. Li Xian packed his bag, and Wen Caishang folded her clothes.

Seeing the flowers and plants in the courtyard and the paddy fields outside, the peaceful and harmonious scene brought a hint of reluctance. Wen Caishang thought, "Su Qiuwu, Li Quan... Hmph, when the time comes, I will settle the score with each of you. I will make you wish you were dead!" She flicked her sleeve and drew her sword, carving a message on the earthen wall:

"Your dog lives are spared for now. I will come for them another day."

Li Xian took Wen Caishang's hand and channeled his internal qi into her, allowing her to walk more briskly. He directed the qi through the acupoints in her hands and feet, avoiding her dantian lake, because if the蛊虫 (poisonous insect) absorbed it, it would all be wasted.

His qi reserves were vast, and even as he slowly channeled it, he remained abundant. Wen Caishang tightened her grip, a smile on her face, her sleeves fluttering, a truly pleasing sight. As they reached the village entrance, they suddenly heard a loud shout: "The vicious criminals are here! Shoot!"

Dozens of arrows flew towards them. Li Xian pulled Wen Caishang behind him, holding his sword horizontally to shield her. He knocked down all the arrows and saw that the village entrance was already blocked by dozens of people.

They were all wearing armor and steel helmets, holding long spears and sharp swords, their momentum fierce. It turned out that "Li Daqin" had gone into the town today, seen the "Crimson List," and was so terrified that he immediately reported it to the county office.

The leader of the troops said, "Vicious criminal Li Ren Shan, treacherous woman Wen Snake Scorpion! Surrender immediately and await your fate?! If you defy us, don't blame us for being impolite."

Li Xian knew that talking was useless. He said, "Hmph, and what if you are impolite?" He raised his palm and struck out. His internal qi surged, and the palm force was immense. The surrounding men were knocked over in a heap, and cries of alarm rose and fell.

This move was called "Pushing the Waves and Aiding the Current." The qi passed through the Xia Bai and Chi Ze acupoints, causing waves of qi to surge with great momentum.

Li Xian murmured, "Raging Waves and Surging Seas!" He retracted his two palms. The powerful qi force sent the men tumbling head over heels, their armor discarded, all of them thoroughly defeated.

The "Pushing the Waves" palm force went outward, while the "Raging Waves" palm force went inward. The two moves, used one after the other, were like two opposing tides crashing together. In an instant, they unleashed a powerful killing force, leaving the enemies' fronts and backs under attack, pushed from both inside and out.

The soldiers fell to the ground, their cries of agony rising and falling, unable to get up.

Li Xian glanced at "Li Daqin." Li Daqin fell to the ground with a plop, his clothes and pants soaked.

Li Xian pondered, "Now that this has happened, our trail is exposed. Those people will surely track us to this village. To deepen our reputation as villains, they might take the opportunity to slaughter the villagers and create another horrifying massacre." He shook his head and sighed, "If you hadn't said anything, you could have pretended nothing happened. But since you did, you had better flee quickly and fend for yourselves."

After leaving the Village of Peaceful Harmony, they headed straight north until they saw a great, rushing river. It was a tributary of the "Benghua River." Li Xian waved his hand and shouted, calling over a small boat. They traveled along the river.

The two sat at the stern of the boat. The banks were covered in flowers, with bees and butterflies playing about, full of life. Although Li Xian and Wen Caishang had left in a hurry, they were not flustered. They admired the scenery and floated down the river, completely at ease.

The river water was calm, and the boat drifted swiftly. After traveling several miles without hearing any pursuit, Li Xian guessed that although Su Qiuwu and the others had come up with a vicious plan and discovered their location, it would take time for them to react. Moreover, he had already escaped the encirclement. The time difference between their actions and his escape gave him the initiative.

"The Huashui Prefecture is located in the northeast of the Yunan Dao. The river systems, mountain ranges, and cities... although I am not familiar with them, during this period of rest and recovery, I have dealt with people from the merchant guilds. I already know a convenient route to Qiongtian Prefecture that few people are aware of."

The boatman was very skilled at poling the boat. He let the river waves beat against it, but the boat remained stable. Li Xian thought of the ethereal fairy music and the legend of "dissolving upon touching water." He reached his hand into the river. The moment his finger touched the water, it felt incredibly heavy, as if weighed down by a ten-thousand-pound boulder.

Li Xian sighed with emotion, "So this is what it feels like for the clear to rise and the turbid to sink. In that case, even if I have the 'Azure Water Pearl,' I would not dare enter the water easily."

Wen Caishang cut her fingertip and forced out a drop of blood, saying, "Drink this blood and try again for now."

Li Xian did as he was told. When his finger touched the water, the feeling of the turbid sinking was greatly reduced. He couldn't help but ask curiously, "Madam, what is the principle behind this?"

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "This concerns the Three Realms. When the time comes, you will understand naturally. It is useless to explain it now."

Half an hour later. The boat reached the shore, and Li Xian paid ten copper coins. The boatman shouted an order and poled the boat away. Li Xian knew that Wen Caishang had just started walking again and her strength was weak; she would surely find it difficult to endure a long journey. They walked a few more miles and stopped to rest and drink.

Wen Caishang gently wiped away her sweat. How could she avoid getting dusty? A faint sweat beaded on her forehead, her cheeks were slightly flushed, her demeanor dignified, yet with a unique charm.

For several consecutive days. They walked over a hundred miles.

Every day, Li Xian digested the [Spiritual Treasure], and the ethereal fairy music became more and more distinct, faintly able to penetrate and produce three light sounds.

On this day.

Li Xian pointed to a river system in the distance and said, "The river systems of the Great Wu Empire are incredibly complex! They flow in all four directions, east, west, south, and north, with countless tributaries and forks between the main and branch streams."

"I've inquired about the news. If we walk in this direction for another fifty miles, we'll reach the Wei Hu River. This great river can go all the way to Qiongtian Prefecture. But very few people know about it. Do you know, Madam?"

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "I can see you're showing off your knowledge. I don't know, go on and tell me."

Li Xian said, "The Wei Hu River flows to the southwest. Its main channel passes through 'Lin'an Prefecture,' which is very far from Qiongtian Prefecture. That's why no one knows."

"In reality, after boarding the Wei Hu River, you turn into the 'Niao Yan River' tributary, then turn into the 'Piao Sha River' tributary... doing this and that, and you can enter Qiongtian Prefecture. The river systems are this complex. The merchant guild spent decades of exploration just to figure out this route."

The territory of Great Wu is vast. Precisely because it is so vast, with its vast resources and diverse terrain, rivers and streams are scattered, and mountain ranges are stacked... a single river can have over a hundred different names. Even though they are connected from beginning to end, because travelers' horizons are narrow, they are completely unaware of it.

Wen Caishang smiled and said, "Are you trying to get me to praise you?" Li Xian said, "Isn't that the point?" Wen Caishang said, "Alright, alright, you're amazing. Let's go, to avoid trouble down the road."
