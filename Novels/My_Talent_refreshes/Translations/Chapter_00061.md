# Chapter 61: Spirit Talisman Pavilion

He Changyou looked at Chu Ning with astonishment. If not for the few remaining disciples still crafting talismans, he would have rushed to Chu Ning's side immediately.  

Soon, the last of the disciples finished their final talisman. Without waiting any longer, He Changyou flashed to Chu Ning's side.  

"You successfully crafted five talismans?"  

At He Changyou's words and sudden movement, all eyes in the hall instantly turned to Chu Ning, filled with shock.  

Everyone in the hall had spent the past five days learning the Wood Escape Talisman and knew just how difficult it was to master from scratch and improve the success rate. Even a success rate of 30-40% would have been impressive. Yet now, He Changyou claimed Chu Ning had achieved a 50% success rate. How could they not be stunned?  

Chu Ning sighed inwardly. The moment his final talisman succeeded, he realized he was about to stand out again. But he hadn't expected even He Changyou to react so strongly.  

A thought flashed through his mind, and in the next instant, the surprise on his face transformed into excitement.  

"I..."  

Chu Ning put on an extremely thrilled expression.  

"After the second and third ones succeeded, I felt like I was in great form. I never expected to succeed with three more after that."  

His words caused an uproar in the hall.  

"This guy's luck is insane!"  
"Absolutely! After two successes in a row, his confidence must've skyrocketed."  
"I usually get three successes, but failing three in a row at the start messed me up—I only managed two in the end."  

Amidst the chatter, He Changyou nodded slightly before his voice boomed across the hall.  

"Luck and mindset are both crucial factors in a cultivator's success. The rules apply to everyone. The first place is first place—there's no such thing as mere luck."  

With that, He Changyou returned the five talismans to Chu Ning and flashed back to the front of the hall.  

"Now, I announce the results of this talisman-crafting competition. First place: Chu Ning, with a 50% success rate. Second place: Xie Caitian, with a 40% success rate..."  

He Changyou listed the top ten names, with the last three having a 20% success rate. Of the remaining seventeen, ten had only one success, while seven hadn't succeeded even once.  

Clearly, the pressure of the competition had caused most of them to underperform, given their lack of experience.  

Because of this, the gazes directed at Chu Ning were tinged with envy.  

Though He Changyou had emphasized that luck was part of one's ability, most still believed Chu Ning had simply gotten lucky.  

The five fellow disciples who had been promoted from the D-tier alongside him exchanged glances, their expressions complicated.  

They had all risen from the same humble beginnings, and Chu Ning had been the weakest among them in cultivation. But if he truly mastered talisman crafting, his future resources would far surpass theirs.  

Before the hall could stew in their mixed emotions any longer, He Changyou waved a hand.  

"The top ten, follow me to the Spirit Talisman Pavilion."  

Under the envious stares of the others, Chu Ning and the rest followed He Changyou out of the hall and toward the outer sect.  

As they entered the outer sect, they ran into Zhuang Yunde coming the other way.  

"Elder He!"  

Zhuang Yunde first bowed respectfully to He Changyou before sweeping his gaze over the group. When his eyes landed on Chu Ning, he paused briefly before smiling and nodding in recognition.  

Chu Ning returned the smile but didn't engage further—it wasn't the time for private conversation.  

He Changyou acknowledged Zhuang Yunde with a nod and led the group onward.  

Soon, they arrived before a grand hall.  

Though Chu Ning had visited the outer sect before, he had only ever sought out Zhuang Yunde and Mu Ling. He hadn't even been to the Hundred Arts Hall, let alone the Spirit Talisman Pavilion.  

It had taken him some time after joining the sect to learn that despite its name, the Hundred Arts Hall didn't actually oversee core disciplines like alchemy, talismans, artifacts, or formations. Each had its own dedicated division—Alchemy Hall, Artifact Forging Hall, and Spirit Talisman Pavilion.  

The group stopped before a five-story pavilion, but before they could take in the sight, He Changyou ushered them inside.  

"Elder Liao!"  

He Changyou clasped his hands toward a middle-aged scholar engrossed in a book in the main hall.  

The scholar seemed rather unkempt, his robe loosely fastened without much care for decorum.  

At He Changyou's call, he lifted his gaze from the book and studied the group behind him.  

"These are the disciples selected by the Hundred Arts Hall to learn talismans?"  

"They are disciples from the Spirit Plantation with notable talent in talisman crafting," He Changyou confirmed.  

He then turned to Chu Ning and the others.  

"This is Elder Liao Yunming of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion. Pay your respects."  

Chu Ning and the others stepped forward and bowed in unison.  

After accepting their greetings, Liao Yunming didn't address them directly. Instead, he asked He Changyou,  

"What talisman did they test with, and how did they perform?"  

"The Wood Escape Talisman. Their talent is commendable," He Changyou replied with a smile.  

"In just five days, three achieved a 20% success rate, five reached 30%, and this one—Xie Caitian—hit 40%."  

Liao Yunming's gaze swept over them indifferently, lingering only slightly on Xie Caitian at the mention of his 40% rate.  

Finally, his eyes settled on Chu Ning with a questioning look, as if wondering why He Changyou hadn't introduced him yet.  

"I also found an exceptional talent."  

He Changyou's tone carried pride as he gestured toward Chu Ning.  

"Chu Ning. Five days, 50% success rate with the Wood Escape Talisman."  

"Fifty percent?" Liao Yunming's eyes widened in surprise, and he set his book down.  

"Are you joking? Or has he studied talismans before?"  

He Changyou chuckled.  

"Do I seem like the joking type? This disciple has only been in the sect for just over a year. He was farming in the D-tier until recently, when he was promoted to the C-tier. I've already verified—he learned paper-making but has never touched talisman crafting before."  

Liao Yunming abruptly stood, scrutinizing Chu Ning as he muttered,  

"Fifty percent... To reach that so quickly is rare even in our Spirit Talisman Pavilion."  

He then turned sharply toward a young man in the corner of the hall.  

"Tan Zhang, take these nine Spirit Plantation juniors to select some foundational talisman manuals. I'll personally assess this one's skills. If his talent is genuine..."  

He left the sentence hanging, but his intent was clear—Chu Ning was about to receive special treatment.
