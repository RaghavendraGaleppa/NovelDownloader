# Chapter 131: The Giant Market (Seeking Recommendation Votes)

A short while later, Lin Xuan swept the Beast Talisman with his spiritual sense, and his face lit up with joy.

Although he had speculated about it, seeing the truth before his eyes still filled him with ecstasy.

The depleted energy of the Skysoar Bird Beast Talisman had been fully replenished.

As everyone knew, Beast Talismans were created by killing demonic beasts, extracting their souls, and then having ghost-path cultivators use a special refining technique to seal them within talisman paper.

Their power was equivalent to that of the demonic beasts in life, but these talismans had a fatal flaw: the energy within the beast's soul would deplete with use, and once exhausted, the Beast Talisman would become useless.

Thus, although Beast Talismans were simple to use and powerful, they were also extravagant consumables.

But now, the energy of the Skysoar Bird Beast Talisman in his hand had been replenished. This meant he could use Beast Talismans freely.

As long as his spiritual sense allowed and he could control them, he could even use several at once. The benefits to his combat strength were self-evident.

However, it seemed the jade pendant itself didn’t provide energy to the Beast Talisman. Instead, it had absorbed some of the soul energy from the Lion-Tiger Beast and then transferred it to the talisman.

Recalling the scene in the herb garden, the Lion-Tiger Beast had appeared docile on the surface, but there had been a faint trace of fear in its demeanor.

Though he didn’t know if this was the jade pendant’s full capability, this discovery alone delighted Lin Xuan. He stored it in his storage bracelet and began meditating cross-legged.

The night passed without incident.

The next day, Lin Xuan called back Lin Yue’er, removed the restriction formations, identified the direction, and flew southeast.

This wasn’t the way back to the Spirit Herb Mountain. Instead, Lin Xuan planned to visit a nearby market to purchase some items.

Half a day later, Lin Xuan descended from his flight, dispelled the illusion formation’s restrictions, and a massive market appeared before him.

In the Youzhou cultivation world, this was a rather unique location.

Unlike Yanzhou, Youzhou had numerous cultivation sects.

For instance, near the Snow Glow Mountain, there were dozens of cultivation sects, large and small, such as the Heavenly Eye Sect, the Sea Sand Sect, and the Six Harmonies Sect.

Additionally, many cultivation families were scattered throughout the area.

Though numerous, these sects and families were weak, ranking at the fourth or fifth tier in terms of strength.

For example, the leader of one small sect was only at the peak of the Qi Refining stage—a pitifully low level.

Simply put, they were the grassroots of the cultivation world, their status barely above that of rogue cultivators.

However, though their cultivation was lacking, the combined force of so many sects and families made them a force to be reckoned with.

Historically, the ancestors of these sects had included wise individuals who understood the law of the jungle in the cultivation world. To prevent their sects from vanishing, they had established a covenant.

A mutual defense pact!

If one sect was attacked, the others were obligated to assist unconditionally.

This pact had allowed these small sects to survive in the brutal cultivation world.

Of course, another key reason was that their location wasn’t particularly rich in spiritual veins, so no powerful forces sought to seize it.

Given their weakness, mere cultivation offered little hope, so they turned their attention to earning spirit stones.

They established a market and operated it collectively.

Over thousands of years, this place had grown into the largest market in Youzhou. Its scale and the variety of goods available surpassed even the markets of the three major sects, such as the Azure Cloud Mountain.

This wasn’t surprising, as these sects devoted most of their efforts to running the market, unlike the three major sects, which merely assigned low-level disciples to manage theirs.

Given the difference in investment, the market’s large scale was understandable.

Lin Xuan now walked through the market.

Though called a market, it resembled a city in the mortal world.

Two main streets intersected in a cross, each several zhang wide. Along the streets stood rows of buildings, and more than a dozen smaller streets branched off, forming a bustling trade network.

Lin Xuan was well-traveled, but even he was astonished. This place couldn’t merely be called a market—it had evolved into a hub providing all kinds of services for cultivators.

Beyond shops, there was an auction house where rare items were traded. Rumor had it that as long as you had enough spirit stones, you could even buy magic treasures.

There was also the Gathering Immortals Pavilion, something no other market had.

The Gathering Immortals Pavilion resembled a restaurant in the mortal world, but here, the dishes were true immortal delicacies, made from demonic beasts and rare herbs, meticulously prepared.

Demonic beasts were fierce and savage, but their flesh was far more delicious than that of ordinary beasts. Though cultivators pursued the Dao, they were still mortal and had desires. This place satisfied their culinary cravings.

Moreover, rumors claimed that regularly eating such dishes could enhance cultivation. Whether true or not, cultivators flocked here—though the prices were steep.

Similarly, there were teahouses serving secret blends brewed from several spiritual herbs. While they didn’t boost cultivation, they had other beneficial effects.

Like mortals, cultivators enjoyed chatting over tea, so these teahouses were also sources of cultivation-related gossip.

Lin Xuan stopped in front of a shop with a large "Medicine" character on its sign. If there was one thing the market didn’t sell, it was pills that directly enhanced cultivation.

However, while finished pills weren’t available, ingredients could still be found here—such as ginseng under two hundred years old or low-grade Red Vine Grass.

Lin Xuan had already gathered the ingredients for the Meridian-Cleansing Pill, but only enough for one batch. After narrowly obtaining the Seven-Star Grass as a catalyst—needed only in small amounts per batch—he could now refine many more.

Since he was at the market anyway, he decided to buy more ingredients.
