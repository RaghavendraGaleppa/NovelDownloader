# Chapter 55: Floating Boat

"Senior Brother, this floating boat... can it only go this fast?"

When the 377 spirit field was no longer in sight, Ding Rui walked around the spirit rice and simple daily necessities in the cabin, went to the bow, and scrutinized the cabin from all angles before asking the outer sect disciple who was piloting the floating boat.

The outer sect disciple glanced at Ding Rui and said, "My name is Shui Yu. You can call me Senior Brother Shui."

"Senior Brother Shui," Ding Rui obediently called out. He truly had no way to deal with this joking Senior Brother Shui, as he was asking for a favor and couldn't control his own curiosity.

"Haha!" Shui Yu chuckled, looking quite pleased. He then turned back to Ding Rui and asked, "Junior Brother, do you know why I came to find you?"

Ding Rui was startled and couldn't help but reply, "Wasn't it the sect that sent you?"

"When you talk to me, add 'Senior Brother'," Shui Yu said, displeased.

"..." Ding Rui was speechless. After a moment of silence, he rephrased, "Wasn't it the sect's Senior Brothers who sent you?"

At this, Ding Rui's eyes suddenly lit up. He rushed to Shui Yu's side and whispered, "Could it be that the sect was shocked by my talent, and specifically sent you, Senior Brother, to find me, intending to promote me directly to an outer sect disciple and even let me join the Miscellaneous Hall?"

Shui Yu's hand slipped, causing the steadily moving floating boat to judder slightly. He cast a sidelong glance at Ding Rui and said helplessly, "What are you thinking? How could the sect's rules be broken so easily? Unless you enter the Foundation Establishment stage, you absolutely cannot become an outer sect disciple."

"Then aren't you, Senior Brother, a bit early? It will still be a while before I break through from Qi Condensation to Foundation Establishment. As a spirit farmer, I have to cultivate five different cultivation methods simultaneously," Ding Rui explained.

Shui Yu looked surprised upon hearing this. "How can that be? Won't you ultimately only be able to cultivate one or two methods, abandoning the others, to reach the Foundation Establishment stage? I came now to tell you early, so you won't be troubled later, not knowing which hall to choose." He continued, "Our Miscellaneous Hall is precisely for geniuses. True geniuses can only unleash their full potential in the Miscellaneous Hall. You can create artifacts now, and once you reach the Sea Coagulation Realm, you'll be able to create spell formations. In our Miscellaneous Hall, there's ample space and materials for you to experiment. Just imagine a brand new, powerful spell formation being born in your hands – that is your true calling." Shui Yu spoke with a look of intoxication.

"Difficult?" Ding Rui's heart stirred upon hearing this. "But I have skill slots! I'm not afraid of difficulty!" He composed himself, quickly seized the opportunity, and asked Shui Yu, "Senior Brother, how difficult is it to cultivate five different cultivation methods to the Foundation Establishment stage simultaneously? I suffered from amnesia once before and forgot many things."

Amnesia was Ding Rui's frequently used excuse, and no one ever truly questioned whether he had actually lost his memory.

Shui Yu naturally had no doubts. As he piloted the boat, he began to explain, "The difficulty is immense. Do you know what you need to do to advance from the first level of Qi Condensation to the second?"

"You need to condense and compress the gaseous True Essence within your body into liquid True Essence," Ding Rui replied. He still knew this much. As a Qi Condensation cultivator, he also knew that advancing from the second level to the third level of Qi Condensation required condensing and compressing liquid True Essence into solid True Essence.
