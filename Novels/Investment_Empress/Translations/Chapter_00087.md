Chapter 87: The Modified Female Emperor, Sneaking into Ying Bing's Room at Night

"She, with an unparalleled appearance, was as clear and detached as a fairy, recognized by the martial world as a celestial being."

"She, with a revered status, was decisive in her actions, and her presence alone made countless forces in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands tremble."

"She, with extraordinary strength, wielded a sword that shone with a cold light, illuminating nineteen states."

"Her name was Leng Qingqiu, a female emperor, also known as the Cold Devil Woman by the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, a being as powerful as a taboo."

Li Mo spoke briefly, and the image of a detached and powerful female emperor emerged vividly.

Shang Wu thought for a moment, then asked skeptically, "Is there really such a person? I've never heard of her."

Ying Bing also looked at Li Mo, her eyes narrowing slightly.

Li Mo coughed lightly and said, "Since she's considered a taboo existence, and it's been a long time, it's normal you don't know about her. The Great Shang Dynasty was once prosperous, and many legendary figures have now faded into obscurity."

Shang Wu pursed her lips, took a sip of wine, and said, "Alright."

Li Mo continued, "However, being outstanding in a crowd invites destruction. A female emperor like her, not affiliated with any force and不受 any control, was naturally seen as a thorn in the side by many."

"To deal with her, the righteous and demonic paths joined forces, pushing her to the brink of disaster."

"That day, the sun and moon lost their light, the heavens and earth turned upside down, gods wept, and night ghosts cried."

"Her palace was filled with rivers of blood, piles of bones as high as mountains, countless strong warriors perished, and the world trembled."

"Although Leng Qingqiu was powerful, she was also on the verge of exhaustion, pushed to the edge of a ten-thousand-foot abyss."

Shang Wu's eyes sparkled with excitement, clearly immersed in the story.

Ying Bing's thoughtful expression deepened, feeling a sense of familiarity.

The female emperor in Li Mo's story, although having a different name and experience, resonated with her in some ways.

In her previous life, she was also not tolerated by the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands, even though she hadn't done anything wrong, just focusing on her martial path, never intending to stir up trouble.

But she didn't enter the martial world; instead, the martial world came to her.

A powerful existence beyond control was enough to be seen as a thorn in the side.

However, her outcome differed from the female emperor in Li Mo's story.

"'With no path to take, she left behind only one sentence, 'Though I die, my heart remains unregretful in the martial path,' before leaping into the ten-thousand-foot abyss.'"

"'Ah? What happened next? What happened next?'"

Shang Wu asked eagerly.

Li Mo smiled lightly and said, "Don't worry, Master. Think about it; since this secret tale has been passed down, the main character couldn't have really died. To be honest, this secret tale was left behind by Leng Qingqiu herself."

"On the verge of death, she activated an object called the 'Spring and Autumn Cicada.'"

"So!"

"She not only didn't die but also returned to her youthful years!"

As Li Mo spoke, he brought the story to life.

Shang Wu's eyes widened in shock.

The chopsticks in Ying Bing's hand fell to the ground with a clatter.

Shang Wu pouted and said, "Little Bing'er, you also think it's too incredible, right? There's no such thing as coming back to life in this world."

"Moreover, it's not just coming back to life; time is also reversed!"

The most impossible things in this world are transcending life and death and reversing time.

Countless legendary figures and powerful warriors ultimately fell to the passage of time, unable to escape the constraints of life and death.

"Perhaps... it exists," Ying Bing said softly.

Shang Wu turned back, surprised. "Little Bing'er, where did your fascination come from?"

Seeing Ying Bing was engrossed in the story, Li Mo felt relieved. Then, he glanced at Shang Wu with a hint of displeasure. "Master, if you interrupt again, I won't continue."

Shang Wu poured him another cup of wine, indicating she would listen quietly without arguing.

After all, it's just a legend; who knows how much of it is true?

Li Mo took another sip of wine before continuing.

As he spoke, the image of a proud and detached woman, devoted to her martial path, emerged.

In this life, she used her accumulated knowledge from her previous life to rise rapidly.

However, this Leng Qingqiu unexpectedly met a man who hadn't practiced martial arts in an accident after her rebirth.

Then, she began to pretend to be an ordinary person, getting to know the man, and eventually, she was moved by him.

Thus, a generation of female emperors had a mundane husband.

Many interesting and absurd events happened in between.

The story was full of natural, unpolluted sweetness.

Moreover, after gaining love, her martial progress advanced even further.

Li Mo spoke with increasing enthusiasm, sipping the "Immortal Drunk" wine.

The plot unfolded with twists and turns, captivating Shang Wu.

Compared to the stories told by other storytellers, this one was a dimensional strike.

Although she knew many parts were unreasonable, she was still deeply engrossed.

"'In the end, Leng Qingqiu returned to seclusion with her family...'"

"'Without storms, how can there be rainbows?'"

"'Although her life was full of twists and turns, experiencing setbacks and even life and death...'"

"'But she was never defeated; in the end, she achieved success in both her martial path and love.'"

Li Mo concluded with his own commentary.

His point was that even if one can transcend life and death, a life full of twists and turns will eventually clear up.

Young girls, your life is just beginning; why worry about temporary gains and losses?

The story was uplifting, spreading positive energy.

"'Is that the end?'"

Shang Wu was still unsatisfied.

She wanted to encourage Li Mo to tell another story but found that Li Mo, the storyteller, had already fallen asleep on the table, emitting gentle snores.

He had drunk a third of the "Immortal Drunk" wine.

Shang Wu couldn't help but lift him back to his room and finish the remaining wine before retiring to her own room.

"'Martial path and love... double harvest?'"

Ying Bing lay on her bed, her nose sensing someone's scent, her mind replaying the story Li Mo had told.

For some reason, as the night deepened, and she couldn't practice her martial arts, her mind became chaotic.

Was what Li Mo said fabricated or true?

Then, Ying Bing remembered she still hadn't completed the system's punishment.

But... sharing a bed?

Ying Bing's brow furrowed.

Did it mean she had to sneak into Li Mo's bed at night?

This... this...

Just as she was thinking, the door creaked open.

A figure staggered in and fell onto the bed.

Ying Bing quickly dodged, her hand on the hilt of her sword, Tian Shuang.

However, a strong wine scent wafted over, followed by snores.

"Ugh... hehe..."

The boy on the bed murmured, seemingly having a pleasant dream, and smiled in his sleep.

It was Li Mo.

Ying Bing stood by the window, her expression unreadable in the darkness.

["Dingdong, the first day is about to end."]

["Please, host, complete the punishment as soon as possible; otherwise, the system will be unbound."]

["Countdown: 10, 9, 8, 7..."]

Finally, a soft sigh echoed within the room.
