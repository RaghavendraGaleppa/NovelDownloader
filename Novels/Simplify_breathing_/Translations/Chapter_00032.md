**Chapter 32: The Eccentric**

Three people traveled in silence. Zhang Yuezhen disdained speaking much to Chen Fei, and Chen Fei naturally wouldn't try to approach her.

“What if I just leave the medical hall?”

A thought suddenly popped into Chen Fei's mind, but he immediately dismissed it. He was now branded with the Zhang family's mark. Did he think he could just pay a termination fee and leave safely? Unless Chen Fei left Pingyin County, openly breaking ties with the Zhang family would only invite more trouble. Or he could change his identity and continue living in Pingyin County. In that case, Chen Fei would naturally have no problem supporting himself, given his alchemy skills. However, acquiring any martial arts manuals or secret techniques would become very difficult. The damaged secret manuals in the black market were truly unreliable.

Chen Fei had placed high hopes on the Thunderclap Sword Force manuals, thinking that with over a dozen of them, he was bound to gain something. Yet, after reviewing them all, the panel didn't acknowledge a single one, not even meeting the most basic requirements for simplification. One could say that Chen Fei's ability to obtain 'Immortal's Guiding Finger' and 'Shocking Word' previously was due to an absolute stroke of luck. But luck isn't something that will always follow you just because you wish for it. As for leaving Pingyin County, rebels were rampant outside, and strangeness seemed to be proliferating, perhaps due to widespread resentment and divine wrath.

A quarter of an hour later, the crowd dispersed, and Chen Fei and the others arrived at Zhang Sinan's courtyard.

“The situation is as my father described. If any of you can find a way to kill Sun Shu, the Zhang family will not let you down.” Zhang Sinan picked up a cup of tea and took a few sips.

“Didn't Sun Shu already leave Pingyin County? How is it that...” Zeng Defang asked, puzzled.

“There are some details that are inconvenient to disclose. Please forgive me, Elder Zeng.”

“No, no, I wouldn't dare.” Zeng Defang quickly waved his hand.

“If that Sun Shu dares to show himself, I alone can kill him!”

Zhang Yuezhen's eyes narrowed slightly. She seemed determined to succeed in this matter. Her status within the Zhang family was still somewhat awkward, as she had come seeking refuge. If she could kill Sun Shu and gain everyone's approval, her position in the Zhang family would undoubtedly become more secure.

“That Sun Shu is now like a rat scurrying across the street. How would he dare show his face?”

Zhang Sinan shook his head. Sun Shu's strength was at the Bone Forging Realm, which was considerable, but the Zhang family still had the capability to deal with him. The problem was that they couldn't find him; he was hiding in the shadows. Just yesterday, two direct descendants of the Zhang family had actually died. Otherwise, the Zhang family wouldn't be so enraged. Chen Fei didn't say a word, just stood by. This matter was indeed very tempting, but given the strength Chen Fei currently displayed publicly, he didn't appear capable of killing Sun Shu.

However, there were many such eccentrics in the refugee camp. Zhou Shi usually didn't pay them much mind, but ever since the Zhang family's bounty was announced, something shifted in his heart. Perhaps, this person was the one the Zhang family was looking for? Such a thought inevitably crossed Zhou Shi's mind, but he had no way to prove it. He couldn't just assume someone was Sun Shu just because they looked strange.

As night fell, Zhou Shi gnawed on the hard, black steamed bun in his hand, and for some reason, the person he had seen earlier that day resurfaced in his mind. Zhou Shi thought for a moment and then found Zhou Li, with whom he had grown up.

“Report that person to the Zhang family?” Zhou Li looked at Zhou Shi in surprise.

“I specifically asked others, and that person is really strange. He usually doesn't go out to work, only occasionally. Unless he's already rich, but if he's rich, why would he stay here with us?” Zhou Shi whispered.

Zhou Li frowned, feeling that Zhou Shi had a point. Of course, the most crucial factor was that the Zhang family's bounty was truly too tempting. As long as one provided useful information, they could receive a considerable reward, and even a job in a Zhang family shop. Even if the Zhang family was just putting on a show for others, they would likely arrange a decent position.

“So, should we try?”
