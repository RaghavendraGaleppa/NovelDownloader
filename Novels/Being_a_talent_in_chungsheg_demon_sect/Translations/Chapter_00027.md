# Chapter 27: Comprehending Arrays

Things unfolded exactly as Lu Yang had predicted. In the end, Zhao Xuhe sold him the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* for a mere 1500 contribution points. That's how people are when they're in debt.

After obtaining the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*, Lu Yang immediately returned to his cave abode. He meticulously memorized the cultivation method's contents, word for word, before putting it away again.

“It's a pity I can't cultivate right now.”

Having transformed into a Blood Shadow, his cultivation base remained stagnant, forever stuck at late-stage Qi Condensation. He couldn't even disperse his cultivation, so he could only wait for his next life.

That being said, Lu Yang wasn't in a hurry to commit suicide. After all, time was precious. Even with the [Hundred Lifetimes Tome], he wouldn't easily waste it. Even if he couldn't cultivate, there were other areas where he could still make progress.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang took out Immortal Qingchen's *Treasured Array Secret Manual* from his storage bag. That's right, he was going to learn array formations!

Among the four cultivation arts—Arrays, Artifact Forging, Alchemy, and Talisman Crafting—possessing even one skill made one a high-tier talent in the cultivation world, capable of thriving anywhere. For instance, Immortal Qingchen. Lu Yang truly felt she was a talent; not only did she understand array formations, but she could also integrate them into magical artifacts. It was just a pity her judgment in men was poor. In both lives, she fell for scumbags who would turn their backs on her, leading to her dying with resentment in both incarnations.

Opening the *Treasured Array Secret Manual*, the very first page made Lu Yang sigh with emotion.

【So-called ‘Array Treasures’ are arrays serving as treasures, and treasures serving as arrays; the two complement each other. This art was painstakingly researched by this very person.】
【To learn this path, talent and diligence are both indispensable.】

After the opening preface, the second page was filled with dense, intricate patterns. Each pattern came with a detailed annotation explaining its meaning.

【The path of array formations primarily relies on array runes. By outlining array runes, one can depict the heavens and earth, thereby borrowing from their wonders. However, the mysteries of the cosmos are inexhaustible and difficult to comprehend, let alone translate into array runes. This requires extraordinary insight. Only by mastering array runes can one truly learn array formations.】
【Excellent. You now have a basic understanding of the fundamental principles of array formations.】
【Now, turn to the third page. Let’s look at a simple example below and apply the knowledge we just learned into practice.】

On the third page, an extremely complex and intricate diagram appeared before Lu Yang's eyes.

This was an array diagram?

Lu Yang stroked his chin. Deciphering an array diagram, as it was called, essentially meant identifying the composition of array runes within the formation to deduce its function. Array runes were the foundation of all array formations. Whether an array formation could take effect primarily depended on whether the combination of array runes was logical, if there were any conflicts, and if they could form a complete operational circuit.

“Interesting,” Lu Yang smiled confidently, finding it didn't seem particularly difficult. “With my talent and diligence, a mere simple array diagram is mine for the taking!”

One month later.

Lu Yang sat blankly on his meditation cushion, surrounded by piles of manuscripts filled with his calculations. He looked utterly dejected. In his hands were strands of combined array runes.

After an unknown amount of time, a spark of spiritual light suddenly flickered at Lu Yang's fingertips.

“It worked!?”

Lu Yang instantly stood up, his face flushed with wild joy. He carefully examined the array runes he had pieced together, performed a quick mental calculation, then a look of confusion spread across his face: “Wait, how did it work?”

“How is this thing even running?”

It was clearly the result of a month of painstaking effort, yet he himself didn't understand why it worked. This feeling was absolutely driving Lu Yang mad.

After a month of arduous study, he now had a deeper understanding of array formations. In short, array formations were very similar to programming. The so-called comprehension of array paths meant extracting usable parts from the 'spaghetti code' written by the heavens and earth—the 'old man in the sky'—and assembling one's own code.

However, when it came to array formations, if you didn't know it, you just didn't know it. It was like panning for gold in a mountain of dung. Those without talent would, like the current Lu Yang, fail to find a single speck of gold, but instead just dredge up a pile of faeces.

“Regardless, I still managed to dredge something up.”

Lu Yang sighed and continued to research tirelessly, forgetting food and sleep. It was only after another month had passed that he finally deciphered the diagram in his hand.

“This is an Illumination Array!”

“Within the array's covered area, light will thoroughly illuminate everything, causing most stealth techniques to fail. Beyond that, it has no offensive or defensive power…”

Lu Yang looked haggard, his eyes bloodshot, yet his face was beaming with excitement. With a strong sense of accomplishment, he turned to the third page of the *Treasured Array Secret Manual*.

【Actually, it's normal if you couldn't decipher it.】
【The purpose of the third page's problem was mainly to make you understand how difficult array formations are, to approach their comprehension with a humble heart, and not to always aim too high.】

Lu Yang: “...”

“Beast! You beast!”

Lu Yang abruptly stood up and slammed the book onto the ground. He was now 100% certain: this was absolutely an array formation book written by a Saint Sect array master!

After a while, Lu Yang picked the book up again. There was no other way. Some things didn't care whether you liked them, understood them, or wanted to do them; for the sake of living, one just had to grit their teeth and push through.

However, after further study, Lu Yang discovered that his talent wasn't as poor as he had imagined. Indeed, as the book stated, that intricate diagram on the third page was simply not meant for beginners to decipher. That was why Lu Yang had been stuck on it for two months. But there were benefits. Now, having switched to simpler, easier-to-understand array formations, Lu Yang's learning speed visibly increased. When he occasionally got stuck, a few days of study would usually see him through, allowing the previously disheartened Lu Yang to regain his confidence.

Time passed unnoticed in the cave, flying by. In the blink of an eye, twenty years had passed.

During this period, Lu Yang truly lived up to the saying 'two ears deaf to worldly affairs, one heart dedicated only to array formation books.' He even got too lazy to pay his cave abode rent and simply moved to the outer sect. After all, he couldn't cultivate now, and without any pressing needs, he naturally just slacked off and stopped working.

And over those twenty years, almost every few years, an Son of Destiny, blessed with immense luck like Xiao Shiye of old, would suddenly rise in the outer sect. However, once that Son of Destiny obtained a great opportunity known to everyone in the Saint Sect, they would suddenly vanish. Vanishing along with them was a large group of unfortunate souls who, after discovering the Son of Destiny's luck, harbored ill intentions and sought to latch onto them and leech off their fortune.

“It seems that senior is fishing again…”

Each time he heard such news, Lu Yang felt a pang of unease. After all, with Xiao Shiye as a precedent, he would only keep his distance from Sons of Destiny. He couldn't afford to provoke them, so he could only avoid them.

As for Zhao Xuhe, twenty years later, he had reached Great Perfection in Qi Condensation and became a renowned true disciple of the Saint Sect. Alas, he failed to break through to the Foundation Establishment realm a few years ago and passed away in meditation. Lu Yang merely sighed at this, then paid it no further mind.

What truly delighted Lu Yang, however, was that after twenty years of diligent study, he had finally thoroughly mastered the knowledge within the *Treasured Array Secret Manual*.

Inside the cave abode, Lu Yang's entire concentration was focused on the sword pill before him. At this moment, he was even too weak to maintain his human form, and his blood shadow appeared extremely dim. This was a sign that his great limit was approaching. The side effects of cultivating the Demonic Blood Transformation Divine Light in the past had finally caught up to him, causing his lifespan to be depleted and his lamp to run out of oil at only forty years old.

However, Lu Yang was completely unconcerned by this. He remained fully engrossed in carving array formations. Even on the verge of passing away in meditation, he didn't get up, nor did he attempt any desperate measures to save himself. Doing so would only interrupt his inspiration, and he didn't want to waste such precious insight.

“I understand! Wait, no, that’s wrong—”
“Oh, it’s right! Right… no, wait, still wrong… oh, it’s right, it’s right!”

A long time passed like this. Finally, just as Lu Yang's blood shadow was on the verge of dissipating, at the exact boundary between life and death, Lu Yang suddenly opened his eyes wide—

“Hahaha! I succeeded!”

Watching the array runes he had painstakingly inscribed piece together around the sword pill and finally run successfully, Lu Yang burst into hearty laughter, his voice echoing within the cave abode.

And so, amidst his laughter, he lost his breath.
