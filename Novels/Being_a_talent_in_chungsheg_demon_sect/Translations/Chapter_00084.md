# Chapter 84: Desiring to Pacify the Witch-Ghost Realm!

Within the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm, stood the main headquarters of the Listening-Ghost Sect.

Unlike other parts of the Secret Realm, as the Listening-Ghost Sect's headquarters, various ghost messengers were dispatched to clear out witch-ghosts. Over time, a city was even built, named 'City of the Unjustly Dead'.

At the center of the majestic city, a divine statue soared straight into the clouds. Nearly eighty percent of the Secret Realm's population gathered within this 'City of the Unjustly Dead'. Every moment, they could behold this heaven-reaching divine statue. Its likeness was none other than the Listening-Ghost Sect's Ancestral Master. Beneath the statue stood a resplendent and magnificent palace, serving as the reclusive cultivation grounds for the Listening-Ghost Sect's eight elders. The Listening-Ghost Sect had no Sect Master; they solely venerated the Ancestral Master, and thus all matters were collectively decided by the eight elders.

Normally, only one of the eight elders would be on duty, while the other seven remained in a state of slumber. After all, the Listening-Ghost Sect's cultivation system involved feeding one's body to ghosts, resulting in extremely short lifespans. Without such methods to prolong their lives, they would be devoured by the witch-ghosts in just a few years.

However, at this moment, a full six elders had entered a state of revival.

First Elder, White Impermanence, sat at the head of the table. He possessed an exceptionally youthful appearance, clad in white robes, tall and slender, with a chilling smile perpetually etched on his face. "The Ancestral Master's divine statue has been destroyed; this is no small matter. Before the statue was destroyed, the Ancestral Master's decree arrived, commanding us to find the one who destroyed it at all costs. This is why I have awakened all of you junior brothers."

At this point, White Impermanence looked towards the two empty seats and frowned, saying: "Where are Junior Brothers Wen and Wu?"

A brawny man, armored and weapon-wielding, with a bull's head hanging from one shoulder pad, stood up and said, "They have just returned to their positions; their revival still requires time."

White Impermanence nodded upon hearing this. "Very well, there's no rush for the matter."

Before his words had faded, another black-robed Daoist rose. His face was fierce, his build broad and stout, and he spoke with a sinister tone, "Why wait for them to revive, if you ask me? According to the sect's ancient texts, although there are many powerful cultivators in the outside world, truly formidable experts at the Ancestral Master's level dare not enter. And cultivators below the Ancestral Master's level are, at best, on par with us. Weren't those outsiders who recently trespassed into the headquarters, calling themselves 'Divine Martial Gate disciples,' exactly like that? Rather than waiting here bitterly, why don't we go ahead? Besides, the Day and Night Roaming Deities have both returned to their positions and can fully monitor inside and outside the Secret Realm. No matter how that outsider tries to hide, they definitely won't escape our grasp."

"Senior Brother speaks wisely." The one who spoke in agreement was a handsome young man with three eyes, who chuckled, "A mere wild fox Zen from the outside world, how could they be our opponent?"

The Eight Elders of the Listening-Ghost Sect, perhaps had their own names before attaining elder status, but after becoming elders, they would only use the Red-Robed Ghosts they commanded as their external titles: Black and White Impermanence, Civil and Martial Judges, Ox-Head and Horse-Face, and Day and Night Roaming Deities. Each possessed their own unique divine abilities. The three-eyed youth who spoke was the 'Day Roaming Deity' among the Day and Night Roaming Deities. As the name suggested, his witch-ghost was the third eye on his brow, golden in color, shaped like a great sun. Opening it allowed him to observe all manifested objects within the Secret Realm. The other, the 'Night Roaming Deity', was the complete opposite, capable of observing all concealed objects within the Secret Realm. With the two working together, everything that transpired within the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm was like observing patterns on their palm to the Listening-Ghost Sect; no matter how formidable, it could not escape their divine eyes.

Clearly, the eight elders were vaguely divided into two factions. White Impermanence, Ox-Head, and Horse-Face formed one faction, advocating for caution and preferring to wait until all eight were present before searching for the person who destroyed the Ancestral Master's statue. Black Impermanence, Day and Night Roaming Deities, on the other hand, were full of confidence, believing that outsiders were nothing special and that they could easily handle them on their own.

"Junior brother is too reckless." First Elder White Impermanence shook his head, his smile unwavering. "This matter is not merely about the Ancestral Master's statue being destroyed and our sect losing a bit of face. It's because the person who destroyed the statue is connected to a major plan of our sect. All junior brothers know that while this place is good, it is ultimately a cage. If we wish to live longer, or even reach higher realms, we must leave."

"Oh?" Black Impermanence's eyes flickered upon hearing this, but he disbelieved, "Senior Brother means that person can help us leave this place? Impossible, who can break the Heavenly Sword?"

Upon these words, the other elders also revealed expressions of dread. The so-called "Heavenly Sword" was naturally the Golden Core sword qi suspended high above the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm. For a thousand years, it had become a nightmare in the hearts of everyone within the Secret Realm; no one dared to harbor thoughts of resisting it.

"That we cannot break it does not mean no one from the outside world can." White Impermanence chuckled lightly. "The Ancestral Master had a plan long ago. As long as we manage to capture this person, we can naturally use their strength to break open that accursed Heavenly Sword."

White Impermanence's words were assertive, exuding immense confidence. Although Black Impermanence and the others still harbored doubts, since White Impermanence had clearly stated this was the Ancestral Master's plan, they no longer insisted on their own opinions.

Just then, two more auras appeared within the grand hall. On the empty seats, two figures, still somewhat ethereal, emerged: one holding a brush and a book, the other suspending a bright mirror high. These were the last two elders.

"The Civil and Martial Judges have also revived!" White Impermanence burst into laughter upon seeing this. "Excellent! Day and Night Roaming Deities, please make your move. Once the target is locked, Ox-Head and Horse-Face will help us quickly rush over."

The Day and Night Roaming Deities nodded upon hearing this, then both opened their Dharma Eyes. However, the next second, they froze.

"Junior brothers?" White Impermanence frowned, lowering his voice. "Could it be that the one who destroyed the Ancestral Master's statue is extremely skilled at concealment, and you cannot find their whereabouts?"

"No..." The Day and Night Roaming Deities wore expressions of disbelief, then said hesitantly, "He isn't hiding anywhere else... He's right outside the City of the Unjustly Dead!"

Outside the City of the Unjustly Dead, Lu Yang's true form stood with the Myriad Spirits Banner in hand, his hands clasped behind his back. How could he allow others to sleep soundly beside his couch? Since he intended to make the Witch-Ghost Secret Realm his base, Lu Yang naturally could not tolerate the continued existence of the Listening-Ghost Sect. Moreover, he also wished to meet the old reclusive master of the Witch-Ghost Dao behind the Listening-Ghost Sect.

"Let's say hello first." With a thought, a circular light appeared behind Lu Yang's head, clear as a mirror. Using the authority of the [Saintly Thief], he gazed down upon the city from above.

Almost simultaneously, nearly all cultivators of the Listening-Ghost Sect sensed something. However, no one understood what was happening. They only saw the witch-ghosts within their bodies suddenly beginning to riot, letting out indescribable wails.

The next second—

"Profound Yin Soul Seizing Great Law." Lu Yang slashed with his fingers joined. The circular light that had reflected the entire city silently shattered, and then a terrifying curse-killing power spread forth.

*Crack! Crack! Crack!*

Without any warning, the mortals within the City of the Unjustly Dead remained unharmed. Only the cultivators suddenly showed expressions of horror, then clutched their necks. And on their necks, a fissure appeared. Immediately after, blood gushed forth like a torrent.

"Thump!" The sound of countless heads hitting the ground converged, uniform and synchronized, transforming into a thunderous thud that instantly spread throughout the entire city!

In an instant, countless witch-ghosts, now unrestrained by their cultivators, soared into the sky, yet uncontrollably swarmed towards Lu Yang outside the city. Lu Yang, however, unfurled his Myriad Spirits Banner, devouring them like a whale sipping from the sea, refusing none. In less than an hour and a half, he had absorbed hundreds, even thousands, of witch-ghosts!

"Audacious fiend!!!" It was only then that eight streaks of scarlet, blood-like escape light surged forth from the center of the City of the Unjustly Dead. Within the lights, the Eight Elders of the Listening-Ghost Sect had eyes bulging with fury. They did not care about their nearly annihilated sect members. However, Lu Yang's act of absorbing the witch-ghosts instantly enraged them. Every single witch-ghost was crucial to the Listening-Ghost Sect; this was digging up their very roots!

White Impermanence immediately stepped forward. "You are the rogue who destroyed our sect's Ancestral Master's statue?"

Lu Yang ignored White Impermanence's question, merely glancing around as if sensing something, then looked towards the heaven-reaching divine statue within the City of the Unjustly Dead. "So it's there."

The next second, Lu Yang's figure vanished from its spot.

"What!?" The eight elders' expressions changed drastically. Subconsciously, they looked around, finally seeing Lu Yang's cross-legged figure seated atop the heaven-reaching divine statue in the city center. He lowered his gaze, looking directly at the statue, and smiled faintly:

"I have arrived as invited. Where is senior?"
