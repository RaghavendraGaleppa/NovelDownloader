# Chapter 424: The True Martial Peak

The moment the token was thrown into the earth, the entire land suddenly fell silent, even the sound of the wind freezing for a breath.

Immediately after, the waters of the pool surged backward into a waterfall that shot skyward, and a muffled thunder-like rumble came from deep underground.

The rock beneath Xu Yunfan's feet cracked inch by inch, and scorching white spiritual flames erupted from the fissures, yet they became as docile as silk when they touched the hem of his clothes.

*Boom!*

A pillar of pure energy, a hundred zhang in diameter, burst from the ground and shot into the sky.

Within the pillar, the silhouette of a玄武 (Xuanwu, Black Tortoise) coiled with a snake was faintly visible. Each scale reflected the true essence of different martial arts: the ferocity of the Flaming Dragon Cudgel, the sharpness of the Sky-Piercing Cloud Bow, and the heaviness of the Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall Hammer Technique.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered as he watched.

*So that's how it is.*

No wonder the Hundred Peaks True Master repeatedly emphasized the need to infuse one's own imprint into the Opening Peak Token. Driven by the resonance of the aura and the convergence of the earth's veins, it naturally transforms the surroundings into a Dao Field most suitable for this method.

The essence of the martial arts Xu Yunfan had painstakingly cultivated for so many years now transformed into tangible Dao patterns, climbing up the pillar along with the energy.

The sea of clouds was torn apart by a massive vortex, and the layer of celestial wind in the Nine Heavens was forcefully indented.

The process of the mountain's growth was like a divine miracle.

First, seventy-two bronze pillars broke through the earth and stood tall, their bodies entwined with the phantom of a flood dragon, as if it were a living creature.

Then, the rock layers surged like waves. Every protruding boulder rose like a tide, one higher than the other, eventually submerging the bronze pillars.

When the mountain's height reached a thousand zhang, its trajectory suddenly changed, rising from the ground to pierce the heavens like a Xuanwu raising its head.

The eastern cliff face resembled turtle shell patterns, with every natural groove aligning with the Big Dipper. The western cliff was like a giant snake coiling, and within its winding twists, it formed natural sword marks of nine turns and eighteen bends.

The entire peak was浑然天成 (perfectly natural), possessing both the heaviness of a Xuanwu suppressing the mountains and the sharpness of a sword taking an unconventional path.

Midway up the mountain, clouds and mist swirled. Seventy-two natural stone steps spiraled upward like a dragon's spine, each step glowing with a jade-green luster.

Even more wondrously, these stone steps adjusted their angles on their own as the mountain grew, eventually forming a perfect Taiji diagram at the height of a thousand zhang.

The surface of the mountain continuously shed rock layers, revealing the内部 (interior) crystalline, jade-like玄武岩 (basalt) bedrock. The natural patterns on these bedrocks completely matched the flow of spiritual power within Xu Yunfan's body.

Whenever a mountain wind blew past, the entire peak would emit a sound like clashing metal, as if thousands of divine weapons were resonating within the rock layers.

Xu Yunfan raised his eyebrows at this sight, then quickly relaxed.

Since the ancient True Master of Martial Deity was a True Master of the Primordial Origin Sect, the cultivation methods he practiced must have been collected by the Primordial Origin Sect. There was no need to worry about leakage now.

Besides, if one could glimpse the true scripture just by looking at the flow of spiritual power, that wouldn't be a person, but an Immortal.

The most astonishing changes occurred inside the mountain.

As the earth's veins were connected, the originally scattered spiritual energy was forcibly condensed into nine dragon-shaped spiritual veins.

These spiritual veins emitted sounds of clashing metal as they traveled through the rock layers. Wherever they passed, thirty-six natural caves were born, such as the "Weapon Tomb," "Smelting Furnace," and "Sword Trial."

Among them, the "True Martial Cave" at the very peak was located at the intersection of the nine spiritual veins, constantly erupting with astonishingly pure spiritual energy.

When the final piece of rock settled into place, the entire peak suddenly let out a cry that sounded like the harmony of a turtle and a snake.

Xu Yunfan stepped on a rainbow and ascended to the summit. Every step he took caused the mountain to resonate.

"True Martial Peak..."

He gently stroked the carapace of the Xuanwu statue at the summit, and a three-headed, six-armed Dharma Form rose behind him.

At the foot of the mountain, the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect who had rushed over upon hearing the news watched in shock.

How could everyone not understand that another True Master had emerged from the Primordial Origin Sect.

"Foundation Establishment..."

Among the gathered Primordial Origin Sect disciples at the foot of the mountain, an inner disciple of Hundred Peaks clenched a jade slip in his hand so tightly his knuckles turned white.

"Foundation Establishment... So this is Foundation Establishment."

His voice trembled, his eyes reflecting the figure atop True Martial Peak. "I've苦修 (bitterly cultivated) for nearly two hundred years, yet I can't even touch the threshold of Foundation Establishment..."

A female disciple from the Medicine Peak beside him stared blankly at the figure stepping up the rainbow and murmured, "I heard that this Xu Shidi has been in the sect for less than sixty years?"

Her words were full of bitterness. "My master went into seclusion three times to challenge Foundation Establishment. The last time... not even his bones remained."

At the edge of the crowd, several disciples in gray servant uniforms were even paler.

Inner and outer disciples still had some hope, but these servant disciples were even more miserable than temporary laborers.

With the successful opening of True Martial Peak, the True Masters of the Primordial Origin Sect naturally understood that another Foundation Establishment practitioner had been added under True Lord Qingyuan's command.

"He really is lucky. In the midst of this sudden rise, I haven't even been able to calculate his karma clearly."

"The heavenly secrets are gradually becoming murky. Presumably, he was targeted the moment he came out."

"It doesn't make sense. Is Foundation Establishment this easy?"

In a great hall within the Primordial Origin Sect, several figures gathered. One of them was lost in deep thought.

He had naturally noticed the first moment Xu Yunfan cultivated the True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture. After coming out of the Divine Martial World, he had noticed it immediately and secretly laid down chess pieces to guide the karma. He never expected that after just a brief seclusion, Xu Yunfan had turned around and successfully established his foundation.

This truly caught him off guard.

After a moment of silence, someone in the hall sighed.

"That empty position, that True Lord probably won't let it go."

"The matter is already settled. Let's think of another way. I remember there are still a few Dao veins in the sect that haven't proven Foundation Establishment."

With this remark, the various malicious thoughts that had surfaced in the hearts of those present immediately faded.

The True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture is a method of proving the Dao through martial arts, with extremely strong combat prowess. It's a pity someone got there first.

"Eh?"

Standing at the peak of True Martial Peak, Xu Yunfan suddenly felt a needle-like warning in his mind.

He instinctively circulated the *True Martial Subduing Demon Scripture*, and the three-headed, six-armed Dharma Form suddenly solidified. The trigrams on the Xuanwu's back automatically rotated.

His spiritual sense spread like a tide over the area within a radius of ten miles, but when it touched a certain void, it suddenly collided with a web-like network of cause and effect.

Those threads should have connected him to an unknown schemer, but now they were like spider silk burned by a raging fire, melting away at a speed visible to the naked eye.

He instantly realized someone was cleaning up the residual backhands, wiping the slate clean.

Xu Yunfan's knuckles slightly bent, and the Xuanwu Dharma Form flickered in and out of existence behind him. The severed lines of cause and effect were clearly visible in his spiritual sense, like a spider web scorched by a raging fire, melting away completely at a speed visible to the naked eye.

He could naturally trace it back to the source. Under the operation of his innate divine ability, the Word of Strife, the three-headed, six-armed Dharma Form had already formed the Soul-Seeking Seal. But after the spiritual power circulated at his fingertip for three breaths, he eventually slowly dispersed it.

"So they know how to sever the tail to survive..."

The cold light in Xu Yunfan's eyes gradually faded.

To rashly go to war with other factions of the Primordial Origin Sect just after entering Foundation Establishment was not a wise move.

Moreover, True Lord Qingyuan's attitude was unclear. If he were to lose the big picture for the sake of a small gain and damage this big tree, it would be a loss that outweighs the gain.

He would记下 (record) this for today. Once the foundation of True Martial Peak is stable, these ghosts and monsters lurking in the dark will have their day of reckoning.

"Time is long. There will always be a day to settle the score. I'll just记下 (take note) for now."

Right now, he has more important things to do.

To build his own faction.
