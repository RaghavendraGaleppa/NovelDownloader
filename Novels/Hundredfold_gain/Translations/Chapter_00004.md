# Chapter 4: Breakthrough, Qi Refining First Layer  

After leaving the Transmission Hall, Qi Chuan and the others were led by the immortal master to another, smaller peak.  

"This is the Red Dust Peak. All newly admitted disciples of the main lineage stay here for a period of time. You will cultivate here until your cultivation reaches a higher level, at which point you will be granted your own independent peak," the immortal master explained.  

Qi Chuan surveyed the peak. The scenery was decent, though it paled in comparison to the Transmission Hall's peak. The spiritual energy concentration was likely lower as well.  

Still, it was more than sufficient for immortal seedlings who hadn't even reached the first layer of Qi Refining.  

Soon, Qi Chuan and the others were quickly settled.  

Scattered across Red Dust Peak were numerous tile-roofed houses. Though slightly aged, they were well-maintained and comfortable.  

On the mountainside, farmland had been set up, where mortal farmers toiled to provide food for the immortal seedlings on the peak.  

Thus, cultivation here came with no worries about food or shelter.  

With the immortal master gone, Qi Chuan chose a tile-roofed house and settled in.  

As night fell, Qi Chuan sat cross-legged on the bed inside the house. The "Evergreen Manual" lay open in his lap, illuminated by candlelight as he studied it intently.  

His time in the Transmission Hall had been limited, and his initial attempts with the Evergreen Manual had yielded only minimal results. Still, they had given him a slight foundation.  

Now, as he read, the text flowed more smoothly, though many obscure passages remained only half-understood.  

After finishing a full reading, words appeared in his vision as expected:  

**[You diligently studied the Evergreen Manual, attempting to comprehend its basics. Triggered a 5x critical hit, granting 5x rewards. Your understanding of the Evergreen Manual has improved slightly.]**  

Qi Chuan carefully savored the gains.  

Though it was only a 5x improvement, because he had studied with absolute focus this time, the rewards were actually greater than the 100x critical hit he had received from his initial cursory reading.  

At this rate, his mastery of the Evergreen Manual would progress astonishingly fast.  

**[You diligently studied the Evergreen Manual, attempting to comprehend its basics. Triggered a 3x critical hit, granting 3x rewards. Your understanding of the Evergreen Manual has improved slightly.]**  

**[You diligently studied the Evergreen Manual, attempting to comprehend its basics. Triggered an 11x critical hit, granting 11x rewards. Your understanding of the Evergreen Manual has improved slightly.]**  

...  

Through relentless effort, time passed swiftly.  

In just one night, Qi Chuan had fully comprehended the Evergreen Manual.  

This speed was nothing short of extraordinary.  

After all, this was complete comprehension—meaning his future cultivation would proceed without major obstacles.  

Without true understanding, rash attempts at cultivation could lead to failure at best, and harm to his meridians at worst.  

"Next, I just need to successfully sense the spiritual energy drifting in the world, draw it into my body, refine it into my first strand of true spiritual power, and then I can shed my mortal shell and become a true cultivator—a first-layer Qi Refining immortal!"  

Qi Chuan's heart swelled with excitement.  

Striking while the iron was hot, he ignored his fatigue and immediately assumed the cultivation posture described in the Evergreen Manual. Closing his eyes, he began sensing spiritual energy.  

For those without spiritual power, sensing spiritual energy was incredibly difficult.  

Thanks to his spiritual root, Qi Chuan could faintly perceive an elusive, ethereal presence in the void.  

Yet, that presence was formless and fleeting, making it nearly impossible to pinpoint its location, let alone draw it into his body.  

"This must be the disadvantage of having an eighth-grade spiritual root—it's just too low."  

Qi Chuan sighed. The resonance and harmony with spiritual energy were deeply tied to the quality of one's spiritual root.  

With no other choice, he had to force his way through.  

**[You attempted to sense the spiritual energy drifting in the world. Triggered a 2x critical hit, granting 2x rewards. Your experience in sensing spiritual energy improved slightly.]**  

The first attempt ended in failure.  

But Qi Chuan wasn't discouraged—his experience in sensing spiritual energy had improved.  

The next attempt would be easier.  

He immediately tried again.  

**[You attempted to sense the spiritual energy drifting in the world. Triggered a 5x critical hit, granting 5x rewards. Your experience in sensing spiritual energy improved slightly.]**  

**[You attempted to sense the spiritual energy drifting in the world. Triggered a 3x critical hit, granting 3x rewards. Your experience in sensing spiritual energy improved slightly.]**  

He wanted to continue, but suddenly, his head swayed, and his eyelids grew heavy.  

His mind felt muddled, and his reactions slowed.  

"Is this the result of exhausting too much of my soul energy?"  

Qi Chuan was startled.  

After all, he was still a mortal. Both his body and soul energy were weak.  

Sensing spiritual energy consumed a significant amount of soul energy.  

If he exhausted it completely without recovery, he might become a mindless fool.  

He immediately stopped cultivating, went out to eat breakfast, then returned and collapsed into sleep.  

After a long rest, he woke up, shook his head, and felt somewhat recovered. His soul energy seemed to have replenished.  

Only then did he dare attempt sensing spiritual energy again.  

Days passed.  

With the mortals outside providing for them, the immortal seedlings could cultivate without worries.  

The path of immortality lay before them—cultivation manuals in hand, spiritual energy abundant in their surroundings. Thus, all the immortal seedlings kept to themselves, devoting themselves to cultivation in hopes of becoming true immortals.  

However, though they lacked nothing, the first step of cultivation proved a stumbling block for many.  

Their spiritual roots were simply too poor—ninth-grade, the lowest possible quality.  

Comprehending the mysteries of the Evergreen Manual, sensing spiritual energy, drawing it into their bodies, and refining it into true spiritual power—each step was fraught with obstacles.  

Thus, after all these days, not a single one had successfully broken through to the first layer of Qi Refining. Many wore expressions of frustration.  

But for Qi Chuan, this didn't seem particularly difficult.  

One month later.  

**[You drew spiritual energy into your body, circulated it through one cycle, and triggered a 100x critical hit, granting 100x rewards. You successfully refined a strand of spiritual power, advancing to the first layer of Qi Refining.]**  

On the bed, Qi Chuan sat cross-legged as a strand of ethereal energy flowed through his meridians. After completing a full cycle, it finally reached his lower abdomen and settled into his dantian.  

The moment it entered, the energy's color, state, and even the fluctuations it emitted underwent a transformation.  

Only now had this strand of spiritual energy truly become Qi Chuan's spiritual power—something he could command at will to unleash formidable might.  

Shua!  

Qi Chuan's eyes snapped open. A glint flashed in his dark pupils, radiating an awe-inspiring authority.  

"Excellent."  

After sensing the changes within his body, Qi Chuan smiled faintly, though inwardly, he was ecstatic.  

Earlier, he had managed to draw spiritual energy into his body, but it had dissipated before he could refine it into spiritual power.  

This time, he had felt he was just a step away from success. Believing he was bound to fail, he had resolved to try again later.  

But then came the 100x critical hit, saving him the trouble.  

Today, he had finally become a true cultivator.  

If he were to appear in the mortal towns of the Qi family now, everyone would bow respectfully and address him as "Immortal Master." None would dare slight him.  

Yet, his path of cultivation had only just begun.  

At this moment, he could feel the strand of spiritual power within him emitting profound fluctuations, slowly tempering his body.  

For now, his body was still mortal.  

But with the presence of spiritual power, this tempering would gradually strengthen him, eventually transforming him into a martial arts master of the mortal world—physically formidable, immune to illness, and resistant to most poisons.
