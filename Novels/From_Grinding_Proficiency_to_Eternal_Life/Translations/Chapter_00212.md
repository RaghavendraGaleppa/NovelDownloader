# Chapter 212: True Blood General

The silver-armored general hastily threw his sword, but he saw the youth retract his bones and tuck his stomach in mid-air. As the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer flew from his grasp, the Qilin tail tip at the end of the hammer handle precisely pierced the general's throat.

Amidst the great rout triggered by the commander's death, Xu Yunfan stepped on the silver-armored general's尚未倒下的 corpse, raising his blood-stained hammer head towards the southeast as he watched the Great Qian army on the verge of collapse.

Zhan Yan slammed his pair of heavy hammers into the ground. "Satisfying! Much more satisfying than when I taught this little brat back then!"

Xu Yunfan was about to speak when his gaze lifted slightly.

Time seemed to freeze.

The moment the ten-foot-long black spear pierced through the rain curtain, nine layers of afterimages from the trembling spear tip were reflected in Xu Yunfan's pupils.

The兽化 right arm of the True Blood General, burning his essence blood, was covered in black scales. The spear shaft friction with the air actually ignited a ghostly blue flame.

"Be careful..."

Zhan Yan's warning turned into blood foam in his throat.

The black spear, like a venomous dragon,钻入 his left shoulder blade. The spiral energy within the spear shaft erupted, twisting the knotted muscles into碎末.

When the two-hundred-seventy-jin heavy body was lifted off the ground, this iron-cast old man seemed as light as a布偶.

Xu Yunfan's foot shattered the blue bricks into powder.

The Lin state pushed to its limit, the world in his eyes褪去了 color.

The blood droplets spraying from Zhan Yan's wound hung suspended in the air; he could see the firelight reflected in each drop. The pulsing blood vessels at the True Blood General's neck jumped seven times, corresponding to the unique energy circulation method of the Cang Lang Jin. The falling position of the蛟马 iron hooves was precisely the optimal force application point for the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method's "Collapsing Cloud Splitting Moon" stance.

Xu Yunfan's right arm muscles suddenly swelled. The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength, boiling with blood energy, nearly expanded the muscle volume of his right arm by three to four times, turning it into a畸形巨臂.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer flew from his grasp, but it wasn't thrown at the enemy.

The armor-piercing cone tip at the end of the hammer handle precisely caught the scale patterns on the spear shaft. The knuckles, driven by the Hundred Tempered玄钢 Body, turned cyan-gold. He actually used a single hand to hold the hammer handle and stopped the ten-foot-long black spear that was lifting Zhan Yan.

"Overestimating yourself!"

The True Blood General狞笑 as he retracted the spear, his兽化 right arm muscles swelling three圈.

Xu Yunfan顺势 soared into the air. The Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength compressed to the extreme in his foot arches then erupted, allowing him to逆冲 up the spear shaft! Each step landed with a clang of metal, leaving seven depressed footprints on the spear body.

"Let go!"

The black spear suddenly高频 trembled, and the wolf-head mouth at the tip burst with刺目 blue light.

Xu Yunfan's right sleeve exploded. Sparks from the collision between the Hundred Tempered玄钢 Body and the Cang Lang Jin划出 a ten-zhang fire dragon in the night sky.

But the hand holding the hammer remained motionless. Instead,借着 the recoil force, he spun and swung the hammer.

The Twelfth Stance of the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method, "Coiling Silk Penetrating Marrow," broke through层层 shackles at this moment.

The moment the hammer head struck the spear shaft, the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength split into nine spiral energies penetrating inside, actually震出 a spider-web crack on the spear body made of陨铁.

The True Blood General's mount嘶鸣ed as it reared up, its兽化 right palm slapping towards the youth's天灵盖.

Xu Yunfan did not dodge or evade. The muscles at the base of his neck pulled tight like fibers,青筋交错 like intertwined green pythons. As he raised his head, his forehead硬接 the palm strike.

The True Blood General暴退 three steps, the black spear犁ing a deep沟 in the ground.

Xu Yunfan's face also turned crimson, but he used the卸力 method of the Hundred Tempered玄钢 Body to生生 take this palm,跨出 a step forward, seizing the opportunity to grab Zhan Yan.

When he turned, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer had already clashed seven times with the再次刺来的 black spear. Each collision炸开 a环状气浪,掀飞 all the corpses within a thirty-zhang radius.

"Seeking death!"

The兽化 general挑起 the long spear with both hands, tearing through the空,迸发尖啸.

He全身燃起血色气焰, and behind him faintly appeared the shadow of a苍狼 swallowing the moon.

This was the异象 of burning True Blood to the extreme.

Xu Yunfan's spine, the great dragon,发出不堪重负的悲鸣.

Under the overload operation of the Lin state, he clearly felt his muscle fibers断裂ing, but he still精准 calculated the opponent's thirteen force application破绽.

The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer completed its蓄势 at this moment, the hammer head vibrating so高频 it泛起暗红.

When the blood-colored wolf shadow pounced to the front, Xu Yunfan made a move that made everyone瞠目. He主动震碎 his left arm bone, compressing the Red Python Coiling Mountain Strength into a锥形气劲 and bursting it from the wound!

碎骨 and blood mist turned into a暴雨梨花, temporarily遮蔽 the wolf shadow's致命扑击.

The moment the True Blood General's vision was blocked, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer had already passed through the blood-colored curtain.

"Eight Wastes Returning Flow."

This hammer was the Seventeenth Stance of the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Method, containing the ultimate power of the hammer method. Several force application methods叠加 thirteen layers of spiral energy. Before the hammer arrived, the风压 had already剥落 all the black scales on the兽化 general's chest.

The dull sound of the hammer轰入 the chest震碎琉璃瓦 within a hundred zhang radius.

A blood hole炸开 on the True Blood General's back,碎骨 and内脏喷溅 on the cliffs of Shenbing Ridge.

His mount哀鸣ed as it跪地, dying with blood pouring from its seven orifices.

Xu Yunfan踉跄落地, his left arm软垂 like cotton.

The moment the Lin state was released, he heard his own heart发出瓷器开裂般的脆响.

But his gaze remained fixed on the深处 of the烟尘, where half a焦黑躯体 was twitching in a pool of blood.

The next instant, a鲜嫩, vigorous大手探出 from the焦黑痕迹. Then, a雄壮男子,全身不着寸缕, broke out from the焦黑躯体.

"I underestimated you, but I am the Cang Lang True Blood..."

He looked up at the full moon in the sky, a癫狂 look of surviving a disaster on his face.

"At full moon, my strength will rise to another level. This time, I will use everything to..."

The True Blood General's words were未完 when he heard a clear sound of a玄钢 mechanism suddenly响起. The龙吞口 of the鎏金锏 was弹出 by the机关 of the玄钢 mechanism box. A令人心悸的气息 immediately弥漫 the entire battlefield.

Xu Yunfan's knuckles stroked the鎏金锏, then he grabbed it.

The moment the鎏金锏 was drawn, the air moisture within a hundred meters evaporated into mist.

The nine dragon patterns coiled around the锏 body lit up sequentially, each dragon's eyes跃动 with golden flames.

Xu Yunfan's脚下青砖熔作琉璃, the Hundred Tempered玄钢 Body actually被神兵余温灼得泛起赤红.

The sound rolling in the True Blood General's throat was生生按了回去, his eyeballs almost popping out of their sockets.

"Divine Weapon?!"

This Great Qian general,特意抽调 from Yanbei Dao, had just grabbed the玄墨长枪 when Xu Yunfan,踏着熔岩浪涛,欺近身前.

The starting stance of the Nine Profound亢龙锏法 had not even been fully executed, but the air within three zhang had already燃起金色火焰.

"This is..."

The True Blood General's兽瞳骤缩,仓促架起 the black spear in the Cang Lang defensive stance.

The first cane, "Collapsing Mountain Stance,"斜劈而下.

A simple vertical劈 action,却叠加 nine layers of different frequency tremors.

The moment the cane锋 touched the spear shaft, the ten-foot-long black spear forged from陨铁, like琉璃,节节崩碎.

The scales on the True Blood General's兽化 right arm卷起,指骨在冲击波中化作齑粉.

The second cane, "Sweeping Six Harmonies," followed closely.

On the横扫 trajectory of the鎏金锏, the Red Python strength surged蓬勃, and nine fire龙虚影凭空浮现.

The True Blood General's body蒸腾的 True Blood狼烟 only坚持 half a息, then熔作 steam in the龙炎.
