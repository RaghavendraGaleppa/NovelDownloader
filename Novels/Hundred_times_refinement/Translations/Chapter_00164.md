# Chapter 112: The Sect Leader's Disciple  

Lin Xuan had his own plans. To obtain discarded pills, he needed to secure a certain status within the Spirit Medicine Mountain. If he could become an elder, he would naturally have the authority to freely access the discarded pill repository.  

Although the management of discarded pills here was stricter compared to Floating Cloud Valley, they were still not finished medicinal products—there would inevitably be loopholes to exploit.  

Unlike other sects, the status of cultivators in Spirit Medicine Mountain wasn't determined by their realm or strength but by their alchemy skills.  

To attract attention, Lin Xuan deliberately refined one mid-grade pill while letting the other two fail. This choice was deliberate—if all three had succeeded, it would have been too shocking. While he wanted to catch the sect leader's eye, he also understood the principle of going too far.  

After carefully considering his approach, Lin Xuan felt there were no flaws in his plan. He then sat cross-legged and began cultivating. Elder Tongyu would only inspect the results the next day, and Lin Xuan didn’t want to waste time.  

---  

A day later, Lin Xuan successfully joined Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

"Immortal Master, this will be your residence. If there’s anything unsatisfactory or missing, please let me know."  

A young man in his twenties spoke respectfully—the same outer disciple who had escorted them into the sect the previous day.  

"Mm, it’s fine. You may leave."  

"Yes!"  

Lin Xuan examined the cave dwelling before him. It had been modified from a natural cavern but was far from crude, adorned with refined elegance.  

It had everything—a living quarters, a cultivation room, a reception hall, and a storage room.  

Most notably, at the back of the cave, there was a separate alchemy chamber. Through ingenious formations, it drew upon the earth’s fire veins.  

Lin Xuan stepped outside and saw a faint blue light barrier. He flipped his hand, revealing a waist token, and with a light swipe, the barrier parted, opening a passage just wide enough for one person.  

Pushing open the stone door, he entered the alchemy chamber. It spanned several hundred square meters, with a deep channel in the center leading underground. At its entrance was an iron-cast beast head, its mouth wide open. By activating a spell, one could summon the earth’s fire.  

This alchemy chamber was clearly far superior to the one he had used during the test.  

After touring the cave dwelling, Lin Xuan was very satisfied, though his expression was somewhat complicated—neither purely happy nor worried.  

To gain Elder Tongyu’s attention, he had deliberately refined a mid-grade pill. His original intention was to strike a balance—not too ostentatious, yet demonstrating decent alchemy talent.  

But the result was different from what he had imagined...  

---  

It wasn’t that Lin Xuan’s approach was wrong, but rather that he—like most cultivators—had too little understanding of alchemy.  

Take Floating Cloud Valley, for example. While it wasn’t a renowned sect in the broader cultivation world, it was among the top in Yanzhou. Yet, its alchemists could only refine low-grade pills.  

Mid-grade pills were only one rank higher, but the difficulty of refining them was incomparable to low-grade pills.  

Even in Spirit Medicine Mountain, only about half of the cultivators could refine mid-grade pills, and apart from a select few, their success rates were generally low.  

Lin Xuan, a complete novice who had merely skimmed a few alchemy manuals without any systematic training, had refined a mid-grade pill. While luck played a part, it was enough to prove his extraordinary talent.  

Elder Tongyu’s misjudgment wasn’t his fault—no one could have guessed that Lin Xuan could turn waste into treasure.  

Such a genius appeared only once in a century. Coupled with Lin Xuan’s Foundation Establishment cultivation—giving him more time to study alchemy than Qi Condensation disciples—Elder Tongyu held him in even higher regard.  

On the spot, he declared his intention to take Lin Xuan as his disciple.  

In terms of cultivation, Elder Tongyu was only at the mid-Foundation Establishment stage, barely surpassing Lin Xuan. He wasn’t qualified to be his master in that regard. But when it came to alchemy, Elder Tongyu was unparalleled in the entire Youzhou cultivation world. The so-called apprenticeship was solely for passing down this skill.  

Lin Xuan had no reason to refuse. Under the shade of a great tree, one enjoys the cool. With the sect leader as his master, his status in Spirit Medicine Mountain would rise, bringing him closer to his goal.  

Yet fortune and misfortune often intertwine. Originally, he had joined Spirit Medicine Mountain solely for the discarded pills. But now, as Elder Tongyu’s disciple...  

Lin Xuan took out several jade slips from his robe, containing Spirit Medicine Mountain’s centuries-old alchemy secrets—formulas for various pills, ingredient ratios, heat control techniques, precautions, and the insights of past masters.  

They were invaluable, yet Lin Xuan sighed. It wasn’t that he looked down on alchemy, but the art was vast and profound, far from easy to master. A person’s energy was limited, and Lin Xuan didn’t want to be distracted.  

Still, he had to put in some effort—otherwise, he’d have no excuse when his master questioned him. Lin Xuan infused his divine sense into the jade slips and began studying.  

Unlike the ordinary alchemy manuals he had bought at the Sea Dragon Pavilion, the contents of these jade slips were profound. Lin Xuan soon became engrossed.  

---  

Time flew by. Unknowingly, three months had passed since Lin Xuan arrived at Spirit Medicine Mountain.  

In his cave dwelling, an ordinary-looking young man was hunched over jade slips, reading intently. Occasionally, he frowned in thought or scribbled something on the ground.  

Initially, Lin Xuan had studied the alchemy manuals merely to appease his master.  

But as he read more, he realized alchemy wasn’t as useless as he had imagined. At the very least, understanding the formulas, ratios, and heat control for various pills was immensely helpful for his purification process.  

For example, with the hundred discarded Foundation Establishment pills he carried, his initial success rate had been only twenty percent. But after studying the manuals, even though his cultivation remained at the first layer of Foundation Establishment, he could now purify one successful pill out of every three discarded ones.  

Moreover, the reason alchemy consumed so much energy was that becoming a skilled alchemist required constant practice.  

Lin Xuan, however, merely read extensively, which didn’t take much time. In fact, flipping through alchemy books after meditation became a form of relaxation.  

Though his goal was the discarded pills, Lin Xuan hadn’t taken any action in these three months. Haste makes waste. As the sect leader’s disciple, he was still new. Acting too conspicuously would arouse suspicion.  

Besides, as a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a lifespan of two hundred years, waiting a little longer was nothing. Lin Xuan preferred to act with caution.  

He wouldn’t act unless success was guaranteed.  

Of course, he hadn’t been idle these three months. He purified the discarded pills he had bought at the Treasure Hunt Convention, consuming one daily for cultivation. Though the small quantity meant little progress in his realm, it at least stabilized his Foundation Establishment foundation.  

The path of cultivation was long. Beyond Qi Condensation, Foundation Establishment was also about laying a solid foundation.  

The rest of his time was spent reading. Spirit Medicine Mountain had a thousand-year legacy. Though it excelled only in alchemy and lacked outstanding cultivation techniques, Lin Xuan browsed through everything, believing that even stones from other hills could polish jade. He gained some insights.  

He had no intention of mastering alchemy, but through osmosis, he absorbed some knowledge.  

As a sect renowned for alchemy, Spirit Medicine Mountain naturally grew many spirit herbs. Lin Xuan obtained a hundred stalks of Red Vine Grass from the herb garden.  

After a day, he purified them all.  

Both the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art and concealing his cultivation required this herb, but carrying the liquid form was inconvenient.  

---  

Previously, Lin Xuan had no alternative. Now, after reading so many alchemy manuals, he decided to experiment.  

In the alchemy chamber, he activated a spell, and the beast’s mouth spewed roaring earthfire.  

He poured the purified Red Vine Grass liquid into the cauldron and began refining.  

This was a new type of pill, with no prior experience to reference.  

But Lin Xuan was confident. According to the books he had read, the more ingredients a pill required, the harder it was to refine.  

Take the Marrow Cleansing Pill, for example—it required nine main ingredients and dozens of supplementary ones.  

Foundation Establishment pills had even more staggering ingredient lists.  

That was why such pills were so difficult to refine successfully.  

Lin Xuan, however, was using only one ingredient—Red Vine Grass liquid. Even if his skills were lacking, the chance of failure was minuscule.  

Moreover, low-grade Red Vine Grass wasn’t precious. If he failed a few times, he could simply fetch more from the herb garden. As the sect leader’s disciple, he could obtain as much as he wanted.  

With this mindset, Lin Xuan refined with ease.  

---  

Perhaps it was his calm state of mind, or perhaps the simplicity of using a single ingredient, but the process went smoothly.  

Two hours later, Lin Xuan opened the cauldron and was greeted by a refreshing fragrance.  

A flicker of joy crossed his face as he waved his hand, summoning hundreds of green pills into a bottle.
