# Chapter 57: The Nine Nether Valley, the Hand-Spider King  

The Nine Nether Valley was located southeast of the Ancient Immortal Forest, resembling a basin with complex terrain—dense woods, ruins, rocky fields, swamps, and small lakes.  

The Ancient Immortal Forest was a general term for the boundary separating the mortal world from the cultivation realm.  

Such places couldn’t be reached directly by floating ships. No sect would establish dedicated routes for hunting expeditions—it simply wasn’t cost-effective. After all, cultivators who engaged in hunting were few, and they didn’t venture out every day. Most who enjoyed hunting were at the Golden Core stage or above, and those cultivators rarely needed floating ships.  

Thus, Xiao Ji and his companion had to first take a floating ship to the nearest point and then switch to other means of transportation before finally trekking the rest of the way to the Nine Nether Valley.  

Such was the hardship of early-stage cultivators.  

Those at the Golden Core stage and beyond could fly on artifacts, but those below had to rely on other methods.  

Despite its grand-sounding name, the Nine Nether Valley was actually one of the most common hunting grounds for cultivators and the closest one to the Ancient City.  

Occasionally, Xiao Ji spotted cultivators flying overhead—some in a hurry, others leisurely gliding.  

At that moment, he saw a sword-riding cultivator dragging a massive beast through the air, flaunting his haul as he flew low and slow.  

"Why doesn’t he just store the beast in a spatial artifact?" Qian Duoyu asked, having noticed the same sight.  

"Have you ever fished before?" Xiao Ji countered with an odd question instead of answering.  

Qian Duoyu thought for a moment before nodding. "I have, but I never caught anything. It’s a boring game."  

"Let’s go," Xiao Ji changed the subject, pulling out a map of the Nine Nether Valley. "We’re currently in the northern part of the valley. The Skywing Tiger Demons we’re after live in the south. I suggest taking a detour to the left. Cutting straight through the middle might expose us to unnecessary dangers."  

Qian Duoyu, however, insisted on using a specialized pathfinding artifact he had brought along, claiming it was too good not to use.  

Xiao Ji didn’t object. The wealthy young master could do as he pleased.  

Qian Duoyu then summoned a magical hound from his gilded spatial ring. Under the lively dog’s guidance, they successfully wandered straight into the territory of spider demons. The poor hound was swiftly ensnared in a massive web before being dragged away by a hand-spider—eaten alive as it retreated.  

These spider demons were peculiar—their limbs resembled human arms, while their bodies and faces remained distinctly arachnid.  

"Such a waste of a good pathfinding hound," Qian Duoyu lamented, clearly distressed by the loss. "I spent ten thousand spirit stones snatching it from someone else."  

Xiao Ji could tell—this rich young master was often swindled and lacked caution. That useless pet hound had no survival skills whatsoever; it was only good for petting.  

"Right now, we need to get out of here," Xiao Ji said, scanning their surroundings. "We seem to be surrounded."  

He had anticipated this outcome when following the dog. These spider demons were low-level and posed no real threat, so he had allowed it to happen—just to prove that Qian Duoyu’s gadgets were unreliable and shouldn’t be used again.  

But Qian Duoyu didn’t seem to grasp the lesson. He pulled out a tattered piece of cloth from his spatial artifact.  

"What’s that?" Xiao Ji asked.  

"An invisibility cloak," Qian Duoyu explained. "I met a mysterious merchant in the Ancient City a few days ago. That skinny guy sold me his family heirloom for just five hundred spirit stones—even threw in a map of the Ancient City! There were plenty of witnesses who confirmed its authenticity."  

"Five hundred **Profound-grade** spirit stones, right?" Xiao Ji knew this young master only dealt in high-tier currency.  

Which meant five thousand **Yellow-grade** spirit stones.  

This spendthrift.  

Just from the description, Xiao Ji recognized the scam—a classic trick targeting newcomers to the Ancient City. The swindler had even worked for him before. And those so-called "witnesses"? All accomplices.  

Before Xiao Ji could say more, Qian Duoyu draped the ragged cloth over them both and urged them forward.  

They hadn’t taken more than a few steps before the spider demons struck.  

One leaped in front of them, blocking their path. Seven or eight more surrounded them, with two even perched above.  

"Huh?" Qian Duoyu frowned. "How can they see us?"  

"Because they have eyes," Xiao Ji said dryly. "Unless they’re blind, of course they can see."  

"But my—"  

"But why didn’t your rag work? Because you got scammed. You spent a fortune on a worthless piece of cloth—even restaurants wouldn’t use it to wipe tables." Xiao Ji decided it was time for a harsh lesson.  

"No matter, I’ve got more—" Qian Duoyu began rummaging through his spatial ring again.  

"Stop," Xiao Ji drew his sword, keeping the spiders at bay. "Don’t bother. I just want to know—why does a Qi Path cultivator like you hoard so much junk? You’re not even an Artifact Path specialist."  

"Well, I originally wanted to practice the Artifact Path," Qian Duoyu admitted. "I told my father, and he immediately hired dozens of Qi Path masters to train me. At first, I didn’t know any better, so I went along with it. By the time I realized, it was too late to change… I really do want to switch."  

A simple homophone had altered the course of this wealthy cultivator’s life.  

"I know an Artifact Path cultivator who’s an expert at disguises," Xiao Ji offered. "If you ever seriously want to switch paths, I can introduce you."  

The hand-spiders were preparing to strike.  

"Stay still. I’ll draw a barrier around you—don’t step out, or I can’t protect you," Xiao Ji warned. "These hand-spiders aren’t strong, but there are too many of them, and their webs are sticky. If you run, they’ll snatch you."  

Qian Duoyu finally felt a flicker of fear as he took in the glowing blue eyes surrounding them.  

"Swish—"  

A violet sword light flashed upward, slicing an ambushing spider in half. Thick green fluid burst from its bisected body, splattering onto Qian Duoyu’s head.  

He tossed aside the now-ruined "invisibility cloak" and sniffed. "Fellow Daoist Xiao, these spiders actually smell… fruity?"  

Xiao Ji ignored the observation. With his left hand, he telekinetically blocked spiders lunging at Qian Duoyu, while his right wielded his sword in a relentless dance, cutting down one spider after another.  

Most of these spiders were only first-tier, fifth-grade—something Qian Duoyu, as a fifth-layer Qi Refining cultivator, could handle one-on-one. But Xiao Ji wanted to finish this quickly so they could hunt the Skywing Tiger Demons.  

Yet, as if fate enjoyed mocking his plans, the moment he wished to speed things up, complications arose.  

Even with his ability to foresee dangers, accidents still happened.  

Now, within a hundred zhang, the Hand-Spider King of this territory was rapidly closing in.  

"We might be in trouble," Xiao Ji muttered, sensing the approaching presence while continuing to cut down the lesser spiders. "Get ready to defend yourself."
