# Chapter 21: A Long and Arduous Journey

First, he would cast rain, then plop down in the spirit field. He would sit for an entire morning. After lunch, he continued. The result was: with Ding Rui's astonishing work enthusiasm, by the afternoon, all the spirit rice plants in the entire spirit field had been processed by him!

Dusk was approaching. Ding Rui was still sitting in the spirit field. Another spirit rice plant had been processed, leaving only the last one. Liu Yun had finished his work and called out from a distance, "Little Ding, are you done?"

"Brother Liu, you go ahead. I have a little bit left; I'll be done soon," Ding Rui replied, looking up. He sat back down and took a deep breath. Throughout the afternoon, he had finally relied on his skill slots to complete all the work. As for this last plant, he still intended to complete it using his own abilities. He wanted to see if the continuous use of his skills throughout the afternoon had increased his proficiency, even by a tiny bit. Had it cultivated even the faintest trace of muscle memory?

Ding Rui extended both hands, placing them over the spirit rice and the weeds respectively, then mobilized the True Essence within his body. Instantly, the Golden and Wooden True Essences responded, flowing rapidly to his hands, then piercing into the spirit rice and weeds one after another. Although they still couldn't synchronize, Ding Rui's heart filled with joy! He could feel that, though very subtle, his True Essence had improved compared to his attempt at noon! Immediately, Ding Rui felt a great deal of pressure lift from him. As long as there was improvement, it meant this path was viable, and there was a chance to reach the end and succeed.

Having nothing left to do, Ding Rui suddenly found himself idle. The reason he stayed up so late yesterday, besides his two self-attempts, was primarily a trip to the logistics department. He couldn't leave the spirit field during work hours to earn money in other spirit fields. The sect had set up a formation at the entrance of the spirit fields, which could not be easily opened from either outside or inside during work hours. Once triggered, it could attract outer disciples managing the spirit fields. Ding Rui dared not court trouble. So, he could only reluctantly sit under a nearby tree and begin studying his next cultivation technique, the *Condensing Yang Art*. Since Wood generates Fire, the *Condensing Yang Art* still seemed to pose no difficulty for Ding Rui. He was confident he could complete its cultivation within two months. But then, thinking of the slow fusion speed of the [Golden Ray Spear] and [Weed Removal] skills, he was again filled with helplessness.

Especially when cultivators from other spirit fields saw that Spirit Field 377 was completely full of spirit rice, with not a single plant lost. While their own spirit fields had already lost a plant here and a patch there, they sincerely hoped that Ding Rui would emerge to accomplish great things, not confining himself to just Spirit Field 377.

After two more days of this, Ding Rui solemnly announced his new business. In addition to the large aphid pests, ordinary aphids were also within the scope of his services. Eradicating ordinary aphids also required the presence of weeds. Whichever spirit field needed Ding Rui to kill more pests and remove more weeds, he would prioritize that field. Naturally, he would also prioritize dealing with the large aphids in that spirit field. And even more importantly: for pest removal and weeding, he would only charge one spirit grain every ten times!

Instantly, the entire spirit field district was shaken! Previously, there were other cultivators in the spirit field district who offered weeding services, but they charged one spirit grain for every two plants and didn't even help with pest removal. It was even less likely they would help kill large aphids! Thus, even if those people later lowered their prices to be even cheaper than Ding Rui's, they had already lost all competitiveness.

As a result, he, who originally could have broken through the Qi Refining stage and become an outer disciple in just over a month, would now have to wait four months for their spirit field harvest and the sect's rewards before he could break through. How could he possibly tolerate this? Dong Feng even felt that Ding Rui was deliberately targeting him.
