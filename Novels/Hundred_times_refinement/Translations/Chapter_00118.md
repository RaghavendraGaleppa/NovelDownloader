# Chapter 68: Spirit Control Technique and Great Perfection

Shortly after returning to the Waste Pill Room, the effects of the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art faded. Fortunately, Lin Xuan had timed it well. He sat cross-legged and began cultivating.

Six hours passed in the blink of an eye. After drinking a mouthful of the red vinegrass liquid, Lin Xuan once again activated the miraculous disguise technique, this time transforming into a sallow-faced middle-aged man.

He prepared to visit the herb garden to exchange some ginseng for his Marrow Cleansing Pills. He avoided using his true appearance to prevent drawing attention. As his cultivation deepened, Lin Xuan realized he would need various medicinal herbs frequently in the future.

Though he possessed the purification ability and only required common, unremarkable herbs, as a low-level disciple in the Spirit Movement stage, acquiring such large quantities of herbs could easily arouse suspicion. Now, with the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art, this problem was solved—he could adopt different appearances each time he visited the herb garden.

Leaving the Waste Pill Room, Lin Xuan swiftly arrived at the herb garden and easily exchanged three low-grade Marrow Cleansing Pills for over a hundred catties of ginseng—all of ordinary quality. However, Lin Xuan didn't mind. What others saw as trash, he could purify into valuable treasures.

In addition to ginseng, he also traded for a basket of low-grade red vinegrass. Although he still had plenty of purified green liquid, he needed more for concealing his cultivation level and using the Heavenly Demon Disguise Art.

Back in his room, Lin Xuan closed the door and immediately began the purification process. Drawing from his previous experience with red vinegrass, the ginseng purification proceeded smoothly, with only one or two failures. As expected, ordinary ginseng could also be purified into ginseng essence.

Unlike the liquid essence of red vinegrass, ginseng essence was a white powder, incredibly fragrant and refreshing. Lin Xuan carefully stored it in a vial. From a hundred catties of ginseng, he obtained less than two taels of essence.

Yet Lin Xuan was satisfied. Other cultivators needed thousand-year-old spiritual herbs to refine a tiny amount of ginseng essence, while he could purify ordinary ginseng from the market.

Next, Lin Xuan entered seclusion again. Following the guidance he had received at the Elite Hall, he consumed the ginseng essence to cultivate the Spirit Control Technique.

Elder Li had spoken true. No matter how hard Lin Xuan had tried before, his progress in the Spirit Control Technique had been stagnant. But after consuming the ginseng essence, the bottleneck before him seemed to vanish, and his cultivation gradually bore fruit.

Using his Inner Vision technique to inspect his dantian, Lin Xuan noticed a difference from when he took Marrow Cleansing Pills. While the pills nourished his spiritual power, allowing it to grow stronger, the ginseng essence didn't increase the quantity of his spiritual power but significantly improved its quality—deepening its color and making it more refined.

It turned out that ginseng essence could enhance the quality of spiritual power, solidifying one's foundation. Perhaps this was why it broke through the bottleneck in cultivating the Spirit Control Technique.

Day after day, Lin Xuan persevered. He consumed ginseng essence and practiced the Spirit Control Technique according to the method. When the essence ran out, he would use the disguise technique to change his appearance and return to the herb garden for more.

Three months passed in the blink of an eye.

Despite the support of spiritual herbs, the Spirit Control Technique was more challenging than expected. It took Lin Xuan a full ninety days to achieve minor success. After that, no matter how much ginseng essence he consumed, he could progress no further.

Lin Xuan wasn't anxious. With his current proficiency in the Spirit Control Technique, he could now wield spiritual tools with ease, far surpassing the effectiveness of the Object Control Technique. For a Spirit Movement stage disciple, reaching this level was already remarkable. Further progress would have to wait until after he built his foundation.

Greed was unnecessary. With minor success in the Spirit Control Technique, Lin Xuan's strength had significantly increased—not only in controlling spiritual tools but also in the refinement of his spiritual power due to continuous consumption of ginseng essence.

A cultivator's advancement was measured by the quantity of spiritual power, but with equal quantities, the more refined the spiritual power, the greater the strength. By chance, Lin Xuan discovered that ginseng essence could temper the quality of spiritual power, so he decided to consume it alongside Marrow Cleansing Pills during future cultivation.

Mastering the Spirit Control Technique not only doubled the power of spiritual tools but also allowed him to ride them through the air—a supplementary function that thrilled Lin Xuan. When he first joined the Drifting Cloud Valley, he had envied high-level cultivators who could soar through the heavens and travel thousands of miles.

Though he later learned techniques like Light Body and Wind Riding, true flight remained beyond his reach. Even with his typically composed demeanor, Lin Xuan couldn't resist sneaking out of the sect after mastering tool flight, releasing his flying sword to roam the nearby skies.

At his current level, his flight speed was still lacking—far from the legendary ability to traverse thousands of miles in an instant. But covering a hundred miles in an hour was no longer a problem.

Yet Lin Xuan remained unsatisfied. Returning to the Waste Pill Room, he resumed seclusion. His strength was still too weak. While flight didn't consume much spiritual power, wielding spiritual tools in battle would quickly deplete his current reserves. His spiritual power was still insufficient.

He pressed on, continuing his cultivation. After all, the Spirit Movement stage was merely the most basic realm of cultivation, where lifespan remained no different from that of ordinary mortals. Though it was still too early to discuss foundation building, he at least needed to reach Great Perfection as soon as possible.

With this mindset, Lin Xuan remained in seclusion, cultivating with relentless determination.

One month passed.

Then two.

A year went by.

Then two.

Finally, Lin Xuan emerged from the longest seclusion of his life. The hardships he endured were beyond words. The path of immortality grew increasingly arduous, with each breakthrough taking longer than the last.

Despite his efforts, Lin Xuan was still a mortal without innate spiritual roots. Yet with the aid of countless spiritual herbs, he finally reached the highest level of the Spirit Movement stage—Great Perfection!
