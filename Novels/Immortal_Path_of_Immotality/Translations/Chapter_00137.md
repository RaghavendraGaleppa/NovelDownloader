# Chapter 136: Forced Fruit May Not Be Sweet, But...

The Tempest Sea lay at the northernmost edge of the Eastern Sea, bordering the waters of the Great Yan Kingdom. For half the year, fierce winds raged across this region, making it largely uninhabited by humans but a paradise for demonic beasts and other sea creatures.

According to intelligence from a passing cultivator, an unnamed islet in this area served as home to a small colony of water bears, reportedly led by three at the Foundation Establishment level.

Seven days prior, Lin Shan had arrived at this location. Taking advantage of the daytime when all water bears went out to sea to hunt and play, he and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord had stealthily installed array foundations and nodes, hiding and suppressing their auras at night.

By the afternoon of the eighth day, the array was nearly complete. The Black Skeleton Demon Lord extended its bony hand toward Lin Shan.

"What?" Lin Shan was puzzled.

"Five thousand spirit stones." The skeleton's empty eye sockets stared unblinkingly at him.

"What do you mean? Your assistance was already part of our contract—now you want additional payment?"

Lin Shan nearly jumped in outrage. This fellow had already cost him fifty thousand spirit stones—wasn't that enough?

"No, activating and maintaining the array requires spiritual energy! This godforsaken place has no spirit veins to power it, so we'll have to make do with spirit stones. How else do you expect me to operate the array for you?"

Lin Shan scratched his head. At first glance, this seemed reasonable—arrays did need energy sources—but five thousand spirit stones per activation seemed excessive.

"Have you been in the underworld so long that you don't understand our world's currency system? Do you have any idea what five thousand spirit stones can buy? My annual stipend from the sect is barely over a thousand!"

Naturally, Lin Shan balked at the price. This amounted to three years of his sect allowance, equivalent to the cost of a Foundation Establishment Pill. Spending such a sum as consumables would pain anyone. An average Foundation Establishment cultivator's entire net worth might only be five thousand spirit stones!

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord remained indifferent: "What do you take high-level arrays capable of subduing Foundation Establishment beings for—cabbage? There's no such thing as getting full on scraps. Pay up or don't!"

Ultimately, the skeleton firmly maintained that as an array expert, five thousand stones represented the most cost-effective method. To secure a Foundation Establishment-level summoned creature, Lin Shan reluctantly paid, hoping this investment wouldn't go to waste. Though he still had 150,000 stones remaining, such expenditures couldn't continue indefinitely.

The demon lord produced its storage pouch and began installing the final array drivers under Lin Shan's miserly gaze.

The Tempest Sea was unusually calm today, its unnamed islet deserted as water bears frolicked in the ocean, leaving only drifting clouds above.

One cloud concealed a white-robed youth and his skeletal companion, their heads peering furtively downward while exchanging whispers.

"After spending so much, our target is capturing the strongest water bear alive!"

"Relax, I'm an array master. When they return from sea, I'll separate them. You just need to subdue our mark within the array."

"How's the Bone Banner I gave you working?"

"Perfectly. It'll handle the minor Qi Condensation pests for you."

"Look—they're returning."

Below, bear heads emerged from the waves. After swimming ashore, the creatures began playing on the beach, clearly sated from their marine activities.

Counting revealed over eighty water bears, with three Foundation Establishment-level leaders heading the colony.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord waited patiently for half a shichen (hour) until the bears dispersed across the island, then abruptly ensnared one leader within the activated array.

Brilliant light erupted across the islet as prismatic barriers shot skyward, instantly creating a crystalline labyrinth!

The mightiest Foundation Establishment leader became trapped inside, separated from its eighty-odd kin. Before they could react, thick mist rose within the prismatic world, obscuring all vision.

The stranded colony milled about in confusion until combat roars echoed from the fog—their leader was under attack!

"I've activated containment, disorientation, and Five Elements arrays. Enter now," urged the skeleton.

Lin Shan calmly observed the besieged leader enduring relentless elemental assaults—metal spears, wooden pikes, water tridents, earthen spikes, and fireballs—each strike comparable to his own Five Elements Fan's output.

"Let the array weaken it first. I'll conserve my strength for the finale."

"Suit yourself. Remember—prolonged activation burns more stones. It's your money."

At the mention of mounting costs, Lin Shan immediately descended from his Cloud-Stepping Banner.

The island's water bears had erupted into frenzy, assaulting the array upon hearing their leader's distress. Yet the Black Skeleton Demon Lord's craftsmanship proved impeccable—the prismatic barriers withstood assaults from two Foundation Establishment leaders and eighty Qi Condensation beasts, though each strike drained Lin Shan's coffers further.

Producing red-and-white beans from his storage bracelet, Lin Shan scattered them across the battlefield. Upon landing, the "Bean Soldiers" transformed into treants—thick-barked, branch-whipping brawlers engaging the bears in melee.

Golden Peachwood, a specialty of Turtle Hook Island, was renowned for its spiritual peaches rather than combat prowess. Among these Bean Soldiers were four millennial peachwood seeds—Foundation Establishment-level treants barely holding their own against two water bear leaders.

The remaining Qi Condensation treants served as punching bags, battered but stubbornly holding formation.

Meanwhile, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord unfurled its Bone Banner from the clouds, unleashing hundreds of skeletons. This master of legion warfare deployed intricate formations, stabilizing the chaotic battlefront.

With external forces balanced, Lin Shan entered the array to confront the captive leader.

Inside, the Five Elements array raged—a maelstrom of elemental attacks focused on the three-meter-tall bear, which roared defiantly while shattering incoming projectiles with mighty paw strikes.

This leader neared peak Foundation Establishment strength, employing basic water spells alongside formidable physical attacks. Yet beastly intellect limited its combat effectiveness—any late-Foundation human cultivator could match it, with proper techniques ensuring victory.

Only at Golden Core stage, when demons formed inner cores and awakened bloodline talents, could they rival human cultivators. Nascent Soul great demons—half capable of human form and speech—became truly terrifying, forcing even human elders to retreat.

The current bear leader, however, could only rage impotently against the array's illusions. Lin Shan entered wielding his Five Elements Fan and Meteoric Iron Sword, attacks harmlessly bypassing him as the skeleton-controlled array recognized allies.

Central to the storm, the thick-furred leader endured relentless assaults. Lin Shan's strategic addition of earth-element attacks—earth spears, spikes, walls, and cages—exploited elemental advantage (earth overcoming water), systematically weakening his target.

When the enraged bear charged, Lin Shan tested its strength by blocking a paw strike with his Cloud-Copper Heart Mirror.

WHAM!

The impact sent him flying ten meters, coughing blood as internal organs burned. His high-grade defensive artifact bore only a claw mark—expected for such a blow.

"Cough! Not bad... cough!"

Though unharmed, the concussive force rattled his untempered body. Having gauged his opponent, Lin Shan adopted attrition tactics under triple-array protection. Were his goal slaughter rather than capture, the bear's paws would already be severed.

Low-to-mid level cultivation battles often became endurance contests—some lasting days between evenly-matched opponents. Though water bears possessed exceptional stamina, they couldn't outlast Lin Shan's spirit stone-funded arrays and mid-grade stone replenishment.

As blood seeped from numerous sword wounds, Lin Shan seized his moment, deploying his new high-grade artifact—the Demon-Binding Lasso. While effective against cultivators, it specialized in subduing beasts.

Exhausted, the leader failed to dodge as the lasso coiled around it like a persistent serpent, binding it tightly.

Lin Shan approached the trussed three-meter bear, securing the bonds with a decorative bow (avoiding permanent knots that might hinder future use). Outside, the battle raged—his treants trading blows while the Black Skeleton Demon Lord performed a startling feat: combining a hundred skeletons into a single Foundation Establishment-level colossus!

This, alongside four golden peachwood treants, contained the remaining leaders. Rather than impressed, Lin Shan felt wary—this skeletal "puppet" of a Nascent Soul entity could achieve such marvels with mere Qi Condensation strength and a high-grade artifact! Only a protagonist like Lin Fan might rival such prowess at this level.

Turning to his captive—still snarling despite its bonds—Lin Shan produced a hammer artifact and began rhythmically concussing the beast into submission.

Dazed and nearly unconscious, the bear became vulnerable as Lin Shan activated his Summoning Banner. His spiritual sense detected numerous soul signatures within ten li—the strongest being the two external leaders. Unexpectedly, another Foundation Establishment presence approached intermittently from distance—friend or foe unknown.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord's signature appeared as an unnaturally dense black speck—its spiritual pressure belying its size.

"Focus on your task! Stop snooping!" came the skeleton's telepathic rebuke.

Chastened, Lin Shan concentrated on the pale blue signature before him—his subdued target.

Predictably, Foundation Establishment beasts possessed child-level intellect but formidable spiritual resistance. Despite repeated hammering, establishing a one-sided contract proved arduous.

"Just accept it! It's merely a summoning pact, not enslavement!"

The bear's spiritual rebuttal was clear: Would you willingly accept forced summoning?

After five minutes of mental struggle and physical hammering, the bear's defenses finally collapsed, imprinting the contract upon its consciousness.

Silence fell as the array deactivated. The foaming-mouthed bear lay unconscious while Lin Shan sat panting—forcibly contracting a Foundation Establishment beast was immensely taxing. At his current level, he could only maintain one such bond unless enhancing his summoning art further.

The reality remained: few beasts would willingly contract. Only those raised from infancy might bond voluntarily—a luxury Lin Shan's twenty-something lifespan couldn't afford. Thus, wild specimens must be taken by force.

Forced fruit might not be sweet... but its aroma was irresistible!

A Foundation Establishment beast—especially this peak-level water bear—made a valuable asset, despite being inferior to late-Foundation human opponents. As for Qi Condensation slots, his existing hundred-strong entourage and Eastern Sea "recruits" sufficed.

The battle had lasted from afternoon till dusk. Externally, the colony still fought fiercely as the Black Skeleton Demon Lord amused itself. Only the treants suffered—over half destroyed—though Lin Shan cared little for these expendable centuries-old specimens.

His millennial treants remained intact under the skeleton's watch. The newly-contracted bear leader awoke despondent—bound to serve whenever summoned, unable to resist its captor.

As human and bear regarded each other in silence, a message talisman arrived from the array's perimeter:

"Trouble—someone approaches the island!"
