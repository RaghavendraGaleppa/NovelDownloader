## Chapter 62: Teasing

Sitting at his desk, Li Zhi'ming sighed, gazing out the window at the starry night sky. It had been over a year since his father last sent him a letter. He picked up his brush and began to write, carefully detailing his experiences over the past year. Once he finished, he sealed the letter and set it aside to be sent to his family the next day. The long distance made sending letters a difficult task.

As a disciple of the Qiuxian Gate, Li Zhi'ming's status allowed him to have his letters delivered along with Da Niu's. If not for his position, he wouldn't have received such treatment.

The last letter from his family mentioned that his parents were in good health. The silver he had sent had allowed them to purchase a large estate and build a new house. His father wanted to develop in the eastern countryside, but his mother was reluctant to leave their ancestral land. Li Zhi'ming chuckled to himself, shaking his head.

Farmers often felt secure with their own land, but in doing so, they might be tied down for a lifetime. What kept them from leaving their hometown to explore the vast and beautiful world?

As he put down his brush, Li Zhi'ming's gaze drifted to the stars, lost in thought.

Even the best doctors in the world were still just doctors. 

He thought about Da Niu, who had grown incredibly strong, like a robust ox. It had been a month since they last met, and Li Zhi'ming recalled how Da Niu would eat a whole bucket of food, almost depleting Li Zhi'ming's supplies. He would often go hunting to supplement his food, catching a few wild rabbits or large bamboo mice for a snack.

"Young master," a soft voice called out, and Li Zhi'ming turned to see Zhong Jun, one of the three girls who served him, entering the room with a steaming hot tub.

"Ah, Zhong Jun, wasn't it supposed to be Xi Jia today?" Li Zhi'ming asked.

"Xi Jia has stomach pains today," Zhong Jun replied with a smile.

Li Zhi'ming's concern was evident. "Is it serious?"

Zhong Jun hesitated before responding, "It might take a few days, but it's not too severe."

As Zhong Jun helped Li Zhi'ming out of his shoes and soak his feet in the hot water, he felt a deep sense of satisfaction. He had never imagined living such a life.

Zhong Jun sat beside him, chatting casually. "Young master, you've been eating less lately. You should eat more to nourish your body."

Li Zhi'ming looked up, puzzled. "I don't feel like I'm eating less. I think my appetite has increased significantly. I used to be full with one bowl of food, but now it takes four or five bowls."

Zhong Jun blushed. "You're growing, young master. You need to eat more nutritious food. I'll go catch some more bamboo mice for you tomorrow."

Li Zhi'ming chuckled, teasing her. "You're biased towards that big fellow, aren't you? You always say he eats too much."

Zhong Jun's face turned even redder. "I'll go catch some snakes to vary your diet," Li Zhi'ming said, his throat constricting slightly.

Zhong Jun's hand gently massaged his foot. "Why do you keep telling me to nourish your body? Xi Jia said the same thing. I don't understand."

Li Zhi'ming looked at Zhong Jun, inquiring, "What's Xi Jia trying to say? I've been practicing martial arts and strengthening my body."

Zhong Jun's expression turned coy. "You should ask Xi Jia yourself, young master. I don't know."

As they chatted, Li Zhi'ming became more confused. He decided to drop the subject, thinking that his master had been right – women were indeed the most difficult to understand.

The conversation had left him dizzy.

"Zhong Jun, the water has cooled down."

"Yes, young master. I'll go add more hot water."

As Zhong Jun left, Li Zhi'ming's attention turned to the "Ma Fei San" recipe his master had left him. Despite over a year of trying, he had made no progress. He had tried almost every herb he knew, but to no avail.

Was it possible that one of the ingredients simply didn't exist?

Just then, Zhong Jun returned with a new bucket of hot water. The room was filled with a warm, peaceful atmosphere. At the desk, Jiang Yun, dressed in a pale blue gown, was engrossed in a book, oblivious to the commotion behind her. Meanwhile, Xi Jia was curled up in bed, looking pitiful.

"Xi Jia, how are you feeling today?" Zhong Jun asked, concern etched on her face.

"Still sore," Xi Jia replied weakly, shooting Zhong Jun a glance. "Look at you, happy as ever. You've probably come to flirt with me again."

Zhong Jun giggled and climbed into bed beside Xi Jia, rubbing her stomach. "I'm just trying to help, sister."

Xi Jia playfully scolded her. "Why don't you go ask the young master to feel your pulse or rub your stomach?"

Zhong Jun's face turned bright red. "Shut up! You're teasing me now!"

The scene was filled with laughter and warmth, a stark contrast to Li Zhi'ming's earlier frustration with the "Ma Fei San" recipe. As he watched, he couldn't help but feel grateful for the companionship and care of those around him.
