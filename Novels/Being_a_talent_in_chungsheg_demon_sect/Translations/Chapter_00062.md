# Chapter 62: Foundation Establishment Ushers in Calamity, Winds and Clouds Stir in a Single Thought

“Given my current strength, killing that little devil will likely not be easy.”

Old Ancestor Yun's face showed deep contemplation. After all, he had only just reincarnated into an infant's body, possessing nothing but a powerful soul and divination abilities, with no combat strength.

“...But it’s fine.”

Old Ancestor Yun was not in a hurry. Lu Yang couldn't possibly detect him, so he could develop slowly, recovering to the Great Perfection stage of Qi Refinement within ten years.

“However, that boy is elusive and currently in charge of this Law Refinement Secret Realm. Once he senses danger, he can withdraw from the Secret Realm at any time. Even if I recover to the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement, I will still need a careful plan to lure him into a trap and prevent his escape if I wish to kill him.”

Old Ancestor Yun continued to divine while pondering.

“The Three Steps of Martial Arts: mastering the five elements within the body, opening the nine Heavenly Apertures, and breaking through the Grand Dao Profound Pass. A master of this art can rival a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. What a marvelous technique.”

Old Ancestor Yun's face filled with admiration.

He had achieved Foundation Establishment twice and lived for over six hundred years, encountering countless demonic cultivators. Some had cultivated the Sage's Plunder, yet few were like Lu Yang.

“Without reaching Foundation Establishment, one cannot comprehend destiny. Divination and deduction abilities are far from sufficient to create a profound cultivation method. Even if one were to勉强 (reluctantly/barely) create one, it would be like mud huts and clay tiles, crumbling at a touch. A master who can rival a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator is already considered formidable, and one who can cultivate to the late-stage Qi Refinement is virtually perfect.”

“Does that devil possess such talent?”

While Old Ancestor Yun marveled, his apprehension deepened. He was now determined not to let Lu Yang break through to Foundation Establishment, which would only increase the strength of the demonic path.

But how to do it?

“The Sage's Plunder steals the world's fortune and consumes merit. One who masters it is bound to face a calamity… This suggests that my reincarnation this time is likely his calamity.”

Old Ancestor Yun discerned the heavenly mysteries, and an understanding dawned upon him:

“However, I am protected by the Heaven-Scrying Instrument, so he cannot divine my existence, yet I can easily grasp his whereabouts. This should be a significant advantage.”

“Since that's the case, I can create a ‘calamity’ for him. This ‘calamity’ must not be too easy to resolve, nor too difficult. It must make him see hope of a solution, so he will personally act. I will use this ‘calamity’ to lure him into my trap…”

As the saying goes, even a lion uses its full strength when hunting a rabbit.

Old Ancestor Yun had already reincarnated once before, so he did not act with the arrogance of a Foundation Establishment cultivator. He would not underestimate Lu Yang, planning his scheme with utmost seriousness.

“So, what will this ‘calamity’ be?”

Old Ancestor Yun pondered for a moment, then smiled faintly, having made up his mind: “For this child, the greatest concern is undoubtedly the cultivation of the Sage's Plunder going awry.”

“In that case, I shall lend him a hand!”

“He created the Three Steps of Martial Arts; I will create a Fourth Step of Martial Arts for him. However, this step will no longer be confined to the framework of the system he created…”

With this thought, Old Ancestor Yun immediately began to manipulate karma.

In the blink of an eye, ten years passed.

During these ten years, heroes emerged across the land. The development of martial arts reached its peak, and the Three Steps of Martial Arts became widely known and practiced by all.

And it was in this era of martial reverence that one night, in Heavenly Capital City, thunder suddenly roared, dragons and serpents seemed to stir from the earth, and torrential rain poured down. Soon after, the city's inhabitants witnessed a magnificent pillar of Qi soaring into the sky, piercing through the rain clouds and reversing the celestial phenomenon. In less than an hour and three-quarters, the clouds unexpectedly parted, revealing the sun!

The next day, news spread like wildfire throughout the world.

The master of the Vast Righteousness Academy, ‘Sage-Heart Scholar’ Wang Boyuan, who possessed a Heavenly Scroll, achieved enlightenment overnight, comprehending profound mysteries, and actually created the Fourth Step of Martial Arts!

The First Step of Martial Arts: Mastering the Five Elements within the body.
The five organs—heart, lungs, spleen, liver, and kidneys—when perfectly attuned, constituted a Martial Artist.

The Second Step of Martial Arts: Opening the Nine Heavenly Apertures.
The nine apertures—eyes, ears, nose, tongue, tendons, bones, flesh, blood, and intent—when fully open, one could be called a Martial Master.

The Third Step of Martial Arts: Breaking Through the Grand Dao Profound Pass.
Three feet above one's head resides a divine presence. One uses the five organs to refine the body's essence-qi, and the nine apertures to draw upon the power of heaven and earth. When inner and outer combine, one breaks through the profound pass atop the head, becoming able to perceive the ‘divine presence’.

The world believed that martial arts ended here, that one who reached this stage was a grandmaster with no further path of advancement.

However, with ‘Sage-Heart Scholar’ Wang Boyuan’s breakthrough, all martial artists across the land were greatly invigorated. Wang Boyuan, with a noble heart, did not keep his insights to himself.

“The Fourth Step of Martial Arts is named ‘Scrutiny of the Heaven-Man Transformation’!”

“To achieve this method, one must break free from the shackles of martial arts, no longer confined to martial arts itself, but instead forge one’s own path, thereby achieving the transformation of heaven and man!”

The Sage-Heart Scholar comprehended this point. No longer confined by martial arts, he created the “Fortune-Gazing Art,” capable of knowing heavenly destiny, observing heavenly fortune, and even altering heavenly mysteries. This was because his heart was entirely devoted to his nation, wishing to use the art of fortune-gazing to prolong the Great Zhou Dynasty’s national fortune, establish an iron-clad dominion, and usher in an era of lasting peace.

As the Sage-Heart Scholar achieved his breakthrough, karmic changes rippled, and the world underwent a dramatic transformation.

The second to break through was the contemporary itinerant monk of the Dragon Tiger Mountain Celestial Master's Mansion, ‘Barefoot Daoist’ Chang Qingjing, who achieved enlightenment and broke through during a medical practice.

The third was the Hanging Temple’s ‘Calamity-Averting Divine Monk’ Xuanku, who achieved enlightenment and broke through during a morning cultivation session.

The fourth… the fifth… the sixth…

In just ten short years, seven Martial Dao Heaven-Men appeared across the land, proving the feasibility of this path and completely shattering the martial arts framework Lu Yang had initially established!

“Hmm?”

In the westernmost part of the Law Refinement Secret Realm, deep within layers of mountains, surrounded by countless talismans within the Blood-Washing Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram, Lu Yang suddenly opened his eyes.

All he saw were dark clouds, no clear sky or bright sun.

The next second, a bright halo radiated from behind Lu Yang’s head, and the Grand Subtle Treasure Talisman began to operate. All the changes of the past ten years immediately surfaced in his mind, fully comprehended by him.

“The Fourth Step of Martial Arts, Scrutiny of the Heaven-Man Transformation… so fast!”

At this moment, Lu Yang was both surprised and perplexed. He was pleased that martial arts had undergone such a transformation in such a short time, yet that was also the source of his doubt.

How could it be so fast?

However, the cause and effect deduced were seamlessly perfect, without a single flaw.

“The martial arts I created, reaching the third step, could rival a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. Now, the people in the Secret Realm have developed a fourth step. Roughly estimated, these so-called Martial Dao Heaven-Men are probably quite powerful, possibly comparable to the Great Perfection of Qi Refinement… But if so, it’s no longer just martial arts!”

At this thought, Lu Yang’s expression gradually turned serious.

The divined events were not problematic…
The karmic shifts were not problematic either…
Everything was logical and reasonable, except for one problem: martial arts was out of control, and the Sage's Plunder was about to fail. Only by him personally acting could it be corrected.

“…This isn’t right!”

An alarm instantly blared in Lu Yang's mind. He naturally could not perceive Old Ancestor Yun's scheme, nor could he sense Old Ancestor Yun's actions in manipulating karma.

He knew only one thing:

“No one is going to make me leave this place!”

Here, he had countless talismans at his disposal, as well as array formations for protection. Even if a dozen Great Perfection Qi Refinement cultivators came, he would not fear them; he was as stable as a fisherman on a platform.

But once he left this place, it would be a different story.

Moreover, he was currently the chess player, detached from worldly affairs. If he chose to enter the world and become widely known, it would be tantamount to stepping onto the chessboard as a piece himself.

One misstep, and he could lose the entire game.

At this thought, Lu Yang immediately calmed down. Although the emergence of the Martial Dao Heaven-Men could disrupt his Sage's Plunder, it would still take some time.

“First, I’ll send a clone to scout ahead…”

With a thought, the Myriad Spirit Banner appeared in his palm. Then, a wisp of pure white *Qi* emerged from his fingertip, a pure "Innate Primordial Qi."

This was what he had condensed after refining himself in his second life.

Once, this Innate Primordial Qi had extraordinary effects, even helping him break through to the mid-stage Qi Refinement in his third life. Unfortunately, in subsequent lives, it gradually became useless.

“Now is the perfect time to put it to good use…”
