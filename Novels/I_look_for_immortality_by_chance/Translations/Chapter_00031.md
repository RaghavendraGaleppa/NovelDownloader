# Chapter 31: Blood Rain and Sudden Change  

"Two hundred and sixty spirit stones!"  

As soon as Lan Tianlu made his bid, someone in the crowd immediately countered.  

Though the price was steep, it was still within the means of disciples from prominent families—after all, high-grade spiritual water was a rare find.  

Hearing the escalating bids, Lan Tianlu's resentment deepened.  

He didn’t need to guess to know that the spiritual water on the auction block must have come from Gu Yuan.  

That lucky upstart must have uncovered the secret of the Four Spirit Jade Pillars, allowing him to sell Qinghe Spiritual Water and cultivate even more potent Spirit Dragon Heavenly Water.  

The thought of it drove him mad with fury.  

All of this should have been his fortune!  

It was all because of that damned impostor, pretending to be a disciple of a Golden Core elder and using his false status to steal Lan Tianlu’s rightful opportunity!  

"But now, that bastard has probably already consumed the spiritual water and broken through to the fifth level of Qi Refinement. If I confront him now, I might not have the upper hand."  

"And it’s all because of that wretched woman! She dismissed me with just a portion of Silverfish Spiritual Water and a mid-grade magical artifact, refusing to let me see my uncle!"  

"Thankfully, I found another opportunity in the White Worm Frost Prison. As long as I can obtain the Qinghe Spiritual Water and reach the fifth level of Qi Refinement, I can catch up to that despicable scoundrel!"  

"Though he’s cunning, he must have already hidden the Four Spirit Jade Pillars in his storage pouch. If I can find the right moment to kill him, everything will return to how it should be!"  

"The opportunity will still be mine!"  

Lan Tianlu touched his spirit beast pouch, feeling the cold, shimmering dots within, his heart brimming with murderous intent.  

"Two hundred and seventy spirit stones!"  

"Two hundred and seventy spirit stones!"  

"Any higher bids?"  

Just then, the auctioneer’s voice snapped him back to reality.  

He hastily raised his hand and shouted, "Two hundred and eighty!"  

"Two hundred and eighty! Any more?"  

"Two hundred and ninety!" Lan Tianlu countered.  

"Two hundred and ninety-five!"  

The bidding gradually slowed.  

"Three hundred!" Lan Tianlu growled.  

Finally, no one countered.  

Three hundred spirit stones were already far above market value. Even disciples from wealthy families were unwilling to go higher—high-grade spiritual water, though rare, could still be found elsewhere. No one was willing to bankrupt themselves for it.  

"Three hundred spirit stones!"  

"Sold!"  

With the strike of the gavel, Lan Tianlu finally secured the spiritual water he coveted. A smirk tugged at his lips.  

But in the next instant, a dark thought crossed his mind, and his expression twisted with fury.  

Damn it all!  

He had just handed another three hundred spirit stones to that bastard Gu Yuan!  

---  

Gu Yuan couldn’t stop smiling.  

His face was practically glowing with satisfaction.  

Three hundred spirit stones—a fortune!  

Even after repaying the hundred or so he had borrowed and splitting the profits with the other two, Gu Yuan would still walk away with a hundred and forty.  

Combined with the income from his Silverfish cultivation, this would be more than enough to refine two magical seals.  

In high spirits, even the auction house seemed more pleasant to him.  

The auction continued.  

"The final item of today’s event—a top-grade magical artifact, the Kongyue Seal! This artifact was forged by refining the foundation of a small mountain, weighing a staggering 188,880 jin, and engraved with thirty-six artifact runes. Its power is immense—a single strike can injure even an eighth-level Qi Refinement cultivator!"  

"Starting bid: two hundred spirit stones!"  

The gavel struck, and the crowd erupted with excitement.  

Though Qi Refinement was divided into nine levels, they all fell under the same major realm. The difference in strength wasn’t insurmountable—with a powerful enough artifact, it was possible to challenge those above one’s level.  

Magical artifacts in the Qi Refinement stage were categorized into three tiers:  

Low-grade artifacts were typically used by those below the fifth level of Qi Refinement. They were weak and slow.  

Mid-grade artifacts could be controlled with spiritual sense, offering greater power, and were usually wielded by those above the fifth level.  

High-grade artifacts were reserved for those at the seventh level or higher, or for wealthier disciples above the fifth level.  

Top-grade artifacts were the pinnacle of Qi Refinement treasures, capable of turning the tide in battle if used well—but their prices were exorbitant, far beyond what most could afford.  

Though Gu Yuan coveted the seal, a quick check of his funds forced him to abandon the thought.  

"Four hundred and eighty spirit stones—sold!"  

After fierce bidding, the artifact was finally claimed for four hundred and eighty spirit stones, concluding the auction.  

Once the event ended, Gu Yuan collected his earnings and took a final stroll through the Tianxing Black Market.  

The auction had featured only the most sought-after items, but many materials were still available through private sellers.  

After browsing for a while, Gu Yuan spent nearly fifty spirit stones, acquiring nearly all the materials needed for his two magical seals—except for the five-hundred-year-old shell of a Green Tortoise.  

Disappointed but undeterred, he decided to inquire at the Alchemy Hall or the Heavenly Crafts Pavilion.  

These institutions regularly collected and transported vast quantities of materials for the sect’s use, and they sometimes sold excess stock to disciples.  

Gu Yuan would try his luck there.  

With his plans set, he saw no reason to linger in the black market. With a thought, he returned to Silvermoon Bay.  

---  

Eager to begin refining his seals, Gu Yuan wasted no time. As soon as he left the black market, he summoned his Cloud-Treading Shuttle and set off for the Alchemy Hall.  

But just then, the sky outside the market suddenly darkened.  

Completely.  

The sun seemed to have been swallowed by a terrifying shadow, leaving not a single ray of light.  

The Qingfeng Dao Academy was protected by a grand formation that maintained perpetual spring and ample sunlight. Even on the cloudiest days, the formation would simulate the sun’s radiance.  

Yet now, the entire formation seemed to tremble in fear, not daring to emit even a glimmer of light.  

What was happening?  

"Could someone be attacking the academy?!"  

Panic spread through the market, and someone voiced the very thought in Gu Yuan’s mind.  

"Impossible! Who would dare assault the academy? The Heavenly Palace’s laws are no joke!"  

The idea was immediately dismissed.  

This wasn’t a lawless world where the strong preyed on the weak without consequence.  

For tens of thousands of years, the Heavenly Palace and the True Dragons had enforced order. Large-scale conflicts had become exceedingly rare.  

No one dared to recklessly attack a Dao Academy.  

But just then, a drop of liquid fell onto Gu Yuan’s face.  

Even with his protective spiritual energy, he couldn’t repel it.  

Startled, he reached up to touch it—only to find his fingers stained with damp, crimson liquid.  

Blood.  

Drops of scarlet rain fell from the heavens, splattering onto the earth.  

A blood rain!  

"BOOM—!"  

At the same time, a deafening peal of thunder resounded across the heavens and the earth, shaking the skies and the seas. Every living being in the land could hear its mournful roar.  

The thunder carried an unmistakable lament—as if grieving the death of something unfathomable.  

An inexplicable sorrow welled up in Gu Yuan’s heart.  

"Wuuu—"  

"Wuuu—"  

Suddenly, mournful cries rose from Qingfeng Mountain, the Spirit Beast Pavilion, the Nine Rivers Great Marsh… The wails of countless beasts, filled with grief, echoed through the land.  

"This… this is… the True Dragon… the True Dragon has fallen?"  

A trembling voice in the market spoke, barely audible.  

The sun dimmed. The heavens wept blood. Thunder rumbled like mountains. All living things mourned.  

The True Dragon was dead.  

On this day, every being capable of sensing the Heavenly Palace looked toward that eternally radiant palace, standing tall for countless millennia.  

If the True Dragon had perished… what of the True Immortal?  

Countless ambitions stirred in the shadows.  

The world was on the brink of change.
