# Chapter 168: Seeking Yin and Yang, The Flower Cage Emerges

All things are divided into Yin and Yang, and Yang gives birth to all things.

"Tracing back to Yin and Yang is tracing back to the origin. Although this characteristic does not strengthen my physique, it allows me to see things and affairs more thoroughly.配合 with the pupils of my eyes, I can peer into their origin. When fighting with others, I can see through my opponent's flaws at a glance; that is not impossible."

Li Xian had an epiphany. He held his palm up to the sky and felt a heat current rushing through it. His physique had transformed, and his internal Qi had condensed.

[Mastery: 1659/2000 Small Success]

After the last wisp of Heaven and Earth's essence was digested and absorbed into his body, Li Xian gradually got back on track.

"Every time I now consume a Spirit Treasure, I can retain six to seven wisps of Heaven and Earth's essence. The progress is obvious, and my digestion speed is faster."

"Maintain the momentum and practice slowly."

For several consecutive days, he practiced quietly. Li Xian consumed Spirit Treasures and practiced martial arts, making progress every day. [Iron Copper Body] was also nearing its peak.

The days were peaceful but not boring. In the earlier period, Li Xian managed the Martial Commander Hall, which inevitably diverted his energy and led to neglecting the affairs of the One Union Manor. With the matter of the Cao family temporarily resolved, Li Xian, in his spare time from training, enthusiastically guided the guards in their martial arts.

He had grasped the essence of basic martial arts. Although he didn't understand every basic martial art completely, guiding the manor's guards was no problem at all.

Those with good aptitude, after his guidance, made obvious progress, as if enlightened, taking several steps forward in a single day. Those with dull aptitude also suddenly saw the light. They admired Li Xian immensely.

Only then did they realize the gap between them.

Red flowers bloomed in the manor, their fragrance overflowing, attracting bees and butterflies. In the ninth month, the wind was warm and the air cool, offering a unique charm.

In his leisure time, he enjoyed the flowers and strolled in the garden.

However, Luo Fang, the steward of the servant quarters, was having a hard time. He was fearful every day, worried that Li Xian would take revenge. He cursed Bi Hao for being a white-eyed wolf. The two uncles and nephews fought each other; in the most serious incident, Bi Hao bit off one of Luo Fang's ears.

In his spare time, Li Xian spent time rectifying the manor's atmosphere. The focus was on the servant quarters. Luo Fang, used to skimming off the top, had grown a face full of fat, while the servants below were in terrible shape, living miserably.

After this rectification, Luo Fang lost two layers of skin. He was dragged to the torture room and beaten several times. He was stripped of his steward position and demoted to the servant quarters to work as a servant.

This was making him reap what he sowed.

Bi Hao, thinking he had won Li Xian's favor, wanted to take over the steward position. But Li Xian ignored him, knowing that Bi Hao and Luo Fang were actually the same kind of person. After careful consideration, he chose another person from the guards to act as the steward of the servant quarters.

That person was Zhao Han. He had some friendship with Li Xian in the past. When Li Xian first became a guard, this person had helped him quite a bit; his heart was not bad. But this appointment was not an intentional favor; Li Xian was practical and truly believed Zhao Han was capable.

In this way, the atmosphere of the One Union Manor changed greatly, and efficiency soared. The Madam had her eyes and ears everywhere; she saw everything clearly and a smile touched her lips.

On the sixth day of the ninth month, Li Xian returned to Qingning and went to the Martial Commander Hall first. The thirty servants who were originally injured had all recovered and were out of bed practicing martial arts.

Luo Xia sat in the Martial Commander Hall, exuding quite an air of authority. The various officers called her "Big Sister," and they got along well.

"How is it? Did you serve your Madam well?" Luo Xia teased.

Li Xian's face darkened. "I stand tall and straight; what nonsense are you talking about?"

Luo Xia smiled without speaking. They chatted for a while, discussing the situation in the city. The Three Halls and Two Sects were all behaving themselves.

Everyone was here. While Li Xian was striving forward, he should also take a break. The guys had suffered torture but remained loyal, which moved him. So he decided to hold a "Martial Commander Banquet."

Tables and chairs were set up in the hall.

Luo Xia took several dozen taels of silver to buy meat and vegetables and hire a chef. The cost of living in Qingning was low; a few taels of silver were enough. Li Xian gave ten times that amount, just so the brothers could eat something truly good.

Ordinary food was not enough to liven things up. Li Xian personally went up the mountain and hunted a strange tiger, carrying it back to the Martial Commander Hall on his shoulder.

Other dishes were handed over to the chef to prepare. But killing the tiger and making the soup was something only Li Xian could do himself. In ancient times, there was the cook Ding who carved cattle; today, there is Li Xian who dissects tigers.

His physique had been built by eating tigers. Skinning and removing the organs, the tiger's bones were tough and heavy; an ordinary butcher knife couldn't cut through them, requiring a blunt instrument to smash them.

He poured out the tiger marrow to make soup.

Li Xian had a sudden idea to start a new stove and cook a Dragon and Tiger Soup. He had the tiger meat, but he lacked dragon meat. Dragons were creatures of Heaven and Earth's fortune and were extremely rare. Li Xian didn't even know if they existed.

He settled for the next best thing and used a venomous snake as a substitute. Li Xian ordered a servant, Liu Fang, to catch a few wild venomous snakes and pick a few large lotus leaves.

Liu Fang was originally a snake catcher. He was an expert at catching snakes and immediately ran into the mountains. He caught "Five-Step Snake," "Red Auspicious Snake," "Rotting Heart Snake," and other venomous snakes.

Li Xian pulled out the fangs and chopped off the snake heads. After finishing the preparation, he first marinated them with cooking wine, then threw them into the tiger soup. He chopped the lotus leaves into pieces and added ingredients like garlic and scallions.

Cooked over a large fire.

The tiger meat was tough; it needed three hours over a large fire before it was barely edible. Li Xian felt waiting was too slow, so he rode back to the One Union Manor and took some fragments of "Dragon Roar Charcoal."

He threw them into the fire. The flames surged, and in just half an hour, a pot of "Dragon and Tiger Essence Qi Soup" was ready. Everyone got a bowl of soup and a palm-sized piece of tiger meat.

They ate it with the other dishes. Drinking strong alcohol and enjoying the delicious food, it was extremely satisfying.

Luo Xia said, "You're quite something. The Cao family suffered such a great loss, yet they aren't pursuing it aggressively."

Li Xian said, "If you throw one punch, you can avoid a hundred more."

[You drank Dragon and Tiger Soup, Skill: Ingestion, Mastery +7]

Li Xian gulped down the soup. The surface of the soup was covered in oil, but the lotus leaves added a touch, making it sweet and refreshing. The taste was pretty good, and his cooking had improved. He said:

"The Cao family is powerful; this matter is only temporarily resolved. Only by improving my own strength can I deal with various dangerous situations."

After eating his fill, Li Xian entered the inner courtyard to practice martial arts. [Iron Copper Body] was nearing its peak, and the Waning Sun Fading Blood Sword was improving day by day.

"The Waning Sun Fading Blood Sword is powerful, but it consumes too much internal Qi. When fighting an enemy, unless it's a life-and-death struggle, I won't use this sword. Given my current situation, it's best..."

"To find a way to get a lower-tier or middle-tier martial art... In this way, I would have basic skills to rely on, as well as a trump card and a hidden ultimate technique. Facing any situation, I could respond according to the circumstances."

"But I still owe the Madam three thousand taels. Where am I going to get this money? Although the Three Halls and Two Sects have money, if I openly rob them, they will definitely resist. There is no reason in this world to take a beating without fighting back."

"One month's time... First, I'll urge the Prefecture City to quickly release the bounty. The other silver needs to be found another way!"

Li Xian calmed his breath. He hammered his chest with his palm, and his body trembled. The mastery of Iron Copper Body accumulated "three" points. He repeated this over and over...

Mastery +3
Mastery +2

Suddenly, he heard a commotion outside. Zhang Hou came back to report: "Martial Commander, there is a guest outside."

Li Xian immediately went out and saw a valiant and charming woman with a slight sheen of sweat on her forehead.

Li Xian cupped his fists and said, "Sister Lin, long time no see!"

This woman was none other than the穷天 Lin family, currently a Xuan Hou of the巡天司, Lin Aoshan. She had disappeared without a word for several days. Now that all matters were settled, she had appeared again.

Lin Aoshan gently sniffed and said, "It smells so good. What soup is this?"

Li Xian said, "This is Dragon and Tiger Soup that I cooked myself. Would you like to try some, Sister Lin?"

"Dragon and Tiger Soup?" Lin Aoshan said, "Did you use Dragon Roar Charcoal to cook it? Why do I smell the scent of Dragon Roar Charcoal?"

Li Xian admitted with a smile, thinking to himself that Lin Aoshan was knowledgeable and extremely impressive.

Lin Aoshan said, "I've been traveling hard and am exhausted. Give me a bowl to taste?"

Without waiting for a reply, she had already scooped up the soup and taken several big gulps. It was clear she was extremely thirsty. With a few glugs, she finished the bowl. Li Xian introduced her to everyone, and Luo Xia and Lin Aoshan greeted each other.

Having quenched her thirst, Lin Aoshan said, "Li Xian, you're quite capable. On the way here, I heard that you even dared to kill a county magistrate."

"Is Sister Lin here from the巡天司 to punish me for my crime?" Li Xian asked.

"Hmm..." Lin Aoshan said, "Your behavior could be called treason. But in remote places, sometimes it's just a matter of words."

"The situation in the Prefecture City is complex, and the Cao family isn't the only one in power."

"The Cao family can't swallow this, so naturally someone else will. Don't worry, I guess the next county magistrate won't be from the Cao family. I'm afraid they will be extremely respectful and try their best to please you, just to secure their position."

Li Xian said, "I didn't oppose the Cao family. It was the Cao family, relying on their power, that oppressed me. I had no choice but to fight back. If they don't give up, that's fine. I'll accompany them."

"Good spirit!" Lin Aoshan's eyes flashed. "Actually, speaking of which, the reason the situation has evolved to this point is entirely because the Cao family thought you were a member of the Lin family. That's why they wanted to eliminate you."

Li Xian said, "This matter is over. I can't be bothered to deal with the entanglements within it. But there is one thing I need your help with, Sister Lin. I have a few Red List criminal corpses here that I haven't reported to the巡天司 yet."

"Can I hand them over to you to report directly? That way, we can avoid the layers of embezzlement and I can get a larger bounty?"

"Oh?" Lin Aoshan was stunned, then she was overjoyed. Thinking of something, she smiled and said, "Of course. Absolutely. Not only that, but I can also pay you the bounty in advance."

"Really?" Li Xian was delighted.

"You're following the折剑夫人, right? Why are you so short of money?" Lin Aoshan turned and asked, "As far as I know, your Madam is extremely wealthy. She has many industries in the Prefecture City, and her silk fabrics are very popular."

"That's the Madam's money," Li Xian said frankly. "To be honest, I still owe the Madam three thousand taels."

"Ah!" Lin Aoshan pretended to be surprised, holding her chin, tapping her foot on the ground, and pondering. "Three thousand taels... that's not a small sum. Even for a martial artist, it's enough to last a good while. What do you plan to do?"

Li Xian said, "I'll do my best to repay it. I don't want to think too much about it."

Lin Aoshan's eyes darted around. She said, "I can help you, actually. Speaking of which... aren't you curious where I've been lately?"

"Not curious," Li Xian said with a smile.

"Even if you're not curious, I'll tell you," Lin Aoshan rolled her eyes. She sat down at the table and had Zhang Hou ladle her another bowl of tiger soup. She had been traveling hard; the back of her clothes was soaked with sweat, and she had a bit of a sweaty scent mixed with the fragrance of her hair, but it wasn't unpleasant.

She said, "A few days ago, the Flower Cage Sect gathered in 'Huaiyin Prefecture.' I don't know what they were plotting. This sect belongs to the evil faction. They have offended countless forces in the martial world and are afraid that the world isn't chaotic enough. It was rare for them to gather in such numbers. The巡天司 got the news and decided to surround and exterminate them."

"But the Flower Cage Sect got the news and immediately scattered in all directions."

"As a Xuan Hou, although Qingning County is far from Huaiyin Prefecture, it happens to be to its northwest. If I went to block them, I could intercept one route and was sure to kill many Flower Cage Sect disciples."

"So I lay in wait in the 'Glazed Mountain' area to intercept and kill Flower Cage Sect disciples."

"However, the Flower Cage Sect had excellent intelligence and actually took a detour to escape. This left me lying in ambush for over ten days with empty hands, making me look quite pathetic."

Li Xian thought to himself: "So that's how it is. This巡天司 runs all over the place; it's quite辛苦 (hard work)."

Lin Aoshan rubbed her legs and said, "But Heaven doesn't fail those with a heart. On my way back, I discovered a group of Flower Cage Sect members had actually fled to the vicinity."

"The situation is urgent, and the Flower Cage Sect is the most cunning. Although I am strong, I really don't dare to face the Flower Cage Sect alone. If I were to draw personnel from elsewhere, it would inevitably alert them, and in the end, it would be another empty haul. If you help me, I'll handle the three thousand taels of silver for you."

"What do you say?"
