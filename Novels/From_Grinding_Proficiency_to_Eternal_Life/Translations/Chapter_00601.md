# Chapter 601: The Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations

This would completely shatter the delicate balance that had been maintained among the Three Sects for thousands of years. How could the Primordial Origin Sect and the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect tolerate such a powerful neighbor sleeping right beside them?

When that time comes, there will be no talk of minor frictions; they would unhesitatingly ignite a new great war among the Three Sects.

Although the World-Honored One Tathagata of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land is a formidable figure, the Dao Lords of the Primordial Origin Sect and the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect will not allow him to freely fish in their waters.

After digesting Sun Wukong's memories—or rather, after merely picking and choosing some of the Monkey King's combat experience and staff techniques—Xu Yunfan hadn't even looked at the *Great Virtuous Bright King Battle Tathagata Sutra*.

This scripture was a scalding hot potato.

The Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land would definitely orchestrate a major event to keep the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect and the Primordial Origin Sect preoccupied, allowing the World-Honored One to successfully attain the position of King Buddha and establish a Terrestrial Buddha Kingdom on earth.

The World-Honored One Tathagata of the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land might even enlighten another to descend and stir the waters. If they truly manage to establish a Terrestrial Buddha Kingdom in the Eastern Wasteland and attain the position of the Self-Ruler King Buddha, the days of the Primordial Origin Sect and the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect would become even more difficult.

As a cultivator of the Primordial Origin Sect, especially one who has caught the eye of the True Lord Qingyuan, Xu Yunfan's situation would likely become increasingly precarious.

The Primordial Origin Sect and the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect would absolutely refuse to allow this.

Even the Dao Lords behind them would likely not let the World-Honored One Tathagata have his way.

He needed to improve his strength quickly.

Xu Yunfan was well aware that to find a sliver of life in the center of this impending storm, or even to seize opportunities, his current Foundation Establishment late-stage cultivation was still insufficient.

He had to condense his own Immortal Gold Nature as soon as possible and achieve the realm of a Great True Person at the peak of Foundation Establishment. Only then would he have more confidence to deal with the changing situation.

In the chaos of a three-way battle, he might even be able to keep those Golden Core True Lords preoccupied, allowing him to seek the Golden Core and prove the Dao.

Now that the *Nine Heavens of the Celestial Thunder Void Undying True Sutra* was complete, and the *Nine Heavens of the Celestial Thunder Jade Clarity Void Transformation Undying Dao Fruit* was within reach, as long as he condensed his Immortal Gold Nature, this method would surely break through its limits, allowing him to接引 (receive) the favor of the Dao Fruit.

Achieving the status of a True Lord would be a natural consequence; why would he need the ritual of subduing demons and evil?

But some things still needed to be done.

Otherwise, how could he hide his true intentions?

Opportunities are fleeting; every second counts.

Xu Yunfan dared not delay and immediately set off for the Primordial Origin Sect's Scripture Pavilion.

Relying on the identity token bestowed by the True Lord Qingyuan and the merit he had accumulated, he quickly exchanged it for the complete jade slip of the *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations*.

This peerless killing array, originating from the ancient Celestial Court, was vast, complex, and infinitely powerful. Even comprehending a fraction of it would yield immense benefits.

The array was divided into nine grades, with nine being the ultimate and highest grade.

If paired with a Numinous Treasure, this array could be considered an eight-grade formation. Currently, he only planned to inscribe it into the Star Spirit Banner, making it a seven-grade array.

But for Xu Yunfan, this was sufficient.

The merit points required for the exchange were naturally astronomical, but Xu Yunfan could still afford it at the moment.

He could not only afford it but even had some savings left.

With his Attribute Panel, his attainments in the Dao of Arrays had long since pushed the *General Understanding of Arrays* to the Great Completion realm, laying an incredibly solid foundation.

Now, as he contemplated this higher-level *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations*, although he found it profoundly complex, with the powerful deduction and analysis capabilities of the Attribute Panel, many originally obscure and difficult points gradually became clear, like unraveling a cocoon.

His proficiency skill points also jumped in his vision from time to time.

In the following days, Xu Yunfan immersed himself in it, forgetting to eat or sleep, combining his own understanding of the Dao of Arrays to continuously deduce and improve.

Once he fully comprehended this array, his cultivation in the Dao of Arrays would surely reach a new, even more astonishing level.

While contemplating the array, Xu Yunfan immediately set about another important task: re-refining the Zodiac Star Spirit Banner to complete the array.

This banner had once helped him hunt Foundation Establishment cultivators in the Heavenly Realm to fill the positions of Star Lords. It was the actual carrier of the *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations* and the prototype for his future Numinous Treasure.

He naturally needed to use the *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations* as a blueprint, combined with the exquisite "Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Array" method from his *Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Chest*, to completely reshape and complete this Star Spirit Banner.

At this moment, his cultivation of the *Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Creation Cloud Chest* was nearing perfection. In the path of artifact refining, it was no exaggeration to call himself a master refiner.

The transformation, fusion, and manifestation of the eight mysterious cloud energies had reached a point where they were almost at his whim and naturally integrated.

Xu Yunfan did not hesitate and immediately opened his furnace, activating the Eight Sceneries Cloud Energy to perform the Eight Gates and Eight Sceneries artifact refinement.

After all, while refining the artifact and inscribing the *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations* onto the banner, it was also a great opportunity to comprehend the array.

Several hand seals fell, and the Eight Sceneries Cloud Energy, vast and mighty, enveloped the main body of the Star Spirit Banner with the aura capable of refining all things.

Xu Yunfan's spiritual sense was like an extension of his arm, guiding the Eight Sceneries Cloud Energy with pinpoint precision into every minute structure of the banner. He simulated the trajectories of the Zodiac Constellations, branding and reconstructing the profound principles of the array he had comprehended, then reinforcing and optimizing them.

At the same time, he continuously投入 (threw in) the rare heavenly materials and treasures he had obtained from the Heavenly Realm, as well as the assets from old man Chu Chengnan.

It cost him more than half of his fortune, making Xu Yunfan's heart ache so much that he grimaced.

The originally somewhat chaotic Star Lord imprints on the banner surface gradually returned to their proper places under the refinement of the Eight Sceneries Refining Heaven Array, emitting wisps of starlight. Even the heavens above seemed to respond, as billions of stars slowly shed threads of starlight into his cave dwelling, falling upon the banner's surface.

The connection between them became even more profound and mysterious. The aura of the entire banner grew deeper and more vast, faintly possessing the phenomenon of forming its own cosmos and evolving stars.

This re-refining made the foundation of the Star Spirit Banner incredibly solid, enough to bear the full might of the *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations* in the future.

Forty-nine days passed, and the re-refining of the Star Spirit Banner was complete.

A breakthrough had also been made in the *Great Array of the Zodiac Constellations*. The next step was simply to comprehend the array and continuously complete it within the banner.

Once the array took shape within the Star Spirit Banner, he could confidently say that with this banner alone, he would be invincible below the Golden Core realm.

Despite the Attribute Panel, comprehending an array was not something that could be done in a single day.

Having made a start, Xu Yunfan naturally needed to spend more time on it.

After completing these two major tasks that laid the foundation for his future, Xu Yunfan did not immediately go to find Lu Chuan.

Lu Chuan had previously sent a voice transmission, asking Xu Yunfan to seek him out after exiting seclusion. However, there was a more urgent matter that concerned his current combat strength and trump cards that needed to be prioritized.

He suppressed the urge to communicate immediately and instead devoted himself to consuming vast amounts of rare resources to begin refining a magical treasure.

He took out the Yin Mystery Mirror he had obtained from the Heavenly Realm, which contained the core of the Yin Mystery Mirror Dao Fruit.

The treasure mirror was cold and profound, radiating a vast and icy aura. It was the Numinous Treasure embryo that had materialized from the final manifestation of a Dao Fruit.

To directly refine this treasure would be like cutting off his own path to the future.

Xu Yunfan's heart was as clear as a mirror. Unless he was content to stop at the Golden Core, and even then, it would be an external Golden Core.

Furthermore, refining it as the core of his own Dao Fruit would be equivalent to severing his connection to the great path of the Taihua Spirit Void Realm. It would also immediately attract the covetous attention of True Lords.

More importantly, it would likely lead to a joint hunt by the Universal Salvation True Lord and the True Lord Qingyuan.
