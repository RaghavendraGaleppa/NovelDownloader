# Chapter 690: There Are Truly Many Old Cunning Ones

Upon hearing this, the Platinum Glaze Avatar of True Monarch Tianguang trembled slightly.

The solidified Profound Light Crystal Domain rippled almost imperceptibly.

Although True Monarch Tianguang had long been at odds with Chiyang, they were both True Monarchs of the Wansheng Sword Sect. Xu Yunfan's actions were no different from publicly flogging a corpse—it was a naked humiliation and provocation.

However, considering the turmoil within the sect caused by Chiyang's death and Tongxuan's severe injuries, and the fact that Puchan Pure Land was eyeing them covetously, engaging Xu Yunfan in a life-and-death battle now would only let the bald donkeys reap the benefits.

As for Lu Chunyang, the nominal sect master of the Wansheng Sword Sect and a top powerhouse at the mid Nascent Soul stage, he would not care in the slightest about the dirty dealings between the various families within the sect.

From a certain perspective, the death of people like True Monarch Chiyang and True Monarch Tongxuan was actually a good thing for him.

Only then could he truly take control of the Wansheng Sword Sect.

True Monarch Tianguang's thoughts raced, but in the end, burdened by too many concerns, he said no more. The solidified killing intent, like a volcano forcibly frozen, gradually subsided.

Seizing this opportunity, the Platinum Avatar's light flickered slightly.

In the distance, the army of Wansheng Sword Sect cultivators who had been on standby suddenly lit up with countless sharp sword lights.

The disciples of the North Pole Peak served as the main force, sweeping up the sword cultivators from the other peaks like a steel torrent bursting through a dike. They transformed into streaks of sword rainbows and charged resolutely into the still unclosed crack in the Aetila界壁.

The sword light was cold and sharp, their target aimed directly at the Western Wilds, competing with the Vanguard of the Primordial Origin Sect for the remaining origin and opportunities of Aetila.

Xu Yunfan's eyes flickered as he watched, but he didn't make many moves. He merely tapped his fingers slightly, sending an extremely obscure ripple into Aetila, aimed at distorting others' perceptions.

There was no need for much; a slight touch at a key point would suffice.

He was well-versed in the洞冥蚀天箓 and had already perfected it, making him the most suitable person for the task. Even True Monarch Tianguang before him hadn't察觉 a thing.

On the scorched earth of the Western Wilds in the荒野 of Aetila.

Lu Chuan stood atop a massive divine corpse half-buried in the scorched earth, the spiritual talisman on his forehead glowing brightly. It was the token and communication seal bestowed by Xu Yunfan.

He cupped his fists toward the statue of the Supreme Savior Heavenly尊 ahead—this was the person Xu Yunfan had instructed him to obey unconditionally—then turned and shouted sternly.

"Deploy the周天挪移阵! By the True Monarch's decree, the day the formation is completed is the day we slaughter gods and seize their origin!"

Three thousand cultivators responded in unison, their voices shaking the shattered world.

Formation flags rose like a forest, stabbing fiercely into the blackened earth.

The moment the formation patterns lit up, a不甘 shriek from the残魂 of the Dark God Ymir echoed from deep underground. The resentful and dark power attempted to侵蚀 the formation's foundation but was firmly suppressed by the starlight and purple lightning falling from the phantom of the Star Spirit Banner outside the realm.

Battles between the cultivators and the remaining divine creatures, as well as the twisted nature spirits, erupted everywhere on the scorched earth.

Hidden within the Divine Kingdom, Zhang Ziyang gazed down below. The appearance of the Primordial Origin Sect disciples was beneficial to him. As long as they didn't move his foundation of faith, he could expand rapidly.

As long as the incense and faith were sufficient, his authority and status could rise quickly. It wasn't impossible for him to gain enough foundation in this world and return to the太华灵墟界 to prove the Golden Core.

After all, the status of the Heavenly and Earthly Fiendish Stars Golden Core in the太华灵墟界 was several tiers higher than that of Aetila, which was naturally his first choice.

At this moment, within the界海, the profound light of Chaos birth and destruction constantly surged. In an unknown location.

Nine Nether Evil Mist quietly condensed, turning into a vague figure.

True Monarch洞明 played with the bone jade treasure box that sealed the Nightfall Dao Fruit. The玄煞 magical power continuously渗透 into the box, refining the Dao Fruit. Her gaze穿透 the layers of Chaos, falling upon the two True Monarchs confronting each other outside Aetila, and a cold sneer curled at the corner of her mouth.

"Greed is like a snake trying to swallow an elephant. Junior Brother Xu, the taste of the Great Brightness Dao Fruit is hard to swallow, isn't it?"

She sensed the weakened yet still vast origin fluctuations within Aetila, as well as the influx of cultivators from the two sects.

"When snipe and clam grapple, it is the fisherman who benefits. Let's see who the true fisherman is."

Her figure merged back into the evil mist and disappeared without a trace, obviously plotting something deeper.

That Great Brightness Dao Fruit was undoubtedly a versatile fruit. Although its compatibility wasn't particularly high, it was sufficient.

As long as one wished to practice the mutual nourishment of Yin and Yang, they would surely pay some attention to it.

Outside the Aetila realm, the two True Monarchs stood in silent confrontation, yet the consumption was immense.

Seeing that all the Sword Sect disciples had entered, True Monarch Tianguang no longer lingered.

The Platinum Glaze Avatar transformed into a sword light that solidified time,拉开 the distance from Xu Yunfan, leaving behind a region of Profound Light Crystal in the界海 that was permanently solidified, showcasing the might of his Dao Fruit.

The phantom of the Platinum Glaze Avatar still hung high, overlooking the group of Sword Cultivators in the Aetila sky.

The two were too close, their minds tense. The slightest movement might trigger a great battle, and True Monarch Tianguang naturally did not want to fight at this time.

Unfortunately...

Xu Yunfan sighed inwardly,漠然 withdrawing his gaze.

He wasn't afraid of battle; in fact, he even looked forward to it a bit. Only by provoking conflict could he have a chance to advance further.

The advancement time given by the Attribute Panel was simply too long. Without the assistance of a Dao Fruit, relying solely on the Attribute Panel to advance, he might only be able to take that final step near the end of his lifespan.

If that were the case, it would be equivalent to completely giving up his own life.

Xu Yunfan naturally wasn't willing.

He glanced one last time at the spiritual lights of the formations constructed by the Primordial Origin Sect cultivators within the Aetila crack, the纵横 sword qi of the Wansheng Sword Sect cultivators, and the twisted shadows of the divine scourge on the scorched earth. His mind moved slightly.

"Retreat!"

The Myriad-Zhang Thunder Avatar transformed into a condensed stream of紫金 light and vanished into his brow in an instant, leaving only a phantom of the avatar to remain,以便 it could return here in an instant.

The Golden Core's marvelous methods are infinite; this is merely one of the capabilities of an avatar.

The Attribute Panel silently跳动 in his vision.

'Progression: 1259 (Early Golden Core Peak)
Heavenly Pillar Support: 43%... 44%'

Hmm, there was slight improvement from the dual cultivation with True Monarch Dongming and refining Chiyang's origin.

He flicked his sleeve and收起 the界壁 platform, which had承受 the aftermath of the True Monarch-level confrontation and whose spiritual light had dimmed slightly.

The key resource for the next step of suspending the Heavenly Pillar lies in the origin of this world.

Xu Yunfan's figure transformed into a streak of紫金 Thunder that tore through the界海, disappearing into the depths of the界海 in an instant.

He naturally wouldn't just守在这里. With the avatar phantom remaining, he could return here in an instant with a single thought.

There were still very important matters he needed to attend to.

Primordial Origin Sect, Nine Immortal Mountains, Divine Thunder Mountain.

In the following ten years, Xu Yunfan藏 himself deep within the fire eye of the Divine Thunder Mountain's地脉, and also引接 the extremely pure thunder from the Divine Thunder Mountain to descend, continuously refining himself.

The scorching magma rolled, forming a natural furnace, yet it was nothing compared to the景象 within his Dantian.

The离光燃焰赤阳道果,包裹 by紫金 Thunder, was still like a imprisoned molten sun, violently jumping and碰撞. Each tremor caused the space around Xu Yunfan to warp, releasing pure Yang heat waves that could焚灭 all things.

He sat cross-legged in the void. The Divine Thunder Avatar phantom flickered behind him, with three heads and six arms each performing their duties.

The central true form's eyes were tightly shut, his divine sense like a net,死死 locking down the restless origin of the赤阳道果.
