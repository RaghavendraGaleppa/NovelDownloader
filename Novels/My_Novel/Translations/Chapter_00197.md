Chapter 197: Consuming the Golden Scale, Li Xian’s Personal Manual

Seven hundred miles of a long road.

This day, passing through the Taihang Mountains, black smoke rose in the distance, where a force was boiling refined food. The Madam had been traveling for days, weary from the journey by carriage and boat. Seeing the towering mountains of Taihang as the sun set in the dusk, a mountain city sat by the mountainside, its buildings glowing as if painted with gold.

Wishing to rest for the night and wash and change clothes, she ordered Li Xian into the city.

Li Xian acknowledged the order and turned onto the mountain path. As he went up the mountain, by the roadside ahead, an old woodcutter lay unconscious, firewood scattered all over the ground.

Li Xian felt a pang of sympathy and called out, "Old man, old man!"

The woodcutter was already unconscious, the snow piling up like a blanket, covering him thickly. Li Xian was secretly alert and channeled his palm force, striking through the air. The palm energy turned into a gust of wind, blowing the accumulated snow away.

"He really is unconscious," Li Xian turned and asked, "Madam, what should we do?"

"Just an old farmer, go around him," Wen Qing said.

Li Xian said, "Madam, weren't we going to a nearby big city to find an inn to stay? How about we give him a ride along the way?"

Wen Qing fell silent for a moment, finding it troublesome. But then she said, "Up to you. I will rest for a while; you handle it properly."

Li Xian carried the old farmer on his back, checking his bone structure—he had never practiced martial arts. His mind eased slightly. He then felt the pulse; the breath was weak.

"In this heavy snow, the old farmer collapsed on the road with firewood scattered everywhere. He must have walked ten miles or so to chop wood. His strength failed him, and he fainted on the road."

"It’s a small matter, easy to handle. It won't be a bother."

Li Xian placed the firewood on the carriage frame and channeled his internal energy into the old farmer's body. White Cloud lightly trotted its four hooves, heading toward a nearby town.

The old farmer gradually woke up, drowsy, with the scenery rushing backward. He muttered, "Am I dead?" He let out a long sigh, seemingly resigned. After a while, he realized it didn't feel like death. He reached out and felt around, the touch smooth and slick. In surprise, he looked around.

He realized he was being carried in a fragrant, jade-like carriage. In his panic, he tried to jump off the carriage but was pulled back by a hand. The old farmer looked closely and asked, "Im... Immortal? Where are you taking me?"

Li Xian laughed and said, "What Immortal? I saw you unconscious. I'm just giving you a ride."

The old farmer scratched his head, finally understanding the situation, and immediately expressed his endless gratitude. Li Xian didn't think much of it and simply sent him back to his village before driving the horse away.

"You helped him today, but he might die tomorrow because he can't eat his fill or stay warm. Isn't that just wasting your effort?" Wen Qing's voice drifted from inside the carriage.

It turned out she hadn't been sleeping; she had been observing Li Xian. Her tone was full of不解 (confusion).

She never offered help.

Li Xian smiled and said, "For no other reason, it's just to satisfy my heart."

"To satisfy your heart?" Wen Qing murmured. "You are quite open-minded. By doing so, you make me seem cold-hearted."

The carriage drove into the Taihang Mountain City. On the way, they passed by a sect's main gate. The plaque read "Taihang Mountain Sect," with a grand and imposing aura.

Li Xian found a famous and expensive inn in the city to rent a room. He also ordered a few exquisite dishes, asking the chef to cook them immediately as he was starving. Then he went to guide the Madam into the inn.

The inn servant said, "Sir, it's cold today. Do you want hot water? If you do, I'll go get it right away, but... it will cost a bit extra. The firewood and labor costs add up to..."

"Take it." Li Xian tossed a silver coin with great generosity.

The servant smiled and said, "Alright! Sir is generous!" He led White Cloud into the stable and fed it fine hay.

Several hot dishes were served on the table: crispy peanuts, soy-sauce beef, stir-fried pork liver, Taihang oil chicken... Each place has its own customs and dishes. This kind of small-town stir-fry is full of the smell of fire and smoke, quite appetizing.

The Madam sat gracefully, picked up the wine pot to pour wine. With a fair hand extended, she actually poured a bowl for Li Xian as well.

Li Xian was startled, his expression strange. Wen Qing said slowly, "In the Jianghu, you are just a green boy, not as experienced as me. I can drink too."

"I have a rare moment of leisure today, so I'll drink freely with you. Don't be restrained."

Li Xian felt flattered and hurriedly raised his bowl to clink with hers. The Madam consumed Dew Nectar, which could stave off hunger, but it was hard to avoid the desire for the taste of food and drink.

Li Xian raised his bowl to propose a toast. Wen Qing held her sleeve with one hand and her cup with the other, lightly smiling as she tapped her cup against his, saying, "Drink," and finished the wine in her cup.

She picked up a crispy peanut and put it in her mouth, chewing slowly and savoring it. Li Xian was both surprised and strange.

Wen Qing asked, "Why aren't you eating?"

"I was thinking, Madam, you are so close to me," Li Xian said truthfully.

"Was I far from you before?" Wen Qing asked with a smile.

"Far from me... and a bit fierce."

Li Xian had never eaten at the same table with the Madam. Although he lived in the back courtyard and was very close to the Madam, there were layers of schemes and calculations between them. Today, he suddenly felt the Madam getting close, his mind was shaken, and there were fewer calculations. His words came entirely from the heart.

"Hmm?" Wen Qing frowned and said, "Raise your hand."

Li Xian thought he had misspoken and raised his hand honestly. Wen Qing struck him with her chopsticks, but it didn't hurt. Wen Qing smiled and said, "I'll let it slide today."

"Madam, I toast you," Li Xian mustered his courage and filled another cup. Wen Qing rolled her eyes and said, "Are you trying to get me drunk?" But she still clinked cups and took a light sip.

Taihang Mountain City was built against the mountains. At night, the wind and snow howled. The inn business was slow, and the two were alone, undisturbed.

Staying overnight in an inn, only now, a trace of true feelings was revealed.

The next day.

The warm sun rose in the east, and purple energy floated upward.

The mountain city was bustling. Li Xian opened the window and saw the houses and pavilions in the city rising and falling, the layout chaotic.

Suddenly, a thought occurred: "This city is built in the mountains. If I am ever chased by a powerful enemy in the future, I might hide here, using this unique terrain."

"Drinking with the Madam last, was the first time." Li Xian stretched his body, went downstairs to prepare, and prepared to set off back to the manor.

Approaching the stable, he suddenly heard a commotion.

He saw six people surrounding the stable, all broad-shoulded and muscular, with overbearing attitudes. Those six were teasing White Cloud, stroking its mane, touching its saddle, and talking among themselves:

"Tsk tsk tsk, such a rare fine horse. I saw it last night and thought about it all night. Today, going door to door, I finally found it."

"I didn't inherit my father's talent, but I inherited his love for horses like life itself. Such a fine horse, I really can't bear to let go upon seeing it!"

Li Xian shouted, "What are you doing?"

The six turned around. The leader, Liu Shanxing, said, "Is this your horse?"

"Yes," Li Xian said.

Liu Shanxing waved his hand impatiently and said, "I want it. Get lost, get lost."

"You want to seize it by force? You don't seem to have the qualifications," Li Xian said calmly.

Liu Shanxing raised an eyebrow and asked, "Do you know where this is?"

"Taihang Mountain City," Li Xian said.

Liu Shanxing asked again, "You know your grandpa's territory's name, then let me ask you, do you know who your grandpa is?"

"Your grandpa is me, the Taihang Mountain Sect's Liu Shanxing! With one word from me, I can seal off the entire Taihang Mountain. Hehe, as the saying goes, it's easy to enter the mountain but hard to leave."

"This horse is mine, you get lost quickly!"

It turned out...

Last night, riding into the city, White Cloud trod on flying snow, looking exceptionally handsome and elegant. Passing by the Taihang Mountain Sect, it was seen by this Liu Shanxing. This guy has a癖性 (obsessive nature) for horses. Upon seeing a fine horse, he couldn't move his feet.

He was immediately tempted and wanted to seize it by force.

This morning, afraid the strange horse would be gone, he brought his thugs early to search the inns door to door.

That's how this scene came about.

Seeing Li Xian refuse to back down, Liu Shanxing became annoyed and said, "You, you, you deal with him! My father's birthday banquet is coming soon. If I get this horse, I'll献给 (offer) it to my father. If my father is happy, I'll reward you with martial arts to practice!"

The surrounding disciples looked at each other, their minds greedy, and sneered. They stepped forward together, vaguely forming a formation.

Li Xian's martial arts progress was very fast, but whenever he faced an opponent, he never underestimated them. He knew the power of formations and immediately struck first.

His sharp sword left its sheath, slashing toward one of the big men's chest.

The big man was startled. The formation wasn't formed yet, and his steps were already in disarray. He couldn't dodge and took the blow squarely. Blood splashed, he let out a惨叫 (miserable scream), and immediately fainted.

Li Xian's feet moved nimbly, turning around to strike two more times. The swordsmanship was exquisite and peerless, the sword intent sharp and decisive. Although these thugs were not weak, how could they be his match.

In no time, they were all defeated.

Liu Shanxing had dominated the market for years, never expecting to kick an iron plate. His cultivation was the highest among them, and he had the most resources. But his character was cowardly and weak.

Now, in his panic and anger, "Ouch!" he fell to the ground.

He had a strong physique and had consumed [Refined Treasures] since childhood, refining him to the Food Essence realm. But he was lazy in learning martial arts, and was this cowardly.

Wen Qing had a good sleep last night and was in a good mood, as if she had drunk sweet dew. She walked down from the upstairs and asked, "What is all this noise about?"

"Madam, this man wanted to seize White Cloud," Li Xian said truthfully.

"I... I am the son of Liu Xuelong of the Taihang Mountain Sect," Liu Shanxing said. "You... what do you want to do?"

Li Xian asked, "This kind of lowlife, should I beat him up and throw him on the street?"

"He is no lowlife."

Wen Qing said, "His father Liu Xuelong, I have indeed heard of his name. He dominates the Taihang Mountain area, a martial artist of the Second Realm. He modeled the Taihang Mountain's momentum and created his own martial arts: Taihang Stele Breaking Hand, Taihang Mountain Moving Technique... all quite good, commendable."

"Yes, yes, yes."

Liu Shanxing puffed out his chest, suddenly gaining confidence, and glared at Li Xian. "I didn't expect this beautiful woman to have some knowledge. That's right, my father is Liu Xuelong. As the saying goes, a dragon in the Taihang Mountain. That refers to my father. Since you know his name, are you willing to sell this strange horse?"

Li Xian thought: "You fool, I would have just beaten you once and wouldn't have harmed your life. But now that the Madam has come down, hearing her tone, soft yet sharp, warm yet hidden with needles... whether you can keep your life is hard to say."

Wen Qing said, "I heard your father is holding a birthday banquet recently?"

"Yes," Liu Shanxing puffed out his chest again.

"What a pity, what a pity," Wen Qing shook her head.

"You want to attend the birthday banquet? To celebrate my father's birthday?" Liu Shanxing said. "You are so beautiful. If you go to celebrate, my father would surely be happy. If you are willing to sell this horse to me, I will give you an invitation."

Wen Qing said, "I mean... it's pitiful that your father will have a funeral before the birthday banquet. Kill him."

Liu Shanxing said, "Wh... What kill? You... you..." He couldn't believe it.

Li Xian's sword fell, Liu Shanxing's head rolled to the ground, instantly dead.

Wen Qing said, "Send the head back."

"Madam, will this be..." Li Xian asked.

Wen Qing said, "It's fine."

Li Xian called the inn servant, gave him a reward to keep his mouth shut. He took a red silk cloth, wrapped Liu Shanxing's head, and tied it to an arrow.

Passing by the Taihang Mountain Sect, he shot the arrow out. Riding away, he left without a trace.

Returning to Qingning County, Li Xian refined day and night, finally bringing [Gang Thunder Finger] to perfection.

[Gang Thunder Finger]

[Proficiency: 245/20000 Perfection]

[Description: You have practiced the Gang Thunder Finger, understanding the four killing techniques thoroughly, using them freely. "Chest Drumming Thunder Sound" is significantly enhanced, and the thunder sound is gradually showing variations.]

The Qi Lake expanded, the thunder sound in his body vibrated, refining his physique. His strength became even more powerful.

Li Xian's chest drummed with thunder, as deep and powerful as a giant bell. With a thought, he used his finger force to rebound the thunder sound, but it was sharp like a needle.

A wild rabbit, hearing the thunder sound by chance, its ears immediately bled, its legs kicked, and it died on the road.

"The greatest benefit of the Gang Thunder Finger is that it taught me how to use the Chest Drumming Thunder Sound flexibly. If I encounter a strong enemy, this move might catch them off guard and turn the tide!"

The carriage sped forward.

Along the way, they encountered demons and bandits. All the small matters and trivial affairs were handled by Li Xian.

Wen Qing saw this and thought: "Although his cultivation is shallow, I am becoming more and more reluctant to part with him."

In the blink of an eye, the day to return to the manor arrived.

After handling some miscellaneous matters.

In the inner courtyard.

The Heaven and Earth Treasure Box was placed in front of them. Wen Qing was decisive in rewards and punishments and said, "I will give you a scale or a tail."

"Today, I will teach you how to consume [Human Yellow]."

"You must remember everything about today well. Because these are your exclusive recipes."

"Remember the first Human Yellow treasure!"
