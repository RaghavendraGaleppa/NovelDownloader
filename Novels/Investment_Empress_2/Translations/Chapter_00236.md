# Chapter 236: Princess Jiang's New Opponent, Your Tea is Very Moist (Part 1)

Inside the World Seed.

"The Vajra Indestructible Body can at least withstand attacks at the External Scene level."

"The stronger my physique, the longer the duration."

Our Heavenly尊 was standing in front of the overturned alchemy furnace, summarizing the results of his recent experiment.

He tested it seriously again, essentially mastering the Vajra Indestructible Body to about eighty or ninety percent.

"I should also find time to bring the Extreme Weapon Killing Body to its peak state."

Every extra moment of duration for the Vajra Indestructible Body is a good thing.

Actually, his physique was already strong enough. He wondered just how powerful his physical body needed to be to maintain this state at all times.

He shouldn't be too ambitious...

Li Mo shook his head.

He cleared his mind and glanced at the increasingly vast World Seed, feeling that this small world was now too empty.

He recalled that the Great Yin Divine Intent he observed could manifest a true moon within the small world.

What about the Stone Monkey Divine Intent?

Just as he was pondering this...

Jiang Chulong arrived. She was holding a small bundle in her arms and hesitated for a moment before handing it over.

"What is this?"

"A gift... for the teacher's Mid-Autumn Festival."

The Mid-Autumn Festival was the same as the Mid-Autumn Festival from his previous life, with similar customs, just occurring a bit earlier.

Opening the small cloth bundle, he found several mooncakes inside, still bearing the sect emblem of the Hengyun Sword City.

The image immediately surfaced in the Heavenly尊's mind.

Princess Jiang, peeking around at the banquet in the Hengyun Sword City, sneaking away the mooncakes that were served as post-meal pastries when no one was looking.

Li Mo couldn't help but laugh.

"Thank you."

"Teacher is all alone... spending the festival alone... must be so lonely."

Jiang Chulong knew this feeling well and felt a bit heartache.

After finishing the festival with Brother Li, she should keep the teacher company.

The image of the teacher waiting alone here surfaced in her mind.

An empty-nest Heavenly尊, don't let waiting become a regret...

"Teacher, rest assured... Chulong will definitely... work hard to... to rebuild your body as soon as possible."

"????... Hmm, but you should also know when to ease up and when to exert yourself."

The Heavenly尊 didn't quite understand where Princess Jiang's sudden burst of fighting spirit came from.

But Princess Jiang was indeed very hardworking.

She was now on the verge of opening her apertures, directly heading towards the Observation of the Divine state.

However, she was asking fewer and fewer questions about the sword path.

This indicated that Jiang Chulong's confusion about the sword path was decreasing; all that was lacking was accumulation.

Hmm...

Li Mo was happy for her, but also a bit troubled.

Where could he make up for this missing martial arts insight? In the future, when he continues to condense the Profound Core, he will inevitably have to learn many mental cultivation methods, and his consumption of insight will be like flowing water.

He looked up.

Jiang Chulong was sparring with the scarecrows, and the time it took for her to win was getting shorter and shorter.

Little Li Mo started his brain working.

A moment later.

All the scarecrows disappeared with the wind.

Jiang Chulong had no opponents in front of her anymore. She turned around and asked:

"Teacher... shall we... tell stories today?"

Usually, after practicing swordsmanship and resting, the teacher would tell her stories.

"It's still too early."

The Heavenly尊 stood up and glanced at the Great Yin. Today's sword practice hadn't even reached the halfway point.

Moreover, Princess Jiang hadn't made much progress today.

Because those scarecrows no longer posed any threat to her.

"I think it's about time."

"Huh? When... when is it time?"

Jiang Chulong blinked, a bit confused.

Then she heard the Heavenly尊 teacher's voice carrying a hint of laughter:

"It's time to change your opponent."

As the words fell.

This small world suddenly changed its appearance.

From the scene of the Heavenly Court, it instantly transformed into a mountain forest with clear waters and lush vegetation. Not far away, there was a mountain with a waterfall cascading down, the spray forming a rainbow.

"This... this is..."

Jiang Chulong's gray-white eyes behind the cloth strip widened instantly.

"That's right, this is the Flower and Fruit Mountain."

The Heavenly尊's voice suddenly became deep and emotional, filled with nostalgia.

"Your new opponent is here."

"It's... it's..."

Princess Jiang looked inside excitedly.

Then she saw a figure pass through the waterfall, walk out of the mist, and appear before her.

"Sun Wukong!"

Jiang Chulong clapped her hands excitedly. She wanted to get closer but didn't dare:

---

"Master, how is he... how can he be here..."

"This is not his true self, nor is it a living being, but an imprint he personally left behind for me to keep."

The Heavenly尊 teacher said softly.

Jiang Chulong: "!"

The teacher really had contact with the Great Sage who caused havoc in the Heavenly Court from "Journey to the West"? And their relationship seemed quite close...

Truly worthy of being the Heavenly尊 teacher!

Well, the Heavenly尊 knew his own situation.

This was actually similar to the scarecrows in function.

The fundamental difference was that this imprint truly contained the divine intent from the "Wukong Seeking Dao Diagram." It was a projection of the Stone Monkey divine pattern within Li Mo's soul intent.

"This will be your new opponent from now on."

"But... but..."

"Chulong, what did I tell you before?"

"No matter... what kind of enemy... you face... you must dare to draw your sword..."

"Go for it!"

.....

The next morning.

"Another forty years of martial arts insight earned, and it also gave Chulong a good workout."

"Li Mo, Li Mo, you're truly a genius!"

Li Mo looked at his reflection in the mirror, pointing and praising himself with a smile.

Once Chulong breaks through, there will surely be quite a few more rewards.

In the morning, he originally wanted to ask when they would set off to return to the Ziyang Prefecture, but neither Elder Qian nor Elder Xue could be found.

So he took out the Panjie Meteor Hammer and began tempering his physique.

Most martial arts become more difficult the further you go, and body tempering is especially so. It requires the work of a water mill, polishing oneself over years and months, and it can't be compensated for with talent.

Fortunately, with the assistance of the divine weapon and high-quality medicinal herbs, his progress wasn't too pathetic.

Just exhausting.

At noon, the sky was gray, and fallen leaves piled up in the courtyard.

Li Mo finished tempering his physique and sat at the table with his arms hanging limp, too tired to move.

Just before he put away the hammer treasure, he had deliberately used a bit less World Force, wanting to see what his limit was.

And this was the result.

At the table.

The girl sat quietly there. A butterfly the color of withered leaves landed on her fingertip, then was gently sent away with a flick.

Our Empress of the Phoenix was truly easy to feed. With food to eat and tea to drink, she had no other desires.

"Ice Cube, I'm so thirsty."

"Drink tea."

"No strength."

"?"

Ying Bing raised her head and saw the boy covered in sweat, his lips dry.

A hint of helplessness flashed through her clear, deep eyes. She pushed the teacup, which had just been at her own lips, towards the boy.

He gulped down three cups in a row.

Tea water clung to his lips, but he was too lazy to wipe it.

He was originally a handsome youth with red lips and white teeth, and now it made his lips look even more ruddy.

Not only did they look moist, the touch was also...

Ying Bing was never one to indulge in wild fantasies.

But women always remember certain things and certain feelings vividly.

And it was the first time in two lifetimes...

Seeing the girl looking at him intermittently, Li Mo praised:

"Thanks, your tea is very moist."

"..."

Ying Bing lowered her eyes quietly.

Should she buy another teacup?

But she hadn't seen this style anywhere else.

If she couldn't find a matching set, it would feel uncomfortable...

Just at this moment.

Shang Wu walked in, yawning and looking quite displeased.

Qian Bufan and Xue Jing were the same.

"What's wrong?"

Seeing their expressions, Li Mo asked.

"A rebel general from the Southern Frontier has fled to Yunzhou."

"I know about that."

"He killed many people along the way, and recently, a sect disciple ran into him and was taken hostage."

"Who's so unlucky?"

Li Mo realized something was wrong after asking.

Affairs in Yunzhou shouldn't require the Qingyuan Sect's intervention. The Sword City is so large, and there are even Law Body experts presiding over it. There's no way an Internal Scene expert could stir up trouble here; there's no need to ask others for help.

"Murong Xiao."

"..."
