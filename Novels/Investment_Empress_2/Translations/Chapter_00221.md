# Chapter 221: Group Photo, The First Otaku of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands (Part 1)

The final segment of the awards ceremony was, naturally, the group photo.

The heavy responsibility of photography was entrusted to our best cameraman, Senior Brother Ouyang, whose quick sketches were as precise as a printing press.

Everyone lined up in front of the counter, each holding a little golden statue. After all, even Xu Xiao'er received an award for "Best Atmosphere Group."

Oh...

Princess Jiang Chulong's hands were empty.

She stood not far away, clutching her skirt and holding her small basket, looking on with longing and envy.

She hadn't gone to the Listening Wind Pavilion with Big Brother Li.

So, she didn't get a prize.

In truth, she really wanted a little Big Brother Li. If anyone didn't want theirs and threw it away, she would go pick it up...

But looking at the glittering golden statues, it seemed she might be waiting a while...

*Clang—*

A little golden statue suddenly fell to the ground.

Jiang Chulong looked up in confusion.

She saw Li Mo looking up at the sky, saying strangely, "Where did my little golden statue go?"

Jiang Chulong picked it up and was about to say something when Li Mo winked at her.

"Chulong has a prize too, you know."

"What... what is it?"

"Do you often pick up trash?"

"Um... yes."

"Congratulations, you have played a model and leading role in the local environmental hygiene! This must be a hefty reward!"

Actually, picking up trash was just one of Chulong's personal hobbies.

She was both happy and a little embarrassed as she was pulled over to join them.

Everyone stood together.

"Everyone, smile."

Li Mo casually took the little golden statue from the Ice Cube's hand and subconsciously called out.

In his memories from before the amnesia, his family used to take a few group photos every year in his previous life.

Standing here with everyone now, it really felt like the atmosphere of taking a family portrait back then.

Hmmmm.

Thinking of smiling.

Li Mo looked at the "smile-challenged" person standing next to him—the Ice Cube.

It was back. Everything was back.

It was that feeling of his scalp tingling.

"What's wrong?"

Jiang Chulong turned her head, her delicate body suddenly shivering.

Sister Ice's fake smile...

It was so scary!

How to make the Ice Cube smile quickly? This might be the biggest challenge of the ceremony.

"I've tried my best."

Ying Bing returned to her expressionless face, which actually looked a bit gentler this way.

"Yeah, you really did try your best..."

Li Mo wanted to say that smiling isn't something that can be solved with effort.

Telling a joke like last time definitely wouldn't work.

But.

He was a genius, and a sudden idea came to him.

Li Mo looked at the girl's slender, delicate waist.

Girls have a special, extremely sensitive spot. Does anyone know what it is?

3...

2...

1...

That's right, it's the ticklish spot!

Li Mo took advantage of her unpreparedness and launched a sneak attack!

*Squish...*

By the way.

Don't be fooled by the Ice Cube's cold exterior; her touch was soft and fragrant, and quite comfortable...

"If it doesn't work, you don't have to draw me..."

Ying Bing's unfinished sentence was cut short as she pursed her lips and swallowed it back.

An electric,酥麻 (numbing) sensation spread from her waist, flowing through her entire body like a current, making her fingers curl and even causing her to shrink her neck slightly.

She looked down and saw the boy looking up at her with anticipation.

"Did you smile?"

"......"

Ying Bing was not amused.

"!"

Seeing the cold displeasure in her almond-shaped eyes, Little Li realized something.

Little Li, it seems not all of his ideas were genius...

I'm done for.

As expected, the next moment, the soft flesh next to his waist was pinched and twisted one hundred and eighty degrees.

Because of his sneak attack, the Ice Cube abandoned all sense of propriety.

"Let go, let go... Ouch..."

Li Mo sucked in a cold breath, tearfully covering her icy little hand, but the more he covered it, the tighter she pinched.

Qian Bufan couldn't bear to look: "...... Sigh."

Xue Jing laughed heartily: "Tsk tsk, hehe..."

Shang Wu suddenly let out a resigned laugh: "Haha... Your grandma's."

---

Including Ouyang and Shen Yunfei, the older ones fell into deep thought.

Because they suddenly felt that if they appeared in the painting, it would probably seem... quite redundant.

Jiang Chulong was a bit anxious.

As for Xu Xiao'er... he revealed a look of wisdom.

Just ignore him, he's a lunatic.

Ouyang was still quick-witted, his brush flying across the paper.

And so, this scene was forever captured.

He even kindly painted himself into it as well.

...

Nightfall.

The rooftop of the wine tavern.

"Was I... making that kind of expression?"

Ying Bing was a bit lost in thought.

Looking at the portrait, the coldness in her eyes was gone, replaced by a hint of displeasure as she pinched the soft flesh on Li Mo's waist.

Actually, this question didn't need to be asked.

In the painting, Elder Qian's helplessness, Elder Xue's relief, Shang Wu's sour face, Jiang Chulong's cautiousness, the others leaning back tactically...

Everything had just happened in reality.

Especially him.

That look of him covering his waist and sucking in cold air, his handsome face twisted.

It was all vivid in her mind.

"It's natural..."

Ying Bing took a sip of tea, the corner of her mouth curving up.

Why be confused?

Wasn't she in this scene, perfectly harmonious?

"But next time, I have to tell him he can't just touch a girl's..."

Ying Bing recalled that touch, and a slight shiver ran down her spine.

Speaking of which, the system wasn't interfering this time.

Why did his touch feel the same as when they were sparring with swords before...

[Ding—]

Hey hey hey, talk about a coincidence.

The system notification popped up again.

[Time until the next ranking comparison: 24 hours.]

[The punishment content is: to request the winner to touch, covering over 80% of the area...]

Previously.

Ying Bing didn't think much of it.

But the feeling she just experienced kept lingering in her mind...

Some things are just like this.

The more you try to forget them, the more deeply they become rooted in your mind.

.........

On the other side.

In the courtyard of the wine tavern, by the Tiger and Dragon Alchemical Furnace.

"Ah..."

Li Mo had the painting on his knees, waiting for Little Bao and Elder Xue.

He planned to condense the last of the Seven Mysterious Pills today.

Then he could attempt the Heaven-Overturning Form.

"Li Shidi, what's wrong?"

Ouyang passed by and saw him sighing.

He didn't understand.

How could someone like Li Shidi still have troubles?

"I'm thinking, even geniuses can have moments of mental crisis."

"What kind of crisis?"

Ouyang considered himself a genius too, and he was older.

He should be able to guide Li Shidi and save this lost lamb.

"Senior Brother Ouyang, do you understand what women are thinking?"

"You've drawn so many beautiful women, you should be quite knowledgeable about this... Senior Brother Ouyang?"

Li Mo sighed.

But he found that Senior Brother Ouyang had gone silent.

He turned around.

He saw Senior Brother Ouyang with dead fish eyes, staring at him with a gaze filled with resentment heavier than a ghost's.

"Your grandma's."

"Huh?"

"I wouldn't date even if it were a relationship. What's so good about real women? The little sisters and young ladies in the paintings are much better."

"......"

Li Mo was silent.

Although he didn't know why Senior Brother Ouyang was reacting so strongly.

It seemed he had unintentionally given birth to the first otaku of the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands...

Little Li changed the subject:

"By the way, Senior Brother Ouyang, why are you in the painting too?"

"Of course, it's by controlling the brush with Qi."

"Huh?"

"You think it's normal to control a sword with Qi?"

"Normal."

"So what's so unreasonable about controlling a brush with Qi to make it paint automatically?"

"....... Makes sense."
