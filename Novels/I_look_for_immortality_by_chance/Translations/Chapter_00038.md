# Chapter 38: The Face-Stealer Spider and the Opportunist?

Although the Red-Tailed Apes were only at the fifth level of Qi Refinement at most, as the saying goes, even ants can kill an elephant when they swarm in numbers.

With four or five Red-Tailed Apes attacking together, all fearless of death, an ordinary fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator might indeed face mortal danger.

"Screech! Screech!"

Sharp cries echoed through the watery cavern as ten pairs of crimson eyes brimmed with savagery, seemingly intent on tearing the Taoist before them to pieces.

"Splash!"

But at that moment, a thick mist suddenly spread through the cavern, accompanied by the sound of pouring rain. The fog spread rapidly, like a white cloud exploding outward, instantly enveloping an area of thirty feet.

"Screech?"

The five charging Red-Tailed Apes were immediately swallowed by the mist. Their previously ferocious expressions froze as the dense, cloud-like fog isolated all senses. Their nostrils flared wildly, yet they could detect no trace of human scent or blood. Confused, they halted in place.

"Splash!"

Not only that, but a sudden downpour began. The demonic patterns on their chests were washed dim, as if suppressed.

"Screech! Screech! Screech!"

Unable to see the Taoist and with their demonic patterns weakened, the apes' eyes grew even redder, their faces twisting with rage as they frantically clawed at the mist, desperate to escape. But deprived of their senses, they merely circled aimlessly, always returning to the same spot.

"Thud!"

Then, from within the mist, icy chains and a cyan flying sword flashed simultaneously.

Concealed by the fog, the apes had no warning before the cold touch of the chains and sword reached them. By the time they sensed the chill, it was too late.

Red-Tailed Apes were not known for their physical resilience. The mid-grade magic sword, Little Green Spirit, pierced their throats with ease.

Blood spilled, yet not a hint of its scent escaped—everything was suppressed by the mist.

"Thud! Thud! Thud! Thud!"

Gu Yuan repeated the method, striking four times with Little Green Spirit, swiftly dispatching all five apes.

"Whoosh!"

The cloud-like seal of his technique sank back into his dantian. Looking at the five lifeless ape corpses, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile.

"The Cloudwalk Seal is even more effective than I imagined. As long as their spiritual sense and mana aren't far superior to mine, they're like fish in a barrel, easily slain."

Such was the power of a secret seal.

What should have been a grueling battle became as simple as chopping vegetables.

Wary of attracting more apes, Gu Yuan quickly stored the bodies in his storage pouch. Then, with a sweep of his mana, he retrieved a crimson jade clam from the water at his feet.

---

The clam was the size of two palms, its shell a vivid red. It rhythmically opened and closed with the water's flow, as if breathing, emitting a faint spiritual glow.

"Snap!"

Infusing his hand with mana, Gu Yuan easily pried the shell open.

Inside, nestled within pink flesh, lay a pearl the size of a longan fruit, radiating spiritual energy and exuding a delicate fragrance.

This was the jade pearl—also called a clam pearl—produced in the Yunyang Clam Fields. Consuming it could enhance one's mana by a month's worth of cultivation.

"Pop!"

"Gulp!"

Ignoring the clam's silent protest, Gu Yuan plucked the pearl and swallowed it whole. Once extracted, the pearl couldn't be preserved; immediate consumption was best.

"Boom!"

Sweet as candy, the pearl melted instantly on his tongue. A surge of intense heat flooded his limbs and bones before being assimilated into his mana, gradually converging into his dantian.

Gu Yuan's face flushed as his mana surged wildly, yet he didn't stop moving. There was no telling if more apes would come. It was best to leave quickly.

---

After walking for the time it took half an incense stick to burn, Gu Yuan's complexion returned to normal. He had fully refined the pearl's energy, gaining a month's worth of mana.

Though he hadn't been cultivating diligently during this time, the Evergreen Heaven and Earth Diagram within him continued its tireless work, drawing in spiritual energy. Combined with the benefits of the silverfish, Gu Yuan estimated his mana reserves had already reached half-capacity. In another six months, he would touch the threshold of the sixth level of Qi Refinement.

In the past, those six months would have been a grind. But today, that was no longer necessary.

"Thud!"

Gu Yuan thrust his sword forward, slaying another Red-Tailed Ape and claiming another pearl.

As the pearl dissolved in his throat, his mana surged once more. In another incense stick's time, he would gain another month's worth of cultivation.

But fearing further ape attacks, he pressed on without pausing to refine the energy.

---

An hour later, in a narrow section of the cavern:

Gu Yuan stabbed his sword into another ape, consuming his fourth pearl.

"Boom!"

His face flushed, his mana churning violently, he could almost feel the threshold of the sixth level.

"No wonder even the Dao Academy covets this place. Cultivating here is like riding the wind!"

Exhaling deeply, Gu Yuan smiled with satisfaction.

In just an hour, he had slain nearly ten Red-Tailed Apes, pushing his fifth-level Qi Refinement to its peak.

Now, all he needed was the Clam King's pearl to break through to the sixth level.

---

"By my estimate, the Clam King shouldn't be far now."

Gu Yuan eyed the dim tunnel ahead, gauging the distance.

"Boom!"

"Senior Brother Sun, another one's coming! We can't hold out much longer—use your magic treasure!"

Suddenly, panicked shouts and the sounds of battle echoed from ahead.

Gu Yuan's eyebrows rose in surprise.

With the Stone Liquid's guidance, he had foreseen the Clam King's location, allowing him to progress smoothly. Yet someone had somehow gotten ahead of him?

"It's them!"

Concealing his presence with mana and spiritual sense, Gu Yuan rounded a corner and surveyed the scene.

In a cavernous passage about thirty feet wide, four robed cultivators were locked in combat with over a dozen Red-Tailed Apes. Worse, four emerald-green Face-Stealer Spiders lurked nearby, watching intently.

An ordinary fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator would struggle against four apes alone. With the spiders adding venomous silk threads to the fray, the group was clearly overwhelmed.

These were none other than Yang Yue and his companions—the same disciples who had clashed with Gu Yuan on the treasure ship. The other three had stood behind Kuang Mingsheng that day, though Kuang himself was conspicuously absent.

"No time to hold back—kill the spiders first!" Yang Yue shouted urgently.

Six glowing seals orbited him, forming a dazzling defense. Yet the apes' demonic patterns flared as their crimson tails lashed like whips, pressing him relentlessly. Meanwhile, the spider before him—a grotesque, human-faced creature the size of a small hut—spat streams of venomous silk, aiming to bind his limbs.

With a snarl, Yang Yue slapped his waist, summoning a golden scissor-like magic treasure. It sheared through the silk, darting toward the spider's face.

But then, the spider emitted a soundless shriek.

"Screeeech!"

The piercing mental attack reverberated through the cavern. Yang Yue stiffened, his mind momentarily stunned, and his hovering weapon froze mid-air.

"Emerald Face-Stealer Spiders—guardians of the watery depths. Bodies hard as refined iron, silk strong as spirit ropes. Their soul-shaking shrieks can disrupt magic treasures. Often found guarding king jade in clam fields."

Recalling the bestiary's description, Gu Yuan nodded to himself.

The spiders' presence confirmed the Clam King was near.

Seizing the opportunity, the apes and spiders lunged at the dazed Yang Yue.

Fortunately, a crimson pearl materialized above him, casting a protective glow that shielded him just long enough to regain his senses and recall the golden scissors.

But the pearl's light had dimmed considerably, and his mana was nearly half-depleted. Against the frenzied onslaught, he was barely holding on.

His companions fared no better. The apes and spiders fought with reckless abandon, turning the battle into a brutal stalemate.

Watching this, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile.

His amusement stemmed from two realizations.

First, witnessing their struggle bolstered his confidence in his own strength.

Even elite disciples of the Dao Academy were nothing extraordinary. Had he been in their place, he wouldn't have been so hard-pressed.

Second—and more importantly—this was a perfect opportunity to play the fisherman reaping the rewards of others' strife.

"Keep fighting. I'll be on my way."

With a thought, Gu Yuan activated a seal in his dantian—one as ethereal as moonlight.

The Verdant Wood Sect's secret technique: Moonchaser Seal.

Upon activation, his body blurred into a shadow, swift as moonlight itself.

"Boom!"

Amidst the chaotic battle, a ghostly streak flickered past the combatants, unnoticed.

"Senior Brother! Please, aid us!" Yang Yue cried out, spotting the fleeting shadow.

But the moonlit figure didn't pause.
