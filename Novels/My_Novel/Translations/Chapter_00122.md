Chapter 122: A Warrior’s Obsession, A Peculiar Physique

The Nine Diagrams of Innate Purgation serve to wash the hands, feet, body, heart, bones, internal organs, skin, apertures, and will.

Each diagram depicts a specific posture, guiding the essence of heaven and earth to cleanse the body of impurities.

Li Xian’s progress was evident; his mind was clear, and he felt an indescribable lightness, as if shedding a heavy coat to bask in a gentle breeze.

When he opened his eyes, he found everyone staring at him. Unperturbed by the attention, Li Xian quietly stepped back behind Madam Wen.

Zeng Tai’an retracted his gaze and said, "Madam Wen, since it is settled, please be my guest and stay at the manor. Lately, we have added many new sights; I would be honored if you would appreciate them."

Madam Wen nodded. "Agreed."

And so, Madam Wen and Li Xian took up residence at the Manor of Blessing.

Zeng Tai’an, eager to digest the essence he had consumed, excused himself with an apology and left two young servants to entertain them. Madam Wen was not displeased and proceeded to walk through the manor with Li Xian.

They passed through a corridor lined with vegetation. On one side stood towering rockeries; on the other, a serene lake. Vines wrapped around the pillars of the corridor, creating a unique scenery. Sunlight filtered through the gaps in the vines, casting dappled patterns on the ground.

Madam Wen smiled and asked, "How does this manor compare to my Manor of Unity?"

Li Xian pondered for a moment. "If we speak of dignity and grandeur, our Manor of Unity is superior. But if we speak of delicate refinement, for now, the Manor of Blessing seems to have a slight edge."

Madam Wen was delighted. Li Xian’s words seemed to praise both, but in reality, he elevated the Manor of Unity. Dignity and grandeur versus delicate refinement—which is superior—is obvious at a glance. A warrior’s manor covers a vast area; it seeks to be magnificent and imposing.

The two young servants, unaware of the nuance, were secretly pleased, thinking, "Naturally, our master’s manor is superior."

Madam Wen, in a leisurely mood, walked slowly along the path, admiring the scenery. The two servants had to match her pace, not daring to walk too fast, and introduced the sights along the way.

"This flower and bird courtyard is quite nice."

"I had only heard of Master Zeng’s fondness for birds; today I finally see it."

Hearing the constant chirping, Madam Wen followed the sound to a lush garden where various strange birds perched in the trees. They came in all shapes and sizes, some exceptionally handsome with feathers that shimmered with a flowing light.

"The care required for these birds and beasts must have cost Master Zeng a great deal of effort?" Madam Wen smiled.

She extended a slender finger, and a blue-feathered bird landed on it. She gently stroked its feathers. The bird carried a faint, fresh scent; every blue feather was clean and tidy, exquisitely detailed. It was clearly well-groomed.

"Of course," the servant boy, Xiao Qing, counted on his fingers. "The Master loves birds and beasts. He spends at least half of every month in the flower and bird forest. Ordinary birds are left to us to feed, but the rare and unique species are personally tended to and carefully protected by the Master. Speaking of which, a while ago, a guard accidentally injured a bird. The Master, in a rage, chopped him up and fed him to the birds."

The servant chattered on without stopping.

Warriors have long lifespans. Once one reaches the Essence Consumption realm, consuming essence treasures adds to one’s years. Martial arts are naturally of the utmost importance, but with longevity, one needs pastimes. Otherwise, living too long becomes tasteless and boring. Thus, warriors often develop "obsessive arts." They delve deeply into certain strange practices or clever techniques.

"Being too indulgent and neglecting martial arts is not good," Madam Wen said, flicking her sleeve and turning to leave. The two servants dared not reply.

Madam Wen’s white robes were unstained by dust, pure and otherworldly. She casually asked, "Li Xian, did you feel anything strange during the purgation just now?"

Li Xian replied truthfully, "Compared to previous times, I felt an additional cool sensation. It was very comfortable."

Madam Wen nodded. She took his pulse; his vitality was vigorous, his True Form was on the verge of manifesting, and everything was looking good. "Continue practicing like this. By my estimation, you may soon manifest the Rebirth Physique."

"Li Xian knows nothing about the Rebirth Physique. I dare to ask for your guidance," Li Xian took the opportunity to ask.

"The Rebirth Physique..." Madam Wen shook her head. "To explain this in detail would take days and nights. All things in the world are shrouded in dust, making it hard to see their true faces. Manifesting a peculiar physique comes with corresponding traits. How to utilize these traits depends on the warrior’s fortune and wisdom. Once you walk the Jianghu in the future, you will naturally understand the myriad physiques of this world."

Madam Wen suddenly stopped walking and admonished, "Whether a warrior has undergone rebirth or not, martial arts remain the priority. In daily practice, you must not neglect them for a moment."

Li Xian was startled. It seemed the Madam was becoming increasingly concerned about his cultivation. This was a double-edged sword; it meant access to resources, but Madam Wen’s things were not given for free.

"I will heed the Madam’s teachings," Li Xian said sincerely.

Madam Wen smiled. "Today, I am in a leisurely mood. You shall accompany me in strolling the garden." Supported by Li Xian, she admired the various sights of the manor.

After a rough tour, Madam Wen’s interest waned, and she returned to her guest room to rest. Li Xian, however, was still full of interest, but he couldn't wander off on his own.

Thanks to the Madam’s status, Li Xian was also assigned a guest room. Though of a lower grade than the Madam’s, it had a courtyard, hall, bedroom, and bathroom.

"Traveling with the Madam is truly exhausting. This woman is difficult to serve."

He turned around, bolted the door, and took off his knife, long bow, and armor, letting out a huge sigh of relief. The Exorcism Bell was still tied to his waist.

This mystical artifact requires "Internal Qi" to drive it. Li Xian’s martial arts—Four Directions Fist, Breeze Leg, and Green Silk Palm—had all reached their peak. The amount of Qi in his dantian was definitely more than that of an average warrior. However, shaking the Exorcism Bell was still very taxing. To repel demons, merely ringing it was not enough; it had to be loud enough to intimidate.

Therefore, every time he shook the bell, he had to exert all his Qi and strength with a violent shake. Li Xian would feel his fingers go numb and his whole body exhausted. Not to mention, he was usually running errands for the Madam, dealing with various trivial matters, scouting routes, and getting rid of various low-level thugs.

But consuming the Madam’s essence treasures was his duty.

Li Xian sat on the threshold.

"This Manor of Blessing is not as good as the Manor of Unity. From the looks of Master Zeng, he wouldn't dare offend the Madam. It’s just... by a twist of fate, I’ve picked up a great bargain."

Li Xian trembled slightly; a clear energy rippled through his flesh and blood. This was the strange scene that appeared after washing away part of the impurities. Half-mud, half-clear.

"I’m getting closer to the Essence Consumption realm. The Madam said... I might have a Rebirth Physique, but I wonder what kind it is."

"Among Rebirth Physiques, one cannot simply distinguish good from bad. Because the manifested traits vary, and martial arts in the world are also varied. Different [Rebirth Physiques] paired with different martial arts result in ineffable effects."

"The Madam said there is a Rebirth Physique called [Boneless Physique]. After manifestation, the person’s bones soften as if they have none. All previous martial arts become useless, and they can barely even walk. Naturally, it is the trashiest of the trash."

"But if one practices the 'Snake Movement Art,' the trait of having no bones becomes an advantage, making them exceptionally powerful!"

"Thus, among [Rebirth Physiques], the distinction of strength... is naturally hard to say."

"The Madam also said that even if one has a decent Rebirth Physique, one must not be arrogant. Warriors should always prioritize martial arts. However... if one has a Rebirth Physique, one can selectively practice martial arts that suit the physique’s traits."

"No matter what... practice martial arts! Practice martial arts! This is the ultimate source of strength! A warrior who has consumed essence but lacks refined martial arts cannot be called a strong one. I have found a slight path now; I must grasp it firmly!"

During the stroll, Li Xian boldly asked for advice, and the Madam was not stingy. She imparted knowledge from east and west, scattered here and there. She even shared some Jianghu anecdotes. Li Xian pieced them together to get a general picture.

Thinking of this, his tired mind and body were filled with fighting spirit.

[Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword]
[Mastery: 1855/3000 (Proficient)]

Li Xian held a long sword and began to dance in the courtyard. As his mastery accumulated, he felt the swordplay more deeply. He dared to assert that when he executed the Setting Sun Withered Blood Sword alone, its power was less than one-tenth of its full potential. But even so, it was far superior to the "Green Silk Palm."

The Zhou Clan Medicine Firm is a powerhouse in the Red Wood Prefecture. Located in a remote area, backed by the Great Medicine Mountain Range, they make a fortune from the medicine trade.

"Madam, is this entire city owned by the Zhou Clan Medicine Firm?"

The next morning, early.

The carriage left the Manor of Blessing and traveled southeast for about 180 li. They saw a towering city gate... On the city head, the characters "Zhou City" were written with flamboyant calligraphy.

Considering the Zhou Clan Medicine Firm was named "Zhou," and this city was also named "Zhou," Li Xian couldn't help but show a look of shock. Is the Zhou Clan Medicine Firm really so powerful that they can build a city on their own land?

"Indeed," Madam Wen nodded.

"Zhou City is located outside the path leading to the Ten Thousand Medicine Mountains. Besides the main Zhou family, most of the residents are medicine slaves who have changed their surnames to join the Zhou family. Farmers till the land; medicine slaves till the mountains."

"The Ten Thousand Medicine Mountains... the medicine is inexhaustible. Medicine slaves go deep into the mountains to gather herbs, sell them to the main family to earn money, or pay taxes and sell them on their own. This medicine firm has continued for hundreds of years, and its operational system is very mature," Madam Wen said淡淡ly.

Li Xian clicked his tongue. A medicine firm reaching this scale is truly a "colossus."

The carriage passed the inspection smoothly and entered the city. The city was bustling, with medicine businesses lining the streets. A strong scent of herbs filled the air.

Li Xian’s mind was active; he could see more. He seemed to see a colossus operating layer by layer... every medicine slave was a component.

There was a designated place in the city for carriages to park. Madam Wen got out and walked, slowly continuing, "Such a medicine firm, operating at this scale, is naturally powerful. But it is not as easy as you might think. To maintain the operation of the medicine firm, one must balance the interests of all parties: external enemies, unfavorable weather, unsalable medicinal products, and various other problems. Moreover, it requires a large number of warrior attendants and guest elders to stand guard. Almost every day, cauldrons must be boiled; the expenses in this process are also huge."

Li Xian understood; there is no business in this world that guarantees profit without risk.

Looking down the main road, they could see the mountains rising in the distance. The Ten Thousand Medicine Mountains were magnificent and beautiful.

"Madam, for a medicine firm like this, how does it rank within the Great Wu Dynasty?" Li Xian asked curiously.

"You," Madam Wen glanced at him, helpless. "In the future, ask such questions in private. Don't ask them in public; it shows a lack of knowledge. The Great Wu Dynasty covers a vast area; it is immeasurably vast. The Zhou Clan Medicine Firm, at this scale, can be considered among the top in the dynasty. But to say how powerful it is... it's hard to say, because there are certainly larger medicine firms."

Li Xian clicked his tongue. In his view, building a city on one's own land was already unimaginable. There were actually even larger medicine firms.

"We have arrived."

Madam Wen stopped in front of a pavilion. The pavilion was nine zhang high... The plaque read: "Nine Zhang Money Pavilion."

All things in the world are inseparable from the word "money."
