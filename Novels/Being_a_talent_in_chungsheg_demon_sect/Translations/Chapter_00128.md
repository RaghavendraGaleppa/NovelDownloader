# Chapter 128: Ten Thousand Chariots Guiding the Dragon, Soaring to Ascension!

"Hiss… hiss…"

Within the Minor Realm, in a deeply hidden underground lair, a dark, insectoid monster, no larger than a grain of rice, lay prone on the ground, hissing.

"Mother… did we lose?"

"Why?"

The Qi-devouring Worm King's spiritual consciousness violently trembled, communicating with the Heavenly Mandate imposed upon it, sensing the despair emanating from this world.

Yet, it couldn't comprehend.

True, that tribulation fire was formidable, exceptionally so, but the Qi-devouring Worm King believed such an attack could absolutely not be unleashed continuously by the opponent.

So there was no need to fear. As long as this world, its Mother, continued to support and nourish it, allowing it to grow, then in due time, even when facing that terrifying tribulation fire again, it was confident it could devour it completely. No, it was far from losing…

"Hiss! Hiss!"

The next second, urged by the Worm King's will, the Qi-devouring worm swarm, which had fallen into silence, sprang into action once more, flying towards the Saint Sect disciples.

It wanted to continue the attack!

However, through the eyes of its kin, the Worm King noticed that those people were no longer resisting. Instead, they gazed at it with mocking expressions.

Why?

Before this question could dissipate from the Qi-devouring Worm King's mind, it discovered that it had lost contact with itself and its entire swarm of Qi-devouring offspring.

It was just for a split second.

Like some sort of heavenly punishment, without reason or warning, one moment the Qi-devouring worms were hissing, the next they lost their lives and fell to the ground.

Only at this moment did the Qi-devouring Worm King truly understand what the despair emanating from its Mother was. And through the "Heavenly Mandate" imposed upon it, its consciousness infinitely ascended, finally transcending this world and seeing the true scene beyond it.

In an instant, its consciousness almost froze.

It saw its Mother, the Minor Realm it had believed possessed infinite power, being effortlessly held in the palm of an indescribable giant.

"An interesting variant."

True Monarch Clear Frost Feixue looked at the small worm in her palm and chuckled softly.

"Keep it."

The next moment, carrying an indescribable shock, fear, and reverence, like a frog at the bottom of a well finally seeing the sky, its consciousness plunged into darkness.

At the same time, within the Minor Realm, a heavy rain began to fall.

Raindrops pattered down.

To the Qi-devouring worms, this rain was deadly poison. All who were touched by it were, without exception, shattered into dust, losing their forms.

However, for the recently victorious Saint Sect disciples, this downpour was like a timely rain after a long drought. The rain was filled with immense vitality, boosting their spiritual energy and regenerating their severed limbs. As long as they still had a breath left, they rapidly recovered to their peak condition under the influence of this great rain!

But beyond that, what excited them even more was the change in the heavens and earth.

"It's starting!"

Chongming executed a carp-like sit-up, shaking off Xu Xin while revealing an excited expression. "The heavens and earth are changing! This Minor Realm is being integrated into the world by the True Monarch!"

This was the final step of the Path-Seizing War!

The True Monarch of the victorious side would take the Minor Realm that served as the battlefield, incorporate it into the sphere of influence of their Dao Attainment, and then anchor it into another region.

In this way, the True Monarch's Dao Attainment influence would expand.

During this process, the heavens and earth would experience a certain degree of impact, and the previously unattainable "Foundation Establishment Realm" would also show some signs of loosening.

This was the best time to raise one's cultivation status.

It was like climbing a mountain; ordinarily, scaling dangerous peaks was extremely difficult, but at this moment, one could take a cable car, directly bypassing numerous obstacles!

Therefore, Saint Sect's true disciples, as long as they aspired to Foundation Establishment, would go to the Path-Seizing battlefield, risking their lives for a smooth road to heaven. Because if you could survive, even without cultivating great divine abilities, without rare Foundation Establishment treasures, and without third-grade true qi, you still had hope of achieving Foundation Establishment!

At this moment, all Saint Sect disciples closed their eyes and cultivated.

However, even true disciples like Qin Tianhe were still quite far from Foundation Establishment, with their highest chances not even reaching fifty percent, making a direct breakthrough impossible.

Therefore, they were only trying their best to elevate their cultivation status, preparing for true Foundation Establishment.

Yet, at this moment—

"Hmm?"

"Someone… who?"

"In that direction…"

Unanimously, all Saint Sect true disciples who possessed a certain cultivation status looked up, as if sensing something, towards the sky.

They weren't looking at the firmament, but at the Foundation Establishment Realm.

Before that realm, hidden in the Grand Void and shrouded in obscurity, a realm that was unattainable for Qi Refinement cultivators, a tall, slender figure suddenly appeared.

His victory in the Path-Seizing War had already completed his last deficiency.

Now, his chances of breaking through to Foundation Establishment were a perfect ten out of ten!

"In the blink of an eye, it's already the eighth life…"

Lu Yang's expression was filled with emotion. Eight lifetimes of cultivation, from a once impetuous youth to a true disciple of the Saint Sect today, it had taken him eight lives to finally achieve a small measure of success.

He recalled how, in the past, he had truly exhausted all means and stratagems to reach the Foundation Establishment Realm. Yet now, he didn't even have to climb; merely manifesting his soul, he naturally stood at the threshold of the Foundation Establishment Realm by virtue of his cultivation status, able to step in with a single stride.

However, this final step made Lu Yang fall into deep thought.

Once this step was taken, there would be no turning back.

Foundation Establishment was irrevocable. He had cultivated true qi with the Nine Transformations Dragon Art and was about to establish his Foundation with the Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon-Guiding Ascension Scripture. After this, there would be no road back.

Foundation Establishment, Foundation Establishment, what was established was the Dao Foundation.

Once the Dao Foundation was set, his future path would also be limited, making it impossible to change freely, and numerous related karmic ties would inevitably seek him out.

At that time, even a slight mishap could result in his soul being scattered.

Was he capable of handling it?

Especially since the Ten Thousand Chariots Dragon-Guiding Ascension Scripture was deeply connected to the Jiangxi Pure Land, with profound karmic ties. Even if the Dragon Subduing Arhat was dealt with, there might still be hidden tribulations.

At this moment, Lu Yang was unprecedentedly hesitant.

Until he saw the Hundred Lives Book beside him.

"No, I have a cheat!"

Even if there were myriad difficulties and dangers on the path, and for others, one wrong step meant eternal damnation, for him, it was merely starting over!

Thinking of this, Lu Yang's mind instantly cleared, and he no longer hesitated.

He took a step forward!

Boom!

As Lu Yang stepped into the Foundation Establishment Realm, he shook his body, and with a thunderous sound, a towering, mountain-like golden auspicious cloud majestically ascended with him at its center!

This auspicious cloud was boundless, and as its qi ascended, it continuously evolved into scenes of flowers, birds, fish, insects, mountains, lakes, rivers, and even the sun, moon, and stars—all phenomena of heaven and earth. And when this auspicious cloud bore Lu Yang's soul, it was like a magnificent carriage, opulent and dignified to the extreme.

"Roar—!"

With a dragon's roar, a phantom True Dragon appeared within the auspicious cloud, five-clawed and roaring majestically, supporting the auspicious clouds and radiating shimmering light, guarding Lu Yang's soul and heart.

Compared to the difficulties of the past, this breakthrough was simply effortless, like water flowing into a channel.

The next second, Lu Yang's figure had returned to the present world. An auspicious cloud hovered above his head, inhaling and exhaling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth—it was the manifestation of his Dao Foundation.

"Sizzle… sizzle…"

A light drizzle fell. Lu Yang stood silently in place, his already handsome face becoming even more refined and jade-boned at this moment, a hint of dignified grace appearing in his gaze.

Behind his head, the auspicious cloud surged, a True Dragon coiling within it, stirring up rings of seven-colored halos. This was not something he intentionally displayed with his magic power, but a natural phenomenon generated by heaven and earth, as if even this world rejoiced in his breakthrough and reflected his glory!

At the same time, in Jiangxi, the Shenle Pure Land.

As Lu Yang established his Foundation, a point of golden light seemed to emerge within the Pure Land, on the verge of manifesting, but it flickered and vanished in an instant, returning to nothingness.

On the Extreme Heaven Cliff of Jade Pivot Sword Pavilion.

A handsome youth in a Daoist robe, with a sword resting on his lap, suddenly looked up, a surprised expression on his face. "Ten Thousand Chariots Guiding the Dragon, Soaring to Ascension, but not a Buddhist cultivator?"

The youth calculated with his fingers, then chuckled with interest.

"That Dao Attainment has been treasured in the Pure Land for many years, yet no one could attain it. Now, the one with the most hope of establishing that Dao Foundation, an innately perfected cultivator, is surprisingly not a Buddhist cultivator."

"This is interesting!"
