# Chapter 390: Slay All

The remnant soul of the Divine Martial True Lord let out a despairing wail.

He watched helplessly as the secret he had guarded for three thousand years was unraveled thread by thread. The scriptures, encrypted with his own life essence blood, were being deciphered layer by layer by the chaotic golden light.

What terrified him most was that Xu Yunfan’s True Self Divine Manifestation had already begun to construct the rudiments of a Divine Martial Dao Foundation within his sea of consciousness according to the records of the scriptures!

“No! That is mine! My opportunity...”

“Scatter.”

The True Self Divine Manifestation formed by Xu Yunfan lightly flicked a finger.

The final remnant soul of the Divine Martial True Lord shattered like colored glass, turning into countless streams of light that were devoured by the chaotic vortex. The purest wisp of foundation-building origin among them was guided by the manifestation into the place three inches below Xu Yunfan’s navel where flesh and blood intersect.

Outside, Xu Yunfan’s eyes snapped open.

Golden light flared three inches within his pupils, and golden mist spewed forth from his pores, stirred by the Ten Extremes True Qi.

The Martial Dao Xuan Crystal trembled and hummed, seemingly possessing a spirit as it broke free from the flesh and blood, suddenly leaving the body to hover above the crown of his head.

The crystal core melted and collapsed in the void, transforming into a chaotic, dense swirl of qi. Like a nebula, it descended, shedding nine layers of light curtains.

With every curtain brushing past his skin, the sound of gold and jade striking each other erupted from Xu Yunfan’s body.

The Glass Bone Physique, which had already reached the ultimate limit of the human body, underwent another transformation. Strange patterns appeared within the jade-colored marrow, and the steaming blood energy condensed into red-gold Gangsha outside his pores.

At this moment, he resembled an ancient ferocious beast that had broken the shackles of heaven and earth. Every breath caused resonance with the earth’s veins, and even the surrounding light twisted and collapsed around this continuously sublimating body.

“So that’s it.”

Xu Yunfan’s expression was neither joyous nor sorrowful. He felt no emotional fluctuation from obtaining the True Martial Devouring Demon Scripture; his voice carried the unique emptiness of the Supreme Dao’s disregard for emotion.

“The Divine Martial Dao Foundation requires the ultimate limit of the Martial Dao as the guide, the Xuanhuang Qi as the furnace, and the Martial Dao Xuan Crystal as the supplement...”

Immediately after, he formed a hand seal to cancel the ‘Lin’ character state. The feeling of the Supreme Dao’s disregard for emotion receded like the ebb tide.

The majestic True Self Divine Manifestation within his skull gradually collapsed, turning into a wisp of clear light that sank into the depths of his sea of consciousness.

In a daze, it seemed as though thousands of silk threads were being pulled away from the void. The deprived joys, angers, sorrows, and joys flowed back slowly from his four limbs and hundred bones, like a spring stream thawing.

He subconsciously pressed his hand to his chest; beneath his fingertips came the long-lost heartbeat.

The tremor of human nature refilling his flesh and blood was like a newborn infant opening its eyes for the first time, reacquainting itself with this mundane world stripped of its divine filter.

Although the ‘Lin’ character Art was still in the minor accomplishment stage, Xu Yunfan’s cultivation had already reached an inconceivable realm at this moment, and the mental consumption required to maintain the ‘Lin’ character state was nearly negligible.

However, a deep worry was etched between his eyebrows.

If he were to immerse himself in this state for a long time, the seven emotions would gradually vanish, and the six desires would dry up. He would eventually become like a clay statue in a temple, possessing a human form but having lost human nature.

If this continued, he could clearly see a future moment where his True Self completely devoured his mortal heart. By then, even with the ability to move mountains and fill seas, he would be nothing more than an empty shell walking the heavens and earth.

“Supreme Dao’s disregard for emotion...”

A trace of worry flashed in Xu Yunfan’s eyes. “If I truly become a stone without emotion or desire, what difference is there from a mountain rock that hasn’t moved for a thousand years?”

He calmed himself for a long time, waiting for his emotions to return to his mind along with his formidable body. As the mountain wind brushed past his temples, a few strands of hair fell onto his forehead, adding a touch of vitality to this face that still bore the color of gold and jade.

Just as Xu Yunfan was preparing to sink his mind into comprehending the mysteries of the *True Martial Devouring Demon Scripture*, a sharp tearing sound suddenly reached his ears.

Looking up, he saw several streaks of blood-colored light falling from the sky like meteors, carrying a foul wind as they crashed down with a bang.

The leader was that scar-faced disciple of the Yuan Demon Sect. The centipede-like scar on his left cheek glowed with a strange purple light as his true energy surged.

No sooner had this person landed than the soles of his boots exploded with spiderweb-like cracks. However, upon seeing the situation in the field, he suddenly froze.

Above the scorched earth shrouded in blood mist, Xu Yunfan stood with his hands behind his back, the hem of his robe still carrying the lingering majestic true qi.

But of the Divine Martial True Lord, there was no sign, not even a trace of aura.

The scar-faced man’s pupils constricted violently, the sound of him swallowing audible as his Adam’s apple bobbed.

The four fellow sect members behind him were even paler, secretly feeling that things were bad. If only Xu Yunfan remained on the scene, then what of the Divine Martial True Lord?

Had that Foundation Establishment True Lord possessed him?

The scar-faced man swallowed a mouthful of saliva and forced himself to say, “Xu Tian of the Weichen Peak of the Primordial Origin Sect greets the Divine Martial True Lord. We are here to offer tribute to the True Lord’s return!”

Hearing Xu Tian’s probing words, the corner of Xu Yunfan’s mouth curled up slightly. He lightly stroked the dragon scale armor leaves on his sleeve, the sound of metal friction particularly harsh in the dead silence: “Are you looking for that Foundation Establishment senior? I’m afraid I have to disappoint you.”

He suddenly raised his foot and crushed a bone shard glowing with phosphorescent fire on the ground. “He was making a racket here just a moment ago, but now...”

Before he could finish speaking, the scar-faced man suddenly retreated ten zhangs. The twelve skull magic treasures at his waist exploded simultaneously, turning into a thick blood curtain to protect his body. His movement was so fast that it left three afterimages behind him.

“Running? You want to leave as soon as you arrive? Did you ask me?”

A cold light flashed in Xu Yunfan’s eyes. As his right palm gripped the air, the Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer drawn from the Void Pouch emitted a dragon-like tremor. The dark golden patterns on the hammer handle lit up one after another, and the power of the earth’s veins poured into the hammer body like a tide, condensing the shadow of a mountain peak at the hammer head.

“Suppress!”

With a single shout, the heavy hammer had already turned into a red-gold meteor, smashing towards the leftmost disciple of the Yuan Demon Sect.

That person had just offered a玄 iron shield, but the moment the hammer touched the shield’s surface, the shield twisted and exploded like thin paper. The unstoppable hammer force penetrated the chest cavity, turning his five viscera and six bowels into a mist of blood. Through the exploded blood hole in his back, fragments of the shattered spine could even be seen.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan secretly sighed. The force of this blow was full. If the grade of this heavy hammer had been one level higher, the opponent would have turned into powder upon contact. Even a small mountain peak would have been blasted into earth and ash.

The second disciple, seeing this, hurriedly formed a hand seal, and seventy-two small swords flew out from his sleeves to form a sword array.

Seeing this, Xu Yunfan immediately formed his left hand into a sword finger. The Ten Extremes True Qi condensed at his fingertips into a three-foot green edge. With a sweep of the Sea Scorching Sword Qi from the Pure Yang Three Forms, the sword array was shredded into pieces before it could even get close. The aftermath of the sword intent swept past the neck, and the head flew up, the expression of terror still frozen on the face.

The third disciple turned around to flee but suddenly felt a chill in his heart.

Xu Yunfan had already drawn the Piercing Sky and Breaking Cloud Bow at some unknown time. The lingering tremor of the bowstring had not yet dissipated when the arrow formed by true qi had already pierced through the opponent’s Dantian. The赤 flame attached to the arrow body instantly ignited the true essence, and the whole person turned into a torch, turning into charcoal amidst a scream.

The last female cultivator screamed as she crushed a传送 talisman. Just as the spatial ripples began to form, Xu Yunfan’s Shaking Mountain Hammer had already smashed into a certain spot in the void. The mountain patterns on the hammer head shone brightly, and the power of the earth’s veins forcibly disturbed the area within a radius of ten zhangs.

The female cultivator’s lower body had already entered the传送, but she was forcibly “stuck” in the spatial rift. Her lower half was twisted into肉泥 by the chaotic spatial forces.

All this happened in the blink of an eye. In the field, only the scar-faced man Xu Tian remained, standing dumbfounded.

The blood mist that had exploded at his waist had not yet dissipated; the twelve protective skull magic treasures had all been scrapped.
