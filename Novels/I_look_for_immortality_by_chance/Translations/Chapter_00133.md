# Chapter 133: Flattery and Provocation – The Su Family's Scheme (Combined)

Yin Xingchao had just finished declaring it was all a demonic plot and that they wouldn't engage further, yet now he was asking if anyone dared to leave the ship and fight—a blatant contradiction that left the disciples puzzled.

Noticing their confusion, Yin Xingchao smiled faintly and flicked his sleeve, producing another spiritual artifact. 

It was a green, mung-bean-sized object, about the size of a longan fruit, floating midair as if eager to take form. 

"This is the Green Yi Spirit Bean," he explained. "It can transform to replace someone in guarding the ship—a gift from the Dao Academy specifically for this campaign."

With another wave of his sleeve, a black gourd appeared, pulsing with a sinister aura. 

"This is the 'Earth Fiend Gourd,' filled with earth-fiend energy, perfect for corrupting spiritual mechanisms and weakening formations."

"The demons are provoking us to delay our siege. The more they do so, the more we must defy their expectations."

"If any brave soul takes this gourd beyond the ship to release its poison and erode their Earth Fiend Heavenly Water Formation, the demons will have no choice but to emerge and fight, allowing us to avenge Junior Brother Ji."

"I had hoped not to resort to such measures, but these demons are obstinate. There's no need for courtesy anymore!"

Clearly displeased that a Foundation Establishment cultivator had been slain under his watch, shaking morale, Yin Xingchao now brandished these treasures, scanning the crowd intently.

"I volunteer to avenge Junior Brother Ji!" Su Jingming declared, rising to his feet.

"Excellent!" Yin Xingchao nodded approvingly. "Remember, though demons are mostly scaled and armored creatures, some possess innate peculiarities and strange abilities. Be cautious. If overwhelmed, retreat immediately—I'll cover you with the ship's power."

"Just slay the demon and return. No need to linger."

Seeing Su Jingming's confidence, Yin Xingchao handed him the Earth Fiend Gourd but cautioned him once more. Another defeat would devastate their morale and hinder their campaign.

"These mere beasts are no match for the Dao Academy's true methods. Rest assured, Senior Brother, I will slay this wretch!" Su Jingming bowed, then clasped the gourd tightly and shot out of the ship like a streak of light.

The disciples extended their spiritual senses, watching as Su Jingming emerged outside.

---

*Whoosh!*

Without hesitation, Su Jingming tossed the Earth Fiend Gourd above him. Black miasma surged forth like a tide, writhing like a swarm of locusts as it descended upon the river's formation below.

*Hiss—*

The corrosive energy gnawed at the Earth Fiend Heavenly Water Formation, dimming its glow ever so slightly. Though the effect was minor, the relentless erosion, combined with the ship's assault under Yin Xingchao's command, steadily weakened the formation. At this rate, it would be completely dismantled in seven days instead of half a month.

The demons could no longer remain idle. A towering figure emerged from the roiling demonic aura—the same silver-horned giant who had slain Ji Fenghua—glaring furiously at Su Jingming.

"Pah! You call yourselves righteous cultivators, yet resort to such underhanded tactics?" the giant spat. "This earth-fiend poison will taint the land for a hundred years! Shameless!"

"Against beasts who know no human decency, why bother with honor?" Su Jingming retorted. "If you dare, come take my head and shatter this gourd!"

"You won't return alive!" The silver-horned giant roared, swinging his massive axe in a devastating arc.

The strike carried mountain-splitting force, but Su Jingming stood his ground. His eyes gleamed with green light as his spiritual sense coalesced into a colossal vine, lashing toward the giant's mind like a whip.

Yet the giant merely sneered and let out a deafening roar. The soundwave clashed with the spiritual assault, not only neutralizing it but momentarily stunning Su Jingming.

"Die!" The giant leaped, his axe cleaving "Su Jingming" in two—only for the figure to dissolve into sawdust.

From a distance, Su Jingming reappeared, unharmed but pale.

The giant charged again, but Su Jingming flicked his sleeve, releasing four green beans that swelled into towering armored guardians. Though the giant shattered them effortlessly, Su Jingming restored them with a surge of green energy, trapping the demon in an endless cycle of destruction and regeneration.

"Bind!" Su Jingming intoned, and a green seal shot from his dantian, forming massive hands that clamped around the giant.

Forced to reveal his true form—a silver rhinoceros—the demon struggled futilely. Seizing the moment, Su Jingming unleashed a green flame that reduced the beast to ashes.

"Senior Brother, mission accomplished!" Su Jingming returned triumphantly, presenting the gourd.

"Excellent!" Yin Xingchao nodded, and the disciples' spirits lifted. Their honor had been restored.

But then another challenge rang out. A golden-eyed, silver-tailed ape stood atop the clouds, sneering at the ship. 

"Fighting with superior artifacts is no feat. Face me in a true duel!"

Yin Xingchao dismissed the taunt. "Ignore it. Focus on dismantling the formation. Once it falls, we'll deal with them one by one."

Yet the ape wasn't done. It produced a fire and tools, then unveiled a mutilated corpse—Ji Fenghua's remains.

The disciples erupted in fury. 

"Despicable!"

"Animals! How dare you!"

Su Jingming checked the rhinoceros demon's storage pouch—the body was indeed missing. 

"Damn them!" he seethed.

"Human flesh at the Foundation Establishment level... A first for me," the ape mused, tauntingly brandishing a knife.

"Who will retrieve Junior Brother Ji's body?" Yin Xingchao asked gravely. 

All eyes turned to Su Jingming.

"Filthy beast, I'll face you!" Su Jingming declared, gripping a mirror at his waist as he flew out.

---

The ape ignored him until the last moment, then suddenly opened its eyes—golden flames blazing. 

A searing light lanced into Su Jingming's mind, paralyzing him as the ape's staff descended. 

A green phoenix erupted from Su Jingming's mirror, barely deflecting the blow, but the ape countered with a golden orb that stalled the artifact. 

The staff struck, but Su Jingming substituted himself with a wooden effigy at the last second. 

The ape pursued relentlessly until the phoenix dragged Su Jingming back to the ship, his eyes scorched and ruined.

The mood aboard darkened. Even Su Jingming, with his superior artifacts, had been bested. Who could possibly defeat this ape?

"Perhaps we should wait until the formation falls," Yin Xingchao sighed.

But then a Su clansman stood. "There is one among us who can—Senior Brother Gu Yuan. At the Flowing Clouds Banquet, he seized nine spiritual energies single-handedly. Even four of us together couldn't defeat him. If anyone can slay this ape, it's him."

The disciples turned to Gu Yuan, their expressions complex.

"Senior Brother Gu, we implore you!" the Su clansman bowed deeply.
