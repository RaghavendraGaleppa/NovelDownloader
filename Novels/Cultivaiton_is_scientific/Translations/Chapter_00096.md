# Chapter 96: Recognition

Li Shiming's brain utilized the computational power of IBMz15, and he was astonished to discover how unimaginably advantageous IBMz15 was in the field of formation arrays.

Establishing a formation array required considering numerous factors. 

A typical novice formation master could only use pre-refined array flags, placing them according to the terrain's layout to achieve spiritual energy circulation. Only experienced intermediate formation masters could design disk-based formation arrays without relying on array flags.

This didn't mean disk-based formations were more powerful—rather, they were simply more portable. For example, a sect's mountain-protecting grand array wasn't disk-based but utilized precious materials for array flags supplemented by rare spiritual artifacts.

Li Shiming's design on paper had already surpassed the level of a novice formation master. Though it was merely a blueprint and not an actual creation, for formation masters, design was more important than production. Design required mental effort, while production involved more manual skills.

He mobilized vast amounts of formation knowledge, with IBMz15 solving the most significant computational challenges. This allowed him to freely test ideas in his mind and quickly analyze their feasibility. What ended up on paper were designs already verified through IBMz15's calculations.

At first, Yin Shilan watched with appreciation, recognizing Li Shiming's rapid application of formation inheritance in practical design and acknowledging him as a formation genius like herself. But as time passed, her expression shifted from admiration to astonishment.

Li Shiming's initial designs appeared naive, yet they contained flashes of brilliance. Some aspects even intrigued Yin Shilan, a newly advanced intermediate formation master. Most strikingly, his computational speed was astounding—while she was still pondering, he had already written down solutions.

"Could this part be designed like this?" Yin Shilan's passion for formations turned her from an observer to a collaborator. Her slender, jade-white finger tapped a spot on the paper as she drew a symbol.

"Exactly! This design could improve the formation's efficiency by ten percent!" Li Shiming, his mind fully synchronized with IBMz15, immediately agreed.

The two continued refining the design—Yin Shilan offering suggestions, Li Shiming sometimes agreeing, other times rebutting. They became so engrossed that they forgot about the flying boat, which had long since arrived at Eagle Beak Island and hovered over the sea outside.

Time passed unnoticed as they perfected the turtle-shell design on paper, creating a unique formation array. 

The Spirit Turtle Shield was a mid-grade defensive artifact. With their designed formation, its defensive capabilities could be elevated to high-grade, even gaining a flash mode capable of emitting a dazzling burst of light. This flash could disorient attackers momentarily.

Of course, transforming the Spirit Turtle Shield into a formation array would require rare materials—something Li Shiming couldn't afford anytime soon. 

The most remarkable aspect of his design was that the formation could remain effective while moving—but only under his control. If Yin Shilan operated it, movement might be possible, but not with the same flexibility. 

This hinged on computational power. Li Shiming had employed several mathematical formulas to simplify what would otherwise be extremely complex calculations. 

Why were formations typically immobile once deployed? Because whether using array flags or disks, they required pre-calculated environmental analysis. Disk-based formations contained built-in environmental assessments, allowing quick deployment in moderately complex settings. 

But once established, the environment couldn't change—otherwise, pre-calculated data would become invalid, causing the formation to collapse. Li Shiming's design introduced new mathematical formulas that reduced computational complexity, pioneering a fresh approach to mobile formations.

Yin Shilan's eyes sparkled with admiration. Not even her formation mentor had inspired such reverence in her. This was the birth of a new school of formation theory.

"Alright, we'll materialize this formation when the opportunity arises," Li Shiming said, stretching lazily. 

His arm accidentally brushed against Yin Shilan beside him, and he quickly withdrew it. Only then did they realize how close they had been—their heads nearly touching, barely a fist's width apart. 

Yin Shilan's figure blurred momentarily before reappearing in her original position. 

"The flying boat has stopped," Li Shiming said hurriedly, catching a whiff of orchid-like fragrance and feeling a flutter of nervousness. 

"Take out your identity jade slip. You can contact me through it if you have any formation-related questions. I might also seek your advice in the future," Yin Shilan said, smoothing a stray lock of hair to mask her shyness.

Having received so much help from her, Li Shiming naturally agreed. He retrieved his identity jade slip without hesitation.
