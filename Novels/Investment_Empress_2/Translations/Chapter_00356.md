# Chapter 356: The Ice Cube Isn't Acting

Not long after Ying Bing and Li Mo left Qingmu City.

In a private room on the second floor of a tavern, a group of Demon Cultists were gathered for breakfast. Since there were too many of them to fit on the first floor, they had ordered their dishes and come back up.

Luo Yexian sat in the main seat, waiting for the waiter to serve the food.

Just then, he suddenly felt something burning in his pocket—it was his token.

As a Demon Cult, the Summoning Demon Cult naturally had its own methods of communication, and the token was one of them. Ordinary members could use their spiritual will to transmit messages on the token.

The Hall Master's was even more advanced, an ancient relic capable of projection.

*Hum—*

*Hum—*

"Quiet, everyone. It's the Holy Son."

Luo Yexian gestured for his subordinates to keep silent before connecting the token. Instantly, a beam of light formed an image.

"Greetings, Holy Son."

The figure on the other side of the light screen was unstable and distorted, making it look somewhat eerie.

This Summoning Demon Holy Son had once topped the Hidden Dragon Rankings but was later defeated by the Crown Prince of the Great Yu Dynasty. His dragon form was shattered, and he was reduced to a state where he could only compete with the Walking of the Heavenly Secrets Sect for a spot in the top three.

Since then, his temperament had become increasingly unpredictable.

"I told you to investigate the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect. Why has there been no news for so long?"

The Summoning Demon Holy Son's voice was low and deep.

Hearing that the Holy Son was not in a good mood, Luo Yexian stood up straight.

"You said not to disturb you until there was a result. Wasn't that your instruction?"

"..."

The Holy Son's phantom flickered twice.

"Why can't you be flexible?"

"You said last time that we were clumsy and had a narrow view, and that we should never act on our own initiative or do something superfluous. We must wait for your wise instructions."

Luo Yexian spoke smoothly.

"But I also said that in urgent situations, you have the authority to make your own decisions."

"But you didn't say last time whether this situation counts as urgent."

"If I didn't say it, does that mean you don't know how to ask?!"

The Summoning Demon Holy Son's tone was grating.

Luo Yexian replied with perfect reason: "But you said not to disturb your cultivation until there was a result..."

He acted very prudently, following the rules and procedures the Holy Son had laid out.

"You..."

The phantom trembled violently.

Perhaps the Summoning Demon Holy Son wanted to curse him out, but considering that Luo Yexian was his brother-in-law, certain words might hurt the enemy but damage himself even more...

Why didn't he realize how difficult communication was before?

Oh, in the past, although the Hundred Beasts Hall had a Hall Master, it was just a title. Most of the affairs in the Southern Frontier were handled by Han Zhen. But now Han Zhen was dead, causing the average IQ of the Hundred Beasts Hall to plummet...

If Luo Yexian weren't his brother-in-law, he would have already used the cult's rules on him!

"Forget it, what have you done so far?"

"Reporting to the Holy Son, we have tracked them to Qingmu City and are waiting for an opportunity. As soon as they leave the city, we will be able to find them immediately!"

Luo Yexian said in a deep voice, finally saying something reliable.

The unstable phantom of the Summoning Demon Holy Son stabilized a bit. This so-called Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect was most likely a fabrication, but what if it wasn't?

The tip of the iceberg revealed by the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect was too terrifying.

Even a one in ten thousand possibility was enough for him to be cautious.

"So they are in Qingmu City?"

"That's correct."

The Summoning Demon Holy Son took a deep breath. He couldn't get away for the moment and was afraid Luo Yexian would mess things up, so he emphasized again:

"Find them, and试探 them first. Even if you confirm it's fake, you must report to me on how to handle it. Report everything to me if any situation arises!"

"Yes!"

The phantom disappeared.

Shortly after, the dishes were served. The Summoning Demon Cultists took out a few sets of mahjong and started playing. Since they couldn't do anything else, they could only pass the time this way.

Suddenly, the buck-toothed priest widened his eyes:

"Full flush! I have a full flush and seven pairs! Pay up, pay up!"

---

But not long after, the middle-aged priest suddenly came back from outside and shouted:

"Hall Master, they've left the city!"

"Alright, set off immediately."

Luo Yexian stood up abruptly, flipping the mahjong table over in the process.

"But I had a full flush..."

"When there's a major task at hand, how can we lose ourselves in idle pursuits? Can't you tell what's important and what's not?"

"???"

In any case, the group of Demon Cultists set off grandly. They boarded a Level 6 Disaster Beast and flew into the sky.

During the journey, the skinny middle-aged priest continuously monitored the direction of the Power of All Living Beings.

After a while, he spoke again:

"Hall Master, the convergence of the Power of All Living Beings is right ahead."

"Oh? They've stopped?"

Luo Yexian narrowed his eyes.

Ahead was a lush, sprawling peach blossom forest. A green stream, like a jade belt, flowed slowly, leading to an unknown destination.

Peach blossom petals fell onto the stream, creating a beautiful, serene, and dreamlike scene. It could be said to be a path leading to a fairyland.

*Woo—*

The sound of a flute seemed to flow out with the gurgling stream.

"Who?!"

Luo Yexian asked vigilantly.

The group of Demon Cultists subconsciously looked up and couldn't help but shrink their pupils.

Deep within the peach blossom forest, a small boat was slowly approaching.

At the prow of the boat stood a young woman in a dark-colored immortal dress. Her figure was ethereal and graceful, her skirt fluttering lightly as she stood playing a bamboo flute. The melody echoed softly within the forest, a tune that seemed to come from beyond the heavens, with a style completely different from any music in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, yet full of vicissitudes.

Ahem, it was indeed a different style.

If anyone in the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths had heard "The Great Fish," that would be the real ghost.

But regardless.

With such a fairy-like painting before their eyes, no one dared to act rashly.

More importantly, the young woman was too extraordinary.

Her face was veiled, revealing only a pair of dark eyebrows. Logically, it was just a thin veil, but when you looked closely, you felt her divine beauty was hidden in the clouds, impossible to see clearly.

Even if you closed your eyes, you wouldn't know there was a person standing there!

It was as if this woman did not belong to this world!

Luo Yexian's heart filled with vigilance as he asked:

"Who are you?"

"..."

Ying Bing lowered her bamboo flute, silent, looking coldly at the few of them.

This was Li Mo's instruction, to have her recall what it was like without him.

For a performance, it was essential to make a striking first impression. She didn't need to say anything.

The Ice Cube's gaze.

The oppressive aura of the Empress was at its peak!

Luo Yexian: "!"

The Summoning Demon Cultists: "!!!"

What a cold and transcendent gaze, a pair of clear eyes devoid of any emotion! It was like a deity looking down upon the mortal world!

That gaze put too much pressure on them.

It made Luo Yexian and the others sweat profusely, feeling like they were just mortals, unworthy of entering her eyes!

Even when facing the Holy Son, they had never felt such a feeling!!

Hmm...

The timing was just right.

Li Mo, who was observing from the shadows, nodded with satisfaction. The Ice Cube's performance was even better than he had imagined; it was almost too convincing.

Next time, she'd have to tone it down a bit...

The first step was complete. Li Mo stepped out from the peach blossom forest and said in a clear voice:

"Don't be in a hurry to kill them, Senior Sister. These are people from beyond our world whom I invited to visit."
