# Chapter 24: Divine Weapon Fragment

The shockwave technique targeting the internal organs was extremely effective against these body-refining warriors, whose organs were delicate despite their tough exteriors.

Xu Yunfan felt a hint of regret. If only he had a heavy hammer in his hand right now, he could have easily killed Yang Gan on the spot.

Suddenly, an idea struck Xu Yunfan. He turned and darted into the tunnel, grabbed the iron pickaxe, and quickly climbed back out, charging straight at Yang Gan.

Yang Gan gasped for breath, watching Xu Yunfan charge at him again. His eyes widened in alarm, and he hastily raised his hand, shouting, "Wait! We're both body-refining warriors. To determine a victor, at least a thousand exchanges are needed. You..."

Before he could finish, Xu Yunfan remained silent and swung the iron pickaxe down with full force. Yang Gan took a deep breath, channeling the qi and blood within his body. Instantly, his muscles bulged, and blue veins popped out all over, like blue pythons coiled and crisscrossing his body.

He said in a deep voice, "It's useless. Ordinary blades can at most leave a white mark on my body. They can't even break my skin... Ugh!!!"

Before he could finish his sentence, the iron pickaxe, embedded with fragments of the Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer, closed in instantly.

The pickaxe tip plunged into his chest as easily as a knife through soft tofu, penetrating deeply without any resistance, heading straight for his heart.

Yang Gan's eyes bulged to the extreme, filled with terror and disbelief, looking as if they might pop out of their sockets.

The excruciating pain from his heart, like thousands of steel needles stabbing him simultaneously, made every cell in his body tremble.

Instinctively, he shot his hands forward, using all his strength to desperately grip the iron pickaxe, as if trying to stop the deadly weapon from going any deeper.

"How is this possible... My body-refining physique, broken by a single swing of this pickaxe!"

Yang Gan's heart churned with shock and fury. He couldn't believe that the body-refining technique he had painstakingly cultivated for years and was so proud of could be so utterly useless.

His arm muscles swelled, and blue veins writhed like enraged snakes under his skin, frantically straining to hold back the pickaxe that was still trying to burrow deeper.

Xu Yunfan's own muscles were bulging, each one like a small hill of power. The qi and blood in his body churned like boiling magma, surging and turbulent.

As his qi and blood surged, the dimension of his muscles continuously rose, layer upon layer expanding wildly. From a distance, he looked like an inflated devil of muscular flesh, exuding a terrifying aura that struck fear into the heart.

"I already know the extent of my strength now!" Xu Yunfan's voice was low.

The martial arts advancement brought by his attribute panel, under the control of his proficiency, allowed him to master it perfectly as he progressed. It was far beyond what an ordinary martial artist of the same level could achieve.

"Wait, wait! I know what's buried under Ninggu Tower, I can share it with you! Also, I have a chest of gold and silver treasures, I can give it all to you! Wait, wait!"

Under Yang Gan's gaze, which was filled with terror to the extreme, Xu Yunfan remained silent and slowly applied force. The muscles in his arms tensed like steel, every inch of them unleashing boundless power.

The iron pickaxe, under his push, continued to sink into Yang Gan's chest inch by inch, steadily piercing through his heart.

Yang Gan's body went rigid for a moment, then the bulging muscles all over his body deflated instantly, like a punctured balloon.

His hands went limp and dropped, and his entire body, as if losing all support, slowly fell backward.

His eyes were still fixed on Xu Yunfan, the light within them gradually dimming until the last spark of life was extinguished, and he was completely silent.

Xu Yunfan exhaled and pulled the iron pickaxe out of Yang Gan's body with one hand.

He glanced at the Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer fragment embedded in the pickaxe tip and was taken aback. He truly hadn't expected that a tiny fragment could so easily break through the defense of and kill a martial artist who had perfected Skin Tempering and specialized in body-refining.

This divine weapon was truly a good thing.

With Yang Gan's death, Xu Yunfan felt an inexplicable sense of relief. Back in the mine, Yang Gan's gaze had made him extremely uncomfortable. Many times, just thinking of Yang Gan's cold, murderous gaze kept him awake at night.

Now, he could finally relax completely.

He glanced at the information in his field of vision. The prompts for the Copper Body Art's advancement were flooding his screen like a刷屏.

'Fist and foot strikes rained down on your body. You felt the qi and blood of the Copper Body Art surging within you. Copper Body Art proficiency increased.'

'The opponent's strikes were heavy. Although you were forced back step by step, you sensed the heat of the Copper Body Art flowing through your four limbs and hundred bones. Copper Body Art proficiency increased, and your physique became more resilient.'

'...'

It had added thirteen points of proficiency in a short time. If Yang Gan hadn't tried to kill him, Xu Yunfan would have wanted to keep him alive to temper his skills and farm proficiency.

Under such a high-intensity battle, the efficiency of gaining Copper Body Art proficiency was very high.

"If the Purple Gold Earth-Shattering Hammer were complete, it would be a weapon that has already stepped past the sixth rank of treasure artifact and reached the seventh rank of divine weapon," Li Haomiao said slowly as he crawled out of the large hole. He looked at the lifeless Yang Gan on the ground and sighed. "In the entire Great Zhou, divine weapons are few and far between."

Xu Yunfan swept his gaze over Fang Mushan, who was still fighting not far away. Seeing that his companion had the upper hand, he called out casually. After Fang Mushan decisively refused his offer of help, Xu Yunfan收回了他的目光.

"If divine weapons can so easily break through body-refining techniques, then what is the point of cultivating body-refining?" Xu Yunfan asked.

Li Haomiao heard this and looked into the distance, watching Fang Mushan, who was holding a long spear, moving with the weapon, his steps light as wind.

"A fine and fierce warrior. Given some time, he may well make a name for himself alongside his father in the future," he praised. Then, he said calmly, "In the past, there was an unnamed old monk at the Mituo Temple who cultivated the Mituo Golden Body Sutra. When the temple was destroyed, he walked out and withstood two divine weapons, yet his golden body remained unscathed. In these times, that was a truly astonishing feat."

"You're trying to say that whether it's a divine weapon or a martial art, it ultimately depends on the person?" Xu Yunfan asked.

Li Haomiao nodded. "Precisely."

Xu Yunfan frowned. "Why don't you just say it directly? Why beat around the bush?"

Li Haomiao was helpless and let out a long sigh. "A rotten piece of wood cannot be carved."

Xu Yunfan couldn't be bothered to say more to Li Haomiao. He just focused on感受 the power he now had after reaching the perfection of Skin Tempering with the Copper Body Art.

There was no prompt on his attribute panel indicating he couldn't advance further. This meant that once he maxed out these five thousand proficiency points, he should be able to achieve the Golden Skin phenomenon that Li Haomiao had mentioned.

Golden skin, jade veins, crimson blood, silver essence.

"If the Copper Body Art takes another step forward and reaches perfection, it should manifest the Golden Skin phenomenon, right?" Xu Yunfan asked.

Hearing this, Li Haomiao couldn't help but look at Xu Yunfan, whose qi and blood had not yet settled and whose skin still had a faint coppery luster.

"If you take the Copper Body Art to its absolute limit, you can indeed achieve it. However..." Li Haomiao shook his head. "Striving for perfection is something most True Blood experts cannot achieve; it's just a waste of time. How many geniuses in the world, in pursuit of the perfect state, have spent decades of painstaking effort only to fail? They could have climbed to higher peaks in the martial path, but ended up as nothing more than a mere martial artist. You... what are you doing?"
