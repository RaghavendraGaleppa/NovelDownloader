# Chapter 172: One Last Big Score Before Leaving

The night was dark with a waning moon hanging high, the north wind howling fiercely.

The Gongsun Clan had activated their ancestral protective formation, its dazzling light barrier soaring into the sky, the intense radiance blotting out even the starlight above.

Deep within the clan's cemetery, a solemn atmosphere prevailed as two to three hundred people stood in a circle. Leading them were three Golden Core elders. Two bore similar sharp facial features—carp-like noses, thin lips, and short beards—clearly the Gongsun Clan's patriarch and grand elder. These two were half-brothers who had been the clan's twin prodigies three hundred years ago, both eventually reaching Golden Core and becoming the pillars upholding their cultivation family's standing in the cultivation world.

The third was a dignified elder in black robes, with thick eyebrows, a high nose bridge, piercing eyes, and an imposing stature—the outer sect elder of Qianyun Pavilion, Elder Mang, who had come specifically to inspect the Gongsun Clan's teleportation array.

On the open ground ahead, after nearly two months of preparation by hundreds of Gongsun clansmen, a complex and profound octagonal array spanning an acre had been erected. Now, driven by the "Teleportation Stone" provided by Elder Mang, it faintly vibrated the surrounding space.

The air around them seemed to twist and distort, boiling like scalding water, while pebbles on the ground trembled incessantly and dust swirled upward.

Most present were unsettled, especially the Gongsun clansmen, who were filled with tension and unease. They didn't know how many righteous cultivators would come through, whether they would turn hostile immediately upon arrival, seizing the Gongsun Clan's territory, or if their numbers and strength would overwhelm the Gongsun Clan, forcing them to raise the banner of rebellion and serve as cannon fodder against the demonic path.

Elder Mang, however, was exhilarated. He had long awaited this day. After months of covert efforts in the eastern heartlands, evading the demonic path's joint enforcement teams while sowing discord, he had successfully turned dozens of eastern factions to their side. Now, personally overseeing the teleportation array's activation in the Gongsun Clan of Shangdang Commandery was the crowning achievement of his mission.

Once the righteous-demonic war concluded, this merit might earn him promotion to inner sect status, perhaps even a deputy peak lordship, granting him the right to establish his own lineage. Even if competition within Qianyun Pavilion proved too fierce, at the very least, he could secure a lucrative position as a hall master in the inner sect.

His disciples would rise alongside him, gaining access to better cultivation resources. Especially that girl Qi—her innate talent was decent, and her elder brother had once been a favored disciple of the Qingyang Peak Lord. With proper nurturing, she might catch the peak lord's eye, reminding him of her brother Qi Zhong and earning his favor by association. Elder Mang might even secure a firm foothold within Qingyang Peak.

Lost in these thoughts, Elder Mang smiled expectantly, only to realize the girl was nowhere to be seen. "That reckless girl," he muttered inwardly. "Of all nights to wander off! Her temperament still needs tempering if she hopes to impress the peak lord."

His focus returned to the final adjustments of the teleportation array—the crux of his mission, where no mistakes could be tolerated. The girl's matters would have to wait.

Little did he know, the very merit he dreamed of had already been slaughtered, and the perpetrator was now sneaking out of an underground passage.

A lone cloud drifted leisurely from the forbidden back mountains to the guest pavilion. Lin Shan, having activated the Cloud-Subduing Banner's concealment and illusion runes, emerged unscathed despite the close calls.

Even at this late hour, Gongsun disciples stood guard at every post, vigilant against any mishaps as tensions reached their peak. Fortunately, Lin Shan's Foundation Establishment cultivation paired with high-grade illusion artifacts allowed him to evade ordinary cultivators with relative ease.

The pavilion appeared dark from the outside but was brightly lit within, layered with restrictive formations by the master arrayist Black Skeleton Demon Lord to mask their activities and lull their Gongsun watchers into complacency.

When Lin Shan returned, he found his twenty-odd subordinates pacing like ants on a hot griddle.

"It's past midnight, and the boss still isn't back!"

"We're doomed! Something big must have happened outside!"

"The entire Gongsun Clan is on lockdown—we can't even step outside!"

"Have the righteous path's forces already attacked?"

Fear thrives in the unknown. Cut off from the outside world, their anxiety was understandable. But the moment their leader reappeared, their panic subsided—after all, the tallest shoulders bore the heaviest burdens.

The pavilion door creaked open, letting in a gust of icy wind as a familiar figure strode inside.

The group swarmed him with flattery and relief, their moods flipping faster than pages in a book.

"Ah, Envoy! We were just talking about you!"

"Was your cultivation session successful? You needn't rush back—we've got everything under control!"

"Your care for us is too kind! You should focus on your own advancement. We can hold out a day or two longer."

"With you here, the Gongsun Clan will surely grovel at our feet again!"

Lin Shan stowed the Cloud-Subduing Banner, brushing off their empty praises. He knew they were clueless—had he not crossed paths with the bamboo-hatted woman underground, he too might have remained oblivious, assuming the Gongsun Clan was merely hedging their bets amid the chaotic frontlines.

But her dire warnings had revealed the truth: the righteous path was launching their final assault, and the Gongsun Clan had long since turned traitor, secretly completing a teleportation array to usher in reinforcements tonight!

Who could stay idle upon learning this?

He swiftly shared everything with Black Skeleton Demon Lord. The others were merely bystanders—only the demon lord, now at mid-Foundation Establishment, could truly assist.

The skeleton showed no visible reaction, its hollow eye sockets flickering with soulfire as it seemed to probe the surroundings. After a moment, it nodded leisurely. "Makes sense. No wonder the spiritual energy here is so turbulent tonight—the teleportation array's activation must be disrupting the ambient qi for miles. That girl's dying words were truthful."

As a former Nascent Soul entity, it possessed unique insights into manipulating heaven and earth's energies. Though weakened, it could still deduce the validity of Lin Shan's intel.

"Then let's escape tonight before they react!" Lin Shan urged, seeing the perfect opportunity with the Gongsun elites preoccupied.

"Not so simple," the skeleton replied, tapping its bony fingers. "The Gongsun Clan's ancestral formation is the work of a master arrayist—no slouch compared to me. With it fully active, the backdoors I planted are mostly useless. At best, I can halt it for ten breaths."

Lin Shan hesitated. "In that time, can you—"

"Seventy percent odds," the demon lord stood, pacing. "At full strength, their formation has no weaknesses. I'd need ten breaths to exploit my backdoor, then another ten to pry open a narrow exit lasting five breaths. That's twenty-five breaths total—during which I cannot be disturbed."

"Once the formation falters, the Gongsun Clan will notice instantly. They'll send someone—likely their Golden Core elder—to stop us. You must buy me those twenty-five breaths."

Lin Shan nearly choked. "You want me to stall a Golden Core cultivator?!"

"Five breaths," the skeleton clarified. "Just five. Once out, I can temporarily repurpose their formation into a trap, buying us a quarter-hour to flee and erase our traces."

Five breaths—fifteen seconds.

A mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator stalling a Golden Core expert was tantamount to suicide. Even a casual strike from a magic treasure would obliterate him. Worse, he couldn't dodge—he'd have to stand his ground.

"Impossible! I can't last a single breath against a magic treasure!"

"Fail, and we all die," the demon lord stated gravely.

Lin Shan eyed it suspiciously. As a former Nascent Soul being, surely it had some trump card to briefly match a Golden Core cultivator? But the skeleton claimed poverty—no such capabilities in this world.

Yet it seemed oddly calm, sipping imaginary tea while its skeletal frame leaked nothing but confidence, all while subtly hinting at Lin Shan's storage bracelet.

After a prolonged silence, Lin Shan finally understood—it wanted the Void Star Disk. With the innate treasure's supreme calculation powers, the formation could likely be breached in half the time.

But Lin Shan hesitated. He trusted no one but himself. Their bond was a flimsy silver contract with no real restraints. If he lent the disk, the skeleton might well abscond with it amidst the chaos.

The Void Star Disk's value dwarfed even the Illusionary Spirit Sapling he'd once tested the skeleton with. This was a gamble he couldn't afford.

An alternative occurred to him—the disk's artifact spirit, Xiao Xin, was an array grandmaster, surpassing even Black Skeleton. Could she bypass the skeleton's involvement?

Noticing his hesitation, the demon lord coughed awkwardly. "The backdoors in their formation are my unique handiwork. Only I can activate them."

Lin Shan scoffed, watching the skeleton's theatrics with disdain.

The demon lord rambled on, dredging up past grievances to justify its request—each example only reinforcing Lin Shan's distrust. From the Stormwind Sea debacle to the underground bone artillery regiment, every "favor" had strings attached.

Their argument grew heated, old grudges resurfacing until they nearly came to blows. The skeleton, guilty and cornered, could only splutter excuses.

The onlookers watched in bewilderment, catching only fragments of cryptic references to treasures and betrayals.

Finally, Lin Shan cut through the noise. "Enough! No disk. We stick to the original plan—you break the formation, I'll buy time."

The skeleton jolted upright. "You'd face a Golden Core elder alone?!"

"Five breaths. I'll manage." Lin Shan bared his teeth in a grin that sent chills down spines. "I've got a little surprise—a one-time talisman packing the full-force strike of a late Golden Core perfection-stage expert. An area-of-effect divine ability. Detonated over the Gongsun Clan, do you think that'd buy five breaths?"

The room fell deathly silent.

A late Golden Core perfection-stage attack—comparable to the Turtle Sage in his prime, who had once fought three demonic Golden Cores to a standstill and evaded over a dozen pursuers for years. The mere thought of such power unleashed here...

The group shuddered. Their leader had been hiding this all along? With this, stalling was guaranteed—the blast might even cripple the Golden Core elder!

But at what cost? The collateral damage would be catastrophic. The Gongsun Clan would hunt them to the ends of the earth.

Yet survival came first. Lin Shan's eyes gleamed with the manic resolve of a gambler staking everything on one final throw.

The Gongsun Clan had no idea what nightmare they'd invited into their midst.
