Chapter 216: Cao Qianqiu

The sudden appearance of the old coot from the Broken Path was truly too startling, making Qin Ming stumble back three steps.

He had long had a premonition that something was amiss with the nine divine chains. Initially, he thought Li Qingxu had sealed some mysterious power that would eventually erupt. At that time, he might have to face an even stronger Li Qingxu. However, in this first realm, Qin Ming feared no challenge. He was even looking forward to it.

Who could have imagined that an old geezer would pop out in the end? This was like, on his wedding night, when he lifted the bridal veil, what appeared was a scruffy old man grinning at him. All anticipation turned into fright. Qin Ming didn't get the "complete form" of Li Qingxu; instead, he was greeted by his master, a man hated by gods and loathed by devils.

"Breaking my Nine Dragon Body Nurturing Art will cost you!" Li Qingxu roared, covered in blood, with extensive bone fractures, barely able to stand. At this moment, he radiated boundless killing intent. Even when he was severely injured before, he managed to remain calm, but now his emotions surged violently. This time, his voice was exceptionally loud, heard by all observers on the surrounding high mountains.

"The Immortal Path has been severed, yet he still acts so self-important. As expected, even if he loses a crucial battle, his high-mindedness cannot falter."

"That light surging from his body is extremely dangerous. Is that his trump card?"

From a distance, many people could not clearly see the true nature of this pure Yang light.

Cao Qianqiu floated slowly into the sky, hands clasped behind his back, looking down at Qin Ming. His domineering and powerful demeanor was just as it had always been, embodying a disdainful attitude towards the entire world.

Li Qingyue saw it clearly, thanks to her Spirit Eyes. Her delicate brows furrowed; she felt a sense of unease. Cao Qianqiu was notoriously protective of his disciples. Who could stop him? All the Immortal Seeds and Divine Seeds on the other paths felt the anomaly, their eyes gleaming with divine light as they gazed solemnly.

This was a wisp of Cao Qianqiu's pure Yang consciousness spirit light. In an instant, he grasped the situation here. He looked at his disciple, his expression somewhat complex. He himself rarely suffered a defeat, so how could his disciple be in such a miserable state?

The Nine Dragon Body Nurturing Art was recorded in the Sect-Suppressing Scripture. If cultivated steadily, waiting for the divine chains to naturally break and fall away, Li Qingxu's aptitude and strength would surge by a significant margin. Yet, he was forced to break his cultivation early, and so miserably, with almost every bone in his body fractured.

Li Qingxu was deeply ashamed. Defeated by a demon, he had been forced to use the life-saving trump card his master had left him, leaving him feeling utterly disgraced.

"It's alright. The Nine Dragon Body Nurturing Art also has a saying of 'breaking through to establish oneself,' and you will be even stronger in the future," Cao Qianqiu said. In the outside world, he ran rampant and unrestrained, his hands stained with blood. He even wanted to suppress the Ancestral Master of the New Life Path and force him to become his strongman. He had also once used his greater power to bully the young, killing the Overlord without caring for his reputation, for which he was despised by many. However, his protective nature towards his disciples was truly unwavering.

Li Qingxu was deeply moved. His eyes reddened as he nodded. Even at a time like this, his master was still comforting him.

"It's a pity, though. In my youth, I never had the chance to 'break through to establish myself'," Cao Qianqiu mused.

At these words, Li Qingxu's expression froze.

"Mirror, quick, something's wrong here," Qin Ming secretly called out. The old man before him possessed immense power, and few wished to cross him.

"Currently, he hasn't exceeded the limits," the Heavenly Demon Mirror replied.

However, the dread in Qin Ming's heart did not lessen. What if this pure Yang consciousness spirit light remembered him and resonated with his main body? Then his future path, if not completely severed, would be close to it. This old man killed purely on a whim, acting without restraint, and few could truly restrain him.

Back in the divine city constructed by the great centipede, Cao Qianqiu had wanted to kill Qin Ming with a single finger, simply because the aura of his attacks resembled the Overlord's. If Meng Xinghai's martial grand-uncle hadn't stopped him in time, Qin Ming would have already turned into a mist of blood without even realizing it.

"Watch carefully how I crush him!" Cao Qianqiu declared.

Li Qingxu's heart trembled. His master was preparing to act personally!

Qin Ming knew that this matter could not end well. The old man was indeed going to step in personally – it was an old tradition of his lineage.

"Come here. I'll cut you down!" Cao Qianqiu's voice was filled with killing intent.

Since things had come to this, Qin Ming no longer remained silent, nor would he retreat. He calmly responded, "If you returned to your youth, or if I were born in your era, I might not necessarily fail to pin you down and beat you!"

Cao Qianqiu sneered, "You're unconvinced? Heh, I've looked down on all paths. How many so-called heroes have turned into dry bones in the annals of time? Even the powerful ones of an era barely qualified to approach and see me." His silver hair was bathed in the red sun, his eyes becoming incredibly sharp as he floated, looking down at the young man before him. "As for you youngsters, you couldn't even prostrate yourselves step by step to come before me."

Qin Ming's expression changed. He admitted that this old man was indeed formidable, strong his entire life, having kicked through countless iron plates. But this person was also truly arrogant beyond measure. His own temper flared. "I am indeed unconvinced. More words are useless. Give me a chance to fight you in the same realm, and I guarantee I'll strangle you."

Cao Qianqiu was surprised. For how many years had no one dared to speak to him like this? The last person to openly contradict and reprimand him was the Overlord. He said coldly, "Hmm, this environment forces me to fight at the same level? Heh, very well. When I was full of youthful vigor, I dared to sweep away all opponents in the world. Today, I'll be arrogant one more time and crush all you so-called heaven-blessed prodigies with a single hand."

Qin Ming finally understood why he was hated by gods and loathed by devils, why even demons envied him, and why dogs by the roadside would want to bite him. Every single one of this old man's sentences was incredibly infuriating. He could completely understand the feelings of his opponents: they couldn't deal with him, and anyone who dared to provoke him would be crushed. Thus, they were filled with resentment, indignation, and bitterness, forced to swallow their defiance.

Just in that brief moment, Qin Ming's emotions were stirred by him.

*Clang!* The Dragon Blade in his hand flared with light, instantly flowing with black and white radiance. Dragon and serpent resonated as he declared, "Stop acting like a senior! Today, let's see if I cleave you in half, or if you crush me with one hand!" Qin Ming was roused to powerful fighting spirit by this old man. It had been a long time since he so eagerly desired a battle with someone.

"Good. In the river of time I've traversed, there will be one more insignificant pile of dry bones," Cao Qianqiu nodded, incredibly dangerous aura swirling around him. He pointed a finger, and densely packed runes, numbering in the thousands, appeared in mid-air, like shining stars or blooming immortal flower buds about to burst open.

Li Qingxu was both ashamed and excited. In the end, it was his master who appeared here to personally slay the demon seed.

In the Secret Realm, various factions had no idea what was happening on the battlefield. They didn't know that the light emanating from Li Qingxu's body was Cao Qianqiu, nor could they hear the conversation. Undoubtedly, if the "calm exchange" between the old man and the young man were to spread, it would cause a huge uproar! Only a few people sensed something and guessed the truth.

After Cao Qianqiu pointed, the dense runes in mid-air rumbled and coalesced into a large hammer, engraved with numerous patterns. He held it, saying, "Whether it's a demon or a New Life Path cultivator, their early methods are similar. I will smash you in the very domain you are most skilled in."

With a *clang*, the Dragon Blade in Qin Ming's hand also transformed, re-condensing into a large hammer, black and white, wreathed in Yin-Yang Qi. His fighting spirit ignited, ready to go head-to-head with the old man. He channeled the Dragon Snake Scripture with his fused Heavenly Light Energy, imbued with demonic qi, manifesting the Dragon Snake Hammer, his essence, qi, and spirit highly concentrated.

Then, Qin Ming actively attacked, rushing forward with his hammer. He wouldn't follow the old man's rhythm. Against such an old madman, a direct blow was the best response. Cao Qianqiu, having been strong his entire life, met him head-on. His body, formed by pure Yang consciousness spirit light, was light as a feather but moved incredibly fast, carrying the runic great hammer as he dove down in an instant.

Blinding heavenly light surged, and he swung the hammer. The deafening explosions reverberated, striking the young man before him. Qin Ming was deeply surprised. Cao Qianqiu had actually simulated the terrifying characteristics of Heavenly Light Energy using pure Yang consciousness spirit light—it was indeed somewhat defying the heavens.

*Boom!* Like a thunderclap, it shook the entire battlefield. The vegetation and giant rocks in the mountainous terrain, anything hit by the streaming lights from their clash, shattered and exploded. In the arena, both their hair flew backward, and their clothes flapped wildly, buffeted by the terrifying "Heavenly Light Energy." Although Cao Qianqiu was formed from consciousness spirit light, he acted no differently from a flesh-and-blood body. He spun in mid-air, swinging his right arm, and smashed down with even more ferocity.

Qin Ming remained fearless, leaping up into the air, extending his body, and swinging the Dragon Snake Hammer towards his opponent. Instantly, dull, deafening thuds erupted in mid-air, and beams of light surged like heavenly lightning, causing the entire region to tremble violently.

Cao Qianqiu flew back in the air current, his pure Yang spirit body light as if weightless, clutching the rune-filled hammer as he leaped over twenty meters away. Qin Ming landed from the air, the ground beneath his feet cracking. The Heavenly Light Energy in his hammer was immense, as if wrapped in lightning.

"Quite some skill. Hmm, you have a problem," Cao Qianqiu stared at him. In fact, ever since he first saw Qin Ming, he sensed that this person was not purely a demon. But he hadn't thought much of it. Now, after exchanging blows, with his experience and knowledge, he naturally gained much information.

Qin Ming cut him off, "Less nonsense. I really want to see how you'll crush me. And don't just use one hand; use both!" In truth, he himself was also holding one hand behind his back.

Cao Qianqiu's expression was cold as he raised his great hammer again. The power he displayed, while called Heavenly Light Energy, was actually simulated by his pure Yang consciousness spirit light, far more powerful than the Heavenly Light Energy cultivated by those on the Immortal Path themselves. The "pure Yang" attribute alone was enough to overwhelm everything. He used runes to continuously疊加 (layer upon layer), constructing this pure Yang light into an incredibly terrifying "force."

Behind him, Li Qingxu was greatly shocked. It was his first time seeing his master's power at this stage; he truly could not surpass his master.

Cao Qianqiu flew like lightning in his spirit body state, carrying the great hammer, and once again dove towards Qin Ming. This time, Qin Ming stood still, fiercely channeling his Heavenly Light Energy, causing the Dragon Snake Hammer in his right hand to vibrate and roar, wreathed in blinding light beams, even emitting tearing sounds as it cut through the air.

Like a mountain torrent erupting and lakes and seas breaking their banks, roars continued incessantly. Qin Ming and Cao Qianqiu continuously clashed hammers, almost sinking the mountains and tearing open the curtain of night.

Finally, the two suddenly separated. Qin Ming held his Dragon Snake Hammer and looked across. Cao Qianqiu's spirit body drifted lightly, moving back over a dozen meters. The rune-filled great hammer in his hand was already shattered; only a large portion of the hammer handle remained.

"Bring out your Immortal Path techniques!" Qin Ming, with his left hand behind his back, pointed his black and white Dragon Snake Hammer at Cao Qianqiu in mid-air.
