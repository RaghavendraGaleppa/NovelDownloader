# Chapter 7: Picking Up a Stone  

"Ouch! Brother, be gentle!"  

Jiang Li winced in pain, but the martial artist tending to his wound only chuckled.  

"Bear with it, kid. Bite wounds in the wild are the most troublesome. If not treated properly, they can get infected with 'tooth poison,' and you might lose your entire arm."  

Jiang Li knew that "tooth poison" was their term for wound infection. Although his cheat-like status panel could remove negative effects, he didn’t want the filthy saliva of the scale demons lingering in his wound. Gritting his teeth, he continued the conversation.  

"Alright... But brother, what exactly were those things that attacked us today? They looked so human."  

Jiang Li feigned ignorance.  

"Those are scale demons, monsters from the sea. Don’t be fooled by their human-like appearance—they’re all beautiful, but whether male or female, they look the same. And they eat people."  

The martial artist’s meaning was clear: their alluring appearance was merely a disguise to lure prey.  

Jiang Li shuddered. He had wondered why all the scale demons appeared female—now he understood.  

*Even cross-dressing has crossed species lines these days. Truly terrifying.*  

"But brother, why not just kill these monsters? Why go through the trouble of capturing them?"  

He pointed at the martial artists nearby, who were loading the immobilized scale demons back into the iron-barred cages on the wagons. The earlier ambush had allowed most of the scale demons to escape, and now the captured ones were being locked up again.  

The night raid had cost the convoy dearly, but the scale demons had suffered even greater losses. Jiang Li couldn’t fathom what they had hoped to gain.  

"We capture them to sell. Now, if you can move, go help. I’ve got others to tend to."  

With that, the martial artist picked up his medical kit and left.  

Jiang Li touched the bandage—it was neatly wrapped, far better than Yan Hong’s amateurish attempts.  

He glanced at his status panel. That bite had been vicious, taking away 77 HP. Though the numerical value wasn’t a perfect reflection of his physical condition, it was still a useful reference.  

The medicine the martial artist had applied wasn’t as effective as the pear-blossom ointment—no buffs had appeared. However, Jiang Li currently had two recovery buffs: **[Slow Healing]** and **[Accelerated Recovery]**, which together restored 6 HP per hour. At this rate, his wound would fully heal in about thirteen hours.  

For an ordinary person, this recovery speed was astonishing.  

---  

As an injured party, Jiang Li wasn’t required to help clean up the aftermath. Instead, he wandered over to the iron cages to observe.  

A martial artist dragged two scale demon corpses from the nearby woods—likely killed by cultivators during their escape.  

It seemed "capturing alive" wasn’t easy. Even low-powered talismans could accidentally kill the creatures.  

Unlike humans, the scale demons weren’t granted the dignity of a proper burial. They were piled together, destined for cremation.  

*Splash—*  

A faint sound of water came from nearby.  

From one of the iron-barred wooden tubs, a head slowly emerged.  

Jiang Li suddenly remembered—this was the scale demon Yan Hong had tried to show him after dinner but had failed to find.  

Intrigued, he discreetly observed the creature. Unlike its kin, this one had pure white hair and eyes more human-like, with pupils less dilated.  

*Special.* As a transmigrator, Jiang Li had a soft spot for the unusual.  

Upon closer inspection, he noticed this scale demon’s cage was different from the others. The bars were thicker, the door welded shut with molten iron instead of locked, and four talismans were affixed to its corners.  

*This one’s definitely important.*  

"What’s it looking at?"  

Jiang Li realized the white-haired scale demon was fixated on something, oblivious to his gaze. Following its line of sight, he saw another scale demon being dragged out of the woods.  

The white-haired one’s eyes tracked the corpse intently.  

Then, something small and black fell from the dead scale demon’s body.  

The white-haired demon twitched, its gaze locking onto the object.  

*Ahem!*  

Jiang Li deliberately made a noise. Startled, the scale demon ducked back into the tub.  

Once it stayed hidden, Jiang Li casually strolled over, "accidentally" dropping a handkerchief from his sleeve near the fallen object.  

He bent to pick it up, lingered for a moment, then returned to his wagon as if bored.  

After stuffing a paper ball into the small hole in the wagon’s wall, Jiang Li finally examined the handkerchief—a gift from one of the girls. Inside was a palm-sized black stone.  

He turned it over repeatedly. *Isn’t this the same stone that brat threw in earlier?*  

---  

"After all that excitement, did I just pick up a worthless rock?"  

Skeptical, Jiang Li cast **[Appraisal]**.  

**[Name: Stone with Hidden Contents]**  
**[Type: Miscellaneous]**  
**[Contents: Unknown]**  

*Bingo! There’s something inside!*  

The stone carried a faint, fishy stench, similar to the earlier fog.  

Lighting a small lamp, Jiang Li inspected it closely and found an almost imperceptible crack on its surface.  

He didn’t force it open. In his current situation, anything valuable inside wouldn’t stay his for long.  

Instead, he played the part of a recovering patient, quietly resting in the wagon.  

Later, he heard that when the cultivators returned, they hadn’t recaptured many scale demons. Some had even been ambushed and injured.  

That night, the white-haired scale demon had inexplicably gone berserk, thrashing in its cage and keeping the entire camp awake until a cultivator subdued it.  

The rest of the journey passed uneventfully. Villages and towns grew more frequent as they left the wilderness and entered human territory.  

Jiang Li’s wound had actually healed by the second day, but he kept the bandages on, changing them himself. Only when the other injured travelers recovered did he finally remove his, timing it perfectly.  

Days later, after speeding along the smooth official road, a grand vermilion pavilion appeared on the horizon.  

"We’ve arrived at our destination!"
