# Chapter 61: The New Manor Master (Requesting First Subscription and Monthly Ticket)

Yang Can returned from Phoenix Manor, bringing the Alliance Master's final verdict regarding the matter of Feng'an Manor.

Manor Master Zhang Yunyi, for failing to manage his subordinates effectively, was demoted from Manor Master to Deputy Manor Manager, assisting the Second Steward of the Main Branch, Yang Can.

Yang Can, in turn, concurrently assumed the position of Feng'an Manor Master.

When this news spread, the Zhang family, and indeed all the tenant farmers attached to it, breathed a collective sigh of relief.

Although they could no longer lord it over others as they once did, at least this calamity had passed. Their lives were no longer in danger, and their existing assets were preserved. This greatly stabilized the largest faction of tenant farmers within Feng'an Manor.

Among them, the stewards who had blood on their hands were subjected to the family rules under Zhang Yunyi's supervision and were personally executed. This was a "pledge of allegiance"—he had to do it.

With these series of actions, his original foundation of rule was completely dismantled. Only then could Yang Can control him more effectively.

The other stewards were "retained in their positions despite their guilt." This ensured that during the critical spring plowing season, the manor's production order would not fall into chaos. At the same time, these people, eager to make a good impression in front of the new Manor Master, would only work even more diligently.

Yang Can simply held onto the power of the sword and the authority for personnel evaluations, leaving the specific affairs to be handled by Manor Master Zhang. Feng'an Manor thus completed its "blood transfusion," yet on the surface, it seemed there were no earth-shattering changes.

Since Yang Can had inspected Feng'an Manor, the other manors had been closely monitoring everything happening there. The news that Feng'an Manor Master Zhang Yunyi had personally executed his uncle, his son, and his nephew, and that the atmosphere of Feng'an Manor had undergone a great change, spread rapidly.

The manor masters and stewards from all over were greatly alarmed upon hearing this. The six major manors knew each other well; they were very clear about what kind of person Zhang Yunyi was. Yet, it was this陇上 (Longshang) man, who valued his family above all else, who actually killed his uncle and son to curry favor with Yang Can.

What kind of methods did this Yang Can possess to have tamed Manor Master Zhang so completely? They couldn't get the details, and with no details, they could only speculate wildly. The more they thought about it, the more panicked they became, because they didn't feel their own scheming and craftiness were any better than Zhang Yunyi's. Zhang Yunyi had already been beaten into an obedient grandson by Yang Can, even more obedient than a real grandson. Could *I* be his match?

So, they immediately followed suit and began to conduct self-investigations. By doing so, they hoped that when Steward Yang arrived at their territory, their proactive performance would earn them a more lenient treatment. Their demands weren't high, just a little better than Zhang Yunyi's would do. They just didn't want to be forced into killing their own sons or nephews.

There were still some "hard-headed" manor masters who wanted to struggle a bit. But they soon discovered they couldn't struggle anymore. The stewards under their command were terrified that they, like the stewards in Feng'an Manor, would be thrown out by their manor masters to "take the blame" for their own self-preservation. Even those with poor father-son relationships or not-so-close relatives began to guard against their own manor masters.

With that, what was the point of struggling? They couldn't lead their teams anymore! Everyone was hiding their true intentions, and everyone was collecting dirt on others. By doing this, either to protect themselves or to report others for merit, how could things possibly work?

Left with no choice, these manor masters gritted their teeth and reluctantly joined the ranks of self-correction. And at this time, Yang Can's people hadn't even arrived at their manors yet, nor had they issued any instructions regarding their manors.

Tomorrow, Yang Can would formally take over Feng'an Fortress and move in. Feng'an Fortress would welcome its new master.

Since evening, Miss Qingmei had been preoccupied. During dinner, Qingmei ate her rice grain by grain, several times on the verge of speaking but stopping herself. Seeing that Yang Can was almost finished with his meal, Qingmei finally couldn't hold back and cleared her throat.

"Steward Yang, you're taking over Feng'an Fortress tomorrow. Who's going to manage such a big fortress for you? Are you... planning to use Zhang Yunyi's people?"

Yang Can secretly chuckled to himself. This little girl has finally run out of patience. He said solemnly, "How could that be? Everyone in the fortress has to go. As for manpower... yes, there is a shortage. I'll think of a way to recruit new people. As for who will manage the fortress for me in the future..." Yang Can pondered for a moment and asked, "Qingmei, what do you think of Matron Chen?"

"Huh? Matron Chen?"

"Yes, I've seen her arrange the farming affairs these past few days. She performed exceptionally well."

Hearing this, Qingmei panicked. So that's why he didn't discuss it with me. He already has someone in mind. What's so good about Matron Chen? Is she as smooth and glossy as me? Is she as fair-skinned and tender as me? I'm such a pretty young lady standing right in front of you, are you blind?

Yang Can continued to tease her. "I think Matron Chen is steady and composed, and she handles everything comprehensively..."

"Who can't be steady? If she's comprehensive, doesn't that mean I'm not?"

Qingmei had to recommend herself. "Steward Yang, I can do it too! I've been by the Young Mistress's side since I was a child. I'm a real hand at managing and handling affairs. I also know how to balance accounts, manage finances, and supervise servants. A household can't do without a reliable steward. You don't know this, but if the master's family is even slightly inattentive, the servants will be lazy, gluttonous, and deceitful."

Yang Can said hesitantly, "But you... you're so young, can you really do it?"

"I can, I definitely can! As long as I'm here, I promise you won't have to worry or tire yourself out! Whether I'm capable or not, I'll handle everything, big or small, and I guarantee you won't have to lift a finger."

"But... you're the Young Mistress's personal maid. Will the Young Mistress be willing to let you go?"

"Your ability to stand firm in Feng'an Manor is the Young Mistress's face. She'll definitely agree."

Qingmei thought to herself, *My lady already said I should take care of you for her. But, at the time, my lady didn't know you'd be staying long in Feng'an Fortress. That's okay, I'll just tell her that all the young women in Feng'an Manor are lusting after you. My lady will definitely agree to let me come here to keep an eye on you!*

Yang Can smiled. "Alright then, in that case, come with me to take over Feng'an Fortress tomorrow. From now on... all the internal affairs of Feng'an Fortress will be in your hands."

"Great!" Qingmei beamed with joy and suddenly found a great appetite.

For ordinary people with no savings, moving out of their old house in three days is quite easy. But for Manor Master Zhang, who had operated there for decades, it was a hassle. Even if he gathered all the villagers to help, three days might not be enough.

However, ever since Zhang Yunyi "killed his son to prove his way," he seemed to have suddenly become enlightened. It was as if there was nothing left in the world he particularly cared about. Early on the third day, he ran to see Yang Can with his steward, Wan Tai.

"Manor Master, my possessions in Feng'an Fortress have been moved out. We can proceed with the formal handover."

So, Yang Can, along with Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan and Little Qingmei, followed Zhang Yunyi and Steward Wan to take over Feng'an Fortress.

As they walked along, Yang Can felt that Feng'an Fortress was almost no different from usual. Not only was there not enough time for the move, but also Zhang Xiaomi's three-entry courtyard house couldn't hold everything. Moreover, there was likely the intention of Zhang Yunyi trying to please Yang Can. So, a large amount of property was left behind.

The furniture and sundries in the manor, the murals and wallpaper... even the tall, one-person-high vases in the living room were still standing there.估计 (gūjì) Zhang Yunyi only took away some gold, silver, and valuables, along with some personal items the Zhang family was accustomed to using.

When Yang Can went to take over the storerooms, he found that many of them contained a large amount of liquidatable assets, all neatly categorized and left untouched. One storeroom, upon entering, was满地 (mǎndì) with fine sand. Buried in the sand were complete sets of top-quality porcelain, worth a great deal.

When large families order porcelain, they go directly to the porcelain factory for custom orders. The porcelain ordered by Feng'an Fortress was all fired with the characters "Feng'an" on it. Moreover, each type of porcelain was ordered in ten identical sets. This way, if a piece in a set, like a wine cup or teacup, was accidentally broken, one could simply take another from the complete set. A family with such a show of extravagance would never put a mismatched cup in to make up the number.

These porcelains, once brought back, would first be stored in fine sand. This not only prevents chipping and breakage, but even an earthquake wouldn't shatter them. Furthermore, it prevents oxidation by isolating them from the air. When needed, one takes them out from the sand, peels off the wrapping, and rinses them with water, and they look as new as if they had just come from the kiln.

Qingmei's mindset transition was very smooth; she had already adopted the attitude of the internal steward of Feng'an Fortress. More accurately, it seemed more like the mindset of a mistress. During the handover, she was even more attentive than Yang Can. Yang Can walked through the entire place, inside and out, accompanied by Zhang Yunyi, while Qingmei took "shorthand" throughout. Yang Can didn't understand her scrawls, but she could read them herself.

"Good, that's it."

After the full tour, Yang Can nodded in satisfaction.

Zhang Yunyi said calmly, "Then, I will take my leave."

Ever since he personally killed his son, Zhang Yunyi had been in this emotionless state. It was as if it was hard for anything in the world to stir his emotions anymore.

Walking out of Feng'an Fortress and standing on the吊桥 (diàoqiáo) of the moat, Wan Tai said resentfully, "This Yang Can is too overbearing." Thinking of the property that hadn't been transported in time, Wan Tai said with heartache, "Master, actually, we could have transported more things out, like silk and cloth..."

Zhang Yunyi said calmly, "We'll be back soon. What's the point of moving things back and forth?" With that, he slowly turned around and took a deep look at Feng'an Fortress. That was the home he had built with his own hands.

At this moment, four double-shaft carriages were slowly approaching from east to west, three hundred li away from Feng'an Manor. The sound of the carriages rumbled on the road, which was overgrown with weeds and had few travelers. Twenty-odd riders rode alongside the carriages, front and back. They wore gray-green robes and had extremely burly physiques. Their sabers had a greater curve than the common环首刀 (huánshǒudāo). The blades had a more pronounced arc, clearly designed for slashing and more suitable for mounted combat. At the same time, they also carried bows and quivers. On one side of their saddles hung willow round shields covered in cowhide. With such a set of gear, ordinary road bandits would know at a glance that these were tough targets and wouldn't dare to provoke them easily. In the eyes of many, they might be mistaken for martial artists escorting goods for a wealthy family.

But people in the Jianghu could tell at a glance that they were "mountain goods runners." This way, the bandits who scout for targets wouldn't try to rob them. Because the so-called "mountain goods runners" are actually smugglers, belonging to the same black market trade as horse bandits. They are all people who lick blood from the blade, and the "mountain goods runners" are even more ferocious. Moreover, horse bandits rarely capture cash or grain; what they get their hands on is mostly goods. And these goods, they have no way to sell themselves. At that time, they would have to seek the help of the "mountain goods runners" to liquidate them. So, even horse bandits and "mountain goods runners" have reached a kind of wonderful harmony. It's like the relationship between cleaner wrasse and moray eels, which exists between "cleaners" and "clients."

The carriage and horses passed by, leaving deep ruts in the road. It seemed this batch of "mountain goods" was exceptionally rich.
