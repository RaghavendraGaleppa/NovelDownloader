# Chapter: Leave Notice  

I don’t know why, but my vision suddenly blurred. Everything looked slightly distorted, yet somehow still clear—just a dazed, disoriented feeling. I think I need to sleep. If it doesn’t improve by tomorrow, I’ll have to go to the hospital.  

Originally, I planned to stay up until 1 a.m. and write another 4,000 words for the old book.  

At least I managed to finish two chapters.
