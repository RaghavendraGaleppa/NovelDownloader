# Chapter 98: Cangzhou, Emerald Wave City

The middle-aged man instinctively shielded Chi Suwen behind him, his voice low as he demanded, "What is the purpose of your visit, sir?"

"Uncle Chen, he's here to buy a horse," Chi Suwen explained softly.

"It's you!"

Uncle Jin, his golden sword at his waist, burst through the cloth curtain of the backyard, his expression alert. The golden blade was half-drawn, its cold light gleaming.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. Cupping his fist in a salute, a hint of a smile appeared on his face. "I didn't expect to meet the two of you here."

Upon learning that Xu Yunfan had come to buy a horse, Uncle Jin, who had been so tense his goosebumps were about to erupt, finally calmed down. His taut nerves relaxed, he sheathed his golden sword, and his expression softened slightly. He cupped his fist in return and said no more.

Standing beside Chi Suwen, Uncle Chen stepped aside, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on Xu Yunfan. Should the other party make any sudden move, he was ready to strike with all his might. The threat the other posed was no less oppressive than that of a master of the Flesh Refining Realm.

Noticing Uncle Chen's expression, Chi Suwen naturally understood that Xu Yunfan was no ordinary martial artist. She smiled, "Though we had a small misunderstanding before, if you wish to buy a horse, you are more than welcome. Qingzhou is famous for its fine steeds. We've brought quite a few from there. If you're interested, you can go pick one out from the inn's stable yourself."

Chi Suwen also harbored the intention of making an acquaintance. The first time they met, he was merely a Second-Grade Martial Artist. Yet, in just four or five months, he had managed to make even Uncle Chen, a Great Martial Artist, tense with caution. She certainly wouldn't refuse to befriend such a promising warrior.

Xu Yunfan cupped his fist in thanks and followed Chi Suwen into the stable.

In the slanting morning light, the mane of a chestnut horse shimmered with a golden-red luster. It bore a striking resemblance to his previous mount. Xu Yunfan took a liking to it at first sight. This horse could carry a thousand catties and still gallop swiftly, capable of running a thousand miles at full speed with ease to spare.

Xu Yunfan stroked the horse's mane, a sigh of admiration escaping him. He couldn't help but think of the horse he had left at the foot of Thunder Accumulation Mountain.

Just as he was about to untie the reins, a delicate jingling sound came from his side.

"Sir Xu, you have traveled far and wide across the land. For us to meet here in Cangzhou is truly fated. Have you ever considered settling down in a place?"

Chi Suwen's slender fingers gently stroked the horse's mane. The silver thread and branch patterns embroidered on her plain white sleeves swayed slightly in the wind.

She was trying to recruit him.

Xu Yunfan replied, "I am indeed thinking of finding a sect to apprentice myself to. Rumor has it that the eight great sects of Cangzhou each have their own unique merits. I plan to visit them one by one to see which is the best."

"If you were to join the Chi family and become an Elder, you would never lack for medicinal pills or spiritual food. Furthermore, you would receive a generous annual stipend: thirty Xuan Yuan Pills per month, a hundred bushels of Yellow Sprout Rice, and five thousand taels of silver per year," she offered.

She added at the end, "An Elder of the Heavenly Rank may also peruse the fragments of the *Great Zhou Martial Canon*."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred. He hadn't spent all this time in the martial world for nothing. He knew that the *Great Zhou Martial Canon* was a text compiled by the founding emperor of the Great Zhou in collaboration with nine Grandmasters of Qi Refining. Their goal was to spread martial arts throughout the world, striving to make everyone as formidable as a dragon.

Unfortunately, the project was ultimately abandoned, leaving behind only fragments. He hadn't expected the Chi family to possess a fragment of it.

It was a pity it was only a fragment.

"I have heard that your family's signature martial art, the *Surging Dragon and Flashing Phoenix Step*, is unrivaled in northern Ji. I wonder if it can be taught to outsiders?"

The jade-like fingers stroking the horse's mane suddenly froze. After a long while, she finally said, "It is a family martial art. It is not taught to anyone outside the direct bloodline."

Before her words had fully faded, Xu Yunfan had already vaulted into the saddle. The chestnut horse snorted and stamped its hooves, making crisp sounds on the spot.

"Miss Chi, I appreciate your kindness," Xu Yunfan said, tightening the reins as he looked toward the end of the long street, in the direction of the city exit. "But I am a wild hawk, used to the freedom of the skies. I cannot bear the rules of a golden cage."

He placed nine hundred-tael notes issued by the Datong Exchange on the counter. Leaning against a vermilion pillar of the inn, Chi Suwen watched the figure in the cyan gown ride off, vanishing into the dust of the marketplace.

"Why must you be so persistent, Young Miss?" Uncle Chen finally straightened his back and stepped forward, his cloudy old eyes fixed on the fading dust on the bluestone slabs.

"This young man's entire being is suffused with a condensed aura of blood and slaughter. A hidden glint of blades and spears lingers between his brows; it's clear he has come through countless battles. Such a man is wild in nature, disregards laws and discipline, and holds the king's law in contempt. If things do not go his way, he is capable of doing something incredibly audacious."

Chi Suwen shook her head slightly. "Uncle Chen, his talent is exceptional. If we could recruit him in advance, perhaps a master at least at the Marrow Cleansing Realm would emerge in the future."

Uncle Chen let out a dry laugh. "Young Miss, the Marrow Cleansing Realm is not so easily reached. In the Great Zhou, with its hundreds of millions of people, how many masters have reached the Marrow Cleansing Realm? As for wanderers like him, they might die on the road any day."

She gazed at the gathering and dispersing clouds on the horizon, murmuring to herself as if in a soliloquy, "Who was it again that is currently in charge of the Chi family's water transport in Yuezhou?"

At that very moment, the last hoofbeat at the end of the long street faded away, mixing with the morning market's cries to shatter an unspoken answer in the spring breeze of May.

Xu Yunfan had no regrets. If he had agreed on the spot, his life would have been set in stone, with no room for further ascent.

Sects were one thing, but with a family like the Chi's, without a blood connection, one would be constrained in everything one did. It wouldn't be surprising if they eventually used him as a scapegoat.

Xu Yunfan spurred his horse forward in a gallop, the steed beneath him whinnying fiercely.

Though there were minor incidents along the way, he dealt with them effortlessly. He finally arrived at Cangzhou's capital city, Emerald Wave City, and gazed at the city appearing on the horizon.

Xu Yunfan reined in his horse on the long, willow-lined embankment. The hundred-zhang-high city walls were bathed in the emerald glow of the lake. The bronze plaque bearing the words "Emerald Wave" exuded a damp, dark luster.

On the waterway of the barbican, cargo boats cut through the mist. Cormorants on the prows flapped their wings, occasionally diving into the water and emerging with a fish clutched in their beaks.

There were many merchants coming and going, and the pedestrians seemed peaceful and content. Faintly, the sound of children playing and laughing could be heard.

This place was a world apart from Wuzhou, which was engulfed in flames of war and left desolate for a thousand miles.

Dismounting, Xu Yunfan led his horse into the city. Finally, he saw the Longfeng Tavern standing tall at a corner of the city center. Willow catkins from the street were drifting past the tavern's signboard, on which the words "Longfeng" were embroidered with golden thread.

A smile couldn't help but appear on his face.

"Attendant, take good care of my horse. Feed it the finest fodder. I want a private room on the second floor."

"Coming right up! A private room on the second floor!"

A one-armed attendant walked over to greet him.

"Sir, this warhorse of yours is raised with great care." He stroked the horse's mane, clearly fond of it. "Sir, would you like me to add three taels of wormwood and half a qian of dragon's blood resin to its feed?"

"Whatever you think is best."

He went up to the private room on the second floor. The carved window on the second floor was pushed halfway open, perfectly framing the corner of the Moon-Viewing Pavilion's eaves.

When the waiter lifted the curtain and entered with a tray, there was a three-foot-long silver-scaled fish lying in a celadon bowl. The waiter flicked the rim of the bowl with his finger, and the fish's body instantly split into a hundred slices. Each slice of meat was coated with a thin layer of ice crystal like a cicada's wing. It was a Snow Dragon Trout from the depths of Emerald Wave Lake, a fish that takes ten years to grow.

When the second dish was served, the aroma of charcoal fire mixed with the scent of blood filled the air. A charred meat chop was skewered with a broken horn, the cross-section of which was as densely ringed as the stars.

These two dishes of exotic beast meat were not cheap. Combined with the other dishes on the table, the meal cost Xu Yunfan nearly ninety taels of silver.

But it was a truly satisfying meal.
