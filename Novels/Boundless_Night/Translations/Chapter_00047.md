# Chapter 47: The End of the Song, People Scatter

Under the cover of night, the mountain forest was dim. Today, large swathes of the area were quiet, and aside from some herbivores, it was difficult to encounter a single fierce beast.

Qin Ming sprinted along. As he passed through a dense thicket, he suddenly stopped. He shed his armor and set down his long-handled black-gold hammer, then dug out a set of gleaming refined-gold armor from the snow. This was the relic of Wang Nianzhu, who was dead but still wanted. Qin Ming swiftly changed his attire, worried that the place he was going might have bear cubs or ox calves that, if highly spiritual, might remember his appearance, which would be disastrous. Everyone knew that Wang Nianzhu had slain the blood snake and wiped out the mountain patrol team, including Fu Entao and Feng Yi'an. Now, taking advantage of the chaos to enter the lair of the mutated creatures was a perfectly normal action for him.

After strapping Wang Nianzhu’s longsword, which was as clear as a pristine spring, to his waist, Qin Ming found a piece of cloth to cover his face. He had no choice; he wasn't strong enough yet and had to be cautious.

He then ran eight *li* in one breath, arriving at a stone forest surrounded by trees. Rocks were everywhere, with some areas piled almost into stone mountains.

"It stinks!" Qin Ming found it almost unbearable. The white giant bear living here was truly unhygienic; he had barely approached when he smelled the stench of bear dung.

Deep within the stone forest was a fiery spring, shrouded in crimson mist and shimmering with light. Its scale was similar to the Level Two fiery spring in Silvervine Town. Although the white giant bear had undergone multiple mutations and was extremely powerful, it still wasn't qualified to enter the deeper mountains or occupy a more splendid fiery spring. However, for mountain dwellers, this was already a treasure trove.

But such a good place had been ruined by the giant bear. Animal fur, bones, and other remains were strewn everywhere. The enormous piles of bear dung were scattered throughout, especially near the fiery spring. It was clear that its hibernation was far from complete, as it was still frequently hunting in the mountains.

"It must be an old male bear, so solitary. Such a large territory, yet it lives alone, wasting this treasure ground." Qin Ming looked around, but the place was so foul-smelling, and there was virtually nothing else. He was thoroughly exasperated. He had traveled such a long distance, risking so much, only to find nothing but the reek of bear dung. Qin Ming really wanted to set the place ablaze and burn it all clean! Even if there were descendants of the old male bear here, he could vent his frustration; failing that, he'd chop off two bear paws and take them back. He couldn't even say the place was "poor but clean" because the reality was it was disgustingly filthy, making him feel like vomiting.

This was the first time Qin Ming felt helpless after being thwarted, a particularly suffocating feeling. He wanted revenge but ended up pinching his nose and giving up, not wanting to stay there for another moment.

Just as he turned to leave, he suddenly saw a flash of scales in the fiery spring. His spirits immediately lifted. "This old brute actually knows how to raise fish?" Qin Ming rushed to the bank of the fiery spring and saw fish silhouettes in the six- or seven-zhang square pool. However, he soon found himself staring blankly; those were just fish fry.

"This disgusting old bear is truly despicable. These fish probably won't even grow big before it scoops them up and eats them!" In the end, he went for the fish fry. He ignored those shorter than his finger, but took all those nearing the length of his palm. The two largest were seven inches long, and in total, he gathered over twenty. These were originally spiritual fish, glowing blue and semi-transparent in some parts. They could grow over a meter long, and when mature, they contained rich spiritual energy and vitality. Unfortunately, with that impatient old male bear around, they could never grow that large.

"Although they're still small, they possess some spiritual essence and are quite a tonic." Qin Ming always carried a beast-hide bag when he entered the mountains. The harsh living environment had cultivated this practical habit in him, and it was now proving useful. This was also one of the reasons why Huang Jingjun would often smirk, secretly mocking him.

Qin Ming didn't look back, quickly rushing seven *li* away to Wild Ox Ridge. He was playing a timing game; his actions had to be swift. Under the night sky, the mountain ranges stretched on, covered by vast forests.

As Qin Ming ventured into the golden giant ox's territory, he was immediately stunned. Deep in the forest was a Level Two fiery spring. The fiery red glowing liquid wasn't pooled, but instead irrigated some scattered "fire fields." The fiery spring wasn't hot, far from body temperature, but it was enough to ward off the severe cold brought by wind and snow. The fire fields were actually lush and vibrant with colorful flowers.

"The old yellow ox is certainly diligent!" Qin Ming exclaimed in admiration. While the mountains were covered in white snow and snowflakes were still drifting from the sky, this area presented such a vibrant scene, truly eye-catching. A green vine was laden with fiery pears, twenty or thirty of which were already bright red and emitting an enticing fruity fragrance. "This fruit can replenish Qi and blood." Qin Ming quickly picked them.

Soon after, he discovered a patch of low-lying plants. Though only a foot tall, each stalk was covered in purple berries that tasted sweet and sour. "So many Purple Sun Berries! Eating a few when tired can quickly restore energy. This old ox plants good things!" Qin Ming's impression of the golden giant ox greatly improved. Although this scattered fire field wasn't particularly well-managed, the high spiritual energy of the Level Two fiery spring meant all the plants grew exceptionally well.

Unfortunately, the old yellow ox had a large family. It led a herd of wild oxen residing in this mountain ridge, so there were no new spiritual substances left for others; they had all likely been eaten by its calves and descendants. Qin Ming was disappointed. He had ventured into the lair of a multiple-mutated creature, naturally hoping for some gains, hoping to achieve a third rebirth. "No hope for the old bear or the yellow ox here. It seems Old Man Liu is still the most reliable. I'll go into the mountains with him later!"

There were many fruits and melons in the fire field, all carrying some spiritual essence, making them great tonics for ordinary people. Some were already ripe. In this icy world, seeing such delicious fruits temporarily dispelled Qin Ming's disappointment, and his eyes gradually lit up. Whether red fruits or golden melons, he picked everything that was ripe, filling both of his beast-hide bags.

"Are there any ox calves left behind?" Qin Ming looked towards the depths of Wild Ox Ridge.

"Hmm?" Suddenly, his pupils constricted. He didn't see any ox calves, but there was a donkey foal. It looked very much like Old Weasel's mount, but it shouldn't be, because this was just a small donkey, and it was actually stealing melons! In the distant fire field, with a plop, the melon in the donkey foal's mouth dropped to the ground. It was startled too, shocked by the sudden appearance of the armored biped.

"Donkey foal, whatever you do, don't bray!" Qin Ming turned and ran. This little donkey posed no threat, but it had powerful backing. If it started braying here, who knew what monster it might attract? Qin Ming believed it must be a descendant of Old Weasel's mount; otherwise, how would a mere donkey foal dare to come here and steal melons?

Qin Ming tore away, disappearing in a flash. In the scattered fire field, the donkey foal was also baffled. It had been about to kick up its heels and bolt, but that biped actually fled before it did. Feeling guilty, it didn't dare to bray. It wandered around like a street bum, eating its fill along the way, then let out a satisfied burp, wagged its tail, and dashed off.

Much later, a large white ox emerged from the depths of Wild Ox Ridge. This was a triple-mutated creature. The old yellow ox, with its large family, naturally left an ox to guard the home. The white ox had noticed the donkey foal the moment it appeared. Instead of chasing it away, it had hidden itself, knowing the little donkey's background and not wanting to disturb it. "We don't need that little one to sense anything. Later, we'll just let Senior Donkey know that we've been taking good care of its descendant, making sure it's well-fed and comfortable," the white ox said in ox-speak. Even in these mountains, as an ox, one still had to understand human etiquette.

"Moo, did a whole herd of donkeys come?!" The white ox was utterly stunned as it approached the fire field!

Qin Ming sprinted six *li* away, and finding no movement behind him, he let out a long breath. He then continued his journey to retrieve his armor and long-handled hammer. Along the way, he also picked up the mutton-fat jade iron he had hidden in the mountains. All the dangerous masters had gone to the Great Rift Valley, leaving the outside empty.

"Little Qin, you've finally returned safely! If anything had happened, we would have felt guilty for the rest of our lives!" Xu Yueping, Yang Yongqing, and others had been waiting at the village entrance.

"I'm fine, no danger, just a bit of a scare, and I even brought back some mountain goods on the way," Qin Ming briefly explained what happened in the Great Rift Valley. Xu Yueping was shocked; the large-scale, organized reverse hunt by the mutated creatures left him speechless. Yang Yongqing also felt shaken and fearful. Not to mention them, even the noble elites of Scarlet Cloud City were bound to lose a layer of skin there. Upon learning that all the mountain dwellers had emerged safely, they were speechless again, finding it both frustrating and amusing. They could only sigh, lamenting the unpredictability of life—those most likely to be in trouble had all managed to escape.

"Little Uncle, it's so great you're back safely! We were all worried sick!" Wen Rui rubbed his small hands, white mist puffing from his mouth and nose. He stood in the snow by his doorstep and jumped with joy when he saw Qin Ming return. He had run out more than a dozen times that day, and each time he saw Qin Ming's courtyard gate still locked, he felt very disappointed, fearing something had happened to his little uncle. This was because he had already learned from Lu Ze and Liang Wanqing that his little uncle had been taken by people from Golden Rooster Ridge to do something very dangerous. Although Lu Ze was severely injured, his physique was excellent, and he was now able to go out, walking with Liang Wanqing's support.

A quarter of an hour later, Qin Ming arrived at their small courtyard, carrying a large bag of red and golden fruits. Usually, when they went into the mountains, they might occasionally find some wild fruits preserved under the snow from autumn, but they were certainly not this fresh.

"Wow, this time it's not mountain persimmons, it's my favorite red berries! Little Uncle, you're amazing!" Wen Rui's face was flushed as he ate, happily exclaiming. Two-year-old Wen Hui hugged Qin Ming's neck, giving him a loud kiss, babbling his joy. In the iron cage, the fiery-furred mutated squirrel hopped around, practically crying from craving, staring eagerly and chirping non-stop.

"Bow to me, and I'll give you a little red fruit," Qin Ming chuckled. To his surprise, the squirrel actually stood in its cage and repeatedly bowed to him. Each time it bowed, it chirped, as if counting. "You've really become a spirit?" Qin Ming's heart skipped a beat.

The prolonged absence of those who entered the mountains naturally caused concern among all parties. The various major families had left a small number of people in Silvervine Town and other places, realizing something had gone wrong.

After Qin Ming returned, he sent Xu Yueping to Silvervine Town to deliver a message. In fact, after the old hunters from other villages recovered their wits, they also went to report. Soon, some raptors were released into the night sky, and the remaining forces of each family began to send for aid from Scarlet Cloud City, informing them of the immense risk that had emerged here. That night, experts from Scarlet Cloud City set out. Saving people was like fighting a fire; there was no room for delay. Even a moment's delay could result in many deaths.

The mutated creatures in the mountains had not intended to wipe out everyone, fearing bloody retaliation from Scarlet Cloud City. In the dead of night, they began to retreat. Before the experts from Scarlet Cloud City even arrived, the crisis resolved itself. All families suffered losses, some more, some less. Cao Long, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, and others were in the inner regions of the Great Rift Valley, and even then, their numbers were reduced. Some families lost two to three tenths of their members, while others lost as many as four to five tenths, like the Huang family. Of course, the most tragic were Golden Rooster Ridge and the Three-Eyed Sect, who were at the entrance and were almost completely annihilated. In the end, only a few old men from these two factions, covered in blood, stumbled out supporting each other. The great bandits of Golden Rooster Ridge, their two leaders, were furious upon hearing the details. They almost went to kill the survivors themselves, cursing them as useless, even worse than a group of mountain dwellers. The core figures of the Three-Eyed Sect in this region were also stunned upon hearing the news, almost spitting blood.

The next day, Qin Ming, Old Man Liu, and others went to see them off, as Cao Long, Mu Qing, Wei Zhirou, and the rest were leaving. From the appearance of the special node to the competition for mysterious resources, this mountain-clearing operation was drawing to a close, with the music fading and the audience dispersing.

"Qin Ming, leave this remote place soon. It's truly too secluded. You should enter a grand city, interact and learn more there. That place is rich in treasures, abundant in talent, and blessed by nature..."

"Yes, the world beyond is splendid and vibrant. The glittering cities are incredibly prosperous, where you can see all kinds of creatures, even gods appearing as humans. It's far beyond your imagination."

"Five hundred years ago, Black and White Mountain was renowned throughout the world, but it's not anymore..."

Before parting, they all advised Qin Ming to leave this place soon. During this time, Qin Ming also saw Nie Rui, Shen Jiayun, and others, who enthusiastically came over to greet him. Finally, these people departed into the distance.

***

That night, Qin Ming brought a bag of fruits and melons to see Old Man Liu.

"Fiery Pears, Purple Sun Berries, Silver Melons... boy, where did you run off to? The lair of some powerful mutated creature? Only monsters that have undergone four or more mutations would actively manage a fire field. You're truly something!" Old Man Liu's eyelids twitched in surprise. "Let me think... that old bear is definitely not it; it's lazy, brutal, and filthy. That Mountain Lord, although incredibly powerful, rarely eats plants. That old yellow ox is the most diligent... you didn't go there, did you?!" Old Man Liu was quite astonished.

Qin Ming couldn't help but admire the old man; he knew every detail of the various areas in the mountains, almost like the back of his hand. It was precisely because of this that he had come here. Qin Ming spoke, "Old Man, I was terribly bullied by that bear and that yellow ox, almost killed by them in the Great Rift Valley. When can we go to the place you mentioned to find spiritual substances?"

Old Man Liu glanced at him. "You were persecuted by multiple-mutated creatures and came out unscathed? You brat must have found a loophole, raided their lairs, and now you're acting innocent after getting a huge benefit." Then, he realized that Qin Ming's strength must have significantly improved; otherwise, why would he be so eager to find spiritual substances, longing for another rebirth? "You've completed your second rebirth?" he asked in a lowered voice.

"Mhm, I've been running a fever recently, so it should be almost complete. What about you?" Qin Ming asked.

"Give me two more days, and it should be soon for me too," Old Man Liu said, closing the door. He then added, "Listen, our second rebirths, the two of us, let's not make a fuss about it for now."

"Alright!" Qin Ming nodded.

The two exchanged a knowing smile.

Two days later, Qin Ming and Old Man Liu gathered, researched for a long time, and prepared to enter the mountains!
