# Chapter 88: Rescue, Decisive Strike

Yang Ji did not linger in the Infernal Training Ground. He followed the path he came by, heading back.

But just as he walked a hundred miles, the Lifesense Talismans he carried vibrated with extreme intensity.

“One, two, three, four... a total of fifteen vibrations, almost simultaneously! Could fifteen disciples be in danger at the same time?” Yang Ji pulled out the Lifesense Talismans, his brows furrowing.

He looked in one direction; all the vibrations pointed to his front right.

As Yang Ji pondered, he put away the Lifesense Talismans and stealthily approached the source of the distress signal.

He closed his pores, reined in his aura, and calmed his spirit, not revealing the slightest movement. Yang Ji moved silently along the ground, not letting out a single breath. His breathing was adjusted to be long and ethereal, almost imperceptible. His spirit was internally guarded, without the slightest fluctuation. When he concealed himself, he was like a rock; as long as he wasn’t seen, he wouldn’t be discovered.

Following the guidance of the Lifesense Talismans, it wasn’t long before he arrived at the edge of a valley.

“Earth Demons! A swarm of Earth Demons! How can there be so many Earth Demons!”

Yang Ji’s eyes widened slightly in surprise. Above the valley, groups of Earth Demons soared, roaring in mid-air. The sky for a mile radius was tightly encircled. Inside the valley, bursts of energy fluctuations emanated, and he could vaguely discern several small black dots engaged in combat. The Earth Demons hovered in the air, all looking down into the valley, their high-pitched roars filled with endless excitement.

“Limitless Dao Sect disciples are trapped in the valley? With so many Earth Demons, the disciples below must be in a very bad situation.”

Yang Ji focused his gaze. There were at least several hundred Earth Demons filling the sky. The vast majority of them were observing a battle between two powerhouses: one was a sharp-tempered woman in a purple dress, and the other was an Earth Demon with horns on its head, shaped like a human. Witnessing this, Yang Ji’s pupils contracted slightly, realizing that the one fighting the woman was actually an Earth Demon Emperor—a powerful existence equivalent to a human Soul Transformation cultivator. And for the woman to be able to fight it, she was clearly also a Soul Transformation expert.

“Hmm?” Yang Ji scanned the valley, his expression subtly changing. Around the battle between the two powerhouses, many severely wounded Dao Sect disciples lay on the ground, barely clinging to life. “So many Dao Sect disciples are injured?” Yang Ji frowned deeply, muttering, “They must have fallen into the Earth Demon Emperor’s trap.” As his gaze swept, besides the Soul Transformation female cultivator, he found two other individuals still fighting, defending the injured disciples.

One was a child of about eight years old, not wearing the purple sect uniform, but a white robe. He wore a Sun-Moon Wheel above his head, emanating an extremely vigorous and pure Yang energy. The Sun-Moon Wheel spun above his head, radiating divine light that soared to the heavens. Each beam of divine light shot out was like a full-force strike from a late-stage Nascent Soul cultivator. His face was tender, but his eyes were filled with stubbornness, refusing to retreat an inch. With the Sun-Moon Wheel spinning wildly, radiating divine light, no Earth Demon dared to approach him. He was truly impervious to all evil and untouchable by a thousand demons. What surprised Yang Ji was that the Sun-Moon Wheel was actually a top-grade treasure, no wonder its power was so immense. It was just a pity that the user’s cultivation was a bit low, only at the initial Core Formation stage, making it difficult to fully unleash its power. But even so, no Earth Demon dared to come near.

Besides this child, one other person had not fallen. She was a woman, and she was battling a high-rank Earth Demon King. Although the woman’s strength had reached the Nascent Soul Third Stage, she was being pushed to her limits, barely able to defend herself, revealing openings everywhere.

“Heh heh, such a beautiful human woman, this King likes her.”

A black light flashed around the high-rank Earth Demon King. His hideous face changed, and in the next moment, he transformed into a black-robed man. He moved around her, and in the midst of their battle, he actually showed some tenderness, not striking with full force, clearly toying with her. The inner sect female disciple was in peril under his violent attacks, frequently dodging. Her face was flushed with shame and anger, but she was speechless with rage. Their cultivation realms were similar, but her combat power was significantly weaker than that of the high-rank Earth Demon King.

“Demon, die!” The inner sect female disciple roared, her willow-like eyebrows frosted with anger, her attacks becoming sharper.

“Heh heh, your Limitless Dao Sect opened this training ground, wanting to use our Earth Demon race to temper yourselves. You wishful thinkers. Don’t you know that inviting this King as a sparring partner comes at a great cost?”

The inner sect female disciple retorted, “Earth Demons are cruel, often preying on humans, and everyone has the right to kill them. This sect opened this training ground specifically to eradicate your vile race, to slay all Earth Demons under heaven and restore peace to all cultivators.”

“Heh heh, this King has heard enough grand declarations of righteousness. I never thought they’d sound so solemn coming from your mouth. I was almost startled into believing you, thinking I was some heinous, bloodthirsty demon.” The Earth Demon King continued, “Since you describe our Earth Demon race as so contemptible, then today I shall be a demon. In front of your junior brothers and sisters, I will slowly bite you to death while absorbing your Yin essence. This will be a long process, should be very interesting, heh heh.”

“Shameless fiend, take this sword!” The inner sect female disciple’s delicate face was covered in dark lines, and her body trembled, clearly enraged. Her flying sword whistled around her, constantly transforming into streaks of light, attacking the Earth Demon King. But the Demon King was powerful; he merely slapped away the incoming flying swords with a single palm, chuckling mockingly, “Sword manipulation? Your skill isn’t enough; it won’t even scratch my skin. Go back and practice for a few hundred more years. Oh no, you won’t have the chance.”

“Hahahaha!” The circling swarm of demons cackled incessantly, pointing and gesturing. If not for the Earth Demon King wanting to toy with the inner sect female disciple, they might have rushed down already.

“Following Lord Demon King on this rampage, we’ve eaten plenty of flesh and blood, but we haven’t tasted such tender human female disciples yet! I wonder what they taste like!”

“Heh heh, we’ll soon savor that taste. Lord Yin Demon Emperor will soon dispatch that defiant Soul Transformation female cultivator up there.”

The Earth Demons constantly fantasized, opening their mouths to emit various strange sounds, like wailing women, creating enchanting melodies to bewilder minds and erode willpower. While useless against experts, several injured disciples below instantly fell victim. Listening to the soul-stirring demonic sounds, the several injured female and male disciples below became entranced, their eyes glazed over, as if they had lost their minds. Their souls drifted, wandering, as if about to leave their bodies. Their hearts were empty, as if abandoned by the world; their entire being displayed a hollow state.

Hundreds of Earth Demons emitted demonic sounds. Even Yang Ji, with his strong willpower, was slightly affected. Those disciples with weaker mental fortitude fared even worse, their eyes hollow, like walking corpses, having lost their souls and becoming sluggish.

“Heh heh, these humans are truly weak! With one demonic sound, they all fall!”

“Wake up! Wake up! Wake up!”

In the sky, the Soul Transformation female cultivator battling the Yin Demon Emperor noticed the scene below. She unleashed a sonic divine ability, and the void instantly echoed with the words “Wake up.” Each reverberation was like surging ocean waves, crashing in succession, resounding deep within the souls of every Dao Sect disciple. In just a moment, those Dao Sect disciples who had been bewildered by the Earth Demons instantly awoke. After a brief愣, they realized their predicament and quickly snapped out of it. They had been eating rocks and gnawing on mud, doing all sorts of unbelievable things, which utterly mortified them.

“Damn human woman, you dare to disturb our show! Later, I’ll devour your flesh mercilessly, making you suffer a fate worse than death!”

“Heh heh, that’s Lord Demon Emperor’s meal, how dare you covet it?”

The disciples on the ground, now lucid, listened to these mocking words, their eyes filled with killing intent, yet helpless, only able to fume.

“Sister Liu, what do we do? So many Earth Demons, we’re doomed!”

The Nascent Soul Third Stage inner sect disciple, Sister Liu, blocked in front of everyone, wielding her flying sword, unleashing sharp sword lights that cleaved through the constantly provoking Earth Demon Kings. Hearing her junior sister’s question, she quickly said, “Don’t be afraid. We’ve already sent out Lifesense Talismans for help. Perhaps rescuers are already on their way.”

“Sister, with so many Earth Demons, I’m afraid we won’t wait for the sect’s rescue before we fall victim.”

“Junior Sister, you must not speak such disheartening words. Against Earth Demons, you must have confidence. If your mind shows a flaw, it’s precisely then that you are susceptible to their malice. We must firmly believe that we can defeat the Earth Demons. With no flaws in our minds, no matter how many Earth Demons there are, they are merely whetstones. Isn’t the purpose of our coming here to temper ourselves? Remember not to give up on yourselves,” Sister Liu admonished.

“Heh heh, rescue? Don’t dream.”

“Fear, tremble! The more negative emotions you have, the more excited we become. You’ll be chewier when we eat you later, and it will enhance our power.”

The few Demon Kings speaking were powerful, all initial-rank Earth Demon Kings, emanating auras even stronger than the three Earth Demon Kings Yang Ji had previously slain.

“That inner sect female disciple seems to be unable to hold on. Although she’s at the Nascent Soul Third Stage and her moves are incredibly sharp, she cultivates water-attribute cultivation methods and techniques, which simply can’t inflict much damage on these tough-skinned Earth Demons. At this rate, she’ll exhaust her strength sooner or later.”

“If I were to go back and get reinforcements now, it would probably be too late. By the time I returned, they might all be piles of bones.”

Yang Ji frowned. He immediately ordered the Buddha Child to take the Lifesense Talismans to the base for reinforcements, while he prepared to go down and block that high-rank Earth Demon King. A battle of the same rank, even against a high-rank Earth Demon King, he had no fear. This was the courage his new Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol brought him. The Buddha Child knew the seriousness of the situation and immediately obeyed Yang Ji’s command, heading to the base to find an elder for help.

Just as the Buddha Child departed, the battle below underwent a sudden change.

*Bang!*

With a loud crash, the inner sect female disciple was struck by the Earth Demon King’s palm. She plummeted from high in the air, spitting out a large mouthful of blood with a *噗* sound, her essence, qi, and spirit instantly withered. She had clearly suffered a severe injury.

“Sister Liu!” The child instantly rushed over, shielding her behind him.

“Heh heh, this King is tired of playing. It’s time to end this!”

The high-rank Earth Demon King descended from the sky, his black robe billowing and flapping loudly. A circle of dust stirred up and diffused, obscuring everyone’s vision.

“Heh heh, beauty. You just broke through to the Nascent Soul Third Stage not long ago, yet you could fight this King for three hundred rounds. Truly a peerless beauty with both charm and talent. This King will certainly dote on you well later.”

The Earth Demon King chuckled incessantly, slowly walking forward, with a dense swarm of Earth Demon soldiers swirling behind him, appearing very excited.

“Lord Demon King, hurry and strike! We little ones can’t wait any longer!”

“Haha, it’s time for a feast, time for a feast, how exciting!”

Upon hearing this, the Dao Sect disciples’ expressions changed drastically. They guarded Sister Liu and hastily retreated.

“Fiend, how dare you!” From the sky, the Soul Transformation female cultivator was furious and prepared to charge down, but she was blocked by the Earth Demon Emperor.

“Your opponent is me!” the Earth Demon Emperor said coldly.

The high-rank Earth Demon King glanced up at the sky, then relaxed, a lewd smirk curling at the corner of his mouth. He slowly advanced, adjusting his robes as he walked, much like a gentleman. The Earth Demons were in no hurry to kill the Dao Sect disciples, because they enjoyed seeing terror on others’ faces, finding pleasure in it. Forcing people into the abyss of despair, then appreciating their expressions of collapse and helplessness, was exactly what they liked to do.

“Demon, do you truly mean to kill us? Are you not afraid that our sect’s powerful cultivators will suppress you deep within the Earth Flame, burning your primordial spirit for a thousand years, making you repent in agony?” Sister Liu’s face was exceedingly grim as she sternly rebuked.

“The underground world is the territory of our Earth Demon race! Why should we fear your Limitless Dao Sect?”

The Earth Demon King curled his lips into a malicious smile, then suddenly waved his hand and declared, “Kill all these people.”

“Heh heh, finally time to feast! I can’t wait!”

The countless demons in the sky pressed down, emitting strange cackles, their bloodthirsty faces grotesque and terrifying.

Faster than words could describe, just as the horde of demons was about to pounce on the Limitless Dao Sect disciples, a sheet of sword light suddenly flashed in the air. The sky was filled with incomparably sharp sword qi. The sword qi sliced through the void, making *chi-chi* sounds.

Immediately, sixty percent of the Earth Demons were instantly cut into several pieces, dead beyond dead.

The high-rank Earth Demon King felt a chill down his spine. He turned abruptly, and what met his eyes was a point of extremely sharp white light. It was the deathly glow of a flying sword. Too late to dodge, the high-rank Earth Demon King unleashed a divine ability with a roar, punching out.

*Clang!*

The flying sword rang out, bouncing back. But the high-rank Earth Demon King was also forced back three steps by the single sword strike.

He looked at the blood mist filling the sky, his face now dark, his body trembling, overflowing with rage.

“Damn human! Killing my hatchlings, you deserve to die!” The high-rank Earth Demon King roared, staring fixedly at the sky.

Inside the valley, all the Limitless Dao Sect disciples also turned their heads quickly, looking up. Unbeknownst to them, a figure stood above the valley, like a sharp sword piercing the heavens, radiating a formidable aura.

“Nascent Soul First Stage? Junior Brother, hurry and leave!” Sister Liu saw the newcomer. The sliver of hope on her pretty face vanished, and she quickly warned him.

Yang Ji turned his head, looked at Sister Liu, and said, “Sister, you’ve worked hard. Leave the rest to me. I’ve already sent someone to inform the elders; I believe they’ll be here soon. What we need to do is stall for as much time as possible.”

Turning back, he looked at the raging high-rank Earth Demon King, contemplating, “A high-rank Earth Demon King… I wonder if my Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol can crush you to death.”

The Earth Demon King was furious, his black robe instantly flared up, and he let out a low growl, “Damn human, I’ll tear you apart!”

“Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol!” Yang Ji roared. Behind him, a hundred-zhang-tall Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol emerged with a rumble, connecting with the vast forces of heaven and earth. It unleashed a punch that tore through the sky, fiercely striking the high-rank Earth Demon King.

The high-rank Earth Demon King roared and likewise summoned his own Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol—a Chi You Demon Dharma Idol with horns on its head. The two Dharma Idols filled the space between heaven and earth. Their palms met, primordial energy surged, and heaven and earth trembled violently.

With a *rumble*, fierce energy raged and spread in all directions. With a single move, the Chi You Demon Dharma Idol was actually forced back three steps.

“How is that possible?” The high-rank Earth Demon King’s expression changed, filled with disbelief.

Seeing this, Sister Liu’s eyes flashed with shock: “What a powerful Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol! Perhaps this Junior Brother can truly save us.”

“Sister, his Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol looks somewhat like the True Steel Dharma Idol. I’ve never seen it before. Is it very strong?” A disciple asked, seeing the admiration in Sister Liu’s eyes.

Sister Liu took a deep breath, her emotions slowly calming. A hint of pleasant surprise appeared on her face as she said, “Strong, very strong! You must know that the Chi You Demon Dharma Idol is a powerful existence comparable to the True Steel Dharma Idol. Yet it was forced back just now, and by a Nascent Soul First Stage cultivator whose cultivation is even lower than its user’s. From this, you can see how powerful this Junior Brother’s Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol is.”

“Then… could this Senior Brother’s Heaven and Earth Dharma Idol be our sect’s Limitless Immortal King Dharma Idol?” the disciples asked in astonishment.

“No, but it’s not far off,” Sister Liu said, a joyful expression on her face.
