# Chapter 559: The Nine Heavens Palace Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Array

The moment the thought crossed his mind, Xu Yunfan made his decision.

"Blood Elder Demon."

Xu Yunfan's voice was clear and bright, piercing through the thunderous roars and the ghostly shrieks of the blood sea. His eyes were profound, and the spiritual power around him instantly retracted.

"You are at the end of your lifespan, plagued by the Five Turbidities, and your Six Senses are obscured. Do you truly wish to shatter yourself for someone else's benefit? If you retreat, considering the difficulty of your cultivation, I will allow you to crawl back to the Scripture Pavilion to live out your last days."

"Hahaha!!"

The Blood Elder Demon laughed maniacally upon hearing this. The blood sea seemed to mourn with millions of souls, and the yin-yang ghost face twisted to the extreme.

"It's all over, Xu Yunfan! The Cauldron that could continue my Dao Path was destroyed by you. This body of mine, having suffered through five lifetimes of degradation, has already been completely corrupted by the filth from the depths of the earth. Even if I go back, I won't live for more than ten years. Rather than rotting into mud, I might as well gamble for a chance. I will use your life and your Dao Foundation as a sacrifice to my Filthy Sea. Perhaps, as long as I refine you into the core of the blood sea and absorb your Dao Foundation's origin and luck, I might be able to reverse the filth to purity, forcibly condense a trace of a Filthy Golden Core, and continue my immortal path for another lifetime. This is fate! You were born to be my great medicine!"

Xu Yunfan's mouth twitched slightly.

What nonsense.

Qi Hanfeng was clearly a pawn of disrupted karma, foolishly running in front of him to show off.

The Blood Elder Demon was nearing the end of his lifespan, his fifth life ending, facing the sixth life of degradation.

Not to mention other sects, but within the Primordial Origin Sect, if one did not make preparations in advance and relied solely on their cultivation, this would be the end result in their later years. They become tools for others.

"Truly an old demon. Perhaps killing you will serve as a sacrifice for my own ritual."

The Primordial Origin Sect did not forbid killing, but since someone had come knocking on his door, he couldn't be blamed for what was to come.

Before his words had faded, the boundless Filthy Sea suddenly collapsed inward and condensed.

The towering blood waves rolled up billions of thick, filthy blood-colored threads, viciously wrapping around the core of Xu Yunfan's Purple Mansion Thunder Domain. It was attempting to forcibly peel his Dao Foundation away from the Thunder Pill and corrupt it.

The Blood Elder Demon was now completely insane, burning his remaining lifespan and his life's Filthy Essence. He unleashed the "Blood Sea Erosion Heaven Dao Foundation Seizing Method."

"Stubborn and unenlightened."

The last trace of impatience in Xu Yunfan's eyes completely vanished, replaced by a profound depth.

"Then let me show you what is meant by the right time, the right place, and the right people!"

Xu Yunfan suddenly retracted some of the spiritual power that was deadlocked with the blood sea. Beneath his feet, at the peak of the Divine Cliff's main peak, the great array he had painstakingly managed over the years, spending countless efforts and materials, integrating his complete understanding of the preliminary Dao of Formations and the profound mysteries of the advanced Formation Comprehension, finally revealed its formidable corner to the world for the first time.

"The Nine Heavens Palace Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Array, rise!"

With his low shout, imbued with spiritual will, the entire Divine Cliff seemed to be instantly awakened.

The mountain trembled, and the earth's veins roared.

The massive thunder stone at the peak, serving as the core array eye, erupted with unprecedentedly brilliant thunder light. This light was no longer the singular Divine Cliff purple, but instead differentiated into brilliant gold, blazing fire, deep black water, thick yellow earth, and sharp white gold.

Finally, the two energies of yin and yang blended together, converging into a magnificent, ever-flowing diagram that covered the heavens.

In an instant, the heavens' phenomena changed drastically!

The clouds, as if stirred by an invisible giant hand, formed a massive vortex funnel. The vast might of the heavens was drawn from an infinite height, transforming into rolling pure yang celestial energy that poured into the great array.

The Five Elements' earth veins' energy was forcibly extracted, sorted, and harmonized. The five-colored divine lights of gold, wood, water, fire, and earth shot up to the sky, circulating and rotating to form an impregnable Five Elements boundary wall, which in turn nourished the thunder power within the array.

Even strands of earth's evil energy were drawn in and merged with the thunder, imparting the thunder art with a trace of the domineering heaviness that could suppress the nine abysses and obliterate all demons.

This array was no longer a singular thunder array, but a lethal domain that integrated the foundation of the Five Elements' rotation, the power of yin-yang harmony, the grandeur of heaven and earth's might, and the brilliance of Divine Cliff's thunder.

It was also Xu Yunfan's highest achievement in studying formations over the years.

It drew upon the great power of the eight directions of heaven and earth, and even transformed the spiritual energy of the Divine Cliff's blessed land and the thunder will accumulated over ten thousand years into its own source of power.

At this moment, the Divine Cliff was the largest and most invincible magic treasure in Xu Yunfan's palm.

Standing at the core of the great array, Xu Yunfan's figure merged with the magnificent formation diagram. Facing the sky-pressing Filthy Sea, he made a move that caused all onlookers' hearts to stop.

"Eh?!"

The Primordial Origin Sect's Sect Master, the great realist Tian Yan who was at the peak of the Foundation Establishment stage, had a relaxed and carefree expression, but when he saw this great array appear, a hint of solemnness首次 appeared for the first time.

The formation runes within this great array were not particularly profound or sophisticated, but its structural design was incredibly ingenious. Centered around the Divine Cliff Thunder Summoning Formation, it combined various attribute formations, layer upon layer, interlocking over a thousand of them, yet showed no signs of collapse. Instead, it was extremely stable.

If the roles were reversed and he was caught by this great array, could he resist it?

After pondering for a long time, Tian Yan felt that without using his ultimate trump card, he could only take a detour.

A formation prodigy!?

On another peak, Lu Chuan suddenly stood up, his eyes wide with shock and astonishment.

"He actually has such an ability?"

At this moment, Xu Yunfan actually retracted the Purple Mansion Thunder Domain screen that protected his body. He completely exposed the Purple宸 Myriad Transformation Thunder Mansion Dao Foundation Thunder Pill, which appeared even more miraculous under the reflection of the filthy blood sea, right in front of the Blood Demon.

Xu Yunfan's hands formed a spell seal, and the spiritual power around him surged.

"Purple宸 Myriad Transformation Thunder尊 Form, condense!"

*Hum!*

The void trembled, and the great Dao's resonant sound shook the air.

The deep purple Thunder Pill, covered in thunder origin runes, which was manifested from the Dao Foundation, transformed into a thunder pool. Under the gaze of countless horrified eyes, it violently expanded and took shape.

Countless thunder runes transformed into muscles and bones, the vast thunder energy condensed into boundless majesty, and the power of the Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Array transformed into divine armor that supported the heavens and stood on the earth.

In an instant, a thunder giant form, a hundred zhang tall, wearing a thunder emperor crown, clad in five-colored flowing light, with yin-yang energy forming its cape, stood proudly atop the Divine Cliff.

This Purple宸 Myriad Transformation Thunder尊 Form had a blurred face, only its eyes like two thunder suns condensed from countless calamity thunders. Where its gaze fell, lightning was born in the void, and all evil spirits fled.

Its left hand held a phantom, drawing upon the magnificent might of the entire Nine Heavens Palace Five Elements Yin Yang Thunder Domain Great Array, condensing it into a massive Heavenly Punishment Thunder Halberd, entwined with destructive thunder and vast Divine Cliff runes.
