# Chapter 80: Piercing the Moon

When Zhou Qing returned to his courtyard, Miss Lin was waiting for him outside, holding an ancient book in her hands.

"What treasure have you found this time?" Zhou Qing smiled, knowing that any ancient text brought to him by Miss Lin must be extraordinary.

Miss Lin replied, "This is a martial arts manual found in the Shang Family Fort's treasury. Since you've been having the Princess study and practice martial arts, I thought—given her vast knowledge—she might help sift through some ancient texts for you. She picked out this sword manual from the collection."

Over the years, Zhou Qing had read countless books. To manage this, he had Miss Lin organize rare ancient texts and periodically send them to him for further review, checking which ones he hadn't yet studied. 

This practice was similar to how Buddhist temples had scripture monks assisting their monks in training.

Zhou Qing invited Miss Lin into the courtyard and first assessed her recent progress in martial arts.

"Your form is correct, but your method of generating force is off."

He demonstrated the technique.

This move, derived from the Bird Play and Crane Form techniques, was called "Swallow Returning to the Nest." Light yet deadly, like a scythe cutting grass, the force was concentrated into a single point, akin to a bird's beak or crane's bill. The power was fleeting, like a dragonfly skimming water.

Though it was a single move, it embodied form, intent, and an ethereal aura—carrying a trace of immortality.

Zhou Qing had created this lethal technique with the Princess and Miss Lin in mind, considering their female physiques. It was both a killing move and a health-preserving art.

"Do you understand? The Wing Chun I taught you already carries hints of Crane Fist. Whether it's the Crane Form I gave the Princess or your Wing Chun, both align with 'Swallow Returning to the Nest.' But the force must be pure. Your execution still bears traces of your family's techniques, leading to conflicting energies."

"I see. It's an unconscious habit."

Zhou Qing nodded. "Integrating different methods of generating force is a path all martial arts masters must take. But the techniques must first be refined to purity before merging, then distilled to their essence, forming your own style."

Miss Lin sighed. "Did I start martial arts too late? Even with your guidance, I feel the road ahead is far beyond my reach. I envy the Princess—her talent surpasses mine, and she'll undoubtedly go further. As for me, reaching the Xiantian realm seems nearly impossible." As a businesswoman, calculating gains and losses was second nature to her. To her, martial arts was like a business venture, and she could already foresee its likely failure.

Zhou Qing smiled. "If we're talking about the Xiantian realm, I can tell you that your chances are about the same as many sect leaders'. Achieving Xiantian requires a miracle. It's not something where effort guarantees success."

Had it not been for Zhou Qing's care after Fushong faced the heavenly thunder—using Five Organs Thunder Sound, golden needles, and other methods to help him survive the life-and-death trial—Fushong's best outcome would likely have been permanent paralysis.

And this was after Fushong, before reaching Xiantian, had several opportunities through Zhou Qing: consuming spirit pills and red python flesh, and having his organs cleansed and rejuvenated with Zhou Qing's help.

This showed just how difficult it was for others to reach the Xiantian realm. When something is challenging to an extreme degree, the difficulty becomes nearly the same for everyone.

Miss Lin said, "I'll do my best. Even if I fail, I won't regret not trying."

Zhou Qing chuckled lightly. "Don't be so melancholic. You're acting as if this is a life-or-death matter. You're too young to understand true sorrow. If you persist with what I've taught you, living a hundred years won't be a problem. You still have seventy or eighty years ahead of you—who knows what might happen in that time?"

Who could predict life's opportunities?

Seven years ago, Zhou Qing was merely a child scholar, worrying about exams and basic survival. Now, he was a Xiantian master, ruling Jiangzhou, capable of defending his territory or contending for the empire.

Emperor Gaozu of Han went from a fugitive in the mountains to ruler of the realm in just eight years. 

Emperor Taizu of Ming started with nothing but a bowl—who could have imagined he'd one day rule the world?

And those who stood by these emperors from the beginning were ennobled and achieved heights they'd never dreamed of. 

This was the saying: "When a man attains the Dao, even his pets ascend to heaven." 

Or, in other words, mutual flourishing.

The first to benefit from this wasn't Miss Lin or Butcher Hu, but Fushong. Otherwise, how could his portly senior brother have reached Xiantian?

Zhou Qing chatted and joked with Miss Lin for a while longer, discussing the current state of the world. Details of the northern war had gradually emerged: the capital hadn't fallen, and loyalist armies continued to arrive. The grassland barbarians, poor at siege warfare, seemed to be withdrawing, reportedly due to an agreement between the palace's eunuch grandmaster and the grassland's martial saint.

But in this time, the Anping Sect had grown powerful and wouldn't be easily eradicated.

To Zhou Qing, the situation resembled the late Yuan dynasty.

With rebel princes, barbarian invasions, cult uprisings, regional warlords, and constant disasters, the Great Zhou dynasty's fall seemed inevitable.

"In times of chaos, those who rise first often pave the way for others. Let's wait and see if this Anping leader can withstand the backlash."

If the imperial family wanted to quickly quell the Anping rebellion, their best option would be to have the eunuch grandmaster assassinate its leader—a temporary solution at least.

Perhaps it was a resurgence of spiritual energy.

Even so, the spiritual essence remained exceedingly sparse.

Zhou Qing knew the secrets here were beyond his current understanding. Only by continually increasing his strength could he gain an advantage.

Even in ancient texts, true qi cultivators were rare.

In any era, the path of immortality was fraught with difficulty. Every step forward would be a struggle.

Zhou Qing had already heard of several former top-ten Black List masters failing to withstand the heavenly thunder. Seeing Zhang Jingxiu and Zhou Qing reach Xiantian, they thought they could too—only to face brutal reality.

Certainly, some still coveted the secret to their breakthrough, but none dared act yet.

Zhou Qing pondered silently, then distributed fasting pills to everyone, including Morning Sun.

Feeling his qi and blood brimming, Zhou Qing silently recited the Clear Heart Mantra and the opening of the Great Learning, clearing his mind and entering a mystical state of sensing the world's energy.

At a certain moment.

Thunder rumbled within him, followed by Fushan and Fushong.

Heaven and man in harmony!

A thunderclap exploded across the sky, shaking the mountains.

Rain poured down in sheets!

The world was veiled in rain.

"Move out."

He had observed the celestial signs and knew a great thunderstorm would come to the mountains in a day or two.

In such weather, the demon crane couldn't defeat them nor dare to flee—or it would face the thunder's wrath. Moreover, the crane's fire-breathing ability would be greatly diminished in heavy rain.

With timing on their side, their chances of success were much higher.

The small snake had been tamed by Zhou Qing and kept at home.

Zhou Qing gathered with Zhishan and the others, bringing Morning Sun and the small snake as their guide into the mountains. As they entered the forest again, Zhou Qing silently recited the Fierce Tiger's Killing Scripture, though he didn't manifest the tiger's spectral armor.

He felt like a king of the mountains.

The tiger, also known as the Mountain Lord.

Moving through the wilderness, all his attributes received slight enhancements. If he manifested the tiger armor, his reflexes, speed, and agility would reach another level.

Even passing animals occasionally fell under Zhou Qing's will, obeying him like ghostly minions.

"Perhaps I should spend part of each year living in the mountains, attuning to the energy," Zhou Qing thought. His enhancements in the wild were becoming increasingly pronounced.

But staying too long risked the tiger's bestial nature affecting his subconscious, with adverse effects.

Over decades, Zhou Qing suspected he might even gain some authority of a mountain god.

Especially with deeper integration into the mountain's energy, his communion with heaven and earth would grow. Even against stronger opponents, Zhou Qing might triumph.

At the same time, Zhou Qing faintly sensed three or four forbidden zones that filled him with dread.

"These must be the most terrifying places deep in the mountains, home to some powerful monstrosities."

The most fearsome aura came from where the small snake led them—the demon crane's lair.

Zhou Qing didn't approach immediately. Instead, he told Zhishan, "We'll rest nearby and act when the storm arrives."

"Uncle-Master, will there truly be a thunderstorm in two days?"

"There will. Those at the Xiantian realm can sense the world's energy. If one is skilled in celestial signs, predicting wind and rain is natural," Fushan said.

He happened to be in a brief moment of lucidity.

Ancient renowned diviners, even without Xiantian cultivation, must have had powerful spirits to sense and predict weather.

Thus, their predictions were ironclad, earning widespread acclaim.

"But if we can sense it, so can the demon crane. As an intelligent creature, it's surely highly alert now. If we get any closer, it'll detect us," Zhou Qing said.

Fushan added, "Junior Brother, I have about half a ke (7.5 minutes) of clarity left. Since I'm lucid now, our trip won't be in vain. Let me scout ahead."

With that, he vanished like a wisp of smoke toward the crane's location.

"With Senior Brother's current cultivation, walking on water or leaving no trace in snow is effortless," Zhou Qing mused.

Though Zhou Qing's foundation was deep, his body refinement still lagged behind Fushan's. The key reason was Fushan's dedication—after reaching Xiantian, he'd spent nearly eight years doing nothing but eating, sleeping, and training.

But post-Xiantian progress grew increasingly difficult. Over the past year, Fushan's qi and blood had barely improved, his advancement slowing to a crawl.

In essence, the Xiantian realm came with a grace period—a rebirth of qi and blood, restoring youth.

It was like a second puberty, but in reverse.

After this period, even with utmost effort, progress would slow, often hitting bottlenecks.

Before slipping back into madness, Fushan returned and used telepathy to inform Zhou Qing of the crane's exact location—and the vermilion fruit's. It was a ledge less than three zhang (10 meters) wide, surrounded by steep cliffs. The fruit grew on the mountain face, with three plants in total.

One plant's fruit was unripe; the other two had been eaten clean.

Six unripe fruits remained.

Fushan also mentioned something peculiar about the place—clouds and mist inexplicably gathered there, like an ancient formation.

"Three vermilion fruit plants growing naturally seems unusual," Zhou Qing thought.

The small snake had found the spot by instinct, dwelling there until the crane drove it away. That no other beasts had discovered the fruit earlier was also strange.

Unless they couldn't detect it before.

Fushan's explanation made sense to Zhou Qing.

A formation must have concealed the fruit.

Now, with the formation weakened, the fruit became visible, first noticed by the snake's instincts.

Formations weren't something ordinary Xiantian masters could create—likely the work of ancient qi cultivators. From his recent studies, Zhou Qing concluded that past cultivators leaned toward qi refinement, while body and martial arts rose only in recent millennia.

This was tied to the world's thinning spiritual essence.

With abundant spiritual energy, qi refinement was easier, breaking through to Xiantian less difficult, and spiritual herbs more common—leading to external alchemy's prominence.

Ultimately, it came down to resources.

Recent years had seen increasingly erratic weather. According to Escort Wu, reports of hauntings had risen—partly due to the chaotic times, but also because shifting celestial energies gave ghosts and demons room to thrive.

Perhaps it was a resurgence of spiritual energy.

Even so, the spiritual essence remained exceedingly sparse.
