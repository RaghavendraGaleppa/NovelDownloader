# Chapter 11: The Ancient Tomb

“Sir, please take all these gold, silver, and jewels. I only beg you to spare my humble life. I have an eighty-year-old mother above and a nursing infant below. Please have pity, sir.” The owner of the carriage pleaded desperately, not knowing if he mistook Zhao Di for a bandit himself. However, he had heard clearly how Zhao Di scared off the seven or eight bandits. Since even a group of bandits feared him and only cared about escaping, he naturally had no power to resist Zhao Di.

Having realized this, he remained kneeling, not daring to lift his head, only continuously begging for mercy.

“Stand up, I have something to ask you!” Zhao Di frowned slightly; he wasn't accustomed to speaking with people who were kneeling.

“This humble one will certainly tell the truth and answer every question. There’s no need to stand up or look up; this humble one will not see your esteemed face, so you won't need to silence me, sir.”

This person was quite clever, and his words left Zhao Di with nothing to fault.

“Since that’s the case, suit yourself. I ask you, where did you get these things?”

“This humble one accidentally discovered an ancient tomb, untold thousands of years old. These jewels were all from the tomb. This humble one, out of momentary greed, took them all out.”

“An ancient tomb? Where is this tomb? And does anyone else know about this?”

“Replying to sir, only I know about this matter. This tomb is on a desolate mountain eighty *li* north of Xuanyuan City, specifically at…” The carriage owner dared not conceal anything, explaining in detail how he discovered the ancient tomb, yet secretly feeling alarmed: “I just said that only I knew about this; that was a grave mistake. What if, because of this, this person decides to kill me to keep the secret?”

“So, this ancient tomb is indeed very hidden. If not for a coincidence, you certainly wouldn't have entered it.” After hearing the explanation, Zhao Di believed him seven or eight parts. But this matter concerned the mysterious small cauldron, so he naturally had to ask as clearly as possible.

Unfortunately, his cultivation was still low, and he could not practice the “Soul Searching Technique.” If he reached a high-level cultivation above the tenth layer of the Qi Refining stage, he could use this spell on him and easily uncover the truth of the matter.

To prevent the small cauldron from attracting too much attention, Zhao Di picked out a few pieces of jewelry and jade and said to the carriage owner, “As repayment for saving your life just now, I’ll take these few items. You keep the rest. I trust you won’t go spreading the news about the ancient tomb, will you?”

“Thank you, sir, for saving my life! Thank you, sir, for not killing me! This humble one wouldn't dare. This humble one is not a fool; the more people who know about this ancient tomb, the more endangered my entire family's lives will be. I haven’t even told my parents, wife, or children about this. Moreover, all the jewels from the ancient tomb are already here; this humble one will definitely not have any further involvement with this ancient tomb.” The carriage owner seemed to sense that the other party cared deeply about the ancient tomb, and he assured him as much as possible with his words. He had originally planned to transport these treasures home and slowly enjoy them. Now, he made up his mind that after surviving this great calamity, he must find a secret place only he knew to hide all the treasures first, taking them out in batches when needed.

“Since that’s the case, farewell.” Zhao Di finished speaking, boarded his own carriage, and whipped the horses away. It wasn’t until the carriage was dozens of *zhang* away that the kneeling man slowly looked up and stood up…

Apart from this mysterious small cauldron, all the gold, silver, and jewels were worldly possessions, and none had ancient characters from his previous life carved on them. Naturally, they were not objects Zhao Di was interested in. However, why the owner of that ancient tomb possessed such a small cauldron inscribed with the characters “Qiankun” was indeed something worth pondering. Still, it was highly probable that it was merely coincidentally mixed among ordinary jewels, collected by the tomb owner, and ultimately buried with him.

Regardless, Zhao Di felt that if he had the chance to pass by Xuanyuan City in the future, it wouldn't hurt to explore that ancient tomb, even though it was highly probable that, as the carriage owner said, it was already an empty tomb.

Zhao Di, in his carriage at this moment, had a calm expression. He caressed the mysterious small cauldron through the beast-skin pouch on his chest, but his heart had long since stirred with layers of ripples.

If he remembered correctly, he had seen this small cauldron in his previous life. He had seen some strange and ancient treasures in a miscellaneous book of ancient tales and curiosities, and there was even an illustration of this small cauldron, which made him feel a bit familiar upon seeing this mysterious small cauldron.

He had carefully examined it, and the small cauldron in the beast-skin pouch was not made of bronze. What specific metal it was, or even if it was metal at all, was unclear. This material was neither gold nor wood, giving a naturally formed impression.

The lid of the small cauldron was easily opened, revealing an empty interior. There was nothing inside. Zhao Di discovered that the cauldron’s interior was extremely smooth, with no ancient characters or simple, ancient runic patterns.

Was this small cauldron something used by cultivators, or was it a worldly object? Zhao Di tried to inject spiritual energy into the small cauldron, but he only felt as if it were a mud ox entering the sea—the spiritual energy instantly vanished without a trace, startling him into quickly stopping the energy transmission. If this was something used by cultivators, it was likely beyond his current stage of use.

“Could it be that I’ve stumbled upon great fortune? Is this a magic treasure? Could it really be a magic treasure that only Core Formation stage cultivators can refine and use?!”

Strictly speaking, magic treasures are also a type of high-level spiritual tool, but they require extremely high standards for both refinement materials and the spiritual energy consumed during use. Only cultivators at or above the Core Formation stage can possess and use them. Moreover, magic treasures have an exclusive characteristic: they can recognize a master and become a Natal Magic Treasure connected to the cultivator's mind.

Zhao Di had read about magic treasures in ancient texts, but he had no concept of what a true magic treasure actually looked like.

After Zhao Di drove the carriage for several days, he finally arrived at Luancheng. Compared to the magnificent Xuanyuan City, calling Luancheng a city was a bit of a stretch; calling it a small town would be more appropriate.

Luancheng leaned against the Flowing Cloud Mountain Range to its north, a range spanning over three thousand *li*. The Flowing Cloud Market that Zhao Di intended to visit was located within it.

After the carriage exited Luancheng’s North Gate and traveled for approximately two more hours, it arrived before a village. This village was built at the foot of the mountain, sparsely populated with only about a hundred households. Beyond this village, it was all mountain roads, rendering the carriage useless. Zhao Di dismounted, intending to ask an old farmer working in the fields about the situation in the mountains.

After all, he only knew the approximate location of the Flowing Cloud Market within this mountain range from books. But with the Flowing Cloud Mountain Range being so vast, finding the actual entrance would likely take a lot of effort. If he could ask a cultivator, that would naturally be ideal, but Zhao Di had used his Spirit Eye Technique to check several times and found no other cultivators in the village. Thus, he could only ask some older villagers about the situation.

Generally speaking, to prevent mortals and wild beasts from accidentally intruding, there are always restrictions set up in places where mortals might reach but where cultivators gather, to keep mortals out. For example, the perpetually thick mists in the Grand Canyon of the Nanhua Mountain Range are one of the restrictions set up by the Jian Family to prevent mortals from entering. If a bold mortal were to enter the thick mist, they would immediately lose their direction and, after walking for a period, would eventually return to the outer perimeter of the mist.

Mortals who frequently enter the mountains might know about certain peculiar places in the mountains, and these places are highly likely to be where cultivators reside.

The old farmer cultivating the field indeed mentioned a peculiar place in the mountain range.

According to the old man, he had been to this place more than once, each time drawn by the sound of water resembling a waterfall. However, upon approaching, he only saw ordinary green mountains and trees. He had spent most of a day wandering around, but he could never find where the waterfall was.

Zhao Di asked the old man for the precise location of the peculiar “waterfall.” It was indeed not far from the location of the Flowing Cloud Market marked in his book. Could the waterfall be the entrance to the market?

Zhao Di immediately decided to go investigate that waterfall. Since the carriage was no longer useful, he simply gave it to the old man.

The old man, who had merely answered a few questions, received four fine horses and a carriage as a reward, and was so astonished he couldn't speak for a long time. He dared not actually use the horses and carriage, but instead carefully fed and preserved them, fearing that one day the young rich master would come to reclaim them. It wasn't until more than two years later, when the old man had still not seen the rich master, that he finally considered the horses and carriage his own and distributed them among his descendants.
