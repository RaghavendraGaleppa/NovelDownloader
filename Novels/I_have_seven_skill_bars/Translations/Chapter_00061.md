## Chapter Sixty-One: Wolf Cultivators

The next day.

By the spiritual field, Ding Rui still used his skill slots to complete all his work before sunset. Then, taking the Earth Qi Hoe, he found a patch of ordinary soil nearby, intending to begin his practice.

He first sat on the ground, then removed his shoes, using two toes to grip the hoe's handle. Closing his eyes, he slowly mobilized the True Essence of the 《Earth Qi Art》 from his spleen acupoints, guiding it down his meridians until it reached his toes. With his current quantity and quality of True Essence, although he could transmit it through his shoes into the hoe, it was ultimately not as convenient or quick as using his bare feet.

He didn't care that his actions were peculiar at the moment; he calmly watched as the hoe, imbued with True Essence, effortlessly loosened the soil where it was placed. Clearly, this method was viable. Moreover, since spiritual rice was planted in small patches, loosening the soil, like weeding and pest control, only targeted a single plant. This meant that the use of the Earth Qi Hoe could be perfectly combined with the [Insecticidal Herbicide] skill. In this way, even if adjusting his position after dealing with each spiritual rice plant would waste a little time, the time saved by simultaneously performing all three tasks would undoubtedly be much greater.

Ding Rui couldn't help but move, finding another patch of soil to loosen once more. He could even snatch a short nap in the latter half of the night. Compared to Liu Yun's quality of life when he first became a spirit farmer, Ding Rui's was immeasurably superior!

At this pace, Ding Rui neither neglected farming nor cultivation. Each day, he would also dedicate a portion of his time to practicing his toe-loosening technique. As time passed, his cultivation also steadily grew. When the spiritual rice finally sprouted, and pest control had to be added to his duties, his cultivation time was drastically cut by more than half. He had to work until midnight every day. Holding the Earth Qi Hoe with his toes proved incredibly challenging. However, practice made perfect. With daily, continuous refinement, the duration he could sustain loosening soil with his feet grew longer and longer. Slowly, step by step, he managed to reclaim the cultivation time that had previously been compressed.

After that, Ding Rui's life as a spirit farmer proceeded without further incident. However, the spiritual fields of the entire Xuanfu Sect, due to Ding Rui's retreat to Spiritual Field 520 to diligently cultivate and integrate five cultivation skills, returned to a state of helplessness against the large aphids. This caused the spirit field cultivators to repeatedly express their profound longing for Senior Brother Ding.

Meanwhile, the evil cultivators' combat style of cultivating through slaughter and fueling war with war would undoubtedly make the Sect Domain increasingly difficult to resist, ultimately leading to the complete loss of freedom or life. Yet, even with such a massive topographical advantage, the Sect Domain faced the evil cultivators of the entire Huaqing Realm, making resistance exceedingly difficult. Fortunately, evil cultivators were incapable of trust and cooperation, so most operated alone. There were only a few exceptions. For instance, the tribe of Wolf Cultivators, which had been the biggest headache for the Sect Domain recently!

That night.

On the outskirts of the Sect Domain.
