Chapter 490: Having a Shared Origin is a Good Thing!

Just one glance, without the need for any verbal proof, the deepest resonance of the Dao脉 (veins of the Dao) and the unspeakable instinctual sensing of a peak existence in the Way of the Sword from the depths of his soul instantly turned Xu Yunfan's speculation into irrefutable evidence!

Without the slightest hesitation, and not even having time to confirm his own condition, Xu Yunfan moved with the utmost speed, flipping himself up with practiced familiarity. He then bent his knees and, with a "thump," performed the most solemn disciple kowtow of the Dao Sect, his forehead touching deep into the intangible ground formed by the void, which felt as warm and gentle as water.

"Ancestor above! Please accept the kowtow of the nineteenth-generation true disciple of the Dao Sect, Xu Yunfan!"

His voice trembled slightly due to excitement and weakness, yet every word was clear, filled with reverence and respect from the bottom of his heart.

Just kidding, this was the Pure Yang Ancestor of the Dao Sect from a thousand years ago, and now the Pure Yang True Lord of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect. Naturally, Xu Yunfan had to put on a good show.

Regardless of his inner thoughts, Xu Yunfan naturally had to appear sincere, treating Lu Chunyang as an idol.

The chance for him to jump out of this situation was right before his eyes, and he absolutely had to grasp it firmly.

With the identity of a Dao Sect disciple from the Divine Martial World, Xu Yunfan now had a plan.

He was already certain in his heart.

The person before him was none other than the brilliant and outstanding Pure Yang Ancestor, Lu Chunyang, from a thousand years ago in the Divine Martial World, who single-handedly changed the fate of the small world, ultimately broke through the realm to ascend and reached the Taihua Spirit Ruins World!

Xu Yunfan's mind raced, quickly connecting the information he knew. A thousand years ago, the Divine Martial World had just been discovered and had not yet been fully taken over by the Primordial Origin Sect. The three behemoths—the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, the Bodhi Pure Land, and the Primordial Origin Sect—fiercely competed for it, erupting in a shocking混战 (chaotic battle).

It was in that chaotic, war-torn time that the Pure Yang Ancestor made a grand entrance. Relying on his supreme sword cultivation, he engaged in coalition-building and established a connection with the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect. At the Land Immortal realm, he fiercely repelled the joint attack of the strong from the Primordial Origin Sect and the Bodhi Pure Land amidst a hundred thousand troops, successfully protecting and integrating the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, which was in a precarious situation at the time, into the Divine Martial World.

After stepping into the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, Lu Chunyang顺势 (took the opportunity to) join the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.

With his unparalleled talent and comprehension, he rose meteorically. Finally, at a critical juncture near the end of the great war between the three sects, when all the True Lords were too busy to pay attention elsewhere, he broke through his limits and fiercely achieved the realm of a True Lord in the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, becoming the Pure Yang True Lord.

Xu Yunfan naturally called out "Ancestor," almost with tears and snivel.

"Years have passed悠悠 (leisurely) for a thousand years. Today, I finally get to see the Pure Yang Ancestor. The Ancestor's appearance of returning to simplicity and nature, and your aura that seems to be one with the Dao—your cultivation realm must have been forged through hardship!"

This was something Xu Yunfan could say effortlessly, with practiced ease.

As a skilled expert at clinging to powerful figures in his previous life, such flattering words came to him naturally.

On the meditation cushion, Lu Chunyang's clear and profound eyes闪过 (flashed) a barely perceptible hint of surprise, which then transformed into a complex, indescribable meaning.

He did not rush to respond to Xu Yunfan's grand salute, his gaze lingering for a moment on the figure prostrated on the ground.

Xu Yunfan lay prostrate in the void, his mind clear and transparent.

He knew well that in front of an existence like his ancestor, whose cultivation was as vast as the heavens, any concealment would be like trying to hide a bell while holding it—only to reveal his lack of sincerity.

With a thought, the two methods of concealing his aura that had been operating within him were quietly undone.

One was a technique derived from the Tortoise Breath Concealing Spirit Art and the Azure Dragon Thunder Pearl Locking Calamity Suppressing Fortune Method, and the other was the effect of the Heavenly Mechanism treasure, the Hazy Concealing Star Ring, which he had shut down voluntarily.

With the two layers of concealment gone, Xu Yunfan even actively circulated the Rising Sun One Qi Art. The aura from his body, stemming from the direct lineage of the Divine Martial World's Dao Sect and its most orthodox foundational cultivation method, immediately弥漫 (spread) without reservation, clearly and unmistakably revealed under the sword intent's brilliance of the Pure Yang Cavern Heaven.

This action, silent yet more eloquent than words, was the most honest and irrefutable explanation of his identity and origins.

As expected, the moment Xu Yunfan removed his concealment, the playful, untamed smile on Lu Chunyang's exceptionally handsome face froze slightly.

His slender, jade-like fingers subconsciously tapped the edge of the meditation cushion beside him, and the light from several stars in the surrounding void that governed "insight" and "tracing the origin" of sword intent brightened slightly.

There was no need for Xu Yunfan to say another word; the aura from the same origin and lineage was instantly captured and perceived by him.

"I didn't expect to encounter a true seed of the Dao Sect here."

Lu Chunyang's voice finally rang out, calm and even, yet carrying a hint of an indiscernible, distant emotion. "I never thought that in this Taihua Spirit Ruins World, I would see a disciple of the Divine Martial World's Dao Sect emerge from that world... Fate is truly marvelous. Rise and speak."

He made a gesture of helping him up, and a gentle yet resilient will lifted Xu Yunfan to his feet.

Xu Yunfan rose as instructed, standing with his hands clasped respectfully. The dissipating True Wu Subduing Demon Power within him, touched by that gentle will, miraculously began to coalesce and stabilize on its own, and his injuries eased considerably.

"Since you have come from the Divine Martial World,"

Lu Chunyang looked at him, his gaze calm, and directly asked the question on his mind.

"How is the Dao Sect now?"

It had been over a thousand years since he left the Divine Martial World. Later, the world was completely controlled by the Primordial Origin Sect, and its spatial通道 (channel) was sealed. Even now, as a Golden Core True Lord of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, holding a high position, he could not pry into the details of his old world without the Primordial Origin Sect's approval or paying a great price to forcibly break through.

The Dao Sect remained an indelible concern in his heart.

"Reporting to the Ancestor!"

Xu Yunfan's spirit lifted. He thought to himself, "Just as I expected," and the suspended heart finally settled. With this shared origin, what was there to worry about in the future?

He quickly bowed and answered, his tone filled with pride and a hint of imperceptible bitterness, "This disciple was already at the Land Immortal realm before entering the Taihua Spirit Ruins World. The Dao Sect has long since fully grasped the Divine Martial Universe and has become the undisputed, universally revered doctrine of our Divine Martial World!

This disciple, bearing the great kindness of the sect and remembering the responsibility of the lineage, faced numerous dangers after entering the Taihua Spirit Ruins World and finally brought several senior masters, my own master and several martial uncles, out of the Divine Martial World.

Now, we have all been accepted as disciples under the Primordial Origin Sect and have successfully established the 'True Wu Peak' lineage within it!

Though we are living under another's roof, we have at least passed on the spark of the Dao Sect to this world!"

To be fair, this could be considered as bringing glory to the sect. Although the main cultivation now is the True Wu Subduing Demon Sutra, the roots of the Dao Sect are still there.

The most important thing is that the Primordial Origin Sect is truly magnanimous and accommodating. If he were to go to the outside world to establish a sect, he would probably have people knocking on his door to cause trouble in no time. To dare to open a sect without paying respects to the local power is simply courting death.

"Fully grasped the universe, becoming a state religion..."

Lu Chunyang repeated the words in a low voice, a trace of reminiscence and relief flashing through the depths of his eyes. He then轻轻 (lightly) nodded, understandingly saying, "So that's how it is. To have joined the Primordial Origin Sect... this is the only way out for the beings of the Divine Martial World now."

His tone carried a sense of understanding.

He naturally knew the hardships involved.

Back then, he had taken advantage of the chaotic battle between the three sects, challenging the two powerful factions with his sword, turning the tide at the most critical moment for the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect, and displaying a peerless talent, which allowed him to be exceptionally accepted by the previous sect master of the Myriad Chariots Sword Sect.
