Chapter 51: Bing Tuozi's Missing Person Poster, Descending the Mountain, and Pursuing the Culprit

"Help you?" Li Mo couldn't help but feel puzzled.

Bing Tuozi, or Ying Bing, was not one to ask for help from others. Her character was as icy as her name suggested.

Ying Bing sat down at the stone table, pouring tea with a habitual motion. Her calm and serene face showed a hint of confusion.

"Come closer and listen," she said, clearing her throat.

Li Mo hesitated for a moment before sitting down across from her. "What's going on? You're making it sound like a big deal."

Ying Bing's eyes sparkled as she asked, "Will you be going to Zi Yang Prefecture City for the sect's mission?"

"I haven't accepted a mission yet," Li Mo replied, "but I do plan to look for one in Zi Yang Prefecture City. I've been here for a while, and I haven't had a chance to explore the city yet."

He leaned back in his chair, hands clasped behind his head, and smiled. "It's not like I'll be busy. If you have something on your mind, feel free to tell me."

Ying Bing's gaze remained steady, her voice calm. "I want you to help me find someone. She's probably a beggar now."

As she spoke, her frosty demeanor seemed to thaw slightly, and Li Mo noticed a hint of nostalgia in her eyes.

"I wasn't able to join the Qing Yuan Sect back then," she continued. "I had to stay in an abandoned house in Zi Yang Prefecture City, where I met Jiang Chu Long. We helped each other out, and she was the one who assisted me in opening my meridians."

Li Mo listened intently, intrigued by the story. "You want me to find her and arrange for her living arrangements?"

Ying Bing nodded.

Li Mo was taken aback. This was not the Ying Bing he knew. She was always so aloof and detached. "Is she a relative of yours?" he asked.

Ying Bing's family had been killed in a beast disaster, so Li Mo couldn't understand why she would be so concerned about someone.

Ying Bing handed Li Mo a piece of paper and a brush. "Draw a portrait of her, if you remember what she looks like."

Li Mo took the brush and paper, eager to help. As he waited for Ying Bing to draw, he thought to himself that helping her would surely bring a good reward from the system.

After a while, Ying Bing handed him a drawing. Li Mo's expression turned serious as he examined the abstract artwork.

"Ying Bing," he said, "is there really someone who looks like this?"

The portrait was more like a Picasso painting than a realistic representation of a person. Li Mo couldn't help but wonder if he was expected to find someone based on such an abstract image.

"Um?" Ying Bing responded, looking up at Li Mo.

Li Mo hesitated, unsure how to proceed. "I'm just saying, couldn't you have drawn a more realistic portrait?"
