# Chapter 237: The Meeting

Li Shiming stood atop the mountain peak, the breeze ruffling his hair. His body seemed on the verge of being lifted by the wind.

"A good wind lends me its strength, sending me soaring into the azure skies."

This wasn't just a feeling—if he didn't control his body, he truly might have been carried away by this gentle breeze. His Dao body was now completely transparent inside and out, as pure as flawless crystal.

The effects of his training in the "Diamond Body Protection Divine Art" and "Sword Demon Secret Codex" remained, yet none of the physical traces typically left by body cultivation were visible on his Dao body. Both his body and spirit had reached a certain bottleneck, blocked by an insurmountable mountain from further enhancement.

Li Shiming guessed this was likely the limit of the Foundation Establishment stage. Any further improvements to his body and spirit would have to wait until he reached the Golden Core stage.

Over the past year, he had consumed over three hundred top-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills," and his spiritual power had reached the late stage of mid-Foundation Establishment. The speed of his progress even frightened him, so he usually circulated the "Shadow Demon Buddha Form Technique" when going out, maintaining his cultivation level at the early stage of mid-Foundation Establishment.

Yet, he couldn't bring himself to stop taking the top-grade pills. Such rapid strengthening increased his power and left more time for future cultivation. He had heard of cultivators who spent too much time in the Foundation Establishment stage, only to reach the Golden Core stage with a hundred fewer years of cultivation than their peers, ultimately aging and dying within the Golden Core stage.

Every day he cultivated faster now meant an extra day of cultivation time in the Golden Core stage. The lifespan of a Foundation Establishment cultivator was two hundred years, while a Golden Core cultivator could live up to five hundred years. Though this seemed long, the time spent cultivating passed quickly.

This was why Elder Su only met with his disciples once a month—each of his cultivation sessions lasted nearly a full month.

After consulting the sect's records, Li Shiming confirmed that his current Dao body was now a "Flawless Dao Body." However, the Flawless Dao Body was supposed to be an innate condition, not something achievable through cultivation. Who would have thought that the "Purple Qi from the East" technique could forge such a body?

The benefits of the Flawless Dao Body were numerous, the greatest being a multiplicative increase in affinity with spiritual energy. He had already noticed this in his cultivation—his absorption efficiency of the top-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pills" had improved. Previously, after each cultivation session, the excess medicinal energy from the pills would linger in his body for a while before being either absorbed or expelled. But now, during each session of practicing the "Nine Heavens Thunderstrike Art," he could fully absorb the medicinal energy of a single top-grade "Shushan Yellow Spirit Pill."

Li Shiming's current use of "Lotus Steps" allowed him to cover 260 meters with each stride, a testament to his enhanced spiritual power. Additionally, his Crimson Sun Spirit Fire had also benefited, reaching the peak of the second rank with some peculiar changes.

The Crimson Sun Spirit Fire was inherently a supreme yang flame, and the innate purple qi was also a supreme yang energy of heaven and earth. Under the influence of the purple qi, the spirit fire underwent mysterious transformations, significantly increasing its power. Li Shiming had a strong feeling that the Crimson Sun Spirit Fire might now be capable of refining third-grade medicinal herbs.

Having inherited the "Shushan Alchemy Canon," a specialized fire-based alchemy tradition, his judgment in this area was unlikely to be wrong. He was considering whether to attempt refining third-grade spirit pills now, which would elevate him to the status of the second alchemy master in the Shushan Sect.

Of course, even if he became an alchemy master, he would still be far from Elder Ma. His current realm limited him—without reaching the Golden Core stage, he could at most refine the lowest-tier third-grade pills suitable for early Golden Core cultivators. High-quality third-grade pills requiring premium ingredients could only be refined by Golden Core alchemy masters.

"Forget it, I'll wait until the Crimson Sun Spirit Fire reaches the third grade," Li Shiming dismissed the idea of advancing prematurely. In truth, his foundation in alchemy was already extremely solid.

Over the past year, he had wasted no time, refining pills five times a day, with ten cauldrons each session—fifty cauldrons daily. By now, the spirit pills stored in his spatial ring could likely sustain a major sect for several years. This was despite having sold a portion through the sect and the Northern Shu Trading House.

The trading house had also provided him with various materials, enabling him to continue his research.

"It's time for another trip," Li Shiming murmured, recalling another matter.

Over the past year, Li Yuanba of the Senluo Sect had also advanced to mid-Foundation Establishment. The "Purple Qi from the East" had caused peculiar changes in Li Yuanba's Dao body.

In his human form, he exuded supreme yang energy, paired with his peerless appearance, giving him an immortal aura, like a banished celestial. But in his corpse-refining state, he became the epitome of extreme yin energy—standing three and a half meters tall, with skin black and glossy, crimson eyes, and protruding fangs, bearing no resemblance to his human form.

Strangest of all, his corpse-refining state's defensive capabilities rivaled even Jiang Chen's. The extreme yin energy was terrifying—any strike inflicted far greater damage than Jiang Chen's pure yin spiritual energy attacks.

Jiang Chen was a peak Iron Corpse, a high-tier undead. Were it not for Jiang Chen being Li Yuanba's life-bound corpse, controlling him would have been nearly impossible.

Li Yuanba wasn't sure what these changes meant, but he was certain they weren't harmful. Like Li Shiming, he had used the "Fresnel Reflector" to cultivate "Purple Qi from the East," but his Dao body showed no signs of becoming a Flawless Dao Body. Instead, his human form was transforming toward pure yang, while his corpse-refining state leaned toward pure yin, creating a balance. Yet, he found no relevant information about such a Dao body.

Perhaps Li Yuanba's innate talent surpassed Li Shiming's—after a year of cultivating "Purple Qi from the East," its effects became less noticeable, indicating his Dao body had reached saturation with the innate purple qi. Li Shiming, with his inferior innate talent, had taken twice as long to reach this point.

Of course, it was hard to say whether Li Yuanba or Li Shiming benefited more—their Dao bodies had developed in entirely different directions.

With his stock of top-grade pills exhausted, and the top-grade "Shushan Primordial Pills" being only suitable for early Foundation Establishment, Li Yuanba had no choice but to seek more.

After his final session of "Purple Qi from the East," Li Yuanba stored the Fresnel Reflector. Further attempts would have to wait until the Golden Core stage.

Suppressing his sword light, he flew toward the Ten Thousand Swords Peak. As a mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, he was now a core combatant among the Senluo Sect's disciples.

Having trained in the "Sword Intent Soaring Art," even without other techniques, his pure swordsmanship allowed him to face any opponent in the Foundation Establishment stage.

Upon entering the Ten Thousand Swords Peak, a sweep of his divine sense revealed that Elder Sword's cave abode had opened its formation—a sign the elder had finished cultivating. After a moment's thought, Li Yuanba turned and flew toward the elder's abode.

Speaking of divine sense, Li Yuanba had begun cultivating the "Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Art" over half a year ago. After a hundred days, he had fully converted his spiritual awareness into divine sense.

The "Sword Intent Soaring Art" included tempering techniques for the spirit, supplemented by "Purple Qi from the East" and the "Thousand Hammers Spirit Forging Art," enabling him to develop divine sense at the Foundation Establishment stage. This alone placed him above most true disciples. The rarity and difficulty of spirit cultivation techniques meant few true disciples could achieve his level, even if they obtained such techniques.

"Enter," came Elder Sword's voice as soon as Li Yuanba arrived outside the cave.

"Disciple pays respects to Master!" Li Yuanba entered and bowed deeply.

"Good, just as your grandmaster said—you reached mid-Foundation Establishment in a year," Elder Sword remarked with a satisfied smile. Since Ancestor Lu had shown favor and importance toward Li Yuanba, the elder had grown even more fond of this disciple.

"Master, I've come to inform you of my plans to leave the sect for a time," Li Yuanba said with a bow.

He needed to meet with his true self, Li Shiming, to obtain more cultivation pills and deliver a set of Golden Core formation resources. Ultimately, these resources would be refined by Li Shiming anyway—keeping them with himself was far less secure.

"Mid-Foundation Establishment is a good time to travel, but be cautious. News of you obtaining Golden Core resources has spread. You may face trouble," Elder Sword warned, though he didn't oppose the trip.

As for Li Yuanba's safety, the elder wasn't overly concerned. With the Sword Intent Prayer Beads, Li Yuanba could slay even an early Golden Core cultivator. The beads contained sword intent nourished by a late Golden Core swordsman—a single strike could intimidate most Golden Core cultivators.

Moreover, Li Yuanba's own strength was considerable. As a mid-Foundation Establishment swordsman, he could easily contend with late-Foundation Establishment ordinary cultivators. Swordsmen weren't greenhouse flowers—slaughter was key to their growth.

"Thank you for the warning, Master. I'll be careful," Li Yuanba said, surprised by the potential trouble. He then added, "I'd like to request passage through the Boundary Mountain checkpoint."

"Is the Hundred Thousand Mountains not enough for you?" Elder Sword grumbled but still manipulated his identity token.

Li Yuanba's token received authorization to pass through the checkpoint—not just the Senluo Sect's but also the righteous sects' territories. Such private travels, as long as they didn't involve large groups, were considered exchanges.

After bidding farewell, Li Yuanba left the Ten Thousand Swords Peak and flew beyond the sect. His departure quickly drew attention from various factions.

Following typical demonic cultivator logic, crucial items like Golden Core resources would naturally be carried on one's person—no other storage method felt secure. Thus, most assumed Li Yuanba had the resources with him, which wasn't incorrect.

Shortly after his departure, many demonic cultivators left the sect, and numerous messages were dispatched. While the Senluo Sect forbade internal conflicts within its grounds, it couldn't regulate activities outside. Resource competition was ingrained in demonic cultivators' nature, a reality they faced from their first day in the cultivation world.

As he flew, Li Yuanba sensed something but merely smiled. Combat didn't concern him. At mid-Foundation Establishment, he faced minimal realm suppression, allowing him to unleash his full swordsmanship even against late-Foundation Establishment opponents.

Moreover, since his sword intent had transformed, he hadn't tested the power of his supreme yang sword intent. This trip presented an opportunity to see how it fared against demonic cultivators.

At the Shushan Sect, Li Shiming informed his two masters of his planned excursion. Neither Elder Su nor Elder Ma objected. With Li Shiming's status, he commanded respect wherever he went. As long as he avoided demonic sect territories, danger was unlikely.

No sooner had Li Shiming left the sect than Ji Hongbo quietly departed with a group of Foundation Establishment cultivators.

Ji Hongbo had kept a low profile over the past two years. After his covert actions against Elder Su—though the elder hadn't retaliated—he knew his father, Elder Ji, had paid a price to settle the matter.

Never one to remain idle, Ji Hongbo had spent these two years monitoring Elder Su's faction. With Li Shiming's rise, he noticed the growing influence of the young alchemist.

Previously, the competition for Nascent Soul resources between Elder Ji and Elder Su had been evenly split. But with Li Shiming's advancement to senior alchemist and his potential to become an alchemy master, the scales were tipping in Elder Su's favor. Once Li Shiming became an alchemy master, many neutral elders would likely side with Elder Su, solely due to his prodigious disciple.

This wasn't akin to Elder Su's friendship with Elder Ma—the master-disciple bond was far stronger, ensuring Elder Su's influence over Li Shiming.
