# Chapter 18: Opportunity  

Not long after, the unconscious Qi family cultivator in his thirties at the third level of Qi Refinement gradually woke up. After receiving treatment, he was out of danger.  

However, several horses with a trace of demonic beast bloodline were lost, along with a small portion of the goods and a few Qi family mortal martial artists who suffered injuries—all collateral damage from the residual effects of the spells.  

Ultimately, there were no major issues. After a brief rest, the caravan continued its journey.  

With the presence of a late-stage Qi Refinement elder, the remainder of the trip was peaceful and uneventful.  

The caravan successfully arrived at the Murong family's spiritual land, Little Swallow Mountain, stayed for a few days, and then returned to the Qi family.  

"This time, the caravan was ambushed, and everyone worked hard. In my personal capacity, I'll reward each of you with ten low-grade spirit stones!"  

On the return journey, the late-stage Qi Refinement elder smiled warmly.  

The reason she had secretly accompanied the trip to the Murong family was not only because the goods were valuable but also because she had important matters to discuss with them. Now that both the delivery and negotiations were successfully completed, she was in high spirits.  

Additionally, the belongings of the rogue cultivators had all ended up in her possession, so it was only fair to share some of the spoils.  

Upon hearing this, Qi Feng grinned, thinking his third grandmother had specially arranged this reward for him.  

The other thirty-something cultivator at the third level of Qi Refinement, who had been somewhat depressed since his injury, felt slightly comforted by the ten spirit stones.  

As for Qi Chuan, he was naturally pleased with this unexpected windfall.  

As time passed, the caravan eventually returned to Red Maple Valley.  

The handover procedures were not Qi Chuan's concern. He went straight to the mission hall on the main peak to report the completion of his task and received five contribution points.  

Five contribution points might not seem like much, but some family tasks only offered one or two points and took far longer to complete.  

This mission had only taken a month and a half. Although there had been some unexpected events, the presence of a late-stage Qi Refinement elder meant there was virtually no real risk.  

Thus, Qi Chuan was quite satisfied with the reward.  

After all, early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators only received two spirit stones per year as stipends. This time, he had essentially earned two and a half years' worth of stipends...  

"Never mind that. I should go exchange for some pills first."  

Setting aside his thoughts, Qi Chuan headed to the exchange pavilion and met with the elder in charge.  

"Elder, I'd like to exchange for Qi Condensing Pills," Qi Chuan said.  

"No problem. How many do you want?" the elder asked.  

Qi Chuan took out his family token and the ten low-grade spirit stones. "Can I use a mix of contribution points and spirit stones for the exchange?"  

"Of course. One contribution point equals one low-grade spirit stone," the elder replied casually.  

"Then I'll take five."  

For Qi Chuan, improving his cultivation was the top priority. There was no need to hoard contribution points or spirit stones—he would use whatever he had.  

Soon, Qi Chuan held five Qi Condensing Pills in a jade vial.  

With the pills in hand, he returned to his private mountain peak.  

Upon arrival, he found Second Elder Qi Bai Cang there, seemingly not out on any errands.  

"Perfect timing. I was just about to prepare a feast of spiritual dishes. Let's enjoy it together," Qi Bai Cang said cheerfully upon seeing Qi Chuan return.  

Although the spiritual herbs on his peak weren't particularly valuable, they were still edible. However, their effect on cultivation was negligible—the quality was simply too low. Even with Qi Chuan's care over the past two years, the herbs had only improved slightly, remaining largely insignificant.  

Qi Chuan naturally agreed.  

Soon, the two sat down to enjoy the spiritual dishes.  

"How was your mission? Smooth sailing?" Qi Bai Cang asked casually between bites.  

"There were some incidents, but nothing serious."  

Qi Chuan briefly recounted the events of the journey, glossing over his battle with the third-level Qi Refinement rogue cultivator and emphasizing that the presence of the late-stage elder had ensured their safety.  

"Such a thing happened! Well, at least it turned out fine. The last time I escorted a shipment to the Murong family, we only had a fifth-level Qi Refinement cultivator guarding us, but the journey was completely uneventful," Qi Bai Cang remarked with surprise.  

"Outdoor missions are like that. You never know what might happen..." Qi Chuan shook his head.  

After some more conversation, Qi Bai Cang seemed to remember something. "By the way, I heard something interesting in the family recently. For the upcoming Fengyue Sect disciple recruitment, our Qi family apparently has one inner sect quota!"  

"An inner sect quota?" Qi Chuan looked up, his interest piqued.  

Previously, he had only heard about the general recruitment and assumed it was for outer sect disciples. He had never known the Qi family had an inner sect spot allocated!  

This was the first he was hearing of it.  

If he could join the Fengyue Sect as an inner sect disciple right away, it would be infinitely better than starting as an outer sect disciple.  

Qi Bai Cang nodded emphatically. He, too, had been astonished when he first heard the news. An inner sect quota in the Fengyue Sect was extremely valuable—it was said that the sect's core disciples were selected from among the inner sect members.  

And core disciples of the Fengyue Sect were essentially groomed as candidates for Foundation Establishment!  

In a cultivation family like the Qi clan, a single Foundation Establishment expert could become a revered ancestor, bringing glory to the family for two centuries.  

Even if one remained mediocre after entering the inner sect, they would at least reach late-stage Qi Refinement by the time they left, securing a high-ranking position as a family elder upon return.  

Thus, it was easy to imagine how significant this inner sect quota was in the eyes of lower-tier cultivators like Qi Bai Cang.  

"However, it's said this quota is already spoken for. Rumor has it that the Transmission Elder has a descendant with fourth-grade spiritual roots. At just twelve years old, they're already at the third level of Qi Refinement and might even break through to mid-stage Qi Refinement before the quota is finalized. A true prodigy."  

Qi Bai Cang sighed with admiration. "With such talent, even if they don't reach Foundation Establishment, they'll still return as a late-stage or even peak Qi Refinement cultivator, with a bright future ahead."  

"Fourth-grade spiritual roots, already at the third level of Qi Refinement, with a chance to reach mid-stage?" Qi Chuan murmured.  

"Indeed. But I've also heard that aside from the inner sect quota, our Qi family has three outer sect spots. You might have a shot at one of those," Qi Bai Cang said encouragingly.  

His own descendant was also twelve and already at the second level of Qi Refinement. With some effort, if they could advance to the third level before the selection, they might stand a chance at securing an outer sect position.  

"By the way, how's your cultivation going? Any major issues?" Qi Bai Cang asked again.  

"It's... going fine. No major problems," Qi Chuan replied.  

In truth, he was already at the third level of Qi Refinement.  

His next step was to accumulate spiritual energy to reach the peak of the third level. This process was straightforward—just diligent cultivation. The only variable was whether he used pills to speed it up.  

If there was any real obstacle, it would be the mid-stage bottleneck.  

Honestly, even though his cultivation had been smooth so far, the mid-stage bottleneck remained an unknown. Logically, with his low eighth-grade spiritual roots, breaking through should be extremely difficult.  

But with his hundredfold amplification, perhaps it would make a difference.  

And if he could reach mid-stage Qi Refinement, even with his low-grade roots, he might just have a shot at competing for that inner sect quota!
