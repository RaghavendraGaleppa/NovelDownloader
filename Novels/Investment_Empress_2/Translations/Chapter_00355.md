# Chapter 355: The Best Actor and Actress Perform Together!

The next morning, at dawn.

"So close, just a little bit more."

Li Mo, who had been defeated more than a dozen times yesterday, woke from his dream, the golden-red flames in his eyes slowly extinguishing.

To be honest, Little Li was starting to get anxious.

Challenging the same boss and getting killed over a dozen times in a row, with each death being different, would make any normal person's blood boil.

Moreover, he had genuinely experienced the crisis of life and death more than a dozen times. Yet, in the end, he still seriously calmed his temper. At the time, he had thought that no matter what, he couldn't let the Ice Cube laugh at him when he woke up the next day...

The sunlight outside was just right, illuminating the entire guest room with a radiant glow.

"How many times did you lose last night?"

A clear voice came from the tea table.

"I didn't win the first eleven times. As for the last one, he didn't lose."

Li Mo said solemnly, his words implying a win and a loss.

"?"

"Alright, I didn't win a single time. Go ahead and laugh at me."

Li Mo honestly gave up.

"To lose more than a dozen times means you never used a divine weapon and were seriously training yourself. That's very good."

Ying Bing's voice was very soft, and she rarely spoke so much at once.

"!"

Li Mo was stunned and couldn't help but look up at Ying Bing.

She was bathed in the golden morning light, holding a cup and drinking her morning tea. For a moment, it made one think that the phrase "warm jade generating mist" was used to describe a person.

The Ice Cube was as bright as the sunlight outside, a faint smile in her eyes that wasn't mocking, but encouraging and approving.

Li Mo's mood instantly became sunny.

"How did you lose the last time?"

"Sigh, it really was just a tiny bit. I had already knocked away his Sunwheel Golden Wheel, but when I closed in, it suddenly turned into a团 of sunlight..."

Li Mo recounted the battle from last night, asking Ying Bing to help him analyze it.

As he spoke, the two of them packed their few belongings and went downstairs for their last breakfast in the Southern Frontier. After all, by today, they would be back in their hometown of Qinghe County.

The Jiawei Tavern was still bustling in the morning. The Southern Frontier was damp and cold, so the locals had a habit of drinking morning wine, making it lively from early on.

Li Mo led Ying Bing to their usual spot and ordered a few specialty breakfast dishes.

Their arrival caused a moment of silence in the tavern's main hall.

But soon, it returned to normal.

They were indeed famous, and a frequent topic of discussion at the wine tables. But talking was one thing; just like seeing a celebrity in real life, who would dare go up and say hello?

Besides, with the Cold Immortal sitting there.

She had changed back into that blue and white porcelain dress today, which accentuated her slender and delicate figure. Her fair skin, under the light, looked as if it were truly white porcelain.

With her cheeks gently moving and her silent, cold demeanor, it was enough to dispel any stranger's thought of getting close.

She would occasionally dip a soup dumpling in some chili sauce and feed it to Li Mo across the table...

"What should I bring back for Mom and Dad..."

"I've already prepared it."

Ying Bing rubbed the big-headed doll's head.

"!"

Li Mo, whose CPU was already running hot from analyzing the battle details, was momentarily stunned.

When had the Ice Cube become so thoughtful?

It was hard to imagine her going to the streets alone to pick out gifts...

It seemed that during this trip to the Southern Frontier, it wasn't just him who had grown...

"Ice Cube, eat."

Li Mo picked up a soup dumpling dipped in chili sauce and brought it to Ying Bing's lips.

After the Ice Cube ate it, he smiled and said:

"This soup dumpling is a reward for growing up."

"Childish..."

Ying Bing raised her eyes and gave him a slightly helpless look.

After breakfast, he said a few words to the tavern owner and his wife, then walked out the door.

---

Just as he was thinking about whether to say goodbye to the soldiers of the Greenwood Camp and Brother Donglai before leaving, a commotion came from behind him.

It was indeed them.

A group of twenty or so people came down the stairs, making quite a bit of noise.

"Manager..."

"Although I am the mighty Hall Master of the Hundred Beasts Hall, when we're out, call me the Shopkeeper."

"Alright, Hall Master, will our meals and lodging on this business trip be reimbursed?"

"..."

To be fair, these people from the Demonic Sect were well-disguised and wouldn't normally be easily recognized.

But the problem was...

Heavenly尊, Immortal Li, had dealt with the Demonic Sect of Calling quite a lot.

And he had the Eye of Providence. Whenever he felt something was off, he would take a look.

【Name: Luo Yexian】
【Age: 72】
【Bone Constitution: Hundred Beasts Flood Dragon Demon Body】
【Realm: Sixth Stage of the External Scene】
【Destiny: Blue with a hint of Purple】
【Evaluation: The uncle of the Demonic Sect of Calling's Holy Son. Born without a bone constitution, he一路 relied on the Hundred Beasts Blood Refinement of the Demonic Sect of Calling to enhance his aptitude, using a great amount of the Power of All Living Beings. His beast nature is suppressed very well, and he is extremely cautious. Unfortunately, his potential is exhausted, and he has no hope of reaching the External Scene in his lifetime. He once collaborated with Han Zhen, hoping the other party would help him achieve a magical body.】
【Recent Events: Tracing the Power of All Living Beings, he is looking for the mysterious 'Heavenly尊, Immortal Li'. Currently, he can only confirm that the other party is within Greenwood City.】

Li Mo: "..."

It really was a follower of the Demonic Sect of Calling, and even a Hall Master! He might even be the superior of that unfortunate Elder Yin Hua!

It was unfortunate that they happened to stay at the Jiawei Tavern.

It was fortunate that they were under the same roof, yet they had brushed past each other without noticing.

"What is it?"

Ying Bing noticed his gaze.

"I'll tell you later."

Li Mo said in a low voice. After walking out of the street, he summoned the Somersault Cloud and lifted the two of them into the sky.

The Somersault Cloud didn't leave Greenwood City, but stopped in mid-air.

"People from the Demonic Sect of Calling have found us."

"Those merchants from earlier?"

Ying Bing's phoenix eyes narrowed slightly, her gaze turning profound.

She seemed to be thinking about how to deal with those people...

Seeing that she was already thinking about their deaths, Li Mo shook his head and said:

"There are too many of them, and they're all at the External and Internal Scene. We can't confront them head-on."

"But we need to go home." Ying Bing furrowed her brows.

They couldn't let this group of Demonic Sect followers follow them all the way back to Qinghe County. They had to deal with this before going home.

"Lead these people to the Greenwood Camp?"

"You didn't see it. When someone spat on that Hundred Beasts Hall Master's shoe just now, he even endured it. He's so steady, it's a bit tricky... Fortunately, I found some time to think of a way."

"What?"

"Ice Cube, congratulations, from this moment on, you are the Saintess of the Myriad Phenomena Immortal Sect!"

Li Mo said solemnly, taking out the Phaseless Gauze and handing it to her.

After a moment of thought, he also handed over the prayer beads that Brother Murong had given him.

"?"

"It's time for our performance!"

Exactly!

This was the method thought up by Little Li, the Golden Horse Award winner!

With just one performance from the Best Actor, the name of Heavenly尊, Immortal Li had already shaken the Southern Frontier!

Now, with the Best Actor and Best Actress performing together, what was the Demonic Sect of Calling's Hundred Beasts Hall? It was just a matter of a slight effort.
