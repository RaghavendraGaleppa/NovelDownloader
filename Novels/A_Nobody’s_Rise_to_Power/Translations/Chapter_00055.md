# Chapter 55: The Most Carefree Task

Li Dazhu, the Accountant Li, was undoubtedly the most carefree person amidst this storm.

Even the young master Zhang had lost his peace of mind. He, who originally wished for his father to return as late as possible, was now impatiently sending people to the Phoenix Mountain Villa to look for Zhang Yunyi.

But Accountant Li was extremely carefree and at ease.

His most important task now was not auditing accounts, but fooling around with the maiden Xiao Tan. This was the task Yang Can had assigned to him, and he liked it very much.

After another round of hard work, Accountant Li floated out of the room with weak legs. He felt he had been too busy lately and should take a rest tomorrow.

"Oh, Miss Qingmei."

Suddenly, Little Qingmei walked over from the opposite corridor with a bitter face. Accountant Li quickly greeted her with a smile. This girl had been inside Executive Yang's bedroom, so he couldn't afford to slight her.

"Oh, it's Mr. Li."

Qingmei replied with a bitter face. Dealing with those farmers who spoke nonsense and would ramble on about their ancestors for three generations was truly exhausting. She rubbed her sore cheeks and shook her small hands, which were sore from writing.

Accountant Li looked at her movements and couldn't help but be slightly surprised. Executive Yang... was he that strong? Look how exhausted Miss Qingmei was.

"What are you looking at?" Little Qingmei shot him a sideways glance and asked in confusion.

"Oh, nothing, nothing. Ahem, Miss Qingmei... you've worked hard."

"Hmph, of course I have. Even though I did it voluntarily, he, Executive Yang, can't treat me like a beast of burden."

Little Qingmei grumbled resentfully. Accountant Li's heart pounded with fear. Such wild and beastly words—how could she just say them casually? You might dare to say them, but I don't dare to listen!

Li Dazhu now held Yang Can in complete awe. This Executive Yang was too deep and scheming; he couldn't beat him. Since he couldn't beat him, he would join him and become a lackey. That was Mr. Li's principle.

Now, in Feng'an Manor, the only big shots who hadn't been invited by Yang Can for a "chat" were the Zhang family's own relatives and the troop commander Kang Zhengyang.

Feng'an Manor was a large estate, capable of mobilizing about five hundred private soldiers. The position of troop commander was originally a military post from the previous dynasty, adopted by the Eight Great Clans to become the title for the leader of a powerful family's private army. Because private soldiers had the nature of an army, they could not be commanded by the manor lord or the leaders of towns and forts. Therefore, they were directly in the hands of the clan head and the heads of the various branches. The appointment, removal, and daily management of the troop commanders were decided by them. However, the private soldiers were soldiers in wartime and civilians in peacetime. So from another perspective, they were still subject to the control of the manor lords. As a result, troop commanders inevitably had to interact with the manor lords frequently. Moreover, wars between the clans were rare, so the relationship between troop commanders and manor lords became even closer. Sometimes, the private soldiers would act as the manor lord's thugs, helping him do evil. But regardless, the private soldiers and troop commanders were still the people in a village who were least influenced by the manor lord.

Troop Commander Kang Zhengyang was currently stroking the "Yang Can Plow" with a smile. The expression was just like when he was in his twenties, stroking his wife's smooth skin. This was the second "Yang Can Plow" he had managed to get. To be able to get two of these new plows when they were in such high demand was entirely because he was a troop commander.

Kang Zhengyang had three brothers and four sisters, making it quite a large family. After using this new plow, even if each Kang family household saved just one strong laborer, they could pool them together to do something. Kang Zhengyang had already calculated that by pooling the laborers saved by the Kang family's relatives and friends, and pulling in the families of the private soldiers who were close to him, he could use the Kang family members as the backbone to form a small caravan. Then, with funding from all sides of the Kang family, he could go do some business with the Xianbei tribes. He would buy some iron pots, salt, tea, and cloth from Tianshui City and sell them to the Xianbei tribes. Then, he would exchange felt blankets, honey, beeswax, and even medicinal herbs like angelica and astragalus from the Xianbei tribes and sell them back to Tianshui City. The round trip wasn't too far, with Feng'an Manor as a midpoint, and it could be profitable.

He was just about to have his son summon his brothers and brothers-in-law to discuss his plan when an uninvited guest arrived at his home. The visitor was none other than Leopard Head Cheng Dakuan.

Cheng Dakuan and Kang Zhengyang were very familiar with each other; they were the two best fighters in Feng'an Manor and had known each other since childhood. More than twenty years ago, the two competed for the position of squad leader in the private soldiers, and in the end, Kang Zhengyang got the position. In a fit of anger, Leopard Head went to the Phoenix Mountain Villa and became a guard. After years of training, Leopard Head's development once surpassed Kang Zhengyang's. But now, he had been knocked back to his original state and was still subordinate to Kang Zhengyang. However, he sat cross-legged on Kang's heated kang, without any sense of embarrassment. On the contrary, Kang Zhengyang, sitting opposite him, had a face full of heavy thoughts.

"Mr. Kang, our Master Yang doesn't want much. As long as you are outwardly deferential and secretly follow Master Yang's instructions after Zhang Yunyi returns to the manor, then everything you have will be preserved. Master Yang will not touch you."

Kang Zhengyang remained silent with a dark expression.

Leopard Head sneered, "Mr. Kang, your martial arts are not as good as mine. How you climbed to the position of squad leader back then, after all these years, you must have figured it out clearly. The Zhangs thought you were easier to control than me, so they strongly recommended you to our troop commander at the time."

Kang Zhengyang couldn't take it anymore and said in a deep voice, "Why are you telling me this? What, want to settle old scores?"

Leopard Head said, "I'm just telling you that Zhang Yunyi has no real kindness towards you. Now, the old Zhang family is facing a great disaster, so don't mistake your own path. Otherwise, when Zhang Yunyi falls, how can you escape being implicated?"

Kang Zhengyang mocked, "What kind of implication? Just like you, being demoted to the bottom?"

"You..." Leopard Head's hair and beard bristled with rage. However, he suddenly thought of something and sneered, sitting back down.

"If you don't know what's good for you, then after Zhang Yunyi falls, the one who will replace you as troop commander will be me, Leopard Head."

Kang Zhengyang ignored his threat and pondered for a moment before slowly saying, "In other words, you taking down Manor Lord Zhang is not the Clan Head's intention?"

"Of course not. If it were, why would I come to you? But do you think, given the situation, with the Young Mistress, who has the Suo family backing her, standing in the front, will the Clan Head protect him, Zhang Yunyi?"

Of course not. Dealing with these manor managers branded with the Second Branch's seal is in the Clan Head's interest. How could he possibly protect Zhang Yunyi? Zhang Yunyi is like an emperor in Feng'an Manor, but in the Phoenix Mountain Villa, he's just a wealthy upstart who scrambles for connections.

After a long pause, Kang Zhengyang finally raised his head.

"You came today without notifying me in advance. So, I won't be entertaining you. We'll talk again next time."

Although Leopard Head was illiterate, he understood Kang Zhengyang's words clearly.

"Hahaha, you小子, your fists and feet are not as good as mine, but your mind is much more flexible than mine. If I had your mind, I wouldn't have had to spend so many years to climb to the position of guard captain."

Kang Zhengyang said with a straight face, stabbing him in the heart, "You were the former guard captain. Now, you're nothing."

The day after Kang Zhengyang agreed to cooperate with Yang Can, the Zhang family's Manor Lord, Zhang Yunyi, whom all the managers in the granary had been eagerly waiting for, finally "returned."

There were two armed forces in Feng'an Manor, and Yang Can couldn't ignore them. A cornered Zhang Yunyi might not dare to turn against him. People from the Central Plains can flee to Longshang, so can't people from Longshang flee to the Central Plains? If he dared to ignore this, he might easily capsize in the ditch.

Now, the private soldiers controlled by Kang Zhengyang were on his side. The most powerful armed force in Feng'an Manor was in his hands. The other armed force in Feng'an Manor was the guard martial artists personally selected and trained by Zhang Yunyi. Yang Can hadn't thought of recruiting them, and on the surface... he hadn't taken any precautions against them either.

Zhang Yunyi was openly brought back and then stuffed into the granary, right in front of those guard martial artists. As the lord of Feng'an Manor, Zhang Yunyi had privileges. For example, the granary where he was imprisoned held only him.

"Mr. Li, what's going on? Why was the Manor Lord brought back by Executive Yang? Could it be... could it be that the Clan Head wants to deal with our Manor Lord?"

Miss Xiao Tan, her face pale with fright, anxiously grabbed Accountant Li's sleeve, her eyes filled with tears. It wasn't that she had any feelings for Zhang Yunyi, although she had also slept with the Manor Lord. It was just that everything she relied on for her livelihood now came from the Zhang family. If the Zhang family fell, where would a small woman like her go?

Li Dazhu's face was grim as he said through gritted teeth, "What a good Yang Can, what a good Executive Yang, he even tricked me!" Li Dazhu patted Miss Xiao Tan's hand and comforted her, "Don't be afraid. This isn't the Clan Head making a move on Manor Lord Zhang. If it were the Clan Head, he wouldn't need to go to so much trouble."

Xiao Tan was delighted upon hearing this and said, "Then... can we send someone to the Clan Head to file a complaint?"

Li Dazhu sneered, "The Manor Lord brought twelve experts and still couldn't reach the Phoenix Mountain Villa. He's now a prisoner. Do you think someone else could get up Phoenix Mountain?"

Xiao Tan's face changed. "Mr. Li, what should we do?"

Li Dazhu said with a dark expression, "This is clearly a scheme by the Young Mistress of the main branch. You saw it yourself, the people Executive Yang used were all sent by the Young Mistress. These people were previously disguised as agricultural advisors or plow makers, I spit! But, you don't need to worry too much."

Li Dazhu pulled Xiao Tan over and hugged the petite woman in his arms, comforting her softly, "Even if something happens to the Zhang family, I, Li, will protect you. A little maid like you, Executive Yang probably won't deliberately make things difficult for you."

Xiao Tan endured her disgust and gave Li Dazhu a kiss, saying with affection, "Then... I'll be counting on you, sir."

"Rest assured, rest assured."

"But, Mr. Li, is our Manor Lord really going to fall like this?"

"Fall? That's not all!"

Li Dazhu's face showed fear as he said word by word, "Xiao Tan, you don't know. Looking at this Yang Can, his appearance is gentle and polite like a refined gentleman, but his heart is as venomous as a snake and a wolf. He hides his claws and锋芒 like a silent man, but when he seizes someone to devour, he won't stop until they are dead. When he acts, it's like thunder and lightning, every move shattering the heart and soul; when he schemes, it's sinister and ruthless, every matter cutting the grass and eradicating the roots. Even the venom of a viper is not as insidious as him, even poisoned wine is inferior to his cruelty. He views human life as straw and discards the Way of Heaven like worn-out shoes."

Xiao Tan's face turned pale with shock as she said, "Mr. Li, what do you mean by this?"

Accountant Li said grimly, "Zhang Yunyi is a dead man! The Zhang family is finished!"
