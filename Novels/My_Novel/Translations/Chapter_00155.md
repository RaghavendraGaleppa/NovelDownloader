Chapter 155: Yang Yuan Sword Qi, Yang Sword Perfection

Cao Nuyi’s pupils constricted in shock, filled with both fury and fear, yet he was rendered speechless. He had rushed here intending to catch his opponent off guard and seize the initiative. However, such unexpected situations were precisely where Li Xian excelled.

Faced with the sudden attack, Li Xian used clever words to maneuver the situation, not only resolving the crisis but also seizing the County Magistrate's token. Now, the entire Qingning County belonged to him alone.

"No, if I am truly captured and taken back, I will surely suffer brutal torture and be made the scapegoat. I must escape no matter what," Cao Nuyi’s thoughts raced. Suddenly, he exerted his strength with a violent shake.

He flung the soldiers gripping his shoulders away. He thought, "After tonight, I will surely be wanted. Fortunately, this young master has nowhere to vent his anger; I shall kill a few people to let it out."

He lunged out with a claw, seizing a soldier by the throat. With a slight exertion, a "pfft" sound was heard as a spray of blood shot out. Two soldiers fell dead at his hands.

He leaped up to escape, and the soldiers immediately moved in to kill him. In his rage, Cao Nuyi unleashed powerful strength. He was actually a powerful expert at the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" stage.

It was like the explosion of thunderous drums.

He snatched a long spear and injured several more men. Amidst the thousands of troops, he displayed his formidable might.

Li Xian said, "This thief's deeds have been exposed and he resists arrest in public. Where is Captain Zhang?"

Zhang Yiheng’s expression was complex. Anyone with eyes could see that the true culprit behind today's events was this handsome youth with a red mole between his eyebrows.

However, this man naturally possessed the ability to "control the situation." Once this momentum was established, the hearts of the people followed. The truth no longer mattered.

Zhang Yiheng stepped forward and said, "Commander Wu, I am here."

The County Captain was an eighth-rank official, responsible for managing civil disputes and capturing criminals. Logically, they should have been of equal rank. But since Li Xian had taken office, he had already suppressed Zhang by several ranks.

They were equal in rank but not in power.

"How should this thief be dealt with?" Li Xian asked.

"This man stole and killed the County Captain. Now he resists arrest and refuses to submit. He should be executed on the spot!" Zhang Yiheng hardened his heart and declared loudly.

"Good!" Li Xian said. "As the County Captain, this is your duty. Go quickly!"

"Yes!"

Zhang Yiheng drew his horizontal blade and glanced at the constables beside him. He took the lead and charged forward, shouting, "Felon, take your life!"

Radiance burst from his shoulders; he showed no mercy in his attack. Cao Nuyi, enraged,反笑 (laughed in anger): "Good, very good, Qingning County! You have colluded to murder an official of the court."

"You will die a horrible death. The Cao family will not let you off!"

He fought back with all his might.

"Spouting nonsense, the thief is rampant."

The two fought back and forth, trading blows evenly. Zhang Yiheng shouted, "Form the formation!" Three red-robed constables charged out.

They employed the "Three Talents Capture Formation." All three constables were at the minor success level; they had neither circulated their Qi through the meridians nor "solidified their blood and closed their pores." However, their sword techniques complemented each other. As one's sword momentum exhausted, another immediately took over.

The three were continuous and endless, their attacks dazzling and chaotic.

Although Cao Nuyi was at the "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" stage, close to the "Food Essence" level, he was completely suppressed and gradually showed signs of exhaustion.

Zhang Yiheng restrained him from the front, while the three red-robed constables attacked from the side. Their coordination was appropriate and pleasing to the eye.

Li Xian thought, "Although the strength of martial artists is powerful, if they coordinate properly and their formations are excellent, they can make up for insufficient martial arts attainments and slightly weaker martial dao realms!"

He gained great insight; this trip was not in vain.

He couldn't help but think again, "If it were at the level of Madam, what kind of formation and what kind of coordination would be needed to defeat her?"

He really couldn't think of it, so he stopped thinking about it.

At this time, the exchange of moves was coming to an end. Cao Nuyi pounded his chest, intending to use "Chest Drum Thunder Sound" to shock and repel the enemy. But the red-robed constables were not weak in courage. Although affected by the thunder sound, their movements slowed and their sword techniques became stiff, they remained formidable.

Zhang Yiheng continued to restrain him from the front.

The situation took a sudden turn for the worse.

Zhang Yiheng channeled his strength and struck out with both palms. Cao Nuyi blocked with his palms. As the two contended with their internal Qi, two red-robed constables executed the move "Knives in the Ribs."

The two men, one left and one right, slashed horizontally toward his waist and ribs.

Cao Nuyi was greatly alarmed. If he continued to compete in palm strength with Zhang Yiheng, he would surely be hit by these two blades. He immediately tried to withdraw his palm force, but his internal Qi was like a river, about to surge out of his body, yet it was forcibly stopped. Unable to calm it down, he instead injured himself.

He then saw Zhang Yiheng's two palms strike his chest. Injured further, he was almost killed. Fortunately, he managed to avoid those two blades.

Before he could recover, a "pfft" sound rang out.

The third red-robed constable, hiding in the dark and waiting for an opportunity, executed the move "Thrusting Through the Heart from the Back," piercing through his chest from his back, killing him in one strike.

Li Xian secretly noted this. "What a formidable formation. It is full of killing intent, one trap after another. The four配合 (coordinated) seamlessly, their power infinite. This set of capture formation truly broadened my horizons!"

And so it was.

The two masterminds who had framed Li Xian were both dead. Li Xian, crying "thief" while being the thief himself, unified the entire county's口径 (storyline), making the affair watertight.

The details of the case were compiled by Zhang Yiheng into a report and submitted to the prefectural city.

It soon reached the ears of the Cao family. The clan elders discussed:

"Rebellion, this is truly rebellion! Is Qingning County trying to rebel!?"

"Utter nonsense. This Cao Nuyi is a servant of my Cao family, loyal and devoted. It is absolutely impossible that he colluded with mountain bandits to kill Cao Yun."

"Who would have thought that this Qingning County would be so stubborn. In my opinion, the mastermind behind this is that Commander Wu. Young Master Yun said he wanted to deal with the Commander, and the next moment he was beaten to death."

"As the saying goes, to catch the thief, you must first catch the leader. If we do not eliminate this Commander Wu, we cannot take over Qingning County."

"Who would have thought that the biggest obstacle to our control of Qingning is actually a country bumpkin. But this is just a mantis trying to block a chariot, overestimating his own strength."

Qingning County.

Li Xian took the County Magistrate's token and hung it at his waist, declaring that he would return it when the next County Magistrate took office.

In the Immortal Dream Pavilion, Li Xian set up a memorial banquet to mourn the death of Cao Yun. He invited the three halls and two sects, county officials, all the runners, and the aristocratic families...

Everyone who received an invitation was present. The lively scene far surpassed the previous occasion.

The main seat was taken by Zhang Yiheng. Li Xian sat in a side seat, but everyone's eyes were fixed on him alone.

Li Xian said, "Although County Magistrate Cao only held office for a few days, we were colleagues for a time. Please join me in a moment of silence for him."

No one dared to disobey. They sighed inwardly. In such a short time, this youth's momentum was already unstoppable in the county.

He was like a local tyrant.

His powerful strength was only one aspect. In the past, Xu Liefeng of the Leopard Blade Sect ruled Qingning County with immense power. In an instant, he suppressed the three halls and two sects, making them all bow their heads.

But Xu Liefeng never reached this level of power.

No matter how strong one is, if everyone is determined to fight against you, what can you do? Kill them all? A person's strength eventually runs out. Once the internal Qi is exhausted, can they still be so overbearing?

Moreover, formations, spears, shields, and arrows... although they are ordinary weapons, if arranged in a formation, they are quite formidable.

What truly subdues people is his innate temperament. It is the grasp of the grand situation. This talent is innate. Li Xian led the Black River Village to resist the mountain bandits and coordinated the Yihe Village to fight against the Yellow Dragon Army.

The current Qingning County... is just the same. It happens naturally. He doesn't even deliberately scheme.

"Everyone," Li Xian continued. "County Magistrate Cao was not wrong about one thing. There is indeed corruption in Qingning County. Now that the new County Magistrate has not been selected, I, as the Commander Wu, temporarily acting as County Magistrate, truly wish to rectify this风气 (atmosphere)."

"This..." Many people's expressions changed drastically.

"I will not追究 (investigate) past matters," Li Xian said calmly. "But I hope that from today on, the sky over Qingning County should be clearer, and the people's livelihood should be more stable."

The local forces of Qingning County were all subdued by him. If he were to join them in corruption and seek wealth together, their connections would surely become closer and more united.

But this speech of his would inevitably harm the interests of the family forces and the martial arts hall and sect forces. But he didn't care. He acted according to his heart and didn't worry about much.

"Commander Wu is dedicated to the people. We admire you!" everyone said. Their thoughts varied, but no one dared to defy him.

"Good, everyone, please drink and enjoy the music," Li Xian said with a smile.

The sound of the zither was melodious, and the dancers were graceful.

There was music and dancing, and an abundance of wine and meat.

Li Xian left the banquet halfway and walked to the street.

The breeze tonight was just right, gentle and not dry. Only the moon was waning, and clouds covered it, lacking a bit of beauty.

Li Xian strolled in the middle of the street, his hands clasped behind his head. Unconsciously, he walked into a residential area.

Candlelight flickered. Li Xian looked around curiously, observing the various scenes of life in every household.

There were loving couples, naughty children not listening to discipline, and scholars reading by borrowed light. Li Xian occasionally relaxed his mind, and it had a unique flavor.

"It's rare to be so relaxed. Occasionally putting aside martial arts and walking aimlessly is not bad."

Li Xian walked deeper and deeper.

His hearing was sharp, and he suddenly heard faint panting sounds. Li Xian calculated the time; it was the time for couples to be intimate.

Li Xian smiled to himself, went no further, and turned back to the Commander's Hall.

"I killed Cao Yun and framed Cao Nuyi. This can deceive ordinary people, but the Cao family surely knows that I was behind it."

"I wonder what actions they will take. The Cao family's power is huge, not something I can compare to. I can only wait for the troops to come and the water to cover the earth."

Li Xian pushed all the trivial matters to the back of his mind.

He drew his sword and began to practice "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword." This sword technique accumulates Yang energy and must not be leaked. To delay the side effects, Li Xian practiced it during the cool night.

"Three Yangs Bring Prosperity," "Setting Sun Breaks Dawn," "Hanging Sun Standing," "Spring Snow"... various sword moves were executed one after another.

Li Xian didn't know how many times he practiced. Yet he didn't feel bored. The sword in his hand was like an extension of his arm,挥洒如意 (flowing freely), fully expressing the meaning.

Practicing the sword is practicing the meaning, practicing the conception, and practicing the virtue.

A set of sword techniques contains a great deal of content. How much one gains depends entirely on personal comprehension. Although Li Xian had the "Heavenly Dao rewards diligence," he was by no means one who practiced blindly.

He often pondered the wonderful uses of the sword moves and how to practice to achieve results faster.

[Proficiency +3]
[Proficiency +3]

Suddenly, in an instant.

Li Xian's sword sang like a dragon's roar. "Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword" reached [Perfection]!

Various insights surged into his mind. The essence of the sword was all熟记于心 (memorized by heart). Bringing a martial art to "Perfection" was always a matter of pride.

Even basic martial arts were extremely difficult to practice to perfection.

As for "Reaching the Peak."

This could not be forced. Many martial artists with abundant talent spent their lives pursuing the peak, but the more they pursued it, the more elusive it became.

Li Xian sat cross-legged. His internal Qi grew wildly. The momentum was strong. In an instant, his Qi Lake had expanded by more than two zhang.

[Setting Sun Decaying Blood Sword]
[Proficiency: 32/80000 Perfection]
[Description: You rest during the day and practice at night, combining the two swords. Finally, you have practiced this sword technique to perfection, displaying its mysterious moves to the fullest. You have comprehended "Yang Yuan Sword Qi" and cultivated a strand of "Life-Saving Yang Qi."]

Yang Yuan Sword Qi: When executing the "Yin-Yang Immortal Couple Sword," the sword qi is like fire, extending three zhang away, cutting down enemies before the horse. If the two swords are combined, the power increases more than twofold!

Life-Saving Yang Qi: Cultivated through persistent, long-term practice. It is a wisp of Yang Qi containing pure vitality. In a critical moment, it can protect one's life.

"Superior martial arts are truly extraordinary!" Li Xian was overjoyed.
