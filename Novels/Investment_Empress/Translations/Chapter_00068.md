# Chapter 68: Junior Brother Li Is Indeed a Man of Noble Character, Feedback: Profound Weapon Embryo

Uh...

Seeing Li Mo's casual expression, Xiao Qin thought he was unaware of the item's value. "Junior Brother Li, this item is useful for the Spirit Contemplation realm, and even higher realms. It is an extremely precious treasure!"

Martial Venerable Thousand Forms: "..." If this item were given to him, his spiritual soul would recover at least thirty percent of its peak power. But his disciple was simply too upright. Alas, it's also a good thing... If Xiao Qin truly had a problematic character, he wouldn't have considered him a successor.

Li Mo smiled helplessly. In this day and age, one has to rack their brains to bestow benefits upon others. Gifting is an art, isn't it?

"So, this thing is useless to me in the short term, isn't it?"

"That is indeed the case..." Xiao Qin's expression froze, then he nodded.

Li Mo continued: "Do you want it?"

"Naturally..." Xiao Qin nodded blankly.

"Then, for me, the only value of this item right now is to help a friend, isn't it?"

"That's not wrong to say." Xiao Qin thought for a moment, feeling that what Li Mo said made so much sense that he couldn't refute it.

Li Mo continued to gently guide him: "So, aren't we good friends?"

"Naturally!" Xiao Qin immediately said with a serious expression.

"Then there's no problem, is there? Take it." Li Mo, all smiles, clapped the Soul-Nourishing Darkwood of Profound Yin into Xiao Qin's hand.

Xiao Qin opened his mouth. Is... is it really like that? He felt something was odd, but couldn't pinpoint what exactly was wrong.

Martial Venerable Thousand Forms also found it incredibly strange at this moment. Being old and wise, he naturally saw that his disciple had been led astray by this kid named Li. But having lived two lives, it was the first time he had seen someone lead another astray purely to bestow a benefit. To call it trickery and deception, yet the person was strangely good-hearted. It was simply absurd.

"Alright, Senior Brother Xiao will also achieve great things in the future. By then, things like this won't be considered precious anymore. I'll go turn in my mission now." With that, Li Mo said no more. As if fearing Xiao Qin would return the item, he turned and left.

"No wonder everyone in the sect says Junior Brother Li is a man of noble character, possessing the style of ancient sages. Compared to him, what kind of open and honest person am I?" Xiao Qin watched that carefree back depart, his heart a mix of emotions. He already felt he owed Li Mo a favor, and now he owed even more. But since Junior Brother Li had said so, he truly couldn't refuse anymore. Besides, his master indeed urgently needed this item.

"Hmph, good thing you still remembered this old man." In his mind, Martial Venerable Thousand Forms snorted.

"Master, this disciple had no other intentions..." Xiao Qin felt a bit awkward.

"Alright, this old man knows your character. If not for that, I wouldn't dare entrust my life and death to you." Martial Venerable Thousand Forms wasn't actually angry. Instead, he continued: "That kid Li, he's indeed someone worth befriending deeply, and... he himself is extremely extraordinary. You should work harder and see if you can keep up with his pace."

Xiao Qin was about to nod, but couldn't help but be stunned. Keep up with Junior Brother Li's pace? He had only just broken and then established, cultivating from scratch, and now only reached the twelfth meridian perfection of the Qi-Blood Realm. Junior Brother Li couldn't possibly have condensed Inner Qi already, could he?

Seeing what his foolish disciple was thinking, Martial Venerable Thousand Forms said: "It's even more astonishing than you imagine. Although he hasn't condensed Inner Qi, the path he has taken in the Qi-Blood Realm is much longer than yours. This old man doesn't know the exact number of meridians, but it's definitely far more than twelve."

Martial Venerable Thousand Forms, after all, was once a magnate. Now, only his spiritual soul remained, and his perception was still far beyond ordinary people.

"More than twelve meridians?" Xiao Qin was touched upon a blind spot in his knowledge and was somewhat incredulous.

"When it comes to martial arts, you're still a frog in a well, kid. By the creation of heaven and earth, everyone indeed only has twelve main meridians. But some are born to seize the creation of heaven and earth, with foundations far surpassing ordinary people. This old man once possessed fifteen main meridians, far exceeding those in the same realm." Martial Venerable Thousand Forms' faint voice carried a hint of pride.

No sooner had his voice fallen than, in the External Affairs Hall, the voice of the steward from before came: "Verification complete. True Disciple Li Mo, for successfully hunting down and killing one Inner Qi Condensation Realm culprit, awarded five thousand contribution points!"

Inner Qi Condensation Realm! Xiao Qin's spirit jolted, and his eyes widened. He was still feeling a little secretly pleased about his imminent breakthrough to the Inner Qi Realm, yet Junior Brother Li could already kill culprits in the Qi Condensation Realm? Terrifying indeed!

"Hmm, as expected, he's probably comparable to this old man in my younger days. If that's the case, Ying Bing is even more exaggerated. No wonder she's still in the Qi-Blood Realm." Martial Venerable Thousand Forms said with considerable solemnity.

"Then how can I ever catch up to Junior Brother Li?" Xiao Qin suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness in his heart. He had a master's guidance, yet he was still so far behind. Wouldn't he be left further and further behind in the future?

"Hehehe... Innate talent is indeed important, but before the universe is settled, who says one cannot rise to prominence later?" Martial Venerable Thousand Forms wanted to put pressure on his disciple, not make him lose his drive. So he spoke as if he knew the future: "What this old man is proud of is not those fifteen main meridians, but the 'Thousand Forms Art'! When you reach the Spirit Contemplation Realm, you will naturally understand its profound mysteries."

"Mn!" Xiao Qin clenched his fists tightly, his fighting spirit rekindled. If he couldn't even catch up to Junior Brother Li's shadow in the future, how could he repay him?

.....

Inside the External Affairs Hall.

"Qi-Blood slicing Inner Qi? Is this what a true disciple is?"

"Hmph, hmph, don't just assume Junior Brother Li is merely a good person because of his kindness."

"Why is Senior Brother Li so strong?"

"Have you forgotten? His master is Elder Shang Wu."

"Then I understand."

.....

After exchanging greetings with a few familiar disciples, Student Xiao Li was quite happy. It wasn't because of the five thousand contribution points that had just arrived, but because of a system notification.

[Congratulations to Host, for successfully investing one piece of 'Soul-Nourishing Darkwood of Profound Yin' in Xiao Qin.]
[Investment Feedback: One Profound Weapon Embryo.]
[Profound Weapon Embryo]: "Can generate a premium Profound Weapon similar to the weapon template provided by the Host."

Although Student Xiao Li was reluctant to admit it, he had to. He currently lacked a suitable hammer. Divine weapons, at his current cultivation realm, he couldn't even pick them up, let alone use them. Even if his physique was strong enough to wield it with the augmentation of world power, it could only be used as a last resort. With this Profound Weapon Embryo, he could then use the "Calamity Meteorite Hammer" as a template to create a 'replica'.

"True Disciple Li, do you need to exchange anything?" The inner sect steward saw him standing there and thought he was contemplating what to exchange for.

"Yes." Li Mo regained his senses and nodded. "I need some exotic beast meat."

"Oh?" The inner sect steward was a little surprised but then said: "Although exotic beast meat isn't as effective as medicinal pills, it's superior in being solid and free of pill toxins. It seems True Disciple Li is thinking very long-term. Do you need it for condensing qi-blood, strengthening the physique, or breaking through realms?"

"I want the delicious kind."
