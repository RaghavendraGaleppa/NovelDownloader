# Chapter 57: Ascending to Mid-Grade Talisman Master

The sky had darkened.  

At the Langya County Prefecture, Zhang Jing followed the familiar path to Senior Brother Yan's palace.  

*Knock! Knock!*  

He gently rapped on the door, but to his surprise, the sound reverberated like thunder, echoing throughout the entire prefecture.  

Then—*Boom!*  

The bronze-cast gate collapsed with a resounding crash.  

Witnessing this scene, Zhang Jing instinctively shrank his neck, his face flushing with embarrassment.  

Only then did he remember—after his breakthrough to the mid-stage of Qi Refinement, his body had undergone a tremendous transformation. The terrifying strength he now possessed was beyond imagination.  

*This damn gate looked so sturdy, I must have subconsciously used full force!*  

*Tap, tap—*  

Footsteps approached rapidly, accompanied by a loud shout:  

"What demon dares to barge in here?!"  

Moments later, Senior Brother Yan stood frozen before the ruined gate, pointing at the collapsed bronze door as he asked Zhang Jing:  

"Junior Brother, please don’t tell me *you* did this."  

"Senior Brother Yan, my sincerest apologies," Zhang Jing said sheepishly. "But... your gate really isn’t that sturdy. It could use an upgrade."  

Hearing this, Senior Brother Yan nearly choked on his own laughter.  

"My gate isn’t sturdy—*huh*?" Mid-sentence, he suddenly paused, sensing the aura emanating from Zhang Jing. His eyes widened in astonishment. "Junior Brother, you broke through? Mid-stage Qi Refinement!"  

"Thanks to Senior Brother’s blessings, I reached the fourth layer of Qi Refinement last night," Zhang Jing replied with a smile.  

Instantly, Senior Brother Yan began circling Zhang Jing, clicking his tongue in amazement.  

"Well, well, Junior Brother. Are you trying to catch up to *those two* in cultivation as well?"  

Zhang Jing immediately understood who he meant.  

Curious, he asked, "Senior Brother, what cultivation level have those two reached now?"  

"From what I’ve heard, they’ve just entered the fifth layer of Qi Refinement. But their actual combat prowess is... exaggerated, to say the least. You’ve been busy with talismans, so you might not know—those two are making quite a name for themselves on the frontlines."  

Then, as if remembering something, Senior Brother Yan smirked and added,  

"But you’re not far behind, Junior Brother."  

"I was only in seclusion for a few days refining talismans, and you nearly monopolized the entire lower-grade talisman market in the temporary bazaar."  

"You flatter me, Senior Brother," Zhang Jing replied modestly.  

"Alright, Junior Brother," Senior Brother Yan said, leading Zhang Jing inside. "What brings you here today?"  

---  

Getting to the main topic, Zhang Jing straightened his expression and said earnestly,  

"Senior Brother, I’d like to purchase some mid-grade spirit paper."  

"I had a feeling you’d ask," Senior Brother Yan said knowingly.  

He walked to a bronze table and lightly brushed his storage pouch. A stack of thick, coarse spirit paper, pulsing with dense spiritual energy, appeared atop the table.  

"How much do you need? If it’s just a few dozen sheets, I can lend you some. But if you need more, you’ll have to spend merit points. Senior Brother Li is currently stationed at the battlefield and hasn’t returned yet—I don’t have the authority to allocate your monthly quota."  

Zhang Jing thought for a moment. "Then, Senior Brother, please give me a hundred sheets for now."  

Waiting for Senior Brother Li to return wasn’t an option—he still had that senior brother’s mid-grade talisman order to fulfill.  

*Mid-grade spirit paper shouldn’t be too expensive for me now. The Thousand Techniques Pavilion sells them at one merit point for two sheets. Surely the squad’s price won’t be worse than that.*  

Meanwhile, Senior Brother Yan counted out a hundred sheets and handed them over.  

"Here you go, Junior Brother. Since the amount isn’t too large, you can take these first. We can settle the merit points later—once Senior Brother Li returns and confirms your quota, we’ll deduct it from there."  

"Many thanks, Senior Brother."  

"By the way, Junior Brother," Senior Brother Yan suddenly asked, "I heard you’ve been trading talismans at a loss for demon cores?"  

Zhang Jing hesitated. "Senior Brother, the demon cores... have a special use for me."  

"Fair enough—everyone has their secrets," Senior Brother Yan chuckled, his aged face creasing with amusement. "I just wanted to remind you—Senior Brother Li will return soon. He’s bound to have high-grade demon cores. If you still need them, you can approach him directly."  

Zhang Jing’s eyes lit up with excitement.  

*High-grade demon cores!*  

*If I can get even one from Senior Brother Li, I’ll be set!*  

As Zhang Jing’s figure disappeared into the night, Senior Brother Yan called out a final reminder:  

"Junior Brother, mid-grade talismans are far more difficult than lower-grade ones. Low success rates are normal—don’t let it discourage you."  

"I understand. Thank you, Senior Brother!"  

---  

Inside the talisman workshop on the second floor of his shop, Zhang Jing’s expression was unreadable.  

With full concentration, he summoned the *Chishen Lingguang*, forming a crimson cloud above his head. The *Heart’s Eye Dao Seed* in his consciousness blazed brilliantly.  

Unlike before, his mid-stage Qi Refinement spiritual sense could now sustain the full activation of the Dao Seed for hours. He spared no expense.  

A thick sheet of mid-grade spirit paper lay before him.  

Gently lifting his spirit brush, Zhang Jing began tracing the patterns of a mid-grade talisman—one he had long since memorized.  

Just as Senior Brother Yan had warned, if the difficulty of crafting a lower-grade talisman was *one*, then a mid-grade talisman was *a hundred*. The two were incomparable.  

Every stroke had to be flawless—his spiritual sense and spiritual energy couldn’t waver in the slightest. Worse, each new stroke had to account for the ones already drawn.  

As he progressed, every subsequent stroke felt like threading a needle atop a web of existing patterns. The interplay between the lines emitted a faint, unstable energy, making Zhang Jing feel as though he were dancing on the edge of a blade.  

Time passed.  

With the final stroke completed, a surge of spiritual energy erupted from the paper.  

**Mid-grade defensive talisman—Gravity Star Talisman—complete!**  

Even with the dual support of *Chishen Lingguang* and *Heart’s Eye*, Zhang Jing was drenched in sweat.  

But at least he had started with success.  

Unnoticed, the night slipped away.  

Exhausted, Zhang Jing emerged from the workshop.  

After a night of experimentation, he had roughly determined his success rate for mid-grade talismans under the influence of his Dao Seed and spiritual light.  

**Thirty percent.**  

And most of that was thanks to *Chishen Lingguang*.  

Holding the handful of mid-grade talismans, Zhang Jing sighed.  

He did the math—with a thirty percent success rate, crafting mid-grade talismans was far more profitable than lower-grade ones.  

A single mid-grade talisman could fetch over ten merit points, while the cost never exceeded two.  

And if he ever condensed a *Source Talisman*... the profits would be astronomical. As long as his spiritual energy and sense held up, he could easily churn out one to two *thousand* merit points a day.  

*Ten days, and I could afford a top-tier inheritance.*  

*That’s way faster and easier than scrounging for demon cores like I am now.*  

Lost in thought, Zhang Jing quietly descended to the shop’s ground floor.  

As the doors swung open, he found a familiar woman waiting outside.  

The moment she saw him, her eyes lit up with excitement.  

"Honored cultivator," she whispered cautiously, "do you still need Mistroot Water Ginseng?"
