Chapter 341: The Dragon List is Announced!

Jingle—

The wind chimes at the eaves of the Happy Sheep Hotpot Restaurant tinkled.

The massive warship of the Clear Abyss Sect, Elder Qian's precious treasure, a behemoth that consumed two pieces of profound crystal just to activate, hovered in front of the hotpot restaurant.

"What's going on? Why is the Clear Abyss Sect showing such a formation? Is war about to break out?"

"Don't you know? A beast tide has erupted in the Southern Frontier, but the King of the South has to return to the Imperial Capital to report on his duties. He just can't be stationed at the Southern Pass. I'm preparing to move my whole family to Yunzhou."

"That's right, I wonder if the Happy Sheep Hotpot Restaurant will open a branch in Yunzhou..."

The few remaining diners discussed amongst themselves.

Now, the winds of the impending fall of the Southern Pass were blowing faintly over the Eastern Wasteland, and even ordinary people had heard the rumors.

"Have you finally made a decision?"

Mei Yun stood up and greeted Xue Jing, who was descending from the warship.

"Yes, we plan to go to the Southern Frontier. Even if there's the slightest possibility, we have to bring those two little ones back. We'll see a person if they're alive, and a corpse if they're dead."

Xue Jing said with a solemn expression.

This was the result of the elders' joint deliberation.

Mei Yun was a bit surprised, but after a moment of silence, as if she recalled what the former matriarch had done, she felt it wasn't incomprehensible.

If Chulong's life or death were unknown, she would do the same.

"What about Miss Jiang Chulong?" Xue Jing asked.

"She's still asleep."

Mei Yun had discovered that every time Jiang Chulong woke up from her dreams, she seemed to have become stronger.

She guessed it was probably the work of that expert who could impart teachings in dreams, but she knew nothing else.

"This is also a foolish child."

Sighing, Xue Jing took a box from his怀里, inside which was a pill.

"Thank you... be careful, all of you."

Mei Yun hesitated, wanting to say more.

This pill was refined with Dream Thorn Flower as the main ingredient. It could put the user into a deep sleep, was harmless to the body, and even had the effect of strengthening the soul.

This was what Mei Yun had asked Xue Jing to refine.

Jiang Chulong had been unwilling to leave, and Mei Yun had no choice but to resort to this last resort.

"If she wakes up, she might resent me, hate me for a lifetime, but I still have to take her away..."

Just as she was thinking this.

The sound of "da da da" footsteps suddenly came from behind. Jiang Chulong was walking briskly, her face slightly flushed, seeming very cheerful. Mei Yun hadn't seen such an expression on her face for a long time after she had been worried for so many days.

"Aunt Mei, Aunt Mei!"

"What is it? Drink some water first and then talk."

Mei Yun calmly put the pill into the water flask.

She poured a cup of water for Jiang Chulong, who took a couple of perfunctory sips, her eyes sparkling as she said:

"Big Brother Li is fine, Qingmu City is fine, and the Southern Frontier is fine too!"

She was so excited that she wasn't stuttering anymore.

Her words left everyone stunned.

Fine?

How did she know?

And with the King of the South absent, how could the Southern Frontier be safe and sound?

The battle over there might not even be over yet.

"How did you know?"

"My Master told me."

Jiang Chulong blinked and let out a yawn.

Strange, she just woke up, why were the sleep bugs coming for her again...

"The city... was... was defended by Big Brother Li..."

She barely managed to finish this sentence, her eyelids already starting to droop.

The others exchanged glances, suspecting that Jiang Chulong was still half-asleep, thinking about it day and night, and so had a beautiful dream.

According to the information they had, whether Qingmu City could hold out until they arrived was a unknown.

Li Mo and Ying Bing were indeed the most incredible prodigies they had ever seen, beyond the description of "genius."

But their cultivation level was still too low.

Let alone the Divine Observation Realm, even the Inner Scenery or Outer Scenery realms would seem insignificant on the battlefield.

"What else did your Master say?"

Mei Yun suddenly felt a bit of regret; she had been too anxious to give Jiang Chulong the Dream Thorn Pill.

She knew Jiang Chulong practiced with the expert in her dreams every night.

With such unfathomably divine methods, the words spoken were probably not groundless.

---

Just at this moment.

Xiao Qin ran over from a distance and shouted loudly:

"The Dragon List is being announced!"

...

Yunzhou.

Inside a tavern by the shore of Yulong Lake.

The tavern, inside and out, was now guarded by fierce-looking personal guards; ordinary people couldn't get in at all.

The King of the South, Zhong Qin, dressed in plain cloth with greying temples, was looking at the bustling lakeside. Without turning his head, he said to the people behind him:

"Elder Xu, long time no see."

"There's a war in the Southern Frontier, yet the King of the South is in no hurry. Weren't you supposed to return to the Imperial Capital to report? How do you have the time to come watch the list announcement?"

Before the white-haired youth could speak, Elder Zeng, who loved reading, frowned and said displeasedly.

"Whether I go to the Imperial Capital to report or not is not important. What's important is that I'm not in the Southern Frontier."

The King of the South, Zhong Qin, said softly.

Elder Xu narrowed his eyes: "Lord Zhong, could it be that you're reminiscing about old times and want to persuade us to leave Yunzhou?"

"I have to persuade you, of course."

Zhong Qin's voice was devoid of joy or sorrow.

"I hate riddles the most," Elder Zeng muttered.

The imperial family is heartless. Our Hengyun Sword City was once where Emperor Wu studied, yet the current holy land of swordsmanship is the Tianshan Sword Manor.

At this moment, the captain of the personal guards came up to the second floor, cupping his fists and saying:

"Your Highness, Young Master Zhong has chased after you and wants to see you."

"So soon?"

Zhong Qin raised an eyebrow, then nodded.

A moment later, the captain brought Zhong Zhenyue up. He was now covered in dust and looked exhausted, but his tired gaze was still firm.

"Father, don't you know the military situation in Qingmu City?"

"..."

Zhong Qin finally turned around. He had little of a military aura about him, wore ordinary cloth clothes, yet gave off an imposing aura that commanded respect.

His son had always revered him like a god.

But now, he was speaking in a tone of almost accusation.

Zhong Qin was silent for a moment, then asked:

"Then tell me what you know."

"The remnants of the Great Shang Dynasty and the various tribes of the Southern Frontier have formed an allied army of at least one hundred and twenty thousand. There are also several high-level disaster beasts. They are led by the Great Shang's national teacher, Han Zhen, and are invading Qingmu City."

The two elders from Hengyun Sword City's faces darkened.

The situation in the Southern Frontier was far more serious than they had imagined.

Zhong Qin's eyelid twitched.

He took a deep breath and said:

"I know. Go rest first."

"Father!"

Zhong Zhenyue stared at Zhong Qin, whom he had always revered as a god, in disbelief.

He wanted to say that there were still many comrades in Qingmu City, and Uncle Qu who had followed his father for decades.

There was also Brother Li, who was still in the city.

But Zhong Qin had already turned his back.

"The fall of Qingmu City is only a matter of time."

Elder Xu's expression was uncertain: "Is His Majesty planning to just hand over the Southern Pass as well?"

The number of troops on both sides wasn't that different.

However, the soldiers of Qingmu City lacked food and pay, their morale was low, while the enemy was clearly well-prepared and confident of victory.

"Are Young Master Li and Miss Ying still in the city..." Elder Zeng muttered to himself.

He couldn't help but touch the "Overbearing Empress Falls for Me" in his怀里. Would he have nothing to read in the future?!

Just at this moment.

BOOM—

Over Yulong Lake, the Dragon Gate emitted a thousand auspicious rays of light, illuminating the layers of clouds.

The new issue of the Dragon List was about to be announced.
