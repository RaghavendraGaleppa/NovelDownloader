# Chapter 157: A Fellow Transmigrator?

Yinchuan Market was located in Huainan, a stark contrast to the cutthroat competition of Yichuan Market in the northern Yan Mountains. Here, cultivators leaned toward a more relaxed lifestyle—if they could cultivate slowly, they would, pushing everything else aside.

This had led to a prevailing culture of asceticism in Huainan, where medicinal pills sold well while magical artifacts and talismans languished on the shelves. The loose cultivators, content to live as the "grass" of the cultivation world, spent their days thinking only about acquiring passable skills and finding menial jobs in Yinchuan to scrape by.

This was nothing like Yichuan in the north, bordering the Great Yan Dynasty, where everyone scrambled to improve their strength, terrified of being ambushed and robbed the moment they stepped outside. Any spirit stones earned were immediately converted into combat power or skills, with no thought of saving.

In contrast, Yinchuan's safer environment attracted a far larger number of low-level loose cultivators, yet its market remained sluggish. Everyone preferred to hoard their money, retreating to remote mountains to cultivate haphazardly. No matter how much the capitalists tried to stimulate consumption, they wouldn't budge. "I don't care about worldly affairs," they'd say. "I just want to hole up in my little valley. You can talk until the heavens fall, but I'm going into seclusion until the end of time."

As long as everyone slacked off together, the aristocratic cultivation families would have to lower their standards of living. Since loose cultivators had no grand ambitions and their paths were essentially monopolized, mediocrity was the way to go.

When Lin Shan and the Black Skeleton Demon Lord arrived, they found the market far quieter than Yichuan. The streets were sparsely populated, and shops stood nearly empty. The only place with any real foot traffic was the brothel—some loose cultivators, having earned spirit stones, couldn't be bothered to save and instead spent them on pleasure.

Lin Shan, however, had no interest in visiting brothels. Though wealthy, he wasn't foolish. These establishments charged entry fees, seating fees, performance fees for music and dance, refreshment fees for snacks and tea, and tips for the attendants. Competing for a lady's attention required bidding, and spending the night came at an exorbitant price.

Moreover, he had no interest in "public transportation." 

Wouldn't it be better to find a saintess or demoness from a top sect as a cultivation partner once his strength grew? At the very least, he could aim for a core disciple of a major sect. With his abilities and golden finger, he might even become a titan of the cultivation world in the future.

Investing emotions when weak would only create future troubles and vulnerabilities—something a true powerhouse couldn't afford. If he ever sought a partner, it would be for mutual strength, someone who could keep pace with him. He had no interest in mere ornaments.

Saintesses: "???"

Demonesses: "???"

...

At the Hundred Treasures Pavilion, a chain store in the cultivation world, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord sat in the deserted hall, sipping spirit tea while a puddle formed beneath his chair from the constant dripping.

"Esteemed senior, these are the materials you requested. The total comes to two thousand spirit stones."

The shopkeeper, who hadn't made a sale in ages, was grinning from ear to ear at landing such a big customer today.

"He'll handle the payment."

The gray-robed figure in the hood took the storage bag from the table and pointed a blackened skeletal claw toward the white-robed youth rummaging around the shop's corners.

Lin Shan paused his search for ancient aura, glanced at the bill, frowned slightly in thought, but ultimately paid up.

After leaving the pavilion, they inquired about the location of Yinchuan's auction house. As they walked, the Black Skeleton Demon Lord brought up an urgent matter concerning his existence in this world.

"Brother, I need to break through my current realm as soon as possible. Summoned beings have a time limit for staying in another world. Only by increasing my cultivation can I extend that duration."

"How long until you reach the Golden Core stage?"

"Reaching the peak of Foundation Establishment will take about thirty years. If I don't have the materials to break through to Golden Core by then, I'll likely be forcibly recalled by my true body in the Netherworld!"

"There's such a rule?"

This revelation caught Lin Shan off guard. After the demon lord explained the summoning contract in detail, he had no choice but to accept it.

Having the Black Skeleton Demon Lord by his side was undoubtedly advantageous—not only could it provide high-level cultivation guidance, but it could also set up powerful formations and offer significant combat support. Letting it return was out of the question.

"What materials do you still need? How much more in spirit stones?"

"Ordinary materials will cost around a hundred thousand spirit stones, but we can gather those gradually. The real issue is two rare items."

"Oh?"

"Demon Taro Fruit and the skeleton of a Golden Core cultivator."

Lin Shan stopped in his tracks and turned to stare at the skeleton, who stood there nonchalantly, even adding, "It must be a fresh skeleton—either from someone who just died or perished no more than two months ago."

"Bro, let's just cancel the contract."

"Gladly! I'd love to."

"Wait, I was joking..."

The demand was absurd. The gap between Foundation Establishment and Golden Core was vast—just the transition from spiritual energy to true essence and the ability to wield magic treasures spoke volumes. For the two of them to kill a Golden Core cultivator would be sheer suicide.

Unlike Foundation Establishment cultivators, whose spiritual sense extended a mere hundred meters, Golden Core cultivators could cover a full li (about 500 meters). In terms of combat range, that meant facing attacks five times their own reach before even getting close.

Before they could even approach, a magic treasure would come flying from afar. How could a Foundation Establishment cultivator withstand an attack from a Golden Core's treasure? High-grade magical artifacts would be as flimsy as paper against them.

Moreover, Golden Core cultivators possessed profound true essence and astonishing speed—chasing them was impossible, and escaping futile. Even if they set up elaborate traps or formations capable of countering Golden Core experts, how could they be sure their target lacked defensive treasures, knowledge of formations, or means to break restrictions?

With a lifespan of four hundred years, Golden Core cultivators had ample time to master one of the six cultivation arts. They were all exceptionally talented and capable—not the type to be easily killed by juniors.

"Pity. We had the perfect skeleton from the East Sea—Tortoise Sage's remains."

"At that time, I had just arrived. There was no way I could reach peak Foundation Establishment in two months."

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord shook its head. Creatures summoned through curse-based summoning initially had no cultivation and could only absorb their host's power to grow. It had responded to the summoning on Tortoise Sage's disciple, but Lin Shan had killed the host shortly after.

Without the chance to rapidly advance by absorbing the disciple's Foundation Establishment cultivation, it had been forced to start from scratch and form a contract with Lin Shan.

"So, the only option is for me to reach Golden Core within thirty years and then find you a suitable skeleton?"

Lin Shan was speechless. Thirty years to go from early Foundation Establishment to Golden Core? No one would dare make such a boast. Though his enhancement panel could help bypass bottlenecks, daily cultivation still required steady accumulation and effort—thirty years was far too short.

The Black Skeleton Demon Lord, however, remained unperturbed. It assured Lin Shan that things would work out—they could focus on gathering the other materials and the Demon Taro Fruit first, leaving the skeleton for later.

...

As they talked, they arrived at the auction house, situated in the prime commercial district of Yinchuan. The building was grand yet elegantly traditional. Upon entering, they were greeted by a maidservant.

"Welcome, esteemed seniors, to Yinchuan Auction House! Please, come in."

"I'm here to see Chief Appraiser Elder Zhang."

"Master Zhang happens to be resting in the back hall today. If you don't mind, please follow me."

Lin Shan and the demon lord followed the maid deep into the hall, turned right, and stopped before a room after about ten meters. The maid gestured for them to enter.

Before stepping inside, they could hear murmurs from within—a conversation between an elder and a youth.

"How was the essential oil massage earlier?"

"Not bad."

"And the Thai-style eighteen touches?"

"Amazing."

"The ancient spa technique?"

"Authentic."

"Head pressure points?"

"Heavenly."

Lin Shan froze mid-step. That familiar phrasing, that unmistakable style! In this world, aside from himself, someone else knew these massage techniques?

Could there be another transmigrator like him?
