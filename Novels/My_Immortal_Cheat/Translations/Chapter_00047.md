# Chapter 47: 3D Projection

"Uncle Zhou, what's inside here?" Zhou Tian handed a rhombus-shaped jade slip glowing with a faint white light to Uncle Zhou.

This was what Zi Xu had just left. Zhou Tian's purpose in coming to him was to find out why the people from Daluo Academy were looking for him. This inquiry indeed revealed something; all the specific details were recorded in this small jade slip, which contained all the scenes from that time.

Uncle Zhou took the jade slip, infused energy into it, and the slip glowed, emitting streaks of runes. A miniature 3D projection appeared. Zhou Tian's eyes couldn't help but show astonishment. All paths lead to the same destination; what technology could achieve, cultivation could also achieve.

Focusing his gaze on the projection, there were a total of four people in the scene: Zi Xu alone, and three from Daluo Academy. Zhou Tian seemed to have a slight impression of the leader; he vaguely recalled seeing him at the banquet that day, though he couldn't quite remember. A voice came from the projection.

"You are Zi Xu, correct?" the leader from Daluo Academy asked, his tone arrogant and slightly contemptuous.

"Indeed, I am Zi Xu. May I ask what business the three of you have?" Zi Xu's demeanor was neither servile nor overbearing. He neither flared up at the other party's tone nor showed fear because they were disciples of a major state-level power, demonstrating excellent self-possession.

"Zhou Tian's fiancée, that Tian Ling, is your senior sister, right?"

"Yes, Tian Ling is indeed my senior sister. Gentlemen...?" Zi Xu's brows furrowed slightly.

"If you encounter her in the Youth Competition, help us severely injure her!" The man from Daluo Academy sneered.

"Absolutely impossible!" Zi Xu rose in indignation, purple light flashing in his eyes, as if about to strike. But after a moment, he returned to normal, sat down again, and said coldly,

"If you gentlemen have no other business, please leave!" The people from Daluo Academy showed no reaction to his previous outburst. After all, he was merely at the San Zang Realm; they could subdue him with one hand.

"Won't you reconsider? If you're willing to help us, these two sacred artifacts will be yours, and we can also take you back to our Daluo State, free from Zhou Tian's retaliation, and provide you with an excellent cultivation environment!" The people from Daluo Academy pulled out two faintly glimmering weapons from thin air: a long sword and a piece of armor. Even from the projection, Zhou Tian could sense the extraordinary nature of these two weapons. They promised various benefits, attempting to tempt Zi Xu.

"Please leave!" Zi Xu clenched his fists, suppressing his anger as he spoke.

"Hmph, I hope you won't regret this later!" Seeing that he absolutely refused, the people from Daluo Academy's expressions flickered between dark and light. They snorted coldly and turned to leave.

Just as they pushed the door, about to leave, Zi Xu suddenly spoke.

"Aren't you afraid of Zhou Tian's retaliation? He's the Crown Prince of Qin from the Tianqin Dynasty!"

"The Crown Prince of Qin? Just a good-for-nothing who only knows how to run his mouth!" The people from Daluo Academy finished speaking, pushed the door open, and walked out. The projection ended there.

Uncle Zhou's eyes gleamed with a chilling bloody light, his killing intent thick as he said coldly,

"Young Master, should I go deal with them? With this projection, we won't be so passive!" The last insulting remark about Zhou Tian had been heard clearly by him, and it had touched his bottom line.

Calling Zhou Tian a good-for-nothing could be a minor or major issue. It could be dismissed as heedless chatter between young people, or it could be amplified infinitely to be seen as disrespect towards the Tianqin Dynasty. At the banquet hall that day, Zhou Tian had already retaliated, so the matter was considered closed, and the Tianqin Dynasty side found it difficult to pursue further. But this time was different. If they were directly killed, with this item as a cover, there would be many excuses that could be fabricated.

In truth, the biggest mistake those Daluo Academy students made wasn't their arrogance or disdain for others; they only made one mistake, and that was mistakenly believing they were on the same standing as Zhou Tian. While Daluo Academy and Tianqin were indeed on the same level, this didn't mean they and Zhou Tian were on the same level. They were merely one of thousands of students at Daluo Academy, whereas Zhou Tian was a legitimate direct descendant of the Zhou family, and the Zhou family head was his paternal uncle. How could their statuses be the same?

"No need. Since they've set up such a show for me, wouldn't killing them directly be letting them off too easily?" Zhou Tian waved his hand, saying, "These little darlings, all they can do is call me a good-for-nothing over and over again. There's no originality at all."

Then, his expression turned strange again, and he said,

"Aren't these Daluo Academy people out of their minds? It's one thing to ask Zi Xu to deal with Tian Ling, but they even fell for Zi Xu's clearly obvious trap with that last remark?" Asking Zi Xu to deal with Tian Ling could be understood as them wanting to try, as their conditions were indeed very generous, and Zi Xu was a suitable candidate—being Tian Ling's junior brother, he understood her well. If it were someone with less emotional attachment to Tian Ling, they might truly succeed. Although Zhou Tian speculated that if someone truly followed them back to Daluo State, that person would likely disappear, as Daluo State was their territory, and no matter how good the promises sounded now, once there, they would be at their mercy. But that last sentence was clearly a trap set by Zi Xu; did they just walk right into it? Is this the intelligence level of the Daluo Academy people?

"Young Master, it's not that simple. Although they are arrogant, their intelligence isn't that low," Uncle Zhou shook his head, holding up the rhombus-shaped jade slip in his hand.

"The projection in this jade slip wasn't recorded at the time. Any slightly larger power has methods to counter such recording formations, let alone Daluo Academy. When they came, they were prepared and carried magic treasures to prevent recording!" Uncle Zhou reopened the projection, zoomed in on one of the Daluo Academy individuals, and pointed to the blue jade pendant hanging at his waist, which glowed faintly and occasionally emitted streaks of runes.

"Then this projection...?" Zhou Tian asked, confused. If recording formations couldn't be used, then how did this projection come about?

"That's thanks to the divine soul on Zi Xu's person. I sensed a faint ripple identical to the divine soul on him deep within this jade slip's formation," Uncle Zhou lightly tapped, and the jade slip in his hand completely disintegrated, forming an incredibly complex grand formation. Golden light flowed within it, as magnificent as stars in the sky. He gently flicked the formation, and endless runes surged from Uncle Zhou's hand into the formation. The formation burst forth with a brilliant golden light, and a wisp of gray mist, as fine as a strand of hair, was extracted by Uncle Zhou from the formation. He had actually used great divine abilities to materialize a soul fluctuation into a physical object, just to let Zhou Tian see it.

"Don't let me look at these. They give me a headache just seeing them..." Zhou Tian clutched his head, saying, "I have no idea how people in this world manage to keep going; they can even master such complicated things."

Uncle Zhou shook his head and smiled. With a gentle clench of his hand, the formation retracted and reformed into the rhombus-shaped jade slip in his palm, appearing exactly as it had before, as if it had never been opened.
