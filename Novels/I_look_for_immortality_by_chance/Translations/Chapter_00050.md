# Chapter 50: Cold Rhinoceros Dragon Elephant, Auction  

**Can the Power Seal also help in breaking through to Foundation Establishment?**  

Gu Yuan couldn't help but frown.  

This was the first time he had heard such news.  

But since things had come to this, overthinking wouldn’t help. He could only wait for tomorrow’s auction.  

After exchanging a few pleasantries with the steward, Gu Yuan left South Mountain Pavilion.  

He then had his guide lead him around the market, visiting several other shops, but none of them had the three spiritual plants he sought. Left with no choice, Gu Yuan could only give up and wait patiently for the auction the next day.  

**"Guest, this is the quietest meditation chamber in the market. It costs only one spirit stone per night. Though the spiritual energy isn’t particularly dense, privacy is guaranteed."**  

**"I will come to escort you to the auction tomorrow."**  

The woman led Gu Yuan into a secluded bamboo garden, bowed respectfully, and then departed.  

Gu Yuan nodded slightly and stepped into the courtyard without further delay.  

The bamboo courtyard was serene, protected by formations that ensured both safety and privacy.  

After taking a few deep breaths, Gu Yuan retrieved a golden jade slip from his storage bag.  

Channeling his spiritual sense into it, he began studying the **"Soul Binding Art."**  

To be precise, this technique was called the **"Soul Binding Seal Method."**  

It was an unusual technique—unlike conventional seal methods, it didn’t require refining a seal. Instead, it relied on cultivating spiritual sense, preparing essence blood, and performing a ritual.  

This method acted upon the soul, creating a unique form of restraint.  

Gu Yuan closed his eyes and reviewed the method five times before finally opening them again.  

**"The Star Spirit is a living seal, so all that’s needed is to refine it. No wonder."**  

After studying it thoroughly, he had memorized the technique completely, leaving nothing out.  

**"In that case, let’s begin!"**  

Exhaling deeply, Gu Yuan retrieved the Star Spirit from his spirit beast pouch.  

The Star Spirit was still tiny, its eyes closed as it emitted faint snores, seemingly deep in slumber.  

In its weak state, the Star Spirit was extremely lethargic, spending most of its time sleeping aside from eating.  

But for the ritual to work, the Star Spirit needed to be awake.  

However, Gu Yuan didn’t wake it immediately. Instead, he took out cinnabar, gold dust, and jade powder from his storage bag.  

**"Hah!"**  

With a breath, Gu Yuan scattered the cinnabar, gold dust, and jade powder across the meditation chamber. Then, he pricked his fingertip and let drops of his essence blood fall onto them.  

**"Buzz—"**  

The moment the blood touched the powders, they merged into a thick, unique liquid.  

Gu Yuan then channeled his spiritual sense into the liquid, guiding it as it slowly formed a mysterious Dao pattern in the air.  

The pattern glowed crimson, standing upright in the void, but it seemed incomplete—lacking one final piece. The surrounding spiritual energy remained undisturbed.  

Without spiritual energy activation, no matter how profound the pattern was, it would be useless.  

But Gu Yuan wasn’t worried. With a flick of his finger, he sent the sleeping Star Spirit right into the center of the pattern.  

**"Boom!"**  

Instantly, the pattern became complete. A sudden gust of wind arose in the void, carrying dazzling fluorescent light.  

Gu Yuan felt as if a small fragment of his soul had been severed, flowing into the pattern before him.  

**"Clang!"**  

The pattern erupted in radiant brilliance, shining as brightly as the moon.  

The Star Spirit, startled awake, opened its tiny eyes and looked around in panic.  

It tried to flee, but the massive pattern descended like a blood-red moon, wrapping around it like a cocoon.  

**"Buzz—"**  

The crimson cocoon trembled violently in the chamber, yet not a trace of bloodlust emanated from it. Instead, a faint, refreshing fragrance filled the air.  

Gu Yuan sensed a new presence in his mind—he could feel its emotions, desires, and thoughts as if they were his own.  

It was like gaining an extra pair of hands.  

**"Cold Rhinoceros Dragon Elephant Star Spirit!"**  

**"Loves to eat 'Frost Honey Dates' and 'Dragon Tooth Jade.' Possesses the 'Cold Rhinoceros Dragon Elephant Seal,' which can drastically increase its size, granting it mountain-crushing strength and frost-breath capable of freezing the heavens."**  

**"Grows slightly every thirty years, significantly every three hundred years, and reaches full maturity in three thousand years."**  

**"Consuming 'Ice Soul Cold Rhinoceros Jade' and 'Dragon Elephant Fruit' can accelerate its growth."**  

The true power of the Soul Binding Art wasn’t just in controlling the Star Spirit like an extension of oneself—it also allowed one to understand the Star Spirit’s habits and growth methods.  

This knowledge was priceless.  

As the information flooded his mind, Gu Yuan felt both joy and frustration.  

The joy came from the Star Spirit’s immense power—it was essentially a fusion of an immensely powerful body seal and an ice-based spell seal.  

Even now, with the Star Spirit under his control, Gu Yuan could transform into a ten-foot-tall giant with tens of thousands of pounds of strength, exhaling frost capable of slaying ordinary sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators.  

The frustration came from the Star Spirit’s agonizingly slow growth.  

The one he currently possessed was only thirty years old, with a single star pattern rotation.  

It could only match a sixth-layer Qi Refinement cultivator.  

To advance further, it needed another thirty years to reach the second star pattern rotation. At that point, it could transform into a thirty-foot-tall titan with two hundred thousand pounds of strength and bone-chilling frost, capable of fighting ninth-layer Qi Refinement cultivators.  

But if he wanted it to reach the third star pattern rotation—granting Foundation Establishment-level power—it would take three hundred years!  

A timespan long enough to outlive Gu Yuan himself.  

He could only sigh helplessly.  

**"Munch!"**  

Unaware of Gu Yuan’s thoughts, the Star Spirit suddenly found the human before it incredibly warm and comforting.  

It fluttered unsteadily before landing on Gu Yuan’s shoulder, nuzzling his cheek with its tiny nose.  

**"Alright, little one. I’ll just have to find a way to raise you properly."**  

**"Hopefully, I’ll live long enough for you to become my true ally."**  

Gu Yuan stroked the Star Spirit gently with a finger, smiling wryly.  

**'Ice Soul Cold Rhinoceros Jade'** and **'Dragon Elephant Fruit'** were treasures he had never even heard of—how could they be easy to obtain?  

As for the Star Spirit’s favorite snacks, **'Frost Honey Dates'** and **'Dragon Tooth Jade,'** they were just treats—they couldn’t enhance its strength.  

---  

**"Senior, the auction is about to begin!"**  

The night passed uneventfully. When Gu Yuan opened his eyes from meditation, he heard the woman’s soft voice calling to him.  

**"Let’s go."**  

He stepped out of the meditation chamber and followed her to a grand hall.  

The path was crowded with cultivators, all heading in the same direction.  

Ever since the true dragon’s death, nearby sects and factions had become active, engaging in both overt and covert struggles. The first to be affected were the Qi Refinement cultivators.  

As conflicts intensified, the market grew livelier.  

At the center of the hall stood a massive jade platform, surrounded by private booths.  

Cultivators, even at the Qi Refinement stage, possessed extraordinary abilities. The hall was vast, with countless luxurious and elegant booths—no open-air auctions here.  

Gu Yuan dismissed his guide and took his seat in a booth.  

The auction didn’t keep them waiting long. Soon, a middle-aged Daoist at the ninth layer of Qi Refinement stepped onto the stage with a smile.  

**"Thank you all for coming. Without further ado, let’s begin!"**  

**"First lot: 'Azure Crane Spirit Water'—starting bid, two hundred spirit stones!"**
