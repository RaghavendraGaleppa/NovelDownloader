## Chapter 84: Soul Searching Technique

Xiang Wu's face darkened, and with a single slash, he cut a nearby unfortunate cultivator in half. "Damn it, that girl actually had a teleportation token." The teleportation token, as its name suggested, contained a simplified version of a teleportation array. Like array tokens and beast tokens, it was a special type of talisman, but much rarer.

Although it was a simplified version, its functionality was far inferior to a full teleportation array. It couldn't determine the destination, and the distance it could cover was extremely limited. Nonetheless, cultivators coveted it, as having one on hand allowed them to escape from powerful enemies at any time, making it a valuable life-saving treasure.

Xiang Wu had let Qin Yan escape, but he was confident that she wouldn't be able to evade his grasp. "Senior Brother, I'll leave this to you," he said, turning around and dashing off in a flash of blood-red light, his Foundation Establishment cultivation allowing him to track Qin Yan.

Meanwhile, Lin Xuan stood silently at the foot of a cliff. The cliff was peculiar, with black stone that was as hard as fine iron. "This must be Duan Xin Cliff," he muttered to himself.

After dealing with the venomous toads, Lin Xuan continued his search for the required herbs. Despite his caution, he encountered two Fire Spirit Gate disciples on a clearing. These were elite disciples, one at the sixth layer of the Spirit Movement stage and the other at the peak. Although they lacked spiritual tools, they had numerous talismans sealed with high-level spells, making them formidable opponents.

Lin Xuan, however, wasn't one to engage in a straightforward battle. He had drunk the Red Silk Grass Elixir, concealing most of his spiritual energy and appearing to be only at the second layer. Dressed in ordinary clothes, he seemed like an easy target to the two Fire Spirit Gate disciples.

The disciples, confident in their superiority, didn't even bother to use their talismans or activate their protective shields. They approached Lin Xuan, sneering, but he was no lamb. With his powerful spiritual awareness, he had detected them first and pretended to be frightened.

As they drew near, Lin Xuan suddenly unleashed his spiritual tool, killing the peak-stage disciple instantly and leaving the other one alive. Lin Xuan had a purpose in sparing the weaker disciple's life.

Lin Xuan knew little about the Xi Yue Gorge, and while the Spirit Beast had guided him, finding the Silver Moon Flower and the Firefly Grass was proving difficult. The Fire Spirit Gate was just a few dozen miles away, and the Xi Yue Gorge could be considered their herb garden. The elite disciples would have some knowledge of the herb distribution.

However, Lin Xuan didn't plan to rely on extracting information through torture or intimidation, as the disciple might lie. Instead, he had another method.

Lin Xuan had obtained a demonic cultivation manual from the slain Ye Tian, and while he didn't intend to practice the forbidden techniques, some of the recorded spells and secret arts were useful. One such technique was the "Soul Searching Technique."

This auxiliary technique allowed him to read the memories of a subdued enemy, revealing all their secrets. However, it came with a cost: the victim's brain would be severely damaged, leaving them a fool. Lin Xuan was willing to take that risk, as he would only use it on his enemies.

Another limitation was that if the enemy's spiritual awareness was stronger, there was a risk of backlash. But against a sixth-layer Spirit Movement stage disciple, this wasn't a concern.

Lin Xuan applied the technique, and soon, a smile appeared on his lips. The information he obtained was indeed useful: the Silver Moon Flower and the Firefly Grass grew together on Duan Xin Cliff, located in the southern part of the Xi Yue Gorge.

With the information confirmed, Lin Xuan ended the disciple's life using the Ice Ball technique. Showing mercy to enemies was tantamount to being cruel to oneself. In such a treacherous environment, one couldn't afford to be lenient.

Lin Xuan then gathered the spoils, taking the storage bags from the two Fire Spirit Gate cultivators, and departed. Following the information he obtained, he arrived at Duan Xin Cliff half an hour later.
