# Chapter 4: Weapons Can Be Enhanced Too?

At dawn, in the square behind the family's rear mountain, hundreds of outer courtyard disciples practiced swordplay under the guidance of their instructor. From a distance, their movements appeared uniform, carrying a hint of the Shu Mountain Sword Sect's elegance.

But upon closer inspection, their postures were sloppy, their limbs stiff—clearly, everyone was just going through the motions.

Lin Shan, who had arrived late, curled his lips in disdain. This was no different from the calisthenics exercises of elementary and middle school students in his past life. The instructor, merely retired and going through the motions for a paycheck, taught half-heartedly. The sword techniques were just basic forms—useless in actual combat. A well-placed kick would be more effective!

Besides, the disciples had grown up in the Lin family, sheltered from life-and-death struggles, so they lacked motivation.

Lin Shan squeezed into his usual spot in the practice formation and was about to lazily mimic the movements when he overheard his fellow disciples whispering:

Disciple A: "Hey, have you heard? Lin Fan from our outer courtyard was exceptionally admitted into the inner courtyard last night."

Disciple B: "Impossible! The inner courtyard is reserved for the main lineage. How could an outsider get in?"

Disciple C: "What if I told you the Second Elder insisted on adopting Lin Fan as his foster son and even plans to marry his daughter to him?"

Disciple B gasped: "What?! Lin Shanshan, the Second Elder’s daughter, is my goddess! How could this happen so casually?"

Disciple C: "Rumor has it Lin Fan’s inheritance is extraordinary—the true legacy of the late Xiantian Grandmaster, the Blade Tyrant. Plus, he’s already reached the Organ Refinement stage despite being underage. In terms of strength, he’s already surpassed the inner disciples."

Disciple A: "They say the elders fought fiercely over him last night."

Disciple D: "Hiss—terrifying!"

Disciple A: "The new generation surpasses the old!"

Disciple B: "Indeed! Lin Fan has the potential of an Emperor!"

Disciple C: "This child must not be allowed to live—"

"Eh???"

Everyone stopped moving and turned to stare at the speaker, their expressions screaming, "Something’s wrong with you."

Disciple C coughed awkwardly. "Uh... I’ve been binge-reading novels lately. Don’t take it seriously."

Lin Shan also glanced over curiously. The disciple had dark circles under his eyes like a panda, his entire body exuding exhaustion—a classic case of a "depleted young master." He was now frantically begging those around him not to spread his words.

Meanwhile, some opportunistic individuals began scheming, their eyes glinting with unspoken thoughts.

After the brief interlude, Lin Shan drew his sword, intending to loosen up with the half-hearted routine. Suddenly, the transparent panel appeared before his eyes again:

[Iron Sword]  
Quality: Common Iron  
Description: A thoroughly unremarkable sword  
Enhancement Cost: 2 points  

Lin Shan froze. He had been so focused on breaking through to the Houtian realm after enhancing the pill last night that he hadn’t considered other possibilities. His mind had been preoccupied with figuring out how to gather ancient essence.

Now it struck him—if pills could be enhanced, why not other items? The golden finger had only activated yesterday; he still needed time to explore its full potential.

Of course, this sword was a standard-issue weapon for outer disciples—nothing special. The description "thoroughly unremarkable" was fitting, if a bit blunt. Lin Shan scoffed internally.

"If common iron can be enhanced, how far can it go? The Gathering Qi Pill was a low-grade item, but after a 2-point enhancement, it became a Meridian-Clearing Pill suitable for Houtian martial artists. This sword is clearly low-grade too, and it only costs 2 points to enhance. If the effect is proportional..."

He recalled the Meridian-Clearing Pill’s overwhelming potency last night, which had propelled him—someone who hadn’t even mastered Qi Gathering—straight into the Houtian Qi-Exchanging realm.

If the same logic applied, this sword might transform into a legendary weapon capable of slicing through metal like butter, a blade worthy of a peerless swordsman.

His imagination ran wild—him standing atop a riverbank, wine in one hand and sword in the other, felling enemies with a single flick of his wrist. None could withstand a single strike.

"But wouldn’t that draw too much attention?" Lin Shan hesitated, weighing the risks.

"I’m just a rookie who just entered the Qi-Exchanging realm. Wielding a divine weapon would make me a target. Look at what happened last night with Lin Fan and Steward Lin."

The difference was, Lin Fan had already reached the Organ Refinement stage and was on the verge of stepping into the Jin Transformation realm. Not only had he inherited the legacy of a Xiantian master, but he had also demonstrated unparalleled potential within the Lin family. That was why the elders were eager to recruit and nurture him.

Lin Shan, though outstanding among outer disciples, was far from unique. Many inner disciples had already reached the Houtian Qi-Exchanging realm. Moreover, in his ten years in this world, he had never heard of any family elder possessing a divine weapon.

This was a world where the strong preyed on the weak. Rules were meaningless—power was the only law.

Just last night, Steward Lin had openly tried to seize Lin Fan’s opportunity, and no one had batted an eye. Such behavior was commonplace.

After a while, as the sun rose higher, the instructor dismissed the group with a shout.

A sudden thought struck Lin Shan: If pills and weapons could be enhanced, what about martial arts manuals?

No time to waste!

He sheathed his sword and bolted from the crowd, the first to rush home.

The instructor shook his head at the sight, lamenting how this generation of outer disciples lacked discipline. "Each batch is worse than the last. When will they ever rise above the main lineage?"

His mind wandered back to his own youth as an outer disciple. Even after venturing into the martial world and achieving Organ Refinement, he had never been accepted by the main family.

The aristocracy’s bloodline barriers were impenetrable—no amount of effort could breach them. Yet, for some reason, his thoughts circled back to Lin Fan.

"What a lucky brat."

Lin Shan burst into his room and snatched up a well-worn manual from his bedside table.

As expected, the panel appeared:

[Gentle Breeze Sword Art]  
Quality: Low-Grade  
Description: Basic sword techniques with minimal combat utility. Primarily for demonstration. Slight body-strengthening effects.  
Enhancement Cost: 2 points  

"Pah! I knew this garbage was useless! Ten years of wasted mornings—I should’ve just slept in!" Lin Shan hurled the manual to the floor and grabbed another.

[Pine Crane Manual]  
Quality: Houtian Cultivation Art  
Description: The Lin family’s exclusive internal art. Below-average offensive power but includes healing properties. Prolongs lifespan slightly upon mastery. Can be cultivated up to Houtian Completion.  
Enhancement Cost: 4 points
