# Chapter 172: The Market  

Li Shiming noticed multiple stalls selling elixirs—a rare sight in Tianhai Island.  

In Tianhai Island, alchemy was seldom practiced among rogue cultivators. Even if some did study it, they could only produce the most basic pills. High-grade pills for mid-to-late Qi Refinement cultivators typically required ingredients like sea beast cores, which were beyond the reach of rogue cultivators.  

Yet here, he saw pills tailored for mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivators—and these were merely being sold at stalls.  

Passing the first permanent shop, which sold magical artifacts, Li Shiming didn’t enter. A sweep of his spiritual sense revealed everything inside.  

The shop was well-stocked, with artifacts ranging from low-grade to high-grade, all clearly priced on the first floor.  

Each artifact had an accompanying illustration detailing its shape and dimensions, along with a description and price—no hidden information. The transparency deterred cultivators who lacked sufficient spirit stones from haggling.  

One word summed up the prices: expensive. Every artifact was at least 30% pricier than in Tianhai Island, with high-grade artifacts costing more than double.  

After visiting several shops, Li Shiming gained a deeper understanding of the Northern Shu cultivation world.  

The region seemed richer in resources and had a larger population of cultivators compared to Tianhai Island. However, the fierce competition for resources drove up the prices of artifacts. Possessing a stronger artifact meant greater leverage in such competition.  

In contrast, cultivation resources like elixirs were relatively cheaper, making advancement easier for cultivators.  

In Tianhai Island, only those with exceptional talent could join sects. Minor sects had lower requirements, but even if a Five-Spiritual-Roots cultivator was accepted, they’d be relegated to menial tasks with little chance for proper cultivation.  

In Northern Shu, however, anyone with spiritual roots had a chance to cultivate. Those with poor aptitude might not qualify for major sects, but minor sects or cultivation factions would still take them in.  

Even the weakest spiritual roots could be nurtured into early-stage Qi Refinement cultivators with enough elixirs. Once they reached that stage, they could contribute by working in auxiliary professions, mining, or other labor-intensive tasks.  

Regions with dense spiritual energy were unsuitable for mortals to live in long-term, so tasks like mining were handled by cultivators.

Li Shiming compared these observations as he entered a shop selling cultivation manuals.  

An elderly man at the fifth level of Qi Refinement glanced up at him before returning to his book without a word.  

All the books were displayed with their covers facing outward on shelves behind the counter, each with a description and price.  

There were Qi Refinement cultivation techniques, spells, introductory manuals for auxiliary professions, and even personal cultivation insights written by other cultivators. If not for the shop’s sign, Li Shiming might have mistaken it for a sect’s scripture repository.  

What truly surprised him were the jade slips placed prominently in the center—Foundation Establishment techniques, openly available for purchase.  

Of course, these were likely mediocre techniques, but for rogue cultivators, even a low-tier Foundation Establishment technique represented hope.  

Li Shiming found what he was looking for—a map in book form, priced at seventy spirit stones.  

He could afford it, but the price was steep compared to Tianhai Island, where such a map wouldn’t cost more than seven spirit stones.  

"I’ll take this one," Li Shiming said, placing seventy spirit stones on the counter and pointing at the map.  

"This map was compiled by my clan’s cultivators during their travels, covering details within a ten-thousand-mile radius," the old cultivator said with a look that suggested Li Shiming had made a wise choice.  

After paying, Li Shiming took the map.  

It was comprehensive, detailing geography, faction distributions, and market locations. Crucially, it was tailored for Qi Refinement cultivators, with danger zones marked for areas beyond their capabilities.  

Satisfied, Li Shiming stored the map away.  

Just as he was about to leave, a deafening explosion shook the market, followed by violent tremors.  

His expression darkened. His Starlight Sea formation sense detected intense fluctuations—someone was attacking the market’s protective formation.  

The attacker had to be at least at the Foundation Establishment level to cause such a disturbance.  

"Don’t act rashly. The Wei Clan will handle this," the old cultivator warned nervously, eyeing Li Shiming with suspicion.  

Li Shiming ignored him and stepped outside. The old man quickly shut the door behind him.  

---  

Chaos erupted in the market. Shops closed their doors, while customers and stall owners scrambled—some fleeing toward the exit, others seeking refuge near the Wei Clan’s compound.  

Li Shiming knew better than to go to either place. In uncertain situations, the best course was to hide.  

He moved toward the valley wall, an area protected by the formation and off-limits to cultivators.  

With precise steps, he traced the formation’s spiritual pathways and slipped inside. Then, he planted several formation flags into the wall, creating a small concealment array around himself.  

Hidden within the Wei Clan’s formation, his presence was nearly undetectable.  

"Quite the vantage point," he murmured with a smirk.  

He wasn’t overly concerned. He had encountered Foundation Establishment cultivators before, and if things turned dire, he could escape using his sword遁 technique and mastery of formations.  

At the valley entrance, the formation shattered as three Foundation Establishment cultivators and over thirty Qi Refinement cultivators stormed in.  

"The Tie Clan is conducting business. No one moves, or you die!" one of the Tie cultivators shouted at the panicked crowd.  

The dozen or so cultivators at the entrance—none at the Foundation Establishment level—were too terrified to resist. The Tie cultivators subdued them effortlessly.  

Permanent shops had already closed their doors, but under the Tie Clan’s threats, they soon reopened, their occupants surrendering without a fight.  

The Wei Clan’s compound remained eerily silent. Even the dozen cultivators who had fled there were left outside, with no Wei cultivators stepping forward.  

The Tie Clan acted swiftly, confiscating all possessions—storage pouches, artifacts, everything but the clothes on their backs—but refrained from killing those who didn’t resist.  

Soon, the Tie cultivators reached the Wei Clan’s compound. The three Foundation Establishment cultivators took up positions around it.  

"Wei Lin, don’t expect reinforcements. The Hu Clan is already hunting them down," the central Foundation Establishment cultivator declared.  

"So the Tie and Hu Clans have allied? This formation was set by a high-grade formation master. Go ahead, waste your energy attacking it," Wei Lin’s voice replied coldly from within.  

"You overreached by monopolizing the market and the spirit mine. Did you think this formation could stop us?" the Tie cultivator retorted.  

The three Foundation Establishment cultivators unleashed a barrage of attacks with top-grade artifacts, each strike shaking the formation. Yet, after dozens of blows, the formation held firm.  

From his hiding spot, Li Shiming saw the formation’s brilliance—it was powered by a high-grade spirit vein. As long as the attacks didn’t exceed the peak Foundation Establishment level, the formation would endure, continuously replenished by the spirit vein.  

No wonder Wei Lin remained calm despite his clan being besieged.  

Intrigued and sensing little danger—only one of the three attackers was at mid-Foundation Establishment, and none seemed proficient in formations—Li Shiming decided to infiltrate the Wei Clan’s compound.  

Retrieving his flags, he moved stealthily along the valley wall toward the compound.  

At the junction between the wall and the compound, he extended a thread of spiritual sense to probe the defensive formation. The ongoing attacks masked his intrusion, giving him an opening.  

With IBMz15’s analysis, he deciphered the formation’s spiritual pathways.  

Though the formation was masterfully crafted by a high-grade formation master, Li Shiming’s computational advantage allowed him to navigate its complexities undetected.  

A single step took him inside.  

Within, countless spiritual pathways crisscrossed. Disturbing even one would trigger the formation’s counterattack. Guided by IBMz15’s calculations, Li Shiming maneuvered carefully, ensuring his presence went unnoticed.  

Past the outermost defenses, the pathways grew simpler, allowing him to move faster.  

The Wei Clan’s compound was a marvel of formation-based architecture, each building a node in the grand design.  

With the clan’s cultivators concentrated at the entrance, Li Shiming had free rein to explore.  

The compound’s spiritual energy was dense, ensuring no mortals resided there.  

His spiritual sense swept through the area, mapping the formation in real-time with IBMz15’s help.  

His target: the rear of the compound, near the mountain.  

As he approached, he sensed a presence—a Foundation Establishment cultivator guarding the spirit vein.  

Without hesitation, Li Shiming deployed seventy-two formation flags, embedding them into the compound’s formation.  

The flags severed the connection between the rear section and the formation’s controller, feeding false data to mask his intrusion.  

A hidden door in the mountain wall, concealed by the formation, opened effortlessly for him.  

Inside was a cave dwelling, its center occupied by the spirit vein and a seated Foundation Establishment cultivator.  

"Who are you?" the cultivator demanded, his aged face betraying his waning vitality.  

Li Shiming, his features hidden beneath a veil, remained silent. The cultivator’s weakened state was evident—his life force fading, his end near.
