# Chapter 671: So-called Universal Salvation and the Pure World of Glazed Light

Pu Du Zhenjun did not mention the enmity between Qingyuan and him. Instead, he pointed out that Qingyuan had schemed to obstruct the Dao and undermine the foundation of the sect. He framed Xu Yunfan's actions as eliminating a menace for the sect, instantly elevating Xu Yunfan's standing and pulling him completely into the core interest circle of the Primordial Origin Sect.

What Xu Yunfan found most unbearable, however, was that although Pu Du Zhenjun practiced the Dao, his methods were essentially those of Buddhism.

As if seeing through Xu Yunfan's confusion, a faint smile appeared on Pu Du Zhenjun's face.

"Do you find my conduct similar to that of the monks from the Bodhisattva Zen Pure Land?"

Xu Yunfan replied, "I ask the Zhenjun to enlighten me."

Pu Du Zhenjun said, "This is not a Buddhist technique. It is the Daoist aura manifested from the imagery of my Dao Field—Universal Salvation and the Glazed Pure World."

His gaze seemed to pierce through the glazed roof of the grand hall, looking toward the distance.

"This glaze-like ambition is not for the sake of compassion, but for the purification of the world. I have a dream: that the world may know peace. This is my obsession, and it has become the imagery of my Dao. I seek to wash away the filth accumulated within the Taihua Spirit Ruins World, to make the malicious energy vanish, and for disputes to naturally subside. Only then can there be a truly pure path of cultivation to walk."

Hearing this, Xu Yunfan felt he had a thousand retorts but did not know where to start.

It sounded like a girl who frequented nightclubs every day, with countless men passing through her room, yet she solemnly tells him that she is a pristine white lotus, and those men are just playing games with her in her room. It was just as ridiculous.

Xu Yunfan followed up with a question, "May I ask what the Dao of the Zhenjun entails?"

Pu Du Zhenjun said softly, "For the Glazed Light to purify the world, it must ultimately save all living beings."

*What a grand statement.*

Xu Yunfan finally understood what Pu Du Zhenjun meant.

To kill everyone is to save all living beings and purify the world into Glazed Light.

This imagery was nothing short of terrifying.

Once Xu Yunfan realized this, he felt the man before him was utterly insane.

Xu Yunfan gave a dry laugh as a response but did not say anything further.

Pu Du Zhenjun did not mind and nodded slightly.

"You are now a Golden Core Zhenjun, ranking among the sect's high-level figures. Of the Primordial Origin Sect's Nine Immortal Mountains, several are still vacant. You may choose one as your own Dao Field. Although the Divine Thunder Peak is good, it is ultimately just a Spirit Peak. It cannot compare to the deep foundations of an Immortal Mountain, nor can it easily support the evolution of a Zhenjun-level cave heaven."

Xu Yunfan's heart stirred upon hearing this.

The Nine Immortal Mountains were the foundation upon which the Primordial Origin Sect was established. Their spiritual energy origin is abundant, and their laws are stable, far surpassing ordinary Spirit Peaks. Possessing an Immortal Mountain as a Dao Field would be of immense benefit for nurturing the Golden Core to transform into the heavens and for evolving a cave heaven.

He quickly said, "I have just entered the Golden Core realm. I ask the Zhenjun to guide me—which Immortal Mountain can I choose?"

"You are now a Zhenjun as well. Just call me Senior Brother."

Pu Du Zhenjun said casually.

Xu Yunfan顺应 his words immediately.

"Senior Brother."

"Of the Nine Immortal Mountains, aside from my Chenghua Mountain, Senior Sister Dongming's Xuansha Mountain, and the Qingyuan Mountain that was mostly destroyed along with Qingyuan..."

Pu Du Zhenjun's tone was light, as if speaking of an insignificant matter.

"...there are still Zixu Mountain, Yuque Mountain, Tiandu Peak, Youhuang Valley, and Xuehun Cliff vacant. You may sense them with your heart and choose the one most compatible with the rhythm of your Divine Thunder Dao."

Xu Yunfan was somewhat surprised. "Senior Brother, does the sect only have three Zhenjuns now?"

This number was even fewer than he had imagined.

Qingyuan was dead, Dongming was present, plus himself, and Pu Du Zhenjun had admitted as much.

"Indeed."

A complex, hard-to-detect expression crossed Pu Du Zhenjun's face as he sighed slightly. "I was somewhat impulsive back when I was condensing my imagery. When the Taihua Spirit Ruins World was at its peak, our sect possessed four mountains and had five or six Zhenjuns. However, the path of the Dao is arduous. With internal strife and external calamities, over a thousand years, we have declined to this state. New blood is difficult to come by, and old figures are trapped by their own limitations. Xu Shidi, your ability to achieve the Golden Core is truly the favor of the sect's fortune. I hope you cherish this position, cultivate diligently, and consider the future of the sect."

Xu Yunfan understood immediately.

Limited resources, scarce Dao fruits, internal suppression, external oppression, coupled with the confusion regarding the path after the Golden Core, all led to the sharp decline in the number of Zhenjuns in the Primordial Origin Sect.

As the ruler, Pu Du Zhenjun's pressure could be imagined.

As a newly promoted Zhenjun, Xu Yunfan was undoubtedly placed with high hopes, at least for now, as an important source of fresh blood and combat strength for the sect.

Of course, Xu Yunfan could guess what Pu Du Zhenjun wanted to express, but he remained noncommittal about what Pu Du Zhenjun actually thought deep down.

Most members of the Primordial Origin Sect were selfish and self-serving. Those who could achieve the Golden Core must have succeeded at the cost of ten thousand bones, stepping on the heads of others to rise to their position. Now, Pu Du Zhenjun was acting as if he were concerned with the world and worried about the sect's future. Xu Yunfan felt this was a bit too much of an act.

"I will remember the Zhenjun's teachings. I will surely devote myself to cultivation and not fail the sect."

Xu Yunfan stated solemnly.

A hint of satisfaction appeared on Pu Du Zhenjun's face as he encouraged Xu Yunfan, spouting nothing but grand, empty words like "diligently cultivate the Great Dao," "guard against arrogance and impatience," "the sect is one," and "watch out for and help each other."

Xu Yunfan lowered his head and listened respectfully, but his mind was racing.

The other party was an old monster who had lived for an unknown number of years. These words were just to be heard and then forgotten.

Seeing that there was nothing more to say, Xu Yunfan still stood respectfully in place, showing no intention of taking his leave.

Pu Du Zhenjun's eyes shifted, and the smile on his face deepened. "Shidi seems to have some doubts? Are there any confusions in your cultivation? Please, speak freely. Since you and I are now both Zhenjuns, discussing the Dao and resolving doubts is a common occurrence."

*I was waiting for this very sentence.*

Xu Yunfan relaxed internally but deliberately showed some hesitation on his face, as if he had something difficult to say. After a moment, he试探ly said, "Shidi does have one matter weighing on his mind. I do not know if I should speak of it."

"Speak freely."

Pu Du Zhenjun said.

Xu Yunfan took a deep breath, as if gathering his courage and going through the motions.

"When Shidi was proving my Dao, by a twist of fate, I took the Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit..."

He deliberately emphasized the word "took," carefully observing Pu Du Zhenjun's expression as he spoke.

As expected, these old fellows who had lived for an unknown number of years had excellent composure, and nothing could be seen on their faces.

"I later heard that this Dao Fruit had an earlier connection with Senior Brother. Shidi's action was purely to save my life in a moment of desperation. Upon thinking of it afterward, I was filled with dread, deeply afraid that I had offended Senior Brother."

This question was extremely tricky.

The Taiyin Xuanjian Dao Fruit was indeed something Pu Du Zhenjun had his eye on and laid plans for. Xu Yunfan taking advantage of the fire was a fact.

By bringing it up himself and adopting a posture of asking for forgiveness, he was doing two things: first, to test Pu Du Zhenjun's true attitude, and second, to bring the hidden conflict out into the open.

If Pu Du Zhenjun were to fly into a rage, Xu Yunfan would have to immediately think of a way to escape.

If the other party endured it, it would mean either that the fruit was not as crucial as he imagined, or that after weighing the pros and cons, they felt that moving against him would do more harm than good.

The smile on Pu Du Zhenjun's face faded for an instant, only to return to that compassionate and peaceful expression in the blink of an eye.
