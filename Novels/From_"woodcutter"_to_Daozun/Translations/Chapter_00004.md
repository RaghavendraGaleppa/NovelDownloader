# Chapter 4: Rebirth, Omen of Great Disaster!

Back home, Chu Jiang and Uncle Lin began processing the giant soft-shelled turtle. Both were surprised; Uncle Lin had only seen a turtle this size—as large as a washbasin—once in his childhood.

"I've been butchering fish for years, but I've never come across a turtle this big," Uncle Lin remarked. "Only once, when I was a child, someone in town caught one this size and sold it for a full three taels of silver."

Uncle Lin said, "Eating it just like this feels a bit wasteful. Are you sure you don't want to sell it?" He skillfully butchered the turtle. He was a renowned fishmonger in town, having processed countless turtles, but this was the first time he'd seen one so enormous.

"You're not young anymore," Uncle Lin said earnestly. "If you sold it for silver, you could save for another two years and take a wife."

Chu Jiang replied, "There's no one suitable. I can't stand marrying a thirteen or fourteen-year-old child. I want someone seventeen or eighteen." He added, "No, I'm not selling it. We're eating it ourselves. It's rare to encounter something like this in a lifetime; we have to try it." As for getting a wife, he wasn't in a hurry. He hadn't found anyone suitable yet. Girls in Dongjiang Town married off far too early; it was common to see them married at thirteen or fourteen. The reason Lin Jingxian hadn't married yet was mainly because her younger brother, Lin Qinghe, was studying at the academy, incurring significant expenses.

"Hey, kid, you want an 'old maid'?" Uncle Lin paused, surprised. "Where are you going to find one?" In this world where marriage happened so early, seventeen or eighteen was indeed considered an "old maid."

Hearing this, Lin Jingxian chimed in, "Brother Jiang, you aren't thinking of a female knight-errant, are you? Only those female knight-errants remain unmarried at twenty-seven or twenty-eight."

"A female knight-errant? That won't do," Uncle Lin immediately retorted. "They're never home, always fighting and brawling. They're not suited for settling down and living a normal life."

"Alright, stop talking about me," Chu Jiang interrupted. "Let's finish dealing with this turtle first. Its claws are sharp; Uncle Lin, be careful." As Chu Jiang spoke, he pressed down on the turtle's shell, and the creature immediately retracted its head and limbs.

Uncle Lin smiled, taking an iron hook. He stepped on the turtle's shell, used the hook to pull out its head, and with one swift strike, severed it. He had Lin Jingxian fetch boiling water and pour it directly onto the turtle's back to scald off the membrane. The turtle's vitality was tenacious; it continued to writhe for a full fifteen minutes before finally becoming still.

Once the turtle was fully processed, Uncle Lin stood up. "Alright, Xiao Xian and I are heading back now. You can just stew it and eat it."

"Uncle Lin, we agreed to have a drink together," Chu Jiang said. "If you hadn't lent me money back then, my father wouldn't have even been buried. There's not much I can do to thank you, but please let me treat you to a meal." Back then, Uncle Lin had stepped in to help, meticulously arranging his father's funeral. Later, if not for Uncle Lin's loans and assistance, although Chu Jiang wouldn't have starved, his life would certainly have been incredibly difficult. He had never properly thanked him. Now that he had caught this giant soft-shelled turtle, he would pair it with He Shou Wu later and have a good drink with Uncle Lin, a gesture of gratitude for his kindness in helping bury his father.
