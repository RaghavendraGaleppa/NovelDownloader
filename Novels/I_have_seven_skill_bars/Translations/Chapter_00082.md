# Chapter 82: Finding Another Way

"Do you think human cultivators are as foolish as you?" the Long-tailed Wolf King scoffed. "We are wolves! We use fangs and claws. I disagreed with your shoddy poisons from the very beginning! You couldn't possibly not know that those human cultivators cultivate by growing plants, could you? Do you really think they wouldn't grow antidotes?"

"Their antidotes can't truly cure my poison; they can only temporarily restore their combat strength! I've researched it. They use Meridian-clearing Flowers as an antidote, and that kind of flower is incredibly difficult to cultivate. This is definitely their last stash!" the Fire-scarred Wolf King argued.

"You've said that three times already," the Long-tailed Wolf King's eyes were full of mockery.

"Then what do you propose? Are you going to directly attack them? With your fangs and claws?" the Fire-scarred Wolf King retorted. "I won't join you in a suicide mission!"

"We shouldn't have been so focused on that whatever-it-is relic!" The Long-tailed Wolf King's tail thrashed stiffly like a broom.

"Heh heh, do you think we're as cowardly as you?" the Fire-scarred Wolf King sneered.

*Swoosh!*

With a soft sound, the Long-tailed Wolf King appeared behind the Fire-scarred Wolf King, his claws stabbing directly towards the other's neck.

The Fire-scarred Wolf King's reaction was no slower. He twisted his body, turned his head, and opened his wide maw to bite at the incoming wolf claw.

*Clang!*

"This..." The Long-tailed Wolf King picked up the fragment that had appeared and examined it for a moment before the Fire-scarred Wolf King snatched it away.

"That's right!" the Fire-scarred Wolf King exclaimed excitedly. "I remember it clearly; the giant cauldron depicted on that map was exactly this color, and its patterns are nearly identical!" He then reeled in sudden realization.

"Indeed," the One-eyed Wolf King stated grimly, his gaze sweeping towards the Sect Domain, full of killing intent. "It's highly likely that those human cultivators have already discovered the relic and are trying to excavate its contents!"

"But shouldn't the core of the relic's formation still be in our hands?" the Long-tailed Wolf King added, no longer harboring any doubts. If this relic truly existed, no cultivator could remain unmoved.

Previously, the One-eyed Wolf King and the Fire-scarred Wolf King had fallen into the bottom of a lake during a sparring match, where they discovered a secret cave. Guarding this hidden cave was a python cultivator who had already died. The python cultivator wasn't enormous, nor was its cultivation high, but its entire body was as hard as iron. More importantly, even though it was dead, it could still move and fight! Even the two wolf kings, accustomed to brutal acts, were somewhat startled.

Even if others discovered it, they wouldn't be able to defeat that python cultivator. But now that they had obtained all of this, they naturally wouldn't let go easily. After multiple checks confirmed there were no omissions, the two wolf kings immediately destroyed the secret cave, obliterated the python cultivator's corpse to hide all traces, and then returned to the wolf cultivator tribe to inform the Long-tailed Wolf King. This was why the Long-tailed Wolf King had initially been skeptical; he hadn't witnessed it firsthand, only heard the one-sided accounts of the other two wolf kings. However, as time went on, the Long-tailed Wolf King grew increasingly convinced. He understood that the other two wolf kings would not joke with the tribe's lives, nor would they do something that amounted to digging their own graves.
