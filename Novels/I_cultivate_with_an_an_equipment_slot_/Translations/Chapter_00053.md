# Chapter 53: Mutation in the Equipment Slot  

Elder Liu was dead.  

For the Liu family, it was as if the heavens had collapsed. But in the grand scheme of the Tianmu Mountain Range, it barely caused a ripple.  

Moreover, Elder Liu's death served as a wake-up call for Zhang Yan.  

Cultivation—what truly mattered in the end was one's own strength!  

Unlike ordinary people, cultivators—especially those at the Foundation Establishment stage and above—could clearly sense their own lifespans. The torment of knowing one's impending death and inching toward it day by day was unbearable.  

"Since I don’t want to experience this torment, I must cultivate harder. If I can grow strong enough, fast enough, death will never catch up to me!" Zhang Yan silently resolved.  

After returning to his cave abode, he threw himself back into cultivation.  

From the fourth to the fifth and sixth levels of Qi Refining, there were almost no bottlenecks—so long as one's cultivation base was sufficient and their spiritual energy was refined, breakthroughs came easily. Only when advancing from the sixth to the seventh level of Qi Refining would a noticeable barrier emerge.  

Those with exceptional talent had nothing to worry about. Those with average aptitude could break through with persistent effort. But for those with extremely poor talent—like Zhang Yan—Barrier-Breaking Pills were necessary.  

Of course, Zhang Yan wasn’t entirely like others. He also cultivated the Pure Yang Virgin Technique, which would provide some assistance when the time came. If that still wasn’t enough, he could always resort to the pills.  

With half a year remaining until the sect competition, Zhang Yan spent nearly every waking moment cultivating.  

And so, half a year later...  

Inside his cave abode, Zhang Yan sat cross-legged on a meditation cushion, steadily absorbing spiritual energy.  

Suddenly, the spiritual energy within his body reached a critical point. Without hesitation, he gathered his energy and fiercely assaulted the bottleneck.  

Like relentless tides, wave after wave of spiritual energy crashed against the barriers in his meridians.  

*Crack—*  

With a sound like shattering glass, the spiritual energy surged through the newly opened pathways.  

**Fifth Level of Qi Refining!**  

At the same time, his **Equipment Slot** had unlocked its sixth position.  

Yet, inexplicably, a realization dawned upon him—his Equipment Slots were now **full**.  

No matter how much his cultivation advanced from this point on, no new slots would open. Instead, a new function would be unlocked upon reaching Foundation Establishment.  

"A new function?"  

Though he had long suspected that the number of Equipment Slots was limited, he had never imagined that they might evolve further.  

This revelation filled him with anticipation.  

Additionally, Zhang Yan noticed that the descriptions of his equipment had become more detailed.  

For example, the **Spiritual Hoe** given to him by Elder Lin previously displayed the following information:  

**[Name]:** Spiritual Hoe  
**[Quality]:** Gray  
**[Effects]:** Sharpness, Minor Plant Nurturing, Plant Identification  

Now, however, it had changed to:  

**[Name]:** Spiritual Hoe  
**[Quality]:** One-Star  
**[Equipment Tier]:** Lower First-Grade  
**[Effects]:** Sharpness (Lv.1), Minor Plant Nurturing, Plant Identification (Lv.2)  

Not only had an **Equipment Tier** been added, but some effects now had **level indicators** as well.  

"Could it be that after Foundation Establishment, the changes to my golden finger will be related to these?" Zhang Yan pondered.  

But with his current knowledge, he couldn’t confirm anything. He would have to wait until after his Foundation Establishment to find out.  

"Still, reaching Foundation Establishment will take a long time."  

Breaking through to Foundation Establishment was no easy feat—especially since Zhang Yan had decided to master as many techniques as possible before then, which would inevitably slow his progress.  

However, whether from ancient texts or other sources, he had repeatedly learned that **cultivating multiple techniques before Foundation Establishment was crucial**. Otherwise, forming **Divine Abilities** afterward would be impossible.  

The difference in combat power and potential between those with Divine Abilities and those without was staggering.  

Moreover, given Zhang Yan’s mediocre aptitude, his cultivation speed was already slow. This gave him ample time to practice techniques.  

"Alright, it’s about time to leave seclusion."  

After checking the hour, Zhang Yan changed into fresh robes and stepped out of his cave abode.  

"Young Master."  

Liu Yiting, his maidservant, hurried over upon seeing him emerge.  

"Focus on your cultivation. I’ll be accompanying Master on a trip," Zhang Yan said, patting her head.  

Liu Yiting’s spiritual roots weren’t bad—in fact, they were better than Zhang Yan’s, with one even reaching **mid-grade**. Unfortunately, her comprehension was lacking, making her progress in techniques painfully slow. Despite learning several, she remained stuck at the beginner stage—usable, but barely effective.  

Zhang Yan didn’t mind. After all, she was just a servant. If she couldn’t master techniques, she could still aim for Foundation Establishment without relying on them.  

For someone like her, who had no grand ambitions beyond extending her lifespan, reaching Foundation Establishment wasn’t an insurmountable challenge—especially with Zhang Yan’s backing as a **Core Formation disciple’s protégé**.  

But for Zhang Yan, mere longevity was far from enough.  

For Liu Yiting, however, it was a dream come true.  

"Yes, Young Master." She nodded obediently.  

Having grown up under Zhang Yan’s care and treated well, she occasionally acted playfully around him, her demeanor not overly formal.  

After settling matters with Liu Yiting, Zhang Yan headed to **Wood Spirit Peak**, where Mu Sen and several other senior brothers had already gathered.  

"Zhang Yan will accompany me this time," Elder Zhuge Wan announced.  

The reason Mu Sen and the others weren’t joining was simple—they had already reached **Foundation Establishment**, and this competition was for **new disciples**.  

Aside from Zhang Yan, Wood Spirit Peak had over a dozen Qi Refining disciples participating—mostly outer disciples, with a few being disciples of other elders.  

Among them, Zhang Yan’s cultivation level was among the lowest, yet **no one dared to underestimate him**.  

Who would dare look down on a **Core Formation elder’s personal disciple**?  

"Let’s go. I hope you all achieve good results."  

With a wave of Elder Zhuge Wan’s hand, a massive **emerald-green ribbon** unfurled in the sky. Though seemingly delicate, it radiated immense power.  

"A **magic treasure**!"  

Zhang Yan immediately recognized it as a **Core Formation artifact**.  

Qi Refining cultivators used **magical instruments**, Foundation Establishment cultivators wielded **spiritual tools**, and Core Formation experts commanded **magic treasures**—each vastly more powerful than the last.  

Unlike the former two, magic treasures could be **stored within the body** and **passed down through generations**. The longer a treasure was inherited, the stronger it became. Some, after dozens of generations, even developed **sentience**.  

This was Zhang Yan’s first time seeing a magic treasure. He couldn’t help but wonder when he would obtain one of his own.  

"What would happen if I could equip Master’s treasure in my **Equipment Slot**?"  

As he gazed at the ribbon, a peculiar thought crossed his mind.
