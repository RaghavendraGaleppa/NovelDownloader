# Chapter 425: Returning to the Divine Martial Realm

The True Martial Peak was now devoid of people, leaving Xu Yunfan to handle everything from gathering materials to miscellaneous chores alone. It was far too tedious to manage personally.

He naturally didn't need to spend time stabilizing his realm. With the aid of his attribute panel, upon entering the Foundation Establishment realm, it felt as if he had been immersed in it for a hundred years. His previous testing was merely because his hands were itching for action.

Suddenly.

Xu Yunfan raised his head, his gaze sharp as lightning, standing with his hands clasped behind his back atop the peak of True Martial Peak. The phantom of his three-headed, six-armed Dharma Form flickered in and out of existence behind him.

His Divine Sense swept through the surroundings. The Foundation Establishment Masters who were spying on him, whether openly or covertly, immediately felt as if they were facing a great threat.

In the clouds to the southeast, a sinister gaze trembled violently the moment it met Xu Yunfan's, retreating in panic as if burned. Even the clouds in that area became chaotic and dissipated.

On the cliff in the northwest corner, a Master's unrestrained probing was abruptly severed. During the collision of their Divine Senses, a sound like metal striking stone erupted. In the end, the opponent let out a muffled groan and retracted their gaze.

Three figures approaching side by side from the north were even more obviously stunned. Two of them immediately turned their clouds around. Only the purple-robed elder in the center endured for three breaths, maintaining eye contact. However, the moment the Xuanwu Dharma Form suddenly opened its eyes, his expression changed drastically. With a cold snort, he too retreated.

The mountain wind swept across the newly formed True Martial Peak, shredding the lingering traces of the fleeing Divine Senses to pieces.

Xu Yunfan's lips curled into a cold smile. The six arms of his Dharma Form simultaneously formed the Subduing Demon Seal. The spiritual energy within a ten-mile radius instantly boiled like hot oil.

The gazes still spying in the shadows were struck as if by lightning, rapidly retracting and avoiding him.

He clearly heard the crisp sound of objects falling from several miles away, along with two or three hurriedly activated escape lights that tilted and crashed into distant mountain ranges.

"If you want to watch, do so openly and aboveboard."

Xu Yunfan's voice was like the clashing of metal and iron, causing the scales of the Xuanwu statue atop the peak to clatter. "With such sneaky behavior, how can you still call yourselves Masters?"

As he spoke the final word, he deliberately infused the Sound of the Word into his voice.

Visible ripples spread out, causing seven or eight deeply hidden Divine Sense marks to manifest, burning into green smoke in the air.

A dense shattering sound echoed throughout the sky above True Martial Peak; it was unknown how many spying artifacts were destroyed in that moment.

The disciples observing at the foot of the mountain saw a piercing black light suddenly erupt from the top of True Martial Peak. When their vision recovered, the Foundation Establishment Senior Brothers who were usually high and mighty had already dispersed by more than half.

*At least six Foundation Establishment Masters,* Xu Yunfan thought, feeling a bit surprised. He didn't expect the Primordial Origin Sect to have so many Foundation Establishment cultivators, and this was just the vanguard.

He immediately waved his hand, and thirty-six small flags appeared in his sleeve.

"The quality is a bit lacking..."

These small flags were low-grade artifacts looted from Xu Tian and the others. Now, with his spiritual energy infused into them, the flags' quality was barely able to withstand the power, humming with vibration.

He tapped lightly with his fingertips, and the thirty-six small flags flew out one after another, drawing trails of spiritual light in the air.

Following the key points for setting up the "Concealing Stars and Covering Moon Formation" from the *Introduction to the Dao of Formations*, he drove the small flags into the vein nodes surrounding True Martial Peak.

Every time a flag was planted, ripples of formation patterns appeared on the ground, and the cloud seal inscriptions on the flagpoles lit up with green light.

"The Kan position is missing one, the Li palace needs three more."

He formed a hand seal and shouted softly. Three blood crystals flew out from his sleeve.

Xu Yunfan looked at the blood crystals carefully. These were blood essences refined by the mad disciples of the demonic sects through blood sacrifices of mortals.

He naturally disdained such methods. Although he was a Master of the demonic sect, he considered himself a righteous figure.

"If I, Xu, want to cultivate, I will seize things openly and rightfully... or rather, engage in fair transactions."

He spoke righteously to himself. "Using experience packs obtained by bullying mortals is beneath me, even. It's no wonder these Qi Condensation disciples are viewed as cannon fodder."

He tossed the blood crystals into the formation's core; currently, this was all he had.

Strictly speaking, as a Foundation Establishment Master, he was indeed unusually poor.

The trembling small flags immediately stabilized. The flag surfaces moved without wind, connecting invisible silk threads in the void.

As the final formation pattern closed, a thin mist suddenly rose from the peak, shrouding the entire True Martial Peak.

Seeing the entire True Martial Peak enveloped in hazy mist, the probing Divine Senses retreated like a tide.

On a cloud terrace within the Primordial Origin Sect, several Foundation Establishment Masters gathered, looking at the distant True Martial Peak with various expressions.

The first to speak was a middle-aged cultivator in a green robe. Holding a jade folding fan, he tapped it lightly against his palm, a look of surprise flashing in his eyes.

"I didn't expect that having condensed the Divine Martial Dao Foundation, he is also proficient in the Dao of Formations. It's quite surprising."

Next to him, an old man with white hair and a childlike face stroked his beard and chuckled lightly. "Proficient? Not necessarily."

He narrowed his eyes, his gaze seeming to penetrate the thin mist. "It's just the 'Concealing Stars and Covering Moon Formation' from the *Introduction to the Dao of Formations*. The grade isn't high. But..."

The old man paused, his tone adding a touch of admiration. "To be able to adjust and set it up according to the mountain's terrain and the nodes of spiritual energy, and use it so skillfully, is not easy. I didn't expect there to be such talent in our Sacred Sect."

"Heh," a black-clothed cultivator with a sinister face sneered. "It seems unlike the previous one. Legend has it that he was stubborn, provoking others everywhere right after reaching Foundation Establishment. Relying on his invincible combat power within the same realm, he made enemies everywhere, resulting in his death and the dispersal of his spirit. He didn't realize that direct confrontation is the most inferior method."

Foundation Establishment cultivators can already glimpse the principles of cause and effect, naturally well-versed in the art of laying out plans from afar.

The Foundation Establishment Masters of the Primordial Origin Sect are particularly skilled in this; each is a master at manipulating cause and effect.

Some play chess on cloud terraces, others fish for fortune on mountain peaks. They appear to be carefree immortals, but in reality, they have already laid down killing mechanisms thousands of miles away.

However, sometimes, once the other party flips the table, no one gets to play anymore, and they can only fight with real weapons and spears. The Masters of the demonic sect will naturally teach others why it is called a demonic sect.

The green-robed cultivator nodded upon hearing this, snapping his fan shut with a *pa*. "That is true. After coming out from the Divine Martial Realm, he knew how to lie low and wait. Later, he became a disciple of a True Lord, and now he has soared to the sky. It is truly the way of the times and the decree of fate."

He looked meaningfully at the others. "I think that the vacant position of the Fruit might actually fall on his head."

"The Fruit?" The white-haired old woman who had been silent all along suddenly spoke, her voice hoarse like sandpaper rubbing. "How can Golden Core be so easily obtained?"

She pinched a string of dark red prayer beads with her thin, bony fingers, moving one bead for every word she spoke. "Which of us hasn't gone through three lifetimes of reincarnation and endured a thousand calamities? Some..."

A shadow passed through the old woman's eyes. "...couldn't even return to Foundation Establishment, forever trapped in the sea of suffering in the cycle of reincarnation."

On True Martial Peak, after fully setting up the formation and completing the concealment, Xu Yunfan let out a soft breath.

These fellows from the Primordial Origin Sect have incredibly strong desires to spy; they try every means to probe. Without some tricks and formations, it would be truly difficult to block them.

Next, he needed to return to the Divine Martial Realm to bring up Bi Yuan and the others.

The disciples of the Sacred Sect were untrustworthy. If he pulled them over temporarily, they would likely scatter like birds the moment they faced a bit of pressure. Only Bi Yuan and the others were absolutely heart-to-heart with him.

*(Everyone, I'm really sorry, I was held up by matters today. For now, just one chapter. I will release four chapters tomorrow.)*
