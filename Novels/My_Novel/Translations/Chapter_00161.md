Chapter 161: Adding True Meaning, Heaven Round and Earth Square

“Excellent archery!” Luo Xia blurted out, her eyes filled with admiration. Li Xian remained modest and composed, casually acknowledging the praise as he rode his horse over to the old woman.

Four arrows were fired in succession, piercing the abdomen, chest, and skull with precision, ruthlessness, and swiftness. The old woman was pinned to the tree, blood dripping down the arrow shafts. Her eyes were wide open, filled with unwillingness. Her legs twitched and kicked against the ground, but her life had already been extinguished.

To ensure certainty, Li Xian channe his Qi and delivered another palm strike, shattering her internal organs. The old woman died instantly. Li Xian still did not approach, waiting a moment longer until he was certain she was completely dead before starting to search the body.

“A Heaven-Concealing Box?”

There was an unexpected surprise. Hidden in the lining of the old woman’s chest was a small box. The lid was carved with the character for “Round,” and the body of the box was carved with the character for “Square.” Round refers to the sky, square refers to the earth.

This world believes in the concept of a round heaven and a square earth, with the heavens and earth being vast and boundless. With his experiences from two lifetimes, Li Xian dared not say otherwise.

The exquisite flesh inside had already been eaten, but a smell remained. The box could hold five grams of the flesh. It was about the size of two fingers, making it extremely easy to store. It could be hidden in a sleeve or in one's chest without leaving a trace.

This item was precious. Li Xian kept it for himself and continued his search...

This old woman had a natural, strange obsession: she liked to collect the toe bones of children. She would polish them until they were smooth and jade-like, then make them into necklaces to wear.

Aside from this, there was nothing else. Li Xian pondered, “This old woman’s strength wasn't bad; she should have had a considerable fortune. I was hoping to find some martial arts manuals.”

He then quickly let it go. He himself possessed outstanding martial arts, but the manuals, essential principles, and training methods were all memorized in his mind. He generally didn't carry them on his person.

Zhang Hou said, “Sir, a cave was discovered to the west! It seems to be where the old woman lived. It's just...” He trailed off, looking like he was about to vomit. He forcefully suppressed it with his internal Qi.

Li Xian said, “Take me to see.”

Passing through a dense forest, they indeed found a cave. Luo Xia was also there. Li Xian asked, “What's the situation?” He saw that the nearby patrol officers all had pained expressions on their faces.

“You'll understand once you go in and take a look,” Luo Xia said calmly.

The inside of the cave was dark, piled high with white bones. Deep inside, there was a large pot with soup steaming in it, a fire burning underneath. The pot emitted a foul, bloody smell mixed with the scent of seasonings.

Li Xian took one sniff and immediately held his breath, taking a half-step back. The scene inside the pot was even more horrifying.

Several children's corpses were floating in the soup.

Li Xian frowned tightly and averted his gaze. He discovered a bed in the corner. Under the bed was a book that recorded the old woman's experiences in eating children.

It turned out this person had a perverse and evil nature. She enjoyed devouring children, and after eating them for a long time, her evil obsession grew increasingly stronger. She even began to change her methods.

The records in the book were extremely cruel, unbearable to look at.

The old woman had invented several dishes: “Child Head Meat,” “Boiled Child”... She would shave the “ingredients” clean and pour hot oil over them. She would listen to their howls until they were “cooked”...

The scenes were shocking and made one's back run cold with fear.

Li Xian thought angrily, “It was too easy a death for her!” He threw the recipe into the fire and quickly burned it away.

He searched again and found a communication letter under the bed.

He discovered more clues: the old woman had committed many crimes, but under the protection of the Cao family, she had shed her criminal identity and had actually become the “Birth Registrar” of Qiongfu City. She held an official position, recording the birth of infants each year.

“The Cao family is truly detestable,” Li Xian cursed. The Cao family knew of the old woman's obsession and deliberately placed her as a “Birth Registrar.” With just a few infants, they had recruited a flesh-eating martial artist.

“Sir, what should be done with this place?” Zhang Hou asked.

Li Xian said, “Burn it all to the ground. Zhang Hou, you should visit the surrounding villages and ask if any children have gone missing.”

“For the families of the missing children, inform them of the details. Additionally... take some of the reward money and distribute it to them as comfort. Do any of you have any objections?”

“Sir is merciful. It is what we could only hope for,” Zhang Hou said.

The other patrol officers and some skilled fighters from the various martial arts sects all nodded and said, “We will follow Sir's decision.”

“Good!” Li Xian said loudly, “Then it is decided!”

A great fire raged, burning away the sins. Luo Xia looked at Li Xian and said, “You truly have the bearing of a great general.”

Li Xian was taken aback. “Why do you say that?”

“Governing an army with strictness is nothing strange. Governing an army with benevolence is as difficult as ascending to heaven.” Luo Xia pointed to the patrol officers and said, “The officers of your Wushui Hall were originally loyal to the bone. But here, half of them are skilled fighters from the county's sects.”

“They are now completely in awe of you. It seems they wish to pledge their allegiance to you.”

“In military campaigns, using strict military law to discipline the army is a common tactic. If military orders are strict, no one dares to disobey, and the army has combat effectiveness. Benevolence would only cause the army's formation to crumble. But you are able to show benevolence while also making people submit willingly. That is extremely difficult.”

Luo Xia said, “If you were to join the military, you would surely achieve great things.” Her eyes shone as she added, “Consider it?”

Li Xian shrugged and said, “My aspirations lie elsewhere. There is no need to consider it.”

He looked up at the black smoke hanging in the air and said slowly, “My aspiration is to roam the heavens and earth, and also to play in the world of men. I avoid the battles of the military field at all costs.”

Luo Xia laughed and said, “That's true enough. Since ancient times, those in the military must be overbearing and fierce in temperament. Although you have such talent, you would certainly not enjoy the battlefield.”

“Having said that, if you want to roam the heavens and earth, why don't you act on it? Could it be that you are attached to the power of a Wushui officer?”

Li Xian said, “This Wushui position is as light as a goose feather to me.”

“Then what is it...” Luo Xia asked, “Is there another reason that prevents you from leaving? Could it be that you already have a beloved woman?”

Li Xian coughed twice, changing the subject. What other reason could there be? Naturally, he had taken benefits from the Madam, and the Madam kept a tight watch on him. He was not his own master.

Even a mighty and extraordinary Wushui officer could have unspeakable troubles.

The matter was settled.

It was already dark, and it was still some distance to Qingning County. Li Xian turned his horse and headed for Huangyu City, booking over a dozen rooms at an inn to stay for the night.

That night, Li Xian paid out of his own pocket to host a banquet at the “Jade Immortal Tower” to treat his brothers.

Luo Xia was also present. She made an audacious request and actually ordered two jars of “Fierce Bear Wine.” This wine was incredibly potent; one sip would make you drunk, being drunk would make you dizzy, and being dizzy would make you lose consciousness.

Luo Xia held a wine jar and drank directly from it, her bold and uninhibited spirit not losing to any man in the slightest. The patrol officers all praised her, “Sister Luo is mighty!” “Sister Luo is mighty!”

“Useless!” Luo Xia cursed. “A bunch of useless things, you can't even out-drink this old woman.”

Everyone looked awkward. Li Xian was also a little annoyed. He already felt stifled by the Madam's control and his lack of freedom, and he was unwilling to be suppressed by a woman again. He said, “Hmph, I've never been much of a drinker, but I'd like to compete with you in drinking!”

He ordered another jar of Fierce Bear Wine. He tore off the seal and took a big swig. The wine was pungent and spicy as it entered his mouth, burning its way from his intestines into his stomach, scorching his heart, liver, and lungs. The first sip made Li Xian grimace from the spiciness.

But thanks to his [Consume] skill, he adapted quickly. Luo Xia put one foot up on the table and said boldly, “Good kid, you're the first one to dare compete with this old woman in drinking. Since we've started, don't you dare surrender!”

Li Xian, filled with heroic spirit, felt a sense of exhilaration after eliminating the evil. Fueled by the alcohol, his joy, heroism, and spirit mixed together. He laughed and said, “Bring it on! I'm a real man, am I afraid of you?”

“This old woman will drink you under the table!” Luo Xia felt greatly provoked. She held the wine jar in one hand, took a big gulp, and said, “Your turn.”

Li Xian, unwilling to be outdone, also drank heavily from the jar.

They took turns drinking. For the first time in his life, he was in a drinking contest, and it had a rather unique flavor.

The other attendants, as well as the skilled fighters from the various martial arts halls and sects, all cheered and urged them on. As the two drank to their hearts' content, the other guests in the tavern all turned to look.

With his [Consume] skill, Li Xian was truly winning by an unfair advantage. Seeing that Luo Xia was already dizzy but still persisting, Li Xian quickly said, “Forget it, I'll say you won. I can't drink anymore.”

“I... I told you...” Luo Xia mumbled. “You can't... out-drink... this old woman...” She closed her eyes and fell asleep, starting to snore.

Li Xian smiled. The banquet was now coming to an end.

A skilled fighter from the Snake Walk Sect suddenly stood up and said, “Li Wushui, after working with you this time, I am truly convinced! Here's a toast to you!”

He drained his cup in one go. Li Xian returned the gesture and also drained his bowl.

“Li Wushui, take a look at my skills. Could I join your Wushui Hall? I'll be graduating from the Bear's Might Martial Arts Hall this year. To be honest, working with you feels secure. Even if I die, it would be with peace of mind.”

A big, burly man spoke directly.

In these chaotic times, acting with benevolence and righteousness would always attract followers with lofty ideals. Most people in the world drift with the current because they have no better choice.

The Snake Walk Sect, the Red Copper Sect... they committed many crimes of murder, robbery, and oppressing the common people. Those who were part of them also did these things, and they didn't find anything wrong with it.

Everyone around them was numb, and no one was benevolent. Why think too much and add to their troubles? Even if they were unwilling in their hearts, they just let themselves drift with the waves and go with the wind.

But if a person appears who subdues them with his strength, wins their hearts with his spirit, and intimidates them with his霸气 (dominance). He acts decisively, has a compassionate heart, but does not ruin his main business.

He stands out vividly before everyone, giving them another choice for the future.

Naturally, some people would be willing to break free from the crowd and follow him to the death.

Li Xian said with a smile, “If you join my Wushui Hall, you must abide by the rules.”

“No problem, I've already inquired about it!” The big man beamed with joy.

The others were also tempted, their minds growing enthusiastic. Some expressed their intentions on the spot, while others remained observers.

Qingning County.

Li Xian honored his promise and gave fifteen taels of silver to Luo Xia. Luo Xia grunted in response. She was still resentful about losing the drinking contest last night and felt tired.

She took the money, went back to her room, and fell into a deep sleep.

The Wushui Hall was tasked with apprehending “Red List Criminals.” Their heads, index fingers, and big toes were taken as proof. After submitting them to the “Patrolling Heaven Division,” one could only wait quietly for several months for the funds to be allocated.

Of the ten on the Red List, Li Xian had hunted down six. The “proofs” were all wrapped in “camphor leaves” to prevent decay. He had not yet reported to the Patrolling Heaven Division.

Li Xian thought, “I wonder where that Granny Lin has gone. If I could see her and give her these proofs, perhaps I could skip the intermediate steps and get more reward money.”

The heads of the six criminals were stored in the treasury. Li Xian knew the funds would be difficult to get in the next few months. So, he paid out of his own pocket to advance some silver as报酬 (payment) for his brothers.

[Great Luo Saber Art]
[Mastery: 16/50000, Pinnacle Mastery]

Success came naturally.

Li Xian had added another martial art to his pinnacle mastery. His internal Qi surged, growing to nineteen zhang in length. His strength was formidable, and he had gained another reward.

[Your Four Directions Fist, Breeze Legs, Jade Luo Palm, and Great Luo Saber Art have all reached Pinnacle Mastery.]
[By analogy, you have comprehended the “Essence of Basic Martial Arts.” Your cultivation speed for all basic martial arts is now faster.]
