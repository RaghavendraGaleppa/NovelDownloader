# Chapter 31: You Be My Timely Rain, I'll Be Your Everlasting Sunshine

Cheng Dakuan lay on the couch, his face a sallow yellow.

He lived in the right wing of the first courtyard in the main house's compound, with a separate suite consisting of a main room and a side room.

His family did not live in the manor. To take care of him, his wife had brought the children up the mountain.

The Leopard's Head had two sons and one daughter. The eldest was seven, the second five, and the youngest daughter not yet one year old.

His wife had to care for her husband, so the eldest son, very sensibly, took on the responsibility of looking after his younger siblings. He carried his baby sister in her swaddling clothes and played with his brother in the courtyard, acting like a little adult.

Suddenly, four or five burly men dressed in guards' attire walked in.

Seeing the unfriendly looks on their faces, the eldest quickly placed his sister on the stone table, ran over to grab his brother, and watched them timidly.

The burly men walked up to Cheng Dakuan's room. They paused for a moment, their expressions hesitant.

After a quiet discussion, one of them coughed and called out in a loud voice, "Is Sister-in-law Cheng home?"

Sister-in-law Cheng was sitting by the bedside, watching her unconscious husband with a face full of worry. In this era, a severe cold and high fever could truly be fatal. When she first heard that her husband had gotten into trouble and was gravely ill, she felt as if her world was collapsing. She didn't even wait for the spring plowing season; she immediately packed a bag and brought her three children up the mountain.

For the past few days, she had been crying every day. She had even imagined the miserable future of how she would raise her three children if her husband passed away, over and over again.

Now, aside from taking medicine, eating porridge, and getting up to relieve himself, her husband was still unconscious most of the time. Fortunately, his fever was subsiding, which gave her a little peace of mind.

Suddenly hearing someone call from outside, she wiped the tear stains from her eyes and walked out.

Sister-in-law Cheng was just over thirty, and her looks weren't bad; she had a certain charm. However, since her husband worked for the Yu family and she had been raising the children alone in the countryside, she inevitably bore the weathered look of hardship.

"Brothers, what is this..." Sister-in-law Cheng said, looking at the men. They didn't seem to be here to visit Dakuan, and she was a bit surprised.

The lead guard looked slightly embarrassed. "Sister-in-law Cheng, this house was assigned to Brother Cheng... because he was the guard captain. But now..."

He rubbed his hands and forced a smile. "Sister-in-law, you see..."

Sister-in-law Cheng understood immediately. They were here to kick them out.

A fire of anger flared up in her heart, and her voice became sharp. "Brothers, my man isn't dead yet, and you're already in a hurry to make us move out? Are you afraid he'll die in this house and ruin your good feng shui?"

Not all the guards were thick-skinned; two of them immediately blushed crimson. The lead guard was also very embarrassed, but the thought that this was his "letter of allegiance" to the new captain, Liu Yu, made him harden his heart and darken his expression.

"Sister-in-law Cheng, your man was punished by the Clan Lord for failing to protect the Young Master. The Clan Lord not killing him is already a great mercy; we can't be too greedy. Now, Captain Liu is being generous and told us to clean up that corner room by the west wall. If you move there yourselves, you can still save some face. If not..."

The new captain, Liu Yu, lived next door, separated only by a wall. In fact, Liu Yu's residence and Cheng Dakuan's were originally one small courtyard, which had been divided into two by a wall built in the middle.

Sister-in-law Cheng's anger flared. Years of camaraderie weren't worth as much as the greed for a small courtyard? My Dakuan isn't dead yet, and the tea has already gone cold before the guest has even left?

Overwhelmed by grief and indignation, tears streamed down her face. She cried out in despair, "You really are Dakuan's good brothers! My man hasn't even breathed his last, and you're already in such a rush to drive us out."

With a "thump," she fell to her knees. "I beg you, please, just let us leave. Wait until the lid is nailed on my man's coffin. I'm afraid he'll wake up and find out how his good brothers have treated him; he'd be angered to death. I beg you..."

As she spoke, she began kowtowing with a "bang, bang, bang," startling the guards into jumping back and scattering to the sides.

Cornered by Sister-in-law Cheng, the lead guard's face flushed with shame and embarrassment. He said awkwardly, "Sister-in-law Cheng... we're just following orders, please don't make things difficult for us little guys..."

Liu Yu was on the other side of the wall, listening intently. Hearing that this scoundrel had dragged his name into it, his old face grew hot, and he was instantly overcome with shame and anger.

The two Cheng sons, seeing their mother being bullied, rushed over to help her up. But Sister-in-law Cheng, as if mad, just kept kowtowing. Her forehead was already bleeding. The two children were terrified and burst into loud sobs.

The baby girl on the stone table, hearing her mother and brothers crying, also began to wail.

This scene made the several hardened men, who could kill without blinking an eye, break out in a cold sweat. This was a damn inhuman thing to do! But... since they were already here, if they left with their tails between their legs, wouldn't Captain Liu make life difficult for them in the future?

The lead guard hardened his heart and said fiercely, "Sister-in-law Cheng, it's no use crying and making a scene today. If you move out quickly, you can still save some face. If not, we brothers will have to help you be 'respectable'!"

On the other side of the wall, a得意的冷笑 (triumphant cold smile) appeared at the corner of Liu Yu's mouth. He had sent these men over today not because he was in a hurry to occupy the whole courtyard, but to anger Cheng Dakuan to death.

He knew just how powerful Cheng Dakuan's skills were. For a full twenty years, he had lived in Cheng Dakuan's shadow. Liu Yu was unwilling to live his whole life under that shadow, especially since no one knew if the main house would continue to exist. Once the main house "falls and the monkeys scatter," the higher he climbed now and the more useful he was in the Clan Lord's eyes, the better his way out would be then. So, he had to move this "stumbling block" out of the way quickly.

Seeing Cheng Dakuan's condition improve over the past two days, he had been unable to eat or sleep, burning with anxiety. For more than twenty years, he had followed Cheng Dakuan, standing guard in the wind and snow, and accompanying the Clan Lord on thousand-mile journeys. He understood Cheng Dakuan's temperament and character better than anyone. He knew that when Cheng Dakuan woke up and found his wife crying, his children making a fuss, and his whole family being crammed into a clutter-filled corner room with a window so small a head couldn't even fit through, a man like Cheng Dakuan would be enraged to the point his lungs would burst. The extreme cold and fever had already damaged his internal organs. If, in his weakened state, his Qi and blood rushed to his heart, even if Cheng Dakuan didn't die, he would be left with an incurable ailment. Then he would pose no more threat.

In the room, Cheng Dakuan lay on his back. In his stupor, he faintly heard a commotion of crying and shouting, and it was getting clearer and clearer. He thought vaguely, "Could it be that I'm already dead? Is this my wife and children crying at my funeral?" Gradually, his consciousness began to clear, and he could make out the sounds of crying and shouting from outside.

A sudden fire ignited in Cheng Dakuan's heart, and his thirty years of iron will shattered into dust. As his throat convulsed, a mouthful of phlegm and blood spurted onto the bed, blooming into a dazzling red plum blossom.

With a "creak," the door was pushed open. Two guards walked in—these were men he had personally trained.

The two guards had just stepped one foot inside when they met two sharp, fierce eyes, like those of a trapped beast. The two guards were instantly startled, caught in a dilemma. Hadn't Captain Liu said he was on his last breath? How was this...? In this situation, asking them to go in and carry the Leopard's Head to the storeroom, they really couldn't bring themselves to do it.

Just then, a voice rang out in the courtyard: "What are you doing? What's wrong with Captain Cheng?"

Yang Can had just come from Accountant Li's place. Thinking he had nothing else to do, he had come to Cheng Dakuan's residence. He had been busy these past few days. After having Cheng Dakuan brought from the water dungeon back to his room and arranging for a physician to treat him, Yang Can had gone off to take care of his own matters. He figured that Cheng Dakuan was originally a guard captain, and with the other guards looking after him, there was nothing to worry about. As for Cheng Dakuan's persistent high fever, Yang Can knew it was an external manifestation of the body's immune system trying to restore its functions. In such cases, one had to rely on the physician's prescriptions and medicine, as well as on Cheng Dakuan himself to pull through. It was useless for him to stand guard there.

Now that he had finished his tasks, he had come to visit, only to hear crying in the courtyard. Yang Can was startled. He took the steps two at a time and hurried into the courtyard. He saw a woman kneeling on the ground, crying her heart out, with two children pulling at her and crying along with her. Several guards stood by, at a loss. Yang Can thought that Cheng Dakuan hadn't made it and had passed away, which was why he asked.

When he understood the situation, his face immediately darkened. "Although Cheng Dakuan is no longer the guard captain, how he is to be arranged is not for you to decide!" Yang Can pointed at the house, his voice stern. "Whether he continues to live here, and if not, who the house is assigned to, that is for Steward Li to decide. Who gave you the authority to act on your own?"

The guards, questioned by Yang Can, stammered and didn't dare to answer.

In the courtyard next door, Liu Yu stamped his foot. He wanted to come over and smooth things over, but after taking two steps, he timidly stopped. Steward Yang was clearly protecting the Leopard's Head. If he went out now and said he knew nothing about this, it would be really hard to justify. After hesitating, Liu Yu chose to be a coward, as if not showing up meant the incident never happened. In the end, Liu Yu was just a man with grandiose ambitions but little ability. He could only be wicked in the shadows, without the courage to be an outright villain.

"As for how to arrange for Cheng Dakuan, I, the Steward, will discuss it with the Head Steward. It is not for you to decide on your own. Get out!" Yang Can roared.

The guards, who were already in a difficult position, felt as if they had been granted a reprieve and hurriedly scrambled out.

Yang Can gently comforted Sister-in-law Cheng a few times. Hearing the baby still crying on the stone table, he quickly asked her to go and soothe the child first. Yang Can then patted the two children's heads, straightened his clothes, and walked into the room.

The Leopard's Head was propping himself up on the bed with one hand, trembling as he tried to sit up. He hadn't shed a tear when he was being bullied, but now his eyes were blurred with tears, and he couldn't even make out Yang Can's face clearly.

Seeing him like this, Yang Can rushed forward a few steps to support him, saying joyfully, "Dakuan, you're getting better! Lie down, lie down, don't get up." He pushed him back onto the bed. Seeing that Dakuan wanted to speak, he smiled. "You don't have to ask, I understand."

Yang Can sat down by the bed and said, "Ever since you came out of the water dungeon, the Clan Lord has been ignoring you. Don't feel heartless about it. The way the Clan Lord has handled this means that what happened before is considered over." He patted the Leopard's Head's large hand. "I told you, as long as you don't die, there will be a day when you can make a comeback. First, get your illness cured. Then, I'll take you to be HAPPY and fly!"

Master Yang was talking nonsense again!

However, this time, the Leopard's Head didn't ask him what "happy" meant. The Leopard's Head smiled, and with a heavy nod, he said, "Master Yang, I trust you! From now on, I, the Leopard's Head, will fly with you!"
