# Chapter 18: Cooperation  

At dawn, Zhou Qing began his cultivation routine as usual.  

Having just completed a set of the Five Animal Exercises, he was slightly sweaty and preparing to delve deeper into the Tiger and Deer forms when a knock came at his door.  

"Scholar Zhou, are you home?"  

Recognizing the voice as Chunxiang, a maidservant from the Lin household, Zhou Qing donned his outer robe and went to answer.  

Chunxiang seemed delighted to see him, as if Zhou Qing had never once punched her.  

"Scholar Zhou, my young mistress has reserved a private room at Furongji and invites you to join her for breakfast. She hopes you'll honor her with your presence."  

"Miss Chunxiang, what matter does your mistress wish to discuss with me?"  

Chunxiang replied, "The medicinal pills you gave me last time were very effective. When my mistress learned of them, she wished to speak with you about them."  

Zhou Qing smiled inwardly—just as he had expected. "Then please lead the way, Miss Chunxiang."  

Furongji was located in the western part of the city, less than two li from Zhou Qing's residence. For an ordinary person, the walk would take no more than fifteen minutes.  

The Lin family's old estate was secluded and quiet, but within a li of the journey to Furongji, the streets began bustling with activity.  

As Zhou Qing observed his surroundings, he noticed beggars scattered throughout the market.  

Casually, he asked Chunxiang, "Miss Chunxiang, have many refugees been fleeing to Jiangzhou recently?"  

Chunxiang sighed. "According to my mistress, this year's drought has been severe, and many people are fleeing famine. There are even reports of unrest among the tribal chieftains in the mountains. The pacification commissioner of Changzhou has already issued conscription notices."  

She paused before adding, "I'm fortunate to serve my mistress, but I've heard the authorities plan to impose additional levies on city residents. In a day or two, they'll also stop allowing refugees into the city. My mistress says the world is descending into chaos."  

In her eyes, Zhou Qing was a man of higher status—a scholar and the top candidate in the examinations. Ordinarily, she wouldn’t have so many opportunities to converse with someone like him. Seeing that Zhou Qing remained silent, she eagerly poured out everything she knew.  

Zhou Qing listened thoughtfully.  

As they neared Furongji, Chunxiang said, "Scholar Zhou, are you worried about unrest in the city? Your current residence is rather remote—perhaps you should consider moving? Though, as a scholar, most thieves wouldn’t dare target you."  

Thieves always scouted their targets beforehand.  

Stealing from a scholar’s home was far less appealing than robbing a merchant.  

First, a scholar like Zhou Qing had a well-known background and was unlikely to have much wealth. Second, even thieves held some reverence for the educated. Third, if a scholar reported a theft, the authorities would take it seriously, making it more trouble than it was worth.  

For an ordinary merchant, even if they reported the crime, the authorities wouldn’t pay much attention.  

"But this is only the beginning. If the world grows even more chaotic and order collapses, nothing can be certain," Zhou Qing mused.  

For him, even the worst order was better than no order at all.

"Scholar Zhou, these are Furongji’s soup dumplings—they’re delicious. Please try one."  

In the private room, the young mistress of the Lin family was dressed in men's attire as usual, with bodyguards standing behind her and Chunxiang attending at her side.  

Women of wealthy families like hers were acutely aware of the changing times and had strengthened their personal security.  

Zhou Qing noticed a detail—the way the young mistress sat.  

After mastering the Tiger Form and Black Tiger Steals the Heart, Zhou Qing had developed a heightened sensitivity to martial practitioners. He could tell from her posture that she likely had some martial training.  

It was an indescribable feeling.  

Yet, her hands lacked the roughness typical of those who practiced martial arts.  

Zhou Qing picked up a soup dumpling, its skin bursting with rich, fragrant broth.  

The young mistress observed him. Most impoverished scholars would either feign restraint or display poor table manners when eating such delicate fare.  

Zhou Qing, however, carried himself with natural ease.  

"Scholar Zhou, have you had this kind of breakfast before?"  

Zhou Qing replied, "I had it as a child. The meat is mixed with scallion and ginger water rather than pre-made aspic, so it tastes fresher."  

The young mistress said, "I’ve heard that Scholar Zhou isn’t originally from Jiangzhou but moved here from elsewhere. Your family must have been quite well-off. If that’s the case, is the medicinal pill also a family recipe?"  

Zhou Qing understood her caution as a businesswoman—she wanted to confirm the origin of the recipe before discussing cooperation.  

If the recipe wasn’t in Zhou Qing’s possession, this breakfast meeting would still serve as a chance to build rapport.  

But her primary interest remained the recipe.  

Though Zhou Qing was young and full of potential, who knew if the world would still be peaceful by the time he passed the provincial examinations?  

In times of chaos, the status of scholars would inevitably decline.  

She had consulted experts about the pill’s ingredients. While they were common and inexpensive, the precise proportions were crucial. Any mistake could lead to adverse effects, which would harm the Lin family’s reputation.  

Thus, obtaining the recipe was essential.  

The pill’s greatest advantage was that prolonged use imparted a natural herbal fragrance to the body. Similar "cold fragrance" pills were only affordable for the wealthiest families, but this one could be used by moderately affluent households as well.  

Though the world hadn’t yet descended into complete chaos, this pill could help the Lin family quickly amass a fortune, providing a financial cushion against future risks.  

Moreover, large-scale trade caravans were now highly risky, especially when transporting conspicuous goods.  

Pills like these, however, were easy to carry and conceal for sale elsewhere.  

"The Five Fragrance Pill is indeed a family recipe, but I can’t guarantee that no one else possesses it."  

"I’ve consulted several experienced physicians, and they all agreed that this formula must be a unique secret—they’ve never encountered anything like it. Scholar Zhou, speaking as a businesswoman, I’d like to propose a partnership."  

Zhou Qing finished his dumpling and wiped his mouth.  

"Young Master Lin, I know little of business matters. As a scholar in mourning, involving myself in such affairs would be improper. However, the Lin family has done me many favors, and I remember this kindness. Since you’re interested in the Five Fragrance Pill, how about this—I’ll arrange for an intermediary to discuss the details with you."  

"Scholar Zhou speaks wisely. Who do you intend to appoint?"  

"Butcher Hu, who accompanied me when I rented your family’s old estate."  

"Ah, him. That will do. Have him come see me when the time comes. The bill has been settled—please enjoy the rest of your meal at leisure. I must take my leave now."  

"Very well. Farewell, Young Master Lin."  

---  

Cooperation with the Lin family was necessary—without them, Zhou Qing would have no reliable sales channel. If the profits were substantial, he planned to prepare a nourishing pill for daily use to aid his Five Animal Exercises cultivation.  

Unfortunately, his rooster, Morning Sun, hadn’t caught any more of those snakes to feed him.  

Of all the food and tonics Zhou Qing had consumed so far, the snake meat and gallbladder from that day remained the most effective.  

He headed to Butcher Hu’s shop to find him.  

At the back of the shop, Butcher Hu was lounging in the shade.  

When he saw Zhou Qing, he didn’t rise immediately—until Zhou Qing spoke.  

"Brother Hu, do you want to get rich?"  

Butcher Hu jolted. He had long anticipated this day, but he never imagined... it would come so soon!
