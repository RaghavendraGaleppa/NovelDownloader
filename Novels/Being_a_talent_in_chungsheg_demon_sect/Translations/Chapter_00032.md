## Chapter 32: Target: Liu Xin!

[You were crushed to death by the Butian Peak Master's single finger.]

[Current remaining pages of the Hundred Lifetimes Book: 95]

[Restarting a life, you can choose one of the following gains from your previous life:
One: Treasure.
Two: Cultivation.
Three: Lifespan.
Four: Give up all gains, randomly awaken a talent based on your previous life's experience.]

"Those whose names are called, come to me."

Liu Xin's voice came from the platform. This time, Lu Yang didn't snap back to reality for a long time, his mind seemingly still stuck on the angry sword strike from his previous life.

"An ant trying to shake a great tree, that's not wrong..."

Lu Yang let out a deep breath. Despite witnessing the gap between himself and a Foundation Establishment True Person, he didn't feel disheartened. Instead, his fighting spirit grew even stronger.

With the [Hundred Lifetimes Book] in hand, whatever couldn't defeat him would only make him stronger.

It was nothing more than starting over.

Thinking of this, Lu Yang looked at the [Hundred Lifetimes Book] interface again. In his previous life, he had focused solely on cultivation, possessing nothing but his Qi Refinement sixth layer cultivation.

However, he couldn't choose cultivation.

After all, as long as the hidden danger of the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* remained, he couldn't cultivate this technique; otherwise, it would be like carrying a ticking time bomb with him.

"I choose talent."

[Calculating your previous life's experience...]

[After your death, the act of drawing your sword to strike a Foundation Establishment cultivator was spread. Countless people mocked you for overestimating yourself, yet they didn't know that you weren't entirely without accomplishment.]

[Although you still didn't harm the Foundation Establishment True Person in the slightest, at the moment you were about to be crushed, you miraculously broke through a bottleneck in your swordsmanship, forcing the Butian Peak Master to exert a little more strength to crush you. Afterwards, he sighed, remarking that though you were but an ant, you did have a few tricks up your sleeve.]

[You have awakened the purple talent · A Few Tricks Up Your Sleeve.]

[A Few Tricks Up Your Sleeve: No matter how terrifying the attack, as long as it is within the limits of your ability, you can deftly handle it twice.]

"What kind of talent is this?"

Lu Yang frowned. At first glance, this seemed like a god-tier absolute defense skill, but the "within the limits of your ability" in the talent description seemed to discount it a bit.

However, he quickly stopped dwelling on it. After all, choosing a talent was just to avoid the hidden danger of cultivating the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art* in his previous life. If the talent was strong, that was naturally best; if it was weak, it didn't matter. More than this, Lu Yang was more concerned about whether there was a way to avoid the Butian Peak Master's deductions.

"If worst comes to worst, I'll just have to give up the *Nine Transformations Dragon Art*..."

"Lu Yang."

"...Here!"

Liu Xin's voice from the platform brought Lu Yang back to his senses. He quickly walked onto the high platform, and Liu Xin, just like in previous lives, assigned him to the Joyful Union Hall.

The next second, Lu Yang suddenly froze.

"Wait... I remember, my Myriad Souls Banner seemed to have a formidable character refined into it by Liu Xin, very possibly a true disciple of the Saint Sect."

This isn't right.

He himself was only found out and tracked down by the Butian Peak Master due to cultivating a single technique, yet Liu Xin had killed a true disciple! How could he still be alive?

Thinking of this, a sharp gleam suddenly burst forth from Lu Yang's eyes, staring intently at Liu Xin on the platform.

"That's it, the only explanation is that he possesses a rare treasure that can obscure karma, preventing even a Foundation Establishment True Person from deducing any information about him!"

In an instant, Lu Yang's mind became completely active.

Immediately after, he changed his strategy, reverting to his actions in the first life: directly killing Yu Suzhen in public, successfully drawing Liu Xin's attention.

He obtained half a volume of the Innate Dao Scripture from Liu Xin.

He went into secluded cultivation.

Then, just as he expected, on a dark and windy night, Liu Xin, who had made thorough preparations, hummed a little tune as he arrived at the entrance of Lu Yang's cave dwelling.

"Junior Brother Lu, are you there?"

Lu Yang didn't speak.

Seeing this, Liu Xin showed no surprise. Instead, he revealed a cold smile, then patiently opened his storage bag and took out formation flags, arranging them around.

These were soundproofing and illusion-creating formations, ensuring that no matter what happened inside, nothing would be detected outside. Liu Xin had done similar things many times. No one had ever suspected him, and even if someone used karma deduction...

Thinking of this, Liu Xin patted his pocket, smiling confidently.

Even if someone used karma deduction, it would be useless!

Soon, once the formations were set up, Liu Xin no longer hid his presence. He directly unleashed his True Qi, cleaved open Lu Yang's cave dwelling with a sword, and then strode in.

"Junior Brother Lu, stop hiding. I, your Senior Brother, need a talent like you...!?"

Liu Xin's voice abruptly cut off.

Inside the cave dwelling, Lu Yang was sitting on a meditation mat, looking at him with a half-smile, completely unlike someone who had cultivated half a volume of an Innate Dao Scripture!

"...This isn't right!"

In an instant, Liu Xin's pupils constricted, and a banner had already appeared in his hand.

However, it was too late.

The next second, as a red light flashed, Liu Xin felt more than half of his True Qi and flesh instantly drained away. He stumbled, falling to the ground!

Blood Washing Heavenly River Sword Formation Diagram!

Lu Yang had already set up the formation diagram at the entrance of the cave dwelling, so Liu Xin's forced entry was no different from walking into a trap, allowing Lu Yang to easily subdue him.

"Senior Brother, I've been waiting for you for a long time."

Looking at the fallen Liu Xin, and recalling how he himself had been tricked to death by Liu Xin in his first life, Lu Yang immediately scoffed, "Finally, you've fallen into my hands!"

"If our roles were reversed, I'd show you what true cruelty is!"

"Who exactly are you!?"

Liu Xin lay paralyzed on the ground, unable to muster any strength, completely bewildered by the situation. Had he been tricked? By a newly inducted disciple?

Impossible! Absolutely impossible!

"Are you a spy from a righteous sect? Wait, don't kill me, I can be useful to you... I have a supreme Dao Scripture that can help you achieve Foundation Establishment!"

In a moment of crisis, Liu Xin disregarded everything and blurted out his biggest secret.

"Besides that, I also have a magic treasure. Inside it is hidden a true disciple of the Saint Sect. He knows many secrets of the Saint Sect... no, the Heretical Saint Demonic Sect."

"As long as you let me go, all of these will be yours..."

Before Liu Xin could finish speaking, Lu Yang directly activated his Blood Transformation Divine Light, completely sucking him into a human skin: "Foolish, even if I kill you, they'll still be mine!"

"Even you will be mine!"

Immediately after, Lu Yang reached out and grabbed the Innate One Qi Myriad Souls Banner. Then, he shook the banner and swept it towards Liu Xin's corpse.

In his previous, previous life, he had read the Innate Dao Scripture, so he naturally knew how to activate this treasure.

Liu Xin's corpse fell into the banner, immediately steaming and qi-transforming. It was processed within the banner for a long time before Lu Yang shook the banner face, and it re-manifested.

However, the re-manifested Liu Xin had already become a Banner Spirit on the Myriad Souls Banner. Lu Yang had specifically preserved his memories, so when Liu Xin revived, he looked at Lu Yang in disbelief: "Junior Brother Lu... Impossible! How could you know how to activate the Myriad Souls Banner?"

"What did you call me?"

Lu Yang scoffed, "Do I need to teach you what attitude a Banner Spirit should have towards its Banner Master? Or do you wish for your soul to scatter and perish?"

"Milord, spare my life! Liu Xin greets Milord!"

Liu Xin instantly went weak in the knees and knelt down. Despite retaining all his memories from life, he couldn't harbor the slightest hatred towards Lu Yang, who had personally killed him.

Every thought contained only absolute loyalty.

This was the domineering nature of the Myriad Souls Banner. At first glance, a Banner Spirit seemed no different from a living person, but in reality, their will had long been seized, making it impossible for them to truly act independently.
