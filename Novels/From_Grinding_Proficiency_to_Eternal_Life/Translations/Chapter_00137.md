# Chapter 137: The Traitor Was Myself

Immediately, a black line as thick as an arm fell from the ceiling of the Tiangong Cave. Mo Han grabbed the end of the falling line and inserted it into the wall mechanism.

A mirror suddenly popped up in the center of the hall. The moment ripples appeared on its surface, the clicking sound of gears meshing suddenly became sharp and piercing.

Mo Han’s bronze prosthesis shot out three copper needles, inserting them into the cracks of the mirror frame. The cloudy mirror surface suddenly became clear.

In the reflection, the streets of Tiangong City seen through the eyes of the mechanical giant bird were bustling. Tea house banners waved, sparks flew from blacksmith shops, and even the women washing clothes by the moat were clearly visible.

Mo Han suddenly turned the joints of his prosthesis, and the speed of the mechanical giant bird increased again.

While adjusting it, Mo Han said, "This eagle eye can inspect a radius of fifty li. As long as we climb over Guniu Mountain, Cuibo City will be fully visible."

When the mechanical giant bird掠过 the boundary tablet of Cuibo City, the originally peaceful scene on the mirror surface suddenly changed. The winding official road had become a slaughterhouse.

The rotting corpses of the defenders were arranged in the shape of the Mingzhu totem, and blood lotus patterns bloomed on the chests of each body.

Black-robed envoys of the Xianghuo Sect swarmed like ants, dragging dying civilians towards a sacrificial altar emitting black smoke. The blood seeped into the ground cracks, actually outlining a blood lotus formation diagram that covered the entire field!

"Despicable scoundrels!"

Wan Chen of the Tiangong Department was furious, his fingers gripping the handle of the giant axe in his hand until it creaked.

The others also fell into a heavy silence.

Mo Han finally reacted, as if remembering something, and squeezed out a few words from between his clenched teeth.

"Blood sacrifice, entering dreams to possess bodies. Our perception has been blinded. No wonder we haven't been concerned about the defense of Tiangong City!"

He looked up at the others and asked, "Have any of you had any strange dreams these past few days?"

Hall Master Chu Xu of the Rongjin Hall hesitated slightly and said, "Yesterday, while I was asleep, a man in ancient robes suddenly came to talk to me. He said he was an old friend I had known for years, and then he asked me about various matters in the Tiangong Cave."

Hearing this, the others looked at each other in dismay.

Wan Chen was stunned. "Me too. That man was dressed very plainly. He asked me about various mechanisms in Tiangong City and the earth veins connected beneath the city."

Mo Han asked somewhat dazedly, "Did you answer?"

"In a dream, how could I control it? I... I naturally responded."

Wan Chen countered, "Didn't you answer?"

Mo Han: "...My sleep is rather light. I said some unimportant things, but I can guarantee that I didn't reveal the core secrets of Tiangong City."

Three pairs of eyes immediately turned to Zhan Yan.

Zhan Yan's face turned red upon seeing this, and he turned his head away without saying a word.

Yesterday, he had gotten completely drunk and almost spilled all his secrets. In the dream, the man in ancient robes was about to leave, but Zhan Yan grabbed him tightly and wouldn't let him go, even confessing that he had secretly watched the girl next door taking a bath when he was eight years old.

*The traitor was myself.*

Xu Yunfan saw everyone looking at him and said calmly, "I didn't sleep yesterday. I was practicing the basic knowledge of Tiangong forging techniques in the library."

"..."

Mo Han said, "To be able to enter the dreams of a Blood Transformation realm expert to hypnotize and blind them, let alone the other disciples of the Tiangong Cave. Given the current conditions of the world, that blood sacrifice..."

The others felt a chill run down their spines. The number of dead would be terrifyingly high.

They compared the appearance and clothing of the man in the ancient robes in their dreams again, confirming there were no discrepancies and that they were all the same.

For a time, they couldn't help but hold their foreheads, remaining silent for a long while.

Zhan Yan broke the silence, saying, "Regardless of the Sect Leader's current situation, the priority is to cleanse the Xianghuo Sect members who have infiltrated us."

"Agreed."

Mo Han took a step forward, moving to the center of the group. Holding the Sect Leader's proxy order, although he appeared short and stout in everyone's eyes, he exuded an indescribable dignity at this moment.

"The Sect Leader is currently uncontactable, and we cannot abandon everything to search for him. I will temporarily oversee all affairs of the Tiangong Cave. We must immediately clean up the Xianghuo Sect members who have infiltrated the Tiangong Cave. For those disciples who have been too deeply ensnared by the dreams and cannot extricate themselves... execute them on the spot. I will bear all the consequences!"

His voice was hoarse, and his heart bled. Three bronze command arrows slid out from his mechanical robe sleeve, one of which he tossed to Wan Chen.

"Tiangong Department, heed the order! Immediately seal the twelve Great Work Gates and activate the Xuanwu Mechanism to close the city!"

Wan Chen slammed his giant axe into the ground, cracking the floor tiles, caught the command arrow, accepted the order, turned around, and strode away.

Mo Han's mechanical limb extended and inserted into a socket that rose before him.

The entire Tiangong City suddenly trembled.

Xu Yunfan swayed slightly, his ears filled with the roar of gears meshing.

Through the hall window, he saw the moat water begin to boil. Roaring steam shot straight into the sky, bringing up tens of thousands of wolf-tooth spikes.

Cold iron ballistas flipped out from the crenellations of the city walls, the sound of mechanisms being cocked like a plague of locusts passing by.

Zhan Yan's ears twitched slightly as he looked outside the hall.

"The martial arts of the Hidden Blade Pavilion?"

The response was a sudden clash of metal outside the hall.

Wan Chen took the lead. The great sword in his hand flew out, shattering the two carved wooden doors of the hall. Outside, three swordsmen of the Hidden Blade Pavilion were stabbing their poisoned short swords into the backs of their fellow sect members, the tips already tearing through the chainmail of the Rongjin Hall disciples.

"Such audacity!"

Wan Chen's face was filled with fury, his voice like a thunderclap.

"Take them alive!"

Zhan Yan's flower-drum mallet struck from behind, the wolf-tooth spikes on the head of the mallet catching the blades.

The muscles on his arms swelled, and he actually swung the three traitors, swords and all, toward the hall pillars.

Mo Han saw this and,不知 where he touched a mechanism.

The lightning-proof patterns on the surface of the copper pillars suddenly came to life, shooting out thirty-six steel hoops that locked the men tight.

Xu Yunfan no longer hesitated and said, "Master, I will go find Senior Brother Fu!"

Time was of the essence. Even the Tiangong Hall now had Tiangong Cave disciples who had been bewitched appearing. If the entire Tiangong City wasn't suppressed in time, it would flow with rivers of blood.

Zhan Yan nodded and suddenly tossed out a token.

"This token represents my personal presence. Go and cooperate with Senior Brother Fu. If you discover that Senior Brother Fu is acting strangely..."

Zhan Yan's throat rolled with difficulty as he squeezed out a single word.

"Kill!"

Xu Yunfan nodded, took the token, turned around, and, holding the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, shot out like an arrow leaving the string. Just as he was about to disappear from the front of the Tiangong Hall, accompanied by the sound of wind and thunder, Mo Han's aged voice rang out.

"Take the Tiangong Corridor Bridge!"

Mo Han's prosthesis shot out a grappling hook, pulling a lock at his feet.

"I have restarted the Azure Dragon Winch. In half an hour, the city's mechanisms will reverse! The mechanisms of the Tiangong Cave will be fully activated!"

Xu Yunfan responded without looking back. As Zhan Yan was about to leave, Mo Han called out to stop him.

"Sect Leader Hong is the strongest expert in our Tiangong Cave. You must find him. Only if he leaves can our Tiangong Cave be stable! Otherwise, everything I do will be in vain!

It doesn't matter how many Tiangong Cave disciples die... If he dies, if a Marrow Washing Grandmaster were to come, our Tiangong Cave would be on the verge of collapse. We would have no choice but to use our final trump card."

Zhan Yan stopped and nodded slightly, naturally understanding the gravity of the situation.

The Tiangong Corridor Bridge wound like a giant dragon in the night.

Xu Yunfan raced across the bridge surface, stepping on the mechanism patterns. The Tiangong Bridge was constantly coupling and changing direction amidst the roaring of the gears in Tiangong City.

(There is still one more chapter. I don't know if I can get it out before twelve o'clock. I'm frantically typing. Thank you for your support. Seeing the plot up to this point, everyone should probably understand as well.)
