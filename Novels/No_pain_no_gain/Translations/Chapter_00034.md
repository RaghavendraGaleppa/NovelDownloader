# Chapter 34: Frigid Nether Needle

“That goes without saying. How many more decades do cultivators like us, in the Qi Condensation realm, have left?” Han Zhen nodded, firming his resolve to participate in the Immortal Cultivation Grand Assembly.

The Immortal Ascension Token was Han Zhen’s ultimate safeguard, but he couldn't rule out the possibility of being taken advantage of by stronger cultivators who might "trade" away his Foundation Establishment Pill. After all, competition for Foundation Establishment Pills was fierce; they were always snatched up as soon as they appeared. Bringing an Immortal Ascension Token would mean taking someone else’s spot.

As a rogue cultivator, being bullied within sects was common. What could he do when he had no elders to back him? Han Zhen wasn't even sure about his spiritual root aptitude. If he had a Heavenly Spiritual Root or Variant Spiritual Root, he wouldn’t have to go through such trouble. The Yellow Maple Valley's rules explicitly stated that those with Heavenly or Variant Spiritual Roots would be prioritized for Foundation Establishment. While Qi Condensation cultivators could test if someone possessed a spiritual root by channeling spiritual energy into a mortal body, the specific aptitude of a spiritual root could only be determined by a Foundation Establishment realm cultivator.

“If it were a year ago, I might have advised Brother Han to wait another decade. After all, Brother Han is so young, there’s no need to rush,” Han Yunfeng said, his eyes filled with envy. “But now it seems this old brother misjudged you back then. With your talent, reaching the eleventh layer of Qi Condensation before the Immortal Ascension Assembly is a sure thing. Perhaps you won't even need to compete in the arena and will be directly accepted by a cultivation sect.”

“Then I’ll take Brother Han’s auspicious words to heart. However, it's still best to be fully prepared. The slots for Foundation Establishment Pills are already fiercely contested, and even if I’m lucky enough to be accepted into a sect, I might not necessarily get one,” Han Zhen voiced his concerns. He knew that Qi Condensation cultivators under forty who had reached the eleventh layer were considered to have only ordinary aptitude within cultivation sects, barely meeting the admission requirements. True geniuses could cultivate to the ninth layer of Qi Condensation at eleven or twelve without any elixirs, and some even achieved Foundation Establishment at sixteen. A year from now, his nearly twenty-year-old self at the eleventh layer of Qi Condensation might not impress the major figures of the Seven Great Sects.

“Since Brother Han has considered it so thoroughly, then you must prepare early. After all, in battles between cultivators, the depth of one's magic power isn't the most important thing. Potent magic tools and talismans are the key,” Han Yunfeng said, realizing Han Zhen’s mind was made up. He took a sip of spiritual tea, offering a reminder. He still believed Han Zhen had truly cultivated alone and, having only recently entered the cultivation world, must lack experience in fighting others. Han Yunfeng worried Han Zhen might suffer losses in this regard, which prompted his reminder.

“This past year, I’ve been busy cultivating and drawing spirit talismans, neglecting this matter. However, it shouldn't be too late to choose suitable magic tools at the Taonan Minor Fair’s trade gathering.”

Han Zhen had indeed noticed the magic tools displayed by rogue cultivators and various merchant guilds. Most were low-grade; he rarely saw any mid-grade ones he liked, and as for high-grade and top-tier ones, he hadn't seen any at all. Thinking he would wait until Taonan Valley became livelier before searching for suitable magic tools, Han Zhen voiced his thoughts.

“On this point, Brother Han, you are mistaken. The magic tools at trade fairs are mostly junk, and if you wait until just before the Immortal Ascension Assembly to buy, it’ll be too late!” Although the Han family had declined, their ancestors had passed down some knowledge. Han Yunfeng naturally understood the immense advantage good magic tools offered in battle. Furthermore, flexible application of magic tools was necessary to unleash their true power, and mastering this required time for practice and familiarization.

“However, the price of top-tier magic tools is naturally beyond what a rogue cultivator can afford, which is why some exquisite magic tools are not openly displayed.” After Han Yunfeng finished speaking, he saw Han Zhen fall into thought, seemingly seriously considering purchasing a top-tier magic tool, which surprised him. He seemed to have underestimated Brother Han’s financial strength.

However, Han Yunfeng was also astute enough not to pry. He smoothly changed the topic, finally giving Han Yunzhi a chance to interject a few words. The three conversed happily until nightfall, when Han Yunfeng and his sister finally bid farewell to Han Zhen.

“Fellow Daoist Han truly keeps his abilities hidden!” Han Yunfeng couldn’t help but sigh softly as they walked out of the pavilion. Han Zhen had greatly surprised Han Yunfeng today, both with his talent and his financial resources. However, he made up his mind that since Brother Han trusted him as a friend so much, these matters should be kept deep in his heart.

Months later, inside the Myriad Treasures Pavilion.

“The agreed date isn't even here yet, and Fellow Daoist Han has already called. It seems your friend’s talisman-drawing skill has advanced again,” Shopkeeper Tian couldn't help but tease as Han Zhen arrived at the guest room on the second floor. Shopkeeper Tian clearly believed Han Zhen’s "friend" was himself, even though Han Zhen never admitted it.

As for why Han Zhen used his real name for transactions, in this small patch of land known as Taonan Valley, it was easy for a powerful establishment like the Myriad Treasures Pavilion to obtain his real information. Moreover, a monthly profit from less than a hundred low-grade spirit talismans was meager and wouldn’t attract the envious gazes that thousand-year-old spirit herbs, which cost thousands of spirit stones, might. It was better to conduct transactions openly and show sincerity.

“I want to look at some magic tools and talismans. There’s no need for the ones downstairs. I hope Shopkeeper Tian can bring out some good items,” Han Zhen stated his purpose directly and clearly. Originally, Han Zhen had planned to purchase items from markets in other parts of Yue Country, but he had no flying magic tool, and traveling back and forth would waste a lot of time.

Furthermore, his cooperation with the Myriad Treasures Pavilion in Taonan Valley had been problem-free so far.

Shopkeeper Tian was slightly taken aback, his smile growing even more genuine. Knowing Han Zhen’s character, he didn’t bother with pleasantries and directly instructed a young attendant to bring up the recently acquired collection of treasures.

“Heh heh, it just so happens that the Taonan Minor Fair is approaching, and our pavilion has just received a batch of exquisite magic tools. Perfect for Fellow Daoist Han to appraise.”

About half a cup of tea’s time later, six brocade boxes were laid before Han Zhen and opened for him to examine closely. However, as the boxes opened, two surges of magic power, far exceeding the Qi Condensation realm, firmly locked onto Han Zhen. Han Zhen remained calm, knowing this was the Myriad Treasures Pavilion’s security measure, to prevent “guests” from suddenly erupting with power and snatching the contents of the boxes.

At this point, Shopkeeper Tian began to introduce the first item.

“The Azure Firmament Sword, crafted from fine iron, refined gold, and a small amount of azure gold. It’s a high-grade magic tool forged by a Foundation Establishment realm artifact refiner and a rare wind-attributed treasure that can harm people invisibly.” Han Zhen reached out, picked up the inch-long small sword, examined it carefully for a while, then placed it back in its box. Since he was buying, he intended to go for the best, prioritizing top-tier magic tools.

“The Frigid Nether Needle, a very rare hidden weapon type top-tier magic tool. It’s forged from profound iron collected from frigid yin lands using special subterranean flames. When activated, it’s almost imperceptible and can harm one’s spiritual consciousness,” Shopkeeper Tian said, pointing to the smallest brocade box.

The Frigid Nether Needle was entirely dark, not only capable of deceiving vision but also difficult to detect even with divine sense.

“May I activate it to try it out?”

“Of course, Fellow Daoist Han is certainly trustworthy in my eyes.” Shopkeeper Tian was very confident in his own strength and the Myriad Treasures Pavilion’s defenses.

Han Zhen immediately picked up the thumb-sized Frigid Nether Needle and slowly injected spiritual energy into the object in his hand.
