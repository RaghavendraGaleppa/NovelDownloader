Chapter 68: Very Well, Then!

Xu Yunfan’s gaze involuntarily drifted downward. The moonlight outlined the woman’s exceptionally perfect waist-to-hip curve, causing his brows to involuntarily raise. It was round, smooth, and flawless, with an excellent shape.

Before he could look a few more times, the woman slowly turned around, her cold eyes glancing at him indifferently.

"Xu Yunfan?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow. "Celestial Pivot Gate?"

He felt a sense of foreboding. First, Li Miaoyun had come, and now another one had arrived. With no longer anyone like Li Haomiao to stand in front of him, he naturally understood why the other party was stopping him.

Wan Miaoyin was at least an expert comparable to the Refining Flesh Realm.

Just now, among the five people in the Thousand Buddha Temple, any one of them would be more than he could handle, let alone now.

In modern times, killing someone requires collecting evidence and handing them over to the law for judgment.

In ancient times, if someone says you must die, you must die.

"You know me?"

Wan Miaoyin was somewhat surprised. She hadn't expected to be recognized as a Celestial Pivot Gate disciple the moment she appeared.

"You all wear very similar styles, it's easy to recognize. It's just that you're dressed a bit thicker," Xu Yunfan said, his eyes quickly glancing a few times at the two 'bombs' hanging on Wan Miaoyin's chest.

His expression darkened slightly. "It seems you're even more ferocious than Li Miaoyin."

Wan Miaoyin said, "In terms of strength, I am indeed stronger than Li Miaoyin."

Xu Yunfan nodded deeply in agreement.

Wan Miaoyin’s eyes shifted as she sized up Xu Yunfan, who already held the瓮金锤 (Weng Jin Hammer) in his hand.

"If it weren't for the fact that I absorbed the vital energy she spent her life cultivating and need to sever distractions, I really wouldn't kill you."

"Is there really no room for a peaceful resolution?"

"You made me search for a long time. Today, you must die."

"Very well, let us fight to the death."

Wan Miaoyin’s arms spread out slightly, her wide, light gauze sleeves swaying in the wind.

"Let me see exactly what methods you have that allowed you to kill my Senior Sister."

Xu Yunfan let out a furious shout, spun the Weng Jin Hammer in his hand, twisted his body and hips, rotating to build up power. He swung the heavy hammer in a wide arc, and with a sudden burst of force from his tiger's mouth, the Weng Jin Hammer tore through the air like a muffled thunderclap, thrown in the opposite direction of Wan Miaoyin.

The Weng Jin Hammer snapped the ancient pine tree three zhang away in half at the waist.

Wan Miaoyin’s gaze sharpened.

She had missed?

In the next instant, amidst the flying wood chips, Xu Yunfan had already shot into the dense forest like an arrow leaving a bow, vanishing in a flash onto the official road and disappearing into the mountains.

"..."

Before Wan Miaoyin could make a move, Xu Yunfan suddenly burst out from the jungle again, charging rapidly toward her, head lowered and silent, quickly closing the distance.

Wan Miaoyin said coldly, "What kind of trick is this? I thought you..."

She saw that in the jungle from which Xu Yunfan had burst out, large trees suddenly snapped and broke. Under the moonlight, the deformed body of the old monk, the Candle Dragon, was squirming among the tree shadows, walking out from the forest.

The spiral-shaped spine emitted crisp sounds like wet wood breaking. The three-toed flesh columns left pools of foul blood on the ground wherever they stepped. The muscles writhing between his chest and abdomen bulged frantically, pushing the monk's robe out into a terrifying silhouette.

The old monk looked at Xu Yunfan, who had run away without hesitation, and wanted to continue the chase, but his gaze suddenly fixed. His bulging eyes locked onto Wan Miaoyin.

"What a cauldron! What a skin! So much better than that young man. Unblemished and pure, a thread of qi nurtured within the body, washing away the impurities, yet only at the Refining Flesh Realm. Truly a gift from the heavens, the Ancestors bless me!!"

The tumor on the old monk's left shoulder suddenly exploded, spewing a foul-smelling arrow of blood.

Wan Miaoyin frowned deeply and spun to dodge. The blood arrow hit the ground, actually corroding a pit a zhang deep.

She watched helplessly as Xu Yunfan casually picked up the heavy hammer and vanished into the jungle again.

With a look of disgust at the old monk, Wan Miaoyin was about to chase after him when she saw the old monk's deformed short claw on his right arm had already broken through her surrounding protective qi wall and grabbed her left shoulder.

How was this possible?

The vital energy was ineffective?!

Wan Miaoyin was greatly shocked inside, but the pain spreading from her body the next second interrupted her thoughts.

Amidst the sizzling sound of flesh melting, a rare look of pain appeared on Wan Miaoyin's cold, beautiful face. The gaps between the short claw's fingers were actually filled with fine, dense bone teeth, clinging tightly to her shoulder.

Wan Miaoyin's right leg whipped out like a whip, the sonic boom shaking dead leaves off the trees.

The knotted muscles writhing like snakes in the old monk's chest and abdomen suddenly swelled, bulging out a large chunk to block this spinning kick that could shatter metal and stone.

The shockwave from the collision flipped the boulder beneath Wan Miaoyin, but her tibia was already unnaturally bent.

The old monk roared with laughter and slammed Wan Miaoyin toward the mountain wall. However, she twisted her waist in mid-air to change direction, a cold gleam from her sleeve aiming for the monster's eyelid.

But the Luanchan Whip wrapped around the old monk's left arm suddenly shot through the air, shattering the cold gleam.

The tumor on the old monk's left shoulder had already regenerated at some point. He held the divine weapon and let out an inhuman roar: "Buddha's bones as the whip, true blood as the guide. Today is the day this old monk shall achieve..."

The words cut off abruptly.

Wan Miaoyin's blood-stained five fingers had pierced through the flesh hole in the back of the old monk's neck, her fingertips hooked around a section of his spiral, deformed spine.

She gasped as she pulled out half of the golden bone, and with a shake of her hand, it turned into powder.

The deformed monster's body collapsed on one side, yet he roared without a hint of pain, instead filled with immense joy. He swung the Luanchan Whip held in his flesh, tearing through the air and creating gusts of entwined qi, smashing toward Wan Miaoyin's waist.

Wan Miaoyin endured the intense pain, her remaining good foot moving suddenly as she retreated. The shoulder the old monk was gripping tightly was instantly torn, leaving a large patch of flesh and blood behind.

Her face was pale, her eyes cold. She formed a hand seal, and visible qi flowed between her fingers. A murky white pearl floated out from her waist-binding belt.

It seemed light and floating, but it carried the weight of a mountain, colliding heavily with the Luanchan Whip.

Clang!

A sound of metal clashing instantly rang through the sky. A huge commotion, accompanied by a visible shockwave of air, shot out in all directions.

The entire official road was plowed up from the ground.

The old monk's face was ferocious, twisting and roaring in disbelief.

"The Celestial Pivot Gate's divine weapon, the Mountain Stabilizing Pearl?"

The arm holding the Luanchan Whip instantly shattered inch by inch, exploding completely. The Luanchan Whip flew backward with a bang, sticking into the ground and emitting a low hum.

The Mountain Stabilizing Pearl had been knocked flying, vanishing into the mountain forest, its whereabouts unknown.

The old monk turned into a puddle of rotten mud, collapsing on the ground, unable to move at all.

Wan Miaoyin was also completely drained of vital energy, barely propping herself up.

This scene had exceeded her expectations. She had only come to deal with a minor character, but she didn't know where a monster comparable to the Blood Transformation Realm had come from.

Being able to achieve a mutual defeat was already the best possible outcome for the moment.

Looking at Wan Miaoyin's state, the old monk, now a puddle of mud, laughed wildly, constantly writhing his muscles and crawling toward Wan Miaoyin on the ground.

"Haha, hahaha... Good, just right, perfectly right. It is my fate, my opportunity has arrived."

Wan Miaoyin's expression showed a hint of mockery as she said indifferently, "The spiritual energy of heaven and earth has not yet arrived, the secret powers of the world are not manifest, and all strange forces in the world belong to the category of divine weapons. To want to borrow a body to be reborn will only make you more and more monstrous, eventually turning into a demon devoid of reason... You haven't even reached the Supreme Grandmaster Realm of Qi Cultivation, the ninth realm of martial arts, and yet you attempt such a deed. It is truly laughable."

"Shut up!"

The old monk roared coldly, his face, like a puddle of rotten mud, nearly insane.

"Brat, how dare you spout nonsense about the great secrets of heaven and earth! How could you possibly know the full picture!"
