# Chapter 78: Indestructible Diamond Body

"How do you feel?" This time, Zhou Qing's session of stimulating his female disciple's qi and blood circulation didn't last as long as before. He withdrew his hands quickly.

"It doesn't feel as hot as last time," Yuan Mingyue carefully recalled the sensation.

Zhou Qing smiled: "Hot and cold are just sensations. Different people perceive them differently. The reason you feel less heat is because your qi and blood have improved compared to before."

Unable to contain her curiosity, Yuan Mingyue asked, "Master, what does hot and cold feel like to you?"

"Me?" Zhou Qing was momentarily taken aback before laughing, "Perhaps like moonlight's chill and sunlight's warmth, slowly burning away one's lifespan."

Yuan Mingyue silently pondered these words, feeling an indescribable shock in her heart.

"Alright, now come down the mountain with me."

Yuan Mingyue: "What are we doing down there?"

Zhou Qing chuckled lightly, "Just taking a casual stroll."

The one-month period had ended. That Yuan Mingyue could still accompany her master down the mountain meant their master-disciple bond wasn't over yet—she still had the opportunity to continue cultivating under Zhou Qing.

This was naturally something to be happy about.

Descending to Panshi City, they found it bustling with activity.

Under the protection of the Taihe Sect, Panshi City enjoyed rare peace in these troubled times. In chaotic eras, peace was more precious than gold, hence the city's liveliness. Its population had multiplied several times over, gradually becoming overwhelming.

The city's people busied themselves with the toil of daily life.

"The worldly atmosphere—spicy, vibrant—this is what we call the flavor of humanity. It's different from the heavenly path cultivators pursue, which is solitary and vast."

"I understand. Master wants me to witness the busyness of the secular world, how difficult it is to escape from life's burdens, so I can appreciate the preciousness of cultivation."

"Actually, being able to cultivate is like being able to study—both require an environment free from the worries of livelihood. Otherwise, being constantly busy leaves no time for cultivation or study. Moreover, only through contrast with the secular world does the heavenly path appear lofty and noble."

Yuan Mingyue looked puzzled, "But the Daoist scriptures say, 'The highest good is like water, benefiting all without contention. It stays in places that people disdain, thus close to the Dao.' According to this, isn't the lowly secular world closer to the Dao? More noble than the heavenly path?"

"Bearing the country's disgrace makes one its sovereign; bearing the country's misfortunes makes one king of the world. Only by occupying the lowest position can one become truly noble. Like the dragon—it can be large or small, rise or hide—but ultimately soars through the nine heavens. The same goes for water on earth—it eventually returns to the heavens as rain."

As they spoke, Zhou Qing spotted a pickpocket using a blade to slit someone's clothes.

Yuan Mingyue, sensitive to her master's gaze, noticed it too.

"Let's go take a look."

Yuan Mingyue was curious—as a Xiantian master, would her master really bother with such petty theft?

Zhou Qing subdued the thief and took him to the authorities, revealing his identity to file a report.

Using Yuan Mingyue's status, the matter was quickly resolved.

On their way back up the mountain, Yuan Mingyue said:

"I thought Master would personally deal with the thief's entire gang. I didn't expect you to involve the authorities. I also didn't think you'd bother with such minor matters."

"Seeing injustice on the road, drawing one's sword to help—this is the spirit a martial artist should have. But cultivators shouldn't be overly entangled in worldly affairs. Secular matters are best left to secular people to handle."

Soon they reached the mountainside. The large pine tree swayed gently in the breeze, quite content—until Zhou Qing's approach made it tremble slightly, exuding fear and apprehension...

Ignoring it, Zhou Qing said to Yuan Mingyue: "We agreed you'd train with me for one month. That time is up. If you wish to continue, it's up to you now."

"What must I do, Master?"

"Taihe Mountain is eighteen hundred li from Jiangzhou City. If you're sincere in your cultivation, come to Jiangzhou City alone. If you can do this, you may become my formal disciple."

"This disciple doesn't know if she can do it, but she will try."

"Good."

......

"What? You're having the princess travel alone from here to Jiangzhou? That's unacceptable." Zhang Jingxiu shook his head in refusal.

"She won't be able to complete the journey alone, so she'll need protection. I think Daoist Xiao would be suitable."

"You mean to have Ruowang secretly protect the princess?"

Zhou Qing smiled faintly: "What else? Is there anyone else at Taihe Mountain more suitable? Since you've already protected the prince, having your disciple protect the princess continues your legacy."

"It seems this is the only way. But aren't you being too harsh on the princess? Even with Ruowang's protection, she'll suffer greatly traveling alone. What if she falls ill?"

"What's so frightening about illness? Even if someone's just breathed their last before me, I could revive them long enough to say a few final words."

"I thought you meant you could truly bring the dead back to life." Zhang Jingxiu couldn't help laughing.

"If only I had that ability."

This made Zhang Jingxiu sigh. Though they'd reached Xiantian, it was merely the starting point of the Dao. While they stood at the secular world's peak, in terms of pursuing the Dao, they were still stumbling infants.

"The prince faces no immediate danger now. I passed my position to Ruowang intending to focus on cultivation. Don't waste your time just because you're young. Decades pass in the blink of an eye for cultivators."

......

The difference between masters often lay in such small details.

But without Zhou Qing's powerful spiritual sense, it would be impossible to manage such things during life-or-death battles at the Xiantian level.

Zhou Qing returned to meditation in his quiet room, practicing the Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture.

Now at a crucial point in mastering it, Zhou Qing continuously pushed against this barrier until, at one moment, it broke.

Faint azure light emanated from Zhou Qing's body as a semi-transparent tiger robe materialized, its patterns clearer than before, resembling an actual tiger-skin robe draped over him.

Opening his mouth, Zhou Qing exhaled a burst of tiger aura that split the door bolt two zhang away.

This was another marvelous application of the Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture—enhancing his aura to be expelled like arrows, though what he exhaled wasn't air but tiger aura.

The door opened to reveal Haori returning, battered and bruised, carrying a vividly red snake in its beak. Even near death, the snake gave Zhou Qing a faint sense of danger.

But Zhou Qing maintained his aura connection throughout, never employing Xiantian-level power or using his spiritual sense to track Xiao Ruowang's movements.

As exchanges continued, Xiao Ruowang felt like he was sinking into mud.

Despite exerting full strength, his power never found solid footing.

Suddenly, Zhou Qing pointed at Xiao Ruowang's chest—a seemingly slow movement that Xiao Ruowang couldn't evade. Yet his skills were exceptional—his chest indented an inch just as Zhou Qing's finger arrived.

This inch precisely matched the aura's eruption distance.

Just as Xiao Ruowang thought he'd dodged the Diamond Finger strike, pain blossomed in his chest.

Zhou Qing's Diamond Finger had injured him through an inch of empty space using aura.

"I concede."

"Brother Xiao must wonder—before Xiantian, aura can only extend an inch beyond the body. How did I injure you across that inch? But you should know some secret techniques can extend aura beyond this limit by stimulating qi and blood."

"Master Zhou speaks truly." Xiao Ruowang fell into deep thought.

Zhou Qing: "Cultivation is contending with heaven. If Brother Xiao aspires to Xiantian, first claim the top spot on the Black Ranking."

"The Black Ranking's first?" Xiao Ruowang murmured.

After a long pause, he bowed deeply to Zhou Qing before leaving.

Zhou Qing didn't heal Xiao Ruowang's injuries—recovering on his own would yield martial insights.

With Xiao Ruowang gone, Zhou Qing immersed himself in cultivation.

Another reason for not further instructing Yuan Mingyue was his current preoccupation. After the decapitation strike at the Shang Family Fort, Zhou Qing keenly felt that even post-Xiantian, the body remained flesh and blood—powerful bows and crossbows still threatened him.

Thus he pondered: how to further enhance his defenses?

Against ordinary blades, circulating qi and blood to form protective energy could suffice.

But against supremely sharp weapons wielded by aura masters, defense couldn't be ignored.

Take the red python—physically stronger than current Zhou Qing—yet still breached by three pre-Xiantian experts using heavy weapons.

The Diamond Monastery's Golden Bell Shield and Taihe Sect's Iron Shirt had unique aspects. Mastery granted immunity to ordinary weapons, but not against heavy or extremely sharp arms.

Recently, Zhou Qing had mastered the Golden Bell Shield.

With Xiantian foundations, learning it came naturally.

In the courtyard, Zhou Qing roared like a tiger, concentrating qi and blood until his skin and muscles turned incredibly tough yet flexible. Directing qi to his arm, he slowly pressed against a blade's edge until it snapped.

"With qi enhancement, the Tiger Roar Golden Bell Shield and Iron Shirt can indeed withstand powerful bows and heavy weapons. But my qi is too limited to cover my entire body. Otherwise, I'd achieve true indestructibility in the secular world."

Zhou Qing estimated only at Qi Refinement's tenth layer could qi fully envelop his body, realizing his envisioned Indestructible Diamond Body.

Then, even Xiantian masters couldn't breach his defenses without divine weapons or desperate techniques.

"My spiritual sense extends eleven zhang. At this range, I can react to Xiantian attacks, discern their movements, and instantly direct qi to impact points."

Thanks to his powerful spiritual sense, Zhou Qing could manipulate internal qi with a thought and perceive Xiantian-level assaults.

His spiritual sense's benefits didn't end there—he could now constantly monitor bodily changes, immediately detecting any issues without relying on the Life Nurturer's feedback.

This powerful sense also eased learning techniques like the Fierce Tiger Slaughter Scripture. Zhang Jingxiu, after half a month, still couldn't grasp its basics—a testament to spiritual sense disparities.

Zhang's Eighteen Falling Techniques shared some Indestructible Diamond traits, often repelling attackers.

But its absolute defense paled against Zhou Qing's self-realized Indestructible Diamond Body.

This culmination of Golden Bell Shield, Iron Shirt, and other external arts represented Zhou Qing's lifetime synthesis of Diamond Monastery, Taihe Sect, Qingfu Temple, Five Animal Frolics, and Five Viscera techniques.

Perfecting it required Qi Refinement's tenth layer plus Body Refinement's third layer, with spiritual sense reaching at least Qi Refinement's ninth layer.

Zhou Qing focused on the Life Nurturer:

Indestructible Diamond Body (Basic).

Still some distance from true mastery.

Currently, using his powerful spiritual sense to direct qi, he could locally achieve partial defensive characteristics of the perfected technique.

In life-or-death battles, protecting vitals this way was an extraordinary tactic.

For instance, against Zhang Jingxiu, Zhou Qing could use qi to shield vital points, withstand an attack, then counterattack.

The difference between masters often lay in such small details.

But without Zhou Qing's powerful spiritual sense, managing this during Xiantian battles would be impossible.
