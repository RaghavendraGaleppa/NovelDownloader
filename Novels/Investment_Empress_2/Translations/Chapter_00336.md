Chapter 336: The Peculiar Posing Prowess of the Heroes

Outside Greenwood City.

"Monster! A monster!"

A scout clad in vine armor was surrounded by a group of妖王 (Demon Kings) who had transformed into humans. He looked pitifully small, helpless, and terrified.

"Nonsense! Which of your eyes sees me as a demon?" grumbled a burly middle-aged man who was as tall as two people, with arms as thick as a man's waist and horns on his head that looked like fine iron.

"Ye~ah~," Manbo said, frowning as she stroked her chin, sparks of electricity crackling around her. "Where~ do~ we~ look~ like~ dem~ons?"

She didn't know how they had been exposed.

"Lao Guo, we finally caught a live one, don't scare him to death," Wu Qing said, giving a meaningful glance before looking at the tightly bound scout.

She cleared her throat and said, "We are merely human heroes who practice... ahem... peculiar posing martial arts. You don't need to be afraid."

*Rumble rumble—*

The dark clouds thickened, and a few flashes of lightning appeared, as if it were about to rain.

"....."

The scout shrank back, becoming even more terrified.

"Demon Kings, let's ask him what's going on first," said a golden-robed young man with a bald head.

The demons had come to help.

Under Shang Qinqing's contact, when Li Mo and Ying Bing returned to Greenwood City, they had helped intercept high-level calamity beasts.

Setting aside the fact that the Peerless Flood Dragon and the Divine Maiden of the Blue Luan held the hope of reviving the demon race...

No sane demon would want to see the Celestial Jade fall into the hands of the calamity beasts.

Once the Celestial Jade was controlled by the calamity beasts, the normal demons would only have two paths: join them or be destroyed.

This was why Li Mo and Ying Bing hadn't encountered any high-level calamity beasts on their way back.

Until later, when the Hidden Dragon List was released.

The demons all learned of their human identities.

But after discussing it, they decided they still had to help. At least the Peerless Flood Dragon had integrity; as a human who obtained the Celestial Jade, he was still willing to share it with them.

It was better than letting the calamity beasts take it.

So, many great demons and Demon Kings used transformation techniques to disguise themselves as ordinary passersby who practiced peculiar posing martial arts...

But just as they were about to secretly support Greenwood City, they arrived to find something was wrong.

The battle was already over?!

"Speak, what exactly happened?" Peng Lingyuan, the bald-headed eagle demon, asked sternly.

"We... we lost. The Han Godhead was killed, so the army collapsed like a mountain," the scout said, wanting to cry but having no tears.

He was just relieving himself in the grass while fleeing when he was inexplicably抓來 (captured) and brought here.

He would never dare to relieve himself in the wild again.

"Hmm? You dare lie to a demon at a time like this?" The great demon of the Leviathan clan widened his eyes, a sight that could stop a child from crying at night.

"I'll~ give~ him~ a~ little~ treatment," Manbo said, preparing to make the scout老实 (behave) with some electric therapy.

"I swear what I said is true! That Li Mo is simply inhuman!" the scout blurted out in terror, his eyes wide.

"Hmm..." The Demon Kings and great demons nodded.

That was true.

Under the threat of electrocution, the scout recounted the entire process in detail.

"He led a cavalry charge, withstood a hundred military formations, and charged all the way to the front of Han Godhead's palace. With that hammer of his that shattered several statues, he smashed the Godhead to nothing with a single blow."

"Oh, right, and that woman, she could command the military formation while also turning it into a field. The two clan elders we sent were both killed by her."

The mountaintop fell silent for a moment.

The Demon Kings and great demons' heads buzzed, filled with the word "preposterous."

But it didn't sound like a lie.

With this scout's imagination, he probably couldn't invent such an outrageous story.

Just as they were in silence...

A small bird made of jade-like material flew through the noon smoke of the city, over the scarred battlefield, and landed on a small hill a hundred miles from Greenwood City, transforming into human form.

"Clan Leader Shang, why are you back so late?"

"How is Greenwood City?"

Wu Qing saw that she had no signs of having fought, so she relaxed a bit, then asked, "Did you handle something on the way?"

Shang Qinqing suppressed the "auntie smile" on her face and said, "Don't worry, everyone. They're eating dumplings inside Greenwood City."

The expressions of the Demon Kings and great demons were complex.

---

They had rushed over, afraid of being too late, thinking that Greenwood City would fall in a couple of days.

They never expected the opposite.

"There's nothing for us to do here, so should we... head back?"

"What flavor are the dumplings?"

"With vinegar~ that's~ authentic~."

"Since we're already here..."

...

The atmosphere in the Greenwood Camp was still lively.

Especially when someone found a golden bean in their dumpling.

"Whoa, what is this? Gold?"

"Who puts golden beans in dumplings for a holiday?"

"Ah? I just ate something hard, and I swallowed it directly."

"It's fine, no big deal. Let's go to the latrine together tonight with lanterns to look for it."

"....."

The latrines in the Greenwood Camp would probably be very busy tonight.

Li Mo coughed, and in his mind, he pictured Lao Xue holding a lantern to look for the Xuan Dan. He almost spat out the dumpling filling soup that Bing Duo had carefully prepared.

"This is a reward from Young Hero Li for everyone. Come on, let's toast to Young Hero Li!" Wu Lang shouted, toasting Li Mo, and the soldiers all cheered.

It looked like they were about to drink until they were drunk.

Li Mo turned to look at Bing Duo and found that she had a rather kind smile on her face, with a small hand on his waist, gently pinching him.

*Don't you know how your injuries are doing?*

Just then, Qu Sheng returned. His gray hair had surprisingly turned back to a thick, black color. The heavy aura of twilight had vanished from him.

"I won't say thanks for such a great kindness," he said to Li Mo, then raised his cup. "On behalf of everyone, I'll toast Young Hero Li together."

Qu Sheng led the way, and the soldiers followed, drinking their cups of wine in one go. The atmosphere in the camp grew even more fervent as everyone relaxed their tense nerves, drinking and boasting.

Li Mo's chest felt a bit hot.

He looked down to see the Colorless Pagoda of Emptiness in his chest. The very bottom layer was emitting a faint white light.

This represented that it was absorbing the power of the people.

How much would it need to store before it was enough to spar with Sun Wukong?

Well, probably not enough.

After all, after the Colorless Pagoda of Emptiness purified it, only one-tenth of the power of the people would remain, and the amount needed to project the Great Dao Divine Form was definitely enormous.

The soldiers outside were too enthusiastic, a bit hard to handle.

Li Mo and Ying Bing went into the adjacent military tent.

He raised his powerless arm, rinsed his mouth, and swallowed the sour taste.

"The more I eat these dumplings, the hungrier I get..."

Half a bowl of vinegar was way too appetizing.

Hearing this, Ying Bing immediately got up to go out, seemingly preparing to draw from her previous experience and launch Bing Duo Brand Dumplings 2.0 to satisfy Little Li's craving.

But just as she lifted her foot, her small hand was caught by a not-so-powerful large hand. Heaven have mercy, Little Li could barely hold a skewer now, so catching her hand was really his limit.

"You're not full yet?"

"Don't just eat dumplings. Actually, I want some skewers."

"Hmm..."

Ying Bing sat back down, nodded, picked up a skewer, and brought it to Li Mo's mouth.

Li Mo opened his mouth and bit down, pulling his head to the side, but he couldn't pull it away. The meat seemed to be stuck to the skewer, causing the skewer-pulling to fail.

He blinked. "Bing Duo, try a little harder on the other side."

"But I don't have a hand," Ying Bing said, thinking about pushing his head, but her right hand was in Li Mo's palm, and her left hand was holding the skewer.

"You don't necessarily need another hand," Li Mo said, a bit stunned.

Ying Bing lowered her eyes and looked at her own toes.

In the military tent, there was no one else...

Suddenly.

Li Mo's left cheek felt cool. Something icy, fragrant, and soft pressed against his cheek.

With a gentle push, it allowed him to successfully pull the meat off the skewer.

His cheeks moved as Little Li chewed the mutton, but he felt a bit strange in his heart.

*She didn't have a hand free, did she?*

*Emmmmm*

Li Mo turned his head back.
