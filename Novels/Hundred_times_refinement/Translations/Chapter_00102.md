# Chapter 52: Crimson Vine Grass

Among the disciples who entered the valley at the same time, Lin Xuan's current strength could now rank within the top three. Reaching the late stage of the Lingdong Realm, he could already be considered an elite disciple even in a sect like the Piaoyun Valley. However, Lin Xuan was far from satisfied, as his secluded cultivation period had not yet concluded.

Firstly, he still had over a hundred Body Tempering Pills left, enough to support more than ten days of cultivation. Secondly, although he had successfully broken through, he had only just stepped into the fifth layer's threshold. His realm still needed consolidation, so he decided to continue his secluded cultivation.

Lin Xuan would never become complacent over minor achievements. On the contrary, each success only made his goals more ambitious, setting new demands for himself.

His mastery of the Cloud Soaring Art grew increasingly proficient, and he could feel his spiritual power steadily increasing every day.

Beyond his cultivation base, the volume of the starry sea within his body had also doubled. Previously, Lin Xuan had encountered a bottleneck when purifying mid-grade pills—no matter how much he practiced or how hard he tried, his success rate remained stuck at twenty percent. This wasn't an issue of skill but rather a fundamental bottleneck in his utilization of the blue starry sea.

Now, having reached the late stage of the Lingdong Realm and with the expansion of his starry sea, this bottleneck had vanished on its own. After testing, Lin Xuan found that his success rate for mid-grade pills had risen to over thirty percent, while for low-grade pills, he now failed only once every three attempts.

By now, Lin Xuan had little regard for low-grade pills, so the improved success rate didn't matter much to him. Mid-grade pills, however, were a different story. His recent trip to the Cloud Soaring Sect had not only allowed him to acquire the items he needed but also gave him insight into the market for various treasures in the cultivation world.

Although Body Tempering Pills were the most basic and common type of pill, mid-grade versions were still exceedingly rare.

Moreover, mid-grade pills remained immensely beneficial for enhancing his strength. With a higher success rate, he could now increase the proportion of mid-grade pills among the daily doses he consumed.

The maximum daily intake of Body Tempering Pills was nine. Previously, due to the scarcity of mid-grade pills, only one out of those nine would be mid-grade. Now, he could increase that to two or even three.

With the potent effects of these pills driving him forward, Lin Xuan's progress advanced by leaps and bounds. Over ten days later, he emerged from seclusion. Although he was still far from reaching the sixth layer, his foundation in the fifth layer had become extremely solid, and even his overall demeanor had subtly changed.

Yet, Lin Xuan's face showed little joy. Instead, his brows were tightly knit. While increasing his strength was a good thing, the higher his cultivation, the harder it became to conceal.

He knew his own circumstances all too well. Although the Discarded Pills Pavilion rarely saw visitors, he still needed to move around the sect occasionally. If an elder were to notice his cultivation level, the consequences would be dire.

The reason was simple—he was an ordinary person without a spiritual root. Less than a year ago, he had been struggling at the first layer of the Lingdong Realm. Yet in just a few months, he had advanced to the late stage. Only a fool wouldn't grow suspicious.

If they were to investigate thoroughly and uncover the secret of his blue starry sea...

Lin Xuan shook his head. Although the likelihood was slim—even cultivators far stronger than him would struggle to discern the state of another's dantian—it was better to be safe than sorry. He needed to prepare for every eventuality.

Besides, he still hadn't come up with a plausible excuse for his rapid advancement within a single year.

Was there a way to conceal his strength and prevent others from discerning his true cultivation level?

Frowning in thought, Lin Xuan realized he couldn't seek advice from his elders—he would have to find the answer himself through research.

He headed to the library. Only the first floor was accessible to low-level disciples. While it contained no cultivation techniques, it housed a wealth of miscellaneous knowledge. After spending an entire day searching, Lin Xuan finally found the answer he sought.

The *Compendium of Hundred Herbs* contained the following record:

"Crimson Vine Grass, when a century old, can be used to refine Body Tempering Pills and other spiritual medicines. Consuming it also has the wondrous effect of concealing one's cultivation level."

Overjoyed, Lin Xuan eagerly read on. Moments later, he closed the book, his expression shifting between hope and unease.

Crimson Vine Grass was considered a rare spiritual herb in the mortal world, but it was quite common in the cultivation world. It was used in refining Body Tempering Pills, and the sect had dedicated herb gardens where it could easily be found.

However, according to the book, Crimson Vine Grass was also graded. The ordinary variety was used for Body Tempering Pills, the mid-grade for Foundation Establishment Pills, and the highest quality for the Origin Restoration Pills consumed by Core Formation cultivators.

Lin Xuan's eyes widened at the mention of materials for Core Formation-level pills. It went without saying how precious those would be—utterly beyond his reach.

The *Compendium of Hundred Herbs* also clearly stated that only one in ten thousand Crimson Vine Grass plants would be of the highest grade.

Closing the book, Lin Xuan left the library. Though disappointed, his face remained impassive. Standing in an inconspicuous corner, he hesitated for a moment before deciding against returning to the Discarded Pills Pavilion. Instead, he headed toward the herb garden.

Half an hour later, Lin Xuan emerged from the herb garden with a bamboo basket filled to the brim with Crimson Vine Grass. He had traded a single low-grade Body Tempering Pill for it. Fortunately, the garden's overseer didn't recognize him and had treated him with great courtesy upon sensing his fifth-layer cultivation.

The reason Lin Xuan had procured so much Crimson Vine Grass was a sudden idea: if he could purify pills, could he do the same with herbs?

He wasn't entirely confident, but he had to try. If he could refine ordinary Crimson Vine Grass into the highest grade, wouldn't that solve his problem of concealing his cultivation?

Returning to the Discarded Pills Pavilion, Lin Xuan shut the door to his living quarters and took out a single Crimson Vine Grass from the basket. It was a plant about twenty years old, exuding a faint medicinal fragrance and still fresh from being recently unearthed.

In the cultivation world, Crimson Vine Grass was a rather unique herb. Different grades could be used to refine different pills. Low-grade Crimson Vine Grass was merely ordinary, mid-grade was relatively rare, and the highest grade was so precious that even Core Formation experts would fight over it. This alone spoke volumes about its value.

Only the highest-grade Crimson Vine Grass could conceal one's cultivation. Now, Lin Xuan was about to test whether the blue light points—which worked on finished pills—could also affect fresh herbs.
