# Chapter 30: The Alchemy Cauldron's Xiao Family  

"Fourteen days isn't an unreasonable timeframe. It seems this mission carries some danger, but not enough to be overly concerning."  

Wei Qian let out a sigh of relief.  

He had grown quite comfortable with the Li family and had no immediate plans to seek another faction. After all, while the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City was known as a sanctuary for rogue cultivators, it was also, in a sense, their graveyard.  

Every year, no fewer than a hundred cultivators perished in the vicinity of the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City—a staggering number.  

The Li Immortal Clan, a lineage with over two centuries of history, only had around three hundred cultivators in total. If placed in the Black Flood Dragon Immortal City, they could all be wiped out within three years.  

"I just hope there's enough time for me to complete my wish."  

Perhaps the heavens heard Wei Qian's prayer, or perhaps the Wishing Dragon Pearl took pity on him and granted an additional boon. Either way, fourteen days passed without incident, and Wei Qian successfully fulfilled his wish for safety.  

Now, with his mind at ease, he found himself eagerly anticipating the journey to the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City.  

This was an ancient city with a history spanning over two thousand years, continuously expanding since its founding. Today, it had grown to ten times its original size, covering a vast area of five hundred square miles and housing more than six million members of the Xiao Clan.  

The history of this single city surpassed the combined reigns of all twenty-four dynasties from Wei Qian's past life!  

How could he not be fascinated?  

"The Alchemy Cauldron's Xiao Clan started as nothing more than a minor cultivation family," Wei Qian recalled from the miscellaneous texts he had read. "It wasn't until one generation produced a particularly talented alchemist that the family's rise truly began."  

The story of the Xiao Clan's revivalist ancestor was nothing short of legendary.  

Initially, he was discovered to possess an Earth-grade spiritual root, allowing him to cultivate smoothly to the late Qi Refining stage. But then, for unknown reasons, his talent suddenly deteriorated, and his cultivation regressed to the third level of Qi Refining. He became a laughingstock, even suffering the humiliation of his fiancée publicly breaking off their engagement.  

After thirty years of obscurity, the ancestor suddenly re-emerged in spectacular fashion. Within a decade, he reached the peak of Qi Refining, and in just three more years, he successfully formed his Foundation.  

From then on, his life seemed blessed by fate itself—defeating powerful enemies, winning the hearts of beauties, and advancing all the way to the peak of the Golden Core stage.  

Later, after two more Core Formation experts emerged within the clan to secure its future, the ancestor finally departed to seek the opportunity to form his Nascent Soul in the wider world.  

Of course, he most likely failed.  

After all, in the two thousand years since, he had never been seen again. Even if he had succeeded in forming his Nascent Soul, the passage of time would have long since claimed him.  

"Rumors have always persisted that the reason for the Xiao ancestor's rise was his acquisition of the complete legacy of a fourth-rank alchemist," Wei Qian mused. "If I could obtain such an opportunity, become a master alchemist myself, wouldn’t I be able to replicate his legend and establish a legacy lasting millennia?"  

The thought filled him with envy.  

"I’ll need to find the right moment, the perfect opportunity to reveal my alchemical talent."  

Though he had never once refined a pill, Wei Qian was brimming with confidence. With the Wishing Dragon Pearl by his side, even if he lacked innate talent, he would eventually cultivate it.  

Thirteen days after his wish was fulfilled, Li Wanqing summoned Wei Qian and announced that they would depart for the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City that very day.  

Fully prepared, Wei Qian had already stocked his storage pouch with all necessary supplies. Without needing to return for anything, he set off immediately.  

Li Wanqing’s group consisted of eight people, two of whom Wei Qian recognized—Li Wanhai and Li Guchen.  

Li Wanhai’s inclusion was unsurprising. At the seventh level of Qi Refining and with additional training in body refinement, he would be a valuable asset to the team.  

But Li Guchen’s presence was puzzling. With his decent talent, such a promising seedling should have been kept safe at home.  

What Wei Qian didn’t know was that Li Wanqing’s team had a hidden mission—to preserve the Li family’s legacy.  

As soon as they descended from Mist Ridge Mountain, they mounted sturdy steeds and raced toward the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City.  

Unbeknownst to them, thirty miles away in a dense forest, a group of observers lay in wait.  

Clad in black robes and wearing masks despite the daylight, this mysterious group had been lurking in the woods for half a month.  

"Patriarch, should we strike now and eliminate this group?" one of the masked cultivators asked.  

The one addressed as Patriarch shook his head. "If we kill them now, we can forget about luring out that old fox Li Xianyao."  

"But our mission is to prevent the Li family from producing another Foundation Establishment cultivator. If Li Xianyao doesn’t show himself, then—"  

Before the man could finish, the Patriarch’s aura flared with a sharp, oppressive force, silencing him instantly.  

"One more word, and I’ll send you to the depths of Blackwater Pond to feed that mutated beast."  

With those words, the Patriarch inadvertently revealed their true identity—they were members of the Wang family!  

The subordinate immediately dropped to his knees, kowtowing. "This unworthy one thanks the Patriarch for his mercy."  

"Get out of my sight."  

The young Wang Patriarch had no intention of wasting more time on the Li family. Once Li Xianyao was dead, the Mist Ridge Li Clan would be finished.  

As for Li Wanqing’s group, he would hunt them down later. They were no threat.  

Meanwhile, Wei Qian and Li Wanqing’s party traveled eight hundred miles in a single day. By nightfall, they finally allowed themselves a measure of relief.  

"We’ve come this far without encountering any Wang family pursuers. It seems this trip to the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City truly will be perilous but ultimately safe," Wei Qian thought.  

The other Li clansmen shared his optimism, their faces bright with relief.  

Their good spirits lasted until noon the next day, when a jade token on Li Wanqing’s person suddenly shattered.  

"This is the warning token bestowed by the Patriarch. It has a range of two hundred miles. If the master token is crushed, all subordinate tokens will shatter in response!"  

Something catastrophic had happened—something so dire that the Patriarch had resorted to using the token to send a warning.  

Li Wanhai clearly understood the implications as well. The Patriarch was in grave danger.  

Exchanging a glance, neither Li Wanqing nor Li Wanhai showed any intention of turning back to aid their Patriarch.  

The priority now was to reach the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City with the storage pouch containing thirty thousand low-grade spirit stones.  

If Li Wanqing could successfully establish his Foundation, all of the Li family’s troubles would be resolved.  

Without hesitation, Li Wanqing barked his orders:  

"All members—set out immediately for the Alchemy Cauldron Immortal City!"  

"Spare no effort!"  

With that, he spurred his horse forward, leading the charge.
