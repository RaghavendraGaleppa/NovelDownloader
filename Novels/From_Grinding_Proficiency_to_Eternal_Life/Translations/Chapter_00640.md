# Chapter 640: The Opportunity to Begin the Divine War

Zhang Ziyang's analysis of the Divine Path of Incense and Fire had grown increasingly profound. Combining the *Mystic Spirit Transformation Divine Path*, the various cultivation techniques of the weaker deities within Xu Yunfan's Star Spirit Banner, and the vast amount of Daoist scriptures and cultivation methods he had previously obtained, Zhang Ziyang had, within just a few months, deduced a more efficient path for transmitting faith and converting divine power.

Upon hearing this, Xu Yunfan could only admit that Zhang Ziyang's reputation as a figure comparable to the Ancestor of Pure Yang since the founding of the Dao Sect was no empty boast.

After Zhang Ziyang imparted this knowledge to Xu Yunfan, the latter used it to refine the sacrificial rites of the Frost Thunder City priests. This purified the faith energy, increasing the efficiency of divine power conversion by another ten percent.

With his foundation established, Xu Yunfan ceased his aggressive maneuvers. Several years passed quietly, and the indestructible golden nature within him silently increased to seventeen strands.

The proto-world within him grew increasingly stable, its boundaries clear. Purple-gold thunder patterns roamed within, brimming with vitality.

On this day, just as Xu Yunfan finished reinforcing the array formations within the Star Spirit Banner's space, a sudden disturbance came from the Thunder God's Core within him.

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow slightly.

Ever since he had subdued the Winter God, Lockman, the deity had actively avoided him unless summoned, let alone initiate contact himself.

A sweep of his divine sense revealed that the core's vibration was not a summons from a high-ranking god, but rather a牵引 at the level of laws.

The rules for the succession of divine domains in the Aetila World had been activated.

Countless streams of detailed information flooded the core of his divine core. They were the locations of all heavenly treasures and spiritual nodes containing the concept of thunder across the Northern Wastes, including even the positions of newly born, weak spirits related to thunder.

This was one of the benefits the world's Heavenly Dao granted to the possessor of the Thunder God's Core, making it easier for the deity to sort through their authority and strengthen their origin.

*So this is how it works?*

Although he had learned from Delis and others that there was a succession of divine domains, an opportunity for a deity to ascend, he had not expected it to be so intuitive.

If deities of the same level were seeking to ascend, would his own position be leaked?

Xu Yunfan pondered this. As he was currently in the Northern Wastes of Winter, a deity within the Natural Deity System, no one would come looking for him. Still, this was a good opportunity.

"No wonder Tatus managed to scavenge so many resources," Xu Yunfan realized, quickly sifting through the information.

His gaze locked onto a place three thousand miles to the north, a location known as Thunderstruck Valley.

The information indicated that a先天 Thunder Spirit was currently gestating there, which would be greatly beneficial to his origin-level Thunder God's Core.

Just as he prepared to set out, a sudden warning came from the divine core imprint Zhang Ziyang had left with him.

"Yunfan, three hundred miles east of Frost Thunder City, a massive amount of faith energy is being forcibly plundered. The target seems to be that newly awakened Thunder Rhino of the plains. The method is crude, carrying the stench of the Ice Plain Wolf God."

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow again.

Look at that. He had been sitting at home, racking his brain for a way to break the stalemate, and by waiting, someone had come to deliver the solution.

The Ice Plain Wolf God was another lesser deity subservient to the Winter Pantheon, whose territory bordered Xu Yunfan's Frost Thunder City.

When Tatus was around, the two deities had clashed constantly. Now that Tatus's aura had changed and he had been silent for several months, the wolf pup couldn't resist extending its claws.

"It seems even a green card holder can't avoid neighborhood disputes," Xu Yunfan mused.

He took a step out of his divine kingdom, his figure merging with the lightning as he shot toward the scene like an arrow.

Within his sleeve, the Star Spirit Banner pulsed with a dark light, and the newly refined banner spirit of Tatus, within the banner, flashed a glint of lightning.

On the plains, a young Thunder Rhino, its body wreathed in faint electric arcs and the size of a small mountain, was crying out in terror.

It was enveloped in a blood-red net of light, the source of which was three barbarian shamans clad in wolf pelts and with painted faces. They held bone staffs and chanted wild prayers, brutally extracting the faint spiritual light of faith the rhino had just凝聚ed to offer to the distant Ice Plain Wolf God.

A blue-white thunderbolt, without any warning, tore through the clear sky and struck the blood-red net with pinpoint accuracy.

*Crack!*

With a crisp sound, the net shattered instantly.

The three Wolf God shamans, as if struck by a heavy blow, flew backward, spewing blood, and the bone staffs in their hands splintered into pieces.

They looked up in horror to see Xu Yunfan's figure appearing in the高空 amidst the thunder, his body adorned with thunder patterns, his divine might like a prison.

"L-Lord Tatus!"

The lead shaman prostrated himself in terror.

"We were sent by God洛坎 to collect this newborn spirit of the wild..."

"Scram," Xu Yunfan's voice was cold, like rolling thunder sweeping across the plains. "Take one more step into my territory, and you die."

His words became law. A chain of lightning materialized out of thin air and lashed the ice plain before the three men, leaving a bottomless, scorched scar.

The three shamans were terrified out of their wits and scrambled away into the distance.

He had to play the part to the fullest. His style of operation should be similar to Tatus's, all to lure that wolf god into the open. After cultivating for so many years, he was still in need of a mount.

Xu Yunfan landed before the trembling Thunder Rhino.

The young beast's innocent eyes were filled with fear, instinctively sensing the vast thunder origin within the being before it.

Xu Yunfan extended his index finger, and a point of pure thunder divine power entered the rhino's forehead.

The gentle power instantly soothed its fear and guided the faint thunder spirit energy within its body.

The Thunder Rhino affectionately rubbed its head against Xu Yunfan's hand, and a thread of extremely pure, filial faith spontaneously connected to Xu Yunfan's Thunder God's Core before transferring to the Divine Sky Refining World Cauldron.

*This has potential.*

The faith energy from this single Thunder Rhino was enough to rival that of a hundred barbarian fanatics.

Zhang Ziyang's voice sounded in Xu Yunfan's heart: "A very pure spiritual faith, of extremely high quality. If you can guide this Thunder Rhino tribe to multiply and grow, the faith it produces could rival that of ten thousand ordinary believers."

Xu Yunfan would naturally not refuse this. Even if he didn't use it, Zhang Ziyang, who practiced the Divine Path of Incense and Fire, would need it. The larger the foundation of faith, the greater the strength.

The Northern Wastes of Winter were vast and desolate, with the ceaseless cold winds carrying fine ice crystals.

Xu Yunfan's figure constantly moved between the icy peaks and frozen earth.

After the rules for the succession of divine domains in the Aetila World were activated, the entire plain seemed to unfold before him like an invisible net, with nodes containing the concept of thunder clearly visible.

He had been exploring the plains for several months.

His divine sense swept over the locations marked by the laws.

Like a wisp of Ice Soul Thunder Crystal frozen deep within eternal ice, the Thunderstruck Wood Heart gestating within the remains of an ancient lightning-struck tree, and even at the bottom of a valley with constant thunderstorms, a newly born, ancient Thunder Spirit leaping with blue-white electric arcs...

These were all excellent resources to strengthen his Thunder God's Core, temper his own thunder origin, and even nourish the proto-world within him.

Xu Yunfan naturally did not stand on ceremony. Wherever he went, these thunder treasures, marked by the succession of divine domains and the resonance of his Thunder God's Core with the Heavenly Dao, were all collected by him and stored within the space contained within the Star Spirit Banner.

With every acquisition, every感悟 of the thunder essences nurtured by the heavens and earth, the imagery representing the foundation of his own Dao path slowly condensed in the depths of his spiritual sea.
