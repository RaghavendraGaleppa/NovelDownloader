**Chapter 181: The True Intent of Glorious Sun Auspicious Cloud**

Rumble!

On the Isle of Heroes, the crowd, still in shock, suddenly felt tremors from the ground beneath their feet. Before they could react, transparent ripples abruptly appeared in their field of vision. The next instant, square platforms, suffused with rich immortal light, silently emerged one by one. They were only a square foot in size, engraved with patterns of dragons, phoenixes, and various beasts, intertwined with mysterious Dao patterns, making them look incredibly exquisite.

However, in just two or three breaths, these bronze platforms, under the gaze of the crowd below, gradually grew to a hundred zhang in length and width, transforming directly into arenas. A heavy, ancient aura immediately diffused outwards. The arenas were positioned at varying heights, and their number… was exactly one hundred!

"Ten days later, those who remain on the arenas will advance, the rest will be eliminated. Those who wish to can now ascend the stages first."
"Each person can only challenge once; challengers who fail will be eliminated."
"Furthermore, arena defenders cannot refuse challenges, but they have three opportunities each day to request the secret realm to restore their consumption. Note: these cannot be used during arena battles."
"Advancing participants will be rewarded with 900 million points of Qi Luck, and a wisp of the True Intent of Glorious Sun Auspicious Cloud."

The majestic voice of the Secret Realm Spirit slowly echoed, and then, the colossal face covering the sky began to fade.

Below, the crowd exchanged glances, falling into an involuntary silence, their eyes flickering with indecision. Ascending an arena first to become a defender might sound disadvantageous, as one would face hundreds of challengers over the next ten long days. During this process, one's various methods would inevitably be exposed, highly likely attracting targeting from subsequent participants.

However, everything has its pros and cons. Stepping onto an arena first also meant an additional opportunity compared to others. More crucially, three opportunities each day to request the secret realm to restore one's consumption! This undoubtedly resolved many people's worries. In an instant, streaks of rainbow light suddenly flashed across the Isle of Heroes, as people scrambled to fly towards the various arenas. Powerful and chaotic magical power fluctuations immediately permeated the air. Many even started fighting for ownership directly outside the arenas. Among them, it was not uncommon for two people to fight fiercely over an arena, only for others to take advantage of the situation and slip in. Quite obviously, after some deliberation, the crowd's thoughts were almost identical: ascending an arena first to become a defender, the potential gains far outweighed the risks, especially since each person only had one challenge opportunity!

As time slowly passed, arena defenders emerged one by one. Intense magical fluctuations surged on some arenas. However, what was particularly strange was that the three highest arenas were clearly empty, not even a single figure, yet no one was willing to ascend them.

In the central area, "Fellow Daoists, it's time to find a different place to sit," Ji Changkong said somewhat boredly, a flicker of unusual light in his eyes as he glanced at the three empty arenas at the top.

"Indeed," Zhang Jing and Chang Jin, whose face was hidden in mist, nodded in unison. In fact, just now, when the Secret Realm Spirit announced the rule of only one challenge opportunity per person, Zhang Jing had already anticipated the current situation, so he felt no surprise at all. Furthermore, he estimated that throughout the entire third round, not only the three of them, but also Qu Junhou and the others, as well as several powerful beings from the myriad heavens' faction, such as the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc—in short, any existence that had previously displayed formidable strength—their arenas would likely be very quiet. Thinking of this, a wry smile involuntarily appeared on Zhang Jing's face. How could he have foreseen that the third round, which should have been more tense and fiercely competitive, would inexplicably become quiet for him? However, Zhang Jing also understood that all of this was merely the calm before the storm. The real battle would be in the upcoming final round!

On the other side, several beings from the Myriad Spirits of the Heavens faction, including the Water-Avoiding Deer, had already chosen their arenas and were quietly waiting for the final round to begin. Only two massive figures, a roc and a goat, remained in place.

"Brute, what are you doing?" The Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc fixed its sharp gaze on the Mountain-Carrying Great Strength Goat Demon, who was stubbornly holding onto its tail feathers, and asked coldly.

"We can't be defenders!" The Goat Demon's honest and muffled voice sounded, causing the other party's gaze to suddenly freeze.

"Why not?"

"We both failed the task the master assigned earlier. The only way to make up for it now is for you to challenge Zhang Jing of the Taiyi Boundless Dao Sect, and I'll challenge the Human Emperor Dao—"

"What?!" Before the other party could finish speaking, the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc couldn't help but cry out in shock, its eyes filled with astonishment. In its mind, the monstrous figure that had swept towards its master and the other human with terrifying momentum the moment it ascended the Isle of Heroes suddenly appeared. *It* challenge Zhang Jing?! It probably couldn't even withstand a casual blow from the other party.

"Brute, are you mad? Did those humans smash your brain? This... what's the difference between this and directly giving up on advancing?" The Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc stammered, clearly enraged.

Opposite, the Goat Demon seemed to completely ignore the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc's "I'll eat you" gaze, merely continuing in a stubborn voice: "We might not be their match, but... we should be able to force out some of their methods. That way, when the next stage, the ranking battle, begins, our master will have the advantage, and you and I will have atoned for our failures."

"Heh heh, Brute, you think too highly of yourself, forcing out some methods... Aren't you afraid they'll slap you to death then?" The Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc scoffed, looking at the other party as if it were an idiot. "If you don't want those 900 million Qi Luck points, I still want them!"

Just then, *Ding-a-ling~* Accompanied by the sound of silver bells, a graceful figure, her face shrouded in mist, suddenly appeared before the two colossal beasts. It was none other than Chang Jin, who had just separated from Zhang Jing and the other person.

"Alright, this isn't your fault. You don't need to challenge those two humans." A melodious, clear voice with a hint of majesty suddenly rang out. "I am the direct bloodline descendant of a Heavenly God, naturally possessing the divine abilities inherited from my ancestor. How could those two humans be my opponents?"

As soon as she spoke, the Scarlet-Eyed Golden Roc and the Mountain-Carrying Great Strength Goat Demon were instantly shaken, then hurriedly and respectfully replied in unison, "Yes!" Especially the Goat Demon. At this moment, it suddenly brightened up. *Right!* Their master was a direct descendant of a Heavenly God, divine blood flowing through her veins. How could those two humans be her opponents? What it had just done was purely unnecessary.

Ten days quietly passed. On one of the topmost arenas, Zhang Jing slowly opened his eyes, his gaze sweeping over the many arenas below and the Isle of Heroes. He then involuntarily let out a sigh. In his sight, the Isle of Heroes, which had previously been bustling and noisy, had now completely returned to tranquility. Only a sparse dozen or so people remained on the Isle of Heroes. They were gravely examining the numerous arenas above, seemingly contemplating which one offered a higher chance of victory. However, how many of the cultivators who had emerged from these ten days of brutal competition were easy to deal with?

*Whoosh—* Above the sky, a colossal, sky-covering face suddenly appeared. The next moment, "Time is up, the third round is over!" the giant face said expressionlessly. In an instant, streaks of white light illuminated. The entire secret realm instantly had only the hundred people on the arenas remaining. Not until this moment did a brilliant smile slowly emerge on the Secret Realm Spirit's face.

"Congratulations, after layers of competition, you have finally defeated 38 million cultivators of the same rank and reached the final round! As true geniuses, this is your well-deserved reward!"

As it spoke, Zhang Jing suddenly felt as if a sun had appeared before his eyes. That was— He couldn't help but look up at the Secret Realm Spirit in the sky. He saw an incomparably vast and dazzling golden sun slowly emerge from the rippling void. Immediately after, streaks of golden light burst forth from the auspicious clouds beneath the golden sun, then slowly settled in front of every person on the arenas, including himself.

"A wisp of the True Intent of Glorious Sun Auspicious Cloud?" Zhang Jing's gaze slightly froze. At this moment, his Dao Yuan Auspicious Cloud Dharma Seed seemed to sense something. It actually began to tremble, and an inexplicable and strong longing suddenly arose in his heart.
