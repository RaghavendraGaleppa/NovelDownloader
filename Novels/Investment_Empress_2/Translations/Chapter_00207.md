**【號：八臂幼蛟】**

"Little Marquis Zhong's ranking has risen again. It seems he benefited greatly from the Martial Dao Summit."

"I know about him escaping from the Heavenly Demoness."

"Oh? Did a top-five genius from the潜龍榜出手 to help him?"

"You don't know about Li Jianxian killing eight thousand assassins from the Fine Rain Building with a single sword that day?"

"How many? Eight thousand?!"

"That's too exaggerated even for a storybook."

"Miss Ying also made a move. That witch was beaten back by the two of them combined. Hmph, she could only scurry away with her tail between her legs!"

"Have you all seen Miss Ying's lecture at the Hengyun Sword City?"

"I have. She's truly as beautiful as a celestial fairy, not like someone from the mortal world."

Whispers spread throughout the shores of the Fish Dragon Lake.

Although the ranking was about Zhong Zhenyue, the conversation had somehow been steered elsewhere.

...

Inside the tavern.

"Zhong Zhenyue was able to escape from a Interior Scene expert..."

Young Master Li calculated his own strength.

With his current eighty acupoints unlocked and the加持 of World Power, he could also fight against an Interior Scene expert, provided he didn't have the aid of Junior Brother Xiao Bao or that War Soul Talisman.

Of course, it also depended on what kind of Divine Intent the Interior Scene expert had manifested. He should be fine against Upper Form ones.

He also had to consider that he couldn't maintain the World Seed's加持 for long.

"You and Little Bing'er actually joined forces to repulse the sixth on the潜龍榜?"

Qian Bufan's eyes widened in shock.

"That's what the ranking says, it shouldn't be false..."

Xue Jing looked at Li Mo, then at Ying Bing, his expression blank.

"Old Xue, pull yourself together. We are elders, at least."

"Old Qian, stop trembling. You're spilling boiling water all over your crotch."

Yin Mianmian wasn't an Interior Scene expert, merely at the eighth acupoint of Divine Observation.

However, every one of the top ten on the潜龍榜 has the glorious record of being able to kill an Interior Scene expert head-on.

"Yin Mianmian was only at the third acupoint of Divine Observation when she schemed to seize the sword mark that day," Ying Bing said softly.

Moreover, if she encountered Yin Mianmian now, and the latter was still only at three acupoints, she was confident she could take her down.

"That's still very impressive," Xue Jing took a deep breath and asked his disciple's disciple, "How did you two join forces that day?"

"Huh?"

Li Mo glanced at his beautiful Master out of the corner of his eye and said seriously, "I used my Master's signature technique. Its power is immense. Once unleashed, it allowed Bing'zi to seize the initiative and exploit the opponent's flaw."

Qian Bufan and Xue Jing were confused.

Shang Wu's signature technique?

"Right, Bing'zi?"

"Mm... That's right."

"I knew it."

Li Mo laughed heartily.

"Hmph, not bad for my disciple. You didn't learn in vain."

Shang Wu reached out and high-fived her precious disciple. She was delighted, even though she didn't know what technique she had actually taught that Li Mo had used.

Ying Bing looked at Li Mo high-fiving her Master and无奈ly curled the corner of her mouth.

This guy...

Soon, new words appeared in the Dragon Gate.

**【潜龙榜第八十三名：徐逸。】**

**【武學：觀神八竅，一線劍圓滿，裂影身法大成，觀摩隱魁之神。】**

**【戰績：雲州無間試煉魁首，刺殺觀神九竅，嘯江虎羅無病，成功刺殺有兩位半步外景保護的雲州富商，此人劍術極強，然因為觀摩的神意，似乎精神記憶方面有些問題，唯利是圖。】**

**【號：瘋劍人屠，加錢閻王。】**

"A butcher from the Fine Rain Building..."

Li Mo extended his teacup, only to see the waiter holding a teapot with a long, sharp spout. A stream of tea water condensed into a thin line and precisely landed in the cup.

"Impressive," Jiang Chulong clapped her hands.

"I've long heard that the Fine Rain Building is purely profit-driven. I wonder to what extent."

The前辈 at Hengyun Sword City had warned him.

---

Having failed to争夺 the strange stone, the Fine Rain Building surely wouldn't let the matter rest. Senior Brother Ouyang was the best example. Li Mo was also thinking about how to deal with this.

"I've heard a bit," Ouyang said after Li Mo told him the truth. He had inquired a lot about the Fine Rain Building over the past few days. "Take this Xu Yi for instance."

"The Cloud Province wealthy merchant, Zou Gong, originally hired him to kill the Roaring River Tiger, Luo Wubing."

"However, after killing Luo Wubing, he turned around and killed his own employer, Zou Gong."

"It turns out Luo Wubing originally wanted to buy his own life, but Xu Yi refused. So Luo Wubing said he would spend money to buy the life of the one who killed him."

"So both the employer and the target died, and Xu Yi ate from both sides."

Ouyang said with a serious expression.

"What kind of person is this?" Li Mo frowned. "This is completely lacking in business ethics."

However, the waiter's voice suddenly came from the side: "Rumors in the江湖 are often unfounded. Many times, they are completely opposite to the truth."

"Oh? Have you heard other information?" Li Mo's eyes flickered as he watched the waiter's pouring动作.

The waiter pulled back the teapot and smiled. "It's also possible that the One-Line Sword, Xu Yi, ran into trouble while observing the Divine Intent, causing mental derangement."

"He often forgets his own identity, and sometimes even confuses the identities of his employer and his target."

"That's why he killed his employer by mistake before going after the target."

The waiter spoke vividly, as if he had been there himself.

"Hiss... That version you mentioned is quite interesting," Ouyang恍然大悟.

"Naturally, because I witnessed it with my own eyes," the waiter said, raising the teapot again.

"Which side were you following? Luo Wubing or Zou Gong?"

"No, I am Xu Yi."

The round, sharp teapot suddenly cut through the wind.

The water stream flowing from the spout transformed into a faint, shadowy line, seemingly devoid of any killing intent or murderous aura.

The spout was aimed directly at Li Mo's shoulder.

However.

He thought he had seized the initiative with a surprise attack, but someone was even faster.

His sword had only reached halfway when the collar of his shirt was grabbed from behind. He was lifted up like a little kitten.

Just as she was about to finish him off with a slap, Li Mo suddenly spoke: "Master, wait."

Young Master Li signaled to Ouyang with his eyes.

Ouyang then rushed over quickly with a rope.

Thus.

A Fine Rain Building assassin ranked eighty-third on the潜龙榜 was bound in a tortoise-shell tie.

The长老s looked at him with unfriendly expressions.

Shang Wu crossed her arms and spat lightly: "Trying to hide your killing intent in front of me? Your observed Divine Intent is somewhat interesting..."

"Who sent you?"

Li Mo noticed that the opponent's sword strike had contained no killing intent.

"Why did you tie me up like this, Boss?"

Xu Yi's eyes were full of panic, as if the one who had just attacked wasn't him.

"So he really is mentally unstable," Li Mo saw that his慌乱 didn't seem fake.

A清辉月影 appeared, shining coldly and宁静ly upon him.

Visibly, the waiter's trembling body stabilized, and a look of killing intent appeared in his eyes.

At this moment.

He was the true Mad Sword Butcher.

This was interesting. He only regained his sanity under specific circumstances, completely changing into a different person at other times.

That's why Li Mo hadn't sensed his killing intent at first. He only confirmed it after using the Eye of Fate.

"Speak. What's going on."

Li Mo pointed to Shang Wu beside him and sighed, "If you don't speak, I'll hand you over to my Master."

"I..."

Xu Yi wanted to act tough for a moment, but he felt a gaze that seemed as if it wanted to devour him.

The sheer murderous aura was enough to give him nightmares tonight.

"I'll talk."
