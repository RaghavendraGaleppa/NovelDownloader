# Chapter 45: Rogue Cultivators Risking It All

After a small celebration that lasted a day, Wei Qian quickly returned to his usual routine.

They say time passes unnoticed in the mountains, and Wei Qian, living on the mountain, couldn't agree more!

Three months slipped through his fingers like flowing water.

During these three months, Wei Qian conducted three transactions with Bai Fugui, selling batches of Qi-Replenishing Pills, Antidote Pills, and a self-developed external medicine called "Hemostatic Powder."

From these three transactions, he earned a total of thirty spirit stones.

It wasn't much, but compared to the monthly stipend of five spirit stones from the Li family, it was a significant improvement.

He had agreed with Bai Fugui to conduct transactions on the first day of each month.

Today was the day.

Wei Qian packed the newly refined batch of Qi-Replenishing Pills and Antidote Pills into his storage pouch and headed down the mountain.

In the private room of the restaurant at the foot of the mountain, Wei Qian pushed the door open and noticed an additional figure inside.

Immediately, his brows furrowed.

"Who is this?" he asked, displeased, looking at Bai Fugui.

If Bai Fugui couldn't provide a satisfactory explanation, their business relationship would end here.

Bai Fugui quickly sensed Wei Qian's displeasure and hurriedly introduced, "This is my cousin, Bai Fujie."

"I asked him to be my 'bodyguard.'"

"Things have been chaotic lately—demonic cultivators causing trouble, and rogue bandits taking advantage of the situation."

"My cultivation is low, and if I die, it's no big deal. But if I fail to complete the tasks you've assigned, that would be my greatest failure."

"Look, didn't I manage to find that concealment technique you asked for last time?"

With that, Bai Fugui took out a booklet from his storage pouch and presented it with both hands.

Wei Qian accepted the booklet titled *Concealment Technique* and flipped through a few pages, skimming key sections to confirm there were no major issues. His expression softened slightly.

"Indeed, things have been unstable lately. You really should have a bodyguard, or you'll be robbed sooner or later."

Bai Fugui's business was small, but even so, he was far wealthier than Wei Qian had been as a rogue cultivator. It was no surprise that bandits might target him.

As for recruiting a cultivator from his family... Wei Qian glanced at Bai Fujie, estimating that the man was at least two decades older than Bai Fugui, yet his cultivation was only at the fifth level of Qi Refining.

Noticing Wei Qian's gaze, Bai Fujie immediately lowered his head in respect.

Among the three present, he was the oldest in age, but Wei Qian had the highest cultivation.

According to the rule in the cultivation world—*age matters not, the strong lead*—Wei Qian was the senior!

Thus, Bai Fujie felt no shame in bowing to a much younger man.

Seeing his respectful attitude, Wei Qian shifted his attention back to Bai Fugui and gave a mild warning: "But next time something like this happens, you must discuss it with me first. No acting on your own."

"Otherwise, our partnership ends here. Understood?"

"Understood. I'll definitely consult you first next time," Bai Fugui said, wiping nonexistent sweat from his forehead.

The transaction could wait. Wei Qian sat down first and listened as Bai Fugui recounted the major and minor events that had occurred in the region over the past month.

The first piece of news was about the response of the Yunzhou's leading sect, the Flowing Clouds Sect, to the demonic cultivators' unrest.

They had formed a specialized "Enforcement Team" to deal with the demonic cultivators.

The team was led by Flowing Clouds Sect disciples but also recruited rogue cultivators—mainly as cannon fodder.

Yet, according to Bai Fugui, even as cannon fodder, many rogue cultivators were desperate to join the Enforcement Team.

The reason became clear when Wei Qian saw the contribution exchange list issued by the Flowing Clouds Sect.

At the top of the list was a low-grade "Foundation Establishment Pill," requiring 15,000 contribution points to exchange!

Generally, for cultivators who reached the peak of Qi Refining before the age of sixty, a standard Foundation Establishment Pill increased the success rate of breaking through to Foundation Establishment by 30%. A low-grade pill increased the chance by about 15%.

Even so, this low-grade Foundation Establishment Pill was enough to drive rogue cultivators into a frenzy.

After all, attempting to break through to Foundation Establishment without a pill was risky.

Failure could result in injuries, a regression in cultivation, or even death!

But with a Foundation Establishment Pill, even if the breakthrough failed, one's life would be spared.

No wonder rogue cultivators in Yunzhou were so excited.

Bai Fugui noticed Wei Qian's apparent indifference and couldn't help but wonder.

*That's a Foundation Establishment Pill! Even if it's low-grade, it's still a Foundation Establishment Pill!*

Even his small cultivation family was moved. The eldest elder, an eighty-four-year-old at the ninth level of Qi Refining, had stepped forward to sign up.

Of course, he wasn't qualified to use the pill—his chances of success were slim.

But that didn't stop him from taking the risk for the sake of his descendants.

If the family produced even one Foundation Establishment cultivator, the Bai family could transform from a minor clan on the brink of collapse into a major lineage like the Li family of Misty Ridge or the Wang family of Blackwater Pond, with centuries of heritage!

So Bai Fugui had expected Wei Qian to show some excitement. Instead, he seemed utterly indifferent, as if the pill was beneath his notice.

Of course, Bai Fugui kept these thoughts to himself and didn't voice them aloud.

He then dutifully reported other news—rumors of rampaging spirit beasts in certain areas, rogue cultivators unearthing centuries-old spirit herbs in the Beast Mountain Range, and so on.

Wei Qian listened but didn't delve deeper into these matters.

Finally, after all the updates were shared, the two proceeded with their transaction.

Wei Qian checked the spirit stones in the storage pouch, confirmed the count was correct, and nodded before leaving to return to Misty Ridge.

Bai Fujie, the fifth-level Qi Refining cousin, watched Wei Qian's figure ascend the mountain and gradually disappear into the distance. Suddenly, he murmured, "How nice. If my family had a spirit land like this, maybe I could break through to the sixth level of Qi Refining."

Bai Fugui overheard the remark but didn't pay it much mind. He replied casually, "Obtaining a spirit land is too difficult."

"Unless something happens to the cultivation families occupying them, how would newcomers like us ever get a share?"

Bai Fujie's voice grew quieter. "You're right, Fugui. Unless they fall, we won't get anything..."

"But we should still have hope. Maybe one day, our Bai family will claim a spirit land too!" Bai Fujie suddenly spoke louder, patting Bai Fugui on the shoulder.

"Hah, then I'd never have to do business outside again. I'd just work for the family," Bai Fugui joked.

The figures of the two Bai family cultivators gradually faded into the distance.
