# Chapter 48: Martial Arts Grandmaster and Successive Challenges

This "Brother Yuan" wasn't alone—by his side stood a young maiden of fifteen, the age when girls traditionally came of age in ancient China.

Wei Qian had never met this girl before, yet she wasn't unfamiliar to him. "This must be Xiao Mei, right?"

Years ago, he had roamed the martial world with a group of companions, among whom was this very Brother Yuan.

Later, Brother Yuan had unexpectedly discovered that a fleeting romantic encounter had left him with a daughter. He bid farewell to Wei Qian and the others, retiring from the martial world to raise his child.

"That's right. In the blink of an eye, so many years have passed, and this little girl has grown so much," Brother Yuan said with a hearty laugh, patting his daughter's head.

Miss Yuan, however, was displeased with her father's affectionate gesture and quickly stepped aside. She was grown now, yet her father still treated her like a little girl.

"You're here seeking the immortal's favor too, aren't you?" Brother Yuan asked, his tone leaving no room for doubt. "I've already prepared a boat. Why not come with us?"

When an old friend extends an invitation, it would be impolite to refuse. Wei Qian agreed immediately.

The vessel Brother Yuan had prepared was more of a ship than a mere boat—a massive three-thousand-dan* vessel docked at the pier, flying a grand banner boldly inscribed with the words "Rampant Across the Four Seas."

*(Note: A traditional Chinese unit of capacity for ships, approximately 60 kg or 132 lbs per dan.)*

Wei Qian's ears twitched slightly as he caught snippets of conversation from the crew, easily deducing that this was the ship of the "Four Seas Gang," a dominant force in the local Daze County.

Brother Yuan began to explain, "Originally, I just wanted to live a quiet life with Mei'er. But fate had other plans. After I retired, my enemies came after me. I had no choice but to re-enter the martial world and join the Four Seas Gang. Now, I've managed to become its leader."

The moment Wei Qian stepped onto the deck, an overwhelming aura erupted from Brother Yuan. Sensing it, Wei Qian realized with astonishment that his old friend had already reached the Grandmaster realm in martial arts!

"Brother Yuan can't be more than forty-something years old. A martial arts grandmaster at this age—he might even have the potential to advance to the Great Grandmaster realm in the future!"

Yet this was pathetically weak.

The title of Martial Arts Grandmaster might intimidate ordinary folk, but against cultivators, such warriors would be slaughtered as easily as clay chickens and straw dogs. After all, this was a world of immortal cultivation, not some high-martial world where martial arts could ascend to divine heights.

The prevailing order of this world was clear: Qi Refining, Foundation Establishment, Core Formation, Nascent Soul, and Divine Transformation—step by step toward immortality!

Still, Wei Qian wasn't about to spoil the moment. He congratulated Brother Yuan sincerely, lifting the gang leader's spirits enough to order a small banquet on board.

During the feast, the intoxicated Gang Leader Yuan repeatedly offered Wei Qian a position as a hall master with real authority in the Four Seas Gang, should he fail to obtain the immortal's favor.

Wei Qian noticed a young man standing nearby whose expression darkened at these words, his head bowing sullenly.

That night, instead of staying in the luxurious cabin arranged for him, Wei Qian climbed to the top of the mast, gazing into the distance. Above him hung a bright moon, its pure light bathing his figure.

The mortal world was too mired in worldly affairs. He preferred this kind of serene, natural scenery.

The young man from earlier was likely Gang Leader Yuan's adopted son or disciple. What exactly his relationship was didn't matter to Wei Qian—it was meaningless.

In this world, mortals rarely lived past 120 years. Martial artists, burdened by lifelong battles and accumulated injuries, often didn't even live as long as ordinary people who took care of their health. Wei Qian, however, had already taken many steps on the path of immortal cultivation and would continue onward.

Thirty years, sixty years, a hundred and twenty years from now—what would things look like then? Would the Four Seas Gang, now dominant in Daze County, still exist, or would it have vanished without a trace?

For cultivators like him, time was both the greatest enemy and the greatest ally.

Looking up at the moon, he couldn't help but recite: "The moon we see today is not the moon of ancient times, yet this same moon once shone upon the ancients."

The verse stirred something within him, reminding him of an ancient text he'd once read. It claimed that long, long ago, there were three suns and seven moons in the sky. Everyone, including cultivators, dismissed this as the ravings of someone who'd eaten too many hallucinogenic mushrooms.

But now Wei Qian wondered: if the ancient text spoke truth, where had the other six moons gone? What cataclysmic changes had occurred to reduce seven moons to just one?

He chuckled and shook his head. "Why do I always ponder such distant matters?" Even in his previous life as an ordinary person, he'd often found himself contemplating the vast mysteries of the universe.

Perhaps this was simply his nature.

Putting aside his musings, he closed his eyes and began circulating his energy. The spiritual energy here was too sparse for proper cultivation, but he'd formed the habit of never wasting a single day.

The next morning, the great ship finally set sail, cutting through the waves toward the depths of Pingyang Lake.

On the deck, Gang Leader Yuan explained, "According to intelligence gathered by my Four Seas Gang, half a month ago, a strange mist appeared at the center of Pingyang Lake, enveloping the island there. Anyone who enters becomes disoriented, unable to proceed further. That's also where signs of immortals have been most frequently seen."

Gang Leader Yuan planned to sail to the edge of the mist, hoping for a chance encounter with an immortal.

At this, Wei Qian couldn't help but smile faintly. This Brother Yuan, this Gang Leader, would never imagine that while he searched far and wide for immortals, one stood right beside him!

Just as Wei Qian was about to reveal this directly, a young man's voice interrupted.

"Why does this brother laugh? Does my adoptive father's account contain some error? If so, I'd like to hear your thoughts."

Wei Qian glanced over—it was indeed the young man from before. Far from being angered, he clapped his hands and laughed. "Yes, yes! This is exactly how it should unfold!"

He'd just been thinking that if he revealed his identity now, this young man would lose his chance to challenge and embarrass himself. And right on cue, here came the classic "arrogant young master" trope.

The coincidence was almost as if some unseen hand was orchestrating events.

Gang Leader Yuan frowned slightly. "Brother Wei, has this elder brother said something wrong?"

Before Wei Qian could respond, he was interrupted again—this time by a voice from the sky.

"Big brother! There's a ship below—perfect for us to rest on!"
