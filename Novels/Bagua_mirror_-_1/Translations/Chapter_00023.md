# Chapter 23: Spirit-Probing Bees

The so-called Spirit-Protecting Wall was originally a layer of rock encasing the spiritual vein. However, this particular layer of rock possessed unique properties—extremely tough and resilient. When the spiritual vein was still intact, not even a mere Qi Refining cultivator could breach it, let alone the pinnacle experts of the cultivation world.  

Only after the spiritual vein was exhausted and transformed into a spirit stone mine would this protective layer gradually weaken, allowing Qi Refining cultivators to break through it with specialized mining tools.  

Unfortunately, as soon as Qin Chong's spiritual sense touched the Spirit-Protecting Wall, it was violently repelled. His spiritual sense couldn't penetrate it—it couldn't even make contact.  

Frowning, Qin Chong had no choice but to rely on the faint sensations from his palm to probe further.  

Yet this method proved ineffective as well. The spiritual energy emanating from the spirit stones inside was completely blocked, leaving only the faint traces that seeped through from Chen Mo's side.  

After some futile attempts, Qin Chong gave up. Noticing that the wall near Chen Mo wasn't too thick, he decided to take out his wall-breaking pick and start chiseling.  

*Clang!*  

A crisp sound echoed as the pick rebounded violently. Caught off guard, Qin Chong stumbled back several steps before regaining his balance.  

Looking back at the wall, he saw only a tiny indentation less than half an inch deep.  

A dark line formed on his forehead—this thing was *that* tough?  

"Hahaha, Fellow Daoist Qin, don't use brute force. Try channeling a sliver of spiritual energy into the pick and tap gently. It’ll save you energy."  

Clearly, despite his caution, Qin Chong—being inexperienced—had made a common rookie mistake.  

"Thank you for the advice, Fellow Daoist Chen. I was too reckless."  

"No worries. You'll get the hang of it in a few days. There's no need to rush."  

Following Chen Mo's method, Qin Chong tried again. Though the marks left on the wall were smaller, the rebound force nearly vanished, and the effort required was significantly reduced.  

Soon, rhythmic tapping sounds filled the small underground space.  

After over an hour, Qin Chong finally broke through—though only a fist-sized hole. At this rate, it would take him days just to clear a small section of the wall.  

Several hours later, exhausted, Qin Chong heard Chen Mo say, "Let's call it a day. There's an abandoned cave a few dozen feet ahead. You can rest there."  

Qin Chong had no objections. Since this was Chen Mo's mining spot, not having to search for his own on the first day was already a considerable advantage.  

From this perspective, Chen Mo taking half his earnings didn’t seem excessive.  

"Alright, I'll go recover then."  

The abandoned cave was similar in size to the mining spot, littered with fragments of the Spirit-Protecting Wall. All the spirit stones had long been extracted.  

Sitting cross-legged, Qin Chong began his recovery—though his mind remained active.  

The Spirit-Protecting Wall's material was truly peculiar. Not only was it incredibly tough and resistant to fire and water, but it also blocked spiritual sense and couldn’t be used for crafting artifacts. Strangest of all, it couldn’t even be stored in a storage pouch.  

Driven by curiosity, Qin Chong wondered if he could store it in his Bagua Space. But he quickly dismissed the idea—Chen Mo wasn’t far away, and it was best not to take unnecessary risks.  

Chen Mo, a rogue cultivator, was on his second stint here, having spent over five years in the mines. Yet, he only managed to extract a little over a thousand spirit stones per month, earning around fifty to sixty as his share.  

By that estimate, Qin Chong would be lucky to gather a few hundred stones in his first month, with earnings roughly half of Chen Mo's.  

Compared to his previous venture in the Gourd Valley, mining spirit stones was far more laborious. The only upside was the relative safety—the chances of cave-ins or encountering demonic beasts were minimal.  

Gradually, Qin Chong formed a plan. Once he could mine independently next month, he’d search for his own spot. Then, he could discreetly use the Bagua Space to stash a few extra stones.  

It wasn’t much, but hiding a few stones per month wouldn’t be impossible.  

Still, this was far from what he had imagined. Regrets were pointless now—there was no turning back. The next three years would be grueling.  

On the bright side, the spiritual energy deep in the mines was dense, thanks to the remnants of the former spiritual vein and the concentrated spirit stones.  

This made it an excellent place for cultivation. Qin Chong resolved to reach at least the peak of Qi Refining—if not the ninth layer—within these three years.  

And so, Qin Chong settled into the life of a laborer—alternating between mining and cultivating, much like his old office routine.  

Except now, he was doing manual labor, far less comfortable than sitting at a desk.  

Yet his mindset was entirely different. With grander ambitions and greater goals, enduring this hardship was nothing.  

---  

A month passed in the blink of an eye. Qin Chong followed Chen Mo out of the mine.  

During this time, he had collected 569 low-grade spirit stones. With a 5% commission and a base salary of 10 stones, his earnings totaled just over 40 stones—decent for a newcomer’s first month.  

In the overseer’s hall, cultivators queued to hand over their stones and receive payment.  

With a guaranteed 10 stones, one might think slacking off and cultivating in the mines was an option.  

But that was impossible. Beyond the first month, anyone failing to mine at least 100 stones would be expelled and blacklisted by the Canglong Valley, barred from taking any of their tasks again.  

Given that the entire Pingyang Prefecture was under Canglong Valley’s influence, such a ban would effectively end one’s prospects in the region.  

Unlike Huang Fei’s methods, the overseers here employed Spirit-Probing Bees—spirit insects capable of detecting hidden items, even counting the stones inside storage pouches.  

Moreover, freshly mined stones carried a distinct aura, making them easily detectable by the bees.  

After submitting his stones and bidding farewell to Chen Mo, Qin Chong returned to his quarters.  

He rested for a full day before consuming a Spirit-Gathering Pill and resuming cultivation. A month in, he had adapted to the mining life.  

From now on, he’d have more autonomy—though the principle of "more work, more gain" still applied.  

Some chose to slack; others worked overtime.  

For Qin Chong, he preferred spending more time in the mines. His priority was finding his own mining spot—once secured, things would become much easier.  

But such spots were hard to come by. It all depended on luck.  

Their sizes varied too. Chen Mo’s was relatively large, providing enough stones to last him a full year.
