# Chapter 72: The Marvelous Use of the Stone Tablet

The *Supreme Divine Thunder Primordial Magnetism Longevity Scripture* was inscribed upon a stone tablet condensed from the magic power of the Zhenren Chuanzong. This ensured the complete and secure preservation of the true method's content.

Now, this inheritance stone tablet appeared within Han Yue's sea of consciousness, pressing down so heavily that his spiritual sense ached and swelled. From this moment onward, Han Yue could rely on this tablet to cultivate all the way to the fifth rank! Moreover, with the protection of the Longevity Zhenren's magic power, this inheritance tablet guaranteed that the legacy would never fall into anyone else's hands.

This inheritance tablet was already a fourth-rank Longevity treasure. The *Zhixin Study* of the Divine Thunder Palace, utilizing the Longevity treasure *Innate Gourd Heart-Asking Meditation Mat*, transmitted the great Dao tablet to its disciples. The arrangement and efficacy of this method of transmission could be called the foremost among the major sects of the *Jade Sky Realm*!

However, the cost was exorbitantly high. Not only did it require the consumption of a Longevity-rank inheritance tablet, but it also relied on another fourth-rank treasure, the *Heart-Asking Meditation Mat*. Only a sect like the Divine Thunder Palace, with its sparse number of disciples, could afford such extravagance. Other top-tier sects only offered similar treatment to their true disciples—some major sects didn't even provide this level of resources to their true disciples!

Thus, becoming a disciple of the Divine Thunder Palace was undoubtedly an immense stroke of luck.

At this moment, the fortunate Divine Thunder Palace disciple Han Yue reluctantly rose from the *Heart-Asking Meditation Mat*. Since the great method's transmission was complete, Han Yue was no longer qualified to continue consuming the power of the Longevity treasure. A gentle force emanated from the mat, lifting Han Yue before it vanished from sight.

The experience of using the *Heart-Asking Meditation Mat* was exhilarating! Han Yue felt his thoughts sharpened and his comprehension enhanced—his speed of grasping various Dao methods had increased dozens of times over. Unfortunately, he had no idea when he would next have the opportunity to use such a treasure.

Now, the *Zhixin Study* stood empty. Yet a sudden thought surfaced in Han Yue's mind, reminding him that his quest for inheritance was not yet complete. Following his intuition, he approached the left-hand wall of the study. As he walked toward it, the wall blurred, and he passed straight through, entering a new chamber.

Within this room stood three slightly smaller stone tablets. As Han Yue approached, each emitted a faint white light. The inheritance tablet in his sea of consciousness seemed to receive this light, and a vast amount of information poured directly from the three tablets into his own.

For the first time, the inheritance tablet revealed its true function. Within the *Divine Thunder Tablet Forest*, only disciples possessing an inheritance tablet could read and record the information inscribed upon the tablets. At this moment, Han Yue's tablet absorbed the contents of the three tablets—an incredibly efficient method of information storage and transmission!

Han Yue swept his spiritual sense over his inheritance tablet, and the contents of three texts instantly appeared in his mind. Accessing them was effortless and swift, eliminating the need for memorization. Han Yue couldn't help but marvel at the tablet's brilliance.

He skimmed the three texts briefly, planning to study them in detail after leaving the forest. They were: *Records of the Divine Thunder Palace's Lineage and the Jade Sky Realm*, *An Examination of the Secretly Transmitted Divine Abilities of the Lineage*, and *Answers to Questions from New Disciples*—all written by Zhenren Chuanzong. These texts contained no cultivation secrets, only a wealth of knowledge and common sense. Han Yue was delighted; studying them thoroughly would finally free him from his ignorance of the cultivation world.

After storing the three texts, Han Yue turned and exited the small chamber, then approached the opposite wall and walked straight through it. Another room filled with stone tablets awaited him. Scanning the area, he counted over thirty inheritance tablets. He stepped forward and used his own tablet to examine their contents.

*Water-Avoiding Technique*, *Wind-Summoning*, *Minor Origin Shield*, *Qi-Forging Soldiers*—this room contained divine abilities and secret techniques cultivable at the Body Entry Realm. Most were minor techniques with limited power and potential. Han Yue was permitted to select three.

He had already made his choices. After a quick survey of all the techniques, he wasted no time selecting *Minor Thunder Sound Technique*, *Breath-Concealing Art*, and *Innate Great Hand Seal*. These three had been decided upon when Zhenren Chuanzong first introduced them. With his top-tier movement technique, he had no need for *Wind-Barrier Breaking*. Instead, the *Breath-Concealing Art* deeply appealed to him—he was no barbarian of the Northern Wastes! In the outer wilderness, his repertoire of skills—slicing noses, stabbing eyes, and drilling rear passages—relied heavily on a good concealment technique.

With these three techniques secured, Han Yue had completed all the entry procedures for becoming a Divine Thunder Palace disciple. He could hardly contain his eagerness to return and study his newfound inheritance.

Exiting the *Zhixin Study*, he retraced his steps at a brisk pace. In the pavilion, Zhenren Chuanzong remained absorbed in his book. Seeing Han Yue approach, he set it down and spoke:

"Yuanchu, once you leave, you may choose any cave abode on Wuhui Peak. That vast mountain has few living souls anyway. Should you encounter any difficulties in your cultivation, you may use the *Minor Thunder Sound Technique* to seek my guidance at any time. Go now!"

Han Yue bowed deeply in gratitude to Zhenren Chuanzong before departing the *Divine Thunder Tablet Forest*. Though this was their first meeting, the Longevity Zhenren had already earned a place among Han Yue's most revered figures. The genuine care and acceptance from such a figure instantly strengthened Han Yue's sense of belonging to his new sect.

Emerging from the Black Dragon's Head, Han Yue felt a moment of disorientation. In the span of a single day, he had been utterly transformed. From this day forth, he would truly tread the path of immortality, contending with the prodigies and saintly heirs of the *Jade Sky Realm*! His heart surged with emotion, yet his expression remained stern—this was precisely what he had sought, what he had yearned for.

In a flash of golden light, Han Yue vanished from the Black Dragon's Head. The next instant, he stood before Miaolin's cave abode. There, he found Wang Mumu outside his dwelling, vigorously scrubbing the golden eagle's feathers with a massive steel brush. The eagle wore an expression of utter despair, squatting in the pit where the copper ball had once been, neither resisting nor making a sound.

Wang Mumu seemed in excellent spirits. Spotting Han Yue's return, she cheerfully called out:

"Uncle Yuanchu, you're back! Patriarch Tianyun found my Thunderball Technique too noisy, so he gifted me this eagle! Isn't she gorgeous? Thank you, Uncle, for bringing her back from the outer wilderness!"

Truly, no matter the era, no woman from the northeast could resist the allure of an eagle.
