# Chapter 63: Self-Foundation Establishment

After a flash of blue light, a line of text appeared before Lu Xu: [Low-grade Tier 2 Alchemist: 71/100 (30x)].
When he saw the words "30x," Lu Xu's eyelid twitched involuntarily.
The price of experience was getting more and more expensive.
Fortunately, he had anticipated this and had preemptively recharged two thousand spirit stones into the Azure Stone Tablet.
Now, with over 2700 copy points in the Azure Stone Tablet, copying the experience of this Tier 2 alchemist was more than enough.
He inwardly commanded: "Copy!"
After a torrent of blue light flashed, the elder's alchemy experience, down to the smallest detail, poured into Lu Xu's mind.
This time, upon receiving such a massive influx of experience, Lu Xu's eyes only glazed over for a moment before he quickly recovered.
With the surge in his spiritual power, absorbing experience no longer took a long time to digest as it used to.
The Tier 2 alchemist from the Merchant Alliance was completely unaware that the lifelong alchemy experience he had accumulated had been silently copied away.
After carefully examining the Moon Orchid, he looked at Lu Xu and asked, "Little friend, which bottleneck are you stuck at?"
"It's about the method for refining Qi Nourishing Pills," Lu Xu said, stating a fabricated bottleneck in alchemy. The old man didn't find it strange, as many alchemists encountered this particular hurdle.
After pondering for a moment, he began explaining to Lu Xu. Lu Xu listened intently, at times showing a puzzled expression, and at other times, an expression of sudden enlightenment.
An hour later, Lu Xu took his leave, and the old man hurriedly went to refine his pills with the Moon Orchid.
Upon returning home, Lu Xu immediately checked the Azure Stone Tablet:

The experience for refining Foundation Establishment Pills was now in his grasp.
Lu Xu recalled the elder's experience and found that this old alchemist was truly highly experienced in refining Foundation Establishment Pills. The old man had only started attempting Tier 2 pills when he was over one hundred and twenty years old. Now, being over two hundred and ten, he had already refined Foundation Establishment Pills more than ten times.
Initially, he had a few failures, but later on, Foundation Establishment Pills were almost effortless for him, having successfully refined four in a row.
"Excellent, excellent. This is precisely the kind of experience I need. Refining Foundation Establishment Pills is no longer an issue; now I just need to acquire the materials."

The next day.
Lu Xu carried a storage bag full of demon beast materials to a shop on Commercial Street. After some bargaining, he sold all the materials from the ten scaled apes.
This brought him an additional sixteen hundred spirit stones.
Afterward, Lu Xu continued his usual routine.
Cultivating, making talismans, refining pills, researching formations, and occasionally venturing into the Myriad Demon Mountain Range to hunt demon beasts and test the power of his formations.
In this way, another three years passed.

On this particular day, as Lu Xu was returning from Yifang Pavilion, he happened to run into Talisman Master Wang, who was just leaving.
Seeing the old man in such a hurry, he couldn't help but feel a little surprised: "Daoist Wang, what's got you rushing so?"
"Ah, it's Brother Lu!" Talisman Master Wang quickly walked up, grabbed Lu Xu, and pulled him towards the alley's exit, saying, "Daoist Wen Siming is about to emerge from seclusion! Many people in the alley have gone to see him. We should hurry, or we won't get a good spot."
"Daoist Wen Siming," Lu Xu suddenly recalled, this was the person who had reached the tenth layer of Qi Condensation a few years ago and had hopes of Foundation Establishment.
So, he had been in seclusion, seemingly to break through the Foundation Establishment bottleneck. No wonder Talisman Master Wang was in such a hurry.
As a famous figure in Fiery Cloud Alley, Daoist Wen had always garnered a lot of attention.
Once he successfully established his Foundation, no one would want to miss the opportunity to forge a good relationship with a Foundation Establishment cultivator.
Therefore, as the time for Daoist Wen's emergence from seclusion drew near, a large crowd from Fiery Cloud Alley rushed over.
Lu Xu was also very interested, so he quickly followed Talisman Master Wang, asking, "Did Daoist Wen get a Foundation Establishment Pill?"
Talisman Master Wang shook his head. "No, he didn't get that opportunity!"
Lu Xu's eyes showed a hint of remembrance. "I recall Daoist Wen previously hunting a Tier 2 demon beast, didn't he?"
Two years ago, Wen Siming, along with dozens of late-stage Qi Condensation cultivators, successfully killed a Tier 2 demon beast with the help of a formation.
This incident had once caused a stir in Fiery Cloud Alley, and even though Lu Xu spent most of his time in secluded cultivation, he had heard about it.

"There was nothing inside that demon beast, and in that battle, more than half of their group died or were injured. The formation they bought for several thousand spirit stones was also destroyed!"
"Since then, they haven't had the capability to hunt Tier 2 demon beasts again. Alas, Daoist Wen's luck truly isn't good!" Talisman Master Wang shook his head regretfully.
He had always paid close attention to Wen Siming, so he knew more of the inside story and recounted it in detail to Lu Xu.
"So that's how it is. Sigh, hunting Tier 2 demon beasts is indeed a dangerous endeavor!" Lu Xu sighed softly.
"Indeed! But Daoist Wen is a brave man. If it were me, I wouldn't dare step foot into the Myriad Demon Mountain Range in this lifetime!" Talisman Master Wang said with deep emotion.
Talisman Master Wang rather admired Wen Siming and secretly hoped that he could successfully establish his Foundation.
Speaking of which, he had personally witnessed how the other party had risen step by step from the bottom.
Daoist Wen's aptitude wasn't outstanding; he only had a mid-lower fire-attribute spirit root. Logically, he shouldn't have had the chance to meet the basic requirements for Foundation Establishment.
But in his youth, his ambition was high; he didn't want to remain in the Qi Condensation stage his entire life. So, when he was still at the third layer of Qi Condensation, he joined a demon-hunting group.
After countless brushes with death, he gradually grew from cannon fodder to a pillar of the demon-hunting group.
Eventually, he became a renowned expert far and wide.
During this period, he had encountered countless dangerous demon beasts, fought against rogue cultivators numerous times, and escaped death from betrayals just as many times.
He was a cultivator seasoned by hardship and struggle.
Because he frequently sold talismans to Daoist Wen, Talisman Master Wang was very familiar with his experiences.
In his opinion, such a hardworking and striving person should be granted a fitting outcome by heaven.
He should be given a chance at Foundation Establishment.
However, this Daoist Wen ultimately failed to obtain a Foundation Establishment Pill.
"So, he still chose to establish his Foundation on his own?" Lu Xu asked.
Talisman Master Wang nodded with dimmed eyes. "He had no other choice. He didn't want to merely survive his entire life at the late Qi Condensation stage, so he chose to take a gamble!"
Lu Xu also sighed upon hearing this. Self-Foundation Establishment truly meant grim prospects!
Generally, Qi Condensation cultivators had two ways to enter the Foundation Establishment stage: one was by relying on a Foundation Establishment Pill, and the other was by establishing their Foundation on their own.
Among those who attempted self-Foundation Establishment, aside from those with Heavenly Spirit Roots who could break through without any bottlenecks, everyone else faced a trial of life and death.
If Foundation Establishment failed, it could lead to death!
The liquefaction of spiritual power was an extremely perilous process. If it failed, the Dantian and meridians would all rupture. In such a situation, even if one didn't die, their cultivation would be completely lost.
However, if one consumed a Foundation Establishment Pill, the situation was different.
The reason Foundation Establishment Pills were so sought after, besides their ability to significantly increase the success rate of Foundation Establishment, was, more importantly, that they could save the life of a failed Foundation Establishment attempt.
Furthermore, even after a failed attempt, one's cultivation would not be affected at all, remaining at the tenth layer of Qi Condensation, still leaving opportunities for Foundation Establishment in the future.
Because of this, all cultivators pursued Foundation Establishment Pills. If they couldn't obtain one, most would abandon the idea of Foundation Establishment and instead live out their remaining decades carefree and joyful.
Those who chose to attempt self-Foundation Establishment, to gamble on that slim chance of success, were truly few and far between.
