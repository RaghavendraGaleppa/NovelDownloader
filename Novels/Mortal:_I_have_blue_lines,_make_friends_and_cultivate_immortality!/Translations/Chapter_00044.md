# Chapter 44: Gambling is When You Don't Know the Outcome! Investing is When You Do! (2/3)

"Huh?"

"What—"

Everyone present turned astonished gazes toward the Chen Family's Ancestor. Had they heard correctly?

Making this young girl the family head?

"Ancestor! This absolutely cannot be! How can we let Qiaoqian take the position of family head?!" The current Chen Family Head immediately protested.

"Why not?!" The Chen Family Ancestor's cold gaze swept over everyone present. "If any of you can help me obtain these mid-grade talismans, I'll let you be the family head too!"

Hearing this, everyone instantly deflated.

"Ancestor, if Qiaoqian becomes family head, what will I do?" the Chen Family Head—no, the former Chen Family Head—asked cautiously.

"You are not her father, so you must die!" The Chen Family Ancestor's words were icy and merciless.

"I—" The former family head's face turned pale, his body trembling like a sieve, too terrified to speak. He could tell the Ancestor wasn't joking.

"Ancestor, but I don't know how to be a family head. I don't even know what I'm supposed to do," Chen Qiaoqian said, never having imagined she would one day become a family head. She was completely clueless.

"Haha—" Facing Chen Qiaoqian, the Ancestor's expression softened into a kindly smile. "Qiaoqian, you don't need to do anything. Just give the orders, and others will handle the rest for you. You can keep doing what you've always done."

"Oh." Chen Qiaoqian nodded, seeming to understand.

"Ancestor, this is so unfair! You scold me but smile at Qiaoqian!" the former family head grumbled inwardly.

"Haah—" The Ancestor let out a long sigh, his face showing exhaustion as he slumped into his seat. His gaze swept over the gathered crowd. "Every single one of you here is a descendant of the Chen Family—some are my direct descendants, others are the descendants of my siblings."

"I am already over 450 years old. How much longer I live depends on fate."

Hearing this, everyone's expressions darkened.

"It's been nearly two hundred years, and not a single one of your generation has shown any hope of reaching Core Formation!"

"If any of you had even a shred of talent, would I need to groom an outsider like this?!"

At this point, the Ancestor was practically grinding his teeth in frustration.

"At any rate, I don't have much time left. Once I'm gone, what happens to the Chen Family won't be my concern. I can face our ancestors with a clear conscience—I've done my best."

"As for all of you... you know what you must do."

"Do you want to continue living in glory, or do you want to become vassals of the Nie, Feng, or Dong Families? The choice is yours."

"The Chen Family and Lin Yun rise and fall together!"

With that, the Ancestor left.

The Chen Family elders and key members exchanged glances in the hall.

Their eyes then turned to Chen Qiaoqian, and they bowed in unison. "Greetings, Family Head!"

Next, all eyes shifted to the former family head.

After a deep breath, Chen Qiaoqian's father also bowed. "Greetings, Family Head!"

The choice the Ancestor presented wasn't difficult. Anyone with half a brain would know what to do.

For those accustomed to a life of luxury, serving others would be worse than death!

As the saying goes: It's easy to go from frugality to luxury, but hard to go from luxury to frugality.

Chen Qiaoqian stood before her father, silent for a long time. Her emotions were too complex to put into words.

But she was still Chen Qiaoqian. With a composed smile, she addressed the elders.

"Uncles and elders, there's no need for such formalities. We are all part of the Chen Family. As a new family head, I know nothing and will need your guidance."

"Now, let's mobilize all our resources to gather information on these spiritual materials."

"Yes—Family Head!"

The next day, Chen Qiaoqian visited the Treasure Pavilion and purchased a talisman treasure called the Golden Light Brick and a Sky Thunder Pearl.

As a Foundation Establishment cultivator and now the head of one of the Three Great Families of the Yellow Maple Valley, buying these items was no issue.

The Treasure Pavilion's intelligence network was extensive. Before dawn, they had already learned of the Chen Family's leadership change.

A few days later, Han Li, preparing to enter the Bloody Forbidden Land, arrived at the Treasure Pavilion with two thousand-year spirit herbs in his pocket.

Though not entirely disappointed, he didn't get everything he wanted.

When he learned the Sky Thunder Pearl and talisman treasure had already been bought, his face darkened.

What an unfortunate coincidence!

But then again, Han Li thought, it wasn't so strange. He wasn't the only one preparing for the Bloody Forbidden Land. Others might have saved up spirit stones and bought equipment too.

It wasn't as if only Han Li was allowed to buy things—others could as well.

The Treasure Pavilion's items might have been purchased by other families for their own disciples.

It wasn't as if someone had specifically targeted him.

Han Li knew he wasn't important enough for that. After two years of low-profile cultivation in the valley, he had become practically invisible.

Sighing at his bad luck, Han Li didn't have time to search elsewhere. Traveling back and forth would take too long.

He could only remind himself repeatedly to be extra cautious in the Bloody Forbidden Land.

"Maybe I can buy some talismans from Brother Lin?" The thought crossed Han Li's mind. Though he hadn't gotten what he wanted, having talismans would still be a great help.

Lin Yun's previous battles, where he had unleashed a barrage of talismans, had left a deep impression on Han Li.

With that many talismans, his safety would be assured.

But another problem arose: "What can I use to pay Brother Lin?"

If he went to Lin Yun, he couldn't use the thousand-year spirit herbs as payment without revealing his secret.

The risk of exposing the small green vial was too great. Han Li decided to forget it. He would just have to be extra careful in the Bloody Forbidden Land.

With two top-grade magical tools and his usual caution—focusing only on collecting immature herbs and avoiding conflicts—he should be safe.

In the Yellow Maple Valley's main hall, Han Li stood at the back of the crowd, bored by Sect Leader Zhong Lingdao's speech. His eyes wandered until they landed on a familiar figure at the front.

Han Li's eyes widened in disbelief. He rubbed them. "Am I seeing things?"

"Is that Brother Lin? Why is he joining this Bloody Forbidden Land expedition?"

"Doesn't he already have a Foundation Establishment Pill?"

Others were equally shocked to see Lin Yun at the front.

Han Li was utterly confused. If he had a Foundation Establishment Pill like Lin Yun, he would never risk entering the Bloody Forbidden Land.

Sect Leader Zhong Lingdao knew no one was interested in his speech, so he quickly had the stewards distribute two mid-grade spirit stones and a high-grade magical tool to each participant.

Once the distribution was complete, a square-faced elder entered.

The elder appeared to be in his fifties or sixties, with graying hair but a vigorous demeanor. His stern eyes exuded authority, marking him as a man of strong character.

It was Li Huayuan, the Core Formation cultivator Lin Yun had met at the Tai Nan Small Assembly.

When Li Huayuan reached the front and saw Lin Yun among the disciples, he froze. "Did this kid get lost?! Doesn't he already have a Foundation Establishment Pill?"

In a loud voice, Li Huayuan announced, "Everyone, make sure you're in the right place. This is the team heading to the Bloody Forbidden Land!"

Though his words were directed at everyone, his gaze was fixed on one person. Everyone knew who he was really asking.

"Reporting to the Ancestor! I am in the right place," Lin Yun declared, stepping forward confidently.

"Huh? Kid, don't you already have a Foundation Establishment Pill?" Li Huayuan asked bluntly, seeing that Lin Yun wasn't taking the hint. "Why are you joining the Bloody Forbidden Land expedition?"

If not for Elder Chen mentioning that Lin Yun could now craft mid-grade talismans, he wouldn't have bothered.

"I heard that after this opening, the Bloody Forbidden Land will be sealed for sixty years. During that time, no one will be able to enter to gather herbs."

"The number of Foundation Establishment Pills the Seven Great Sects distribute is directly tied to the amount of herbs collected."

"So I've come to do my small part for the sect—to secure a few more Foundation Establishment Pills and give our fellow disciples a better chance at breaking through!"

"Whoa—" Lin Yun's words left everyone stunned.

They suddenly felt ashamed of themselves. Such selflessness!

"Brother Lin, you—" Han Li was speechless. Was this man a saint?

At that moment, Han Li could only marvel at the difference between them. This was why Lin Yun was the elder brother, and he was forever the little brother—Lin Yun had a sense of responsibility and moral courage Han Li lacked.

"This kid!" Li Huayuan was equally astonished. He hadn't expected such reasoning from Lin Yun.

Even Xiang Zhili, hiding in the crowd, couldn't help but view Lin Yun in a new light.

"Let's go—"

Since Lin Yun had made his stance clear, there was nothing more to say.

Besides, with mid-grade talismans, Lin Yun would be unmatched in the forbidden land.

"Wait a minute—"

"If no one can match him..."

"Doesn't that mean Lin Yun will collect the most herbs? Or at least a significant amount?"

"Hey—Qingxu Sect's leader must be you, right? That old Taoist Fuyunzi!"

"It must be you!"

"Fuyunzi!"

Instantly, Li Huayuan's inner gambler awoke!

No—this wasn't gambling!

Gambling is when you don't know the outcome! This was investing!

(PS: Gambling is always a scam! Treasure your life—stay away from it!)

But now, another problem troubled Li Huayuan.

What if Fuyunzi saw Lin Yun and refused to bet?
