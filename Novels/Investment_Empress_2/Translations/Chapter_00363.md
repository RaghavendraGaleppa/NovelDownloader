# Chapter 363: Who Dares Bully Our Little Princess Jiang? A New Great Sage Divine Ability?

In the small world, a bright moon hung high in the sky.

Since this section of the immortal palace scenery had been formed, Li Mo had left it untouched. The teaching area had been changed to a Yin-Yang Tai Chi arena.

The Yin-Yang Arena was at the highest point of the immortal palace, appearing serene and profound under the night sky.

"It's still a bit empty," Li Mo muttered, looking at the silent immortal palace.

The wondrous scenery and buildings he had created could be considered real, but all the living creatures were just 'special effects,' making the vast immortal palace seem cold and lifeless.

"If I encounter someone with deep destiny in the future, I might as well directly bring them into the Vast Expanse Immortal Sect. It would be much more convenient."

"Then wouldn't Little Princess Jiang become the Eldest Senior Sister?"

The thought of this made Li Mo smile involuntarily.

"Teacher, Teacher, I... I'm here."

Jiang Chulong, seeing the unfamiliar changed scenery, felt a bit timid. She carefully climbed the steps. Only when she saw the figure of the Heavenly尊 did she run over quickly.

"Teacher, today... today, are we still practicing with Senior Jinwu?"

"En,加油 (jiāyóu, add oil/go for it). There were still some issues with your last battle. You can't make the same mistakes this time..."

The Heavenly尊 didn't create battle arts; he was merely a courier of battle arts.

After explaining everything, he asked:

"Did you understand?"

"Chulong?"

The Heavenly尊 looked up and saw Jiang Chulong, who was slightly dazed and absent-minded.

*Little Princess Jiang zoning out.jpg.*

"I... I understood!" Jiang Chulong's blank little face turned red as she quickly snapped back to reality.

"What's wrong with you today? You're not in the state," the Heavenly尊 asked with a light laugh.

"The... the New Year is coming soon..." Jiang Chulong pinched the hem of her clothes and murmured softly, "Many people whose relatives went away have come back... but Big Brother Li hasn't come back to see me yet..."

The smile on the Heavenly尊' face froze. Unconsciously, a scene appeared in his mind.

At the Happy Lamb Hotpot Shop in winter, Little Princess Jiang sat on the threshold, hugging her knees, looking pitifully into the distance at other people's family reunions, happy and perfect.

Then she lowered her head and stubbornly told herself: "Big Brother Li will come back to see me..."

"......"

Li Mo's heart was wrenched.

"If you win against the Jinwu projection today, I will bring your Big Brother Li in to see you. How about that?"

The Heavenly尊 changed his voice to a gentler tone.

"!"

Jiang Chulong suddenly raised her head, her little face glowing with light again.

"Really... really?"

"En, so you must work hard."

Jiang Chulong nodded, hugged her peach blossom branch, pressed her cherry lips tightly together, and gathered all her energy.

The wind blew fiercely.

Threads of sharp aura grew wildly...

The Jinwu projection turned around, and a scorching heat rushed towards her. A sun shadow descended, pressing down on Jiang Chulong.

Jiang Chulong lightly tapped her toes, her figure swaying like duckweed. The peach blossom branch found a flaw and stabbed into the Sun耀 Golden Wheel hidden within the sunlight.

*Clang—*

The golden wheel flew back.

But Jiang Chulong didn't pursue the attack. Instead, she transformed her condensed sword intent into a sword shield, surrounding herself and穿梭穿梭 through the scorching sun.

The teacher said, let him be strong if he wants to...

Well, the Heavenly尊 teacher's words were actually very simple. Things that look powerful aren't necessarily invincible, and things that look weak might hide a sharp edge.

Jiang Chulong is clearly the latter.

"Little Princess Jiang has made great progress, and it's not just great progress, it's like she's about to explode..."

The Heavenly尊 teacher's eyes shone!

---

*Could it be!*

*Boom—*

Little Princess Jiang finally found an opportunity and burst forth. It seemed one could see through the light veil to her soft yet tenacious eyes. Even the peach blossom branch in her hand trembled violently due to the terrifying sword intent.

But the next moment, the figure of the Jinwu youth suddenly turned from solid to void.

Well.

Back then, Li Mo also thought he was about to win, but he didn't expect the Jinwu projection to have such a shameless move.

Let alone the Internal Breath Realm, even those in the Divine Observation Realm rarely have methods to deal with this kind of move that only works with the soul.

"Could this move be the origin of the Nine Suns in the Sky?"

Li Mo's thoughts drifted.

Facing the Jinwu in the Divine Observation Realm, the other party could not only turn from void to solid but also split into a clone. So, it seemed quite reasonable for the Primordial Jinwu at its peak to split into nine bodies.

*Whoosh—*

Finally, the Jinwu suddenly solidified again.

He couldn't split into clones, but by merging with the Sun耀 Golden Wheel, he seemed to hide within various dazzling lights.

The Jinwu's divine will was not just the path of the scorching sun, but also the path of light and shadow.

*Pa—*

Little Princess Jiang felt a pain in her chest and knelt to the ground powerfully, but her eyes were somewhat dazed, as if she didn't feel the pain.

She just sat there foolishly, as if her soul had been lost.

"Just a... little bit short..."

"Like this, like this... I can't see Big Brother Li."

Jiang Chulong had white smoke rising from her head, her mouth pursed, her eyes blurred.

But at this moment, a voice suddenly came from behind, very familiar.

"Who dares to bully our Little Princess Jiang!"

Little Princess Jiang's little face stiffened. She quickly wiped her eyes and turned back.

Seeing the figure holding a hammer, dressed in white, her vacant eyes regained their light.

"Big... Big Brother Li."

"The expert said you were being bullied," said Little Li, a complete bystander, looking at the Jinwu projection.

The Jinwu projection had no expression on its face.

He could speak, but he didn't have the emotions of a real living being. Otherwise, he would have turned into the power of all living beings on the spot and refused to work anymore.

*Damn, being a sparring partner every day without pay is one thing, but now I have to配合 (pèihé, cooperate with) your performance too.*

*I should never have revived.*

"It's... it's a sparring match, not... not bullying," Jiang Chulong stammered.

"Then why were you crying?"

Li Mo casually wiped the tears from her little face.

"Because... because I lost many times."

"Then Big Brother Li will help you win against him once."

"Big Brother Li is... is really amazing."

Whatever Big Brother Li said, Little Princess Jiang believed without hesitation.

Joking aside, when facing the Jinwu projection again, Li Mo still focused all his energy, silently reciting the summary Bing Tuozi had given him.

*First, you must circle around with the Jinwu, but its strongest point is often its weakest point. This holds true for many creatures.*

*Second, don't rely too much on the hammer.*

Li Mo took a deep breath.

Behind him, the Great Sage phantom slowly appeared.

If he wins this time, will the Qitian Dou Battle Intent be able to take another step up?

At that time, he would definitely be able to领悟 (lǐngwù, comprehend) another divine ability from his divine will.

What would it be?

Li Mo had some small expectations in his heart.
