# Chapter 112: Choosing a Residence and the Day of Inheritance

It was clear in Yihé Village. The moon was bright and the stars were sparse.

"So it was because of my younger brother's good fortune that I was promoted to Commander."

After leaving the inner courtyard, Li Xian finally understood the reason behind his promotion. All in all, it was a joyous occasion.

"Commander Li." Ding Hu was waiting in the outer courtyard. Upon seeing Li Xian, he hurried over.

"How is your injury?" Li Xian looked at his ankle, which was wrapped in white bandages, though blood was still slowly seeping through.

"That Huahuan Ying struck far too heavily. His internal Qi clung to the wound. Even after I stuffed herbal medicine into the claw holes, I couldn't stop the bleeding completely. I might have to use Golden Sores Powder." Ding Hu said resentfully.

Li Xian told him to lift his leg. Ding Hu was confused but complied. Li Xian brought two fingers together, pointed them at a pressure point on the leg, channeled his internal Qi into it, and then pushed and massaged with his hand.

With a "pfft," blood from Ding Hu's wound splattered out, instantly turning the white bandage red. The pain was excruciating, but he didn't dare to make a sound.

"I've forced the internal Qi out for you. Just apply the medicine as usual, and it will scab over in two days," Li Xian said.

Ding Hu was immensely grateful. He knelt on one knee and said, "I will never forget your great kindness, Commander."

"What great kindness is this?" Li Xian thought to himself. He had just assumed the position of Commander and needed help with many matters. Ding Hu was quite perceptive, so Li Xian decided to use him.

"By the way, what happened to Huahuan Ying?"

Li Xian walked through the outer courtyard. As the new Commander, he had the final say in all matters of the outer courtyard. Whether inside or outside the village, day or night, he could come and go as he pleased.

"That's exactly what I wanted to tell you," Ding Hu said, his expression strange. "After Huahuan Ying became Commander, he was arrogant and ambitious, unable to win the众's trust, and had already stirred up public anger. He attacked me first, and I fought back in self-defense. Unexpectedly, many brothers came to my aid."

"The situation spiraled out of control, and in the end... we actually beat him to death."

"Dead?" Li Xian was taken aback.

"Please punish me, Commander!" Ding Hu knelt on one knee.

Although Li Xian was the Commander, he had to act according to the rules. After a moment of thought, he said, "Huahuan Ying provoked this incident, and you fought back in self-defense. I witnessed it all. By reason, this is not your fault. But a man has died nonetheless, and a death requires punishment."

"I fine you three months' salary. After your leg injury heals, you will receive twenty strokes with the rod. Consider this matter closed."

"Thank you for your mercy, Commander!" Ding Hu couldn't help but feel overjoyed.

According to the village rules, fighting that resulted in death would lead to the废 of one's martial arts at best, and death by beating at worst.

Practitioners of the martial arts have vigorous blood and qi, and naturally possess a fierce and ruthless spirit. Peaceful coexistence and mutual affection are impossible. Therefore, the village rules do not prohibit internal strife, but they do prohibit killing.

"Right, what did you want to say at first?" Li Xian asked.

Ding Hu scratched his head, having forgotten the main business. "Oh, oh, I remember. Commander Li, you only returned to the village today. As a Commander, you naturally cannot live together with the guards."

"Your old residence is no longer suitable for a person of your stature."

"But your new courtyard has not been selected or cleaned yet. In that case, where will you stay tonight? That's why I've been unable to eat or sleep well, waiting here for you. I wanted to ask, would you be willing to stay at Commander Pang's courtyard for tonight?"

"And the arrangements for tomorrow... please let me know tonight so I can inform everyone in advance."

"You're quite thoughtful," Li Xian nodded. "I will stay at Commander Pang's courtyard for tonight. As for tomorrow's arrangements..."

"Gather in the main training yard at Maoshi (5-7 AM). I will make a brief appearance. Everything else should proceed as usual."

"Alright! I'll go and give the orders right away." Ding Hu accepted the order and immediately set off.

The village had a strict hierarchy, with layers of oppression. But this also made those of lower status hold boundless reverence for those above, treating them as gods.

Pang Long's Courtyard.

The yard was overgrown with weeds, and the house was covered in dust.

Since Pang Long's disappearance, few people had come here. Huahuan Ying, upon becoming Commander, had never visited this place either, due to his jealousy and hatred of Pang Long's favoritism towards Li Xian.

Instead, he had chosen another location as his own residence.

The village had many houses and vast lands. There were over a dozen plots of useless wasteland and barren forests. Rows and buildings of abandoned houses were also available. As a high-ranking Commander, there was no worry about food, lodging, clothing, or transport... He could pick a good place from among them.

"It's a pity about Commander Pang. He was about to 'consume the essence' but such a thing happened."

"It's a pity that several months have passed since this incident, and Huahuan Ying is already dead. Whether Commander Pang's disappearance is related to him or not, this matter can no longer be investigated."

"Let it be!"

Li Xian let out a long sigh.

Pang Long's house had a three-entry courtyard layout, with a bedroom, side rooms, a kitchen, and a bathing room. Li Xian had been here a few times but had only stayed in the outer courtyard.

Now, as he walked into the house, he realized it was not small at all.

"A mere guard commander for the Madam can live in such a courtyard. If this courtyard were moved to Qingning County, its value would be immeasurable."

"Speaking of which... in both my past and present lives, it seems I have never lived in such a courtyard."

Li Xian, full of energy, strolled around the courtyard.

In a side room, he found over a dozen types of weapons.

Knives, swords, spears, hammers, whips... everything was available. Pang Long trained diligently in the martial arts. He was not only proficient in unarmed combat but also had some attainments in various weapons.

"Shock Power Art?"

Li Xian found a book.

Shock Power Art... a basic martial art. Pang Long's practice of carrying millstones on his shoulders was precisely to train this strength technique.

"As I am now a Commander, I can freely select and practice any basic martial arts from the village."

"But... I must not focus on one and neglect the other. If there are higher-level martial arts, I should prioritize them. Basic martial arts can only be treated as a pastime and a foundation."

After touring the entire courtyard, Li Xian calmed his mind, found a spacious spot, and began to practice his martial arts.

\[Proficiency +1\]
\[Proficiency +1\]
\[Green Silk Palm\]
\[Proficiency: 20015/24000 (Perfected)\]

He practiced until late at night before finding a clean side room to rest for the night.

***

The next day.

At the second quarter of Maoshi (around 6 AM).

In the main training yard, the guards had gathered early. Ding Hu stood at the front, ordering everyone to line up neatly and keep quiet.

Li Xian had changed his attire. He wore a Commander's form-fitting uniform, looking clean and bright, with a heroic and radiant aura. Although he was young, only sixteen, his physique was already tall and imposing, with a straight back.

At this moment, a narrow sword was hanging at his left waist as he strode towards the group.

His appearance and bearing were outstanding.

It is often said that clothes make the man. Li Xian had handsome features, and the Commander's uniform, similar to a "Flying Fish Robe," made him look even more handsome and mighty.

"This is the real Commander."

"Wow, those so-called Pang Long and Huahuan Ying are simply incomparable to him."

"It's no wonder they say a dragon among men will shine wherever he goes. Commander Li is so young, yet he sits in the Commander's position. All of us, several hundred strong, will follow his orders from now on."

"That's not all. The villages and tenants below add up to even more people. Our Commander Li's words carry weight there too."

The crowd chattered away, praising Li Xian in all sorts of ways.

Zhao Han and the others had mixed feelings but also joined in with the flattering and fawning words, trying their best to praise him.

"These people are praising me to the skies right now. In reality, I was just lucky."

Li Xian remained clear-headed and did not take the flattery to heart.

He had always been straightforward in his actions.

After gathering everyone, he simply informed them of the situation, letting them know the new Commander had a new face so they wouldn't mistake him in the future.

He also gave some instructions and emphasized a few of the village's rules.

Then he dismissed the crowd, telling them to proceed with their morning training or martial arts practice as usual.

"Ding Hu, stay for a moment," Li Xian called out to Ding Hu.

"Commander Li, your orders," Ding Hu said, stepping out of the morning training formation.

Li Xian said, "Come with me to select a courtyard."

Ding Hu patted his chest, overjoyed. "Alright, alright, it's my honor to be of service to Commander Li."

The guards in the village, whether of the first, second, third, or fourth rank, were masters at saying auspicious words.

"If you choose a good one, I'll immediately send people to clean it. I guarantee it will be spotless and ready to live in within an hour!" Ding Hu patted his chest confidently.

Li Xian nodded. "I already have a place in mind. It won't take long."

When he was patrolling the village earlier, he had seen a few abandoned courtyards in the west that were quite nice.

He would choose from the west.

The west was sparsely populated, and the village's patrol routes rarely passed through this area. Because of this, the surroundings were lush with greenery, possessing a beautiful, natural scenery.

"This gentleman, ever since he became a guard, has always been solitary. It's true that he chooses to live in a quiet place."

"That's even better. Living in a remote area, other guards won't be able to find him easily. That way, I can get closer to the Commander."

Ding Hu's eyes darted around. Though he had a rough appearance, he was not short on thoughts and had his own little schemes.

"What do you think of this place?" Li Xian pointed to a courtyard.

This courtyard had been abandoned for a long time. It seemed that after it was built, not a single day had been spent living in it. The walls were covered in vines and moss, and weeds, taller than a person, had grown over the wall.

"This gentleman certainly knows how to pick a spot," Ding Hu thought to himself, a twitch at the corner of his mouth. "A person of this caliber, his眼光 is truly unique."

But upon closer inspection, there were quite a few redeeming qualities.

To the east was a serene lake, the environment quiet and peaceful. Looking up, one could see the "Tranquility Pagoda," and the unique aura of the pagoda seemed to permeate this area, giving one a sense of quietness and concentration. It felt as if staying here would make it easier to focus.

"Commander, are you sure?" Ding Hu confirmed.

"Indeed," Li Xian nodded.

"Alright!" Ding Hu hurried away.

Soon, his urging voice could be heard. "Hurry up, all of you hurry up! If the Commander has no place to stay tonight and blames us, I'll劈了 you all!"

Amidst the commotion, dozens of laborers, along with seven or eight guards, hurried over.

After paying their respects to Li Xian, they got straight to work, entering the courtyard to pull weeds, sweep dust, arrange decorations, and cut down vines.

The courtyard, both inside and out, was renewed in an instant, everything arranged meticulously and completely.

An hour later...

Li Xian's first residence was finally completed!

He took a stroll around the courtyard and was very satisfied with the beautiful scenery.

"When Commander Pang was still here, what were the main duties of the Commander position?" Li Xian asked casually.

"I don't know that either," Ding Hu recalled. "Mainly, it's listening to the Madam's orders and coordinating with us. When there's nothing to do, we patrol and guard the village as usual. If the Madam has orders, she will also dispatch us to carry out tasks in certain places."

"Alright, I understand," Li Xian nodded.

Although he had been in the village for half a year, he had only spent about two months within it. He couldn't claim to have a deep understanding, fearing there might be omissions, so he asked an extra question.

For the rest of the half-day, Li Xian had nothing to do, so he practiced martial arts in the courtyard.

\[Green Silk Palm\] was one step closer to reaching its peak.

"I wonder what kind of martial arts the Madam will teach me."

"Speaking of which, would the Madam really be this kind to me? Commander Pang was loyal for ten years, yet I've never heard that he had the fortune to learn a superior martial art."

The day of inheritance arrived in the blink of an eye.
