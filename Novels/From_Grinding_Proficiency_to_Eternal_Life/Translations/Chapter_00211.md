# Chapter 211: A Battle of Blood and Steel

The warning gong had barely sounded half a ring when Xu Yunfan’s foot tapped its surface.

The Crimson Python Coiling Mountain Strength surged through the bronze, twisting the arms of the gong-beating soldier into spirals of flesh and bone.

He vaulted over the arrow embrasures, his gaze sweeping to the brightest blaze on the slopes of the Divine Weapon Ridge. The once-imposing steel furnace was collapsing amidst the raging inferno.

Three tripwires snapped up from the shadows. Xu Yunfan twisted his waist mid-air.

The Hundred Tempered玄Steel Body activated, his abdominal muscles contracting in a spiral, forcing his body to shift three feet horizontally in mid-air. The Thunderfire Qilin Hammer swept out with the motion, shattering the fine steel chains. The rebounding iron索 snapped back, severing the ambushers lying in wait at the waist.

At the bend in the mountain path, thirty heavy halberdiers stood in formation, waiting.

Xu Yunfan snorted coldly through his nose. Crimson Python Coiling Mountain Strength flowed in massive waves from his spine to his arms, while Pure Yang Internal Energy reacted instinctively, circulating rapidly to replenish the rapidly depleting Crimson Python strength.

He released the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, letting it fly out as a chain hammer. The spinning hammer head dragged the雷纹 steel chain along—this was the "Cloud Gate Locking the Mountain" move from the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Style. When Zhan Yan demonstrated it in the rainstorm, it had leveled half an acre of bamboo forest.

The storm of metal swept through the military formation; heavy halberds snapped like wheat stalks.

Xu Yunfan pierced through the formation. As he caught the returning hammer handle, he came face-to-face with the terrified visage of a centurion.

In the dull thud of hammer meeting face, he used the momentum to leap onto the seven-zhang-high beacon tower.

Looking down at the battlefield, the scene below the Divine Weapon Ridge—or rather, the Divine Weapon Valley—ignited an uncontrollable fury within him.

A dozen or so Divine Weapon Valley disciples, using forging tables as a defensive array, were being besieged by a thousand elite black-armored soldiers.

Zhan Yan stood bare-chested, seven armor-piercing arrows embedded in his torso. The two great hammers in his hands were hacked into jagged sawtooth shapes. His upper body was covered in大大小小的 wounds, blood pooling on the ground beneath him.

Xu Yunfan’s heart clenched. Zhan Yan was likely holding on by sheer will alone.

Most horrifying was what lay at his feet: five corpses clad in mountain-pattern armor were piled into a fleshy mound. Judging by the style, they were actually generals of the fifth rank or higher of the Great乾 Dynasty. Surrounding them were many martial experts in various colored robes, lying motionless in pools of blood.

Judging by the gold thread patterns on their sleeves, they were clearly martial experts recruited by the Great乾’s "Luo Wang" network.

"Get the hell out of my way!"

Zhan Yan roared, blasting away three shield-bearing soldiers and cleaving through a light cavalryman attempting to ambush the forging furnace with his dual hammers.

However, a gap opened on his left flank. Three hook-spear wielders seized the opportunity to lock onto his knees.

It was at this moment that Xu Yunfan descended into the fray.

The moment the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer struck the ground, the terrifying power generated by the Crimson Python Coiling Mountain Strength combined with his supreme physique, splitting into nine streams and plunging into the earth’s veins.

The black-armored soldiers within a three-zhang radius suddenly stumbled; the bluestone ground beneath their feet churned like waves!

"Yunfan, why have you come here?!"

Watching Xu Yunfan charge down the mountain and into the Great乾 battle formation, Zhan Yan was both shocked and angry. Yet, an indescribable emotion surged from his chest, bringing tears to his tiger-like eyes.

"This place is a dead end! The Great乾 army and the Luo Wang martial experts have surrounded us completely. You shouldn't have come!"

Xu Yunfan swung the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer, lifting the massive weapon as if it were a stalk of grain. With effortless ease, he swept away the masses of heavy-armored troops closing in for the kill.

He looked at Zhan Yan, who was drenched in blood, his expression complex.

"Master, you..."

"This is no place for sentimental nonsense!" Zhan Yan bellowed. Although he was furious, Xu Yunfan was already here; the die was cast. Complaining now was no different than seeking death.

"Good timing, kid!" Zhan Yan deflected a lieutenant's helmet with his axe blade. "The northwest corner! I can't break away. Those bastards are about to attack the women and children!"

Xu Yunfan spun to look. Twenty strongmen wielding city-breaking hammers were assaulting a dozen or so muscular Divine Weapon Ridge disciples who were fighting desperately.

He scanned the surroundings. The thousand elite heavy-armored soldiers of the Great乾 were all martial experts comparable to those who had activated their blood essence. There were also True Blood generals watching like tigers, all experts at the Refining Flesh realm capable of igniting True Blood and爆发ing terrifying power. Although they had been forced back by Zhan Yan, they were pressing in step by step.

Not far away, Luo Wang experts lay in wait like snakes, looking for a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

And...

Xu Yunfan looked up at the mountain peak where a general sat atop a flood dragon horse, his expression cold, holding a two-zhang-long spear that was entirely pitch black.

A True Blood expert comparable to the sixth step of Transcendence, the Completed Blood Exchange stage.

He was waiting for them to be exhausted by the sea of soldiers, so he could descend and harvest their lives.

If they did not cast everything aside and flee, this was a dead end!

"Lin."

Without a hint of hesitation, Xu Yunfan formed a seal with one hand and entered the Lin character state. His muscles, previously taut with vigilance, quickly relaxed, and his bulging veins were concealed beneath, showing nothing.

In his eyes, the muscle trajectories of the twenty strongmen were visible down to the finest detail.

Suddenly, he tossed the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer into the air and grabbed the ankles of two heavy-armored soldiers.

The strength unleashed by the Hundred Tempered玄Steel Body was so great that he swung the living men around as if they were meteor hammers!

As the storm of flesh and blood overturned the city-breaking hammer formation, Xu Yunfan caught the falling Thunderfire Qilin Hammer in mid-air.

The hammer head struck a True Blood general before him. Instantly, the Crimson Python Coiling Mountain Strength transformed into a细微劲力 vibrating like a cicada's cry. The man before him was blasted into a mist of blood by the force emitted from the hammer.

"Good! Good! Good!" Zhan Yan rushed over, tearing the arrow shaft from his shoulder with a grin. "This is worthy of the Crimson Python Strength of the Divine Weapon Ridge!"

Even Zhan Yan couldn't execute such a technique.

Zhan Yan laughed, but his heart was shaken beyond measure.

How long had it been since they parted? Xu Yunfan already possessed such terrifying power.

Could he still defeat him?

The two stood their ground against the tidal enemy forces.

Xu Yunfan’s hammer style gradually reached a state of perfection. Every move contained the eighteen variations of force application from the Thousand Jun Shaking Mountain Hammer Style: a strike to the chin concealed a knee strike, a sweep of a thousand soldiers hid a grab, and even the motion of retracting the hammer carried the follow-up of a crotch kick.

The corpses of the black-armored soldiers quickly piled up into a circular wall around the stele. The True Blood generals who couldn't hold back and charged in were all crushed by him in a single blow, their deaths as easy as breaking dried twigs. Those Luo Wang martial experts hiding in the corners—some charged, and the next instant, they flew backward like rag dolls, motionless.

Suddenly, a familiar mechanical sound pierced through the clamor of battle.

Xu Yunfan’s neck hairs stood on end. In the Lin state, the Thunderfire Qilin Hammer was brought up behind his back in the "Su Qin Carrying the Sword" stance.

Three armor-piercing crossbow bolts struck the hammer face; the arrowheads were merely half an inch from his spine. This was the most insidious "Three Talents Piercing Bone Crossbow" of the Great乾 army, requiring a six-shaft strong bow to use, specifically designed to break the vital energy of martial artists.

Although he cultivated the Indestructible Body, it was best to avoid taking such hits if possible.

From the direction of the crossbows, a silver-armored general was slowly retreating.

Xu Yunfan recognized that face. Three days ago, at Luoyan Gorge in Cangzhou, it was this man who commanded the cavalry to block his retreat, leaving Tuoba Li to fight him.

His strength was barely comparable to the Refining Flesh realm, but his use of troops was vicious. A formation of a hundred soldiers had caused Xu Yunfan no small amount of trouble.

Meeting the man's slightly regretful gaze, Xu Yunfan’s eyes remained calm and波澜不惊.

Crimson Python Coiling Mountain Strength accumulated to the extreme in the arches of his feet. Xu Yunfan leaped up, stepping on the wall of corpses.
