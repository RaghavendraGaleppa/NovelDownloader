# Chapter 25: The Temptation of a Nominal Disciple?

Jiang Li originally had the "Satiated" status effect and rarely needed to eat, never expecting to encounter such an awkward situation one day.

[Consumed experimental Hard Skin Pill, diarrhea effect applied to self.]

[Diarrhea: Intestinal motility increased by 100%, digestion and absorption efficiency reduced by 70%, temporary stamina reduction of 100 points, duration three days] (-+)

Jiang Li decisively removed these two negative status effects. His suddenly pale complexion gradually returned to normal.

"How are you feeling, Junior Brother Jiang Li? You look terrible," asked "Senior Sister" Xiao Si with concern. Jiang Li waved his hand to indicate he was fine.

"I feel weak and dizzy, similar to when I lost a lot of blood from injuries before. Also, my stomach feels very uncomfortable, like I need to... relieve myself urgently."

Jiang Li described the effects and side effects of the Hard Skin Pill based on his personal experience.

After listening, the red-haired elder frowned deeply, pondered for a long time, then suddenly slapped his forehead.

"Ah! I should have realized this earlier! I should have known! Combining rehmannia root and soft aquatic thorn grass produces toxins! These two ingredients won't work—they need to be replaced with other materials for balance."

Jiang Li was speechless. Developing a pill formula was clearly extremely difficult. Spiritual ingredients inherently had multiple properties, and their interactions could produce either positive or negative effects—utterly normal occurrences.

Even if an alchemist thoroughly understood the properties of all spiritual ingredients, creating a mature and perfect pill formula would still require terrifyingly complex calculations. And how many alchemists could truly claim to understand all properties completely?

"Elder, I feel there are still some hidden flaws in this pill, though they're subtle and not very noticeable. I'm worried that if we don't identify these issues now, future modifications might fail because of them."

Jiang Li feigned hesitation, unsure whether to speak up, as he addressed the elder, who was muttering to himself while pondering the formula.

The red-haired elder paused. "Hidden flaws? If we don't address them now, they'll definitely cause problems later! What to do... what to do... if... if..."

The elder's eyes grew brighter as he fixed his gaze on Jiang Li. "Jiang Li, you have a mid-grade spiritual root, right? And dual attributes of yin and wood?"

He suddenly brought this up.

"Yes, Elder," Jiang Li replied, pretending to be clueless. In reality, he knew the elder was starting to negotiate terms for his own "pushing the limits" request.

---

"Your talent isn't inferior to that of a typical high-grade spiritual root. I'm saying... I'm willing to give you an opportunity, Jiang Li."

The red-haired elder spoke persuasively, as if the chance he offered was once-in-a-lifetime.

"What do you mean, Elder?" Jiang Li's eyes shone with anticipation, perfectly playing the role of a young man unable to resist the temptation of a "grand promise."

"If you're willing to help me complete the Hard Skin Pill formula, I'll take you on as a nominal disciple! Think about it, Jiang Li. Even though nominal disciples are still outer sect members, you'll receive my guidance and resources. No one will look down on you anymore."

"Think about it, Jiang Li. This is an opportunity many dream of."

The red-haired elder was confident he had Jiang Li hooked. What outer sect disciple could resist the temptation of becoming his nominal disciple? Especially since he was an elder of the Alchemy Hall—those fragrant pills were irresistible.

How many people would willingly risk their lives for those little round treasures?

Meanwhile, Jiang Li was rolling his eyes internally.

Nominal disciple? More like a long-term lab rat. To frame it as "for your own good" was downright nauseating.

Though Jiang Li and Yan Hong had used some rhetoric when dealing with subordinates, they had clear contracts—fair exchanges beneficial to both sides.

This red-haired elder's hair might be red, but his heart was truly black, using the promise of long-term pill testing to lure Jiang Li into becoming a frequent test subject... truly impressive.

But... wasn't this exactly what Jiang Li wanted? Otherwise, why would he have subtly hinted and lured the elder into making such an offer? All so he could openly—and passively—consume more pills.

Jiang Li deliberately quickened his breathing, pretending to be excited. "Elder! What should I do?"

"It's simple, Jiang Li. Some side effects might not be obvious with just one pill. But if you take several, they'll surely manifest! If we identify these issues early, we can refine the formula faster!"

The red-haired elder finally bared his fangs.

"No! Master! Junior Brother Jiang Li is only at the early Qi Refining stage—he won't be able to handle it!" The kind-hearted inner sect senior sister Xiao Si immediately voiced her concern for Jiang Li's well-being.

But a disciple was still a disciple. Under the elder's glare, her voice quickly faded, and she shrank back, no longer daring to speak.

---

"Jiang Li, did you know that the Nourishing Qi Pills and Replenishing Qi Pills commonly used by Qi Refining disciples weren't originally classified as low-grade Yellow Tier pills?"

After Xiao Si's interruption, the elder noticed Jiang Li's hesitant expression and changed tactics, sharing another piece of information.

"Not low-grade Yellow Tier?" Jiang Li didn't understand the elder's point but was intrigued by this piece of cultivation world trivia.

"Correct. When these formulas were first created, their effects were actually high-grade Yellow Tier—over ten times more potent than the current versions."

"Ten times?! Then why did their effects degrade so much, ending up as low-grade Yellow Tier pills?" Jiang Li was genuinely surprised. He hadn't known these basic pills had such a history.

"Because of the side effects. During the initial development, alchemists faced the same problem we're encountering now—the side effects were too severe and couldn't be eliminated. In the end, they had no choice but to reduce the potency to bring the side effects to an acceptable level, finalizing the formulas we have today."

"In fact, most pills in the cultivation world have similar histories. They all have hidden side effects, but because they're too subtle, they go unnoticed. However, if you consume large quantities of the same pill in a short time, those side effects will resurface."

As he listened, Jiang Li began to understand what the elder was getting at.

"Jiang Li, if I wanted to, I could reduce the Hard Skin Pill's effects and quickly produce a low-grade Yellow Tier formula. But if I do that, you'll lose your chance to become my disciple."

The elder sighed, as if lamenting Jiang Li's missed opportunity.

Jiang Li: ...So after all that, this is the threat? 

"The choice is yours, Jiang Li."

After pretending to hesitate, Jiang Li made a show of steeling himself. "I'm willing, Elder!"

Internally, he thought, *You didn't need to say all that—I'd have agreed anyway.*

But the elder's revelation about the secrets of alchemy in the cultivation world was valuable. It only strengthened Jiang Li's resolve to continue as a test subject—no, a "nominal disciple."

Because according to the elder, unfinished pill formulas, while having severe side effects, also had more extreme benefits. For Jiang Li, these were far more useful than the watered-down final versions.

---

"Excellent! Then continue. Once you help me complete this formula, I'll take you as my nominal disciple, and you can continue assisting me with refining other formulas in the future."

The red-haired elder was delighted. Jiang Li began picking up pills from the jade plate and popping them into his mouth.

One, two, three, four, five...

His boldness left the elder and Xiao Si stunned.

Was this outer sect disciple insane? Knowing the severe side effects, shouldn't he take them one at a time? Was he truly courting death?

[Consumed excessive experimental Hard Skin Pills. Tough Hide effect applied to self. Subcutaneous hemorrhage effect will activate after duration ends.]

[Tough Hide: Skin toughness increased by 230%, spiritual damage resistance +30, duration 45 minutes] (-+)

A 230% increase—his skin's defense had more than tripled, and he'd gained spiritual damage resistance. Now *this* was a satisfying number.

Before Jiang Li could even smile, the "hidden side effect" he'd fabricated actually manifested.

His vision blurred until even his own hands became indistinct.

[Consumed excessive experimental Hard Skin Pills. Eye Affliction effect applied to self.]

[Eye Affliction: Vision reduced by 90%, duration 3 days] (-+)

If this happened mid-battle, his enemies would die laughing.

The diarrhea and anemia effects also returned, worse than before. Fortunately, Jiang Li acted quickly—his status panel wasn't affected by his vision. A few taps on the minus signs, and after just fifteen seconds of discomfort, all negative effects vanished.

Of course, he couldn't let that show.

"Latrine! Latrine!" he cried, letting Xiao Si hurriedly escort him there.

From outside the wooden door, Xiao Si meticulously recorded his symptoms. Hearing about the vision impairment, the elder frowned deeply, seemingly caught off guard.

He pored over the formula's ingredients, determined to pinpoint the issue.

Meanwhile, Jiang Li—due to his "physical discomfort" and "impaired vision"—was personally escorted back to his outer sect dormitory by Xiao Si.

Before leaving, she handed him his payment for the day's testing: thirty spirit stones and two bottles of pills!

The moment she left, Jiang Li sprang energetically from his bed, perfectly fine.
