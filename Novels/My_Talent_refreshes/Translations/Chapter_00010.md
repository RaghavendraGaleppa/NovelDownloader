# Chapter 10: The Teaching Hall

The night passed without incident.

The next morning, after waking up, Chu Ning first practiced the Jiuyin Body Forging Technique before lighting a fire to prepare breakfast.

By the time Chu Ning finished cooking, Cao Dongxin also emerged from his room. At first glance, Cao Dongxin was slightly taken aback.

Though his cultivation wasn't particularly high, as a long-time cultivator at the fifth layer of Qi Refinement, he was sensitive to fluctuations in spiritual energy. The distinct aura Chu Ning now carried, along with the faint spiritual energy emanating from him, immediately made Cao Dongxin realize something.

"You've successfully refined Qi into your body?" Cao Dongxin's tone was complex.

Chu Ning chuckled inwardly but outwardly displayed an appropriately excited expression. "Yes, Senior Brother. Last night during my cultivation, I had a sudden breakthrough and somehow managed to refine Qi into my body."

Cao Dongxin fell silent, his eyes brimming with even more complicated emotions—chief among them, envy.

"Fifteen days... This kid refined Qi into his body in just fifteen days, even with me squeezing his cultivation time like this. Is the difference between a four-spiritual-root and a five-spiritual-root really that vast?" Cao Dongxin couldn't help but recall how he had struggled for over two months before finally succeeding in refining Qi into his body.

Comparing oneself to others only leads to frustration.

Chu Ning could clearly sense the envy in Cao Dongxin's gaze but pretended not to notice, smiling nonchalantly as he sat down to eat. 

Internally, he mused that if Cao Dongxin knew he had actually refined Qi into his body on the very first day and was now deliberately suppressing his aura, the man would likely be shocked beyond belief.

Breakfast that morning was a tasteless affair for Cao Dongxin. However, when Chu Ning mentioned his intention to visit the Teaching Hall that day, Cao Dongxin didn't object.

New disciples were allowed to visit the Teaching Hall for instruction every half-month—a rule set by the sect. No matter how much Cao Dongxin wanted to suppress Chu Ning, he didn't dare deny him this privilege.

As they stepped out of the courtyard, they coincidentally ran into Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi from the neighboring yard. This time, Qiu Shunyi wasn't trailing behind Shang Zhaoxiang but walked ahead instead.

Spotting Chu Ning, Qiu Shunyi immediately greeted him cheerfully, "Chu Ning, let's go to the Teaching Hall!"

"Seems like Qiu Shunyi succeeded in refining Qi into his body last night," Chu Ning thought to himself, about to respond when Shang Zhaoxiang suddenly smiled and said, "Junior Brother Chu, congratulations!"

Hearing this, Chu Ning realized Shang Zhaoxiang had "seen through" his cultivation level and quickly cupped his hands in acknowledgment. "Thank you, Senior Brother Shang. It was just luck."

Qiu Shunyi, still somewhat confused, asked, "Senior Brother Shang, what are you congratulating him for?"

"Naturally, for refining Qi into his body and officially stepping into the first layer of Qi Refinement, just like you," Shang Zhaoxiang replied with a smile.

Qiu Shunyi turned to Chu Ning in surprise. "Chu Ning, you refined Qi into your body too?"

Chu Ning nodded lightly. "Just luck."

Shang Zhaoxiang chuckled. "There's no such thing as luck on the path of cultivation. Junior Brother Chu has quietly surprised us all."

As he spoke, Shang Zhaoxiang couldn't help but reflect inwardly. 

"I made sure to give Shunyi ample time for cultivation, yet Junior Brother Chu managed to refine Qi into his body in the same timeframe. Either his talent is significantly better, or he's been practicing relentlessly. Since he was assigned to the Ding District, his talent is likely average. To squeeze in so much cultivation time under Cao Dongxin's oppression—he must be quite the determined individual."

Unaware of Shang Zhaoxiang's thoughts, Chu Ning simply smiled at the comment, unsure how to respond.

Meanwhile, Qiu Shunyi's earlier excitement and pride visibly dimmed. He muttered, "I was going to brag to you about refining Qi into my body, but turns out you did it too."

Previously, he had felt quite pleased with himself after Shang Zhaoxiang praised him—especially since Shang Zhaoxiang had taken a month to refine Qi into his body, while Qiu Shunyi had done it in half the time. But now, knowing Chu Ning had achieved the same, his pride deflated instantly.

After all, he knew full well that while he had been cultivating, Chu Ning had often been busy with chores.

Both Chu Ning and Shang Zhaoxiang couldn't help but smile at Qiu Shunyi's childish reaction.

After parting ways, Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin headed to the fields, while Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi made their way to the Teaching Hall.

Qiu Shunyi was straightforward by nature. Though his pride had taken a hit, he harbored no ill feelings toward Chu Ning. Along the way, he eagerly shared what he had learned from Shang Zhaoxiang.

"Senior Brother Shang told me that those who haven't refined Qi into their bodies yet will focus on asking the Teaching Hall disciples about sensing spiritual energy and refining Qi. But since we've already reached the first layer of Qi Refinement, we should ask more about spells. It's best to have them teach us basic spells first, then practice them slowly afterward. The Teaching Hall disciples have a much deeper understanding of spells than Senior Brother Shang and the others."

He then added, "Oh, Senior Brother Shang said the four spells we need to learn most right now are the Growth Spell, the Cleansing Spell, the Nourishing Rain Spell, and the Blade Spell—all for cultivating spirit plants. We should prioritize the first three, since they're needed for planting spirit fields in three months. The Blade Spell is only used during harvest."

Chu Ning committed this to memory, silently grateful for Shang Zhaoxiang's guidance and Qiu Shunyi's willingness to share. Without them, Cao Dongxin's lack of instruction would have left him stumbling in the dark.

"Shunyi, thank you for the advice," Chu Ning said sincerely.

"Thank me?" Qiu Shunyi blinked in confusion before grinning. "Ah, it's nothing. It's not like I figured it out myself."

Upon arriving at the Teaching Hall—a facility within the Hundred Arts Hall where disciples from the sect's Teaching Pavilion provided instruction—they noticed other newly arrived outer disciples gathering as well. Chu Ning observed that a small portion had already entered the Qi Refinement stage.

Inside the Teaching Hall, several teaching disciples were waiting. Upon entry, the newcomers were divided into two groups: those who had refined Qi into their bodies and those who hadn't.

As Chu Ning and the others were led away separately, the remaining disciples who hadn't succeeded yet watched with envy, murmuring among themselves.

"Refining Qi into the body in just half a month—that's barely slower than the outer disciples!"

"I heard that disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall did it in ten days! The sect took notice and said if he progresses well into mid-stage Qi Refinement, he might even be promoted to outer disciple!"

"Apparently, even though he has four spiritual roots, his earth root is much stronger than the other three. That's why he advanced so quickly."

"What a prodigy! Meanwhile, who knows when we'll manage to refine Qi into our bodies..."

Listening to these whispers, Qiu Shunyi and the others couldn't hide their delight. One broad-faced youth in particular, named Lin Yong—the very disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall they were discussing—wore an unmistakable air of pride.

Chu Ning, however, remained inconspicuous among the group. 

He quietly estimated that their group made up about one-fifth of the total newcomers, which reassured him. His "breakthrough" at this time wasn't too unusual. Any later, and he would have missed the chance to learn spells today. 

As for standing out like Lin Yong and potentially being promoted to outer disciple, Chu Ning had no such aspirations. 

With his four pseudo-spiritual roots and average test results, showing rapid progress would only invite suspicion. Until he fully understood the secrets of his spiritual body, it was best to keep his Yin Wood Spirit Body hidden to avoid unnecessary complications.
