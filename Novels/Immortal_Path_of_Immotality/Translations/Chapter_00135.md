# Chapter 134: The Void Star Compass

Lin Shan first examined the storage pouch of the Foundation Establishment youth who had been Turtle Sage's disciple. After probing it with his divine sense, he found it even less impressive than his own. 

This was understandable—after years of fleeing and battling, even the richest reserves would be depleted.

However, Turtle Sage's storage treasures were a different story. Despite heavy consumption and Black Skeleton Demon Monarch taking a portion of the materials, they were still overflowing with riches.

There were still over a hundred thousand low-grade spirit stones and more than a thousand mid-grade spirit stones—equivalent to a staggering two hundred thousand spirit stones in liquid assets! 

The remaining assortment of rare treasures was equally dazzling. Over a hundred magical artifacts of various types were piled up, likely gifts from others over the years. 

But Turtle Sage had clearly dismissed them as unworthy of attention. Only fourth-tier spiritual materials and magic treasures had earned his regard, so these miscellaneous items had been tossed aside.

Among them were the usual weapons—swords, spears, axes, hooks—but also specialized artifacts like the Water-Calming Needle, Fire-Gathering Bowl, Poison-Warding Pearl, and Water-Treading Boat. 

Three high-tier artifacts caught Lin Shan's immediate interest: a flying puppet chariot, a binding rope for capturing enemies, and a white bone banner.

After checking their effects with the Enhancement Panel:

The puppet chariot could be used for travel, powered by spirit stones for autonomous flight. While not as fast as Lin Fan's wind-element flying boat, it had unique advantages. The two horse puppets at the front and the armored puppets driving them could adjust course and evade attacks independently. The puppet soldiers could even defend the chariot, each possessing late Qi Refining stage strength.

The Demon-Binding Rope had a straightforward function: once thrown, it could restrain enemies or artifacts, making escape difficult. It was especially effective against demonic beasts, with three defensive inscriptions and one tracking inscription—a simple yet brutal control artifact.

The White Bone Banner was the most intriguing. When Lin Shan activated it, skeletal figures crawled out, staring blankly at him—unlike Black Skeleton Demon Monarch's feigned stupidity, these were genuinely mindless. 

Attempting to command them, Lin Shan found they stumbled around chaotically, unable to form any coherent formation. Without specialized divine sense control techniques, they were useless in battle.

"The first two artifacts are decent, but I'll lend the banner to Black Skeleton for now. Maybe it'll be of some use later."

Beyond artifacts, Turtle Sage had left behind a pile of broken magic treasures. Only two remained intact: a silver compass and a small azure sword.

---

"To think he still had two magic treasures left after being hunted by over a dozen Golden Core experts for three years!" 

Lin Shan was pleasantly surprised. Given Turtle Sage's desperate flight and lack of resupply, retaining even two treasures was a blessing.

(Unbeknownst to him, Turtle Sage had intended these for his disciple, not him. Lin Shan dismissed the thought—dead men told no tales.)

He first examined the silver compass with the Enhancement Panel. Exquisitely crafted, it had a magnetic needle suspended at its center, surrounded by a 360-degree dial divided into 24 sections, integrating celestial stems and earthly branches. 

**[Void Star Compass]**
- Quality: Magic Treasure
- Description: Contains 36 spell restrictions. Can survey feng shui and celestial phenomena, gather stellar energy at night, track enemies within a hundred miles, and remain unaffected by illusion arrays for precise positioning.
- Enhancement Cost: 64 points

Lin Shan fiddled with the needle, enjoying its crisp clicks. When released, it realigned northward—this world's magnetic poles were reversed from his past life, making it more of a "north-pointer."

The compass had four auxiliary functions, likely why Turtle Sage had kept it—it wasn't a combat-focused treasure.

1. **Feng Shui and Celestial Surveying**: Quickly located spiritual veins, optimal array sites, or hazardous areas.
2. **Stellar Energy Gathering**: A potent spiritual gathering array for nighttime cultivation—perfect for travel.
3. **Enemy Tracking**: Within a hundred miles, it could pinpoint targets using their residual aura, similar to the sect's supreme art, *Seven Arrows Book of Nailing*. However, while that technique could curse across any distance, this was limited to a hundred miles. Still, for a Foundation Establishment cultivator with a hundred-meter divine sense range and Golden Core experts with a mile, this was formidable.
4. **Directional Stability**: The needle always pointed north, immune to illusions or arrays—a passive ability requiring no activation.

"Too bad I can't use its full power until Golden Core. For now, it's just a fancy compass."

Next, he examined the azure sword—sleek, sharp, and clearly an offensive treasure.

**[Water-Severing Sword]**
- Quality: Magic Treasure
- Description: Water-attribute, 12 spell restrictions. Naturally repels water, splits mountains, and cleaves waves.
- Enhancement Cost: 64 points

Lin Shan sighed. This was clearly Turtle Sage's bottom-tier treasure, relegated to storage. 

Magic treasures had "spell restrictions" (法禁) instead of the "inscriptions" (铭文) on artifacts. More restrictions meant greater power and versatility. With only twelve, this sword was basic compared to the compass's thirty-six.

Still, the gap between magic treasures wasn't as vast as with artifacts. Fewer restrictions just meant fewer functions. A twelve-restriction sword focused purely on attack and durability could still hold its own in battle.

Crafting a top-tier treasure with thirty-six restrictions of a single type was nearly impossible due to material and knowledge limitations. Most Golden Core cultivators used multiple specialized treasures for versatility.

The market for magic treasures was polarized—some astronomically expensive, others dirt-cheap—but in combat, the difference wasn't insurmountable.

(Like comparing a luxury off-road vehicle to a used minivan—both could handle rough terrain, and the latter might just surprise you.)

Though Lin Shan couldn't wield the sword's full power without Golden Core cultivation, its innate sharpness could cleave through ordinary artifacts in close combat.

Next, Lin Shan searched for pills. Unsurprisingly, Turtle Sage's years on the run had exhausted consumables like pills and talismans. Defensive artifacts were also absent.

Among the remaining texts and jade slips were numerous spells and techniques, but Lin Shan wasn't interested. His *Wind-Thunder Art* was ideal, and most spells paled compared to his Five-Elements Fan.

What he needed were minor divine abilities—game-changers in decisive battles.

One jade slip stood out:

**[Water Veil Canopy]**
- Quality: Minor Divine Ability
- Description: Water-attribute defensive art. Strength and resilience increase significantly in water-rich environments.
- Enhancement Cost: 64 points

Lin Shan sighed. As a wind-thunder cultivator, he needed compatible abilities—wind, thunder, or non-elemental (like curses, soul arts, or teleportation). This water-based defense was useless to him.

"Maybe I can trade it."

Disappointed, he continued sorting. A plaque-shaped object triggered the Enhancement Panel:

**[Ancestral Tablet]**
- Quality: Sealed (Requires specific individual or power surpassing the seal's caster)
- Description: A tablet enshrining the founder of the ancient Eastern Sea holy land "Penglai Mountain," sealed by its eighth-generation master.
- Enhancement Cost: Sealed
- Ancient Aura: 22 points
- Absorb? 

"Penglai Holy Land's ancestral tablet? Never heard of it in the Eastern Sea! And it has Ancient Aura? Can tablets be enhanced? Is it a treasure? Why sealed?"

The questions swirled, but Lin Shan didn't hesitate to absorb the 22 points of Ancient Aura.

Other oddities in the collection also yielded Ancient Aura: a shrimp-man tribe's totem (4 points), a mermaid princess's tear crystal (2), an ancient shamanic torch (1)—totaling 12 points. His reserves now stood at 74!

"Thanks to Turtle Sage, I'm rich!"

These items were likely gifts from Eastern Sea factions hoping to curry favor. Ancient Aura stemmed from devout belief, varying by race and individual. The Eastern Sea's sparse, less-educated populace made this haul impressive—Turtle Sage had essentially scoured the region for him.

Finally, Lin Shan found something inspiring:

**[Golden Peachwood Seeds]**
- Quality: Tier 3 Spiritual Material
- Description: Seeds from a 3,000-year-old golden peachwood. Must be planted in water-rich, mid-tier spiritual vein locations to survive.
- Enhancement Cost: 32 points

"These must be from Turtle Sage's old haunt, Turtleshell Island's golden peachwood forest."

Likely salvaged during his escape, the seeds were meant for rebuilding—if he'd lived to reach Nascent Soul.

Lin Shan had no interest in farming, but they reminded him of the "Bean Soldier Summoning" technique learned from the Black-Red Twins.

Four seeds were millennia-old, while hundreds were centuries-old. Refined into bean soldiers, they'd yield four near-Foundation Establishment and over a hundred Qi Refining fighters. Though weaker than real cultivators, their durability made them useful cannon fodder.

After thoroughly inventorying the storage bracelet, Lin Shan reviewed the bean soldier technique—only to realize hours had passed. It was already afternoon, and he'd neglected his patrol duties.

"Damn it!"

As he rushed out, a thunderous voice boomed across the island:

"This is the Joint Enforcement Brigade—Blood River Hall's Yin Wuming! Where is this island's stationed cultivator?"

Lin Shan recognized the voice from two months prior, when he'd been assigned patrols. He hurried to greet them.

At the island's edge, over a dozen Golden Core experts and a hundred Foundation Establishment cultivators hovered.

"Black Lotus Sect envoy Lin Shan greets Protector Yin!"

Yin Wuming's first words were a rebuke:

"Why aren't you patrolling at this hour?"

The Blood River Hall protector's aura was oppressive, his face dark. With Turtle Sage's capture imminent, disobedience was intolerable.

Lin Shan's heart sank as the hundred-strong brigade stared him down. Cold sweat dripped.
