# Chapter 502: Refining the Magical Body, Forging the Divine Skies

Simultaneously, he glanced at the multiple arrays laid out around the cave dwelling—lightning attraction, spirit gathering, and protective formations.

He had already comprehended the *Introduction to Array Dao* to its perfection. To advance further, he would need to visit the Origin Sect's Dao Law Pavilion to exchange for higher-level array dao inheritances.

Such knowledge, involving the sect's foundations, naturally required a massive amount of merit points.

What troubled Xu Yunfan even more was the Origin Sect's business strategy. Those bastards had dismantled the array dao system into fragments.

Basic theories, core array pivot deconstructions, history of ancient array rune evolution...

Each had to be exchanged separately, and to actually apply them, one had to pay an astronomical price for each specific ancient array diagram.

Famous ancient marvels like the Two Elements Micro Dust and the Zhou Heaven Primordial Energy, which shook the Taihua Spirit Ruins, were likely split into nine volumes and sold separately, which would be considered generous.

Thinking of this, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but sigh at how the Origin Sect understood the way of "keeping the water flowing slowly."

They had transformed the array dao true solution, which carries the principles of heaven and earth, into monopolized knowledge commodities.

"First step: I must use the Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal to temper my body!"

After repeatedly confirming several times, Xu Yunfan finally felt at ease. The Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal was easy to obtain; whether from deep within the earth veins or drawn from the nine heavens' stars, as long as he used the array pivot to guide it, it would naturally flow continuously.

He had entered the Dao through martial arts and possessed the *True Scripture of True武 Subduing Demons* as his foundation. His physical body, even among Foundation Establishment True Persons, could be called outstanding. It was not weaker than that of Body Cultivators and might even surpass them.

As long as it didn't involve the Heavenly Ganges and Earthly Fiends of this world, the Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal was easy to handle.

The Heavenly Ganges and Earthly Fiends of this world were extremely rare, born from Heaven and Earth, and scattered everywhere. It required immense hardship to carefully collect and refine them.

Xu Yunfan formed a hand seal and pointed toward a specific pivot array plate at the ceiling of the meditation room.

The array's light suddenly brightened, and a profound spatial vortex, as if leading to the origin of the nine heavens' stars, slowly began to rotate above his head.

In an instant, a cold, sharp Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal, carrying an unstoppable intent, like a solid silver pillar of light, descended from the vortex with a roar.

*Hum!*

A piercing sharp whistle echoed within the meditation room.

Xu Yunfan's seated body trembled violently.

This was not ordinary Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal. The *Divine Skies Heavenly Canopy* true scripture emphasized tempering the body with Heavenly Metal, and under ideal conditions, it should be drawn from the nine heavens.

What he hadn't expected was that this Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal was filled with the killing intent from the core of the stars.

The next moment, as the Primordial Qi entered his body, it was like millions of tiny, incomparably sharp stellar steel needles instantly piercing his skin and flesh,钻入 his bones, bone marrow, and meridians.

Agony!

An indescribable agony swept through his entire body instantly!

This pain far exceeded ordinary body forging, as if every cell was being pricked, scraped, and reshaped by countless needle tips.

If Xu Yunfan's will, honed by countless instances of adding points to his cultivation, wasn't incredibly tenacious, and if he didn't have the strong physical foundation laid by the completion of the *Eight Scenes Cloud Manual of Profound Capital Creation* and the Eight Scenes Cloud Qi protecting his body, he would have already fainted from the pain.

Even so, Xu Yunfan couldn't help but twitch the corners of his eyes from time to time.

This tempering with Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal was naturally to transform his bone structure to be more suitable for the cultivation of the *Divine Skies Nine Courts Heavenly Canopy Indestructible True Scripture*.

Information prompts from the attribute panel flashed wildly in his vision.

> [Tempering with Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal in progress. Your bone structure is being altered.]
> [You are cultivating the *Divine Skies Nine Courts Heavenly Canopy Indestructible True Scripture*.]
> [You have gained slight insight into the *Divine Skies Nine Courts Heavenly Canopy Indestructible True Scripture*.]

Feeling the pain like ten thousand ants gnawing at his body, a pain that went straight to his soul, he let out a long breath.

He didn't necessarily have to endure it head-on.

The Eight Scenes Cloud Qi in Xu Yunfan's body instinctively began to circulate. It didn't counteract this Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal but tried to harmonize and fuse with it, like a whetstone accelerating the tempering process.

Time passed slowly amidst the agony.

When the Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal had been continuously pouring in for nearly an hour, Xu Yunfan felt his bones had turned into stellar essence gold. His internal organs had been pierced by the Primordial Qi and slowly repaired by the Eight Scenes Cloud Qi, a process that gave his organs a metallic, tough luster.

Impurities in his body were polished out like fine sand by the Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal and then scattered into ash by the protective spiritual light on his skin.

Just as his body began to feel a hint of numb adaptation to this tempering, the critical moment of body forging arrived.

"Second step: I must use the Nine Heavens' Thunderfire to temper my Golden Body!"

Without hesitation, he changed his hand seal and pointed sharply toward the core of another lightning-attracting array plate.

*Rumble-crack!!!*

Before the sound of thunder could fade, the ink-black vortex of clouds above寒鸦关 suddenly collapsed.

The Nine Heavens Divine Thunder forcibly drawn by the lightning-attracting array plate finally tore through the Nine Heavens' Gale layer, transforming into a purple-white electric dragon the thickness of an infant's arm. Carrying the majestic might that makes all evil spirits collapse, it fiercely struck the location of Xu Yunfan's cave dwelling.

A deafening explosion erupted inside the cave dwelling.

It didn't come from outside the dwelling; rather, the array plate had drawn upon the power of Divine Skies Thunder, forcibly pulling a bolt of Nine Heavens Divine Thunder, as thick as an infant's arm but incredibly condensed and carrying a majestic aura, down from the nine heavens above.

It wasn't ordinary lightning from wind and rain, but the purest thunderfire from the Nine Heavens of Divine Skies, capable of breaking evil and shattering demons, containing the power of endless creation and destruction.

The purple-white lightning instantly filled the entire meditation room, bleaching everything pale white.

Before the lightning reached him, the purifying will unique to thunderfire had already penetrated the defensive array. The lingering Yin and filthy energies in the meditation room evaporated and vanished like snow in boiling water.

The thunder pillar fiercely struck the protective shield of the defensive array on the outer layer of the dwelling. The surface of the shield instantly exploded with thousands of spiderweb-like cracks.

The thirty-six high-grade spirit stones embedded in the array plate's hub visibly turned gray and cracked. Just a few moments later, the defensive array shattered.

However, with this moment of respite, Xu Yunfan naturally wouldn't hesitate. He immediately guided the residual thunderfire and precisely poured it into his Heavenly Spirit.

His body, previously tempered by the Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal, now served as the best conductor. The thunderfire rushed along the meridians of stellar metal deep into his organs, and the紫-white electric snake exploded into a dazzling sphere of light within his chest cavity.

The pain was ten times worse than tempering with Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal.

Xu Yunfan's five viscera and six organs convulsed wildly within the thunderfire.

This Nine Heavens Thunderfire contained the pure destructive power to obliterate all things, violently colliding and fusing with the Primordial Qi of Stellar Metal in his body that had not yet fully adapted.

If the tempering with Primordial Qi hadn't already transformed his flesh into a near-conductive structure, and if the Eight Scenes Cloud Qi wasn't circulating to protect and repair him, this single strike would have been enough to shatter his Golden Body and turn his organs to ash.

Of course, most importantly, with every thunder strike, the attribute panel provided a large number of prompts regarding the proficiency gained for the Divine Skies True Scripture.

Every inch of his flesh and blood was reborn amidst scorching and tearing. His bones were tempered to emit a jade-like crystal glow, with traces of purple lightning patterns flowing within them.

The information stream on the attribute panel washed over his vision like a waterfall.

Time passed amidst extreme pain and stalemate.
