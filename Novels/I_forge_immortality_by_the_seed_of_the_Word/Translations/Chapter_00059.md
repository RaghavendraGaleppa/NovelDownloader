# Chapter 59: Private Trading Session  

"Many thanks for your mercy, Senior!"  

With Zhang Jing's assurance, Pei Xiaoshuang's eyes welled up with tears as she spoke in a trembling voice.  

At the same time, she took out the address she had prepared in advance and handed it to Zhang Jing. "This is the detailed location. You need only verify it, Senior, but be cautious of that demonic stag."  

"From this moment onward, I shall forget this matter entirely."  

"Hmm."  

Zhang Jing nodded in satisfaction before instructing, "I'll go verify it first. Return here to find me in three days."  

"Thank you, Senior. This humble woman shall take her leave now."  

Watching Pei Xiaoshuang's figure disappear into the crowd, Zhang Jing couldn't help but fall into thought.  

A moment later, he packed up the items in his shop and headed straight for the place where the spirit cranes of Langya Prefecture were kept.  

Not long after, a spirit crane carrying Zhang Jing soared into the sky, vanishing into the vast expanse.  

According to the address Pei Xiaoshuang had provided, the spiritual herbs grew in the mountains three hundred li southeast of Langya Prefecture's city—a direction completely opposite to the current battlefield where demonic creatures were wreaking havoc.  

No wonder so many cultivators had passed through Langya Prefecture recently without discovering it.  

A little over an hour later, the spirit crane let out a long cry as it began descending.  

Below lay a winding river known locally as the Black River, snaking through the mountains with turbulent waters.  

"Follow the Black River upstream to the base of a cliff with three beech trees, where the current is strongest!"  

Standing with his hands behind his back atop the crane, Zhang Jing's body radiated the distinctive spiritual energy fluctuations of a mid-stage Qi Refinement cultivator. His sharp, hawk-like gaze meticulously scanned the terrain below, searching for landmarks matching the description.  

Soon enough, his eyes lit up—he had found it.  

Under his control, the spirit crane dove downward like an arrow.  

By the beech trees, Zhang Jing dismounted and ordered the crane to wait before leaping straight off the cliff.  

A protective spiritual barrier flared to life around him, while faint ripples of water appeared beneath his feet, subtly influencing the raging currents below.  

Waves surged and crashed against the cliff face.  

With a splash, Zhang Jing plunged into the water.  

The icy-blue glow around him brightened, dazzling yet terrifying in its intensity, driving away all fish, turtles, and crustaceans in the vicinity.  

As he descended deeper, a narrow crevice just wide enough for one person suddenly came into view.  

---  

"This must be the place," Zhang Jing muttered after confirming the location.  

He produced a Concealment Talisman and activated it without hesitation.  

Moving steadily through the crevice, the water gradually receded until it disappeared entirely.  

Soon, the scene ahead unfolded before him.  

An expansive cavern stretched out, its only light source a thin crack above, thoroughly obscured by dense foliage. Luminescent spiritual herbs grew along the walls, casting a dim glow.  

A babbling stream cut through the cavern, and as the woman had described, clusters of rare spiritual herbs flourished along its banks.  

Dozens of Mist-Root Water Ginseng plants, shrouded in mist, grew along the periphery.  

His gaze involuntarily drifted toward the center.  

Tranquil Water Lotuses, Hundred-Leaf Spirit Roots, Dragon Whisker Grass—numerous high-grade spiritual herbs thrived together, their rich medicinal fragrance so potent that Zhang Jing could faintly detect it even from several li away.  

Yet he refrained from acting rashly, instead using his peripheral vision to observe the enormous white stag slumbering amidst the herbs.  

A sense of extreme danger emanated from the creature.  

"This aura far surpasses the sixth level of Qi Refinement, yet it seems just shy of the seventh level," Zhang Jing mused.  

He compared the stag's presence to that of the senior disciples he had encountered before and quickly concluded:  

This white stag was on the verge of breaking through to the late stage of Qi Refinement!  

Zhang Jing retreated slowly, careful not to make a sound or reveal even a trace of his presence.  

If he startled the stag, escaping unscathed would be difficult.  

"It seems I'll have to reconsider my approach," Zhang Jing thought with disappointment.  

Killing the stag wouldn’t be hard—he could simply purchase a few high-grade offensive talismans and hurl them at the beast, ensuring it wouldn’t even have a chance to resist.  

However, the aftermath would be disastrous.  

Not only would the stag perish, but the spiritual herbs would also be obliterated by the talismans' overwhelming power.  

Even after returning to his shop in the market, Zhang Jing remained deep in thought, his brow furrowed.  

The only solution he could think of was to enlist the help of a late-stage Qi Refinement cultivator—someone capable of either killing or driving away the stag without damaging the herbs.  

But then came the question: how would the spoils be divided?  

Offering only a tenth or two of the herbs was unrealistic. At best, a fifty-fifty split might be feasible.  

Having seen the herbs for himself, Zhang Jing no longer viewed them as mere plants.  

To him, they represented at least half of a high-grade cultivation legacy!  

---  

Just as he was lost in thought, a light knock sounded at the shop's door.  

A figure in a blue robe appeared outside.  

Zhang Jing looked up.  

"Ah, Senior Brother He! Please, come in." He rose with a smile and walked toward the entrance.  

"Haha, Junior Brother, I’ve come to bother you again," Senior Brother He said cheerfully as he stepped inside.  

"Not at all. Your visit brings me nothing but joy," Zhang Jing replied warmly.  

As they sat down, Senior Brother He grinned.  

"Your reputation has been spreading like wildfire in the market these past few days. Do you know what the lower-grade talisman masters are calling you now?"  

Before Zhang Jing could respond, he continued with a chuckle,  

"The Plague God! Hahaha!"  

His booming laughter filled the shop.  

Zhang Jing could only offer an awkward smile, unsure how to respond.  

"By the way, Junior Brother, I noticed your sign is still hanging outside. Shouldn’t it have been taken down by now? Did you get so absorbed in talisman-making that you forgot?" Senior Brother He asked with concern.  

A knowing smile crept onto Zhang Jing’s face.  

"Senior Brother, not at all. The three days I wrote on the sign referred to yesterday, today, and tomorrow. How could it be overdue?"  

Senior Brother He’s expression froze momentarily.  

After a brief silence, he gave a dry laugh.  

"Junior Brother, what an... interesting interpretation. I’ve learned something new today."  

He then produced a palm-sized bronze token covered in intricate runes, exuding an ancient aura.  

Zhang Jing studied it curiously.  

"Senior Brother, what’s this?"  

"Ah, I was entrusted to deliver this to you. It’s an invitation to a private trading session—nothing more."  

"A private trading session?"  

"Indeed. The participants are mainly alchemists, artifact forgers, talisman masters, and some high-level cultivators from our sect currently in Langya Prefecture. We hold these sessions periodically to exchange goods and knowledge."  

"Given the stir you’ve caused recently, the organizer asked me to pass this invitation along."  

"I see," Zhang Jing said, nodding in understanding.  

"You’ll find plenty of valuable items there—high-grade artifacts, pills, talismans, rare materials, and more. It’s worth checking out."  

---  

"The session begins tomorrow at dusk. The details are inscribed on the token—just probe it with your spiritual sense."  

"Now that the invitation has been delivered, I’ll take my leave."  

"Take care, Senior Brother."  

Zhang Jing saw him to the door before examining the token with his spiritual sense.  

A message surfaced instantly:  

"Tomorrow at dusk—South City’s Hidden Fragrance Pavilion!"
