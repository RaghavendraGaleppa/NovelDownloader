# Chapter 51: Obtaining the Spirit Wood, Sudden Turn of Events

Hearing the familiar name, Gu Yuan couldn't help but smile slightly.  

The Green Crane Spirit Water had been one of the opportunities that helped him get his start. He hadn't expected to see it auctioned here as well.  

"Two hundred and fifty spirit stones!"  

High-grade spirit water was a precious commodity no matter where it appeared, and soon, numerous voices joined in the bidding. This marked the beginning of the auction.  

In the end, it was sold for two hundred and eighty spirit stones to a distant private booth.  

"Jade Void Pills—cultivation pills effective for those below the seventh level of Qi Refinement. Each pill can enhance a month's worth of cultivation with minimal side effects. Thirty-six pills available, starting bid: one hundred and fifty spirit stones!"  

"Purple Sun Dew, aged one hundred and fifty years. Starting bid: one hundred and sixty spirit stones."  

"Crimson Flame Essence, a rare flame used to refine True Fire Seals. Starting bid: two hundred spirit stones!"  

The auction was lively, with all sorts of rare treasures on display. The bidding was fierce, and even Gu Yuan felt a pang of envy.  

But after feeling the weight of his spirit stones, he could only sigh helplessly.  

He had thought himself relatively wealthy, but now it seemed he was still a pauper!  

"The next item up for auction is quite extraordinary. If you have need of it, don't miss this chance!"  

At that moment, the middle-aged auctioneer cleared his throat and announced loudly.  

"Fire-Eye Pills! Refined from the eyes of a high-grade Water-Fire Ape. Consuming one can resist the Fire-Eye Technique of a Water-Fire Ape below the Foundation Establishment stage."  

"Take note—this pill cannot be consumed immediately. It must be taken under the scorching sun, aided by fiery qi. Starting bid: two hundred and seventy spirit stones!"  

"Three hundred spirit stones!"  

As soon as the auctioneer finished speaking, a bid came from one of the private booths.  

"Three hundred and ten spirit stones!"  

"Three hundred and twenty!"  

The calls came one after another, even more fervent than before, and the bidders all seemed to be wealthy, competing fiercely for the pill.  

"Fire-Eye Pills... To think they'd appear at an auction. It seems this was prepared specifically for the disciples of the Dao Academy..."  

Listening to the heated bidding, Gu Yuan couldn't help but sigh.  

The Water-Fire Ape was a powerful beast native to the Scarlet Moon Great River. Its most formidable innate abilities were twofold: first, its water manipulation, which enhanced its strength by thirty percent when near the river.  

Second, its unique Fire-Eye Technique.  

The Water-Fire Ape possessed golden pupils capable of seeing through illusions and tracking hidden targets. Moreover, its gaze was as sharp as the blazing sun. In battle, when fully activated, its eyes could unleash a fiery light—capable of blinding enemies or even burning their spiritual senses, reducing them to mindless husks.  

Even those who had consumed supreme-grade spirit water would struggle to resist.  

This technique was the Water-Fire Ape's greatest weapon, allowing it to dominate the Great River.  

Conventional seals and magical artifacts were ineffective against it. Only the Fire-Eye Pills, refined from the ape's own eyes after death, could counter the technique.  

In essence, only the ape itself could resist its own power.  

For this reason, Water-Fire Apes were extremely cautious. Few died outside their territory, lest their eyes be harvested. If faced with certain defeat, they would self-destruct their eyes rather than leave them for enemies.  

As a powerful demonic clan, few dared venture into the Scarlet Moon Great River to hunt them, making Fire-Eye Pills exceedingly rare in the market.  

But now... it seemed the Azure Peak Dao Academy was preparing to take action against the Water-Fire Ape clan, and specialized treasures like these were appearing in response.  

This was the perfect time to strike.  

"Three hundred and ninety spirit stones!"  

"Four hundred and ten spirit stones!"  

The bidding grew even fiercer, and in the end, the central private booth secured the pills for four hundred and ten spirit stones.  

The price left Gu Yuan speechless.  

For most ninth-level Qi Refinement cultivators, this sum would take a year or two to accumulate—enough to purchase a lower-tier supreme-grade artifact.  

Yet such a restrictive pill could fetch such a price, a clear sign of its inflated value.  

"It must have been bought by a scion of one of the academy's noble families, preparing for the future. What a pity... I'm too poor to compete!"  

Gu Yuan sighed as he watched the crimson pill being carried away.  

If possible, he would have liked to bid, but his pockets simply weren't deep enough.  

Compared to the wealth of noble families, Gu Yuan's resources were meager.  

The auction continued.  

The Fire-Eye Pills had been a minor climax, and though the following items were still valuable, the bidding was noticeably less intense.  

Even so, Gu Yuan watched with great interest.  

Even without the means to bid, observing the competition was entertaining. Many of the rare items on display were things he had only read about in the academy's archives—today was an eye-opening experience.  

"Sapling of the Minor Titanwood—a first-grade, high-tier spirit wood. Once matured, it can be used to craft superior seals or artifacts. Starting bid: two hundred and fifty spirit stones!"  

The auctioneer tapped his jade gavel lightly and announced in a booming voice.  

At last, the moment had arrived!  

Gu Yuan immediately perked up.  

The Minor Titanwood was a precious material for refining secret seals, body seals, and even supreme-grade artifacts. However, since it was still a sapling, it required significant cultivation time before use, which kept the starting bid relatively low.  

This was good news for Gu Yuan. He promptly called out,  

"Two hundred and seventy spirit stones!"  

"Two hundred and eighty!"  

But as soon as he spoke, another bid came from a different booth.  

"Three hundred and thirty!"  

Without hesitation, Gu Yuan raised the bid sharply, hoping to intimidate other bidders.  

"Three hundred and forty!"  

Someone immediately countered.  

Gu Yuan had no choice but to keep increasing the offer. In moments, the price breached the four hundred mark.  

At this point, the price matched that of fully grown Titanwood. The auctioneer's smile widened.  

Gu Yuan's expression darkened.  

He had expected competition, but not to this extent. The price had skyrocketed by a hundred and fifty spirit stones in moments.  

"It seems the gains from the Thunderclap Mountain Range's strength seals were even greater than I thought."  

He sighed inwardly but raised his hand again.  

The Minor Titanwood was crucial to his talent and cultivation—he could not afford to lose it.  

Though his storage pouch only held four hundred spirit stones, he still had several high-grade artifacts. Even if he had to sell one, he would secure the wood.  

"Four hundred and eighty!"  

After his decisive bid, no further counters came.  

At this price, one could purchase a powerful supreme-grade artifact. Even disciples of the Falling Clouds Sect withdrew.  

Gu Yuan had finally obtained the spirit wood he desired—but at a steep cost.  

Not only had he exhausted all his spirit stones, but he had also sold a high-grade artifact, the Seven Mysteries Mirror.  

Now, aside from the supreme-grade Eight Winds Ring bestowed by the Elder, Gu Yuan only had five artifacts left:  

The supreme-grade Purple Lightning Chisel and high-grade Soulguard Bell from Lan Tianlu, the supreme-grade Three Decays Mirror and high-grade Cloudmist Robe obtained from Kuang Mingsheng, and the Jade Serpent Shuttle.  

At this thought, he felt slightly better.  

Once the transaction was complete, the auction drew to a close.  

Gu Yuan didn't linger. He summoned the Jade Serpent Shuttle and set off for the Azure Peak Dao Academy, eager to plant the spirit wood and advance his cultivation.  

For caution's sake, he didn't push the shuttle to full speed. Instead, he held the Void-Treading Jade and flew leisurely toward the academy in stealth mode.  

But an hour into his journey, as he passed through a secluded stretch of water between Moon Bamboo Market and the Nine Rivers Marsh—  

Disaster struck.  

An invisible barrier suddenly rose from the water, enveloping Gu Yuan.
