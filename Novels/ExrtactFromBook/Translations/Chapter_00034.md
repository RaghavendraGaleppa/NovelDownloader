# Chapter 34: Explosive Wealth Growth

Time passed as one talismanic character after another was refined.  

Xiao Luo's complexion grew increasingly pale!  

The runes of the *Soul Refinement Pact* were forged using a cultivator's soul energy, blood essence, and mana as the foundation, condensed through sheer willpower.  

For Xiao Luo, the burden was considerable!  

Yet, the results were equally remarkable!  

The runes refined by the *Crimson-Horned Python* all converged into its sea of consciousness, gradually assembling together.  

One by one, the runes formed a circular ring, taking root firmly within its mind.  

Slowly, the python's mana began to be drawn toward the ring, flowing automatically into the sea of consciousness.  

Once this mana passed through the runic circle, its very nature was instantly altered!  

The *Crimson-Horned Python*'s mana was completely transformed into Xiao Luo's own, settling within her sea of consciousness as a brand-new seed of power!  

With the birth of this mana, Xiao Luo felt an unbreakable connection form between herself and the *Crimson-Horned Python*!  

At this point, the initial refinement of the *Soul Refinement Pact* was complete!  

What followed would be a long, meticulous tempering process between Xiao Luo and the python.  

Only when all of the *Crimson-Horned Python*'s mana had been refined into Xiao Luo's own would the *Soul Refinement Pact* reach its full potential.  

By then, their mana would be fully synchronized, granting Xiao Luo the support of a second-grade great demonic beast!  

The python's mana, physique, and supernatural abilities would all fall under her absolute control—an immense boon for both her cultivation and physical refinement!  

This was an exceptionally profound technique!  

Once the initial refinement was complete, Xiao Luo emerged from seclusion.  

In a flash, she appeared atop the mountain peak, tearing off a large piece of roasted beef from the grill and devouring it ravenously.  

"Pao Pao! Your grilling skills far surpass your monster-slaying abilities!"  

Han Yue ignored the jest and instead asked, "Xiao Luo, when are you leaving?"  

"Within a day or two. I've achieved all the goals of this journey."  

"Before my breakthrough, what remains is just steady refinement—something I'll need to return to the sect for."  

"So next time we meet, you'll be an exalted third-grade master?" Han Yue remarked.  

"Hahaha, I appreciate the good wishes!"  

"But this refinement process will take decades at best. If things don't go smoothly, a century wouldn't be unusual."  

"If I can reach the third-grade Nascent Soul realm before turning a hundred, I'll already be among the elite of my generation's true disciples!"  

"How old are you, Xiao Luo?"  

"For us cultivators, those who fail to attain immortality are mere ants. Though I've advanced further than you and am a few years older, it means nothing without achieving eternal life."  

"Alright, if you don’t want to say, I won’t pry."  

The two laughed and bantered for a while before Han Yue handed Xiao Luo two corpse-storing pouches—one large, one small—along with three hundred mid-grade spirit stones.  

"Here’s the final transaction. Count it if you like."  

Xiao Luo accepted the stones with a bright smile.  

"Honestly, Pao Pao, you’re my destined benefactor. I never imagined I’d amass over twenty thousand mid-grade spirit stones in just a year!"  

"With this windfall, I can exchange for the third-grade treasures I need back at the sect, and still have enough left to support my entire journey to the third grade."  

"I dare say I’m now among the top three wealthiest of the Beast Taming Sect’s twenty-four true disciples!"  

"Without your help, even after refining the *Crimson-Horned Python*, I’d have spent years scraping together resources for my advancement."  

"You flatter me," Han Yue replied. "This was a fair partnership. Without you, I couldn’t have hunted so many demonic beasts in such a short time."  

Indeed, in just one year, not only had Xiao Luo struck it rich, but Han Yue had also accumulated wealth beyond his wildest dreams.  

He had meticulous records of all transactions with the merchant guild.  

Over the year, the duo had slain a total of 1,346 second-grade demonic beasts, earning over 6.5 million merchant coins.  

Xiao Luo took less than a third of the profits—yet even that left her immensely satisfied.  

The remaining four million-plus coins belonged solely to Han Yue, far exceeding what he needed for his own third-grade breakthrough.  

In terms of personal wealth, Han Yue now stood unrivaled in Fenrouji!  

His efforts alone had boosted the merchant guild’s annual revenue by 30%, further solidifying his influence.  

At the upcoming guild assembly, he was certain to reap significant rewards.  

Xiao Luo shook her head at Han Yue’s modesty.  

"Plenty of cultivators can kill demonic beasts. Any of our sect’s twenty-four true disciples could’ve partnered with you."  

"But your teleportation ability? That’s irreplaceable."  

"I’ll definitely miss these days of raking in riches!"  

"Unless I reach the third grade and start dealing in high-tier resources, I’ll never make money this fast again."  

Her words were heartfelt.  

"Then why not stay?" Han Yue suggested. "We could keep at it for a few more years."  

"Now that you don’t need to guard the *Crimson-Horned Python*, we can range farther. We’ve nearly wiped out the second-grade beasts nearby."  

"If a year’s too long, how about six months?"  

"Fenrouji’s next assembly is in half a year—it’ll have plenty of third-grade items. Why not attend before leaving?"  

Tempted as she was, Xiao Luo resisted greed’s pull.  

"My next step requires the sect’s secret techniques and facilities. Every day I linger outside is wasted time."  

"Besides, I’ve already secured my advancement funds. Wealth is good, but not at the cost of cultivation."  

"Pao Pao, a word of advice: Excess is ruinous. Don’t lose yourself to desire—focus on your path."  

"And if you ever obtain third-grade materials, prioritize unrefined ones. This affects your future progress—be extremely cautious."  

"Understood. Thanks for the guidance."  

Xiao Luo then produced three jade talismans carved in the shape of dragons and handed them to Han Yue.  

"These are our sect’s exclusive tokens, granted only by true disciples."  

"Each disciple receives just one per decade. These are my last three—I’m giving them all to you."  

"With these, you’ll have free passage throughout Guizhou and direct entry into the Beast Taming Sect as an inner disciple."  

"If you ever decide to join us, bring one to me."  

Han Yue accepted the tokens solemnly, storing them safely within his *Silver Hairpin*.
