# Chapter 103: Aurora Magnetic Sea

By the shore of an azure lake, Zhang Jing sat cross-legged, his gaze fixed intently on the calm water surface, a trace of doubt flickering in his eyes.

The lake wasn't large—only about a hundred zhang in diameter. It had taken him but a short while to thoroughly examine every inch of it—the shores, the lakebed, even the water itself. Yet, to his disappointment, Zhang Jing found nothing unusual.

Only the strange reaction from his Heart's Eye Dao Seed persistently reminded him that this place wasn't as simple as it appeared.

"Could it be that what's causing the Dao Seed's reaction is the lake itself, rather than something within it?" Zhang Jing mused silently. At this point, that seemed the only plausible explanation.

But how could a mere lake—

His thoughts were interrupted as he recalled Ying Daren's earlier words—words the being had struggled to articulate before ultimately giving up with resignation. "Could this be part of the great secret hidden within the Ten Thousand Spirits Minor Void Heaven?" Zhang Jing wasn't certain, but he felt an inexplicable intuition that this lake triggering his Dao Seed's reaction was of tremendous importance.

Resolute in following his instincts, determination flashed in Zhang Jing's eyes. If one hour wasn't enough, he'd spend two. One day insufficient? Then two. Ten days? Then twenty. Of course, if he truly gained nothing after all that, he wouldn't waste all his time here. That wouldn't be determination or persistence—it would be foolishness.

"Two months," Zhang Jing decided. "If I still can't uncover the lake's secret after two months, I'll leave immediately."

Considering both the rate of spiritual essence accumulation in this upper-tier Void Heaven and his current progress in comprehending the Lunar Dragon Serpent Dao Intent (as shown by his jade talisman), Zhang Jing estimated he could afford to spend at most two months here. Any longer, and he might fail to fully comprehend the Dao Intent—an unacceptable outcome.

Having made his decision, Zhang Jing cleared his mind of all distractions.

As time passed, the initial unease and doubt about this uncertain endeavor faded from his heart, along with any impatience to quickly find answers. What remained was boundless tranquility.

Finding a comfortable spot, Zhang Jing fixed his gaze on the lake's mirror-like surface, his eyes gradually becoming as still as ancient well water.

The first day yielded nothing. The second day was the same.

On the fifth day, Senior Brother Qiu came looking for him. Seeing Zhang Jing staring motionlessly at the lake, Qiu Xiujun feared something was wrong.

"Junior Brother, what's the matter with you?" Qiu Xiujun asked anxiously.

Zhang Jing was the Pavilion Master and Senior Brother You's designated successor as Inner Court Chief. If anything happened to him—especially after Qiu Xiujun had personally recommended he come here—how could he ever face the Pavilion Master and Senior Brother You after leaving the Void Heaven?

"Senior Brother, I'm fine—just admiring the scenery," Zhang Jing replied calmly.

"Are you truly alright?" Qiu Xiujun asked skeptically, for Zhang Jing didn't look fine at all.

"I swear by my Dao heart, I'm perfectly fine," Zhang Jing said with a faint smile, though his eyes remained serene.

Relieved, Qiu Xiujun exhaled deeply. "Good, that's good! Then when do you plan to return?"

"I'm not certain—perhaps in a few days, perhaps a month or two," Zhang Jing answered honestly.

Seeing his junior brother's resolute attitude, Qiu Xiujun could only bid farewell. "Then I'll take my leave. Take care, Junior Brother."

"Safe travels, Senior Brother."

On the third day, heavy rain fell, creating ripples upon the lake's surface. Zhang Jing found it beautiful, though still gained no insights.

By the tenth day, dust storms swept through. The fifteenth day came and went.

---

The Sixth Void Heaven was a paradoxical place—vast enough that mortals might never traverse it in a lifetime, yet small enough that to the Inner Court disciples dwelling there, it felt like a tiny village. News traveled quickly between the three ostensibly separate factions.

Gradually, everyone learned that Zhang Jing, that prodigy from Dragon Lake Dao Academy, seemed to have lost his mind in cultivation—doing nothing all day but stare at that worthless lake.

At first, they suspected the lake held some profound secret. Why else would a genius like Zhang Jing fixate on it? But after waves of disciples thoroughly inspected it, all concluded: the lake wasn't special—the problem lay with the man himself.

Reactions varied—some sighed regretfully, others mourned, while a few mocked. None took it harder than Qiu Xiujun, who deeply regretted recommending Zhang Jing to Senior Brother Qi in the first place. Now this promising junior brother had cultivation problems.

Qiu Xiujun began visiting every few days, hoping Zhang Jing would at least remain stable until the Void Heaven closed. Perhaps he'd recover afterward—after all, their current bodies weren't their real ones. At worst, maybe the Academy Master or Pavilion Masters could help. Given Zhang Jing's talent, Qiu Xiujun doubted they'd stand idly by.

By the twentieth day, Zhang Jing felt himself gradually merging with the azure lake before him. The scenery began to transform.

In his vision, the lake's surface shimmered with countless radiant colors. Then the lake rapidly expanded—devouring the land, enveloping the sky. No—that wasn't quite accurate. Rather, the azure lake was finally revealing its true form.

It wasn't a lake at all, but a vast sea more expansive than worlds. Its surface glittered with dazzling auroras of divine light, while its waters contained every conceivable metal—common, celestial, elemental, yin-yang aligned. If a metal existed, it could be found there.

A name surfaced in Zhang Jing's mind: Aurora Magnetic Sea.

Just as he prepared to study it closely, the vision began fading rapidly. Once again, he saw only the ordinary azure lake, as if it had all been an illusion. Try as he might, he couldn't reenter that state.

His illusory jade talisman manifested:

[Aurora Magnetic Sea (Cannot be upgraded)]

"Why 'cannot be upgraded' when the talisman already recorded it?" Zhang Jing wondered. Then understanding came.

The Aurora Magnetic Sea's level was simply too high. Due to Zhang Jing's current cultivation, the talisman couldn't forcibly upgrade his comprehension. If he could comprehend it naturally, however, this restriction wouldn't apply.

Comprehend it himself? Zhang Jing shook his head—he'd already tried and failed. This brought back Ying Daren's words about "fate."

"Could it be that I actually lack any innate connection to the Aurora Magnetic Sea, and only glimpsed it through the talisman's intervention?" Zhang Jing guessed, feeling this was likely the case.

---

Deep within the Ten Thousand Spirits Minor Void Heaven, sighs echoed.

"What a pity! The affinity was too weak—he failed to comprehend the Aurora Magnetic Sea after all."

"Indeed, to miss the path to Celestial Immortality by such a narrow margin..."

"Narrow? Fate is absolute—what seems a small gap might as well be heaven and earth."

"Speaking of which, in the 1,972nd Ten Thousand Spirits Minor Void Heaven, a youngster successfully grasped a trace of its true meaning. The Upper Origin Azure Scenery Cave Heaven is already preparing to send envoys to the lower realm to retrieve him."

At this, the beings fell silent, as if "Upper Origin Azure Scenery Cave Heaven"—or perhaps "Cave Heaven" itself—held some extraordinary significance.
