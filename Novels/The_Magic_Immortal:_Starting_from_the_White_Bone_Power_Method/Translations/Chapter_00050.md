# Chapter 50: The Black Breath Bone Curse

The moonlit riverbank lay hidden within a bend, surrounded by dark forests thick with mist—an extremely secluded spot. Pale gray stones exposed along the shore reflected the cold light. 

This was a convergence point of yin energy. A sinister wind blew from afar, gathering endless yin qi that intertwined with the forest's miasma, giving rise to clusters of eerie white will-o'-the-wisps. These ghostly flames scattered about in various forms, some emitting faint hissing sounds, as if harboring spirits within.

Upon a large, millstone-like gray boulder, two figures were entwined. The male cultivator in black ignored the ominous surroundings, speaking to the white-robed female cultivator as if coaxing a child, his arm around her shoulders in a familiar manner.

"Auntie, let's not complicate matters. We've paid no small price for this opportunity at the black market auction. If we miss the timing, we'll lose our chance at the Soul Bell."

The white-robed woman had peach-blossom eyes. Though faint traces of age marked her face, her delicate nose and charming expression remained captivating. Hearing his words, she broke free from his embrace with a low, coquettish rebuke:

"Complicate matters? A mere early-stage Qi Refining cultivator—likely some lowly rogue—dared to lay eyes on my body. How can we let him off?"

"He stumbled upon us by accident..."

"So what? Who told him to walk by the river instead of taking the mountain path?"

"Auntie... this is the Darkwood Mountains. Though he's only an early-stage cultivator, anyone who comes here alone must have some means of protection. Caution is the parent of safety..."

"Zhou Zhixuan!" The woman's face twisted in anger as she pointed at him. "I never realized you were such a coward!"

"Auntie, I—"

"Tch. So timid now... Weren't you bold enough to sneak into my chambers right after talking to your Ninth Uncle, forcing that scripture from my bosom?"

The man's face flushed with shame. With gritted teeth, he slapped his storage pouch and summoned a Water-Avoiding Shuttle. "Fine! I'll go back and kill him, then pluck out his eyes for you!"

"Giggle!" The woman immediately clung to his arm, her anger melting into delight. "Good boy, I haven't spoiled you for nothing. But there's no need for you to fight—I have my own methods."

"Could it be...?" The man's eyes lit up.

"Hmph. If I hadn't mastered the Black Breath Bone Curse, would I have risked leaving the city to accompany you to this wilderness black market?" The woman smirked coldly.

"Rumor has it this curse can seep into a victim's body without trace—no form, no sound, no aura. Once it latches onto their spiritual bones, their life is in your hands... Auntie's talent is truly peerless to master such an unstoppable technique."

"Sweet talker." The woman preened at his flattery. "No technique is truly invincible, but this curse is formless and sinister. Once cast, it can kill or control at will—ordinary defenses are useless against it."

"Then hurry and cast it to end that man's life." The man urged eagerly.

"Impatient as always." The woman remained unhurried. "Once the curse takes hold, his life is mine. Even if he uses sealing techniques to suppress it, he'll only delay the inevitable—unless..."

"Unless what?"

"Unless he happens to cultivate extremely yang-aligned purification arts or possesses the rare lightning-attribute sealing techniques." She hesitated, then added honestly, not wishing to sow discord between them.

"That could break the curse?"

"Not only break it—it would backlash against me."

"Then perhaps we should leave it be..." The man wavered.

"Zhixuan, you're only bold when bullying me..." She pouted. "I sensed yin-aligned energy from that man. He couldn't possibly know yang purification arts. As for lightning sealing techniques? Even inner disciples of the seven great sects rarely master those."

Glancing at the sky, she took a deep breath. "It's time. I'll activate the curse now. Since that bastard came to the black market with those spirit daggers, he must have resources worth taking. We'll add them to our funds for the Soul Bell auction."

"I'll stand guard." The man reluctantly agreed.

Nodding, the woman took out a mid-grade protective talisman and activated it before sitting cross-legged. The man nervously scanned their surroundings before producing a golden talisman—his only one—and sticking it to her back without hesitation.

Golden light erupted, forming armor around her body. He then activated his own protective talisman and gripped a black scissors artifact in his left hand while holding the Water-Avoiding Shuttle in his right.

"Zhixuan, this Golden Armor Talisman was hard to obtain. You only have one—"

"This is the wilderness—better safe than sorry." He said tenderly. "You'll be vulnerable while controlling the curse. If anything happened to you, I could never forgive myself."

"Good boy." This time she accepted his concern. "Don't worry—if the curse resists, I won't force it. We'll retreat immediately with the shuttle."

"Wise plan." He agreed.

Suddenly remembering something, she produced nine formation flags and a formation plate. "You know how to set up this Profound Water Return Formation. Though low-grade, near the river it can withstand mid-grade attacks. Set it up quickly while I begin."

"Such thorough preparation..." He marveled.

"Hmph, I was fighting battles when you were still wetting the bed!" She teased before closing her eyes.

Within moments, she began chanting, hands forming seals as dark energy swirled around her, coalescing into a giant black spider phantom reeking of decay.

Meanwhile, the man scanned the area with his spiritual sense, planting the flags in nine positions. As he spat blood essence onto the formation plate to activate it, a dark wave suddenly surged toward them.

Ready, he flicked the black scissors—it sliced the wave apart while his shuttle erected a water-blue barrier. 

Just as he sighed in relief— 

"Gah!" 

The spider phantom shattered as the woman vomited blood, collapsing unconscious. 

"Auntie!" He cried out.

In that moment of distraction, four white lightning needles materialized with a shrill whistle. 

*Ting!* The first cracked his barrier.  
*Ting!* The second shattered it with thunderous force.  
*Ting!* The third destroyed his talisman, sending him staggering—  

"Pcht!"  

The fourth pierced his forehead.  

A bloody hole appeared.  

The corpse toppled.
