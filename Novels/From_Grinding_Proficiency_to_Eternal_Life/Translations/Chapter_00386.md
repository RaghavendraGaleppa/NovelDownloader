# Chapter 386: What is Martial Way?

The opponent moved with effortless grace, summoning the power of the heavens and earth. Spiritual energy gathered like a hundred rivers returning to the sea, transforming into a violent torrent of attacks.

Gale winds condensed into blades, earth veins formed cages, and even the clouds in the sky twisted into sharp edges capable of tearing through space. Such techniques that wield the terrain of the heavens and earth as weapons were no longer within the realm of mortal martial arts!

Xu Yunfan’s eyes burned with fighting spirit. Instead of retreating, he took a step forward.

A martial artist must be brave and forge ahead, especially at this moment. If he harbored any thought of retreat, he would fall into an absolute disadvantage.

As his twin hammers collided, the *Shan Yue Zhen Hai Hammer* suddenly erupted with blinding golden light. The Ten Extremities True Qi wrapped around the hammer shafts coalesced into nine scarlet-gold dragon patterns, their scales and claws vivid and lifelike.

As he spun and swung the hammers, the nine dragon patterns let out a deafening roar that sounded like thunder, causing the surrounding air to distort.

Wherever the hammer edges passed, the sky was torn open, creating a white shockwave like a rip in the heavens’ fabric. A visible shockwave swept out in a fan shape.

*Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall: Heaven’s Collapse!*

The twin hammers struck across the air. Before the force of the hammers even arrived, the immense pressure caused the ground to crack inch by inch.

The nine scarlet-gold dragon patterns flew out from the hammers, transforming into a destructive torrent. Wherever they passed, clouds and mist collapsed, and even light was briefly swallowed. It seemed as if this single strike truly intended to overturn the heavens!

*Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall: Heaven’s Collapse!*

The moment the hammer edge collided with the giant palm print, the sky of the secret realm was torn open a thousand-zhang-long fissure.

The pure collision of force generated a ring-shaped shockwave that flattened the mountains within a radius of ten miles. Xu Yunfan’s feet sank deep into the ground up to his knees, but then the dragon patterns on the hammers suddenly writhed like living things, forcibly grinding the palm print—laden with the power of heaven and earth—to pieces!

“A fine job of forging the body with Mountain Soul!”

Divine Martial True Person’s eyes flashed with brilliance. “To break my spiritual imprint with brute force alone! With this strike, you can be considered the number one person below the Foundation Establishment realm!”

He was both surprised and awed. “I didn’t expect you to walk the path of ‘Ten Thousand Laws Return to the Flow, Hundred Scriptures Return to One’.”

Before the words faded, his sleeves fluttered, and his five fingers tapped the void as if plucking a zither string.

With every tap, a bolt of purple lightning fell, forming a Thunder Prison Great Array that covered the sky in an instant. These thunderbolts were not ordinary lightning; each carried a strange “Dao Charm” and left behind long-lasting scorch marks in the void as they struck.

“Although I have fallen from the Foundation Establishment realm, I was once a Foundation Establishment True Person. Some of my methods are not something you fellows below Foundation Establishment can compare to.”

Divine Martial True Person said calmly, “If you let go of your body and mind and accept my soul entering your body, if I attain the Golden Core True Lord in the future, I can separate your consciousness and guide you onto the Immortal Path, rather than being trapped in the Way of Martial Arts. How about it?”

“Kill you, and I will be the number one person on the Martial Dao.”

Xu Yunfan let out a long cry, his body spinning rapidly like a top. The *Shan Yue Zhen Hai Hammer* was wielded like a golden wheel, displaying the realm of hammer technique entering the micro-level to the extreme.

The earth veins trembled with dark light, giving the heavy hammers a weight of ten thousand jun. Yet, in his hands, they were as light as a feather. Every swing accurately deflected a purple lightning bolt. The deflected lightning struck a distant mountain, instantly vaporizing the entire peak into red-hot magma.

Divine Martial True Person snorted lightly upon seeing this and immediately moved to meet the attack.

The *Shan Yue Zhen Hai Hammer* whipped up a golden storm. Xu Yunfan’s arm muscles bulged and coiled. The momentum of the hammers was like an angry dragon churning the river, every strike causing the earth veins to roar.

Divine Martial True Person’s sleeves billowed, and the purple lightning at his fingertips condensed into substance, transforming into nine ferocious lightning pythons that pounced downward.

Xu Yunfan crossed his hammers, their edges precisely cutting off the vital spots of the lightning pythons. Before the exploding lightning could disperse, he spun and closed in, delivering a “Thousand Mountain Collapse” strike aimed straight at Divine Martial True Person’s face!

Divine Martial True Person tapped the tip of his foot, his figure retreating three zhang like a phantom. The spot where he had stood instantly collapsed into a hundred-zhang-deep pit. He reversed his hand and formed a seal. The sky suddenly split open, and meteorites wrapped in raging flames fell to strike. However, Xu Yunfan used the momentum of his hammers to guide them, and the dark light of the earth veins turned into chains that shattered the meteorites into a sky full of fire rain.

The two figures crossed paths in the fire rain. The shockwaves from the collision of hammer shadows and lightning tore the clouds within ten miles into shreds.

Three hundred moves passed in the blink of an eye.

Where hammer and lightning met, mountains and rivers were reshaped. Earth veins were plowed into blackened ravines by thunder, and the wind from the hammers split the sea of clouds in two. Xu Yunfan’s hammer technique grew wilder the longer he fought; the Ten Extremities True Qi surged through his meridians like molten rock. Divine Martial True Person’s thunder methods grew increasingly grim, with black killing intent faintly appearing within the purple electricity.

Another three hundred moves, and the outcome remained undecided.

Suddenly, Xu Yunfan’s hammer momentum changed. The nine scarlet-gold dragon patterns detached from the hammers and turned into chains that wrapped around Divine Martial True Person’s feet.

Divine Martial True Person sneered, and a bronze ancient mirror flew out from his sleeve. The light from the mirror froze the dragon-patterned chains inch by inch...

Xu Yunfan had seen this bronze ancient mirror before; it was the artifact held by Chen Jiuchuan. It looked ordinary, but in the hands of Divine Martial True Person, it had the effect of turning decay into magic.

Three hundred moves passed in the blink of an eye.

Divine Martial True Person grew more shocked the longer he fought.

This junior was clearly only at the Land Immortal realm, yet the true qi within his body was as deep and boundless as an ocean. What was even more terrifying was the characteristic of the Ten Extremities Martial Dao; every breath forcibly plundered a massive amount of spiritual energy, which was converted into new true qi to replenish consumption through the pores of his entire body. This recovery speed was actually thirty percent faster than his own ability to summon the spiritual energy of heaven and earth!

“Old thing, is this your Martial Dao?”

Xu Yunfan’s arms shook, and the *Shan Yue Zhen Hai Hammer*, carrying the momentum of a mountain collapse, slammed down. The lightning dragon attacking head-on shattered inch by inch under the hammer edge, and the exploding purple lightning remnants spread like a spider web across the void.

He used the rebound force to retreat a hundred zhang through the air. The scales of his dragon armor kept flapping, buzzing amidst the remnants of the thunderstorm.

However, Divine Martial True Person’s eyes were as cold as ice. The lightning dragon just now, powerful enough to flatten a mountain, did not cause Xu Yunfan’s breath to fluctuate in the slightest.

The scarlet-gold dragon patterns on Xu Yunfan’s hammers emitted a low hum. He stared at the figure flickering in the depths of the lightning, the Ten Extremities True Qi surging like a river in his meridians.

This hammer strike had only used physical strength. But the opponent could control such pure thunder energy, with every move summoning the Thunder of the Divine Sky.

If it were anyone else, if it were another Land Immortal realm expert facing this, they would either die or be crippled after taking just a few lightning strikes.

Xu Yunfan was somewhat curious. “Although a Land Immortal can summon the power of heaven and earth, it is merely to accelerate the recovery of true qi, and martial techniques only slightly borrow the squeezing force of heaven and earth. The ability to mobilize the spiritual energy of heaven and earth with a mere lift of your hand... is not the Martial Dao, is it?”

“A frog at the bottom of a well!”

Although a faint smile hung on Divine Martial True Person’s lips, a layer of frost gathered in his eyes. He only now realized that his rash appearance this time was a fatal misjudgment. The strength of the Xu Yunfan before him had far exceeded his estimation!

Was the Land Immortal realm this strong? Did it possess such a vast quantity of true qi?

Divine Martial True Person couldn't help but mutter in his heart.

If it were Chen Jiuchuan himself, with that body forged through a thousand hammerings and the true essence cultivated for many years, he probably wouldn't last even three breaths in front of this person...

As these thoughts flashed through his mind, Divine Martial True Person’s moves suddenly changed.

He pushed both palms forward. The movement seemed slow, like pushing a mountain, but was actually faster than lightning.
