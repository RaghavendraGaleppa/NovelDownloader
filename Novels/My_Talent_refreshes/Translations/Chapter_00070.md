# Chapter 70: Gengjin Sword Talisman  

"Junior Brother, the person responsible for the Yanji Market area is Elder Lin Changqing from the External Affairs Hall.  

This elder has a rather cold personality and isn't the easiest to get along with.  

However, if it's convenient for you, Junior Brother, you might consider offering some spirit plants or talismans when the opportunity arises."  

Zhuang Yunde hinted without elaborating further.  

Chu Ning quickly understood. It seemed this elder's temperament was different from He Changyou and Liao Yunming, the two elders he knew, but rather similar to this Senior Brother Zhuang.  

After thanking Zhuang Yunde again, Chu Ning left his courtyard and headed toward Mu Ling's residence.  

Mu Ling was in her courtyard today. As soon as Chu Ning entered, he clasped his hands and said,  

"Thank you, Senior Sister Mu, for informing me in advance..."  

"Enough with the formalities," Mu Ling waved her hand, then tilted her head slightly, her eyes fixed intently on Chu Ning.  

"I heard you have quite a talent for talisman-making. Elder Liao actually took you into the Spirit Talisman Pavilion and taught you the art.  

"That was Elder Liao's kindness," Chu Ning replied modestly, not mentioning that he had also obtained the Spirit Talisman Scripture.  

Mu Ling shook her head like a rattle-drum.  

"I don't believe it. Elder Liao has high standards—your talent must be exceptional."  

Without waiting for Chu Ning to respond, she immediately continued,  

"Here, draw a Gengjin Sword Talisman for me, and I'll see for myself."  

"Gengjin Sword Talisman?" Chu Ning shook his head. "I don't know how."  

"You don’t know the Gengjin Sword Talisman?" Mu Ling frowned slightly.  

"This is a talisman that all disciples of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion must learn. How could you not know it? The pavilion often assigns it as a task."  

As she spoke, she took out a pale golden sheet of paper made from an unknown material and handed it to Chu Ning.  

Chu Ning examined it carefully, and the more he looked, the more certain he became that he had never learned this talisman.  

"Senior Sister Mu, I truly haven’t learned this one."  

Mu Ling shook her head again.  

"I don’t believe you. You must be lying. Unless you draw it for me, I’ll tell my grand-aunt that you sold me talisman paper on purpose."  

Chu Ning’s expression changed instantly. Without another word, he went straight to Mu Ling’s talisman-drawing table, picked up the brush, and began drawing.  

Admittedly, the Gengjin Sword Talisman was far more complex than any talisman Chu Ning had learned before. His first attempt failed halfway through.  

"Is this really a required talisman for the Spirit Talisman Pavilion? It feels incredibly difficult," Chu Ning thought to himself.  

But he didn’t dwell on it. Having been immersed in talisman-making recently, he found himself intrigued by the challenge.  

Focusing his mind, Chu Ning channeled spiritual energy into the brush and tried again.  

His second and third attempts also ended in failure.  

This made him take the task seriously. He carefully guided his spiritual energy along the brush strokes, ensuring not a single deviation.  

Though his pace slowed, under the support of his multiple buffs, he successfully completed the final stroke.  

As Chu Ning lifted the brush, a golden light flashed above the talisman paper, forming the pattern of the completed talisman.  

The next moment, the golden light vanished into the paper.  

"Finally succeeded!"  

Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction and was about to start on the next sheet when he glanced up and saw Mu Ling staring at him, her mouth slightly agape in shock.  

"You… you only needed four attempts to complete the Gengjin Sword Talisman?"  

Her voice was filled with disbelief and a complex mix of emotions.  

Chu Ning suddenly realized something was amiss and quickly asked,  

"Senior Sister Mu, is there something wrong? What’s the significance of this Gengjin Sword Talisman?"  

It dawned on him that a talisman of this difficulty couldn’t possibly be a basic requirement for the pavilion.  

Mu Ling was still looking at him with an indescribable expression.  

"I lied earlier. The Gengjin Sword Talisman isn’t part of the Spirit Talisman Pavilion’s teachings. My grand-aunt gave it to me.  

"Moreover, this is a mid-tier primary talisman with immense offensive power—almost comparable to some lower high-tier primary talismans.  

"It’s reputed to be the strongest offensive talisman among mid-tier primary ones."  

"A mid-tier primary talisman?"  

Chu Ning was stunned, especially after hearing how formidable it was.  

"I spent two months trying and still couldn’t make it, yet you…"  

Mu Ling’s tone was a mix of envy and dejection.  

"Only four attempts, and you succeeded!  

"So your talisman-making talent really is this incredible."  

She let out a self-deprecating laugh.  

"No—it turns out my talent is just that poor. No wonder they didn’t want me wasting talisman paper."  

Chu Ning watched Mu Ling, who seemed utterly crushed, and found himself at a loss for words.  

Just as he was about to offer some comfort, Mu Ling suddenly perked up as if reinvigorated.  

"No, I have to keep practicing. I refuse to believe I can’t master this damned talisman!  

"If cultivation isn’t my strength, then talisman-making has to be!"  

With that, she rushed to Chu Ning’s side before he could react, straightened her posture, and asked,  

"Do you have anything else?"  

"Ah, no, nothing important," Chu Ning quickly stepped aside.  

He then explained his purpose for visiting and placed 1,500 sheets of talisman paper on the table.  

"Senior Sister Mu, the hall has assigned me to an external market, so I won’t be able to buy talisman paper for you anymore."  

Mu Ling paused briefly before replying,  

"That’s fine. My grand-aunt has returned to the sect, so I probably won’t be confined anymore. I can buy it myself."  

She then added, "The Gengjin Sword Talisman is incredibly powerful and would sell well in the market.  

"Since you’ve learned it, consider it my gift to you."  

Chu Ning hesitated. "But what about Elder Mu…?"  

"It’s just a mid-tier primary talisman. A Golden Core cultivator like her wouldn’t care," Mu Ling said dismissively.  

With that, she picked up a blank sheet and started practicing.  

Chu Ning thanked her again and took his leave.  

As he stepped out of the courtyard, he faintly heard her muttering inside,  

"Is this talisman really that hard? If others can do it, why can’t I…"  

Chu Ning couldn’t help but smile to himself. "This senior sister is truly relentless."  

Remembering how he had almost tried to comfort her earlier, he shook his head in amusement.  

His gaze then fell on the Gengjin Sword Talisman in his hand.  

"The strongest offensive talisman among mid-tier primary ones… sounds impressive."  

Mu Ling had suggested he sell them in the market, but Chu Ning thought better of it.  

But making a few for personal use shouldn’t be a problem, right?  

Imagining himself unleashing a barrage of Gengjin Sword Qi with a flick of his wrist, a faint smile crept onto his lips.
