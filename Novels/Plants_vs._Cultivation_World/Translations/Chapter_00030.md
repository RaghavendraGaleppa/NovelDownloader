# Chapter 30: Investment

Yao Shifeng had arranged to meet everyone at a restaurant in the market—an establishment catering specifically to cultivators, offering various spirit wines, spirit rice, and spirit beast meat. Hosting guests here was undoubtedly a display of status and wealth.

After all, spirit wine, spirit rice, and spirit beast meat weren't cheap, far beyond the means of ordinary low-level cultivators. By choosing this venue, Yao Shifeng must have spent a considerable sum...

Gu Mo, who was marveling at Yao Shifeng's extravagance, suddenly noticed someone waving at him from the side of the restaurant. Upon closer inspection, it was none other than Yao Shifeng himself, the organizer of this gathering.

"Boss Yao, long time no see!"  

Seeing a familiar face, Gu Mo couldn't help but smile. Back in the outer disciple quarters, Yao Shifeng had shared many cultivation insights with the group. Of course, everyone had also provided Yao Shifeng with plenty of help in return, but Gu Mo didn’t mind this mutual exchange.

"Why aren’t we going inside?"  

After exchanging pleasantries, Gu Mo pointed at the restaurant, puzzled.  

"Do you think a place like this is something we outer disciples can afford?" Yao Shifeng spread his hands. He had chosen this location mainly for its recognizability. Given that none of them had likely visited the market in over a year, he figured a secluded spot would be hard to find. But this restaurant, as one of the most prominent buildings in the market, was easy to spot.  

"Fair point."  

Gu Mo nodded. Even with 811 spirit stones in his possession, he wouldn’t dare to splurge here. Only well-off late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators or Foundation Establishment experts could afford such luxuries.  

After waiting a while longer, Hu Hai, Wu Jinfei, and Chu Feifei arrived one after another. Like Gu Mo, they were immediately called over by Yao Shifeng upon arrival.  

The five of them then settled into a private room at a cheaper tavern, ordering a pot of low-grade spirit tea before getting down to conversation.  

Most of the talk revolved around their struggles. After joining their respective peaks, they had all come to understand the hardships of being outer disciples. Endless tasks filled their days. Take Yao Shifeng, for example—assigned to the Talisman Peak, his duty was to craft blank talismans.  

Only after producing a set number would he receive any compensation. To meet the quota, Yao Shifeng had poured almost all his time into crafting, even neglecting his cultivation. As a result, his progress had stagnated over the past year. It was no exaggeration to say that their time in the outer disciple quarters had been when their cultivation advanced the fastest.  

Back then, resources were provided by the sect, and all they had to do was focus on cultivation. But after joining their respective peaks, most of their time was consumed by menial tasks, and resources had to be earned through labor.  

Fortunately, after over a year of grinding, Yao Shifeng had honed his blank talisman crafting skills and could now complete his daily tasks with relative ease, freeing up some time for cultivation.  

But to Yao Shifeng, this still wasn’t enough. With his inferior spiritual roots, mere survival wasn’t sufficient—he needed to rise above. That was why he had turned to the group.  

"Everyone, I need your help once more!" Yao Shifeng stood and bowed deeply.  

"Boss Yao, we’ll need to discuss this among ourselves first," Wu Jinfei said, speaking for the group. While they all supported Yao Shifeng in principle—having endured the same struggles, they understood the hardships of lacking backing—they still needed to carefully consider how much they could contribute without hindering their own cultivation.  

"Of course."  

With that, Yao Shifeng excused himself and stepped out of the room.  

"Without affecting your own cultivation, how much can each of you spare?" Wu Jinfei asked, his gaze shifting from Hu Hai to Chu Feifei before finally landing on Gu Mo.  

In Wu Jinfei’s eyes, Gu Mo—the last among them to reach Qi Refinement and now assigned to the Spirit Plant Hall—was likely the poorest. Thus, the minimum contribution would likely depend on him.  

"Hu Hai, how much can you give?"  

Gu Mo turned to Hu Hai. In truth, with his current wealth, Gu Mo was easily the richest in the group. The real lower limit, he figured, would be Hu Hai.  

As for Chu Feifei, her resources probably ranked second, given her unique constitution. A simple cleansing spell activated her innate talent, boosting her cultivation speed. With steady progress, she could handle her outer disciple duties with relative ease, earning rewards accordingly.  

"I can spare 25 spirit stones at most."  

After some mental calculations, Hu Hai made his offer. Having joined the Alchemy Peak just a year ago, his inexperience meant he hadn’t earned much. Yet he was willing to contribute nearly half his savings, hoping Yao Shifeng’s rise would provide them all with a much-needed safety net.  

The bullying he’d endured as a newcomer was something he never wanted to relive.  

"Then let’s each contribute 25 stones." Wu Jinfei nodded. Though it pained him to part with that amount—more than Hu Hai could comfortably afford—he too longed for stability. The mistreatment of new outer disciples wasn’t unique to Hu Hai; Wu Jinfei had suffered similarly.  

Among the five, Gu Mo was likely the only one who hadn’t faced such issues. After joining the Spirit Plant Hall, he had directly rented a plot of spiritual land outside the valley, working independently and avoiding conflicts with other outer disciples.  

In fact, many in the Spirit Plant Hall now saw Gu Mo as someone to curry favor with, thanks to the hall’s promotion of his "elite outer disciple" status—a rare privilege.  

"Thank you all for your trust!"  

When Yao Shifeng accepted the 100 spirit stones, the dimmed confidence in his eyes reignited. Upon joining the Talisman Peak, he had assumed that as the second among their batch to reach Qi Refinement, he’d receive preferential treatment.  

Instead, he got nothing. The peak was filled with former top performers from previous years—first, second, and third-place disciples from past batches, all assigned to the Alchemy, Artifact, Talisman, or Formation Peaks. Among them, Yao Shifeng was just another face.  

But now, with the support of his friends, he was certain he could surpass them all. This was the first step toward his rise.
