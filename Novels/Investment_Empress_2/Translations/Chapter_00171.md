Chapter 171: The New Punishment is Announced

Yunzhou.

The Nine Heavens and Ten Lands are vast and boundless.

Geographically, the Nine Heavens are divided into nine states. The Central Desolate State is ruled directly by the Great Yu Imperial Family and is the most outstanding and spiritually rich of them all.

But the other Nine Heavens and Ten Lands also had their own glorious eras.

For example, Yunzhou.

Yunzhou has many swordsmen. Before the emergence of the Tianshan Sword Manor, it was a true holy land of the Dao of Swords in the Nine Heavens and Ten Lands. Even the Great Yu Martial Emperor once studied in Hengyun Sword City.

After handing over the assassins from the Drizzle Building to the authorities, the group from the Clear Abyss Sect passed through the Jinghai dense forest.

......

Time passed.

In the blink of an eye, half a month had gone by.

A camp by a stream a hundred miles outside Yunzhou City.

"Breaking through to the Divine Manifestation Realm is truly not an easy task."

Inside a simple tent, Li Mo was examining the small figure within his Dantian.

The complex and mysterious patterns on the small figure now numbered only seven. There was still a long way to go before he could completely comprehend the painting of the Ice Cube's Ascension to Immortality and the Dao.

Of course, he could now attempt to open the second orifice. The strength of his Will-Soul was sufficient to support it.

However, the stronger his Will-Soul, the vaster the orifice he could open.

Little Li had the conditions to do so.

Naturally, he wanted to take every step to the extreme.

After breakfast, he went as usual to the tent next door—Ying Bing's.

"Wait a moment for me."

From inside the tent, the Ice Cube's calm voice was heard, accompanied by a strange, peculiar fluctuation.

It didn't seem like a breakthrough.

Was it because of that sword art?

These past few days, the two of them would cross pointers every day. Li Mo was practicing the *Solitary Nine Swords*, while Ying Bing was refining the new, divine-level sword art she had learned.

Li Mo could sense that the Ice Cube was improving very quickly, and that sword art was of a very high grade.

Could it be related to the sword art?

Forget it.

I'll just use the Providence Divine Eye to take a look later.

"I'll know if there's an investment opportunity once I take a look later."

Li Mo shrugged and went to make breakfast.

Chef Li was in charge of cooking.

The other senior and junior brothers and sisters自觉地 (自觉地 - consciously/automatically) started the fire and washed the pots, everything in good order.

Soon, a pot of wild vegetable and strange treasure soup was ready.

"Junior Brother Li, have you finished writing that letter regarding the Drizzle Building matter?"

"Yes. Once we reach Yunzhou City, I'll hand it over to the disciples of Hengyun Sword City."

Li Mo nodded and ladled a bowl of soup for Princess Jiang Chulong.

Hengyun Sword City in Yunzhou was just like the Clear Abyss Sect in Ziyang Prefecture.

It was more appropriate to leave matters to the local host to handle.

Not long after.

Jiang Chulong suddenly pricked up her ears and looked back.

"What is it?"

Just as Li Mo was feeling puzzled, he heard a clear, resonant sword cry that startled the birds in the forest into flight.

Everyone got to their feet.

Li Mo followed Jiang Chulong's gaze.

He saw the tightly closed tent swaying without any wind.

"I'm fine."

A voice as clear as jade came from within.

Inside the tent.

Ying Bing slowly opened her eyes. In her gaze, there was a hint of an ethereal quality.

The first three stances of the *Sword of the Divine Sky and Heavenly Heart* were almost flawless.

Contemplating the essence of this divine sword art, her heart grew increasingly calm.

However.

Just as she was about to go out...

[Host has completed the previous punishment.]
[The third round of comparison will commence in thirty days. The Host must be eager for it.]
[Do you wish to initiate the Loser's Punishment? If initiated, the rewards will be even more abundant.]

Ying Bing's footsteps paused.

She furrowed her delicate brows, hesitating for a moment.

The first time, she had not hesitated at all, feeling there was no challenge and the system was just giving her rewards for free.

The second time, she felt it was just a fluke...

What about this time?

Ying Bing's mind flashed through every scene of Tianfrost and Chixiao clashing during this period.

In swordplay, he hadn't won against her since that time.
In cultivation realm, she was comprehending the Divine Forms of the Great Dao—one was the Great Yin, the other the Hundred Birds' Phoenix Form.
As for that divine weapon, it could be completely offset by using a True Phoenix Feather.

To this day, Ying Bing still didn't know why Li Mo had been ranked above her last time.

That's right.
The Hengyun Sword Mark.
With the help of the sword mark, the *Sword of the Divine Sky and Heavenly Heart* could be elevated to another level.

"Losing isn't可怕 (可怕 - terrifying)."
"What's terrifying is losing the heart to seek the Dao."

This was a truth Ying Bing had long understood.
It was also the tenet of that divine sword art.

[The Loser's Punishment has been successfully initiated.]
[The punishment conditions have been determined.]
[Condition]: "Request the winner's touch."
[Requirement]: "At least 80% of the body's surface area, oh~"

*Crack.*

A certain big-headed doll was suddenly clenched in a slender hand.

She... suddenly felt a bit of regret.

A touch, and she has to request it?

She couldn't imagine herself asking for such a thing!

She couldn't lose...
This time, she absolutely... must not lose...
She must obtain and comprehend the sword mark...

"Ice Cube, come out for breakfast. We're preparing to enter the city."

Outside.

Li Mo looked at the tent that hadn't had any movement for a long time and found it strange.

"It's been quiet for a while, why hasn't the Ice Cube come out yet..."

"She's already finished her martial arts comprehension, right?"

"Mm-hmm," Jiang Chulong nodded carefully.

"That's strange..."

Just as Li Mo was feeling puzzled, a notification sounded in his ear.

[Congratulations, Host, for successfully investing in 'Ying Bing' and helping her comprehend a sword art.]
[Investment Feedback: *Flicking Flower Finger*]

Hearing the name, it sounded like some kind of finger technique masterpiece?
But he was already busy practicing his hammer and sword, where would he find the time to practice some finger technique...

Li Mo took a sip of his soup, not understanding why the system would give such a reward.

[*Flicking Flower Finger*]: "Masterpiece-level finger technique. With a touch as if guided by a god, it can precisely stimulate acupoints all over the body. It is truly a divine massage technique for relieving fatigue!"
"Advisory: Do not use on the opposite sex, as it may lead to being reported to the authorities and arrested."

*Pfft—*

The soup Li Mo had just drunk spurted out all over.

What the hell?

A masterpiece, with such a grand and lofty name, and you're telling me it's for massage?

"Brother Li, what's wrong with you?" Jiang Chulong hurriedly patted his back.

"Cough, cough, it's nothing, I just thought of a exquisite martial art..."

Li Mo wiped his mouth.

Massage is one thing, but what does the last sentence of the description mean?

Is this massage of yours... proper?
