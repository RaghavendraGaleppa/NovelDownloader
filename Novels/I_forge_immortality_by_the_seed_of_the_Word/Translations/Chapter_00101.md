# Chapter 99: Repaying Kindness and Departure

In the shallow waters...

"Junior Sister Yang, hurry and flank them! Don't let them escape!" 

The rotund male cultivator shouted at the only female disciple among their group of four, his face twisted with tension.

"Understood, I'm coming," the one addressed as 'Junior Sister Yang' responded softly before channeling her spiritual energy to swiftly maneuver toward his position, her movements as fluid as a fish.

"Everyone, pay attention! Start herding these two beasts into position," the leader of the group bellowed.

Before long...

They had successfully trapped the two fish-like spirit creatures against a crescent-shaped underwater cliff.

Seeing the cornered spirit creatures, the four cultivators exchanged satisfied smiles.

"According to our agreement, it's my turn with Junior Sister Yang this time," the rotund cultivator said excitedly, rubbing his hands together.

But just then...

"Something's wrong!" the leader suddenly shouted in alarm.

A grave expression slowly crept across his face.

"What is it, senior brother?" Junior Sister Yang asked curiously.

"Look at these two spirit creatures," the leader pointed at the trembling creatures before them, his voice low. "Don't you think their behavior is strange?"

"They're shaking—that's just fear, isn't it? Perfectly normal," the rotund cultivator said carelessly after staring at the creatures for a while without noticing anything unusual.

"But their eyes aren't focused on us."

"What they fear isn't us, but—"

The leader followed the direction of the creatures' gaze.

It led toward the abyssal depths.

A pitch-black void where nothing was visible.

The distance was too great, and with the seawater obstructing their spiritual senses, they couldn't detect anything.

Yet...

When he looked in that direction, an inexplicable sense of dread washed over him, growing stronger by the moment—as if something terrifying was rapidly approaching.

Soon...

The others also began to sense the oppressive, malevolent aura.

"What in the world is that?" The rotund cultivator's face paled.

No one answered him.

"It's here!" a sharp cry suddenly rang out.

In their line of sight...

A massive black flood dragon appeared, its body stretching dozens of zhang in length, covered in dark scales. Only the horn atop its head shimmered with an eerie white glow, exuding a bone-chilling aura just from sight alone.

An overwhelming killing intent permeated the surroundings.

And before this divine flood dragon...

Was a school of several hundred spirit creatures of various shapes and species.

Their only common trait—they were all desperately fleeing.

Yet it was all futile.

With a single flick of its tail, the terrifying black flood dragon accelerated severalfold, catching up to the massive group of spirit creatures in mere moments.

In an instant...

A flash of white light erupted from the flood dragon's horn before its colossal body swept through the water, unleashing a devastating current that stretched for dozens of li.

Where they had been...

The hundreds of lively spirit creatures from moments ago had been silently erased, leaving behind only countless crimson shards of ice.

Crack! Crack! Crack!

The tiny ice fragments were carried by the current, pelting the five cultivators.

They couldn't even dodge.

Their bodies had already been paralyzed by the flood dragon's killing intent and freezing aura.

Time passed slowly.

"This is still the Fourth Virtual Heaven, right?" The rotund cultivator asked Junior Sister Yang while flexing his stiff limbs, his face betraying a hint of terror.

When she nodded...

He couldn't help but curse under his breath, "Why would something this horrifying appear in the Fourth Virtual Heaven? Does that make any sense?"

"Perhaps it's—a treasure!" the leader said, his eyes blazing with desire.

But the next moment, his expression dimmed.

The gap was too vast!

There was no hope of hunting it.

Given the terrifying power the black flood dragon had just displayed, their group of four would likely be reduced to frozen debris before they even got close—wasting twenty spiritual essences for nothing.

Elsewhere...

Song Ci was quietly hiding behind a cluster of coral, concealing his aura while keeping his gaze fixed on a gray-black crab spirit creature over a person's height that was foraging nearby.

He was waiting for an opportunity.

The perfect moment for a single, lethal strike.

Gradually...

The crab spirit turned around.

"Now!" Song Ci's eyes lit up.

Just as he was about to strike, he suddenly noticed the crab spirit seemed to sense something—its six legs scurrying frantically as it fled downward in panic.

Frozen in place, Song Ci suddenly felt a bone-deep chill.

He stiffly turned his head.

A dozens-of-zhang-long black flood dragon, moving with earth-shaking momentum, loomed larger and larger in his vision.

Song Ci's soul nearly fled his body!

He wanted to run, but his body was already locked in place.

Yet the next moment...

Song Ci saw a flash of light envelop the black flood dragon before its massive form abruptly vanished.

In its place stood a young man.

"Junior Brother Zhang Jing?!"

Song Ci rubbed his eyes, wondering if he was seeing things.

"Senior Brother Song," Zhang Jing approached him warmly. "I was just about to look for you, and here we meet by chance."

"Junior Brother, that flood dragon of yours..."

Song Ci gestured wildly with his hands, trying to articulate his thoughts but failing to form coherent words.

Half a quarter-hour later...

He finally calmed down somewhat, looking at Zhang Jing with undisguised envy. "Junior Brother, was that the legendary Lunar Flood Dragon Dao Intent just now?"

Zhang Jing nodded.

Receiving confirmation...

"So it really was! As expected of a Dao Intent—its might is truly terrifying!"

Recalling the earlier scene, Song Ci couldn't help but shudder.

"By the way, Junior Brother, you mentioned you were looking for me?"

He seemed to only now process the earlier statement, looking at Zhang Jing curiously.

"Senior Brother, are you cultivating the Shadow Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme?" Zhang Jing asked knowingly.

"Eh? How did you know, Junior Brother? Don't tell me you're also—"

Song Ci exclaimed in surprise.

"Indeed, I also cultivate the Shadow Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme."

After a pause, Zhang Jing continued:

"I'm preparing to ascend to the Fifth Virtual Heaven, so before departing, I wanted to share some insights about the Shadow Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme with you, in hopes it might be of some assistance."

Zhang Jing smiled.

Opposite him...

Upon hearing these words...

Song Ci's mind blanked momentarily, his mouth hanging open uncontrollably.

After recovering somewhat...

"Junior Brother, this... this immense kindness... I... I truly don't know how to thank you!" Song Ci grabbed Zhang Jing's hands tightly, his eyes reddening with emotion.

For someone who had transformed the Shadow Flood Dragon Devouring Void Dao Rhyme into the Lunar Flood Dragon Dao Intent to personally guide him in comprehending the Dao Rhyme—such an opportunity was beyond rare!

"Wait, Junior Brother, did you say you're going to the Fifth Virtual Heaven?"

Half a day later...

"Senior Brother, now that your Dao Rhyme comprehension has reached perfection, I shall take my leave!"

Zhang Jing laughed heartily.

With that, he transformed into a streak of rainbow light, shooting skyward.

Mid-ascent...

The rainbow light instantly morphed into a dozens-of-zhang-long black flood dragon that roared as it charged toward the Eighth Tier.

On the ground below...

"Junior Brother, no words can express my gratitude!"

Song Ci bowed deeply in Zhang Jing's direction.

At that moment...

Four streaks of rainbow light emerged from the sea, landing not far behind Song Ci.

"Brother Song, what are you bowing to?"

Junior Sister Yang asked curiously.

"Naturally to Junior Brother Zhang Jing—he guided me to perfect my Dao Rhyme. He deserves this bow," Song Ci replied without turning around.

"What? Perfect Dao Rhyme?"

Junior Sister Yang, the rotund cultivator, and the other two exclaimed simultaneously.

Their eyes immediately filled with envy.

The goal they had been striving for with all their might—and Song Ci had achieved it effortlessly thanks to a single junior brother?

Among the three...

The leader's eyes flickered thoughtfully.

He recalled that Song Ci cultivated a flood dragon Dao Rhyme—and so did he. Could he ask Song Ci to put in a good word and have Junior Brother Zhang Jing guide him as well?

Perfect Dao Rhyme!

After much deliberation...

He finally couldn't resist asking:

"Brother Song, could you... ask Junior Brother Zhang Jing to guide me as well?"

"Too late!" Song Ci smirked coldly, pointing at the black flood dragon in the sky. "That is Junior Brother Zhang Jing—he's about to enter the Fifth Virtual Heaven."

"Perhaps you could go ask him there yourself?"

Now that his Dao Rhyme was perfected, Song Ci no longer needed to defer to the leader and spoke bluntly.

Meanwhile...

The leader seemed not to hear Song Ci's words.

His gaze was fixed on the black flood dragon in the sky...

An involuntary look of horror and regret surfaced in his eyes.

"That flood dragon was Junior Brother Zhang Jing? And he's ascending to the Fifth Virtual Heaven?"

The other three beside him stared blankly.
