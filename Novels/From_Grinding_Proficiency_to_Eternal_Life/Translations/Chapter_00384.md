# Chapter 384: Martial Dao Profound Crystal, the Foundation Building Object

Xu Yunfan weighed the token in his hand, a faint smile curling at the corner of his mouth, and casually stuffed it into his personal spatial bag.

He had intended to put the back-mounted Xuan Steel Mechanism Box inside as well, which contained the Ginseng Child formed from the Ten Thousand Year Ginseng King—his daily medicinal supplement for cultivation. However, on second thought,万一 the spatial bag and the mechanism box were incompatible, allowing the Ginseng Child to seize the opportunity and escape, that would be a huge disaster.

"Forget it."

He muttered to himself and ultimately did not take the risk.

Half a day later, after clarifying various details, Xu Yunfan returned to Qingwei Mountain with Chen Jiuchuan.

The gates of the Dao Sect were shrouded in clouds and mist, with spiritual energy surging like tides, appearing even more prosperous than usual.

Bi Yuan was already waiting at the mountain peak. Seeing Xu Yunfan return, a look of relief flashed in his eyes.

"Master."

Xu Yunfan cupped his fists and bowed.

Bi Yuan nodded slightly, his gaze sweeping over Chen Jiuchuan as he asked, "Is this the foreign demon, the disciple of the Primordial Origin Sect?"

"Yes, he still has some use."

Xu Yunfan gave a brief explanation.

Upon hearing that this world was merely a realm under the Primordial Origin Sect where disciples could harvest 'blood food' at will, Bi Yuan stood stunned for a long while, only letting out a long sigh after a considerable time.

"So that's how it is. Such is the time, such is the fate."

Xu Yunfan did not delve deeper into this topic. After all, this news was too shocking; if he said too much, Bi Yuan might lose the will to live.

"Master, you need not overthink this. There may still be a way to break the situation here." He then changed the subject, "Disciple needs to borrow the eighth-grade divine weapon, the 'Xuantian Mirror,' to enter the shattered Small World Secret Realm."

Bi Yuan suppressed his thoughts upon hearing this and did not stop him. Half an hour ago, he had received news that of the Six Great Sects under heaven, only the Dao Sect remained.

Xu Yunfan had swept through various sects with his own strength, and even the disciples of the Primordial Origin Sect had become playthings in his hands. What was there to fear from a mere secret realm?

"The secret realm is shattered, and its laws are chaotic. Even though you have stepped into the Land of the Immortal, you must be cautious," Bi Yuan reminded him solemnly, flipping his hand to take out an ancient bronze mirror. The surface of the mirror was like water, faintly reflecting distorted spatial ripples.

"Disciple understands."

Xu Yunfan took the Xuantian Mirror, and with a swipe of his fingertip across the mirror's surface, it immediately stirred up a wave of spatial ripples.

Bi Yuan said no more, only giving him a deep look. "Come back alive."

Xu Yunfan smiled. "Rest assured, Master. There is no one in this world who is my match."

With the strength of half-step Foundation Establishment, he only needed a Vein Opening Pill to reshape his meridians and one Foundation Establishment Dao Object to have a high probability of promoting to the Dao and entering the Foundation Establishment realm.

The light of the Xuantian Mirror flared brightly. Xu Yunfan held the mirror in one hand and grabbed Chen Jiuchuan with the other. His figure instantly turned into a流光 (flowing light) and plunged into the world within the mirror.

The scene before him changed abruptly.

The Small World Secret Realm had been pulled by the Xuantian Mirror earlier; the sky was shattered, the earth was disintegrated, and countless spatial cracks spread like spider webs.

According to Chen Jiuchuan, this place was once a Small World Secret Realm opened up by the Divine Martial True Lord, a hidden place for refining the Martial Dao Profound Crystal, but now it had become ruins.

A foul wind carrying a fishy scent rushed towards them. From the distance came a low, thunderous dragon roar, mixed with pain and fury.

"Senior... Senior, that flood dragon is in the center of the secret realm!" Chen Jiuchuan's voice carried a hint of fervor. A path to Foundation Establishment where no one had yet succeeded naturally made everyone envious. He pointed towards the distance.

Xu Yunfan narrowed his eyes, his figure flashed, and with the surge of his Ten Extremities True Qi, he crossed a thousand zhang in an instant.

A hundred-zhang-long flood dragon was coiled among the shattered mountains. Its scales had peeled off, revealing white bones, and dragon blood poured down like a waterfall, dyeing the land within several miles a dark red.

The flood dragon was originally coiled in a pool of blood, its dragon breath as weak as a candle in the wind. However, the moment Xu Yunfan entered the hundred-zhang range, it sensed the aura of a living being and suddenly raised its head. Purple light flickered in its golden pupils, and its aura was not weak at all. If one didn't see its form, who would think it was on the verge of death from severe injuries!

"Roar!"

A earth-shattering roar exploded through the void. The flood dragon raised its head high, and the purple light in its golden pupils暴涨 (swelled violently), like two eerie blood moons suddenly lighting up!

A mighty dragon might erupted violently, sweeping through the surroundings like a collapsing mountain or a tsunami, causing the rocks in the area to crack inch by inch.

Although its scales were in tatters, its fierce aura did not diminish in the slightest; it was even more violent than in its prime, as if its near-death state had stimulated the deepest ferocity of its bloodline!

If one hadn't seen its scarred dragon body with their own eyes, anyone would have thought this was an ancient fierce beast at its peak, not one on the verge of death from severe injuries!

"Roar!"

The flood dragon roared in fury, its dragon might surging like a tide, causing the space around it to crack once more.

Xu Yunfan sneered and raised his hand to strike.

Chen Jiuchuan hurriedly said, "Lord, please don't kill it. If this evil dragon dies, then the Martial Dao Profound Crystal will never be able to appear."

Xu Yunfan heard this and changed his motion.

"Suppress."

The Ten Extremities True Qi erupted violently, transforming into scarlet golden chains through the method of shaping true qi. The vast true qi, like a boundless misty sea, transformed into a net that entangled the dragon from all directions!

Watching the chains flying all over the sky, Chen Jiuchuan widened his mouth in astonishment.

Even though the true qi within Xu Yunfan had not yet transformed into true essence, with this shockingly abundant true qi, he could be said to be the number one person below Foundation Establishment.

It was simply too monstrous!

The flood dragon struggled frantically, its tail shattering mountains, but it could not break free from the chains' restraint.

Xu Yunfan clenched his five fingers, and the chains tightened abruptly. The flood dragon let out a miserable howl, its massive body forcibly pressed into the ground!

"Lord, be careful!" Chen Jiuchuan suddenly exclaimed, "There's demonic energy flowing out from its body!"

Sure enough,紫黑色 (purple-black) mist seeped from the flood dragon's wounds, actually corroding the Ten Extremities True Qi, and the chains emitted a piercing cracking sound.

Xu Yunfan's expression remained unchanged as he flipped his hand and took out the Shaking Mountain and Suppressing Sea Hammer, striking it down through the air.

"Eight Wastelands Dragon Fall · Heaven's Collapse!"

The hammer fell like the sky collapsing. The Ten Extremities True Qi, manifesting through the Pure Yang Hundred Forms, unleashed nine phantom scarlet golden flood dragons that roared out and slammed fiercely into the flood dragon's true body!

Amidst the flying flesh and blood, the purple-black demonic energy was burned away by the Pure Yang True Qi.

The flood dragon finally exhausted its strength, collapsing on the ground, barely breathing. The ferocity in its golden pupils gradually dissipated, replaced by a hint of clarity. Its dragon eyes revealed a trace of despair and sorrow.

Xu Yunfan stepped through the air and arrived, standing atop the flood dragon's head and looking down at it. His eyelids did not even twitch. "How do I refine it into a Profound Crystal?"

Chen Jiuchuan hurriedly said, "According to the records in the Divine Martial True Lord's notes, one must use a True Fire to melt its flesh and soul together, ultimately condensing it into a Profound Pearl."

"True Fire?"

Xu Yunfan raised an eyebrow, secretly feeling fortunate.

The Ten Extremities Martial Dao he cultivated allowed his true qi to condense the Nine曜 Swallowing Qi and Dragon Tiger Pill Qi. By then using Pure Yang power to stimulate it, it was sufficient to derive a Scarlet Flame True Fire.

Although it could not compare to the Innate True Fire condensed from true essence, it was more than enough to deal with this severely injured evil dragon!

He hesitated no longer. With a flip of his palm, scarlet golden flames suddenly rose up. Within the flame light, the images of a dragon and tiger entwining were faintly visible. The scorching high temperature caused the surrounding air to distort.

The flood dragon seemed to sense it; its golden pupils shrank, and it struggled to escape, but it was firmly restrained by the scarlet golden chains transformed by Xu Yunfan's Ten Extremities True Qi!

Xu Yunfan let out a soft shout, and the Scarlet Flame True Fire poured down like a waterfall, instantly engulfing the flood dragon!

(I returned late today; I will continue to work hard tomorrow. Thank you all for your support. The journey to the Taihua Spirit Ruins World will become increasingly exciting. I hope everyone will enjoy it.)
