# Chapter 18: The Violent Bonus of Equipment Attributes!

This was merely Zhang Yan grumbling to himself.  

Had others heard his words, they might have been tempted to dig up his ancestral graves.  

If mastering spells were truly this easy, there would be no need for the Enlightenment Peak—just a simple scripture repository where disciples could exchange for whatever techniques they desired.  

Why would specialized instructors even be necessary?  

Did people think these lecturers had nothing better to do?  

This session on the *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword* left Zhang Yan somewhat bored.  

After learning it, he followed his usual routine and purchased three Enlightenment Cushions:  

One for *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword (Minor Achievement)*.  
Two for *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword (Novice Level)*.  

Only then did he leave the Enlightenment Peak, satisfied.  

Summoning his Golden Bamboo Sword, he wobbled unsteadily as he enjoyed the thrill of "sword surfing," heading toward his spirit fields.  

As he passed the outer sect gates, he saw a dense crowd in the distance, their clamoring voices faintly audible. Above them, numerous cultivators hovered on flying artifacts, spectating like bystanders at a melon-eating session.  

Curious, Zhang Yan approached one of them and asked, "Brother, what’s happening here? Why such a commotion in the sect?"  

The cultivator turned, initially annoyed, but upon seeing Zhang Yan’s youthful appearance and the Golden Bamboo Sword beneath his feet, his expression softened into a smile.  

"Younger brother, you may not know this, but all these people below are disciples who’ve been in the sect for a year."  

"Why are they gathered here?" Zhang Yan pressed.  

"Because they failed to condense qi within the year—they never reached Qi Refinement." As he spoke, a trace of fear flashed across the cultivator’s face.  

Hearing this, Zhang Yan recalled the relevant sect rules.  

Major sects like the Qingheng Sect imposed strict requirements on their disciples, unlike rogue cultivators or minor clans who would take anyone with a spiritual root.  

Though the sect accepted these disciples and provided cultivation techniques, those who failed to achieve Qi Refinement within a year were expelled without exception.  

Once one entered the sect, the divide between immortal and mortal became absolute.  

Had these people never glimpsed the world of cultivation, they might have lived in ignorant contentment.  

But now, having witnessed the wonders of immortality and come so close to grasping it themselves, how could they possibly let go?  

At this moment, a realization struck Zhang Yan.  

---

**No wonder!**  

No wonder Elder Lin had stared at him like he was a monster when he achieved Qi Refinement in just one month. And when he mastered the *Wood Essence Technique*, the elder had even tried to introduce his daughter to Zhang Yan.  

At the time, Zhang Yan hadn’t thought much of it.  

Now, he understood—his displayed talent had been terrifyingly exceptional!  

Too bad Elder Lin’s daughter hadn’t seized the opportunity.  

Glancing at the crowd below, Zhang Yan shook his head.  

The path of immortality wasn’t so easily walked.  

Without further involvement, he turned his Golden Bamboo Sword and left. Those people on the ground had already reached a dead end.  

---

Returning to his valley, Zhang Yan eagerly equipped an Enlightenment Cushion inscribed with *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword (Minor Achievement)*.  

Instantly, his mind cleared.  

"Go!"  

He flicked his fingers, and a small golden sword materialized at his fingertips, wreathed in faint emerald light.  

This was the *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword* at Minor Achievement.  

With a flick, the sword shot forward, striking a thick tree trunk.  

*Thud!*  

A hole less than half an inch deep appeared in the trunk.  

"This power…"  

"Truly a pest-extermination spell!"  

Zhang Yan’s cheek twitched at the sight.  

He had known this was a spell meant for killing insects, but this level of damage was pitiful.  

"With this, how am I supposed to defend myself?"  

After a moment’s thought, he gritted his teeth and equipped the Spirit Hoe, which had the *Sharpness* attribute—capable of enhancing his spells and artifacts.  

"Let’s test the effect!"  

He cast the *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword* again.  

*Thwip!*  

This time, the golden sword pierced nearly ten inches into the trunk, almost penetrating it entirely.  

"It works!"  

Zhang Yan’s eyes lit up with excitement.  

This level of power was more than enough for self-defense.  

A single strike like this could likely surpass even the combat spells of a third-level Qi Refinement cultivator.  

"And I still have the Golden Bamboo Sword!"  

Remembering its *Sharpness* attribute, Zhang Yan equipped it as well.  

If Enlightenment Cushions could stack their effects, then *Sharpness* likely could too.  

---

"One more try!"  

He aimed at the already wounded tree and unleashed another *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword*.  

*Crack!*  

This time, the golden sword pierced clean through the trunk and even drilled a hole through a second, arm-thick tree before dissipating.  

"This…"  

Staring at the perfectly smooth holes, Zhang Yan was stunned.  

This power…  

Was downright excessive!  

Not only did it surpass ordinary early-stage Qi Refinement spells, but it might even rival mid-stage techniques.  

And this wasn’t even his limit!  

With three equipment slots, once he fully mastered the *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword*, he could replace the Enlightenment Cushion with another *Sharpness*-enhanced artifact.  

At that point, even late-stage Qi Refinement cultivators might struggle to defend against a surprise attack.  

A faint smile curled his lips.  

Ah, the sweet taste of security!  

Glancing at the mutilated tree, Zhang Yan decided to chop it down for firewood.  

The true power of his *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword* was a trump card—no one could know about it.  

"Besides, I should hunt for more attribute-bearing artifacts to optimize my setup."  

Currently, his equipment had useful attributes but lacked synergy.  

He had two *Sharpness* attributes, three *Enlightenment* attributes, and specialized ones for *Gengjin Grass Pheasant Sword* and *Wood Essence Technique*, but they were barely functional.  

"I should also look for *Swiftness* attributes."  

"Or maybe something that boosts survivability."  

He recalled the *Swiftness* attribute on the Greenwood Boat—perfect for a quick escape when needed!
